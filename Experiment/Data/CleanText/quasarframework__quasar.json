One of the problems with Cordova wrapped Apps is that the runtime differes based on your phone/tablet.\nJust released Quasar CLI v0.1.1 which also installs Crosswalk plugin. This also adds the runtime to your App's package so it ensures your App is performing exactly the same on all phones/tablets.\nFirst, npm update -g quasar-cli, then you have two options:\n1. Delete the wrapper you've already made and create it again\nbash\n   $ rm -rf wrapper\n   $ quasar wrap\n2. Add the cordova-crosswalk plugin yourself:\nbash\n   $ quasar wrap plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview\nIn either situations, uninstall your App from your phone/tablet then install it with the new wrapper (quasar wrap run). Run these steps and tell me if this solves your problem. I just tested with Samsung S4 and the icon issues seems to be fixed.\nOne problem remaining is that indeed \"star_rate\" icon is not displayed as it should. Further investigating.\n.

Yes, you need the Android sdk installed and also to issue quasar wrap platform add [platform]. I should probably be more clear on the documentation. Will make a quick update now. Thanks for replying!\n. Fixed in latest version of material-design-icons. Quasar v0.5 now lets use set your own dependency versions, so closing this as you can upgrade to mdicons' latest version.\n. Use the App Configuration file to specify your dependencies. You are interested in deps property.\n1. First npm install the Vue Components dependecies.\n2. Configure quasar.build.yml:\n   Example for vue-google-maps (not the whole file, just what you are interested in):\nyaml\n   deps:\n     js: [\n       'node_modules/q/q.js',\n       'node_modules/lodash/index.js',\n       'node_modules/vue-google-maps/index.js'\n       ]\nAs dependency string needed for quasar.build.yml, look into the node_modules folder of your installed component and check for the main entry point (usually in a dist folder). You can read the component's package.json for this property.\n3. Use your Vue Component:\nGenerally speaking, look at standalone usage for the Vue Components you want to use. In vue-google-maps case, you should declare the components yourself before using them. Here is an extract from their website:\njs\n   // they inject VueGoogleMap global:\n   VueGoogleMap.load({\n       'key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',\n   });\n   Vue.component('google-map', VueGoogleMap.Map);\nYou have three options for including the declarations above.\nA) You can include these declarations in src/index.html inside quasar.boot():\n``` js\n     quasar.boot(function() {\n       VueGoogleMap.load({\n         'key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',\n       });\n       Vue.component('google-map', VueGoogleMap.Map);\n   quasar.start.app();\n });\n\n```\nB) ... or you can make a JS file like src/js/app.js and require it from src/index.html. Read about the   Quasar Starting Point.\nC) Include the declarations in a Page script file (script.page-name.js) before module.exports if you are using the Component just for that Page.\nWill also add a page for this on the documentation website.\nPlease reopen if you encounter problems.\n. Just include lodash and Q. Vue is supplied by default, so you can ignore the warning (or npm install it to avoid the warning, but do not add it in quasar.build.yml).\nDo not require('VueGoogleMap'). Simply use the global that vue-google-maps injects: VueGoogleMap, like this:\njs\nVueGoogleMap.load({\n  'key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',\n});\nVue.component('google-map', VueGoogleMap.Map);\n// also declare the other components that you want to use from vue-google-maps\nPlease note that development builds include sourcemaps.\n. And when I say \"include lodash and Q\" I mean \"npm install\" them and add them to quasar.build.yml.\n. Tried an example myself and got same error. Opened a bug for vue-google-maps:\nhttps://github.com/GuillaumeLeclerc/vue-google-maps/issues/81\nThe map seems to be working though, even if I got that error.\n. When using an Object or Array as data for your POST request then the data is JSON stringified hence the \"string\" representation. If on the other hand your data is already a string, it will be sent as-is.\nWill update the documentation website to include this.\n. This is currently disabled but will be added back in a future release (v0.2 or v0.3) soon. I need to carefully think this through.\nThe initial implementation took into consideration a hash (Array) property in the Page's manifest file (config.page-name.yml). It was working perfectly until I added a feature so that switching between Pages using same Layout does not destroy them (so they can maintain their state). Now I need to re-think how the system will work so the two features be compatible with one another.\n. Will make this a priority.\n. Commit pushed to repository. Will make a new Quasar release and update the documentation website soon.\n. Released Quasar Framework v0.2.0 with lots of new features. It also includes support for parameterized Page routes.\n. I will add an option to the command, but until then you can remove Crosswalk:\nbash\n$ quasar wrap plugin remove cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview\n. Released Quasar CLI v0.1.3 which adds this option to skip Crosswalk. Read release notes here.\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. If you mean simultaneously, side by side, this is currently not available, but will be in the future.\nMeanwhile you can switch between the two themes easily by calling quasar.swap.theme(). Either call it in the browser console or make a temporary button in your layout or page for this:\nhtml\n<button class=\"primary\" @click=\"$quasar.swap.theme()\">Swap</button>\nMake sure you are building both themes in your quasar.build.yml file by commenting out (or removing) the forceTheme property. Please note that live previewing with both themes is a little more costly than building just one.\nPlease also note that Quasar detects that you are running under a desktop browser and there are some subtle differences for mobile platforms. To emulate an iOS or Android device, use Google Chrome: open Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+J) and click on Toggle device mode (Ctrl+Shift+M). Select iPhone 5 or Galaxy S5 then refresh your browser so Quasar picks up the new platform.\n\n\nWill add support to preview both themes side by side in the future.\n. @denisx304 There is no way to swap themes currently, due to how Webpack works.. Looking into it on Mondays.\n. Can you tell me pls:\n1. Xcode version are you using\n2. Mac OS version\n3. Phone OS version\n4. Cordova version\n\nThanks!\n. Delete the wrapper folder and quasar wrap it again.\nIt may be that you were using Cordova 4.1.1 when making the wrapper then you've upgraded Cordova to 6.2.0. Common issue when using Cordova. Are you in that situation as well?\nTell me if making wrapper again with the new version solves the issue. It may not, because I saw the same error reported for Cordova on Stackoverflow in many cases. Anyways, I'll get to the bottom of it.\n. quasar wrap issues amongst other things cordova create <folder> command (in this case the folder is wrapper).\nTry to create a Cordova project outside of your Quasar App folder (cordova create test-folder) and see if it installs cordova-ios 4.1.1. I would expect this to be the case, although latest cordova-ios version is 4.2.0. Trying to make sure Quasar CLI is not at fault here. Then we'll see what to do next.\n. Currently installing OS X El Capitan on a virtualbox so I can dug in deeper. Can you tell me if running the default Cordova App (so the folder created earlier outside of Quasar folder) issues the same error when run in the simulator? Thanks!\n. Reproduced the issue. Investigating and fixing.\n. Fix will be available in v0.4.1\n. Released v0.4.1 containing the fix.\n. Thanks for the appreciation!\nYou can include GraphQL in your application as a dependency. I saw they have an NPM package that you can install for the client side (https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) to import a dependency here: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/importing-dependencies.html\nIt would be best to hold on for the next update to Quasar which will add Babel support and a brand new build system for even better speed and (besides many other advantages) making the importing a dependency super easy. vue-loader is also on the table.\n. I see. Well, for the time being, Quasar 0.4.0 has Vuex installed by default. You can npm install apollo-client and/or graphql and use them. Make sure you tell Quasar that you'd like them included (see the Importing Dependencies link I posted earlier). Basically you can use ANY front-end libs you like with Quasar.\nAfter the next big update (that I'm currently working on), managing ANY dependency will be super easy and straightforward and way simplified.\nRazvan\n. You got my email on https://github.com/rstoenescu\n. That's great!!! Thx for letting me know.\n. Thank you so much, Peter!\nI've been working hard on this framework for almost a year now on my own money. Any help is highly appreciated!\nI've set up a page on Bountysource: https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/quasar-framework\nOn the website there is also a \"Support Quasar\" link which leads to this page: http://quasar-framework.org/support-quasar-framework.html\n. Thank you for your generous support!\nWatch out for the next release that I'm working on. It will bring new faster build system & CLI, ES6, vue-loader support, hot reload, just to name a few novelties.\nFollow me on Twitter @quasarframework for updates.\nBig thanks again!\n. For now I would suggest just diving through the documentation (specifically for the Web Components and API which will remain the same in the next version) as the architecture will suffer heavy breaking changes (needed improvements).\n-Razvan\n. Next Quasar will be based on 1.x too.\nThere are plans to upgrade to 2.x once Vue gets out of beta.\n. Hi,\nYes, Quasar has a CLI too. First NPM install globally quasar-cli then read here: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/create-app.html\nOnly thing to notice is that Quasar is undergoing major changes to support ES6, vue-loader, smarter starter boilerplate, hot reload, e2e testing, faster build times, smaller footprint, new and faster CLI and many more! v0.5.0 coming soon. See \"dev\" branch for progress.\nThis new version is scheduled to be released in less than 2 weeks. It's a game changer. Stay tuned and if you can help out I'd be more than thrilled. You can also contact me by email. I am going to start a team on Quasar very soon.\n-Razvan\n. Hi,\nYes, Quasar has a CLI too.

The reason is simple: it wraps the given template with required HTML markup so you won't have to.\nAn instantiated VM would have to already contain the markup. But let's think for a moment: we wanna be able to pass instantiated VM so we can also pass data, right? But we can already do that. If we want to be able to access data scope for our Modal, just pass a Javascript reference when creating Modal:\n``` js\nvar someData = {\n   progress: 5,\n   list: [....]\n}\nlet modal = Modal.create({\n   data: {\n     someData\n   },\n   template: '...'\n})\n// don't destroy it when we close it,\n// so we can show it up again when we want to\nmodal.set({selfDestroy: false})\nmodal.show()\nsomeData.progress = 7\nmodal.close()\nmodal.show()\nmodal.close()\nsomeData.progress = 10\n// ....or even\nmodal.vm.someData.progress = 10\nmodal.show()\n....\nmodal.close()\n/// finally when we don't need it anymore:\nmodal.destroy()\n```\nIt's easier to write a *.vue component file and use it to create your Modal:\njs\nimport { Modal } from 'quasar'\nimport LoginScreen from './login.vue'\nModal.create(LoginScreen)\nOk, so we've seen we can skip accessing data through events, vuex etc, but Vue best practices dictates that it's best to anyway use Vuex due to its many advantages.\nNext Quasar (v0.6.0 -- skipping 0.5.1 due to its many novelties) will also make Modal be able to use a VM object containing an element, so you can use an existing template in DOM.\nGiven said that, is there still a case you wanna use and can't with current Modal?\n.

Add a watcher for your VM data prop on the VM object and validate it there, for example.\n. Will make a thorough analysis on how Modal management can be improved though. Thanks for opening this issue!\n. The width of the element that can open a Drawer (by swipe/pan touch action) is 15px, which means you can't tap on a button or anything on those 15px from left side (or right side, depending where you place your Drawer). Making that area thicker is a bad idea because it means not being able to interact with any element placed beneath it so a larger area with which you can't interact on your UI.\nOn a real mobile device there's no problem getting the Drawer opened, so I see no problem here. What do you think?\n. Ok, glad I could help.\n. Thanks for the kind words. It will go in next release v0.7.0. I wanted to add it for a long time, and I think it's finally time to do it.\n. Thank you and please go ahead and use it. Follow the Twitter account where all the Quasar news go and spread the word. The more we are the better Quasar gets.\nAlso, it's in no way required but take a look at the \"Support Quasar\" if you like.\n. Great examples. Will work it for v0.7. Thanks for the tips!\n. Yep. You'll be able to pick a date, a time or a datetime.\n. Excited about the progress! It's gonna be a top-notch component.\n. One of key aspects that I wanted in v0.5 is to allow developers to structure their code as they feel like. The original design was too \"heavy\" with pages, each having its own folder with multiple files.\nAs the new architecture allows for greater flexibility there comes greater responsibility. The recommended way to go would just as done in Quasar Play app, which is to structure folders based on routes.\nThe template and load() function are there just as a starting point. You as a developer are free to change it however you like.. even delete it and just require each route component.\nSince you can structure code to your liking, it's a good thing to use aliases just like you did in the webpack.base.conf.js file.\nLayouts should contain markup that wrap your pages. I know, title is linked to the page, but there are ways to communicate between components, like Vuex or simply using a \"store\" just like in Quasar Play app. Take a look.\nThe reason why we shouldn't include layouts in page views is that:\n1. Duplication occurs (which defeats the purpose of layouts). Imagine for example that you would have to duplicate the navigational tabs on each page. Changing the label of one tab would make you go through all pages for this. Maybe you forget one page. Hell comes loose :) Same for that button that you may place on a toolbar. Same for colors and everything else.\n2. There's no way to place the Drawer on the left or right side of page view on bigger width windows if toolbars are placed within page templates. The layout uses flexbox to place its components. Take a look in Developer tools.\nSo to summarize, best way is just like in Quasar app, where a \"store\" .js file was written which controls the toolbars. Include that store in each page and change Toolbars from data within that store.\n. Please reopen if I missed something.\n. @37ch4 There's an opened ticket on swipe actions. It will get into Quasar 1.0.\nBut reordering? You're in control of the template where you use QLists, so the order is app-space specific.. Reanalyzed the situation and its seems that using .quasar-gallery wrapping <div>s is enough. Will add this to the documentation website.\n. Pushed:\ncommit 3436bd01fabbc485940984ffff6d1b7d8ab9ab5d\nAuthor: Razvan Stoenescu razvan.stoenescu@gmail.com\nDate:   Wed Aug 24 15:45:38 2016 +0300\n```\nrefactor: Polished Stepper #36\n\n\"Next\" button should be labeled as \"Continue\"\nUncompleted steps' number icon should be grayed out\nCompleted steps' number icon should be replaced by a check mark\n```\n. Make a detailed proposal please and we'll get this done in v0.7.0.\n. Will add the two props to v0.7.0 and also think about autocomplete too, which was on my mind for some time too.\n. Props \"icon\" and \"placeholder\" added.\n. Will be available in v0.14.. Example:\n\nhtml\n<div class=\"drawer-header\">\n  <img :src=\"'statics/mountains.jpg'\">\n  <a class=\"avatar\">\n    <img :src=\"'statics/boy-avatar.png'\">\n  </a>\n  <div>Quasar Framework</div>\n  <div>some@email.com</div>\n</div>\n. Pushed commit to implement <q-autocomplete> component.. Vue 2.0 is definitely on the roadmap. Just not now. Waiting for the ecosystem to grow and become stable. I personally hate it when I stumble on packages that are not yet stable and find different bugs.\n. Reopened issue so other know this thing is scheduled.\n. Saw that. Will see what I can do about it. I hardly wait to port everything to Vue 2.0 myself :)\n. Looked into Vue 2.0 and used the migration helper to see what needs to be changed. Will start working on this with first chance I get.\n. Created v0.8 branch to handle this.\n. Actively working on this on v0.8 branch now\n. Thx! Great!\n. I sure hope so!\n. Thank you for this bug! You should open such a bug because it's important too.\nPlanning to rewrite the landing the page. Haven't given it much attention, so let's see if I can find time for the website too. One thing though, this should be opened against the website's github: https://github.com/rstoenescu/quasar-site\nOpen issues for anything. Quasar must be top notch on all aspects.\n. What browser are you using?\n. Weird. It looks fine to me. Will investigate more.\n. Seems like I reproduced the small white lines issue by changing zoom through the browser. At least it's a starting point :)\n. Accordions will be replaced by a feature for List tiles (former list items) in v0.7 soon, so not worth it to fix anything for Collapsibles.\nThe text realigning is an effect of changing the padding for the content. In my perspective I thought it was an interesting effect, but will drop it in v0.7. Anyway, thanks for addressing this!\nClosing the bug and please wait for v0.7 aka \"Polished\" :)\n. That's expected. If you want it to \"snap\" to values use snap attribute.\n. some examples that don't work please?\n. Please reopen with examples so I know what to fix :)\n. Are you saying it doesn't move at all? Or that you want to move at a lower rate?\n. 1. What size is the picture you are using?\n2. What is the height of the window?\n3. Did you set any height to the Parallax (through prop) and which is it?\n4. Are you using a layout or not?\n5. Is your parallax wrapped in an overflowed element on your page?\n6. Does the demo from doc website works for you?\n7. Which brwosers are you using?\n. Are copy pasting into your app? Does the demo from website works for you?\n. Using exactly same environment as you. Latest Chrome, viewing the doc website example. It works. Open up dev tools and refresh the page. Any errors in the console there?\n. Some screenshots to eliminate any confusion. This is how it is indended to be seen while scrolling.\n\n\n\n\n. Weird. I need to reproduce in order to fix it. But can't understand how it would act different on the same browser... Can you investigate a little please on your machine? Fork this repo and try to make something of it. NPM install then \"npm run dev\".\nYou'll see some buttons there, click on Parallax. Source of the page is in /dev/views/parallax.vue, source for Parallax is in src/web-components/parallax/parallax.vue.\nWill investigate too, but it's hard if I can't reproduce :(\n. If anyone else is experiencing this please join the discussion.\n. Omg, lol. But this is intended due to inner workings for scaling any image you give Parallax to work with. The intended effect is just as if you have a window (real life window) through your page and the window moves up or down, showing you different parts of the landscape behind it. From your description I though the background image does not move AT ALL (which would be a bug) as if you keep looking at the same part of the image regardless of the scroll position... aka as if you replace Parallax with a static image :)\nWhat you want is actually an enhancement, to be able to specify some speed for Parallax scroll.\n. By default, it will also \"move\" the image now.\n. Are you sure you're wrapping your <quasar-tab>s with a root <quasar-tabs>? If you don't, your code won't work. It you do, you'll know which tab is selected through selectedTab variable. Tested just now and it works. Please reopen if you still have an issue.\n. Example of dynamically changing tabs:\nhtml\n    <quasar-tabs>\n        <quasar-tab icon=\"assignment_returned\" :active=\"view === 'templates'\">\n          Templates\n        </quasar-tab>\n        <quasar-tab icon=\"person\" :active=\"view === 'men'\">\n          Men\n        </quasar-tab>\n        <quasar-tab icon=\"person_outline\" :active=\"view === 'women'>\n          Women\n        </quasar-tab>\n      </quasar-tabs>\nNow just change view.\nWorks with v0.7. Will make an enhancement for v0.8 and v0.9.\n. Don't think this will be an improvement as the title and description would be skipped. User has to read them first before filling in input boxes. Reopen if you have an idea on how user can read title and description while input textbox being focused.\n. Meanwhile you can use Popovers ;)\n. Will look into this too. Thanks for the suggestion. I think tooltips deserve a respawn with more capabilities.\n. Fixed in v0.9. Will release soon.. Hmm, nice. Didn't think of this case. You better use a Popover with a list with the three radios here. But anyway, investigating if this bug can be done, otherwise documenting that you shouldn't use it. The code there is quite complex and I don't want to make it even more complex.\n. Will make it work.\n. Basically you can set index to 0 and call the handler (loadMore() in your case) yourself. Will add a reset() method to do that for convenience. But the content must be reset by you since it's controlled by variables in your page's scope (items in your case).\nSo adding reset() which sets index to 0 and calls handler. Is this what you expect? Please confirm.\n. Infinite Scroll component now has two more methods:\n- reset ([Boolean])\n  - resets index and loads more content\n  - if parameter is \"true\" it does not load more content\n- loadMore ()\n  - triggers a \"refresh\" calling your \"handler\"\n. Yep, it's fixed in my commit. v0.7 will have it, which will be released really soon.\n. Remember dev tools is just an \"emulator\" and works far from perfect! I get this issue too sometimes but closing all chrome tabs and then reopening usually makes it work again.\n. Plus not to mention, the \"iPhones\" from chrome dev tools just offer the size of an iphone and the correct agent string in request headers.\n. You're right, but not really worth spending time on it at the moment. Maybe in the future. Or if you feel like it you can clone the repo and give it a try. Thanks for logging this!\n. There is such a component: Popover. You just have to populate it with the right content.\n. I'll write some types of Popovers for convenience. Thanks for pointing this out!\n. - <quasar-dialog-select> opens a Dialog\n- <quasar-select> opens up a Popover; three types available: radio, checkbox, toggle\n. Hi, can you be more specific please? Take a screenshot and highlight your areas of interest then drag-n-drop it here. Thanks!\n. Can you also copy paste your layout's template pls? I want to check something. Thanks!\n. I was interested more in how and where you place the tabs within the template. But nevertheless, Tabs are CSS responsive. On wide enough windows they stack to the left while on narrow windows they occupy all available width while dividing equal space for each tab. Most if not all Quasar components are designed to have width 100% (and not some predefined fixed width) so that you can wrap them in a div or other node type which actually has the width that you want. I won't get into details, but it works great with layouts or \"layout-padding\".\nIt's very late here and I'm exhausted and I'll continue tomorrow to help you, but what I suggest is that you wrap those Tabs in a DIV or even better in a Toolbar and set the width there. Your tabs will stack to the left and hopefully if I understood correctly this is what you want. Or try setting the width directly on <quasar-tabs>. Talk to you tomorrow more.\n. And make sure you don't have alignment set to center on your page's content. If so, explicitly set it to left (or right) on quasar-tabs.\n. Remove the justify-around CSS class from <quasar-tabs>.\n. Where are you looking for this?\n. Hmm, I hope we don't bump into same long discussion as yesterday :), but I see all moving same... And anyways, they all share exactly same code logic... Help?\n. It may be an illusion since first pic Parallax container is smaller...\n. Yep, that's it. Just an illusion. Parallax is trying to show as much as the image as it can during a full scroll, so it makes it have a \"higher speed\" for a smaller container than for a small Parallax container.\n. Thank you so much for your generous donation!!! Every cent counts.\n. Wish there were more like you!\n. So basically what you are saying is that openBasicModal() does not trigger?\nopenBasicModal() below:\njs\nModal.create({\n    template: '<p v-for=\"n in 10\">This is a basic modal. Scroll down to close.</p><button class=\"secondary\" @click=\"close()\">Close Me</button>'\n  })\n  .css({\n    padding: '50px',\n    minWidth: '50vw'\n  })\n  .show()\n. Then this would be the correct code for your *.vue file:\n```\n\n\n\nopen_in_new\n\nBasic Modal\nkeyboard_arrow_right\n\n\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    openBasicModal () {\n      Modal.create({\n        template: '<p v-for=\"n in 10\">This is a basic modal. Scroll down to close.</p><button class=\"secondary\" @click=\"close()\">Close Me</button>'\n      })\n      .css({\n        padding: '50px',\n        minWidth: '50vw'\n      })\n      .show()\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n. Or the template can contain:\nhtml\n<template>\n  <button class=\"primary\" @click=\"openBasicModal\">Open Modal</button>\n</template>\n. Good point. Let me make up a detailed design to discuss more and will push a commit afterwards.\n. Infinite Scroll methods:\n- loadMore() --> calls handler (index, function (stopLoading) {...} )\n- reset() --> resets index; does not resumes or stops it\n- stop() --> stops loading more\n- resume() --> starts it and triggers a loadMore() only if user has scrolled past the offset point\nInfinite Scroll props:\n- handler\n- inline --> when using inside an overflowed container\n- offset --> (Optional) Number representing offset in pixels of content height left to read that should trigger a loadMore(); default value: 1 container height.\n- working --> Boolean which specifies Infinite Scroll state; should IS work or not\nComments?\n. Will get into v0.7\n. Fix ready to be deployed.\n. Is this the standard boilerplate created by the CLI, with no alterations?\n. Will look right into it now.\n. I hope this does not affect the way you perceive the quality of Quasar :)\n. Investigating. Shouldn't take long.\n. For the life of me, I cannot reproduce... Please delete your app folder and make it again (quasar init app, cd app, npm install, quasar dev). Make sure npm install does not issue any errors...\n. Also, what Node and NPM version are you running?\n. I'll investigate tomorrow with your environment. By that error it seems that babel does not transpile.. very weird. Thank you for logging this bug!\n. Woah, would you be so kind to make this change in .eslintrc.js and tell me if this works for you, please?\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/commit/a20a796f4c9733d3379ecab9301a154fcc6820d2\n. I'm a little baffled. It's really weird, because that fix is already in the starter pack. Please explain exactly what you did to make it work so I can patch the starter kit.\n. bash\nnpm install -g npm-windows-upgrade\nnpm-windows-upgrade\n. I fix the problem running the command npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade\nnpm-windows-upgrade\n. Please open an issue on https://github.com/quasarframework/app-template-v2\nThe Quasar template is a fork of https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack so check out if someone else is having same issue ;)\n. On v0.14 when using vue router's history mode this will work by default.. @murbanowicz The uploader component should:\n\ndisplay upload status\nhandle multiple file uploads\nhandle upload of image files and display thumbnails\nhandle the upload by itself -- no code necessary for the dev to write. Don't think we need v-model.. @murbanowicz Yes, using events for this will suffice. And some property on the reference to tell which files are to be / were uploaded.. Just create two styl files file-upload.mat.styl and file-upload.ios.styl and place them in same directory. No styl tag should be placed in vue file. Also, there's the $http usage there which adds a dependendacy. That should be avoided. I know, writing a framework is hard. Thanks for tackling this!. Hi,\n\nGood ol' XmlHttpRequest. Take a look at https://github.com/james2doyle/vue-file-upload-component/blob/master/vue.file-upload.js#L42\nIt's a good starting point. There are some features that still need to be implemented (mentioned them earlier). Good work.\nCheers & thx for your help,\nRazvan. Awesome. Looking forward to your PR.\nFrom the looks of it, Promises needs a polyfill for IE (http://caniuse.com/#search=promise). Also just asking to make sure: you're not adding any deps to Quasar, right? It's extremely important.. @murbanowicz There's src/features/polyfills.js for adding polyfills. Keep overall code footprint as low as possible. The size of Q is important. Thanks for your help!. @murbanowicz Comments are stripped out when building for production, so it's ok to leave them on.. Uploader component available in Quasar edge or future v0.12. Some screenshots for your eyes:\n\nUploading:\n\nFailure example:\n\n. Will defer this to post v1.0.. Key points on how hard it would be to make a Bootstrap theme:\n\nWell, as you probably already know, Quasar is focused on performance. So if a CSS-only solution to a problem exists then it is preferred before a JS solution. As a result, many of the problems are solved by CSS. Furthermore, sometimes the CSS itself allows the JS to make run as few instructions as possible in order to solve a problem. This cannot be achieved if you take Bootstrap's CSS alone.\nThere are a lot of responsive components written for Quasar that are simply not covered by Bootstrapp.\n\nThis can be applied to any other CSS framework. For perfomance and low footprint, Quasar implemented its own CSS framework that optimizes all components and features to the near maximum. There's a lot to talk about these optimizations and will probably write an article about them, but it will take time (at least a day) that I currently don't have to spend. This will happen after the v1.0 release though.\nCheers.. It has come to my attention that Microsoft is officially killing its Windows Phone, so Quasar dev resources will be better spent on something else than a Metro theme, like its own unique theme ;)\nMicrosoft phones revenue tells the whole story too. As a result, will close this.\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/10/09/microsoft-finally-killing-windows-phone/\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-windows-phone-what-comes-next-for-microsoft-in-mobile/. Good example.\nWould anyone care to take a shot at it so we can speed up this one? Basically take the default Quasar template and change it for PWA. I'll polish it at the end and we'll integrate it with the CLI.\n. That would be awesome! Any help is greatly appreciated. I'm currently exhausted from the v0.7 release :)\n. It's much more complex than this. You have to handle the Service Workers. Tell them what and how to cache, retrieve, invalidate cache, handle going online - offline and backwards.\n. This is why I think a new starter kit should be made. If in the end it's just a matter of adding something on top of the default starter kit, then we'll do it by CLI.\n. @7ammer http://caniuse.com/#search=service%20worker\nYes, only Firefox and Chrome have that going. The target for a PWA would be only Firefox & Chrome at the moment.\n. @rwatts3 currently not a high priority unfortunately. Focusing on getting Quasar to v1.0 first. Unless someone wants to take a crack at it first.. Leaving here for reference: https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin\nI think this will help speed things up.. Please note that end of life for Crosswalk simply means you'll be able to use Quasar without it. The explanation is simple. Recent Android versions use WebView which got extracted from Android core and now it gets updates just like any app -- this guarantees users will use latest and greatest WebView regardless of Android version, making Crosswalk obsolete.. Will put this on higher priority after v0.14 release.. Yes, this is the plan.. @devzsolt Hi, thank you for sharing this. Can we schedule a talk after the v0.14 release? Currently on a very tight schedule to release the new version, but after that it's time for some new starter kits, and we can include this one too. What do you say?. Perfomance ratings will get a lot better with v0.14 ;). Very low priority and interest for this one. Will not get into v1.0. So dropping it.. Unfortunately, no. But there will be implemented soon as time allows. Thank you for your patience.. Yes, it will be something like what driver.js does.. Closing duplicate of #38 . Will continue tracking this issue from there.. Ah, I understand what you mean now. Will look into it.\n. Not Quasar's fault. Referencing https://remysharp.com/2012/05/24/issues-with-position-fixed-scrolling-on-ios#position-drift\nWill think of a workaround.. Finally found a workaround. Available in next Q v0.13.2 and edge version.. Drag with mouse or by touch actions.\n. This can probably be a component instead of a directive.\n. Will be available in v0.14. 1. You mean v0.2 and v0.6\n2. Are you trying to update Quasar version for one of your projects? A simple \"npm update quasar-framework\" will suffice. The \"quasar-framework\" dependency is marked as \"0.x\" which means it will upgrade to ANY new version up to v1.0.\n3. If for some reason you are running with an older NPM, simply edit package.json on a newly created quasar init folder and replace quasar-framework: 0.x with quasar-framework: ^0.6.0. Note that this change will not trigger an update to v0.7 when it will be available and so you have to manually edit the file again and npm update it.\nPlease reopen if I am missing something.\n. That's correct. It should always be in node_modules, installed by NPM.\n. Haven't worked with vuefire yet, but I thinks it needs special treatment from HMR. Currently only \"data\" is persistent. I see that \"firebase\" property there which surely gets reinitialized. Will try to make HMR work with it first chance I get, but it may take quite a while. Thanks for reporting!\n. Please open up an issue on https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hot-reload-api repo for this one.\n. Seems to be an issue strictly with NPM. Please update to NPM v3.\nbash\nnpm update npm\n. It's anyway recommended to use NPM v3 due to its superior dependency tree handling. Thanks for reporting though!\n. Help is always greatly appreciated. If you have energy and feel like it, please take a shot at it. I'm currently totally spent after the v0.7 release.\n. Will be available in v0.14.. Thanks for all the appreciations! I wouldn't normally do this, but take a look at http://quasar-framework.org/support-quasar-framework.html . I need some help so I can keep full-time focus on Quasar. Spread the word!\n. Yes, there are some needed breaking changes. Read the release notes (always).\nhttps://github.com/rstoenescu/quasar-framework/releases/tag/v0.7.0\n. Hmm, are you sure you don't have any circular references? I'm sure Quasar Play has more than 30 files. The build takes a few minutes, yeah, but this is due to the maaany many optimizations that need to be executed. Anyway, have never encountered a build not to finish. My guess is that you have a circular reference. Can you investigate a little, please?\n. From the Webpack doc website. There's a debug option you could use which switches loaders to debug mode. Add debug: true to top level of exported object in build/webpack.base.config.js and see what happens. Don't forget to remove it after your investigation :)\n. Any progress? Just curious.\n. Can you try with node 4 and latest npm? Also, did the debug method produce any results?\n. Let's move this issue to https://github.com/rstoenescu/quasar-templates/issues\nTrying to organize things here :)\n. Will look into it. But as a side note, that's probably because of webpack dev server itself or one of its deps. This server is used while developing, so there's actually no security risk for Apps built with Quasar. Thanks for pointing this out.\n. Moving to quasar-cli repo.. Will make some improvements to all form inputs soon. Thinking of doing a Quasar owned validation if I have enough free time.\n. Vee-validate seems the best option. Use that. Works with Vue 2 too.\nCurrent plan is to add only a few CSS classes like for error.\nNot sure it's worth it to duplicate work done by packages like vee-validate at this point.\n. Go with vee-validate and use the new \"has-error\" CSS class for form components. This will land in next Quasar version after v0.8.2.\n. Yes, forgot to correct the statement. It will be available in v0.9.\n. There are so many ways to handle the error message.. there's no \"generic\" way to go. So I'll leave it to the developers.\n. No need to open another issue.\nnpm install *-loader. example: pug-loader, coffee-loader etc\nIf you need to require/import different type of files, like '.coffee' etc, then:\nin 'build/webpack.base.conf.js' add an entry for your loader. example:\njs\n{\n   test: /\\.coffee$/,\n   loader: 'coffee',\n   exclude: /node_modules/\n}\nThis has to do with webpack, not Quasar. You think documentation should include this?\n. Paste your <script> tag here pls. data: -> {} is indeed not valid.\n. Aah, I see now. You need to disable eslint if you are using coffeescript. Remove the module.preLoaders block in your webpack.base.config.js.\n. Reference from vue-loader repo: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/162\n. Will do. Thx for opening this!\n. Will update docs along releasing v0.8 with this information. Thanks!\n. Please see #97 \n. Seems like a good idea. Will think about this. Thanks for taking an interest in making Quasar even better!\n. @murbanowicz Yes, definitely. There are Vue packages that can deal with this separately. No need for Quasar to reinvent the wheel as it doesn't add up any specific benefit.. @smolinari Yes. Will add the \"community driven\" components to the roadmap. There's a lot to talk about on this subject. Will comment at the right time.. Pushed some commits (available in v0.8.2) for Datetime internationalization.\n. @laurentpayot yes, kazupon is the right way to go for i18n. However we're not talking about this. Quasar requires i18n translations for a few components, otherwise, for example, you're going to get stuck with \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons no matter the language :) This will soon get fixed.\n. Just added a ticket for it #271\nIt's high on my priority list at the moment.. Just a few components use some labels that need translated, but managed to add props for them, so developers can use whatever labels they want to replace default ones.\nIt seems overkill for dev to handle Quasar i18n files just for a few labels. If in the future more components will require this, then an i18n system will be put in place. Until then, using props will suffice.. Oops, forgot about that. Just replace or delete the test case file in there.\n. Fixed. I think some more thinking needs to be put for testing with vue-router though. Need some help here.\n. Great. Looking forward to it!\n. Got a third party in my mind. If time would allow a quasarbin would be a killer to have, although that won't happen too soon. Got A LOT of work items to do before this would see the light of day.. Well you fully deserve it!!\n. Initial lists were implemented with Flexbox. The redo in v0.7 does not uses flexbox and fixes some of the initial lists issues. Plus they look much much good. Indeed 'has-secondary' feels like redundant, but this is because of CSS limitations. CSS4 selectors will introduce the previous sibling amongst other great enhancements :) Anyway, getting back to our discussion, re-redoing lists to use flexbox will get us into previous lists troubles. It's a LOT of work too, and not worth it for just being able to remove the has-secondary CSS class. Will keep this in mind, but closing for the moment.\n. Hey, don't worry. Log any idea you have. This is the only way we can truly improve things around here ;)\n. Quasar leaves that to you to organize files however you want. But I think you are referring to \"if I use this URL where should I put the font file\". This is where Webpack comes into play. It automatically bundles your dependencies (even fonts!). Let's say we specify @font-face in src/themes/app.variables.styl with src url(DevilBreezeBold.ttf). Then Webpack will look for  DevilBreezeBold.ttf file in the same folder (src/themes/) and add it to the bundle. The URL is parsed as being a relative path to the same folder of your CSS/Sass/SCSS/Stylus file where you declare it. Let me know if you need more clarifications.\n. Thank you for the suggestion! Made the changes you proposed to the starter kit.\n. Haha, nice one with the first screenahot. Made my day :D Would you care to post your last comment on the forum under Show & Tell?\nGlad I could help.\n. @disarticulate Take into consideration that you are using a path that gets processed by webpack. So if it's a relative path, is the relative path correct to the file location where it's defined? This is more of a question for the webpack forum/community.. Good points there. Will do.\n. Thank you for all those kind words! Just trying to do my best. There are soo many things I want to improve even more.\nLooking forward to seeing all your projects on Quasar succeed! We can showcase them if you guys want to. It would make me very proud and show that my efforts were not in vain.\n. Available in v0.14 and can be used like this in your *.vue files:\n```html\n\n@import '~variables'</p>\n<p>// your Stylus code\n\n```\nNote that you will need to take a look at the default template / starter kit and add some files for it. Or read about this in v0.14 documentation.. Hi,\nI'm thrilled if you want to contribute to the project! Here are some basic steps to get you started:\n1. Fork the repo\n2. Git clone it on your machine\n3. Checkout a topic branch from dev and merge back against dev.\n4. Create a pull request.\nSome more info here: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/contributing.html#Pull-Request-Guidelines and here: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/contributing.html#Development-Setup\nRun npm run dev, make yourself a new page on that UI and work your thing with it.\nDon't be discouraged if you don't understand everything. I'm here to help you get started if you have difficulties.\nI'm not sure what exactly you want to do though. Let's discuss before you start making changes please.\nThanks again for wanting to improve the project!\nCheers,\nRazvan\n. The tabs do follow the Material design guidelines. Your screenshot is just another way of displaying Tabs. They can be tweaked to look like this in the app's code.\n. Aaah, you are right. Don't know how that slipped away. We should change that. It's a matter of changing Quasar flexbox classes. Would you be so kind to take a look and try to do it? Read about the http://quasar-framework.org/api/css-grid-layout.html to familiarize yourself with those classes.\n. Right. That's already on my list too.\n. No need to apologize man. It's actually my fault. Didn't write it down. But anyways, it was just a side comment. Will refrain myself from doing that in the future so I don't give the wrong impression :) Please do log on any idea you may have! If the idea ain't here on the github issues then you're free to write it down. Thanks for helping out!\n. It might overlap with the Vue 2 work. Best thing is to wait for Vue 2 then jump in. Are you ok with this?\n. Trying to push v0.8 release this week. Let's see if I can make it happen so fast :)\n. Of course. We'll split the docs when updating them if you want. Thanks a lot!\n. Material ripples coming to v0.14 ;). I'm not sure I follow you. Specifying content in a directive is not so good. It hinders some of Vue's capabilities regarding the tab's content. Imagine complicated tabs with several other components and inline modals and so on... Did I understand correctly?\nAlso, the segment component is a good idea.\n. Hi, In v0.15 you can use the new component QBtnToggle which is essentially the same thing. So closing this.. First of all thank you your effort!\nIndeed there's an issue. \"moment\" should be a dev dependency, otherwise it will install a specific moment version in all apps. Each app must be able to manage its own dependencies... for example a certain momentjs version etc. That's why \"moment\" is currently only under \"peerDependencies\" which tells NPM that an app should install momentjs along quasar-framework.\nLong story short, \"moment\" needs to be under \"devDependencies\" :)\n. Thanks for logging this.\nNode v0.12 is very outdated. Try installing node v4, the LTS version.\n. Don't worry. I'm glad it's all good now!\n. Very easy to achieve this with State component. Discarding this ticket.. Thank you for implementing this! Great work!\n. @ag-coder Hmm, guess this needs a little bit of enhancement. It currently sets it same as your primary color.. @ag-coder Can you open up a new Github ticket for this pls? \"Enhance mobile browser address bar coloring\". I'll start working on it right now. Will make this optional so every developer can choose to color the addressbar with primary color (default) or another color, or opt out of coloring the address bar. Thanks!. Normally this would not happen since changing routes means changing view components (pages) and the popovers are destroyed when switching to another page because they are part of the old page.\nI'm interested in your particular case. Can you detail a little bit more please? Is popover part of your page view? Switching to another view has impact over the popover?, meaning if part of the page and route changes, then it should be destroyed. Please detail your case. Thanks!\n. Ok, figured out on Gitter channel. This would be an enhancement. To add back button support for Popovers too.\n. http://quasar-framework.org/guide/contributing.html\nNeeds to be more detailed, but it's a starting point. Fork Quasar and inspect package.json for npm scripts you can run. You'll need npm run dev to start a dev server, then go to \"Popovers\" button and click on it. Popover code is in src/vue-components/popover. Don't be discouraged if there's something you don't understand. I'm here to help! Thanks a lot for wanting to contribute!\n. You need to be very familiar with window.history object. Push state, replace state etc. It ain't the best example, but look at Modal and search for window.history.\n. Best documentation is on the official website: http://vuejs.org\n. You can use the \"placeholder\" property to display whatever you like. Make your own through a computed property: :placeholder=\"computedPlaceholder\". Pseudocode for computedPlaceholder:\nif model is empty\n  then return 'Choose a color'\nelse\n  return model[0] + ', ' + model[1] + ....\nWill also take this into consideration for the next Quasar version.\n. I think can be closed. Selects have evolved a lot lately. Please reopen if you think something can still be improved.\n. You're using one-line items there. Any particular CSS in your app breaking Quasar's one?\n. Couple of things to fix on your template:\n1. Remove 'has-secondary' from all your items. You don't have secondaries.\n2. Add 'two-lines' class to the following two-lines item:\nhtml\n          <div class=\"item\">\n            <i class=\"item-primary\">mail</i>\n            <div class=\"item-content has-secondary\">\n              <div>Avatar as Primary</div>\n              <div>test 2nd</div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\nAnd make your you don't have any CSS in your app interfering with Quasar's one regarding lists and items. Please reopen if problem persists. Thanks!\n. Also, are you using v0.7 or v0.6. I have a hunch you're on v0.6. Lists have been completely redesigned in v0.7.\n. Great! Glad I could help.\n. Please open build / starter pack issues only on https://github.com/rstoenescu/quasar-templates/issues\nMight be because you have one really big big image file in there and Node simply can't handle it.\n. Might be because you have some big asset files in your project. For dev build this is perfectly normal. It contains a lot of extra information, like source maps etc. For a detailed answer I'd have to look into your project. The starter kit is just a fork of the vue-cli's webpack one.\nPlease open build / starter pack issues only on https://github.com/rstoenescu/quasar-templates/issues\nThanks!\n. Great thoughts here. Green light on all.\n- Both enhancements should be delivered through two new props.\n- Point number 2 is especially hard to implement due to clicking/tapping inside of the interval making one of the two ends move to that point.\nGive it a try if you like. Welcoming any help! Thanks for opening this!\n. Implemented point 1 through \"label-always\" prop. Will open a new issue for point 2.\n. Continuing to track the remainder of work to do through #142 Range - drag whole range\n. I want this on all platforms, not just on desktop. Haven't figured out all the details, just opened this issue as a placeholder.\nMain idea: this will be a component applied to the scrolling container using Quasar's v-scroll directive on a floating button action. When user scrolled more than one-two screens (height depends on scrolling container) then this button should pop out nicely with an animation. Indeed I haven't seen this behavior on mobile platforms, so it might be just for desktop after all. But it may support a prop to tell it to show on mobile too.\nHaven't figured out all the rough edges anyways. Accepting (as always) proposals/discussion on this.\n. @fsgiudice haha. I thought you knew! :) Will take care of the PR as soon as I can.. Went with a more efficient & as generic as possible approach. As a directive, it can be applied to ANY element, as long as that element is absolute or fixed positioned. Custom trigger scroll offset and animation duration can be set.. Will investigate to see what's going on.\n. Can you please explain how Quasar is broken by Vue-Head? Any error messages? I bet it's the CSS that doesn't gets loaded? This is because Webpack itself injects CSS into the head of the document. If Vue-Head interferes and removes it then we have a problem. Please detail your case.\nThanks for logging this issue.\n. Can you put together a simple repo to see the issue, please? It would help a lot!\n. Well, first thing that I see is that itStarts.vue isn't connected to any route. And that's where you use Vue-Head. In src/router.js you only specify two routes, one for 404 and default for index.vue:\n``` js\nlet routes = {\n  // Not found\n  '*': {\n    component: load('error404')\n  },\n// Default\n  '/': {\n    component: load('index')\n    /\n    subRoutes: {\n    }\n    /\n  }\n}\n```\nAdd itStarts somewhere. In my case I just replaced load('index') with load('itStarts'). And vue-head worked. It updated everything. Screenshot attached:\n\nVue-Head is perfectly compatible with Quasar.\nPlease reopen if I missed something.\n. Glad I could help!\n. Well, if there is such a package already dealing with this, why not use this instead of reinventing the wheel? What would be the benefit of Quasar's own jwt and oauth2 authentication?\n. Are you building a Mobile app, just a website or both?\nIf just a website, then include that CDN link (to Chartist CSS) into the head of your index.html and you're good to go.\nIf also building a Mobile app, then npm install --save chartist and import chartist/dist/chartist.min.css from somewhere (maybe app.js).\n. Certainly not. You can do it care-free :)\n. Thanks for moving this to the forum, Dobromir! I appreciate it!\n. Moved this to quasar-site repo.\n. There's a bit of comment to do here, but you are right. This can be improved. And it will.\n. Thanks for opening this! Please do open issues where you think things can be improved.\n. Why closing?\n. Just realized this is a duplicate of #106. Can you screenshot it here, pls? Maybe the code you're using too.\n. Without any CSS overwrites, pls screenshot your select with stacked labels and copy-paste your HTML for it here.\n. Oh, I now see. I had an entirely different picture in mind. Anyway, haven't written these stacked labels to work with select. They work with input textboxes and textareas only. It's anyway pointless to use a stacked-label div with a select as it doesn't add any benefits like with an input textbox. Simply write your own HTML markup which incorporates a select.\nWill consider how this can be improved in the future though.\n. I plan on writing some form CSS classes in the future which will be of great help in scenarios like yours ;)\n. Will investigate. Thanks for opening this before releasing v0.8.\n. I'll release v0.7.1 with this fix later today then. It's easier so.\n. Just backported the fix to v0.7.1 and released it. Change your package.json to point to `\"quasar-framework\": \"0.7.1\"'. Then npm install it. Enjoy! \n. Some teasers. It's still WIP (in the very early dev stages, with lots of bugs) and I need help as I don't have enough time for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. Again, nice catch! Thank you!\n. Thanks for this! Nice catch.\n. Sure, will do. Maybe you can help a little to supply some polyfills in your own investigation? That would speed things up. Thanks!\n. I've been working like a machine these last few days for v0.8... my schedule was only sleep and programming. I'm very exhausted, so any help is appreciated :)\n. Array.prototype.find() polyfill will be available in Quasar v0.11 to be released soon.. Ok, some words on this. Due to the lack of some important CSS features, sorry but IE 9 and 10 won't be supported. Support will be available for IE11+ & Edge.. Yes. That's the CLI version, not the Quasar version you are using.\n. npm ls quasar-framework\nor at runtime:\n``` js\nimport Quasar from 'quasar'\nconsole.log(Quasar.version)\n```\n. Already in.\nhttp://quasar-framework.org/components/dialog.html#Confirm-Example\n. You can still have it. Nobody started working on it. Thanks so much!\n. Closing this issue. Will create a github project specific for the Range component.. Thanks for pointing this out!! Published a few hours ago 0.7.1 which overwrote the latest version which was 0.8.2. Republished with v0.8.3. It will work now. NPM install again please.\n. There was a Grid Vue component that wasn't ported to Vue 2. That is what's about. Not about CSS standards :)\n. Thank you. Next in line is the electron wrapper then this grid component. 2-3 weeks worst case.\n. Releasing new Quasar version at the end of this week which will have DataTable (replacing old Grid component).\nSome features:\n Sticky columns\n Sticky headers\n Filter (by all columns or by one column)\n Sorting by columns\n Cell formatter methods\n Cell component renderer (through Vue scoped slots)\n Pagination\n Column picker\n Row selection (single or multiple)\n Responsive (changes view design when width is smaller than 600px to best accommodate small screens)\n* Refresh functionality\n\n. Closing this. Will be available shortly in v0.10. Just follow the release notes https://github.com/rstoenescu/quasar-framework/releases/tag/v0.8.0\nAnd of course, the vue migration guide. Will add a page to the doc as time allows, but the release notes should cover for the moment. Working 18-20 hours a day, hope I don't go mad :)\n. Sent you an email. Thanks for wanting to join the party!\n. Good job! Thanks!\n. Good job! Thanks!\n. Any ideas on a shorter name for those props? They're too verbose.\n. Any ideas on a shorter name for those props? They're too verbose.\n. Thought about this more. Will there ever be a case where you would not want to be able to dismiss with escape key but be able to dismiss by clicking/tapping outside of the modal?

Quasar is designed so that your direct children of a layout router views to contain an empty <div> as in https://github.com/quasarframework/app-template-v2/blob/master/template/templates/view.vue:\nhtml\n<template>\n<div>\n  ...your router view template...\n</div>\n</template>\nThere are several reasons why this is so:\n1. Crossbrowser CSS compatibility\n2. Layout should fully extend on your viewport both on its height and width AND still allow scrolling for your view or layout. Any other implementation would either make your footer not visible at all times if your view template has height > 100vh OR it will position your footer right after view template (and not at bottom of screen) when view template has height < 100vh - header height.\nSo, use that extra empty <div> (which replaces <router-view> when Vue compiles) and everything will work correctly. When CLI generates a project folder you have that /templates folder there.

Will investigate if this is indeed an issue.\n. This would happen for history mode only, right?\n. Haven't investigated yet, but I bet that it's because drawer close event should be triggered before router-link (subcomponent of drawer-link) changes route. This happens in hash mode but router link Vue implementation breaks this when on history mode. It should have been implemented more consistently. Closing the drawer goes back one step in window history (we need this to be able to close drawer with back button). I'll see for a workaround. Thanks for your feedback all!\n. Just curious, when on history mode (only), do you get any errors in the browser console, like the one below?\ndom.js?bcd1:25 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'getComputedStyle' on 'Window': parameter 1 is not of type 'Element'.\n. Ok, a fix is on the way. Testing it from all angles.\n. Updated the \"v2\" default starter kit template with some work on history mode as first part of fixing this. https://github.com/quasarframework/app-template-v2/commit/6d3980fdef99618ea609a1cc57867fdc570a2899\n.

Hi,\nYes, Quasar uses fastclick. It depends on what your buttons do and how fast Vue 2 can render. Your delay might exist because of Vue struggling to cope with your templates.\n. Fastclick has not nothing to do with desktop. It just solves delays for taps on touch capable devices.\n. You have a video/gif or a live example or anything? I can hardly believe that. If mouse hover is not working then the basic CSS :hover is not working.. which is not likely these days... It's no magic code behind that mouse hover, just basic CSS :)\n. Ah, I see. It's got to do with card CSS rather than FAB itself. Will fix this.\n. Hi,\nYes, you can use <quasar-transition> on your <router-view>s (inside layouts too if you have any). It currently supports only one type of transition (slide) and next Quasar version will add the appear property. Quasar transition wraps <transition> Vue component so use it on only one descendent as child (not multiple nodes) as that would require the use of <group-transition>.\nThis component will get enhanced in later Quasar versions. It currently just isn't a high priority, so stay tuned :)\nCheers.\n. @rlam3 Check http://quasar-framework.org/components/transition.html & http://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase/animation/transition and use <transition> to wrap your page or <router-view>.. @murbanowicz can you elaborate a little on what exactly would you want Quasar to have? What are these templates? Should they be part of the default app template? Or is this something separate? Is this something we still need? Haven't used IntelliJ. Thx.. Closing this for now as it is not vital. Would also take a huge amount of time and maintenance. If anyone wants to take a shot at it let me know. Thanks!. Aha. You are referring to something else. Ok, will add a property. Do you care to make a PR? It's easy.\nEDIT: Actually scratch that. I got a nice idea and will implement it in next Q. Anyway, that \"close\" button currently has its purpose. It doesn't forces the user to find an area with no click/tap events attached so he/she can close that popup. When on a narrow screen like a mobile phone that can be a small issue ;)\n. The format is specifically for the label of the datetime picker, not for the picker itself. Will take into consideration your suggestion though. Thanks!\n. Yes, you are right and this is in the top priority list. It will drop in Quasar soon.\n. @murbanowicz The bug reported is invalid. Format is used for the label exclusively. \nWhat we are talking now is about 24hr material theme popover/dialog (so not talking about label anymore) which is a completely different thing. Take it as an enhancement. If you want you can open a new issue as a feature request, but this is high on the priority list as I need it also on a project, so I can't miss it :)\niOS theme already has 24hr support.\n. Hi,\nDon't worry about logging many issues, you are indeed making Q better with each.\n<button> is not a component but a simple DOM element. This has been designed with performance in mind, just like everything in Quasar. Whenever possible for Vue not to render a component we use a native DOM element. So, for buttons there's no binding to actually make it disabled. You as a developer deal with that. You got @click and you got CSS class disabled (that can be applied to anything). Let's take your example: you add disabled class when EventIsNew is true. Your duty is to also take care of dealing with EventIsNew in your @click method (if (EventIsNew) return).\n. I will make a statement soon about Vue Router's \"history\" mode. There are some technical limitations that cannot be currently overcome, the most important one being you can't build with history mode for Cordova.\n. You will understand why. It's logical.\n. You will be able to use history mode for websites only though. I'll write a directive for the scroll behavior which will work in both history and hash mode.\n. Then you'll be good ;) There's a progressive app starter kit on the todo list for Quasar.\n. Will update the default starter kit today (\"v2\") with some improvements for when using history mode. Make sure you update Quasar CLI too to generate a project and check it out.\n. If you haven't touched the /build and /config folders you'll be able to simply overwrite them with the new ones rather than checking the commit and applying same changes.\n. Check it now. Commit: https://github.com/quasarframework/app-template-v2/commit/6d3980fdef99618ea609a1cc57867fdc570a2899\n. Not reopening as this will duplicate: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/72\n. Check config/index.js. You got proxyTable: {}. Then check build/script.dev.js. Search for proxyMiddleware. Documentation available at https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware.\nExample:\njs\nproxyTable: {\n      // proxy all requests starting with /api\n      '/api': {\n        target: 'https://your-api.url/api',\n        changeOrigin: true,\n        pathRewrite: {\n          '^/api': ''\n        }\n      }\n    }\nThat's only for while developing. For production, it's your responsibility -- you may have to use CORS calls.\nPlease use the forum for questions. Thanks and hope it helps!\n. Use if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production')\n. @thiagoreri Please use Discord for questions. There's a flourishing community that will help you. But before that, read the docs.

If it can be done without restricting the user to a specific architecture regarding routes and nesting routes, then it will be implemented, otherwise not sure if it's gonna see the light of day :) This is just an initial rough statement.\n. You are perfectly right with your analysis. I'd add \"vue-animate\" to the discussion (https://github.com/haydenbbickerton/vue-animate) which has animate.css transitions already ported for Vue.\nFrom what I understand people want to be able to use some predefined transitions for pages. So an idea would be to check Material guidelines and see what fits from animate.css. Let's port over the basic transitions (like 'view', 'view-left', etc etc) that the devs can use Vue's <transition> or <transition-group> with. Transition names should be as generic as possible so same name can be applied across themes.\nEvery theme should have its own animations for each class, according to Material or iOS specifications (which can be found online -- no need for a phyisical phone to check them out).\n. Hmm, this is an old ticket. The transitions mentioned are already in v0.14 through quasar-extras package.. Hmm, this is an old ticket. The transitions mentioned are already in v0.14 through quasar-extras package.. I agree with you, but this is how those CSS transitions work. This should be done from within Vue and Vue Router code...

Quasar has no fault in this whatsoever...\nWill see if anything can be done, but I'm currently overloaded with other Quasar stuff at the moment. Any help would be greatly appreciated.. The purpose of Quasar is to allow simultaneously building mobile apps, websites, electron apps and PWAs. Yes, we could create some components to mimick the exact transitions out of the box, but it would greatly limit the freedom of building highly customisable pages. Quasar is not limited to components that should work on a mobile phone only. With some components (pages, toolbar, etc) specific for mobile you'd be very limited on what pages contain and how. Not to mention this needs to be responsive to allow all the range of width sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet). It would also mean we should divert A LOT from the Vue way of developing an app, with our own router.\nFortunately, the transitions that have been posted can be achieved with Quasar as-is, through animate css supplied by quasar-extras package. It requires a bit of work, but it's achievable. And it's part of the freedom that Quasar offers. We won't start dumbing down the framework just to allow building very specific page animations out of the box..

Pay attention to item-delimiter CSS class applied to Lists (or list items).\nThe last <hr> is hidden by Quasar by default. Why do you want that <hr> to be displayed since your List already has border?\n. This is more of a question for Webpack than for Quasar. You can read about handling static assets here: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-handling-static-assets.html\nSimply reference your image with a relative path (from *.vue file containing that \"src\"). Alternatively, you can use ~assets/... (to directly reference a file from /src/assets folder (this is due to the fact that the default project template created by Quasar CLI offers the assets Webpack alias).\nExample referencing an asset:\nhtml\n<img src=\"~assets/some-image.png\">\nExample referencing a static asset:\nhtml\n<img :src=\" 'statics/some-image.png' \">\n<!-- this is just a trick using dynamic Vue property so Webpack won't pick this image and reference it dynamically -->\n. Yes, emulators are not perfect. Chrome dev tools in particular is just a shallow emulator.\nAnyways, I cannot reproduce that in my browser. I'm running Chrome 52.0.2743.82 (64-bit). What's your Chrome version and OS? Thanks.\n. Recommended way to go when you want a simulator is to continue using Google Chrome dev tools, but with a stable version only. At the time of writing this, 53 is the latest stable version. It's recommended you use only stable releases.

Hello, please take a read at http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-wrapper.html#Remote-Debugging\nand see what's going on. This is most likely an issue with your own app. Do you experience the same issue with a new project folder created by CLI (and unaltered in any way). If yes, then there is a problem with your simulator. Waiting for your reply. Thanks!. Then it means it's something on your end.. The default template is proven to work... Have you tried with Chrome remote debugging?. Try chrome remote debugging first. It's super easy. Run simulator while using remote deb. It would help a lot.. @xereda If you could use the remote debugging still... I want to be 100% sure there's no corner case issue.. Run Android simulator and start chrome remote debugging.. What does the network tab show? should be some 404s?. Ok. Prolly something with your simulator. Closing issue as you said. Thx for supplying the debug info!. Does this happen on Android too? Did you change the publicPath in template's config? Take a read at http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-handling-static-assets.html and please tell me if you still have the issue.

Maybe in the following weeks, but I doubt I'll have time to spare. Unfortunately I got too many things to do (just look at the tickets left)... Need some help on this one.. I'm confused too. If you are talking about the top bar, that's something that can be done easily with current Quasar. So no need to write a specific component for this.. Hi, Please offer some some details on what you mean. Thanks!. Please reopen with explanations.. Agreed. . Yep. This is how it's going to be \"fixed\"..

Can you rephrase that pls? I don't know what you mean by \"it is changing model value but not changing QDateTime\". Also what is edition of element?. I'm sorry but I still don't get it. Can you please make a .vue file to isolate the issue with bare minimum working code and no deps to other parts of the code? Sometimes code speaks better than words :). @murbanowicz Any progress?. Please reopen with .vue file. Thanks.. @murbanowicz Are you using :to=\"{path: '/', exact: true}\" ? Notice the \"exact\" there. If so, remove it as you are not trying to match \"/\" exactly because you have nested routes.. Please reopen and answer the question above.  Thanks. Can't replicate your issue. Might be a misuse somewhere but I need your reply.. Documentation says: http://quasar-framework.org/components/drawer.html#Drawer-Content\nNote :to=\"{path: '/home/help', exact: true}\".\nexact has to be a prop of to instead of a standalone attribute.. Please always check documentation when something seems to not work. Saves us both time :). Hi, Just add .ellipsis CSS class for that. No change in Quasar required.. You can specify preventClose: true for a Dialog button. In this case the handler() will receive a second parameter which is a function that can close the Dialog.\nSo if you use preventClose then it's going to be your duty to close the dialog yourself by calling that second param function.\nExample:\njs\nDialog.create({\n  title: 'Prevent Close',\n  message: 'Having \"Prevent\" checkbox ticked and then hitting \"Try to Close\" button will prevent the dialog from closing.',\n  form: {\n    prevent: {\n      type: 'checkbox',\n      items: [\n        {label: 'Prevent dialog close', value: 'prevent', model: true}\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  buttons: [\n    {\n      label: 'Try to Close',\n      preventClose: true,\n      handler (data, close) {\n        if (!data.prevent.length) {\n          close(() => {\n            Toast.create(`Finally. It's closed now.`)\n          })\n          return\n        }\n        Toast.create('Untick \"Prevent\" checkbox to be able to close the Dialog.')\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}). That's a question for forum. I changed testing to something else don't worry.. Agreed. But moving proposal to quasar-cli repo.. Please open this ticket for app-template-default repo as requested in Quasar's readme.\nMake sure you port your app to webpack 2 setup correctly. It shouldn't give you any errors.. Hi.\nThere must be an issue with your App. This is more of a question for your own app, so the forum would be a better place to get help. So please do open a thread in forum (http://forum.quasar-framework.org/).\nInvestigate with Chrome Remote Debugging (@laurentpayot gave you a good link above).\nThanks.. New component coming soon for floating label.. PR is being worked on by @CookieJon . Consider this solved. There's a mega-patch coming up for form components.. @oswaldomilet It's exactly what I've been working on the whole week :) + more other form related things.. Will be available in v0.14. Good idea. Will see about this.. @smolinari It's pretty hard. Would take a huge amount of effort and rethinking of the way themes work... I can now say: \"yes\". Quasar will have equivalent dark themes for both Material and iOS themes.. Part of the implementation is done in v0.14. There's still a lot to do left, but it's a good start. Check \"dark\" props in v0.14 beta under forms.. @eminpala Google hasn't released the \"outline\" version in webfont format yet.. There's nothing stopping you from using only one theme for all platforms. Simply build with Material theme for both Android and iOS and your app will look the same.. Exporting to CSV or excel is a good idea and will do it. Opening a new ticket for this (#244).\nServer side request must be managed by the developer. There are multiple reasons for this:\n 1. Flexibility. There are multiple ways of doing Ajax requests: through the router hooks for a page, or in page's VM lifecycle hooks, or something else fancy. Don't want to force any of these ways onto the developer.\n 2. Code footprint should be as low as possible. Doing server side requests implies writing a home-grown Ajax solution or using an external library (axios, vue-resource, ...) which adds additional dependencies to any app. Also, choosing one external library is also not an option as some developer might want to use X ext lib while others Y ext lib. Forcing a lib limits the options for the developer which is to be avoided.. @smolinari Yes, of course. This is why I avoided implementing any server-side solution so far. Quasar should be able to work with any server-side solution.. @hverlin Hi, no need to open another one. There's one already for this and it's on the roadmap anyway. Thanks for taking time to make the suggestions!. @pribilinskiy DataTables are going to be revamped first thing when I get back from my vacation. There are many github tickets requesting features and all are going to be implemented.. Flexible pagination in v0.15.. Will do..     Column configuration \"style\" and \"classes\" props can now be methods too,\n    taking one parameter (value of cell).\nExample:\n{\n  label: 'Message',\n  field: 'message',\n  classes (val) {\n    return val.charAt(0) === 'L' ? 'bg-red' : 'bg-yellow'\n  },\n  sort: true,\n  width: '500px'\n}\n\n. Confirmed. Will fix it. Thanks for reporting!. This will be left to an external Quasar plugin. There's going to be such a plugin system for v1.0 (after v0.15) that will allow the community to make their own Quasar plugins. Stay tuned.. Icon sizing is done through font-size.. Already in v0.14. Closing this.. Thanks!. Good idea. Thanks for the PR!. Will take a look and merge it in the following days. Thanks for your efforts!. Use your PR, just had no time yet to look over it and test. Thought I'd drop you a message to let you know that your work will get in.. Thanks for your hard work!. Got inspired by it and used bits of code. I hope you don't mind by this. Finalized it with all necessary features.. Basically you can work this out with Vue's <transition-group>.\n<q-transition> is going to get removed at some point in the near future. Only made it because its default animation is only achievable with Velocity and not through CSS-only. So I wouldn't put too much dev time into this just to remove it later on.. Something got messed up within rollup, rollup-plugin-vue and Vue 2.1.5+ packages. Working on a solution.\nThis is NOT a fault with Quasar itself.. Released v0.10.3 (which is v0.10.2 repackaged). Please npm update to it (and also install Vue 2.1.6) and tell me if this issue persists. Thanks!. Will look into it. Thanks for reporting.. Please open up this issue and let's discuss what is needed on documentation repo: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org/issues\nThanks!. Thanks for the PR!.

Hi all,\n\nYou also need Vue 2.1.6.\nYou can't import just one of the components. Currently it's all or nothing.\n\n@brokenalarms Is 2. what you are looking for?. Hi all,\n\nYou also need Vue 2.1.6.\nYou can't import just one of the components. Currently it's all or nothing.\n\n@brokenalarms Is 2. what you are looking for?. @brokenalarms I believe the default template explains it in src/main.js:\njs\n// === DEFAULT / CUSTOM STYLE ===\n// WARNING! always comment out ONE of the two require() calls below.\n// 1. use next line to activate CUSTOM STYLE (./src/themes)\n// require(`./themes/app.${__THEME}.styl`)\n// 2. or, use next line to activate DEFAULT QUASAR STYLE\nrequire(`quasar/dist/quasar.${__THEME}.css`)\n// ==============================\n__THEME is replaced by the theme you make a build with. (quasar dev mat or quasar dev ios -- same for quasar build [theme]). @brokenalarms Quasar cannot be progressively added to a project. It's an all or nothing deal.\n\nIf you're not using a Quasar app template / boilerplate then yes, some of the files may appear as if they do not exist. But in the template they do.\nAll webpack rules are in the default app template.\n_THEME is a token that gets replaced by webpack (if you're using the default Quasar app template) so it's not even a variable.\n\nBottom line, sorry but you cannot cherry-pick components from Quasar. All Quasar code is written with performance in mind, and this sometimes leads to not being able to cherry-pick. There are a lot of reasons, most important one being that Quasar is not just a component library. It deals with much much more. Themeing assumes there are some CSS classes attached to the body. Cordova needs its own JS to be included and Quasar deals with starting a Cordova app with the help of Quasar.start() method. Reasons after reasons. Won't go into details as this would take me a day :). Not recommended, but here it is: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-linter-configuration.html (see remove linter section). Glad to be able to help!. Glad to be able to help!. Hi. Already fixed. Will be available in next Quasar version. See #220 . Hi. Already fixed. Will be available in next Quasar version. See #220 . Hmm, will look into it. Thx for reporting.. Safari iOS sux bad :) it's the new IE.. Please use forum or gitter for questions. Initialize that variable with an empty array.. There's no \"danger\" nor \"location\" icon. Closest to \"location\" is \"location_on\", \"location_off\" etc. Check list (like showing in documentation website) on https://material.io/icons/.

So please check again your model.. @pdanpdan Hmm, Vue devtools tries to show any props and computed props related to the selected component and as a result it forces Vue to compute all \"computed\" properties. In a non vue-devtool use-case, optModel doesn't gets to be computed because it's not used. I understand now. Patched edge version and this will be available in next Quasar version (v0.13) -- to be released really soon. Thank you so much for pursuing this!!. Hi, will investigate.. Hi, first of all thanks for investigating and even finding a solution. Current source map option was chosen because it is fastest.\nSince the issue is fixed in the canary build don't know if it's worth to sacrifice some speed for this because it would be temporary. Will document it however!\nMany thanks for handling this before me!. Reopening until we sort this out and find a final solution to work for all.. Thanks for the PR! Will check it out by the end of the week and merge it.. Hi,\nFirst of all thank you for taking time to contribute!!!\nI really hope you don't mind, but went with another approach: back to top as a directive.\nI hope this does not hinder you from making any further contributions. Our aim is to make the best in class components/directives.. Hi, Quasar doesn't uses Promises. Can you confirm that this is from Quasar's code indeed or is it from another library that you are using? Thanks!. Seems to be in Webpack's bundling code. Use es6-polyfill until I figure it out with guys over at Webpack.\nNpm install and require('es6-promise').polyfill() in main.js at the top.\nThanks!. Instructions on how to add the Promise polyfill will be available on the documentation website after v0.11 release.. Hi,\nI believe what you are searching for is justified CSS class that can be applied to <q-tabs> (Quasar v0.11 required). Lose the width in percentage as it won't work. Tabs use flexbox under the covers.\nPlease use forum for questions ;)\nCheers,\nRazvan. Yes, good idea. Will work on this. Thanks!. Will be available in v0.14. Hi,\nThis is more of a question for forum first. I can confirm everything works with the default template. Ionic apk deployment to a phone/tablet is a wrapper of cordova. So basically same command runs when deploying a Quasar app with cordova directly.\nWhat you can do is use remote debugging to find out what is causing your issue: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-wrapper.html#Remote-Debugging\nPlease reply with your findings (eventual error message). Thanks!. Will do. Thanks for filing this.. Thanks for reporting. Fixed it.. Yes, part of Internationalization #100 . Will soon be fixed..

You'll be credited with the fix as it is the right one to make. Thanks for reporting and also investigating!. Fix available in Quasar edge and future v0.12. Will do. Thanks for the suggestion.. @smolinari Scott, you heard what the people want. We must concede to this idea. Quasar tutorials/courses from you :D . Yep. The Action Sheet component itself uses a Modal that is configured in a specific way. It probably wouldn't hurt to just make a property or something to tell the Modal to act like an action sheet. Just to ease the configuration so you won't have to remember specific CSS for it. So will do.. A new \"position\" prop was added ('top', 'left', 'right', 'bottom'). Available in next Quasar version after v0.12 or in Quasar edge.. Giving up this idea. Adds too much overhead.. Will do. Thanks for the suggestion!. Will do.. Closing as it's ready in future v0.15.. @eliashdezr format() should return a string indeed but that string is no compiled with Vue. Instead, see \"Rendering with Component\" on http://quasar-framework.org/components/data-table.html#Formatting-a-Cell. Added @rowclick event which takes one parameter which is the selected row.\nAvailable in future v0.14.. @aprixon01112017 use a row scoped slot and add whatever native events you need ;). Dropping a short note: v1 makes these kind of problems non-existent.. Making good progress. This will include a lot of features for form components.. Will be available in v0.14.

Are you guys aware of https://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/2481/quasar-quasar-cli-v0-17-aka-ssr-developer-preview ?\nNuxt module will come after v0.17 release (which is days away), but I really don't see any need now for this, since you'll be able to use your current Quasar app and simply build a SSR with it through Quasar CLI :). Check out Quasar v0.17. I've just released it.. @smolinari These are some common misconceptions. Quasar does NOT use Nuxt under the hood, nor does it use Vue CLI.. Good job. Thanks for taking time for a PR!! This will go into v0.12.1.. Targeting v0.14 for forms.. edit: Deprecated. Please see next comment\nAll one need to do is to wrap the group of q-collapsible into a q-collapsible-accordion component.

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n    </div>\n  </q-collapsible>\n</q-collapsible-accordion>. Updated API to make usage even easier and have even lower footprint. If you want to group collapsibles to act as an accordion, just specify \"group\" attribute with a unique string (same string for all collapsibles that you want to group):\nhtml\n<q-collapsible group=\"somegroup\" icon=\"explore\" label=\"First\">...</q-collapsible>\n<q-collapsible group=\"somegroup\" icon=\"explore\" label=\"Second\">...</q-collapsible>\n<q-collapsible group=\"somegroup\" icon=\"explore\" label=\"Third\">...</q-collapsible>. There are a few advantages over the first version (with an extra component):\n\nLighter with lower footprint, faster (js execution-wise), no extra dummy component\nMore flexible:\nyou can leave out some collapsibles opened by not including them in the group\nyou can even make a group with collapsibles that are not siblings in DOM\nyou can make multiple groups within sibling collapsibles\nYou can use same group name for multiple collapsibles as long as the parent Vue component (not talking about DOM parent node) is not the same\nNo additional markup (like a DOM node) that should wrap a group of collapsibles\n\nI think the flexibility should be a key point when creating a framework and the flexibility offered by the first version superseeds the minimum HTML syntax overhead to specify an attribute for each collapsible. Can we agree on this one?. This needs careful thought. Will do some tests in the following days and merge it. Thanks for this PR!. The fix is more complex. Will merge this and make the necessary additions.. Thanks for reporting and making a PR for this!. Care for a PR to add \"backdropOpacity\" as a prop? It would speed up things..

Can't use placeholder along stacked label.\nhtml\n<div class=\"floating-label\">\n  <textarea required class=\"full-width\" placeholder=\"\u0423\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\"></textarea>\n  <label>\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435</label>\n</div> html. I will. Thanks.. Stacked label is not meant to be used with Dialog Select component. You got a lot of options built into the component itself (placeholder, label etc). Please read the docs.. It's on the works.. For reactive data use Select component instead.. It is supposed to have required prop. Otherwise CSS won't work. This is a CSS based solution for performance reasons and to avoid overhead of a component.. The example has the required prop there. Will probably put a notice too.. Don't quite get what you mean. Any screenshots pls?. Oh, yes. It tries to use the screen real estate as best as possible. This is not a bug.. It will improve ;). Who does touch those Chrome options? :)\nNot planning on fixing this. At least not soon.. This would be a nice addition for the \"scroll\" modifier. Thanks!. This will get done. I can assure you on that. Sorry it takes so long (the todo pile is huge).. Will be available starting with 0.15.0-beta.11, so closing this.. Hi,\nFor documentation please use the appropriate repo: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org/issues\nRedirecting bug there.\nBest way would be to use Quasar Play app though.\nWill also include this tip. Thanks!. Are you using edge or v0.12?. Fixed for v0.13 and in edge.. Redirecting issue to appropriate repo. Let's continue talk there. Thanks!. Check reference above :) will investigate this tomorrow.. Redirecting to appropiate repo: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues/17\nLet's continue the talk there. Thanks!. Ok, will fix it.. There's no quasar.win32.css file. Never was. Can you explain what exactly is that you did? What OS, NPM and node versions are you running, what commands you typed in the console etc. Thanks!. Also, what did you reinstall exactly?. No worries. If you can isolate this problem on the future feel free to contact me again. Thanks!. Hi, thanks for taking time for a PR. What exactly does this fix? Got an example/screenshot?. Awesome. Merged. Thx! Nice link too.. Hi,\nIt is parts of JS specs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes\nPolyfill already included in Quasar. Array.prototype.includes it's just how it is injected into Array.\nAnd optModel is not part of DataTable.\n\nWhat version of Quasar are you using?\nDo you have a repo I can take a look with instructions on how to reproduce?\n\nThanks!. Yeah, guess it even looks better without the text shadow. Merged. Thanks for taking time for a PR!. Feel free. Any contribution is most welcomed!\nPS: wished that you tweet this and mention @quasarframework and @vuejs so I can retweet :). Nice idea. Will see about it.. Hi,\nThe new QTable (introduced in v0.14 if I'm not mistaken) allows for total customization, so this can be done in app-space now.. Yes, I think we can add it to v0.14.. It's gonna get in soon. Was busy with other things but I think I can schedule this for a v0.17.x release.. Done for v1.0 -- QImg. Haven't yet got time to look at this, so sit tight before I merge it. Many thanks for taking time to contribute!!. This has been reworked and integrated into v0.14. Thank you for the PR!. Will investigate. Thanks for reporting.. Fixed in edge and next Quasar version (which most likely is v0.13.1).\n@Sopamo thank you for supplying with example code, it helps a lot.. Hi, Thanks for taking time for a PR! Got one question: how about handling beforeNext? I think user should be able to just go back step-wise but not forward to avoid issues. Also, this should be enabled with a flag (probably as a prop for Stepper). What do you think? (Oops, that's the second question :) ). Hi, thanking you again for taking time for a PR. v0.14 has a revamp of Stepper which has a different approach, more flexible and allows to do what this PR is intended to do among other things.. This is not an easy issue due to how Cordova and the keyboard interact. Will make a full description when I have some more time.. Fixed in future v0.14 as part of Layout changes.. You can add it by CSS in your app, but will see about it in Quasar directly. Thanks!. @smolinari Yep.. Pushed commit. Available in edge and next version after v0.13.\nAdded screenshot with Material theme. Using box-shadow. On iOS it's used a border instead of box-shadow to get in line with toolbars.\n\nThanks for submitting this issue. Comments?. Thanks for suggesting this. Enhancement available in edge and future v0.13.1. Use new boolean numeric prop for numeric format.. Hi, yes it can be made optional, but it's completely useless. Do you have a specific use-case for it?. @darrenahunter \nI have nothing against adding a prop for iOS as flag IF this is really useful. But what I'm saying is that due to how Safari works it renders the swipe feature useless. Instead of swiping to open Drawer, Safari goes back one page... It looks as if this is a bug in Quasar (which is not).\nYou can do a quick test. Take a look at https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/src/vue-components/drawer/Drawer.vue#L140 --> remove the ios from the if there then quasar dev on Quasar repo and use Safari on iOS on the Drawer dev page. You'll see what I mean.\nSo the way I see it at the moment is to also use a button to trigger Drawer opening (while user is still able to swipe on Drawer to close it). This way you won't have to deal with each platform separately.\nPlease correct me if I am wrong or if there is a better way to still enable swiping while not having the current buggy behavior in Safari.. Added horizontal-quick-view Boolean prop for GallerySlider.\nAvailable in future v0.14.. What I suggest is adding a special CSS class (that you write on your app) on the calendar binded on a computed value that takes into account calendar's model. Let me know if you need further details although I think this should be easy.. Hi, can you be more specific pls? Also include a screenshot and your layout code. Thx!. Please reopen with my requests. I see no issue with it. Thanks!. Will investigate it.. Ah, please upgrade to at least v0.13. You'll find that this issue is fixed.. Hi,\nIt's unclear to me what your issue is.\n1. Is it an issue with Quasar, an issue with the docs or just a discussion?\n2. Is the link above correct? It points to CSS preprocessors which have nothing to do with hr.\nWaiting for your reply.. Just use Tabs on the footer layout slot.. Hi,\nCan you provide more details? What phone are you using, what Android version. Is it a bug in Quasar Play app? Are you using Quasar Play app or are viewing the documentation examples in a phone browser?\nAre you using a layout of your own (in which case please copy-paste it here pls).\nThanks!. Android 4.4 and iOS 6 (lower versions have very low market share anyway).\nCan you tell me your phone's Android version is?. Fixed the layout \"moving\" today. Available in edge and future v0.13.2. Those mentioned earlier are not errors. They are part of first flexbox CSS version.. Can you test with the edge version to see if there is anything else to fix, pls?. @bboywulong is everything ok? can we close this?. Please reopen if you still experience the layout issue. Seems fixed to me in edge version.. @bboywulong like I said, the 3 CSS lines are needed to cover most browser versions. Don't worry if one of them has the \"attention\" mark on it. That means that the property is ignored. The 3 lines of CSS are standard and must always go together for the cross-browser support to be available.\nWhat I am asking is: do you experience the same issue of layout margins getting partially hidden? From my tests this is not the case anymore. Want your confirmation too so then I can release v0.13.2 with this and other fixes.. Hmm, will fix this. They should be of same height although this slipped out.. Please wait for the new Quasar version. This version enhances forms a lot. Your issue will be fixed in it. Simply go ahead and continue your work on your app and later this week you'll be able to upgrade to the new Quasar version and everything will work as expected.. Fixed in future v0.14. Yes, will do! Thanks for suggesting this.. Added @selection event which takes two parameters: number of rows selected and the actual rows that have been selected.\nAvailable in future v0.14.. Hi,\nThere are a bunch of Vue components that you can use for drag'n'drop. Please refer to https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/99\nIf you find a scenario where existing drag'n'drop Vue components don't fulfill a need, please report back. Thanks!. Hi,\nIt's definitely on your end. This feature has been tested over and over again. \nAlso, there's no boundFn() in whole Quasar code. Can you check your app code and see what exactly are you setting as value in the first place? You might have stored a function which got stringified at some point. Would be an idea to remove the key from LocalStorage and do another spin of tests.\nPlease reopen if Quasar is somewhere at fault. Thanks!. No problem. Glad it got solved!. Will do soon.. Closing as it's ready in future v0.15.. Hy guys, just letting you know I will join the discussion in a few days once I'm done working on current new features (form related).. @smolinari Why do you say they pull right?\nhttp://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase/layout/tabs. @laurentpayot About the drawer shadow. This was changed recently and I think it's a good improvement. This can be turned off with $drawer-box-shadow Stylus var set to none. There isn't any one-design-fits-all when dealing with layout. Some want content aligned to the left. Some want aligned to the right. Some want it centered. Some want drawer with no shadow, some want it with shadow. And to illustrate my point, take your suggestion and then https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/364\nTake @Sopamo's example (nice app btw): Can't possibly know what the page content will be. For a list, as an example, you'd have to set a max-length or something. What if instead of a list we have a picture gallery. So there's no one solution to fit all needs.\n@ all\nThe point here is to have flexibility to change layout according to your needs. It's the developer's responsibility to make the necessary updates as I can't capture ALL use-cases. Even if I could, the CSS and JS files footprint would increase a lot.\nIf on the other hand, there's something that can be improved to the \"standard/default/generic\" CSS that would benefit most use-cases then we have a go.. @Sopamo Great. Looking forward to your suggestions. Can we discuss them on the forum first, before opening new issues?. Try v0.15. It should work.\nBut it's obsolete anyway, since in v0.15 you can now develop with HMR and Cordova plugins directly in the emulator or on phone.. Hmm, good point here. Will do.. Done. config/index.js has a new variable for dev called \"clearConsoleOnRebuild\" which is by default set to false.. Yep. You're perfectly right. Totally missed that on the template update a few days ago when I added FriendlyErrorsPlugin.. Hi,\nThis is on the roadmap, along \"Import only components you need (+ tree-shaking)\".\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/projects/3 (Miscellaneous section). Yep. And it's very easy too. Will do it right after I finish up with the new forms work item.. Added. You're right.. Available in edge version and future v0.14.. extract-text-webpack-plugin should at least be ^2.0.0-beta.4. Referencing https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2764. Merged it but will make some adjustments. Thanks for this!. Search for \"Delimiter within Items\": http://quasar-framework.org/components/list.html\nhtml\n<div class=\"list item-delimiter\">\n  <div class=\"item\" v-for=\"n in 3\">\n    <div class=\"item-content\">\n      List Item\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>. v-link in your case calls $router.push()... so it's the same thing. Please reopen with a more detailed case. Thanks!. @oswaldomilet v-link adds a 'click' event listener and does a $router.push(). This is what I mean. https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/src/vue-directives/link.js#L19-L28\nDo you have a repo I can take a look at?. Also, use <router-link> for your case. It's faster & more efficient.. Can you create a repo so I can reproduce pls? Simple, barebone one. I am very interested to see what's going on with Vue router. I think it's good we do a Vue router PR on this. But I can't reproduce. So help?. Check top of /src/main.js (which is the entry point of your app):\njs\n// === DEFAULT / CUSTOM STYLE ===\n// WARNING! always comment out ONE of the two require() calls below.\n// 1. use next line to activate CUSTOM STYLE (./src/themes)\n// require(`./themes/app.${__THEME}.styl`)\n// 2. or, use next line to activate DEFAULT QUASAR STYLE\nrequire(`quasar/dist/quasar.${__THEME}.css`)\n// ==============================\nYou need to uncomment 1. and comment 2.. Also for reference: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-theming.html#Build. Will add a field for this very son. I think there's another issue raised on this as well. Will close it if it's duplicate.\nUntil the new field is available just v-if your grid and display a loading message or something.. Closing as it's ready in future v0.15.. Pushed patch on the doc site. Will be visible for next Quasar version. Thanks for reporting this!. Will investigate. Thanks for reporting!. Available in edge and future v0.13.2. Will do. Thanks.. On v0.14 you'll be able to supply a custom matching handler function.. In v0.14 beta.. Guess you are right, but will leave it for a few months more. Probably put a notice that it's only required for old devices. Thanks for this!. Will investigate and fix. You are probably working with multiple selection so your model is an array. Computed props are not deep watchers.\nWorkaround would be to make a deep watcher yourself on the scope variable used for v-model on Select.. Yes. Any rerender will emit @input then :) place a watcher in your app code like I mentioned until I got time to fix this.. Fix available in future v0.14.. Please wait for the new Quasar version. This version enhances forms a lot. Your issue will be fixed in it. Simply go ahead and continue your work on your app and later this week you'll be able to upgrade to the new Quasar version and everything will work as expected.. Closing this as it's kind of duplicate for #374 . Will do. Thanks for pointing this out.. Any ideas how to highlight checkoxes, radios and toggles? From a design perspective. For both themes.. Thanks for the tips!. Will be available in v0.14. Will improve this as soon as I finish up with forms. Thanks for this!. @zuck I love it. Thanks a lot for this!

My sketch below shows an example but I don't quite like it.\n \"Close\" the spinning spikes with a thin line (with the lighter color).\n* Use multiple colors (same as Google logo color palette)\nThe gradient is also nice. I wonder how it would look like with Google logo color palette or with Vue's colors.\nWould it be better for the center to use the darker color (of the two currently used) instead of plain black?\nI'm not much of a designer, so just throwing ideas. Made a sketch for the \"close the spinning spikes with a thin line\". Please forgive the quality, it's made in GIMP by hand :)\n\n. @zuck \nI simply love the last two examples.

You can make use of the color Vue prop for Knob. http://quasar-framework.org/components/knob.html#Vue-Properties\nBut you need to specify it in hexa/rgb/etc, not as \"primary\" or \"secondary\" etc so NOT a color from Quasar palette.. Will see about this. It's not so easy though and I'm currently overloaded.. Didn't make it the primary one, but it now by default inherits the CSS \"color\" prop. Some examples:\nhtml\n<q-knob style=\"color: red\" .... />\n<q-knob color=\"red\" ... />\n<q-knob class=\"text-primary\" ... />\nWill be available in v0.14. Hi,\nI think you're talking about v-model being undefined, right?\nIn such case, what's the use of any form component if you can't control it (don't make any scope variable binded to it)?\nI tend to make all components as lightest as possible to maintain runtime performance. Adding additional logic to handle this case would decrease perf a little, but it counts when you got lot of form components on a page and running on a mobile phone.\nI would only add this if there is a solid case for it. Won't add it just to make scaffolding easier. Please explain your case.. Please reopen with solid case. Thanks!. Hi,\nCase 1. Not receiving enough data from server.\nWhen you receive data, initialize your scope ($data) with the correct data, meaning put a boolean prop there if it's missing from the server response. It's a bit more work to do, but it's the right way to do it as it guarantees your app is in a healthy state.\nCase 2. Data not yet loaded.\nYou should NOT display any UI part to the user if it's not ready. Use spinners or Loading components to show user something is happening under the covers (ajax requests etc) and combine with v-ifs. Vue Router's documentation also offers a nice alternative in its guide (https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/data-fetching.html).\n\nDisplaying an unusable toggle (or any other form component for this matter) is not something any user would expect. I hope you agree.\nCheers,\nRazvan. Hi,\nDisplaying a Range with no actual range of values makes no sense. Guard it with a v-if to only display it if you have items to show.\nCheers,\nRazvan. @awesomektvn Hi, why closing this?. Possible with v0.14. Check beta.. Good catch. Will fix it and include in v0.13.2.. Available in edge version and future v0.13.2. No longer relevant in v0.14. Tabs have been greatly improved and don't use Vue refs anymore.. Already fixed in future v0.13.2 or edge version. Can you confirm with edge version? http://quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-nightly-build.html. http://beta.quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase\nhttp://beta.quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/apple/index.html#/showcase. Yes, q-transition is supported only for one element (uses Vue transition component under the covers). Either wrap your elements with a new dom element or use Vue's transition-group by writing your own transition.. I guess you are right. Will enhance the animation itself too. Thanks for this!. Good idea.. Pushed a commit to add disable for checkboxes and toggles too.. There's going to be a \"q-input\" component in v0.14, indeed. Will think about your case. A workaround for you is to write a CSS class to overwrite font declaration prop on <i> tags and apply it to the medium editor container.. Google Material Icon font page also uses the <i> tag (https://material.io/icons/#ic_account_balance check \"Use Icon in Your Site\" with font). Fontawesome too. That's just two examples. Not sure about if a breaking change should be introduced or not. Rather, a CSS class like I mentioned earlier would suffice. Will ponder on this more.. Fixed in future v0.14.. Fixed in future v0.14..

Thinking of also adding an \"animation\" prop so it will jump from one slide to another like a carousel.. Yes, exactly. Meant autoplay. Works beautifully with your work. Thanks again! Will release this tomorrow.. Damn, totally forgot about it. Wanted to do it for Gallery too. Will push a commit today or tomorrow. Thanks for pointing this out!. The fix is more complex to catch slots number changing so took the liberty to make some additions. My first try was to use a computed property on $slots too, but $slots is not reactive, so it does not update the slides number value when it should.\nThanks for this one and for highlighting the issue!. Hi, this has just been fixed a few minutes ago in edge version. Thanks for submitting this!. Because of Crosswalk, which will become obsolete quite soon. Crosswalk is used for compatibility with older Android versions. If you don't care about Android 4.X, then skip Crosswalk and your apk will be comparable to framework7's.. Yeah :)))) Upgrade to v0.13.6. Just released it.. Thanks for thinking of creating a PR, though!. Hi, please follow the issue template that gets injected when creating an issue. In your case, also supply more details. Where do you use the code you code-pasted, how do you structure routes, etc etc..... @AhsanAbrar no problem. I'm glad you figured it out!. Happens from time to time. This is an issue with NPM servers... They just need to fix their server problem. Might work in an hour up to a day-two... Got no way to avoid this when it happens. Quasar is relying on NPM infrastructure.... It usually gets fixed in a day or so. Will try to contact them. This is not a problem with Quasar specifically. Can be with any package. Read the github page of Material Icons.. it's one similar issue reported there with A LOT of people complaining :(. Because it was implemented for v1.0.. Fixed in future v0.14.. Will do.. Hi,\nThis is really tricky to make it work across browsers. Removing document.body.click() will leave other popovers opened, so it's not an option, or at least not in this form. I think the solution is around your second approach, but got to ponder on this very good. Unfortunately, this won't happen so soon as the workload is huge at the moment.. Nested Popovers are not supported. Can't accommodate all its features with this, and still make it work for the buggy webview in iOS platform. Sorry for any inconvenience.. Fixed in future v0.14.. Hi, v0.13.x has nothing to do with v0.14. Wait for the v0.14 release to see this fix. Thank you!. Available in future v0.14.. Hi, Closing this as v0.15 now has an extra component (QDialog) with which you can tweak the content to your specific needs.. Fixed. Available in future v0.14.\nAlso added an \"abort()\" method.. Will do.. This is NOT a issue. v-model is supposed to work to be able to set the visibility state on large windows only. It is working as expected.. @laurentpayot \nThere are two separate states for the siderbar panels:\n One, which keeps the window width breakpoint into account and shows/hides the panels when threshold is below/above. This behavior is automatic, until:\n The second state is when the user specifically says: look, I want this panel out of the way, even if above threshold. This overrides the threshold and makes it always \"hidden\" or \"visible\", based on this state -- and we're using v-model for this state.\nPlease tell me if you need further information or I haven't explained clear enough.. It may look obvious, but it's not. Will comment more when I get back from my vacation.. Already in latest v0.14. Just forgot to close this.. Hi, let's continue this on forum. Thanks!. Will look into it. Thanks for reporting.. Submitted issue and PR to Vue for this: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5321 and https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5322. Hi,\nCongrats on the PR. Made some small changes and merged. Available in edge version and future v0.14.\nThanks!. Hi,\nThanks for this. Available in edge version and future v0.14.. Hi,\nThanks for taking time for PR(s)! This is available in edge version and future v0.14.. Hi,\nSaw the forum thread and was about to make the necessary changes. Thanks for specifying the document location URL for a Chrome Extension, made my life a little bit easier :)\nPushed commit to add the right support. Available in edge version and future v0.14.\nBesides fixing this issue, you can now also detect if code is running as chrome extension by looking at Platform.is.chromeExt.\nThanks!. @mbouclas let me know if you find any other problems when running as Chrome extension. It's completely untested in such environment, but other than this issue here (pushed commit earlier) there shouldn't be any other problems.. Please use edge version (http://quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-nightly-build.html) until v0.14 is released. Looking forward to your findings!. Future v0.14 adds the ability to use multiple font icons, so not only Material like now.. Nope, not on nightly (edge). Only on v0.14 which is currently not ready for an alpha/beta release.\nExamples:\nIonicon: <q-icon name=\"ion-arrow-down-a\" />\nMaterial: <q-icon name=\"alarm\" />\nFontawesome: <q-icon name=\"fa-bath\" />\nSpecific icons for each Quasar theme: <q-icon mat=\"cloud\" ios=\"fa-bath\" /> (renders different icon when built with each theme). @mbouclas You can use <img src=\"/statics/icon.svg\"> instead. Icon component will only work with font files for consistency and design predictability.. Will see about this. I have the feeling there is already an issue posted on this.. Found it. Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/395. Hi,\nThank you for your kind words. Stay tuned for next release (v0.14) ;)\nAs long as there are good libraries out there like Vuelidate, Quasar will never handle validations with its own engine because it would only mean reinventing the wheel. So, in this case, please fully adhere to Vuelidate's way of validating forms, which means importing the required rule and assigning it to the model.\nCheers,\nRazvan. Hi, will investigate. Thanks for reporting.. Pushed fix. Available in edge version and future v0.14.. In v0.14. Check beta. Momentjs removed completely.. Thanks for this! Available in edge.. Thanks for this!. Available in edge.. Hi,\nIt's a good idea.\nCreated Quasar template repo for this: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-express\nAre you willing to be its maintainer? Meaning to port changes from the default Quasar template whenever they occur? Full read/write permissions have been added for you on the newly created repo.\nIf we have a go, I welcome you to the Quasar team! Contact me on Gitter to get us started with this.\nCheers,\nRazvan. @claustres @smolinari This is good constructive talk.\nWhat would you say about making a Quasar wrapper for this, instead of a template? This means it can be added later on if one decides to create a backend api endpoint server too. A wrapper is the equivalent of the proposed quasar init my-app --add-backend --express. The wrapper should create a /api (or /backend or /server) folder containing everything related to the backend API. Let's focus on what this folder contains at first, then we'll add the necessary logic to the CLI to handle this wrapper. If we can all agree I can go ahead and change the name of the repo from quasar-template-express to express-wrapper (and later a featherjs-wrapper and/or graphql-wrapper). Push directly to this repo, no need for PR. Before we release it I'll take a look then make it official. I'd love to see this work integrated.\nWe should have some kind of structure based on routes.\nLooking forward to hear your thoughts.. New usage:\njs\nimport { AddressbarColor } from 'quasar'\nAddressbarColor.set() // sets primary color\nAddressbarColor.set('#b023fe')\nAddressbar color is only injected if platform supports it.\n. Thanks for this!. Available in edge version and future v0.14.. This should be implemented in app-space. There's no golden design for this to fit any scenario possible. Every developer should write this functionality to best suite his/her needs.... @wilcorrea can you try with v0.13.6 again pls?. Please reopen if it seems like something's wrong.. Hi,\nI think this is obsolete now since Quasar v0.15 has been released. It allows for HMR (along with cordova plugins!) directly in the emulator or on a real phone -- no longer needing Quasar Play app.. Use can use them through bg-[color] or text-[color] CSS classes, or you can import Quasar Stylus definition files by adding the following code to your \"style\" tag in *.vue files (at the top):\n@require '~quasar-framework/src/themes/quasar.core.variables.styl'. Yes, right. Editing.. Option 1. Initialize datatable data with empty array by default in your component. After fetching data replace empty array with real data.\nOption 2. It's a general rule of thumb to not display parts of UI that are not ready yet to be consumed by the user. Display a spinner or a message or something indicating data is being fetched instead. Put a v-if on datatable so that it doesn't gets rendered if no data is yet available.. Hi, please use forum for questions. Currently working on v0.14 which will make Quasar tree shakable, so smaller size. You can take a look at the progress here: http://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/253/future-v0-14-feature-list. http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-wrapper.html#Cordova-Plugins. Will do.. Datatable revamp has this feature request. Very easy and clean to use. You will like it :)\nClosing this issue. Available in future v0.15. vue init quasarframework/quasar-template-default <folder-name>\nBUT, you are seriously undermining what Quasar and its CLI is and can do. Please check the Quasar CLI commands list. Highlighting especially the list, dev (with it QR option), build, wrap, serve and version commands.\nThe power of Quasar's CLI will become even more obvious with the release of more wrappers and starter kits (in the very near future). Also, Quasar is not just a Vue template and a collection of components. It does a lot more. Most important one being: imagine the exact same code can run as website, Cordova app and Electron app. This Github ticket seriously makes me think even more of raising the awareness of what Quasar is and can offer in a more clear and obvious way through tutorials and articles.\n``` bash\n20:13 $ quasar\n\n__  \\  _ _ _ _\n  /  / \\  \\|  |  __  \\  /  /_  \\_   \\\n /   _/.  \\  |  //  __ \\  /  \\|  | \\/\n __\\ _//(_  /  >(_  /|\n        _>          \\/     \\/      \\/\nUsage: quasar  [options]\nCommands:\ninit [ap] <folder>     create Quasar App\nlist                   list available app templates\nnew <template> <name>  generate .vue from app Component templates\ndev [theme] [options]  run dev server\nbuild [theme]          build production app\nclean                  clean production build artifacts\ntest                   run unit and/or e2e tests\nlint                   lint source code\nwrap [type]            wrap app (currently only with \"cordova\" type)\nserve [folder]         create live reload static-content server\nversion                output CLI and current app Quasar version\nhelp [cmd]             display help for [cmd]\n\nOptions:\n-h, --help  output usage information\n\n```\nHistorically speaking (but not as argument as to why you should use the CLI, so just for informational purposes), Quasar had its own CLI long before Vue. Same for routing, and many more.. The standalone version is coming up so devs can add Quasar to their already working project.. Fixed in edge and future v0.14.. Can you provide a reproduction repo with the isolated problem, please? Just to eliminate any confusion on my or your part.. Will take a look today or in max 1-2 days. Sorry for the delay.. Yes, this is due to how Vue detects changes. Will get fixed.. Hmm, seems like I didn't port the fix to v0.13 branch. Sorry.\nEdge now has the fix.. I'll put this on my todo list. I'm interested into why the patch doesn't catch this particular scenario too. Thanks for sharing the details!. @Goopil It's because you're setting getter/setter on taskList, then use taskList.name as model. It's taskList.name that changes, not taskList, so your set() doesn't gets called.. Will do. Only thing is that it makes Quasar components templates harder to reason about. Care for a PR on v0.14 branch?. Yes. QIcon supports that.. Pushed commit for this. Available in future v0.14.. Seems like by using the numeric character references the icons don't display right on desktop Chrome (just an example).

You even get the warning when building:\n```\n Build complete with \"mat\" theme in \"/dist\" folder.\nBuilt files are meant to be served over an HTTP server.\n Opening index.html over file:// won't work.\n```\nThis is normal. \"file://\" protocol is not the same as \"http://\" or \"https://\". Every protocol has its security restrictions and way of working. Serve in a web server, or if you are building a cordova app use Quasar Play or build your app and run it on a mobile.. \"This branch has conflicts that must be resolved\". Needs a redo :(. There's nothing stopping you from using an <iframe> tag in any place of your app.... 1. Having a linter is highly recommended as it makes code more readable and also makes you as a developer avoid certain mistakes.\n2. Linting on save has to do with developer's editor of choice, and not with the framework itself.\n3. Linting can be disabled if for some reason the developer thinks it gets in the way. But I recommend having a linter in place. Makes you more organized. How to disable it though: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-linter-configuration.html. 24 hour format will be available (although in a slightly different manner than these screenshots) in v0.14.. @Hoagiex Hi, couple of things:\n\nThese features will be added right after v0.14.\nIf you are a developer working for a companies' apps, please help support Quasar (https://www.patreon.com/quasarframework).

Hi, I would gladly investigate this for v0.13, but the lack of time and v0.14 release date is pressuring me. v0.14 has flawless implementation in all components using routes though. Working hard to release v0.14.

This has been reworked in v0.14, so it's no longer relevant. All components using routes will work the same way router-link does.. @christosf Hi, you can read all about it here: http://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/253/future-v0-14-feature-list. Floating label will be completely replaced by QInput component in v0.14, so this is obsolete. Thanks for filing this, though!. Hey, I'd prefer keeping the current examples for testing purposes. The real examples will be part of Quasar Play, so that's where we can do something styling on what we show as demo..

The complete solution is:\njs\nshell.rm('-rf', path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist/*'))\nshell.rm('-rf', path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist/.*'))\n-Razvan. Available in v0.13.9 (just released it). Thanks for filing this.. Actually I saw this 4 minutes ago, otherwise it would have been even faster :). Hi, this is a ticket for https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-default repo and not Quasar repo itself, so will close it here.\nv2 (must have been released a few days ago) contains breaking changes (by semver convention), so it can't work by default with current configuration. The default Quasar template is regularly updated to use latest and greatest, so no thing to worry about.\nWhat you can do to speed things up (as I'm overloaded on v0.14 work) is to investigate and apply the changes in a PR pls? Otherwise it will take some time as this is not a \"must do\" in the Quasar todo queue.\nThanks!. Alerts will be available in v0.14. These, as opposed to Toasts, must be dismissed by the user.. Deployed latest doc.. Not ignoring this, but currently no time for it. Help is appreciated.\nA revamp of DataTable will be first thing after v0.14, with lots of new features including this one and server-side management.. Thanks!. Hi,\n\nPlease use appropriate repo for reporting issues, in this case the Quasar CLI repo.\n\nRead Note for Windows Developers: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-wrapper.html#Wrap-your-App. Hi,\n\n\nI ran your project but could not reproduce. Routes change successfully.\n\nSeems like a package you are importing is throwing an error on your mobile, thus route change is halting (common Vue-Router behavior). My guess is that it's rxdb is at fault, so you might want to open up a ticket on their website.\n\nEither way (a fault in Vue-Router or most likely a package you are importing), Quasar is not at fault.\nWish I could help more, but I am on a tight schedule for v0.14.\nRegards,\nRazvan. @lyquocnam Posted a message on that thread. Seems like they don't transpile their npm distributable, which is not the expected behavior when the package is used in a Webpack environment. Let's see what they say.. Until rxdb figures it out, you can add an exception for running babel on rxdb too. Change /build/webpack.conf.js:\njs\n{\n        test: /\\.js$/,\n        loader: 'babel-loader',\n        include: projectRoot,\n        exclude: /node_modules/ <<<<<<<<\n      },\n/node_modules/ should be /node_modules(?!\\/rxdb)/ for you.. Opened https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss/issues/159\nWaiting for an answer so I can take a decision.\nPlease be polite and don't use expressions like \"or else\".\nThanks,\nRazvan. Temporarily removed PurifyCSS from the build process until they release a new npm version with the fix.. The maintainer of PurifyCSS just released a new version which fixes the problem, so brought back PurifyCSS into the starter kit. Thanks for your patience!. Manually adding it is good. This issue is obsolete now that v0.14 is around the corner. You won't have same problem with v0.14.\nThanks for reporting though!. Hi, this needs careful considerations. Please allow 1-2 days before merging. Thank you!. Very good PR! Thanks!. @pdanpdan Merged. Thank you! Can you contact me by email pls? Got a proposal for you.. Hi, Can you rephrase that please. Not sure what you want added. Thanks!. A revamp of DataTable is scheduled soon, and it will allow a whole lot more customization, including your request. I ask of you to be patient. Thanks.. Closing this as code is ready in future v0.15 datatable revamp.. Hi, Use exact so it won't match every sub-routes.. @jeimz143 How did you use 'exact'?. @matthewpull I've documented a little about Indexeddb. Seems like pretty straightforward and not really needing a wrapper. What would be the benefit of a wrapper and how do you see such a wrapper being used?\nIf we get past the first question then let's move on to second question and build the API specifications for Quasar Indexeddb wrapper together with the community.. @rhyek Oh but Quasar's wrapper has its benefits. It's not just syntactic sugar. It is often an overlooked fact that Quasar's web storage wrapper maintains the type of data you put into it (including regexp), while vanilla flavor works only with Strings.\nRegarding the other libraries out there, it's again overlooked the fact that importing whole libraries for small parts of their functionality can turn your bundle in multiple MB faster than you can think. Not saying you should use only Quasar's functionality, far from it. Just making a point that more often than it should people import lots of packages without considering the consequences. I saw people importing jQuery only for setting a scroll position on a div. It's absurd. Use other libraries too, but use them wisely :)\nJust my thoughts.. I'm sorry but I'm going to close this one. Quasar may have an Indexeddb wrapper at some point, but it's out of reach at the moment.. Fixed in future v0.14 which is around the corner. Thanks for reporting.. Hi, can you make this PR for dev branch pls? Thank you and good work!. Closed per https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/pull/596 solves this for the right branch.. Hi,\nThe concept of a checkbox is to be able to handle 2 states: checked and unchecked, so a boolean is the default choice as model for it.\nIn future v0.14 however there's already a val attribute which when used, transforms the checkbox's model into an array. For example you can have N checkboxes binded to the same model:\nhtml\n<q-checkbox v-model=\"myModel\" val=\"John\" />\n<q-checkbox v-model=\"myModel\" val=\"Jack\" />\n<q-checkbox v-model=\"myModel\" val=\"Jim\" />\nIf user checks first two, the model will be ['John', 'Jack']. If it unchecks first, then ['Jack']. If it unchecks all, then model is an empty [].\nI think that this is what you are looking. Gonna close the issue but feel free to reopen if I missed something.\nThanks for reporting this so others can see it too.. Hi, what exactly are you looking for? Be more specific please.. I see now. What you can do is when you retrieve data use JS .map() to store options in the requested format.\njs\nlet options = selectOptions.map(opt => ({label: opt.comp_name, value: opt.comp_id})). @Dmedip use a Vue computed property. @Dmedip Use a Vue computed property... :|\njs\ncomputed: {\n  selectOptions () {\n     return [ { label: this.myLabel, value: this.myLabelValue }, ... ]\n  }\n}. Hi,\nYes, this was available some time ago until the switch to Vue 2.0. It got removed due to some issues with the router but it's on the roadmap to bring it back again.\nClosing bug since the default template repo would be more appropriate for this and is duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-default/issues/4.\nThanks for the kind words and stay tuned for updates!\nCheers,\nRazvan. Not yet, sorry.. Hi, let's find a better name for this prop and merge the PR. \"custom-value\" is a little bit confusing. Anyone got any ideas?. Awesome! Thanks.. Ah, dammit. Wanted to take care of this, but seems like you did a pull and this PR now contains a lot of extra commits of my own.. Ah, dammit. Wanted to take care of this, but seems like you did a pull and this PR now contains a lot of extra commits of my own.. Thank you so much for your hard work!. Hi, this is obsolete now. Tabs have been completely reworked in v0.14.. I just noticed... you are using v-for on <q-tabs> and NOT on <q-tab>.... Thanks!. Hey, did you test it? :)\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/commit/80250d6f9668c1e15ef2d0066f30eb3926fc91b2. Always test before submitting pls. Had to push a commit to fix the second staticData reference :) See this link: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/commit/80250d6f9668c1e15ef2d0066f30eb3926fc91b2. Hi, \nFirst, thank you for contributing!\nThe reason for the current staticData structure is to allow developer to search in a specific prop of the data, which is to enrich the experience. You are now able to display a label (label prop), autocomplete with a value (value prop), and search on another prop (current \"field\") to return suggestions.\nWhy removing the current \"field\"?. Ah, I see. Already merged first one. Thanks a lot for your contributions, Benoit!. Ok, this means we can close this since I merged the other version, right?. Good PR. Allow me some days to test it out too. Thanks!. Hi, Yes, all types will be available in v0.14.. Nice!. Good idea. Merged.\nThanks for your first PR and hope more to come!\nCheers,\nRazvan. Good PR. Allow me some days to test it out too. Thanks!. Hi,\nQPopover works as to be triggered by the immediate DOM node encapsulating it (whichever that is). In your case, it's the entire list item. It makes sense if you think a little about it. How would the Popover (which can be applied to any DOM node or component) know which item of the list is its \"target\"?\nTo have more control over where the Popover to be triggered, use the HTML syntax version of list alone instead of the Vue component.\nExample:\n```html\n\n\nList item\n\n\n\n         more_vert\n         ...\n\n\n\n````. Nice PR! Thanks!. Very good catch!. I'm sorry but due to the lack of interest in this from multiple people and also from very low resources available, I'm going to close this.. Hi,\nThanks for filing this issue and also supplying a fix! In v0.14 the Layout has been rewritten from scratch using a completely different approach (syntax is 90% same though) so this is obsolete for it. Do you need this in v0.13 branch?\nCheers,\nRazvan. You won't be needing the extra CSS in v0.14.\nOk, closing this issue now as it's obsolete in respect to v0.14, like I said.\nThanks.. Hi, don't really have time to look into it now. The .gitignore additions seem fine to me. Do we need anything else?. @kasp1 do we really need this change? I see that @dhax has a point and most repos on github simply specify .DS_store instead of **/.DS_store (same for .Thumbs.db). I don't own a Mac to test it out though.. Ok, it's been already merged. Thanks for the confirmation.. I believe that the grow doesn't quite makes sense to work with xs-, sm- etc prefixes. Not saying this isn't right, but also trying to keep the CSS footprint as low as possible. After the \"Design Helpers > CSS flexbox\" docs section will be written it will be more clear on what I mean.. html\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">...</div> <!-- could use col-6 too -->\n  <div class=\"col\">...</div> <!-- could use col-6 too -->\n</div>\nBy default rows are now \"wrapping content\". So you can define col-*-12 to make it spread whole width and next cols will go to next line.\nhtml\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">...</div> <!-- could use col-6 too -->\n  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">...</div> <!-- could use col-6 too -->\n</div>\nCheck path #/css/grid-rows on Quasar repo dev server for all it can do. Play with the width of window.. You could also use:\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-auto\">...</div>\n  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col\">...</div>\n</div>\nThis makes each child div spread full width on smaller than sm devices and on sm+ first div has auto width while the second div will spread full width.\nSo basically you can achieve same \"effect\" without col-grow. One big concern is CSS footprint too. Adding this PR will increase it by tens of kb.. Also check \"Variable width content\" on the Q dev server page I mentioned.. Yes, but like I said, you don't really need it.... Hi,\njs\n// main.js\nQuasar.start(() => {\n   // cordova's device ready has been triggered already here,\n   // where Vue gets instantiated on #app\n})\ncordova as a global is supplied by default. I will do a patch and inject cordova global into Vue's prototype so you can use it like this.$cordova too if it would make more sense.\nWhat platform are you running cordova on? Android, iOS or Windows Platform?. I don't see much value in the wrapper. Take a look at vue-cordova source code for example. Very very basic stuff.\nIn Quasar you can directly access cordova global. Making a wrapper so that you can type this.$cordova is just extra syntactic sugar with more characters than simply writing cordova.<whatever>.\nWill create the simple wrapper though for the plugins (take a look at vue-cordova source code again... very very basic stuff).\nBtw, you can use Utils.openURL() instead of loading InAppBrowser cordova plugin. Has same effect.\nCan you point me to your repo? I'm interested how you get that assets error.\nThanks.. App starts with Quasar.start() which injects cordova.js (supplied by Cordova's assets folder) into DOM and listens for deviceready event. Then calls the callback supplied, which also instantiates Vue into <div id=\"app\">. As a result, all Vue components in your app already have the deviceready event triggered by the time they get mounted. No need to check for deviceready in order to use cordova's global.\nSo in other words:\n``js\n// Quasar.start(callback)\n// --> when Quasar callscallback` it ensures deviceready has been previously triggered\nQuasar.start(() => {\n   // loaded cordova,\n   // deviceready has been triggered\n   new Vue({el: '#q-app', ......})\n})\n```\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/v0.13/src/start.js\nInjecting cordova.js creates the global cordova object on its own..

But this is due to performance reasons.. I just tested it again and it works. Are you sure you are using v0.14? A repo I can take a look?. Please reopen if you used the v0.14 beta starter kit (quasar init default#beta <folder>) or ported the minimal required changes to your current project folder and it still does not works.\nI am very confident when I say this works, but please reopen if I missed something. Thanks!. PR merged. Thanks! Looking forward to docs update.. Nice job! Advertised it a little on Twitter because it deserves it. Keep in touch!. Nope. This will still be in.. Work on this has already begun.\nThis will probably go into 0.15.10\nBut please note it's easy to make this effect in app-space yourselves with 0.15.. Going into 0.15.11. @Zyles https://quasar-framework.org/components/layout-drawer.html#Mini-mode. Yes, it will be fixed. Just got a huge pile of todos at the moment. Just disable PurifyCSS for the moment.. No longer an issue in v0.15 datatable revamp.. I think this has been fixed in v0.15.. Thanks for reporting. It is fixed now.. Both are in Quasar v0.14.\nhttp://beta.quasar-framework.org/.

To get the version of Quasar you are currently running on, use the CLI:quasar version. Also, there's no Utils import anymore. Instead import the utils method you want, eg.import { date } from 'quasar'`.. I think you are either using the wrong template or upgrading from an older template and something is missing. If the latter, please use forum for help.\nBut, please reopen this if you've used quasar init default#beta and it still happens (I doubt that 99,99%).. Hi,\nI see this is your first PR on Quasar and I want to encourage you to continue on, but won't merge this one. Trying to get as close as possible to Material recommendations so that's why paddings were changed. Setting colors also is a much too trivial thing and won't add props for it just everywhere (also trying to keep footprint as low as possible).\nLooking forward to your next contributions though! The PR code looks good!\n-Razvan. Got a few questions:\n\nAre you taking into account semver notation for the packages you are upgrading? Some may have breaking changes.\nWhat packages have been upgraded, and from what version to what version?\nAre you sure you need an update for some packages? The common rule is to use Quasar's template to figure out when it's safe to upgrade some packages like ESLint for example, who keeps releasing breaking changes. If \"npm update\" updates a package, then it's fine, but if you modify package.json to get a newer ESLint, then you as a developer are on your own to figure out breaking changes and whatnot.\n\nAlso, why would you have to import Quasar like that? It makes me think the template you are using has been wrongfully altered. 'quasar' should be a Webpack alias to 'quasar-framework' npm package. How can an update break this... it doesn't...\nIf the above still don't make sense to you, please reopen with a detailed case. It helps in investigating. What version have you used previously and to which versions have you upgraded.\nAlso remember about semver notation when manually updating to a newer npm package.. @murbanowicz I need those questions answered. Last time I looked into your repo everything was working fine, except your imports that needed correction (from \"src\" to the recommended way of importing).. Compare https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-default/blob/beta/template/package.json to your package.json.\nI also noticed some npm 5 bugs when updating or installing new packages. The fix was to delete node_modules and npm install again... Just saying :).

Hi, I'm sorry but I am going to close this one as the resources currently do not allow to add a new theme to Quasar. @smolinari's suggestion is really great and will make everything possible to make it happen..

Ok, now waiting for the PR to get into an official Vue release and then v0.14.5 will use this new functionality.. @Zyles Vue up to 2.3.4 is safe from this warning. Please check if you indeed use Vue 2.3.3.. @syntacticsolutions Please upgrade to latest Vue.. Somewhere between 1st and 10th of next month. But the beta is pretty stable, you can start using it right away.\nPlease use forum like indicated.. I'm a little confused. You are using inset separator on list component.. if you don't want it don't specify the inset separator prop. Please reopen if I am missing something pls. . I'd avoid adding a new color to the CSS just for this one. Will think of some way to make this happen though.. @mesqueeb Does this reproduce if you install https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine ?. Tested myself. It works. Will add this to the docs. Closing.. This is purely an NPM issue. Please file an issue for NPM itself.\nMight be a lazy npm server.. You might want to change the npm server that you are using..

You need to make a first build of your app ($ quasar build) before running that command.. Available in edge and future v0.14.7 through the \"attributes\" prop.. This is a problem only with dev tools emulator.\nNot reproducible on a real device or with v0.14 on real device or emulator.. Please read all Layout doc pages (it also tells you how to route pages and so on), do a quasar init and notice the order of includes in main.js.\nIf you still think something is wrong, please help us work faster on the issue by providing a quick barebones repo with the isolated problem and reopening this. Thanks. Are you using Crosswalk Cordova plugin? If so, remove it and report back. Thanks.. Browser quirks. Will try to fix it with a workaround.. Will fix it. Thanks for reporting.. V-model works only to tell Layout to show one or the other side when on a large window (above the threahold). This differs from the show/hide methods which do not take into account window size.. There is a bug in Vue 2.4.x which is being worked on. Downgrade to Vue 2.3 in the mean time.\nMore info here (including vue bug link): https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/710.

Make sure you read its doc page top bottom, have looked at the demo and its source, and if you still think something is wrong, please provide template and script with which you are using it. Thanks!. Thanks for taking time for a PR!. Use \"quasar serve\". Distributable folder is meant to be run under a web server. Locally opening it will not work, as stated also when using \"quasar build\" to build it.. @boneq what do you mean?. This won't apply to v0.15 datatable revamp, so closing. Sorry for the delay.. Thanks!. Available in v0.15 through Notify plugin. Forgot to close this.. They are customizable, but cannot include all possible options that one can think of, obviously. Especially when they deviate from Material or iOS guidelines.\nWill think of a possibility to ease theme creation for the community though.. There is a bug in Vue 2.4.x which is being worked on. Downgrade to Vue 2.3 in the mean time.\nMore info here (including vue bug link): #710. Hi, this has been reported multiple times. Please downgrade to Vue 2.3 (there is also a bug in Vue 2.4 that breaks a lot of packages out there, not only Quasar and the fix in Vue awaits to be included its next release).\nWill post a message on forum when it is safe to upgrade to Vue 2.4.\nThanks.. This error does not exists when using Vue 2.3. Please check your package version (not from package.json, but from the actual Vue package inside node_modules).\nAlso, what Quasar version are you using?. It's probably a problem with PurifyCSS. Disable it from config. Any repo I can take a look?. Can't reproduce it.. I need a repo where this problem can be reproduced. Can contain anything you want as long as it highlights the issue. Thx.. No longer a problem in v0.15. Forgot to close this.. Awesome improvements in future v0.15 for QLayout, this included ;). Code ready in future v0.15 so closing this.. Code ready in future v0.15 so closing this.. Will fix it. Thanks for reporting.. Hmm, could not reproduce in my tests. Will investigate. Thx for reporting.. Hi, any gif available to highlight the issue pls?. Added in future v0.15. Examples: q-ml-small, q-pr-regular\nSyntax: q-[m | p][l | r | t | b | a]-[small | ....] -- m (margin), p (padding), l (left), r (right), ....... Available in v0.15. Forgot to close this.. Will do.. autofocus-filter Boolean property available in edge and future v0.14.5. Navigating with keyboard is part of another ticket and will get into Quasar soon too.. Will enhance Toast.. Will investigate. Any screenshots?. Try v0.15.. Will investigate. Thx for reporting. I believe this is fixed in latest v0.14.. It's already in v0.14 as monthNames and dayNames props. Please reopen if you think something can still be improved. Thx.. I see your point. Will add short names.. Hi, This has been implemented in v0.15 through the i18n, so closing this.. Tried with a macOS Sierra and Chrome and could not reproduce... This makes sense only when running under a desktop browser. Will do. Thanks for the proposal.. Closing as it's ready in future v0.15. This has to do entirely with Vue. On what Vue version are you on?. Are you sure the handler method's content can be inline per Vue rules? For example, using the following handler inline will generate error:\njs\nhandler () {\n  console.log('bla bla')\n}\nPlease reopen with full handler() code. Thanks!. So is there an issue or not? :). You can use whatever CSS preprocessor you like. All you need is to add the right webpack loader for it. More info in documentation (Guide).. The order of imports in your app is wrong. Initialize a new Quasar app folder and follow main.js imports order from there.\nPls reopen if something is still wrong. RTL support is still experimental and not yet officially released a stable version.. This is no longer a problem for v0.15 (along with new CLI and starter kit, so closing this).. Are you sure the app has access to the target script (server) to which the upload is being made? If you are, then please reopen. QUploader has been tested on all platforms. Thanks.. Done for v1.0.. 99% done and will be available in future v0.15.. Hi all,\nPlease be patient for v0.15 release. This will be the first version officially supporting a standalone build.. http://beta.quasar-framework.org/components/autocomplete.html#Using-Static-Data\nYou can tell which field to search on (field prop), and what to display when user selects an autocomplete entry (value from list entry).. Assuming you are on v0.14.. If not using static data then you can use .map() to convert to the required format (in this case value will be used).. Hi, Implemented in v0.14 or v0.15 (can't remember for sure), so closing this.. Hi, This has been fixed for v0.15, so closing this. Thanks for reporting.. Will be available in Quasar v0.17.10. @netanelwebzi Browser quirks. I'm really interested in your \"few css fixes\". I want Quasar RTL to be perfect. Please send me an email and share. This will ensure that on future Quasar versions you won't have to revisit the RTL fixes. Thanks!. Ah... I now see the equivalent PR implemented your other doc PR.. Should have seen them both. Anyway, closing this as it's already implemented now in edge.\nOne question though, do you really need \"A\" or \"P\"? I haven't seen this in any other date handler library.. Hi,\nI believe the exactly same thing can be done in userland by using a computed variable (along with a QSearch) which filters your tree object model based on a searchString and then feeding that computed variable as model for QTree, so not really useful to bloat QTree with this. This also allows total freedom of how the filtering itself is being done.\nYou can use the forum if you need help on this one.\nThanks.\n. Please read the following links:\n\nhttp://beta.quasar-framework.org/components/introduction-for-beginners.html (especially the section for using components and directives)\nhttp://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/522/upgrade-guide-for-0-14-beta. Yes, lots changed. Be sure to read the v0.14 docs carefully.\nRequiring components is now mandatory to take advantage of tree shaking in webpack.. Please confirm that you enabled IE support: http://beta.quasar-framework.org/guide/browser-support.html. No worries. The reason IE support is added separately is that in most of the cases devs don't need it and since it adds a few tens of Ks to the build it doesn't makes sense to always have it.\n\nCheers.. v0.15 will contain a complete overhaul of QDataTable, extending its functionality and making it much more customizable. There are more tickets opened for this component and all are going to be included in the overhaul.. Closing as code is ready (and even expands on the original request) in future v0.15.. Hi,\nCan you test with latest 0.13.x (which is 0.13.10) pls? If it doesn't works, do you have any repo where I can reproduce?\nAnd most importantly: does it reproduce with v0.14?\nThanks.. @moringaman use the edge version. v0.14 is not yet officially released. http://beta.quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-nightly-build.html\nYou might want to use the appropriate starter kit too: quasar init default#beta <folder_name>. Any user/pass with which I can login? If this is too sensitive, please contact me on Gitter. Thanks.. cordova is defined and working well.\nThe problem is how you use all the cordova plugins. Please read their documentation page.\nFor example, Camera plugin is accessed with navigator.camera instead of cordova.plugins.camera. Same for geolocation.. Always read each Cordova plugin's documentation to see how it can be used.. Fix available in v0.14 edge. Hi,\nI'm sorry but I'm gonna have to close this as this feature would seriously interfere with stack/float labels.. Added method:\n| Method | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| setScrollPosition(offset[, duration]) | Set scroll position to an offset. If a duration (in milliseconds) is specified then the scroll is animated. |. quasar init default#beta means you are creating a default template on a folder called \"default#beta\"\nThe full syntax is quasar init <template_name> <folder>. If folder param is missing, then the default template (currently v0.13) is created with the indicated folder name. It's in docs.\nSo for v0.14 template go with specifying the folder too: quasar init default#beta <folder_name>. I can confirm component templates are updated to match v0.14 specifications on the default#beta starter kit. The only change required was in in templates/layout.vue.\nIf you are upgrading a v0.13 starter kit then also copy the default#beta templates folder.. @pdanpdan Do a search on \"functional: true\" in the codebase. One difference is that you'll be using \".js\" extension instead of \".vue\".\nThere's a \"but\": don't think that the Vue provide API works for functional components. Might be worth a re-check.. What exactly do you mean? Does it starts with a delay or it starts then lags? (An answer to this is very important)\nWhen changing routes Vue comes into action and starts rendering the page which is a blocking action (fortunately in 99% cases this is really fast so user takes no notice of this).\nCannot reproduce the issue, so can you do another test with latest edge pls? I've done some updates and was wondering if this can still be reproduced. Thanks!. Obsolete for v0.15, so closing.. Hi, This has been fixed in v0.15, so closing this. Thanks for reporting!. @thugic Yes, that's the Material component.\nSorry for not participating in the discussion yet. Overloaded with work preparing the v0.15 release. Will join afterwards.. @jpgilchrist Rest assured this is planned for v1 which is set to be released this year.. No additional CSS from Quasar is added. Only animate.css.... Sounds good.. I just re-read the request. QFab emits 'open'/'close' events already. You can hook into those and trigger the tooltips (call 'open' method on their refs). This needs to be done in userland and not in Quasar.. @kevingermain Each QFabAction should contain its tooltip.. Just found a bug for the close() method in QFab. Please update to edge version or wait 1-2 days until v0.14.4 becomes official.\nAnyway, the reason that tooltips are misplaced is that when the Fab is opened, the action buttons travel to their final position but Tooltips are opened before this happens. So, add a setTimeout for 300ms like this:\njs\n    openFab () {\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        this.$refs.tooltip1.open()\n        this.$refs.tooltip2.open()\n      }, 300)\n    },\n    closeFab () {\n      this.$refs.tooltip1.close()\n      this.$refs.tooltip2.close()\n    }\nhtml\n<q-fab @open=\"openFab\" @close=\"closeFab\" .... >. You can also use the Platform detection to decide if you want your Tooltips to get opened only on mobile.. Sounds good.. @LarryEitel Yes, you'll be able to do that. Many new possibilites open up with the revamp.. Rough ETA: 1 month. v0.15 coming along with other components and need to ensure quality. Otherwise the datatable would be ready in 2-3 days. Thanks for your patience.. Closing as code is ready in v0.15 datatable revamp.. Hi,\nThere are observables Quasar components.\nYours is at http://beta.quasar-framework.org/components/window-resize-observable.html\n-Razvan. Hi, This sounds like a misusage. Can you post your whole component or better do you have a repo I can take a look at? Thanks!. Some thoughts:\n\nNavigating away most likely destroys your component where you have the QModal. So might be a good idea to extract QModal to a place where navigating away does not destroy it (and by so doing Vue reference to modal becoming useless).\nIf you register the event handler in the mounted component hook, then it means you will be constantly adding handlers for that event if you navigate back and forth to the route which renders your component.\n\nMight be a good idea to rethink your strategy.. Hmm, no need to use an Event bus for this.\n```js\nexport default {\n  mixins: [helpers],\n// no mounted() necessary anymore, just delete this line:\n  mounted () { },\ndata () {\n    return {\n      treeModel: [\n        {\n          title: 'LCS',\n          expanded: true,\n          children: [\n            {\n              title: 'HQ-Dubl\u00edn / HQ (active)',\n              expanded: false,\n              children: [\n                {\n                  title: 'HQ-Dubl\u00edn Center / HQ (active)',\n                  expanded: false,\n                  children: [\n                    {\n                      title: 'HQ-Dubl\u00edn Center Side A / HQ (active)',\n                      expanded: false,\n                      children: []\n                    },\n                    {\n                      title: 'HQ-Dubl\u00edn Center Side B / HQ (active)',\n                      expanded: false,\n                      children: []\n                    }\n                  ]\n                },\n                {\n                  title: 'HQ-Dubl\u00edn East / HQ (active)',\n                  expanded: false,\n                  children: []\n                },\n                {\n                  title: 'HQ-Dubl\u00edn West / HQ (active)',\n                  expanded: false,\n                  children: []\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              title: 'HQ-Madrid / HQ (active)',\n              expanded: false,\n              children: []\n            },\n            {\n              title: 'HQ-Par\u00eds / HQ (active)',\n              expanded: false,\n          // notice we use ES6 arrow functions\n          handler: () => {\n             // we got access to our component here, so referencing modal directly\n             this.$refs.salesForceModal.open()\n            Toast.create.positive('Editando HQ-Par\u00eds / HQ (active)')\n          },\n          children: []\n        },\n        {\n          title: 'HQ-Toulouse / HQ (active)',\n          expanded: false,\n\n          // same as above with ES6 arrow functions\n          handler: () => {\n            // we got access to our component here, so referencing modal directly\n            this.$refs.salesForceModal.open()\n            Toast.create.positive('Editando HQ-Par\u00eds / HQ (active)')\n          },\n          children: []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n}\n}\n```.

It's not QDatetime at fault here. The model, if supplied by a string, gets transformed to a javascript new Date(). If the string does not have timezone, then the local browser timezone is taken into account. This is a browser behavior. In order to avoid timezone confusion, it's best that you feed QDatetime with the full ISO string containing also timezone, like 1985-09-10T21:00:00.000-03:00.. Make a PR on the i18n branch pls.

It will, closing as this has become duplicate of a more complete Github ticket: #882 \nScheduled for v0.15.. Will investigate. Thanks for reporting!. Hi, This has been fixed in v0.15, so closing this.. Hi,\nI'm sorry, don't know how this ticket slipped out for so long. You need to use, for example in v0.15, the max-height prop.\nhtml\n<q-input type=\"textarea\" :max-height=\"100\" v-model=\"myModel\" />\nFor some reason, iOS is buggy when the textarea height auto-grows.. No longer applies as QLayout has been rewritten. You don't need this functionality anymore as each layout part has a v-model now.. Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/662. Hi,\nThis is a very complicated issue. I see many requests like \"add this and that to Dialog\". Dialog should be a very lightweight component. If you need a specific behaviour, you can design your own Modal for it.\nValidation is especially something that I wouldn't like to add to this component because you need a validation library and there are plenty to choose from. Some want to work with a specific validation library, some want with another. Cannot make something to please everybody.\nSo, the solution is to design your own minimized Modal which will best fit your needs.. keep-alive Boolean property added to QTabPane. Avoid using <keep-alive> Vue component and use this property instead.\nAvailable in future v0.15.\nLet me know if you need this quick as it may take a while before v0.15 will be out.. Available starting with v0.14.3. It's due to HMR and QModal's feature to mingle with window history in order for the back button to work. Cannot happen in production build.. There's currently nothing that can be done to overcome this for dev builds other than disabling this feature entirely.\nWhat you can do is this though, BUT only for dev builds.\njs\n// in main.js:\nimport { Platform } from 'quasar'\nif (DEV) { // this block will automatically disappear on production builds\n   Platform.has.popstate = false\n}. It overrides the detection of popstate event and sets it to false regardless of the environment where the website/app is running under. The \"back\" button won't close the QModal anymore.\nIn order for Quasar to provide a feature no other framework has, it stretches the capabilities of both Vue and Webpack's HMR. When you open a QModal it adds an entry in the window History and registers for popstate event so that when you hit back the QModal will get closed rather than your website/app navigate to the previous route (while Modal is still opened at the top). Now, when HMR kicks in, it destroys and recreates the modal, but there's no way to safely remove the history entry (added before when modal first got opened) and still display the modal. So the end result is that each HMR action adds another history entry. You can close the modal if you hit the same amount of HMR actions that took place + 1, or hit browser refresh button (and modal goes away so you need to open it again).\nThe code indicated above is guarded by if (DEV) so when building for production it completely removes those lines (automatically) and hinders Quasar from taking advantage of the History API thus the side effect of HMR on modals goes away.. selected needs to be a Function which takes one param as the item that got selected.. Duplicate. Will do. Closing. Agreed. Will do. I was just thinking of the overhead implied in parsing all the possibilities.. Available in edge and future v0.14.3. v-link has been removed.

Fix available in edge and future v0.14.4. Fix available in edge and future v0.14.4. I find a few problems with this design:\n\n1. If for example you have a sibling element which uses \"col-X\" then the spacer will not occupy the remaining space. The space will be divided according to col-X and col (used by spacer).\n\n2. Overloading the button with additional props is not ideal from multiple perspectives. One is from performance perspective: it adds to the Quasar footprint and makes code run a (very) little bit slower. Second problem would be that while these new props add commodity, they won't work if the parent element does not have the \"row\" class.\n\nAny suggestions to these problems?.

Ok, final design: added `keep-color` prop for QCheckbox, QRadio and QToggle, and also a bonus `dark` Boolean prop for displaying on darker backgrounds.\n\nWill be available in v0.15..

Hi,\n\nThe solution to this is to map data to the correct format. This can be done in app-land or in Quasar directly. Rather than adding complexity to Quasar, I'd suggest you just map the data to the required format.

Hi,\n\nEnabling this will trigger \"clicks\" even when user is scrolling the page, so it's not something we want.. Thanks for the kind words. Yep, it is.

Hi,\n\nThanks for the detailed description! Would you be so kind to do a PR on this if you have time? This would speed up things. I'm currently 200% overloaded. Will get to this in a few days if nobody has time for it. Thanks.. Hi,\n\nPlease redirect this to Webpack or Vue-loader. This is not handled by Quasar at all. Thank you!. Awesome, saw your PRs and I think they are great. Please allow me some time to finish my current Quasar task and then I'll jump to your PRs. Sounds good?. I think you refer to the new datatable?\nThe sort method can be overriden to accomodate to any requirements by specifying `sortMethod` prop as a function taking following parameters data, sortBy, descending (provided by Quasar).. Will investigate. Thanks for reporting!. Wrong use case. QItemTile has boolean \"image\" prop, so the correct usage is:\n```html\n<q-item-tile image> <img src=\"...\"> </q-item-tile>\n```. This has to do with Vue 2.5 having a breaking change. \"scope\" needs to be \"slot-scope\". Just make a general replace of that and it will be fine.. Closing as it's duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/980\nAlso, there's a PR waiting for me to merge it just for this.. This is not a bug. This is a feature. It allows hitting \"back\" button (both on a desktop or on a mobile website or app) to close the modal, as would the user expect. This is something that sets apart Quasar from any other framework.. Will do.. Hi, In v0.15 this component has been removed, since it's very easy to just configure two QDatetime-s side by side. There's been a lot of requests regarding this component, and implementing all of them will just make it very inefficient. The workaround it's so easy that really, we don't need a QDatetimeRange.. Would you be so kind as to provide a PR? I am over my head with other areas at the moment. If not, it's ok, this will eventually get fixed.. Hi, QUploader is configured to display the size of the remaining files to be uploaded, not of the already uploaded files. After upload, you can set prop \"hide-upload-button\" to `true`.. Will do. Thanks.. Forgot to close this ticket long time ago :). Can you post the full layout template, including QLayout tag? Thanks!. Can you post the full layout template, including QLayout tag? Thanks!.

Please report this to Cordova devs. This has nothing to do with Quasar. Thanks..

Let me know how it goes. I am very interested in this. Thanks.. For the life of me, I cannot reproduce, even with your vue component... Any gif or something?. First, are you sure you are using a v0.14 template? What was the version from which you upgraded?. ![dialog_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4665641/32381426-53cefdb6-c0bb-11e7-9dc7-1b78c235fc8f.gif)\n. I've tested in all browsers and it seems to work. So let's do some more tests to figure out what is happening for you:\n\n1. Downgrade to your previous Quasar version. Make sure that version is installed, do not just change package.json then run \"npm run dev\". Also downgrade Vue to 2.3.x.\n\n2. Second test (might be worth doing with both Quasar versions). Make a new route pointing to this vue file:\n\n```vue\n<template>\n <div>Test area</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport {\n  Dialog\n} from 'quasar'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'Test',\n  beforeCreate () {\n    console.log(`Quasar v${this.$q.version}`)\n    console.log('has popstate:', this.$q.platform.has.popstate)\n    window.addEventListener('popstate', () => {\n      console.log('popstate occurred')\n    })\n  },\n  created () {\n    console.log('route', this.$route)\n  },\n  methods: {\n    testDialog () {\n      Dialog.create({\n        title: 'Test Dialog 1',\n        buttons: [\n          {\n            label: 'Button 1',\n            preventClose: true,\n            handler (data, closeThis) {\n              console.log('Button 1 clicked')\n              closeThis()\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            label: 'Button 2',\n            handler () {\n              console.log('Button 2 clicked')\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  mounted () {\n    this.testDialog()\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n3. Third test, change `mounted()` a little.\n3.a.

Did you try downgrading and testing again?\n2. Cache shouldn't affect this at all...\n3. I'm gonna make a special debugging build for you to see what's going on.

This behavior will go away 100% on v0.15 (to be released really soon).. This behavior will go away 100% on v0.15 (to be released really soon).. Hi, pushing very hard to bring that v0.15 ASAP. I am excited about the many many improvements and I also want to see them released so you can all enjoy them. Also, a good news is that at current time it seems like v0.15 will be the last release before v1.0.. Hi, pushing very hard to bring that v0.15 ASAP. I am excited about the many many improvements and I also want to see them released so you can all enjoy them. Also, a good news is that at current time it seems like v0.15 will be the last release before v1.0.. Until v0.15 is available, for v0.14 a workaround would be to disable this back-button feature completely by adding this in main.js:\n\n```js\nimport { Platform } from 'quasar'\nPlatform.has.popstate = false\n```\n\nSorry for the delay. I'm sure you all want v0.15 to be perfect when released.. Although this started out as a top feature to set the framework apart from all the rest, it caused more grief than what it brought good to a website/app. The fault is in the History API design and we can't do anything about it unfortunately.\n\nAs a result, this feature has been dropped from v0.15. This greatly simplifies many areas of the framework:\n* You will no longer need QSideLink in drawers. You can directly tell the vue router to go to another route and it will do so without the need to get a Vue reference on the drawer to call its close/hide method. Same applies to QModals and all the components that were using popstate.\n* QModals, QPopovers etc now work flawlessly with HMR too, and they can fully support a v-model instead of using references.\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg. The overall complexity of app-space code for a website/app with Quasar will drop significantly.. Hi,\n\nFixed in v1.0.. Thank you! Available in edge now.. Already in future v0.15 ;). So use it, cause it's already there :). While this might sound like a good idea, it's actually not. There are countless ways in which you can use QFields along with form components and I haven't found a solution without breaking any of them. So this should actually be left for the developer to handle in his/her own specific case. Will re-asses this again and provide a final statement on it. First idea that pops into my mind is to use a QSlideTransition -- which will hide the helper and then show the error label (and backwards). If this works flawlessly, then I'll add this to Quasar. Might take a while since I'm in the middle of working on a completely new starter kit, so thank you for your patience. If anyone wants to take a shot at it before I get to it, please do.. The `autocomplete=\"off\"` part is an attribute that should be added directly to the `` tag enclosed by Quasar form components. In v0.14 this is currently not possible, but in v0.15 you will have the \"attributes\" property just for that.. Revisited this ticket. Since Quasar cannot know what amount of space your helper or error message will take, I suggest you put a height on each such QFields to accommodate that.. Will investigate. If anyone care to have a shot at it, pls do through a PR. Thanks for reporting!. This is fixed in 0.15.5.. Thanks for reporting!. QScrollArea makes sense only desktop browsers to actually hide the default ugly ones. By default, mobile browsers (including mobile apps) hide the scrollbar and show it only scrolling is occurring, so Quasar can rely on that.\n\nBottom line, why should Quasar not rely on the default behaviour on mobile browsers / mobile apps?. I just revisited this ticket. QScrollArea inside into QCollapsible is not supported. Sorry. Let me know if you need more details.. Already implemented in future v0.15.. Hi, pondering on this one. Will offer more details (and possibly merge it) next week. Currently I'm overloaded with a new starter kit work. Thanks!. Available in future v0.15. Thanks for taking time for a PR!. This is already enhanced in future v0.15. Closing as it's implemented.. Hi, Care for a quick PR? Would help a lot.. There are some breaking changes. Like your app needs to have a root QApp (new component) and also the QLayout has changed syntax a bit (but not yet finalized). I need to document all these somehow before doing a new quasar-future build and currently on a very tight schedule. I guess I'll just release a new version and let devs look at the examples to figure out the changes (they are easy ones)... Wish I weren't on such a tight schedule :(. Thank you!. As stated, the property name is \"disable\", not \"disabled\".. Hi,\n\nThere is a issue template when you hit the \"New issue\" button. Kindly ask you to fill that out, it has all the necessary information for me to investigate. Thank you!. I believe this is already fixed in v0.15 anyway. Will check later.. Thanks!. Hi, will do.. This was implemented in v0.15. Forgot to close the ticket. `no-icon` Boolean prop.. In v0.15 the /src folder will be in the NPM package, so closing this.. This is currently a limitation. Sorry for any inconvenience.. Hi,\n\nThanks for taking time for a PR!\nIn this revamp you can use a scoped slot for the row and add ANY events you wish. And not only on the row, on any column cell too. Basically you have total freedom. So I am going to close this as it would be kind of redundant and also a little confusing for devs as they would expect this event to be triggered even when using row scoped slot. Can we agree?. Will investigate. Seems quite odd. Maybe some quirks of ios 11 in particular.. Putting a self note for fixing this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46232812/cordova-app-not-displaying-correctly-on-iphone-x-simulator. Yes, PR is already available. Just didn't have enough time to take a look at it yet.. Hi, That's why the observables Quasar components are there.... Hi. Will do. I think there is another request related to this, but don't have time now for it.\nIn any case, this will be implemented. Thanks.. This ticket is enough. Thanks for the proposal!. Will take care of this. Thanks for reporting!. Available in edge and future v0.14.8. Hi,\n\nDoes this has to do with not closing the layout left/right side before navigating to a new route? Any repo I can take a look at?\nAlso, please contact me on Gitter if you were unable to create a new account on forum to sort it out. I've recently added some plugins to avoid automatic registration because we are now fighting spam a lot.. @nueko It's not a bad idea. However reinventing the wheel here adds no value. If Quasar has something simple, devs will jump asking for more and more features (like it happened with Dialog) -- and we'll end up duplicating packages like vuelidate. Vuelidate is simply easy and great and the devs are going into the right direction with it, so I strongly recommend this package.. Yes. Please read the documentation. Use the callbacks.. http://quasar-framework.org/components/layout.html#Vue-Methods --> all these take a callback as param. I now see the documentation is lacking this part, so will add it. Sorry for this.. You'll be able to detect that in v0.15. Working with full energy on releasing that (along with a top-notch new starter kit which will enhance the developer experience greatly!). Hi, please redirect this to the documentation repo. Thanks. https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org. Already fixed in future v0.15.. @MohammedAl-Mahdawi I see you're using RTL. Would you be so kind to help out on the official RTL release? I need devs tweaking the RTL build.. Nice. Merged it. Thanks for taking time for a PR! Will be available in future v0.15.. @nueko Would you also be so kind to add this to docs too?. This is exactly what I am focusing now. A new starter kit which has it all. You will be able to build SPA, PWA, Mobile apps (Cordova) and Electron apps with only one starter kit. In addition, the developer experience for Cordova and Electron is going to take a huge jump forward! Imagine dynamic webpack config (!!) and HMR directly on a device emulator or a real mobile device, without the need of Quasar Play, an furthermore, working with Cordova plugins too! Electron apps will no longer require two package.json... And many many many new possibilites!\n\nOne starter kit to rule them all seamlessly. Stay tuned. Quasar is going to bring the developer experience to its best!. Thx for taking time for a PR!\nCan we improve datatable to also allow null values? This would alleviate a lot of pains. I'm currently focusing on a new starter kit. Just wanting to know if you are interested in this to help me. Thanks!. This is exactly what I am focusing now. A new starter kit which has it all.

Quasar is going to bring the developer experience to its best!. Sounds like a good idea. Pushed PR. Will be available in v0.15.. Hi, thx for this. Would you be so kind to also make a PR on docs, pls?. This is absolutely normal according to current web standards (referring to the way you are using it -- before the datatable). Furthermore, on IOS the z-index will not save you. What is recommended is that the elements that you want to place on top of others be the last or close to last on pages (or at least after the elements that you want to position on top of them). There is no other better way to handle this cross-browser. Imagine a scenario where you use an element with its own z-index -- combined with a hard-coded z-index for QFixedPosition means more trouble than it solves. You can read on by googling about z-index issues.. In v0.15 there are sets of icons (for Material, MDI, Ionicons and Fontawesome). It also allows creating your own set of icons and furthermore the default ones can be overriden. So closing this as this feature will allow setting any icons without using the props.. @cgarnier Everything got re-worked on v0.15 (releasing mid-January), so don't think this should be reopened.. Done for v1, along with much more.. This will get in in a few days. Thanks for taking time for a PR!. Added \"time\" and \"date\" types. Beware that IE & Safari does NOT support it. You can also use QDatetime.\nAvailable in edge and future v0.14.8. Will take this into consideration, although the current funding on Patreon would need to rise so I can have more time for Quasar.. If someone wants to give it a try and make a demo / proof of concept then please do. Currently focusing on finally shipping v1.0, otherwise we'll never reach it as more and more Quasar Modes are requested. Most probably don't realise the team size and that we're providing combined functionality of a UI component lib + CLI + PWA + Cordova + SSR -- the amount of work is already currently insane, this is why any help is greatly appreciated.. Thanks for all your contributions!. Thanks. Good point!. But there's the QPopover for this... Am I missing something?. Added \"clear-value\" prop and it emits `@clear` event (for all form components that are \"clearable\"). In future v0.15.. Was just working now in that area and this will disappear. Will close ticket when it's in future v0.15 code.. Removed the behavior in latest v0.15. Use the default starter kit. You shouldn't have any problems with it.\nOne small remark, please use the forum for questions. This is reserved for requests or bugs only. Thank you.. http://quasar-framework.org/components/tree.html. Write a method which takes one parameter (the index in your v-for) which returns the handler: (simplified example).\n\n```js\nmethods: {\n  handler (index) {\n    return function (props) {\n       ... this is the handler for v-touch-X ...\n       ... and you got a scoped \"index\" too ...\n    }\n  },\n  ...\n}```\n\n```html\n...\n```. @rashnk Hi, v0.14 is quite old. Please try to upgrade to a newer version.. Hi,\n\nWill investigate. It might need a bit of work, so thank you for your patience!. Can everybody confirm it is working with v0.15?. Ok, closing as it's now working with v0.15.. Already in future v0.15. And also copy package.json outside of dist.\nBest is to create a symbolic link to where your Quasar clone is.. not yet. mid-January.. Hi,\n\nThis is not a bug. When using \"inverted\" tabs, the background color is intentionally left out, because there are situations where you would want that effect to occur.\nIn your case, simply put a background color on QTabs tag.. Nice catch! Thanks for taking time for a PR!. Thank you for providing a PR as well! It's available in future v0.15.. Available in future v0.15. Yes, you got this right. You can close this.

QDatetimeRange has been deprecated since two QDatetime-s can be used side by side with same effect. This way they can be configured much easier in user-space.

What's your actual template?. Are you testing on a mobile device? Because on mobile device it is not needed as its purpose is to customize the scrollbar. The scrollbar does not appear on mobile.. Paste your full template here pls. Also, are you testing on Android 7 or on desktop?. Let's chat on gitter in an hour or tomorrow to speed things up, otherwise we're gonna make a huge thread here :). https://gitter.im/quasarframework/Lobby --> `@rstoenescu`. Ok, will port the fix from v0.15 to v0.14 for the workaround on vue's latest issues.. Meanwhile, can we close this?. @mesqueeb what does lately mean? what version are you on (`$quasar info`). can you click on `quasar.esm.js?8bfb:3452 and 3453` and copy paste some lines around to see the method name and more info?. Hi,\n\nIt actually also needs top 0 and bottom 0 so it can occupy full window height on the right side of screen, which is the intended use.\n\nSo it is designed to be positioned like this:\n```\n========\n=     &=\n=     &=\n=     &=\n========\n```\n\nIf someone wants to get an element at middle-height on right-side, it can use the Quasar CSS flex classes to position it, like this:\n` content... `\n\nMind that that you'd need to also place no-pointer-events and all-pointer-events CSS classes so the user can still click/tap around the inner content div:\n` content... `. Hi. Green light. Thx for wanting to supply with a PR as current workload is huge.. Hi, There is no \"docs-input.styl\" in Quasar... How did you end up with this error? Closing this issue meanwhile as it is not related to Quasar.. Thank you for supplying a PR!. Hi, Already done in future v0.15.. Closing as it's fixed in v0.15.. Blocking cookies is very unusual, but will investigate this. Thanks for reporting.. Fixed in future v0.15.. What if the user can also select the hour and minute? Clicking on the exact hour and minute can be error-prone. Will see what I can do.. Done in future v0.15.. Hi, This is already fixed in future v0.15, so closing as v0.15 is close to its release.. Hi, QDataTable has been revamped completely in v0.15, so this is outdated. This type of issue cannot occur in the revamp anyway.. Thanks!. Hi,\n\nPlease take a look at [the specs of scrollTop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollTop), especially the topmost description of it.. Thank you for contributing!. The reason for this is that on mobile, if you don't blur the button then it remains in \"active\" state.\nIf you have time, please submit a PR to only emit blur for mobile (make use of  `this.$q.platform.is.mobile`).\n\nThank you! Be sure to test this thoroughly on mobile and desktop.. Wrap QTransition over  in your layout and specify mode=\"in-out\". For more details, read about [Transition Modes](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Modes).. Hi, This is equivalent with readonly QKnob:\n* http://quasar-framework.org/components/knob.html\n* http://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase/forms/knob. Thank you for contributing! This goes into v0.15.. Hi, What Quasar version are you using? 0.6.4 is the Quasar CLI version.. Can anyone reproduce this?. Hi All,\n\nThis is NOT Quasar related. It is specific to iOS alone. Even with the latest webkit updates, unfortunatley iOS standalone apps still have the 300ms click delay, so we need to bring in fastclick to alleviate this.\n\nWhat to do for pre v0.15: npm install fastclick, then in main.js\n```\nrequire('fastclick')\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n   FastClick.attach(document.body)\n}, false)\n```\n\nIn v0.15, this will be handled automatically (injected only when building with cordova mode for iOS platform) so you don't need to worry about it. Pushing a commit tomorrow for this (on v0.15) and closing the bug.. @Frondor Ok, these are two separate issues. I re-read yours and it's nothing to do with this one. So let's continue your talk on the initial ticket (reopened it). Agreed?\n\nThis one relates to iOS only and on iOS they haven't removed the 300ms delay (for standalone apps only! -- so that's PWA or Cordova). It's easily reproducible and the fix I mentioned above is valid. With Android, on the other hand, there's another story. It's been a long time since they removed the delay. Pushing a fix today for v0.15.. @Frondor Actually, pls open a new ticket with your issue. Thanks.. Pushed a commit for CLI (v0.15) just now to automatically inject Fastclick when building a Cordova app targetting iOS. Thanks for reporting.\nThose who are on pre v0.15, use the workaround that I specified in an early post.. Already in future v0.15 as Notify.. Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/1114. This is one exception. A component changing route when first being rendered can create havoc and unpredictibility within the app, so the \"default\" property is not taken into account.. Hi,\n\nThis is exactly how they are supposed to work. Take a look at the demo source code here: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-play/blob/dev/src/components/showcase/navigation/toolbar.vue#L47\n\nThe \"color\" prop is either for background (when non-inverted) or for text (when inverted). This prop itself is a convenience prop to be consistent with all other components, but you can even go wild and don't add any \"color\" prop but instead use \"text-X\" and \"bg-X\" classes on it.. Hi. There's no problem with QAutocomplete.\n\nThe results have no \"value\" prop specified.\n```js\nresult.push({\n  label: user.username,\n  icon: 'person',\n  value: user.email // <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n})\n```. Time does not allow me to make a test on v0.14, but I can assure v0.15 is working as expected. Just also don't forget that \"value\" prop.. Using QToolbar within a layout, or using a modal layout within a Modal is NOT enforced. You as a developer can choose to display the Modal however you want. It is currently designed to take the width from its content unless you specify a min-width, which allows for great flexibility.\n\nAm I missing the point here? If so, please feel free to reopen.. Thank you!!. Hi, Good idea. Implemented it slightly different, so closing this. Available in future v0.15. Thanks for this!. Thanks!. Hi,\n\nMethods that begin with \"__\" are private and should not be used in App.\nAdded \"pick()\" method in future v0.15.. Thanks!. Hi, This is already in v0.15 DataTable revamp.. @dennythecoder is right. The canonical HTML syntax does not allow all the features currently embedded in QSelect, so we can't switch to it unfortunately.\nIn v1.0 there's going to be a lot of accessibility work done and it may alleviate your problem.. Pushed fix. Thanks for suggestion.. That is code for v0.15. And it allows setting buttons through scoped slot, so you can fully customise them however you want. So closing this.\n\nFor v0.14, you have props to configure if button is flat, push, etc, so closing this.. @Frondor just set one of the other types of buttons to \"true\". The button needs to be set with a type. Let me know if you have any problems with it. Also check [the demo](http://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase/popups/dialog) with [its source](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-play/blob/master/src/components/showcase/popups/dialog.vue).. Use placeholder. Example from demo source:\n\n```html\n With custom placeholder \n\n```\n\nIn your case: `:placeholder=\"model + ' %'\"`. Ah, sorry, gave out the v0.15 way :). Hi, It just so happens that the QColorPicker has just been added to future v0.15 (to be released very soon) ;). Hi,\n\nPlease correct your example by adding slot \"title\" to QRouteTab too.. @laurentpayot \nThanks for taking time for a PR.\n\nQuestion: What is required in order to make it work? Where can someone include that ion-icon component?. Hi,\n\nThanks for wanting to contribute!! Merged it.. Merged PR. Thank you for reporting and offering a PR!. Hi,\n\nThis is not really solvable, since the video iframe itself captures the events and doesn't propagate them. So Quasar cannot intercept them. And it really shouldn't intercept them as the video scripts embedded might become unusable (they have their own controls which shouldn't stop working).. Hi,\n\nThanks for taking an interest in performance.\n\nDid a quick test: created a page with only a QModal having a QModalLayout. From this empirical test it seems that having QModalLayout as a functional component actually has a better performance than a regular component:\n\nRegular:\n\n\nFunctional:\n\n\nSo it seems that by having QModalLayout as regular then this component is rendered an additional one time more. The \"// ---\" comment was typed directly in the browser console after each step (page initial render, type comment, click on btn to show Modal, type comment, click \"Close\" btn).\n\nThis is QModalLayout as a regular component (as opposed to a functional as it is now):\n```js\nexport default {\n  name: 'q-modal-layout',\n  props: {\n    headerStyle: [String, Object, Array],\n    headerClass: [String, Object, Array],\n\n    contentStyle: [String, Object, Array],\n    contentClass: [String, Object, Array],\n\n    footerStyle: [String, Object, Array],\n    footerClass: [String, Object, Array]\n  },\n  render (h) {\n    console.log('QModalLayout render')\n    const child = []\n\n    if (this.$slots.header || (__THEME__ !== 'ios' && this.$slots.navigation)) {\n      child.push(h('div', {\n        staticClass: 'q-layout-header',\n        style: this.headerStyle,\n        'class': this.headerClass\n      }, [\n        this.$slots.header,\n        __THEME__ !== 'ios' ? this.$slots.navigation : null\n      ]))\n    }\n\n    child.push(h('div', {\n      staticClass: 'q-modal-layout-content col scroll',\n      style: this.contentStyle,\n      'class': this.contentClass\n    }, [\n      this.$slots.default\n    ]))\n\n    if (this.$slots.footer || (__THEME__ === 'ios' && this.$slots.navigation)) {\n      child.push(h('div', {\n        staticClass: 'q-layout-footer',\n        style: this.footerStyle,\n        'class': this.footerClass\n      }, [\n        this.$slots.footer,\n        __THEME__ === 'ios' ? this.$slots.navigation : null\n      ]))\n    }\n\n    return h('div', {\n      staticClass: 'q-modal-layout column absolute-full'\n    }, child)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCan you please reopen with how you see things getting improved? Thanks again.. It may be that the regular components are more suited when they have \"reactive\" props, even though they are more expensive to render at first. I'm still unsure which way to go, regular or functional. I feel we're missing out a metric to establish which is actually better in this case.. It's not hard converting all functional comps to regular comps. This is not an issue. I am however buffed by the fact that in my empirical test the number of QModalLayout's render times is +1 when it's regular, as opposed to when being functional. This seems to contradict Vue authors.. Awesome work here! Thank you! Will change all functional components to regular, then we'll see where we get from there.. Pushed:\n```\ncommit b46d7637407e3199f4276be68cda5b71756618ec (HEAD -> dev, origin/dev, origin/HEAD)\nAuthor: Razvan Stoenescu \nDate:   Wed Dec 27 22:41:44 2017 +0200\n\n    refactor: Functional components to regular components\n```\n\nCan you test again and see how we perform now? I'd like to see a comparison between v0.14 - v0.15 before commit above, v0.15 after commit above.\n\nThanks again for all the help!. This needs a careful consideration. Will take care of it tomorrow. Thanks for offering a PR!. Please document the other scenarios here. This helps us a lot.. Did a test. Breaks too many things. Postponing this for after v0.15.. @dietrichg Already in next Quasar version ;). @dietrichg Next version means it's not released yet :). QInput, QSelect, QToggle etc etc have \"disable\" as prop. No component has \"disabled\". Where did you find \"disabled\"?. Hi,\n\nQStepper will be much more flexible in v1.0. It includes ability to use it in a \"non-linear\" fashion too.. Closing as \"nativeOn\" is the right way at the moment.. Hi,\n\nWhat's your host OS? Please copy-paste the whole console output (including your command).\nI assume that you've run \"npm install\" inside the project folder, right?\n\nThanks.. Yes, green light. Thanks if you want to provide a PR for this!. Yes, sure. Please go ahead.. Any progress on this?. This has same root cause as https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/1269,\nso closing it. Seems like iOS 11 is \"naughty\". Will get fixed. Thanks!. Hi,\n\nSomething must be wrong in your app.\nTake a look at docs again pls: http://quasar-framework.org/components/autocomplete.html\nand at the demo on docs page: http://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase/forms/autocomplete\nand at the demo's source code: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-play/blob/master/src/components/showcase/forms/autocomplete.vue\n\nThe autocomplete has been battle tested, so something must be wrong in your usage. If you are following everything to the letter, then pls reopen with your exact .vue file.\nThank you!. Fixed in v0.15-beta.10. The problem is really complex. Has to do with HMR and some Vue lifecycle hooks. There's been another patch done recently which will get into 0.15.7 (releasing today). So expect this issue to finally vanish for good.. Hi,\n\n1. QTransition is just a soft-wrap over Vue's `` component.\n2. Like the component it wraps (described earlier), it does NOT add any additional DOM element, it just tells Vue what animation to use and how.\n3. Regarding the QList example: the \"striped\" property adds a CSS class to the QItem(s) which uses a CSS selector to tell which QItems should have different background color. But the CSS selector takes into account all DOM nodes (including ones which have CSS to hide them). By using QTransition/Vue-transition, some QItems may be in that case so the \"striped\" may appear broken (as it does not take into account the \"hidden from view\" nodes, it just takes into account all DOM sibling nodes). One solution to this would be to write and apply a custom CSS class based on the index on that v-for, something like if index divides by 2, then apply that class.\n\nFurthermore, did some performance tests and it appears it's actually better to remove the sugar-coated QTransition and enforce developers to directly use Vue's , so this component will probably be removed for v0.15.. The event has been fixed already in future v0.15. Also, the better way to deal with this in v0.15 will be through the v-model applied to the Modal. You'll be able to listen for the 'close' event or add a watcher on the model.. Hi,\n\nYou are creating project folders using the webpack1 starter kit...\nJust issue \"quasar init quasar-demo\" -- webpack3 has been added to the starter kit looong time ago.. Please always read the documentation: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/. Thank you!!. The purpose of this feature is to offer a boilerplate-free opportunity for the developer to have a \"loading\" feature embedded into the QBtn, which may not cover all possible use-cases.\n\nHowever, for custom use-cases, you can still do it... Just place your logic inside the QBtn:\n\n```html\n\n\nMy label...\n\n```. Merged it. Sorry it took so long. The workload is huge.\nThanks for taking time for a PR!. Hi,\n\nIn this case you want the value, right? But you have it in your vue scope and you can use it (the v-model). You can even apply a Vue ref on the select and then access it.\n\nAdding the new prop is reduntant.. Hi,\n\nI'm not sure what you mean. Help me understand. QUploader is meant only for uploading files. Once they are uploaded, it's developer's task to do something with them or later retrieve them from the server etc... If the latter is your case, please close as this is not QUploader's responsibility.\n\nPlease explain in a detailed way what you are trying to do, but take into account the above words.\n\nThank you.. Hi,\n\nThe pages/layouts are loaded by Webpack through JSONP and not Ajax, so it won't capture that too. However, you can use Vue Router's  navigation guards to connect with QAjaxBar's start/stop methods (start increments number of current loading resources, stop decrements that number, so you can call multiple start or multiple stop at once). In order to connect the QAjaxBar's methods with Vue Router's navigation guards use a store/vuex prop, watch on it on the vue template where you have QAjaxBar defined and call the methods on the vue ref. Wish this was easier, but due to how Vue Router + Webpack works, it's currently a limitation. Will try in the future to further research on how to ease this and probably automate it.. Hi, you need to first understand how Vue works and the scope of variables in both Vue components & ES6.\n\nHere is what you want to achieve:\n```\n\n\n\n```\n```\n\n  export default {\n    methods: {\n      edit (done, props) {\n        // Some various processing delay with loading spinner\n        done()\n        // then\n        this.$router.push({ path: '/edit/' + props.row.id })\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n\nExplanation: you need to access `props`, so creating an anonymous arrow function (acting as proxy) to feed the click event in the scope where `props` is defined.\n\nIt might look cumbersome, but it's how you can do it in Vue. This has nothing to do with Quasar anyway.. Hi,\n\nThe old layout in v0.13 used flexbox which in turn hindered the use of native scrolling. But in v0.14 it's not the case anymore. You only use the native scrolling now.\n\nIf you want to switch from Framework7, it might be worth-wile to wait a little bit longer as v0.15 will be out of the oven this month. Major improvements in all areas, including the developer experience when building mobile apps.. Available in future v0.15. Examples:\n```html\n always vertical \n...\n...\n always horizontal \n...\n```\n\nNote that \"label-width\" will support numbers in String format too.. @stefanvanherwijnen Hi,\n\nBecause the `debounce` method should only return a debounced function, not a Promise. The most use cases (but not all) for `debounce` are debouncing component methods. It's not trying to fit any custom scenarios, just doing one job and one job only. However, if you need the implementation above, you can just copy paste it into a file and import it where needed.. Hi, yes. Please don't use this space as a personal \"Google Keep\" :))). Fixed by https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/pull/1398.\nThanks for PR!. Hi,\n\nAlready fixed this in v0.15 (which is around the corner).\nCan you wait for the release or do you need this badly in v0.14? Currently focusing on bringing v0.15 out of the oven asap.. Yes. It evaluates the value given, in this case '{}' which is an Object, so always true-ish. But don't make the value an object as it doesn't makes sense.. Already fixed in future v0.15. This was a feature that eventually brought more trouble than its worth :). Hi, Already fixed that with the much superior layout in future v0.15.. Hi. How confident are you in this commit that it doesn't break anything?. Also, please follow the already establish style (if's, parenthesis etc). Thanks for taking time for a PR!. Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-starter-kit so you can test it. Or test it directly on Quasar's repo (/dev folder).. Yes, will need to add this to the docs page too. But the doc page is non-existent at the moment. Thanks for taking time for a PR!. Thanks! Nice finds for the PRs!. Nice!. Good catch! Thanks for the PR!. Would you be so kind to make a PR for docs? Hit the pencil at the top or the \"Edit this page\" link at the bottom, make changes, then submit PR.. Fixed it. It should have been removed. Thanks for reporting!. This is scheduled, but in my tests I found it's not stable enough. For example, simple \".js\" files are parsed by eslint-plugin-vue too and it throws an error in its own code. So can't have this embedded yet. I already have the code ready, just waiting for this to be fixed.\nThanks for the suggestion and for offering to create a PR!. @jmellicker Hi, all three points are implemented for future v0.15 already. And there's something more, that applies to all form components: you can even configure if you want lazy-update (listening on the `@change` event instead of on `@input`). This is as a preparation for when [a PR for Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6940) is going to be merged in (will happen in near future).\n\nWorking on demos and docs to release v0.15 asap.. @Surenapetrosyan Use lazy input (check docs). Also check this comment: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/1803#issuecomment-374334078. Thanks!. Merged PR. Thank u both!. Good work!. @tothed \n\n* Fluent Design System is just a concept. On web development, you can even call it \"responsiveness\". In Quasar, you have all the CSS helper classes and all the JS functionality so you can build your own website/app's components to be responsive (note that Quasar's components are responsive by default). It's the developer's job to make the UI fit this concept. Quasar cannot account for all the infinite ways in which developers could build their page content. It's like asking: \"whatever HTML I have in the page, I want it responsive\"... Quasar takes care of its own components for that, and it offers the building blocks upon which you can take care of your app-space components.\n* Quasar supports animations out of the box (check docs)\n* Quasar already has QParallax. Hi @smolinari ,\n\nYou're mixing some things and hopefully I can clarify them.\n1. The concept of Quasar \"theme\" applies to how components look. It has nothing to do on what platform they are rendered: mobile or desktop. This is the backbone on which you can build webpage templates (gonna talk about this later on).\n2. Quasar themes are totally customisable through Stylus variables.\n3. A webpage template refers to what is like Bootstrap templates. Like examples of a login page, examples of a showcase page, of a profile page, of a contact us page etc etc with its own design on top of one of the Quasar themes.\n4. I was hoping the community would offer some help and they would build such templates. Quasar is and has been fully equipped to deal with this for a long time. I'm working an inhuman 25 hrs a day and just can't take care of the framework, documentation, Quasar Play (which showcases the components) and on top of that also build such templates or apps, but this is a topic for another discussion.\n\nBottom line: saying \"Material and iOS are mobile only\" is a huge misunderstanding of the concept itself. It has nothing to do with desktop or mobile. And it's also highly customisable. Just if you haven't seen some examples of responsive login pages or landing pages or ....fill the blanks... doesn't mean Quasar is not capable of that. It actually excels at this because it has top-notch building block on top of which developers can easily create webpage template. It can successfully replace Bootstrap or Bulma, so this is some food for thought.\n\nYou might have been mislead by the concept of themes due to the documentation website. You get Quasar showcase on a mobile frame on the right side. It doesn't mean it only runs on mobile phones, or that you can only build mobile apps, or that Quasar themes are equipped on dealing only with small screens! Currently working on SSR support and once that is done, the doc website is going to get a full revamp, this time using Quasar itself (on SSR). Things will get much more clear. Guess if I don't get any help by the time Quasar reaches v1, I'm gonna have to spend time on doing some webpage templates myself, just to show examples of such capabilities.\n\nPS: would love to have you back in the loop ;). This would be a huge effort, and I'm engaging with the community if it's worth it. If enough people require it, it will get into the official roadmap. Have you seen my slides on Quasar at Vue Contributors Day? https://medium.com/quasar-framework/slides-on-quasar-vue-contributors-day-3af41568a119. I simply love your video screen captures! It makes things so easy for me to see what's going on, what changed and how. Thank you for your great work!. I like it. Good work, again!. This has been fixed in v0.14+, so closing. Not enough resources to release another v0.13 iteration, so sorry. Please upgrade.. Awesome!. Yes, this is being worked on.. Fixed in latest v0.15 build.. I cannot reproduce this. Can someone make a github repo with the minimum amount of code to reproduce this, pls?. I cannot reproduce this. Can someone make a github repo with the minimum amount of code to reproduce this, pls?. @mwarren2 Investigated why this only happens on Meteor.\n\nSeems like the the CSS is injected/evaluated later than the mount point of vue components (including Quasar ones).

What version of Chrome are you using?\nCan anyone else reproduce this?. Could not reproduce, but this issue made me think a little on the touch directives regarding mouse support.

Ah. You mean that. That are the scrollbars that the browsers use when on mobile. There is no way around it if you don't want to lose the native scrolling (which is smooth). Trust me, you want the native scrolling. Sorry.. By the way. Nice website/app. Would like to see that on https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-awesome when it's done..

Hi,\n\nYou don't need any data/table.json. That's simply there (being imported from `https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-play/tree/master/src/data` through a Webpack `data` alias) because in order to demo something to you you need some random data...\n\nSo, supply the data-table component with your own data...\nOne more thing. Please use the forum or Gitter chat for questions as described in the ticket template. This repo is reserved for issues only. Thanks.. Hi,\n\nThe MANY new features can't accommodate with sticky header and columns no more, so this was removed. Sorry for any inconvenience.. Hi,\n\nThis is simply how Vue works. No way around it.... You need to understand that using UMD/standalone you're not taking advantage of vue-loader which compiles your templates into render functions and allow kebab-case/pascal-case conversions as needed. In UMD, you're simply writing HTML that the browser can understand, after which Vue parses the HTML DOM nodes and initialises it.\n\nCan you detail what the PR is about pls?. Interesting. Ok, will you be willing to do some tests? I'm with you 100% on this. I'm taking some time off. Just released v0.15 and I'm beat! Talk to you the following days?. Hi,\n\n1. Do you have a reproduction repo that I can take a look at? Can't see anything in codesandbox.\n2. What version of Quasar are you using?\n3. Why are you importing from 'quasar-framework' instead of 'quasar'?\n\nPlease reopen if replacing 'quasar-framework' with 'quasar' is not working. Thanks.. \"quasar-framework\" npm package does not have a \"main\" due to the fact that each Quasar theme has its own js. So the path is either quasar-framework/dist/quasar.mat.esm.js or quasar-framework/dist/quasar.ios.esm.js. The CLI (or vue-cli-plugin-quasar) adds a webpack alias ('quasar') which points to the right file based on your theme selection.. Thank you!. Thank you! Will be available in v0.15.2.. What above error? \"Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined\" ? I think you can do better than this. Fill in details... How anyone is supposed to investigate your problem without absolutely no clue from you?\n\nAre you lazy loading routes like this in routes.js? `component: import('.....')` instead of `component: () => import('...')`\n\nReopen with more details.

Please use our Discord to get help.\n\nIn any case, for UMD version language packs, just \"quasar init -t umd \" and choose a different language, other than the default \"en-us\". You'll see how to embed it.. Hi. It means you still got the old CLI. Make sure you install the latest one.. Thank you!!. What does this has to do with Quasar?\n\nMost likely the file in which you are using Vuelidate (the one with `$v` doesn't have the proper initialisation required by Vuelidate). If you will copy paste your file here we can help. Otherwise, Vuelidate is working fine..... Please follow the upgrade guide that @pdanpdan pointed out for upgrading to v0.15. Thanks.. Pls redo your tests. Run a \"quasar info\". Make sure you are indeed using 0.15.2. I am 100% sure this issue reported here is fixed.. Can you show me your quasar.conf.js pls? Trying to figure out something.. I'm adding Object.assign polyfill (as indicated in webpack-dev-server ticket) to the Quasar ie-compat package for CLI v0.15.4. That should fix this. I am buffed though as I cannot reproduce :/. Ok, update to 0.15.4 and make one more try. Should be fixed now. Thanks.. Ok, so investigated together with Lou-Der. Seems like a problem with webpack when the dev server is run on a Windows 7 machine and consumed by IE11. However, it is not a problem when the dev server is run on a linux/mac/win10 machine and consumed by a IE11 on a win7 machine.\n\nWill add this to the docs. Unfortunately, until webpack gets a fix we can't do anything. There's nothing wrong from Quasar's side that generates this error.. Hi,\n\nPlease use Yarn instead of npm.

Usage: http://quasar-framework.org/components/notify.html#Basic-Usage\n\nNow, I see following complaints:\n1. **Not supporting HTML markup**. Yes, because Quasar needs to make your app be protected from [Javascript injection](http://www.testingsecurity.com/how-to-test/injection-vulnerabilities/Javascript-Injection).\n2. **You probably want HTML markup because you need multiple lines**. First, according to Material Guidelines, the notification needs to be short. As short as possible. It's not a full-blown alert message. Having a notification popping up and covering half of the screen defeats its purpose (and it's also bad UI). Use a Dialog for these cases.

Or use the `details` prop, but be short with it.\n3. **\"I added Notify to quasar.conf.js, but I still need to import it from Quasar\"**. This applies to the usage outside of Vue files. And you need to import it where you use it in this case. How else would you reference the Notify object??? You may ask yourself: but why do I also need to add it to quasar.conf then? You need to understand that Notify is a Quasar Plugin, so it needs to do some initialisation before it can be used. This is why you need it in quasar.conf.js.\n4. **this.$q.notify does not work in a Vue file. I still need to import it from Quasar??\"**. Where are you using `this.$q.notify`? Inside the Vue component definition, or outside of the `export default {...}`. Notice the usage of `this`!! It has meaning inside of the Vue component definition or in your vue template, not outside of it. If you need it **before** `export default {...}` then yes, you need the \"outside of a Vue file\" usage, because your scope is not the Vue component scope....

When building for PWA, you need to deploy at root and use the default publicPath, otherwise browsers won\u2019t pick up the manifest.\n\nExplaining the default behavior in detail takes a lot of time (which I don't have), but it ensures you don't do mistakes. Mind that you can build for SPA, PWA, Cordova, Electron. Each have their own particularities, especially when dealing with statics. Quasar CLI takes care of all the fuss and makes sure you don't do mistakes. BUT it also allows you to set whatever publicPath you want when building SPA or PWA..

What this means is that some package that you are importing is not built right. It supplies ES6 code instead of ES5. I'd investigate which package is that and look over its docs to make sure it's being used right... even log them a bug to fix their distributables.\nAdding \"node_modules\" to babel-loader processing may increase the build time considerably..

Beware of the floating point presision error in JS: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1458633/how-to-deal-with-floating-point-number-precision-in-javascript. Hi, This has nothing to do with Quasar. How hooks work is Vue-Router business entirely. Check documentation page on what `this` refers to inside these hooks. https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/navigation-guards.html. ```js\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase'\nconst config = {\n  apiKey: '...',\n  authDomain: '...',\n  databaseURL: '...',\n  projectId: '...',\n  storageBucket: '...',\n  messagingSenderId: '...'\n}\n\nconst fireApp = firebase.initializeApp(config)\n\nexport const AUTH = fireApp.auth()\n\nexport default ({ app, router, Vue }) => {\n  Vue.prototype.$auth = AUTH\n}\n```\n\n...then `import { AUTH } from 'plugins/firebase'` where you use it outside of Vue files.\n\nAgain, this has nothing to do with Quasar.... Just \"npm uninstall -g quasar-cli; npm install -g quasar-cli@0.6.5\" and you'll be fine. This is for pre-v0.15 projects.. Hi, SSR is a top priority for Quasar. Can you connect with me on Discord pls? Thanks.. Hi,\n\nThis has to do with HMR (Hot Module Reload) provided by Webpack dev server. I think you need to use another port than the dev-server's one for your socket.io. That's already being used. Your own server needs another channel to communicate.. I think it's best to bring this up to webpack guys... Quasar's not in control of what webpack-dev-server does, other than the params from quasar.conf > devServer which get passed to it -- these params can be found here: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/. Please fill in more details. How are you using Quasar? What's your project like? Any repo I can take a look?. So you're not using the Quasar's starter kit. What you need to know is that quasar-framework package has no \"main\" field in its package.json, because there are 2 themes. Depending on what theme you want to use, your imports need to look like:\n\n```\n// using Material theme\nimport Quasar from 'quasar-framework/dist/quasar.mat.esm.js\n\n// using iOS theme\nimport Quasar from 'quasar-framework/dist/quasar.ios.esm.js\n```\n\nOr you can add a webpack alias to your setup to point to those files. You also need to import Quasar's CSS, based on theme.\n\nBut I highly recommend you use Quasar's official starter kit.. Available in 0.15.7. Hi,\n\nUse TouchPan directive for this. You got everything you need by using it to create your component: http://quasar-framework.org/components/touch-pan.html. Wish I could have time to guide you, but I'm on a tight schedule :(. ![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4665641/37300284-43c9a3de-262e-11e8-8ae0-b9f5f3fd4852.png)\n. Hi,\n\nNotice you're using `row-key=\"name\"` which tells Quasar to identify each row by the \"name\" property. But all your rows have the same value for \"name\" prop. You need unique values.. Example: https://codepen.io/rstoenescu/pen/LdpeLB. Working on it for 0.15.9. If someone complains about the new behavior I will go mad :). Can you share a video capture with what you saw pls?. Pushed clean workaround for iOS.

Which was added in 0.15.7 -> https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/releases/tag/v0.15.7. Available in future 0.15.11. All form components support `@input` and `@change`, including QPagination.

I am sorry that you feel this way. And I'm also sorry that you are giving up with v0.15, just before the v1.0, when the new architecture allows for seamless upgrades. Taking just a few minutes reading on the pages in Guide section of docs will allow you to understand the major step up that has happened to Quasar.

There's no other framework allowing you to write code once and then deploy as website / spa / mobile app / electron app with the flip of a switch button, like Quasar does.

The new architecture (which for devs just means moving some files around) hides away all the complexity that lies beneath it and lets us deal with it for you while you are sure everything \"just works\".

However you can very easily go on your own path and not use these components, but you can't just cherry-pick a layout component and use it by its own.

For lazy loading, check the lazy loading section of the QKnob docs.\n```html\n\n```\nThis is just syntactic sugar for v-model.lazy, but `lazy` modifier **for components** is not yet merged into Vue - https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6940\n\nNow the big picture: if you use v-model (notice no \"lazy\", which is syntactic sugar for `:value=\"model\" @input=\"val => { model = val }\"`) the model updates immediately. When user releases mouse (or lifts finger), then QKnob checks model again and if it changed, emits `@change` event. But due to 'v-model' (no \"lazy\") already previously updated model, no change is detected so it doesn't emits the event.\n\nSo, if you want lazy update, use the v-model.lazy equivalent (until v-model.lazy is merged into Vue) and you get the `@change` event. Otherwise, use simple v-model and listen for `@input`.\n\nNote that this applies to all Quasar components..

Yes, it is convenient to have a function to use instead of defining a template. But the first problem with pre v0.15 dialog was that it got very bloated and it looked like it is never going to end as more and more use cases appeared. So it really makes sense to lose all this complexity and allow full customisation by using a template. Furthermore, the biggest problem of them all was that due to how Webpack tree-shaking works (it's actually UglifyJS that did that): importing anything in the Dialog (QInput, QRange, QSelect, etc etc) means these components go into the bundle regardless if they are ever used OR IF DIALOG is imported from Quasar. There are numerous opened tickets on Webpack tree-shaking explaining this behavior. The end result is: all form components are bundled, regardless if you yourself are importing them or not. So a big \"no-go\" on this.\n\n2. You can still use promises... QDialog has show() and hide() methods which return a Promise, just like QModal.\n\n3. QDialog is just a special QModal and nothing more. While it sounds like a good idea to merge them, it's not. This would mean QModal gets bloated with unnecessary code checks. The end result: performance will suffer, especially on low end mobiles. Conceptually speaking, QModal is a basic building block component, just like QPopover for example. QDialog is not. QDialog is a wrapper on QModal to enable for quick Material Design alerts/confirms etc.\n\n4. Your example with specifying a body component sounds like a good idea at first. But then, how is the scope of MyCustomFormComponent linked to QDialog's one so that the Promise resolves with the form components' data? Furthermore, since you are still defining and importing a component (along with its template), how is this any different than creating a component which has QDialog in it?\n\n---\n\nV0.15 is more inline with how a Vue developer should think about its app and it allows for full customisation, as opposed to pre-v0.15 where everything had to be pre-cooked inside Quasar. Should some special needs arise in an app, developers can create a wrapper over QDialog (which exposes show/hide Promise returning methods) and in the end they can even use that to create their own \"dialog as a function\" custom use case.. Hi,\n\nI'm gonna reject this for Quasar core unfortunately. It's exactly due to \"webpack issues\" with it. Specifically, the `import('./../' + this.srcPath)` which will generate a chunk for each file in that folder and subfolder -- further reading: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-lazy-loading---code-splitting.html#Caveat-for-Dynamic-Imports\nMight be great as an external Quasar component though. I would add it to Quasar-awesome repo.. Hi,\n\nI'm gonna reject this for Quasar core unfortunately. It's exactly due to \"webpack issues\" with it.

Every approach has its flaws. Each browser has its own implementation of the file picker dialog behavior and it may even change in the future. There's no reliable method to determine when the file picker dialog gets closed.\nSo we recommend disabling the Escape key for Modals through `no-esc-dismiss` prop in scenarios like yours.. To avoid the Safari bug, specify date like this: '2018/03/19 00:00:00' instead of the ISO format '2018-03-19T00:00:00'. Unfortunately, there's nothing Quasar can do.\n.

Please read up on what computed properties are and how they work.\n2. You're defining \"toggle\" prop and actually using \"value\".\n3. `let obj = {name: 'test', toggle: true}; return Object.assign({}, obj)` -> why the extra Object.assign when you can directly return your object\n4. Don't expect Object.assign to do a deep copy. You got lucky as is since the props are primitives.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/waugrryy/966/. You're completely dismissing point no 1, which is the \"root of evil\". Computed properties should not be changed under any form. Construct a variable in your data() based on vuex store instead and change that.. Done for v1.0. Done for v1.0. Hi,\n\nVue enforces kebab-case for component props when using UMD.

Two different things. You're talking about selected but then mention about opening a branch.\n2. Are you using \"sync\" modifier for expanded/selected ? Example: `selected.sync`.\n3. Everything seems to be working as expected. http://recordit.co/DG21LgttfP\n\nPlease do provide a jsfiddle so I can correct your misunderstanding. Thank you.. This is the design, yes. How else would you differentiate between selected and expanded? When using selected, expand/collapse is done by clicking/tapping on the arrow. You cannot have them both on the same node triggering in the same way for obvious reasons.. Some explanation as to why this is obvious. We're discussing the trigger when using both selected and expanded. You can't have same trigger (click anywhere on a node) for both. Imagine this scenario: one node is already expanded but not selected. User wants to select it, so he/she clicks on it. It's now selected but not expanded anymore. What if the user wants both selected and expanded? It would be impossible. This is why QTree is using different triggers when both features are needed.. Hi,\n\nThis should have gone to docs repo (\nBut in any case, we're using a feature of Github which lets us set milestones. Click on it. Notice \"opened\" and \"closed\".\n\n![milestones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4665641/38125269-f69a0f4c-33f0-11e8-9b83-21e1cc26ae94.png)\n. Hi,\n\nThis is the design, yes. How else would you differentiate between selected and expanded? When using selected, expand/collapse is done by clicking/tapping on the arrow. You cannot have them both on the same node triggering in the same way for obvious reasons.. We're discussing the trigger when using both selected and expanded. You can't have same trigger (click anywhere on a node) for both. Imagine this scenario: one node is already expanded but not selected. User wants to select it, so he/she clicks on it. It's now selected but not expanded anymore. What if the user wants both selected and expanded? It would be impossible. This is why QTree is using different triggers when both features are needed.. Why not use the default scope:\n\n```html\n\ud83d\ude03\n```. Sorry it took so long. Totally forgot about this :(\nWill be available in 0.17 to be released in a few days.. If we get this removed, then QChatMessage becomes useless in 90% of the use-cases.. Available in 0.16.1. Available in future 0.15.11. Hi, Please use Discord or forum for questions. Thanks.. Hi,\n\nSorry for the delay. Quickly looked for a solution but I didn't find one unfortunately. Would accept a PR though.. Hi, Can you elaborate a little?. Hi, The `color` prop refers to the bottom bar, not the color of text. For that write your own CSS rule.. Nothing needs changing because:\n1. `color` prop for all components refers to the decorative color; in the case of QInput it's the bottom bar color\n2. What does a component property has to do with the way a custom Quasar color is defined? The way it's being defined has nothing to do in common with the purpose of the color property.\n\nPlease ask on Discord or forum for the piece of CSS code requested. Otherwise use Chrome/Firefox dev tools to see what selector you need to target.. You are totally dismissing point 2. I emphasize on \"the purpose of a property\".. ```js\n <q-page :style-fn=\"myStyle\" ...> \n\nmyStyle (offset) {\n  const size = `calc(100vh - ${offset}px)`\n  return {\n    minHeight: size,\n    height: size\n  }\n}\n```. Hi,\n\n1. `@slide-trigger=\"(oldIndex, newIndex, dir) => doSomething({oldIndex, newIndex, dir})\"`\n2. Define a method in your Vue file `doSomething(oldIndex, newIndex, dir) { ... runSomething({oldIndex, newIndex, dir})... }` then `@slide-trigger=\"doSomething\"`. Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/400. Explanation on proper usage: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/1803#issuecomment-374334078. You're using v-model. This is equivalent to `:value=\"model\" @input=\"(newVal) => model = newVal\"`.\nSo, as a result, `@change` does not gets called, since `@input` is emitted first, changes the model, then Quasar components emits `@change` only if model is different than the value being emitted... and since `@input` from v-model already updated the model, the value is same as the one emitted, so the `@change` event is skipped.\n\nEither use:\n1. v-model along with `@input`\n2. The \"lazy\" equivalent of v-model (`:value=\"model\" @change=\"(newVal) => { model = newVal; callSomething...() }\"`). Hi,\n\nIt's \"@hide\". Fixed docs.\nThanks for reporting!. Hi,\n\nIt would work for that backdrop, but those classes are used somewhere else too, and it breaks everything.. Sorry, but gonna close this.. Ok. Would you be so kind to provide a PR?. @Kunigaikstis merged. Will be available in v0.17.9 in a few days.. Hi,\n\nThis is out of Quasar's scope as it is a browser behaviour.\n\nHowever, you can prevent default browser behaviour by catching the TAB key on first and last focusable element in each slide. Example: https://jsfiddle.net/918htke2/3/ -- this example only prevents the TAB key on \"Next\" button and it's only a starting point. Things left to do: catch if SHIFT is also pressed and add handlers for first elements on each slide.. Hi,\n\nThis was a feature of v0.14 DataTable. Unfortunately, people wanted DataTable to be able to fully customisable, and the new architecture of the component does not allow this feature anymore due to technical issues. However, with a carefully crafted CSS, this is possible, but in app space, not Quasar code. Sorry for any inconvenience.. Thanks. Will get into 0.15.11. @mesqueeb You requested `style-fn` Function prop for QPage, remember? https://quasar-framework.org/components/layout-page.html#Style-fn. ESLint is a tool that highlights if you got linting errors. It's not part of the production distributables. It does not adds any code to the distributables. It does not interfere with the code itself. I fail to see the connection here.. Is this still reproducible with CLI v0.16? Try and use yarn with it.. Hi, yes, there is a rationale behind removing it. Use QChip instead.. Hi,\n\nThis outside of Quasar's scope at the moment due to the heavy-load as-is. Will consider it for the future though. Sorry for any inconveniences.. No such hacks are required. Put a reference on the QTable then on your \"request\" method check **if filter changed**, and if so, then `tableData = this.$refs.yourRefName.filterMethod(rows, props.filter)` and return early before sending data to server.. Available in Quasar v0.17.9.. Fixed by https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/pull/1946\nWill be available in 0.15.11. Hi,\n\nClosing this. openURL() is by no means required to keep account of the window's hash location. The main idea is for you to supply a full URL. So do just that. Make use of `window.location.hash` when you create those URLs.. Hi, Use `node-key` property to specify unique values for each node. If label is the same, then specify some other prop of nodes that is unique.. Dan, would you be so kind to PR this to docs too, pls?. Hi,\n\nThis is out of Quasar's control because tree-shaking is done by Webpack. And tree shaking is not fully working in Webpack 3. It's actually UglifyJs that does a kind of tree-shaking (more of a remove unused variables thing). There are scenarios that do not work correctly. Seems like Webpack 4 resolves this -- we have planned an upgrade to it near the end of the month.\n\nMore details: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2867. Thanks for contributing!. Thanks for contributing! This will get into 0.15.11. Hi, We are following Material Guidelines and this would deviate a lot from the specs, so sorry. But, it can be done in app-space by adding a few CSS lines.. Hi,\n\nThere's no reason for this not to work. Have you also imported webpack in quasar.conf? Otherwise \"new webpack.ProvidePlugin\" is not defined.\n\n```\nimport webpack from 'webpack'\n[...]\nextendWebpack (cfg) {              \n        cfg.plugins.push(               \n          new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n            $: 'jquery'\n          })\n        )\n      }\n```. Hi,\n\nThis is more of a question for Vue team. It is out of Quasar's scope. Single file Vue components are handled by vue-loader which does a lot of \"magic\" under the covers.\n\nIf you wish to not use .vue files, then:\n1. You still need to import your js file (do not simply add a script tag in your index.html)\n2. Manually register the Vue component (`Vue.component(..., { ... })`)\n3. You can either have a template specified (and yes, build.vueCompiler needs to be set to \"true\"), or use render functions directly.. It already grows to the available horizontal space... Did I miss anything? jsFiddle pls.. You don't need to npm install `copy-webpack-plugin`. It's already in node_modules due to Quasar CLI.\n\nThe webpack 4 CLI will have a build > chainWebpack () method which will make it reaaallly easy to change Quasar's default webpack config using [webpack-chain](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/webpack-chain). As a result, you'll be able to add your copy-webpack-plugin options there.\nLooking ahead, there's no reason to bloat the default config with this option.. Example:\n```html\n\n  Slot test\n\n  Slot label\nSlot error label\nSlot warning label\nSlot helper\n\n```\nAvailable in 0.15.11. Moved to the appropriate repo: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues/112. Hi,\n\nThis can be added in app-space..... This should be fixed in v0.17 (to be released in a few days)..

Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, we only support icon libraries that also supply a web font, and Feather Icons does not from what I've seen. Although, a [github ticket](https://github.com/feathericons/feather/issues/135) is opened, it is uncertain when the official web font will arrive. I am reluctant to go on and use unofficial web fonts due to the mess it can create regarding versioning and updates.\n\nFeel free to reopen this when Feather Icons releases a web font.. It will get in. Thanks for your patience.. Added QInlineEdit new component. Will be available in Quasar v0.17.10.\n\n\n\n\nThe custom filters can be done using QTable scoped slots.. @kerbo It's actually very user friendly and **non-intrusive**. Regardless, are you forgetting we're following Material Guidelines? https://material.io/design/components/data-tables.html. @sustained @kerbo \n\n* As you can see there are many options of editing. There's no golden solution as each developer has  custom needs. It's one of the reasons of why QTable allows for scoped slots, so use them.\n* An inline editing custom component is easy to create. So easy that it just doesn't make sense to add it to the framework. Just use two divs (one with content as text, the other with an input) and a v-if + v-else combination on them; a state variable that gets changed based on mouseover/mouseout or click (for entering editing mode) + capture ENTER/ESC keys on the input (for returning to non-edit mode).. Hi,\n\n1. Why does it matter what dev does? I mean, of what importance would this be? The dev server is not the production server.\n2. This should have gone to quasar-cli repo.. Hi,\n\n```js\n....\n```\n\nUsually most colors are darker, so the default case, unless `text-color` prop is specified, is to turn text to \"white\". The color/text-color props are important (and very easy to master) as they apply consistently to many Quasar components.. Strong word there. I think the color management is pretty clear and consistent:\n\n1. The most important point: Leaving aside Quasar for a moment, you are setting a property on a component. What are docs saying for that property? \"color\" can mean a lot of different things for a component. Imagine a complex component. Does \"color\" refer to the color of the title, the color of the subtitle, the background, the color of the border? I fail to see how this can create a precise expectation from a developer without reading component docs. Now back to Quasar, it has a consistent way of dealing with color/text-color props, explained below.\n\n2. The rule of thumb of is the combination of color/text-color + inverted for most components. \"color\" is mainly for background, while text-color is always obviously for the color of text should you don't like the default one. \"inverted\" refers to inverting the color, so setting as text color instead of background. You may ask \"Why?\". The answer is simple. It adds the ability to do things like: `` which easily matches Material and iOS design expectations, instead of writing one (or two) long ternary operators for background and text color.\nOnce you fully grasp the concept it makes everything easy. You just have to see the bigger picture and take into account the most used cases, which is setting a darker color on which black as text-color is not an option. Not setting a default \"white\" would force you to use text-color a lot.\n\n3. That combination represents a Quasar color used on components as color/text-color prop value. The components need to be prepared for both cases (background or text color). Again, look at the bigger picture and take into account point no. 2. I won't even get into details on the inner workings of components' CSS delicately handled so that the footprint is as low as possible (many times relying on \"currentColor\" as CSS property value).\n\nDoes that makes sense to you?. Hi,\n\n1. The model-toggle is Promise based. That's so you can also be able to use the reference to open/close then do something after the toggle is done. But developers also need a way to handle the scenario where you toggle while another toggle is in progress. Then the initial promise must be rejected for two reasons: devs can possibly use the Promise to do something when the promise fulfils (so we must stop that, as the initial toggle process is aborted), and secondly, devs can catch if the promise is rejected in order to abort or cleanup some process that may have already started along with the toggle. However, the initial Promise is used if the developer triggers the same action that is currently under way (show or hide).\n2. At this point you may think \"but there should be a way to avoid rejecting if the toggle was triggered by the v-model\". It is a way, but it's not the right thing to do, as before the model changing there may be a reference show()/hide() call which receives the current Promise. So the Promise must be handled and not avoided.\n3. There's no way to hide this warning, but in any case, it's totally harmless and does not break anything. Also, doing a \"reject()\" instead of \"reject(null)\" has the same effect, with the only difference being the thrown out value (undefined vs null).. Hi. Yes, because the print page has different size.. I think you are missing the point. The print page is still a page. So it's up to the developer to write a css [print media query](https://joshuawinn.com/css-print-media-query/) to tweak things however he/she wants if the default does not fits the needs. That's if the \"print-only\" or \"print-hide\" CSS classes are not enough. There's no golden solution -- and it's outside of Quasar's responsibility, as the scenarios are endless.. Framework code needs to be as generic as possible. \"display: block\" might work for your particular case, but what if the DOM element initially has \"display: flex\"? And it goes on and on and on :). The new material design is a living creature which gets frequent updates. Quasar will follow them as close as possible.\nIf you are referring the customisability and theming, well, we're dealing with web code, so yes you can already customise it! Stylus variables included, if necessary.. Hi,\n\nThanks for reporting this. Fixed docs. Will be available on next doc update scheduled soon.\nCorrect usage:\n\n```html\n\n\n      Notice slot=\"loading\".

User must have a way to tell which element is focused. This does not apply to mobile, where user can't use TAB/Shift+TAB.. @dmklsv maybe you didn't notice it. but even native browser `` DOM elements have it. Not designing with accessibility in mind is not the way to go anymore. Even [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) PWA tool has accessibility tests by default, even though the PWA concept doesn't intersects with accessibility necessarily.. Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, this is due to how Material icons web font is designed. It's a ligature font, as opposed to the other icon fonts that you can use. Material icons generate `icon_name` whereas the other icon fonts generate: ``. Until material icons are loaded, the \"icon_name\" is displayed, because there's no CSS yet to deal with these \"i\" tags. Now notice the \"class\" attribute for the other font icons; it doesn't adds content inside the \"i\" tag, so it doesn't affects the content.\n\nShould you wish to avoid this, it would be better to switch to one of the other icon fonts. Maybe \"mdi\" so you can still use material style, but please note that mdi font files are bigger than material-icons' font files.\n\nSorry, but closing this as it's out of Quasar's reach anyways..

Hi,\n\nMaybe I'm missing some point, but are you aware of the Boolean `toggle-indeterminate` prop? If you don't want the indeterminate state, just set it to Boolean \"false\"... I love the idea. Will do this, but after the SSR is available.. Thanks for this, I do need help as I'm overloaded with work, but in this particular case we'd just step on each other's feet as the \"mechanism\" for plugin configuration is needed for the SSR work too (and I'm currently on it).\n\nExpect the requested functionality in Quasar v0.16.1.. Will be in v0.16.1 through the new quasar.conf > framework > cfg. In this particular case for the Notify plugin, the defaults can be set at quasar.conf > framework > cfg > notify as an Object.. Thanks for reporting. Fix will be available in v0.16.1.. Because we switched to Fontawesome 5, which has breaking changes. From docs:\n\n### Cheatsheet\n\n| Name | Prefix | Examples | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| material-icons | *None* | thumb_up | Notice the underline character instead of dash or space |\n| ionicons | ion-, ion-md-, ion-ios-, ion-logo- | ion-heart, ion-logo-npm, ion-md-airplane | Use QIcon instead of `` component; Logo icons require 'ion-logo-' prefix |\n| fontawesome | fa[s,r,l,b] fa- | \"fas fa-ambulance\" | QIcon \"name\" property is same as \"class\" attribute value in Fontawesome docs examples (where they show `` tags) |\n| mdi | mdi- | mdi-alert-circle-outline | Notice the use of dash characters |\n\n\n.

Although I could not reproduce, that's seems like a problem with the rendering engine of Edge browser.... Please try with future v0.17.9. Some small things changed, so it might now avoid the Edge pitfall.. Hi,\n\nYou need to understand how each icon library works. Material is the only one differing from the other ones, because the font itself is using ligatures. What this means is that the generated markup needs to be `icon_name`, as opposed to `` for all the other icon libraries. So having this limitation, Quasar can only offer you a way to inject a popup (QPopover, QTooltip) as content of the icon (for Material Icons only), besides the string being used for the ligature font, because these components are placed outside of the icon tag in the DOM structure. **Normally**, you should need to inject any content in it. An icon is an icon and shouldn't contain any content.\n\nShould you have not ignored the issue template completely, I would have better explained this by forking your jsfiddle.. Updating your initial description is not nice behavior. It makes following this thread really hard. That's why we have the ability to comment here.\n\nYou're totally disregarding my explanation.

So style it accordingly. Blindly adding width won't work.. Who's making it harder than it needs to be? Quasar or web standards? You can't expect Quasar to magically sidestep web standards as they are implemented in browsers.\n\nWhat would indeed help and show a little appreciate for the framework is to hit the pencil on the top-right doc page (or \"Edit\" link at the very bottom) and add an example which you feel it might help others. It will only take like 2 minutes of your time. You probably imagine there's a hundred developers behind Quasar and they're lazy or something -- I don't blame you, because from the outside it's very hard to get a glimpse of what almost non-stop work on Quasar means (CLI, Quasar itself, docs, Quasar Play, testing on all possible platforms and in every scenario, vue cli plugin, ... and the list goes on). If every developer would help with just 2 minutes to at least improve docs that would be totally awesome. And we're on the same boat. Helping apps get better.. Thanks for reporting. Can you also post the component that does the redirect pls?. Would it be hard for you if you could create a minimal reproduction repo? It would help me fix this much faster.. Hi,\n\nThere is a \"backbutton\" event listener registered by Quasar too (to allow the closing of Modals/Dialogs/ActionSheets instead of navigating to previous page, and to exit app when on index page).\n\nFor v0.16 there's no way to disable this default behaviour, but in the v0.17 beta there is through quasar.conf > framework > config > cordova > backButtonExit: false --> more info on the v0.17 beta (do not use in production yet, though): https://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/2481/quasar-quasar-cli-v0-17-aka-ssr-developer-preview. Hi,\n\n1. Why open the ticket here and not on that repo? Note: that repo is not affiliated with Quasar organization so it's not maintained by us.\n2. I see last commit on that repo being \"9 Jul 2017\". It's also using a way old Quasar version (v0.13).\n3. There's the I18n for your app code and then Quasar I18n (for Quasar components). Do not confuse the two. https://quasar-framework.org/components/internationalization.html. Hi,\n\n1. On SSR, the store needs to be created with a function due to the singleton issue. So you are exporting a function returning the new Store instance instead of the Store instance itself. Quote from Vue SSR docs:\n\n> When writing client-only code, we are used to the fact that our code will be evaluated in a fresh context every time. However, a Node.js server is a long-running process. When our code is required into the process, it will be evaluated once and stays in memory. This means if you create a singleton object, it will be shared between every incoming request.\n>\n> [...], we are creating a new root Vue instance for each request. This is similar to how each user will be using a fresh instance of the app in their own browser. If we use a shared instance across multiple requests, it will easily lead to cross-request state pollution.\n\n2. So, don't import the Store file as you would for non-SSR. Instead, use an app plugin which receives the `store` parameter, OR use `this.$store` inside Vue components. The Router needs same change as Store -- instantiation through a function, and the function takes `store` as parameter, in case you need it.\n\nAll this because the Store and Router are specific to each client and we need to avoid the singleton issue.. Hi,\n\nPlease use Discord server for questions (http://chat.quasar-framework.org). Supply a jsFiddle because your description is not enough for us to give an answer. Thanks!. Hi,\n\nIt's actually a bad practice to put script tags in the head because scripts are blocking the execution (and download) of everything (any type of resource) that comes after them until they themselves are actually executed. So yes, please do put the script tags for Vue and Quasar at the very end of your body tag. The CSS tags can stay (and is recommended to stay) inside the head tag.\n\nAlso, big thanks for testing the beta version! Note that beta.13 is coming tomorrow.\n\n-Razvan. Have you enabled preFetch in quasar.conf?\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (ctx) {\n  return {\n     // ...\n    preFetch: true\n  }\n}\n```. I see your point now. Thanks for reporting!.

It means that the QSlider params are configured wrong and the component can't divide into equal length units.\n\nIn your example, we got a 14.89 interval, starting from 0, with a default step of 1. So QSlider shows the following markers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 14... then 14 < 14.89 so it needs to show another marker: 14 + default step of 1 = 15, which will be > 100%.\n\nEither:\n\n1. Specify a step which you know it's going to divide any interval into equal length units. Beware that JS has some funky errors when dealing with floating points (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1458633/how-to-deal-with-floating-point-number-precision-in-javascript)\n\nOR\n\n2. Translate the model back and forth into something that can easily be managed and divided. Like 0-100 or 0-1000 etc, depending on the granularity that you want. Then use the label-value to actually display a timestamp instead of the 0-100 value.\n\n  Example below. There are many ways to go, depending on your needs. This is just one.\n\n  ```html\n  \n\n\n\n  export default {\n    data () {\n     return { currentPercentage: 0 }\n    },\n    computed: {\n      currentTime () {\n        // here we convert the percentage in a timestamp\n        // for the QSlider label\n        return convertFromPercentageToStamp(this.currentPercentage)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```.

Hi,\n\nIf you're building SSR, then you can do that yourself in src-ssr/index.js -- which is where content gets served.

This is exactly how it should work. It would have been a bug if it ran both on server and on client on first page view. The purpose of preFetch() is to fetch some data and inject into the store, validate the page through store state (like is the user logged in etc etc) then redirect to some other route if necessary, all of which is already done on the server on first page view. The store state is injected automatically from the server into the client-side. So there's no need to \"fetch\" again as you'd just duplicate the same action, wasting resources and delaying page start.\n. Hi,\n\nYes. This is exactly how it should work.

The SSR needs to take care of the singleton issue, so your import won't work since it's global. However, for SSR I've added a Cookies.parseSSR(ssrContext) method (ssrContext is a param of app plugins or preFetch and available only on serverside). This method returns the cookies specific to the user's session request.\n\n```\nconst cookies = Cookies.parseSSR(ssrContext)\n// now use `cookies` just like you would do with Cookies Quasar import.\n```\n\nIf you want cookies on a Vue component, you can still use `this.$cookies` just like you did with earlier Quasar versions..

When you load data from a server, you're in charge of the pagination.

Notice the `request` method, which is the handler for `@request` QTable event, and the fact that the first request is triggered after the Vue component is mounted, through the Vue component lifecycle method \"mounted\".\n\nThe pseudo-code of how a `@request` handler should look like:\n\nrequest (props) { <<<< notice props here\n  1. set loading to true to notify user there is a data fetch in progress;\n  2. fetch data according to \"props.pagination\" props (so for a specific page, with the number of rows equal to your rowsPerPage), with the sorting and filtering as told by props.pagination\n  3. when data is ready, set QTable data with your received data, and set loading to false to tell QTable we got the data and we're no longer in \"loading\" state.\n}\n\nDoes this makes sense to you?. Glad you had it figured out. And thanks for thinking of becoming a Patreon. Every cent really helps out in making Quasar even better than what it already is!. There's no \"microphone\" icon. There's \"mic\" and there's \"phone\". Being a ligature font, Material Icons shows the mic, doesn't know to interpret \"ro\" (so weird space) then displays the \"phone\".. Done for v1.0 -- $layout-drawer-*. Short message: New Material in Quasar is coming. . Mostly done for v1.0.. Fixed in upcoming 0.17 release already.. That's safe. You can reuse it.. Will be available in v0.17.\nHandler: (verticalPosition, horizontalPosition). Hi,\n\nIt's `<style lang=\"stylus\">` instead of `<style type=\"stylus\">`.. Hi,\n\nI guess I missed explaining the following on the forum post on v0.17: preFetch only works for the components being used for the routes. So it doesn't go all the way down to all components, due to performance reasons.. Quasar is very responsive by design. It takes into account platform, screen size and more. When you prerender / create a static website you can't know beforehand anything about the client who will consume the page and that's a problem.\n\nWe've just launched SSR. Let's take it step by step. At some point I'll find a solution for this too. But don't expect it to be too soon as the focus will gradually become shipping v1.0.. The hydration is failing because what gets rendered on server does not match the client render. So check your code and see where you go wrong. Also read: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org/blob/dev/source/guide/ssr-client-side-hydration.md\nThere's plenty of stackoverflow etc on the net about this on Vue hydration errors.. Will be available in v0.17.9 by default. Thanks for reporting!. Closing as this is 100% a misusage in your app and not in Quasar. Please use our Discord for help.. Hi, Thank you for reporting with an empty description! :). Please provide a jsFiddle to speed things up and eliminate the guessing game. Thanks.. Can you supply a jsFiddle pls?. @lei-cao Hi, are you sure you are coordinating \"clearable\" with \"clear-value\"? \"clear-value\" is by default `[]` (for multiple selection) and `null` for single selection, and is matched against current value to establish if the icon is displayed or not. If you're using a custom value like an empty string (`''`) and haven't set the `clear-value` to same thing it obviously won't work.. Another sleepless night..\n\nThis is a bug in the CLI due to weird webpack behavior regarding CSS files. The order in which CSS files were included was wrong. Fixed and will be available in Quasar CLI v0.17.1.\n\nLeaving this open until I release this CLI version.\n\nReference for those interested: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/commit/89d24937fcfe704591e0411e48fbc21e10b66035. Released CLI v0.17.1. Hi,\n\nWould you be so kind to open the ticket on the CLI repo pls, since this is a CLI bug? https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues\n\nThanks!. @pjar Hi, \n\nFirst of all, github tickets are not meant for questions but for issues.\n\nSecondly, I won't duplicate Webpack's documentation into Quasar's. I believe this is enough: https://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-quasar.conf.js.html#Extending-Webpack-Config-Object\nYou take a webpack config object (generated by the CLI) and you change it to your desire.\n\nSometimes people get stuck because of making assumptions (example: `chainWebpack(chain){  chain.IgnorePlugin(....) }` without clicking on the webpack-chain link in docs to see how it works, no pun intended) so in order for me to post a definitive answer here I'd have to take all possible pitfalls (huge number, since webpack is so complex) of which devs might get into. Which makes it all much harder and if I do that it takes a whole lot of time from developing the framework itself, which I don't think anyone wants. Interaction makes all the difference (it shorts out the time needed to solve something) in a case like this and the Discord community is thriving. So please post a question there or get into the special Patron's channel to get your answer on the quickest possible time.\n\nThank you.. Hi,\n\nThis should go in Quasar CLI repo.\nFixed with Quasar CLI v0.17.3.. Have you enabled the preFetch feature? quasar.conf > preFetch: true. Any repo I can take a look, pls?. I was under the impression that `preFetch` does not gets called at all. In any case, for non-SSR builds, it is perfectly normal for App.vue's beforeCreate() and mounted() hooks to be called before preFetch(). But just for App.vue.\n\nReplacing boot plugin with preFetch in App.vue:\n```js\n// App.vue\nexport default {\n  preFetch ({ redirect }) {\n    // return a Promise if doing something async...\n\n    // and call redirect(false) at any point if you want to\n    // stop your app from getting rendered. BUT App.vue always\n    // gets rendered (with no router-view children!),\n    // otherwise Quasar cannot tap into the app's Router!\n  }\n}\n```. What's your boot plugin now? I'll just rewrite it with preFetch for you.. Hi,\n\nStop PM2, build, start PM2 again.. Thanks for reporting.. Hi,\n\nCan you pinpoint the exact steps to reproduce this, pls? The exact link would also be useful.. Hi,\n\n1. I thought you were talking about a Quasar error, but this is not the case.\n2. Documentation website is NOT written with Quasar.\n3. Documentation website will be written with Quasar soon, since we released the SSR support -- so now we can do it!\n\nSo closing as this is not important and will very soon become obsolete anyway. Should have been reported to the documentation repo (https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org/issues).\n\nBut thanks for reporting! Don't get me wrong.. `Vue.config.devtools` is automatically set to `true` when on dev mode. So check your code if it overwrites this value.. It won't be laggy anymore. Greatly improved its performance.. The way boot files (previously knows as plugins in 0.17) work in 1.0 should make your scenario possible to totally block app.. Thank you!. 1. Are you referring to the dev server only?\n2. Are you building SSR?. I'm not sure why nobody reads the Guide > quasar.conf documentation page.\nBut anyway, the answer to your question: quasar.conf > devServer is equivalent to Webpack's dev-server. More specific to your case: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-historyapifallback. Thank you!. Use `process.env.MODE`, like this:\n\n```js\nif (process.env.MODE === 'cordova') { .... }\n```. Available in next Q version (0.17.5). This is duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues/160\n-- Should have been reported to Quasar CLI repo as it's a CLI issue.. Any jsfiddle highlight the issue?. If using UMD, include the style tag for fontawesome before Quasar's one.\nIf using Quasar CLI, I just tested and it seems fine.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/9adLkf8o/\n\nFeel free to reopen if I missed anything.. @dcantatore Sure. https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org\nBut you can also edit pages in browser, without the need to fork + clone. Just hit the pencil at top right of pages or the \"Edit\" link at bottom of pages. Thanks!. This is the only component that allows HTML to be rendered. Otherwise it would be a useless component. It's developer's duty to sanitize the params.. The default UIWebView used on iOS is extremely buggy and Quasar cannot compensate all of webview's faults. This is why it is recommended to replace UIWebView with WKWebView: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine (this is only for iOS).. Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/805. Hi,\n\nThere's so much to comment on your fiddle. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna call it by its name: a mess. You're creating an unnecessary number of DOM nodes and it ends in a CSS spaghetti. Here's why:\n\n1. Are you trying to actually mimic QTabs with QRouteTab?\n\n2. You got:\n```html\n<q-toolbar class=\"gt-xs menu-header\">\n <div class=\"row justify-between items-center no-wrap header-container\">\n```\nWhy? QToolbar is already a flex row....\n\n3. Then even for that `<div class=\"row\">` you add a child to it with inline-flex (btw, Quasar has `flex inline` CSS helper class), which breaks the reason of existence for the parent...\n```html\n <div class=\"row justify-between items-center no-wrap header-container\">\n   <div style=\"display:inline-flex\">\n```\n\n4. Router-link over div.\n```html\n<router-link class=\"menu-link\" to=\"/usermanagement\">\n  <div class=\"menu\">\n    <q-icon name=\"supervisor_account\" />\n    <span>User Management</span>\n  </div>\n</router-link>\n```\nWhy creating an extra DOM node, when you can attach `@click=\"$router.push('/usermanagement')\"` or even:\n```html\n<router-link tag=\"div\" class=\"menu-link\" to=\"/usermanagement\">\n  <q-icon name=\"supervisor_account\" />\n  <span>User Management</span>\n</router-link>\n```\n\n5. You're also reporting an error on Cookies, but it's not used anywhere. Then you're reporting an error on `#tabs [data-lang=\"...` -- where is this being used / created?\n\n6. I don't see the min-height set anywhere, but why do you set the `min-height` to `auto`? It doesn't makes sense. At least set it to '0' to workaround a known flex bug in IE11: https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#flexbug-3 \n\nOverall, I don't get what you are actually reporting for Quasar and it feels like your proprietary code is not IE compliant, so closing this.. Hi,\n\n1. q-collapsible-opened/closed is a class for popup-type collapsibles exclusively.\n2. Why do you need a class for this?. @MohammedAl-Mahdawi \n\nRTL processing is handled by `postcss-rtl` package which uses `rtlcss`.\nHere is the usage: https://rtlcss.com/learn/getting-started/why-rtlcss/#processing-directives\n\nIf something does not works, please open up a ticket for those packages.\n\nFrom my own experience, it only works like this (just an example):\n```stylus\n.top\n    left 0 /* rtl:ignore */\n    right 0 /* rtl:ignore */\n```. 1. They might not be accustomed to Quasar, so they'll probably close it instantly.\n2. You might want to try recreating on a barebones repo with a simple webpack setup only, no Quasar. \n\nLet me know how it goes. Thank you!. Will be available in future Quasar v0.17.7. Thanks for reporting!. Thanks!. This is a misusage. `<span>` is an inline element. Apply `display: 'inline-block'` or `display: 'block'` to it, otherwise the browser can't animate it.. Quasar v0.17.9 will have **an experimental feature** which is called \"Containerized QLayout\" (enabled by adding the Boolean `container` prop to QLayout).\n\nIt allows to place a QLayout inside a box (so it explicitly requires a width + height). This includes the ability to use it within a QModal.\n\nExamples:\n```html\n<q-layout view=\"LHh lpR fff\" container style=\"height: 500px; width: 300px\" class=\"q-mt-xl shadow-2\">\n  <q-layout-header reveal>\n    <q-toolbar>\n      <q-btn flat @click=\"drawer = !drawer\" round dense icon=\"menu\" />\n      <q-toolbar-title>Header</q-toolbar-title>\n    </q-toolbar>\n  </q-layout-header>\n\n  <q-layout-footer>\n    <q-toolbar>\n      <q-btn flat @click=\"drawer = !drawer\" round dense icon=\"menu\" />\n      <q-toolbar-title>Footer</q-toolbar-title>\n    </q-toolbar>\n  </q-layout-footer>\n\n  <q-layout-drawer v-model=\"drawer\" :width=\"200\" :breakpoint=\"300\">\n    <div v-for=\"n in 50\" :key=\"n\">Drawer</div>\n  </q-layout-drawer>\n  <q-page-container>\n    <q-page style=\"padding-top: 50px\">\n      <div v-for=\"n in 50\" :key=\"n\">My page</div>\n    </q-page>\n  </q-page-container>\n</q-layout>\n```\n\n```html\n<q-modal v-model=\"modal\" no-backdrop-dismiss>\n  <q-layout view=\"LHh lpR fff\" container style=\"min-height: 60vh; min-width: 60vw;\">\n    <q-layout-header reveal>\n      <q-toolbar>\n        <q-btn flat @click=\"drawer2 = !drawer2\" round dense icon=\"menu\" />\n        <q-toolbar-title>Header</q-toolbar-title>\n        <q-btn flat @click=\"modal = false\" round dense icon=\"close\" />\n      </q-toolbar>\n    </q-layout-header>\n\n    <q-layout-footer>\n      <q-toolbar>\n        <q-btn flat @click=\"drawer2 = !drawer2\" round dense icon=\"menu\" />\n        <q-toolbar-title>Footer</q-toolbar-title>\n      </q-toolbar>\n    </q-layout-footer>\n\n    <q-layout-drawer v-model=\"drawer2\" :width=\"200\" :breakpoint=\"900\">\n      <div v-for=\"n in 50\" :key=\"n\">Drawer</div>\n    </q-layout-drawer>\n\n    <q-page-container>\n      <q-page style=\"padding-top: 50px\">\n        <div v-for=\"n in 50\" :key=\"n\">My page</div>\n      </q-page>\n    </q-page-container>\n  </q-layout>\n</q-modal>\n```. Only problem is that if you use a QInput (without wrapping it in a QField), then if the label isn't red it's very hard to notice the error -- the only marker available remains the red underline which is way too subtle. From a framework perspective, where all use cases must be taken into account, it's best to also show the label in red. I'm afraid you're going to overwrite the CSS in your case if you feel the whole thing is too redish...\n\nThank you for thinking of proposing a PR though!. Hi,\n\nA QPopover is used, which tries to get displayed on the available screen space. If there's enough space at the bottom, it gets shown there, otherwise it tries putting it up. Am I missing something?. I'm getting confused. It gets to be displayed down because after filtering there's enough space to display it there. The explanation is based on what I said earlier about QPopover.. 1. This is not a bug.\n2. The up/down placement needs to remain dynamic. What if user scrolls meanwhile? Shouldn't it reposition the popup? There's many UX details that only work correctly with this current behaviour. This design is solid.. @jost-s will implement your suggestion. Hi,\n\nCan you move this to the appropriate repo pls? https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli\nThank you.. Hi,\n\nSorry, there is currently no other way other than adjusting them one by one. I might enhance this for v1.0 though.. Hi,\n\nAre you looking for styling content only? Because the QLayoutDrawer gets the `q-layout-drawer-mobile` when it's in \"Mobile\" mode.. Event `on-layout` is emitted when drawer takes up space on layout or releases it:\n\n```\n<q-layout-drawer @on-layout=\"onLayout\" ....\nonLayout (space) {\n   // space is Boolean (true - drawer takes up space, false - drawer does not take up space)\n```\n\nAvailable in future v0.17.9. Use the `no-refocus` prop on the Modal.\n\nThis is part of the Accessibility, which eases using only keyboard to navigate.. Hi,\n\nPlease use our Discord or forum for questions. Thanks.\n\nMaking an exception just this once and posting the answer you are looking for: https://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/f8guomLn/.

Github is reserved exclusively for tickets on bug reports or feature requests. Questions are handled on our Discord server or forum.\n\nThank you.. That's a jsfiddle, that's not a vue SFC (single file component)...\nCorrect fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/n9edL1x7/\n\nAnd you've used `color` CSS prop instead of `background` which is not what I said:\n```\n.bg-customblue {\n    color: #4680A8;\n  }\n````. Thanks for reporting!\nFixed and will be available in 0.17.9.. Duplicate of #2105 . `dropdown-icon` available as prop in v1.. Available in future Quasar v0.17.9. Hi,\n\nThere's a million possible settings when it comes to ESLint. Making the init take an hour is not an option :)\n\nJust configure your .eslintrc.js with the respective rule that you want. In your case, the \"indent\" rule: `\"indent\": [\"error\", \"tab\"]`. https://eslint.org/docs/rules/indent. Hi,\n\n**This is scheduled for v1.0**.\n\nThis ticket is duplicate of another one (more complex) -- but don't have time to look for it to post it here.. Hi,\n\nTrying to not bloat components with all kinds of props.

Hi,\n\nQDatetime offers more information when it is readonly (like the Calendar) as opposed to QSelect which does not. So it makes sense to allow QDatetime popover -- while not also allowing any change to the model.. Will be available in future v0.17.9 (scheduled for this Friday).. Hi,\n\nThis has long been a subject of discussion and I'm not gonna reiterate it over again. Please search the forum for similar requests.\n\nIt can now be done by using [position: sticky](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) carefully applied to scoped slots or through CSS, targeting the right DOM nodes.. Hi,\n\nIt's where `hide-bottom` Boolean property kicks in to help you. https://quasar-framework.org/components/datatable.html#QTable-Vue-Properties. @HenriqueSPin Tomorrow (August 23rd) I'm gonna do a release on Quasar and I'd like to solve your issue too until then. Can you take a look at my question above please? Contact me on Discord to speed things up. Thank you.. It will work by specifying: `:rows-per-page-options=\"[]\"` in future Quasar v0.17.11.\n. Hi,\n\n1. This should have been reported to the CLI repo.\n2. Will be available in CLI v0.17.10 through quasar.conf > htmlVariables: { ... } -- scheduled to be released today.\n\nThanks for reporting.. ```js\n// quasar.conf\nmodule.exports = function (ctx) {\n  return {\n    htmlVariables: { title: 'test name' }\n```\n\n```\n// src/index.template.html\n<title><%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %></title>\n```\n\nWhat config were you adding htmlVariables to?. Thanks for reporting! Fix will be available shortly in Quasar v0.17.9.. @jcperez-ch Thank you for contributing! This will get into tomorrow's new release (Quasar v0.17.10).. Hi,\n\nThis works. Cannot reproduce your error.\nAlthough, taking it a bit further, your static data does not contain \"value\" props, which makes the input get emptied on any selection.. Or `<q-card class=\"q-ma-xs\">`.. It's `@add(val)` -- added it to the docs, it was missing.. Fix available in future Quasar v0.17.11. It's no breaking change. It always was this way.. Please redirect this to the appropriate repo: https://github.com/quasarframework/vue-cli-plugin-quasar -- note that for the SSR experience it is recommended you use Quasar CLI.\n\nAlso fill more info. Having an error at `js/main.9de4b3dd.js:1:775` is not helping at all. What options did you choose when creating your Vue app, then what vue cli plugins did you add to your project?. Hi,\n\n* Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/2011\n* This is due to our concern on XSS attacks. HTML content is no longer allowed.. @genyded Added back the ability to render HTML to the QSelect. Please be careful sanitizing the labels. Will be available in v0.17.10 (to be released in a few hours).. Please consider visiting our [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/quasarframework) if you haven't already. It would really help us. Thanks.. Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/2435. It does work. Both values have to be Booleans. Is one of them undefined?. Hi,\n\nExceptions should be caught by the developer because the developer knows what to do in case something fails. Indeed, if an error is not process by the developer, the app moves on otherwise it would become unusable.. Hi,\n\n`filter` prop can be a Function too. Example:\n\n```js\n// <q-select :filter=\"myFilter\" ....\n\nfunction myFilter (terms, obj) {\n  return obj.label.toLowerCase().indexOf(terms) > -1\n}\n```\n\nUpdated docs.. Thanks for reporting. Fixed it in future Quasar v0.17.11. Hi,\n\nSo these lines don't ring any bells? :)\n```\nyarn add v1.5.1\n...\nerror... The engine \"yarn\" is incompatible with this module. ****Expected version \">= 1.6.0\"****.\n```\n\nUpgrade your yarn :). Are you sure it's not your GPU at fault here? Can't reproduce your issue. The effect IS a ripple, but yours looks like GPU is not doing it right.. It's pretty straightforward CSS. I'm on a Mac too. Asked around, nobody can reproduce this.... There's the `getNodeByKey(key)` method on the QTree that you can use.\nAll your ideas seem very useful, but they break down performance unfortunately.. I added it and will be visible along the next update to docs. Just put a reference on your QTree and use the getNodeByKey(key) method. Giving you a link to a preview of what will get added to docs: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org/blob/dev/source/components/tree.md#vue-methods. Hi,\n\nEnable CORS on your API server.... We are investigating. A fix will be available in Quasar v0.17.11.. Thanks for reporting this regression. Fix will be available in Quasar v0.17.11. Hi,\n\n`row-key` refers to each row's unique id, not to a column name. So if `row-key` is set to \"something\" then QTable looks for each row's \"something\" prop -- which should be unique. By default, `row-key` is set to \"id\" (unless you change it) -- meaning it expects each row to have an \"id\" property.\n\nExample set of data when setting row-key to \"name\" (which must be unique for each row):\n```js\n       {\n          name: 'Cupcake',\n          calories: 159,\n          fat: 6.0,\n          carbs: 24,\n          protein: 4.0,\n          sodium: 87,\n          calcium: '14%',\n          iron: '1%'\n        }\n```\n. Thanks for reporting!. Hi,\n\nWill be available in v1.0. Thanks for suggesting it!. Fixed in 0.17.12. Quasar uses Vue CLI (and it specifies that in the console) to scaffold a Quasar project folder from Quasar template (through vue init command). If you have a project already, the only need is to install Quasar CLI and you don't need vue cli at all.\n\nOther than this, let me make it extremely clear that there is no connection between vue cli and quasar cli.. Hi,\n\nSeems like a much needed & very good addition. Please ping me as soon as I come back from vacation so I won't forget about this. Thanks for your efforts!. Hi,\n\nThank you for working on this. However, I chose a different path for v1.0, so closing this.. Fixed issue. Will be available in Quasar v0.17.13.. Hi,\n\nDisabling a QCollapsible means exactly freezing its state. Regardless if it's part of a group or not. However, after fixing some mistakes in your fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/tka5n2pj/. Will add `disable` prop to it.. Hi,\n\n\"browser\" is an unfortunate name as both electron and cordova still run the code in a browser :)\nHowever, you can add a variable in your scope and use it:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  data () {\n    return {\n       website: !this.$q.platform.is.electron && !this.$q.platform.is.cordova\n```\n```html\n<web-only-header v-if=\"website\"> ...\n```. Thanks for reporting! Fixed.. Thanks for supplying a PR. Changed prop name to \"popup-max-height\" though.. I think it's better for the props name to be as explicit as possible, otherwise in this case some devs might think max-height is referring to the input max-height.. Thanks for fixing!. Thanks!. Thx for reporting!. Hi,\n\nThanks for reporting! Just a note though: for CLI related issues please use the [CLI repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli)\n\nFix will be available in next Quasar CLI version (v0.17.16).. Tell Quasar to use your favorite icon: `this.$q.icon.input.dropdown = 'some-icon'`.. @anahoua16 if you remove the arrow you have a QBtn with a QPopover (v0.17) or QMenu (v1.0) in it... so use that.. Fixed in next Quasar v0.17.13. That's because it was pushed recently and it's part of next Quasar version.. Hi,\n\nI fail to see what exactly you want, because:\n\n1. You shouldn't need to change anything on div.q-carousel-track -- what would be the purpose?\n2. div.q-carousel-track is already a flex row.\n\nPlease reopen with a detailed explanation. Thank you.. Hi,\n\nLet me see if I got it right. You want the drawer acting as current overlay mode, but with a (transparent?) backdrop on which user can click in order to \"hide\" it.. Added a Boolean `dark` prop to QCard, to be used only when color is dark. Will be available in Quasar v0.17.13.. Please reopen with a jsfiddle (fork this: https://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/waugrryy/). Thank you.. `vue-cli` OR `@vue/cli` & `@vue-cli/init` is fine either way. It's being used only by \"quasar init\" command to generate the project folder.. Like I said, having either `vue-cli` or `@vue/cli` (+ `@vue/cli-init`) is fine and you'll be able to \"quasar init\" a project folder. If you already have a project or either vue packages are globally installed, you can skip this step.. This requirement will be gone in v1.0 anyway, which is next in line.. I've released v0.17.14 (through CLI v0.17.17) which has the fix.. Hi,\n\nYes, this has already been taken care of. Will release Quasar v0.17.15 shortly with the fix.. @trsiddiqui Ripples or not, every component that has a ripple integrated by default will also have the ability to turn it off (and also customize it!). Regarding performance, v1 is **a LOT faster** than 0.17. Regarding iOS theme -- you won't be needing it anymore as v1 is much more customizable and way more easy to customize too; also, almost each component has some props that you can use to mimick exactly the iOS looks.\n\nMore on each when v1.0 is released. Everything is covered, no worries!\n\n@mesqueeb In v1.0, every boot file (renamed app plugins to avoid the constant confusion between app plugins and Quasar plugins) can be boot.js if you want :) All boot files can be async now. So the short answer: \"no, and it's never going to be deprecated\". Quasar v1.0 beta released!\nhttps://medium.com/quasar-framework/quasar-1-0-reaching-for-the-stars-284e7716625a. Is this related to https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues/183 ?\nCause I just fixed it and Quasar CLI v0.17.19 is available.. Ok, then open up a ticket on the [CLI repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli), but offer a reproduction repo. Thank you.. Hi,\n\nAdded `persistent` Boolean prop for this effect. Will be available in Quasar v0.17.17.. Thank you for taking time for a PR!. I cannot reproduce on macOS Safari.. Seems like it is reproducing only on iOS Safari.\nIndeed, you need to set a height when using position and a QModalLayout in order for it to work correctly on iOS, otherwise we bump into iOS flex issues. No way to work around this unfortunately :(\n\nExample: `:content-css=\"{minHeight: '40vh'}\"`. Fixed in future v0.17.17.. Fixed in future 0.17.17. Hi,\n\n`import { Quasar } from 'quasar'` instead of `import Quasar from 'quasar'` when you are NOT setting quasar.conf > framework: 'all'. Done for v1.0. Thank you for supplying a PR!. Always specify the `lang` attribute if it needs a precompiler like Stylus, SASS/SCSS, etc.\n`<style lang=\"stylus\" src=\"....\"></style>`. @BenHayat Those are QBtns with QPopover with QList items. It is redundant to build a QMenu then add a million properties to it to be able to customize everything. Take a look at QPopover (works as direct child of any element/component). It's more powerful than what other frameworks have.. ```html\n<q-btn ...>\n  <q-popover ...>\n     <q-list ...>\n       <q-item ... v-close-overlay> <!-- @click.native or route through `to` prop -->\n```. Please reopen with at least a jsfiddle. Thank you.. The correct way to use extensions is: `extensions=\".jpg,.png\"`, NOT `extensions=\"*.jpg,*.png\"`. Thanks for the PR! It will go into Quasar v0.17.17. Hi,\n\nThank you for wanting to contribute!\nThe european Portuguese language already exists (\"pt\" in i18n/pt.js).. ISO 639-1 for Portuguese is \"pt\".\n\nNow for English there's the ISO 639-1 en-us (for US English) and en-uk (for British English).. Hi,\n\nWhat is the browser are you using in this case?. Hi,\n\nPlease reopen with more details. A reproduction repo helps us a lot in helping you, otherwise we are just wasting time for everybody.. Hi, this is duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/883. Hi,\n\nThanks for reporting.\nThis is fixed in v1.0 (under development at the moment; next version).. Hi,\n\nAre you referring to sourcemaps? Sourcemaps are handled by Webpack entirely. They had a lot of problems with browser vendors on them in the sense that some webpack sourcemap types don't always work (even though they should!). Might be worth taking a look at [webpack's devtool](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) and trying out different types until you find the right one for you.\n\nChanging devtool:\n```js\n// quasar.conf\n\nextendWebpack (cfg) {\n  cfg.devtool = '...'\n}\n```\n\nThank you.. Hi,\n\n1. This should have been reported on the Quasar CLI repo.\n2. It's already fixed in the new version and will be available shortly.. Hi,\n\nThis is scheduled for v1.0 (next version).. Done in v1.. Hi @marcelo-rebello ,\n\nThis is scheduled for v1.0. Please follow the duplicate link.\nThank you.. Hi,\n\nThank you for contributing! This will go into v0.17.17.\nWould you mind also doing a PR for docs too?. Merged. Thank you!. Hi,\n\nThis is related to JS Date() Object and some issues with it. In your case it takes into account local timezone when it gets parsed.\n\n**What you should do is**: use `/` as separator instead of `-`.\n\nGood example: 2018/10/05\nBad example: 2018-10-05\n\nReference for further reading: https://jj09.net/javascript-date-a-bad-part/. @Shaunchenzhaojin Use the `filter` Function prop on QUploader to filter out unwanted files to be uploaded -- this function is called when user adds file(s).. Hi,\n\nThank you for providing a PR. Currently focusing on v1.0 but will get back to this as soon as possible. Please bare with me.. Thank you for this PR. It will go into v0.17.18.. Hi,\n\nThank you for taking time for a PR! This will go into v0.17.18.. Hi,\n\nCreating a QSelect with no options has no meaning. Fill it with an empty array at least.. If you are using event.preventDefault() in your handler, use the \"mightPrevent\" modifier. Otherwise, for performance reasons (smooth scroll) the directive assumes you won't call preventDefault().. Hi,\n\nThank you for this PR. It will go into 0.17.18.. Hi,\n\nThank you for contributing!. Fixed some time ago. v1 beta.4 should have the fix.. Hi,\n\nWould you be so kind to redirect this issue to the [appropriate repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli) pls? Thank you.. Hi,\n\nThis has been fixed already in future v1.0. Thanks for reporting and sorry for any inconvenience.. Hi,\n\nYou also need to configure your webserver when using Vue Router's \"history\" mode: https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations. Have you also set the quasar.conf > build > publicPath ? Please look for help on our wonderful Discord chat server community. Github is used only for reporting bugs. Thank you.. Hi, thanks for this report. Will investigate and improve if it still needs a fix.. Hello,\n\nThat's because there isn't any? https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline\nAm I missing something?. Ok. You didn't specified the icon library so I assumed it is Material icons. For more info on how to use icons you can take a look at this cheatsheet: https://quasar-framework.org/components/icons.html#Cheatsheet. Hi,\n\nThanks for the suggestion. The good news is that I've already improved a lot in future v1.0 regarding QRange, including aspects that you suggested.. Thanks for redirecting to the appropriate repo!. Hi, Thank you for taking time for a PR! This will go into next 0.17.18.. This shouldn't be a problem in Quasar v1.. Hi,\n\nCan you please redirect this to the [CLI repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli)?\n\nAlso, do a `quasar info` inside your project folder and add that to the description.\nSeems like it's an electron + npm issue. Referencing same issue: https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue/issues/389\n\nThank you.. Hi, already done this for v1.0, which has accurate Material Design.. Hi,\n\nThis is called the \"rubber band effect\" on iOS. You can disable it by configuring your `src-cordova/config.xml` file. Please google for \"disable rubber band cordova\" and see what you need to add to the Cordova config file.. This will get much better in v1.0.. Hi,\n\nCannot reproduce with earlier iOS versions. Will check iOS 12 in a few days. Must be a new iOS webkit bug.. Hi,\n\n1. Please use Discord of forum for questions.\n2. Just navigate to the respective route. QRouteTab itself shouldn't tamper with history on its first render because this can easily produce non deterministic results, in some cases ending up in a loop if not being careful in user-space.. Fixed in v0.17.18.. Thank you for providing a PR! It will go into v0.17.18.. Fixed in v1.0. QTooltip works on another principle entirely now.. Hi,\n\nThis is because `transition-group` is an element itself, so breaking QList expectations on the content, while separator, dense, sparse etc are being applied with CSS selectors. Rather than using \"dense\" and \"sparse\" on the QList, use these on the QItem directly. In v1.0 there will also be a QSeparator component (usable anywhere, not connected to QList and QItem specifically).. Hi,\n\nDoes the path to your project contains any exclamation mark as indicated? Webpack does not support that.. Hi,\n\nUse the \"buttons\" scoped slot:\n\n```html\n<q-dialog ...\n  prevent-close\n>\n<!-- ....... -->\n<template slot=\"buttons\" slot-scope=\"props\">\n      <q-btn color=\"primary\" label=\"OK\" @click=\"validateAndClose(props.ok)\" />\n      <q-btn flat label=\"Cancel\" @click=\"props.cancel\" />\n    </template>\n</q-dialog>\n```\n```js\nvalidateAndClose (ok) {\nthis.$v.addFormFields.$touch();\n        if (this.$v.addFormFields.$error) {\n            return;\n        }\n   .....\n   ok()\n}\n```. Hi,\n\n\"position=top\" has precendence over \"maximized\". But the real thing is that it doesn't makes sense to use position and maximized.. because the Modal can either be maximized or positioned on one of the four directions. Are you doing this because of the animation? If so, you should create a Vue transition for it and use the Modal prop.\n\nHowever, on v1 there's going to be a LOT of predefined transitions that you can use out of the box.\nGonna close this BUT feel free to reopen if I am missing something!\n\n-Razvan. Hi,\n\nIt's hard to understand what you mean so it's hard to help identify your issue. Can you post a jsfiddle (as requested in the Github bug template) to actually see what your are trying to do pls? Thank you.. This shouldn't be a problem now.. Hi,\n\nKindly asking you to fill out more details. Your description does not help in identifying what you are doing (and how) and if something doesn't works as expected or it's a misinterpretation. Also, I cannot see the second screenshot. Please look for help on our [Discord server](http://chat.quasar-framework.org) first then post a detailed bug if it's indeed the case. This would help identify your potential problem. Thank you. . Running \"cordova run browser\" won't work as you'd like to. Use `$ quasar dev -m -T android/ios/etc` and it will pop up the emulator. That's not Quasar trying to display an image.. that's Cordova trying to display that image. In any case, your details are still too vague. Please use our Discord server so you can understand more of Quasar and Cordova. Thank you.. Fixed in v0.17.18.. This has been taken care of in v1.. Hi,\n\nThank you for this. Would you be so kind to provide a PR to docs too?. Hi,\n\nPlease re-route this to the Vue or Vue Router repo. This has nothing to do with Quasar. Thank you.. Also pls note you can use quasar-extras animations, which already have \"fadeIn\" and \"fadeOut\".\n\n```js\n// quasar.conf\nmodule.exports = function (ctx) {\n  return {\n    // ...\n    animations: [\"fadeIn\", \"fadeOut\"],\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<transition enter-active-class=\"animated fadeIn\" leave-active-class=\"animated fadeOut\" mode=\"out-in\" :duration=\"300\">\n      <router-view/>\n    </transition>\n```. There are solutions for this, like https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-directives/touch-repeat  in v1.. Hi,\n\nThis sounds like a UX issue on your app rather than a Quasar issue. Can't just change alignment to use \"right\" instead of \"left\" because that potentially breaks other people's apps.\n\nWhat I suggest is using a horizontal scrollbar on your Popover, or find some way so it doesn't need more horizontal space than a mobile screen width. Lastly, it would help us both if you reopen this ticket with a jsfiddle as required by the github issue template.. Hi,\n\nThanks for supplying a PR! Did you test on iOS/Android/chrome/ff?. Thx. This will go into v0.17.19. Oddly, I introduced same functionality today for v1.0 :). Hi,\n\nThis has to do entirely with how Vue works.\n\nYou are importing \"date\" from Quasar in the script section, but this doesn't mean Vue templates magically have access to the same scope as your script section. You need to have defined what you're trying to use in the template, always. Like make a computed property, or use a method and call it in template, or create an unobserved variable in the Vue \"created()\" scope. But you need to understand what each option does. If you need help, please use our Discord chat server (http://chat.quasar-framework.org).\n\n\n. Hi,\n\nQuasar Play app for iOS is not released by us so it's out of our reach. In any case, Quasar Play for both Android and iOS is not needed anymore as you can develop without it with the latest versions of Quasar CLI.. Hello,\n\nPlease use Discord for questions as indicated in the github issue template. Thank you.. Hello,\n\nPlease use Discord for questions as indicated in the github issue template. Thank you.. Way to do it: https://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/sza3qncg/4/\n\nFew comments:\n\n1. Quoting you: \"So is quasar promoting not doing things correctly and breaking accessibility?\" and \"my suggestion/recommendation to address things like this in the quasar framework\" --> No, Quasar was actually the first Vue framework working on accessibility. We take great pride in the components being accessible.\n\n2. This confusion of yours comes from the fact that you are misunderstanding the concept of a slot. You're using slot=\"footer\" yet you wrap it with a DOM element (`<form>`). Slots are strictly connected to the component upon which you are using them, and it's equivalent to saying: \"hey, component X, this slot needs this content\" then the component fills its own template (not your template!) with the indicated slot content. So, wrapping a slot with an element makes no sense... because it's a slot, it's not content that you can wrap or place in a specific DOM tree of your choosing for the component --- the component decides where to put it.\n\n3. Finally, some thing that you should be aware of regarding your comment \"Vue doesn\u2019t promote this behavior and neither should quasar\": You are operating with Vue components, not native form elements. `<form>` is designed for native form elements. In any case, this is not to be taken as \"Quasar components don't work with `<form>`\", because QInput, QButton (which actually even has a \"type\" prop: submit, reset, ...), ... do work. But just be aware these are components, not native form elements.\n\n-Razvan. Hi, this is planned for v1.0.. Available in v1.0 through scoped slots.. Hi,\n\nThanks for reporting. Made it work with String too for convenience, as long as the String has a number in it. Will be available in v0.17.19. Fixed in future v0.17.19.. There's an entire section on this in the docs (called \"Progress\"):\n\n* https://quasar-framework.org/components/loading.html\n* https://quasar-framework.org/components/spinner.html\n* https://quasar-framework.org/components/ajax-bar.html\n* https://quasar-framework.org/components/loading-bar.html\n* https://quasar-framework.org/components/inner-loading.html\n* https://quasar-framework.org/components/progress-bar.html\n. Will be available in future v0.17.19.\nAlso delivered through `quasar-extras`.. There is a way to do it. I'll push a commit soon.. @pdanpdan Can you port my v1.0 commit above to v0.17? Thanks.. Scheduled for Quasar v0.17.19.. Hi,\n\nNothing is wrong. Quite the opposite. Quasar tells the browser to fetch (but not yet execute!) the other chunks **when browser is idle** so that when your user visits the other routes the UI will have no delay (the source code for the other routes will have been already loaded from the webserver). This is a recommended and well known technique called \"preloading\" but should you wish you can disable it:\n\n```js\n// quasar.conf.js\nbuild: {\n   preloadChunks: false\n}\n```\n\nIt's in the docs --> https://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-quasar.conf.js.html#build-Property. Scheduled for Quasar v0.17.19.. Hi,\n\nQuasar has been tested for IE compatibility thoroughly. So isn't this a problem in your code? Screenshotting a cryptical error without us having a reproduction case does not help at all.\n\nPlease reopen with something that can be investigated. Thank you.. Hi,\n\nIt's not a bug. It's how it should be. You can use .getAttribute('value') on the $refs.input.. Hi,\n\nWell, in your case, how would it work? You're compiling the component, extracting its HTML at one point and injecting it into a `<div>`. Obviously Vue cannot update that node because it doesn't know about it --- there's no connection between the component and your `<div ref=\"container\"></div>`. What you need is to mount the component on that `<div>` directly.. Hi,\n\nYour QBtns are of type \"flat\", which is what the color does to them... Please revisit the button types. You actually want another type based on your description.. This will get fixed. Thanks for reporting.. Fix available in 0.17.19. Fix available in future Quasar v0.17.19.. Hi,\n\nThanks for contributing!\n\nUnfortunately, this is essentially breaking what the touch directives do. They need to stop scrolling if the user action described in each touch directive matches, otherwise you'd have (as an example) both swipe and page scroll -- which would be a UX bug.\n\nNote the e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation() there. Can't just add passive param just because it fixes one use-case while breaking all others.. Hi,\n\nThanks for contributing!\nIt's not a \"quick\" fix. It's actually the required fix. Made a few changes to it though. It is framerate independent (look at how the new position is computed). The bug was when duration left was lower than requestAnimationFrame rate (16ms) -- and so the last position was not set since it returned early.. You're missing the point. The method needs to **animate** the scroll. If browser takes more time to call the handler than the equivalent of a frame it means it's already busy doing something else. So using a timestamp instead of relying on requestAnimationFrame() can possibly make the scroll not animated at all (sometimes jumping really long distances). requestAnimationFrame() ensures that the page is updated right before the next page repaint and does not skip \"frames\". Also, any possibly multiple updates between page repaints are useless -- which can happen with a wrongfully set timestamp handler.. Fixed in future 0.17.19. Progress gets set to 100 when the actual xhr request gets closed, which in your case it didn't (yet).. Can you make a jsfiddle or something so I can reproduce your scenario?. ```js\nreturn this.$axios\n        .post('http://localhost:8080/api/logo', fd, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' } })\n```\n\nReason: upload-factory needs to be a function returning a Promise. Since you weren't returning anything, the awaited Promise never fulfils.. Hi,\n\nIf any of the min or max are fixed then this is equivalent to a QSlider, so doesn't quite makes sense to have those two options.... Thanks for taking time for this PR!. Thanks for reporting!. Hi,\n\nThere is a mistake in your example. Why are you changing the `behavior` prop of Drawer based on screen width? That's what `breakpoint` is for.... Hi @rob-64 \n\nThanks for keeping this up to date. I assure you this will go into v1. Sorry for the delay. Lots going on.. Sorry it took so long. Will be available in beta.11.\nMany thanks for contributing with this cool feature!. Added a nice example with vert tabs and QSplitter + QTabPanels.\n\n<img width=\"737\" alt=\"vert-tabs\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4665641/54483600-8eb71680-485e-11e9-94f1-a46b659c00b6.png\">\n. Done for future v1.0.. Duplicate of: Feature request: horizontal scroll #2163. There's `thumb-style`, `content-style` and `content-active-style` props for this.... https://v1.quasar-framework.org/style/theme-builder. Hi,\n\nPlease use Discord chat server or the forum for questions. Github is reserved exclusively for bug reports or feature requests. Thank you.. vue-i18n isn't Quasar's language pack. They are totally different things. Maybe the v1 docs make this more clear (https://v1.quasar-framework.org). Opening in new window:\n`<q-btn type=\"a\" href=\"...url...\" target=\"_blank\" ...rest.of.props.. />`\n\nIn this case you don't need \"to\" prop.. Will be available in 1.0.0-beta.9. Thanks for reminding about it -- was on the todo list for a long time but totally forgot about it.. Hi,\n\nWhat Android is this phone running?. Maybe I wasn't clear with my question so I'll rephrase.\nI was looking for more than Android 9. Like the full version. (9.x.y...). We are currently on a high workload preparing v1.0. You'll have to wait until we can thoroughly investigate this issue. Sorry for any inconvenience.. This is because Apple decided to use an old version of Safari when running PWAs, and NOT the Safari iOS installed on the mobile phone. Seems like that old version does not support Camera and Microphone, so there's no way around it, no matter what technology you use to build a PWA.... Hi,\n\nThank you for the detailed explanation. I'm happy to announce that this has already been taken care of in v1.0 codebase.. Salut, voi adauga. Dar nimeni nu e impiedicat sa doneze chiar si $1 daca vrea (sunt cativa care fac asta).\n\nHi, I will. Note that people can donate $1 as it is now also (there are already people doing this).. Fontawesome Pro requires a license, so we can't add it into a MIT project like quasar-extras.\nBut there is a section talking about how you can use fontawesome pro in the docs: https://quasar-framework.org/components/icons.html#Using-Fontawesome-Pro. Hi,\n\nGlad you figured it out.\n\nBut I don't really understand this part: \"was on the verge of quiting on Quasar [because can't use QUploader]\". I mean, if you don't like one component, then you can use whatever other similar components out there in the Vue ecosystem. How many other frameworks have an uploader component anyway? :)\n\n-Razvan. Hi,\n\nIt's not a vue-cli plugin. It's a webpack loader. So install the package and extend the webpack config as in their docs and you'll be able to use it.. I'm using Version 12.0.2 (14606.3.4).. I get tab focus alright.... Exactly same OS here too.. can get tab focus right. This is something really simple, getting managed by browser through the \"tabindex\" attribute...  if it fails then it means it's a P0 critical issue of the browser. It's out of Quasar's reach...\n\nPlease reopen with a more specific case. Otherwise can't reproduce and we're not going anywhere with this issue :). Hey,\n\nThere's more components in the btn folder :). Also, pls make sure it's for v1.0 -- I see some obsolete props there from 0.17\nThanks for your efforts!. Hi, Closing this. There's still 0.17 props here and there, wrong \"extends\" and a few other issues. Wrote the APIs myself. I understand you don't have time, but I appreciate the effort.. Hi,\n\nPlease use our [Discord](http://chat.quasar-framework.org) or [Forum](https://forum.quasar-framework.org) for questions.\n\nAlso, can you be more specific? Are you referring to https://quasar-framework.org/components/flex-css.html ?. Put common stuff into the mixin, then add specific details (like \"desc\" prop) into QDate/QTime.json.. Hi,\n\nI believe your previous ticket includes this, so gonna close this one.\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/2931. I thought you were referring to page up/down keys :). Thanks for contributing!. Hi,\n\nThanks for contributing!\n\nI'd have to disagree a bit here. The point of \"reset()\" is to just reset the index (one thing only). Normally, if the Infinite Scroll is stopped, you need to also call \"resume()\". Or am I missing something?. Hi,\n\nSorry for the delay. Working inhuman hours for v1.0 release.\n\nRegarding the PR, this would not be ok. At least, it should call `this.resume()` instead of directly setting `working` to `true`, otherwise there are scenarios where the component would end up in a messed up state. The `reset()` method is only supposed to reset the index. Maybe the name of the method is confusing. Starting or stopping the component must be done separately.\n\nWill take into consideration your previous comment for v1.0 though (the personal suggestions).. I'm just perplexed. I got all the files with correct naming on my laptop, yet I now see the repo has bad namings.. must be a VSCode bug (with which I renamed the files).. VERY weird. Thx for the PR.. It's not designed to work without the \"multiple\" prop, but will add support for that too in 1.0.. Hi,\n\nCan you add same thing in src/plugins/Notify.styl pls?. Thanks!. Will do.. Would you mind making a PR for this with your solution?. Sure it is.\n\ndevServer: {\n  open: 'firefox'\n}\n\nor open: { .... }. Posting from Discord where you also mentioned it (for others to see my reasoining):\n\n```\nhave you installed the cordova plugin for this?\nthere's one specifically for opening URLs\nQuasar tries to see if it's installed, and if not, it defaults to the JS way of win.open\n\nalso check your src-cordova/config.xml, you might need to tamper with this area:\n  <allow-navigation href=\"*\" />\n  <allow-intent href=\"http://*/*\" />\n  <allow-intent href=\"https://*/*\" />\n  <access origin=\"*\" />\nto allow links to your desired location\nbottom line, check Cordova docs on this\nand also WkWebView ones -- I know there are some limitations with it!\n```. Hi,\n\nThe `size` prop (works with String defining CSS units including unit name!) refers to the size of the label/icon (and button gets a padding relative to that size also). If you want to override the padding too then just set that on the button through CSS also (hint: you could use  \"q-pa-none\" CSS helper class to set no padding).. Hi,\n\nThe `size` prop (which DOES work with String defining CSS unit and unit name!) refers to the size of label/icon within, but the button always has a padding relative to label/icon size. You can override that padding too through CSS (hint: you can use `q-pa-none` etc CSS helper classes to remove/configure any padding, or write a CSS with your specific padding).. Hi,\n\nQBtn and QCheckbox already have a v-ripple attached to them by default. If you attach it again that doesn't override the inner ripple. In v0.17 this is not possible, but fortunately v1.0 (to be released very soon) has this ability to configure underlying ripple.. Hi,\n\nThis can be achieved in app devland by using the CSS [position: sticky](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Sticky_positioning). Right now we are working on v1.0 documentation so really really busy (otherwise would have popped an example), but pls do also Google for position sticky examples to understand how it works and how powerful it is. Unfortunately, this feature is supported only by the modern browsers.. This is a limitation when NOT using `expand-besides`.. Yes, did it already.. Got 2 reasons why this is not a good idea:\n\n1. It's against Material Design guide\n2. If it's Boolean, it should never be set as default to `true`. Otherwise in your templates, you must write the bulky version `:something=\"false\"` instead of a short: `not-something`.. They change the material specs weekly, so who knows :))\nI'd go with expand-besides on desktop and without on mobile (really important since small screens). But devs can pick and choose. `:expand-besides=\"$q.platform.is.desktop\"`. Nice adding the image plugin! :). Thanks!\n\nNote: use `<doc-installation>` component to describe install steps. `keep-color` is supposed to be working along with a color. It's by design. It **keeps** a color :). Fixed. Will be available shortly in next alpha release. Thanks for reporting.. Hi,\n\nThis is already done in v1.0.. Hi,\n\nTry to break the example up into different sections. And avoid putting description into the example. If you feel the need to put labels to describe what each thing does, then it's not a good example. So text outside, component into the example. You can ask Denjell for more info as I've explained a few principles to him on how docs should look like.\n\nOtherwise good job!. Gonna merge it as is and edit it. This should have been taken along with QCircularProgress, but now it's too late. The two are strongly connected.\n\nAfter I edit these pages (both QCircularProgress and QKnob), take a look at them to understand better some subtleties on docs.\n\nThanks for your efforts!. Hi,\n\nCan you split up the examples by sections pls? This one is too big. Kind of like the Button page.. Merged so I can more easily see it in action.. 1. min - max examples --> u're using different min/max and same model\nSome are min=0 - max=50, some are min=50 - max=100... so model is incorrect as it cycles from 0 to 100.\n\n2. No motion actually works; it jumps to the new value without animation. But there are so many values (100) and the increment is 1 and the cycling happens fast, so it's actually barely noticeable. To notice it, it needs less values (or higher increments), slower cycling.\n\n3. `:show-value=\"true\"` --> use short version `show-value`. 4 . I'd also get rid of the \"Interactive\" card. Doesn't makes much sense. Devs can click on Codepen link and play with each example already. Plus, on the bad side, to make that example work, you'd need a lot of watchers to normalize different props' values so that they are correct (some may become incorrect, like min/max and model out of range).. Example missing. I'll merge then add it.. Hi,\n\nThat's related to ESLint. Did you install all ESLint packages? In any case, without looking at your project folder I can't help you. Try to engange with our community on [Discord chat](http://chat.quasar-framework.org) or [forum](https://forum.quasar-framework.org) for help on your project.. Hi,\n\nThanks for contributing!\nPlease do this for \"dev\" branch instead. \"master\" is used for releases.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Hi,\n\nIn this particular case, it's about http://0.0.0.0:8080/form/input-validate (`yarn dev` in /quasar folder).\nEverything's obsolete here.. No, it can still be used. But it probably deserves another page in docs.. For now just focus on the internal `rules` prop as indicated.. No problem. Thanks for contributing! If you wanna choose something else it's ok too, just throwing that out.. Thank you!. Hi,\n\nThanks for reporting and also investigating. Fixed it for v1 with the commit above. If you need this fast for 0.17, would you be so kind to port this fix to \"v0.17\" branch?\n\nMany thanks,\nRazvan. Thank you for providing a PR! Will be available in 0.17.20. Hi,\n\nThe fix is good and I'll merge it, but can you make the PR on v0.17 branch pls? \"master\" branch is used for releases only.\n\nThank you for taking time for this!. Hi,\n\nThis can't possibly be Quasar's fault. Quasar configures your Cordova's config.xml and adds the `android-versionCode` to it, as per [Cordova specs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/#setting-the-version-code).\n\nIf the versioning is not right, then it's Cordova at fault here. Also, check the version on your production build.. Thank you!. The fix is safe. Relative position was there as a \"bonus\" anyway. If anyone needs it it can add it individually on the cell.. This is perfectly normal.\n\n* Headers are not \"selectable\" because they could get auto-selected while you click to change sorting.\n* The copy functionality that you are using is a browser feature, and it copies HTML. Depending on the program you paste it too, it interprets that HTML or not.. Thanks for reporting. Should be working now with @quasar/cli v1.0.0-alpha.7. Hi,\n\nv0.17 does not supports that. However, v1.0 will.. Beta in a few days.\n\nShould mention, for v0.17, apply this CSS to your Stepper: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/v0.17/src/components/stepper/stepper.mat.styl#L146-L157. Thank you!. Hi,\n\nFirst question is: do you really need a custom service worker?\n\nSetting for Quasar apps are set within /quasar.conf.js (https://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-quasar.conf.js.html#Options-to-Configure and the pwa config: https://quasar-framework.org/guide/pwa-configuring-pwa.html). It's a good start, but not there yet. Will need some individual info from each... will discuss more when v1.0 is closer to final build.. Hi,\n\nThanks for contributing!\n\nQuick question: what can you do having these improvements and you can't with current validations? Pinpoint it out. I honestly don't see the benefits. Otherwise it's just complicating things way beyond what they can be. Higher footprint, more code (so harder to maintain and possibly more bugs).\n\nThe async function may be a good idea. But it needs to stay sync unfortunately. Otherwise consecutive calls can be made and there's no guarantee that the methods will be fulfilled in the same order that they were called, which determines an unpredictable behavior.. The rules are functions. What more freedom could you want? :)\n\nCompare to another field and use vue-i18n for the message:\n```js\nval => val === myOtherField || $t('message.hello')\n```. the second one is an example of filtering, which means if it doesn't pass the filter it's not added.. Thanks for catching this!. While many may agree with this, it is imperative for people just getting to know Quasar to realise there is an install step necessary. So it is better than putting Install after Usage.. Fixed (will be live tomorrow). Thanks for reporting!. Thx, Josh!. Fixed. Thanks for reporting! Will be live tomorrow.. Thanks!. Thank you! Will go into v1.0.0-beta.1 tomorrow.. Duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues/209. Turns out it's a problem with \"ajv-errors\" package. For a temporary fix (until the owner of ajv-errors releases a patch), add this to your `package.json`:\n\n```\n\"resolutions\": {\n    \"ajv\": \"6.8.1\"\n  },\n```\n\nAnd use Yarn.. Reference: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv-errors/issues/26. Pushed a temporary fix for 0.17 starter kit. Please try now @yosa \nI do recommend you try the v1.0 beta starter kit instead (https://v1.quasar-framework.org).. Thank you!. Thank you!!. Thanks for catching this!. @godxavia Fixed the QInput error icon and also found QBtnDropdown had same problem. Fix will be available in quasar beta.2.\n\n@anhmv You haven't specified if this is 0.17 or 1.0. If 0.17, are you referring to [this](https://quasar-framework.org/components/icons.html#Quasar-Using-an-Icon-Set)? If 1.0, are you referring to setting a [Quasar Icon Set](https://v1.quasar-framework.org/options/quasar-icon-sets)? If I misunderstood, pls feel free to reopen. Thank you.. Beta.2 will have support for Themify icons.\nWill also think about how to extend this easily in devland without the need of a PR.. Fixed in beta.1 (releasing later today).. Just fixed today. Releasing beta.1 later today. Thanks for reporting.. Thank you!. Hi,\n\n1. beta.1 is not released yet. beta.0 is latest. Agreed that the https://v1.quasar-framework.org/start/umd needs a fix to point to beta.0. Fixing it right now.\n\n2. Where did you click on the jsfiddle/codepen links? They correctly point to 1.0.\n. Hi, Won't get into too many details, so this is a high-level overview:\n\nUp to 1.0 we were using the Quasar date utils, which is that \"momentjs-like\" functionality. It's good, but beginners can easily mess things up due to the buggy native JS Date object.\n\nWe also wanted faster rendering (so avoid parsing and reparsing JS Date objects), and also avoid problems when using SSR. In 0.17 the date component was rendered only on client side because otherwise there would appear hydration errors (time on server may be different than time on client). We wanted (and succeeded) in avoiding all this mess with the native JS Date object by using a String as model only.\n\nThe recommended way when instantiating a native JS Date object is to use \"/\" as separator instead of \"-\" to avoid the timezone issue. But this doesn't matter anymore for v1.0.\n\nWe got a big pile of work items still needed to be solved before we can take a decision regarding the format (together with you, the developers using Quasar), so please hold on until it comes the turn for this.\n\nThank you,\n-Razvan.

Wasn't aware that one option was better than the other... Ok, will see how to best apply second option then.. Using the second option now. Thanks for helping make this better!. I actually don't see any other languages needing this, so it's ok as is -- and the computed property runs faster this way.\n\nNo worries on your English. It's really ok. We got this done at the end and it's all that matters!. Fix available in beta.3 through new props (`content-class` and `content-style`).. Hi,\n\nPlease take a good look at all the examples. For some cases you need the model to be the Object itself (like if you use selection slots, but not limited to it) and for some you don't (for the latter, see `emit-value` and `map-options`). For best render performance, avoid `map-options` (and 'emit-value' as a consequence) and just use a subprop of the model (that holds the value) wherever you need to use what the user has selected.\n\nRemember that `options` can also be an array of Strings... again, take a look at the examples in doc.\n\nIf you need help, we welcome you on our Discord server. But read docs first and also notice the QSelect API section.\n\n-Razvan\n. Thank you!. Thanks for this PR! Will be available in beta.3. Thank you!. Hi,\n\n1. Don't use '@' as alias because that is always problematic with webpack due to the npm organization packages which start with '@'.\n2.

Please mention the beta version that you are using.\n2. For instance, the first issue was fixed in beta.4 (which you probably upgraded to).\n3. The second is part of the design (following Material Guidelines) and you can a) manually increase bottom padding of QInput or b) add top margin/padding to the element that follows or c) externalize the hint out of the QInput. Cannot have dynamic height on the QInput otherwise the animations between hint and error would not work.. Hi,\n\nFor RTL languages we rely on the community to guide us. If the community does not raise any issues then we can't know something can be improved.\n\nSo, **please do the PR**. With one small amendment: `persian` Boolean should go into the RTL language pack files under `date` (only for languages that require it). Then you can make the necessary changes to QDate by referencing `this.$q.lang.date.persian === true`.\n\nWill close this PR as it's more of a question, but looking forward to your PR!. You can freely use this in v1 as we are keeping up with latest Vue versions through `@quasar/app`. However, note that Quasar's `preFetch` is still more powerful than than Vue's own version..

Hi,\n\nIn order for an accurate Material Design on checkboxes, this had to be dropped. However, you could use QToggle with icons.. Hi,\n\nSince you are using a template for the body, you also need to include a column for the selection (wherever you want, or you can even not add it at all).\n\nSee: https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-components/table#Example--Expanded-row-and-custom-selector\n\n```html\n<template v-slot:body=\"props\">\n        <q-tr :props=\"props\">\n          <q-td auto-width>\n            <q-toggle dense v-model=\"props.selected\" />\n          </q-td>\n```.

Hi,\n\nYou can do this yourself in your app. In your Modals.vue:\n\n```js\nmethods: {\n  openDialog (payload) {\n     if (this.$refs[payload]) {\n        this.$refs[payload].show()\n     }\n  }\n},\nmounted () {\n   this.$root.on('showDialog', this.openDialog)\n},\nbeforeDestroy () {\n   this.$root.off('showDialog', this.openDialog)\n}\n```\n\nThen you can call `this.$root.$emit('showDialog', 'hello-world')` from wherever you need. Basically you'll be assigning Vue references to each QDialog, and you'll use the root component as event bus ;). Hi,\n\nThis has already been fixed and will be available in 1.0-beta.10. @mesqueeb thanks for pointing this out. Closing bug as the transitions are now set to 300ms.\nWill be available in beta.11.

Yes, it will be standalone too, for creating custom \"fields\".\n2. You won't be needing QInput or QSelect to be wrapped in QField. In fact, you shouldn't. In v1.. @simplygood I assure you 1000% that for QInput it can fully replace it. Don't despair, join our Discord and request a bit of help if v1 docs are not enough, although I doubt it.. Isn't https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-components/input enough? It has all examples there, including validations (internal or external).. @simplygood I'm not contradicting that. I already said it's going to get documented. It's available as we speak but it's not currently 100% \"curated\" to work with any content (doesn't mean it won't work, just that I haven't analyzed it for the other use-cases yet).\n\nPeople wanted v1-beta ASAP, and didn't get a chance to do my curation on it yet, so published without documenting it for this reason. But it will come soon.. Hi,\n\nThe `__index` prop is a helper. Helps to know at which index within your data you are. Useful (and just giving out a random  example) for when using slots and you want to add a button to remove the row (you need to know at which index to remove).. This is really a nice and useful idea.\nCan you test if it works correctly with:\n\n``` stylus\n.q-bar\n  -webkit-user-select none\n  -webkit-app-region drag\n\n.q-bar > *\n  -webkit-app-region no-drag\n```\n\nI'll create a prop for QBar specifically for this, but I need confirmation that it would work correctly first.. `spread` prop will be available in beta.10, for both QBtnGroup and QBtnToggle.\n\nExample that looks identical to what you want to build:\n```\n\n\n.my-custom-toggle\n  border 1px solid $primary\n```. I really want final v1.0.0 build to be fresh and clean, not bloated with different stuff. Sorry.. Sorry, I've commented on the PR rather than here. Check https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/pull/3502 for my comments there.. Isn't it \"options\" and not \"extendOptions\" ?. And shouldn't `typeof m.c.preFetch === 'function' || (...)` be surrounded by paranthesis? Otherwise the OR operation is unclear.. Yes, let's go with `options`. Also please do a test on SSR.. Should do the same trick with server-entry.js too. Hi,\n\nYes, it's been on my mind for a few days now. It will get back in beta.10.. Fix will be available in beta.10. Is this not enough? \n\n\n\nOr if you're still on 0.17:\n\n\n\n. They already are... Example from QCardActions API section:\n\n\n. Will be available in beta.10. Fix will be available in beta.11.. Devs should directly use `` tags or ``, and not openURL() in order to benefit from how Cordova handles this.\nIf it's not clear, it should be in docs. @nothingismagick care to add this pls?. Hi,\n\nThis has nothing to do with Quasar.. Thx!. From [Ripple](https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-directives/material-ripple#Introduction) docs:\n\n```\nWARNING\nMake sure that your DOM element or component has CSS position: relative or Quasar CSS helper class relative-position attached to it.\n```. this.$refs.modal.$once('hide', () => { ..... })\nthis.$refs.modal.hide(). Thank you. Will be available in beta.10.. Thank you!. Can you do the same with the other utils pages too, pls? @mesqueeb . Cheers!. Hi,\n\nThis is a valid concern, but it shouldn't be dealt from Quasar side. Initially, I didn't allow HTML to be rendered (in order to avoid possible xss attacks), but there were so many developers requesting the ability to render HTML for the labels that I literally had no choice and enable this feature.\n\nThe reasoning is that it's the developer's responsibility to ensure that the content is not susceptible to XSS attacks as with all HTML that comes from user input and gets rendered on the page. In 99% of the cases, the label content does not come a user input, so it's safe. But in the cases where the label content IS user input based, it's the developer of the app who needs to make sure it filters out any xss attacks.. References:\n\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/2011\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/2455. `pagination` needs to have `.sync` modifier as per docs.\nSet a variable in your data() and point to it. `:pagination.sync=\"myPagination\"`. Hi,\n\nBut you can use the navigation slot for that error too.. Am I missing something?. Ok, I'll add a slot for this.. QStepper slot \"message\" -- will be available in beta.11.. Hi,\n\nWhy would you use a QPageSticky inside of a QDrawer? QPageSticky is meant for the... page.\nJust use CSS on your button with `position: absolute; right: 16px; bottom: 16px` . Please reopen with a barebones repo so we can check, otherwise this ticket is going to hang on forever. Thank you.. This is a Vue devtools bug. I'll see if I got some time to report it with proper info on it.. Will be available in beta.10.. Fix will be available in beta.11. Hi,\n\nThank you for contributing, but please upgrade to latest @quasar/app in your app. The current commands are correct.. Fix will be available in beta.11.. Thanks!. Danke. \"The Dropdown is opened right of the splitter instead of the whole button group.\" --> this is how it's designed to work when using `split` prop.\nIf you want it for the whole \"group\" don't use `split`. This is not a bug.. Hi,\n\nI would be surprised this doesn't works. It's being used on the docs (which are Quasar SSR) too. I just tested with a brand new project folder and works correctly.\n\nPlease DM me on Discord. Thanks.. Hi,\n\nThank you for offering a PR. However, went with a slightly different approach, and fixed a glitch for IE11 too. I hope you don't mind.\n\nFix will be available in beta.11.. Hi,\n\nThank you for offering a PR.

Fix will be available in beta.11.. Hi,\n\nThe definition is that of an icon, so yes, it's the same. But the name of the prop differs, which is key to understanding it. Won't change all icon props definitions because of this. Props like \"icon-top\" or \"icon-message\" etc etc have the explanation in their names already.... Fix will be available in beta.11.. This is not a bug. This is part of the Accessibility work. It shows that the QSlider has focus. You can use TAB key to focus on QSlider and when it's focused, left/right arrow keys.. Thank you!. Fix will be available in beta.11.. Hi,\n\nIt is set to \"right\" default because most tables are considered to contain values (which is best to align them to right). So it's a helper and according to Material Design guideline (last time I checked). For columns containing text, you should set alignment to \"left\" --> which when converted to RTL will do what you want.. Works perfectly. Please post the example.. https://v1.quasar-framework.org/start/umd\n\nDo not use self-closing tags when in UMD. Please read above.. Also this -> https://v1.quasar-framework.org/start/how-to-use-vue#Self-Closing-Tags. Hit the \"Codepen\" button and you'll get a working UMD code that you can copy-paste.\nMost devs go with Quasar CLI which can have vue eslinting packages (which depending on the level that you select, may enforce self-closing tags). For these devs, it would be a shame to make them \"learn\" closing each tag as it would be a waste of time on their part.. Hi,\n\nWhat are you building? For cordova and electron build modes it doesn't makes any sense to use a publicPath. So are you building SSR?. You've updated your description. What would be the point in a publicPath for dev mode? You're on a dev server  developing your app. There's lots of complications if I enable publicPath for dev too that I do not have time to go into at the moment, but I can't really find any use for that.\n\nWhat you could do, since you are using another server (nginx) to redirect to the dev server is that you could configure nginx to strip down the \"/dev\" part from the URL when requesting Quasar dev server.. Also keep into account that Quasar is a powerhouse and supports spa/pwa/ssr/ssr+pwa/electron/cordova using the same codebase, as opposed to all other frameworks. Using publicPath for dev has serious implications and everything becomes overcomplicated for basically almost nothing.. At the end of the day, you can use whatever publicPath you need for the production build. And also set up a proxy for the /cms while developing (https://v1.quasar-framework.org/quasar-cli/cli-documentation/api-proxying#Introduction).\n\nPlease join our Discord server if you bump into trouble.\n\n-Razvan. And added label-value prop back for QSlider and left-label-value and right-label-value for QRange.\nWill be available in beta.11. Thanks!. Like Scott mentioned, we have an app extension for that. Check it out if you are interested.. Thanks!. ```\nGlobal packages\n  ...\n  @quasar/cli - 1.0.0-beta.3\n  ...\n\nImportant local packages\n  quasar - 1.0.0-beta.10 -- High performance, Material Design 2, full front end stack with Vue.js -- build SPA, SSR, PWA, Hybrid Mobile Apps and Electron apps, all simultaneously using the same codebase\n  @quasar/app - 1.0.0-beta.11 -- Quasar Framework App CLI\n  @quasar/extras - 1.1.0 -- Quasar Framework fonts, icons and animations\n  ...\n```\n\nEverything is correct. `quasar`, `@quasar/app`, `@quasar/cli` are different packages dealing with different things, so they have their own versioning. Which is explained in docs.. Hi,\n\nIt only makes sense for QIcon because it adds a specific padding according to Material Design guidelines. For all other components, there are the `q-p*` and `q-m*` CSS helper classes.. https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-directives/close-popup. See the Installation. Need to add ClosePopup to your quasar.conf.js. Thanks for reporting this.\nFix will be available in beta.12. Thank you!\nWill be available in beta.12. Hi,\n\nYou are misunderstanding QSlideItem. User should keep touching the screen (or holding the mouse) on QSlideItem. When he/she lifts the finger or releases the mouse, QSlideItem checks if the left or right parts are fully visible and in such case it considers that the user has triggered the respective action. If the left/right parts are not fully visible, it aborts and QSlideItem is reset into the initial state (covering the left/right parts).. Hi,\n\nThanks for contributing!\n\nThe missing npm commands are on purpose. Yarn is highly recommended as we've noticed a lot of problems with npm in dealing with the dependencies.. Thanks!. This actually returns `true` when checking `'2`, which is wrong.\nA better way would be: `return typeof v === 'number' && isFinite(v)`. Why adding a slot here? It looks wrong to me.. Are we in the situation where if slot exists then TableFilter should not be rendered? If so, wrap `` from below with this ``.. belowBreakpoint is not a computed property on purpose to avoid re-renders when layout width changes. This should be avoided.. Let's call it \"behavior\" better. It can take values: \"default\", \"mobile\", \"desktop\". Set its default to \"default\". Thanks!. Where is i18n variable coming from?. let's return true here. less code. let's return false here. let's remove platformReactive and directly use $q.platform.\nThis is something that definitely won't change.. do you think it would be better to have a \"mode\" prop instead of the two? it also offers room for expansion later & it will be less code. let's go with the two props. one thing I think it's gonna bite is that devs will want same behavior for QColor too. can we make this into a mixin and use it in both datetime and color? let me know if you'd rather do this only for datetime.. it would be a priority in order to maintain consistency. but it's your choice. however it will fit your schedule. I can do it tomorrow morning so you can focus on more datetime goodies if you want.. Can we say 50 is enough? Sometimes the user wants to abort.\nHaving a value of 10px is almost like not being able to abort at all.. Hi, Is `this.__emit()` here necessary? It might actually make the `@input/@change` be emitted twice.. Why is the focus() necessary? I assume the field is already focused when user pastes in content.. Missing fullscreen mixin API.. One string per example, otherwise you're defining N examples.. \"extends\": \"color\" for all \"X-color\" props and \"extends\": \"text-color\" for all \"X-text-color\" props. Check for other \"X-style\" props in the other API files and pls match it here. Missing \"examples\" breaks build.. I only see \"input\" being emitted. Mark it as private (`onInput` --> `__onInput`). Same for `onKeydown` pls as above.. is this outdated? cause there's no such import in QChatMessage.. this is ok. Quasar is configured to import everything already. See `all: true` above. This is redundant.. Why all this code when you could use a `this.$q.notify()` call instead?\nCookies are also NOT needed. This can be handled with LocalStorage to avoid increasing the length of each HTTP request (which will include this cookie).\n\nAlso, in this example, the QBanner goes under the sidebars and footer. `z-max` would have been more appropriate..",

    "mlenormand": "+1\n. What is the best practice to refer to the HTMLElement tab contents in the quasar-tab \"target\" prop ?\n1) Using raw id on each tab content element ? not optimal because of namespace collisions...\n1) use CSS class namespace (one on root div on the component + one for each tab content element) ? also not optimal because of namespace collisions\n3) maybe use some Vuejs-generated VM id ?\nThe fact that $els is not ready when using it in the props seems like a Vuejs bug, don't you think ?\nI think $els and v-el has been introduced for these kind of use cases.\n. It's ok now, it was bad use of the component, sorry guys !\n. Maybe add to the docs what you explain in this comment.\n. \nAdded this issue in quasar-site repo : https://github.com/rstoenescu/quasar-site/issues/3\n. Yes, you're right, we can just set data to the vm object backed by this Modal once it is instanciated. We loose the features of props (data validation, types, ...) but in my current case current case, the way you describe fits my needs. I think there is more advanced cases where passing a VM instance could be useful\n. Well, you're right, the sliding area is 15px width, and not 1 or 5 px. The drawer wait for a few time before being pushed to the right when user starts sliding so I was confused during my tests. So the sliding shown in the above screenshot was OK.\nNo bug, you can close the issue !\n. Prop \"label-placeholder\" for setting the placeholder to show\nProp \"icon\" for setting the icon name to be used\nThat's all, I don't see other improvements to make to this component. Maybe add autocomplete feature but I think this have to be thinked globally and implemented for all text input fields.\n. Yes, I ended up setting the index value to 0 and calling the handler myself. But it's not ideal because we have to provide the handle function with an index value and a callback function that set refreshing to false (forced us to know the implementation details of the component).\nresetList() {\n  this.$refs.infiniteScroll.index = 0;\n  var me = this;\n  this.loadMore(this.$refs.infiniteScroll.index, function() {\n    me.$refs.infiniteScroll.refreshing = false;\n  });\n}\n. Perfect !\nThere is a small problem when I manually reset the component (with my own code, not tested with your methods yet). Only a first load is done, and user have to scroll to load the following items. But maybe it's resolved by the fix you've just added.\n\nI tried to manullay call the \"scroll()\" method in my custom reset method, but I have the following error : \nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to execute 'getComputedStyle' on 'Window': parameter 1 is not of type 'Element'.(\u2026)\n. I was thinking more of a specific component to cover the frequent use case of a \"select\" box that shows the value selected from a list (basically the HTML select element). To implement this with the Popover component, we have to handle the click event on a list item, fill the label with the label associated with this list item. But I agree the Popover solution to handle this is more flexible, we can format items as we want, choose the right label, etc.\n. Perfect !\n. I'm developing a business app using Quasar v0.7 and I can't upgrade now to Quasar v0.8.2/Vue2.0 (it' on my roadmap, but after the first release to my customer). How can I patch my code with this bug fix without upgrading Quasar ? More generally, what are the steps to patch a Quasar app from bug fixes ?\n.

I couldn't find it.\nScott. @jkirkby91-2 - I completely agree. There is no clear reason to use TypeScript currently. \nScott. Actually, Vue works with Flow more than it does with TS. Vue actually uses Flows type inference checking, so if at all, I'd be more up for Quasar also using Flow in general to support type checking. That would be smarter, simpler and faster than trying to rewrite it to use TS. \nAnd, since Quasar has no type checking currently, there really is no reason for creating a TS template for PWA's. That in and of itself wouldn't really help TS developers to commit to the framework or rather it shouldn't, because Quasar in general doesn't support TS. \nScott. I'm also tight on budget currently, but if something I plan to let happen (not in the tech world) goes viral, I will certainly be able to help, possibly. Depends on what ends up happening. Cross your fingers. \nI've already done some tweeting for you and Quasar too. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott\n.

Could this be one of those \"community driven\" components, which could be added to a \"community components\" repo?\nScott. On the loading translations bit. I would say, only the currently selected language of the user (or default for guests, if you have them), should be loaded initially. I'd also venture to say, only the language phrases needed for the currently rendered components should also be loaded. Not sure if that matters or is feasible, but it is how I think i18n and L10n systems should work to be effecient as possible, especially for mobile. \nScott \n. I know this would mean extra work, but a \"quasarbin\" or a \"quasar-fiddle\" specially built with and for quasar would be even cooler. Is that what you meant Razvan? Or did you want to use a third party as suggested?\nScott . Sure. It is always nice to dream though. :smile: \nScott. Yup! The clarity in this project, not only in the docs, but in the website, Razvan's work and his polite, intelligent and patient manner with us \"customers\" is all a winning combination. That is why we've also decided to use Quasar as the basis for our project, which will be kicking off first coding Q1 next year. \nI know nice words don't pay the bills, but hopefully we can help with that later on, as we definitely want to support the OS projects we use too financially (should our project be profitable). It is only fair!\nScott \n. :+1:  on the segment component addition. \nScott\n. Great work on the Vue 2.0 migration and congrats on the release! Not too far away from a 1.0! \ud83d\ude04 \nScott\n. > Indeed I haven't seen this behavior on mobile platforms, so it might be just for desktop after all.\nFacebook has something similar to this on mobile, when there are new notifications in a user's news feed. You see a \"New stories\" button (or something like it), which gives the users a feeling of scrolling up to the top and refreshing the page to get new stories, when it is pressed. The user only sees the button, when she starts to scroll back up the feed and after she has been on the feed for some time (looked at multiple pages). If she scrolls down again, the button goes away. The button is also shown at the top of the screen, and comes out from the top, as the user scrolls up. \nOther than that, I haven't seen such a scroll to the top in mobile apps either.\nScott . https://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/qc0Lex7o/\nScott. On JSFiddle, try putting the cursor in the JS code box and hitting Ctrl + Enter. Or hitting the \"Run\" button upper left corner. \nFor some reason jsfiddle or rather the unpkg site isn't working right. \nScott. Don't you have to give the v-for some items? Are they being loaded and loaded past the bottom of the page?\nScott. https://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/zdv97kbm/\nScott. > (I don't actually own a smartphone, yes, yes I know...)\nGet out of here? Really? :smile: \nScott\n. I'd say it is covered in v0.14. \n\n\ud83d\ude04 \nScott\n. Right. Quasar's 24h version is only one circle of numbers. \nScott. Maybe a stupid question, but what should I be looking for?\nScott. How hard would it be to create something like this? \nhttps://jqueryui.com/themeroller\nI am not asking for it. I'd just like your professional opinion on the amount of effort it would take to make something like it. \nScott. Hmm.....ok. I guess I'll have to dig into the code to understand the difficulty. Thanks for the answer. \nScott. To be honest, my actual \"dream\" is a lot farther away. It would be to offer a special menu in the UI (needs a Quasar server of course \ud83d\ude09), and when you open it, you move into \"administrative editing mode\" (different from content editing). Basically, whatever page the admin is on, with this menu, she would be able to change her app in many different ways. The selections in the sidebar would be \"Format\", \"Style\", \"Data\",\"Translation\", and \"Behavior\". When a selection is clicked, the page highlights what is editable (with very smalls button next to each component) I could go into more detail, but for this discussion, the \"Style\" selection would hold the design details. When you click on a component, you get to change it's style like colors, fonts, etc.. Of course, the changes also cascade, or you can define a new class for that component. The changes are then propagated back to the server and are stored. \nThis CMS is sort of heading in that direction (but not quite \ud83d\ude09). \nhttp://demo.getrelax.io/admin/login\nusername: demo\npass: demo\nThis CMS is using React. Just rambling, but you guys get an idea where my intentions are heading.\nScott. This is a lot more like it! \ud83d\ude04 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7yHCoyozVk\nScott. \ud83d\ude04 In what way? As a developer developing such a tool or as a user playing around with the style of a site? Or both? \nScott. Right. A theming tool should be simple, but at the same time offer a \"path\" to the css. In fact, I believe any tool which allows a novice to alter stuff under the hood, should also lead the way to the actual code being altered and if at all possible, make is a learning experience. Because, no matter what, at some point that person (or someone for them) is going to have to code, to get exactly what he or she wants. \n\ud83d\ude04\nScott. @eminpala - check the docs. Material is one of two themes you can use and it is the standard theme. There is also the possibility of using different icon sets. \nScott. Hey Jon. Why was this closed?\nScott. I have to agree. The server side connectivity within Quasar depends on the server solution. For instance, I'd like to work on a Quasar-GraphQL API solution at some point. That would take Quasar in a totally different direction than someone who wants to use a REST interface. \n@rstoenescu - I would also hope Quasar itself is built in such a way, that any server-side solution can be plugged into Quasar without any bigger difficulties?\nScott. Something to dream about on my part is also an inline editing feature. :smile: But, I know.....one small step at a time. The datatable component itself is really cool! :+1: \nScott . Hi David,\nYou are definitely right in that such a project like Quasar lives and dies with its supporters/ community. \nThough, somehow you missed the forum. \ud83d\ude1c  \nhttp://forum.quasar-framework.org/\nThe link to the forum is front and center and on top of the project's homepage. It is also mentioned clearly in the README.MD for Quasar. Just pointing that out to show it shouldn't be easily missed. I can only think you are really new to the community. It is nice to see Quasar can get someone so excited to make such a suggestion without even looking a bit deeper. \ud83d\ude04 \nFor 3. Since there is a dedicated forum, the SO tag would be ok, but spreading the community out isn't necessarily a good thing right now. To me, it ends up watering down a community and it causes extra work. I'd say the SO tag is something to attack, when Quasar has established itself and there are more contributing team members to cover the multiple bases (i.e. Github, Gitter, the Forum, writing documentation, programming new stuff, fixing bugs....you get the point). \nCurrently, gaining traction among developers is the name of the game for Quasar. I believe, the best thing that could happen to gain traction best is to add an SSO for Github users to sign in to the forum to make the registration process much quicker. This has been asked for before, but is low on Razvan's todo list currently, as he (and hopefully @CookieJon?) are working hard towards 1.0.\nThe next thing is just spreading the word. If you are a user and somewhat a fan of Quasar, tweet or post on FB about new stuff (like the current 0.12 release!). Write blog articles explaining what you've learned or what you like about Quasar. Go to other communities related to Quasar's technologis (not its competition!) and mention it. Oh, and of course, contribute to the community and Quasar too. \nFor instance, I write articles for Sitepoint.com. Once Quasar goes 1.0, I'll be writing up an article about creating an application with Quasar, but before that, I'll be writing up an example app and also build it out to be a tutorial. I need to do the example app, because I am learning and I also need the experience to be able to explain the work properly. \ud83d\ude04 I believe that contributing to a community, even if it is a suggestion, requires some work in learning or research of the subject and/ or a lot of experience. When that is given, the contribution has a lot more value. \ud83d\udc4d   \nScott\n. If you want a really good Vue course to learn from, this Udemy course is excellent. \nhttps://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/learn/v4/overview\nScott. @thearabbit - No, unfortunately, it's not possible to jsfiddle with Quasar. \nScott. Because of how a Quasar app runs/ is built, it isn't possible to add it into such a site and fiddle or play with it programmatically directly. There's been discussion about creating a special kind of fiddle site for Quasar, but that is further down on the to-do list.\nScott. @Vaerum - in order to create a new PR, create a new branch from dev and add the new work to it. Then commit it and create the PR on the new branch. \nScott. @rstoenescu - So Quasar doesn't use Nuxt? Or is it integrated some other way? \nWhat would be great is a conceptual article on how Quasar does SSR under the hood. :smile: \nScott. @rstoenescu - I think that misconception might have come from some discussion in the past about Quasar partnering with Nuxt or something to that effect. It isn't important. \nSo the open question remains (in my mind at least), how does Quasar do SSR? :smile: Doesn't need an explanation here. A Medium article would be better, I think. :wink: \nScott. Glad to see you are still with us! \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Confirmed. The range slider does the same on Windows 10 Pro and Chrome.\nScott. Sounds like it may be \"contributor friendly\" too? \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Looks pretty sharp to me. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. I also thought the same way looking at the examples as they are presented in the Quasar play app (where you can check out the components), but once you get working with the system, you realize it is actually well thought out. Just think about an app like a Google+ kind of web app. \n\n\ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Interesting. I believe the navbar tabs should pull right, once the screen size hits a certain width. I could swear that was happening in my app. (I'll be honest I've been testing only for smaller screen sizes first.) I'll check again, when I get home.\nThe main content width looks like a good enhancement.\nAlso sidebar menus in a drawer component will be shown automatically for wide screens. You actually have to add \"swipe-only\" to hide it. \nScott . I can confirm with a <q-layout> the <q-tabs> do pull right on bigger screens.\nScott. > Why do you say they pull right?\n@rstoenescu - Good question......hmmm......\nI need to go and check that maybe I changed that myself. LOL! Sorry about that. I am forgetful like that sometimes. \nEdit: Or maybe I am using a toolbar? \nScott. That is pretty cool. \ud83d\udc4d \nIt might be hard to do, but could you also add a bit of perspective to it? Quasars float in space and it would give the image a bit more of a floating effect, if it were slanted a bit and not so round. That might also help you with the suggestion above too. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. I agree with the too many edges suggestion. With less edges, the logo would probably look sleeker, which Quasar definitely is. :smile: \nScott. I like this one the best. \n\nHow about some perspective? Is that possible?\nScott. I agree with the blue \"heritage\". I like the blue. \ud83d\ude04 \nI like the idea of the closing of the spiral (i.e. turning the white spiral 2-3 px to the left?), as Rasvan suggested, because it gives the logo a less flat look and more depth. If we (I \ud83d\ude04 ) can't have a  perspective that would be the next best thing. Could you please try to implement that suggestion and also demonstrate what it would look like down to favicon size? If it flattens out in smaller sizes, is that really a problem? That is the question that needs visual answering. \nI personally don't see the \"togetherness\" (merging/ ordaining) with the separate gear chunks. It looks more like separate gear chunks. How about this suggestion? Twist the spiral so much, that only one or two pixels are left. In other words, the spikes of the spiral go to much more pointed ends? \nAs for the \"black hole\", in the quasar galaxy metaphor, the dark grey looks good. I was thinking maybe also give it a slight radiant from white to the grey to a smaller black hole in the middle? That would give the hole more \"life\" and help with the depth of the logo too. If the logo gets flattened at smaller sizes, that isn't so bad, I'd imagine. Again, would need to see it though to judge. \nScott. Yup, nr. 1 looks the best to me too now. Thanks for the effort to illustrate the other ideas. \nScott. You know what would be really cool too? A spinner with that logo, where the spiral in the middle turns. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. It will arrive soon. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Support for Windows XP was dropped by Microsoft almost 3 years ago. \ud83d\ude2e \nScott. http://forum.quasar-framework.org/\nScott. Hi,\nPlease use either the forum or the discord channel for questions. You'll get answers there for sure. \nThanks. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Hey @hazzo, \nIs this still a problem? If yes...\nWhat were you trying to do, when you got the error? I've done some testing, but can't reproduce the error. Could you list the steps you are taking please?\nScott. Hey @dragospaulpop \nWhat were you trying to do, when you got the error?\nScott. @laurentpayot - yes. Start a new issue, if you think you've found a different problem.\nScott. Would you be interested in working on a GraphQL backend? In my limited capacity, I'd love to help out on that too. I think a GraphQL backend would make more sense from a web component standpoint. Most React apps are powered by GraphQL, simply because it makes the developer lives (both front and back-end) easier. \nScott. @claustres - Frayer?\nScott. Um, ok. But, with GraphQL, we are talking about the client-server API, not the persistence layer. Feather.js is REST. I'd like to suggest using Apollo instead of Feather.\nhttp://dev.apollodata.com/ \nhttps://dev-blog.apollodata.com/\nScott. I am not sure if this code is 100% correct, but you can get the drift about how components might look within Quasar with GraphQL. The code is a mix of example code from Vue-Apollo and Quasar. \n```\n\n\n Post list items \n\n\n        {{ post.title }} by\n        {{ post.author.firstName }} {{ post.author.lastName }}\n      \n\n\n\n\nimport { Loading } from 'quasar'\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag'\n\n// GraphQL query\nconst postsQuery = gql`\n  query allPosts {\n    posts {\n      id\n      title\n      votes\n      author {\n        id\n        firstName\n        lastName\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n\nexport default {\n\n  function show (options) {\n    if (loading > 0) {\n      Loading.show(options)\n    }\n    else {\n      Loading.hide()\n    }\n  }\n  // Local state\n  data: () => ({\n    // You can initialize the data here\n    posts: [],\n    loading: 0\n  }),\n  // Apollo GraphQL\n  apollo: {\n    // Local state 'posts' data will be updated\n    // by the GraphQL query result\n    posts: {\n      // GraphQL query\n      query: postsQuery,\n      // Will update the 'loading' attribute\n      // +1 when a new query is loading\n      // -1 when a query is completed\n      loadingKey: 'loading'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\nThe ability to actually declaratively define all the needed data in the single components and have the queries \"smartly\" be requested from the server and cached is a huge win for SPA on mobile. The other win for GraphQL is the server is also easier to manage.\nGraphQL was created by Facebook to overcome the long term issues REST APIs have with an application growing in size with multiple clients, which is what Quasar also is trying to support. Sure, REST can be ran on all different clients too, but it isn't nearly as flexible or manageable as GraphQL.\nScott . If you look at the comments, I actually did some counter argumentation to Phil's article. \ud83d\ude04 IMHO, Phil tells only a partial and biased story. For instance, he never mentions the introspection capability of the GraphQL server. GraphQL introspection makes the front-end dev's life worlds better. It also makes the backend dev's life easier too, because the schema is all self-documenting. You can even add comments into the schema.\nhttp://graphql.org/learn/introspection/\nAn example of how self-documenting introspection works is with Github's GraphQL API. \nhttps://developer.github.com/early-access/graphql/explorer/\nSign in with Github then click on \"Docs\" top right and browse the schema. This is standard stuff from a GraphQL server. \ud83d\ude04 \nIf you know about writing GraphQL queries, try it out on the left. You get autocompleted query syntax and syntax highlighting. Introspecting the schema is a standard feature of any GraphQL server. Oh, I said that already. \ud83d\ude0a \n\nit has a service abstraction on the server-side, which allows to be database agnostic.\n\nGraphQL is a service abstraction itself, which is absolutely data resource agnostic. I say \"data resource\", because you could also have a REST API as a data resource with GraphQL too. \n\nIt also provide real-time event management for the server and client side. \n\nSo does Apollo. \nhttps://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-subscriptions-in-apollo-client-9a2457f015fb\nFrom what I can tell, there is nothing Feathers offers that Apollo can't either, other than possibly a bit more stability and common knowledge, since both Apollo and GraphQL are relatively new technologies. Knowledge and stability are important, but I feel GraphQL overcomes those cons with it's big advantages. \n\nfocusing on a GraphQL technology is a strong opiniated choice that does not fit well with micro-services\n\nNow that there is a decent alternative to REST with GraphQL, going with REST is just as an opinionated direction. The only difference is, GraphQL is especially built for reactive UIs and REST API solutions aren't.  Sure, you can work with REST APIs and reactive UIs, but you have the issues of over and under fetching data and the much higher number of requests needed to gather data with REST. GraphQL was built to solve those problems. GraphQL is also predestined to work in a microservice environment too. This Stackoverflow answer better explains how GraphQL is a great gateway into a microservices system.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/38071714/graphql-and-microservice-architecture\nAs for waterline, there is also an adapter for GraphQL too. https://github.com/strapi/waterline-graphql\nI'll bet GraphQL will overtake REST as a client-server communication solution in the future, because it is that much better. If that happens, then sticking to REST will be the opinionated and legacy direction. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott\n. You are right. It definitely wouldn't be beneficial to have the two technologies mixed in one template. They should be separate, since they are, in essence, two competing technologies. \nFalcor is similar to GraphQL. GraphQL is a bit smarter though. \nhttps://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-vs-falcor-4f1e9cbf7504\nFrom what I've seen on Feathers, it is highly opinionated, because IMHO the more magic a framework has, the more opinionated it is. \ud83d\ude04 So, with that respect, I'd venture to say, Apollo is actually less opinionated than Feathers currently. For instance, there is no pre-built authentication in Apollo or the ability to pre-build data types or resolvers via CLI like you can with Feathers and controllers, etc.  \nCheck this out in terms of real time subscriptions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSLF9f13o2c\nIf I work on the GraphQL server template, would you be interested in also looking over my work? I am not the best JS programmer. \ud83d\ude0a Maybe we could cooperate that way and even offer two possibilities for Quasar users REST and GraphQL. What do you think?\nScott\n. Ok. I've moved the conversation over to the repo. This should be fun! \ud83d\ude04 \nEdit: Oops. Nope. Issues aren't turned on. Could you do that please? \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Yeah, I am also not to sure how best to incorporate two different server side templates (or more). \nThough, it would be cool to have a CLI command, which will add the wanted server package. Something like \nquasar init my-app --add-backend --express\nIf Razvan also likes the idea, I could work on that too, once I know how the templates should be stored. i.e. Repos or Branches (or some other idea). \nScott. Quasar's CLI is based on commander.js. \nhttps://github.com/tj/commander.js/\nIt doesn't have interactivity like yeoman does, from what I can tell. \nScott. For my own curiosity, what is the advantage of doing this?\nEdit: Nevermind. https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/518\nScott. > Does this framework allow usage as a standalone components?\nNo, currently it doesn't. \nScott. It isn't a framework really, when support for only using components is offered. When you get that, it is a component library or a component collection. If you are using these things, you will end up finding that you are building a framework around them. Or, if you don't build those framework like things, you'll be missing a lot of features frameworks offer, which make the developer's life better. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. @mesqueeb \nHey Luca,\nWhen you say \"it\", do you mean Quasar? If yes, is there a link to any documentation about the Nuxt integration? I've been keeping up on the release accouncements in the forum and didn't see anything about Nuxt. \nScott. Closing this one for #527.\nScott. Oh dang! I was hoping I could do it. Actually, I completely forgot I had made this suggestion. Thanks for adding it Razvan. One more nice detail, that makes Quasar rock! \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Ok. Though, are the tests automated and need those exact examples? \nBecause, all the examples are basically still the same, I just added one more button to show a customized spinner and I also added a click event to one button in the row of spinners examples, so all of the buttons do spin when clicked on. I also added a caption for the row of spinner buttons to show they are spinners. Nothing more really. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott  . WTF! Oh my. Naturally not what I wanted. Ok. I'll fix and re-PR.\nScott. I've added this in the right repo and made the corrections. This can be closed.\nScott. Hi Matthew,\nAre you suggesting you'd like to have all the data on each client's device?\nScott. Hi Matthew,\nAre you suggesting you'd like to have all the data on each client's device?\nScott.

The q-input component has a pattern prop, which isn't documented (yet), as it only currently checks for numbers. That would be the start to an input mask functionality and I believe that is the plan to have at some point.  \nOther than that, there is nothing to stop you from using v-model and placeholder to build your own. \nIf you want validation, vuelidate is recommended to use with Quasar.\nAlso, please use the forum or the chat for questions.

I believe the short name was used to stay familiar with Bootstrap's naming convention for the button class. A number of things follow Boostrap's naming conventions in Quasar.

There is a lot of program logic currently within Quasar, in order to get the two themes to work seamlessly together and dependent on the device used.

There have, for instance, already been several requests to add Bootstrap's design to Quasar. \nWhat I'd like to see is any theming logic abstracted out and given to userland so they can build their own designs with Quasar. In other words, I'd like to see the community build a Bootstrap or Ant or any other custom design and offer it as a plug-n-play extension to Quasar. I'm not sure if it is possible, but it would certainly be cool and I'd bet money it would catapult Quasar ahead of all other FE frameworks, simply because the devs/ users could pick and choose as to what designs to use. \nScott\n.

Any other theming has to be done at your own risk, meaning, some things just might not work well or elegantly, as you'd like. \nTo me, this is another case of wanting Quasar to be \"custom themable\", as in adding totally customized designs in addition to iOS and Material.

I am absolutely certain that would open up a really big ecosystem behind Quasar, because it's a regular thing in the PHP world with software like Wordpress and popular forum software.  \nScott  .

How about a value in percent for the locations vertically and horizontally? For vertical, 0% would be the top. 50% would be the middle and 100% would put whatever it is we are fixing at the bottom.

I don't like my suggestion much either, but I only made it to keep things backwards compatible.

Just to update this so everyone is clear what now can be done.\nUse obj => obj.some.nested.prop in your field property for the column.

I don't think that is possible. Maybe someone with more knowledge might know better.\nMy suggestion would be to set up a generic data structure and remap your data to fit it. \nScott. Hmm... that is too bad. \nScott. I'd venture to say, this needs to be its own component. Datatable has a lot of features, which don't really jive with an infinite scroll capability, or rather, the features become useless. I'm thinking about the sort and filter features, for instance. It shouldn't be too hard to build your own simple datatable with QInfiniteScroll.\nScott. BTW!\nIf you have an idea or suggestion, try to run it through either the forum. You'll get answers and feedback there for sure and also guidance on if the idea is a good one or not. When you get the proverbial thumbs-up, you can add your suggestion here with a reference to the discussion in the forum and it probably stand a much better chance to not get shot down.  \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Hi,\nAre you defining the columns before the component is rendered or after? If after, I believe that won't work. So, you need to draw on your data for the columns definition before the datatable is \"created\". In other words, only the rows are computed after the datatable is built. I am not 100% certain about that though, however looking at the component itself, that seems to be the case.\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/src/components/data-table/QDataTable.vue  \nAlso in general, we'd rather have only bugs and suggestions as issues in the repos.

Yeah, we can discuss your concerns and questions on the forum and if it is determined there is a bug, then you'll be requested to start one (or someone might even start one for you). \n\nI just wanted to reuse the same table for different sets of columns dynamically (by picking a concrete type from Select). I.e. to present different subclassed of a some parent class (a same subset of columns + some columns specific to a child class).\n\nYou can do that, I believe you'd just need to define all the columns you will need and use only the ones you want at the time you want them. This is all very theoretical on my part, so take it with a grain of salt. \nScott.

Create a bash script for the deletion, which also takes your files out first and puts them in a safe place and then deletes the folder. When you rebuild, reinsert the files. That is a quick guess on my part. I've never built a cordova app to be honest.\nScott. @valeriancure - did you work on this? \nScott. Not yet. Sorry, I've been really busy. I've got a long weekend coming up. I'll get to it then.\nScott. @marcelo-rebello - There isn't per se an exact aggregate functionality built in, but what is possible is to create your own table footer (called bottom in the docs), where you can add such aggregations as results yourself. \nThis has an example of a customer footer/ bottom.\nhttps://quasar-framework.org/components/datatable.html#Row-selection-Extra-top-bottom-rows-Loading-state\nIf you are looking for an aggregated column of data, you can create that yourself too, by simply creating the extra column and \"building\" the data out, before giving it to the datatable to display. \nScott. Why tedious and repetitive? You build out your own component with QTable in it one time. You just need to make your aggregation feature universal. \nScott . It is!\nScott. @rstoenescu - you know I've been out of the Quasar loop for a while now and I sort of don't really have any stock in Quasar anymore. However, this is back to a main topic that I was very interested in, as you also know. I may be wrong in what I am about to say, for lack of knowledge and experience, so do bear with me. \nCurrently, Quasar allows for the building of an app with two different themes. iOS and Material. This is top of the line and for mobile apps, it will cover 98% of application needs. But what about the rest? Desktop, web, etc?\nWhat needs to be possible is to also allow the dev to \"install\" their own or third party themes. So, in the CLI, there also needs to be something like....\nquasar dev -t my-own-super-duper-special-theme\nThat would be amazingly powerful. I realize too from working with the code last year, that this kind of flexibility isn't easy at all, from the way things were designed to begin with. However, having this capability would skyrocket Quasar to the top, because it means there is no lock-in to the current two  theme design. It would open up a world of capabilities.  \nVuetify is working towards this direction, but I think in the wrong way. They are making proprietary themes and trying to make money off of them. But, their general direction I believe shows a theming system is possible. :smile: \nMaybe something to think about for 2.0? :smile: \nScott. @zuck Hi Emanuele\n\nSorry @rstoenescu, it seems the discussion went a little bit off-topic.\n\nI hope my comment isn't part of that off-topic apology. I think my thinking is right in line with yours. However, I feel it shouldn't be up to the Quasar devs to build additional themes into Quasar. It should be the community doing it. \n@rstoenescu Hi Razvan,\n\nThe concept of Quasar \"theme\" applies to how components look.  It has nothing to do on what platform they are rendered: mobile or desktop. \n\nI understood this. And the problem I see is, what if someone wants a Bootstrap look/ theme for their application/ website, mobile app, desktop app, etc.....for example. \nQuasar has a \"lock-in\" here. I've seen code in Quasar that is purposely designed to switch between iOS or Material. I think this is a core design mistake. I just don't have an answer as to how to do it differently. What I'd like to see is the ability for Joe Designer to come up with a new theme and it be \"injectable\" throughout the framework.  \n\nQuasar themes are totally customisable through Stylus variables.\n\nThis is good. Though it only allows for the changing of design attributes of the two \"fixed\" themes.\n\nA webpage template refers to what is like Bootstrap templates. Like examples of a login page, examples of a showcase page, of a profile page, of a contact us page etc etc with its own design on top of one of the Quasar themes.\n\nYes, Templating is the next step. However, anyone creating these templates would also be stuck with just the two themes to work with. :smile: \n\nI was hoping the community would offer some help and they would build such templates. \n\nThis would need marketing, as in starting with some examples and driving the community towards doing more on their own.\n\n\"Material and iOS are mobile only\"\n\nThat isn't quite what I meant to say. The two specifications are built with mobile applications in mind. Surely, it is also possible to do web apps and desktop apps with them too. However, the choice of only two themes is still a hard coded limit.  \n\nPS: would love to have you back in the loop ;)\n\nI wish I had much more time to be in the loop. This would be so much more fun that what I am doing now.\nScott\n. The solution is to preset your model with the value you want it toggled to. Simple enough, especially since you need the model anyway to \"store\" the value. \nI am not understanding the \"dynamic\" forms or \"toggle order\" bits (either). So, maybe that is where we are missing the point. Can you explain the use case / wish better please? \nScott. What about i18n?\nScott. @pdanpdan - I meant l10n. It is text that is shown to the user as a selection. This would need to be translated for multi-lingual applications. Maybe that isn't a concern? \nScott . With the components available (range, datetime input or picker), couldn't you do this yourself?\nScott. I'm about where you are, when it comes to front-end development @kerbo. I was more a backend developer and Vue and Quasar has brought light into what used to be a void in frontend development for me, because I can relate to them both a lot from my past experience. However, JavaScript isn't the answer to all things on the frontend (as React would like us to believe \ud83d\ude04). There is still HTML and CSS to be learned and mastered. Once I have them under my belt, I know I will see things differently. \nIn the past, I would have also nagged to get such a feature into Quasar. But, I've also learned to trust Razvan's far greater experience and to know to let go of an idea, when he says, \"it isn't going to happen.\" \ud83d\ude04 \nAnd P.S. I'm part of their team now. For good or bad. \ud83d\ude0a \nScott . Interested in the reply. :smile: \nScott. Ahhh! \nI've added an addition to the docs. I hope it is correct. :smile: \nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org/pull/511\nScott. I've made a PR to fix the clearable icon appearing when no value is selected in QSelect.\nScott. Not sure if this will help, but have you looked at this?\nhttps://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-quasar.conf.js.html#Extending-Webpack-Config-Object\nScott. I've gotten the issues mentioned above solved. Well, at least it seems like I have. \ud83d\ude04 \nQuestion. I've also got code mixed in currently for the feature of having an array of available dates to choose from. I am certain I am making a mistake, as I should be doing two different pull requests. One for these issues and one for the added feature. But can I, this one time, do one pull request, once I'm finished with the feature? Pretty please? \ud83d\ude0d \nScott. @ikromy - No, it's not merged yet. It needs a review. \nScott. Hi Razvan @rstoenescu, \nHere you go: https://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/haoxb2ts/\nClick on the month, it should offer August and September.\nClick on the year, it shouldn't offer 2017.\nScott. Why aren't you using Quasar's CLI?\nScott. Ah. Ok. \nI just went through the steps myself using Vue CLI 3 and the quasar plug-in and it worked perfectly. \nMaybe a stupid question, but are you sure you have Vue CLI version 3? vue -V?\nScott. It's doable. Is it really necessary though?\nScott. @rstoenescu - Any chance you can look at this PR and give your 2 cents? \ud83d\ude04 I'd like to know if I should continue with the iOS version....... or leave it to the professionals. \ud83d\ude09 \nScott. Um...made a mistake. Closing.\nScott. Just a suggestion and what I think the improvement would need to be. If the popup goes north of the select, then it would make better UX sense to have the input field for the filter be at the bottom of the pop-up, instead of the top. I looked at the code and realize this isn't easy to implement though. At least not for me. \n\ud83d\ude04 \nScott . @jost-s - I think it would be a wee bit disconcerting for the user to see the selection popup shrink upwards away from the anchor point where the popup was first opened. Just a wee bit maybe. :)\nScott. Ahh..Ok. I get what you are saying now. And sorry, I didn't notice the drop below the field in either your images nor my playing with the playground. I had scrolled so the field was just above the bottom of my screen, so the selection was always on top. Now I see it drops below the field, if there is enough room. \nGlad Razvan understood. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. @Zhangshunyao - Thank you for the thank you. But, nothing has been done yet I believe. From my (not so extensive) knowledge of Quasar and front-end development with Vue in general, I highly doubt the changes I made above can be done in client-dev land, unless there is a way to override media queries in client-dev components. \ud83d\ude04 As I see it, this is a design decision within the QTimeline component.\nI might be wrong with that though.... \ud83d\ude0a \nScott. From what I understand of the request, the rows-per-page selection should not be present, if the userland dev wants all rows to be shown all of the time. \nHow about adding a \"-1\" in the rows-per-page-options array to hide the selection and show all rows, all of the time?\nScott. Yeah. How about this? If just one number is in the rows-per-page-options array it basically is saying to Quasar, this is the only number of rows to show and thus the \"Records per Page\" selection should be hidden too. So, if [25] is what is in that array, 25 rows will be shown. If there are 100 records, you'll get pagination for 4 pages, but no other selection for the number of rows to show.\nScott. Ok. Then then rows-per-page-options array just needs to be empty.\nScott. I've also added a PR for the docs to note the change.\nScott. Hi @kasperfish, \nWhen we discussed this, the idea was just to hide the arrow icon, when in read only mode. Adding another icon is actually possible already with the after prop. \nI've got both working too. PR is done. :smile: \nNow to see if the maestro also agrees with this change. \ud83d\ude0a  \nScott  . Hi,\nFrom what I understand of the newest meta plugin code, it is actually designed with a filter to avoid what you are expecting.\nI've tested with the newest version in both SPA and SSR modes and neither cause this error. So, I can only explain the error you are getting being possibly from an older version of 0.17. The filter was added at a later point.\nScott\n. Try doing something else, like \nbodyAttr: {\n  some: 'value'\n}\nAnd see if some=\"value\" is injected into the body tag. class and style are specifically filtered out to not be injected.\nScott. Well, at first I thought with SSR, that style and class attributes could be \"injectable\". I'll speak with Razvan about what was the actual design decision and get back to you. \nScott. I believe this is similar to: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/2435\nScott. Hi Nicholas,\nIn general, we'd rather have only bugs and suggestions as issues in the repos. So, please use either the forum or the discord channel for questions. You'll get answers there for sure. Please just have some patience. \nThanks. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. @nicholaszuccarelli - could you better describe what the solution was in the end please? \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. If you don't mind. Close this issue and open a new thread on the forum or post your question in Discord. :) If we figure out it is an issue with Quasar, we can open an issue with a proper description and reproduction of the problem.\nI am also not certain what the problem is, to be honest. I see strange text, but not the problem in general. The best way to describe a problem is to create a Fiddle for it too. :)\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/waugrryy/\nScott. Confirmed. \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/2hujktwr/\nThe promises in togglemixin for show() and hide() are triggering the show and hide events a second time. Testing, I commented the two lines out and the popover still works. I am uncertain of any secondary unwanted effects of doing this at this point.\nI also noticed the toggle function doesn't seem to be working as (I think) it should. It toggles the popover to show, but it doesn't allow it to hide like with QTooltip. So in general, I think there seems to be some sort of mixup in the logic for QPopover's showing and hiding. \nScott . @pdanpdan \nHey Dan. \nThanks for the explanation. I appreciate it. I see it was the emits in the component itself that were one too many. Cool.  :sunglasses: \nAlso on the toggle. Makes sense. I was almost certain I was missing something and persistent was it. Maybe add persistent to the the example in the dev/popover.vue?\nEdit: Nevermind. I see you did add persistent. Great! :+1: \nScott\n. @olegvakulenko - If you look at some real world 24h analog clocks with just 12 hours showing around the dial, the \"00\" hour is shown as either \"24\" or \"00\" and it is placed underneath the \"12\" hour position. The 1-12 on the outside fashions a normal analog 12 hour clock. And, as Dan pointed out, there aren't 12 hour clocks with \"00\" at the top.  \nSo, with the concept of \"findability\" often mentioned in the Material Design specs, the user should be able to quickly find what they are looking for on the clock and that can only happen with a regular 12h clock. In other words, with your suggestion, finding \"12\" o'clock becomes more difficult and I'd personally say more difficult than finding \"00\" in the current version too, which I believe your suggestion is trying to improve. \nJust my 2 cents and I hope that makes sense. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. No. See the docs here on Vue CLI. \nhttps://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html\n\nWarning regarding Previous Versions\nThe package name changed from vue-cli to @vue/cli. If you have the previous vue-cli (1.x or 2.x) package installed globally, you need to uninstall it first with npm uninstall vue-cli -g or yarn global remove vue-cli.\n\nQuasar works with a global Vue CLI 3.0 too. I guess that isn't quite so clear in the docs. I'll update that. \nScott. Also, in general, we'd rather have only bugs and suggestions as issues in the repos. So, please use either the forum or the discord channel for questions. You'll get answers there for sure. Please just have some patience. \nThanks. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. @fansanelli - It is!\nhttps://quasar-framework.org/components/internationalization.html#Dynamically-Changing-Language\nScott. Oops. Have no idea why I was thinking language. \nAs Razvan mentioned, The app needs to be built with the different themes and the user redirected according to platform. There is no dynamically changing the theme per app. \nScott\n. @AthosB - what's the reason for closing this issue? \nScott. @AthosB - Thanks for the explanation. Yes, there are the header and body slots. Theoretically you can use them to build out a new tree component with crud capabilities. \nScott.

It's just not called a menu. :smile: \nhttps://quasar-framework.org/components/button-dropdown.html\nNotice the built in router syntax sugar. I realize that isn't what you are looking for exactly either, but you can easily form those buttons to look like tabbed navigation. :wink:  \nScott. Yep. Looks much better and is easier to code with a q-popover.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/q2uohmLz/\nThis shows the OP's solution also works. \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/ojyg8f3u/\nScott. Um, there is no focus method on QSelect. There is only the @focus event trigger. \nWhat is it you want to accomplish?\nScott. Should the select be open for selection?\nScott. Also, if the form has a confirmation button, I would imagine that is a chance to add a method to open the selection?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/e0rutm7f/\nScott. Duplicate of #557\nScott. Dan was faster.... \ud83d\udc4d Was looking up the ISO Week. \nScott. > It's not related to Quasar, but to how javascript works.\nHmm.. so you are saying that any \"normal\" JavaScript developer would find the solutions you've presented in the fiddles, without any documentation? I know my experience in JavaScript is relatively small, but I find it hard to believe that those solutions would be generally known. There are also a lot of lesser experienced devs like me out there trying get Quasar to work for them. Such \"tips\" could still be useful. I also see props, v-model, methods, etc. as a component's API and knowing how that API can be put to use is part of good documentation, isn't it?\nScott. I get that. And I thank you for the lesson. \ud83d\ude04 \ud83d\udc4d \nWhat I don't get or don't believe is that a developer would know that such a comparison is being made in the component. They'd have to look into the source code to know what is happening (or in the docs), wouldn't they? \nThe fact I didn't know that two exact arrays don't equal each other in JavaScript has nothing to do with knowing how the comparison between the option values and the v-model value within the component is carried out.  \nI've seen a number of questions/ issues raised because, for instance, the dev would enter the multiple prop, but not add an array (even an empty one) into v-model. If they enter just '', Quasar stays silent until a selection is made and then an i.push is not a function error occurs . I added the need to enter an array as v-model in the docs, so this requirement is clearer. (this situation also prompted me to try out this PR too. \ud83d\ude04) \nSo, if devs can't figure out they need to enter an array for multiple selections to work, they surely won't know they can also have arrays as values for single selections. And, they most definitely won't know how to get the value to show up as an initial value with those array values, because they simply don't know what is happening within the component. Especially morons like me. LOL!\nThus, I think some documentation with your great examples would be good to have. \nScott.

Not sure this helps, but I did a fiddle for someone else's problem about putting a QInput inline with text. Have a look. \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/8go1wnku/\nScott. How about this solution? \nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/0yxvlyk4jl\nScott. I'm no expert, but this looks like a case for needing MutationObserver, so QTooltip knows it's parent was removed. \nCan't wait to hear what the experts say. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. @jean-moldovan - the idea behind the left and right icons is to give your input a secondary feature. If clicking on the icon were to open the popup and there is also some activity with the secondary feature, it would be bad UX. So, it is up to you. If your intention is to have the icon clickable for the same exact feature you've built for the input focus, then you need to give it that functionality as a secondary feature.  \nScott. You'll probably want to make this suggestion in the docs repo. \nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org\nScott. That latter question is correct. You can only build the themed version and redirect users to them. \nScott. Then use the forum. \nScott. Hi,\nNope. There is only the QEditor, which is WYSIWYG. \nScott. Hi,\nIn general, we'd rather have only bugs and suggestions as issues in the repos. So, please use either the forum or the discord channel for questions. You'll get answers there for sure. Please just have some patience. \nThanks. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Yes, normally there needs to be two different settings. Language and Locale. Language only sets the phrases used in the program for the set language. It is usually only two characters, like \"en\" for English or \"de\" for German (Deutsch). The locale sets the formatting or dates, currency and numbers and is 5 characters. For instance, en_US for the United States and de_DE for Germany. You could also have en_GB, which is for the UK. Usually, the first two letters of the locale denote the language, but you still need the two different settings, because someone might want Spanish as the language, but also want the en_US locale/ formatting. \nAbove and beyond that, there needs to be a currency choice too, but that is sliding into the realm of business logic and not necessary for Quasar to have. :)\nScott. Ciao Francesco. \nLooks pretty slick. Good job! :+1: \nScott. @snowyu - What problem are you trying to solve in particular? \nScott. Hey Oleg. \nThere are a few instances where components don't play right with QTooltip, simply because they weren't designed for, or thought of having, Tooltips. \ud83d\ude03 QChips is one of them. \nYou can get around this though. Check out this new/ custom Chip-Tooltip component. \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/4eaf7o2u/\nDisclaimer: Naming and coding is debatable/ most likely can be done differently/ maybe even better. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Interesting. In Chrome it works as it should. display: inline brings the button up to the same line. I'm terrible at css. I've used inline: table and it seems to work.\nScott. Hi @tmas,\nIf I am understanding your issue correctly, this is normal behavior. The v-model to open and close the modal is also controlled by the modal itself, for the actions you are implying should not work, if the parent is changing/ controlling v-model. \nThe features you are actually looking for are built into QModal, however. You should refer to the docs and the props lists of components, before writing any issues. It might save you some time. \ud83d\ude04 Of course, I am saying this assuming I am understanding your issue correctly. I hate to say RTFM, because it does mean I am making assumptions. If I am right, then good. To read the props list and the events and methods lists is always a good idea, because they are the features of the component. The API if you will. If you understand them all, you know how to work with the component. \nAt any rate, see if this is what you are expecting. I also used the minimized prop, so you can also see the no-backdrop-dismiss prop in action.\nScott. Ahh...ok. I think I understand now. I've edited my fiddle to show you how I think the functionality you are looking for can work. Notice I've changed to a simple v-model. \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/bwud0gjs/\nNote: v1.0 will be improving on this a bit too. \ud83d\ude03 \nScott. What is missing in the fiddle in terms of functionality? I'd like to know, to understand your use case better. \nI'd actually also do it differently. I'd create a modal with logic for the input form and the popup warning modal as a self-contained component.  \nThe best way to see the differences between the current version and version 1.0 is to clone the quasar repo twice and keep one copy on the dev branch and checkout the \"v1-work\" branch in the other copy. Then compare the two sets of components. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. Nice @metalsadman. Thanks for that! \ud83d\ude03 \nScott. This, or rather another solution to get it done, is going to be offered in v1.0. Any field type components will have prepend and append slots and you can add your own spinner or whatever you'd like to show progress. The release of v1.0 is going to be soon:tm:, so don't ask. :smirk: :grinning:.\nScott. Not sure, but maybe this will help with you with figuring out the loading handler logic. \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/smolinari/3f41720v/\nScott. https://quasar-framework.org/guide/\nScott. Um, npm is for publishing libraries, not full applications, which is what Quasar allows you to do. You seem to have a complete misunderstanding of how to work with Quasar and to be honest, I have no idea where to start to get you going on the right track other than, to again, point you to the documentation. \nhttps://quasar-framework.org/guide/introduction-to-quasar.html\nScott. > On step 5, I had created a Quasar App Plugin (quasar new plugin) instead of a component\nOh. That was a slight mistake on my part. Naturally it should be a plugin. I've changed the text above.\nScott. Was it poorly done? Or you didn't like? Or the merge stuff too much? I'd like to know what was wrong with it. \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. @karelbyte - You should refrain from such useless attacks and language.\nThe new date and time pickers are meant to be separate now, so to get both a date and time input. two different input fields for date and time are needed. Combining them with QInput to make such an input is easy.  \nhttps://codepen.io/smolinari/pen/MxaJBv\nScott. To me, this is another great example of what a third party app extension should be. I'm not asking it be done as one right now, but there will be many other devs coming up with the need for this same solution (or similar), should they too be using cookies (and they probably will be). \ud83d\ude04 \nScott. I have an iPhone 6 and it works perfectly. My wife has an iPad mini. Works perfectly. I have an old iPad, works perfectly. \nStrange.... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \nScott. @pdanpdan - What do you mean by \"with tabs\"?\nScott. Ah. Ok. I could have guessed that. I had tabs on my wife's iPad mini. My iPad and my iPhone didn't. Just tested my iPhone 6 with web sites in other tabs. No issues either. \nScott. Google translate: No se han encontrado resultados\n:grin:\nScott. I think we just need to add the prop no-backdrop-dismiss again. That should be all you need for your scenario. \nno-esc-key is the same as the old no-esc-dismiss and persistent is the replacement for prevent-close.  \nScott. Out of curiosity, what special needs do you have that Vue-router can't handle?\nScott. Can you note browser and OS? For instance, I don't have this issue with Win10 Pro and Chrome, Firefox or Edge.\nScott. Hey @tomers \n\nIn case the user closes the upload component\n\nDo you mean the added file? Or the component itself? If the component, how does a user close it? \nMaybe a codepen would be easier to work/ discuss about this?\nScott. Check out this app extension.\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/app-extension-dotenv\nScott\n . I was wondering if we should limit the range here. We could assume the client dev won't be using 1000's of dates in the array, because that would be kind of silly for the users to be selecting from. I dunno....\nScott.

(as it was in the 0.2 version and after updating to 0.6 it will still be there).\n. @beebase In project/src/themes/app.variables.styl  you can put:\n$typography-font-family = 'Arial', '-apple-system', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\nThat will use this font for both android and ios. If you want different fonts for each then put it in the respective stylus sheet in the same folder.\n. Yeah, probably Razvan can tell you where best to put your .ttf file. \nWhen you customize you need to follow the instruction in comments of the app.js file:\n/\n If overriding Quasar style, leave uncommented\n just the first line.\n If NOT overriding Quasar style, leave uncommented\n just the second line. This option make compiling faster.\n WARNING!\n Leave just one of the two require() calls below\n uncommented.\n /\n. @rstoenescu I see your point. It would be more like a 'plugin' for the really lazy among us I suppose. Feel free to close this. @dobromir-hristov Thanks for letting know. I will see if I can get it up properly as well.\n. @rstoenescu You're right, should have opened it there... But before I do so, do I understand correctly that you suggest that when I use webpack 2 combined with the karma&nightwatch build scripts that were used before it 'should work'. If yes, i will try before I open a feature request... . Tried... but could not get it workin... sorry.. Ok, just did.. @rstoenescu I would like to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-flag-icon but when I want to have a country flag as an icon in front of QField I need to reference it as an icon (can not use vue-flag-icon  element). How should I solve this? Especially to have it nicely outlined compared to QFields on top of it, it is important. Using the 'inset=\"full\"' property does not work when I put the  in front of the QField as it shifts the QField to the right.. Just now I found this which might be relevant here as well. I will dig into it.. Yeah, triggering offset with the @open event solved it.. Uh, do you maybe have a suggestion which event to use exactly? At the open event the css apparently is not loaded since when the list of cards gets larger I see the offset losing accuracy, so it is called 'too early'. When I use setTimeout(myFunction, 200) I get good results, I would prefer using an accurate event though.\nI tried:\n- using document.load \n- using vue mount\nBoth do not work. It seems maybe because the modal is already mounted, so it is not triggered when it opens...\nAny help maybe?. I already did, but keeps same problem.. @igorgo Thanks! My problem is not determining the accurate scrolldistance for the card. Using setScrollPosition(getScrollTarget(element[0]), myOffset, 0) works when I call it with setTimeout with a delay of 200ms (but this could still fail on a slower machine etc.). So I need to find the right hook which will give me when the dom is ready rendering the modal content. I could hack around it by running the getScrollTarget repeatedly till it gives a consistent value for e.g. three times or so, this is ugly though. Was hoping Razvan could maybe shed some light on this.. @rstoenescu Just to be clear: my code 'works': the scroll does happen. My problem is the correct triggermoment. I have to set a delay otherwise the dom is not ready or something.\nI did alter my code after your comment:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport {\n  scroll,\n  dom\n} from 'quasar'\n\nconst {getScrollTarget, setScrollPosition} = scroll\nconst {offset} = dom\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'myModal',\n  components: {\n    scroll,\n    dom\n  },\n  methods: {\n    open (clickID) {\n      this.$refs.myModal.open()\n      this.clickID = clickID.toString()\n    },\n    myScroll () {\n      const myFunction = () => {\n        const element = document.getElementsByClassName(this.clickID)\n        let myOffset = ((offset(element[0]).top) - 13)\n        setScrollPosition(getScrollTarget(element[0]), myOffset, 0)\n      }\n      setTimeout(myFunction, 200)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\nBut my issue remains the same. When I set setTimeout(myFunction, 0) the myOffset is not accurate.. @rstoenescu Pheew! That's it! Thanks a bunch!!!. What is the difference between new animScrollTo and old setScrollPosition?\n. Looked in to code. Looks like setScrollPosition with a third (duration) argument is identical to animScrollTo.. Ah! Got it working with:\nthis.$el.querySelector('input, q-uploader-input').click()\nMaybe still a good idea to have it in the API as in my opinion clicking the add button is kind of redundant.. I read somewhere that using http is more suitable for file uploading. Do not know whether that is good advice. Anyway I moved on and used uppy.io which is nice.. @donvie I am using uppy.io and tus-node-server and it works fine. This example might help in building your own component.. Expected behavior: when you set the size attribute of the button it shows all aspects (button, icon, padding,  ripple) in that size or relative to that size.\nActual behavior: when you set the size attribute of the button to a large size, the icon stays the same (i.e. small). So you need to fiddle with CSS to get it right.\nSo yes, as the stackoverflow example shows, you can get it right, but I expect this to be 'easier'.. Ah! Thanks for the fiddle! It shows my expected behavior indeed, which I do not have overhere. Mmmh, I wonder what is wrong on my side then... I got a workaround now, but when I find time I will see if I can see what is the problem on my side. As you can read in stackoverflow someone else also had to hack with CSS so I am not the only one.. You have 'the expected behavior' as well when you use webpack-babel compiled version (not UMD)? My setup is:\n- webpack-babel etc.\n- mdi icons (but I think I had same behavior using default material icons).\nEverything works fine except the behavior as brought forward above.. Ahum, actually I am working on an slightly derived version in which the upload is triggered instantly after picking a file. Although the actual upload is not done in the quasar webpage uploader it looks like it captures the thumbnail properly for all files and from the camera as well... I also noticed that in my version all files do upload properly when I first go out of fullscreen mode (so sort of 'tab-related' it seems). The camera upload still does not work (also not in non-fullscreen mode). Will try to solve this 'elsewhere'.. Haha! I think you're right... that's pretty much it I suppose! I must have seen it in the docs, but not realizing you can style the thumb etc. So then my request would be: make a more obvious demo example showing you can style everything in detail and have some 'default' styles maybe.\nAnyway, I am really happy to know this and I am gonna seriously style my ugly scrollbars!!

    "spectrolite": "Can we have any way to control this behaviour ?\nI see how it can be useful in many cases. But I've already encountered a couple cases where it is not desirable (in the same app). It would be great if we could toggle this behaviour easily either at the router level, or even (better than nothing) at the page/component level.. That would be great, esp. for the web mobile platform where people aren't always expecting swipe actions to be available (but quasar handles it great). I wish I had a simple way to attach a UI tip overlay to a tag, and show a curved arrow and/or a little hand with pointed finger and a few words.... Is there still something on the roadmap here? It seems the current quasar-extras covers this issue pretty well.. This would be real cool, can we somehow do it with 0.14 beta already ?. there\u2019s also a nice Vue plugin in the meantime\u2026\nhttps://github.com/probil/v-mask \u2026 but until #723 is integrated I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll work that easily with q-input. A custom directive like this one could solve it elegantly in the meantime https://jsfiddle.net/0Lgb6r3s/\nIt uses jQuery, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no big deal to adapt the code to do without that library.. A lot of people already spent their time defining all this for us, and you can see a pretty good explanation here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date. the info below is to be taken with a grain of salt and probably partially inaccurate, but gives a rough idea of the spread of Monday-first vs Sunday-first throughout the world:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/35hb3a/first_day_of_the_week_in_different_countries/. according to http://beta.quasar-framework.org/components/handling-js-date.html#Format-for-display\nwe can format a date using ww or simply w if you don't need 0-padding to output the week of year.\nWe can also get it like this date.getWeekOfYear(anyDay)\nbut we have no way to specify a date by year + week\nmore specifically, week is absent from \naddToDate()\nsubtractFromDate()\nadjustDate()\nwhich all accept already : \n-milliseconds \n-seconds\n-minutes\n-hours \n-days \n-month \n-year\nok a week is just 7 days so it's not a big issue, but why not add week for added convenience ?\nand week would be greatly useful in isSameDate (which would essentially mean \"happens on the same week\", pretty useful), and also as a unit in \ngetDateDiff\nstartOfDate\nendOfDate\nAnd for the last two, knowing which day is the first day of the week is indeed important.\ncf #759. Once we have all that, we are well armed to think, code and manipulate dates in terms of weeks.\nIt also makes a lot of sense to extend the Datetime Range component UI to accept a fixed-range prop, that automatically sets to = from + fixedRange as soon as the start date is picked. \nObviously we'd like range-size to take any arbitrary or even dynamic value.\nThe op's request of having \n\na possibility to select a whole week\n\nwould now be trivial to implement, along with thousands of other use cases.\nrequest moved to #760 . Confirmed bug on :\nMacOS 10.12.5\nFirefox 53.0.3 (64-bit) and 55.0b3 (64-bit). @pjar please share your implementation, that may help @rstoenescu include it quasar earlier.. I absolutely agree this demo preview next to the docs is immensely useful and a HUGE, easily spotted and all too rare selling point for the framework. It should be more apparent at first glance whatever the window size. The how doesn't matter much, it should just be somehow more visible (or hinted at) at all window desktop widths.. I love how quasar bugs get fixed at lightning speed and pushed to edge immediately. We'll have to learn to be more patient in the coming days... Razvan is finally taking a well deserved holiday.\n@rstoenescu I think I'll start calling you The Flash.. anyone else needs to disable ripple globally or on a single component, for any reason ? . From http://beta.quasar-framework.org/components/layout.html#Vue-Properties\nVue Property    Type    Description\nheader-style    Object  Style applied to header.\nheader-class    Object  CSS classes applied to header.\n<q-layout :header-class=\"{'no-shadow': true}\" ...\n.. might bring you joy, and if not, you have header-style to try out other things.. Thanks, code updated, to avoid anyone making the same mistake if they don't read it all.. I can see cases where top and bottom would be useful as they are now.\nMaybe we just need 2 more positions, bottom-center and top-center, that would be sized in the same way as the other 6 and horizontally centered just like top and bottom.. Having an easy way to get a (read-only) \"styles\" ES6 object from quasar, with colors and other stylus variables as properties, could also be a valid solution imho, and has the added advantage that we can keep manipulating our theme variables with the power of stylus (e.g. my tertiary color is a function of my secondary color).. @rstoenescu could we add some comments to the custom stylus variables file to help people enable this?\nor even better, automatically export all default and custom variables by default ?\nThis would fix many other issues, not only for color, eg. @BenoitRanque needs accessing breakpoint values for the QImg PR.. I thought this was interesting : https://github.com/stylus/stylus/issues/297#issuecomment-7708499 -> https://github.com/stylus/stylus/pull/784\n. At a first glance, it seems like an appropriate and easy to use stop-gap solution until we get rid of most of these v-html for safer alternatives or enforce safe encoding in the right places. Thx @pdanpdan . I thought about this one some more, and it feels pretty safe and simple to use. But I also feel it is too tempting for the dev to just \"say it's safe\" even though it isn't, just to get it working. In order to encourage safe use, maybe quasar could provide a helper function to correctly sanitize Html output, and apply it by default to content that is declared as safe? . I agree that it would be great to have an option to bypass the seemingly useless \"OK\" button...\nBut..\nOn mobile it is often quite hard to pick the correct date on the first try in a small grid (or with fat fingers hehe), and it's good to be able to correct a mistake before committing. Plus it seems like a universal convention, and we're trying to follow convention by default as much as possible.\nSo I would say, yes we need that option for some cases, and we would also probably need to be able to set differently for touch platforms vs. mouse platforms. But the default behaviour must stay, and the option should be wielded wisely.. Your FAB seems ok to me. It is in the bottom right corner in both cases, and distance from both borders seems consistent (as far as I can tell from your screenshot, since both window sizes differ a little).\nIf you did not intend for it to have a fixed position, but move with the card instead, your alignment problem may have its source in your usage of the q-card component and affiliates, and we can't help without seeing some of the underlying code. Feel free to join us on the forum or gitter for help.\n. I\u2019ve seen that issue before on gitter. Tiago had the same problem with a FAB icon misbehaving. Have you defined your q-fab at the root of your page? I\u2019m guessing q-layout or some other wrapping tag might affect its text-alignment, and since it\u2019s absolutely positioned it should be fine living at/near the page\u2019s root.. @rstoenescu nevertheless, this points to the FAB component missing an explicit css rule for text-alignment, with unexpected consequences. My suggestion may be a temporary fix, but FAB needs some love.. It just occurred to me that it may be a padding issue instead of text-alignment, but that changes little to what\u2019s been said above.. I guess if you take it out of q-layout\u2019s wrapping it will behave correctly. But I understand that may not be trivial. . I guess if you take it out of q-layout\u2019s wrapping it will behave correctly. But I understand that may not be trivial. . Actually, I just had a quick search through the source, and it seems vertical-alignment is explicitly set to middle in the FAB component, and the only component with vertical-alignment: top is q-card. There may be some unwanted interaction hidden in your code.\nSince the vertical-middle helper includes !important, you should be able to apply that class to your fab and fix your problem in the meantime.\nIf this still does not fix it, please inspect your FAB in the browser and report on its text alignment and internal padding css values (and their origin).\n@rstoenescu please take a look at this and fix it or show us what we\u2019re doing wrong.. What about a \"reveal-header\" (alternate to reveal) that would leave the navigation slot excluded from the reveal functionality?\nThis would have no effect (other than reveal) on iOS theme, but would allow more flexibility for mat theme.\nOr maybe a new \"fixed-nav\" slot, that acts as the navigation slot, except it's excluded from the reveal directive. Or even \"fixed-nav-top\" and \"fixed-nav-bottom\", to accomodate special cases where the default mat/ios positioning of navigation does not fit the intended use ?\nJust my 2cents.. https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons.html#buttons-dropdown-buttons\nExcept for dropdown, all buttons have their text centered as per material guidelines.\nBut If you really want to left-align your button text, here\u2019s how to do it:\n<q-btn flat style=\"width: 400px\">\n        <span class=\"full-width\" style=\"text-align: start\u201d>testing LTR left</span>\n </q-btn>\nYou\u2019ll probably want to move that css to the style tag either as a new class, or with an appropriate selector.. https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons.html#buttons-dropdown-buttons\nExcept for dropdown, all buttons have their text centered as per material guidelines.\nBut If you really want to left-align your button text, here\u2019s how to do it:\n<q-btn flat style=\"width: 400px\">\n        <span class=\"full-width\" style=\"text-align: start\u201d>testing LTR left</span>\n </q-btn>\nYou\u2019ll probably want to move that css to the style tag either as a new class, or with an appropriate selector.. <q-btn flat style=\"width: 400px\">\n        <span class=\"full-width text-left\" >testing text left</span>\n </q-btn>\nthis should work too and is more immediately elegant, thanks @rstoenescu for all those helpers.\nBut it is less versatile in case u later need to add RTL support. @snowyu if you want to customise the theme, as @smolinari said, at your won risk, I\u2019d suggest making your own btn component (which includes those 2 classes to get to your desired result).\nAs for the \u201ccustom themable\u201d topic, I have to agree with Scott. Quasar was created with other intentions: empower you to create user experiences that are coherent with todays users\u2019 expectations, with a minimum of fuss and time wasted around theming and native guidelines issues, so you can focus most of your time on good UX and solid functionality (while having a great time writing sustainable, readable code).. https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues/41. If it\u2019s not only quicker to code but also results in cleaner code that is easier to understand (when you read it x months later), then count me as +1 too.. Further investigation suggests that the close behaviour is triggered by \"mouseDown outside of modal\" OR \"mouseUp outside of modal\", but it takes effect (i.e. actually closes the Modal) only AFTER mouseUp (and this last part makes total sense in terms of UX).\nIn practical terms:\n+ mouseDown anywhere non-clickable in the viewport , mouseUP outside the modal  => close\n+ mouseDown outside the modal, mouseUp anywhere non-clickable in the viewport => close\n'*' like in the modal... or not, but not outside the browser window, and not on a btn or any element that captures clicks.\nthe above is the manifestation of this logic:\nIF mouseDown is not in modal boundaries OR mouseUp is not in modal boundaries\nTHEN close after mouseUp\nimho the correct behavior would be:\n+ mouseDown outside the modal, mouseUp outside the modal => close\nOr in logic terms: \nIF mouseDown is not in modal boundaries AND mouseUp is not in modal boundaries\nTHEN close after mouseUp. I haven't tested extensively on touch devices but I can't imagine why this fix would not affect all platforms equally.\nI was about to say that it's less of an issue with touch devices, since most modals tend to be fullscreen there... but that's forgetting about large tablets and the increasingly less rare touch enabled desktops/laptops, as well as public access devices, which often have large touch screens.. It also happens to the slider button, and basically any button that is not followed by a change in focus.. I don\u2019t know if this is in the realm possible or of science-fiction, or even if it\u2019s really a good idea, but having the pad-* classes apply a padding that was proportional to parent\u2019s size (a bit like q-layout does), would really be useful. What I mean by that, is for example when you use it inside of a button that is either small or big or normal, you get different padding. And if you use it in a container div, it scales with each media breakpoint.\nWhile I stand by my original point about the usefulness of a pad-* quatuor, I\u2019m really not so sure about having a variable width. Please speak your mind.\nAnother thought I had about those classes is that maybe it would be useful to have say 3 steps (like S/M/L) or maybe 5 (xs/sm/md/lg/xl but that may be confusing) or just 4, on an exponential scale:\ne.g.\nIf base (eg. pad-top) is 8px\n+ pad-top-nano = 4px\n+ pad-top-0 = 4 px\n+ pad-top-1 = 8px\n+ pad-top-2 = 16px\n+ pad-top-3 = 32px\n+ pad-top-4 = 64px\nThe scale could also be made to match quasar\u2019s typographic scale (h5->h1). Maybe that would be even more useful and visually harmonious by default.\nFinally, a nice way to round up this family would be to add\n+ pad-v pads vertically, ie. top + bottom\n+ pad-h pads horizontally, ie. left + right\n+ pad-all . I would try copying the original component\u2019s folder into my own src and modify that\nYou then import Datetime from your own /src/Datetime.\nNo guarantees, but that would be my first approach.\nI\u2019m sure when @rstoenescu comes back, he\u2019ll show you how to do a proper setup and PR and all. Or maybe @smolinari or @pdanpdan would know how to guide you.. this gitter excerpt might be useful in better understanding the issue and its pitfalls for users/developers.\nLaurent @spectrolite 16:30\nthere\u2019s 2 things here at play\n1 - week as a unit of time (=7days)\n2 - week of the year as calendar anchors (like months)   [aka. week of year or calendar year]\nJohn @JCharante 16:32\nand you need a third, starting day because the world is divided on starting on saturday/sunday/monday\nLaurent @spectrolite 16:34\nno need for a third, it\u2019s just a variant on 2.\n1 and 2 are two ways to look at the word week\nwe need the code to support both\natm it supports 1 through the use of 7days, and 2 as an analysis tool (getWeekOfYear), but not to create or manipulate (add, compare etc) date objects.\nI say we need more explicit support for week, both as a unit (instead of 7days, to help write clean code) and as calendar weeks (Week of Year), eg. allow to create a date from year + weekofyear.\n. this gitter excerpt contains some useful info on this and the related #759 \n...\nLaurent @spectrolite 16:22\n@JCharante fortnight :fixed-range=14\natm i assume fixed-range would take its value in days\nbut really it should be able to take hours or minutes or weeks as well\nJohn @JCharante 16:24\n@spectrolite so :fixed-range=\u201c14d\"\nLaurent @spectrolite 16:24\ni actually don\u2019t see any unit i would not include, from minutes to years.\nJohn @JCharante 16:24\nbut for fortnight support, you have to specify the starting day of week\nbut how do you know if the fortnight started on the recent fooday, or the past fooday?\nLaurent @spectrolite 16:25\nu make a good point, short codes would be useful too\nJohn @JCharante 16:28\nweeks are special in the sense that it has a day of the week to start on, but for any other unit of time you can't specify a day of the week to start on, so you would have to do specify an origin point, and then the datetime picker would have to calculate the ranges based off of the origin point\nLaurent @spectrolite 16:28\nms s m h d w y (1. month clashes with min, and 2. a month does not really define a precise time)\n.... I doubt that\u2019s the problem, it does not flicker in other browsers, and the modal itself does not seem affected (it\u2019s mostly white, so that may be my eyes tricking me), imho it\u2019s most probably not display-wide.\nThere\u2019s definitely something wrong with QBtn + QModal, I also have an issue with button click affecting Modal content with a glitch.. I tried on Sierra + Chrome Version 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit) and I can see a faint flicker of the shadow around the modal. \nOn Chrome Version 62.0.3175.0 (Official Build) canary (64-bit) I cannot see the flicker.\nOn Chromium Version 59.0.3071.115 (Developer Build) (64-bit) same shadow flicker as in Chrome.. Chrome Version 60.0.3112.90 (Official Build) (64-bit) on MacOS Sierra \n(chrome DEV channel)\nshadow flickers on button hover \n(but I could never get the same window-wide flicker as the OP, only the modal\u2019s shadow flickers). You\u2019ll probably be interested in this in the meantime:\nhttp://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/364/change-tab-on-swipe\nand\n\nWith this, I can move between the pages in the app by swiping to the side\n\nhttp://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/150/v-touch-swipe-issue [fixed]. I know RTL support is in the pipeline for quasar, but I\u2019m curious, how are you faring without it? did you have to tweak a lot of things?\nConcerning your issue I\u2019m sure @rstoenescu will investigate thoroughly if you provide some code or a repo to reproduce.. Ha, I\u2019ve missed that. Glad to see it\u2019s working well already. There\u2019s so much evolution so quickly in Quasar!. still, without any code or reproduction instructions, it\u2019s hard to inspect this issue.. The ability to exclude (grayed-out) specific dates (or weekdays btw), as well as including/excluding multiple ranges would indeed be very useful to the less trivial use cases (think e.g. event/flight/hotel booking apps).\n. @smolinari IMHO it feels a bit clunky compared to the rest of quasar, and makes the code quite hard to mentally visualize.\nI mean that by reading the code you will have a hard time figuring out what it's going to look like, and the intention is lost: \"put the button on the right side of the screen, but in the middle\" becomes corner=\"top-right\" :offset=\"[50, 0, '%']\"... to me it feels weird already, and that's forgetting how much this can be abused (you started from top and used a sensible (50, 0) but using (80, 50) or (25-75) or worse could make it a nightmare.. and switching the corner would wreak havoc unless you change also the offset... and someone could write some seriously horrific stuff like corner=\"bottom-right\" :offset=\"[90, 90, '%']\" to get near the top left corner...) Feels like a pandora's vase opening imo.\nI hope Razvan can find some solution with a cleaner usage syntax.\nUsing side=\"top|bottom|left|right\" (as @dsl101 suggested)  as an alternate to corner would be clean and should not break the code of people using corner where needed. But I may be missing something.\nSurely a unique position prop would be best, but I respect the reluctance to introduce breaking changes.. @rstoenescu I think I understand your point of view, and to answer @dsl101 I\u2019d say just one word : bloat. And then I\u2019ll bloat my paragraph by adding: it could result in some very confusing code/results if used wrong (e.g. position+corner together).\nBut proper documentation can mitigate this, and the convenience would really outweigh the \u201crisks\u201d.\nSo please Razvan, can we have some interpretation of this feature in v0.15 ?\n. @dsl101 What I mean by \u201cbloat\u201d is that as both codebase and quasar get bloated by potentially contradicting properties, elegance and predictability both go out the window. So you\u2019re technically right in that it can be implemented so that nothing will actually break, but you introduce a pinch of entropy in the core, that Razvan has so skilfully kept simple and free of unnecessary chaos with great care and effort. Feels like a shame, hence his reluctance.\nBut I\u2019m sure an elegant solution can be found..\n. In french you would only need a suffix for the 1st day of the month (1er -for premier), all other days are without suffix.\nThe same rule is true in italian, and the suffix is the degree symbol as in : 1\u00b0 maggio.\nPlease also note that months are never capitalised in dates (neither in fr nor in it), although they usually get Capitalized e.g. if they\u2019re on their own on top of a calendar\u2019s month view, but that\u2019s more of an i18n issue.. http://quasar-framework.org/components/field.html allows you to set a custom error message for each component that you wrap with a field tag. You should be able to get the desired behaviour from it.. I think that a simple warning in the Dialog docs would avoid many of these issues. Many newcomers don't realize that Dialog is a \"specialized\" Modal, so it's not (yet) an \"automatic reflex\" to go and use Modal instead.. > Dialog should be a very lightweight component. If you need a specific behaviour, you can design your own Modal for it.\nsimply this should do the trick imho. Great job there.\nBut it\u2019s really too bad you dropped HSL, which is probably the most intuitive colourspace for endusers.\nIf you need help with the math to put it back in, feel free to pm me on the forum.. top bar has the same issue and would need a similar solution (toggle or choose other transition), it really looks weird being pushed right by the sidemenu and animating over it.... Thanks for clarifying the animation vs transition mistake.\nLooking forward to v0.15 with a solution to this.. MacOS 10.13.1\nSafari Version 11.0.1 (13604.3.5)\nHovering the button breaks it as seen in the above pic, and it stays broken after mouse exits area.\nIf I click it, it changes to a circle again, and is fine until I exit the area, then it breaks again.\nI also noticed that if I exit the area before the ripple effect finishes, it fixes itself when the ripple ends.\nFinally, it fixes itself when the last alert on bottom clears out..

Matter of time and also ideas. \n\nSo far it is handling single/multiple uploads based on promises (credits to @james2doyle. The way how he handles it is so clever. I made some tweaks like writing it in ES6 which making things easier to understand, avoiding magic of bind(this) etc, but it is still his solution based on promises (to be honest it is hard to come with something totally different as it is good approach so there is no point to invent the wheel again.\nIt will come with:\n    - Single/multiple upload\n    - Choose files button (taking class and icon from props)\n    - Upload button (taking class and icon from props),\n    - Loading status (loading or not; do not confuse it with progress status)\n    - Emitting events @filesSelected, @uploadStart, @uploadCompleted, @uploadError\n    - Image upload - if upload type set to image, it will show thumbnails and let user to delete picture which he does not want to upload\nI can't figure out GOOD idea how to show the progress of upload so far.

I'm not sure if a new issue should be opened but I still think page transitions are an important part of any app which is trying to replicate a native feel, especially so for IOS users.

    "glittle": "Service workers can do a few things including:\n- control/cache network traffic\n- show native notifications\nThese are not dependent on each other. For example, in one app I want notifications but do NOT want caching. Whatever solution is developed needs to make each feature optional!. For me, there are two key elements. \nOne is to reduce the file sizes. Currently, when I make a small change in my code, the resulting change is a massive JS file.  I'd much rather have the client download 20 small JS files, one of which will change over time as I update my code rather than 1 large JS file that changes every time the code updates. Bundling my code with the framework's code is a bad practice!\nThe second is to improve startup time. I've got a PWA done with the Quasar Framework. My Lighthouse score is good except for Performance, and that is all to do with the startup time and \"first meaningful paint\". I feel that I have very little control over that because the framework is doing it all.\n\nThe \"Best Practices\" problem also needs to be fixed in the framework:\n\n.

Dear @Frondor \nI cannot reproduce it inside a pen, but as you can clearly see, the input gets cut off.\nOne of the reasons is: I need to put input font-size to 16px on mobile devices, because otherwise apple has an automatic zoom when focusing an input field. Putting the size at 16px prevents this.\nHowever, I checked the source again and I'm really confused why quasar needs to set q-input-target to height: 19px. Why not just height: inherit and no one will have any trouble with the input fields, even when changing fonts. The q-input-target already has min-height: 18px so why set it at a default of 19px right after?\n\nI can remove this PR as it has conflicts now anyway, but I'd love for the height to be set to inherit by default..

Are the docs not updated yet?\nq-[p|m][t|r|b|l|a|x|y]-[none|xs|sm|md|lg|xl]\nI meant to add auto or a for auto in the most right part.\nSo we can do something like q-mx-auto for auto margins on the x axis. @olegvakulenko I understand Quasar doesn't want to bloat the app, but there at least has to be a method to disable the default functionality that closes the FAB:\n\nNote\nClicking on a QFabAction will automatically close the list of sub-actions and return the FAB to its original state.\n\nI can't figure out how to change this without messing with the Quasar source code.... @pdanpdan \nWhat does this sentence mean?\n\n@change for lazy update. Vue v-model.lazy support is a pending change, so until then you can use the equivalent form (details below).. will the lazy modifier have a different effect than @input has?\nIs lazy e.g. run at a different timing when the v-model changes?\n\nI know that lazy loading is to \"defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed\" but I can't find any documentation anywhere on what lazy update means.... Dear Community\nAnyone who had this problem.\nThis is because the firebase.json file needs to be configured differently after Quasar 0.15.\nThe best way is to delete firebase.json and do firebase init in your directory again.\nThen setup as a SPA.\nYour firebase.json requires these lines:\n\"rewrites\": [ {\n  \"source\": \"**\",\n  \"destination\": \"/index.html\"\n}\nThe answer was found here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/37667626/firebase-cli-configure-as-a-single-page-app-rewrite-all-urls-to-index-html\nThanks to @BenoitRanque and @pdanpdan for helping me find this solution!. Dear Razvan, I studied the TouchPan directive. It seems very good! \nI wanted to ask : Do you have any hints for me as to how to move or resize the actual div with the touchPan directive?\n this seems tricky! :D. \nJust to let the world know:\nI was able to create it with summing the delta value of the scroll feedback, and every time I want to show the drag animation I would reset the total delta value and reflect the changes to the element's css.\nYou can also do something similar where you use css translate to do + or - pixels in a direction.\n(all this using 0 frameworks thanks to Quasar's awesomeness). You could use firebase and firebase-ui. : )\nGithub: https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web\nDemo: https://fir-ui-demo-84a6c.firebaseapp.com. I think so too... 600 ms is much better IMO.. Hey Razvan. \nI think often people are looking at Quasar just for the great components on their site. Not necessarily a mobile app. \nIn that case when their whole website is based on the iOS theme but they are looking for  something like flatpickr, the android picker is the perfect fit! \nThat's why i'm thinking of making the android picker available as a Quasar plugin even though a user uses iOS theme. If you agree I will make a  PR for you. \n( I personally was using flatpickr but would like to change it to the android picker. Flatpickr is a too big dependency.) . I'm currently using the following workaround for eg. a variable that needs changes the css height to be changed dynamically:\njs\ncolors.setBrand('drag-item-height', `${height}px`)\nthen in a styl file I would declare it like so:\ncss\n:root {\n  --q-color-drag-item-height: 50px\n}\ndiv.dyn-h {\n  height: var(--q-color-drag-item-height);\n}\nNot a beautiful solution but it works!\nBTW browser css variables support is great!. I require to edit the text color of a q-input. Is it possible to add \"text-color\" as a new prop?\nOr I could make a PR if you want?. @gecko-8 I have exactly the same issue.\nI need an option to be able to have the height set instead of the min-height.\nLook at my problem:\n\nHere is the pen:\nhttps://codepen.io/mesqueeb/pen/aGeKjm. @rstoenescu Sorry I didn't know this was a duplicate.\n2 small comments:\n\nit's also on mobile Safari. (in fact it's worse on mobile Safari than mobile Chrome iOS)\nit's easily fixed by swapping out any location where it uses 100vh by window.innerHeight after all Vue components are rendered.\n\nI want to suggest a small polyfill that can be turned on optionally in quasar.conf that swaps out the 100vh css for window.innerHeight.\nIf you want I can help with this, do a PR.. You can manually swap any 100vh with window.innerHeight on mounted(). . @rstoenescu yes exactly. But even with a tweak this would still use 100vh. (I mean on the body & #q-app) And it\u2019s only recently I found out that 100vh on mobile Safari is really bad (hides a big chunk underneath the tool bar). You can open any Quasar app that has content stretched until the bottom (like a keypad) on mobile safari and you'll see it looks really bad. \nSo it\u2019s unfortunately not curable through that style fn function, but instead all 100vh\u2019s in the quasar framework would need to be changed with something else. \nI believe that for this reason (even though it\u2019s just a mobile Safari problem) quasar should consider to not use 100vh at all. This would be most beneficial for most users. . @erkinsergey \nDo you not use any header or footer?\n I believe when you return { minHeight: '100vh' } you'll have a too high page because the height of the header and footer will be added extra.\nWhat I am doing is return { minHeight: '${window.innerHeight - offset}px' } and this solves all problems in all mobile browsers as far as my tests go.\nDoes this work for you?\nPS: when writing code blocks on Github issues it's better to write three back dashes on top and below the code \u2192 ```. Yes exactly I need that too. For now my work around is the complete guide I wrote two posts below. \u2193. ## Guide to app window height on mobile browsers\nMy guide to successfully integrate the correct window height (at all times in any browser and on mobile)\nThe culprit\nCSS property vh is the culprit, as on mobile browsers this gives unexpected results.\nThe saviour\nWe will need to use JavaScript's window.innerHeight or window.outerHeight which is much more reliable, as it does not count in any status bars / toolbars.\nLuckily we have Quasar framework and we do not need to research what is the best way to calculate the window height, we can just use the built in Window Resize Observable to get the window height.\nAlso an added bonus is that Window Resize Observable is reactive, which is very important to make sure users can still resize the browser window.\nSave correct sizes\nWe can use Quasar's Window Resize Observable to make sure we always have the correct window sizes. Add it to your App.vue file like so:\nhtml\n<template>\n  <div id=\"q-app\">\n    <q-window-resize-observable @resize=\"onResize\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'App',\n  methods:\n  {\n    onResize (size) {\n      $store.state.windowSize = size\n    },\n  }\n}\n</script>\nIdentify all occurrences of 100vh\nIf we search the Quasar repo for \"100vh\" we have about 9 occurrences of 100vh we'll need to deal with.\nReplace occurrences of 100vh\nThe most important ones are:\nstylus\nbody\n  min-height 100vh\n// and\n.q-layout\n  min-height 100vh\nFirst reset them by adding global css rules:\nstylus\nbody, .q-layout\n  min-height initial\nNow we can modify these to use our own calculated min-height.\nAny time you use <q-layout> just add:\n```html\n<q-layout\n  :style=\"{min-height: $store.state.windowSize.height + 'px'}\"\n\n```\nThis way it will be the correct height.\n\nThen our final step is to change the behaviour of Q-Page as this also sets min-height but can be changed via a function called \"style-fn\" (which I had added).\nAny time you use <q-page> just add:\nhtml\n<q-page style-fn=\"myTweak\">\n// and in script\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    myTweak (offset) {\n      if (!offset) offset = 0\n      return {\n        minHeight: this.$store.state.windowSize.height - offset + 'px'\n      }\n    },\n  }\n}\n</script>\nPlease do not forget to review all other occurrences of 100vh in the Quasar framework, and check if your app works OK on mobile Safari / mobile Chrome etc.\nImportant for Cordova iOS\nIf you use the WKWebView plugin for iOS cordova then the calculation of the window height as retrieved by Quasar's Window Resize Observable will not be correct. However only in this case, 100vh is parsed correctly again.\nYou can adapt the above solution to work even with iOS cordova by changing myTweak to:\njs\n    myTweak (offset) {\n      if (!offset) offset = 0\n      const minHeight = ($q.platform.is.cordova)\n        ? `calc(100vh - ${offset}px)`\n        : this.$store.state.windowSize.height - offset + 'px'\n      return { minHeight }\n    },\nBonus:\nIn cases you want a page to be full height by default, instead of \"min-height\" just add the same logic to the \"height\" property in the same places!. We will need to revisit this issue after Quasar version 1 has come out. I will need to either propose an official solution or make a PR with this guide in the docs.\nFor now I'll wait for Quasar v1 later this or next month.\n@erkinsergey it works for me directly editing the state. without a mutation. Reason being, I don't want my mutation history to be cluttered with the same mutation a million times. : D\nAlso, maybe it's better to add a debounce to the onResize, but I'm not sure.\nSyntax you can highlight by writing js or html behind the three ```\nlike this: ```js\nclose with: ``. Maybe because you had no initial value set forstore.state.windowSize`\nTry adding that prop to your initial state. That should make it reactive. . Updated the guide above for Cordova iOS when the plugin WKWebView is used!\nAdded the new chapter called \"Important for Cordova iOS\". This is high on my priority list! \u2661. @rstoenescu\nThis is what I meant:\n\nThe ability to set a min-width and make the input auto grow based on the content.\nI use it all the time in a lot of places throughout my apps and websites.\nI usually use this small package:\nhttps://github.com/yuanqing/autosize-input\nThen I wrapped that in a directive:\n```js\n  import autosizeInput from 'autosize-input'\nVue.directive('autowidth', {\n    inserted(el, binding) {\n      Vue.nextTick(function () {\n        autosizeInput(el)\n      })\n    }\n  })\n// and use it like v-autowidth on an \n```\nHowever, it doesn't work with inputs wrapped in  because the directive is not applied on the correct element.\nCould I implement this functionality and make a PR for you? I would use that package as dependency, unless you want me to build it from scratch, I can give it a shot, make a PR.\nWhat do you think?. @rstoenescu Can you re-open this issue?\nThis feature request of mine still stands, as it's very important for my app! : D. I still require the autogrow feature for text input fields with the ability to grow horizontal.\nThe current \"autogrow\" in V1 gives me new lines.\nI require the actual input to grow horizonally:\n. @rstoenescu \nYes, sorry, here is the codePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/mesqueeb/pen/ergGVe. Just had a report from a user:\nthe bug is also present with pop-overs, not just modals! Should I update the codepen to add a pop-over?. isn't it something to attach on the close button?. Ok! If I ever get around to creating a sharable one I'll present the code as a suggestion to add!. @rstoenescu \nThank you for your elaboration.\nIn my opinion I'd be very grateful if Quasar Framework would offer the ability to choose iOS/Material theme on a component base.\n\nFor one app our team needs to have the QTabs of Material but iOS based design for all other components.\nFor another app I personally need the time picker of Material but iOS based design for all other components.\n\nIs there any way I could manually do this?. @venkyvb \nThank you very much!. On the iPhone all problems can be fixed by not setting the line-height but the input height by:\ncss\n.q-input-target {\n  height: inherit !important;\n}\nPRE FIX\n\nAFTER FIX\n\n. That's the :min and :max right?\nhtml\n  <q-range\n    v-model=\"rangeValues\"\n    :min=\"5\"\n    :max=\"20\"\n    :step=\"1\"\n  />\nhttps://quasar-framework.org/components/range.html. What's your use case?. thanks, I made a simple custom integration which I shared in #180 .. PS I will update docs as well if this would be accepted. \u2661. Update QPage.js\n@rstoenescu \nI want to shortly discuss this component.\nToday I had to make my app layout float in the middle of the screen when the window is high and wide.\n(see screenshot below)\nThis made me having to override the min-height that's encoded on the q-page render. I had some trouble doing this! Trying to set min-height through style on the element got overridden sometimes by the quasar's style which is here.\nThis made me think the best way to tackle situations where the dev needs to custom manage height, min-height and max-height.\nInstead of adding the possibility for the dev to also set the height through a boolean prop, I think it's better to make the developer set those things himself outside of this native component, but then give the option to disable the min-height being set by quasar.\nI think this will give much more freedom.\nHowever, the only problem in that case is that the developer would probably want to have access to the offset:\njs\nconst offset =\n        (this.layout.header.space ? this.layout.header.size : 0) +\n        (this.layout.footer.space ? this.layout.footer.size : 0)\nto be able to keep this in mind when adding custom (min/max)height to the q-page.\nSo to summarize:\nmy suggestion:\n\"I removed the height prop again, set a minHeight prop which the dev can set to false if he wants to prevent q-page from setting the minHeight. If it's true or undefined it will just set the minHeight like always.\nMy Question:\nIs it possible to access this offset somehow in vue components? If we can give the dev access to the offset in a component it's better to write in the docs on how to do that and further not set the props on this component.\nPS: Good job on the Vue event today!!\n. @rstoenescu\nCurrently the the custom styleFn prop is available on QPage only.\nAny chance we can extend this to the QLayout, #q-app and body as well?\nSince all these also use vh which I must replace because of Mobile Safari's improper handling of vh.. The fix is to wrap the name update inside a setTimeout of 1ms. @rstoenescu \nI basically had created a lot of custom CSS for one of my apps to achieve the container effect (see GIF below). Is this what \"Containerized QLayout\" does?\nGIF:\n\n. I also require custom svg in many cases Quasar offers the icon slot.\nEg. QDropdownBtn has an \"icon\" slot, but I need to use a custom svg in that slot.. Henrique if this is true i\u2019d love to try it out and write some guide on this for the quasar docs. \nFor the time being can you point me in the direction to start doing this? Any blog post or guide you can recommend?. I beautiful solution would be to allow to pass a path to the svg icon in the assets folder.\nSomething like:\nhtml\n<q-btn icon=\"~/svg/myCustomIcon.svg\" />\nWhat do you think?. yeah I think so!\nI don't personally need it, but I imagine a lot of people wanting something similar to Bootstrap's \"fluid\" jumbotron.\nI'm sure it can easily be done with CSS, but there's the small curved borders as well and most people would appreciate it as a boolean prop I reckoned.\nThat's why I suggested it : ). Amazing!!! Thanks so much!! . @rstoenescu\nI'm curious what will happen to iOS/Material themes in v1.0. A while ago I think there was some discussion on wether or not iOS theme is used enough to keep? Will there be any changes to this or not?\nAlso will boot.js be depreciated before v1.0?. I'll close because it's ambiguous\n. Did you try <q-layout view=\"lHH lpr lFF\"> ??\njust make the H and F capital letters.\nPlease read the documentation on QLayout.. Just adding a screenshot to make it easier to know what I'm talking about.\n\n. @Hamdan85 Can you try again with v1?. @Hamdan85 It's on a stable API now. If it's production ready or not I'll leave up to you to decide. \ud83d\ude09\nThe upgrade guide was just released and you can read it here:\nhttps://v1.quasar-framework.org/start/upgrade-guide. @rstoenescu \nI tried adding these lines under the first rule push in Quasar:\njs\ncfg.module.rules.push({\n          test: /\\.vue$/,\n          use: [\n            {\n              loader: 'vue-loader',\n              options: { /* ... */ }\n            },\n            {\n              loader: 'vue-svg-inline-loader',\n              options: { /* ... */ }\n            }\n          ]\n        })\nbut it breaks the app. Says \"render function not defined\"\nAny advice much appreciated!. @rstoenescu \nIt works if I delete the vue-loader part and only leave the 'vue-svg-inline-loader' part!\nThe only problem that remains is, I cannot use ~assets/ anymore. I need to write out a hard-coded path depending on the vue file's location!\nIs there any workaround for this you can foresee?\nThanks so much!. Related Loading SVG from Alias Path not working. I was able to get it to work with this in my quasar.conf on quasar pre v1\njs\ncfg.module.rules.push({\n          test: /\\.vue$/,\n          use: [\n            {\n              loader: 'vue-svg-inline-loader',\n              options: {svgo: false}\n            }\n          ]\n        }). @zwmyxzs Are you talking about this?\nSee screenshot from my Cordova iOS app below:\n\nIf this is the case it's probably out of Quasar Framework's control, as it's the way UIWebKit works.\nI haven't tried with WKWebKit yet (there's a cordova plugin for that), but if I do I'll let you know how it goes.\nBut really, there's no fuss, as when you scroll up, it will be fixed. It only gets pulled down like that if you try to pull the screen down even though you're at the top. So there's no big deal.\nEdit:\nthis could also be related to the iOS rubber band effect which can be disabled. Same for search icon of ionicon in a tab bar in the bottom:\n\nNo idea how to reproduce this.... I will close this issue until I can find a way to make it reproducible. Probably will try this after Quasar v1.0. I did, this PR has 2 commits! : ). I'm not sure 7.6kb, 300 lines just for scroll lock on the backdrop modal seems a little overkill. We wanna keep Quasar as light as possible, and my two lines work on cordova and browsers as well so should be enough in my opinion.\nThanks for the advice though!. I am going to try and use the cordova plugin for WKWebView instead of the default old UIWebView that is being used by cordova.\nI will further update this thread if there is a difference and/or if I find a workaround.. The problem is solved by using WKWebView.. Have made sure I had the 4 lines above in the config.xml.\nAny old document reference at Cordova to window.open now points to the cordova-plugin-inappbrowser page. So I am going to try and install this one.\nOtherwise I found this plugin, but it's not an official one by apache: cordova-plugin-open-scheme-url. Thought I'd just post it here for now.\nRelated open bug at WkWebView plugin.. Apparently it's a known issue in the Apache Cordova issue tracker without a fix for now.\nUsing cordova-plugin-inappbrowser works alright!\n. +1. How about making the installation section collapsable, and remembering this setting in a cookie?\nSo that when a user collapses it, it will be collapsed for all pages.. @pdanpdan Thanks a lot!!!. Dear @purell Thanks for your post.\nI love these kind of discussions on state management. And I have so few friends to exchange opinions on Vuex usage with!\nI actually handle most of my modules as the local database with api connections for synchronising modifications.\nHowever, I have a \"selection\" module which so many different components depend on, so I made it as a vuex module. This selection module is responsible for keeping track of selected items and is the module that fires actions to the other DB-like modules.\nEg. I would dispatch('selection/delete') from a Vue component to delete the currently selected item and clear the selection.\nI would also dispatch this same action from eg. a hotkey with a keydown listener.\nIn my case it makes most sense to also notify the user of the item deletion (with the option to undo) right from that selection/delete action. Otherwise I'll have to add this notify() call in all places I call dispatch('selection/delete') from! \ud83e\uddfc\nI'd love to hear your opinion on my use case!!!. @mstaack Do you know what I would have to set to to in that function? I tried to understand the source code but couldn't.\nThe manual code I'm using is:\njs\nfunction scrollToElement (el, duration = 200) {\n  const target = getScrollTarget(el)\n  const offset = el.offsetTop\n  setScrollPosition(target, offset, duration)\n}\nBut I guess in the end this doesn't support ease-in-ease-out. Do you think it's really resource heavy to add ease-in-ease-out to a scrollTo function?. Sorry!\nmacOS latest version\nSafari latest version. @rstoenescu I just feel that this is something so common that most people would want/need that a built-in quasar solution might be a good idea!\nYour solution: this.$root.$emit('showDialog', 'hello-world') makes sense, but I believe it'd be awesome if this is built right into Quasar.\nIt would be just one extra wrap around the function like so:\njs\nexport default ({ Vue }) => {\n  function show (dialogName) {\n    Vue.$emit('showDialog', dialogName)\n  }\n  Vue.$dialog.show = show\n}\nSo a small price to pay for Quasar's file size, but a great benefit for developers!!. PS, if no special reason for 600ms, I would set the default to 300 (or 0), just to make the default feel more responsive.. @rstoenescu Do you have any idea why the Dialog feels like there's a short delay before it is shown?. @webnoob I think Razvan's latest commit might have something to do with this issue:\nfeat(quasar): Speed up transition times (300ms). Thanks a lot! I'll see how it feels in next beta!. @rstoenescu Sorry for being unclear.\nI meant not upgrade guide from 0.17 \u2192 beta\nI meant upgrade guide for V1 beta x \u2192 latest version\nOld docs say we should do npm i quasar-cli@latest:\n\nI think now it's just enough to do npm update?\nThat should be documented at the top of that upgrade guide with the difference between:\n- upgrade 0.x to v1\n- upgrade v1.x to latest. Maybe support outlined on q-btn as well and change documentation to that\nBut while continuing to support outline as well only under the hood. @pdanpdan \nSorry I don't see why I should do this. As I explained above:\n\nWhen I open the dialog from the docs in codepen it works just as expected on brave browser:\n- hit esc and the dialog closes\n\nI think Codepen uses other key recognition that allows it to work properly. \ud83d\ude05. This is the code I use in pages/Index.vue\n```vue\n\n\n\ntest modal\n\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'PageIndex',\n  data () { return { dialog: true } }\n}\n\n```\nJust add this on a fresh install of Quasar beta and try closing the dialog through ESC inside Brave Browser. It will not work... While it does work in Safari & Google Chrome.. @rstoenescu done, please check. ",

Thanks guys. importing the css into the component worked fine.\nI'm building a mobile app, so I'd like to stay away from CDN. \n\n. My honest opinion. I think the quasar/gear combo is too busy. Also stay away from jagged lines. I would go for a logo with 1 color that is as simple as possible but still captures the essence of a quasar. Like icons on airports/ traffic /public buildings. Simple logos are often the best communicators. 1 color also sticks out in promotional material. (Think of multiple sponsor logos on an event page, being a speaker somewhere etc.\nI like the directions Dheerajvs suggested. \nhttp://telin.ugent.be/~sdonn/template_images/quasar_icon.svg\nEsthetics are key here, since where talking about a beautiful GUI framework :-) My first associations are balance, clarity, clean, organized, not too bulky.\nI have always leaned toward minimalistic design, so I am very biased I guess.\nBtw: the quasar site is very pleasing to the eye. It's feels like a candy store going through the docs. The content itself is quality, but looks good and organized as well. @zuck  I see what you mean, but still, the picasa and chrome logo are easier on the eye, shapewise, compared to the quasar/gear combo.  (Ubuntu logo, I just don't like)\nAlso, I my first thought when seeing the gear shape is, metal, machines, industry.\nMaybe using a stick and a ring, experimenting with different dimensions, would be an idea for a simple abstract design.\nAnyway, I hope guys don't mind me being critical. (I am NOT a designer, but trying to stay constructive at all times). \nTaste is has always been an endless debate ;-) but I'm sure you'll end up with something good, just like Quasar framework is. \n\n.

I think another use case would where if I'm trying to pass css values to QModal with content-css (as in <q-modal minimized ref=\"modal\" :content-css=\"{border: 'solid', 'border-radius': '5px', 'border-color': '#26a69a'}\">) then there's no way to access $lime (so I have to find out it's hex value and hard code it), but if there were a styles object then that would definitely help..

Wrong repo, post this to https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli instead. Is there a reproduction repo so someone else can confirm the bug?\nAnd why npm build? Did you mean quasar build? npm build doesn't seem to do anything for me.. The github issues section is intended for bug reports and feature requests.  You'll probably get more support by asking on the Quasar Gitter or Quasar Forums.\n\nForum Thread\n\nIf you add a [Request] prefix & reword it then it would be a proper request, which is something that I'd support since I'd like for this to be implemented.. @pdanpdan Nothing other than it being quicker & clearer to set the desired behavior for the layout where you design the layout. I think you're being rhetorical to make me think that this can already be done, but I did mention that you can achieve the desired affect with the v-model prop in the original message.. While in general I'm all :+1:, I'd disagree with the statement that this is not a breaking change. If someone wanted to have the left/right sides co-exist with the content (instead of having the sides act as a Drawer) regardless of device width, then it's a real possibility that they would have set the breakpoints to zero. So to achieve the same behavior, they'd have to set the breakpoint to 1..

While factual, this is not an issue with the actual \"quasar\" framework. While https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org is generally for the docs, I'd suggest filing an issue there instead.. This would be great for my usecase, where I would first need to query my GraphQL api for each file in order to get a temporary PUT url to upload the file directly into my minio server.\nQUploader has a submit() method, so maybe it can emit an event when submit() is triggered, so we know to listen for it, and then do our own thing with it's array. The currently way QUploader is implemented feels like it's assuming about how the backend is setup, but I think with these changes it would be a lot more backend agnostic. . ",

(As I mentioned in Gitter...)\nOk, so regarding these out-of-the-box transitions... I have a little question that makes me think I\"m misunderstanding teh scope of what's being asked. As I understand it...\n- Vue & Vue-router already have a facility to provide CSS Transitions & Animations; you just need to provide the CSS classes for \"enter\", \"leave\" + their active states.\n- My research has turned up this library: https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ and I'm sure there are lots more like it.\nSo, I'm wondering how it could be made any simpler by adding anything to Quasar, other than re-naming the styles already available in transition libraries like the one above to the standard expected by Vue. Perhaps adding props to change the speed, or select different transitions for enter/leave, stuff like that. But really, that doesn't seem like much at all to me... Am I missing something obvious?

In my brief testing, Javascript errors could be prevented with these three modifications:\nElement.classList. Polyfilled with some general classList script. But note that vue.js doesn't need a polyfill, perhaps Quasar could follow similar route or document that a polyfill is needed: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/ae93d2b/src/platforms/web/runtime/class-util.js\nElement.dataset, which is IE11 only, but luckily quasar only reads from dataset so it could be somewhat polyfilled with some general dataset script utilizing getters. Maybe you could use data-* attributes directly or document that a polyfill is needed.

Fine\nEm 24 de fev de 2018 18:36, \"Razvan Stoenescu\" notifications@github.com\nescreveu:\n\nHi,\nThis is redundant since you can set the MDI icon set as default in your\napp through quasar.conf.js.\nAlso, loading a heavier icon set by default is not quite good, especially\nwhen you build a PWA... you'll notice a few points drop in Lighthouse just\nfor this.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/1637#issuecomment-368262184,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABD71b7MG-BMAsU7PcDoOOuGHK4ZEjSSks5tYIDxgaJpZM4SSBsp\n.\n. \n",
    "panstromek": "ide-helper can also generate Live Templates now \ud83d\ude09 They are not perfect, but it's a good start and I'm looking forward to make them better in the future.\n@insign Did you manage to get somewhere with your effort? We can develop on that if you want \ud83d\ude09 . What I mean is using virtual list in infinite scroll. I didn't realize that q-infinite-scroll is just a container in Quasar. Virtual list is already in todo list, so I think this will be possible in future... +1. Bump. I need to set exactly this on header, too.\nThx for temporary solution.. Does this add alphabetic selection to QSelect, like it works on native html select element? (like pressing 'K' on keyboard selects first option starting with 'K').\nLot of good stuff here anyway, thx ;). Satisfied by 85572ac , Thx ;). Just a consistency with offset-0 I guess.. I didn't really think about this TBH, I have no use in mind now. But you added it anyway, thanks ;). It's ok. I also thought 'cs' is the one. Both are used so I wasn't sure, but as I read now, 'cs' is correct one. Thanks . Ah, ok. Sorry, then. Thanks for the info.. Thx.. I know the struggle there... But it seems to be super weird. I tried to play around a bit with it and got to the point where PHPStorm could actually see the component, you could ctrl+click on it and it'd take you to correct definition, but it still couldn't autocomplete props.. \nNeedless to say that Vue integration in Idea is still pretty buggy and incomplete...\nWhat really messed it up was v0.15 with Quasar.conf and its global imports and CLI which leaved out dependencies from package.json, so IDEA just complains about missing them and doesn't provide full intellisense.\n. @jpgilchrist I like your approach, you basically did something similar to laravel-ide-helper, which just generates helper file for IDE to index. I think that might be way to go, but lacks some support like auto-generated impors....  or just write IDEA plugin, which I thought of doing but it seems like overkill.... there are open issues on IntelliJ YouTrack which relates to this. Maybe we get the full autocomplete some day from JetBrains itself..\nhttps://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-31682\nnote that there is 'asignee' and 'priority: major' ;)\n. This is (at least partly) solved by the ide-helper extension ;). I've seen this in previous beta, too but I thought it is related to something different, so sorry I didn't post it earlier. Here is a piece of code that crashes\n`\n```\n// Add router hook for handling asyncData.\n// Doing it after initial route is resolved so that we don't double-fetch\n// the data that we already have. Using router.beforeResolve() so that all\n// async components are resolved.\nrouter.beforeResolve((to, from, next) => {\n  const asyncDataHooks = router.getMatchedComponents(to)\n    .map(c => c.asyncData)  ///This is where it crashes\n    .filter( => )\nif (asyncDataHooks.length === 0) {\n    return next()\n  }\nPromise.all(\n    asyncDataHooks.map(hook => hook({\n      store,\n      route: to\n    }))\n  )\n  .then(next).catch(next)\n})\n``. Ok, I found out that another route crashes, too. Problem is that these routes doesn't have components attached to them.. these are the routes. If I go to child '', it crashes\n```\n{\n          path: 'tree',\n          component: () => import('pages/TreePage'),\n          beforeEnter: function (from, to, next) {\n            requireLogin(from, to, next)\n          },\n          children: [\n            {\n              path: '',\n              beforeEnter: function (from, to, next) {\n                if (store.state.treeState.categoryId) {\n                  next('/app/tree/' + store.state.treeState.categoryId)\n                }\n                else {next()}\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              path: ':id',\n              props: route => ({id: Math.round(Number(route.params.id))}),\n              component: () => import('components/tree/TreeView')\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n``. Ok, I'll try. . here is the reproduction link, try to go to /#/index/` route\nhttps://github.com/panstromek/quasar-bug-reproduction. @1083970440 Sorry, I don't understand what you mean... . fixed by 0.18 beta. @ExNG You are right, Vue renders page in browser - what static generators do is that they just run app, virtually visit selected routes and save rendered output. Then you can serve prerendered pages and let javascript take over that later when it loads.\nHexo can do that (used for Quasar docs), Vue-press, Vue-prerender plugin etc... @rstoenescu cool ;) It would definitely be nice - especially with latest shift to JAMstack and sites that are heavily prerendered. JAMstack philosophy is actually against SSR.\n. Now I am not sure if I am talking about same subject - is this considered the same as what prerender SPA plugin does? There used to be a page in docs for that and I guess it should still work.. I need to try.\nOr is this about generating static-only (no SPA) website like hexo does?\nAnother point is that Vue-press generate all routes but still runs as SPA then, so it is the first case.. @asarkar1990 I think this is done by that prerender-spa plugin, but I am not sure about its limitations, I haven't got a chance to try it, yet. \nVue-press also does it. They do it by leveraging SSR which I think is the way to go in Quasar case, too. They simply run SSR server, visit each route and save the output. In other words client can't recognize if the app uses SSR or is built statically.\nI think that with some custom code you could already do similar thing with Quasar right now.. +1. omg, I misspelled 'infinite'..  anyway, I tried to put it inside q-pull-to-refresh and it works in fiddle, so it is probably something on my end. Ok, I see, But it should be in the docs. I will PR that. Oh, I see what is the problem here, I should have catched that sooner on discord - you use delete operator, which Vue cannot detect, so it can't trigger its reactivity system. Use Vue.delete(arrayOrObject, IndexOrKey) method instead.\nLook here: https://jsfiddle.net/un2cqrsk/21/\n. Please close this issue. also read through the Vue caveats here: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats. Please include jsfiddle to demonstrate the issue. you can fork this https://jsfiddle.net/waugrryy. @genyded Sorry for the comment, I misunderstood. Used issue helper, let me know how you like the structure ;) \nIt's super minimal to include only important info and less noise ;). oops, I confused the names, I meant that it stays on default.. I don't understand this PR \ud83e\udd14 I tried all possible versions and they just work... Maybe it was already fixed?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/4k5rayhc/8/. I think I found it. Will PR soon.. The position is but I was talking about hardcoded '16' . Are you sure it is always 16? AFAIK 60fps is just recommended but it should match the framerate and 1000/60 is just rougly 16. It's more 17 actually :D. Anyway, callback argument is timestamp, so it is probably more accurate to calculate the position based on timestamp diff. I'd guess it should work better when browser lags... > So using a timestamp instead of relying on requestAnimationFrame() can possibly make the scroll not animated at all (sometimes jumping really long distances).\nThis is true - And I thought that's actually the expected behaviour. So the animation is more important than being \"in time\" on the desired position. Ok, that makes sense.\nBut what about that 16? Does the animation run twice as fast on 120fps monitor? And why it's not 17?. Can you create jsfiddle please? \ud83d\ude09  It's hard to reproduce when we don't know how exactly is the component used.... You can achieve this by using:\n<q-btn type=\"a\" href=\"/login\"  target=\"_blank\" label=\"to login\"/>\nThe problem is that Vue router just emulates navigation in current tab by \"masking\" default browser behavior. You try to handle broswer action with it. to=\"/login\" is command for Vue which only lives in current window/tab, while target=\"_blank\" is command for browser.\nIf you want to open new window/tab, there is no longer need to handle this by Vue router, everything starts from scratch in there.\nHope this helps ;). This is possible in v1.0 indirectly through factory functions, but maybe it would be worth adding specific event/callback for that..... --no-commit \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude04 . I see, ok.. Mention it in the docs then \ud83d\ude09 (I guess you are working on QSelect right now). 1. Really? This surprised me honestly.. but I can't find it :D. I found only dropdown menu in design and select-menu in the reference implementation and both of them expand besides...\n\ntrue\n. similar thing happens when clicking on disabled toggle\n\n\n. hmm... ok .. it's not colorless by default though - it is blue (primary I guess). TODO: custom label value - I forgot about that. and maybe lazy input?\n. I think I should probably change this to match the Range style, which is similar to old docs.... I have seen that page but I thought using :rules is just another option. From my understanding the code here is still usable in new Quasar.. do you imply that Vuelidate support has been dropped?. I see.. well. This will take me a bit more time then.. Copy-pasting dark table will paste it as white text.. Not sure if that is intended or no \ud83e\udd14 . It's just a feature I already needed before... ...this would probably be good candidate for an app-extension \ud83d\ude09 . Yes, there are already two @quasar/testing and quasar-ide-helper + one is in the making - with an article coming soon ;) It will land in the docs, too.. Just so you know that this is active - few people already requested something similar and we are trying to find the best way to integrate these defaults, together with the theming system ;)\nCurrenctly the focus on getting 1.0 stable out, so we will focus on this later ;). This is actually really great idea, I like it \ud83d\ude09 It allows better separation of component and dialog logic. \nI often find myself adding dialog tags with v-model=\"isShowing\" just because I need to show a little bit more stuff in it. But it spreads bunch of dialog logic into multiple places in the parent component which usually doesn't use the dialog all that much.\nI really like to use the $q.dialog injection because it keeps the dialog logic in one place and has more \"flowing\" syntax, which I think suits dialogs better than v-model approach.\nI don't know how much is this possible, but I would like it ;) Just my 2 cents.. Have you tried using expand-besides prop?\n[EDIT] nvm. Which components are affected by this?. There is an option expand-besides in 1.0 version, which does exactly that... @panstromek \ud83e\udd14 It is just a page load. Just open the docs and go to get started. And new Violation is thrown on almost everytime you to some other page..\n. Wait.. now I can't reproduce it either. It doesn't throw these anymore...\nnow it throws only\nUnchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.\nMaybe this is something fixed in last chrome. I updated it in the meantime.. I guess we can close this for now and reopen if it appears again. Usual workaround for .finally is to put .then(onFinally, onFinally) (from mdn)\nafter the last catch clause.\nI would suggest you to not bet on polyfills when the workaround is that simple. Polyfilling and transpilation is very complex. Adding such a simple thing is not really worth it considering the risk of possible breakage.\nAnother thing is that 0.15 is really old version and full focus is on 1.0 now. We can't spend time patching legacy version.. Can you please elaborate more on what was your issue we were discussing? Razvan doesn't know anything about what we were talking about thx ;). The way QDialog and other popovers work is not intuitive for newcomers, and combined with the fact that there is a bug in devtools makes it really confusing.\nI know that this is not really our problem but I asked @maarteNNNN to make a docs PR with some notice about it, so other developers don't get lost trying to figure it out. I thought it could be helpful for somebody ;). ",

    "arddor": "This change fixed it for bigger screen sizes (> 1280px), but on for example a tablet this issue still remains. However I would rather suggested removing the max-width on bigger screens. Is there a specific reason for the max-width?. @rstoenescu Yes I completely agree that it is a helper for most use cases. However what I would expect from the name \"layout-padding\" is that it actually does add some padding to both sides, which is a often seen pattern for page content. I think the way it is now is rather specific and not a general use case. If the default was that max-width would be removed from all sizes it would work as I expect it (padding on left and right side). Now you get different paddings because of max-width and it keeps to the left side.\nAs you said it is trivial to fix it or use my own css, however I felt that it is counter intuitiv and it could be discussed. If you want to keep the max-width I would suggest that you add margin: auto to all sizes so that it behaves the same for md bg and lg. However I don't see any reason for max-width at all.. ",

    "colinmollenhour": "IMO this is better to leave up to server-side, perhaps just adding a UI button to trigger the request.\nAlso note in my experience for one data table UI I often need to export multiple different grids. E.g. one might be parent rows only and another might be one-row-per-child with some parent columns duplicated, etc... I find that in many cases using column headers is too limiting and you want to filter by something that isn't visible. Also this ties the filtering to the presentation and you run into issues where the filter needs more width than the column and so you are wasting table width for wide filters. A huge improvement IMO is using chips and a list of filter options. An excellent example is seen on Intercom.com's user list:\n\nNote, a component implemented in this way would be useful for more than just tables, it could be used for filtering lists, points on a map, a grid full of tiles, etc. So I think not only is it more powerful and user-friendly, it is also more re-usable. . It seems like this is reinventing the wheel... There are great libraries that are well maintained such as moment.js.  If you implement i18n directly you will forever be bogged down with little issues for supporting  every language on earth. I'm not advocating making another library a dependency, but perhaps an official optional extension. . ",
    "purell": "@colinmollenhour I'm totally agree with you. \nIf we look at the Datatable.js, a lot of transfer time is consumed because of the csv, pdf, ... export plugins. So it's better to leave up the server do the conversion and call the route on a top-bar button of the QTable.. Most of existing plugin I tried like tableexport use the whole table to produce the xls(x) file. I tried them with the quasar QTable v0.15 but it does not work as expected. The QTable only draw the computedRows property that is holding the rows only for the current page instead of all rows.  Same problem as https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/1194\nLooking at the jquery.datatable, even if we are looking the page 1/50, the exported files contains the rows of all pages.\nI think we will have to create a quasar plugin from scratch without help of third party library. Also the plugin will need access to the QTable internal array of ALL rows, filter method and order columns.\nPS : Do we want the exported file to keep the same row order and row filter as we see ?. Well, this is a really quick response @rstoenescu, thank you for your time.\nBut I'm out of time actually. \n1. Do you have a workaround in the mean time ? \n2. Or, can you explain me what is going on so I can found by myself a workaround ? This component is critical in my choice a framework. I took a look in the dev branch but I did not see the new data-table components. \n3. Is there another more appropriate way to do what I want without having those problems ?\nIdeally I would like a temporary workaround to give you time to release your new version.\nIf I can't fix it permanently or temporary util the new release, I will have to switch to another framework and I would like to avoid that. I even don't know if the bug is related to quasar or dom rendering of vue.js ? Thus, migrating to another framework like could probably bring back this problem and new ones also.. Hi @rstoenescu, \nSorry to annoying you again but if I well understand, I could use the dev branch from NPM and use it until you release quasar 0.15 ? This will allow me to test the new datatable ? But I will be on my own to make things work as some news element like the QTable still not have example yet. Is I'm right ?\nBest regards,. My fault, sorry. You're right, none is required to cancel the sort I had not thought about it.\nThank you for your time..

No problem, I'm using quasar-future since two week and I mostly learn using the dev exemple folder.

You will noticed that table is loosing its pagination controls too.. @rstoenescu, I forgot, but we should also protect from having a page index inferior to 1 ?. No problem, as long as it fixed ;) Do you fix setting an unknown sort column order too ?. It a matter of opinion but I don't think you should store UI (vue) element in vuex. Vuex is more like a model, or a database (if compared with back-end side) if you want. \nDisplaying a notification box or a loading message should remain the responsibility of the view.\nIf you absolutely want to use Vuex this way, I would rather use a multiple state like\n```js\n// States in the store\nmessage: {\n  show: false;\n  message: null,\n  type: 'info',\n}\n// Mutation\nmessageChanged(state, newMsg) {\n    state.message = newMsg;\n}\n// Action\ndoSomething(store) {\n  new Promise(resolve => {\n      store.commit('messageChanged', {\n         show: true;\n         message: 'Starting something',\n         type: 'info',\n      });\n      resolve();\n  });\n}\n```\nOn the vue side, you could watch this state\n```jsx\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#q-app',\n  data: function () {\n},\n  created() {\n     // Call you action, this will mutate the store's message value\n     this.message();\n  },\n  methods: {\n      ...mapActions('myStore', ['doSomething']),\n  },\n  computed: {\n     ...mapState('myStore', ['message']),\n  },\n  watch: {\n     // Watch the store's message state\n     message(newMsg) {\n         if (newMsg && newMsg.show) {\n            this.$q.notify(...)\n         } else {\n           // Hide notify\n         }\n    },\n  }\n})\n```. > supportIE only polyfills what quasar uses. --@pdanpdan\nThis is weird as the IE polyfill contains the prototype for adding the finally method but quasar does not use them at all. I search in all the code of the quasar repo and no trace of finally usage... Why put that in ?\n\n.catch(() = {}).then(something) --@pdanpdan\n\nFrom what I've read and test, this version will not work for a special case that I have. I need to throw an error in the catch, so the next then will not be fired. BUT, when using a finally it get fired properly.\nAn ex :\n```js\nPromise.resolve()\n   .then( () => ) {\n       // Show a loading message...\n       throw new Error('foo');\n    })\n   .catch((ex) => {\n       // Log the error...\n   // Rethrow it\n   throw ex;\n\n})\n   .finally(() => {\n       // Hide the loading message...\n    })\n```\nDo you know another way to get it working as a finally ?. Yes, your're right @pdanpdan, this is a solution I had considered, but I would have liked to avoid duplicate code. Now I've no choice.\nIs there a chance the polyfill ie-compat be fixed to test for the support of Promise.finally instead of only testing for the support of Promise ?\nI would be more than please to make the PR but I'm not sure to really understand how this polyfill work and how it detect the missing support..

Is there a built version for iOS or does this require the build system to prepare the .styl files?. Hrm, well yes I saw that - but it still isn't really clear enough for my use case which I'd thought was reasonably standard (just using the components in an existing project, not taking the whole build system/cli or starting with the template app):\n\nthat's main.js in the template app, which requires installing template app to see/get that explanatory line;\nit requires a css file that  doesn't appear to exist in node_modules/quasar-framework and so must be put there by the quasar-cli build system;\nrequiring the css itself needs browserify/webpack rule etc\nuses a global _THEME variable that wouldn't be present when just importing (or is it just meant to be a placeholder?)\n\nAnd so on. To be clear - is it not possible to just do the following without using the template app /cli?\nhtml\n<template>\n  <q-checkbox />  <!--I can get this to appear but with no styles applied - \nthought they would just be applied care of qcheckbox.vue having a <style> tag but appears to not be the case? -->\n</template>\n```javascript\n\nimport Quasar from 'quasar-framework';</p>\n<p>Vue.use(Quasar);</p>\n<p>function(){\n    new Vue({\n        el: '#q-app',\n    })\n}\n\n```\nThanks very much for your help with this. I'm just trying to understand whether quasar can be used as a component toolkit, or whether it needs all the cli etc which we can't really switch to mid-project. All the 'basic usage' sections for the components show how to drop in the component assuming the setup has already been done by the build system/template app, but without the info above anywhere that you need to import Quasar, Vue.use it, etc.. OK, thank you very much for that clarification.

There are a lot of reasons, most\nimportant one being that Quasar is not just a component library. It deals\nwith much much more. Themeing assumes there are some CSS classes attached\nto the body. Cordova needs its own JS to be included and Quasar deals with\nstarting a Cordova app with the help of Quasar.start() method. Reasons\nafter reasons.

    "pdanpdan": "I think the problem is that Vue DevTools tries to access the computed properties of the component when it's rendered, and this code throws an error because this.model is not an array when type is list or radio.\noptModel () {\n  /* Used by multiple selection only */\n  return this.options.map(opt => this.model.includes(opt.value))\n},\nThe code should return false when this.model is not array. I just checked with the latest edge and the error is still there.\nAnd the optModel computed prop is not changed.\nThe Vue DevTools show optModel:\"(error during evaluation)\" as expected. I know it's not used, but it's defined and inspector tools try to compute it.\n. :) Fixed and working as expected, thank you very much.. Sorry for the delay.\nIn chrome the toggle, checkbox and radio are formatted by browser stylesheet with:\n:focus {\n    outline: -webkit-focus-ring-color auto 5px;\n}\nOn the toggle it looks really good.\nOn the checkbox it's a little bit too light.\nBut I think the general ideea to put an outline when in focus is good.\nOn iOS theme I'm sorry, I'm not used to it, but I'll try to see how it shows native.. Closing as it's already solved :). Sorry, misread, it's not fixed.. It can be computed in userland, this is just the glue to allow it to be displayed. The name was a derivate of actualValue. Maybe the old staticLabel is better?. Not good yet, need some more work.. Sorry, I just found a corner case where it was not working - multiline text button.\nI'll try some more fixes and come back.. I managed to fix it for good, for all test cases I could think of.\nIt takes a little extra markup, but I hope it's ok.. Added fix for QRange label. Maybe I missed some details, but I can see no way to do this:\n- 1 .row container with 2 cells inside\n- you want them to be full width on <=sm\n- you want them to fill the row on > sm, and have independent, not predefined sizes\nWhat I can think of is .row>.col-sm-grow. This would only create equal or predefined size splits.\nFor the moment breakpoint specific .col-auto is implemented, leaving .col-grow as an orphan.. Ok, I'll keep it in userland :). I think I found the problem - please check if you can reproduce the problem any more.. nope, not there yet. Now it is fixed - the animation delay was causing some strange effects if multiple tab sets shared the same model.. - \"disabled\" attribute has a global CSS rule to apply disabled cursor and fading (same thing can be obtain using \"disabled\" class)\n- Quasar components use a property named \"disable\" (action, not state) to tell if the component should be disabled or not. 1. On QCollapsible - only apply disabled class (or attribute) on the list item that toggles the collapse (not on the whole components, as this would apply the style on the child content) - so on the wrapper.\n2. Fork the project, npm build and copy dist is the simplest method\n3. You can also fork and change package.json to publish in your own repository in master and use that as source in your project. The bug in vue is vuejs/vue#6093, but it's about broken inject on merge.\nI think the warn on missing inject property will stay after the fix.. As far as I know, there is no way to sanitize html (and cover all cases). The only bulletproof way to be safe with user provided data is to write to textContent (so v-text/mustache).\nAdding a safe option (default false) will make the framework treat content as unsafe by default and allow us to switch the behavior on request.. Hi.\n1. Do you think it's an expected user case to have multiple entries in options, with same value but different display options?\n2. This does not solve the problem when value is a non string/number primitive (bool) or an object\nMaybe it would be better to use JSON.stringify(opt) as key. Do you think you can extend the PR to fix all \\:key with possible non string/number values?\nIf not I can try to do it.. Ah, I didn't think of circular references :(\nI'll take a look and maybe I can come up with something.\nThe problem with index key is that the key is used for deciding when to redraw an element. So if you have select options [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] and update them to [\"x\", \"y\"] you'll end up with \"a\" and \"b\" displayed.. Try to move import Vue before import Quasar. You can use https://quasar-framework.org/components/page-sticky.html#Expand-mode. Can you please give some more info:\n- browser version/platform\n- do you use any custom styles in browser (non default global font size?), or zoom\n- a screen shot of the whole table\n- which columns were sticky (left/right and how many). And what is different from v-model where you set them to false in data?. Can you please check if you don't have some sort of auto-brightness feature on your monitor?. The problem is I cannot reproduce, and I checked the css and nothing seems to change.. I'll try linux + chrome this evening, maybe I find something.. It's not ok. Need more work.. It looks like the first version was the right one. Do you know of a way to provide from a functional component? I tried it and it doesn't seem to work.. It looks like it's not implemented, so I would leave it as it is now.. What is the desired behavior for the model when the selected options in model are disabled?\nFor the moment it'll stay as it is.. Disable purifyCSS in config.. The prop is disable.. https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/12958. It looks very nice and functional.\nTwo things\n1. Focus: check it on the selects with chips and with clear button:\n  - open the select, select a value (or use a select with a value already set)\n  - now click on remove chip or on clear\n  - the select stays selected (correct) but the popup looses focus\n2. Mouse/keyboard double navigation\n  - you should use the same color for both\n  - when mouse hovers over an option you should also change the keyboard focus to that option. It looks good (I only checked functionality). I'll have a look on the code also.\n\nPlease move focusable prop to mixins/option and change it to noFocus: Boolean (it's easier to use), and also add a computed properties\njavascript\nfocusable () {\n  return !this.noFocus && !this.disable\n},\ntabIndex () {\n  return this.focusable ? 0 : null\n}\nand then use these 2 computed properties in QCheckbox, QRadio and QToggle\nUse the color set for select to highlight the selected option in the list\n\n. It'll be fixed in the upcoming version. Can you do a console.log(refreshDoneCallback) in your method. Or put a breakpoint/add a debugger statement there and inspect.. You need to import material icons in main.js. Hello.\n\n\nIn the current version there is indeed a problem with loosing focus when clicking on attached buttons.\nIn the next version (quasar-future/v0.15) this is fixed.\n\n\nWatch out that for the moment v-model does not accept .lazy modifier for components (there is a PR for vuejs/vue#6914 waiting for integration)\nMeanwhile you can use the expanded form of\njavascript\n:value=\"newData\" @change=\"val => { newData = typeof val === 'string' ? val.trim() : '' }\"\n\n\nBut from what I understand you should use http://quasar-framework.org/components/chips-input.html. Are you sure you're in the right place?. Hi. Can you explain when do you find this behavior, because I cannot reproduce it?. I can reproduce the sample case (fill on focus).\nThe problem is your solution is always one letter behind the input text.\nAnd to be honest I find the current behavior to be the expected one (like if I fill an autocomplete on focus I would expect it to open with suggestions). What version of Vue do you use?\nCan you provide web access to a demo showing the problem?. Yes, debounce setting the model.\nFrom vuelidate:\n\nValidator is evaluated on every data change, as it is essentially a computed value. If you need to throttle an async call, do it on your data change event, not on the validator itself. You may end up with broken Vue observables otherwise.\n. In 0.15 the behavior will be configurable:\n- input events are emitted on any change\n- change event is emitted on close, if the new value is different from the one passed to the control (the model)\n\nSo:\n- if used with v-model the behavior will be that the model changes on each change in the control\n- if used with the upcoming v-model.lazy (or with :value=\"model\" @change=\"value => model = value\" @input=\"value => DO_SOMETHING_ON_EACH_CHANGE\") the model will only change on control close. This is trivial to implement in user code.\nhttps://codepen.io/pdanpdan/pen/NLROBy\nhtml\n<div class=\"shadow-2 row\">\n  <q-btn flat label=\"-\" :repeat-timeout=\"1000\" @click=\"() => { model -= 1; }\" />\n  <q-input type=\"number\" class=\"col\" align=\"right\" hide-underline v-model=\"model\" />\n  <q-btn flat label=\"+\" :repeat-timeout=\"1000\" @click=\"() => { model += 1; }\" />\n</div>. Can you please share the code that produces this problem?\nIf this is not possible then please attach a screenshot of the chrome inspector (with styles) when you have the helper or the error-label selected in inspector.. Use something along this lines:\nIn page:\nhtml\n<q-page-container>\n  <transition enter-active-class=\"animated fadeIn\" leave-active-class=\"animated fadeOut\" mode=\"out-in\" :duration=\"200\" @after-leave=\"$root.$emit('triggerScroll')\">\n    <router-view />\n  </transition>\n</q-page-container>\nIn router initialization:\njs\nconst Router = new VueRouter({\n  ...\n  scrollBehavior: (to, from, savedPosition) => new Promise((resolve) => {\n    const position = savedPosition || {};\n    if (!savedPosition) {\n      if (to.hash) {\n        position.selector = to.hash;\n      }\n      if (to.matched.some((m) => m.meta.scrollToTop)) {\n        position.x = 0;\n        position.y = 0;\n      }\n    }\n    Router.app.$root.$once('triggerScroll', () => {\n      Router.app.$nextTick(() => resolve(position));\n    });\n  }),\n  routes,\n});. You can do it like this:\nhtml\n<q-btn class=\"full-width\" align=\"between\">\n  <q-icon name=\"wifi\" />\n  <div class=\"col\">Text</div>\n  <q-icon name=\"wifi\" class=\"invisible\" />\n</q-btn>. @dhalsted Can you check this one: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mKZJoV\nThe keyboard should be the numeric one by default, but if it's missing . you can only press the toggle to switch to full keyboard.. If you use staticData and you want to search for something else than the value that's going to be set you just have to replace the filtering function. The default one is\njavascript\nexport default function (terms, {field, list}) {\n  const token = terms.toLowerCase()\n  return list.filter(item => ('' + item[field]).toLowerCase().startsWith(token))\n}\nBut I think it would be strange from a usability perspective to search for something and then display something else.\nOn the other hand, if you just need the full object selected then you just need to add a listener on the selected event:\njavascript\n@selected=\"obj => do_something_with_object(obj)\". Generating the data is under your control in that case. Just put the desired value to be set under the value key. It's the same as putting the info to be displayed under label, sublabel, icon, .... And the file where you get the error?. http://quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-upgrade-guide.html#Upgrading-to-Quasar-v0-15. Can you please open the inspector in IE and paste the errors here?. Did you set Platform as plugin in quasar.conf.js?. 1. For tooltip control on QFab show/hide you can hook to @show and @hide and toggle a visibility controlling variable for the tooltip\n2. QBtn has 2 props: fab and fab-mini that generates round buttons the same size as the QFab (or a small version in case of mini). It looks like it's a problem from FA css definition.\nYou can fix it by applying a specific width on that icon. I think you're not using the IE specific tweaks, as specified here:\nhttp://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-supporting-ie.html\nAh, I see the border - I'll take a look. UglifyJs does not support ES6. You either can not use uglify at all or change it to a newer version that supports ES6. But considering that 0.15 was released with new cli that manages webpack config I think you should consider upgrading.. It means that there is a PR in Vue for implementing lazy modifier for v-model on custom components, but it's not yet merged.. @input event is emitted each time some interaction is performed on the control (even if it's not changing the model). If you use v-model then on each @input the value of the model is changed.\n@change event is emitted only when the control changes are considered done (let's simplify and consider on blur) AND when the internal model of the control is different from the external model.\nSo if you use v-model your internal and external models are always in sync, so no @change is emitted.\nIf you use :value=\"model\" @change=\"val => { model = val; do_something_with(val)}\" then you'll have @change events.. Good point, it's not exposed. I'll fix it.. If you need it it's __keyboardMoveCursor(offset) but it's an internal method, interface may change.. It's working exactly like this. What version are you using? It was fixed in 0.15.3. That one or you can use the internal __keyboardSetCurrentSelection() - sets the value that is shown as selected in list. But watch out that it's internal and implementation may change.\nmove and setCurrentSelection are not available any more, and close was renamed to hide.\nFor move(offset) there is an internal __keyboardMoveCursor(offset).. Check these ones too:\nhttps://github.com/hilongjw/vue-lazyload\nhttps://github.com/alexjoverm/v-lazy-image\nThe second one seems light enough to include.. But what would be the use case for what you tried?  If there are many buttons and long ones you should use something else.. And the question is?. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=firebase+spa+config. Looks good to me. Can you please provide a code to check? Use one of the preconfigured ones in issue template. Because I think the css is scoped in that component. Use a bg-color class on body or put that style in the global css. You should just use v-touch-hold:600=\"handler\". What you are inspecting in java is the preflight request (the one with method OPTIONS).\nYou should process preflight requests in your application and send the correct response (including CORS header response).\nIt has nothing to do with Quasar.. It looks like it's related to ripple. I'll investigate further.\nThis is the exact code you're using? Can you try closing the double quote after true in all cases and try again?. You can check a working example here: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/2c3b4f0c0d8ed52013a35a86450736985a927e56/dev/components/global/dialog.vue#L78. Can you please repost the sample - the link is not available anymore.. You can target this with CSS: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MVrZxg. Which would be the use case for a notification you want to keep visible after selecting an action?\nThe action should act as an acknowledge for the notification.\nI think you can show another notification after the current one closes, because I would expect the action from the first one changes something.. Try to provide console messages from the browser on the phone.\nhttps://blog.idrsolutions.com/2015/02/remote-debugging-ios-safari-on-os-x-windows-and-linux/. For this you can use it as a component. Due to security reasons you cannot use HTML markup in message.. What you have in the example is 4 distinct context menus. They do not communicate with each other in any way.\nYou should either register the active one and hide it when another is activated or use only one context menu on the whole parent and customize it according to the target clicked.. It's the same padding (none) used for normal lists.\nBut you can put a q-pr-md on the QListHeader.. I think you want something like this:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/b94w5oyf/43/. As\n- iOS 8 is old and the current one is iOS 11 (all iOS < 10 is less then 7%)\n- iOS 8 lacks a lot of javascript features used in Quasar\n- iPhone 5's latest iOS is 10\nI don't think it can be supported.\nThe same answer goes for #1850.\nAccording to https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Compatibility-Note\nand https://caniuse.com/#feat=es5\nyou should go with at least iOS 10.2.. http://quasar-framework.org/components/modal.html#Basic-Usage\n\nModals are responsive to the width of the window (see demo on a desktop and resize browser window). Sometimes you need to always have a Modal maximized or minimized regardless of window width, so to do this, Quasar offers the minimized and maximized props\n. There are components that work different on wide vs. narrow screens or on mat vs. ios theme or on mobile vs. desktop.\nAs a general rule modals go fullscreen (if not used with minimized) on narrow screens, some pickers go modal on mobile, layout drawers use overlay on narrow screen, layout padding varies with screen width, ....

I'll try to enhance the docs for this.. And how would the user know the dialog was canceled?. A dialog cancel is not the intended behavior, but an expected behavior, and should be treated - in the same way that 4xx response should be.. This is related to refocusing after the dialog is closed. I would say it's the normal behavior, because after dialog close the button has focus again and the tooltip shows on focus also.. Maybe it would be more flexible if we add props to disable add and delete (noAdd, noDelete).\nThat way it would just be:\n\nhtml\n<q-chips-input  v-model=\"model\" :no-add=\"model.length > 2\" />\nAnd this will also allow other use cases, like checking if some values are present.. @rstoenescu This is a general problem for QPopover when it's inside something that has .scroll class.\nNeeds examination and maybe a refactoring.\nDue to QPopover.js#102. In the newest version no, none (or none that I can think of). I think we'll leave this as it is now.\nReason:\n- autocomplete does not restrict input to be one from the list\n- we have improved kdb navigation that would select current option when navigate with UP/DOWN\n\nwe have a list ['aaa', 'bbb']\nwe type a, in order to type abc => we would get aaa with no way to type abc. I'll take a look on this and #2156 - it wasn't designed with scroll in mind in the beginning.. And it's so simple to pass ['Yes', 'No'].map(value => ({value, label: value})). @smolinari\nWhat has i18n to do with the values he should pass   to options?.

Thank you for the repo.. Can you please also show the code (just the input with autocomplete) to see the settings (static or dynamic data, min chars, ...). Why do you want to add overflow-y: auto?\nIt's going to change the way the framework is designed to work.. The problem is with quasar not having typescript integration yet. It should work without problems with js.. @andrei7777 There is no official support for typescript yet.. You should first check if the ref is available in your component. So use:\nif (this.$refs.loadingBar) {\n  this.$refs.loadingBar.$on('stop', () => {\n    console.log(\"ajax-bar stop\");\n  });\n}\nAnd also check where in the vue lifecycle you're trying to acces it.\nBut you already have events emitted, so the normal way is:\n<q-ajax-bar :delay=\"delay\" :speed=\"speed\" :color=\"color\" @start=\"doSomethingOnStart\" @stop=\"doSomethingOnStop\" />. Please create a fiddle to show the problem.. It should be fixed in the latest release. Choose an year near the lower or upper limit and you'll be provided with a new range.. Each item (object) in the list for before and after has some boolean properties that determine when to show the icon:\n\ncondition\ncontent\nerror\nwarning\n\nThe icon is shown when the boolean value is the same with the condition it checks.\nSo:\n\ncondition = true => visible\n\ncondition = false => hidden\n\n\ncontent = true => visible when field has content (model has content)\n\n\ncontent = false => visible when field has no content (model has no content)\n\n\nerror = true => visible when field has error\n\nerror = false => visible when field has no error\n\nIn your fiddle you have content: false so the trash can icon is visible when you have no content in field. Did you set build/rtl to true in quasar.conf?\n. Can you please remove the focus and emit as requested?. You can do it like this: https://codepen.io/pdanpdan/pen/GXNrpv\nFeel free to style it some more to fit your needs.. Either wrap the QCard in a <div> with padding or add a margin to QCard.\n. I just checked and it looks fine. Can you check if you have IE compatibility flat turned on in quasar.conf?. Sorry, I was testing it on the current branch, not on the released one. It's fixed by Razvan and it will be available in the next release.. Everything looks fine - the modal opens and you get a scrollbar.\nI tested it on both desktop (visible scrollbar) and on mobile (overlay scrollbar) and it's working.\nCan you give some more details?. .col-sm-6 means from sm upwards make it 50%\nBut there is no specification on what to do when below sm.\nYou should add a col-12 if you want it full-with below - the behavior in 0.16 was inconsistent, as it can be seen in https://jsfiddle.net/hf4qbcdw/2/ (below breakpoint the 2 rows should have been identical). The duplicate event it's going to be removed, thanks for spotting.\n@smolinari \nThe reason for toggle not working is simple: when you click on the toggle button the popover starts to hide, and then the toggle sends the command to toggle, so the popover shows again.\nIn this case you should use persistent prop on q-popover like in https://jsfiddle.net/2hujktwr/2/. You should use some class/style on the fields in order to specify the width if you place them inside .row.\nLike adding class=\"col\" on QSelect. The value is correct, only the display is broken. Fixed for the next version.\nDuplicate of #2479. If you use it inside QModal:\n- either add a v-if=\"opened\" on <q-stepper ... in order to only render it when the modal is open - that is because default is evaluated on mount (it doesn't know your modal is hidden) - https://codepen.io/pdanpdan/pen/VGKOJK\n- or (much better) use v-model=\"currentStep\" on <q-stepper and put currentStep: 'first' in data - https://codepen.io/pdanpdan/pen/rZMENX. According to this https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html the cursor should be pointer on hover.. Can you please try with the latest version of the framework, and also provide a fiddle that can reproduce the problem?.

Please make a PR on the documentation. On the documentation page click the pen icon.. First you should add the dialog plugin to plugins.\nSecond you cannot use it outside Vue.. I don't undestand the request? Do you need <q-jumbotron class=\"q-px-none\"...?. 1. Vue does not yet support .lazy modifier on components (you have this described in docs - https://quasar-framework.org/components/input-textfield.html#Directive-Modifiers-for-v-model)\n\nI don't understand what you mean by styling\nYou can use the built-in debounce if you use QSearch\n. I still fail to see what style are you taking about. .lazy is just syntactic sugar for :value/@change and it works just fine. The debounce your using is not a good match with QInput, and as I mentioned you are already provided with debounce if you use QSearch.\n\nFixed example: https://jsfiddle.net/zw8rv62b/. This is related to how we are considering a disabled component - now you cannot change the visibility state (neither show nor hide).. ~Please create a fiddle to show the problem.~\nIgnore it, I found the problem. Will be fixed in the next version.. It looks like the events are correct:\n- when using keyboard navigation you get focus and blur when you get the control in focus and when you blur it\n- when using mouse/touch to click you get them focus+blur because that's what's happening - you can test it by trying to press ENTER after you click the control - nothing happens - then press TAB/SHIFT+TAB and you'll see the focus event. What browser are you using, what OS? I cannot reproduce it.\nThe $ icon is on the left, not right. Are you by any chance using RTL?\nThere is a reason for the template for bug reports - to reduce the guessing.. I got it, thanks for reporting.. I can reproduce the problem - the most annoying is the reverse: mouse-down outside and mouse-up inside.\nFrom the perspective of expected behaviour mouse-down inside and mouse-up outside is expected.\nBut I think it would be safest to require both down and up outside to trigger close.. Sorry, I cannot reproduce.\nPlease create a fiddle where you can reproduce it.\nAlso in the animation there is something (a black bar like scroll) on the right - what is it?. This is completely up to the browser.. Uppercase is done using CSS properties. I think you can just convert your string with whatever method you want and use it as a label. (use \u1e9e).. That's exactly the reason this does no belong in the framework. Put the text in uppercase as you wish and then display it with quasar.. And what is wrong with noCaps?. This was implemented some time ago and the solution was not flexible. There are a lot of cases where it would fail.\nThe current solution is simple and allows any use case.. What version of quasar? The one from today?. Yes, I saw it also.. Hi.\nCan you please try this one and report back: https://jsfiddle.net/hat94yrn/16/show/\nI don't have safari, but this works in chrome, firefox and IE..

Hi. For the moment add this style:\n```stylus\n.modal-content, .q-popover\n\n.q-datetime > .q-datetime-header\n    min-width 175px\n```. The fact that:\n\njavascript\nconst\n  a = { a: 1 }, // or [1, 2]\n  b = { a: 1 };  // or [1, 2]\nconsole.log('a === b => ', a === b); // a === b => false\nconsole.log('a == b => ', a == b); // a == b => false\nIs not specific to Quasar or any framework. It's specific to the language (Javascript in this case, and anything that compiles to it).. This should be fixed in the next version (https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/pull/2684). duplicate of https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/2612. autofocus-filter was removed in the latest releases, because it was pointless. If you have a filter in select it's going to be focused.. Use <q-autocomplete value-field=\"label\" to set the value field - it looks like it has default value of value and the field key of staticData is only used when this is empty.. Update on this:\n- prop 'valueField(default 'value') is used to retrieve the value that will be set in the model - it can be a string or a function that receives the whole object and should receive a string\n- keyfieldinstaticDataindicates in which key the search will be performed. You can already customize QScrollArea's scrollbars as you wish. What is the request?. I cannot reproduce it on https://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase/forms/toggle, Chrome 72.. Please make the PR. I supposetheItem` is not initialized with an empty array as it should.. Then set that width on the button, it should work.. I don't understand. What size should the button keep? How could it know what size you want. It can fit to size or respect the size you provide.\nYou can try using col sizing.. Sure. You should show a button to set type of text to paragraph (P). If you have a working implementation please make a PR.\nThank you. You can listen for @input - it's triggered when you press enter.. Can you please make a PR with the files? It would help us a lot.. If you like it more with scrollbar then you can add\nstylus\n.q-body--dialog\n  overflow auto\nto your app.styl file.\nAnother option is to use a <q-layout container class=\"absolute-full\" ...> - this will solve the scrollbars but will not work in IE..

What browser?\nAh, ok, sorry - when there is background.. The date format in input field is set to YYYY/MM/DD for compatibility reasons.\nSee https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/3214. The QInput emits vue type focus event. The other form elements should emit the native focus event, so you can listen on them with onNative in render functions or with on.native in templates.\nDo you have a specific example for where it's not working?\nIf you have please add a codepen with what is not working.\nThank you.. javascript\nconst prefix = ['-webkit-', '-moz-', '-ms-', '-o-']\nexport function cssTransform (val) {\n  let o = {transform: val}\n  prefix.forEach(p => {\n    o[p + 'transform'] = val\n  })\n  return o\n}. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gqJbQr\nIf your model is the value and the options have objects then you need to use map-options.\nIf your options have objects and you want to have just the value in model then use emit-value.\nI put in the pen the 3 most common use cases.. Sorry, I forgot about this. I'll take a look tomorrow morning.. I looked into the problem and I'm sorry to say that keep-alive is not going to work.\nFor the normal situations it's easy to keep state (use store), but for the specific issue of input file you will not be able to refill the list.\nPlease leave this open and if we can think of something we'll post here.. This has nothing to do with quasar. It's related to Windows permissions and intermittent and random errors with npm and/or yarn.. In conf you have firebase as plugin name but the file in bout is firestore.js?. Can anyone test it in a safari with tabs? It might be related to this.. In the video it looks like safari has tabs on top (browser tabs).. @Jeremywhiteley Can you please do some inspection in the console and report if you have errors/warnings. Also inspect the menu and try to find out what looks wrong.\nThank you for helping us with this beta version of IOS.. After release you'll have to add class col-shrink to QTabs tag.. I added it in the toolbar with tabs example. I don't know what to say about the upgrade guide as it wasn't working before.. The problem is I cannot reproduce.\nCan you associate the warnings with some action you do in the page?. I hope it was because an old version of the scrips that were cached. The problem was present but it should have been fixed in beta 2. If it happens again please comment here.. Can you please create a small codepen showing the problem? Thank you.. Just import notify in vuex file and use it. If the plugin is active in conf it will work exactly as this.$q.notify. supportIE only polyfills what quasar uses. Just replace .finally(something), which is not well supported, with .then(something, something) or with .catch(() => true).then(something). In your case just hide loading message in catch before throw.. It's related to 045f978022f5c4699614c4f6c5c27297c498440c I think. I'll check.. It's a select - you're not using the use-input for anything.\nIt is not expected to delete the model if you press backspace if you don't make it do so.. What are you using it for now?\nYou can use it to filter or you can use it to add new values.\nCheck https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-components/select#Filtering-and-autocomplete\nand https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-components/select#Create-new-values.. In the sample you linked to you did nothing with the input.\nAlso why would you need to reset model when you start to filter? The model should change on selection, not on filtering (in the normal usage).. I can see. From the point of view of expected functionality the second example is a nightmare - why would you want to do this? If you click on a standard html select do you expect to lose the value? The model should only change if you select another option, not if you change the subset of options you see in the list.. https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-components/input#External-validation. Please provide a codepen with your code.. Then I don't see how I can see the problem.\nI can guess you forgot to set v-model.. QPopupProxy searches for a parent with overflow class.\nAdd an overflow-auto class like here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/moMXGp?editors=1010. Add a relative-position class on router-link - it has no styling by default.\nLike this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xBLYOb. https://v1.quasar-framework.org/start/umd#Quasar-Global-Object. You can use the @hide listener on the QDialog - it is triggered after the dialog is done hiding.. disable, not disabled. Ok, I found it, I'll make a PR soon.. Sorry, I cannot reproduce it. Can you please provide a codepen, or a repo to check?. Use emit-value and map-options like here:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/2wknjdut/\nor like in the docs\nhttps://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-components/select#Affecting-model. Yep, it's fixed in the next release.\nI just put here (https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZPaVjJ?editors=1000) the fix (CSS tab, the only rule there) so if you need it right now you can use this.. I need you to check something.\nReverse the order of tabs (first Members then Dashboard) and tell me which of them remains on the wrong option.. Please make a short test for me - add \"quasar\": \"https://github.com/pdanpdan/quasar#quasar-v1.0.0-beta.10-gitpkg\", in your application's package.json under \"dependencies\".\nDo a yarn && quasar dev and tell me if you can still reproduce it.. Can you please try again with \"quasar\": \"https://github.com/pdanpdan/quasar#quasar-v1.0.0-beta.10.1-gitpkg\",. I need the to and fullPath for all 3 tabs.. The :to set in each QRouteTab (and also if you set exact on them).\nAnd please also hover with mouse over the QRouteTabs and tell me what you have in href.. I have one more idea. Are you changing to more than one route one after another very fast from code?. No, sorry, it was autoclosed, please reopen.. Ok, time for https://github.com/pdanpdan/quasar#quasar-v1.0.0-beta.10.2-gitpkg. Can you replace on that last version\njavascript\n  watch: {\n    $route () {\n      this.__checkActivation()\n    }\n  },\nwith \njavascript\n  watch: {\n    $route () {\n      this.$nextTick(this.__checkActivation)\n    }\n  },. Or better, replace it with\njavascript\n  watch: {\n    $route () {\n      this.__checkActivation()\n    },\n    to () {\n      this.__checkActivation()\n    },\n    append () {\n      this.__checkActivation()\n    }\n  },\nAnd use object form for route's :to (using name and params). https://github.com/pdanpdan/quasar#quasar-v1.0.0-beta.10.3-gitpkg\nIt's a debug build.\nPlease clear console and perform a navigation. I would like the details in the console.. https://github.com/pdanpdan/quasar#quasar-v1.0.0-beta.10.4-gitpkg. https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/pull/3592. Hi. Just add a @click.stop on <q-input .... The header in QTree allows tree item selection on click.\nIt is up to you in userland to know if the custom header should allow selection or not.\nIf you want to allow selection on click (default) then all controls in the header will lose focus because the focus goes to tree item.\nIf you want to allow controls in header the you need to prevent click event propagation.\nI'll try to add this to documentation.. Just wrap the controls in a div container with @click.stop\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/VRXRdv?editors=1010. A, but of course. Click, SPACE and ENTER selects the item.\njavascript\n<div @click.stop @keyup.13.32.stop>\nI updated the codepen.. The problem is real, even if a little strange.\nFor the moment it works only if you do not use emit-value and map-options.\n. The problem is real, even if a little strange.\nFor the moment it works only if you do not use emit-value and map-options.\n. Use focusin an focusout events like explained here: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/3317. Please provide a codepen with your code. Also what os, what browser.\nHere everything looks good: https://v1.quasar-framework.org/vue-components/date\n. Done. Fixed. Sorry, didn't realize it.. Please also add SPACE as selection toggle. Use a more appropriate name like listMaxHeight and use an empty default. Let's wait for Razvan's opinion on this also. (@rstoenescu). I had to revert this as it was causing problems with tooltip/popover. this should be an else if. In this case it should be:\njavascript\nif (this.autoselect) {\n  input.select()\n  input.focus()\n}\nelse if (this.autofocus) {\n  input.focus()\n}\nor\njavascript\nif (this.autoselect) {\n  input.select()\n}\nif (this.autoselect || this.autofocus) {\n  input.focus()\n}\nas it makes no sense to select but not to focus (and it would be redundant to ask to have both set).. sorry, .focus (). Fixed duplicate this.enterKey = true.\nIt matters to have it set because it blocks reopening the popover with the list when the value is set in parent.. The idea is like this:\n- parent component of QAutocomplete has a shadow property that keeps the value as val - this is updated according to debouncing and some delays for processing\n- if we listen for input from the parent we're going to get in val the value before the last key press \n- if we listen for changes in val we get the correct value every time, but that value we are sometimes updating from the autocomplete, so we want to skip showing the options in that case. Please use .q-item__section--side ~ .q-item__section--side.\nThis will hide any .q-item__section--side except the first one.. ",

I tested this. Works as you said, except I could click anywhere on the page and the tooltip did go away.. UPDATE This is actually working as expected. The toggles DO show. The control is on the right side of the page. There is an issue here, just not what I thought. When you are NOT using chips the text in the select, exceeds the width of the control and the dropdown that shows up is way off of the screen and therefore the toggles weren't showing up.\nStill trying to figure out why the width of the control is growing with multiple text in the select and the ellipse class on the control is not working as expected.. The fix is to add the max-width to the q-field:\n<q-field style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; max-width: 100%;\">. https://jsfiddle.net/Hawkeye64/px5zL93m/35/. @rstoenescu Did you take a peek at the fiddle?. Excellent! Thanks @rstoenescu for helping me think outside the box on this one. :). Popovers close after selection, click outside of the popover, or ESC. Use a modal if you want it to stay until directed to close.. How was the array modified? Vue can detect the change (if done right) and it will automagically work.\nExcerpt from https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html:\n```\nArray Change Detection\nMutation Methods\nVue wraps an observed array\u2019s mutation methods so they will also trigger view updates. The wrapped methods are:\npush()\npop()\nshift()\nunshift()\nsplice()\nsort()\nreverse()\n. First, you should read this: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html\nA direct property is a first-class citizen. Vue puts a watch on it. If you use a nested object (second-class citizen), the watch won't pick it up. Therefore, you have to let vue know there is a change by setting it like this (from my own code) in my mutations.js:\nexport const setSideListSelected = (state, selected) => {\n  Vue.set(state.sideList, 'selected', selected)\n}\n```\nsideList is a nested object with 'selected' being one of the items. The third parameter is the value to set the nested property.\nHope that helps!. Don't take this PR yet - it is wrong :( I'm such a GIT noob. This is now an app extension. Can you please look at the following:\n1) Min and Max example: It looks off to me.\n2) No Motion Example: I could not get this to work as expected.. Do you want me to fix them and do a new PR?\n. Sorry for the mess. I did my work in 'dev'. Forgot to create a branch, which I did, then did a PR. Just cherry-pick the QImg one at the bottom.\n. It's a lost soul :). This feels as if it was added to the wrong repo.. You mean something like this? https://codepen.io/Hawkeye64/pen/BbBLGg. Is this an emulator?

Agreed, overlay prop should not affect initial state set by developer.. Maybe the popover also needs a v-if? Or, perhaps I should be using v-show?. That didn't work. What I did find out is that the behavior on this QPopup seems to be affecting the behavior of another QPopup on the toolbar (of which I have many). So, when the error occurs I no longer have a Dropdown list in QPopup because that code crashed. I'll investigate on my end why this one in particular is being affected.\nSo, can we adjust the code to check for null?. ok, putting a v-show on the other popup worked. No issues.. Is this something that should be added to the docs or upgrade guide?On Feb. 27, 2019 11:00 a.m., Popescu Dan notifications@github.com wrote:After release you'll have to add class col-shrink to QTabs tag.\n\u2014You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread..

    "jsfeldman": "I'm using v0.12. Awesome! Thanks.. I believe I'm experiencing the same issue (except I'm trying to listen to @input). It seems to only occur on q-select types that are multiple (like toggle and checkbox). I think it might be due to this.emit('input', value) not being called when optModel changes, but I could be misunderstanding the code.. I think I might have a unique case that's not fixed if you pass arguments in your getters and use their method of form handling\nFor instance, my HTML looks roughly like this:\n<template v-for=\"prop in obj\">\n  <q-select type=\"checkbox\" :value=\"getArr(prop)\" @input=\"setArr({value: $event, prop})\"></q-select>\n</template>\nand my store looks like this:\n```\nconst state = {\n  obj: {\n    foo: [],\n    bar: [],\n    baz: []\n  }\n}\nconst getters = {\n  getArr: (state, getters) => (prop) => {\n    return state.obj[prop]\n  }\n}\nconst mutations = {\n  setArr (state, {prop, value}) => {\n    state.obj[prop] = value\n  }\n}\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\n  state,\n  getters,\n  mutations\n})\n```\nIt seems that the @input function isn't triggered in this scenario. But it looks like it works using a regular select element.\nThis may be too weird of a use case to bother fixing though haha.. Hmm, the only documentation I could find on vuelidate about debouncing is delayed validation errors, which, based on the example, looks like the validation is run whenever you make a change and just doesn't set $dirty, or $error until the specified time has passed.\nThe only way I can think of debouncing before the validation function is called is if you debounced when setting the value in the v-model. I guess you could achieve that by using :value and @input instead of v-model, and make the function @input calls a debounced one. But since vuelidate already has functionality for working with promises in the validation, and you might not want the field itself to be debounced, just the validation, I thought this would be simpler. Is there another way to debounce before validation I'm not thinking of?\nIn terms of the idea of debounced promises in general, I was just thinking that a debounced promises is essentially a superset of the current implementation and would be nice to have. It would save users time finding and implementing another implementation with little change to the codebase.\n  . Ahh, thanks! I completely glossed over that section. I always feel a little uneasy when the v-model value is not synced with the input field value, but i guess they have their reasons.. For some reason when writing these issues I never think to look at the v0.14 branch, haha. I see what the issue is. Looks like it's fixed in the current branch. I'll close this. Thanks.. ",

I guess that yes, I just wanted when the directive executes a method I could pass a parameter to the method.

What you are saying it's like the other touch directives (one single parameter as object with that properties as default, no chance of passing a new one from the template). I was suggesting that you could pass a parameter like a key or value from a v-for to the method that the directive executed. Just like a normal method.\nI solved my need by using JavaScript dataset, and looking for closest parent to get the data attribute when the JavaScript event gets fired.. Hmmm. I've done something similar but without the return function and the prop. And if I had for example a dialog trigger in the method it would execute automatically as many times as the directive was repeated by the v-for.\nIt was strange.\nI will try what you suggest.

But each time I do any changes to my code I need to rerun quasar build & phonegap serve.\n. ",

The black-blue palette can become boring quickly. May be it will be good idea to add generic id access interface to most Quasar components ?

    "a47ae": "Glad if it helps improving Quasar. Keep up the good work! :). @mstaack No problem, I wasn't sure mysel at first if this is a real bug :D \nAnd I can only agree on what @spectrolite said, I filed two issues and both were fixed in less than a day!\n@rstoenescu keep up the good work, Quasar is really an awesome project. And enjoy your days off :). In v0.14 you should be able to achieve the desired output by using Transitions.\nhtml\n<q-fixed-position corner=\"bottom-right\" :offset=\"[18, 18]\">\n  <q-transition appear enter=\"zoomIn\" leave=\"zoomOut\">\n    <q-btn round color=\"primary\" @click=\"method\">\n      <q-icon name=\"mail\" />\n    </q-btn>\n  </q-transition>\n</q-fixed-position>\nIn my opinion, this is a more flexible approach, then bake the transition into the FABs directly.. Haha, I am sometimes surprised myself what Quasar offers out of the box, for example, the nifty little helper functions can come in really handy too. :D. @JCharante quasar build is basically the same as npm run build :). On OS X 10.11.6 with Chrome Version 60.0.3112.90 there is a very subtle flickering on the background, which is definitely not there on Safari. But it is not nearly as heavy as in the video and only visible if you look for it.. Can confirm this issue with the example repo.\nThe breakpoints are missing from the prod build.\nIf the purifyCSS variable is set to false it works as expected.. Maybe it has to do with this issue in purifycss \nhttps://github.com/purifycss/purifycss/issues/161\n. Oh sorry, I missed that part in the docs.\nBut does this also work on not static data?\nWhen I tried to pass an object { field: 'label', list: [{ label: 'foo', value: 'bar' }] } to the done callback nothing is displayed at all and the computedResults property is undefined.\n. Yeah, but that brings me back to my initial problem, with dynamic data, always value is displayed as selected field.\nSo this is a breakdown of the code I am using at the moment. It fetches a country from Algolia.\nBut now I want to be able to display the country name as selected value but assign the country code to address.countryCode.\nCurrently, I am unable to display anything other than value as selected when using dynamic data. And because I generate lots of these fields with v-for I am also not able to use the @selected event, because I do not know from which of the multiple fields that event fired.\n```vue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n function parseCountries (countries) {\n   return countries.hits.map(country => {\n     let name = country.locale_names.default[0]\n      return {\n        label: name,\n        value: country.country_code.toUpperCase()\n      }\n    })\n  }\n\n  export default {\n    data () => {\n      return { country: { countryCode: null } }\n    },\n\n    methods: {\n      handleCountrySearch (term, done) {\n        axios.post('https://places-1.algolianet.com/1/places/query', {\n          type: 'country',\n          query: term\n        })\n          .then(response => {\n            done(parseCountries(response.data))\n          })\n      },\n    }\n  }\n\n```. It was decided to not allow HTML in any Quasar component to circumvent XSS attacks.\nHowever, you can use the Dialog as a component as described here: http://quasar-framework.org/components/dialog.html#Basic-Usage-As-a-Component which gives you the ability to style your content the way you want it.. I think simply setting the immediate parameter to true in this line https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/src/components/infinite-scroll/QInfiniteScroll.js#L74 should solve this, I also see no obvious reason why it should be debounced on the first call.. Hey, I hope I understand your proposal correctly, but what you describe is very easily doable in userland. That's why I think adding another prop would only be confusing.\nYou can see this JSFiddle for a small demo of how you can implement this yourself.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/a47ae/waugrryy/1749/. @olegvakulenko Did you take a look at my JSFiddle?\nEnter test and you notice that the clear button disappears.\nYour proposal would need for a clear-value property on all inputs, which in my opinion is unnecessary, as you can do it in userland like shown in my JSFiddle.. Ah sorry, did not notice that :)\nSorry for misunderstanding your intentions, but now makes sense to me. :+1: .

Hah, I had totally forgotten the tie in the space theme in the name Quasar, my idea is kind of mixing metaphors :). ",
    "zuck": "Hi all,\nthanks for your feedback and suggestions!\nA couple of new concept iterations:\n\n. Hi all,\nthanks for your feedback and suggestions!\nA couple of new concept iterations:\n\n. Another little revision of last proposal (which merges both metaphors as suggested by @samhowley):\n\n. @smolinari The problem with perspective is that it'll lose regular shape. A regular shape (something that fit inside a square or a circle) is, in general, a good thing because it guarantees simpler life when it has to be used as an icon or similar...\nStill experimenting with merging metaphors and simplifying shapes: this is IMHO the final iteration on that path, which adds a very useful feature: it now works also with just two colors without visual problems.\n\n . Or with inverted colors and without back circle on dark backgrounds:\n\n. @dheerajvs Actually the first link you posted has a quite nice and smart concept! Unfortunately, it's already taken and used, so better to keep following another path for this project... Nice catch, by the way!. @rstoenescu I like the idea to use a different color for the center (which, by the way, is a black hole, so if we don't want to use plain black, we should at least keep a quite dark color).\nI don't really like the idea of thin lines to enclose the spike because:\n  1. They simply disappear at small sizes (e.g. favicon, logo in a toolbar, normal icon, etc.) making it visual identical to the one with \"open\" spike.\n  2. Keeping the spike open breaks the gear shape in small chunks that could represent the \"Component\" metaphor used by Quasar Framework (small chunks of code that, merged and ordained together, generates a software system). If we close it, we lose this visual metaphor and its meaning.\n 3. Visually, makes the shape less interesting: what do you see? A quasar-shape inside a gear or small elements orbiting around a black hole?\nFor these reasons, I would keep on the last presented shape, maybe experimenting a little bit more on colors as you and others suggested (all chosen colors are already taken from Material palette with the only exception of Vue colors):\n\nPersonally, I suggest to keep on light blue palette in order to keep a visual legacy with old (current) logo and project identity: this is my preferred choice.\nMy second choice would be to use (flat) Vue palette in order to visually express the link between the two projects (but loosing a little bit in terms of \"self-identity\").\nMy third choice would be the one with full spectrum palette (the very last one), in order to express versatility and feature-rich nature of Quasar Framework.\n. @beebase I agree in general, but honestly the gear/quasar combo, at the end, is just a circle with a pattern shape tiled around it. From a geometrical point of view is visually simple and a kind of solution used in many successful and famous logos. Some examples:\n\nUbuntu\nPicasa\nChrome\n\nFurthermore, normally a colored shape is visually more distinctive than a bunch of lines as in the linked suggestion you and Dheerajvs reported, especially at small sizes.\nThese are the requested variations:\n\nI still think the best option should be n.1 with the following color variations for specific use cases:\n\n. @beebase I see your point. I tried to follow your idea but honestly, also due to poor perspective distortion support in Inkscape, I was not able to produce any visually good result with that shape (a ray crossing a circle). About your sketches: the first one is obviously too unbalanced but the second was quite interesting, even if 3D always adds some troubles when we go fully flat and monochrome...\nSo, this is my final version with all use-case variations.\nThanks for all you suggestions and contribution!\nIn order: \n\ncolored with gradient\nbicolor\none color\none color inverted\n\n\n. Some integration examples:\n\n\n\n\n. @rstoenescu Done. Please, check it out!\nThank you all for your help and contribution, I'm glad to have offered something back to the awesome Quasar Framework community!\nThank you @rstoenescu for your amazing work!\nI think we could now finally mark this issue as fixed! :smiley: . Most CSS frameworks use 12, I'd go for that.... Related to #967 for images.. At least some basic animation, e.g. fading out of old element and fading in of new one (+ resize if needed). It would be like a simplified morphing.. Yes, while I agree it's better to avoid to generate a component for that, because it's simply a wrapper around a CSS rule, I think we can use the content of this issue to improve docs and provide a very clear and visual explanation to those are looking on how to implement a toolbar with grouped buttons.. Nice :+1: \nBy the way, it's more an issue for quasarframework/quasar-extras.\nLook at https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-extras/pull/5 and https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-extras/pull/6.. My use case is inside a component called Repeater which basically accepts a delegate component and the props to be passed to each instance of it.\nThe point is that at declaration time (passing delegate component and delegate's props to Repeater), it's hard to access to the final rendered instance inside given handler, e.g.:\n<repeater\n  :delegate=\"delegateComponent\"\n  :props=\"{\n    before: () => { /* HERE */ }\n  }\"\n/>\nProbably I can just use refs as you suggested...I'll try!. Sorry @rstoenescu, it seems the discussion went a little bit off-topic.\nI totally agree with your replies, in fact my initial suggestion was to add Microsft's design to the game in order to let Quasar to be fully \"cross-platform\" and NOT to add templates/examples based on Fluent Design, so why closing this issue?. Thanks!. From a design point-of-view I find the Android-way even more weird because it's not really consistent: why should they put 00, 13 .. 23  on a visually different circle? Only because clocks usually have only 12h? Hours should have equal importance.... The point 2. is exactly what doesn't work for me on Chrome on Android.. No, I'm using it to lazy-loading several components inside a page too.\nBut I faced a big issue, it currently seems to not work on production due to webpack issues...I need to investigate it more.. Yes, I could do it, but I still think we should add built-in support to quasar.conf.js: Quasar is already doing the very same thing for the statics folder (opinionated). Adding this feature would handle statics folder just like any other file/folder the dev want to copy to the final build as is, making it explicit:\n// ...\nbuild: {\n  // ...\n  files: [\n    { from: 'statics', to: 'statics' },\n    // Other files/folders here...\n  ]\n}.

The empty array does not seem to work (we we're already doing that), but v-if=\"entity && entity.length\" on the element does. . This is a feature request, so there is no issue to demonstrate and we cannot fiddle something that does not yet exist.. The options labels are under the complete control of the application/developer and as such XSS should not be a concern (much like Vue's v-html directive). We've invested heavily in Quasar and would hate to have to abandon it or bring in another framework just for this, but we cannot meet our clients requirements without this. I'll have to meet with the team and decide on the best course of action. Just about every other Select component out there supports this including Vuetify.. Thanks! And yes we'll sanitize if we let user append values, but so far we do not.. Will do once we're positive we can continue to use Quasar to meet all out needs... another month or two. And we'll make a good donation.. Well if you look at the fiddle you that guys are so insistent on us providing and that we took the time to make, there is only one style applied. It works with the native input results, but not the QInput results. Also using the work-around for lack of lazy support in components does not work, but that's a Vue issue, not Quasar.

Setting it to false would disable the popover closing from a document click. This will allow multiple popovers (nested or not), only when they all have autoClose = false. The shortcoming of this is that clicking outside of a popover will no longer close it.\n2) In the close() method there is this check:\nif (!this.opened || this.progress || (fn && fn.target && this.$el.contains(fn.target))) {\n        return\n}\nIn other words, if the click comes from a nested element of the q-popover div, then ignore the close attempt. We can change this so that instead of checking whether $el contains the click target, we can iterate through the click target's parents and check if there is a 'q-popover' element in there. \nThe open() method contains document.body.click() to close all other popovers.

    "claustres": "Yes I am interested in working on this and be the maintainer. However I have the ambition to build something more \"evolved\" than a simple express server, particularly to make real-time app development fast. I am looking for something similar to quasar for the backend side, more specifically I would like to try to integrate with http://feathersjs.com/. Both frameworks together will provide a really interesting base for building apps. So I don't know if we should rename the template according to this ?\nThis might also requires small modifications in the quasar framework, such as adding a 'quasar dev' command, create a documentation on this part, create a specific docker environment, ... I have also a question about how to manage the different app configs (dev/prod/test mode). In the default template there is a single config file which includes a dev/prod part. I believe we should have a global config file for each mode + a shared global config. The final config file is a merge of both files depending on the current mode, and the value for the current mode overrides the shared one. Indeed, I can't imagine a use case where you need to access prod settings in dev for instance. For some settings that are today splitted in the dev/prod parts (such as port) it could make sense to have a default shared value for all modes that could be overridden. Let me know what you think about this.\nI will contact you on gitter next week.. Frayer beeing database agnostic you can use different ones, it already supports graphql.. @rstoenescu wouldn't be easier to maintain the different templates if they all are forks from the default one ?. Feathers.js sorry (I just switched off this f...g predictive text in french on my phone ;-). Although Feathers follows this paradigm it is also more than REST, it has a service abstraction on the server-side, which allows to be database agnostic. It also provide real-time event management for the server and client side. Comparing GraphQL and REST does not completely make sense IMHO (https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2017/01/24/graphql-vs-rest-overview/) because GraphQL is basically a query langage; although there is a complete ecosystem around.\nI believe that using Feathers.js won't prevent you using GraphQL (with your own client interface or the Feathers' one and https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-waterline), while focusing on a GraphQL technology is a strong opiniated choice that does not fit well with micro-services which usually mix different approaches/technologies up.. @rstoenescu I propose to initiate a basic quasar-template-express then derive from it quasar-template-feathers. Dear Scott I am pretty convinced GraphQL is interesting but by essence it is an interface definition langage to access data, maybe http://netflix.github.io/falcor/ is something more similar to it than Feathers. \nYou are talking about a complete technology stack around GraphQL (Apollo) and Feathers seems to me less opiniated with respect to interoperability (not architecture) because it basically supports different real-time technologies and different databases + authentication, but I might be wrong. Of course GraphQL can be used to create microservices but what I meant is that Feathers will be more usefull to do so because of its larger coverage as previously said.\nBecause this is a different approach from Feathers/REST what we need is probably two different templates. However I have not enough time/knowledge to implement one with GraphQL \ud83d\ude22  I don't know if it is possible either to have the benefit of both approaches in the same template, your help and advise is welcome, I will try to have a look to it next week.\n. @rstoenescu Initialized the first template from a fork by creating a branch if you want to have a look : https://github.com/claustres/quasar-template-default/tree/express\n. I agree in the general sense, I am trying to use and write the minimal amount of code required to do stuffs. At a first glance Feathers looked to me as a big framework but reading the doc further I saw that almost everything is pluggable (https://docs.feathersjs.com/providers/, https://docs.feathersjs.com/databases/readme.html, https://docs.feathersjs.com/authentication/readme.html) and the core footprint is small (https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/readme.html). So I wanted to give it a try but I will catch up your opinion in a couple of weeks \ud83d\ude04 \nAnyway, don't make me too smart \ud83d\ude36 , I started JS 5 years ago with jQuery, then gained a solid background in NodeJS ecosystem, Angular 1.x ecosystem, MongoDB but I am not a reference in JS programming. However it will be interesting to collaborate because I would like to know more about GraphQL capabilities and tools. As I proposed I forked the basic Quasar template to initiate my own ones with different branches (https://github.com/claustres/quasar-template-default) I added you to the collaborator list if you want to start working on this.\n. Done but this might be a temporary move, i am waiting for @rstoenescu to know how he wants to manage the work on the different templates. Well in this case we should go for a more evolved templating system, probably similar to https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-cli. But I personnaly never used Yoman before..

This app stores their details until the event is over and the device is back in a location with wifi (there is no guarantee of wifi at the event and the app has to work regardless). Thanks, I've seen that and am using it for now. However, my feature request is for Quasar to has easy to use utility methods like for LocalStorage and SessionStorage http://quasar-framework.org/api/js-web-storage.html to make using IndexedDB easier.. Fair enough, I appreciate that this is a somewhat specialised request.. @rhyek My thought is not, as IndexedDB is now a mainstream API with strong cross-browser support. Pretty much all libraries that add easy-to-use methods for LocalStorage and SessionStorage add the same for IndexedDB, so it feels like there is something missing by not having it.. From my point of view, having the wrapper would help with three things:\n\nStandardise data storage using Quasar (i.e. the Quasar wrapper would feel familiar to the LocalStorage / SessionStorage wrappers)\nAvoid any vendor-specific bugs with IndexedDB support\nProvide a reliable and consistent error when IndexedDB is not supported\n\nAs you say, IndexedDB is not overly difficult to work with and I don't imagine that this is a big priority, but it would be nice to have eventually to complete the trio of local storage apis and provide consistent, simple access to all of them.. Yeah, there are a few libraries that do wrap it. MDN, for example, has this message:\n\nNote: IndexedDB API is powerful, but may seem too complicated for simple cases. If you'd prefer a simple API, try libraries such as localForage, dexie.js, and ZangoDB, that make IndexedDB more user-friendly.\n\nI wouldn't worry about WebSQL support as that is deprecated and browsers are going to start removing it - new sites should definitely avoid using it.\nOne of the really great things about Quasar is that you need very few other libraries. This is because there are so many JS and CSS utilities built in, which are fantastic. It just seems odd that this one is missing.. @rhyek: True, you make a good point.. @rstoenescu I fully agree with the jQuery reference. It makes me really mad when I see the top SO answer being jQuery when there are other answers that do the exact same thing without it. Plus, Quasar has tree-shaking (or will have in 2 days), so the bundle size will only reflect the part of Quasar that is being used.. ",

I know that quasar is a great framework, but for people that are no too familiar with what is under the hood of webpack configurations (my case), having two  \"official\" version of webpack supported and maintained by the vue community (my guess is that is bigger than quasar for now) it would be preferible to have a simple way to add quasar-framework components without changing all the tooling for an existing vueproject. \n. Thanks, but I cannot post without registering. I don't want to register to ask a question.. That's the answer I was looking for. Thanks. And sorry to know that I need to change framework.. ",

IMHO should stay as is, else linking it up with things like validation will become a pain. What do you mean \"does not work\" ?

I'm not sure what you mean by \"it stays the same\"\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/fh7rjkrd/. I have this same behavior using the quasar-cli\nYou must have some interfering css?

Just to be clear though - you said the disable attribute creates the visual effect, but when I do this:\n<q-collapsible :disabled=\"numComments === 0\">\n\nI get the effect (which is dynamic as numComments changes) as if q-collapsible had a disabled property. I wasn't applying the disable (no 'd') attribute directly. Does something translate one to the other?. Right - so, to clarify:\n\ndisabled attribute - apply the fading and cursor via CSS\ndisabled class - same as above\ndisable prop - boolean to be interpreted by the component\n\nand with that last one, presumably the component would normally apply the disabled attribute / class to any of its UI elements when disable === true?\nI'm keen to try adding this to q-collapsible - at least for my projects. Is there a guide anywhere about getting started on Quasar development? I'm presuming I'll need a fork of the project and a local clone to work on. But how to build and test that version locally? Is it just npm build and copy dist into my application's node_modules\\quasar-framework? Or is there a more elegant way?. Yes, I will. It was the setup for dev and testing I wasn't sure about - I didn't spot that link before. Tx.. OK - I think I did what's needed. Let me know if the PR looks OK. I updated the dev demo page to show it in action, based on the state of the previous collapsible.. The Quasar docs currently say \"invisible: Set visibility to none\", which as you pointed out isn't a valid value. That was the intent of my original post. But then I got to wondering about whether hidden meaning one thing in CSS (not shown but taking space) and another in Quasar (not shown and not taking space) was really the best approach...\nI'll make a PR to clarify in the docs if you're not keen to change the classes.. Did it come through? I wasn't sure if I'd made it all the way to the end :).. I like it when things bring joy. Needed an extra colon, but many thanks:\n:header-class=\"{'no-shadow':true}\". @rstoenescu I'm not sure how _adding_ a `position` prop (which would support all variations - corner, side, optional offset, etc.) would be a breaking change. Just continue to support `corner` as well, and mark it deprecated - perhaps with a console warning? Then remove it in `X` years :).. I'm still confused about what would break - see me previous post?. If `corner` issues console warnings and then is removed in 0.16, it shouldn't bloat more than happens to me during the summer holiday, and I'm back down to my fighting weight now :). Whilst `corner` and `position` coexist, yes. But when `corner` goes, where is the bloat? Other than `position` will necessarily be bigger because, well, it does more.... OK, I've added the 'Do' token, and also allowed the user to pass in a custom function to return a date suffix, so it could be used like this:\n\nmethods: {\n  fmt (date, format) {\n    return formatDate(new Date(date), format, {dateSuffix: this.customSuffix})\n  },\n  customSuffix (d) {\n    return d + '\u00b0'\n  }\n}\n\nThe function expects a date (1-31) and should return the number and suffix. The default is to provide the regular 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.\nDid you want me to add the 'Mo', 'Qo' tokens as well? To be honest, I'm not sure where they'd be used but I guess for completeness they should be there?. I think @rstoenescu decided to do this in a different way but I honestly can't remember now. But I think you can do everything you described by passing in a custom function to the code I original posted.. I'm sure there was an issue about this, but I'd also like double-click for this.. Actually, it was #798 I was thinking of. Looks like they could all be merged somehow into QDatetime improvements?. That would be great. I'm not sure I understand enough about flex to be able to create that, but I'd be happy to use it :).. Actually, it's not on github I'm afraid. I will try to make a minimal test case. Well, that was annoying. I couldn't make a repro case, so I just updated my main project, and the following things were upgraded:\n\nexpress@4.16.1\nvuex@2.4.1\nfirebaseui@2.4.0\nquasar-framework@0.14.5\nfirebase@4.5.0\n\nAnd now the error is no more. Woohoo!.. Thanks for the info, and great that it's fixed. I'll be moving to 0.15 asap.\nIt looks like #882 this might be related too, but I'm not sure.\nAnd no, it's an input that it being used to capture 3 different kinds of free format text (not chips) depending on which button the user clicks. The full code is like this, and it works really nicely, apart from the blur issue:\n<q-card-actions v-if=\"can\">\n  <span v-if=\"!adding\">\n    <q-btn v-for=\"section in sections\" :key=\"section.key\"\n      outline\n      rounded\n      no-caps\n      color=\"primary\"\n      @click=\"add(section.key)\"\n    >{{section.buttonLabel}}</q-btn>\n  </span>\n  <q-input v-if=\"adding\"\n    clearable\n    ref=\"inputBox\"\n    class=\"full-width\"\n    v-model.lazy.trim=\"newData\"\n    :placeholder=\"'Add ' + adding\"\n    @keydown.enter=\"handleAdd\"\n    @blur=\"$nextTick(() => { newData = adding = null })\"\n    :after=\"[\n      {\n        icon: 'check',\n        content: true,\n        handler: handleAdd\n      }\n    ]\"\n  />\n</q-card-actions>\n\nmethods: {\n  add (type) {\n    this.adding = type\n    this.$nextTick(() => {\n      this.$refs.inputBox.focus()\n    })\n  }\n}\n\n. And then that led me to another pitfall of this, which I'm still interested in finding out about. The challenge now (for a web app using this interface) is that swiping the drawer is very close to swiping back / forward on ios. Apparently it's not possible for a web page to 'ask' ios not to do this. See also this issue.\nThat got me wondering though, for an 'app' in mobile Safari, the back / forward history thing is not so useful anyway. I'd be happy for users to always have to click / tap on something to navigate, rather than relying on browser history. I don't really want the '#' in the URLs, but by zeroing out the browser tab history, that should prevent ios from attempting to navigate back forward and allow the drawer open swipe, swipe contents, and close swipe to all work together. But would clearing history break anything else?. In fact, in hash mode, with those lines commented out, it works really nicely on a brand new tab (with no existing history). The drawer can be opened by swipe, the contents (a q-carousel) can be swiped, and the drawer can be closed by swiping from the right hand edge of the phone screen.\nUnfortunately, it seems it's not possible to clear a tab's history on load, but only ever using $router.replace() should work. So, I just need a prop to make swiping to close conditional now.\nWhat I might do is check window.history.length on load, and if it's non-zero, open a new tab and close the current one. Bit of a hack, but should allow a 'clean' history state for the app.. Tx - perfect :).. Now, I say 'perfect', and indeed it does exactly what I want. But I think the logic may confuse some people. My use case is maybe niche, but I don't think unique in wanting a carousel in a drawer. Native apps seem to be using that model for hierarchical data.\nMy point is this; with the current logic, noSwipeOpen will also imply noSwipeClose on the background\u2014i.e. to the right/left of the drawer. noSwipeClose will disable closing by swiping the drawer itself, but will still allow swipe to close on the background.\nI guess it might be enough to explain this in the docs\u2014happy to work on that page when it's live. Actually, I think my first point isn't right. I'd misread where the curly brackets were, and noSwipeOpen will still allow the 'close' background overlay (which is good for me).\nThe second point is that noSwipeClose really only means noSwipeDrawerClose\u2014you could still swipe the background to close. That is in fact exactly what I want, so I wouldn't want to see that 'fixed' :).\n. I will try. But note this was running on node on my local dev pc which I\nwas browsing from my phone.

And since the need for it should go away soon, we might even get away with just ignoring it...\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Modal\n<q-modal ref=\"modal\" v-model=\"modal\">\n  <q-input v-model=\"text01\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text02\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text03\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text04\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text05\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text06\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text07\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text08\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text09\"></q-input>\n  <q-input v-model=\"text10\"></q-input>\n  <q-btn @click=\"$refs.modal.hide()\">CLose Modal</q-btn>\n</q-modal>\n\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'PageIndex',\n  data () {\n    return {\n      modal: false,\n      text01: '',\n      text02: '',\n      text03: '',\n      text04: '',\n      text05: '',\n      text06: '',\n      text07: '',\n      text08: '',\n      text09: '',\n      text10: '',\n    }\n  },\n  watch: {\n    modal () {\n      if(this.modal) {\n        document.body.classList.add('fixed')\n      } else {\n        document.body.classList.remove('fixed')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```. Yes, that\u2019s in those links. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a side-effect-free fix.\nApart from hope that iOS 11.3 really does have a fix. Apparently the beta\ndoes.\nOn Fri, 9 Feb 2018 at 22:36, Razvan Stoenescu notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nNope. The fix has issues. Got to think some other way.

I'm also having to do some custom CSS in my app, as I don't want the qucknav to be on top of the content. So I was wondering about a prop quick-nav-overlay (true/false, default true) which would add some margin to the content area.. Yes, I was about to comment that I'd ended up using\n```\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.tree-full-width >>> span\n  width 100%\n``\nI still think it might be better for the component to enable this though, because:\n- Addingclass=\"full-width\"to the tree and/or leaves _ought_ to not require extra custom CSS\n- Your CSS ties the app into the specific structure of q-tree (.q-tree-node-header > span) which might change and then break\n- My CSS is probably too broad, and could mess up other` elements which were not part of the tree's structure.. Yes, that's what I've done for now (option 2), but I'm hoping it's a temporary workaround :). Is this the right place to discuss ideas for this? I see you closed it...\nAnyway, my thought is that selectable and tickable are (almost) mutually exclusive, in that one uses a checkbox and the other could use a radio box (i.e. when only a single leaf can be 'selected'). Then the whole leaf can always be clickable, and it sets either the checkbox or the radio button depending on the mode.\nI'm not sure what the use case for selectable is though\u2014perhaps radio button wouldn't be right?. Well, I want to change the styling of another component when the drawer is open\u2014e.g. making a flex grid in the main page go from col-4 to col-6 when the drawer is open in 'desktop' mode, but not change when opened in 'mobile' mode. The reason being that the usable width of the flex area changes when the drawer opens in desktop mode, but not in mobile mode.\nIn the end I had to inject the q-layout, and compute the column classes based on using the same width logic that q-layout-drawer uses to determine which mode to use. But of course that could easily get out of sync with q-layout-drawer if that logic changes.. I was originally discussing on the discord channel that I think if an expanded collapsible state changes to disabled, it should hide(), but I couldn't easily implement that since once the disabled state is changed, you can't change it's view. Personally I think if a collapsible is set disabled, it should be hidden / collapsed, and that would solve this problem too. But I realise that might not be how others are using it.... Yes, I\u2019m sure that would be workable.\nI was also proposing to use \u2018positive\u2019 props (I.e. avoiding using the \u2018no-\u2018\nprefix which inverts the meaning of the boolean value passed in). I realise\nthat\u2019s a much bigger issue than this one thing but might be worth\nconsidering across Quasar as a whole?\nWe will then have solved one of the two hard problems :)\nhttps://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\nOn Sat, 2 Mar 2019 at 12:31, Scott notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI think we just need to add the prop no-backdrop-dismiss again.

It behaves the same:\n\nand\n\n\nTo clarify, say I have a QDrawer with links that route to one of /foo/dashboard, /bar/members, or /baz/dashboard, then whichever tab was active 'previously' stays active, regardless of the route. So going from /foo/dashboard to /baz/dashboard, the tab is 'correct', because it should be Dashboard for both. But going from /foo/dashboard or /baz/dashboard to /bar/members, the Dashboard q-route-tab stays active (when the router-link changes).\nThe order of the tabs doesn't not seem to make any difference to this behaviour.\nAlso, sometimes, the correct tab is displayed, and that's what I found in a codepen. Lots of data is loaded (some asynchronously from firebase) by the main page component, and the Dashboard / Members components. So I do think timing is a key issue here. Here's the full head of the template, so you can also see there are some conditionals in there which add to the complexity:\n```\n\nLoading...\nNo such event.\n\n\nWhen pages are added to this event, they can be accessed from the menu button at the top left.\n\n\n Setting Tabs \n\n\n\n    <router-link tag=\"q-btn\" to=\"members\" active-class=\"text-red\">Members</router-link>\n    <router-link tag=\"q-btn\" to=\"dashboard\" active-class=\"text-red\">Dashboard</router-link>\n\n``. Yes, I'm afraid so. I added ` above the tabs to double-check:\n\nI also added a console.log(this.$route) right before the setTimeout() call in the watch function of QRouteTab.js, and this is the output:\n\nSo it's being called 3 times, but even on the first time the navigation is confirmed and the route is updated.\nLet me know if there's anything else I can try. The app is semi-public so I can probably give you access to the front end if that's useful.. Sorry, no joy. Now with <pre>{{version}}: {{$route.fullPath}}</pre> to check I'm using the update:\n\n. Sorry, not sure which 'to' you're asking for. Do you mean in the template, or as passed into the route guards, or something else? The $route.fullPath for all 3 tabs is:\n/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/dashboard\n/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/members\n/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/pages. Regarding the :to, if that's not what's in the template source at the top of this issue (I added a third, but the problem is unchanged), I'm still unsure what you're after. This is how the template looks now:\n```\n\n\n\n\nDashboard\nMembers\nPages\n```\nThe links for each QRouteTab look correct:\nDashboard: http://localhost:8080/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/dashboard\nMembers: http://localhost:8080/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/members\nPages: http://localhost:8080/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/pages\nAnd via devtools, if I inspect each element I see this.\nDashboard:\n<a data-v-7dcafda6=\"\" href=\"/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/dashboard\" class=\"q-tab relative-position self-stretch flex justify-center text-center q-router-link--exact-active q-router-link--active q-tab--inactive q-focusable q-hoverable cursor-pointer\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"tab\"><div class=\"q-focus-helper\"></div><div class=\"q-tab__content flex-center relative-position no-pointer-events non-selectable column\"><div class=\"q-tab__label\">Dashboard</div></div><div class=\"q-tab__indicator absolute-bottom\"></div></a>\nMembers:\n<a data-v-7dcafda6=\"\" href=\"/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/members\" class=\"q-tab relative-position self-stretch flex justify-center text-center q-tab--inactive q-focusable q-hoverable cursor-pointer\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"tab\"><div class=\"q-focus-helper\"></div><div class=\"q-tab__content flex-center relative-position no-pointer-events non-selectable column\"><div class=\"q-tab__label\">Members</div></div><div class=\"q-tab__indicator absolute-bottom\"></div></a>\nPages:\n<a data-v-7dcafda6=\"\" href=\"/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/pages\" class=\"q-tab relative-position self-stretch flex justify-center text-center q-tab--active text-primary q-focusable q-hoverable cursor-pointer\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"tab\" aria-selected=\"true\"><div class=\"q-focus-helper\"></div><div class=\"q-tab__content flex-center relative-position no-pointer-events non-selectable column\"><div class=\"q-tab__label\">Pages</div></div><div class=\"q-tab__indicator absolute-bottom\"></div></a>. Btw, switching between tabs on a single event is fine. That's not the issue. It's switching between events which is the problem. I'm just gathering the relevant info for that. I can send you a pen which shows how it's set up, but doesn't have the same symptoms, which is what led me to think it's a timing issue. Please wait a few minutes for me to find it.\n. I was in the middle of a big explanation, but yes :). The Event component has a guard and redirects to a sub-component based on where the user was last. See this pen which has the same setup (fast redirect) but not the problem: https://codepen.io/dsl101/pen/aMJQdj\nI've hard-coded it so that Event 1 redirects to Component 1, and Event 2 redirects to Component 2.\nI understand in my case that fetching the target tab from firebase will be slow, and hence I think the 2 get out of step.. Wait, is it fixed? Is there a pkg I can try?. Sad face. Navigating from:\nhttp://localhost:8080/-LJZVx_wTH2UyNGwvXLv/pages to\nhttp://localhost:8080/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy\ncauses the route guard to look up the last active tab for the new event (-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy), and then run next('-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/dashboard') and so the final URL is\nhttp://localhost:8080/-LD7DBdsqpxlCoqmcTsy/dashboard\nand results in:\n\nThe reason the Pages QRouteTab is active is because it was active on the first URL. If that URL had ended /members, it would be the Members tab that was active. Again, I can still fix this by delaying the call to __checkActivation() in QRouteTab.js:\nwatch: {\n    $route () {\n      setTimeout(this.__checkActivation, 100)\n    }\n  },\nI notice there is a small delay in the RouterLink active class being applied (i.e. the text for those additional buttons is all black when the page first loads, and then one of them changes to red). That's what gave me the idea it was a timing issue. Clearly 100ms is just randomly OK for my current app / network conditions and so not a fix. But still unsure what the cause is. Anything else I can do to help debug, please do let me know.. Results:\nwatch: {\n    $route () {\n      this.$nextTick(this.__checkActivation)\n    }\n  }\n= no change.\n$route () {\n      this.__checkActivation()\n    },\n    to () {\n      this.__checkActivation()\n    },\n    append () {\n      this.__checkActivation()\n    }\n= no change\nUsing object :to in conjunction with above:\n<q-route-tab label=\"Dashboard\" :to=\"{name: 'dashboard'}\" />\n        <q-route-tab label=\"Members\" :to=\"{name: 'members'}\" />\n        <q-route-tab label=\"Pages\" :to=\"{name: 'pages'}\" />\n= no change\nThe router guard in Event.vue is this\nconst loadTab = (to, from, next) => {\n    console.log('to.name:', to.name)\n    if (to.name === 'Event') {  // We landed on the project 'home', so move to whichever tab is default\n      const lastTab = store.getters.lastTab(to.params.event) || 'dashboard'\n      console.log('to.fullPath:', to.fullPath)\n      console.log('lastLoc:', lastTab)\n      console.log(`calling next(/${to.params.event}/${lastTab})`)\n      next(`/${to.params.event}/${lastTab}`)\n    } else {\n      console.log('calling next()')\n      next()\n    }\n  }\nloadTab() is called by both beforeRouteEnter() and beforeRouteUpdate() in Event.vue.

I'm not a maintainer though, so don't take my word on this.\nBut I'm pretty sure Razvan won't implement such thing, which implies importing another dependency to the project, when this is something that should be addressed by the developer itself, since the case is very specific (most people implement this by themselves, or use a proper pagination approach), as I already said before.\nI encouraged you to provide pull requests because I noticed you're requesting things once in a while, which isn't bad at all, but feels even better when you see people getting involved.. I realized that not every time you need autoselect, you also need autofocus. So that else if block won't work well.\nConsider the case when you are on a mobile and you don't want the keyboard to popup because you don't need the user to input anything, but press a \"Copy this\" button next to the input with its text selected. Or in desktop you simply let the user press ctrl + c.\nThey are 2 different functionalities, that's why we can't use \u00b4else if\u00b4 here.\nRegarding to this.autofocus === 'select', I agree.

Also if you comment out the exclude: '/node_modules/' for the babel-loader in the webpack config it will work.. I'm just a little bit disappointed because I used to tell everyone about Quasar and now I don't want to tell anyone about it. I was productive in v0.14 and now I feel like I'm fighting against the grain. Vue is better than React because Vue is not opinionated. I feel like this framework is quickly becoming a React framework. I tried to change one of my routes to render a component without a layout component and I got an error stating that I had to use a layout component with a child component. That just doesn't make sense to me at all. You are going against all the makes Vue Vue.. I'm not trying to be rude. I understand that this takes an immense amount of energy and I very much appreciate that you have built this framework. I have used it on a number of very successful projects.\nI agree that Quasar has a lot of neat features. But I don't trust frameworks like Cordova that claim to be multiplatform anyways. I prefer to just write in Java or Swift4. I use Quasar because it has an amazing webpack configuration, and it works out of the box with a lot of styles and features, but I have come across a few issues. Maybe this has changed in v.15, but I think that the multiselect in v.14 could be optimized. So much so that it was making my page lag for like 10 seconds from rendering 15 records in a table that had a few input elements inside of them. I switched it to v-multiselect and the lag disappeared completely. It's definitely great to have such granular control over features of a framework, but I think there are ways to make it snappier. Also don't know if leaving the \"IE\" lines uncommented didn't work for me in IE11 because I quickly switched to using babel-polyfill and importing es6-promise afterwards.  I didn't bother to raise an issue.\nIn the post you mentioned, I wanted to use the VueRouter in the normal way. I didn't want to use a component that lives in the src/layouts directory of your new CLI's structure so I instead tried to write the code the way it's normally written. Instead of having the parent-component-containing-the-child-components structure I just required the component that I wanted directly from the components folder. This is how I got the error.\nAgain, not trying to be rude or anything. I'm definitely invested in this framework. I even used the webpack config with a small project I did to test iview with. I just think that changing the way Vue and VueRouter does things is not the right way. That doesn't mean that I don't think it's an awesome feature. I think it's super cool to be able to use layout components with several children because then its possible to set different themes or have a mobile and desktop layout that render for different platforms. \nBy the way, I really really do appreciate what you guys do. Honestly, I've written a small UI framework and it was a shit ton of work and I think I only finished like 6 or 7 components. I haven't touched it for a while and I probably won't for another little while, but it was fun to get started. Kudos to you guys man. . I think it would be best to separate the multiselect into another component that isn't the same as the select because there is a lot going on. I think that too many css features are being stored as variables on the components. I understand that it makes them look really cool, but it's probably using a lot of memory. I think that it's better to give some cool features and then leave the rest to the artist. Let CSS do as much of the heavy lifting as possible. I think most prominent features would probably be the coolest to keep. I honestly kinda want to help with this framework, but I don't want to be that guy who just comes in and tries to rip apart code thats been built over a long period of time. Love the framework though. It's definitely on the top of my list of favorite frameworks because it's extremely useable and it does look nice for the most part.. ",

This seems excessive to me, and presents some additional issues for nested modals.\nWhatever method is used, the following features appear to be indicated:\n\nWorks with both tab and shift tab (forward or reverse direction\nContinues to work as expected when elements are dynamically inserted into any position, including first and last.\nWorks as expected in nested modals\n. @rstoenescu is this on the roadmap for v.15?.

I confirm.\nAlso, it's not necessary to put type=number. If v-model detects is a number, it's not floating.\n. Ok. Thanks for the information. I didn't understand the example.. For my part, I prefer to have YYYY-MM-DD. It's better for work with dates not only in different languages using JS utils nor working in other systems like MySQL and other ISO standards.\n. is it not possible to custom format QDate component?. is it not possible to custom format QDate component?. @labs20 I have the same case with dynamic form.... @labs20 I have the same case with dynamic form....

    "mattwright": "I use it sometimes like 7:30a, but it may not be common usage. I don't need it in quasar at the moment, the code you implemented fits my needs. Thanks!. thank you!!. Nope -- 'Focus modal' still not popping up the keyboard on iOS 11.4 Mobile Safari, although the 'focus normal' button does... An additional tap on the modal's search field does popup the keyboard. In both instances, the fields do appear to be focused in terms of the underline css on the input field... \nI acknowledge this may be more of an iOS-specific issue than a Quasar issue, in which case you can feel free to close it. I was just hoping it had an easy fix.. Yeah, still not popping it up. That was one of the curious things -- I had tested this with even a three second timeout value to call back so that the modal would definitely be popped up and visible. What happens is the modal pops up, then you can later see the field focus once the timeout fires (css effects applied so that the colored underline animation for a focused field happens), but the keyboard is never triggered in iOS. Without the qmodal, the keyboard does trigger immediately.\nI'm starting to think it may just be an iOS thing... When I delay the focus by 100 milliseconds, even on the non-modal qsearch, iOS also fails to popup the keyboard. So iOS may require that the focus happens synchronously in relation to the touch before it pops up the keyboard (and so any callbacks after the modal pops up therefore causes the keyboard not to pop)...\nHere is an example showing that: https://jsfiddle.net/oj4msev1/17/\nI'm going to close this, since it appears that it's not related to the QModal. Thanks for looking into it, sorry I didn't test the delayed callback to the non-modal version, I hadn't thought of that.. ",
    "jmellicker": "That's probably best, thanks for the advice!. Maybe this could be an option, to not show those buttons and to close on date selected?\nOr, is there a way to listen to the event when a user clicks a date? Then, you would know the date, and you could close the date picker manually.. User expectation with a date picker is:\n\n\nthe user clicks something because they want to choose a date\n\n\na datepicker appears, they can either choose a date in the current month, or navigate to a different month and choose a date\n\n\nimmediately upon choosing a date, the datepicker closes (it's annoying, once a date is chosen, to then have an extra unnecessary click on a \"set\" button)\n\n\nSo what's needed is a config option to not show the superfluous \"clear\", \"cancel\" and \"set\" buttons, and have a click on a date emit the date chosen and close the control.\n. @rstoenescu so excited to dive into 1.0!!!\n\ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \nEverything looks awesome\u2014new website header, and the new docs are OMG OMG OMG amazing!!!!\nOnce things settle down for you, hope we can have a chat!!!.

Hi, thanks for your answer.\nActually the perfect scenario would be to pass the entire option object that has been selected inside the \"selected\" model. The entire original object would be passed so the @change event would get it entirely, not only its value. That's the \"dream\" scenario :-)\nBut my need isn't really to deal with the selected options model, but instead to be able to disable some options. When passing my available options to your component, I would need to display all options in the dropdown, but those who have their \"enabled\" property set to false would be unselectable and grayed out, like in a native dropdown.\nThat would be just great.\nThanks again..

/home/jpgilchrist/Development/code/poc/camera-preview/src-cordova\nTip: \"src-cordova\" is a Cordova project folder, so everything you know\n      about Cordova applies to it. Quasar CLI only generates the content\n      for \"src-cordova/www\" folder and then Cordova takes over and builds\n      the mobile app.\nTip: Feel free to use Cordova CLI or change any files in \"src-cordova\",\n      except for \"www\" folder which must be built by Quasar CLI.\n```\nI guess the only thing we should do then is update the docs so that this command is reflected somewhere in the build commands section. \nFurthermore, it might be nice to have an additional command to install it on your device in one step (if it's not already available in an undocumented way). \nFor instance: quasar build -m cordova -T android --debug --install\nBecause if you want to install the artifact produced by quasar build -m cordova -T android --debug you still have to subsequently adb install ./src-cordova/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk, which is just a little annoying.\nAlternative Process:\n quasar build -m cordova -T android --debug --skip-pkg\n cd src-cordova\n* cordova run android\nAs you can see they are all still a bit cumbersome. .

    "mings1": "@rstoenescu Can I know where to download the v1.0 and how to use it?. ",
    "stefanvanherwijnen": "@mings1 \nv1.0 is not released yet. I have no idea what the ETA of v1.0 is, but maybe the feature is integrated in a development branch somewhere. But considering the question, you will have to wait until v1.0 gets released.. I believe it should be:\nfield: row => row.boss.name,\nThis will return 'bossman' instead of 'fred'.\nE.g.:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n{{ col.value.name }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  // name: 'ComponentName',\n  data () {\n    return {\n      tableData: [\n        {\n          id: 1,\n          nested: {\n            id: 2,\n            name: 'Name inside nested object'\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      columns: [\n        { name: 'nested', label: 'Nested objects', field: row => row.nested }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n``. Any clue how I can set the nested property dynamically?\nIf I set:field: row => row[variable]The field variable is set to:function field(row) { return row[variable]Where as it should be the value (string) of the variable (so if variable is 'boss', it should be return row['boss']).. Thanks.\nYou are right, it seems to be impossible without using eval() or new Function().\nWhat works is this:var func = new Function('return function field(row){ return row[\\'' + variable + '\\']}')field: func()`\nHowever, ESLint tells you not to use new Function so you have to set 'no-new-func': 0.\n... I have just tried setting field: variable again and it now seems to work fine :sob: .\nI think the key is to set the Object as the field variable and use custom QTr and QTd to extract the values out of the nested object.. I have a component which requires data from a Vuex store. If this data is not available, the data is retrieved through an axios request. However, if multiple components are initialized without the data being set, multiple requests are made. I solved this by using debounce, but it is not possible to wait on the request (i.e. use then()).\nThe function provided by @jsfeldman seems to fix this by returning the Promise inside the debounce function. Is there a reason not to do it like this? (Or, what is the reason for not implementing this debounce function?)\n@rstoenescu . Thanks Razvan, that makes sense. I already copied the function and that works fine for my specific case. Now I think of it, it is probably better indeed not to implement workarounds for specific use cases in the source code, even though it would make no difference for functionality.\nSo for people that need this functionality: just copy the function provided by jsfeldman :) . Maybe a parse() function should be added to the Date Utils. As I see it, the problems start when a JS Date comes into the game. So even if the whole app uses date strings, the moment you want to manipulate a date (and thus having to create a JS Date), the problems start with timezones etc.\nIn that case the format of the strings can be converted to anything, and if someone wants to use the actual date for processing they would parse it with the date util.. Sorry, you are right. I thought the options function was just a filter on an array, my bad.. ",

Perhaps take it to the documentation.\n<q-knob color=\"primary\" v-model=\"realDistance\" :min=\"1\" :max=\"50\">{{computedDistance}}</q-knob>\ncomputed: { \n    computedDistance: function () {\n      if (this.realDistance === 25) {\n        return 'Half'\n      }\n      else if (this.realDistance === 50) {\n        return 'Full'\n      }\n      else {\n        return this.realDistance\n      }\n    }\n  }\nWhen the QKnob is set to 25 then 'Half' is displayed. When the QKnob is set to 50 then 'Full' is displayed. . ",
    "leopiccionia": "Is there any chance it will have an optional for aligning items always on right, like it used to be on mobile screens, no matter the screen size? I think it would be a nice improvement over former component.\nThanks, @rstoenescu, for Quasar the great framework it is.. The required amount of Vue knowledge required for this task is actually minimal.\nAnyway, I'm a Vetur user and willing to contribute on this issue.. Are you with Disable cache option set on Chrome DevTools? By default, fonts would be cached and this \"glitch\" wouldn't happen even in very slow networks.. You can preview it here: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-helper-json/blob/master/quasar-tags.json. Actually, they are different (notice the navbar text placement and shadows, for instance).\nQuasar has some platform-specific styling (e.g. buttons, tabs, dialogs, datepickers, spinners, chat bubbles, etc.), but some components are more platform-agnostic. Quasar is not currently as pixel-perfect as alternatives like Framework7, maybe because it aims to be more than a mobile-only framework.. I'd suggest to change the line 29 to this.set(lang || this.detectLocale()), but this would probably be a breaking change, so this is left out of this pull request. If you're OK with it, I can amend this PR or submit another PR.. Yes, you are right, and now I realize that it would probably be counter-productive to SSR goals.\nOne alternative would be making the function optionally return an array, so that the developer can use an user-provided set of locales for the choice. Is the use-case worthy?. Actually, a component registered in PascalCase can be used in kebab-case, but the opposite is not true (see vuejs/vue#5581). I think supporting both (i.e. registering components names in PascalCase) would be a great convenience.\nIf you allow me, I can prepare a PR.. Actually, I first noticed the issue on the a project managed by vue-cli, not on standalone.\n\nAs I said previously, if a component is registered (either globally via Vue.component or locally via components) in PascalCase, it can be used inside a template in all PascalCase, camelCase and kebab-case; but, if you register it on kebab-case, it can only be used in kebab-case (see repro).\nAs I see here, the components are registered globally by the components name attribute, and this is kebab-case. So I basically see two ways of solving this:\n1. Convert components names to PascalCase before registering.\n2. Change all components name to PascalCase. This requires the change of most files, but would be more performatic.\nWe could benchmark to see which one is more performatic:\n1. Check c.name.startsWith('q-') and then convert to PascalCase.\n2. Check c.name.match(/^Q[A-Z]/).. Yes, sure. But I'm busy, I'll try to prepare the PR on weekend.. As I previously said in Discord, material.io/icons  and materialdesignicons.com are not related. Quasar icons names are perfectly aligned with the previous.\nActually, if one read this, it's learned that materialdesignicons.com actually predates Google initiative, and aliasing material.io names are not top priority. And, per this, that some material.io icons probably won't be supported, so it's intended as a strict superset.\nI'd suggest to eventually support materialdesignicons.com, with its own namespace. I don't have a suggestion for the name.. ",

I would suggest using accept=\"image/*\" because \"thing.jpg\", \"thing.JPG\" and thing.jpeg\" are all valid media-type suffixes for the same thing - and depending on source it could be any one of them.. wow... the version is quite old - @morrislaptop - will you be updating it to 0.15?. Oh, that is a shame. If you are not interested, then perhaps just close the pull-request. (And maybe consider removing the app from the app-store if you don't wish to continue working with quasar...) . Thankyou. @codingfriend1 - this pull request is very old and full of conflicts. Do you intend to merge upstream and continue working on it, or do you prefer to close it?. Are you still actively working on the @pdanpdan ? If not it might be good to close the PR. @mesqueeb - is this still happening to you? if it is, please file an issue, close this PR and either make a new PR or remind us to have a look at it. I know that there was recently some work done on the stylus end - so maybe @rstoenescu has some insight.. Well, if you are going to go through the pain of upgrading from 14, then I really recommend you just skip 15,16 and 17 and upgrade directly to 1.0beta. I am working on the integration of the testing mode in userland via quasar-cli and I am really happy that we are finally getting some testing on these basic components. Great job!. @rstoenescu - we should remove all v-html from quasar because it uses an eval in vue that allows for XSS. But the editor itself does continue to work. For the record, this appears to only be an issue on Android Firefox . Are you really using Quasar: v.014.10\n. Thanks for reporting this!. I think that the problem is actually a collaboration between ESLint and Babel - this was discussed in great detail today on the Discord server. Note - I have not tried to reproduce the issue, but did find some relevant discussion over at the eslint repo.\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9848 . That might be one huge reason to switch the recommended package-builder to yarn from npm.... This is a really important PR. Nice job @pdanpdan !!! @rstoenescu - any reason not to integrate it? . Are you sure the problem is q-scroll and not q-list?. If you remove q-scroll, does the problem persist?. Nice - is this a pattern that can / should be used elsewhere?. I think it is a really good idea. @rstoenescu - what do you think? @zuck - fancy making a pull request that references this issue?. Hi. Thanks for reporting this. Can you please provide a link to a jsfiddle so we can replicate?. I was able to replicate. It seems that QDialog does not use the same approach to the EscapeKey as QModal, for example.\n```\nQModal:\n import EscapeKey from '../../utils/escape-key'\n  EscapeKey.register(() => {\n    if (!this.noEscDismiss) {\n      this.hide().then(() => {\n        this.$emit('escape-key')\n      })\n    }\n\n........................\nQDialog:\n  import { getEventKey } from '../../utils/event'\n'escape-key': () => {\n          this.hide().then(() => {\n            this.$emit('escape-key')\n            this.$emit('cancel')\n          })\n        }\n```. The issue might actually be deeper, though. Why is the error not caught in the promise construction?. Tracking this issue.. Nice and simple pull-request. Do you have more information or an RFC where this info can be seen? And it would be excellent if you tested it on a few backends like a classical express.js and also kinto...\nThe only thing that concerns me is your comment: \"If a user actually needs...\" I feel that the way it currently works is actually the way one expects it to work - and changing it now might actually break some systems. I think it would be more \"quasar-like\" if this was a config element with the current behavior as a default and your approach as an option.. Thanks for the detailed information, I must have been doing it \"wrong\" for years now. This part about the server response in the RFC is awesome:\n\n\"application/x-please-send-files\"\n\nIt's like stepping into a time machine.. I know what I meant. :) It was merely an accident. But perhaps it would make sense to start think about a mono-repo, like how vue et. al. do things. like @quasar/app-base for example. . try <q-icon name=\"ion-logo-instagram\"/>\nHave you seen the upgrade notes about the new version of ionicons?\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-extras/blob/109e5afc8f46e74747dddf3114f7e7d17ca1c417/ionicons/ionicons.css#L1402. Hey, thanks for opening the issue. I am not sure if this really fixes the problem. I just compared chrome and safari on mac, and depending on your screen scaling this becomes an issue - no matter if the fix is applied or not. So it seems you have just discovered an underlying rendering issue.\n@rstoenescu - any idea how to resolve this?\n\n. @felixis-1 - this is one of those deep applications of lots of business logic (including upload / link rendering, etc.) that is complex depending on your backend and your needs. I would recommend you check out the section of our documentation about building (and extending) reusable components.. I am going to venture a guess: you are using ESLint. This might explain why you are seeing differences between the dev and the build results. I have been seeing VERY funky behaviour lately.. As with my comment at #2105 - this too is a UI feature that would be nice to have, but someone needs to write the code for it. Where I come from, the person who has the idea is always responsible for making sure that it is realized. So make a PR (or trick someone else into doing it for you) and then we can see if it is something to bring into the project.. I like this idea, but really need you to bear with us on this kind of feature request. Unless someone makes a well-thought out PR, I don't see this landing before 1.0. First of all, this behaviour is spec. Here you can see the colors defined by material design:\nhttps://material.io/design/color/#color-usage-palettes\nThis gist by @GastroGeek may help you though:\nhttps://gist.github.com/GastroGeek/b7ca27802405f636de16ba444082a8f1\nIf you need nevertheless need to make modifications to existing components for your own personal reasons, I recommend following the procedure here:\u00a0http://quasar-framework.org/components/building-reusable-components.html. @pdanpdan - do you think that this information would be good in the docs? It seems that a lot of people (myself included) would like to know more than what we currently have there.. As in the response of @pdanpdan in the closed issue linked by @olegvakulenko, this is not going to change. If you need to make modifications to existing components, I recommend following the procedure here: http://quasar-framework.org/components/building-reusable-components.html\nThat said, XSS is not something you can just ignore - even if you are targeting electron (e.g. what happened with the Signal desktop app recently).\nFinally, please close this issue and make a new issue that is explicitly about the point you addressed in 2. above. Then make a PR against dev and we'll talk about it when it lands. Thanks!. @darkscript - I have seen the video and can confirm that something seems wrong. Thanks for reminding me to look into this.. This was an error in the usage of a custom directive.. I like the idea a lot. We are currently stabilizing and documenting the app-extension system - so I could envision a few ways to do this - probably using phantomJS or something similar. Um - is that because it is triggering everything on the page and making a reflow? Or am I not really understanding the issue here?. And furthermore, I really wonder if this is actually something that you should consider in your design decision - and not place this element on a page where the mobile user would have issues when the keyboard pops up on their screen. Well in that case the arrow would be on the left side of the tooltip of course - and in the middle .... I think it would be good to test it on Cordova and Electron. Can you please do that for us?. I am wondering about how this could be applied to QEditor. Having a paste event registered there might also be quite ueseful. On another note, tested it in a cordova emulator?. @jcperez-ch You need to update your PR because the only commit here is from five days ago...\n. @genyded - this has been added to the milestones for 1.0 - no need to be concerned. We will get to it ASAP. @amfine-soft-scheminel - that is really freaking clever.. Did you remove the <meta name=\"description\"> from the index.template.html\nThis one:\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"<%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.productDescription %>\">. Not exactly @pdanpdan - see \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLocaleUpperCase\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536672. The issue with \u00df and SS is tricky, and OP has a valid point, especially because this is now an ISO standard. I think we should consider adding a prop and letting the user pass a locale string.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10646. If it\u2019s being done with CSS, then we still have the problem that our approach is changing content.. And furthermore, the browser compatibility is terrible in languages such as Greek, Dutch and obviously in this case, German:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform#Browser_compatibility. I believe the OP was referring specifically to the issue where Quasar \"forces\" uppercase on e.g. buttons. For my understanding, the only workaround we have to offer devs in this situation is the no-caps prop?. No - nothing. It is just an edge-case that we need to add to the documentation. \n. I also sometimes find myself using a wrapping form element to do things like turn off autocorrect and autosuggest. I don't think q-form will land before we go to RC (unfortunately I dropped the ball on this one, sorry everybody), but it is something the core team really wants Quasar to have and we will be bringing it in sooner rather than later. Stay tuned to this thread for updates.. Well, I took a go at this, and found something interesting. I was able to get it to work by placing the following in /src/plugins/amplify.js\n```js\nimport Amplify, * as AmplifyModules from 'aws-amplify'\nimport AmplifyPlugin from 'aws-amplify-vue'\nimport AwsExports from './aws-exports'\nimport SignIn from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/SignIn.vue'\nimport SignUp from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/SignUp.vue'\nimport SignOut from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/SignOut.vue'\nimport ConfirmSignUp from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/ConfirmSignUp.vue'\nimport ConfirmSignIn from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/ConfirmSignIn.vue'\nimport ForgotPassword from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/ForgotPassword.vue'\nimport Authenticator from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/Authenticator.vue'\nimport SetMfa from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/SetMFA.vue'\nimport RequireNewPassword from 'aws-amplify-vue/src/components/authenticator/RequireNewPassword.vue'\nAmplify.configure(AwsExports)\nexport default ({ Vue }) => {\n  Vue.prototype.$Amplify = Amplify\n  Vue.use(AmplifyPlugin, AmplifyModules)\nVue.mixin({\n    components: {\n      amplifySignIn: SignIn,\n      amplifySignUp: SignUp,\n      amplifySignOut: SignOut,\n      amplifyConfirmSignUp: ConfirmSignUp,\n      amplifyConfirmSignIn: ConfirmSignIn,\n      amplifyForgotPassword: ForgotPassword,\n      amplifyAuthenticator: Authenticator,\n      amplifySetMfa: SetMfa,\n      amplifyRequireNewPassword: RequireNewPassword\n    }\n  })\n}\nThen I was able to construct the SignIn box like this in `/src/pages/index.vue`:\n\n```\n\nThe mixin makes it available everywhere (the so-called \"global mixin\" approach)\nThis seemed to be important too: \nVue.prototype.$Amplify = Amplify. Please note: Update to CDN required. We probably won't be building this before 1.0.0 lands, but if you are interested in preparing a PR / POC repo, then I'd look into reviewing.. \"where vuetify renders its style to\" - I am a little confused here. Did you copy this issue from another project to see who solves it for you first???. There is a tentative workaround using computed: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/Jxmxae\nhtml\n    <q-input :value=\"formattedDate\" >\n      <q-popup-proxy>\n        <q-date v-model=\"date\" />\n      </q-popup-proxy>\n    </q-input>\njs\n  computed: {\n    formattedDate(){\n      return Quasar.utils.date.formatDate(this.date, 'MM.DD.YY')\n    }. @hawkeye64 - Do you think we should put @click.stop=\"yourHandler\" in the docs if it isn't clear enough for the readers?. @s3rg3  - please update your post with a codepen to show what you have done..

In the title of the PR e.g. \"QFooter API typo\" or something like that.. Maybe something for 1.0 in combination with the QMediaPlayer app-extension from @hawkeye64 .

Thanks @rstoenescu for the reminder and the clarification - and thanks @iMakedonsky for raising this issue. Indeed, we are \"caught-in-the-middle-again\". \n\nWhenever I review projects, I consistently see cases where devs are not sanitising user-input. Now, if we can't merely wave off MITM / evil maid / browser-extension injections / pure P2P distributed serverless / db-less instances, what do we do?\nFirst of all, I must advise you to be vigilant with ALL types of user input. This includes text, but also includes images. I mean, we can add browser-side \"pseudo mime-type\" checking - but professionals can easily sidestep this and upload files that are not truly what they seem. GIFAR, for example is one such vector - but out of bounds PNGs are as well (among many, many others). The point is that YOU need to make sure that every bit and byte that ends up on a server is really safe. \nNEVERTHELESS - I do see your point here, and in the context of hardening the application, I would like to propose a new prop to that turns off this rendering. It will be optional though, because we must preserve backwards compliance at all costs.. When I make the PR, I will ask you to review it for me @iMakedonsky - ok?. Ok - great. Then since you are new to vulnerability reporting, I would like to just take this opportunity to remind you that best practice is not to directly report on a public repo (I learned this the hard way too, and now seek more discrete channels). No reason to give the haters ammunition. ;). Thanks for the report. Can you please include a codepen showcasing this error.. fine, then please post a code example here.. Yeah, thanks - I was about to ask.. One thing that I really like using is the vue-devtools standalone electron\ninterface. Maybe try that out...\n\n. Can you update all quasar deps and confirm that this is still happening?\n. Thanks for the report. Can you please update your bug with the required information about version (make sure you are on latest everything) and create a codepen that shows this issue?\n\nThanks. These are not latest versions. Please consider upgrading immediately:\n@quasar/cli - 1.0.0-beta.2\nquasar - 1.0.0-beta.8\n@quasar/app - 1.0.0-beta.10 -- Quasar Framework App CLI. There must be a more elegant way of doing this, because what if there are hundreds of thousands (or millions) of days? Wouldn't it be faster to convert the dates to unix time and simply check if it is >== and <== ???. Well, what if they have a range of dates that could be anywhere from 15000 BCE until 2020 CE? (Like if they are building a timeline for the development of artificial intelligence...) There are more than a couple thousand days there.... Moved this declaration to after the \"non-ctrlKey\" for a probably insignificant speedup.. I cherry-picked the typo. Thought I should just bring it along for the ride.. why?. this is out of scope for the PR. ??? a finally without a fall-through? using try without a catch?. The openExternal boolean enables choosing between opening the URL in a new tab or not. This is useful for a link like tel:+1-123-456-789 that should ......... ..

I'm sure we could, we would have to reimplement some of the math from tinycolor2.\nHow important is it to spit out color in the different formats? Is Hex + RGBA enough? Or do we need HSV, etc.?\n. I went ahead and removed tinycolor2, I had to add two color functions. I dropped HSL and the value/model is now a flat object: { h: 0, s: 0, v: 0, r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1, hex: '#000000' }. @spectrolite Thanks for the feedback. I'm not sure how I feel about adding both HSL and HSV/B. I would rather choose one or the other and keep the value object flat for simplicity.\nSome things to consider:\n\nHSB/HSV values cannot be present along with HSL values (H and S are not in common)\nThe UI only shows RGBA and Hex values to the user, so user intuitiveness is not a factor\nIf you need HSL values somewhere in your app you could still do a quick conversion yourself\nThe math is not hard at all, and I can borrow that from somewhere else\n\nPersonally I don't care if we drop HSV for HSL or drop both. I think providing at least RGBA and Hex is enough.\n. ",

You can look at these file uploads as if they are embedded form submissions (POSTs). This should be similar in Laravel.\nWhen the main form containing the q-uploader component is submitted my app \"connects\" the previously uploaded files to the form data. It knows how to do this by generating a uuid on main form creation that is submitted both with the main form and with the file uploads (using the additionalFields property). \nI don't know whether this is the best way to do this, but it works. \nHowever the feature request mentioned above would simplify things. One could then submit everything in one go.\nHTH.. As a workaround, this works:\nadded (files) {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n          this.$refs.uploader.upload()\n        }, 200)\n      },\nSo it seems like a timing issue. . That was quick ;-). Thanks. Don't think so, but being a javascript novice I might be wrong. \nBy pasting I mean copying the image in another program (Ctrl-C, Command-C), switching to the browser, then pasting it (Ctrl-V, Command-V).\nFor pasting an image (I think other files types are not supported) requires different code than #957. I would expect drag&drop to be implemented in the q-uploader component, whereas #958 might require a separate page level component. There must be a mechanism to determine the paste target (although by default it could be the q-uploader component if there was only one). \nAs a user pasting an image would be convenient if the image comes from another program (say a screenshot program), so that without first saving the image, it could be directly pasted in the web app. \nWhat also made me create 2 issues, is the fact that image pasting is not supported in all browsers. .

    "webnoob": "I've got the latest source and it appears the set buttons have been removed. I was also looking for the same feature (and thought I had seen it somewhere). Haven't dug into what controls it bu certainly on the latest source I can just select the date without using the set button.. @realcarbonneau So rather than just having the set buttons \"gone\" - we will disable them? That seems like a less breaking change than it is at the moment \ud83d\udc4d (Although for me, I prefer them off). I've done all the changes required for the mat theme but I'm having a hard time with the iOS theme. We want it to appear as (for a 15 min interval):\n00\n15\n30\n45\nNormally, with no intervals, when you scroll to position 1, it's assuming it's minute 1 and calculating the CSS transitions etc as such. With intervals, we need position 1 to actually be minute 15 but if we do that then it's making the CSS transitions way off.\nAs it stands, on the iOS picker, I've changed minuteInterval() to return like:\nminuteInterval () {\n      return this.timeInterval\n        ? 60 / this.timeInterval\n        : (this.pmax && isSameDate(this.pmax, this.model, 'hour') ? this.pmax.getMinutes() : 59) - this.minuteMin + 1\n    }\nand then to display:\n{{ __pad(timeInterval ? timeInterval * n - timeInterval : n + minuteMin - 1) }}\nWhich produces the correct display but with the dragging etc it's just treating as minute 1, 2, 3 etc.\nAny guidance on the best thing to do here?. I've not been on this for the past couple of weeks but I still need to get it done for my app launch. \nIf I get it done over the next couple of days, would it be possible to be included in the 0.15 sprint?. I've got it working well for the mat theme but was having issues with iOS a couple of weeks ago. I was planning on sitting down tomorrow to take a look again but if it's something you're happy implementing then go ahead (I have tons on my to do list for my product launch already)\nAs it stands, I've implemented a new prop :time-interval=\"15\" (it accepts any of the following: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30) which when set just shows the 0, 15, 30 and 45 minute sections on the clock face. Clicking between the intervals on the clock face will select the closest interval.\nIf want the existing work then just let me know - there isn't much to the changes TBH.. Ok, no problem, I'll carry on.\nGood point about the interval, I'll change it. . Hey Razvan,\nUnfortunately not - I had other pressing things I needed to get done and this fell out of radar. I still need / want the functionality but don't really have the time to complete the work at this point.\nFrom memory I have the changes made for android but not iOS. . Thanks for your time. Appreciate it.. For completeness, this was my final solution:\nif (ctx.prod) {\n          cfg.plugins = cfg.plugins.filter(plugin => {\n            return plugin.constructor.name !== 'UglifyJsPlugin'\n          })\n          const UglifyJSPlugin = require('uglifyjs-webpack-plugin')\n          cfg.plugins.push(\n            new UglifyJSPlugin({\n              parallel: true,\n              sourceMap: false,\n              uglifyOptions: {\n                mangle: false\n              }\n            })\n          )\n        }\nAnother option would have been:\nmangle: {\n  reserved: ['myService1', 'myService2']\n}\nWhich means it will mangle the rest but not the bits I don't want it to (I've since changed to this pattern.. This is intended behaviour and to make this work as expected, emit-values and map-options should be used on the QSelect.. I'll take these points into account (didn't think of using $q.notify - good point).\nNoted about local storage.\nWe've actually opted to make this an app extension now so I'll make the changes in there.\nThanks for the pointers.. Ok, no problem. I'm looking at getting it done next week sometime as I'm away this weekend.. Ignore that last commit for QDrawer, I've done something wrong. Working it out now.. I'm closing this PR because I've messed up the commit and want to clear the branch on my tree.\nWill do PR's for a Cookie App Ext (TBD) and the Drawer change.. I'll do a PR soon.. Might be worth noting, I've found away to achieve the same result without this PR so if you're worried about knock on effects then it can be worked around.\nI personally don't think a prop like overlay should affect element position but it's up to you.\nNote, the work around would be setting :overlay=\"!miniState\" so it only goes into overlay mode when it's being hovered.. Ah right. I'll apply the animate prop for now then.\nThanks for your hard work.. @rstoenescu I'd be happy to do a PR for this if needs be. I propose a new prop:\ndelay: {\n  type: Number,\n  default: 600\n}\nFrom what I can see, it'd need to apply to the show and hide emits.. @mesqueeb Well it appears he made the same changes I made locally. I \"think\" the issue is I didn't change the CSS transitions! Will take note for future.. So it turns out there is also a server-entry.js file (SSR version I think). This might be the reason you've seen issues.. Funny, I had that wrapped in parenthesis but removed on re-format. Whoops. I'll add it bad in.\nRe: options. It seems that both would suffice. extendOptions looks like it just contains the props used in that component. options looks like it includes all the other baked in ones. preFetch is on both though. Would you prefer me to use options?. Ah right, I didn't even see that did anything with preFetch.\nWill do that as well.. I had someone to test the changes for me so I went ahead and did them without chatting about it (I thought you could just look at the changes and see if you're happy). Feel free to grab me on discord.\nBasically, I've reverted the previous fix and am instead just changing the initial array to contain the correct components. \nTested on SPA and SSR (thanks to @ValRush in #3501 )..

    "realcarbonneau": "As a reference, I will add full flexibility for all datetime picker options, while at the same time leaving the default behavior the way most people prefer it.. \nCheck the video, Modal B should work.  I will try to figure it out.. Replaced by #1357 for new functional component version of picker. A functional component are faster but are always re-redered.  Normal components are a bit heavier to setup, BUT are only re-rendered if their props change.  \nThe doc is quite clear:\n\n...we can mark components as functional, which means that they\u2019re stateless (no data) and instanceless (no this context).\"\n\nI am quite worried to see that most of the components have been converted to functional components which will always be re-rendered.  In addition, this bypasses many optimizations that Vvue has designed.\nhttps://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#Functional-Components\nAlso see the coments by Linus Borg (from Vue) at https://forum.vuejs.org/t/performance-for-large-numbers-of-components/13545/10\n\nFunctional components are, well, like pure functions: props go in as arguments, virtual dom nodes come out as the return value. These components don't actually have an instance, no local data or lifecycle hooks etc. \nThat makes them cheaper during initial rendering than normal components.\nBut they also have a downside: Everytime the parent of a functional component updates, the functional component is re-rendered with it (i'm only talking about virutal DOM here, btw.). The reason for this is mostly technical in nature, as Evan explained:\nNormal components, however, are heavier during initial rendering, because in addition to generating their virtual DOM nodes, they also have to set up their instance.\nBut that is a \"one-time\" cost that you pay during initial render. Now after this, whenever the parent updates because it's data changed, the child components are not affected by that, except if that data change affects their props.\"\n\nAlso note that as of Vue 2.5.0+, functional components can also be created using templates, so there is no reason to complexify the code to make functional components that are basically template based.\n<template functional>\n</template>\n. I created a test page with a bunch of QModal+QModalLayout.  I ran it under 0.14.7 (Normal components), and 0.15 where QModalLayout is a functional component.  During initial loading (refresh), contrary to what we would expect, the 0.14.7 loaded fastest, v0.15.0 took 50% longer to load.  However, changing the screen had the same performance in both cases.  In both cases, alot of time seems wasted for hidden components regardless of their type, however, I could not find the cause yet. \nProcessing Time (ms) = Total - Idle\nLoading v0.14.7: 3701ms - 1799.6ms = 1901.4ms \nLoading v0.15.0: 5550ms - 2475.9ms = 3074.1ms\nUpdate v0.14.7: 9442ms - 5714.6ms = 3727.4ms\nUpdate v0.15.0: 10035ms - 6285.5ms = 3749.5ms\nIt seems that using functional components or normal components does not make much difference.  Also, using a template or createElement()/h() does not make a difference either.\nUsually, it is best to keep the code as simple as possible until something is specifically proven to be a performance problem, instead of optimizing and complexifying, just in c\nEventually, I can try to build 4 versions of the same component (Functional/Normal/Template/Programmed), and 4 test pages with the component repeated 100 times within a collapsible or something similar.\nPerformance test v0.14.7\n\nPerformance test v0.15.0\n\nScreenshots test v0.14.7\n\n\nScreenshots test v0.15.0\n\n\n. I redid the tests with the regular component you provided, so everything is under v0.15.0.  In both cases, everything is being re-rendered, this is strange, I don't know why yet, this would be where the biggest performance gain can be found.  As for the difference between Functional and Regular components, they are almost the same, functional components loading a bit faster, and regular components faster for changes.  Since most people will spend very little time loading and most of the time using the apps, the regular components might be better in most cases. It's also better to keep the code simpler and only complexify when really neccessary. I will try test more with different scenarios.\nProcessing Time (ms) = Total - Idle\nLoading Regular: 5158ms - 1953.7ms = 3204.3ms\nLoading Functional: 5077ms - 2055.6ms = 3021.4ms\nUpdate Regular: 9804ms - 6070.2ms = 3733.8ms\nUpdate Functional: 9884ms - 5915.1ms = 3968.9ms\nVideo Regular Component\n\nVideo Functional Component\n\nScreenshots Regular Component\n\n\nScreenshots Functional Component\n\n\n. Important to note that loading times were 50% longer in v0.15, independent of Functional/Regular components in the test.  I am not sure what is the cause for this.... I have been working on various testing code and analysing the differences between the types of components.  I will report results back shortly.. It took me a while to figure out because the Quasar components where not behaving the way Vue says they should.  All functional components get re-rendered whenever there is a reactive change anywhere in the DOM and regular components only re-render when the reactive change is relevant to them.  \nHowever, because most of your parent components were functional, everything was being re-rendered all the time because if the parent functional component gets re-rendered, all of its children get re-rendered or worse, re-created for regular components.  This is easy to test, put the functional version of your q-card surrounding any of your demo pages with regular components (eg button.vue), and add reactive variable anywhere on the page (even hidden and outside of the q-card), and update the field. This will cause all quasar components to re-render, including the regular quasar components.\nI created an app to test the two types of components, created two different ways and these are the results:\nFunctional components can be up to 5 times faster to create and up to 2 times faster to update.  BUT only if they do NO work and have NO regular child components! (see screen shot 1)\nRegular components that do alot of work (or have many children) will take the same time to create as functional components, but can be many times faster than functional components depending on the work they do and the children underneath since they will only do work required by the applicable reactivity. (see screen shot 2)\nAnd there is no real difference between using template or programming components, so it would seem that Template components would be a better choice to reduce complexity and increase maintainability where applicable.\nThe app is in a pull request (#1366) now so you and others can test also.  I included it under \u201cweb-test -> Performance\u201d in the demo app.\nNo Work and No Child Components\n\nWith Work and/or Child Components\n\n. @rstoenescu any thoughts or questions on these results and the pull request?  In summary:\n1) Any component that can have child components should be regular components.\n2) Some very simple inner-most components without state could benefit as functional, maybe like Qvideo or Qicon.  But this would have to be tested and benchmarked (the app I made could be modified for that) \n3) No significant performance difference between template and programming based components, so templates are better because they are easier to understand and maintain in many cases.\n  . Here are some more results.  This compares two versions of the QIcon component for 10,000 instances. The QIcon is a relatively simple component without much code. \nQIcon Regular Component\n\nQIcon Functional Component\n\nPercentage of processing time of regular over functional components (positive number is regular is slower)\nCreate 229%\nDelete 85%\nExternal Update -13%\nRender Update 71%\nClearly, the initial loading is alot faster for the functional component vesion, and a change to a reactive prop (in this case, changing the icon) causing a re-render is also faster. However, the regular component is 13% faster for any external reactive update (eg, all changes outside of the icon component).  \nIt's a tradeoff depending on the needs.  If it is a relatively static page, or one that is reloaded often or if the icons changes often, then a functional component would be faster over the long term.  If it is a dynamic app with alot of changes happening constantly on the page, and mostly external to the icon (eg many modern SPAs), then the regular component will take less resources over the long term.  \nThe best of both worlds might be SSR and regular components, but this will require further tests.. I understand, the removal of \"flex-basis 0\" of.col (flex.styl)\" has the widest risk side effects, but I see other places where forcing the flex-basis it causing problems.   . The video below is using the modal from the qusar dev branch. I manually modify the classes and style.  We can see that the position:absolute and the flex-basis:0 is breaking the flexbox flow.  Once these are removed, then we can have clean placement using only flexbox as can be seen at the end of the video.  The final result is what my correction provides.\n\n. Here is another example of \"flex-basis: 0\" causing problems (video below). It seems like \"width: 100%\" was imposed for columns to fix the side effects of \"flex-basis: 0\". There is no reason to always override flex-basis and width of columns.  \"flex-basis: 0\" should only be imposed when absolute sizing is required.  The flexbox could be much better used in many places to reduce the code complexity and improve maintenance.  For example, there are many places where 100vh is used, which breaks subsequent relative height usage, and make the use less flexible.  One specific example is the layout, in general it could be cleaned up and made simpler by leveraging the flexbox.\n\n. Thank you for your feedback.  I have reviewed and adjusted this PR, the changes are now be isolated only to the QModal and QModalLayout.  I have also re-tested with the demo/tests and did not find any side effects.  \nIf you want the QModalLayout to be used outside of a QModal without my changes, I can add a correction a check for that.\nAlso, please advise me of any side effects you observed and I will correct them.\nThis is an important PR, when I develop, I don't want to have to specify the Modal size in most cases.  I want it to adjust to the content and the window. \nI will be maintaining this PR and keeping it up to date and using it within my mini-fork.. You can already specify any format you want by using the format prop.  See the two links below.  \nI also have a pull request #1357 that will use the browser local and automatically set the time picker 24h setting\nhttp://quasar-framework.org/components/datetime.html\nhttp://quasar-framework.org/components/handling-js-date.html#Format-for-display. @webnoob I am doing some work on datetime also, I could try to include this if you can't get it working.  I will add it to my list.. Other intervals could be added also, like select week or month granularity.. Continue on it if you can.  I will try to look at it when I get to it, but no guarantees when. \nIdeally, the interval props should be flexible for any factor of 60.   Eg (time-interval%60 === 0). Ok, thank you.  I have added an example to the table demo and submitted the pull request #1406. Ok, tell me when it is ready and I will add what I can.  . I am close to fixing this, it is a more general problem that is a bit more complicated to fix.  The final fix will probably include a css pseudo-element with a negative z-index shadow to cover all cases of adjacent elements.. I also added the disable tests for QBtnToggle, see video below.\n. There is no raise effect on button clicks/active for iOS, so this bug does not apply to iOS. I have submitted a fix.  You will be able to use the QChat without avatars, however, to mix messages with and without avatars and keep them aligned, you need to supply placeholder avatars.  See the details in the pull request.\nHere is a video of the reproduction of your issue:\n\n. Another fix coming on this.... These are more fixes for the QChat:\nFixed v-if slot section: it needed to be adjusted for the new structure\nFixed avatar named slot: Was never working, it is now implemented.  I also added a test case in the demo\nFixed v-for keys that were not unique:  The v-for keys where the label and the message text, which can neer be guaranteed to be unique, there were already errors in the console for non-unique keys.\nSee the video below:\n\n. BTW, I wasn't sure if the original broken avatar slot was a mistake or by design.  Tell me if you want it removed.. ScreenToGif, open source and free! http://www.screentogif.com/  :). I also removed the required for toggleColor and set it to 'primary' by default to simplify it's most basic use.  This may also help novice users to use it more easily for a first try.. I looked through the code and this most probably would have to come through the following stylus files and variables.\ncore.variables.styl: $space-base, $space-x-base, $space-y-base, $spaces\nsize.styl: $space, $spaces, $value\nMaybe it was a temporary corruption, however, if it happens again, you can try to trace these..

This now integrates a general mixin and integrates the explicit display mode setting into QColor\nHowever, I think in general, the QColor and QDateTime need to have their naming convention harmonized.

I had attempted to have a generalized approach to avoid any of invisible default color combinations.

    "jkole": "@igorgo Same issue here\nInteresting that, for me at least, refreshing the page (on Chrome, haven't tested ff) does not help. In other words, for me in the dev environment the following steps could be added:\n\nRefresh the page (after refresh the forward nav button will immediately be available)\nOpen the modal\nThe modal cannot be closed.\nClose the tab running the application\nOpen a new tab with the same url\nOpen the modal\nThe modal can be closed as expected\n\nI would also note that clicking the mysterious forward nav button after closing the modal has the same effect as refreshing the page (i.e. subsequent modals can't be closed).. Don't have time to dig into this further at the moment, but seems to me the issue arises where the modalId is checked in line 184 of QModal.vue.  I think the flow goes like this:\n\nAfter opening then closing the first modal, we are left with openModelNumber == 0, but with the last entry in window.history containing a state object with modalId == 1. (This is what produces the odd forward nav button after closing the modal).\nClicking the browser forward nav button points the current window history state to the one containing that state object with modalId == 1.\nOpening a new modal then assigns a modalId of 1 again, and a new window.history state object with modalID of 1 is pushed to the top of the stack.\nWhen we try close that modal, line 184 checks if state.modalId >= this.__modalId...and since both == 1, it returns immediately rather than closing the modal.\n\nI imagine something similar must be happening with browser refresh rather than clicking the forward nav button.. Don\u2019t think the entire issue is due to HMR since the quasar docs desktop examples have the same behavior (though maybe not after page refresh - need to check that).. ",

This way HMR will correctly do its job. In production this scenario can\u2019t happen, so no bugs for final product.\n\nHaving said that, I'm not sure what it means we should do to fix it in development.

Hi @rstoenescu \nHi @dlbass \nI just found the right way to solve this bug:\n.q-gallery-carousel img{\n    display: block;\n}\n@rstoenescu please implement it in your next build.\nRegards,\nMohammed. @rstoenescu Awesome news! thank you.. @rstoenescu WOW thank you so much, I'm really excited about v0.15\nHowever, I've created a workaround to solve the issue temporarily, for anyone that needs to be sure that the modal will be open for a specific amount of time, here is my entire LoadingModel.vue file:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u062c\u0627\u0631 \u062a\u0646\u0641\u064a\u0630 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0628\n\n\n\nimport { QModal, QSpinnerHearts } from \"quasar\";\n\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    open: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      default: false\n    }\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      isOpen: false,\n      modalCloseProcessing: false,\n      modalMustStillOpenAtLeastFor: 250,//In miliseconds\n      modalOpenSinceInDateFormat: null\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    closed() {\n      this.$emit(\"closed\", true);\n    }\n  },\n  watch: {\n    open: function(newValue) {\n      let vm = this;\n\n      if (newValue && !vm.modalCloseProcessing) {\n        vm.isOpen = true;\n        vm.modalCloseProcessing = true;\n        vm.modalOpenSinceInDateFormat = new Date();\n      } else if (!newValue && vm.modalCloseProcessing) {\n        let modalOpenSinceInMilisecondFormat =\n          new Date() - vm.modalOpenSinceInDateFormat;\n        if (\n          modalOpenSinceInMilisecondFormat < vm.modalMustStillOpenAtLeastFor\n        ) {\n          setTimeout(function() {\n            vm.isOpen = false;\n            vm.modalCloseProcessing = false;\n          }, (vm.modalMustStillOpenAtLeastFor -\n            modalOpenSinceInMilisecondFormat));\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  components: {\n    QModal,\n    QSpinnerHearts\n  }\n};\n\n\n.confirmation-modal>>>.to-rtl {\n  direction: rtl;\n}\n\n```. @rstoenescu Sure, the project that I'm currently working on is RTL project, please just tell me how can I help and I'll do my best.. Hi @rstoenescu \nThank you for the instructions, here is my current working code in case if anyone face the same issue.\nIn the main.js I have the follwing:\n```\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\n  store.commit('loadingRoute', true);\n  next()\n})\nrouter.afterEach((to, from) => {\n  store.commit('loadingRoute', false);\n})\n```\nIn the guards that may prevent the user from accessing them depends for example if the user is authenticated or no I put the following:\nstore.commit('loadingRoute', false);\nIn the App.vue's template I put the QAjaxBar:\n<q-ajax-bar ref=\"bar\" color=\"purple-6\" size=\"2px\" :reverse=\"true\" :delay=\"0\" />\nAnd I watch the vuex's loadingRoute\nwatch: {\n    loadingRoute(status) {\n      if (status) {\n        this.$refs.bar.start();\n      } else {\n        this.$refs.bar.stop();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n. Hi @zouyaoji\nI think it is a normal behavior, it happens to me as well, since the route has been downloaded then the process will be too fast in order to be noticed by us.\nYou can check if it is working or no using the console.log()\nRegards. Hi @rstoenescu \nThank you for your reply.\nHere is a video https://www.dropbox.com/s/cpti6uy7v9wy7vl/20180126_201037.mp4?dl=0 that shows the scrollbar that I mean in action.\nWarm Regards,\nMohammed. @rstoenescu Here is the website if you want to take a look at the code as well:\nhttps://romionline.com\nJust view it on Android mobile with Chrome browser. \n\nAh. You mean that. That are the scrollbars that the browsers use when on mobile. There is no way around it if you don't want to lose the native scrolling (which is smooth). Trust me, you want the native scrolling. Sorry.\n\n@rstoenescu Aha, thank you for letting me know that, I thought it is related to QTabs.\n\nBy the way. Nice website/app. Would like to see that on https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-awesome when it's done.\n\nThank you, sure, it will be my pleasure to do so, I'll let you know when it will be finished.\nAll the best,\nMohammed. Note: I said N to this option Use Vue-i18n? (recommended if you support multiple languages) (y/N) when created my app but now I want to add it, how, please?. Hi @rstoenescu thank you for your reply, I did it but still same errors appear!. @rstoenescu should I create i18n folder or do something else?. Hi @rstoenescu thank you for the quick reply, yes it is already enabled in quasar.conf and it works for some other components that I tested it with but doesn't work with App.vue!. Hi @rstoenescu thank you for the quick reply, no I don't want to make any redirect, this redirect means we should have to maintain two websites/apps(this is the current situation for one of my apps and it makes me tired).\nI wish if we can in Quasar have an option to disable the server side rending for a specific user agent(s) without making a redirect or anything like that.. Hi @rstoenescu thank you so much, I understand, I'm going to work on this and will update here when I get any progress in case if anyone faced a similar issue in the future.. Hi @rstoenescu, thank you, I just updated to beta.21 and will continue my test now.. Hi @rstoenescu , thank you so much, I use import { Cookies } from 'quasar' in my Vuex store modules files as well, because I have a file for each module, what should I do here? should I also use const cookies = Cookies.parseSSR(ssrContext)?. For example the following:\n```\n    login: ({ commit, state }, payload) => {\n        commit('setAuthFetching', true);\n    Vue.http.post('users/login', payload).then(response => {\n        const token = response.headers.map['x-auth'][0];\n        const currentUser = response.body;\n        Vue.http.options.headers = { 'x-auth': token };\n        Cookies.set('x-auth', token, {expires: 365, path: '/'});\n        commit('setToken', token);\n        commit('setCurrentUser', currentUser);\n        commit('setAuthFetching', false);\n        commit('setAuthenticated', true);\n        commit('resetLoginErrors');\n        bus.$emit('successLogin', response)\n    }, response => {\n        // error callback\n        commit('setAuthFetching', false);\n        commit('addLoginError', response.body);\n        bus.$emit('successLogin', response)\n    });\n}\n\n```\nIs the login action in my auth.js module. Hi @rstoenescu thank you so much, is it possible to get ssrContext in the module actions like for example:\nlogin: ({ commit, state, ssrContext }, payload) => {\n}. Or maybe making ssrContext a global variable in order to be accessible across all the app files?. Hi @rstoenescu, thank you so much, I went ahead and created a function for each module that needs ssrContext.. Note: I use vue-resource as HTTP client here. I just made a quick not accurate test using axios what happened is instead of redirecting me when a promise get rejected(like with vue-resource) it gives me 500 | Internal Server Error.\nIs this normal?. I think the issue related to Promise.all and when one of its promises get rejected.. I want when one of the promises get rejected the app still work and wait for the other promises to be completed.. Even when all of the promises get rejected I want the app to still work.. I fixed it using return  Promise.all(promisesArray.map(p => p.catch(e => e)))\n                .then(u => {}, e => {}); and now my preFetch function as follows:\n```\n  preFetch({ store, currentRoute, redirect }) {\n      var promisesArray = [\n          store.dispatch(\"fetchCurrentUser\"),\n          store.dispatch(\"getAllCategories\"),\n          store.dispatch(\"getAllBrands\"),\n          store.dispatch(\"getAllSizes\"),\n          store.dispatch(\"getAllColors\")\n      ]\n  return  Promise.all(promisesArray.map(p => p.catch(e => e)))\n            .then(u => {}, e => {});\n\n}\n``\nI also switched to axios because I get some weird bahavior fromvue-resource` and I didnt want to spend a lot of time to debug it.\nMy soulution source is here.. @ExNG @panstromek I'm here talking about how Nust generate(prerender) a static website, it will not affect at all how Quasar currently works, it just an extra feature(maybe mode) that makes Quasar in my opinion \"complete solution\".\nIt just extra feature/mode so if you don't need it then don't use it, however regarding all the available tools(like Vue-press) that generate(prerender) a static website it is recommended that your website must not contain that much pages(I believe several hundred is ok) however it depends on the system specifications that you will generate the static files on, from its name it is good for \"static websites\".. @rstoenescu The issue is I always get 404 page on quasar dev -m ssr from the server no matter what! even if I removed the following route:\n{\n    path: '*',\n    name: '404',\n    component: () => import('components/Error404')\n  }\nThe page that I received from the server is 404 | Page Not Found. Hi @rstoenescu thank you, but I don't want my website to be down for the building time, because I push a lot of commits per day, so what I did is creating a new folder say quasar-ssr then copy the files from dist/ssr-mat/ to it then run the PM2 commands in this new folder, and programmed my script to do this automatically and now everything is fine :). Hi @pdanpdan thank you for your reply, sure, here is the build settings:\nbuild: {\n      env: ctx.dev\n        ? { // so on dev we'll have\n          API: JSON.stringify('http://localhost:3030')\n        }\n        : { // and on build (production):\n          API: JSON.stringify('https://app.romionline.com')\n        },\n      rtl: true,\n      scopeHoisting: true,\n      vueRouterMode: 'history',\n      // gzip: true,\n      // analyze: true,\n      // extractCSS: false,\n      // useNotifier: false,\n      extendWebpack(cfg) {\n      }\n    }\n. Hi @rstoenescu thank you, so what should I do is create an issue at postcss-rtl and telling them that when I build in Quasar nothing work but in dev everything is fine? and this issue appeared in the latest Quasar updates, because before that everything was fine and they will know the issue?. @rstoenescu thank you so much, this link helped me a lot, for an unknown reason the /* rtl:ignore */ didn't work for me, maybe it gets stripped when running the build commands in my circumstances, however after making some try and error here is what worked for me:\n.current-price {\n  left: 14px/*rtl:14px*/;\n}\nUsing /*rtl:{value}*/..

I just wanted to have some default behavior, so to say \"out of the box\", since this one is very often used.\nP.S. Thank you for your work, it's great.  Quasar is the best js framework I've ever seen.. @frankbrussel \nI made some changes and fixes. Pressing Tab now processed when the popover is open. Also added prop \"auto-open\". You can toggle it at the top of the page. Pls check the following link:\nhttps://www.technofavorit.com.ua/quasar/#/form/select\nDo not forget to refresh the page (F5) if there is a cached prevous version. Is there correct behavior as you described?. >Two things...\nThanks for yout comment! I'll take it all into account, work is still in progress.... @pdanpdan \n@frankbrussel \nI made some changes:\n dropdown icon rotate when open/hide popover\n fix popover jumps around the screen when input filter and popover located at the top of the field (Still thinking about this. For now just removed reposition() from onInputFilter())\n fix lose focus when click on chips and clear\n add props loading, loadingLabel, noResultsLabel, noDataLabel and implements\n* mouse and keyboard have same selection\nPls check new version at the following link:\nhttps://www.technofavorit.com.ua/quasar/#/form/select. I made some changes, and I think that's all. Let's wait for @rstoenescu review this.... > \n\nCan we also have an option to filter if the user starts typing and the QSelect is focused?\nMuch how the native select works where you can type to select available options in the list without having to drill into it. This helps for data-entry focused people who are familiar with the available options already\n\nAs far as i know it will be available in v1. There are has couple errors in #1219\nAlso implemented plural handler for sharing with multiple translations. >Yes, good additions, but imo not all should be merged.\ntable.noResults, table.columns, editor.size7 should stay as is.\nAbout table.columns:\nhttps://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/econ_dict/21189\nI think it's all right here.\nAbout table.noResults and editor.size7  - it's a matter of taste ) Yet in most text editors size7 just like here.\nP.S. I think that size3 should be a \"\u041e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439\". What do you think?\nBest regards, Alex.. Yes, of course, Razvan). I think it would be better to change other languages (hr, pl, ro) for use plural handler also...\nOf course, unused languages can be removed from the plural handler.  But languages are still added.\nSo it's up to you, Razvan ). Hello. There are many options.\nFor example, onfocus trigger function that fills the field with some data, based on other fields. \nOr an translator - by press Tab onblur from previous field fills this field with translated value... \nI personally experienced this problem during development.\nIn any case, I believe that for autocomplete the more correct method is to use input, rather than watch value. It must respond to input by the user, and not to some internal methods.\nOther option - you can have autofocus on this field. When open the form or flipping through is filled from the database. and popover will be showing.... Good point, thanks! listMaxHeight will be more appropriate.\nI`m not sure about empty default. E.g. IE do not recognized scroll on viewport without setting \"heigh\" or \"max-heigt\" property.... Will add, thanks ). Hmm... Adding SPACE handler will make it impossible to enter a space in the filter. I revert this change. Let's wait for @rstoenescu. Still not sure about this... The whole idea is that the field remains in focus until the user leaves it explicitly.\nSo the field remains in focus even after popover hide by click on body or option. Simply put, hiding popover does not cause field lose focus. Of course, except if you click (tap) on another field or element which can take focus. I wonder if this is the correct behavior?\nI would appreciate hearing other opinion on this .... Thanks for your comment! We need to clarify something here:\n1. When QSelect field gets focus by click - this triggers the popover to show.\nBut when QSelect field gets focus by press \"Tab\" on previous field then field only displayed as \"focused\" (Highlighted).\nIn this way user can \"Tab\" to the next field.\nPress key \"Enter\" (or click of course) on such focused field  - triggers the popover to show.\nAlthough the field remains highlighted but physically focus goes to the options list (or to the \"filter\" input on desktop platform, if it is here).\nBy the way @blur not emitted in this case like now.\n2a & 2b\n - click on option (not multiple)\n - press \"Enter\" on option (not multiple)\n - press \"Esc\"\n - click somewhere else \nall of this triggers the popover to hide. Physically focus go to the field so user can \"Tab\" to the next field.  Because if the field lose focus the user will not be able navigate by \"Tab\".\nAnd of course you can use any @events to trigger any other actions.\nIt is also possible to implement prop like \"auto-open\" for popover opened when field get focus.\nBut notice - in order to navigate by \"Tab\" popover need to be closed (by press \"Esc\" e.g.)\nTo make another behavior, need to move the search filter from popover to the field inline. (like in QAutocomplete e.g.) \nBut i'm not sure if this is correct (\"a la material\")\nP.S. Of course QAutocomplete need to be fixed for hide popover when field lose focus.. >This was your original comment about, right, for which you were mostly looking for comments?\nAha, exactly ) But other comments are also very useful\n\nEven if the popover would show, the user could still tab to the next field, am I correct?\n\nNeah... as i said earlier  - in order to navigate by \"Tab\" popover need to be closed. And it's natural. When popover is open, physically the focus is on it. But the field remains highlighted (not physically focused).\n\nI have tried searching for material guidelines for how to deal with tab-use\n\nI meant a little bit different. The material concept is the layers. The popover layer is higher and you work with it, everything else under it should not be in focus. Popover casts a shadow on the bottom layer, indicating that he is now in charge. Therefore, the filter input is now placed inside it.\nOn the other hand, in order for everything to work as you wrote - need to move the filter inside the field inline like in QAutocomplete. By the way, this will also solve another problem. When you start typing something into the search, the height of the popover changes, and it repositions, jumps around the screen... This happens when the field is somewhere at the bottom of the screen, and the popover does not fit below, and is located at the top of the field.\nI can suggest looking at the current version of this PR (I temporarily put it there, later delete it):\nhttps://www.technofavorit.com.ua/quasar/#/form/select\n. > select with filter is really nice, great addition\nIt is not my addition, actually this feature already implemented in current release e.g. (0.14.7)\n\non the colored versions: it is not very clear whether they are in focus or not\n\nYes it is. This happens when \"inverted\" option is set on QSelect. This is native behavior and can be solved by custom css.\n\nIt seems that the images of the checkbox/radio button are also part of the tabindex\n\n\u0421heckbox/radio are focusable (have a tabindex). This can be fixed by adding to them props \"tabindex\" with value \"-1\". This should be done in the QSelect component itself. I'll try what can be done...\n\nHowever, the Tab then doesn't always go to a logical place\n\nOf course) Because at this time the focus is on popover which physically located at the bottom of the document (at the end of DOM). I repeat myself: To make another behavior, need to move the search filter from popover to the field inline. (like in QAutocomplete e.g.) But i'm not sure that @rstoenescu will approve this.  As an option, may be to add a property such as \"inline-filter\" or somthing like this...\n. >PPS: I searched, and for the QAutocomplete, there is already a bug report: #951\nI just added PR #1238 . import i18n from '../i18n'\nin first line. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/select\n\nCalling element.select() will not necessarily focus the input, so it is often used with HTMLElement.focus().\n\nI think there is right logic, if we want to use both \"autofocus\" and \"autoselect\".... >In this case it should be..\nYes, it makes sense.\n\ninput.autofocus()\n\nProbably you meant input.focus() ? \nAlso can change type of props \"autofocus\" to [String, Boolean], and check if it is equal to \"select\" or true.... So i suggest Line 3 replace to:\nautofocus: [String, Boolean],\nAnd after Line 72 add:\nif (this.autofocus === 'select') {\n  input.select()\n}. I think the whole block should look like this:\nif (this.autofocus && input) {\n  input.focus()\n  if (this.autofocus === 'select') {\n    input.select()\n  }\n}. Hmm... Not sure if it useful. When you working with mouse or tuch it does not matter...\nIt only matters when you work with the keyboard... And there everything is ok...\nBesides, double assignment this.enterKey = true when press Enter. This is really a very useful addition!. >when the value is set in parent.\nCan you explain more detail? I cannot reproduce it... Just wondering if #1282 fixes this problem?. Well, its clear ) But we can use target.value from input event? Then there will be a lot of redundant code and checks? I'll play around with this)\nI still think it is improperly to use a watcher for autocomplete.... ",

Can I apply RTL to a single slider dynamically? If so that might do what I need.\nBut that's not why i'm doing it.  The slider relates to the position of things on a diagram and from a UX perspective it makes more sense for the lower numbers to be on the right.\nIn more detail the slider relates to the number of boards on a tenpin bowling lane.  If you're right handed you count the boards from right to left, if you're left handed you count from left to right.\nSo based on this.handed being \"left\" or \"right\" I would change the direction of the slider..

I have checked it and it really works very smooth, both with the keyboard, the mouse and while switching between the two. Kudos for the auto-open also, I'm really glad that that has been implemented too. Great work, thanks!. Great work on this! I haven't looked at the code (I'm UX designer, FE development is new to me), looking forward to having this working though. \nHow I would expect it to work is quite similar to the q-search with autocomplete. However, with one small difference and there might be something strange with the QAutocomplete? \n\nThe QSelect gets focus: this triggers the popover to show (autocomplete only shows after searching, in this case the options are already known and can be shown right away after receiving focus)\n\n2a. Selecting an option in the popover (through clicking or through arrowUp/arrowDown and Enter): popover hides and field loses focus. The @selected can be used to trigger any other actions (such as setting the focus on another item)\n2b. The user clicks somewhere else (also if it is nothing) or uses tab: the QSelect loses focus. I would expect the popover to disappear. The autocomplete does that the same for clicking somewhere else. However, it doesnt for using tab to move to the next tabindexed item, in that case the popover stays open (until a search is started in another QSearch or the page scrolls). I don't know whether this is intended or a bug. I would expect (here and in the QAutocomplete): using tab moves to a next field and thus the QSelect loses focus and the popover is hidden. . I have selected some parts from your comment:\nW.r.t. 2a & 2b: all of this triggers the popover to hide. Physically focus go to the field so user can \"Tab\" to the next field. Because if the field lose focus the user will not be able navigate by \"Tab\". \nAh yes, it is indeed very important that the user can continue the tab from the place they were. However, I would say it depends on the interaction: if the user presses Esc: indeed: the field should stay active. If the users clicks randomly in the body: I would say then the field is not active anymore. The user might question if everything is working correctly if they click in nowhere and the focus is not lost. Also it might feel a bit 'trapped' to them: as if they have to input something there, even if they don't want to.\nThis was your original comment about, right, for which you were mostly looking for comments?\nThe other subject (of the auto-opening and how to close):\n1. But when QSelect field gets focus by press \"Tab\" on previous field then field only displayed as \"focused\" (Highlighted). In this way user can \"Tab\" to the next field.\nEven if the popover would show, the user could still tab to the next field, am I correct? Then, I'd say the popover could also show automatically when focus is gained through Tab, this saves the user from an extra step (pressing the Enter). On the other hand: the popover could obscure the next item. So I could definitely also understand no auto-open. (implementing a prop would definitely be an option too, of course)\nBut notice - in order to navigate by \"Tab\" popover need to be closed (by press \"Esc\" e.g.)\nTo make another behavior, need to move the search filter from popover to the field inline. (like in QAutocomplete e.g.)\nBut i'm not sure if this is correct (\"a la material\")\nHmm, this is important indeed. I would suggest that pressing tab should be enough to go to the next field: in that case it is similar to how the user works with the QAutocomplete. If a user presses Tab they would want to go to the next field. Maybe they wouldn't know about escape and thus continue with the mouse as soon as they meet something they would want to skip. I understand that you also have to take the extra time for moving the search filter to the field inline into account. I'm just giving my ideas on the subject :). \nI have tried searching for material guidelines for how to deal with tab-use, couldn't find much information (likely because on mobile, there is no tab). So I think it is left open for interpretation. \nLet's say a user has two optional fields, wants to set the first one and skip the next one:\nA: Tab, (auto-open), arrows, Enter (to choose), Tab (now on the second field, auto-open), Tab (5 actions)\nB: Tab, Enter (to open), arrows, Enter (to choose), Tab (now on the second field), Tab (6 actions)\nOption A (auto-open, perhaps as prop, & Tab can be used to move to the next field, even with the popover open) saves the user an extra action. Also it prevents hindrance for users familiar with using Tab but who don't use Escape as often. \nNote: Auto-opening while needing escape to close would be bothersome. Especially with multiple optional Qselects it would cause irritation.\nPS: and using the @selected on the field to focus the next field would save another action, in both cases :D. I know, these are all details, but I like make things as easy as possible, even the small actions.\nPPS: I searched, and for the QAutocomplete, there is already a bug report: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/951. Ah yes, your link makes it indeed very clear. Especially the select with filter is really nice, great addition! I'll be using it as soon as it becomes available. \n\n\nsomething I noted is that on the colored versions: it is not very clear whether they are in focus or not. (With me: nothing changes at all). Or perhaps this is something still left to do. \n\n\nThe tab key currently gives some unexpected behaviour when used within anything with checkboxes or radio buttons: to reproduce: click on for example the multiple selection, press tab a few times, then Enter. It seems that the images of the checkbox/radio button are also part of the tabindex. However, this gives confusing behaviour to what is the currently selected item: the one with the arrows or the one with Tab.\n\n\nI found myself using Tab a few times with an open popover, to switch to the next field (also without thinking). However, the Tab then doesn't always go to a logical place (sometimes for instance to the secure connection icon in the addressbar). I think that using the tab to move to a next field would fit the users mental flow: I fill this in, go to the next one, skip this: I'll go to the next one. First having to close the popover would be okay looking at it from the code: you have opened something and first need to close it (as with brackets etc.). Most users are not that literal, I think they would think: I just want to go the next one and they'll expect the popover to close automatically when that field is not active anymore. I think to them, the field and the popover would be one element (in their mental model), not two separate entities. Especially on PC/laptop. On a smartphone, if the select menu would be a menu on top of everything else, and everything else faded out, then it is more clear that you first need to close it. In that case you wouldn't use a Tab key anyway. And for PC/laptop pages, the popover is not a fullscreen, everything else fades out, type of menu (nor do I think it should be). It is an element in a larger page. I hope I am clear with what I mean :). Just my 2 cents, trying ot help find what would be ideal. I think in any way there are very nice improvements!. > select with filter is really nice, great addition\n\nIt is not my addition, actually this feature already implemented in current release e.g. (0.14.7)\n\n\n\nAh yes, I noticed now, oops. Well, thanks for making me notice it then :)\n\non the colored versions: it is not very clear whether they are in focus or not\nYes it is. This happens when \"inverted\" option is set on QSelect. This is native behavior and can be solved by custom css.\n\nAh ok\u00e9. I would suggest having something preset, perhaps to give them the same appearance as the QButtons. That way the out of the box functionality will also be clear. \n\nIt seems that the images of the checkbox/radio button are also part of the tabindex\n\u0421heckbox/radio are focusable (have a tabindex). This can be fixed by adding to them props \"tabindex\" with value \"-1\". This should be done in the QSelect component itself. I'll try what can be done...\nGreat :). I wish I could help more with creating it also, at the moment I'm still learning to use Vue/Quasar, I think I would make a bit of a mess out of it. \nHowever, the Tab then doesn't always go to a logical place\nOf course) Because at this time the focus is on popover which physically located at the bottom of the document (at the end of DOM). I repeat myself: To make another behavior, need to move the search filter from popover to the field inline. (like in QAutocomplete e.g.) But i'm not sure that @rstoenescu will approve this. As an option, may be to add a property such as \"inline-filter\" or somthing like this...\n\nAh now I understand better why that happens. Yes, perhaps @rstoenescu could add his ideas and opinions :)\n. ",

    "Surenapetrosyan": "@rstoenescu q-datetime still sends an event for  @change and @input when switching months. Is this a known issue? The datepicker should only send events when a user actually selects a new date.. @rstoenescu Thanks, I implemented the lazy input. Now it's behaving correctly and only emits change when a user clicks away, but there is a usability issue. \nFor example when a user has 4/10/2018 selected and opens up the date picker, they switch the month to  May, the 10 is still highlighted as if the user has selected 5/10/2018. If the user clicks out of the datepicker   the new date is selected. \nHow it should be: The user has 4/10/2018 selected and opens the date picker. They switch the month to May, the 10 is not highlighted because the user has not selected 5/10/2018, they still have selected 4/10/2018 so the 10 in 5/10/2018 should not be highlighted. . ",

The meteor starter kit shows the bug, can you simply install according to the README and take a look?\nYou would need to debug quasar.common.js, which is produced from the transpile command.\nPlease also note that I added class=\"fixed-bottom\" to the footer in an effort to get it all to work. So that may need removal\n. There's an invisible div in the header:\n<div class=\"absolute-top-left transition-0\" style=\"width: 100000px; height: 100000px;\"></div>\n@rstoenescu If there's any way I can help to get to the bottom of this, please let me know. Though right now I have to get some sleep.\nHowever I would think you just need to take a look at AppLayout.vue in the Meteor starter kit, which was basically copied from the q-layout documentation. Thanks.. @rstoenescu Thank you for your work on this.\nThis is presumably happening because I do a dynamic import of the css, based on whether it's IOS or Android. \n```\n    if(Meteor.isCordova){\n    if(cordova.platformId == 'android'){\n        //dynamic import\n        import('/node_modules/quasar-framework/dist/quasar.mat.css');\n    }\n    else if(cordova.platformId == 'ios'){\n        import('/node_modules/quasar-framework/dist/quasar.ios.css');\n    }\n\n}else{\n    //default dynamic import\n    import('/node_modules/quasar-framework/dist/quasar.mat.css');\n\n}\n\n```\nIt seems like a lot of work for you to correct this, considering that I only got v0.14.7 working with Meteor a week ago, so there can't be that many people using it. \nFor the moment I can also try going back to the 'require' syntax I was using before, instead of the dynamic imports.\nSo I'll try to solve this based on the information you've given me, and wait for v0.15. \nIf all else fails, I can add a message anyway to the Starter Kit about the problem, because I presume that v15.0 can't be too far away.\n\nOn another note, Meteor is still working on removing the need for a commonjs version, hopefully soon I can avoid transpiling Quasar from es6.\n. @rstoenescu \n\nIf I substitute the dynamic imports with require it all works with 0.14.7.\nIf I install 0.14.8, then I can use the dynamic imports, which is a good result.\nThanks for the pointer about the absolute paths for the links. I've corrected them and I'll be working on those in the future as well to try and remove them.\n\nThanks again for your wonderful work.\n. @rstoenescu I can't get the umd version working in a browser to produce a simple example. Crazy but true. This is a limitation of mine, not yours.\nI'm not worried about desktop for my purposes so I'll just close this. Thanks for now.. P.S.\nI did a lot of gardening at the weekend and cleared the brain of overwork.\nQResizeObserver is of course fine.\nI needed to watch the parent component, not the one I was watching.\n. ",

    "rossity": "@realcarbonneau @rstoenescu can we revert this change? or at least disable the console message in production? I have components that conditionally need to be either rendered normally or as modals and as such I use q-modal-layout as my template wrapper.. Totally understand! Would love an option to silence it somehow though :)\nIf not I can find a way to work around it. Thanks!. Found this 5 minutes ago and came to see if anyone reported it :D\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/hesu7sbx/1/\nIf you \"set\" anything like a new day/hour/etc. and then click cancel it still sets the model info. Also \"change\" events are being fired just when changing anything in the component as opposed to only after clicking the \"Set\" button.\nUpdate: the @change event is actually being fired by QDateTimePicker instead of QDateTime, so I'm not actually able to call any methods on @change\nUpdate 2: the @input event is being fired twice upon setting, once upon cancelling (when a time is already set). @rstoenescu I see, thank you very much for the clarification! I think in order for the component to have the desired action then, I would need it to have its @dragend event back. Is there any reason it was taken out?. I see what you mean, but let me clarify (I may still not be doing it correctly)\nUsing your example, since the component doesn't have a v model associated with it, the number on the Q knob only updates after you stop dragging.\nI'd like the \"value\" to update as the user is dragging the Knob, so they know what number they're stopping on, but I need to post to an API once they've stopped dragging.\nIf I listen for @change, the model doesn't update and the user doesn't know what number they're on until after they let go. If I listen for @input, it would send an API post request every time they drag the knob another step. I think listening for @dragend is a compromise between the two and would allow me to use a v-model on Q-Knob and essentially still allow lazy loading.. On mobile so I can't edit, but I'm going to use the code in your comment when I get back to desktop as that may solve my issue!. Yes, forgot to mention the above. The QEditor continues to visually update, but no longer emits an input event and as such the model is never again updated.. No whoops, that was a mistype!. Also, I'm essentially reporting that a fresh install of Quasar is completely broken on Chrome 41 by just choosing \"yes\" on ESLint when you quasar init. @rstoenescu @pdanpdan  does this fix also address #1903 ?. @pdanpdan I hooked up mobile debugger and no console logs/errors pop up at all after QEditor model stops updating. Lots of use cases, for instance buttons! \ninstead of \n<q-btn icon=\"plus\" class=\"lt-md\" @click=\"method()\"/>\n<q-btn icon=\"plus\" class=\"gt-sm\" size=\"lg\" @click=\"method()\" />\nyou can just render a single button\n<q-btn icon=\"plus\" :size=\"$q.screen.gt.sm ? 'lg' : 'md'\" @click=\"method()\" />. Here's the one that affected me, inside a QModal\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/qYVXJL. QField around QEditor works for me, can you provide some code?. @nothingismagick I may not have explained the request correctly and updated the post using the first link you provided.\n@pdanpdan I'll try that out thank you. Hmm, then what about markdown? Even if there were just simple tags.\njavascript\nthis.$q.dialog({\n  title: 'Destroy everything',\n  message: {\n    body: `Are you sure you want to destroy everything?\n      This is super dangerous and **_cannot be undone._**`,\n    asMarkdown: true\n  }\n})\nIt would also preserve return lines. Would that be too large of a scope?. @olegvakulenko thanks for the link! great info.\nAnd will do @nothingismagick.\n. Yep! And I've already implemented it in my project. I'm mainly posting here as I think it's an idea worth considering for the main framework so others don't have to do the same.\nRight now the step only turns danger if their are errors, which is great, but there should be a way to change the step color if it's completed or active too. It just makes sense because you can already change the icon for those states.\nI'll submit a PR when I can get to it, I posted it here for now so I can get it out of my head and written down somewhere.. Okay so it's recommended in this case to just override the icon in the plugin instantiation, for example:\n```javascript\nimport '@fortawesome/fontawesome-pro-webfonts/css/fontawesome.css'\nimport '@fortawesome/fontawesome-pro-webfonts/css/fa-solid.css'\nimport '@fortawesome/fontawesome-pro-webfonts/css/fa-light.css'\nexport default ({ Vue }) => {\n  Vue.prototype.$q.icon.chip.close = 'fas fa-times-circle'\n}\n```.

But I personally don't like being forced to use an opinionated structure, especially we have other community-supported project like Nuxt and Cordova. I might be wrong with this and YMMV. You should try this first and see if it suit you well.\n\n\nUse Quasar + Nuxt\nIt is stated in Quasar's offical Roadmap that they will release a Quasar + Nuxt starter kit in Quasar v1.0. The release date is still TBA but I'm really looking forward.\n\n\nUse Nuxt + UMD Quasar + Cordova\nI haven't tried this but there are some tutorials out there, e.g. this one. You have to configure Webpack and Cordova, but Cordova Plugin might be a problem.\n\n\nNuxt generate + (any Vue UMD) + Cordova\nIts like the above method, but with Nuxt generate command. This one also seems viable, but Cordova Plugin might also be a problem. Japanese article but the codes are in English\n\n\nNuxt + (any Vue UMD) + PWA\nThis is not really a hybrid mobile App, its PWA. But considering how iOS finally started to work on PWA, I actually think this is not a bad way to go.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/1334 (Edit)\n\n\nhttps://www.webfacts.jp/nuxt-js-web-cordova-build (Edit)\n\n\nPersonally I would start with Nuxt PWA and use UMD Quasar, then jump to Quasar+Nuxt when Quasar v1.0 released. Or substitute Quasar with other framework if it doesn't suit my project well.\nI might dive into this again 2 or 3 weeks later. Hope this help.\n. ",

I went back and checked on the latest version 0.16.4.   Seems width and a position its still slightly off compared to chrome.   I'm seeing same positioning issue in quasar-play and custom apps.\n\n\nThis is on Win7 ie11.0.96.\n. Hi,\nI've been testing the dev branch and the new fixPagination code you added :\nif (p.rowsPerPage !== void 0 && p.rowsPerPage < 1) {\n    p.rowsPerPage = 5\n  }\nCauses the \"All\" rowsPerPage to be set back to 5 rows per page instead.  Option All = 0 as you know...\n. I could try, never done a PR before :)   Not sure how long it will take me to read up on how to proceed...\nOne issue with me doing this is I do not have a cordova testing environment and don't know how it would affect that section of the open-url.js code.  Does cordova even use router hash mode?\n. @pdanpdan \nI've currently worked around the issue for my project but I'd be happy to make the adjustment I've suggested if you want me to proceed.\nBefore I create a PR, could you tell me if I should include Cordova in the router hash adjustments?  I do not have a way to test it nor understand  how it uses history.\nThanks. RFC for upload spec can be found at:\nhttps://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt\nThere is no reference to a global content-type field as quasar 15.10 is currently forcing.  \nA description of a standard upload:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type\nYou can see a standard format upload that is NOT including a separated content-type field.\nIf you debug at any standard html page that generates an upload to a server, it does not generate this field.\nI can give you a set of testing results showing the difference between an upload using standard html and quasar uploader.  The only difference is the hard-coded content-type field.\nReference another user having same issue:\nhttp://forum.quasar-framework.org/topic/455/hardcoded-form-data-in-uploader\nNote: In oracle web services, you cannot have a incoming field with a hyphen in it. \nI would expect q-uploader to replicate standard html upload results.   I am confused as to why you think a global content-type field is \"normal\".   There is no indication anywhere I can find that this is a standard field for uploads.   Normally all content-type field parameters are encased in the file field itself.   It sounds like your assuming each file upload is individual which actually isn't normal....  \nFYI:\nAnother main difference between q-uploader and standard html is that multiple files are normally sent in a single upload using an array of file items.  While I don't need this now, I was considering making another PR later to adjust multiple with a new prop for \"batch\" or \"individual\" upload mode.\nThanks :smile: \n. I'm really new to GIT Pull requests.  Is there anything else I need to do to have this merged into the master code tree?   Was hoping it would be in the last release :)  \nAlso, should i git rebase this branch for the new dev release?  There currently are no conflicts.\n. @rstoenescu Any chance this could be merged into to the next release?   \nIf not, could you let me know what changes you would like instead to allow this hard-coded field to be turned off.\nThanks!. Yea, I don't know what changed, but the tool tip is now disappearing now.     \nWhich is weird since it was happening in my code and the codepen consistently last week...\n. Specific column inline editing can already be achieved using the Q-TD slot component.   It even works with vuelidate if coded properly.\nWhile having it already in data table component would be convenient,   I'd hate to see it bulk up the control for basic table layouts.\nI use something like:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n. I guessed window size was the issue,  though there is no way the printout is going into that small of a width... \nHow about adding a print-always css class then?  That way we can hide and force what elements are printed regardless of screen size.\n. Understood, was just suggesting adding the missing piece to your already created printer related CSS classes.\nI've already fixed my code to deal with this using my own print-always class:\n@media print {\n        .print-always {\n          display: block !important;\n        }\n      }\n. To make changes to the framework its best to just fork and have a local repository.  After the framework compile, copy the dist folder to the node_modules folder of the project your working on and restart dev/compile.   Seems the quasar-cli uses the dist folder instead of the src for dev/compile for speed which makes sense.\nI have not quite figured out how to get \"quasar dev\" mode to use another fork for testing yet.   If anyone can explain that process, testing would be soooo much faster!\nThanks. @rstoenescu \nI get what your saying.  However if I have a full application I'd like test adjustments to the framework on is there a way to point that apps quasar-framework to a specific fork I've built?   Maybe extendWebpack or chainWebpack re-configuration?\nI think this is what @nothingismagick  quasar-dev-seed purpose is....   Which would be useful if I wasn't stuck in windows :)  \nThanks guys,  I really appreciate your hard work in making this a fantastic vue framework.  Its been a real challenge for me to learn SPA/GIT/npm/webpack/etc/etc.  I'm a very old school oracle programmer and this is a VERY deep hole I've jumped in  :)\n. This is in the current framework, not sure what version your running though:\nhttps://quasar-framework.org/components/datatable.html#Pagination\n. Yes, not intuitive behavior IMO, but your submitting a single input via enter.  \nIf it was blur'd from another button or field before submit it would update correctly.   The stranger part is that this isn't a issue in \"text\" type inputs, only number.  Must be something in the number validation code on q-input.\nAs a work around  for a single input submit try changing it to:\n    \n. ",

    "sandrotaje": "Another workaround could be use entire object as value, in suggestion list, and then on the input use value and @input (that is equivalent to v-model) and in the value attribute use the property that you want to use as a label and in the event assign the entire object\nhtml\n<q-input type=\"text\" :value=\"object.whatYouWantAsLabelProperty\" @input=\"object = $event\">\n  <q-autocomplete @search=\"search\"/>\n</q-input>\nPay attention because if the user doesn't click on a suggestion the $event variable is a string and not an object. So you have to check if $event is a string or the value of the suggestion:\nhtml\n<q-input type=\"text\" :value=\"object.whatYouWantAsLabelProperty\" @input=\"onInput($event)\">\n  <q-autocomplete @search=\"search\"/>\n</q-input>\n``` javascript\nonInput(val) {\n  if (!val.id) { // check an unique property or if val is an object\n    this.object = {\n      whatYouWantAsLabelProperty: val\n    };\n  } else {\n    this.object = val;\n  }\n}\n\n```\nSimilar to this approach is to use a computed property with getter and setter.\n. Yes, for sure, but if you are inside a loop, is more convenient, in my opinion, to open in this way. \nBecause, in a loop, you have to use a internal variable to set the selected thing to pass inside the modal and that manage the return from the modal( if for example in the modal you modify something) and is easier in this way..

    "erkinsergey": "No, not at all. I'm talking about that every page in mobile Chrome, even empty, scrolls to the height of the address bar of the browser. In mobile Firefox, a blank page does not scroll and takes up all the remaining space. I just want the page to always adjust in height and not scroll.. I'm doing a mapping application with a header and footer, which will be used even on mobile devices. In desktop browsers (Chromuim, Firefox), in adaptive and normal modes and mobile Firefox, everything works correctly. But in a mobile Chrome, the map scrolls to the height of the address line. In previous versions of the framework (0.12, 0.13), which I used at the beginning everything was fine and there was no such effect. The effect occurred after the update and, as I found out, is associated with the min-height: 100vh styles.\nI do not know if this is a flaw in the framework, or maybe I'm doing something wrong.. Thanks for the answer. \nYes, a polyfill or at least an example of code would be very good! \n. I updated the framework to version 0.17.05 and used the style-fn property for default project with header, drawer and Quasar logo image.\nMy desired result - the lack of scrolling in the mobile Chrome I managed to achieve only in the following way:\n<html class=\"fit\">\n...\n<body class=\"fit\" style=\"min-height: auto !important;\">\n<div id=\"q-app\" class=\"fit\" style=\"height:100%;\"></div>\n...\n<q-layout view=\"lHh Lpr lFf\" class=\"fit\" style=\"min-height:auto !important\">\n...\n<q-page class=\"flex flex-center fit\" :style-fn=\"myTweak\">\nexport default {\nname: \"PageIndex\",\nmethods: {\nmyTweak (offset) {\n// any value other than\nreturn { minHeight: '100vh' }\n// for example:\n//return { minHeight: 'auto !important' }\n// return { minHeight: 'calc(100vh - ${offset}px)' }\n}\n}\n}\nThat is, it should not return a function style-fn { minHeight: '100vh' } and can even be empty.\nAs I understand it, the style-fn property applies only to q-page and does not affect the parent containers.. Thank you for three back dashes, I did not know. :+1: \nI tried the example. Unfortunately this does not work as I should. \nI do not know how to explain ...\nMethod:\nmyTweak (offset) {\n    return { minHeight: `${window.innerHeight - offset}px` }\n}\naffects the container main:\n<main class=\"q-layout-page flex flex-center\" style=\"min-height: 536px;\"><img alt=\"Quasar logo\" src=\"img/quasar-logo-full.svg\"></main>\nit really works.\nBut this does not affect body, for which:\nbody {\n...   \n min-height: 100vh;\n...\nfrom qusar.mat.styl\nAgain, to get the desired effect, I need to override the min-height: 100vh styles for all the parent containers.\nPerhaps, to place an example on the test hosting that it was more comprehensible?. Thanks for the instructions!\nBut not\nonResize (size) \n{\n   $store.state.windowSize = size\n},\nbut\n// mutations.js\nexport function setWindowSize (state, newWindowSize) {\n  state.windowSize = newWindowSize;\n}\n// App.vue\nonResize (size)\n{\n  $store.commit('store_name/setWindowSize', size);\n},\nfor reactivity and dynamic change.\nOtherwise, everything really works!\nP.S.

The only way to completely get rid of intermediate state is by setting the v-model date to equal to true-value or false-value. But I would like to get rid of the intermediate state while having a null v-model value in data. Or at least ability to control the toggle order.. ",

I'm curious as to what the correct solution is for this.\nBut in any case, it seems that QSelect under the hood uses the <q-popover /> component.

I had a similar situation where I wanted to add some additional customization to the items in the dropdown. However, the q-popover is rendered outside of the immediate component and directly rendered in the <body> so I didn't see where I could add a custom css class to customize the contents of the <q-popover> from a <q-select>. \n.

This issue was closed because a style property was added to the column definition and the new property would allow specifying a column width.\nDo I have to do something else to make column widths work?\n. If so, then the Issue should not have been closed. I think the QTable should provide a configuration option where the developer can specify the column widths as the current default does not do a very good job. \nThis is a commonly asked for feature and will be the source of many questions going forward especially now that there is a mention of \"width\" in the column docs.. I appreciate the help. My css skills are basic which is why I'm using Quasar. I've built quite of lot of functionality without needing one line of css. QTable has been the only exception.\nAnd as I said, I think column widths should be part of the component like many of the other configuration options for QTable. A simple example is the \"align\" property for the column. Why have the property? Just make the user write css. I think you will agree its much simpler for the developer to set the align property rather deal with css. It should work the same for column widths. \nI'm pretty sure anyone using QTables for web apps will have an issue with column widths. Why make it harder than it needs to be?\nBut hey, I've got the css stuff to work so I can move on. But again, this issue won't go away. Other developers will have the same questions. In fact they already have. Its in the forum. I know because I looked there before creating this issue. .

    "sustained": "+1 for some form of inline editing support.\nVuetify, for instance, includes it in their data table implementation.. First, let me thank you for taking the time to implement the feature.\nI too was hoping for a true inline solution, personally but ideally wouldn't it be best if both methods were supported?\nEspecially if the Material design spec does in fact allow actual inline editing as well, as @kerbo says it does.\nI'm going to take a stab at implementing true inline editing myself because I personally really need it and don't particularly care if I'd be breaking away from the Material design spec (but I understand if you want Quasar to follow the spec to the letter).\nI'm not sure if I'll even be able to figure it out myself (pretty new to Vue and Quasar) but I'll try anyway. If a PR wouldn't be accepted, I'll still post here if I get a solid implementation working in case anyone finds this and wants to use it.. The way I see it, the options for true inline editing are as follows:\nOption 1: Show the inputs for the entire row, on row hover:\n\nOption 2: Show the inputs for the entire row, after clicking an edit button:\n\nOption 2b: Show the input for a single cell, after clicking an edit button:\n\nOption 3: Show the input for a single cell, upon clicking on the text within the cell:\n\nI'm going to explore these methods (which were mostly taken from here) as I don't personally care about adhering strictly to the guidelines, for my project.\nI am making an app similar in some ways to Memrise (see option 3) and I want this feature more than I want to be classed as 100% Material design.\nBut perhaps one of more of these would fall within the guidelines?\nEDIT: I have taken a look at the Material design specification and as far as I can tell option 2, at a minimum, would be perfectly acceptable?. True, fair points!\nWell, I'm going to attempt to create components for the various use cases above and I'll add them to quasar-awesome (and link them there) if and when I figure it out.

Since the new approach is going to stay, I am trying to make my own date-input component that retains the look of an input with a dropdown arrow.\nHere's my component so far:\n```vue\n\n\n<!-- Clear button -->\n<q-btn\n  slot=\"append\"\n  v-if=\"clearable && value\"\n  flat\n  round\n  @click.stop=\"$emit('input', null)\">\n  <ap-icon name=\"close\" />\n</q-btn>\n<q-icon slot=\"append\" name=\"arrow_drop_down\" />\n\n<!-- Popup -->\n<q-popup-proxy ref=\"popup\">\n  <q-date\n    :value=\"value\"\n    @input=\"$emit('input', $event)\"\n  />\n</q-popup-proxy>\n\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    value: {\n      required: true\n    },\n    clearable: Boolean\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    open (evemt) {\n      event.preventDefault()\n\n      this.$refs.popup.show()\n    },\n\n    onKeyDown (event) {\n      if (event.key !== 'Tab') event.preventDefault()\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\nAnd the usage:\nvue\n<my-date-input\n  label=\"Date\"\n  clearable\n  v-model=\"date\"\n/>\n(It's a work in progress, it's still missing proxy props for QDate)\nThe major issue is that after closing the picker, the input gets the focus (hence the keydown method that blocks everything except the Tab key). On mobile devices, it triggers the virtual keyboard.\nAnother one is that I don't know how to display the value with a different format on the input. The old QDateTime had a useful displayValue prop to do this.\nHere's how it looks before picking a date:\n\nand after:\n\nSuggestions for improvements are welcome.. I rely a lot on QField on 0.17 for showing error messages below every form widget, and in general for having a consistent look.\nIs it really becoming a standalone component in 1.0? Because that will really help with the migration.\nAlso, since QInput and QSelect already implement QField, wouldn't be strange to mix them to custom QFields in a form?. @pdanpdan Yes! I was just answering my own question, but since I need a different behavior every time, I'm using it like this:\njavascript\nonCancel () {\n  this.$refs.modal.hide()\n  this.$refs.modal.$once('hide', () => {\n    ...\n  })\n}\nThanks.

Mainly with this specific statement written above.\nWhat the control is taking care of is to provide a cross-browser valid date without time zone, so you can extract later the part you need.\nHere is a single example:\nif the value we pass to the datepicker component is '2003-10-21T00:00:00.000+00:00' and the user's timezone is set to any timezone with a negative offset (I did this example having set my system time to New York) then the displayed value will be 2003/10/20 when the format is set to YYYY/MM/DD.\nIt looks like the component internals are taking this date string, running it through new Date(), that's getting passed through the quasar formatDate function and we end up with the date being displayed as a day earlier having taken the users system timezone offset has been subtracted.\n. The same thing will happen because when that string gets passed to new Date() the time will be set to 00:00 and if the user is in a negative offset timezone the date will be wrong.

It happens when you use a filter and start typing in that filter.\nFor example, if on opening it's above, and then by filtering the list becomes shorter, at some stage it's small enough to fit in below and jumps down therefore.

You're right, what I find confusing as a user about that behaviour is that especially for long lists the popup jumps from above to below and back.

handler every time it is clicked.. @sontis3 \nyep would be nice to do that, solution for now is add a unique ref on your q-popup-edit and pass it as argument in one of its events in your case on-save like so @save=\"UpdateDocument($event, $ref[myUniqueRef].initialValue, props.row). the $event is the new value, @save=\"UpdateDocument($ref[myUniqueRef], props.row) instead and process the ref's value / initialValue in the called method. I guess you can file a request for feature about this.. good to know there are other ways, i don't like ref way much, specially if it's from something out of a loop.. you can add it as a plugin https://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-plugins.html and maybe make a component for it or a Quploader wrapper component for your plugin.. give the div wrapper one of the inline style display, coz tooltip will display in the center of the page rather than the component.. @941477276 change event will only execute if you use a lazy model as stated in the docs. so don't use v-model in your case if you want to use @change. something like :value=\"yourModel\" @change=\"val => { yourModel = val}; <execute other methods here if you have any>\". @input will execute immediately as soon as model changes, that's the normal behavior.. > The goal is to have the same behavior on any close attempt via the escape key / clicking the background as you would get by clicking the close button (open the dialog and prompt rather than just canceling with no message). In theory I could add additional listeners for the escape key and maybe even figure out how to listen for the click on the background, but if there will be a beforeClose handler or the v-model will fully control the visibility in the future I'd rather just wait for that (or PR it to quasar myself) rather than building a workaround.\n\nI'll check out v1-work and see what the changes look like so far.\n\nYou can use @keyup.native.esc=\"checkIfSomethingChangedThenShowDialog\" and @click.native=\"checkIfSomethingChangedThenShowDialog\" in your q-modal to emulate same behavior as clicking cancel button in your modal when something has changed hence displaying the confirmation dialog.\nforking Scott's fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/tmxLewd7/4/. https://codesandbox.io/s/lx5oqq4p97. @natxocc \nnp, you can close the issue if it solves it..

    "louisameline": "@jigarzon please close this issue as it's a duplicate. Thank you for the fast answer. I was using maximized for the modal to always use 100% width of the screen, but I'll do that myself in css now. Thanks again!. At the time I'm writing this, it's clear in the docs that done(true) will stop the component. It's also clear that inline has to be used if your scroll container is not the window. I'm not sure what your issue is here, what are you requesting?. I can't see why it would load everything in one go. You control the ajax request, you should know how many items you load. Use console.log to understand how many calls to loadMore are done. I think there is no issue with the component here, you need to debug and come back with clearer details on what would be wrong.. You have to use inline when the scroll container is not the window. In other cases I'm not surprises to see \"weird\" behavior.. It seems to me that you need to close this issue and either spend more time debugging or ask for help in a forum. Issues here are for clear bug reports, which is unfortunately not the case here.. +1\nTrue that this component could be improved to support out of the box a predefined number of items and the number of items per batch loaded.\nI could make a PR for that maybe.. My use case may help you understand what the issue is.\nBy default, I have a thousand icons that can be scrolled.\nOutside of the scrollable, I also have a search field to help filter the icons. Whenever a search is made, the scrollable is basically emptied and filled again with only the matching icons. That's when I need to \"reset\" the infinite scroll.\nWhen I need to \"reset\", I ideally don't want to have to care if the scroll was stopped or not previously, I just know that I want to start over.\nI can't see what would be the point of only resetting the index if not to work again? But maybe you can see one.\nRight now my workaround is indeed to call reset and then resume, which is weird to me because I never called the stop method explicitly (only through the handler, so the component wasn't \"stopped\" in my mind). Thanks!\n. To elaborate on my thoughts, I realize that the stoppage in this component can actually mean two things:\n- If I call done with true as first parameter, it's \"Stop because there is no more content\"\n- If I call the stop method, it rather means \"Pause for a while until I ask you to resume\"\nNow, to the question \"If the component is stopped, should reset resume the activity?\"\nI would answer yes to that in both cases, even if it's more obvious in the first case. I see no point in resetting and not work again.\nGiven the wording, I also expected it to work that way, as \"reset\" means \"return to your initial state\", which is to be working.\nI hope it's clear :). Side note: I see that disable is a recent addition to the component. But the wording is misleading as the component is not really disabled, it's paused.\nI think disable should have the same effect as stop(), that is to say that the component unbinds its listeners and stays completely inert.\nI would personnaly either \n- rename disable into paused, or (my preferred choice)\n- augment the disable prop with the ability to unbind listeners. The prop could then be renamed stopped because it would be clear that it has the same effect as a call to stop(). @rstoenescu ? Ok for this 1-line PR? Thank you. I update this with the call to resume instead, you are free to accept or close it. Thank you. What's the recommended way to switch to v1 please? I can't find the info.. I'll definitely upgrade my project to v1, I'll wait for instructions then. Thank you.. ",

    "kipouras": "Hello @fansanelli,\nI've gone through the changes on the pull request. I've noticed that the buildDateVal() function verifies the date string based on reMySQLDateTimeStr regular expression. A date string with 6-digit microsecond precision is being accepted and returned as  a substring containing the first 25 characters (0,24). On a date string like 2018-10-30 09:41:32.123456 it returns a date with a 5-digit microsecond precision. That is 2018-10-30 09:41:32.12345. In order for older browsers and iOS devices to correctly use the dateUtils without getting the NaN value as a result, the date string should be 2018-10-30 09:41:32.123 (3-digit precision). To get that, the command creating the substring in the buildDateVal() function should be changed from d.substring(0, 24).replace(' ', 'T')   to   d.substring(0, 22).replace(' ', 'T'). \nI've changed the value on my local build from 24 to 22 and it seems to fix everything.

    "tmas": "Hey @smolinari,\nThanks for the answer. I did actually read the docs (pretty thoroughly) before posting. The problem I'm running into is that, while the modal does use this.$emit('input', value) to update the v-model, it also maintains an entirely separate copy of its state called showing. This means that when the parent changes the state the modal reacts properly, but the parent doesn't actually maintain full control over the state as it's supposed to.\nThe specific behavior I was trying to demonstrate with my JSFiddle is that, when the modal attempts to close itself, it calls this.$emit('input', false) (as it should). Rather than waiting for the parent to update the bound value, however, it also calls this.showing = false. The variable actually controlling the visibility is not value, but showing. Here's one example of the problem code from /src/mixins/model-toggle.js:\nthis.showing = false\n\nif (this.value === true) {\n\n    this.$emit('input', false)\n\n}\n\nMy real-world goal with all this is to have a modal with a form that allows users to edit data. I want to allow users to close the modal by clicking the backdrop or by hitting the escape key, but when they do that I want to check whether they have unsaved changes. If they do, I want to show a dialog warning them about the unsaved changes. If they click cancel, the modal should stay open to allow them to review/save their changes. If they click close, the modal should close.\nBeing able to do things like this relies on the modal never closing itself unless the parent actually updates the bound value, which I think is the most reasonable expected behavior for this feature since that's the whole mechanic for v-model.\nAlternatively, if there's a reason why showing has to be the actual variable controlling the visibility of the modal and not just a tracker to detect whether value has changed from the current displayed state, I could see an onClose or beforeClose handler filling the gap. I've seen example of this working in ElementUI - the way they handle it is by having the prop before-close on their dialog accept a function done, which is passed another function as its argument. Calling done inside the beforeClose handler is what causes the modal to actually close, so it allows the close to be essentially canceled based on some arbitrary logic.\nI considered just setting up a dev environment and committing changes, but I'm not familiar enough with the project as a whole to understand the repercussions of changing the model-toggle mixin's behavior. Even if somebody can just confirm that changing this behavior won't break something I'm not aware of, I'd be happy to put in the legwork to get it working.. Hey @smolinari,\nThanks for the answer.

That's definitely a lot closer to what I'm looking for. I think for now we're just going to disable other methods of closing the modal until we can get a real solution in place.

It'd be good to know if the exact functionality we're looking for is planned or if I should just figure out the dev environment for quasar and submit a PR.\nThanks!. The goal is to have the same behavior on any close attempt via the escape key / clicking the background as you would get by clicking the close button (open the dialog and prompt rather than just canceling with no message). In theory I could add additional listeners for the escape key and maybe even figure out how to listen for the click on the background, but if there will be a beforeClose handler or the v-model will fully control the visibility in the future I'd rather just wait for that (or PR it to quasar myself) rather than building a workaround.\nI'll check out v1-work and see what the changes look like so far..

I take as example VS code (which is electron based), there is a menu in the bar, an icon, 2 spaces, a title and buttons (min max close). Most people expect the drag event to be at least accessible on either space and title. Which .q-bar > * will make title undraggable. That's why I suggested a class, since you could apply the class to the title also and it'll works nice.\nIf like Razvan suggested, it would be a prop of QBar, then the wildcard child element would be a bit too much.
