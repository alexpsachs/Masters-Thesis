However, it seems to be a very recently introduced code and this problem somehow did remain undetected.\n. Also make sure that you did apply the timeout patch: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=timeout_patch\n. Yes, this is correct. The link is currently not correct (I think this problem was introduced because deps.sh was moved to /tools/ right before the source was released and the link somehow was not updated at all).\nPlease merge\n. Wait, is this a specific hash format ? I.e. is this a request for a generic sha1 ($salt . sha1 ($pass)) implementation or a request for a very specific hash algorithm used for a cms/forum etc?\nIf this is a request for a specific hash algorithm, what are the details about the limitations and input format etc ? min/max password length, min/max salt length, hash format used etc would be interesting for a specific cms/forum algorithm.\n. Are you sure this is related to md5 at all (the title says \"Md5 optimization\")?\nEven if just the title is wrong and it is all about SHA1, how did you test the speed gains? Did you benchmark it? (I know the optimization is by Jens aka atom, yeah this project leader!).\nOne of the main problems could be register pressure etc. Implementing optimizations only make sense if it leads to a general speedup. Not all optimizations work on all platforms (e.g. cpu/gpu). Do you have some benchmarking numbers?\n. Note: there was a request on the old (now obsolete and offlice) trac ticketing system of hashcat.net for exactly this algorithm: \"Would like to see support for PGP/GPG\"\none comment (by ryabkov) was:\n\"Some extra info about PGP WDE - SHA iterated up to 16000 with salt then decrypt with AES/CAST and check 8 byte\nmore details in source - \u200bsymantec - PGP (pgpSDAValidatePassphrase function)\nP.S. PGPZip may be also uses the same\"\nThe original reporter (OP), system32, said \"I know Passware has some support and [so] also jtr (through gpg2john).\"\n(This was just additional info from old trac, not sure if it helps)\n. I think we can close this ticket since both of these types of hashes can already be natively loaded:\nfor -m 1000\n$ cat 1000_3000.hash \nLabAccount:1012:299bd128c1101fd615c5627ce31416b2:d311c413a01dffad3ffd6f57bfe271d7:::\n$ ./hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 1000_3000.hash hashcat2014\nd311c413a01dffad3ffd6f57bfe271d7:hashcat2014\nfor -m 3000\n$ cat 1000_3000.hash \nLabAccount:1012:299bd128c1101fd615c5627ce31416b2:d311c413a01dffad3ffd6f57bfe271d7:::\n$ cat dict.xt\nHASHCAT2014\n$ ./hashcat -m 3000 1000_3000.hash dict.txt\n299bd128c1101fd6:HASHCAT\n15c5627ce31416b2:2014\nfor -m 5500\n$ ./hashcat -m 5500 -a 3 'test::LAB:76365E2D142B5612CD10E1B93D342334E8FD283ECD7B9170:8614B8A84404B1C0333C8875A22BC10690BBF6A7EDCF549D:1122334455667788' Password1\ntest::LAB:76365e2d142b5612cd10e1b93d342334e8fd283ecd7b9170:8614b8a84404b1c0333c8875a22bc10690bbf6a7edcf549d:1122334455667788:Password1\nThere is nothing that needs to be converted or changed, the formats are already detected by hashcat and can be cracked AS-IS.\nIs there anything missing here? Can we close this issue?. I had a further look @ NETLM and tried to understand how this related to the hashes/features requested within this issue (that was imported by me from the old trac).\nI came to the conclusion that the examples and description within the trac issue do not really correspond to the title of this issue, i.e. the description and examples are all about LM and NetNTLM which hashcat already support.\nNETLM instead is something that hashcat currently does not support. There are two versions:\n1. NETLM: LM Challenge/Response (see jtr code: https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/8bcaddef35f703c47367fad612e473061459b156/src/NETLM_fmt_plug.c)\n2. NETLMv2: LMv2 Challenge/Response (see jtr code: https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/8bcaddef35f703c47367fad612e473061459b156/src/NETLMv2_fmt_plug.c)\nSo my conclusion is that NETLM and NETLMv2 are different algorithms which hashcat currently does not support, but since the example and description within this issue is all about LM and NETNTLMv2, I would say we close this issue for now.\nIf somebody wants to requests NETLM and NETLMv2 in the future within a new github issue, she should also provide some examples of NETLM/NETLMv2 and example code (like the one from jtr).\nThanks. I would suggest that we close this issue.\nThere was no answer given by the OP for more than 1 year and 1/2.\n... or is there anybody knows if this is a common hashing scheme?\n. Attachment added on old trac ticketing system by initnull\n. Can anybody please provide some example hashes and detailed information about the scheme used? We need more info to implement this.\n. I would like to suggest that we close this ticket because in my opinion there is no clear benefit of switching the 2 MAC addresses. If anything, we could/should make it more clear in the wiki what the 2 MAC addresses + SSID are.\nWhat do you think?\n. I close this ticket because:\n1. on trac we didn't get a respond (after atom's question -- see comment)\n2. it is working on a system with titan x and the exact same test\nPlease reopen if this is still a problem (and you have more details on how to reproduce etc).\n. you need to quote the hash if you use it on the command line, e.g. '$DCC2$10240#tom#e4e938d12fe5974dc42a90120bd9c90f'\nWe should close this ticket. This is pebcak\n. also please do not report any problems while using --force.\nAnybody has something against closing this ticket? (IMO this is of course not a oclHashcat problem, but a shell escape miss-understanding, because $DCC2 and $1 are interpreted as variables by your shell interpreter)\n. I changed the text within the FAQ section to:\n\"-a 1 \u2013 number of words of the larger word list out of the 2 word lists specified (left_wordlist, right_wordlist)\"\nI will close this issue, because now it should be very clear.\n. we need much more information here. like max/min salt length (if exists), max/min password length (if exists) etc\n. Note: the -d limit (was previously limited to the range 0-8) was removed with the newest git/beta version (2.10).\nMaybe we can kindly ask for instance @epixoip or anybody who can setup a system with at least 9 GPUs to test if this is still a problem? (I don't have a setup like this :( )\n\nIt could also have something to do with (lack of enough) main memory (RAM)... but this should be pretty easy to see (and idealy it should even result in an error).\n. Thank you very much for the notice.\nI'm sorry that I'm not able to say/pinpoint which changes/commits fixed this problem... There were too many changes we made from the opening of the original trac ticket till today.\nBut it shouldn't really matter (and if someone really needs to - and is able to - find the commit that fixed it, one could just checkout the different commits and see which \"versions\" are still affected and which aren't). The only thing that matters is that it is fixed and there is no more such (known) strange bug.\nThank you again for reporting the current state of this problem, this allows us to close this ticket (because it really wasn't that easy to test for me etc, with that many GPUs ;) )\n:)\n. We should close this, please reopen a new ticket if you think there is another problem.\n(BTW: I can't reproduce the 0 H/s problem, please make sure you have a clean directory - new download, no cached kernels and that your command line is okay, test just -m 2100 -b for instance. If this is still a problem, please open a new issue, because this seems to be unrelated here)\n. this looks good. Can be merged :)\nNote: it's just a different notation. compilers will optimize the memset () anyway. so this is just a nice code re-write (no changes in logic or performance).\n. this PR seems good. Can be merged.\nThanks\nbtw: @yhfudev please stick to the formatting rules (line breaks, indentation etc). It would be also great if you write just a little bit more what your (future) commits do and in this case for instance if it contains really every switch case that OpenCL defines (and where we can find the complete list - that e.g. you used as a reference - to double-check etc). This PR is great, but some more description and explanation about how complete it is would also be a PLUS. Thx again\n. wow, this is really a great find.\nThx matrix\nBut we need to fix it a little bit differently. The facts:\n-  given the example hash 7b5n74kq8r441blc2c5qbbat19baj79r:.lvdsiqfj.net:33164473:1 (from hashcat.net/wiki), we know that the digest/hash is 32 base32 chars\n- within the nsec3_parse_hash () function we convert (base32 decode) the human readable hash like this: base32_decode (itoa32_to_int, (const u8 ) hashbuf_pos, 32, tmp_buf);  (see https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/shared.c#L13950 )\n- the result are 20 bytes because 32 / 8 * 5 = 20 (we can see that the 20 bytes are copied here: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/shared.c#L13952)\n- this means, that our encode (the opposite of the decode in the parsing function) must convert 20 bytes to 32 human readable base32 chars\n- that means, the only problem within this line (the encoding within the ascii_digest () function): base32_encode (int_to_itoa32, (const u8 ) digest_buf, 32, (u8 *) digest_buf_c); (see https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/shared.c#L7116) is the number 32\n- we need to fix the value 32 to 20 (as input to the base32_encode () function ! (and not increase any buffer so it should stay char digest_buf_c[33]; because we want 32 + 1 additional byte for the NULL-byte\nIn other words, the fix should be as simple as this:\n-    base32_encode (int_to_itoa32, (const u8 *) digest_buf, 32, (u8 *) digest_buf_c);\n     +    base32_encode (int_to_itoa32, (const u8 *) digest_buf, 20, (u8 *) digest_buf_c);\n(within the hash_mode == 8300 section of the ascii_digest () function)\n@gm4tr1x could you please submit this change to this PR (just commit it to the same branch)\nThx (and again nice find ;) )\n. oh the extra 1 byte is for the padding character \"=\".\nThis is now okay to merge. thx\n. md5crypt uses the md5crypt_encode () and md5crypt_decode () functions\n. would it be okay if we just append the compile time to the version number information ?\nThere is a variable COMPTIME used within the Makefile for such purposes.\nWhy not git commit hash? Because somtimes (well, not that often, but rarely) it happens that betas will be compiled just for testing (even before every piece of new/changed code was committed) and therefore we do not know any git commit SHA1 hash at that time.\nOn the other hand, adding COMPTIME to the version number should be fine (in my opinion).\nWhat do you think ? @roycewilliams would that be okay?\n. @roo7break could you please provide the results of the --gpu-temp-disable test ? Does the crash also happen when ssh is not involved ? We need more information for this issue\n. We need an example of output to test what the problem really is.\n@anlx-sl can you please provide some lines of the file that showed you the error message ? (It's okay if you anonymize/mask it, as long as it is still of the same format and results in the same error).\nWithout any concret example it is difficult to guess what could be possibly going on here.\nThx\n. @anlx-sl we still need at least one sample to reproduce this problem. Unless we have a reproducible issue, we can't troubleshoot/fix this problem.\nCould you (@anlx-sl) please provide such an example \"hash\" file?\nThx\n. the output is utf-16 encoded. That means that for this particular file we have NULL-bytes every second byte and therefore several \"string functions\" don't work correctly (strlen etc) when we open/read it like we currently do (with utf-8 support).\nTo fix this problem, we need to add utf-16 file reading (and encoding detection) support... I'm not sure if this is really that important and common such that it is worth to add it.\nThe files also can easily be converted beforehand:\niconv -f utf-16 -t utf-8 FILE\nutf-16 encoded files start with the Byte Order Mark (BOM, 0xfffe) and the 4th byte is a NULL byte (if > 1 byte is needed), after that every second byte is a NULL-byte (if > 1 byte is needed to encode the character).\n. Can be merged!\n(BTW: it would be great if you @gm4tr1x update #63 (I guess we shouldn't close it yet) and mention the progress, what is currently not working yet e.g. --benchmark, for which algorithm the tests currently fail and also most importantly why you had to change some parts in this particular manner, e.g. why there is no --cpu-affinity etc. I mean, this are very critical changes and imply that we can't tell the users @ forum/irc that they can \"just use --cpu-affinity\" to just mention an example. We need some clues/documentation why it was changed like this and what is still missing).\nThx\n. @thesle3p could you please close the issue if you think this is not an issue anymore (because you fixed it with a clean install/download of deps)?\n. seems good, can be merged\n. can be merged, thx\n(Btw: some of these fixes only work because the mymalloc () function already calls memset () , these changes are just cosmetic, they shouldn't change any logic, performance etc... the compiler will always optimize these things, especially with the -O2 compiler option... so there should be no noticeable changes besides the optical ones for devs/contributors)\n. @gm4tr1x while you are trying to change this mymalloc () calls, let me suggest this fix too: here https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/oclHashcat.c#L10957 (user = (user_t ) malloc (sizeof (user_t));)  we have a call to just \"malloc ()\", we should probably call mymalloc here too... Can you fix that with a new pull request?\n. I don't understand what this --gpu-temp-disable change is trying to accomplish. The commit messages says something about OSX (\"Re-enable gpu-temp-disable argument for osx build\") but I don't see any OSX related changes (with #ifdef OSX or #ifndef OSX).\nWhen HAVE_HWMON is true, --gpu-temp-disable probably should be available, otherwise it should not be in the --help and not be available in general. I can't understand what this has to do with OSX.\nMaybe the problem is just that I only see \"No description provided.\" here and can't really figure out why it was changed the way it was... but without having more details and documentation of the reasons and goals of this change I can't understand and sign it.\n. this doesn't seem like a good solution for me, i.e. enabling the option just that the test.sh script runs without error and otherwise it shouldn't be used or if it is used it will be ignored.\nIt would make much more sense to either check within tools/test.sh if the option is available and only use it when it is available or, we need to discuss this, disable the option in test.sh completely.\nChanging it this way which is completely unlogical and which would suggest that --gpu-temp-disable would also be available for the OSX users and users that have HAVE_HWMON set to 0.\nIn general, it is much more important that the oclHashcat --help output and the options that the user can use are correct, than the tools/test.sh options (which only some devs will run).  Of course, both should be working and hence I suggest that we add --gpu-temp-disable in test.sh if and only if the binary allows that.\n. All I'm trying to say is that this makes no sense:\n```\n\"       --gpu-temp-disable            Disable temperature and fanspeed readings and triggers\",\nifdef HAVE_HWMON\n...\n```\nit should stay as it was:\n```\nifdef HAVE_HWMON\n\"       --gpu-temp-disable            Disable temperature and fanspeed readings and triggers\",\n...\n```\nwhy should --gpu-temp-disable be available when hardware monitoring was disabled?\nIf hardware monitoring was disabled, also --gpu-temp-disable should not be available (like it was before this strange changes).\n. > From that view it might make sense to add it back.\nNo. No. No.\nIt makes absolutely no sense to break the oclHashcat binary just that 2-3 devs can run tools/test.sh (which of course not every oclHashcat user uses 24/7) on OSX/without HWMON too. I don't support this idea to be that lazy and to not fix test.sh (instead) to use --gpu-temp-disable only when it is available... but instead break the binary with some very confusing changes that make no sense at all.\n. I still don't understand why @gm4tr1x  says HAVE_HWMON is directly related to OSX builds. The fact ist that users/maintainers can set HAVE_HWMON to 0 also on non-OSX builds. Therefore this is not a valid fix\nelif [ ${OPTARG} == \"osx\" ]; then\n+        OPTS=$(echo $OPTS | sed -e 's/--gpu-temp-disable //g')\nThe correct fix would check for the --gpu-temp-disable switch in the --help output for each platform (linux/windows/osx), as suggest previously here https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/pull/156#issuecomment-174543275\n. this commit is evil !\nLabeling a commit as \"cosmetic fix\", providing no description (\"No desciption provided.\" is the message of this pull request), but changing the restore file format in a very significant way such that it breaks --restore support of .restore files without updating the file format (https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=oclHashcat#parsing_the_restore-file ) and warning the user about the changes in docs/changes.txt ... is something we should not tolerate at all.\nMaybe it was \"just a mistake\", but as I said it broke a lot of things (analyze_hc_restore, some 3rd-party wrappers, the wiki documentation, ... etc.).\nI also had to troubleshoot/debug this a little bit until I figured out that the restore format was changed without any notice.\nCan you (@gm4tr1x) please explain how this could happen at all, what were the reasons for this significant change, why we really need it and most of all why you did change the restore file format without giving any meaningful explanation (or no explanation at all)?\nP.S. the change I am speaking about is  \"char cwd[256]\" -> \"char cwd[1024]\" of struct restore_data_t in types.h\nThx\n. It doesn't look like it works for me:\nstrace ./oclHashcat --keyspace -a 3 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a 2>&1 | egrep 'libamd|libOpenCL'\nAs far as I understood, there should be no requirement for loading those (and maybe other) libs when running with --keypace option. Your fix doesn't change this.\n. If I try without the libraries I get this error:\n./oclHashcat --keyspace -a 3 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a\n./oclHashcat: error while loading shared libraries: libOpenCL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nThis is what the issue #84 is trying to fix (in my opinion), i.e. using --keyspace also when the libraries are not present\n. the tool for calculating the --keyspace already exist in hashcat-utils: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/blob/master/src/keyspace.c\nBut again the goal that issue #84 should solve is to allow the user to run --keyspace without loading those libraries that are not needed to show the --keyspace value.\n. Of course! In my opinion the user specified parameter should not silently be ignored when incorrect/not allowed/available. Otherwise, this could lead to very strange problems/missunderstandings etc. \n. > it's difficult to extract password lists from hash:salt:pass lists when salt is not constant\n@d2-d2 did you try to use this? :\noclHashcat -m [HASHTYPE] --show --outfile-format 2 [HASHLIST]\n(note: the .pot file must exist of course)\n. it works also directly, i.e. without using --show, e.g:\noclHashcat -m [HASHTYPE] -a [ATTACKTYPE] -o [OUTFILE] --outfile-format 2 [HASHLIST] [DICT/MASK/MASKFILE]\nI think the multi-byte delimiter could still be a good idea in some very special cases (i.e. if the hash list already has some weird delimiters and the user doesn't want or isn't able to batch modify each line within the file)...\n. Thank you very much for reporting this issue and especially in this very clear and understandable format (even with \"working\" examples).\nPull request #259 should fix this problem, by increasing the max. salt length to 28 (55 - 22 - 1 - 4 as explained in #259).\nThis should be enough to fit even the longest usernames.\nThanks again\n\nBTW: just to be very clear about the limits: we have 2 limits here\n- salt + 22 + pass must be less than 55\n- salt itself must now be less than 29 (up to 28 - included - is supported)\n. so long story short, we should pull this fix because it could happen that in very, very, very rare cases it could happen that:\nnon-unique \"salts\" were falsely considered as unique and therefore only 1 of those hashes were successfully loaded and cracked\nCan you please provide an (anonymized) sample (at least 2 *.hccap files?) such that we can verify this issue and keep those files as a kind of documentation here (to justify this change)?\nThank you very much\n\nNow that I'm thinking about it, also the opposite could be true... i.e. that unique salts were not recognized as unique (but they were considered as 2 distinct \"salts\"), even if they should be marked as unique... Still some examples would be good (for maybe both of these cases).\n. hmm, the pull request was already merged ... but what I asked you (@gpuhash) here https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/pull/237#issuecomment-188227146 is still valid. Can you please provide some more information + samples such that we have some docs ?\nThx\n. I think I understood the problem you are describing above, but in your case if you want to just get the information on when exactly the mask changed etc it should be enough to just read/parse the oclHashcat.log file (or monitor it the same way you monitor the --status output).\nI'm not sure if it makes sense to print the mask/dictionary each and every time when the status timer (--status-timer) triggers and showing the change only when there was a change makes the format of the --status output much less easier to parse.\nOn the other hand, we probably shouldn't make too many changes in the output of --status-automat because some 3rd-party wrappers already use it heavily and changing it may break their parser. (of course when we really thing we need to change the format, we definitely should do so AND document it appropriately).\nI think the .log file is exactly what you are looking for, it tells you when exactly there was a change in mask/dict etc. The format of the .log file is also more appropriate for this kind of information, the status-automat is more or less just about the current speed/number of cracks etc.\nDo you think this (.log file reading/parsing/monitoring) works for you?\nThx\n. @AntonKuzminRussia Can you please close this issue if the solution with the (already available) .log file feature is working for you?\nThx \n. For your interest, I posted some POC perl code here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6405-post-34457.html#pid34457 .\nIt would help a lot if some users can test my POC (because there was some other user claiming with proof-of-concept code on that forum thread that AES steps are needed etc).. We for sure need some more information here:\n1. does the example hash crack for you (https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)\n2. there is no such commit \"55e339\", but there is this one (very similar but not the same SHA1 beginning):  https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/555e339\n3. if you mean the commit 555e339 I think it is very, very unlikely that it is the reason for this problem since it only touches kernels from -m 1100\n4. we need a full example on how to reproduce this: .hccap file, input wordlist/mask/mask file, the correct password, the full command that you've used, info about your setup (escpecially GPUs, nvidia / AMD...) and other relevant information\n5. please make sure that you have a clean build (no cached kernel files or obj etc), for instance under linux you might also need to remove ~/.nv/ etc\nBTW: I can't reproduce, the example hash works here\n. so you are saying that \"make DEBUG=2\" is working, but just \"make\" isn't. That's weird.\nCan you please test this again?\n. make DEBUG=2 should be \"equivalent\" to the Makefile that was used before 6636cc1 (with the additional debugging flags -g -ggdb).\nWell, you should be able to see the difference of the full gcc command on the command line. Maybe you can play a little bit with it and see which flag is responsible for failing to crack all hashes.\nWhat I mean is, when you run \"make\" you should see a/more \"gcc ....\" command(s). There should be a slight difference between what was set < 6636cc1 and the \"make\" of the master branch. Now, we need to find out, what (flag) is responsible for this problem.\nCan you test this?\n. First of all, this seems to be a different problem if you say that what you are experiencing now has nothing to do with commit 6636cc1 .\nSecondly, I don't think the way you are testing these problems is very clever, since you always mention this external pacman tool.\nWhat about the native build (without involving any external package manager etc) but instead just running \"make clean\", rm -rf ~/.nv/, \"make\" and \"./oclHashcat -m 2500...\" ?\n. Well, this is just a simple way to remove the binary file (actually /binary_file[.bin]) from the exec_path (which conists of path/binary_file[.bin]) such that the result is just the \"path\".\nYou can always debug this if you are not convinced before this line: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/oclHashcat.c#L5633, e.g. something like\nprintf (\"%s vs %s\\n\", install_dir, resolved_install_folder);\n. Note: since the format is \"{SSHA}\" . base64 ($hash . $salt) we cannot make the assumption that base64_decode ($hash . $salt) == 20.\nWe only can make the check that it must be at least of length 20, but since there could be non-zero length salt, we can't test if != 20.\nBtw: With the above patch, I introduced both checks PARSER_HASH_LENGTH and PARSER_SALT_LENGTH even if one would be for sure enough. Why the first one is enough ? The answer is, whenever the decoded length is at least 20, the salt is either 0 or longer (which is perfectly fine!). But to make it more clear that both conditions should be satisfied, I added both checks to be safe and easier/clearer to understand (the compiler, especially with -O2 flag, will notice this \"dependency\" of these two checks and do its best to make only one check and therefore optimize it for us). \n. Hmm, maybe we shouldn't just ignore it. But instead print a warning about what happened!\nLet me know if this makes sense and you think that would be much better.\n. https://github.com/philsmd/oclHashcat/commit/169905751649b48cc5c47e4b6d2f81ac15567f0f adds the suggested warning messages. Check the entire changes here https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/pull/270/files \n. this is a temporary unavoidable and well-known problem because of the refactoring/changes to new code for all kernels, see all the \"Cleanup -m xxx -a y kernel to latest standard\"  commits here: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commits/master\nSoon the -m 4900 kernel will be changed too and working again.\nThanks anyway for noticing\n. Are you sure that you are reporting this problem to the correct project?\nThis is the OpenCL version (https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat).\nAll the errors mentioned in your output seem to be related to cpu hashcat (https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat).\nJust to make it very clear, you cannot build cpu hashcat with the instructions mentioned within the BUILD.md file of oclHashcat. These are 2 very different projects.\nFortunately, in the future we might not have to tell users that hashcat != oclHashcat, because the main goal for the near future is to have only 1 hashcat binary (1 for each supported platform), that supports all OpenCL compatible CPUs and GPUs.\nI would say, that this problem is completely unrelated to oclHashcat. Do you agree?\n. I'm not yet convinced if we should really add it like this \"CYGWIN_NT-10.0\".\nWhat about other windows versions where the uname changes (slightly), CYGWIN_NT-5.0, CYGWIN_NT-5.1, CYGWIN_NT-5.2, CYGWIN_NT-6.0, CYGWIN_NT-6.1, CYGWIN_NT-6.2, CYGWIN_NT-6.3, CYGWIN_NT-6.4, ... and all the WOW/WOW64 variants ?\nI think it should be at least as flexible as CYGWIN_NT-6* and CYGWIN_NT-10* such that it accepts all windows versions from vista/windows7 up to windows 10.\nThere shouldn't be any reason to exclude windows 7, 8, 8.1... because if it compiles correctly on windows 10, it also should compile without errors on those older windows operating system versions.\nDo you agree?\n. I guess something like this would work (i.e. just remove the windows version number from the UNAME variable):\n```\nUNAME := $(shell uname -s)\nUNAME := $(patsubst CYGWIN_NT-%,CYGWIN_NT-,$(UNAME))\nifeq (,$(filter $(UNAME),Linux Darwin CYGWIN_NT-))\n...\n```\n. oclHashcat-plus was replaced by (a new optimized version of) just \"oclHashcat\" a very long time ago (years!).\nThe newest release version of oclHashcat/cudaHashcat can always be downloaded from https://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/\nBtw, now even \"oclHashcat\" (and \"cudaHashcat\") will no longer exist and be replaced by just \"hashcat 3.0\" (or newer versions, depending on when you read this ;) ). So, it would make sense to just download the newest beta version from https://hashcat.net/beta/\nPlease don't forget to close this issue\nthx\n. also see our FAQ section for this (and yes it is indeed a frequently asked question, very easy to find thousands times within the forum/web): https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#what_is_a_keyspace\n(hashcat's definition of keyspace is not the same as \"number of all password candidate combinations\" as you might think)\n. Again, this is exactly as it is supposed to work.\nKeep in mind, --keyspace is a feature that allows one to obtain the correct numbers for distributed cracking, i.e. the maximum threshold for the --skip (-s) and --limit (-l) values.\n--keyspace, on the other hand, was never meant to be a \"calculate-the-total-number-of-password-candidates-for-me\" tool.\nIt is a special feature to be used before you set the -s and -l values.\nIf it would just calculate the total number of password candidates (without any particularities), it would be kind of useless, because everyone of us knows how to do the math (e.g. line_number * rule_number).\nSo the only thing you need to understand (and it was mentioned dozens of times on forum/irc/wiki/faq), is that hashcat's keyspace feature is NOT a general keyspace calculator (\"total number of password candidates\").\nYou can also see these difference by looking at the status output: basically the \"Restore.Point:\" line shows you how far we are in \"hashcat's keyspace\", while the \"Progress:\" line shows you how many password candidates of the total number of password candidates were already tried.\nThere are many reasons to make this distinction (and why the hashcat's keyspace value is not what you would expect), the most important one being that we can't really reach/set a restore point at every single password candidate try, GPUs try a huge amount of password candidates at once, billions of password candidates per second. Hashcat's keyspace can't be partitioned at an even finer grade than that value. So that is why the hashcat's --keyspace feature was introduced to make it clear how many \"restore points\" there are (think of it as an outer loop iteration count) and how a large cracking job can be distribution with -s/-l depending on the --keyspace value.\nI would say, that everything is exactly as intended. There could be 2 things we could think about here:\n1. let --keyspace run without setting --session (circumventing this particular safety-check)\n2. think/discuss (again) why people don't seem to understand/can deal with this \"keyspace\" definition and maybe think of a different name for this flag.\n(and yes, hashcat-legacy has a different way (i.e. it is finer-grained) to create \"restore points\" and yes, in some cases this matches with the \"total number of password candidates\")\n. As far as I understood this problem was solved by correctly installing the drivers/opencl-header dependency, right?\nIf this problem is fixed, please close this issue. Thank you very much\n. You need to clone the repo and compile it. As simple as that.\nAfter that you get a \"hashcat.app\" binary file that you can execute.\nThe reason why there is no .app file within the hashcat 3.00 release 7z is that there is no cross-compiler for linux to compile with -framework opencl (and the main devs don't really use OSX/Darwin system and aren't yet fully aware how to best  (let someone else) compile a release binary that works with most if not all the different OSX versions).\nI think it is easy enough to just clone and run make (consider reading the build instruction of course), please close this ticket if that worked for you.\nThank you very much \nUpdate: iirc there were a couple of people speaking of OSX-specific \"packages\" that can very easily be downloaded via brew etc (don't quote me on that because I'm not a OSX expert at all)... but again, we prefer users to use the tagged release versions directly from github and just compile it locally (or if you think nothing could be greater/better than the latest version, also the latest master from github, but of course that is a little bit \"dangerous\" because it might not always work correctly since it is a preview/development version with the latest changes)\n. 1. I think you should just use a modern text editor. Almost any text editor can format the output correctly (besides very old \"notepad\" etc). We also save some unneeded bytes etc.\n2. what version of windows is this ? Very old versions, like windows xp, might not work. I don't know. I think we also shouldn't support windows xp anymore, because no driver vendor, nor Microsoft itself officially support them anylonger.\n. Without a complete example hashes it's difficult to say what the problem could be.\nIt's always recommended to look at the example hashes page and compare with the hashes of the same hash type: https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes\nDo you see any major difference?\nAre you sure that there are no leading/trailing spaces ?\n. Thanks for the offer to share your hash file such that we can investigate and maybe exclude/confirm any bugs/problems in hashcat.\nPlease use the contact info (mail) within the docs/changes.txt file for this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat/master/docs/contact.txt\n. Thank you very much for the instruction. Indeed, I didn't previously test (after you mentioned it on a forum post) to crack 2 different .hccap file and test to crack a third time one of the hashes.\nSeems to be fixed now.\nThanks again\n(and as always, please test to confirm, thx)\nSee https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/426\n(as of now, we still need to wait for a merge into master, will happen very soon!)\n. Great. Thanks for testing.\nDon't forget to close this issue! thx\n. I think the correct path could be programmatically found (w/ the Makefile) like this:\nlinux - 32 bit cross-compilation:\n$ i686-w64-mingw32-ld --verbose | grep -m 1 SEARCH_DIR | sed 's/.*\"\\([^\"]*\\)\".*/\\1/'                                                                         \n/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib\nlinux - 64 bit cross-compilation:\n$ x86_64-w64-mingw32-ld --verbose | grep -m 1 SEARCH_DIR | sed 's/.*\"\\([^\"]*\\)\".*/\\1/'\n/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib\nIt should work the same way under mingw too, we need just someone to test this. @neheb, can you try this ? The \"ld --verbose ...\" command should output the correct lib path even under mingw @ windows\nbtw: the grep ... | sed ... could also be replaced by:\ngrep -Po -m 1 'SEARCH_DIR\\(\"\\K.*?(?=\")'\nbut I'm not sure if mingw (and all other supported operating systems used to build from source) supports this\n. Are you sure that you are trying with the correct \"mingw32-ld\" command (i686-w64-mingw32-ld or x86_64-w64-mingw32-ld) ?\nUsing a different ld version (e.g. not the mingw32 provided one), also gives me different results. But this is ofc to be expected. We are trying to get the correct path from mingw32-ld after all.\n. maybe something more flexible would be this:\nx86_64-w64-mingw32-ld --verbose | grep 'SEARCH_DIR(.*mingw' | head -n 1 | sed \n's/SEARCH_DIR(\"=\\?//' | sed 's/\".*//'\ncan you try ?\n. Thanks, that should be the correct path we are looking for.\nThis also should be identical to the more compact version:\nx86_64-w64-mingw32-ld --verbose | grep -m 1 'SEARCH_DIR(.*mingw' | sed 's/SEARCH_DIR(\"=\\?\\([^\"]*\\)\".*/\\1/'\nThe most important thing now is: is this also working under cygwin (windows operating system) ?\nMaybe someone is able to test this\n. wait... shouldn't the output (the path) be:\n/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib\nunder cygwin?\nSo not even the mingw32-ld --verbose output contains the correct path ?\n. okay. Thanks for testing.\nNext, I would suggest that (because the above ld mechanism didn't work) we need to apply a change similar to this one:\n```\ndiff --git a/src/Makefile b/src/Makefile\nindex 4e4da2d..3ded550 100644\n--- a/src/Makefile\n+++ b/src/Makefile\n@@ -63,6 +63,7 @@ FIND                     := find\n INSTALL                  := install\n RM                       := rm\n SED                      := sed\n+EGREP                    := egrep\n ifeq ($(UNAME),Darwin)\n SED                      := gsed\n endif\n@@ -178,8 +179,30 @@ LINUX_32_OBJS            := obj/ext_OpenCL.LINUX.32.o obj/shared.LINUX.32.o obj/\n LINUX_64_OBJS            := obj/ext_OpenCL.LINUX.64.o obj/shared.LINUX.64.o obj/rp_kernel_on_cpu.LINUX.64.o obj/ext_ADL.LINUX.64.o obj/ext_nvml.LINUX.64.o obj/ext_nvapi.LINUX.64.o obj/ext_xnvctrl.LINUX.64.o\n## may need to adjust according to your mingw distribution\n-CRT_GLOB_32              := /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/CRT_glob.o\n-CRT_GLOB_64              := /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/CRT_glob.o\n+CRT_GLOB_LIB_PATH_32     := /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/\n+CRT_GLOB_LIB_PATH_64     := /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/\n+\n+CRT_GLOB_LIB_SYSROOT_32  := $(shell $(CC_WIN_32) --verbose 2>&1 | $(EGREP) -o '(with-sysroot=\"[^\"]\"|with-sysroot=[^ ])' | $(SED) 's/^with-sysroot=\"\\?([^\"])\"\\?$$/\\1/')\n+CRT_GLOB_LIB_SYSROOT_64  := $(shell $(CC_WIN_64) --verbose 2>&1 | $(EGREP) -o '(with-sysroot=\"[^\"]\"|with-sysroot=[^ ])' | $(SED) 's/^with-sysroot=\"\\?([^\"])\"\\?$$/\\1/')\n+\n+ifneq (,$(CRT_GLOB_LIB_SYSROOT_32))\n+CRT_GLOB_LIB_PATH_32     := $(CRT_GLOB_LIB_SYSROOT_32)\n+endif\n+\n+ifneq (,$(CRT_GLOB_LIB_SYSROOT_64))\n+CRT_GLOB_LIB_PATH_64     := $(CRT_GLOB_LIB_SYSROOT_64)\n+endif\n+\n+CRT_GLOB_32 := $(shell $(FIND) \"$(CRT_GLOB_LIB_PATH_32)\" -name CRT_glob.o)\n+CRT_GLOB_64 := $(shell $(FIND) \"$(CRT_GLOB_LIB_PATH_64)\" -name CRT_glob.o)\n+\n+ifeq (,$(CRT_GLOB_32))\n+$(error \"!

No, it's not ?a and it is listed within the wiki:\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/oclHashcat#default_values\n1. --custom-charset1    ?l?d?u\n2. --custom-charset2    ?l?d\n3. --custom-charset3    ?l?d*!$@_ \nand default mask: ?1?2?2?2?2?2?2?3?3?3?3?d?d?d?d\nThis is more like a question that belongs to the forum and not here as a (code) problem/issue (and even when you use the forum for such questions, it's recommended that you first search the wiki/--help/faq and use the forum's search function instead of just asking questions that were already answered).\nPlease don't forget to close this issue. thx\n. The main reasons why it is not just only ?a is that:\n1. using ?a is most of the times not the best choice and not very clever, passwords are still mostly user-defined (and not generated by passwords managers etc), mask attack is (see definition) a special position-for-position mechanism, using ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a (or even ?b?b?b?b?b?b...) is as we always say \"the last thing you should try\" (and indeed not very clever)\n2. the default mask in hashcat uses a \"pattern\" that should crack many/most of the user-defined passwords without taking too long. Note: there are of course also some other hash types supported by hashcat, not just md5/sha1/ntml etc... It is kind of a compromise for woking well and still not taking way too long \n3. the default mask also shows how to use mask attack in a more clever way. just \"brute-forcing\" shouldn't be the idea behind the example/default mask... it should show what is possible and what is reasonable/clever by using also the custom charset at different positions\n... (there are of course a huge set of additional reasons and probably there might also be some reasons against it)\nOne of the possible reasons against using this particular mask/custom charset (-1 ?l?d?u -2 ?l?d -3 ?l?d*!$@_ ?1?2?2?2?2?2?2?3?3?3?3?d?d?d?d), would be indeed that some new users might not immediately understand why some hashes \"were not cracked even if they should\" (but of course some hashes should not, since we use a reduced keyspace) and as you already noticed that the mask \"?1?2?2?2?2?2?2?3?3?3?3?d?d?d?d\" in the status display (without the wiki section) doesn't really tell much.\nThe answer to that is that we recommand that users learn to define and use their own mask (all the time!) as soon as possible and always specify a mask on the command line if you use the mask attack.\nAs you can see, there are some advantages and disadvantages about the current default mask, but in general it still seems to be a more reasonable mask than a \"just brute-force all possible chars\" mask.\n. @migroves do you think we should/could close this issue, because it is not in our hands to fix it? (only a new/better driver or fortunately the alternative driver helps here)\nIf so, please close the issue. Thanks\n. k, I will close this pull request for now ... and maybe reopen a new one when I have a (better) solution.\nThanks\n. I think this should answer the question about how the output can be formatted (and include the username/email etc):\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#how_can_i_show_previously_cracked_passwords_and_output_them_in_a_specific_format_eg_emailpassword\nThis is a question listed within the \"frequently asked question\" wiki for good reason, i.e. because it was answered already thousands of times within the forum/irc/pms etc.\nMaybe this kind of questions fits better on hashcat's forum, instead of a github issue, dunno.\n(and you need to use --show, because some users prefer not to have the username within the \"normal\" output even if --username was specified, they only want to get rid - quickly load - the hash lists)\n. Thanks for the confirmation. But YOU (or a github user with special priviledges for this repository) needs to close this ticket. Can you close it, please?\nThank you very much \n. There is no such concept implemented within hashcat such that \"hashes are remove from potfile\".\nThe hashes always get appended to the potfile (it won't get overridden, delteted etc)\nCan you provide a full example such that it is easier to understand how to reproduce this and what you mean in detail. A minimal step by step example would be perfect, including the content of the potfile after each cracking step.\nBTW: there is also the (new) --potfile-path parameter that allows you to specify a very specific potfile (if you have many .pot files, the default one is \"hashcat.pot\"). \n. That sounds about right. Nothing wrong about that.\nThis behaviour is exacly like it was intended and it seems that it is working correctly.\nBTW: you can use --show to display all the cracks (but this is nothing new, it was working exactly like this since years, e.g. already shown cracks won't be outputted again and again and again... which would be kind of useless - at least in most of the cases -), you can use --potfile-disable if you don't want to \"remove hashes that are part of the current cracking job but are present in the potfile because already cracked\" \n. Well, you would need to modify the kernel to make more than 1 transforms.\nThe best way would be to use the current kernel - the fastest - to run (as currently implemented) 1 single transform for all password + salts <= 55 ... but have a modified kernel to make exactly 2 transforms and only allow  a total length (password length+salt length) > 55.\nA different approach would be more flexible (but probably also much, much slower) is to use a random number of transforms (i.e. implement a single kernel which allows both 1 transform or 2 transforms).\nThe first approach should of course be prefered. In general, both modified approaches/kernels will be much slower as the current kernel (because more and - if you choose approach 2 - flexible amount of transforms, which of course is a performance killer).\nI don't think that this should be implemented by the hashcat devs and committed to this repository, since > 55 passwords are fortunately still kind of rare and because of the speed drop (which will be unavoidable even if the passwords are less than 56).\nIf the algorithm is used within a specific software/cms/forum software etc, the story is different because it can be implemented as a specific algorithm with specific limits and not as a general algorithm like -m 50 (were speed is the most important factor).\nThanks \n. For -a 3 (mask attack) you should always specify a mask: https://hashcat.net/wiki/mask_attack\nThe default mask (?1?2?2?2?2?2?2?3?3?3?3?d?d?d?d, see https://hashcat.net/wiki/oclHashcat#default_values) of course is not designed to crack each and every password (otherwise it wouldn't be a clever default mask, but indeed a brute-force attack which could take much, much longer instead).\nIf you want to test if a specific password/hash combination cracks, use word-based attack (-a 0) with the password within the dictionary or if you really want a mask like -a 3 \"appleappleapple\" instead.\nPlease don't forget to close this \"issue\".\nThanks\n. Because the default is: whenever a GPU is present, hashcat only uses the GPU because in general GPUs are much, much faster (and using both CPU and (dedicated) GPU at the same time are (1) not desired by the majority of the users because it could lead to lag/high CPU use and (2) in some very specific cases it could even slow the cracking process down because of a \"too busy\" CPU not able to feed the GPUs with enough work).\nYou can always play around with \"--opencl-device-types 1,2\" (without quotes) to allow both CPU and GPU devices. You can also select a platform (--opencl-platforms) or select a specific device with --opencl-device (or short -d). Don't forget to allow/whitelist them with --opencl-device-types.\nAgain, this is a frequently asked question and in my opinion doesn't really belong to a github issue (but should be very easy to find out by just looking at the forum and using the forum's search function @ https://hashcat.net/forum)\nThank you very much\n(don't forget to close the issue if you agree that this \"problem\" is \"solved\")\n. This seems to be a duplicate of these (closed) issues: #403, #430 \nPlease don't forget to close this issue\nThank you very much\n. I can't reproduce this at all.\nMaybe the lines have some trailing spaces etc?\nIf not, what is the command line (and content of the input files) you use ?\n. Since the algorithm of -m 21 = osCommerce, xt:Commerce is \"md5 ($salt . $pass)\" you need both the hash and the salt to recover the password. This means that the input hash line, like with most other salted hashes, needs to have a salt part, in this case delimited by a colon \":\".\nThe example on the wiki page clearly says that the input includes a salt (the \":36\" in this very particular case, meaning: delimiter \":\" followed by the salt \"36\"):\n21        osCommerce, xt:Commerce         374996a5e8a5e57fd97d893f7df79824:36\nThe \":36\" is not optional, instead is some crucial information, the salt, that is needed. You can't simply skip it and just say that hashcat doesn't accept it and that the example hash is wrong or hashcat has a bug.\nThe algo is md5 of the password and the salt, so hashcat needs both.\nI would say this should be close because I don't see any problem here (except this misunderstanding from your side), don't forget to close the ticket if you agree.\nThanks \n. Do you mean a custom hashing algorithm?\nWell, there is no documentation yet to guide you to all of the steps you need to do, but it should be quite easy to add a new custom algorithm if you have a glance at the most recently commits of \"new algorithms\".\nFor instance, atom even mentioned here https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/68#issuecomment-170273665 that this is kind of a \"guide\", expressed by a new hash-mode commit (these few lines of code should tell you more than thousands of lines of documentation, if you are into coding).\n. it's possible to specify a directory instead of several files (also for -a 6 and -a 7).\nThe reason why hashcat doesn't allow wildcards with attack type 6 and attack type 7, is that the format is:\n-a 6: dict/directory mask\n-a 7: mask disk/directory\nIf we allow the use of wildcards, we also need to allow much more command line parameters (and random number of those parameters) because the shells (in general) do the file globbing beforehand (even before the hashcat process starts).\nFor attack type -a 0 it is more or less straightforward, the user can append as many command line parameters (i.e. dicts/directories) as he wants to... but for -a 7 and especially -a 6 it is different, because somewhere the user needs to specify the mask too. In case of -a 6 the last parameter must be the mask.\nIn addition to that, what should happen if the user specifies several wildcards within the same command?\nE.g. -a 6 dir1/*.txt --increment dir2/*.dict ?a?a?a?a\nor something like this.... It makes the parsing of the command line much more complicated.\nI think the directory support should work in most cases, so just try to specify the path to the directory instead of using a wildcard.\n. I think this is totally not within the scope of what hashcat is intended to do.\nAfter all, hashcat is an \"advanced password recovery\" tool (as you can read on hashcat's website/github README etc etc).\nWhat you instead think hashcat should do (in the future) by encrypting/decrypting whole files etc has nothing to do with passwords, nor with hashes. Also, encryption is of course not the same as hashing. As you may know, hashcat focuses on recovering passwords by starting with a password hash (yeah, sometimes the hashing algorithm also has some encryption steps, also sometimes involving AES, but that are most of the times special cases of \"key derivation\" starting from passwords etc).\nI don't think that we should support something like this within hashcat.\nA different tool that maybe does not exist already (I didn't check it in detail) may be available in the future (I don't know, at least I can't exclude it at all). At least it isn't totally impossible. But it probably won't be called \"hashcat\" or a \"password recovery tool\".\nYou also need to consider that it's not the same procedure of hashing a few bytes compared to encrypting dozens or hundreds (or even thousands?) of megabytes. There might be other challenges that needs to be addressed, like transfer time bottlenecks etc  (if you transfer more bytes in both directions, to and away from your GPU, there could be some (speed) problems involved etc).\nI don't think something like this should be implemented in hashcat.\n. I think we need to fix the URL, it should be this one https://hashcat.net/files/hashcat-3.10.tar.gz.asc\n. This algorithm is not yet supported.\nI had a quick glance on the algorithm details and it seems that it is as simple as this:\n```\n!/usr/bin/env perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\niWork\nthere exist two versions: iWork 09 and iWork 2013 (2014)\nuse Crypt::PBKDF2;\nuse Crypt::CBC;\nuse Digest::SHA qw (sha256);\nConstants\nmy $hash_version = 1; # or 2\nmy $file_version = 2; # or 1\nmy $format = 1;\nmy $iterations = 100000; # or 4000 for iWork version 2009\nExample\nmy $pass = \"hashcat\";\nmy $salt = pack (\"H\", \"e5eea8cf92ac364e3ba0e20be906e072\"); # RANDOM , can be also just 16 bytes long for 2009 version\nmy $iv   = pack (\"H\", \"55cf3deb5886390f919edf99e3ba40dd\"); # RANDOM\nmy $data = pack (\"H*\", \"c0f4a2a999d7eab7b2ab73e0f0673a26b2961166cda47a35f87b9bc98c54572\"); # RANDOM\nStart\nconcatenate data + hash (SHA-256) of data:\nmy $sha256_of_data = sha256 ($data);\nmy $output = $data . $sha256_of_data;\nPBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 for the key (16 output bytes)\nmy $pbkdf2 = Crypt::PBKDF2->new\n(\n  hasher     => Crypt::PBKDF2->hasher_from_algorithm ('HMACSHA1'),\n  iterations => $iterations,\n  output_len => 16,\n);\nmy $key = $pbkdf2->PBKDF2 ($salt, $pass);\nAES-CBC\nmy $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new ({\n               key         => $key,\n               cipher      => \"Crypt::Rijndael\",\n               iv          => $iv,\n               literal_key => 1,\n               header      => \"none\",\n               keysize     => 16,\n               padding     => \"null\"\n             });\nmy $encrypted = $cipher->encrypt ($output);\nOutput\nmy $hash = sprintf (\"\\$iwork\\$%i\\$%i\\$%i\\$%i\\$%s\\$%s\\$%s\", $hash_version, $file_version, $format, $iterations, unpack (\"H\", $salt), unpack (\"H\", $iv), unpack (\"H*\", $encrypted));\nprint $hash . \"\\n\";\n```\nNote: the verification step should be very simple... just compare if the sha256 hash of the first 32 bytes of the decrypted blob is equal to the last 32 bytes. . @killswitch-GUI\nThis is clearly incorrect:\nhashcat -a 3 -m 0 test.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a\nit should be something like this:\nhashcat -a 3 -m 7100 test.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a\nThe hash mode was incorrect (you set it to MD5 instead of OSX v10.8+) in your command line arguments. This is a note for the devs: this algorithm is implemented as Sybase-PROP FEAL-8 in jtr (see generate_hash () in https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/src/syb-prop_repro_plug.c). All in all, it seems to be a very \"strange\" and old algo..

Sorry if I wasn't clear enough. I was just having a look at the algorithm details.\nOf course, this type of \"hashes\" are not yet supported by hashcat (especially because the AES-CBC decryption and validation part needs to be done too) and this needs to be implemented with a distinct hash type (-m x), parser, kernel + validation on GPU etc.\nSo currently you can't use hashcat for this type of \"hashes\". This is a new algorithm that needs to be implemented (it's for sure not just -m 12000, like one could believe, it's much more, as you can see from the POC above).\nThanks. This is an example hash:\n{PKCS5S2}OHyYon6Cl9y842mEUkgeCsH0HkipUYNNLjqotyOE0wF1oywazi6sm9kDASYw0xzF:hashcat\nit can be generated like this (perl):\n```\n!/usr/bin/env perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse MIME::Base64;\nuse Crypt::PBKDF2;\nmy $w = \"hashcat\";\nmy $s = pack (\"H*\", \"387c98a27e8297dcbce3698452481e0a\");\nmy $a = Crypt::PBKDF2->new\n(\n  hasher     => Crypt::PBKDF2->hasher_from_algorithm ('HMACSHA1'),\n  iterations => 10000,\n  output_len => 32,\n);\nmy $h = $a->PBKDF2 ($s, $w);\nmy $b = encode_base64 ($s. $h);\n$b =~ s/[\\r\\n]//g;\nprint \"{PKCS5S2}\" . $b . \"\\n\";\n```\npython (passlib method):\n```\n!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom passlib.hash import atlassian_pbkdf2_sha1\nfrom binascii import unhexlify\nw = \"hashcat\"\ns = unhexlify (\"387c98a27e8297dcbce3698452481e0a\")\na = atlassian_pbkdf2_sha1.using (salt=s)\nprint a.verify (w, \"{PKCS5S2}OHyYon6Cl9y842mEUkgeCsH0HkipUYNNLjqotyOE0wF1oywazi6sm9kDASYw0xzF\")\nprint a.hash (w);\n```\nTo convert it (manually) to the hashcat format (-m 12000 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1):\n- we know we have always 10000 iteration\n- we know that the salt has a fixed length of 16\n- we need to base64 decode the whole string (lets say into hexadeximal):\n$ echo OHyYon6Cl9y842mEUkgeCsH0HkipUYNNLjqotyOE0wF1oywazi6sm9kDASYw0xzF | base64 -d | xxd -p\n387c98a27e8297dcbce3698452481e0ac1f41e48a951834d2e3aa8b72384d30175a32c1ace2eac9bd903012630d31cc5\n- use the first 32 hex chars (or 16 bytes) and base64 encode them:\n```\n$ echo 387c98a27e8297dcbce3698452481e0a | xxd -p -r | base64\nOHyYon6Cl9y842mEUkgeCg==\n- use the remaining bytes as input to base64 (they will form the actual \"hash\"):\n$ echo c1f41e48a951834d2e3aa8b72384d30175a32c1ace2eac9bd903012630d31cc5 | xxd -p -r | base64\nwfQeSKlRg00uOqi3I4TTAXWjLBrOLqyb2QMBJjDTHMU=\n```\n- and combine it all together:\nsha1:10000:OHyYon6Cl9y842mEUkgeCg==:wfQeSKlRg00uOqi3I4TTAXWjLBrOLqyb2QMBJjDTHMU=\n\nwe can try to crack it with hashcat:\n$ ./hashcat -m 12000 -a 3 'sha1:10000:OHyYon6Cl9y842mEUkgeCg==:wfQeSKlRg00uOqi3I4TTAXWjLBrOLqyb2QMBJjDTHMU=' ?lashcat\nsha1:10000:OHyYon6Cl9y842mEUkgeCg==:wfQeSKlRg00uOqi3I4TTAXWjLBrOLqyb2QMBJjDTHMU=:hashcat\n\nActually, it should be pretty easy to both convert the hashes manually (or with a simple script) or implement a simple parser into hashcat.\nIs anyone still interested in this support ? Should hashcat add a parser for this type of hashes?. @dibiloid could you please test with the current beta version (https://hashcat.net/beta/ , beta 3.40-rc12 or any later version)?   . Note: this is about -m 3300 = MD5(Sun) (example hash: $md5$rounds=904$iPPKEBnEkp3JV8uX$0L6m7rOFTVFn.SGqo2M9W1:hashcat).\nThis hash type was never implemented on GPU and was only available on hashcat-legacy (CPU only).\nAs far as I remember, this is kind of a strange/GPU-unfriendly algorithm.\nWe need to decide if it makes sense to implement it in hashcat.. for you interest, I confirmed here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6233-post-33255.html#pid33255 that the algorithms used for owner password vs user password are just slightly different (the example was with revision 3 PDF 1.4 - 1.6).\nUnfortunately we probably have to do it for each and every PDF revision (+ write parser + new hash modes + kernels etc).... furthermore there is very little requests for this type of password recovery (probably because most of the users just simply work around the permission control of PDF and do not care about the owners password).\nWell, if you still think it is worth the effort, you should give at least some thumbs up on this issue and we will rethink if we should implement it ;). Some additional (nice-to-know) notes about the FileZilla Server algorithm (for devs):\nthe FileZilla Server source code is available here:\nsvn co https://svn.filezilla-project.org/svn/FileZilla%20Server/trunk filezilla_server\nIt seems that FileZilla Server used to MD5 ($pass) hash the user credentials in versions < v0.9.55, see \nhttps://svn.filezilla-project.org/filezilla/FileZilla%20Server/trunk/readme.htm?revision=7789&content-type=text%2Fplain : \n\nNewly set account passwords are now stored in form of salted SHA512 hashes\n\nFurthermore the SaveUser () function seems to be interesting:\nhttps://svn.filezilla-project.org/filezilla/FileZilla%20Server/trunk/source/Interface/UsersDlgGeneral.cpp?view=markup#l265\nand of course the generateSalt () function:\nhttps://svn.filezilla-project.org/filezilla/FileZilla%20Server/trunk/source/Accounts.cpp?view=markup#l471\nTo sum it up, the salt length seems to be hard-coded (to 64 bytes exactly) and the first version that supports this is v0.9.55, so we might add a format like -m 1712 = FileZilla Server >= v0.9.55. Well, it would be great if somebody can investigate what is going on here about the salt length...\nas far as we know Woltlab Burning Board 3 uses exactly 40 bytes salt.\nNewer versions of WBB (4.x) use a totally different algorithm: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/73\n-m 8400 = WBB3 (Woltlab Burning Board) already supports the algorithm sha1($salt.sha1($salt.sha1($pass))), but of course (mostly because of optimizations) restricts the salt to exactly 40 bytes.\nSo why now the salt can be shorter? Is this restriction wrong? ... or is there even a third version of the WBB algorithm?\nWe can't just silently close this issue, something needs to be done (either we need to do some changes to -m 8400 or we need to add some additional hash type and information to the help such that other users can crack those hashes too).\nIt would be great if someone can do some reaseach/investigation about this missing information and resolve these doubts.\nThanks. I just wrote a proof of concept and realized that we miss some further information in the hash format:\n1. the length of the uncompressed data (needed to allocate the memory and tell LZMA how long the output will be)\n2. the length of the first \"stream\" (i.e. how many bytes of the start of the decompressed data will be needed to generate the CRC32). Note: if there are more files in the .7z file, the data of all files will be \"concatenated\" but the CRC32 checksum we need to check was generated by just the bytes of the first file.\n3. the attributes (lc, pb, lp and the dicSize) especially needed for LZMA1\n(all of this info should be easily available/accessible with 7z2hashcat.pl, but we probably need to adapt the hash format again!!!)\n@magnumripper \nHere is a proof of concept/test (feel free to use it): https://gist.github.com/philsmd/99aebdc722472b5322a4e0b0408d743a\nThank you very much. Yeah, maybe something like this:\nwhenever we have $7z$0$ hashes we use:\n...$[data]\nwhenever we have $7z$1$ or $7z$2$ hashes we use:\n...$[data]$[uncompressed_data_length]$[first_file_size]$[coder_attributes]\nWe just need to agree on the hash format and it shouldn't be too difficult to implement both in 7z2hashcat.pl and within the cracking tools.. update: we agreed to the format with (only) the optional crc_len and coder_attributes added.\nThe format should now be stable and hopefully doesn't need to be change anytime soon... therefore we could start to implement the parser and hook for hashcat.. This feature is now implemented, see: https://github.com/philsmd/hashcat/commit/6fe0173a79fa9afcaf74bd2385a85c93f92df5bc. I had the chance to investigate this \"issue\" a little bit here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/8655#issuecomment-277308487 .\nMy conclusion: this is completely unrelated to hashcat, it is just an incorrect test which doesn't respect the sandboxing rules and therefore the sandbox blocks the file read/writes.\nAn example of a modified test was provided within the above issue (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/8655).\nI would say, that we can close this, since I don't see any misbehaving/problem from hashcat itself.. -m 14700 was added for versions < 10.0 and maybe -m 14800 will be added soon. In the meantime you can try to use -m 14700 (with beta versions or git versions) and maybe also this tool helps: https://github.com/philsmd/itunes_backup2hashcat\nThanks. Update: we now also implemented -m 14800 = iTunes Backup >= 10 , see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/07c89833c922bd4980f9bee489fc0d73725380de. Could you please re-try with these changes: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/982 ?\nThanks. This is a general limitation for password candidates, see https://hashcat.net/faq#what_is_the_maximum_supported_password_length\nThe reasons (in general) are that it is very difficult to crack (do not even mention brute-force) a password that is that long, the performance drop that would affect many algorithms if several transforms etc must be done because of the longer length and of course that the general user uses very short and easy to remember passwords (this might not be applicable for veracrypt, but definitely for most of the other algorithms).\nI would not call this an issue. This is a known limitation and it makes sense in almost all of the cases to prefer better performance instead of absurdly long passwords (at least in the perspective of an attacker which even has difficulties to crack passwords > 8 characters) that without knowing the password (or having it in the word list) you wouldn't crack in centuries.. Thanks for the report. I was able to reproduce this problem with the following (minimalized) steps:\n$ cat 1000_3000.hash \nAdministrator:500:0000000000000000299bd128c1101fd6:b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b:::\n$ cat dict.txt\nhashcat\n$ ./hashcat -m 3000 1000_3000.hash dict.txt\n299bd128c1101fd6:HASHCAT\n$ ./hashcat --username --show -m 3000 1000_3000.hash \nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\nSo what I understand from this is that it doesn't matter if you specify --potfile-path and it only happens if --username was specified (even if it wasn't necessary, because hashcat recognized the pwdump format).\nWe will investigate and hopefully fix this soon.\nThx. I had a quick glance at this problem and tested it, but I came to the conclusion that you just miss the --restore-file-path within the last command (the actual restore step).\nHashcat doesn't store the \"last-used-restore-path\" anywhere, so it doesn't have the information where the restore file that you wanted to run, is located.\nYou need to use something like this:\n./hashcat64.bin --session testsession --restore --restore-file-path /root/testsession\nTo sum it up, hashcat either can automatically look up for the file [session_restore].restore in the default directory, but whenever you use a custom path for the restore file (--restore-file-path), you need to specify that path on both runs (the actual start of the cracking and the restore step).\nDoes it work for you with --restore-file-path when restoring? Do you agree that this makes sense?\nPlease don't forget to close the issue if you agree that this is expected behaviour.\nThanks\n\nupdate: almost forgot about the first issue: hashcat doesn't work with the cwd, because users complained about files being created all over there file system, so it uses the path specified in the (profile directory: it is the home directory + \".hashcat/\" - aka ~/.hashcat/ - per default if you use make install, or the download directory otherwise). This is a duplicate of https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/68 . We should consider closing this issue as duplicate and keep #68 open, do you agree?. Since I can't reproduce, could you please recompile like this:\nmake clean\nDEBUG=1 make\nthe output if you run it afterwards already should be more verbose, if not enough, please use:\ngdb --args ./hashcat64.bin -m 3000 --username --show --outfile-format 2 --potfile-path ../hashcat/hashcat.potfile ../original_hashes.txt\nafter that type \"r\" to tun it under gdb, use \"bt\" to show the full backtrack (you can exit with \"q\" and \"yes\")\nThanks. note: this might also be related to this issue that was already fixed: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/996\n... but if that would be the case, you shouldn't experience crashes with the newest version from github (or beta: https://hashcat.net/beta/). Please follow this guide (https://hashcat.net/faq#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this) if you want to request some new algorithm.\nEspecially the information about where this hash type is used would be very crucial for the devs to decide if this makes sense (for other users too) to add this new algorithm.\nThanks. This is one of those formats that were only present in hashcat-legacy (CPU version only).\nThere was never GPU support for -m 3910 = md5 (md5 ($pass) . md5 ($salt))\nSome example hash of this algo:\n250920b3a5e31318806a032a4674df7e:1234:hashcat\n462ae870f71e3926c2661f3fb9dee273:200027583:hashcat\n(note: just to clarify, the output of both inner MD5 () is in - lowercase - hexadecimal, not binary). This should be already supported by this hash type:\n-m 11400 = SIP digest authentication (MD5) \nDid you test with that hash type?. What do you mean by \"different parameters\" ? Different from what?\nHere is the explanation of the fields:\n$sip$*[URI_SERVER]*[URI_CLIENT]*[USERNAME]*[REALM]*[METHOD]*[URI_PREFIX]*[URI_RESOURCE]*[URI_SUFFIX]*[NONCE_SERVER]*[NONCE_CLIENT]*[NONCE_COUNT]*[QOP]*[DIRECTIVE]*[MD5]\n. I tried the hash you provided and it just works as it should (maybe you are just using an older version of hashcat?):\n./hashcat -m 11600 -a 3 --quiet mega.txt wetwilly20?d?d\n$7z$1$19$0$$8$f25e0c9dbe5f45910000000000000000$2892453778$512$510$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$922$5d00100000:wetwilly2016\nNote: the release version of course is not up-to-date here, because we made some changes recently, for instance this one: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/965\nI would say we close this because for example the beta versions: https://hashcat.net/beta/ already supported this type of longer inputs for -m 11600 after we closed issue #965 \nRemember: only @lavanoid and the repository admins (or whoever have full permission) can close the issue. So please test and don't forget to close the issue if it was \"pebcak\".\n\nBTW: please consider giving the issues more meaningful names \"longer hash length\" could mean anything, If it still were a problem, which it is not, it would be something very specific to -m 11600 = 7-Zip and therefore you should mention it in the issue title. Thanks\n. For the time being it was just increased a little bit: https://github.com/philsmd/hashcat/commit/6fe0173a79fa9afcaf74bd2385a85c93f92df5bc#diff-e499f13732ab92b6ade223fa29cf9da3R1091 ( I actually also think we should make this a macro, not hard-code it). Yeah, it could be increased to whatever limit (or even no limit at all), but as we usually prefer to add some upper-limit in hashcat, the decision was to just increase it.\nbtw, 7z2hashcat.pl should always reflect this limit with the PASSWORD_RECOVERY_TOOL_DATA_LIMIT variable (I thought you were aware of this variable?).\nThanks. @neheb \nI'm just questioning if this is the right way to approach this problem, my concerns (I'm not trying to discourage you, I just want to fix this correctly or at least discuss this a little bit more):\n1. may this be related to this \"issue\" https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1024 ? I see no clear reference to the issue but it seems to be related and I'm wondering if the chance to have a combination of an issue and PR at almost the same time about the very same problem should be too low such that it doesn't seem very likely that these are 2 distinct \"problems\". Maybe you just forgot to mention it, dunno... or we are very (un)lucky and it was all just a coincidence (anyway, if you fix an issue, you should reference it in the future)\n2. I don't think we should just disable file globbing like this\n3. There was a commit (by @atom, this one https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/cd3fae958dbf28b79ce190f5759c8e5ce3e46006 ?) that explicity made the changes to support file globbing with the native target. Essentially, the changes within your PR, kind of silently revert this. I think atom added the support on purpose (not by mistake)... we should be a little bit careful here what happened within previous commits, just saying (no offense! this is something that I find myself struggling with, e.g. understanding why somebody added something and to forget to check the file history etc)\n3. There is a whole separate section within win_file_globbing.mk labeled \"win native\" ... and a variable called IS_WIN_BUILD_NATIVE ... your changes kind of make this section useless and also the variable name now becomes kind of misleading (the result is no more \"all native windows builds\" as the variable name might suggest and it was previously).\n4. I think the right way to fix this is to detect the architecture of the native build and always enable file globbing on windows (no matter if it was native or a \"release\"/binary build)... whenever the correct CRT_glob.o (for the correct architecture) can be found\n5. btw: I also find this CRT_GLOB := $(shell $(FIND) / -name $(CRT_GLOB_FILE_NAME) -print -quit) a little bit too much ... at least when we look at where it tries to search i.e. the whole (mysys/cygwin/) file system which could be huge  (this has nothing to do with your PR, I just try to suggest/discuss some changes)... we should limit the search to the libs!\nTherefore my suggestion would be to try to fix the root of the problem (not just disable file globbing in general for all native builds just because it sometimes uses the wrong CRT_glob.o since that file might be of a different/incorrect architecture).\nI'm not saying that I fully grasp how all this cygwin/mysys differences work... but I suggest that we do not disable file globbing in general for native builds, because, as said, I think this was added on purpose.\nI would be happy to discuss this with all of you... maybe I'm just totally wrong about my conclusions and if so please explain it here why we need to disable file globbing like this. (yeah, I admit I'm more used to work with linux so that might limit my understand here a lot).\nAs said, would be great if we can somehow eliminate my concerns and find a solution that does not just work around the build problems, but instead fix the root of the problems...\nPlease discuss it with me... I'm sure we can find a good solution that is acceptable by all of us (and hopefully that \"just works\" - preferably with file globbing enabled ;) -).\nThanks\n\nBTW: I forgot to tell you that I really like your (past) contributions to hashcat and really appreciate them... I just think that here we need some \"room\" for discussion (at least to understand the main problem)\n. Thanks @neheb for explaining this. I didn't know this.\nI suggest that we document that (with some more comments in win_file_globbing.mk) such that we keep this information safe for the future.\nSo, if I'm not totally mistaken, file globbing should work with both cross-compiling (mingw) and non-cross-compiling, MYSYS and cygwin. For cygwin it's a little bit different and we should make this clear also in win_file_globbing.mk (by changing the code and/or adding comments).\nCould you do these changes, @neheb?\nThanks again. I just made some tests with appveyor (I didn't know this even existed before @stephengroat made his PR). See: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/philsmd/hashcat/build/1.0.2/job/0wcvyc7ncdh84o85#L597\nThere still are some errors with your latest code @neheb.\nSince I can't guarantee that my appveyor_test branch is always up-to-date, could I kindly ask you that you also test with appveyor and link your appveyor test builds here (with \"neheb\" in the URL, you need to sign in, e.g. with oauth to appveyor)?\nDo you know how these remaining errors can be correctly fixed?\nThank you very much for your contributions!. I'm not sure about this _dowildcard variable... but  if it really works (and the binary builds - cross-compilations - continue to work), then we should make changes to reflect this new approach also in the win globbing file (win_file_globbing.mk).\nFurthermore, I just found out that the mingw compiler allows this command line option: --enable-wildcard (which actually does something similar to _dowildcard = -1, but seems to be a little bit more intuitive).\nWe should definitevely document all this facts within win_file_globbing.mk:\n1. on which systems (mingw native, mingw cross-compile, mysys, cygwin, .... you name it!) we can use file globbing\n2. for each and every of this systems we should explain our approach: for instance in this case we could document it like this: \"for mingw builds, we can simply use --enable-wildcard, no need to find CRT_glob.o\" (this is just an example, I'm still not sure if this is correct, we need to test)\n3. of course we also need to change win_file_globbing.mk accordingly (or in some cases it might be needed to also change src/Makefile)\n\nFor what regards the tests: when I was mentioning \"hashcat-run tests\" with appveyor I was thinking about some (or even just a single one to start with) very quick tests after appveyor finished the building process. Not a full run of tools/test.sh ! this would be much too demanding. tools/test.sh is intended to test each and every hash type, this takes hours.\nInstead, I was thinking here about something similar to the \"test\" formula-sections which the hashcat.rb homebrew formula performs: just some quick tests after the build process.\nI found out (already yesterday when opening this issue), that appveyor allows to do exactly this: see https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/ (search for \"test_script\").\nI'm not sure exactly what we need to write under that section, but it seems that it just tests for the exit code of the executable (is this correct?). Then it would be something as simple as this:\ntest_script:\n  - hashcat -m 0 --show *ple0.hash\nThis would, if everything works correctly, return exit code 0 (and therefore succeed, because the file should expand to example0.hash)\nIdeally, we would also test for the opposite (e.g. if we specify a file that shouldn't exit, it should throw an error e.g. \"hashcat -m 0 --show *file_not_found.hash\")\nBtw: if needed I saw some more elaborate examples of appveyor.yml test_script section, see \nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/bond/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L213-L243 (just a random example, but the throw statements look interesting, I'm also still not sure if we can use this \"ps\" (powershell?) accross all windows builds with appveyor, this needs to be tested). Something that might be needed is using this: if ($LastExitCode -ne 0) { $host.SetShouldExit ($LastExitCode)  } in case of the \"opposite/failing globbing test\" mentioned above etc, but this all needs to be double checked\n\nUpdate: it seems that --enable-wildcard does something different than I was thinking it would do.... it is just used to compile the mingw libraries themself, not the end-user binaries with gcc (so it seems we can't use --enable-wildcard, even if that would be some really nice feature of mingw, but it doesn't work like I was thinking). btw, these are the changes that are important for this issue here too (and about which @jsteube is talking about): https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/79513ce2265f0541142a4f1ee8989db594ebe537. Just that we avoid doing the same thing: I'm currently preparing 2 commits for badges and for the \"test_script\" session (2 PRs should be ready soon).\nAfter that we will see what is still missing to close this issue.. What is still confusing to me is this:\nMSYSTEM: MINGW32\nBASH: C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash\nMSYS_CACHE: C:\\msys64\\var\\cache\\pacman\\pkg\nWhy msys64 paths with MINGW32, is this even correct? mayeb you can explain, @stephengroat?. That was exactly what I was thinking about this strange inconsistency between paths vs MSYSTEM name (32 vs 64). Thanks for confirming it. I just wanted to make sure that we do not build 64bit mingw/msys binaries twice.\nBTW: the .appveyor.yml should now be working with test_script(s) runs... hope you can confirm that the file looks good .... and thanks again for your contributions!. Which version do you use?\nPlease re-try with the beta version (https://hashcat.net/beta/)\nThis might be a duplicate of these issues:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/996\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1010\n\nPS: do not forget to close the issue, if everything works with newest github source code version (or beta version). Strange, I can't reproduce with latest git version:\nPlease post the output (of your compiled binary from github) with:\n./hashcat -V\nThanks. good\nCould you please close this issue about the segfault and open a new one to request to add (back) the support for the LM part merging within the --show output ?\nAs a reference for devs you could add this commit ref https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a460ab01b684eeb1d26c503df60d8654a57bf699 , which (unknowingly?) seems to have \"caused\" this feature removal (the important lines in code are around \"LM_MASKED_PLAIN\" etc).. Hey @gum0x, thx for your contribution.\nI think the formatting (indentation, tab vs spaces etc) got mixed up a little bit within these changes (it seems that you used tabs in places where we always use spaces etc).\nCould you please try to fix this?\nBTW: I think this variable name \"OSVERSION\" is a little bit confusing, because under linux the result seems to be just the first digit of the linux kernel number. Maybe we should add this variable to the Darwin section (because it is something specific to OSX?) and call it something like OSXVERSION ? (As you see, I'm not totally sure if my assumptions of this osxversion vs kernel version numbering are correct... maybe you can find this out too ? Thank you so much)\n\nUpdate: maybe we should make it even more generic and replace the check with a check for versions >= 16 ?. I played around with appveyor too, with this .appveyor.yml file:\n```\nenvironment:\n  CYG_MIRROR: http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com\n  CYG_PACKAGES: make,gcc-core,clang\n  matrix:\n    - MSYSTEM: MINGW64\n      BASH: C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash\n      MSYS_CACHE: C:\\msys64\\var\\cache\\pacman\\pkg\n      CC: gcc\n    - MSYSTEM: MINGW32\n      BASH: C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash\n      MSYS_CACHE: C:\\msys64\\var\\cache\\pacman\\pkg\n      CC: gcc\n    - CYG_ROOT: C:\\cygwin64\n      CYG_CACHE: C:\\cygwin64\\var\\cache\\setup\n      CYG_SETUP: setup-x86_64.exe\n      BASH: C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\bash\n      CC: gcc\n    - CYG_ROOT: C:\\cygwin\n      CYG_CACHE: C:\\cygwin\\var\\cache\\setup\n      CYG_SETUP: setup-x86.exe\n      BASH: C:\\cygwin\\bin\\bash\n      CC: gcc\n    - MSYSTEM: MINGW64\n      BASH: C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash\n      MSYS_CACHE: C:\\msys64\\var\\cache\\pacman\\pkg\n      CC: clang\n    - MSYSTEM: MINGW32\n      BASH: C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash\n      MSYS_CACHE: C:\\msys64\\var\\cache\\pacman\\pkg\n      CC: clang\n    - CYG_ROOT: C:\\cygwin64\n      CYG_CACHE: C:\\cygwin64\\var\\cache\\setup\n      CYG_SETUP: setup-x86_64.exe\n      BASH: C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\bash\n      CC: clang\n    - CYG_ROOT: C:\\cygwin\n      CYG_CACHE: C:\\cygwin\\var\\cache\\setup\n      CYG_SETUP: setup-x86.exe\n      BASH: C:\\cygwin\\bin\\bash\n      CC: clang\nclone_depth: 1\ninit:\n  # Don't try to convert line endings to Win32 CRLF\n  - git config --global core.autocrlf input\ninstall:\n  - ps: if (Test-Path Env:\\CYG_ROOT) { Start-FileDownload \"http://cygwin.com/$env:CYG_SETUP\" -FileName \"$env:CYG_SETUP\" }\n  - if defined CYG_ROOT (%CYG_SETUP% --quiet-mode --no-shortcuts --only-site --root \"%CYG_ROOT%\" --site \"%CYG_MIRROR%\" --local-package-dir \"%CYG_CACHE%\" --packages \"%CYG_PACKAGES%\" --upgrade-also)\n  - if defined MSYSTEM (%BASH% -lc \"pacman -Suuy --noconfirm\")\nbuild_script:\n  - if defined BASH (%BASH% -lc \"cd $(cygpath ${APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER}) && git submodule init && git submodule update && make\")\ntest_script:\n  # some file globbing tests\n  #  1. hash file should not exist and therefore hashcat should complain (if it does not there might be a problem)\n  #  2. hash file should expand to example0.hash and succeed\n  - ps: >-\n      .\\hashcat -m 0 --show *file_not_found.hash 2>&1 | out-null\n  if ($LastExitCode -eq 0)\n  {\n    throw \"test failed\"\n  }\n\n  .\\hashcat -m 0 --show *ple0.hash\n\n```\nNote: you have a duplicate line (- if defined MSYSTEM (%BASH% -lc \"pacman -Suuy --noconfirm\"))\nthe problem is, the globbing still fails on cygwin, see https://ci.appveyor.com/project/philsmd/hashcat/build/1.0.38/job/vcqi2ole1nxvc1k2#L330\nCan you merge our files please @stephengroat ?. --custom-charset1 (or short -1) per definition only defines a custom charset.\nYou need to tell hashcat what your mask is, e.g something like this:\nhashcat64.exe -a 3 -m 9600 --increment --increment-min 1 --increment-max 7 --custom-charset1 0123456789 -o pass.txt doc.hash ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1\nAs you can see here, the mask \"?1?1?1?1?1?1?1\" (should always be at the end of the command line for -a 3), is needed and tells hashcat: at position one use the custom charset number 1 defined as all numbers from zero to nine, at position 2 also use the custom charset number 1, ...., at position 7 use the charset number 1. That output doesn't show anything interesting.\nYou need to use at least:\nmake clean\ngit pull\nmake DEBUG=1\ngdb --args hashcat ....\n(after gdb started, you need to type \"r\" to start the process, after it crashes you need to type \"bt\" for the backtrack, you can quit gdb with \"q\" and \"yes\")\nYou also forgot to mention what your command line looks like etc.\nBTW: it's probably something related to your GPU(s), drivers, OpenCL environment etc... does clinfo work without crash ? Are you sure that all drivers are correctly installed?. Hey,\nI'm wondering why:\n\nyour post is formatted like this, e.g. why do you not just use a github \"quote\"/\"code\" section and use actual newlines instead of the \"\\r\\n\" strings?\nwhy your output contains 2 errors and the topic is about the fan speed problem\ntherefore: are you sure that the \"No hashes loaded\" problem was expected and has nothing to do with your actual problem (it's just confusing why one would post 2 independent errors in a long line like this)?\n\nThe \"No hashes loaded\" should have something to do with your -m parameter and/or the format of the hashes (see https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes).\nBack to the fan speed problem, yeah, sometimes we get reports like this, often it has to do with non-reference design GPU(s): custom fan design, watercooled etc.... can you give more details about your GPU(s)?  The problem most of the time is, the non-reference design cards sometimes do not report the functionality/features of the card correctly... they tell hashcat something like this: \"yeah, there is a fan and yeah you can monitor/control it\", but actually (sometimes) there is no fan and no support for monitoring/controlling a fan.\nMore information is needed here\nThanks. From reading the product description here: https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-RX470-O4G-GAMING/ (\"and outperform reference designs\", \"Gaming\" within the name etc), it seems that you are exactly in the situation described above, i.e. a non reference design with a custom cooler design... but probably they saved some cost on the firmware (and didn't change the feature list that the card supports).\nBTW (from the include/adl_defines.h file of the ADL SDK) :\n```\n// Function  not supported by the driver\ndefine ADL_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED     -8\n```\nNot sure if we can do anything about it, besides ignoring the error.. Please retry with the beta versions (https://hashcat.net/beta), or compile the master branch from source.\nThis bug seems to be already fixed with the latest version.. This smells a lot like a faulty driver installation (OpenCL runtime, \"clGetDeviceIDs(): CL_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND\" wtf? It seems that not even \"clinfo\" works, right?).\nYeah, at least a gdb backtrack should be the very minimum, otherwise we do not even know where the crash occurs:\nmake clean\ngit pull\nmake DEBUG=1\ngdb --args hashcat -b -m 1000\nafter that type \"r\" to start the gdb run... after the crash occurs type \"bt\" (for backtrack). You can exit gdb by typing \"q\" and \"yes\".\nThanks. @Faiz009 it would be nice if you test both \"clinfo\" and give the gdb output. Otherwise, we don't even know about what problem we are talking about in here.. First, thank you for your contribution.\nPlease consider these (maybe seemingly unimportant) points for the future:\n1. give better names to the issue \"-m 2500 feature request\" and/or even \"hashcat\" within the title doesn't make much sense... the title should be something easily findable. Just name your problem/suggestion/feature request directly within the title: e.g. \"Output format for WPA should include the AP's MAC address\". Do you notice the difference? \"output format\" (or \"potfile format?) together with \"MAC\" address is something that we can find when searching for it in the future\n2. bug reports for hashcat-utils (or any separate project/repo) should not be mentioned between the lines here. There you go: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/issues\n3. the same is true for feature requests (e.g. the change for possible values you are suggestion for the \"authenticated\" field)\n4. to fix the cap2hccapx problem you should also not forget to provide some examples and explain it in more details (but again, not here!)\nThanks\n. It seems that appveyor reports some errors related to these changes: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jsteube/hashcat/build/1.0.211/job/po6xvvd8ootrkas0#L336 and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jsteube/hashcat/build/1.0.211/job/6kay6311dhde3iie#L333\nI'm also wondering if we should change this \"_WIN64\" checks like this... I would prefer just adding the CYWIN support for now and discuss the macro problems (WIN32, WIN64, WIN etc) within a new issue/PR, or is my assumption wrong that the cygwin changes are/should be unrelated?. Hey @ZerBea,\nthank you for the report.\nCould I kindly ask you to share the .hccapx file with us (if you prefer privately), such that we can reproduce this.\nIt would be great if you also include all the commands that need to be run (step by step).\nBTW: I think @jsteube still expects an answer to the cap2hccapx problem (about the M1+M4 and M3+M4 problem mentioned here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1113#issue-208649274 ), so please check your mail inbox ;). Thank you @LocutusOfBorg.\nAs you may have noticed, we did some further changes at the project's description, see: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/d200b8493e30f25eaae441107f8d059c0f009a59\nMaybe you can do the same changes for the package description?\nThx\nupdate: hmm, the 200+ algo change might be only correct with the newest version... but the grammar correction should be applied already now to both (packages and README.md). From your output I can see that you are using an older revision (5ec763fa) and not the current one of hashcat (just to have the full picture the version update changes were made later: see 9b08d4af0fd92691779f3d624f2e071cdee914ca), use:\nmake clean\ngit pull\nmake\nto update to the newest version.\nBTW: you need to use the newest version of both hashcat and hashcat-utils. Since you use a dev version (the git version), it should be clear that many changes could be made each and every day without any announcement (since it's still a beta version). . Please be more specific, do you mean that your password is longer than the maximum supported password length (64 in your case?) ?\nsee https://hashcat.net/faq#what_is_the_maximum_supported_password_length for the maximum supported length of the password\nAlso, it seems that you are sometimes speaking about hmac-sha512 and sometimes about hmac-sha256... it's a little bit confusing.... and maybe your \"hash\" has the same problem.\nSee https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes for example hashes for all hmac variants\nBTW: you always need to use hash:salt to the hash.txt file (depending on the hash type either the salt or the password is used as the hmac key). Note: for now (until next release if you really do not want to use upcomming beta versions or git versions), you could just work around this incorrect sanity check with the use of a mask file:\n$ cat a.hcmask \nefghijklmnop,?1?1?1\n$ hashcat --keyspace -a 3 a.hcmask\n144\nNote: it is not allowed to use .hcmask file with multiple lines in it whenever you use --keyspace. Therefore, this is just one possible dirty hack to trick hashcat to generate the keyspace value. You shouldn't get used to this mechanism, because devs might also decide to disable reading .hcmask completely whenever the --keyspace argument was used. So just use this dirty hack if you really need to and can't wait for the next release (or use git version/beta).. The current complete list of the codes is here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/89f8739ddeccd90ef60f0637cfa4a965f35e131a/include/types.h#L161-L171\nThe main problem is that not all of these values are valid status/exit codes (so there is that slight difference between status codes and \"device status\" value displayed in the machine readable output).\nMaybe @jsteube has an idea what we should do here: maybe a wiki section or a separate wiki page on hashcat.net should be sufficient to explain the values!?. Are you sure about the \"Line-length exception\" error?\nThat specific error would mean that the length of the line is not correct (it shouldn't matter if there is a = or an A at the end).\nPlease be more specific about the total length of the hashes, it should be 3 (signature) + 44 (hash + padding) = 47\nYou should only get a \"Line-length exception\" whenever the length is not 47. Can you please verify that?\nAfter we clarify that, we can double-check if the padding is correct (with \"=\" or not)...\nA (or preferably several) real-word example would be great, otherwise I can't really tell what is going on.\nThx. ah, see ?\nthis is a completely different error (at least when we look at what hashcat internally sees/reports)\nHash-length exception is different from Line-length exception\nNow the problem makes (just a little bit) more sense ;)\nwe need to investigate...\nThx. Well, I found some examples within the john the ripper code and it seems that you found an interesting bug that I can confirm with these examples: https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/9737dea214b5e52e87fd5775acadc7839d0fcdee/src/FGT_fmt_plug.c#L78-L80\nSince -m 7000 = Fortigate (FortiOS) was ported from hashcat-legacy (and you also wrote/confirmed above that there is some inconsistency between input/output of hashes with hashcat-legacy)... we unfortunately also propagated that parsing/encoding/decoding bug to hashcat (see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-legacy/blob/master/src/engine.c#L2193).\nI have no clue, why this faulty code exists in hashcat-legacy, but I don't think it is worth patching hashcat-legacy... hashcat-legacy is kinda completely replaced by hashcat and we do not really change it a lot anymore.\nThank you and please test. No, this is the wrong place to ask question like this.\nThis is not a bug/issue at all (nor a feature request or anything related).\nThe answer was already given here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6355-post-33892.html#pid33892\n . If you really want to know how it is generated, you should check the code (and take your time to understand it)... otherwise, you shouldn't bother at all about this checksum. There is no reason, why you should be that eager to force us to tell you bit-by-bit what this code does, do the reading yourself. There is absolutely no reason why you need to mess around with this checksums etc.. Again, this is not a hashcat issue... if you really want to implement some (external) wrapping code, then you should spend the time understanding how the checksum is generated.\nOtherwise, you could just use --show / --left / --remove options.. Nice find, I admit I missed that specific case when fixing #1153 . Yeah, it was kinda related.\nHopefully now we have covered all cases of custom charsets + command line switches.\nThanks. I think this is to be expected and normal behaviour. The GPUs didn't finish the huge set of password candidates earlier than @ 3.64%. If the checkpoint was not yet reached, the Checkpoint Quit feature can't terminate hashcat. The only way to stop earlier (and therefore have finer grained checkpoint goals) would be to have different/smaller -w (or -n/-u) settings, but this of course would also affect performance a lot.. This is an interesting report.\nThe problem is, that there are a lot of hashcat users out there that also use windows 10 and none of them reported problems like this recently (except the bug we found some weeks ago thanks to @d2-d2, but this was indeed a problem that was introduced with some refactoring and fixed very quickly).\nI've also done various testings with windows 10 (benchmarks, cracking jobs, I ran some tests etc)... but never experience any file permission problems. (note: I am normally a linux user, so I might not be the right guy for windows-specific stuff, but I was always able to start hashcat without any permission problems on windows).\nI therefore think that it's almost 100% a local issue and that the problem is not hashcat itself.\nYou should definitely do some more tests @alphastar868.\nI also do not understand why you use fat32. Is this an usb drive?\nMaybe the problem is due to the usb drive, some local permission problems (parent folders etc) or they are only affecting the way you extracted the archive or the GUI (3rd party tool!) is the culprit.\nThis are some test you should do to exclude that anything like this is part of the problem.\nSo I would suggest that (for these tests) you do not use fat32, you do not use external USB disks and that you download a fresh copy of hashcat from https://hashcat.net/hashcat and extract it with 7-Zip within a folder that you know is read/writable by your user (like C:\\users\\alphastar868\\Downloads\\hashcat\\ , replace alphastar868 with your windows user name) and try to run it with cmd.exe inside that particular folder.\nIt is also advisable that you first make sure that you can read/write files within C:\\users\\alphastar868\\Downloads\\hashcat\\ , so open something like notepad or notepad++ and try to write and read a file (e.g. test.txt).\nThanks. Could you also please post the full command you are using and the full output?\nDoes it also happen with something as simple as\nhashcat -b\n?\nDo you by any chance have a separate computer/notebook (preferably with similar setup, e.g. win 10 etc) to test if it happens there too ?\nAlso, you said that you only use cmd, right? Do you use additional terminals like mingw/cygwin/msys? Maybe it also has something to do with other programs you have installed or individual windows settings?\nIt could also be that the problem is not at all the read-only permission (those files/folders could also be just read-only, because hashcat only reads those files, it doesn't write to them), but the ownership (the user who can access/read them etc).\n. Please do not post bug reports if you use old versions of hashcat.\nhashcat 3.40 is the current release version. Please always use the latest versions (especially if you try to troubleshoot and/or report bugs).. I see 3 problems with this PR:\n1. why should we use the value 20 (hardcoded)? this doesn't make any sense to me\n2. why do you not increase the length within the  OUTFILE_FMT_CRACKPOS branch? The value should only be increased if that specific condition holds and therefore only if that branch was taken\n3. we should use snprintf () instead of sprintf () and check that we do not use more bytes than HCBUFSIZ_LARGE (this was not a problem with your PR, but we should fix this anyway)\nCan you please try to update your PR?\nthx\n\nupdate: forgot one important problem:\n4. we need to update docs/changes.txt too to mention the problem that versions <= 3.40 didn't work well with crackpos. For what regards docs/changes.txt, you just need to add something like this:\n\"- Fixed --outfile-format 11 up to --outfile-format 15: the crack position was not correctly outputted\"\nwithin the \"Bugs\" section:\n```\n\nBugs\n\n```\nFurthermore, I'm not sure if we really need this new numDigits () function (also: it should respect the coding standards, see README.md, e.g. num_digits () etc...), because snprintf already is able to tell us the number of bytes that are needed for the digits. That means, it is kind of useless to ignore the return value, but instead introduce a further function that does basically the same.\nThere is some further room of improvement that comes to my mind (but doesn't really affect only your PR): we shoud also make sure that whenever we do:\ntmp_buf[tmp_len] = 0;\nthat tmp_len is never greater or equal to HCBUFSIZ_LARGE, e.g something like this code should be used:\ntmp_len = MIN (tmp_len, HCBUFSIZ_LARGE - 1);\ntmp_buf[tmp_len] = 0;\nWhat do you think?\nBTW: thank you very much for your contributions, these are some great finds and fixes!. I don't understand this problem completely.\n--show should always be run independently form the actual cracking.\n--show/--left were designed to be used after your cracking job and not mix them up with the cracking itself.\nThere are basically always 2 steps involved (2-fold), like described here: https://hashcat.net/faq#how_can_i_show_previously_cracked_passwords_and_output_them_in_a_specific_format_eg_emailpassword\n--show/--left are just meant to be used after cracking to output the cracks (and if you want with a different --outfile-format)\nI don't know if this is just a missunderstanding from your side how --left/--show were designed or maybe I just didn't understand this \"issue\"!?. hashcat will output this line\nINFO: Removed x hashes found in potfile\nwhenever it has found some hashes within the potfile, but of course it won't print all the hashes again and again, each time.\nIf this is not enough information (just the number of hashes), then you need to start hashcat twice or have some other means to store the information externally that you need.\nI don't think that hashcat should change anything here, it works exactly as it was designed:\n1. crack only the hashes that are not yet cracked (whenever --show was not used)\n2. show all hashes that were cracked whenever --show was used (and show all hashes that were not cracked when --left was used). These commands should always be run independently, not in combination with the cracking job itself.. --show was always designed to only display what was already cracked (and the user can use different --outfile-format options to modify the output).\nMaybe it seems silly to you, but other users need exactly this option: e.g. display everything that was already cracked (and exit).\nBTW: it is very often the case that not 100% of the hashes are cracked, so --show would always need to start cracking and that is not what it should do (therefore the name \"show\", it only shows what was already cracked and exits).. To clarify things a little bit here: as far as I understood, this request is about a general change of the hccapx structure/format for this particular case:\n1. an external (3th party) tool could not (solely, or not at all!) rely on the replay counter because sometimes focusing only on the replay counter could fail (consider the case where M1 from the AP was captured ... after that a new M1 - the one that is needed! - was not captured, furthermore M2 - the response - was captured later on, in this case we could falsely ignore these sequence of good packets, even if replay counters do not match, but nonce-bruteforce would correct it)\n2. the external tool should be able to mark these messages such that the hccapx format knows if the replay counter was considered (and some filtering was done based on the replay counters of the messages from the AP and STA) or if it was ignored (and for instance only timestamps and the message order were considered for filtering)\n3. hashcat should, for the time being, just ignore the highest bit of the message_pair (bit 8), which could be used to indicate exactly this fact (replay counter ignored or not ignored)\n4. this additional bit could be used both for analysis/statistics, but also  (in the future) in some cases to trigger some further logic (e.g. related to nonce-bruteforce)\nCorrect?. Don't forget to suggest what should be an acceptable length in your opinion. Please discuss it here.... Wow, I would call this a really great example of a feature request description. Well done.\nSo, I already did all the preparation... host code (including parser etc).\nThis hash type should be ready soon (\"only\" OpenCL kernel missing).\nThx. Please provide more information:\n1. did you download hashcat from https://hashcat.net/ ?\n2. which version of hashcat do you use?\n3. how did you install the Nvidia GPU driver ?\n4. did you install the OpenCL ICD ?\netc. hashcat works on a byte-by-byte password length. Each position/char within your mask also determines the bytes that should be tried on that specific position.\nUnfortunately, this is exactly how encoding works (and yeah, sometimes encoding is a little bit counter-intuitive:\necho -n \u00e4 | xxd -p\nc3a4\n2 bytes -> a mask of length 2\nI don't think hashcat can and should do something here, because this is exactly how encoding works.\nIt's just a little bit confusing if users think their \"char is of length 1\" while it is not at all.. ISO-8859-1 is not the same as UTF8\nDifferent encoding also (could) imply different bytes (even for the same \"character\").\nThat's why the hex char 0xe4 in ISO-8859-1 and 0xc3a4 in UTF8 both represent the \"\u00e4\" character, but the hash of those bytes of course is different.. UTF8 encoding is the most common, straightforward to use and therefore there are no special charset files. You can always just convert the charset files with something like iconv (or similar software):\niconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 charsets/combined/German.hcchr > German-UTF8.hcchr\n... but keep in mind that different encoding could also imply different lengths for the same symbol/character, so you need to increase the mask length accordingly (or use --increment and a mask that is long enough).. 1. oclHashcat was superseded with just \"hashcat\" a long time ago (years!!!), please do not use oclHashcat (or at least do not use it if you want to report bugs)\n2. Kali linux unfortunately does everything wrong when it comes to packaging \"hashcat\", it uses completely incorrect dependencies etc\n3. you should first make sure that you have the correct OpenCL driver (and ICD) installed for your OpenCL devices, see the recommendations on https://hashcat.net, and after that download hashcat from https://hashcat.net/hashcat/ (version 3.40 or above)\n4. yeah, problems with drivers/setup/installations could result in \"crashes\", even if hashcat has nothing to do with them... the drivers might just not work correctly\n5. make sure that neither Mesa, nor pocl is installed (they often cause \"crashes\")\n6. if you want to debug something with hashcat, you need to compile it like this: make clean; git pull; make DEBUG=1; gdb --args hashcat -b\nMy guess is, that this has nothing to do with hashcat itself, it is just your installation that was not correctly configured/installed (including the hashcat version - always use the newest version - and the correct driver).\nBTW: it would also help a lot if you mention which OpenCL device(s) you have (the hardware) to reduce the amount of possible point of failures (at least a little bit). I think we should avoid having 2+ labels/names for the same algorithms. Therefore we should also change the names in https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/interface.c#L79-L302\nDo you agree?. What do you mean with this:\n-1 ?a?a?a?a?a\n?\n--custom-charset1 (or short -1) is used to define custom charsets.\nI think this is pebcak because you are mixing up custom charsets with masks. Can you please describe it a little bit better what needs to be done (in your opinion)?\nDo we need to make changes to the .hccapx structure (again)?\nDo we have this type of information somewhere ? I think the .cap file could know if the devices are using little/big endian, or? ... or do we always need to perform both, little and big endian brute-force?\nThx. This is not really a bug but just a known limitation (or let's call it optimization?).... and it has to do with how/when the final length of the password candidate is known and when it can be rejected... in most of the cases (with fast hashes) the final length is only known very late (when we speak about the GPU-based rule engine etc)... therefore the host can't really know the final length. Therefore every password from the dictionary that doesn't meet the min/max length will be rejected as soon as possible. This is true also for slow hashes.\nYou have 2 options:\n\nuse -j/-k (with single rules, not rule files!)\nuse a pipe and an external tool like e.g. from hashcat-utils (or hashcat itself, e.g. hashcat --stdout -a 6 dict.txt ?d?d?d?d | hashcat -m 2500 -a 0 -w 4 --status --status-timer 10 a.hccapx)\n\nBTW: this is a question that was answered dozens of times on the hashcat forum... please use the search function of the hashcat forum next time. it would be very great and helpful in the decision making if we discover some way on how .7z files like this can be generated (i.e. with a tool/archiver or sdk etc) and how wide-spread/rare they are. Maybe even more details like if the padding is really random or not... I'm just curious about why one tool/generator is using non-default padding (maybe it was even designed like this to circumvent cracking by jtr and hashcat, that would be funny or it has something to do with antivirus signature bypassing: \"let's use random bytes within the AES padding, such that the sha checksums are arbitrary for each malicious file\" etc)\nI agree, that especially with the standard cost of 2^19 of .7z, the final fast \"verify part\" (including aes+lzma+crc32) doesn't make much of a (speed) difference. . This looks more like -m 3710 than like 3910 (since the salt in your case should be prepended), furthermore as always we need more details like mentioned here: https://hashcat.net/faq#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this\nIt would be interesting which software/cms etc uses this algorithm.\nFurthermore, this reminds me of this recent forum thread: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6558.html, where the algorithm turned out to not use just MD5(x) but a mix of raw MD5 and hex version of MD5 (e.g. only the final output was in hex).\nTherefore it is very important to get the algorithm details correct from the beginning, including max pass/salt length and hex/raw formats etc.\nAlso note: MD5($salt) is a very bad algorithm design, since this can be precomputed. I must admit that I was quite unmotivated when I saw this issue for the first time because I saw that the algorithm description by the OP uses genwallet (), privtopub () and therefore I thought about Elliptic-curves cryptography and whatnot.\nNow I just gave it another glance and it seems that all of this is not needed at all. The algorithm is very easy.\nsha3 (aes_256_cbc_decrypt (pbkdf2 ($pass, $pass, 2000), $iv, $encseed) . \"\\x02\")\nSo basically we just extract the first 16 bytes (0-15) from the \"encseed\" field which we use as the initialization vector (iv) for the AES-256-CBC decryption, the remaining bytes (starting from byte 16) we use as the encrypted seed.\nThe key for the AES-256-CBC decrytion is generated by using the user password as salt AND pass and use 2000 iterations of pbkdf2-hmac-sha256.\nThe final hash is just a sha3/keccak hash of the seed (the decrypted encseed from the AES decrytion mentioned above).\nTherefore the code is basically just this:\n```\n!/usr/bin/env perl\nAuthor: philsmd (for hashcat)\nDate: dec 2017\nLicense: CC0 (public domain)\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Crypt::PBKDF2;\nuse Crypt::CBC;\nuse Digest::Keccak qw (keccak_256);\n\nAlgorithm can be found in:

algorithm is basically the same as -m 15600 = Ethereum Wallet, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256  (I say the same as -m 15600 because also 15600 uses a large number of iteration of pbkdf2 and a final keccak hashing step)... except that we need to AES decrypt the encseed field (with AES-256-CBC) to get the raw seed.\nI was suprised that this algorithm is actually so easy, because from the description above it seemed to me that much more was involved here... but as said it is basically just the same as -m 15600 (with an additional AES decrypt step and slightly different settings for pbkdf2).\nI think that this is really easy to add, not sure why nobody added it yet (maybe others were also confused about all this genwallet and pubtopriv stuff which is not used at all ... or it is just not that common to have these presale hashes anymore because they were just used for a very short time). Can anybody find out what the length of the seed normally is?\nI see that john the ripper has example hashes with 64-16 bytes seed and 624-16 bytes of seed (the 16 bytes are used for the initialization vector):\nhttps://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/4f7824e3e05120c9eb6735844f36867431997f6f/src/ethereum_common_plug.c#L25-L28\nOther source code files mention that it is a sha256 () hash over some entropy data:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/pyethsaletool/blob/6fe7254d7109e7677c5fcafb7873cacff9d0e2a5/pyethsaletool.py#L213\nhttps://github.com/vbuterin/pybitcointools/blob/aeb0a2bbb8bbfe421432d776c649650eaeb882a5/bitcoin/main.py#L416\nI'm not sure which software generates the longer seed.\nWhat software do/did you use and what is/was the length of the seed? Is it of fixed length? Is it 608 bytes (624-16) long or just 48 bytes (64-16) long?\nIt's okay if you do not know the raw seed, it's enough if we know the normal length of the encseed (encrypted seed).. @branmcf yeah, thanks for the confirmation. That's also what I saw what most modern software for ethereum generates.... it seems that some time ago the encseed was much shorter, e.g. 128 hex chars (64 bytes)\nIt shouldn't matter too much because hashcat now supports all these lengths for the encseed decryption.\nAgain, you could just extract the \"hash\" from the json file with ethereum2john.py (and remove the file names and colons if any are present) and run it with -m 16300 with hashcat (betas are already up on https://hashcat.net/beta). @anormore\nHey,\nI don't think this is the right place to discuss how to get hashcat working.\nI would suggest that you go to https://hashcat.net/forum and https://hashcat.net/faq and https://hashcat.net/wiki/ to try to understand how you setup hashcat correctly.\nIt's not a good idea to start a discussion here on how to get hashcat working with hash mode -m 16300 to crack the presale ethereum wallets. This is a github issue (feature request) with the goal to implement this new algorithm in hashcat.\nAnyways, to get you started:\n1. for now you need to use the beta from (https://hashcat.net/beta)\n2. you need to install your OpenCL drivers correctly (for OpenCL CPU or OpenCL GPUs)\n3. you need to extract the beta version with 7-Zip\n4. you need to download ethereum2john.py from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/bleeding-jumbo/run/ethereum2john.py .\n5. you need to install python2.7 (and setup the PATH environment variable under windows to get python working within cmd)\n6. run this command: python ethereum2john.py my_wallet.json\n7. you need to copy the output of ethereum2john.py to a file (e.g. hash.txt), make sure there are no file names within the hash. The hash should look similar to the one that you can find here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes (search for 16300)\n8. you need to run hashcat something like this: hashcat -m 16300 -a 0 -w 3 hash.txt dict.txt\n  . \nCould you please perform a further test for us (just to double-check some of our most recent disoveries):\n```\nmake clean\ngit checkout 52c1e15f3f5b0f50c8ccce3b8b9c604941fe8a57\nmake\nhashcat -m 2500 -b\nnote down the speed1\n```\nand:\n```\nmake clean\ngit checkout 56dc8ae3598b059b9a7fe11859ebbec087d6cfab\nmake\nhashcat -m 2500 -b\nnote down the speed2\n```\nand finally:\nmake clean\ngit checkout master\nmake\nplease let us know about the speed1 and speed2 results. I fully agree with neheb. This is very annoying/confusing.\nFortunately, I remember that github user name \"emwinkler\" from this other github issue https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1497 where I recently posted a comment.\nThe problem is, that you should always explicitly state what you are doing and why you are posting this benchmarks etc (my guess is that because I suspected that the other issue was a duplicate of this github issue, see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1497#issuecomment-362835124).\n... the context/explanation/description why you post a \"few benchmark numbers\" is very important... It's not always easy to keep track which user is affected by a (speed drop) problem and to guess why he is commenting/posting across different tickets.... so even I, who asked for this \"test\" in the other issue, was confused at the beginning and had to double check if the github user is the same across those 2 issues etc (and why s/he is posting this here).\nFurthermore, github allows you to use quoting/code markdown formatting... this would make all your post much more readable and understandable (otherwise it's difficult to see where the benchmark results start and where your description text is etc... it's just annoying extra work to see what is going on without the correct markdown formatting).\nIt seems at least for @emwinkler the 2 issues have the same root (unfortunately the original poster of #1497 , @guru431, is not the same github user and therefore it is just a guess that the s/he will have the same outcome/problem). I currently suspect that #1497 is a duplicate of this issue and that the speed drop was introduced by this commit 165380c454c80b3bcd428ba619a45893223585d0 but only on macOS AMD hardware (which is kind of strange and which should be investigated in detail).\nMaybe we can find someone, @emwinkler you ?, that helps us to interactively debug this problem for instance by running some tests together and chatting on the #hashcat IRC channel on freenode, because currently as far as I know not a single dev has a similar setup (macOS AMD hardware etc). That would probably help a lot. hmm, @soxrok2212 you should try the exact same version of hashcat that you used for your previous benchmark. Otherwise there could be too many factors that could influence the speed (besides new operating system, new driver ... also the changes for hashcat 4.1.0 etc).\n@emwinkler and/or @soxrok2212 could help us a lot by connecting to the freenode IRC channel and querying \"atom\" or me (\"philsmd\"). I think we can dig deeper to find the culprit. Again, I think it has to do with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/165380c454c80b3bcd428ba619a45893223585d0 and especially the changes in the _loop kernel function (e.g. sha1_transform_V () vs sha1_transform_vector ()). With an enourmous help from @soxrok2212 we found out a couple of hours ago that also -m 12000 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 is affected by the same speed drop problem as -m 2500 = WPA/WPA2 (only with these AMD drivers/cards on macOS).\nMaybe someone here can confirm this too and test if the speed was changed a lot around the commit 729c5f09bcd00c3a6e51387d152346c609525e9d (would also help a lot if we found out if the commit that introduced the problem was exactly at 729c5f09bcd00c3a6e51387d152346c609525e9d or some commits slightly before/after that commit).\nMaybe we should close the duplicate issues and rename the title of this issue to make it PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 specific ?\nCould it help to extend our search to even more algorithms by comparing a larger set of hash types (maybe 2 full benchmarks before and after those WPA/PBKDF2 commits)?. update:\nwe identified and fixed the -m 12000 problem with this fix: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/5391edca0d639f5dc330463b9505b7b8c1e4d063 (this change was the first to introduce the drop for -m 12000: 9de1e557bbf5172b60dbecfa22a45a29e562140d)\nThis \"sha1 problem\" was also affecting -m 2500 , but -m 2500 also seems to have heavily dropped in speed after this commit was merged: 165380c454c80b3bcd428ba619a45893223585d0 .\nWe currently suspect that the problem has to do with the fact that the macOS AMD driver (or OpenCL implementation) does not implement  amd_bytealign () and therefore the speed for instance of switch_buffer_by_offset_carry_be_S () is very slow). The driver does not report the device as \"AMD\" device the vendor id / platform is \"Apple\" and therefore hashcat sees it as a generic OpenCL device (which seems to be correct, because otherwise, i.e. if we mark it as AMD device, among others the amd_bytealign ()  function would be called, which is not available/implemented on macOS AMD systems).\nI think we still need to perform some further tests if we can somehow improve or work around the switch_buffer_by_offset_carry_be_S () problem.\nNote: switch_buffer_by_offset_carry_be_S () was not used with older version of hashcat for -m 2500, since older versions did not support very long passwords.\nThanks you again @soxrok2212 and @emwinkler for helping us to identify these problems. I think there is still a chance that we can somehow find a workaround... but it might require several further try-and-error-style tests.. Hmm, does a patch like the following fix the problem?\n```\ndiff --git a/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha1.cl b/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha1.cl\nindex 8caa33d..80b430e 100644\n--- a/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha1.cl\n+++ b/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha1.cl\n@@ -208,7 +208,9 @@ DECLSPEC void sha1_update_64 (sha1_ctx_t *ctx, u32 w0[4], u32 w1[4], u32 w2[4],\n     u32 c2[4] = { 0 };\n     u32 c3[4] = { 0 };\n\n\nifndef SKIP_SWITCH_BUFFER_WITH_CARRY\nswitch_buffer_by_offset_carry_be_S (w0, w1, w2, w3, c0, c1, c2, c3, pos);\n\n\nendif\nctx->w0[0] |= w0[0];\n ctx->w0[1] |= w0[1];\ndiff --git a/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha256.cl b/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha256.cl\nindex 49e1070..5375b9d 100644\n--- a/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha256.cl\n+++ b/OpenCL/inc_hash_sha256.cl\n@@ -193,7 +193,9 @@ DECLSPEC void sha256_update_64 (sha256_ctx_t *ctx, u32 w0[4], u32 w1[4], u32 w2[\n u32 c2[4] = { 0 };\n u32 c3[4] = { 0 };\n\n\nifndef SKIP_SWITCH_BUFFER_WITH_CARRY\n switch_buffer_by_offset_carry_be_S (w0, w1, w2, w3, c0, c1, c2, c3, pos);\n\n\n\nendif\nctx->w0[0] |= w0[0];\n ctx->w0[1] |= w0[1];\ndiff --git a/OpenCL/m02500.cl b/OpenCL/m02500.cl\nindex 468da9b..ee71042 100644\n--- a/OpenCL/m02500.cl\n+++ b/OpenCL/m02500.cl\n@@ -5,6 +5,8 @@\n\n\n#define NEW_SIMD_CODE\n+#define SKIP_SWITCH_BUFFER_WITH_CARRY\n+\n #include \"inc_vendor.cl\"\n #include \"inc_hash_constants.h\"\n #include \"inc_hash_functions.cl\"\n```\nTo test this:\n\nmake sure that you have a clean/unmodified version of hashcat\ncheck out the current master (git checkout 72fc708042a8b09900a1083f4333e14496d8ec28)\nstore the above code into a file called wpa.diff\nrun: \"make clean\" (just to make sure there are no cached kernel files)\nrun: \"git apply wpa.diff\"\nrun: \"make\"\ntest speed: hashcat -m 2500 -b\ntest if it still cracks: hashcat -m 2500 -a 3 hashcat.hccapx hashcat?s\n\n(hashcat.hccapx can be downloaded form the examle hashes page: https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes)\nThx . It should be actually very easy to find out if other OpenCL tools work with your setup... e.g. just run \"clinfo\" and see if it works.\nIf neither hashcat nor clinfo works, it's very likely that your setup is not configured correctly (or in this specific case that wayland doesn't work correctly together with the drivers of your graphics card). My guess is that it's not really hashcat-related, but please test it.\nThx. dev note: it seems that the chdir () is somehow overridden at some point in time.\nMy guess is that the problem has to do that the original folder path is only stored at the very beginning here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/418341b5859cbd27ae5d6d536a5c8caad805b402/src/folder.c#L488 , after that with --restore the current working directory could be overridden here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/8abd7ae9d1b378485a750725927bdcf0ea334da8/src/restore.c#L137 ... but the problem might be that we use folder_config->cwd (and do not set/override it correctly when restoring with --restore) to change back to the \"original\" folder here: change from this folder https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/b847bbb2743f9e117e1db0f0288c8e427a36cd9e/src/opencl.c#L4161 back to https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/b847bbb2743f9e117e1db0f0288c8e427a36cd9e/src/opencl.c#L4738-L4740\nThis is just a guess, we need to verify this.\nIf true there might be 2 solutions: either always update folder_config->cwd when using --restore or always use getcwd () and do not rely on folder_config->cwd when using the chdir () function.. Hey @extended11 ,\nas you can see the above fix was merged and should solve the problem.\nCould you please test and close the issue if the problem is fixed?\nThank you very much. Oh! Ha!\nUnfortunately, one does not simply write optimized kernel code by just running something like sed 's/sha1/sha256/g'\nHint: there are also different input/output lengths e.g. for the hex conversation etc. To make it very clear, sha256 hashes/digests \"are longer\" compared to sha1 hashes... this is just an example what is completely wrong in your kernels.\nYou are also missing a lot of host code changes, like entries in src/usage.c etc, please look at previous commits which did add a new hash type to hashcat to see what is required.\n... and before I forget it (and actually the most important thing!): thank you very much for your contribution!!!. Could you give more details about:\n1. your shared folder settings and/or src/Makefile changes\n2. where the correct /OpenCL/ path is located (from your output above we can see that hashcat is trying to search for /usr/bin/OpenCL/ but that path doesn't exist)\n3. my assumption also is that you use \"make install\" or something similar. Is that assumption correct?\nI think this new problem has to do with this recent change https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/344d1a37dfe3ce4ed751b5f0d68fde4aa93221de , but this has to be verified.\nThe double free problem might come from the fact that the folder_config and pidfile_ctx are not set to NULL and therefore after the freeing of the original folder_config/pidfile_ctx the error will force a return, but since hashcat_session_destroy () (https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/4b2f3011e91e4aec7f3b088ed8167f664a902bca/src/main.c#L1059) will call folder_config_destroy () again and the pointer is not NULL, it will try to free () the folder_config a second time. This has to be double-checked and debugged.\nAs you might already know, the output you posted above is kind of useless if it comes to debugging, we need the output of a debug version of hashcat e.g. compiled with \"make clean && make DEBUG=1 && make install\" (again I'm not sure if you used the \"install\" target). Without the debug symbols, we do not know where the crash occurs exactly.\n... but again, this is not the actual problem (this is just a result of a problem with the correct paths). The root of the problem (the main problem) is the incorrect path. The side effect (and actually a second problem) is that hashcat tries to free it one more time (maybe because not reset to NULL?). the problem is that the define for the shared folder: -DSHARED_FOLDER=\\\"$(SHARED_FOLDER)\\\"\nis only applied to the compilation of src/main.c and not to src/restore.c\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/66f7590883bf96f39aef74213a5e6e3bab58adef/src/Makefile#L392-L393\nThis is the actual problem and to fix it we either need to use the defines for all .c files (or at least for main.c AND restore.c) or we somehow pass is from main.c to restore.c (within the source code and therefore without the macros/defines).\nThe other bug we found by accident is that shared_dir, profile_dir, session_dir might all point to the same memory buffer here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/4b2f3011e91e4aec7f3b088ed8167f664a902bca/src/folder.c#L393-L395\nand if the first one is getting deleted, we can't delete it again and again (double/tripple free):\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/4b2f3011e91e4aec7f3b088ed8167f664a902bca/src/folder.c#L437-L440\nSo we now know the 2 sources of the 2 distinct problems. Now we need to find a clean solution for both. Yeah, not dirty if possible.\nThx. Well, it wasn't merged yet. You should wait until both commits are merged and retry it afterwards.\nIf it still works after the 2 commits were merged, please report back and close the github issue if fixed.\nThx. dev note:\nit seems that we are ignoring the return code (for instance) here (but there are more places within the code where the return code after the overflow detection must be checked):\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/08fc0ec1fb404f1c3685f8984e169ed749a0bb03/src/hashcat.c#L120\nWe need to investigate what should be done in such a situation (e.g. clean buffers and proceed with the next \"iteration\").. I think the problem is that in very, very, very rare situations the password could start with $HEX[ and end with ] (and have only hex characters in between, the length must be a multiple of 2).\nIf this is the case, hashcat converts the $HEX[] string into the raw string. Sometimes this could not be wanted, therefore @roycewilliams suggested that we add a new flag to turn off this automatically conversion of $HEX[] strings within the word list.\nmy suggestion is to introduce a new flag called something like --wordlist-autohex-disable to disable the automatical conversion of $HEX[] strings whenever the words from the word lists are read in. The --stdout option neither needs the hash type nor the hash list:\n$ ./hc -a 0 -r bug.rule --stdout words.dic. maybe you had pulled/cloned the repo some time ago and didn't use \"make clean\".\nYou could also try to use the beta (https://hashcat.net/beta/) to see if the problem also happens with pre-compiled code (the beta binaries).. Thank you very much.\nI've updated the FAQ page (https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#what_is_a_potfile) according to your suggestions.\nI know that it could be easier if the wiki is somehow editable... but at the end it's not a big problem because even if it would be editable the amount of change request is not that high and therefore reporting it here or on the hashcat forum worked so far. I'm not against an editable wiki. I just think it is not currently possible with the mediawiki system that is in use (and if it was editable we would probably need to fight spam or malicious change requests etc).\nIf you think it was correctly fixed, please do not forget to close the issue.\nThank you very much. We need much more details to understand this problem.\nFor instance, what operating system do you use? What type of prompt/shell do you use? cmd.exe?\nWhat version of hashcat do you use?\nWhich GPUs do you have? Which driver do you have installed? How did you install the driver? Did you install the drivers cleanly, downloads from amd.com/nvidia.com?\netc, etc. Does it behave similar to the problem reported here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6202-post-35411.html#pid35411 ? Does the problem only happen if the intel opencl driver is installed?\nDoes it also happen if you do not use putty (or do not remotely connect to the computer)?. If I'm not totally mistaken, there was some guy on the hashcat's IRC channel #hashcat that recently said that by deleting 1 of the files shipped by the intel package, he was able to still use the Intel OpenCL and AMD/Nvidia OpenCL devices without the problem with the non-interacting hashcat process.\nUnfortunately, I can't remember what file it was and how difficult it was to get it working.\nThe problem is that this seems to have nothing to do with hashcat and we can't do anything to fix it. It's a problem of the Intel driver.\nMaybe you can try to troubleshoot it and come up with a howto tutorial on how to fix it (even with working Intel CPUs)?\nI'm not sure what is going on with the driver and why it makes the hashcat process non-interactive.\nI can't think that it is hashcat's fault since it works flawlessly with all other setups.\nI'm not sure if it makes sense to keep this issue open... but a howto/tutorial on forum etc would be nice if we can find out how to fix it (while keeping the Intel OpenCL driver working and Intel CPUs useable).\nIt's not even clear if it only happens with Intel + AMD or if it is a general problem with Intel driver (but I also have the Intel OpenCL drivers installed on some systems and never experienced any problems with it, so there must be some combination of installed drivers that trigger this problem).. Thanks @roycewilliams for the relevant log line...\nUnfortuately, that sounds worse than I remembered: I thought it was working with both Intel/AMD after the user removed some files (but from the quote above it seems that the Intel driver wasn't working anymore i.e. \"without the driver ofcourse\")... Therefore, this \"fix\" is actually not better than removing the Intel OpenCL driver completely.\nI'm pretty sure there must be some culprit and some (hashcat-external) fix. Again, I don't think that this is hashcat's fault or that hashcat can do anything about it.. What's the version of hashcat that you use?\nWhat's your command line parameters?\nDid you try with other attack types? Did you try with different masks etc?\nBTW: some users make the mistake to use something like \"./hashcat -m 1000 hash -a 3 hashcat\"\nbut they forget that whenever there is a file called \"hashcat\" in this particular directory, the mask will be seen as a mask file\nFurthermore, newest versions of hashcat (beta, see https://hashcat.net/beta/) have self-tests enabled and therefore you will see a warning whenever there is a problem with the kernels (false negatives) etc. Hey,\nit is explained here https://hashcat.net/wiki/?id=mask_attack#hashcat_mask_files:\nIt is not allowed that a [mask] contains ?1,?2,?3 or ?4 references without those being set via [?1], [?2], [?3], [?4]. This will result in an error message. If you want to use a custom charset for your masks you must define it within the same line of the hcmask file by using the [?1], [?2], [?3], [?4] fields.\nThis means that you need to define the custom charset directly within the .hcmask file (only if you use  at least one out of ?1 ?2 ?3 ?4 within your mask).\nThis was actually recently changed (in the past it also worked with the custom charset defined on the command line) because users forgot to set the customer charset within the .hcmask line and where confused why hashcat uses \"a different custom charset\" etc... Furthermore, previous versions also used the \"default charsets\" whenever no charsets were defined and this made it even more confusing for the user which couldn't figure out what was going on.\nI think this change makes sense... the only problem is: whenever the user wants to use a set of (up to 4) custom charset for each and every mask within the .hcmask file... then the .hcmask file must be prepended with the same custom charsets on each and every line (but I guess this is a good compromise and doesn't make anything slower or something like this... it is just much more easier to troubleshoot and understand).\nso your mymask.hcmask file must look like this:\n-_.,?d?d?d?d?l?1\n-_.,?d?d?d?1?l?d\nand your command line must look like this:\n./hashcat64.bin -m 0 -a 7 --outfile results.txt --status mymask.hcmask mywordlist.txt\n. Glad it works for you now too (with the correct syntax).\nPlease do not forget to close the issue if you are sure the problem is fixed/resolved (only the repo owner or the OP can close github issues here).. your hash works perfectly fine if I put \"haha866:1b711e4b87c9a950d02594c4e7ff7ca5:|y<\" (without quotes) within a file hash.txt and use the command:\n./hashcat64.bin -m 2611 -a 0 --username hash.txt rockyou.txt\nto output the results in username:plain format, you can use this command:\n./hashcat64.bin -m 2611 --show --outfile-format 2 --username hash.txt\nTherefore, the single hash works... maybe you have a hash file that consist of several different hash types etc... so you need to clean it and find out which hashes are using -m 2611 and which hashes do not etc\nhashcat won't/can't do that job for you... the input must be correct. If it is not correct, you will see a warning.\nBTW: it's not a good idea to make 2 forum posts and one github issue about the exact same problem:  https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6877.html , https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6873-post-36693.html#pid36693 and https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1362 . This type of eager behaviour actually should be punished (forum ban?) and you should be glad that nevertheless someone took there precious free time to answer you at all... don't be a d*ck.. As the wiki section that you linked already explains, to display all cracks with the corresponding username you need to run 2 commands (one after the other):\n1. crack with --username\n2. --show --username\nThe first one saves the results (cracks) to hashcat.potfile and the second one uses the hashcat.potfile and looks for all hashes that are present in both your original hash file and the pot file and combines it with the usernames.\nYou could try to use the beta (https://hashcat.net/beta/) which has different limits for -m 2611/2711.\nAt this point... I don't think that this problem is a code issue at all. You just need to read the wiki/forum and other resources to learn how to use hashcat correctly.\nThe github issues here are for code issues, not user questions.\nI would therefore say that you/we should close the issue here.\nThx. this is a duplicate of #69 . let's step back a little bit and discuss this:\ncan you please explain why you really need more output?\n20 bytes should be long enough to make sure that the password is indeed the correct one. From that perspective there is no need to have a longer output length.\nThe only valid reason for a longer output would be if you need to re-use the longer-than-20-byte output for further computation at later steps.\nSo what exactly is you reason you need to have longer output ? Do you need to do further computation with the output?\nI think this discussion is not really suitable here. This is not a hashcat issue. It might fit in the Developer section of the hashcat.net forum. I don't think this is a problem of hashcat. This is just a general question. It is not a hashcat issue.. When you see this prompt:\n[s]tatus [p]ause [r]esume [b]ypass [c]heckpoint [q]uit =>\nyou should press the key \"c\" (without quotes) and your status (to see it press \"s\", without quotes) should change to \nStatus...........: Running (Checkpoint Quit requested)\nafter that you need to wait until the next checkpoint was reached (could take some time depending on your attack type and number of hashes etc).\nBTW: this is not the correct place to ask questions. Github issues are only intended for problems/feature requests/development stuff. Please close the issue and (if you really can't figure it out at all with all the documentation wiki/faq/hashcat forums) you can open a new thread on the hashcat forum. Thx. This is confusing. We already have a hccalloc () function.. I think this problem was solved by using the --opencl-device-types (short -D) command line parameter.\n@globbergouhl can you please close the issue if you think this problem is solved?. could it be that this patch introduces some memory leaks?\nWhenever we use asprintf () we also should free () the buffer afterwards.\nThe problem only happens when there were buffers on the stack beforehand (where the buffers automatically wen't out of scope and therefore deleted) and now we use asprintf which uses the heap (where we do need to make sure to call free ()).. It should be easy to replace the:\n-r, --regexp-extended     use extended regular expressions in the script.\nwe currently use with a different regular expression for sed that does not need the \"-r\" option. are you sure that this old CPU (Core Duo) even supports OpenCL ?\nIt seems that the drivers do support only i3 or newer (or xeon CPUs).\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647567/opencl-sdk-for-intel-core-2-due/16650270#16650270. This problem might be related to the recent patch for this issue: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1403\nThe patch was successfully tested on a mac mini.\nIt's also interesting to note that the format of the \"VERSION_EXPORT\" variable did change which would make this sed command behave incorrectly.\nThe replace from the \"git archive\" for version 3.6 was:\nVERSION_EXPORT          := tag: v3.6.0, refs/pull/1273/head\nwhile the format for the new source tar.gz is:\nVERSION_EXPORT          := HEAD -> master, tag: v4.0.0\nTherefore the sed which is looking for \"v\" + some numbers (and dots) + \",\" is not correct anymore.. reverting c6d7fc8 is not an option, because we do not want to have the hard coded \"4.0.0-rc6\" within the Makefile. My conclusion is, that since we have no more a tag like this:\n\": v4.0.0,\"\nbut only this substring:\n\": v4.0.0\"\n(without the comma \",\", and the tag information could be at the end)\n... my suggestion is that we replace this:\nsed 's/.*: v\\([\\.0-9]*\\),.*/v\\1/'\nby\nsed 's/.*: v\\([\\.0-9]*\\).*/v\\1/'\n(no comma needed). @ilovezfs could you please test with the newest git version? The above commit #1430 should fix the parallel build problem.\nThx. With which version of hashcat did you try it?\nHashcat 4.0 supports a length of up to 256 characters.\nThe hash file needs to contain hash:salt i.e\nhexhash:#XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX-\nIt's working perfectly fine here with a little test:\n$ cat hash.txt\n5f4cdf48b7579100ac9e0fe6ffe73ebf85b99200181033d371151cefab72190a:#12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc-\n$ ./hashcat -m 1420 -a 3 hash.txt ?lashcat\n5f4cdf48b7579100ac9e0fe6ffe73ebf85b99200181033d371151cefab72190a:#12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc-:hashcat. This is not an error, but just a notice/hint. It means, whenever you are trying to use optimized kernels (with the -O option) and the kernel itself only comes with one variant (instead of both: optimized and also a specialized kernel supporting lengths > 31 or > 55), it will display this hint/warning. It's not an error message.\nYou could just look at the OpenCL/ folder if there are many files starting with OpenCL/m02500* it means that there are 2 variants of the kernel (and therefore using -O and not using -O makes a difference).\nBTW:\n< sarcasm >\nthis seems to be a high quality issue: very appropriate, easy to find and clever title and an issue description that already speaks for itselfs and includes already the answer to the question\n< /sarcasm > I'm just kidding, ;)\nBut, jokes apart, maybe (\"noob\") questions like this shouldn't be posted on github since devs could use the time they spent to answer such question with more challenging and important things, like solving really important issues/bugs and/or implementing new hash types or features.\ndon't get me wrong... it's not only you that asks some very basic things like this on github... and it's totally fine to better ask to be sure. I can see your point of view too!!!\n...it's also a little bit annoying that for instance I can't close this issue right now. The current permission system only allows you (the original poster, OP), or the owner (atom, jsteube) to close this issue.\nSo we either need to wait that you close it or ask a further person to spent some time here, just to close the issue. I stop my rant here ;)\nHave a nice day.. Can you please explain with some descriptive text what the problem is that you are experiencing?\nIt's not clear from the title/picture what kind of problem you have.\nThx. Can you please tell us which version of hashcat you use? It should be at least 4.0 . Hey\nthanks for the report.\nI've suggested a fix here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1436\nBTW: always make sure that whenever you report a problem with example hashes, that the passwords are also mentioned (especially in this case where one would need to have the hash:pass combination within the file hashcat.potfile) . I'm clever/experienced enough to work around this problem, by either generating a similar hash for which I know the password and/or just writting a wrong hash:pass combination into the hashcat.potfile (this works, because hashcat doesn't validate that the \"crack\" is correct, since it assumes that whatever is in the hashcat.potfile is always correct. It would be a waste of resources to crack/validate the hashes in the potfile again and again).\nFurthermore, we are not willing (or always able in a short amount of time) to crack the user's/reporter's hashes. In short, do not forget to post the password too in the future. Otherwise we might even need to assume that you do not know the password and just report a problem such that others crack hashes for you (this happened a lot in the past, I'm not saying that this is the case here, but other people are trying to trick people like this)\nThank you very much\nBest. I did some very quick research on this (I hope that everything mentioned below is correct, feel free to independently verify it and correct me):\nThis feature is also called (also internally in the keepass sources etc) as WUA = Windows User Account.\nThe main setting file of keepass (.xml) stores this setting as\n<UserAccount>true</UserAccount>\nSome information about WUA is also mentioned here https://keepass.info/help/base/keys.html#winuser and there you can find links to https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/wiki/Recover%20Windows%20User%20Account%20Credentials/\nThe concept of this protected data is also known as the Data Protection application programming interface (DPAPI).\nWindows saves the WUA Master Key(s) here:\nWUA Master Key: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Protect\\<SID>\\  (the long file, not the \"Preferred\" file)\nwhere %APPDATA% is just\n%APPDATA%: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\\nThe keepass specific ProtectedData (DPAPI) blob is stored in this file:\n%APPDATA%\\KeePass\\ProtectedUserKey.bin\nIf we look at the keepass source code, we can find a KeePassLib/Keys/KcpUserAccount.cs file that is responsible to write and read the ProtectedUserKey.bin.\nTo generate the data (if the file did not exist yet), it uses the following steps:\n- generate a 64-byte long byte array by using CryptoRandom.Instance.GetRandomBytes(64)\n- and use the windows API ProtectedData.Protect () (see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2fh8203k(v=vs.110).aspx) with the constant entropy (16 bytes):\nde135b5f18a34670b2572429698898e6\nMy conclusion is that what we need to do to add support for it is to have the 64-bytes of data from ProtectedData.Unprotect () somewhere within the hash (or command line option). These 64 bytes need to be appended to the sha256 ($pass) + keyfile (optional)\nIt seems the order is\n1. sha256 ($pass)\n2. 32 bytes for the keyfile settings (optional)\n3. 64 bytes unprotected-data for the WUA settings (optional)\nbtw: there seems to be also a new jtr issue with the same request of implementing this WUA feature: see https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/issues/2863\n\nupdate: I was interested enough to give this seemingly minor modification that needs to be done a try and here are some more info and code:\nI generateted a new Keepass Database (with newest Keepass 2.37, but the version shouldn't matter to much for now, it just should be at least 2.x I think).\nAfter selecting the \"User Account\" option when creating a new database, the %APPDATA%\\KeePass\\ folder containing the ProtectedUserKey.bin was created.\nThe content of the file in hex was in my case (this of course depends on the computer/user account, it's always different for a new account, it remains the same if you \"just\" change your windows password): \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\nI've used this code to convert it to the unprotected version:\n```#include \ninclude \ninclude \ndefine MY_ENCODING_TYPE  (PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING | X509_ASN_ENCODING)\nint main ()\n{\n  DATA_BLOB DataIn;\n  DataIn.pbData = (BYTE *) \"\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xd0\\x8c\\x9d\\xdf\\x01\\x15\\xd1\\x11\\x8c\\x7a\\x00\\xc0\\x4f\\xc2\\x97\\xeb\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0f\\xdf\\x04\\x15\\x2e\\xb7\\x7d\\x41\\xae\\x75\\x73\\xc2\\x64\\xa4\\x46\\xba\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x10\\x66\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x20\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xd7\\x42\\xaf\\x90\\xdd\\xc4\\x42\\x8f\\xd2\\x9e\\x4d\\x1a\\x9d\\x26\\x11\\xd4\\x7d\\xf2\\x23\\xba\\xd7\\x9a\\x84\\x41\\x34\\x77\\x97\\x82\\x93\\xd0\\x3c\\x4e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0e\\x80\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x20\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x5c\\xb8\\xca\\xeb\\x15\\xd6\\x8f\\xcd\\xa0\\x06\\x37\\x52\\x6d\\x45\\x84\\x75\\x07\\x76\\x12\\x6a\\xf1\\xd3\\x84\\x7d\\x5b\\xb8\\xc5\\xe9\\xda\\x38\\x39\\xbd\\x50\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x17\\x1f\\xa4\\x03\\x75\\x38\\x33\\x69\\x1a\\x36\\x20\\x44\\x60\\x9b\\xab\\xb9\\x36\\xd4\\xbe\\x81\\xdf\\xa4\\x63\\xe1\\xfc\\x29\\x26\\x81\\xa7\\x1d\\xb3\\x8e\\x7d\\x21\\x39\\x4b\\x13\\x86\\x5a\\xa4\\x0e\\x6f\\x91\\xd3\\xf7\\x3b\\x46\\x8c\\xb0\\xfc\\x96\\x8b\\xaa\\xcf\\xaf\\x7f\\xb8\\x26\\x79\\x06\\xc3\\x2a\\x2a\\x51\\x72\\x96\\x61\\x8c\\xbf\\x07\\xc8\\xf8\\xdb\\x88\\xc6\\x5c\\x7f\\xb5\\x2d\\xba\\x40\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x3b\\xc9\\x0d\\x6a\\xcd\\xe4\\xfe\\x76\\x41\\x03\\xd4\\xd0\\x3b\\xb0\\x87\\x26\\x6b\\x2b\\xdb\\x18\\x2d\\x1e\\x59\\x44\\x25\\x05\\xac\\x60\\x45\\x0f\\xcd\\xf1\\xa7\\x83\\x05\\xd4\\x2f\\x63\\xdf\\x18\\xed\\x8e\\xa7\\xa5\\x04\\xc8\\x05\\xbe\\xcb\\x38\\xf6\\xf0\\x02\\x4b\\xaf\\xb3\\xa9\\x0a\\x29\\xe9\\xb1\\x54\\xb4\\xb2\"  \"\\x00\";\n  DataIn.cbData = 294;\nDATA_BLOB entropy;\n  entropy.pbData = (BYTE *) \"\\xde\\x13\\x5b\\x5f\\x18\\xa3\\x46\\x70\\xb2\\x57\\x24\\x29\\x69\\x88\\x98\\xe6\"  \"\\x00\";\n  entropy.cbData = 16;\nDATA_BLOB DataOut;\n  LPWSTR pDescrOut = NULL;\nif (CryptUnprotectData (&DataIn, &pDescrOut, &entropy, NULL, NULL, 0, &DataOut))\n  {\n    // printf (\"The description of the data was: %S\\n\", pDescrOut);\nprintf (\"The decrypted data length is: %i\\n\", DataOut.cbData);\n\nprintf (\"The decrypted data is: \");\n\nunsigned int i = 0;\n\nfor (i = 0; i < DataOut.cbData; i++)\n{\n  printf (\"%02x\", DataOut.pbData[i]);\n}\n\nprintf (\"\\n\");\n\n}\n  else\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"An error while decrypting the data. \\n\");\n  }\nreturn 0;\n}\nI compiled it like this:\nx86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -m64 protected_data_unprotect.cpp -o protected_data_unprotect.exe -lcrypt32\n```\nNote: this program needs to be run on the correct windows computer where the DPAPI master key file etc is used to unprotect the content. Also note that DataIn.pbData could easily be read from a file (I just didn't bother too much to add the code for opening/reading the file for now). Furthermore, entropy.pbData seems to be constant/static and doesn't need to be changed. The user only needs to modify DataIn.pbData (or someone could add the code to read these bytes from the ProtectedUserKey.bin file).\nRunning the  protected_data_unprotect.exe program yielded this for me (this of course also depends on your data and windows account, it's different from you, but the length should be always 64):\nThe decrypted data length is: 64\nThe decrypted data is: 591674cc5fb167aa5f9e55c0a96cd66fadeb02366215d731364b19603a36b3b779c6e3b9dbf3027fd34c074b4c15c4a6efaf172933afd46dcaf2e6f9d911fcfc\nThis seems to be all what we need, i.e. the additional 64 bytes (unprotected version of the bytes from ProtectedUserKey.bin).\nI tested to crack my database with keepass2john + hashcat.\nThe current patch (that was successfully applied to this version fddb66eb1be99ea6cf2a01dfc1928a0e2de12437) is:\nhttps://gist.github.com/philsmd/36a38c1527293da3fb4848c3ef1d0aa9\nthere are a couple of todos for now:\n1. the protected_data_len needs to be read from the host code (it somehow needs to depend on the hash)\n2. the data after this if statement:  if (protected_data_len > 0) of course also needs to be dynamic and supplied by the user (and past by the host code)\nfor now this is just a POC and those TODOs need to be implemented by choosing a new hash format and implementing the modified parser (and passing the data to the GPU)\nI have these 2 hashes for you to test (I used keepass2john to convert the databases, both Databases used the same ProtectedUserKey.bin and therefore my patch with the currently hard-coded 64-bytes work for both):\n1. with \"Windows User Account\" setting but without keyfile (password is \"hashcat\", without quotes):\n$keepass$*2*60000*0*a4f18d89fe227b96fd435aa4da26d856b1a3f7951a85fd6350730bb84e8b6113*fbce34b2a9f882d27f02a16afd6e02133ca3681903715766e92e4738a2ca2341*10fd77ccb982b386ba91b52063d5bd22*657adcda06deb085367c6705d68f072156082ec8aefddfedce8501b44e1f9c5b*e7a2bc6acbd0c20945fffce5ff70c8f41e77eb3c5987cad431db69d0bc24bd9b\n2. with \"Windows User Account\" setting and with keyfile (password is \"hashcat!\", without quotes):\n$keepass$*2*60000*0*5e96fa939c3ca427c6afca68c865aebb3c98f5ea1c7e1e87e94c2042b7ed6376*2e1769b64f582de6252bd901975a19e59056275e4c79f3f14883f1e3fb90fa27*d2a38c754f6eff1fcdb667a967cf5fd5*25c76ba25e65e367597c98418c49cf66a10204c528f43a316b34fca5de896684*fe57adc05093db6c4d63c7923738e893c1e36d2dcfe04a95449e954180bce0e9*1*64*74eb49f8ec2e021d17b6b6a032cdb19e6f11c1acff670c232bfd53be9c07c94f\nboth crack perfectly fine.\nThis means it's actually very easy to add support for it.\nThe only bummers for now are:\n1. keepass2john needs to be modified to support reading the ProtectedUserKey.bin file and generate a different hash with these additional 64 bytes\n2. the unprotected data from ProtectedUserKey.bin needs, as said, be extracted on the actual machine it was first generated (and also with the correct user account that was used while the database was generated). This of course implies that in case of a hard disk failure you have to get back access to all this information (the WUA master key and the ProtectedUserKey.bin file). Just the access to the file  ProtectedUserKey.bin doesn't mean that you can somehow unprotect it. You also need to have the window's WUA master key.\n3. It doesn't seem that we can figure out from just the .kdbx file whether WUA was used or not. This means that you either have the original %APPDATA%/KeePass/KeePass.config.xml where this information could be recovered (because the default/last options are stored for convenience), or you need to test all combinations: pass, pass+keyfile, pass+WUA, pass+keyfile+WUA\nThx. Here is a slightly modified version of the extraction c++ file that uses the %APPDATA% environment variable and reads the file ProtectedUserKey.bin directly (using stat/fopen/fread/fclose):\n```\ninclude \ninclude \ninclude \ninclude \ndefine MY_ENCODING_TYPE  (PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING | X509_ASN_ENCODING)\nint main ()\n{\n  char *appdata = getenv (\"APPDATA\");\nchar file_name[2049];\nsnprintf (file_name, 2049, \"%s\\Keepass\\ProtectedUserKey.bin\", appdata);\nstruct stat st;\nif (stat (file_name, &st) != 0)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"ERROR: Could not determine the file size of the file '%s'.

Very good.\nI think that to make any progress here we need to ask @magnumripper / @kholia (and also CC: @Fist0urs ) what we should do about the hash format changes that are needed and what they plan to do to support this in jtr etc.\nOf course we could just invent a new hash format with 64 bytes added (64 bytes longer than the normal format), but I think it is a good idea to see if keepass2john will be changed in the future to support this and also to generate the new hash format etc.\nThe algorithm and kernel/code modification should be clear from the examples above. The extraction of the 64 bytes should also be no problem with the code provided above. It's now just a matter of when/if this will be supported also by keepass2john and if so are there several different types of hashes or just one hash format that contains the 64 bytes (or not if wua is not used etc).\nI think hashcat could adapt its parser to the output of keepass2john quite easily (if it changes in the future).\nThis jtr issue might be good to follow too since it might be re-opened in the future (we will see): https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/issues/2555. yes we could just add the 64 bytes.\nUnfortunately there are many variants possible:\n1. pass\n2. pass+keyfile\n3. pass+wua\n4. pass+keyfile+wua\nso maybe we should add an additional field at the end (always or just when wua is being used).\nIn theory we could differentiate if the additional data is for keyfile or for wua just depending on the length (keyfile are always 32 bytes, while wua always uses 64 bytes).\nWe could also think about always printing all fields or not ... or somehow add an identifier such that it is clear if the data is from the keyfile or from the unprotected data file.\nAn additional question is, does keepass2john plan to add both support for:\n1. adding the 64 bytes via a command line option (--wua 64-hex-bytes-here)\n2. using something like the source code above to automatically unprotect the data (if the user is using the machine were the protected data was generated).\nI think both cases would somehow make sense because without case number 2 the user might not know how to extract the data (if he didn't read the steps/examples above).\nAn additional problem would be that you only would be able to compile this code (case 2) on a windows machine or with some cross-compiler (mingw on linux) and of course it will only run on windows systems. Therefore case 2 is just for .exe files I think.. That's great.\nI just realized I didn't answer your question about the additional 64 bytes and if they can be seen as a longer keyfile. Yes this is absolutely true! We could think about it like this if we consider the cases above:\n1. pass  => 0 bytes\n2. pass+keyfile => 32 bytes\n3. pass+wua => 64 bytes\n4. pass+keyfile+wua => 32+64 = 96 bytes\nSo in theory for the crackers it doesn't matter if the additional data comes from a keyfile of from wua. The crackers just need to support 0 to 96 bytes (at the time of writing this, maybe this will be increased in the future, but I don't think anytime soon), possible values are 0, 32, 64 or 96 bytes for the additional data.. Unfortunately, the output you posted doesn't really help to troubleshoot this. We need to know what happened and where exactly it crashed, only having the stack pointer (sp), instruction pointer (ip) etc doesn't help much to see what happened.\nThe problem is that it could also be very independent from hashcat itself, i.e. it could be an ASIC hang a crash within the driver code (all external from hashcat) etc\nYes, a full run build with make DEBUG=1, maybe even with backtrack (but this would require running it with gdb), would help to see what happened here.. Is this a duplicate of https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/411 ?. you could just use -m 4700 = sha1(md5($pass)) and append the salt with rules etc. This of course only works sufficiently if the hash list is small (ideally only one hash is used).\nIf you really want that this new hashing algorithm gets implemented you need to provide much more information.\nImportant information that is required would be: where is this hash type used in? are there any limitations of salt length/password length etc. Hey\nThanks for the report\nI can confirm and reproduce this. It doesn't seem that the actual content (the hexadecimal characters within $HEX[]) has something to do with it. It happens all the time when $HEX[] is used within the potfile.\nThis problem might have to do with this recent patch https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a4616e6c6d2b69aa4e4c39f6bccc339eea9a8655\nThe above patch fixed the situation that whenever the actual plain was using \"$HEX[\" and ending with \"]\" we had to hexify it.\nWell, for --show it is different because we do not apply this logic again (e.g. we do not need to hex $HEX[] passwords, because the potfile already has the correct version). We do not need to modify it at all when using --show.\nI think a special case must be added when using --show or (this needs to be tested) skip need_hexify () completely whenever the user used --show (because in theory the potfile handling/writing already hexified it, if needed).\nThanks again.. This is a known \"feature\". If you want to use shorter words mangled with rules, you should use this:\nhashcat --stdout -r rule.txt dict.txt | hashcat -m 2500 -a 0 hashes.hccapx. Hey,\nThank you very much for the report.\nThis patch is of course acceptable and seems to solve the problem reported on the hashcat forum: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7013.html\nI found a problem that could lead to random crashes when applying this patch. But this patch itself isn't responsible for the random crashes.\nI've investigated it a little bit and it seems that we need to increase the following buffers to allow cracking longer hashes:\n1) https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/c8819e6e8b2f1d82fb4dd22a98002886912fd0db/include/types.h#L1931 (because copied here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/c8819e6e8b2f1d82fb4dd22a98002886912fd0db/src/event.c#L50)\n2) https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/c8819e6e8b2f1d82fb4dd22a98002886912fd0db/src/hashes.c#L1556 (because copied here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/c8819e6e8b2f1d82fb4dd22a98002886912fd0db/src/outfile.c#L433)\n3) and finally the temp buffer for the out_buf: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/c8819e6e8b2f1d82fb4dd22a98002886912fd0db/src/hashes.c#L1562\nHCBUFSIZ_LARGE is currently \"only\" 20480 bytes large (see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/c8819e6e8b2f1d82fb4dd22a98002886912fd0db/include/common.h#L107) while for -m 11600 we need a hash buffer that is more than 655056 bytes large (see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/c8819e6e8b2f1d82fb4dd22a98002886912fd0db/include/interface.h#L1211)\nHCBUFSIZ_TINY is of course even less than HCBUFSIZ_LARGE, therefore we might need to change char old_buf[MAX_OLD_EVENTS][HCBUFSIZ_TINY]; to use HCBUFSIZ_LARGE and increase HCBUFSIZ_LARGE?\nIt would make sense to fix this reason for possible crashes first and afterwards apply this patch.\nThx. @neheb thank you very much for the suggestion. The problem here is that scrypt is one of the GPU unfriendliest algorithm currenlty supported by hashcat.\nIt could make sense to run -m 15700 with a very fast CPU with OpenCL support. The problem mainly is memory usage with very high cost factors (yes, this has also to do with tmto).\nEven on a 1080ti (one of the best GPUs on the market) this hashing algorithm is kinda difficult to run. This doesn't depend much on hashcat, but on the algorithm itself. It is designed to be GPU unfriendly and those high cost factors make it even worse.. can't reproduce. Can you give more details about your system.\nIs this an apple system?\nWhat type of OpenCL device (CPU/GPU) and which make/model do you use?. Are there any other strange characters within the path?\nTry to download a fresh copy directly to C:\\ and extract it there such that you have this folder:\nC:\\hashcat-4.0.1\\OpenCL. Do you have any Intel CPU OpenCL driver installed?\nWhat does you setup look like (GPU / CPU)?\nWe saw some similar behaviour with intel drivers and AMD systems.\nI think the problem there was that whenever the Intel OpenCL driver was installed hashcat was not interactive anymore (no key presses where registered etc).\nIf you have the Intel OpenCL driver installed, please try to use only your GPU driver (if possible) and therefore uninstall the Intel OpenCL driver for testing this.\nThanks. good that this problem was kind of resolved.\nPlease note that only you - the original reporter OP - (or the project owner) can close issues.\nCould you please close the issue if you think that the problem is solved. thx . 1. uninstall mesa\n2. uninstall pocl (if both mesa and pocl were already pre-installed and you use Kali linux, make sure that you switch to a different operating system that makes it easier to work with OpenCL/hashcat, like ubuntu)\n3. make sure that the correct driver is installed from nvidia.com (as recommended on https://hashcat.net/hashcat)\n4. use hccapx for -m 2500 = WPA/WPA2 , the hccap file format is superseded since ages\n5. do not report user problems here. use the FAQ (https://hashcat.net/faq/ ) the wiki (https://hashcat.net/wiki/) and the forum search (https://hashcat.net/forum/) instead\n6. close this issue since it doesn't report a bug/problem or requests a new feature/algorithm\nIssues here are meant for development and bugs, not for problems where the user didn't install the drivers as recommended (https://hashcat.net/faq#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do). Sorry, what do you want to do with android? cracking on a android device?\nI don't think that is a good idea if we think about the battery, the temperature issues, OpenCL support etc. Which cpu do you have?\nDo you also have a GPU (graphics card) which would be much faster? Intel GPUs are not recommended, use an modern Nvidia or AMD GPU\nThe drivers for the Intel CPU runtime can be found here: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers#latest_CPU_runtime. You should use --opencl-device-types 1 (or short -D 1) to crack with your CPU.\nYour GPU has not enough resources (mainly the huge amount of VRAM memory needed for scrypt) to crack ethereum scrypt hashes (-m 15700 = Ethereum Wallet, Scrypt) . no an upgrade of the RAM (system volatile memory) doesn't help much if you want to use your GPUs. The VRAM (GPU memory) is much more important.\nThe hashing algorithm scrypt with those very high costs/settings is known to be GPU-unfriendly. I'm not totally sure if a 1080ti has enough VRAM to be able to run -m 15700 (fast enough). Everything below a 1080ti (which has 11GB, but only part of that can be used by OpenCL... but there is even a nice workaround that hashcat uses with multiple memory allocations) is probably not able to run -m 15700, I guess. Again, I'm not sure if a 1080ti (is able to run -m 15700 fast enough and) is much faster for -m 15700 as a modern high-end CPU.\nWhat also matters a lot are the cost settings for scrypt (but as far as I know for -m 15700 they are mostly the same for all hashes and .... very high settings)... therefore scrypt with a specific set of settings could be very different compared to scrypt with much higher cost settings.\nIt's actually not too difficult to calculate the memory needed for a specific set of settings (in general).... but since hashcat is able to do multiple allocation and also supports tmto (Time Memory Trade Off) it's actually a little bit more complicated to do the math... again, scrypt is known to use a lot of memory and is known to be GPU-unfriendly by design. As said, you could try with a GPU with much more memory (like the nvidia 1080ti), it won't show you the resource error, but it's probably only slightly faster than a modern (high-end) CPU... because it still needs to use a high tmto value and make multiple allocation.... these problems are not present with high-end CPUs.\nBut I've tested with a 1080ti and it runs -m 15700 just fine... so either you use at GPU with at least the memory available also for a 1080ti... or just crack with a very good CPU (and avoid high tmto and multiple memory allocation altogether).\nI think you should close this issue because it is not a hashcat problem/bug. This is just problem with your setup (very low amount of memory on your GPU).\n  . I don't see any problem of hashcat here, but...\n1. you should not crack with a laptop\n2. mobile GPUs are known to be slower, or at least that they do not reach the same speed as their non-mobile equivalent (even if their name is similar)\n3. you need to use -w 4 to reach maximum speed\n4. your laptop won't support that much heat/work and will risk to burn/damage\n5. it also matters a lot what type of attack you use (and what your input is, e.g. large-enough dictionary file with rules, large-enough mask etc)... Performance could be slower if you don't supply enough work to your GPUs. I think this problem was already discussed here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7197.html\nThe main reason for this problem and a solution was also provided.\nPlease close this issue. The first \"problem\" is probably just a misunderstanding: if you combine 2 dicts with -a 1 and both use the same file path, then each and every line/password from the first dictionary will be combined with each and every line from the second dictionary and since the files are the same the words will also be combined with themselves.\nTherefore the full combinations basically are:\n11111111111111111111111111 (26 characters) + 11111111111111111111111111 (26 characters)\n111111111111111111111111111111111 (33 characters) + 11111111111111111111111111 (26 characters)\n11111111111111111111111111 (26 characters) + 111111111111111111111111111111111 (33 characters)\n111111111111111111111111111111111 (33 characters) + 111111111111111111111111111111111 (33 characters)\nand therefore: 26+26=52, 33+26=59, 26+33=59, 33+33=66 \nTherefore your statement about \"But 26 + 33 = 59, 59 != 52\" is not valid, since whenever hashcat makes all combinations of all passwords also the combination 26+26 = 52 will be tested.\nTherefore problem 1 is not a problem but just a misunderstanding.\nTo avoid that hashcat combines each and every word you could just create 2 distinct dictionary files (say dictionary_1.txt and dictionary_2.txt and combine those two dictionaries with -a 1).\nThe second problem is a little bit more difficult to understand and \"fix\" and I agree that it shouldn't be in the output like it currently is. The plain does not match the hash. I think that the GPU cracks it anyways and the host code won't output hashes with -O that are larger than 31 characters... therefore it probably will be truncated... This seems to be a bug and should be investigated. thx. Are we actually sure that this is not the same problem reported here: #1290 ?\n@emwinkler can you please make the test mentioned here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1290#issuecomment-338306987\n. why is there no -a 3 within your command ?\nWhy do you use increment (-i) ? does the problem only happen if you use -i ?\nPlease try again with the correct length, with -i removed from the command and with -a 3 added to the command. The error message from your output says:\n/home/ubuntu/hashcat/hashcat.hcstat2: No such file or directory\nplease make sure that the hcstat2 file exists . If you have a working clone of the repository it should exist. The file in question is https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/hashcat.hcstat2  (but of course you should not just download the single file. but try to fix your installation problem).. Can you please describe the problem that you are experiencing ? What do you think is wrong?\nYou are using -m 2501 (1 iteration)... if you want to use the non-PMK version with 4k iterations you need to use -m 2500 instead. . That speed difference (between PMK and non-PMK, i.e. 2501 vs 2500), as said, is perfectly what we would expect. The ratio/factor is exactly the 4096 iterations i.e. the 2501 does not have the heavy _loop kernel function of 4k iterations.\nAgain, the speed (especially of 2500) is not what a R9 395 would normally achieve with a good driver... but that discussion is already taking place here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1290\nI would suggest that we should close this issue, because it seems to be just a misunderstanding about the PMK-variant i.e. the fact that 2501 should be a factor of 4096 faster than 2500.\nThx. You probably need to install the library and headers of the iconv package first (libiconv etc).. under cygwin the package is called \"libiconv-devel\". Thanks for confirming that the problem was fixed.\nPlease do not forget to close the issue if the problem is fixed (since only you and the repository owner can do so).\nThx. salted hashes, like md5 ($salt.$pass) should be cracked with the correct hash type.\nHashcat supports:\n-m 20 = md5 ($salt.$pass)\nThe hash must be specified like this:\nhash:salt\ne.g. 8743b52063cd84097a65d1633f5c74f5:hash\n(since the characters \"hash\" form the salt in your case)\nsee https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes\nThe command to run would be \n./hashcat64 -m 20 -a 3 -w 3 -O --status 8743b52063cd84097a65d1633f5c74f5:hash  ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a\nalso do not forget to -w 3 or -w 4 if you want to achieve maximum speed.\nPlease do not forget to close the issue if the problem was fixed with these instructions. Try to use the hashcat's forum search function and use the forum for questions like this. Github is used for development purposes and to fix real bugs and implement new features.\nThx. some further problems: marvok is probably a typo for markov\nthe command line parameter is --markov-hcstat (2 dashes at the beginning)\nSome of the .hcstat2 files (as atom already mentioned) are not within the hcstat2s folder.\nAnother question is, should we add a note also within the docs/ folder? Or only use the docs/ folder for the documentation and use the hcstat2s folder for the compressed hcstat2 files only ? I'm not sure about this. Maybe we should use a considtent way for adding these extra files. This doesn't really depend on this PR, but maybe to make it more consistent we should also add README files to the rules, charset and masks folders too?\nAnother observation I made is that the files are about 14 MB (already compressed)... is this an acceptable grow in total file size of the release, @jsteube ? If needed we could maybe only pick the best ones !?. This could be a duplicate of https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1290 and https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1497 . For both issues the current impression is that the driver is just very bad on macos, not supporting byte_align () and furthermore doing weird optimizations that lead to bad speed while the non-macos drivers (windows/linux) have no propblem with the identical kernel code.. I do not have the same hardware but it should be easy to test if the same problems occur with these tests:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1290#issuecomment-338306987\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1290#issuecomment-367243381\nIf the problem is the same as mentioned within the 2 other issues, it should be easy for you to find out and see why. Hint: the new feature of supporting password lengths of > 31 (or 55) bytes/characters lead to the introduction of new kernel functions. There was basically no performance loss with good drivers but for macos drivers without byte_align support etc, there seems to be a problem (and therefore the 2 other issues are still open and help/testers are wanted with this specific hardware... but if this is a duplicate, we probably should close it, because we do not need 3 github issues for the same problem).. It should be needless to say that whenever you use the git version (or use the git command) you need to use the git version.\nTo use the source code from git/github you need to clone the repo with this command:\ngit clone https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat\nyou also need to enter the newly created hashcat directory and fetch the submodules/dependencies:\ncd hashcat\ngit submodule update --init\nall of these setup instructions are mentioned within BUILD.md. To me it seems to be the exact same problem (because the same patches fix the speed problem also for you)\nThis issue should be marked as a duplicate and closed. The discussion about a possibe fix can continue here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1290. Only the progress (and restore point value, dict position, mask position etc) will be larger if you restore a session.\nThe time started value will always indicate the time when this specific process started, it will not continue growing across runs. It's just the current value not the total amount of time.\nbtw. it is easy to calculate the total time because it should always be linear. so for instance if  you know that 10% are done in 5 hours you also know that 100% are done in 50 hours.\nThis is just how it was designed and it's not really a problem/bug in my opinion. . maybe a temperature issue?\nDid you try with lower workload/performance settings, e.g. with -w 1 ?\nIs this a macbook/notebook?. At least for older versions of skype (I didn't verify if this is still the case, probably yes) there was a hash stored within a config.xml file.\nRead some details here: https://web.archive.org/web/20161217080113/http://insecurety.net/?p=427\nBTW: you should use the forum for discussions like this. github is only used to request new features and report bugs/problems. Thx. I think that the only way something like this could work is a mechanism similar to the dictstat file (for wordlists): hashcat could remember that it already parsed and sorted these set of hashes and have some file timestamps to make sure that the files didn't change in the meantime. It could even dump the sorted (prepared) hash list to a separate file on disk and pick it up if the user uses the same hash list again and again.\nI don't think that hashcat could trust the user that it sorted the hash list correctly and that it wasn't changed afterwards :(  Therefore it needs to be done by hashcat and verified.\nThe disadvantage of this is that in the worse case hashcat would need to store at least a file as large as the original hash file (+ some metadata, like timestamps etc).. I assume that this involves elliptic curve cryptography that needs to be done on GPU ? not sure if something like this is easy to implement (feasible?)\nI'm also not sure how often it happens that you exactly know all the mnemonic words, but just do not know the optional password. I think this is kind of a rare situation (for the time being).. it's not clear what you mean by refresh.\nIf you are using the --status command line argument, you could just set the --status-timer to the number of seconds for your preferred interval. If you do not use --status, hashcat does not automatically refresh at all (you need to hit the s key on your keyboard or enter).\nQuestions like this should go to the hashcat forum (you can even use the search function and find some similar questions and answers). Is this request the same (a duplicate) of this: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1538 ?. The general format should be something like this:\n$sip$*[URI_SERVER]*[URI_CLIENT]*[USERNAME]*[REALM]*[METHOD]*[URI_PREFIX]*[URI_RESOURCE]*[URI_SUFFIX]*[NONCE_SERVER]*[NONCE_CLIENT]*[NONCE_COUNT]*[QOP]*[DIRECTIVE]*[MD5]\nsome fields are mandatory, some are optional.\nI'm a little bit confused about what you mean by \":\" within the nonce. It's normally just a number (used once, therefore nonce) that should be hexadecimal or decimal.\nMaybe it would be best if you post an example that does work and also an example that is slightly changed that does not  work anymore (and also explains what field you expect to trigger the problem).\nYou must also consider that \":\" is special within the SIP algorithm because it is used to concatenate some fields. I think you are trying to already put together the fields even if they should be separated, like URI prefix vs URI resource etc (see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/7a408d98241afc74c7c1205a3de1651117a45998/src/interface.c#L12339-L12351). The same is true with nonce count and nonce (see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/7a408d98241afc74c7c1205a3de1651117a45998/src/interface.c#L12410-L12413). You should not put them together manually, but instead specify them within the hash as separate fields. The algorithm is using the fields internally and concatenating them if needed, the user doesn't need (and should not!) do this manually.\nAll in all, I think that you are doing things that the authentication algorithm is already doing internally and therefore if you provide the wrong values (for instance nonce count + nonce vs long nonce including nonce count separated by colon) it will (and should) fail. However, it's difficult to troubleshoot it in detail without example... but I would suggest that you should try to understand ALL the fields and use the separate fields within the hash format if appropriate.. I've now investigated this problem a little bit and came to the conclusion that the \":\" is not the problem at all. Furthermore, it seems that you are still formatting the hashes incorrectly.\nIn my tests this hash:\n$sip$***4553*3CXPhoneSystem*REGISTER*sip*192.168.0.4*5066*414d535c1144225218:ef255fff6bbafa40147fbd960f128803****MD5*b3cd2617f79b96adad84706754ae91e6\ncracked, see:\n$sip$***4553*3CXPhoneSystem*REGISTER*sip*192.168.0.4*5066*414d535c1144225218:ef255fff6bbafa40147fbd960f128803****MD5*b3cd2617f79b96adad84706754ae91e6:ab1234\nwhen I modify the maximum nonce length supported by hashcat to > 51, e.g. changing https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/7a408d98241afc74c7c1205a3de1651117a45998/src/interface.c#L12257 to:\nif (nonce_len < 1 || nonce_len > 64) return (PARSER_SALT_LENGTH);\nto allow a nonce lenght of up to 64 bytes (for instance 414d535c1144225218:ef255fff6bbafa40147fbd960f128803 is 51 bytes long).\nI'm still not really convinced that 414d535c1144225218:ef255fff6bbafa40147fbd960f128803 is a number and a valid nonce, do you have more details on which system does use a colon within a number ? That isn't really a number, I think. I'm pretty sure the standard also says the same i.e. \"a number is a number\".\nI'm not sure if we should change this max length because I didn't see that long nonces before, but on the other hand it shouldn't have many disadvantages increasing this limit if needed in general.\nWhat do you think? does the change/fix work for you too?. are you sure that you have installed the OpenCL driver from intel as recommended on https://hashcat.net/hashcat ?\nWhat is the output of clinfo ?. that sounds interesting/good. Do you think you are able to send a pull request (PR) that can be reviewed by the devs ? you already have written the diff, therefore it should be easy to create/send a PR from it.\nI think the OpenCL headers download is not needed because we suggest that the submodules are initialized with git directly (git submodule update --init). This guarantees that you always use the correct/compatible/tested version of the headers.\nThanks for your contribution. why do you use --force?\nAre you sure that you are using the correct drivers as suggested on https://hashcat.net/hashcat ? What are the driver versions? Did you test this: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do\nDid you try using only the CPU? Did you try using the GPU? see --opencl-device-types from the help menu (--help).. Did you try using --opencl-devices (or short -d) to test the single GPU cracking? Why do you say it works with a single GPU ?\nfor instance you could use -d 1\nbtw you do not need to have the character \"w\" two times within the custom charset definition, it's enough to just specify it once like: -1 34afmw. are you able to crack the example hccapx file from https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes with password \"hashcat!\" with a mask attack -a 3 ?\nbtw: the title seems to be not correct if it is not a multi-GPU problem (we already excluded that). It seems that this is now a 100% duplicate of #1611 (I think we should close this and if you are 100% sure it is not somehow hardware/driver related we might rethink to reopen the older one).... on the other hand, I don't think that it is hashcat's fault because it works with your self-test and we also have no other similar reports (it could still be a very specific vega+WPA related problem). Did the example hash work for you? Are you able to use -a 3 with other hash types?\nThe title is still missleading because it doesn't mention that this is (probably) a vega related problem with -m 2500 = WPA/WPA2. My guess is that your setup (hardware/driver) only have problem with WPA.\nDid you test using other/older driver versions ? Did you try rocm on linux ?. this \"problem\" is similar to this recent issue: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1603\nI also explained how to fix it (by changing the parsing code) here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1603#issuecomment-400808910\nNow the question is that because we already got 2+ request for this, it might make sense to increase the maximum nonce length a little bit, e.g. to 64.\nI'm still not sure why these nonces (numbers used once) are that large for some implementations. If somebody has a clue and how large they could be (or even better the average and maximum length) it would help a lot in making a good decision here. I remember reading the standard/rfc for the last issue, but I didn't really came to a good conclusion... it just seems that the \"number\" can also be a non-number (e.g. could have colons or other characters in it) and could be of arbitrary length.\nI think a length of max 64 chars would make sense because in theory it should be a \"normal\" number, I guess... and therefore it should not be an extremly long arbitrary string.. I could not reproduce the --restore problem: my guess is that you are doing something wrong or have old files lying around (did you do a make clean etc). Anyway, I've now pushed a fix for the esalt/nonce length limitation: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1631. The new limit is about 1024 bytes.. @DasExperimentator hey, the problem with --restore should be fixed with latest code. This commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/cc8fa3ee8033e6258126ec17abbe476252532c5a should fix the problem of wrong hashes within the .restore file whenever the hash was a command line argument (instead of a hash file).\nThis problem was introduce very recently with the addition of the tokenizer within the parser. Thanks for reporting it. It seems completely unrelated with this issue and/or with SIP (but only -m 11400 = SIP used TOKEN_ATTR_TERMINATE_STRING therefore I admit it was somehow related, but just not related with the nonce/esalt problem).\nWould be great if you can test the latest master code. Thx. here is a recent example of a new hash type addition: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/c28fdf7f44bf5d39f9078f6d82b52bdb052125e3. does it work with older drivers? i.e. did you only notice the problem after updating the driver?. I think questions like this should be first searched in the forum and if really no answer was provided it should be asked in the hashcat forum over here: https://hashcat.net/forum/\nThe github issues are more addressed at fixing problems, requesting new feature etc, not really user questions like this.\nIt's not even clear what you are trying to do in detail and what problem you are experiencing. My guess is that you want to crack a bitcoin wallet.dat file and that you want to run this with hashcat but get some error message. What error message did you get? What do you mean by \"unable to run\"? You should be more specific here.\nFor -m 11300 = Bitcoin/Litecoin wallet.dat you first need to convert the wallet.dat file with something like bitcoin2john.py to a \"hash\" that can be run with hashcat. The hash formats are mentioned here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes (if bitcoin2john.py outputs the filenames too, you need to adapt the output hash to the format that hashcat expects, without the file names and colon).\nYou normally either run \"sudo make install\" or run hashcat with \"./hashcat [args]\". Not both.\nThat means, you either install it, or run it within the current folder. Not both.\nFurthermore, your hashcat command misses the attack type (mask attack, combinator, straight etc) , the hash file and the mask/dict etc.\na correct command would be something like this:\nhashcat -m 11300 -a 0 hash.txt dict.txt\nwhere the output of bitcoin2john.py (adapted to the hash format mentioned on the wiki) is stored within the file hash.txt and the dict.txt file contains your password candidates (one per line).\nThese are all very basic points in how to use hashcat, that are not really difficult to find in the wiki/faq/forum etc and furthermore, as said, not very suitable for this kind of issues on github. Maybe you have some other problems, but you need to mention the details. It's not easy to guess what your problem with using hashcat is when you just say \"I am unable to run\".\nPlease do not forget to close the issue if the problem was fixed or whenever you plan to ask the question on the hashcat forum with more details etc.\nThx. how to reproduce this? what is your command ? which version of hashcat ?\nbtw: you need to build hashcat with \"make DEBUG=1\" and for instance use gdb to get a meaningfull backtrace of the function/line in code that lead to the segfault. thx. The github issue tracker is meant to report problems/bug with hashcat and report feature request.\nUser questions (that were btw already answered elsewhere a couple of times) are more suitable for the hashcat forum (https://hashcat.net/forum). Many answers to user questions can also be found in the wiki and faq of hashcat.net\nHashcat uses so called attack modes (see --attack-mode or short -a) to try to crack a hash in a very particular way. e.g. by using a word list attack, a combinator attack (2 wordlists), or a brute-force/mask attack (no dict involved).\nThis attack modes sometimes (for fast hashes) need dedicated kernel source code, because of the way they can be optimized. _a0 stands for -a 0 (dict), _a1 stands for -a 1 (combinator, -a 1 dict1.txt dict2.txt) and -a 3 stands for mask attack (improved \"brute-force\", -a 3 ?u?a?a?a?a?d?d?d for instance).\nPlease close this issue and consider asking user questions (not related to bugs or feature requests) on the forum only if AFTER using the forum's search function (or googling for it) didn't return any results.\nThanks. -m 10900 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256\nthis is an issue tracker for bugs/feature request. You can answer this type of question by looking at the example hashes here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes or using the --example-hashes paramter of hashcat\nhashcat -m 10900 --example-hashes\nplease close this issue and consider using the wiki/faq/forum next time (btw: it's not allowed to post hashes within the hashcat forum). can you please give more details? what do you mean by blockchain in this context? a wallet of blockchain.info/blockchain.com ?\nFurthermore, what do you mean by second password? Why second?\ndoes it have something to do with this: https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/207746383-Security (search for Second Wallet Password) ?. I did some research and posted my findings in a hashcat forum post (https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-8174-post-43904.html#pid43904) after some user showed some interest in this algorithm.\nThe algo is quite straight-forward, it's iterated sha256 (UUID/salt concatenated with password).\na POC is within the forum post\nThank you. This algorithm (the salted/iterated SHA256 second password hash) was added with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/d0d4ce9f8c0e99806466457701f2cc75f98ef00a\n-m 18800 = Blockchain, My Wallet, Second Password (SHA256)\nexample hash is this:\nhashcat -m 18800 --example-hashes\nYnM6WYERjJfhxwepT7zV6odWoEUz1X4esYQb4bQ3KZ7bbZAyOTc1MDM3OTc1NjMyODA0ECcAAD3vFoc=\n(password: hashcat)\nThe hash format expects that the main passwords was already cracked and that the base64 encoded \"bs:\" data is provided, like the one of extract-scripts/extract-blockchain-second-hash.py from btcrecover.\nThe format of this hash/base64 string is also explained in the forum post linked above.\nAnyone wants to test it ?\nIt's already in beta : https://hashcat.net/beta/\nThanks. I can reproduce this, thanks for the report!\nWe should probably fix this soon.. How did you create the luks volume ?\nWe have seen some users reporting problems in the past: they did only create the volume but not really initialize i.e. write to it. Without this extra step of \"using\" the volume (e.g. formatting the volume with a file system and writing some files to it etc) it is just garbage data and can't be cracked.\nBTW: there are some example hashes/volumes on https://hashcat/wiki/example_hashes for luks. I'm pretty sure that whenever you get these to work, it shouldn't be a hashcat problem but just pebcak (not creating/initializing the volume correctly for instance).\nPlease test and close the issue if working. thx. well, it's easy to test. If for instance the tool\nclinfo\nreports the GPU correctly, hashcat should too.\nIf even clinfo does not show your GPU, we can be sure that it is not a problem within hashcat (but a problem with your installation/setup).\nAlso see https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do\nPlease test clinfo and report back. Don't forget to close the issue if it is starting to work and/or you found a solution. Thx . seems to be spam. please close. are you sure it doesn't depend on your code? did you free every buffer/struct you allocated memory for? Do you have some code we could test with?\nAre you sure it is hashcat that leaks memory or could it be the driver? You could use tools like valgrind and/or gcc sanitizer features to debug where the memory leak is.\nThx. If you search for \"OSX v10.8+ (PBKDF2-SHA512)\" here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes\nyou will see an example hash.\nThe length of the last field is 128 hex characters (or 64 bytes in binary).\nThe last field is:\n752351df64dd2ce9dc9c64a72ad91de6581a15c19176266b44d98919dfa81f0f96cbcb20a1ffb400718c20382030f637892f776627d34e021bad4f81b7de8222\nnote this can be seen by just searching for the last \"$\" character within the line.\nThis last field should not be longer than 128 characters (like the example above). If it is longer, you can just remove everything after the 128th character and try running hashcat with this new hash (where the last field was cut to 128 hex characters or 64 binary bytes).\nPlease close the issue if the problem was fixed. Thx. this is a quite old card (2012 ?). does the latest AMD driver even support it and is OpenCL officially supported with this GPU? You might want to try this: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do\nbut the best (and probably only working) solution would be to buy a more modern GPU like the Nvidia 1080 ti or if you want a new AMD GPU.\nPlease close this issue if you think this \"problem\" is solved because hashcat can't do anything here and only a hardware upgrade can fix it. . I agree, and furthermore both pocl and the kali distribution are not recommended by hashcat. I would suggest to use a distribution supported by the major hardware vendor (like Intel, Nvidia, AMD... i.e. ubuntu for instance) and use the native/proprietary driver that can be downloaded from the vendors web page. The recommended driver versions can be found here https://hashcat.net/hashca\n(I know that pocl is in the list too, but since pocl is still kind of experimental and very often leads to driver crashes, you should stick to the proprietary drivers of the hardware vendor).\nPlease do not forget to close the ticket if it works with the suggestions. I did try to reproduce this on windows 10 with both hashcat 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 and both worked correctly.\nI've tested it with\necho hashcat|hashcat64.exe -m 400 hashlist.txt\nand\ntype dict.txt | hashcat64.exe -m 400 hashlist.txt\nand\npp64.exe dict2.txt | hashcat64.exe -m 400 hashlist.txt\nall of these commands succeeded and cracked the hashes as expected.\nI'm not sure how to reproduce this. Did you test with a different version (non release versions)?\nif not, can you please test again with a different windows 10 system (maybe it's a problem with your driver/setup)?. Why do you use naive-hashcat.sh ? a third-party tool not developed/supported/maintained by hashcat ?\nPlease download the source code of the release version from https://hashcat.net/hashcat and extract it with \"7z x\". Enter the extracted folder and compile it according to the instructions (https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/BUILD.md), then run something like\n./hashcat -b -m 0\n(to benchmark the MD5 speed of your setup)\nMy guess is that it has something to do with naive-hashcat.sh and is not really a hashcat problem. You could also make sure that the file OpenCL/inc_vendor.cl exists within the extracted folder (from the downloaded file from https://hashcat.net/hashcat). Could you please test with the recommended proprietary driver from intel instead of the experimental (open source) pocl driver? I'm pretty sure it's a driver problem.\nrecommended driver versions: https://hashcat.net/hashcat (yeah, I know pocl is listed there too, but it's not recommended, see the dozens of bug reports on the hashcat forum and on github... the driver is not really production ready for OpenCL tasks). The base32 output is also a little bit special/confusing. I guess the format expects this base32 \"passwords\".\nIt's just confusing that the password candidates (e.g. \"Candidates.#1\") are different compared to the final output (which is base32 encoded).\nFurthermore, the -m 18100 --example output is \"hashcat\", but the final output is base32 (\"hashcat\") etc....\nI can live with it, but i guess if it is not really required to encode the password with base32, it could also make sense to skip this step to avoid confusion (does the user know that the output was not the raw output but the encoded output ? I guess, that experienced users can notice that). I actually think that @jsteube is correct @ memory leak.\nif we have this:\n```\n  u32 plain_buf[64] = { 0 };\nu8 plain_ptr = (u8 ) plain_buf;\n```\nand afterwards:\nplain_ptr = (u8 *) strdup ((const char *) temp_ptr);\nthis last \"plain_ptr = something\" is just a pointer assignment (plain_ptr now \"points\" to a new address). It's not a memcpy ().\nAccording to this https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/experimental/dynamic/strdup , we always need to use free () when we use strdup ().\nplain_ptr = (u8 ) strdup ((const char ) temp_ptr);\nwill just assign a new address to plain_ptr, but it won't replace the bytes allocated by plain_buf[64] = { 0 }, but instead strdup () will return a very new address (on heap) and this new memory block must be freed to avoid memory leaks.\n. what's your hardware and driver ?\nDo you see any warnings when launching hashcat ? (self test warnings?). Well, I didn't really look carefully at the hashes you posted.\nYou are using salts that are 32 characters long.\nThat's too long for the optimized -m 3710 = md5($salt.md5($pass)) , since as you can see we need to combine the 32 bytes of (hex) digest of the md5 ($pass) with the salt, which is more than 1 md5 transformation because of 32 (digest of md5 ($pass) + 32 salt > max bytes 55 for a MD5 transformation.\nI agree that this should be more obvious and we should reject those hashes (and only allow running them without -O ). This should be fixed in code (i.e. give a warning that salts greater than 55-32 = 23 can't be run with -m 3710 -O).\nThis problem could also affect other hash types, therefore I recommend that we should implement this -O hash rejection with other hash types too.. it's probably a driver issue. Did you try to reinstall the driver for instance by following this guide https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do\nFurthermore, did you try with different driver versions? Does it really depend only on the hashcat version or is that just a coincident (because the OpenCL kernel code changed for WPA between hashcat versions 3.6.0 and 4.2.1).\nYou say it is stuck... How long did you wait? Do you see any new files created within the kernels\\ folder while it is initializing ?\nDid you try to downloading a fresh version of hashcat (within a new folder) and try again ? Did you try using the beta version of hashcat from https://hashcat.net/beta/ ?. It seems you are compiling hashcat yourself by using \"make install\", is that right?\nAre you sure that you always used the \"make uninstall\" before you installed the new version ?\nWhat happens if you just use the normal \"make\" and try running hashcat like this\n./hashcat -b\ni.e. run it locally from the current working directory (cwd)\nFurhermore, please make sure that /usr/local/share/hashcat/OpenCL/inc_vendor.cl exists and contains the DECLSPEC declarations e.g.\n```\ndefine DECLSPEC inline\n```\netc\nI would say it makes sense to also try the latest beta and release versions and if all of them work I would assume it has something to do with your way that you've installed hashcat (or is this a package provided by a repo that misses some files ? did you manually compile it or not ?). Do you know what the original file system type was ?\n--keep-guessing might help, but you shouldn't get too many \"cracks\"\nHashcat detects a correct crack on luks by checking the entropy of the decrypted bytes. You shouldn't get too many incorrect results, because if the \"key\" was not correct the data should be gibberish and therefore the entropy threshold shouldn't be reached.\nsee https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6225.html\nI wouldn't exclude other reasons, driver problems etc... but without more details (e.g. troubleshooting the entropy value etc), we probably can't say for sure.\nI would recommend to start testing with --keep-guessing and see how many results per minute/hour you get.\nThx. I think you should create an almost identical disk and format it with the same file system etc and use a known password and test hashcat with this sample instead.\n(do not forget to use this test disk before making the dd backup, because if you do not \"use\" it e.g. by formatting it, it can't be cracked, because it has random data) \nnote: hashcat doesn't guess any file system, it just uses an entropy check and only if the decrypted data has very low entropy, it's kind of guaranteed that the key was correct (because decrypting with the wrong key would result in \"very random\" data with a very high entropy).\nthere is no such thing as the \"old key check\", hashcat always used the data entropy check for the luks algorithm. btw I did some troubleshooting and my conclusion is that your data part seems to be not valid/encrypted.\nwhile the test from the wiki seems to have random data (and the cracking works):\ndd if=luks_tests/hashcat_sha1_aes_cbc-essiv_256.luks bs=1 count=64 skip=$((4096 * 512)) 2>/dev/null | xxd -g 1\n00000000: 8a c9 38 96 49 2a 73 6b f9 2f 19 a7 b3 bc 5e 00  ..8.I*sk./....^.\n00000010: 2b 7a 35 37 ca b0 bb 23 46 20 3a 5e 76 d1 6f 1a  +z57...#F :^v.o.\n00000020: 53 f0 9c 98 aa 5c 86 b9 b2 38 2a 43 18 41 53 0f  S....\\...8*C.AS.\n00000030: 45 67 64 4f 61 ad 16 95 71 f0 d1 5e dc c9 b1 3c  EgdOa...q..^...<\nthis is the data part of your luks file:\ndd if=luksheader.flash.image bs=1 count=64 skip=$((4096 * 512)) 2>/dev/null | xxd -g 1\n00000000: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................\n00000010: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................\n00000020: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................\n00000030: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................\nof course this is not random/valid data (and therefore low entropy)\nthe data offset comes from\ncryptsetup luksDump luksheader.flash.image\n...\nPayload offset: 4096\n...\nI'm pretty sure there is something wrong with your data part. I guess that a test with a properly formatted data/disk won't show all those 0xffffffff\n. One of the problems (I troubleshooted it a little bit), seems to be that when we start the server here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/b8eb7105dd596b6cb563f7cf61addd27d5add75d/src/main.c#L1052\nwe didn't setup WSAStartup () yet which is in user_options_check_files ()\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/b8eb7105dd596b6cb563f7cf61addd27d5add75d/src/user_options.c#L1873-L1890\ncalled after https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/b8eb7105dd596b6cb563f7cf61addd27d5add75d/src/main.c#L1083\nso the WSAStartup () needs to be done before the socket initialization (also for the server) on windows.\nI didn't yet confirm that the bind works... but that's probably the next step to do.\n\nupdate: it seems to work but I still get a \"Too many clients\" error, which is very weird o.O. The connection is correctly detected and if the firewall rule was correctly set (allow from public and/or private network) we see the connection attempt: \"Connection from 192.168.0.2:44245\"\n\nupdate2: it seems to work with the correct --brain-password parameter (and the WSA fix from above). gosh damnit!!! I'm still not sure why I got the \"Too many clients\" beforehand with an invalid password.. I'm pretty sure on ubuntu, for instance, it's called liblzma-dev and you can link it with -llzma (instead of -llzmasdk).\nOther distributions could use other names for the library of course (e.g. p7zip or 7z, 7zip related instead of lzma, lzma-sdk etc). note the fix here seems to be to check for:\nif ((brain_server_db_short->short_cnt + temp_cnt) > passwords_max)\n      {     \n        // not valid! don't accept the request\n      }\nit could happen that we overflow the brain_server_db_short->short_buf otherwise, because it only has passwords_max \"items\". This should of course not happen in a normal situation, but we should still catch it and reject it!?. Thank you very much for this report\nThe problem seems to have to do with the new brain feature and in particular with the computation of the checksum of the dictionaries.\nThe effect of this bug is that we kind of loop within this code section forever:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/6b2c56118c1aaa976e380912808bd23a987afb33/src/brain.c#L543-L548\nwe would probably need at least a check like this:\nif (feof (fd)) break;. This \"new behaviour\" was introduced with this PR https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1673 .\nI think we should first think about what is the correct behaviour and afterwards try to handle it accordingly.\nFirst, we have 2 options:\n--gpu-temp-disable\n--gpu-temp-abort\nAs far as I know, before we merged the PR mentioned above all fan and temp stuff was disabled with --gpu-temp-disable (also warnings/errors) etc.\nThe above PR changes this behaviour slightly and also allows fan/temp reads even if --gpu-temp-disable was specified.\nAccording to the description for --gpu-temp-disable (\"Disable temperature and fanspeed reads and triggers\") the old behaviour could be seen as more accurate/correct.\nAlso note that we have no option for fan, therefore it's always either fan & speed... or none (this would be also a little bit difficult to change because we only have 1 line for them in the status screen).\nThe question now is: should --gpu-temp-disable only affect the monitoring of the temp and if needed aborting hashcat.... or should it affect everything (as it did before the PR, i.e. also reading/displaying the fan speed and temperature)?\nIt's quite easy to come up with a fix, but I think the fix that @mastercracker1 wants is to basically revert the above mentioned PR (with maybe some further changes).\nI think that we should make hashcat behave according to the --gpu-temp-disable description (or if we decide otherwise we need to change this description too). What do you think ?\nIt would be great if @RAN1 could also join the discussion to see if we can come up with a solution we all are happy with.. Please make sure that you are using the latest version of hashcat (in this specific case the beta version, since we pushed some bug fixes).\nsee https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1738\ndon't forget to close the issue if it's fixed. thx. what is the password for this example hash?\nThe format should be CHAP_R:CHAP_C:CHAP_I\n7f3d71b4c0c6569d2fa26f4c14ac3cf0:b73158a35a255d051758e95ed4abb2cdc69bb454110e827441213ddc8770e93ea141e1fc673e017e97eadc6b:02\nhashcat currently expects exactly 16 bytes for the challenge (note CHAP_C means chap challenge and CHAP_R means chap response, while CHAP_I is the chap_id - an incrementing counter -)\nthis means that the long challenge that you tried is not currently supported (length: 44 bytes, 88 hexadecimal characters)\n. yeah, the password seems to work:\n(echo -en \"\\x02\"; echo -n 'U$er1'; echo b73158a35a255d051758e95ed4abb2cdc69bb454110e827441213ddc8770e93ea141e1fc673e017e97eadc6b | xxd -r -p) | md5sum\n7f3d71b4c0c6569d2fa26f4c14ac3cf0\nthe problem, as we already suspected, is \"just\" the longer challenge length (44 vs 16 bytes).\nIn the meantime, you coud probably work around this limit by just using -m 10 = md5 ($pass . $salt)\ni.e. hashcat -m 10 -a 0 -j '^\\x02' --hex-salt hash.txt dict.txt\nwhere hash.txt contains the hash:\n7f3d71b4c0c6569d2fa26f4c14ac3cf0:b73158a35a255d051758e95ed4abb2cdc69bb454110e827441213ddc8770e93ea141e1fc673e017e97eadc6b. it's important that you know how your operating system does interpret the command line arguments. on windows for instance you might need to use \"^^\\x02\" or something like this (because of shell/dos escape rules).\nanyway, you can always just put the rules into a rule file e.g. myrule.rule with the file content\n^\\x02\nand use -r myrule.rule instead of -j ^\\x02 \nbtw: you can't remove the ^, that's the actual rule function ! (\\x02 is not a rule at all).\nI think this all is quite irrelevant to this issue and very basic usage of hashcat and/or general use/understanding of your shell/operating system.. Thanks for report.\nI can confirm -m 10700 problems but -m 12 should be fixed with 4d457ca141103a15cc8939089f5bff55a407d254\nplease try beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/ with -m 12 to confirm. good, we should still investigate the problem with -m 10700. it probably is a minor issue with the new parser/tokenizer code (limits too strict/wrong ?). I've tracked this problem back a little bit and noticed that this commit introduced the problem:\ncd552eb54dda8ab4c9729664b3aefcf4b0887b4a\nthis means that the conversion to the tokenizer interface has a bug for -m 10700\nI guess it should be easy to fix now with this knowledge and by making the tokenizer call work like it did before we introduced our new tokenizer functions.. This must have to do with your setup and how you installed hashcat.\nSince you use The-Distribution-Which-Does-Not-Handle-OpenCL-Well (Kali), you might have installed hashcat system-wide with packages etc.\nhashcat itself recommends using the binaries from https://hashcat.net/hashcat/ and use the tool directly within the extracted download folder, for instance:\n./hashcat --help\nan accepted/recommended alternative for more advanced users would be to use the git repository https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat (clone the repo, make (see BUILD.md), ./hashcat --help) and this also allows to use \"make install\" to install hashcat.\nIf you do this (make install) the folder ${HOME}/.hashcat/ and subfolders will be created automatically.\nMy guess is that on your system there is a problem (or conflict) with the installed hashcat version and/or the folder /home/cyberthereaper/.hashcat/ does not exist.\nIt's difficult/impossible for us to track all kali issues here, if the downloaded version (run it locally with ./hashcat, not just \"hashcat\") and/or the \"make install\" version (be aware that you might first need to uninstall all the hashcat packages etc, otherwise there could be further conflicts) works, it's not a hashcat problem.\nPlease test and do not forget to close the issue if the problem was fixed with these instructions.\nThank you\n\nupdate: do not forget the most important rule DO NOT EVER report a problem and use --force ;)\nthis --force flag tells us that your setup is broken and there is something you need to fix (e.g. install correct/proprietary drivers etc) before reporting (other?) problems. omg your command is completely wrong.\nyou are using a mask attack (-a 3 ) with a dictionary file (rockyou.txt)\ntry this:\n./hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -D 1 --session deneme1 /home/cyberthereaper/zzzzz/md5.txt /home/cyberthereaper/zzzzz/rockyou.txt. what is this issue all about? I have no clue what you mean by instagram hashing in the context of hashcat. Please give the algorithm details or link to source code and follow the instructions here:\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this. wait?\nthis has nothing to do with --keep-guessing.\nIf you want to test several masks with hashcat, you need to use the hashcat mask file feature (https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack#hashcat_mask_files).\nHashcat never allowed to specify a list of masks directly on the command line like you just tried with the command above. something like this is not allowed:\n-a 3 hash.txt ?u ?d ?u?u ?d?d ?u?u?u ?d?d?d ?u?u?u?u ?d?d?d?d\nhashcat only expects and accepts one single mask. Indeed, it should give an error otherwise. I guess it's because it's sometimes tricky to catch if there is some additional (not used) parameters in the command line (but it could be fixed indeed).\n--keep-guessing on the other hand does not care about if there are multiple masks or multiple dicts etc, it only does NOT mark the digests as \"done\" and therefore the GPU keeps working on this particular hash.\n. it should have something to do with the limitations mentioned here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/38e97bd89ada27dd07c74046889b102b34686781/docs/limits.txt#L25-L41\nnote: the limits.txt file says that all distinct passwords are guaranteed to be reported at least once, but I guess it's not always possible if the same kernel function call (should) find 2 correct hits (with a tiny keyspace like in your case). maybe @jsteube can confirm this. did you try running electrum2john.py ?\ndoes the output start with $electrum$2 or is it $electrum$3 ?\nHashcat supports salt type 1 and 2 currently, not sure if your type is not supported (3 ?). Hey.\nPlease search for questions like this on the hashcat forum/wiki/faq etc. These questions have been answered dozens of times and github issues are not really the right place to ask general questions  like this (which have been answered already couple of times) that have nothing to do with bugs/problems in the hashcat software.\nnote: you could use something like hashtopolis to distribute work across many cracking machines.\nbtw: do not forget to close this issue\nThx. Does this mean it is neither \"cbc-plain64\" nor \"cbc-essiv\" ? This is the cryptsetup luksDump output, right?\nAre you able to open this volume with the correct password?\nAre you able to create a similar (new) volume with cryptsetup? How do you create a volume with this cipher mode?\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=32 of=test.img >/dev/null 2>/dev/null\ncryptsetup luksFormat ./test.img -q --cipher aes-cbc\nI get\nFailed to setup dm-crypt key mapping for device ./test.img.\nCheck that kernel supports aes-cbc cipher (check syslog for more info).\nI think it should be either cbc-plain64 or cbc-essiv. Can you somehow generate a image with the same Cipher name, Cipher mode, Hash spec as the luksDump from above?. Did you install the drivers ? the recommended drivers are mentioned under https://hashcat.net/hashcat\nWhich hardware do you have? Which drivers have you installed?\nYou need to give more details about your setup.\nDoes clinfo work, if not even clinfo lists all your CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU and/or CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU , hashcat also won't work (because the drivers are not correctly installed). Therefore we recommend testing with clinfo first (such that we are sure it's not hashcat's fault).\nBTW: this type of questions are not really suitable for this type of bug/problem tracker (github issues). We recommend searching for the error on https://hashcat.net/forum/\nplease do not forget to close the issue if installing the driver fixed the problem (also see https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do).\nThx. This is a driver installation problem, please follow these steps: https://hashcat.net/faq/wrongdriver\n(also download a fresh copy of hashcat from https://hashcat.net/hashcat and install the recommended drivers mentioned there)\nPlease don't forget to close this issue if fixed. it's way too huge keyspace:\n[a-f0-9] (note you said a-z which is wrong !) is 16 different characters\nsha256 has length 64 in hexadecimal.\nTherefore your keyspace is:\n16^64 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936\ndo you even realize how large this is ? (hint: try to think about the amount of all atoms on the word, it's just incredible huge), therefore infeasible\nto answer your question see https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack : \n-a 3 hash.txt ?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h?h\nwould be the correct mask, but it's of course not accepted because it's an insane large mask that leads to insane large values of keyspace etc... (=> 64 bit variables can't hold such large values)\nAs you can see from https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes sha256(sha256($pass)) is currently not supported, but might be possible to implement. Do you know if sha256(sha256($pass)) is the correct algorithm used in your case ?\nBTW: the github issues are not suitable for questions like this, please try finding a solution on wiki/forum/faq instead. If there is currently no answer to a question you have by looking at wiki/forum/faq, you might consider opening a new thread on the hashcat forum instead https://hashcat.net/forum/\ngithub is for issues/bugs/feature report only, not for general non-technical discussion/help requests.\nPlease do not forget to close this github issue as soon as possible (only the author of this github issue and owner of this repository have the right to close github issues).. hmm... it's strange that it seems that this is your project/repository. That's kind of \"fishy\" (this is no accusation, but it's strange/uncommon that the algorithm developer wants their algorithm to be easily crackable etc).\nWhere is this algorithm being used? Is this really a common hashing algorithm used in the wild for which the addition to hashcat would benefit a lot of hashcat users ? I have never heard of this algorithm in the past.\nIs this even considered a (secure?) password hashing algorithm (I didn't look at the code but already the project description \"encode ya message!\" doesn't really seem to indicate that this codeMKII algo is used to hash and store passwords).\nCould you please clarify why this should be added and where this algorithm is used ?\nFurther details are also needed, see: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this\nThank you very much. sound like a driver issue.\ndoes -D 1 work for you ?\ndo you have problems with other hash types too?. -d is not the same as -D\nyou can't say that something didn't work, but at the same time you show that you tried something completely different\nagain:\n--opencl-devices (or short -d) is not the same as --opencl-device-types (or short -D)\nbut it doesn't really matter actually in this very specific case, because you just found out that the problem only happens with a very specific device (not device type !) and only together with a very specific driver... therefore I would classify this problem as a driver bug (of course there could be workarounds of any bugs, but you either need to convince the driver developers or try messing around with the OpenCL kernel code and see if any code change could prevent this problem to occur with this specific faulty driver version). should/could we close this issue?. you can use up to 31 rule functions (the amount of characters is not the problem) within one rule line, see https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack#limitations\nThis is of course a limitation that is well documented and is actually quite difficult to remove without breaking support for older GPUs etc which have less memory etc. (we once had support to up to 255 rule functions in a previous release, but of course it needs much more memory and therefore users complained a lot)\nPlease do not forget to close the issue, if this explains why there is this limit. I'm pretty sure that the problem is that the salt can't be more than 16*4 = 64 bytes, see:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/471a8cccaf7feb79e08ee28e47a89bb479ab7504/include/interface.h#L349\nand\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/471a8cccaf7feb79e08ee28e47a89bb479ab7504/OpenCL/inc_types.cl#L1335\ntherefore either the salt buffers are \"too small\" or the checks for maximum salt lengths are wrong.\nThanks for the report.\nbtw: remember that backtraces are kind of useless if you do not use \"make DEBUG=1\" while compiling the code (non-optimized code with debug symbols), your whole output above kind of only tells us that /home/jku/hashcat-5.1.0/hashcat64.bin crashed LOL, no hint about why and where it crashed without debugging symbols\nThx. this might have to do with your cached dict stats (hashcat.dictstat2).\nCould you please try to make a backup of the dicstat2 file and delete the original file (hashcat.dictstat2) and try again ?\nIn the past all problems around this feof () error had either to do with your dict or dictstat2 file... this is just my educated guess... please test.\nBTW: what is the hash type you are trying to crack (-m xxx) ?. any updates here ?\nwe need an answer/confirmation. I can't reproduce it here.\nCould you please test/troubeshoot what I mentioned above @fakename12345cat ?\nThx. It's not supported currently, but there are already other example hash types like -m 5100 = Half MD5 that do basically the same (just in this case for MD5).\nOf course it wouldn't be impossible to implement, but the problem is that we need of course to have good performance in mind (and that's the difficult part and kind of impossible without implementing a dedicated OpenCL kernel for each and every substring of a hash). Also see https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/116 (that means that this issue is actually a duplicate of the older issue).\n. does aircrack-ng even use OpenCL ?\nI suspect that this is a driver/setup problem and your comparison is flawed because one software is using the intel OpenCL driver (hashcat), while the other one (aircrack-ng) is not using this package at all.\nbtw, we had all kind of strange issues like this and at the end it turned out that the users did something strange (like using hashcat within a very restricted vm with limited resources) or configured the system incorrectly (by for instance not using the official drivers from the vendor etc).\nI would also say that problems like these are better suited for the hashcat forum @ https://hashcat.net/forum/ and since these are probably not really software bugs (in hashcat) or feature requests, you might find more/better solutions and help on the forum instead of on the dev issue tracker.. sorry, but I didn't really understand what you did or what/why it is working now?\nDidn't you say that the speed was bad (compared to aircrack-ng) and that you see that only 1 CPU core was used ? What happened if this is no problem anymore ?\nI also noticed from your screenshots above that one is mentioning the \"i5-8400\" and the other is not (even if you used -D 1,2 in both of them). So there is maybe a little bit confusion and misunderstanding going on here that we need to clarify first.. oh, now I understand what is working and what wasn't working before. Thanks for clarifying and confirming.\nLet me explain the 2 options briefly.\n--opencl-device-types as explained within the --help output is needed to whitelist your CPU OpenCL device. The default for hashcat is that \"only\" GPUs are enabled/whitelisted by default (except if the system only has CPUs).\nWith the opencl-device-types 1 you enable the CPU device type and the value 2 means GPUs (see --help output under \"OpenCL Device Types\"), the option --opencl-device-types 1,2 of course enables both CPUs and GPUs.\n--force in this particular case is only needed because your GPU is a Intel GPU for which we know the driver has several bugs and speed problems. That is  why by default (without the --force command line switch) you get the error \"Intel's OpenCL runtime (GPU only) is currently broken.\" (as you can see it says that only GPUs are affected and therefore (as far as we know) the Intel OpenCL Runtime for CPU devices (Intel Core and Intel Xeon) is working perfectly fine.\nThis means that users without Intel GPUs won't need to set --force and the ones that only have Intel GPUs are guaranteed to see the error message that warns them from using this device/driver.\nThis also means that most of the hashcat users fortunately won't need to use the --force option i.e. if they do not have Intel GPUs (these GPUs for the time being are also not recommended, because they both are, among others, slower compared than both Nvidia and AMD GPUs).\nI hope that explains a little bit what is going on. I assume you already figured out most of what I just wrote, but it's always good to document it here just in case somebody else reads it and doesn't understand what is going on.\nIf you have any suggestion how to improve this (or the documentation forum/wiki/faq) it is of course very welcome. Unfortunately, in your case you had to use both options (and install the OpenCL runtime for your Intel Core correctly) but I don't see much we can do to improve the user experience here (the --force hint was in the output and the device that wasn't whitelisted yet, had the \"skipped\" warning in the output to notify the user that --opencl-device-types must be used to whitelist it).\nThanks for your explaination and feedback\nBTW: only the original poster in this github issue (author, you @gitxmax ) and the project owner (@jsteube) can close issues... so please don't forget to close it if we agree that we can't improve/do anything here\n. \"Killed\" as far as I know has most of the time to do with exhausting all RAM (memory) of the system and therefore the process is killed by the system.\nWith 8 times 4 GB you should have at least 32 GB available host memory, because the driver (not hashcat) will pre-allocate this.\nTry testing with only one card, e.g. by adding --opencl-devices 1 (or short -d 1, lowercase \"d\").\nThis sounds like a question more suitable for the hashcat forum: https://hashcat.net/forum , because the community over there will know what you have to do (or just use the forum search function). The github issues are meant for development (bug reports/new features etc) and therefore not the correct place for user questions like this.\nThanks\nBTW: do not forget to close the issue if fixed. What are you trying to do ? Where are you trying to build it ?\nDo you use a windows system ?\nThe usual way we compile the binary is (by following the BUILD.md instruction of course) using an ubuntu LTS system with mingw cross-compilers installed (of course make/gcc and other tools - e.g. built-essential on ubuntu - need to be installed too).\nWithout any more information it's very difficult for us to understand what you are trying to do and how you are compiling it (and therefore difficult to understand why it fails for you)?\nPlease give more details what you are doing and what this CreateProcess()/process_begin  etc has to do with hashcat compilation etc !\nThx\nBTW: I think this some kind of android stuff. Android is not officially supported by hashcat and therefore you shouldn't really report errors (and especially not reporting errors without mentioning that you are compiling for Android. This is very confusing for devs if they do not know what is going on and what you are trying to do). If you are trying to get hashcat working on Android you would probably need to make a lot of changes/patches... and even then it would probably just be extremely slow because the OpenCL support on mobile devices is just bad as far as I know (let alone the problem with heating/temperature and power consumption etc) . did you try with cygwin instead ?\nI think you would need several packages also for cygwin (like gcc, make, libiconv-devel etc) but it should work\nThe devs usually cross-compile the binary for windows under linux by using the x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc cross-compiler and the win-iconv dependency.\nI'm pretty sure that several users managed to compile hashcat directly under windows. If the BUILD.md is not up to date and if it does not mention all the instruction steps, we should probably improve it.\nFor instance, I see that there is no mention of win-iconv within BUILD.md (needed for cross-compilation on a Linux host system) at all. That's not good.\nIf you can, please help to improve it.\nThat said, it should work with both mingw/cygwin/msys, because we tested this in the past (I personally didn't test it lately unfortunately).. maybe this helps: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33674973/makefile-error-make-e-2-the-system-cannot-find-the-file-specified,  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3848357/createprocess-no-such-file-or-directory etc\nyou are either missing some packages / libs or didn't setup mingw correctly.\nI would suggest trying the solutions suggested for the CreateProcess errors on stackoverflow.\nprobably gcc is not installed or not working (try to compile a hello world program for instance). Why are you emphasizing that this is a problem with benchmark ? I guess it's also not working during a \"normal' attack, right?\nI would suggest removing all drivers with this guide https://hashcat.net/faq/wrongdriver and only installing the Intel driver (as per https://hashcat.net/hashcat) from intel.com. if the plains contain a \":\" character, they should use the $HEX[] notation.\nI think it's more correct to use the last occurrence, because some hash types have \":\" within the hash line because of the salt etc\nI think your change breaks some other hash type support, doesn't it ?\nWhy do you have \":\" in the plain after alll ? hashcat should use $HEX[] to output those passwords. my response to this is that we shouldn't mix up outfiles with potfiles and that potfiles should (and do!) always use the $HEX[] notation, as it is also needed!\nI think it's only a problem on your site because you are using outfiles as potfiles, aren't you ?\n--outfile-autohex-disable shouldn't change the format of potfiles.\nI don't think changing the separator etc is a good idea.\nWe just should use potfiles (do not use --potfile-disable if you want to use --show/--left and profit from the speed improvement by avoiding duplicate work, i.e. cracking the same hashes and/or trying the same salts again and again) and those potfiles should (continue to) use $HEX[] if needed and the format should stay AS-IS.\nI think no changes are needed if you use the potfile correctly, or am I missing something here?\nThx. there are plenty of ways to convert $HEX[] to non-hex.\ne.g.\nhashcat --show -m 1000 --outfile-format 2 hash.txt | hashcat --stdout\nI think the problem with -m 3000 (which is very special) is that you could have two parts and hashcat (it seems) currently does not combine 2 $HEX[x],$HEX[y] parts correctly into 1 larger $HEX[x+y].\nThis could be improved indeed !. This algorithm was added recently with commit d0d4ce9 .\nsee https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1650\n(this issue was basically a duplicate of #1650, asking for -m 18800 = Blockchain, My Wallet, Second Password (SHA256)). can't reproduce over here. that's a very weird problem.\nhow should it be always the second attempt. who is counting up to 2 ?\nbut jokes aside, do you have only problems with --stdout or is this also happening with \"normal\" runs ?\nwe might need to do a make DEBUG=1 run and get more debugging info about the kernel problem\nI guess it has to do with your macOS driver, maybe it's somehow unstable/broken etc. It seems also the current version still uses PBKDF2 (see https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/c1e55147c91f9be219f2dd824d3ab6f9b39d5c3b/services/backup/java/com/android/server/backup/BackupPasswordManager.java#L135-L136), older explanation https://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/06/unpacking-android-backups.html and https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1730309\nWe would at least need some examples to confirm and a way to \"extract\" the data.\nI really thought that Android did move to SCRYPT completely/everywhere.\nDoes somebody know if this is true ? I mean the BackupPasswordManager.java is kind of very clear that it's \"just\" PBKDF2 with 10000 rounds (see https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/e80b45506501815061b079dcb10bf87443bd385d/services/backup/java/com/android/server/backup/utils/PasswordUtils.java#L37) and AES encryption\nI guess PBKDF2 is used because it's easier to combine with the AES encryption, but afaik the  on-device full disk encryption (FDE) is also done with scrypt, isn't it ?\nNote: this is the non-github link: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base.git/+/refs/heads/master/services/backup/java/com/android/server/backup/BackupPasswordManager.java\non googlesource.com. update: just checked if john the ripper (jtr) supports it already. and it seems it was recently added (summer 2018) in jtr:\n1. extractor: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/27f51880a4daf1372a115a49c2e04b9fb2406209/run/androidbackup2john.py\n2. key derivation and pass check: https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/27f51880a4daf1372a115a49c2e04b9fb2406209/src/androidbackup_fmt_plug.c#L195-L203\nThank you very much for the help/suggestion. Thanks for confirming.\nI think it makes sense because we have this patch from 2018/12/06 https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1805 and latest hashcat version v5.1.0 was released 2018/12/02 (therefore about 4 days earlier than the fix).\nIn general the betas are kind of \"experimental\", but due to very hard work by the devs they are actually quite stable and reliable (most of the time). You can use it the same way you use the release version and after a new release version will be available, you should/could update to that one (it will be listed here https://hashcat.net/hashcat a version > 5.1.0 in the future).\nFor the time being, you should be able to use the beta without any major problems/disadvantages :)\n(you can read the always-changing changelog here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat/master/docs/changes.txt if you are interested what is new and what was changed between the versions, including beta versions).\n@jsteube I think we can close this issue :). Please use the same format that we used for other hash modes i.e.:\n- Added hash-mode  1470 = sha256(sha256($pass))\n. hmm, could/should this be improved with something like this:\n```\n   hc_timer_t s;\ns.tv_sec  = hr_tmp.tv_sec  - a.tv_sec;\n   s.tv_usec = hr_tmp.tv_usec - a.tv_usec;\nif (s.tv_usec < 0)\n   {\n     s.tv_sec  -= 1;\n     s.tv_usec += 1000;\n   }\ndouble r = ((double) s.tv_sec * 1000) + ((double) s.tv_usec / 1000);\nreturn r;\n???\n( I didn't test it, but if I look at the other branch - the #else - it seems to be more consistent)\nwe could also perform the return after the branch (because it is common code to both branches) and the variable definition of hc_timer_t s before the branches (but this isn't too important, it just would emphasize where the main differences between the 2 cases are, i.e. the nsec vs usec etc). the format we normally use is\nswitch (otp_offset & 3)\n(spaces before the opening bracket and between the operators). idem (formatting). idem (add spaces). idem (missing spaces). formatting:\nplain_len = strlen ((const char ) temp_buf);\n. should be:\nplain_ptr = (u8 ) strdup ((const char ) temp_ptr);\n(with added space). idem (space before the opening bracket).\ntimestamp = hc_strtoul ((const char ) salt_pos, NULL, 10);\n.\nsalt->salt_buf[i] = byte_swap_32 (timestamp);\n.\nsnprintf (out_buf, out_len - 1, \"%06d:%d\", digest_buf[1], byte_swap_32 (salt.salt_buf[1]) * 30);\n.\nmy $paddedTime = sprintf (\"%016x\", int (int ($salt_buf) / 30));\n.\nmy $data = pack ('H', $paddedTime);\n.\n$tmp_hash = sprintf (\"%06d:%d\", $token, int ($salt_buf));\n. I think it doesn't make much sense to use a loop here. It's a little bit distracting/confusing.\nI would suggest to unroll it and therefore make it clearer how the single salt_buf[x] will look like (2 assignments).\nsalt->salt_buf[0] = byte_swap_32 (timestamp >> 32);\nsalt->salt_buf[1] = byte_swap_32 (timestamp >>  0);\n. ideally we would use this format:\nswitch (otp_offset & 3)\nadd a further space after \"switch\" on all instances of this switch(). minor formatting problem: there is a tab character here. compiler complains about the type incompatibility (int vs u32x), we probably need to use u32x types here and modify the switch () code accordingly. there is a bug here, must be:\n   u64 timestamp = hc_strtoull ((const char ) salt_pos, NULL, 10);\n(i.e. use hc_strtoull () for 64 bit, instead of hc_strtoul () which would only allow 32 bit). I found that the hashes can't be cracked multiple times this way (e.g. the output of hashcat can't be cracked again for certain hashes, e.g. \"hashcat\" -> 504267:85457442135216). My suggestion here is something like this:\n      u64 tmp = (((u64) byte_swap_32 (salt.salt_buf[0])) << 32) | ((u64) byte_swap_32 (salt.salt_buf[1]));\n  tmp *= 30;\n\n  snprintf (out_buf, out_len - 1, \"%06d:%lu\", digest_buf[1], tmp);\n\n```\n(and remove the comment about the 32 bit is enough)\nNote: we need 64 bit because the * 30 could also overflow etc. do we really need python code here?\nI didn't find anything that can't be done with perl directly in the code block below. Maybe I'm missing something.\nPlease explain why you use python here. in general (a general question/discussion): it would also make sense to use a single additional programming language if perl really has absolutely no way/modules to do it. I think using PHP and python is acceptable, but if we can avoid it and stick to 1 additional language it would be even better. (I think the reason why we added the PHP code was just that perl had no modules and we needed that mode during a cmiyc contest etc... therefore it was a quick \"hack\"). yeah, I figured that out. so my idea would be to convert the code of -m 11900 = PBKDF2-HMAC-MD5 to python too such that we only have the python dependency. Do you think that makes sense? hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac in python2 probably ?\nFurthermore, the base64 conversion of the words/salts (https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/tools/test.pl#L8226-L8227) should be done also for the python code. We do this to avoid any code injection and also to avoid any strange/special characters as input resulting in strange behaviour (this should be pretty easy to do in python too, just encode in perl and decode the strings in python).\nwe should also update tools/install_modules.sh if we need any additional/special python modules (btw: should we rename the file \"install_modules.sh\" into something that explains that this is needed for tests ? (install_test_modules.sh ? test_install_modules.sh ?) \nBTW: I do not think everything I mentioned here should be done within this commit/PR, the PHP->python could/should be a separate PR/issue (it's just something I noticed here and wanted to mention and ask if python is really the way to go here) . What I noticed here is that you allow the file names to be included within the hash. As you can see here https://hashcat.net/wiki/example_hashes , we never include the file names within the hashes.\nI think to be consistent, we also need to stick with -m 18400 to the standard format that hashcat doesn't use file names within the hashes (except if needed by the hashing algorithm). The problem is that if we add this \"suffix\" here, we would need to add it to many, many other formats too (like ms office, docx, pdf etc).\nIn my opinion the hash shouldn't be mixed with a file name (we could in theory use the --username feature to add some extra data/info at the beginning of the single lines of a hash file).. hmm, shouldn't these len_min == len_max all using TOKEN_ATTR_FIXED_LENGTH instead ?. minor consideration: we normally do not add any lines/entries for new tests in docs/changes.txt (except if the tests were missing in older releases and we finally managed to complete/add the tests). I think it is enough to just have the other line under Algorithms, because usually if we add a new algo it comes accompanied with tests (as in this case). Again, this is not really a problem. It's just a note and a hint to make it more consistent for other/future PRs ;). ",
    "jsteube": "Problem solved with PR https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/pull/2\n. Thanks, that worked!\n. Sorry, I don't understand what you mean, could you please rephrase?\n. I see, that is indeed interessting especially for the CPU part, but definitly a long-term suggestion.\n. You're right. Now that we're not forced any longer to ship binary kernels we could allow other platforms than AMD to run the OpenCL kernels. Sure, some of the optimizations wouldn't work. However I'm absolutely positive about this, especially as it would give us an easy start into support CPU as well. I'll look into this in some time, but would also would be happy on any help on it\n. Yeah I'd like to do so, but the most important reason for using CUDA is that only with CUDA it's possible to cross-compile GPU code using nvcc's -arch option. So we'd have a strange situation in which we'd use OpenCL on Nvidia if the users chooses to use the JIT but for binary distribution we still need to use CUDA. That sounds very complicated. BTw, there was such an option back in earlier versions of NVidia OpenCL runtime, but it got dropped without any reason.\nAnd yes there's also the reason with the performance:\na) While this is just speculation, it seems NV isn't really happy with OpenCL. It's obvious that they try to push CUDA instead of OpenCL, for business reasons.\nb) I remember with driver change somewhere between 150.x and 200.x the speeds for the OpenCL began to drop by 15% without any reason or any change within the ptx. It's also speculation but I think they tried to artificially slow down OpenCL to make CUDA more interessting.\n. It seems we have alot of good reasons to fully switch to OpenCL. I've tried that yesterday but it's more complicated than one would think in the first place. We need to get rid of all of our C++ code (which is mostly only overloaded functions) because NVidias OpenCL runtime does not support C++. But there's no way around, since so many other tasks depend on this change.\n. For those interessted in development: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/tree/GetRidOfCUDA\n. @shellster The whole Jetson TK1 discussion makes no sense since they dropped the support for the board with CUDA 7.0: https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/805540/no-cuda-7-0-support-for-jetson-tk1-board/\n@magnumripper I'll drop CUDA completely not just because it's easier to maintain afterwards but also because it makes the host code easier to read. If I remove the code from the host, there's no sense in keeping the NV folder. If anyone really wants it simply checkout an older version. PS: The CUDA branch uses already an OpenCL/ folder\n. So far the GetRidOfCUDA branch works, all unit-tests passed. Now we have to focus on the performance, and there's a lot to do! I justed started a sheet for comparison:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1S_t1Z0KsqByH3pNkYUM-RCFMu860nlfSsYEqOoqco/edit#gid=0\nDon't get shocked by those early numbers, I'm confident we'll stabilize them after optimizing each single kernel\n. FYI, first version working with pocl now\n. You can not, however the depencies were reduced to only a few which you can automatically install using tools/deps.sh -- see building.md\n. Just wanted to update the status on CPU here. It seems pocl works fine, but LLVM is buggy (even the latest LLVM 3.7).\nThe native AMD OpenCL CPU driver works really really good, all Unit-Tests pass. Speeds are almost the same as with pocl.\nThe native Intel OpenCL CPU driver also seem to work very good, but not all Unit-Tests pass (I'll have to look into that). But then the speeds are really good, much faster than with pocl.\n. I think we're finished with this issue. All OpenCL platforms from all the differen vendors that I've tested, on all OS, seem to work fine.\n. What about lowend GPU's? I'm not sure they could load all 4k kernels. But still interessting, how much was the startup time?\n. While implementing I just realized that there's no JIT support yet for NV in oclHashcat. Since I always start development on AMD I never really thought about. But luckily it seems with latest CUDA SDK they added support for JIT using the CUDA driver API (not the runtime). For example there is cuLinkCreate(). I have to play with that and see if it works for what we need.\n. This is getting annoying. So the cuLinkCreate() is not able to compile from source, only from .ptx. \nActually there's no easy solution to compile from source as you know it from OpenCL, but with CUDA SDK v7.0 NVidia added a library NVRTC which targets this missing feature. But then, NVRTC works only on 64 bit, but not 32 bit, for some unknown reason:\n\n2.1. System Requirements\nNVRTC requires the following system configuration:\nOperating System: Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64, or Mac OS X.\n\nAnother problem of this is, the user would need to install the CUDA SDK, because the library is not part of the driver distribution. OTOH, if one has installed the CUDA SDK then we can also simply call nvcc to compile from source to PTX and this will work for 32 bit and 64 bit. But run a system command to compile a kernel out of the program, how ugly is this, not to mention all the things that could possibly go wrong here. \nI'm a bit stuck here now.\n. Pushed https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/968265fffb8d9f929ec18862c461031e1a7b8e83 which enables this feature for AMD. Still unknown how to proceed with NV\n. Maybe we should really switch to OpenCL and obsolete CUDA?... \n. I've decide to switch to OpenCL fully, once we did this, we can finished this enhancement\n. Implemented :)\n. Just to note this here, the code is -not- tab indented. It's a 2-space indention.\n. Can you please send in a PR for this?\n. It's a good idea, but I'd suggest to start with a smaller goal. You still can extend it afterwards. Start with a more simple API version that works like the iptables API. You simply generate the commandline parameter as you'd call the binary and push that as a string to the API initialization call. Getops doesn't care where the array it works on is coming from. Is it really argc/argv or some artifical one, it doen't matter. Such a concept also minimize the changes required to the core code. We may need another wrapper function that you get the data for the status view unless you want to directly access the global data structure.\n. Hmm, I'm not sure if this is what we want. I think you're already one level too deep. \nIn code, my plan was that an integration would look something like this:\n``` C\nint main (int argc, char **argv) {\nhc = oclhashcat_init()\noptions.hash_file = \"example0.hash\"\noptions.markov_threshold = 32\noptions.words_files.append(\"example.dict\")\noptions.mask = \"?a?a?a?a\"\n\nchar **v;\nint c;\nrc = hc.generate_commandline (&c, &v);\n\nstatus = hc.start(c, v)\n}\n```\nGiven such a construct, the codechange to oclHashcat would be minimal, we'd end up in a very fast implementation. oclHashcat will have the both arguments as it would be the original ones from the commandline (argc and argv). That's how iptables works, too.\n. Well, that would work, but then I don't see any benefit. My Idea is going more into a direction like the following, what we can do is something like this:\n``` C\nifdef API_CALL\nint apimain (int argc, char **argv)\nelse\nint main (int argc, char **argv)\nendif\n```\nNow if you add -DAPI_CALL to the CFLAGS and compile oclHashcat.c with -c you should be able to call apimain (c, v); as a normal C function and integrate it that way into your library.\n. For example you could start list what else do you need. Invokation is one thing but I guess you also want a function to get stats and so on. For that I'd suggest making a new function that does nothing else than to return the values one could need, for example to read the speed, get the number of cracked hashes, and so on...\n. Not sure what you're saying now. Do you criticize that you have to add more code to work in C than in other languages? I think the getter/setter method is the cleanest.\n. That looks really cool so far. I didn't test in detail. A function to return a pointer to data structure should be easy to accomplish.\nNote that due to the issue #3 and #20 there have been tons of changes that also includes the rename of some of the variables and macros. Please update your proposal so that I can do a testrun, afterwards I'll add the function for you to access data\n. @Rich5 I think you're on the right track. Using the global data structure was what I had in mind as well. I'd recommend to simply add a function to oclHashcat.c which access and parses the data and returns it in some format you can work with from within your wrapper API. Note that this variable is global, so you need to have some sort of instance management, like doing a fork. Since you only read from that variable, there's no need for any kind of synchronization, like mutexes or so. You just need to run the main function in a seperate thread inside your wrapper (after the fork()) then you can call the newly added function in a seperate thread. \n. This is very interessting. If you merge it, would it still be possible to use hashcat as it is now? Like running from commandline. What are the exact changes you would do?\n. Looks goods, but I need a full PR to decide. Please send it in. Note I'm about to release hashcat 3 soon.\n. The refactoring into a library is more or less finished. I think it's safe to start.\n. Yes it's an alternative way to the events if you want to access the last\nerror occured (if any).\nOn 31.10.2016 20:06, Rich5 wrote:\n\nSounds good. I'll let you know if any issues comes up.

I think the best solution to do it the same way as hashcat does when using \"make install\". To do that, I need to patch the detection of libhashcat.so the same was as hashcat already does for the hashcat binary. That way, it expects the files at the following paths:\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/hashcat\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/bin\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/docs\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/extra\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/extra/tab_completion\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/hashcat/charsets\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/hashcat/masks\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/hashcat/OpenCL\ninstall -m 755 -d                                    /usr/local/share/hashcat/rules\ninstall -m 644 example.dict                          /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/\ninstall -m 644 example0.hash                         /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/\ninstall -m 644 example400.hash                       /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/\ninstall -m 644 example500.hash                       /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/\ninstall -m 755 example0.sh                           /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/\ninstall -m 755 example400.sh                         /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/\ninstall -m 755 example500.sh                         /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/\ninstall -m 644 extra/tab_completion/hashcat.sh       /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/extra/tab_completion/\ninstall -m 644 extra/tab_completion/howto.txt        /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/extra/tab_completion/\ninstall -m 755 extra/tab_completion/install          /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/extra/tab_completion/\ninstall -m 644 hashcat.hcstat                        /usr/local/share/hashcat/\ninstall -m 644 hashcat.hctune                        /usr/local/share/hashcat/\ninstall -m 755 hashcat                      /usr/local/bin/\nfind docs/     -type d -exec install -m 755 -d    /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/{} \\;\nfind charsets/ -type d -exec install -m 755 -d    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nfind masks/    -type d -exec install -m 755 -d    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nfind OpenCL/   -type d -exec install -m 755 -d    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nfind rules/    -type d -exec install -m 755 -d    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nfind docs/     -type f -exec install -m 644 {}    /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/{} \\;\nfind charsets/ -type f -exec install -m 644 {}    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nfind masks/    -type f -exec install -m 644 {}    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nfind OpenCL/   -type f -exec install -m 644 {}    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nfind rules/    -type f -exec install -m 644 {}    /usr/local/share/hashcat/{}   \\;\nsed -i 's/\\.\\/hashcat/hashcat/'                      /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/example0.sh\nsed -i 's/\\.\\/hashcat/hashcat/'                      /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/example400.sh\nsed -i 's/\\.\\/hashcat/hashcat/'                      /usr/local/share/doc/hashcat/example500.sh\nSo that's basically /usr/local/share/ for the kernels and other static files and $HOME/.hashcat/ for everything related to user specific data like cached kernels. What do you think?. With latest commits I've\n\n\nFixed that _GNU_SOURCE problem you had and fixed as suggested.\n\n\n\nThis commit splits the native hashcat binary into the hashcat library and hashcat frontend.\nI've tested this with Linux and Msys2. I hope it will work on FreeBSD, OSX and Cygwin as well.\nThere's also four new dedicated makefile targets for install: install_library install_hashcat install_docs install_shared\nAlso the main_shared.c and its makefile target have been removed, as the main frontend is the best example possible\nIOW, once you ran \"make install\" on your linux box there will be a libhashcat.so copied to /usr/local/lib which you can access as usual. I suggest to read the followin sections from main.c\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/main.c#L911-L924\nand \nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/main.c#L964\nThis shows how the new hashcat frontend gets the two important paths install_folder and shared_folder. I think in your case you can simply set them static to what's defined here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/Makefile#L45-L47\nBut this way it's your decision if you want you can do some own runtime logic or use the static paths (even if they do not neccessarily exist, which is the trick here).\n. OK, but the Idea would have been to call it like this:\n```\nself->rc_init = hashcat_session_init(self->hashcat_ctx, \"/usr/bin\",\n\"/usr/local/share/hashcat\", 0, NULL, 0);\n```\nI just changed the install_folder path to \"/usr/bin\", which is where\nPython is installed, right? If you do that, then it should work as we\nwant without any code change. At least I think so. Or, If you can find\nout the directory where Python is running out of, but in the runtime,\nthat would be the ideal solution.\nOn 30.12.2016 06:45, Rich5 wrote:\n\nActually, I'm not sure this fixed it.

OK, merged. Good work, thanks!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. @Xanadrel please fix your wording\nHowever, SL3 is not going to be re-implemented\n. The issues on GitHub are for development discussions only. Please use our Forum instead:\nhttps://hashcat.net/forum/\n. Maybe, yes. Please find out by trying: -b --benchmark-mode 0 -n 1 -u 1 --runtime 30\n. There's one more thing to think about. I just thought about this the first time this morning. Imagine we implement this proposed change, how would the binary distribution look like for linux?\nIt would either require an install script to move the files to the above folders or it should stay as it is now.\nTherefore we should come back to the proposal from @philsmd on the hashat forum. Maybe I just did not realize on the forum that this is what he had in mind when he wrote it. \n- If the tool is called from the cwd, then set Install folder, Profile Folder and Session folder to the cwd\n- Otherwise use the proposed changes\n. Wait, it's important not to confuse the two different binary package we have:\n- RPM/DEB \n- The .7z for the distribution on hashcat.net\nFor the source tree, the RPM and the DEB, of course the real paths that I mentioned in the first comment are part of the Makefile so that anyone can change them at compile time. So if the users chooses the install folder /opt/bin then, for example, the oclHashcat binary will move to /opt/bin/oclHashcat. Like you'd expect it.\nBut, more importantly, we also have to think about the .7z binary package. The most users will use this package. But we don't want to ship an install script for that. We want that the user just unpacks the .7z and is ready to use it. Same way as with windows. But we're looking for a way that we do not have to build two different binaries. So far the idea is that the binary itself finds out on startup that it is used out of the .7z package if the CWD == the folder where the binary itself is lying. We'd just set all the paths, Install folder, Profile folder and Session folder to the CWD.\n. Maybe later, currently I'm not planing to integrate a config file\n. Before we can finalize this enhancement we need to switch to OpenCL fully, also for NVidia. This way we can reduce the number of produced binaries and we do not need to add any code to the Makefile to find out which type of binary needs to be compiled.\n. I don't even know what this is, but I know that you know what you're doing. Still, need one more sign-off by the board members to merge.\n. Thanks!\n. Today I got an email from an User asking for support to run the Host code on a Big Endian architecture CPU. I'm not sure if it's worth patching, especially since this requires a huge effort. Why should someone want to do this? Is there any CPU that is BE architecture and so fast that it's really useful to run oclHashcat on it?\n. Thanks for testing!\n. From what I've seen the Jetson TK1 does not support OpenCL, only CUDA.\nSo the Error message would be OK.

Yeah hashcat forum should be the correct platforms for this\n. Just added with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/e0c3f447da5b6f22321ae1e0660c41e1d01611d1\n. Added to hashcat v3.10 thanks to @hops \n. There was alot of changes due to due Get rid of CUDA branch. Please send in a new PR based on the current master\n. Implemented with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/87c24200da61ab5ca251b5e07af70ae6cd04297f. I just want to comment the real background of this issue here. AMD's Catalyst driver doesn't really install it's own 'libOpenCL.so' correctly in /usr/lib because it installs it as 'libOpenCL.so.1' and forgets to symlink back to 'libOpenCL.so'. NVidias ForceWare is more clever and installs it, so this problem never occurs in NV installations anyway. \n. As an alternative to all this we could think of using:\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-ICD-Loader\nThe first one provides the CL/cl.h and the second one the libOpenCL.so. This is the Khronos OSS reference implementation.\nOb Ubuntu/Debian (mayber others, too) those exist as installable packages. Both without any depencies:\nopencl-headers\nocl-icd-libopencl1\nWe should look into them and maybe switch. This would also enable us to drop the depency on amd-app-sdk which is weird anyway for NVidia users\n. While working on it it turns out on ubuntu 14.04 it needs another package:\nocl-icd-opencl-dev\nBut this package is somehow broken in 15.04 (wants to uninstall xorg-server and such). We need to make sure in deps.sh that this package is selected only in case the libOpenCL.so wasn't created\n. Replaced with https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/dc13c2fc71c8c9e3af66ceaa9dfc8ff34cb56bfb\n. You're right, it was just forgotten\n. I haven't used VCL for a long long while. Is it still maintained? But you're right, could be worth a look. There was specialized VCL code in old oclHashcat but it was mostly for handling binary kernel data instead of the source kernel data. It should (in theory) work out of the box once all OpenCL platforms are supported. I'm currently working on this\n. Yeah, I remember, that was some special \"helper\" function. The developer told me to use it for binary kernel. VCL is unable, if it's a binary kernel, to determine if some kernel argument was either a cl_mem or some other datatype.\nBTW, for the VCL tests, you can try to force the use of source kernel by setting force_jit_compilation variable to 1500 or so. This is just a hack but should do it for a test. If it turns out to help we could add a commandline option to do it.\n. With latest version on GitHub we've switched to device-vendor, as your suggested. I guess it should work now, of couse, you need to make sure the include files exist on all the nodes, as you wrote. Do you think we can close this issue?\n. Or, due to the changes related to platform and device vendor, can you simply try it again now? Maybe it will work out of the box now.\n. Hey @magnumripper any updates on this?\n. Yep, that would work for now and is the current state of the art of using prince with oclHashcat. \nHowever, now that we are not more limited by SIMD code in the kernel, we maybe can look again into adding this attack-mode. There's at least a few chances :) Any volunteers for implementing?\n. I think you're a tad bit late for this change. Please see the changes discussed here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/issues/20\nThis issue addressed all the general problems maintainer could have when trying to build packages for oclHashcat and should solve it with current master branch.\nYou, as a package maintainer, are one of the people why we did that change. It would be really nice if you could please find out if this change helps you in integrating oclHashcat in your packaged version or if we are still missing something (like the the bool thing from above)\n. Patch 1) I liked some parts of your patch, especially the fix for the bool type. I've modified a bit and pushed to master as part of this patch:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/0ff49c5b44bbe0eab4daa3b76389c66c306e4669\nPatch 2) I liked the idea of having a human-readable error message for the OpenCL error codes. Unfortionally the reference OpenCL API does not have something like strerror (), therefore I think we actually need to use such a switch () composition. However I'd like to have it in full, not just for clBuildProgram (). Maybe you can provide a full switch block and patch all the wrapped functions?\nPatch 2) I didn't like the idea of having an description which variable/option a failed fopen () belongs to. That's very untypical for unix-type tools, for example:\n$ cat x\ncat: x: No such file or directory\nPatch 3) With latest master version of oclHashcat and using the \"normal\" make install version of oclHashat there's no more need for such a parameter. The session folder will be somewhere in $HOME/.hashcat/sessions/xxx which is something a user should have write-permissions to.\n. Sure, why not. I just hope someone can provide patches for it since I do not have an apple computer so I can't code it.\n. Full OSX support is almost finished thanks to @gm4tr1x \nIt's all in master if you want to test\n. @gm4tr1x can we close the issue?\n. Update: Now that we removed SIMD code (vector-datatypes) from the kernel this attack becomes feasible again.\n. Update: Support for RAR3 (with header encryption) was added. RAR3 (without header encryption) and RAR5 is still missing\n. Cool, it was indeed easy to add. Pushed with https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/f0a84a2410fe5832ee120c3cbe62a84dca42b511\n(Also a good example of how to add new hashes, should do a writeup on it)\nNow it's just RAR3 without header encryption missing.\n. Almost, there's still a variant which is not supported: RAR3 + not-encrypted headers.\n. Since rar3-hp and rar5 was added, there's only rar3-p missing. Therefore this issue is continue on a dedicated issue for this mode: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1334. Note we've added WinZip support, PKZIP is still missing\n. Update: With latest versoin from GIT we opened oclHashcat in a way that all OpenCL compatible platforms should be able to work. Maybe this does work now, someone needs to test\n. I've patched those cases and for GCN and newer, MESA is now fully supported. And you're right, It's much slower than catalyst because of missing rotate() and bitselect(). Anyway that's beyond our scope. If they decide to map it to the hardware instruction we will automatically make use of it anyway.\n. please add more descriptions[:] like algorithm, example hashes, etc\n. support added with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/7e5b8d3f25821c7c8707190f074739c9370554b4. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/565\n. Done with https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/pull/225\n. @neheb Is that somehow related to your patch?\n. I tested latest hashcat v3.00 inside a cygwin shell and it seems to work fine. OP : please reopen if it's not working for you\n. OK, i see. Well in that case there's no way without a true cygwin makefile target in order to set the macros to use the posix way of doing handling the user input.\n. sha-3 is now in FIPS 180-4 http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf\nwe should develop hash-mode according to this reference \n. Done with latest beta version\n. Please use the generic hash mode as philsmd described, this will work fine.. Added with https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/332b3c35e5b7023a681a3b42a296bc423077ff5d\nPlease test\n. yw :)\n. I've recently added KPA for DES. I'm thinking about doing the same for RC4 after the refactoring, but I'm thinking about a fixed 40 bit key length, not a variable one. Also I don't think about adding support for that DropN length, except if you would know a software or protocol that uses RC4 in 40 bit mode using this technique. The key range can be limited with -l (and offset with -s to allow distributed search).\n. Update: We do have bitslice now\n. Implemented as -m 14000 - have fun :)\n. implemented :)\n. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/565\n. I agree to @philsmd here. I don't see a clear benefit of switching. Please reopen if you strongly believe we need to change this.\n. Continue here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/565\n. Continue here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/565\n. I think it's safe to use a fixed filename for the potfile. I don't see any good reason for a session-depending filename for the potfile. I've pushed the change to latest master.\n. Should be fixed with latest github version\n. @ OP if you read this, we think this is fixed with hashcat v3.00. If not, please reopen the ticket\n.

This is obviosly user-defined error, not a bug.\n. That's correct, the FAQ needs to be updated. This is some feature a while ago. It's as you said, it's always the bigger wordlist\n. This is the wrong project, you did post to the oclHashcat project. Please open the ticket again in hashcat.\n. Support was added with #453 . Support added to latest beta\n. Should be implemented with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/9fc193ce47d5be59460fb00ee26c80bae84fab96. Please use -s and -l for distrubuted computing, it's really the best way to do is.\n. I just got another Idea. Can we maybe spawn a VM and just assign it like 24 CPU's? Since we now have support for CPU this could work...\n. @A-Circle-Zhang BF, even md5, with 256^8 is almost impossible, especially with multiple salts. If you otherwise do not intend to BF and use wordlists instead then the script from @epixoip should be fast enough. as an alternative you can also try to use md5-half kernel and simply and-out the unneccessary additional bits. See m00190 as an example for that, which had to deal with a similar problem\n. Hey, first for thinking of building a proper package for Kali. We really need this!\nMy comments on this so far:\n1) Why do you want to ship the SDK at all? You don't need to ship the SDK. All you need is the ADL library itself (the .so files) and those are part of the Catalyst driver package. That's why it's enough for endusers to simply install Catalyst and oclHashcat will work. Users really need this feature to avoid burning their hardware.\n2) With oclHashcat v2.10 there's no more CUDA at all. NVidia devices will use OpenCL runtime the same way as AMD devices. You don't need to worry about CUDA anymore! This also enabled us to use OpenCL CPU drivers. See here for details: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/issues/4 and https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/issues/3\n3) There's no ./configure in oclHashcat because we do not use autotools. There are people working on it but I think it will take some time. Anyway even with autotools we'd need to change the code so that it accepts an build without hardware-management. But in regards to 1) I don't think we'd need such a solution.\n4) oclHashcat v2.10 had lots of changes to make it more easy for maintainer to integrate it into a packaging system. Basically you simply set the PREFIX in Makefile as you'd do it with ./configure and the files were installed on there after running make install. Files created for sessions or kernel cache are stored in home directory. See here for details: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/issues/20\n. Just to make this complete: Both you as the maintainer and the package endusers do not need any of those SDK:\n- CUDA SDK \n- AMD APP SDK\nThose actually create more problems than they do good. All you both need is the NVidia ForceWare driver or the AMD Catalyst driver. They include all the libraries oclHashcat need to run.\nOnly you as the maintainer who builds a native binary needs the following additional SDK:\n- ADL SDK\n- GDK\n. Well I don't know enough about package maintainance. All I can say is that you need the ADL SDK only for building the binary package. Using something like a build-depend package sounds good but in this case you need to avoid it. Again, you do not distribute the SDK you just use it for building. Therefore the license doesn't apply.\nDon't confuse the vendors ICD with the vendors OpenCL runtimes: Check out this post for a much more detailed explanation: http://wiki.tiker.net/OpenCLHowTo\nThe ICD's from NV and AMD should not be used. Ideally there's also a OSS ICD from Khronos Group. For example I'm using Ubuntu, such a package exist on there.\nYou will find out that for all the different OpenCL compatible devices they usually need a vendor driver. Intel has one for the GPU and CPU, AMD has one for their GPU and CPU and NV has  one for their GPU. There also exists other vendors that provide runtimes for FPGA, for example. \nThe User has to pick the right one for his hardware. For example if he installs the NVidia ForceWare because he has a NVidia GPU, the driver also ships an OpenCL runtime library. Also it will put a configuration for the OpenCL ICD folder in order to \"register\" it's own OpenCL runtime library. \nWhen oclHashcat starts up, it checks which drivers are registered at the ICD and loads all the available runtimes.\nNo magic here :)\n. @rhertzog What's the status? Do you need anything?\n. About the non-free thing. oclHashcat does not depend on catalyst by default. It's only required if you want to use AMD GPU. The same is true for Forceware + Nvidia.\nAnyway, with latest oclHashcat in theory you could run it with only pocl, which I'm not sure if it is completely free or not but I'd think so.\n. @rhertzog What exactly do we need to change to make you happy?\n. @rhertzog It should be possible now to compile oclHashcat without ADL/NVML/NVAPI completely. Do you think we can close this issue now or do we need to do additional changes?\n. @magnumripper sounds like a plan :+1: \n. I've tried to reproduce on my 750Ti but can not:\n1 hash: 162.7 MH/s\n15 hashes: 147.0 MH/s\nIs this with beta38 ?\n. Yes, please retry with the latest beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/\n. OK, the performance problem seems to be fixed. If there's some new error please open a new issue. 1 error = 1 issue, It's much easier this way.\n. Please retry with latest GitHub version, I think this change should solve it:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/49d0767aa8118b60d4caba64ebd808b5e64baa4e\nYou can also try the latest beta build 44 from https://hashcat.net/beta/\n. Fixed\n. For me this sounds like a bad idea to compare FPGA/CPU with GPU using DES since DES is so extremely FPGA/CPU friendly. A comparison based on MD5 makes much more sense since this algorithms is friendly for both platforms.\nAnyway I think such an algorithm can make sense for known-plaintext based attacks since so many crypto schemes still base on raw DES but it should be mode-independant. You can anyway simply reverse the ECB from it before putting it to oclHashcat.\n. Wait, oclHashcat is neither +s nor it does run as a server process. I'm not getting it...\n. Two questions:\nWhich disadvantages does it have to add those flags? \nWill it work with all compilers we depend on like clang and mingw?\n. thanks!\n. Fixed with b55, thanks!\n. Also note that some algorithms, like md5crypt, they create some pseudo-base64. Good thing is their output size is fixed. It should be simple to overwrite some of the output, just in case they do not match the output length of the corrected base64 encoder (whenever you submit that patch).\n. In general I liked the idea, thanks! I'll push a patch to use \"git describe --tags --dirty=+\". \nBut, I don't want it to be shown on startup screen nor the --help menu. It will be shown when using the -V argument.\nIt's hard to explain my reasons for this, basically it goes back a mix of gut feelings, design and practical use reasons.\nI haven't decided if we'll change the filename convention as you suggested. It's possible that I'll add another push related to this issue, therefore I'll let it open for a while. Feel free to convince me if you really want it in startup screen and --help menu.\n. OK, we'll do that. My only concern is that beta tester need to understand that new output. For example at this time it will show v2.01 + X instead v2.10. This is very technical and even if this is more correct from a developing view it can be confusing for normal users, even beta testers.\n. The checksum in the version string from git describe --tags --dirty=+ is the first 7 chars from the commit hash that you can find git log. Note that I'm not commiting each beta I create therefore I can't add any tags\n. @roycewilliams do you think we can close this issue?\n. Thanks for that GDB dump. From there it looks like the crash is somewhere in the libamdocl12cl64.so which is part of the AMD catalyst drivers. The library is used the query fanspeed, and temperature from the device. Since it's not oclHashcat that crashes, we can't do anything to avoid it. But you can. From my experience this segfault is caused because you need to have X Authority and/or disable X11 ACLs with \"xhost +\". This can be a bit tricky if you run it over ssh.\nYou can also disable Hardware Monitoring --gpu-temp-disable.\n. Issue closes; OP not responding\n. Yes. Most texteditors have an option to select the CRLF. Also I know from some FTP tools to convert between CRLF depending on the selected Host OS so it's possible some scp tools inherited this behavior.\nAnyway I don't think this is an empty line problem. It's propably CRLF related.\n. @anlx-sl did the hint from @philsmd help? can we close the issue?\n. I made the same experience with the different OpenCL platforms. But I think it's the opposite direction we should go here:\n1) As sad as it sounds, I made the experience that it's the normal users that report back such warnings instead of the beta testers. I think it's because they're scared by it much more. Therefore I think it's better to no surpress them for the release version\n2) Such a verbose switch isn't too bad. Reason here is that if t's always the same warnings they becomes too \"normal\" and people (me included) tend to ignore/overlook them. This is bad because then it's hard to notice new warnings that could come up while changing the code which are actually important\n. https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/01a7adc12a86a516d848d286d8beb2fff6d01d36 should handle it\n. With commit https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/fc1be6bb85f597e36090506f12f7df9361c081eb the bug should be fixed, here's a log.\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 8900 SCRYPT:64:9:1:dGVhbWhhc2hjYXQ=====:IBNEidINyjp61QoQhb9Y8oYXLtJ2WZoZN0wSL6ta7eA= -a 3 hashca?1 -1 t -d 2\nhashcat (v3.00-beta-142-g9d2c24f) starting...\nDevice #1: AMD FX(tm)-6100 Six-Core Processor             , skipped\nDevice #2: Hawaii, 2858/4025 MB allocatable, 44MCU\nDevice #3: AMD FX(tm)-6100 Six-Core Processor, skipped\nDevice #4: GeForce GTX 750 Ti, skipped\nDevice #5: GeForce GTX 560 Ti, skipped\nHashes: 1 hashes; 1 unique digests, 1 unique salts\nBitmaps: 16 bits, 65536 entries, 0x0000ffff mask, 262144 bytes, 5/13 rotates\nApplicable Optimizers:\n- Zero-Byte\n- Single-Hash\n- Single-Salt\n- Brute-Force\n  Watchdog: Temperature abort trigger set to 90c\n  Watchdog: Temperature retain trigger disabled\nSCRYPT tmto optimizer value set to: 1, mem: 103809024\nATTENTION!\n  The wordlist or mask you are using is too small.\n  Therefore, hashcat is unable to utilize the full parallelization power of your device(s).\n  The cracking speed will drop.\n  Workaround: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#how_to_create_more_work_for_full_speed\nINFO: approaching final keyspace, workload adjusted       \nSCRYPT:64:9:1:dGVhbWhhc2hjYXQ=:IBNEidINyjp61QoQhb9Y8oYXLtJ2WZoZN0wSL6ta7eA=:hashcat\nSession.Name...: hashcat\nStatus.........: Cracked\nInput.Mode.....: Mask (hashca?1) [7]\nHash.Target....: SCRYPT:64:9:1:dGVhbWhhc2hjYXQ=:IBNEidINyj...\nHash.Type......: scrypt\nTime.Started...: 0 secs\nSpeed.Dev.#2...:        0 H/s (16.68ms)\nRecovered......: 1/1 (100.00%) Digests, 1/1 (100.00%) Salts\nProgress.......: 1/1 (100.00%)\nRejected.......: 0/1 (0.00%)\nStarted: Mon Jun  6 00:30:50 2016\nStopped: Mon Jun  6 00:30:57 2016 \n. I also don't see what sense it makes to have --gpu-temp-disable if we have HAVE_HWMON. It may confuse the user because being able to disable something implies that it's turned on by default, which it is not since it's not supported.\nI think what's the real reason behind this is that we want to use --gpu-temp-disable in test.sh but if we would run test.sh on OSX oclHashcat would stop instantly because it would report --gpu-temp-disable as an unknown parameter. From that view it might make sense to add it back.\n. OK, that's correct. It's only a few users using tools/test.sh, even less on osx, and those could remove the flag from test.sh manually. Now I understand what @philsmd means with lazy and I agree. Please remove that one patch about --gpu-temp-disable but send in a new one for the other changes from this PR\n. I think the problem is this one:\nhttps://github.com/gm4tr1x/oclHashcat/commit/479327fc20b1678d8d25c9cd6f422bf685fef769\n. What happens to OSX when using the default values?\n. I'm mostly OK with this PR but there's a few things I don't like. \nPlease fix that first:\n- KERNEL_LOOPS_* and KERNEL_ACCEL_* macro names should stay as they are. Please use #ifdef and create a full set of all algorithms for OSX for both accel and loops\n- You can do the same for the benchmark list. Don't forget to update NUM_DEFAULT_BENCHMARK_ALGORITHMS if you remove some algorithms\n- Do not use something like _TUNED\n. I think what we really need to make it \"perfect\" is a dlopen() loader for OpenCL as we already do for ADL and NVML. That would be great!\n. WOW! Good work, you must have been busy. I'll merge it but maybe rename some variable names.\n. Don't forget to create a PR for it\n. There's some more of such parameters like --opencl-platforms and --opencl-device-types do we need the same fix for them?\n. I think patching this is easy. All we need to check is if the compilation was a success and store the cached kernel in that case.\n. There's b64 in https://hashcat.net/beta if you want to test\n. This one is not related to the PR. Please open a new Issue for it and I'll look into it\n. Do you think a total of 112 chars for both salt and password is enough?\n. You said in an other discussion the salt length is fixed. What is that fixed salt length?\n. Everything > 112 is a problem, we can't do that easily without creating a new hash-mode for it. To do that we'd need to know where it is used in so that we can decide if it worth the effort\n. Do you need it for -m 1710 or -m 1720 ?\n. I'm working on it. Send me example hash and plain please.\nFormat: \nhash:salt\n. Nevermind that. I just played around an temporarily added support to -m 1720 and the speed instantly dropped from 620 MH/s to 440 MH/s. The problem is that this would also affect other modes, like -m 1722 (OSX) and that's why we can't add it to generic -m 17xx. For this mode to work, we need to add a completely new one, ideally with esalt. But before I'm going to do this I want to know where it's used in.\n. Support for passwords and salts up to length 256 was added. Cool, many Thanks! I'll close #164\n. We should also use those headers for Windows so that we can totally get rid of the #ifneq stuff in Makefile. Can you do that?\n. The PR 171 should have fixed it, can you retry please? \n. OK, now it should work :)\n. That would be great. Will it work on Windows, too?\n. Excellent, thanks!\n. I'm fine with it, but we'll need to check all the algorithms again using test.sh and ideally also update performance on our v2.10 sheet\n. I'll  change some stuff after merge\n. @Fist0urs can you please try again with the registry patch and tell us if it worked?\n. if you want to mod -n in -b mode you need to use --benchmark-mode 0\n. @Fist0urs can we close this?\n. Great work!\n. great work :+1: \n. Thanks! And I agree, I wish we could switch to setenv()\n. Cool!\n. I'm wondering if 4294967295 is really the VENDOR_Id. I'd say it's probably a -1 return code and they want to say something like \"Parameter unknown/not supported\".\n. Is the algorithm changed somehow or just different length?\n. Please read this this:\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this\nPlease answer on all the points listed\n. It seems we have a bigger problem related to this PR. All Intel CPU using Intels OpenCL runtime now return 1 as their preferred vector width. The only way of selecting the best vector width is to use the native one. Any Ideas?\ncc @philsmd \n. I think for hashcat that doesn't work, as we don't do any manual interlacing. OTOH, the PHI performance using CL_DEVICE_NATIVE_VECTOR_WIDTH_INT was pretty good. I'll switch back\n. WPA (-m 2500) is not converted to the new simd code yet. Actually none of the slow hashes is converted.  You can find out by looking on the kernel header for NEW_SIMD_CODE. I'll do that later. In the meanwhile you can test with all the -a 3 kernel, ideally -m 900. This one is converted and should beat JtR's speed on all device type.\n. With latest version from github, it should build out of the box by simplying running make. There's no more depencies now (unless you start cross compiling).\n. @Vladinator Any update here? \n. I've successfully build on RHEL 6.x with latest gihub version. It's simple as it can be. 1. git clone 2. make 3. fun\n. That feature is no longer required with the upcoming version hashcat v3.21 because of the following change:\n- Files: Use $HEX[...] in case the password includes the separater character...\n. In that case you can detect it by reading from right to left.\nOn 29.12.2016 12:34, d2-d2 wrote:\n\n@jsteube https://github.com/jsteube what if separator is also in salt?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/222#issuecomment-269617893,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJ83OX2TEeP7k-TMPwQo5ludWnWgyin0ks5rM5regaJpZM4HZKRl.\n\n\n. @averagesecurityguy @magnumripper you tried in the middle of the autotune integration work, maybe that cause some errors. please retry with latest beta or git version\n.

PR Merged, many thanks! Can we close #81 ?\n. Wait, if the function returns 0, then it's not cracked. Therefire I think the code, as it is, is fine. There's no need for extra checks with 12 bytes required.\n. Oh wait, maybe that's what the confusion is coming from:\nif (((out[2] & 0xff00ffff) != 0x30008163) && ((out[2] & 0x0000ffff) != 0x00008263)) return 0;\ndidn't you mean:\nif (((out[1] & 0xff00ffff) != 0x30008163) || ((out[2] & 0x0000ffff) != 0x00008263)) return 0;\n?\nAlso note the changed element number! Because if not, then there's actually only 5 bytes for check\n. Cool, is this for the PHI?\n. Support for hd6xxx series is getting dropped by AMD soon, so we'll not focus on them any longer. We'll optimize only for GPU's that are actually supported. I recommend upgrading your hardware.\n. Excellent, many thanks!\n. In theory, it should be easy to write that mode yourself. See -m 2610 if you need inspiration :)\n. Many thanks for the patch and the example data\n. I don't like the idea of a generic custom algo. JtR has such a \"language\" for CPU but it looks pretty complicated. There's alot of special cases that a user could need, or in other words, it can never be generic enough. Just an example: should the digest be in binary or encoded as ascii hex before hashing again, and if so, should it use lower or upper case. Do we need to truncate it at some point, etc. But the more complicated it becomes, the less useable it is.\nI think if you really need to crack such a special algorithm that is used only a single implementation you should use JtR or your own cracker and if the system that uses that algorithm becomes popular enough we will add it to hashcat anyway.\n. While there's a strong depency on it, that's not really a direct oclHashcat issue. @epixoip Please check this out\n. > I suggest that we should test with a modified/patched ADLODPerformanceLevels (with at least 2 array items) and see if that works without any problems/side effects.\nI think the same, we should do that\n. I agree we should have 2 debugging levels.\nThe first one should \"just\" enable -g, without optimizations and stripping. \nThe second one should be like the first, but additionally enable the sanitizer\nBtw, what about that \"-ggdb\" flag? Does that do any help?\n. There's two major problems in this report:\nA) Appears OP did you understand what --keyspace does. This is essential here.\nB) Parameter -s and -l is not supported in case -i is used.\n. That logfile exists and is build so that it can be parsed by a machine\n. @gm4tr1x can you please answer @philsmd question?

This is so hot, instant merge :)\nMany thanks!\n. @Fist0urs There's a new Intel OpenCL runtime version released. Should we retry if the problem still exist?\n. Any update here?. I've pushed a workaround. Tested on my local Intel CPU: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/3baec81d90c6046e42a6d10a40adda770d525826. Awesome! Many thanks!\n. There's currently no tutorial on how to add new hash-modes (I really should do that at some point). But several people managed to do it without. Just checkout the commit logs to find some of them.\n. I just added sha1($salt1.$pass.$salt2) with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/23917455efad1deba8c12516e192238f1609d8b7\nShould be easy enought to replace the sha1 with md5. Excellent! Many thanks\n. From all the documents I've found so far, the maximum password length for ArubaOS seem to be 64, not 32. This is confusing, what's the right value? I'm currently refactoring password length related kernels and therefore it's important ot have the correct value. I'll reject this as I don't see any advantage for hashcat. Also, in case of PasswordsPro updates it's default ruleset, who's going to update it then?\nThere's 2 things to consider:\n- Change JtR parsing/handling code for [ in case \"!! HashCat logic ON\" is used.\n- Change your default loading behavior for rules to what you call \"HashCat logic\" and create \"JtR-old logic\" you can use for your old default rulesets. That would make all rule handling of all tools compatible to each other. Background for this is that hashcat logic isn't hashcat logic, it's based on PasswordsPro.\n. It's good to know you were able to compile it from Windows directly. We actually use the win* targets only for cross compiling from linux. If you want to send in some PR, your change should affect the \"native\" target. That would be great!\n. What exactly do we have to do?\n. This is already supported with mode 4800:\n4800 | iSCSI CHAP authentication, MD5(CHAP)             | Network Protocols\nExamples:\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 4800 9920418b3103652d3b80ffff04da5863:00000000000000000000000000000000:02 -a 3 ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l --quiet\n9920418b3103652d3b80ffff04da5863:00000000000000000000000000000000:02:bradtest\nroot@ht:~/hashcat#\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat hash\n1ffc6c2659bc5bb94144fd01eb756e37:d7ec2fff2ada437f9dcd4e3b0df44d50:02\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 4800 hash -a 3 beaVIs --quiet\n1ffc6c2659bc5bb94144fd01eb756e37:d7ec2fff2ada437f9dcd4e3b0df44d50:02:beaVIs. > It say that \"Shader Model 1.0 - 1.3 Based GPU Detected\".. What version you recomend use?\nYou can not change the Shader Model, because it's a version tag of your Hardware. NVidia dropped support for those old cards, therefore it's not an issue with oclHashcat.\n. Please use hashcat forum for this kind of questions: https://hashcat.net/forum/\n. pocl works fine for me, both the version from ubuntu's repo as well as the self compiled one\n. Do I need a special version to reproduce, because if I can not reproduce this, I can not fix it. Since this is somehow related to CPU I think this is not related to the mesa thing discussed in the PR, right?\n. I'm having problems to build latest pocl github master on ubuntu 16.04. Too bad it doesn't have it's owne ubuntu package anyway.\n. I don't know, for example:\nA0`01`  orig: ^1 ^0\nA0`01`  orig: ^1^0\nThis would be invalid in hashcat.\n. What other types of rule removal does your script support? \nDid you check other rules files than dive.rule?\n. The logic behind the x and O rule changed recently, that may explains it\n. We just found something that is at least \"suspicious\". Can you please verify it's correct?\nHere's an example: You've removed the following both rules:\n^}\n^ }\nThe thing is that those are two complete different outcomes. The first is just one function calls and the second has two function calls. Funny :)\n. I'll revert the change on dive.rule regarding the sed issue. But I can't yet merge the new PR because it doesn't take into account that oclHashcat does not support all function hashcat (CPU) supports.\n. WOW this is getting compliated :) You've remove the PR, which is fine. Are you going to create a new one?\n. dive.rule was created automatically\n. OK, merged\n. What's the next step?\n. I'm a bit confused, do you plan to send in another PR?\n. While looking at some of the optimization, here's one type that I find a bit suspecious:\nsZEsEd  turned into sZd\nNow that looks fine at this point, but if you have a word in your wordlist which contains 'E' the results of the optimized rule is different to the original one.\nAnyway, I think this would be an edge case and I think I'll merge anyway. I'll think about\n. OK, please undo that specific undupe logic.\nDo you plan to  apply the fewest-function-calls-first optimization on all rules or just dive? If it's just dive, go for it. For other ones, especially the hand-written ones, it's maybe not ideal because the author maybe had a specific reason to sort it in the way it is.\n. I'll reject the PR as suggest. Please send in a new one when you have time\n. definitely  $6$6$6 and  $6$6$6$6\nall about easy to read :)\n. I full agree, such a script is not easy. Anyway, thanks for your effort. Please continue with it.\n. > There are many that simply have no op stuff in them, such as i0x$a[ ...\nI found the example interessting. Are you going to remove the useless work here?\n\n... and completed rule set so that you can look at it offline.\n\nHow would I check through 25% removed rules manually. I could do only a few random picks and I'd need to have something to compare, so I'd need at least 2 rules. However, you already said it's 100% correct above, I'll simply trust in that and going to merge.\n\nBut now, when this all gets done, there will be a little over 98k rules in dive. I think that's about 25% down from where it started. Still the same ruleset. \n\nGreat work, really\n. @jfoug What's the status with the issue? I think you've corrected all the \"generated\" rulesets, right?\n. I plan to release hashcat 3.00 somewhere within this month. Do you think it's the rules, as they are right now, are good to release or do you want to run some tests on them?\n. I think a solution based on the use of a reference wordlist can not be used to automatically remove duplicate rules, but it that doesn't mean it's not useful. Such a program can give good additional ideas how to find possible duplicate logic in a rule. It just requires a person to interpret the rule and to decide if this rule will work with all wordlist input or not. If yes, it can be added to @jfoug's tool.\n. @jfoug @0xbsec Are you planing to do any more changes to this or can we close this issue?\n. OK, I thought the same. Anyway, very good work on this and many thanks for your guys support!\n. That section looks like an incomplete refactorization of an older pre-OSS phase. There's two ways to fix it: Remove the branch or add the same branch to the unlock() a few lines below. Since I agree to OP here I'll remove it by commenting it and we'll see how it goes. If it turns out it was necessary we'll remove the comment and add another branch.\n. This looks almost good. Can you please try to put it into include/kernel_vendor.h instead? That's where the extensions usually are called from. If that's not possible, for whatever reason, please tell me and we'll merge it as it is\n. Thanks!\n. @neheb Can you please test if it's still working on LLVM\n. Cool! Thanks!\n. This seem not to be correct. For example, If you don't want to use amd_bfe(), why do you check for \"cl_clang_storage_class_specifiers\" and not simply \"amd_bfe\" ?\nThe or of cl_clang_storage_class_specifiers in combination with DEVICE_TYPE may work but is hard to understand. I think we have to find a cleaner way to handle this.\nCan you tell me how I can make use of LLVM like you do use it here? Maybe I can help finding a proper way.\n. Cool I really have to try that. How's the performance compared to fglrx?\n. I'm still not 100% happy. \nNote that rotate() is not part of cl_amd_media_ops, it's a basic OpenCL 1.0 standard: https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/rotate.html\nIt's weird that an OpenCL runtime does not include it, it totally should!\nAnother thing is:\n```\nifdef cl_amd_media_ops\nreturn amd_bfe (a, b, c);\n\n```\nIt should be:\n```\nifdef amd_bfe\nreturn amd_bfe (a, b, c);\n\n```\nThen there's:\n(DEVICE_TYPE == DEVICE_TYPE_CPU) || !defined (cl_amd_media_ops)\nFirst thing is that we try to avoid NOT cases, so we try to avoid '!'. Another thing is that we try to avoid && and || in branches. This makes exception handling easier. Please rewrite it to have two seperate branches for this (use 2x if()).\n. All right yes I think that's good, many thanks! I should totally try to get the same setup running as you have so that we can make it compile by default.\n. Wait, they have a 130 byte long salt on start? hihihi I guess they didn't read my post about how not to salt a hash :) https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-4429.html\nPlease give us an exact number for the salt length range\n. The null byte shouldn't be a problem. You can encode the salt in hex and use --hex-salt or we're creating a special parser for the mode. I'd recommend the 2nd in case the different salts are not concatinated into a single long string.\n. you need to create a new kernel to make and because of this you can't use the -m 140 address space for it. use the next free -m\n. i can help you with the kernel details once you pushed the parser and kernel template\n. OK I've added kernel functionality and other host changes so that it should crack now: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/aef8dc2b0181d865b8f684c9e3af4fd9dba81012\nWhat's still missing is the verify functionality in the test.pl. Please add it so that this kernel integration can be called \"finished\".\nHere's a screenshot seeing in action: http://pastebin.com/QzkVfCyh\n. It was just minor changes to your code, nothing to worry. The verify command is used to check an existing hash and a known password to be \"correct\". The important part here is that the verify command uses the salt (which usually changes per hash) is used as salt in the calculation of the hash. Otherwise you can't check for correctness. So if you want to know if your change worked correctly just create two files. 1 with just the hash, then another one with that hash with and the salt appended and then let run the verify command\n. If you send in a PR of what you've done so far i can finish it\n. OK, should be done now. Thanks for the PR. I also had to patch a small bug when running on AMD.\n. Wait, we can't really replace 'd' with 'M' because all memory store operations like 'M', '4' and '6' . They are not support in oclHashcat\n. Thanks, good work!\n. I'm pretty sure other user have the same problem then. We need to fix this before other users went into the same problem. My first try to fix would be to edit the tuning database. Please edit hashcat_tuning.hctab.\n- Find the line\n  Iris                                            *       1800    1       1       16\n(Note github throws out some spaces here, I hope it's clear what I mean)\nTry to set the '16' value to '1' and try if the problem still occurs\n. @gm4tr1x OP is not responding. Can you test please?\n. @gm4tr1x Do you think we can close this issue?\n. Problem fixed\n. You need to create a new hashmode and a new kernel for it. There's no way around. From my experience with new hashmode support you propably wont get much help unless the algorithm is used in a popular application or is important for some other reason. That's why you should always name the application where this algorithm is used in.\n. Buying such a kernel would cost you several thousand dollars because there's only a few people who can do that. But why buy it if you can get it for free. You just need to provide all the information behind your request and the system using it. This way everyone can use it afterwards.\n. OK so this isn't really about a new algorithm, it's generally more like you want to have a longer salt support. This is something people ask often, but not related to SHA512. It's not too hard to add but it's also not very high priority for me. Whoever wants to add this, feel free to do so.\n. Btw I've just added a new mode -m 13800 to crack Windows 8+ phone pins/password -- it's basically sha256 with a fixed 128 byte salt, so the same problem you have. You could hack it to do sha512 instead.\n. It's a good start, but we have to do some changes:\n- First I'd like to move the hashmode from 134 to 13500 (I'll reserver that for your hash-mode).\n- Then I've seen that you've used parse_and_store_salt() to store the salt. This is invalid in your case, as the salt is so long. Also note that the salt_buf in salt_t is limited to 64 byte, so you've propably already overwrote it.\n- To make this correctly, you first need to define a new esalt (external salt) and give it enough space to handle it. Like 512 byte. Note that you have to work with 32 bit integers so you need to create something like u32 buf[128].\n- After that you need to create the space for the salt, see other algorithms like 13400 in how to do that. \n- Next you need to store the salt into this esalt manually and without parse_and_store_salt. There's also plenty of examples in other parser functions. \n- Finally I'd suggest to copy at least 16 byte of that salt into the original salt_t salt_buf because based on that it will find if a hash is unique in some internal sorting routine\nAfter this is done we can start with the kernel code\n. That looks much better. Following things are missing:\n- Code in ascii_digest(). This function is responsible for generating the output string. It's very important to generate 1:1 the same output string as the input string is. \n- Add unit testing code in test.pl and test.sh.\n- You use memcpy for the salt buffer, but you'd actually have to decode the hex data first. something like this:\n  for (i = 0; i < salt_len / 2; i++)\n  {\n    out[i] = hex_to_u8 ((const u8 *) &salt_pos[i * 2]);\n  }\n- You marked the hash with the option OPTS_TYPE_ST_ADD80 but using OPTS_TYPE_ST_ADD80  makes sense only for schemes like sha1($pass.$salt) where the $salt comes after the $pass. I think what you want to use is OPTS_TYPE_PT_ADD80. But note this will work on -a3 kernel only automatically. For -a0 and -a1 you have to do it in the kernel.\n. If you want I can merge and finish the kernel\n. OK, waiting for your \"go\"\n. Please don't use * here\n```\ndefine DISPLAY_LEN_MIN_13500 40 + 1 + 16 * 2\ndefine DISPLAY_LEN_MAX_13500 40 + 1 + 512 * 2\n```\nSimply do:\n```\ndefine DISPLAY_LEN_MIN_13500 40 + 1 + 32\ndefine DISPLAY_LEN_MAX_13500 40 + 1 + 1024\n```\nSorting of this:\n13400,\n13500,\nShould be:\n133,\n13500,\nYou're still using an invalid option for the salt which you need to remove:\n| OPTS_TYPE_ST_ADDBITS15;\nThe following optimization is not possible since our data buffer is > length 55, you need to remove it:\n| OPTI_TYPE_PRECOMPUTE_MERKLE\nThis code:\nmemset(pstoken_tmp, 0, mysalt_len + 1);\nIs wrong in two ways. First you should use sizeof():\nmemset (pstoken_tmp, 0, sizeof (pstoken_tmp));\nAnother problem is that you're using a value which is unknown at compile time to declare a number of elements in an array.\nInstead of:\nu8 pstoken_tmp[mysalt_len + 1];\nYou should do:\nu8 pstoken_tmp[512 + 1];\nMore problems with snprintf():\nsnprintf((char *)(pstoken_tmp + i), (size_t)2, \"%02x\", pstoken->salt_buf[i]);\nProblem 1, the \"%02x\" does not match salt_buf[] which is 32 bit, not 8 bit. You propably need to something like this befoire you can use it:\n```\nu8 salt_buf_ptr = (u8 ) pstoken->salt_buf:\n... and then use salt_buf_ptr[i] in the snprintf()\n```\nProblem 2, the casting of pstoken_tmp from u8 * -> char * is not necessary. \nJust declare pstoken_tmp as char *.\nSuggestion:\nThe use of snprintf() is slow, take a look bin_to_hex_lower (). This is not always useful but sometimes it is.\nInside the parser you do:\n```\nu8 pstoken_tmp[DISPLAY_LEN_MAX_13500 - 40 - 1];\nmemset(pstoken_tmp, 0, DISPLAY_LEN_MAX_13500 - 40 - 1);\n```\nI'd recommend to use the same declaration as in ascii_digest instead:\n```\nu8 pstoken_tmp[512 + 1];\nmemset (pstoken_tmp, 0, sizeof (pstoken_tmp));\n```\nThis optimization does not work here, because we need a 2nd call to sha1_transform because of the length > 55. You need to remove it:\ndigest[0] -= SHA1M_A;\ndigest[1] -= SHA1M_B;\ndigest[2] -= SHA1M_C;\ndigest[3] -= SHA1M_D;\ndigest[4] -= SHA1M_E;\nThat was easy stuff so fow, but now in test.pl it's getting real problematic. From your original issue you said:\n\nWould love to see a new mode added for that. There is one for the application password, but if we could get a sha1($salt.utf16le($pass)) to break the SHA1 signature of the token, that would be great. The salt length is very long, 130-150bytes, so we can't really use any existing mode.\n\nWhat you totaly did not mention is the use of DES inside the algorithm. Now I'm very confused. Please explain in words how DES is involved in the process. It's important to write a proper kernel.\n. I'll now rewrite the kernel and inform you when I've pushed a working version\n. Another ~250 removed. Great work!\n. This is crazy. Can I merge? How many rules did you remove in total?\n. > However, before I proceed with this, we need to make a call on whether we should change all of the xNM commands to ONM I think so. \nI think changing the xNM to ONM is the right way as the dive.rule was created back when xNM what is today ONM. Go for it!\n\nYou might want to keep both flavors, in case there are people running older versions of HC, where the x still means omit.\n\nI'm not so much about supporting old rules. We don't need to care about that case.\n. Sounds like a lot of work. What's the default algorithm?\n. Not a bug, just use \"c\" instead of \"q\" when stopping a session\n. What hashcat deps are you talking about? There should be none left with latest version, see here: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/docs/BUILD.md\nAnyway about your issue, this sounds like some local installation error or broken hardware. Please try again with our precompiled betas to be sure it's not a compilation (and depency) error on your host. You can find them on hashcat.net/beta\n. There's no such file anymore since a long time. I think you're also using an outdated github version\n. Does example400.sh work?\n. >  just did a clean install of Ubuntu 16.04, the nvidia driver 361.42 and\nI'm using the same setup and it works pretty good. I'm however using the .bin from Nvidia site and not the driver that comes with Ubuntu. There's a small chance that this creates problems.\n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-opencl-dev\n\nI'm using the original one from Khronos but I don't think it will make any difference. But it's worth a try so purge nvidia-opencl-dev and add:\nocl-icd-dev\nocl-icd-opencl-dev\nopencl-headers\nocl-icd-libopencl1\n\nSame issue as well as with 500\n\nSo you're propably having problems with _a0 kernels. Does -a 3 work?\nAlso try this:\nrm -rf ~/.nv\nand in oclHashcat directory:\nrm -rf kernels\n. NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-361.18.run\nMaybe try -d 1 too\n. Thanks :)\n. See Issue discussion\n. I can see a print in there, guess it's some debugging print. Will remove it afterwards. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. > I am not 100% sure for oclHashcat on the usage of rejection logic. \nFor GPU, there's no rejection rules. That's mostly because of the traditional goal to crack fast hashes instead of slow ones. The rule engine was simply faster not to create branches for rejections rather than to check them.\nPlease continue to send PR for the other rules.\n. I see what you mean, but it's actually correct like it is. The 8900 is the kernel used by both, 8900 and 9300. It's a bit confusing, tho\n. That's something :)\n. We can place a fixed umask inside hashcat, what you think?\n. @bjornfor That was my thinking actually. It wouldn't be too bad to affect all files. Do you see any files in which case it would create problems?\n. I still think about using umask(). It maybe is a \"big hammer\" but it's a fitting one. I don't see a reason why not apply umask on all created files. Anyone has an idea?\n. I've set the umask now. Let's see if someone complains :)\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/f5ee678bbeec0b4565ca23f3998977f5d3edf447\n. Thanks!\n. GMP is not required for hashcat 3.00 anymore\nSo with both of the other devices it works just not with the nvidia gpu ?\n. Please try to find out which paths are searched. I don't know how to do that on OSX, on Linux I'd use strace\n. Yeah but I can't fix it without being able to reproduce\n. I think the Problem discussed here is the same one as in https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/issues/345\n\n... It's a bug in the OpenCL runtime of nvidia. We can't do anything on it. You can try reporting the problem to the vendor, but sadly from my experience they will ignore you if it's about GPGPU and not games.\n. Maybe some can please pull latest version from github and retry? I don't have much hopes that this one fixed it but it's worth a try.\n. This issue should be fixed, please make sure to use latest github version\n. Problem fixed\n. notice debug-mode is about rule debugging, not process debugging\n. So that means there's no problem? Self-Healing? Can we close this?\n. done https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/567fcfe176e17e7e9363742d15837d0092a6a8fe\n.

I just removed this stuff with a previous commit: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/commit/c6e5ff2a68b21572d54c2577e415e74768465313\nWhy bring it back? I thought it's important to have the data output as plain as possible so that there's no need to cut away the header....\n. The goal is to have the users download it from Github, not from the website. I just removed them because we're soon to release hashcat v3.00 (fusion of hashcat and oclHashcat)\n. The reason for removing the tags is because we're using this in our Makefile:\ngit describe --tags --dirty=+\nWhen I've added a new tag 3.00-beta it was there, but it still was using 2.01. We need a solution for that (maybe misuse?).\n. I think you don't understood what I mean. I have to remove old tags to make the process using git describe --tags for compilation. That's why it's propably a bad idea to use this kind of information for packaging.\n. OK. Do you have any idea how to restore the deleted tags?\n. I've restored the old tags as you described, that worked fine, thanks for that!\nI then tried to reproduce the problem I had -- but I can't anymore. I'm sure it was like that it always showed the oldest tag. In this case that is 3.00-beta because from git's view it's the oldest at this moment. When I'm right, then that means when we'll move to 3.00 release it should still show 3.00-beta.\nI'm not getting fully the other idea you had. What I'm basically looking for is that it uses the latest git tag plus the git describe hash (important for beta versions)\n. Thanks for help. I think we can close this as the original issue with the deleted tags is close. Continue on PR\n. I'd think it's much more easy to create a hash-mode md5(md5($password).md5($salt) ); because this forces the length to exact 64.\n. > ... but this algorithm is already supported by 3910 , am i correct ? It will not work in this case.\nIn Hashcat maybe, but not in oclHashcat. Why isn't it working? It's exactly what you've described\n. @magnumripper you sure about that? He said:\n\nthe salt is a md5 like value, created from the surname\n\nIf we make it generic, and the length is known to be 32 or more, then the mode must be implemented with a second transformation. In such a case, the length of the salt always must be at least of length 32 which is too strange for a generic mode. Therefore I think it's better to have a named hash-type and then we need to know which appliation uses this.\n. @xinhuang You should be able to load this hash already with latest version when using mode 2611. Should work fine using -m 2611. Should be fixed, thanks for report\n. Yeah but it's a bug in the OpenCL runtime of nvidia. We can't do anything on it. You can try reporting the problem to the vendor, but sadly from my experience they will ignore you if it's about GPGPU and not games.\n. @arnaudsj is the problem fixed with latest github version? please retry\n. OP not responding, closing issue\n. So when I'll add the new tag \"3.00\" when we'll release, for that particular version, then it will use that and just use \"v3.00\" and not \"v3.00-1-gxxxxxxx\"?\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. It creates an error (on my Ubuntu install):\n/bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: \"(\" unexpected\nWith the result: -DVERSION_TAG=\\\"\\\" \n. It's from the git checkout. Had to revert\n. Thanks for your contribution!\n. This is not like DES or RC4 ciphers of which a complete search through the entire keyspace would be possible. Therefore there's no sense in this request. People don't use Passwords in combination with AES directly, there's always a KDF in between. KDF's are supported with hashcat.\n. But its clearly a problem inside the OpenCL runtime, so not hashcats fault. Do you think it's correct to place it here?\n. If you rename --status-automat to --machine-readable you'd rename the variable (and macro) from status_automat to machine_readable, but not status_machine_readable. Please fix.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Not hashcat's fault, it's crashing somewhere inside the OpenCL runtime. Make sure you have AMD driver 15.12 (not higher) installed.\n. > A warning should be added and --force required.\nOK, but how exactly can we recognize that case? Is there any OpenCL device-specific parameter?\n. @CthulhUzzz since I can not reproduce this error, can you please try to find out which initializer is creating the problem?\n. @CthulhUzzz Since the error is unknown, I can't give you any specific instructions. You need to find out yourself by change code in ther kernel.\n. I've fixed this so that shows a warning:\nDevice #1: Hawaii, skipped\nDevice #2: WARNING: not native intel opencl runtime, expect massive speed loss\n           You can use --force to override this but do not post error reports if you do so\nDevice #2: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz, skipped\nand with --force you should be able to use it. \nHowever, it's recommended to use intels opencl sdk, which is almost twice as fast. Please close the ticket if ok for you\n. I can't reproduce, don't have that card. \n. Basically everything looks good for me. Also the benchmark speed matches exactly the real speed (you have to use one hash of course, not many). If you do not create enough amplifier you can't get out enough speed. Please read this and the following sections: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#how_to_create_more_work_for_full_speed\n. I didn't plan to add this feature, sorry. You can easily rebuild it yourself using hashcat-utils combinator.bin \n. Thanks!\n. I'm confused. What is this doing and why. Are you saying you tried to build on windows with mingw and it worked?\n. Thanks!\n. Dynamic hash modes with hashcat is currently not planed. While such a thing is not impossible to do, I think kernels are easy enough to make a new custom mode if it's required.\n. I'm wondering what kind of invalid build option it complains about. Does anyone know it?\n. OK, to pack this together: This compiler error only occurs in case of OSX 10.9.5 and only for the Iris Pro, is that correct?\n. OK, but since I can't fix this because I don't have that device with that OSX and since it's an error that occurs only for old OS I can't do anything to fix this. I'll close the issue, but for everyone stumbling on it, feel free to reopen and fix it.\n. Try again with a single word in the wordlist\n. Can you please retry with latest version?\n. OK, pushed a new version with a dynamic tmp_t salt length. That one should fix it.\n. Thanks for reporting and testing :)\n. Thanks!\n. I always wondered what DESTDIR is used for, saw it couple of time. Makes sense, thanks!\n. Can you give us an example hash:salt:plaintext pair please? Ideally please also add the algorithm which is used with some pseudo-code like: md5(sha1($pass).$salt) or whatever it is.\n. Excellent Information, thanks! I think I understand the algorithm so far. \nDid you generate the attached pcap files yourself? If possible, could you please send me two more pcaps but with the following password: \"hashcat7hashcat7\" and \"hashcat7hashcat7Z\". I think i found another flaw, yet unknown, just by looking at the specs. If I'm right it will work for Oracle12+ as well.\n. Thanks! It works!

The flaw is the following: Because the client has to encrypt the plaintext passsword the size of the AUTH_PASSWORD will change whenever the password exceeds the length 16 or more. That is because AES works on 16 byte blocks. That way, we as an attacker, can tell that the password must have the length 0-15 for the first packet and 16-31 for second packet. This is worthy information because of the password is actually 16 or more, we know we can't brute-force attack it and save the time and power.\n. Now I'm wondering, if we can force the password to be utf16, it would make sense to create a fake oracle server responder. If we can force the client to convert the password to utf16 before encrypting, we can tell if the password has the length 0-7, 8-15, etc. that would be even more nice...\n. @magnumripper Yes format is excellent. \nWhat I'm wondering is if it will work with Oracle 12. Because if you do the check correctly, that means by not trying to exploit the 0x08080808... padding, then I see no reason why it's not working with Oracle 12. And the trick I found will also work for Oracle 12. Problem is I don't have any Oracle 12 Database to try...\n. I still found no one with Oracle 12 answer my questions, which is kind of important because it decides which way to go with the implementation. There's two ways, the first one, by testing the 0x08080808 padding, but that one works only for a very small range of version of ORacle 11g so I don't see any good reason to implement it. The other reason to implement it \"correctly\", that is including the double MD5 calls. I've written a poc in perl and it works fine. By doing it that way I think we can make the it work with Oracle 12, too. But that's something no one yet were able to approve or verify.\n. @jackpit110 Do you have a chance to create a pcap of a connection to a oracle 12 database?\n. OK cool it works. Wondering if Oracle felt back into some backward compatibility mode when using an oracle11 client. Can you please try, with this client, to connect to the server by using the password \"3\", \"C\" or \"D\"? It seems the protocol causes some false positives\n. Forget the last request, was my fault in my poc. Anyway I can successfully decrypt it so I'll start implementing this one next. \n@magnumripper I'll use  your format suggestion: $o5logon$  *  *  * \nI'm planing to call the format \"Oracle 11+ CRAM (o5logon)\"\n. @magnumripper While implementing it turns out there's a bug in your format. Instead of\n$o5logon$<server's AUTH_SESSKEY>*<AUTH_VFR_DATA>*<AUTH_PASSWORD>*<client's AUTH_SESSKEY>\nit should be:\n$o5logon$*<server's AUTH_SESSKEY>*<AUTH_VFR_DATA>*<AUTH_PASSWORD>*<client's AUTH_SESSKEY>\nShould be easier to parse and you already do it like that, for example with zip2\n. @jackpit110 I've posted it here: http://pastebin.com/Qb4PEVk0\n. Guys I didn't follow in detail, is this just about how to extract the username? And is this a \"true\" ORacle 12 connection (Oracle 12 client and server)?\n. @jackpit110 which pcap are you using? The oracle12 pcap you send me worked well for me with my perl\n. You're using a way too old hashcat host program. I can see it from the build options, which looks very different in current version. Pull master, make clean, make uninstall then try again\n. Please try again with latest master and close the issue if fixed. Thanks for reporting!\n.

What's the reason to not pack it into a .so? I think that's what people expect from a true API and actually I should be pretty easy. \n. I'll reject this for now, but only because I want to have the repository clean when we fusion hashcat and oclHashcat into one. Otherwise this is getting more complicated than it needs to be. Don't worry, we'll add this after the release. This is great work.\n. The fusion is done and I've refactored hashcat basically into libhashcat. The goal is it to make it even easier to call hashcat from 3rd party applications.\nPlease check out the hashcat-as-library branch, especially this main_shared.c demo: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/hashcat-as-library/src/main_shared.c\nDo you think you can modify your python bindings to this? I think your bindings should be easy to refactor, or at least I hope so. After that, you should create your own repository for the bindings. Maybe add some example code how to use it from python, like main_shared.c is.\n. > Is there a way to get all the same status info as pressing \"s\" during a normal run?\nAbsolutely, yes. As a proof you can see in main.c that the main.c itself is spawning the thread handling the prompt. I can see how important that it. There's always two ways to access the data. Either by accessing the hashcat_ctx data or by using an event. But for a status check (like speed and so on) an event would be unpractical, so you want to access it via hashcat_ctx. For example, if the user presses \"s\", it's the main thread handling it. You can follow it through main_outerloop_starting() -> thread_keypress() -> keypress() -> status_display() and from there, there's the code how to access the details\n\nAre events intended to be used in this way? \n\nNot for status. Events are useful for example if a hash was cracked.\n\nSeems like you have a well defined plan here so just let me know if you need me to work on some part or just test by adapting python bindings?\n\nFor the events, it's possible to add more event. At this point I've just add those which I needed to have the new main.c create the same output as original hashcat before refactoring. But it's possible you want some additional events. If you find some during your binding work, tell me and I'll add them. Note that everything is very new and it's possible I change this. Before you start writing the bindings you should wait for the release version. Or, if you start right now, I can't guarantee nothing changes.\nAnyway I should close this as the original hashcat API is not what it will be in the future, plus I expect it to be in your own repository, which makes much more sense.\n. Not yet, but we should develop a better version. What I'm talking is something like simplified getter functions for the status informations. For example get_device_speed(device_id) or so.  I'll write them, but can you tell me which type of getters are of use?\n. Hey @Rich5 \nI think the version now is close to what you'd expect from an api. First, there's the following methods to control a running process:\nint hashcat_session_pause (hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx)\nint hashcat_session_resume (hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx)\nint hashcat_session_bypass (hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx)\nint hashcat_session_checkpoint (hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx)\nint hashcat_session_quit (hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx)\nTaken from here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/hashcat-as-library/include/hashcat.h#L12-L17\nBasically the stuff you can see on the status prompt when you run the commandline. It's pretty self explaining I hope.\nNext, I've added the following helper methods to read the status:\nint     status_get_device_info_cnt            (const hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx);\nint     status_get_device_info_active         (const hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx);\nbool    status_get_skipped_dev                (const hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx, const int device_id);\nchar

uses which is why it's in terminal.c) to use the same helper functions. The refactored status_display is here and can be used as an example code:  https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/hashcat-as-library/src/terminal.c#L612-L783\nI'll refactor status_benchmark() and status_display_machine_readable() next, but that shouldn't interfere with your implementation. Note this stuff is still not in a released state, but your comments on this will be important, especially since you're actually writing the bindings and you will notice problems soon (if there are any).\n. Note that I've made a little change. The new typical call scenario is now this:\n- hashcat_init \n- hashcat_session_init \n- hashcat_session_execute\n- hashcat_session_destroy\n- hashcat_destroy\nSo I've added that middle layer session. The reason is that in case you do not want to actually execute some attack but only check for like OpenCL devices available, the call to session_init() is enough. \n. Done\n. Thanks\n. I think the problem here is the space character here: \"Px - Secu\". There's a -I without a quote following.  Since the entire string is already a workaround for OSX compilers, it would required to make a workaround inside a workaround. Any other solutions? Maybe using an environment variable?\n. I've pushed a maybe-workaround. Please pull latest version from github and reinstall it and try again\n. Thanks!\n. Try adding a --session\n. No, why should it? it should return the number of lines which are compatible to hashcat. In other words, a number that is equal or less than the number of lines in english_and_1_to_4.txt\n. I think you didn't read the FAQ:\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#what_is_a_keyspace\n. hmm maybe you're confused by the naming. hashcat will be renamed to hashcat-legacy soon and oclHashcat becomes hashcat which supports cpu and gpu. At that point, the way how oclHashcat handles this will be active for hashcat, too. there's no way to change this and no one ever had problems with it.\n. OK it seems you were testing old hashcat (CPU) cracker and then posting the error on the GPU version. That's confusing. However I used it for a test with the upcoming hashcat v3.00:\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat plains.txt \nabcdef\n\\\nabc\n/\neeeeee\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat rule.rule \n/e\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat --stdout plains.txt -r rule.rule \nWARNING: Cannot convert rule for use on device in file rule.rule on line 1: /e\nabcdef\n\\\nabc\n/\neeeeee\nThe error is correct, because the function / is not supported with -r, only with -j and -k. However, it should not print anything here, because there's no valid rules left.\nAnyway, if you run it with -j, it shows a valid result:\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat --stdout plains.txt -j /e\nabcdef\neeeeee\n. Kind of, see here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack\n- the rules marked with \"+\"\n- the full section \"Rules used to reject plains\"\n. Thanks!\n. I did some changes to scrypt memory handling again, please retry\n. Lots of stuff changed since this last test. Can you please retry with latest version from github?\n. Please retry! The commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/da93d216dad39436ceeb01a4e7054abafb1c0d30 could have an impact here. I've investigated the problem with the CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY. It turns out this is a false error message created by the OpenCL runtime when calling clBuildProgram(). The error itself occurs inside the vendors OpenCL runtime while compiling the OpenCL kernel. You have to know that with scrypt the OpenCL kernel is rebuild with every start because it requires the scrypt configuration parts to be hardcoded to run efficient. So, depending on the configuration settings, the code changes each time. The higher you set them, the more memory it takes the JIT compiler to optimize the kernel and that's the error where it's running into. The only thing I don't understand is why it runs into that error with the 750Ti while it does not run into it with the 1080. That could be becuase of the different instruction set of the chips or different optimization settings for them in the compiler. But in both cases we can not know, because that's some hidden logic inside the vendors OpenCL runtime. That also means we can not do anything to not run into this error and that's why I think this is not a hashcat issue anymore.. This is cool, many thanks!\n. No reponse from OP, so closed\n. No reponse from OP, so closed\n. Looks like a failure in the libc, at least it crashes on there, so this is not directly a hashcat problem. However it could be interesting how it was triggered. Please compile from source like this:\n$ make clean; DEBUG=1 make\nThen run hashcat as you did before:\n$ ulimit -c 999999999\n$ ./hashcat ...\nThen use gdb to find what happend before the crash:\n$ gdb ./hashcat core\nsome gdb out follow...\nenter \"bt\" at the prompt, then paste full output\n. Excellent report. I'll add some code to handle that later. Thanks!\n. Great work! Thanks! @Fist0urs Please check this out\n. > hashcat does not use cuda\nThat's correct, but unfortionally the CUDA SDK includes with OpenCL headers. However, they are standartized, they should be compatible.\n@initbar Nice Video! Regaring the error, I think your OpenCL installation is broken. The error clearly indicates this. So this is not a hashcat problem. You should find the same error when running \"clinfo\". Check out this blog post: https://wiki.tiker.net/OpenCLHowTo maybe it helps installing OpenCL correctly. BTW: which linux is that?\n. Which driver are you using? I need to know so that I can reproduce locally\n. I think it's the \" chars in the build options. This should be supported by AMD OpenCL runtime, since it part of the OpenCL specification, but it doesn't. All other vendors do it correctly. Anyway, since I don't have access to a amdgpu-pro compatible GPU, I can not reproduce it. You can try it yourself. Remove the \" char from the build options at both sides from the %s and recompile. It should work afterwards. Please give me feedback here if it worked so that we can try to think about a workaround for amdgpu-pro.\n. Implemented a workaround. Should work now. You can try with latest beta from hashcat.net/beta\n. Please retry with latest github version\n. Can you please post the output of \"clinfo\"\n. You can try follow this wiki article:\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do\nSee if it helps\n. OK, cool. Thanks for the PR and the explanation\n. Two things to mention here:\n- I never expected this install system to be run on OSX. There could be problems\n- The macro APPLE is kind of official? Reason is we're currently using DARWIN on the most spots. What the correct/better form?\n. Excellent. I think we should switch to that. /cc @unix-ninja \n. Can you guys retry please with latest version from github. So much changed....\n. Any updates here?. OP not responding for months and too old version. Closing.. Thanks for the detailed information. They are very clear.\nAbout the scrypt part, I don't see any technical problems. The computation of scrypt is the reason why we want to run the attack in hashcat anyway. Before I'm going to implement this, I want to do a make sure it's worth the effort. I mean in comparison to the attack on CPU. Therefore we should compare the performance between CPU and GPU. If GPU shows a largely better performance, we should continue. I need your assistance because I don't know exactly how I could meassure the performance of your python script. \nCan you please tell me how many keys per second it can compute for the settings \"N=32768, r=8, p=2\"? I think the both scrypts calls will have the same runtime, simply because the scrypt settings are the same. I also think (in comparison to the both scrypts) the RSA part will be like no time. In other words, your pythons scripts performance * 2 can be used to compare with hashcat benchmark result with the same scrypt settings. It's not very precise, but precise enough to make a decision.\nI made a benchmark of N=32768, r=8, p=2 on a 1080. This GPU shows currently the best hash cracking performance. Here it is:\nSpeed.Dev.#1...:       40 H/s (12665.65ms)\nThe scrypt settings forced a TMTO setting of 4 and a limited thread count of 32. That is 20 compute units with 32 warps, so a pysical power of 640. Each of them require a memory block of 128 * 8 * 32768 and then divide by 4 because of the TMTO. We end up in 5,368,709,120 bytes memory required. We can't go any higher because it would exceed the GPU pysical memory of \"only\" 8GB. I don't see much room for optimization.\nOne short note about the RSA part. With latest hashcat I've added support for a hook. That means you can fetch the current key state (for example the scrypt final key) from the GPU to the CPU and do something with it and then copy the results back to the GPU and run another kernel with that data. So my Idea would be to use that for the RSA computation. I never did that before, but I guess some license-compatiable crypto library could help here.\n. OK, I had to do some changes to my scrypt kernel so that it runs better on CPU, and I'm happy to report it does. On my i7-4770, I'm getting ~65H/s on a single scrypt, so roughly ~21H/s. per CPU. What you think, is it worth it?\n. Does this problem still exist with latest version from github? Please retry\n. @mire3212  I've pushed some experimental code, can you please retry with latest github version? Do not forget to remove the kernels/ caching folder\n. @leonklingele Did you do:\ngit clean -f\ngit reset --hard\ngit pull\nmake clean\nmake\n?\n. Of course. Since I do not have access to such a computer, maybe you can give some updated information for @matrix to check. This is confusing. If @leonklingele uses \"latest master\", then he should have the latest hashcat.hctune already. @matrix gotcha, thanks. Happy tuning!. @matrix Do we need to patch hctune for Lotus Notes/Domino 6?. @matrix can we close this issue?. OK, we should create a new issue if we need it because this one is for SHA3 only. Thanks!\n. Can you post output of clinfo please\n. Should be fixed, please test and close the issue\n. Try again please\n. I pushed some fix\n. How could we have missed that, thanks!\n. Lots of stuff changed since this last test. Can you please retry with latest version from github?\n. Any update here?. OP not responding for months and too old version. Closing.. Thanks for fix!\n. Should be fixed, binary betas here: https://hashcat.net/beta/\n. Nice find\n. We've gotten this error type alot since hashcat  v3.00, but we're certain it's not a problem in hashcat. It's a problem with the users OpenCL installation. To make sure he installed it correctly, please follow the following wiki article: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do\nCan you please try out and give us some feedback?\n. Thanks for the feedback\n. This is great, thanks! Too bad travis doesn't support FreeBSD, so I can't check if it's working.\n. @ZbigniewB Your points are incorrect, sorry. If you follow the BUILD.md 1:1 it will work. Install the missing ICD loader library is not part of hashcat. It's basic OpenCL stuff.\n. Yeah I was going to say you maybe just need to adjust the path. Problem is I don't know if it's possible to not use a path and let MinGW find the object itself. \n. @philsmd Any news with the patch? All you need is to push it into an external file and include it from Makefile\n. I remember someone reported the same problem with a GeForce device on Apple. There's no known workaround or fix. Also note that this is not a hashcat problem, it's a driver or runtime problem.\n. As you can see, crashes somewhere inside gallium\n\n0x00007fffd0cea8c8 in ?? () from /usr/lib/gallium-pipe/pipe_radeonsi.so\n\nNot hashcats fault, sorry.\n. https://www.phillips321.co.uk/2016/07/09/hashcat-on-os-x-getting-it-going/\nPlease close issue if it helps\n. Double post: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/416\n. Should be fixed, thanks for report. Please reopen if it's not fixed.\n. It took me a while to make the Makefile as clean and easy to read as it is now, but with those changes it becomes hard to read again. Can we move that code section out to an external file and include it from within the Makefile?\n. Issue should be fixed. Don't forget to remove kernels folder before retry\n. There's also a new beta binary build on https://hashcat.net/beta/\n. weak-hash detection works only in attack-mode 0 and can't be easily ported to other attack-modes. please use the -a 0 mode first\n.

Re-added. You can use hashcat.net/beta if you want to play with it or wait for next release\n. So, can we close this?\n. No response here, closing\n. That's an integer overflow. A known issue since the total Keyspace (you can see it in the progress column in status view) is limited to 64 bit. however, it's nothing i'm going to fix soon because you can't search through such a range anyway, which is the reason why it is how it is.\n. If this requires a special kernel, we should name as such. Please open a new Ticket while following this: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this\n. This issue makes no sense. If you don't know the salt, you can't crack it, whatever hashcat supports salt length 40 or not. Please re-explain\n. Continue here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/565\n. Cool, thanks!\n. OK so far, but please add a description to docs/changes\n. You can't have (null) output otherwise this crashes on Windows. Please check for NULL and handle it correctly.\n. Thanks!\n. This is not about a new hash mode, it's mode like a new program. That's not how cracking is done. If the programm is closed source you have to reverse engineer the algorithm. You can't have a tool to do that automatically because there's an unlimited number of possibilities.\n. beta is up here: http://hashcat.net/beta/\n. Such a feature makes the program unnecesarily complicated. Note that this needs to be maintained over time, too. It makes even less sense since you can do that yourself. Just do cat whatevermask* > outfile.txt and then use outfile.txt.\n. That's nice. Can you please create dedicated hash-modes for them, too? Please use 1510 -> 14000 and 1530 -> 14100. \nNote that I think you can do bitsliced DES for -a 3 kernel, which will increase the speed by a very large factor. In theory, benchmark speed for your DES kernel should match the LM kernel.\nAlso please add test.pl and test.sh target\n. @fransla please respond\n. Hey Frans, no worries, I'll add bitsliced stuff afterwards.\n. @mattames that's already supported since a long time. see here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-3047.html\n. @halexan No, hashcat abstracts this for you. Please the read forum post again.\n. I didn't want to wait anymore and rewrote it myself, fixed some smaller bugs, added unit-tests and added bitsliced kernel which makes it around 10 times faster. Here's the full commit: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/71a8459d851d246945343ea59effa1d46b965bf8\nThanks for your help\n. Yes, a friends 6x1080 machine is doing 120GK/s. IOW: Cracks every DES key in 80 hours average\n. I think you just forgot to add --hex-charset\n. Excellent work, thanks!\n. There's no relation between the hashmode and the retain algorithm. It's more likely that your fans are unable to cool down the device fast enough, like the trigger starts at 75c and starts the fans but when the watchdog checks the temp its already 90c. \nIWO, This sounds like a cooling issue on user side. Please reopen the ticket if you're sure it's a bug\n. I could add this, but please answer the following questions first: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this\n. Thanks @matrix for adding . That's very good information. I can confirm the same behaviour in my system. I'll look into this\n. OK, some update here, it seems that this is actually a bug in NVIDIAs OpenCL JIT compiler (OpenCL runtime). While this always sounds like some kind of excuse, you can proof pretty easy by installing any different OpenCL runtime and run it with that. I used AMD's CPU OpenCL runtime for my fx8120 CPU.

There's a good chance that the compiler settings in CUDA are different to OpenCL. This explains why it's working with cudaHashcat.\nReporting bugs to NVidia never helps btw, they always ignore reports, at least if it's regarding OpenCL. So the final question is how to workaround the problem. Trying to find this out is my next step.\n. I've pushed that workaround. Can you please run your script and check for results?\n. I think the issue is workarounded, so I'm closing this to enable the release of hashcat v3.10. Please reopen if needed.\n. Yes, that check sounds useful\n. I agree with @philsmd \n. Nice find actually, thanks! I think it's safe that there's no opposite case for this, like having COMPARE_S_SIMD in the multihash kernel, because this would require to have the search[] array declared, so it would cause a compile error.\n. It's good, -o should be used incase --stdout is used, also saves the redirect\n. We should setup an issue for that otherwise it's forgotten\n. We should close that issue then. Thanks!\n. Very good, thanks!! I'll close the #425 Issue as well\n. Thanks!\n. Note sure if I get this right. So the idea is it to use the potfile as previous wordlist input before running the actual wordlist? What if the user doesn't do wordlist attack, but hybrid-attack?\n. So check the potfile words only in case --loopback is used?\n. @mubix Also, this would work only for rule-based attacks, not BF. @mubix OK, pushed this: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/1f756bf752f1fae16f50be57eb75d22c97639e6a\nPlease try. This feature went into hashcat v3.30, therefore closing the issue. If it's not working, please open up a new one.. There's a lot of potential in this, I like it. From a quick overview i found the following stuff very nice:\n- pragma once\n- config.h\n- have many small files\nBefore thinking about merging, I have to check this out in detail and you need to fix some stuff first:\n- Sync your branch with hashcat master, I got tons with conflicts. We're are hashcat v3.10 already, while you're at v3.00\n- Is it possible to make this without using cmake?\n- Does not compile on linux anymore:\nroot@ht:~/xy/hashcat/build# make\nScanning dependencies of target hashcat\n[  3%] Building C object CMakeFiles/hashcat.dir/src/status_display.c.o\nIn file included from /root/xy/hashcat/include/hc_device_param_t.h:5:0,\n                 from /root/xy/hashcat/include/shared.h:31,\n                 from /root/xy/hashcat/src/status_display.c:3:\n/root/xy/hashcat/include/ext_OpenCL.h:76:3: error: unknown type name \u2018OCL_LIB\u2019\n- What is a windows shim?\n- How can I cross-compile the windows binaries from Linux. Users expect that from us\n- What advantage is it to have those enum types over macro definitions?\n- Why did you add type naming after: typedef struct XXXX_t_ { ... } XXXX_t; ? Anonymous structs are fine aren't them?\n- The filenames have no real convention, for example: ext_OpenCL.h <- original, filenames_generators <- new type 1, hc_concurrency.h <- new type 2. So the question is, why having hc_* in front for some and for others not?\n. I've decide to reject this, even there's tons of good stuff in here.\nMajor reason is that, for me, it's too much changes at once to recognize all the implication.\nMinor reason is that it's not conflict free PR. A good PR's should be free of conflict.\nAnyway I want to use some of those changes. So what I'm asking here is to do the changes, but slowly. I'd suggest to create dedicated PR's where you only change one thing at a time. That would help me to understand the changes in detail and in depth.\nI know it's not always possible, especially when it comes to includes and depencies, but we could start with the easy changes first, for example moving the MACRO constants into the ENUM types. Since you made all the changes, you can evaluate the steps much better than I can. Ideally create a migration plan first.\nAbout cmake: If possible I'd like to not use cmake, because I'm not used to it. If there's really no way around it, then we do it. But in that case we should do it at the end of the migration process.\nAbout .gitmodules: The idea seems nice, however there also some problem with it. If there's any code included automatically from a different repository, than this repository could be used to inject code without any changes to hashcat. There created some concern from the more security aware developers and I can see their point. We should avoid this.\n. I'm not going to change the default, because there's too many workflows depending on that output-file format, as @redongh already mentioned. Therefore I'm going to close this issue. \nHowever, here's another approach that you might find useful, by adding --show into the mix:\nYour command, as however you do it or did it:\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat example0.hash example.dict\nNow create the wordlist:\n```\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat --show example0.hash -o outfile --outfile-format 2\nhashcat (v3.10-3-g13cbe42) starting...\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat outfile  \n13LEXON\n```\n. I don't like the idea mostly because I don't want to write a configfile parser. Is there any good libraries for pure C?\n. I was discussing with @philsmd about this. Here's some important argument collected:\n- The use for such a configfile could be worked around in linux using bashrc/alias, but that would reduce it to linux and maybe OSX. Windows users couldn't do it.\n- We often have reports like \"hashcat did not crack hash XY\", but in almost all cases it turns out the problem is the user, not hashcat. In case we have a user who changed for example --markov-threshold to 2 in the config and then wondering why hashcat isn't cracking the hash of which he knows the password, we couldn't see it from him posting only his commandline. We would need to have some \"display\" of the changes values in the config file on startup but that would only solve the problem if the user posts it. Most poeple will post only the commandline. It would be also ugly, from a design perspective.\n- The .restore system could be broken if the user changes the configfile. A theoretical solution to this would be to store some checksum of the config settings with the .restore file and check it in a restore case and complain if it doesn't match. but it's very likely the user can not restore the config file to exact the same one as it was before. We could also store all the settings but that would create some larger change to the restore system at all\n. This should be fixed, but note that to fix this, I had to move the source tarball to hashcat.net because GitHub didn't let me choose the download filename manually.\n. I can't reproduce this with on linux, because the linux driver is far behind the windows drivers. Without being able to reproduce it, I can't fix it. We need to wait till the AMD driver for linux is at that point\n. OK, I've added a workaround for this. You can try with latest beta from hashcat.net/beta\n. All right, will do :)\n. Done\n. Thanks for the fixes. Please do not forget to add your fixes to the docs/changes.txt\n. Great! Thanks!\n. Just noticed that you didn't add your changes to docs/changes\n. GitHub is for bugreports and feature requests or anything development related. Please use the hashcat forum for user questions.\n. GitHub is for bugreports and feature requests or anything development related. Please use the hashcat forum for user questions.\n. If you use --opencl-platforms 1, so that it uses your NVIDIA device, and it cracks, then it's propably as @Fist0urs said, an OpenCL runtime problem. Not a hashcat problem.\n. @MichalStaruch You said so, but you posted a quote where you used --opencl-platforms 2. This makes it pretty hard to understand because it's confusing. Please post the output of --opencl-platforms 1 as well.\n.

Please close the issue if you think it's fixed.\n. OK, but now we're back on the following situation that @Fist0urs explained here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/479#issuecomment-243162405\nThis is a known error inside Intel's GPU OpenCL runtime, not a hashcat error. We can't do anything on it, that's why I'm closing this issue now.\nNote that we also do intensive unit tests, including for keepass and no error have been reported with it.\n. Of course I am sure, otherwise I wouldn't close the issue. However, because the experience I made in the past, vendors don't care about bugs in OpenCL runtime, because it affects too less users. Whenever I report a full bug report, including poc etc, the vendors never reponse to this. Maybe it's because it's \"hashcat\", I don't know. However, I'm tired of reporting bugs to them, so there's no one. Feel free to open one yourself.\n. Support for LUKS has been added.

I'm trying to process the single commits historically the same order you did and comment each commit how I handled them.\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/485/commits/d288608b85b4ded6010128c7ed40e9532a3ccc02\nThis commit is unacceptable for multiple reason:\nI just hope it's really only about formating to that I'm able to merge other changes i like\n- OpenCL/inc_hash_constants.h was changed in the meantime from myself into enum types\n- Removed comments, no need to reformat\n- \"int log_out_nn (...)\" is the correct format, \"int log_out_nn(...)\" is wrong, no need to change those\n- Code like this is easier to read if it's correctly aligned, no need to change those:\ntemp = (te2[(temp >> 16) & 0xff] & 0xff000000)\n          ^ (te3[(temp >>  8) & 0xff] & 0x00ff0000)\ntemp = (te2[(temp >> 16) & 0xff] & 0xff000000)\n      ^ (te3[(temp >>  8) & 0xff] & 0x00ff0000)\n- Same here, code like this is easier to read if it's correctly aligned, no need to change those:\ntd0[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >> 24) & 0xff] & 0xff] ^\n       td1[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >> 16) & 0xff] & 0xff] ^\n       td2[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >>  8) & 0xff] & 0xff] ^\n       td3[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >>  0) & 0xff] & 0xff];\ntd0[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >> 24) & 0xff] & 0xff] ^\n       td1[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >> 16) & 0xff] & 0xff] ^\n       td2[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >> 8) & 0xff] & 0xff] ^\n       td3[te1[(rdk[j + 1] >> 0) & 0xff] & 0xff];\n- This change looks like a bug in your automated replacement:\n-  char *block_ptr = (char *) block;\n-  char *plain_ptr = (char *) plain;\n+  char *block_ptr = (char *)block;\n+  char *plain_ptr = (char *)plain;\n- Not sure why people think #ifdef should not be aligned, it just makes it hard to read, will not change:\n-  #if defined (_WIN32) || defined (_WIN64)\n+#if defined (_WIN32) || defined (_WIN64)\n- Those are copies from ADK SDK, we better don't do changes if we want to maintain them over time:\n-  ADLODPerformanceLevel aLevels [2];\n+  ADLODPerformanceLevel aLevels[2];\n- Same goes for NVAPI and NVML\n- This just looks ugly:\n-static inline void CPU_ZERO  (cpu_set_t *cs)          { cs->count = 0; }\n-static inline void CPU_SET   (int num, cpu_set_t *cs) { cs->count |= (1 << num); }\n-static inline int  CPU_ISSET (int num, cpu_set_t *cs) { return (cs->count & (1 << num)); }\n+static inline void CPU_ZERO(cpu_set_t *cs) { cs->count = 0; }\n+static inline void CPU_SET(int num, cpu_set_t *cs) { cs->count |= (1 << num); }\n+static inline int  CPU_ISSET(int num, cpu_set_t *cs) { return (cs->count & (1 << num)); }\n. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/485/commits/d26eef45ab95b414ff3bff19199f871ba4ea666c\nThis commit simply creates a folder \"hwmon\" and moves the code from the main src folder into that (same for include).\nIt's not like that would create any better view on the folder, because in the main src folder is 10 files anyway:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18024 Sep  5 10:10 ext_ADL.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5626 Sep  5 10:10 ext_nvapi.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  13041 Sep  5 10:10 ext_nvml.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  13650 Sep  4 20:11 ext_OpenCL.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4777 Sep  5 10:10 ext_xnvctrl.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 695854 Sep  4 21:53 hashcat.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11151 Sep  4 20:11 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  96535 Sep  4 20:11 rp_kernel_on_cpu.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 602378 Sep  4 21:53 shared.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2015 Sep  4 20:11 win_file_globbing.mk\nIt's not like this creates alot of confusion. OTOH, it creates lots of problems with the Makefile. We'd need to rewrite it in a way so that it is able to handle the new folder structure. \nI don't see the benefit yet. Maybe this changes when I continue going through the other commits.\n. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/485/commits/58b728230b666cabf7f5dee445dc3ece34e1068e\nI merged this, or better I took the idea and applied it to the oder cpu-*.c files as well. While doing this I find there's a lot of duplicated macros if you compare it with  OpenCL/inc_hash_functions.cl and  OpenCL/inc_hash_constants.cl we maybe want to change that at a later time.\n. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/485/commits/75a3ab9d47bd7d929e08f1f93de4399909743ef7\nI merged this, or better I took the idea and applied it to constants that apply to this. I'm sure there will be more files that can be improved like this, whenever I see them I will fix them accordingly.\n. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/485/commits/4323b4a70ad879b1a441449ff96143701647b087\nI merged this, or better I took the idea and applied it to constants that apply to this.

There's two reasons:\n- It's only faster in large quantities. But when we use those cpu algorithms, it's mostly just one call\n- The OpenCL devices are not initialized at this point and it makes no sense to move them\n. Just in case you're wonding. Currently doing pretty intensive refactoring so that it's easier to merge your changes. Takes some time\n. You can see it from the commits I do, there's a lot of work being done already. But I'm not finished yet. I think it will take a few more weeks to get to a point to merge this stuff. Note that alot of your changes are a result of the same refactoring I'm doing, like moving the code into seperate files. When I'm done with that, I'll go through your PR and compare it with my changes to find out what I'm missing.\n. Refactoring almost done; Integrated hand selected changes; Continue discussion on separate issue https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/520\n. Refactoring almost done; Integrated hand selected changes; Continue discussion on separate issue https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/520\n. All fine here, the salt is embedded into the mask as part of an optimization process.\n. This helped alot, thanks m8!\n. Of course not, that wouldn't make sense at all then. It depends on serveral factors, but the most important it the number of amplifier (for example rules). Note that a good attack uses large wordlists and a small number of rules, not the opposite. You can also use --stdout feature to pregenerate a large base and pipe it back into hashcat. Anyway, GitHub issues are for feature request and bug reports. For general hashcat use please use the hashcat forum.\n. - That makes no sense for masks, since hashcat uses position-dependant markov-chains anyway. IOW, it's not starting with AAA and ending with ZZZ. It could be G5! and next would be _T4, depending on the training data.\n- That makes no sense for wordlists, as they are not processed linearly. On GPU, they are run in parallel. The Host can not know which one is processed at time the user requests an status update.\n\nPlease close the issue.\n. Implemented, you can use github version for test or one of the precompiled beta on hashcat.net/beta with starting version > +607 or next release :)\n. Merged\n. Thanks!\n. The version string gets updated with release. Find the beta on https://hashcat.net/beta/ which are named 3.10+X\n. I've pushed something, please check if it's fixed now and close the issue if fixed\n. Lots of stuff changed since this last test. Can you please retry with latest version from github?\n. @fsociety79 any update?. OP not responding for months and too old version. Closing.. Works fine for me\n```\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 2500 x.hccap -a 3 123456789012345678901234567890123\nhashcat (v3.10-118-gbc75ba7) starting...\nOpenCL Platform #1: NVIDIA Corporation\n\nDevice #1: GeForce GTX 750 Ti, 499/1998 MB allocatable, 5MCU\n\nOpenCL Platform #2: The pocl project\n\nDevice #2: pthread-AMD FX(tm)-8120 Eight-Core Processor, skipped\n\nHashes: 1 hashes; 1 unique digests, 1 unique salts\nBitmaps: 16 bits, 65536 entries, 0x0000ffff mask, 262144 bytes, 5/13 rotates\nApplicable Optimizers:\n Zero-Byte\n Single-Hash\n Single-Salt\n Brute-Force\n* Slow-Hash-SIMD\nWatchdog: Temperature abort trigger set to 90c\nWatchdog: Temperature retain trigger set to 75c\nATTENTION!                                              \n  The wordlist or mask you are using is too small.\n  Therefore, hashcat is unable to utilize the full parallelization power of your device(s).\n  The cracking speed will drop.\n  Workaround: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#how_to_create_more_work_for_full_speed\nINFO: approaching final keyspace, workload adjusted       \n6454331:1c18d4ca52a7:62b9bdade67b:123456789012345678901234567890123\nSession.Name...: hashcat\nStatus.........: Cracked\nInput.Mode.....: Mask (123456789012345678901234567890123) [33]\nHash.Target....: 6454331 (1c:18:d4:ca:52:a7 <-> 62:b9:bd:ad:e6:7b)\nHash.Type......: WPA/WPA2\nTime.Started...: 0 secs\nSpeed.Dev.#1...:        0 H/s (0.43ms)\nRecovered......: 1/1 (100.00%) Digests, 1/1 (100.00%) Salts\nProgress.......: 1/1 (100.00%)\nRejected.......: 0/1 (0.00%)\nStarted: Wed Sep 14 17:06:42 2016\nStopped: Wed Sep 14 17:06:45 2016 \n```\nAlso works with -D 2 (CPU).\nI guess your hccap was somehow generated wrongly.\n.

Technically it's not much of a problem, because I could mark the number of duplicates per hash in the hashes_t structure. But what I think is confusing is that when hashcat cracks such a hash, what should it do. Should it print the hash N times? That could confuse new users here alot, because they wouldn't expect it. Also, hashcat is a cracking tool, not a statistics generator. As @roycewilliams already said, it should be trivial to do what you want to do from an external script.\n. This is a huge chaos with the -I parameter, because each runtime handles it differently. And by each runtime I mean even different versions. For example the AMD OpenCL runtime < 15.12 understood what a quote it, but the new one based on amd-gpu-pro does not longer. That's why the best workaround I found so far is to chdir() to the folder where the .cl sources are and that's what's hashat is doing atm. That's why I don't understand @andrewvaughan issue here unless he's using an older vresion. \n@andrewvaughan Please try with latest version from github and close the issue if fixed.\n. what do you think what i'm doing since thee weeks, lol\nOn 24.09.2016 12:16, Gabriele Gristina wrote:\n\nI thought the same thing yesterday, but this is not a migration, it\nshould be re-engineered.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/511#issuecomment-249357325,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJ83Of5M3DQwpuKdJdxxV-f53vqyue2nks5qtPh4gaJpZM4KFfEK.\n. Actually, I can see how C++ can be useful in some cases, but I don't see it for hashcat atm. @KOLANICH can you name some of the advantages?\n\nWhat I can see when it comes to OOP approach is that the code usually results in a more ordered structure, but we can do that for C, too. That's what I meant with \"what i'm doing since thee weeks\". If you take a look at the commits from the last weeks you will see it.\n. @KOLANICH I understand the use for C++ in some projects, but why is it good for hashcat? What I meant is, can you make an example, but inside hashcat, where C++ would help us alot?\n. I still find no good reason why to switch to C++ yet.. Closing this issue because I see no real advantage in porting to any other language. Maybe because OpenCL is so close to C it feels just natural to stick with C in the host program, too. . Please close if fixed\n. When is it really long enough? 50 or 500 or 500000? @magnumripper what's the maximum in JtR?\n. Continue here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/565\n. Yes, tabs are supported. You just need to deal with your shell to not re-interpret it somehow, but that's not part of hashcat.\n. As @roycewilliams said, I'm not much less inclined to take it on as an internal feature if it's something that can easily be scripted externally. Therefore closing this issue.\n. DES mode is not broken, please provide some example key:value pairs so that we can reproduce here.

And I don't see much complication in it. Anyway, my cmake script did the globbing.\n\nI see, but we don't have cmake (yet) and with normale make it's harder to do.\nHowever, if you send a PR with only very basic cmake that works without any changes to the current structure and if I get a good understanding about how it works I may change to cmake.\nQuestion: Is cmake required to build on VS?\n\n\nNot sure why we should move this into a separate file.\n\nWhy not? Large files slow down IDEs.\n\nPlease add the related commit otherwise it's hard to understand the context.\nAt this time we only have one large file left (interface.c) which include the parsing and rebuilding of hashes of all the different modes in seperate functions. Splitting them into single files would make sense only if we have a plugin system that standartizes all loading and saving. If you're IDE can't handle large files it's not a problem of the project, it's a problem of the IDE. I don't use any IDE btw.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/7fb6fce99473fabf93885c0baccbd2040536fe2b\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/6deede5037c84aee7192f65f936e9a392c614584\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/2f4dfdc6454f62dbf20e2d1ec26ff2574921e1c5\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/12e93659ed9d54fd9b1fef32d3c3af2b86bbcd5b\nDon't see a reason to do that.\nMakes it harder to read. Are there any technical advantages?\n\nSince C has no references we have to use pointers to replace macros with inlines. The addresses of operands are not params for macros\n\nThat's why wo do macros. They can be very useful because they make code easy to read.\n\nType safety and \"source-code safety\" (I mean that if you see the code you can expect that it is actual code, and if you see it valid, it's valid, and if you encounter a compilation error you can investigate the cause without dumping preprocessed output, and if you debug, you see the code corresponding to binary not tampered with macros) are always an advantage. Macros must be eliminated everywhere it is possible because they make the project unmanageable.\n\nI can see your point here and I can agree. OTOH in crypto universe macros are very common. People know how to deal with them. \nFor those, we should stick to macros.\n\nAnother problem is that I see that some defines in your code I've turned into consts/enums/inlines.\n\nYes, I liked that. I think I merged all of your changes related to them.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/239dd7ef9529a584ae9a32301405716845c13d05\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/4db249206c33d3667ac21ead57e88973f0cdb8f5\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/4b4f7ac7dca1edbb721a6180ccc82755483e4f5c\nNot merged.\nI don't see any disadvantages.\n\ntheoretically using include guards instead of pragmas slowes the compilation: the preprocessor have to load a file and process it instead of checking its internal associative container to determine if the file was already used. We have to solve problem with pragmas on Mac.\n\nWe don't need to discuss here, I also like the pragma approach. But it's not a decission. We simply can't use it because if it doesn't work with OSX it's a no-go.\n\n\nThis section has been taken of from original ADL headers from AMD. I don't think we should change anything to them directly. Can we do this indirectly?\nThis section has been taken of from original NVML headers from Nvidia. I don't think we should change anything to them directly.\n\nWe should decide how do we use the headers: as black boxes or as white ones. If we use them as black boxes we don't touch them at all and even don't have them in repo by itself, using submodules and make system (first check predefined paths, if not present - using submodules). If we use them as white boxes we are free to modify them.\n\nUnfortionally there's no github repository for most of those. Some of the features, especially in NvAPI, isn't even documented. Till today it wasn't required to do any changes to those headers because the vendor didn't change them.\nThat means, technically I'd like to handle them as \"black box\". But adding those SDK's would create a lot of depencies for the compilation. We had this approach in v2.xx series, but too many people failed to build the project just because of them. It's hindering the package maintainer on linux to create hashcat binaries and that's bad for it's evolution. That's why we this middle way and that's why we should stick to it.\n\nAnother issue is manual libraries loading. We should consider not to load libraries manually but to rely on compiler/linker delay load feature. GCC and VS have it.\n\nI disagree. I always found it very problematic, especially on linux. Since there's no real standartized path where the shared libraries reside it often happens that they can't be found. Even worse, it can occur that they exist twice or more in different paths. Especially with OpenCL.so this creates a lot of problems. Therefore it's very nice for the binary to be able to predefine the path to search in the runtime.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/31f45acc8f88aefd58bddcd8575e9ebf8e29a2f7 \nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/ebea5c5102af95c8899e732d7b60d15e7849b26b\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/796bb055adade57a06e325833e270ac08de76588\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/693649fadb5ee6898a71d3b9d55e349e80385a16\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/b6d20be1229765aeb0e88ea0f8f72ac97c37395c\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/210ddd04b50a06d3573fc7d8101e11678f549009\nNot merged (yet).\nWill do this (typing) when refactoring is completely finished\n\nOK. Some commits' messages contain regexes or scripts used to do them.\n\nWhat I meant is the use of the enum datatypes instead of \"int\".

Note that ascii_digest was moved to interface.c. We maybe should refactor it, so that we have the opposite of parse_* function for each hash-mode. That would also help to split interface.c into many files. But moving ascii_digest() as-is into a single file is not a good solution.\n\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/91767b8fa9ec3834643b2ab3e532df1c04c7d45f\n\nI merged that\n\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/0531df75e7c550df51d63b50465534957b19128b\n\nWe discussed that above, I don't think crypto related macros should be replaced with functions.\n\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/11f58ee7959b84ecbcbfed0c7d1a28ee3390eae4\n\nI merged that\n\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/3a816a348e4dd29daaa4027560171dc56f6ef2c1\n\nI don't see what I missed here.\nWhat I think of how we should continue:\n- I'd suggest you to clone hashcat repo as it is and to redo your work. That makes it easier for both of us to handle the required changes.\n- If you want, you can send in a PR with the changes from \"int\" to enum datatype\n- If you want, you can send in a PR with the type castings that I missed\n- I'm not a big fan of cmake. Please try to avoid it.\n- I like the idea that VS is able to compile the binaries, but not at all cost. If you can send in a single PR to handle this case, please do it. I'll decide if the changes to the code is too large.\n- We should stick to how we handle hwmon stuff like it is. That is not link it at compile-time, not change the headers as they come in from the SDK and compile all submodules for all OS and let the runtime decide how to handle this stuff.\n- For the large file interface.c I'm open to refactor. If you want, split them into single files and move them to a special folder.\n. > In any case I'm not going to fix anything untill someone solved the problems with the files violating c++ standard which make succesful build using VS impossible.\nI don't know about such a problem. Is it the ones with the datatypes? Can you make one example so that I can try to fix it?\n. @KOLANICH is there anything you'd like to change left?\n. OK, thanks!\n. Propably not enough host memory for mingw, so the process gets killed by the OS. Anyway, not a hashcat issue, so closed.\n. Propably power consumption issue. The RX480 is not pci compliant. It's known to suck more power from the board than allowed. Anyway, not a hashcat issue, so closed.\n. Your CPU needs an OpenCL runtime\n. Is that fnv1a32() the entire algorithm?\n. > Tried to do a mask attack(new to this) with ?l?l?l?l?lbut instead of a range of aaaaa -> zzzzz I got sange -> uqoql.. Can my .cl file affect that?\nThe .cl can not affect that, no worries. It's like @magnumripper said, it's the markov-chain optimization. You can disable it with --markov-disable if you want to make sure. You can also use --stdout to watch the full output, just to make sure all candidates were generated as expected.\n\nWhat is il?\n\nThe 'il' stands for inner loop and is the only way to make full use of the GPU power for fast hashes. Inside that loop, the first 1-4 byte of the password were replaced/iterated. \n\nIs cnt count?\n\nYes.  it's a value calculated by the autotune engine, but has an upper limit of 1024. That means it's not large enough to hold al possible combinations of 2^32 which w0 can hold, that's why the process is restarted again and again with an increased offset, but this one is set outside the algorighm kernel, it's used in the password candidate kernels.\n\nDoes the r/l in w0r/w0l mean right/left?\n\nYes it does. hashcat calculates how many letters (between 1 and 4).\n\nWhat is the difference between u32x to u32?\n\nu32x is the vector datatype variant of u32 to make use of VLIW/SSE*\n. You can use the device global memory to store such information but you have to allocate the memory range to hold that from outside the kernel. This is pretty limited to a max of 2GB on high end systems because of the 1/4 memory OpenCL specification limitation. Anyway as easy as it sounds, as complex it is in real world. The best way to deal with it would be to generate the innerloop part for the end of the password, not the beginning. In such a scenario you could simply precompute the prefix before entering the inner loop and get full speed, regardless of the length. Such a change isn't easy, because it's not compatible with hashcat's structure. You could also workaround this with a salt which you can preprocess, but in that case you'd need to know the salt before running hashcat which could be a bit uncomfortable. Anyway, the algorithm itself seems pretty bad. Maybe you get better results by exploiting the algorithm itself. You wouldn't be able to BF a string of length 30 anyway, so you'r best change is to build the \"password\" by appending known substrings like payday2.\n. If \"ene_\" is fixed, the il_cnt will become 1 and make the kernel inefficient. You need to workaround this. See the other issue on how to do that.\n. Note that v2 doesn't use OpenCL for CPU, but v3 does. Now it seems the OpenCL runtime for the NVC4 has some internal problems, hence the CL_BUILD_PROGRAM_FAILURE. Sorry, but not a hashcat issue\n. OK, what's wrong with simple Make?\n. 1) About crossplatform: Currently hashcat compiles natively on linux, freebsd, windows (using msys2) and osx. What's missing?\n2) About many toolchains: I personally prefer to have dedicated code for buildng and linking command line by hand for every compiler and platform than to have \"project files\". Such files always create a feeling of \"I have no clue what's going inside there\" and this gives me a bad feeling. Does CMAKE create such files?. I see no reason to keep this issue open. There's no real benefit using cmake. I was under the impression cmake is required to build hashcat from VS, but it seems that's not the case. @KOLANICH  If I'm wrong, please reopen. Looks like your OpenCL install is broken. Please continue on hashcat forum, github issues is for bugs and feature requests.\n. That's because with 7-zip there's a high chance of false positives. We can't be sure the password is really correct. That's why we have to mark it as NEVER_CRACK, which then leads to the fact that it can not increase the recovered status. Anyway, sharp eye you have, but it will not change here.\n. Please explain, what is that BEX error and which effects does it have?\n. Sounds like some mingw issue and not sure which compiler and linker flags you mean. Also, how did you notice this? hashcat runs normally on my Windows 7.\n. OK I've added it and created some new beta binaries. Can you test please and close the issue if fixed?\n. Binary beta can be found here: https://hashcat.net/beta/\nBut I make the change in the current master branch, too: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/Makefile#L176\nYou can also try to compile from source on windows (Msys2 works fine).\n. @KOLANICH did it work?\n. Can we close this issue?. I've added that flags only for you. I guess I can close the ticket now.. There was a problem for large dictionaries related to u32 as word counter. I've changed this to u64. I think this was the real problem.\n. Why use MESA driver if you have a NVidia device. Please install correct OpenCL runtime.\n. Thanks!\n. There's no discussion needed about this behavior. It's a well known limitation and there's also a standard workaround. Therefore I'm closing this issue.\nHere's an explanation: Without a fixed w[0] the innerloop has nothing to iterate through, the il_cnt variable will be 1 and the kernel will finish too fast to run efficient. After that, hashcat will run the candidates generator to produce the next set of parallelized candidates. This kernel takes some serious time as it has to read and write to global memory.  This is not a problem usually because compared to the hashing kernel it's almost no time. The typical kernel with -w 3 will run at 100ms while the candidate generator kernel will run a 0.1ms, so the GPU utilization for actual cracking is very high. But if you set il_cnt to 1, the kernel will take 0.1ms as well and the GPU utilization for actual cracking drops massive. Note the numbers are not very accurate but help explaining this.\nThe best workaround is to have a prefix added to the hash as a salt. This way you can also make use of a precomputed intermediate hash for this static data before you enter the inner loop. You can see -m 20 on how to do that.\n. I need a way to reproduce, please provide the files required\n. Also, try with latest beta: hashcat.net/beta\n. I don't think so, because the MD5 kernel isn't involved in the potfile handling. Please pack the data I need to reproduce this, upload it somewhere (maybe password protect it before) and send me the link in an email to atom@hashcat.net\n. Please retry with latest beta version from https://hashcat.net/beta/ and close the issue if fixed\n. Where did you see that this algorithm is supported? It's not.\n. Done integrating back. Please try with latest beta: hashcat.net/beta and report back\n. I tested on Windows 7 64 bit and restore works fine. Can you do a screenshot of what's wrong?\n. OP did not respond and the issue can not be reproduced, so closed. Feel free to reopen and to provide more information I need to reproduce.\n. This looks like an OpenCL runtime installation problem. Please install latest driver and also try with a different OpenCL tool. If it still does not work, please use hashcat forum for report. GitHub is for bug reports and feature requests.\n. Useless site-specific algo. Makes no sense to add. Are you using a beta version?\n. Please retry with latest beta version from https://hashcat.net/beta/ and close the issue if fixed\n. Please retry with latest beta version from https://hashcat.net/beta/ and close the issue if fixed\n. With DES there can be many valid keys, because the keyspace is 56 bit not 64 bit.

I can reproduce, thanks. Trying to fix...\n. Nice, thanks!\n. Invalid use of hashcat, please ask on forum for correct syntax\n. That solution slows down cracking massive, because allocating an setting memory to zero would be done for each cracked hashes. If you have a large unsalted hashlist, cracking speed will drop 1000th of times.\nA better way to handle this would be to preallocate that buffer somewhere and move it with the context. Can you please change?\n. @magnumripper That's a good question actually. When I saw this I thought about this is some OSX speciality I don't know about. This works fine for Linux/Windows usually.\n. @mouse07410 I've pushed https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/2a330122b4095506aa16fce1d2d83707e528c2cf which includes the changes you suggested\n. @matrix Good work.

Good testing man, keep going\n. @neheb Can you fix those please: cc1: error: unrecognized command line option \u2018-Wfloat-conversion\u2019\n. There's also a technical reason for this. That is because hashcat can not now how fast an attack really is before actually running it. That is because in mask-mode, the mask has to be split in two parts internally and it depends on different factors at which position to split it. That means with a chaning mask (due to increment) the split point changes and if the split point changes, the performance changes. If the performance changes the time estimation changes.\n.

Hm, doesn't happend here. How do you compile?\n. Some more discussion material:\n\nFrom @magnumripper \n\nJtR core supports arbitrarily long salts but most optimized formats has a fairly tight limit just like Hashcat, to keep things in one or two Merkel Damgard blocks.\nThis particular format is supported in JtR as dynamic_2009 (only CPU) with salt lengths up to 200 (same format with max. 23 bytes salt is dynamic_9 and it's obviously faster).\n\nFrom https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/79\n\nA new limit on length to 35-40 on the most common algorithms\n\nFrom https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/95\n\nSaltLen = 130\n\nFrom https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/442\n\n... whatever hashcat supports salt length 40 or not.\n. There's such a system for the different passwords lengths (to make automatic use of zero-based optimizations). I think we can do the same for salt lengths.\n. I've made some experiments to find about what speed loss this will cause to the existing modes. Here's the results from my 750Ti using the same hash:salt combination for all 4 tests:\n\ncurrent sha1($salt.$pass):\n-a0: 734.4 MH/s\n-a3: 1047.2 MH/s\nmodified sha1($salt.$pass) with support for up to length 64 salt and length 64 password:\n-a0: 665.5 MH/s (10% loss)\n-a3: 864.5 MH/s (21% loss)\n. If you're interessted, I've pushed a branch which allows cracking of passwords and salts up to length 256 both here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/tree/longer_passwords_and_salts\nThe drops are not that big as in previous attempts, but they are a bit more work intensive. Means each kernel would require a work intensive rewrite. For example, there would be a kernel that allows only combination of 16+16, 32+32 and all+all. This way the drop on MD5 (in -a 1 mode) is: 1451.5 MH/s -> 1374.6 MH/s. In -a 0 (rules) mode, the drop will be much bigger of course.\nIt is however only working with md5 and in -a 1 mode and it's more like an experiment. You can rewrite it to do sha256 if you have some programming experience. . Finished implementation with v4.0.0. Can reproduce, fixing\n. I think I can agree if we find a way to tell if a string is a valid UTF-8 string. For example $HEX[00003030] surely is not. In such a case we should stick to $HEX[...]. Is there any easy way to check this?\n. merged, thanks!\n. The output of a cracked hash to stdout, even in combination with --quiet, is the wanted behavior if you do not specify -o. The event of a cracked hash is too important to get lost/unnoticed. It also goes back to the time when we did not had --machine-readable, the --quiet option was used to help to reduce the number of output to skip/ignore in case output was used from a script. Anyway if you use -o the output should be totally quiet. I think we shouldn't do a change at this point.\nThe thing with the slowdown is different. There's a couple of things that need to be done when we have a cracked hash and they all slow down the process. I always thought that's ok, because a cracked hash is a rare event. For one, a mutex gets active and blocks all other threads to output more cracked hashes. But I think the biggest slowdown is that the output file is opened and closed every time a new password is cracked. Reason here is that we want to allow the user he can remove the output file safely while hashcat is running. If there's a better solution that allows us to keep the fd open I'm open to change this, but it should support the case that the user removes the outfile while hashcat runs.\n. I guess that must have been going under while I was refactoring everything, sorry. It didn't happen intentionally. \nI'm wondering, you're locking the files, but never unlock them. Do you think it's ok?\n. > You should ideally open your session file at start of run, then lock it and never close it (I think that's not the case right now) until actually exiting\nIf it's not the case, I will rewrite it to do that because that's the expected behaviour. I'll do that after the merge.\n\nAre you planing to add something to this or can I merge already?\n. OK I merged, the compiler complains about the following when compiling for windows:\nIn file included from src/logfile.c:11:0:\nsrc/logfile.c: In function \u2018logfile_append\u2019:\ninclude/locking.h:23:28: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]\n #define lock_file(dummy)   0\n                            ^\nsrc/logfile.c:54:3: note: in expansion of macro \u2018lock_file\u2019\n   lock_file (fp);\n   ^\nCan you try to find a different solution?\n. I'll merge this. I'll maybe change the check for LM and move it to here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/interface.c#L17428-L17443\nand add an option like OPTS_TYPE_PT_NO_UTF8 to mark those algorithms. Thanks for that check, saves me alot of headache checking for it :)\n. I don't like this alot, because it creates some inbalance. It would enable to set -s and -l for an iterated attack, but only for one special. For example, this would not work to set -s and -l for a folder full of wordlists, which hashcat supports and which is also an iterated attack.\nOTOH I don't see a reason how this helps in a distributed solution. In such a scenario, there should be no iterated attack at all, because it becomes hard to control. \n. Like, every attack that support wordlist also supports wordlist folders, except -a1. \nSee here:\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# cat hash\n7f306bca1a462127e59b9154599c443a\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# cat wordlist1.txt \nword1\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# cat wordlist2.txt \nword2\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# ./hashcat hash *.txt --quiet                       \n7f306bca1a462127e59b9154599c443a:word2 \nroot@sf:~/hashcat#\nThat means if we change support for -s and -l we should change it for all attack modes, otherwise this creates confusion. \nOn the other hand I still don't see why we should need this in case of a mask file. I see that loading a large hashlist will take time, and restarting hashcat will create some overhead then. But having a large hashlist means you're trying to crack a fast hash, not a list of scrypt hashes. But fast hashes and small masks - this is a waste of time anyway. What I means is there's a misconception here if you try to distribute workload of fast hashes with small masks. This would make sense only if you want to crack a slow hash, but for a slow hash you wouldn't try to crack a large hashlist. Currently, when you use a large mask, the total runtime of the session will take longer and then it will make sense to hashcat to restart and to reload the hashes.\nFinally, the implementation is kinda buggy. For example:\nline1: ?u?d?d?d?u?d?d?d|30000|20000\nThen how could a user create a mask that includes the prefix |30000|20000? Currently this mask would be a valid mask, for good reason. The currect implementation would either be to move those options to the left and create two special (optional) columns for it. Or as alternative, since hashcat has good support for escape characters, why not simply continue to use \",\" as separator character. If the user actually wanted to use \",\" as a fixed character in the mask he can escape it. Either way, that's just implementation. The main reason I don't want this is the one state above.\n. Hey, I can not reproduce. Can you please compile from source using\nDEBUG=1 and paste a bt from gdb?\nOn 06.11.2016 16:36, thesle3p wrote:\n\nHey it looks like hashcat core dumps at run time starting two commits\nago.

Can you please explain why do you need this feature at all?\n. See https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/572 for discussion\n. In theory yes. But this would create some coding effort that I don't really see the sense of it. There's absolutely no performance benefit here. The time it takes would simply multiple by the number of TC volumes you try to crack, like with every salted hash. The difference is that other salted hashes do not come in binary form. So the correct way to implement this would be to rewrite the truecrypt (and so also the veracrypt) parser so that it reads a hash by parsing a hashline, but that would also require some truecrypt2hashcat preloader. I mean this is all possible, but as I said it only creates effort without any benefit so why do it?\n. No response from OP, closing\n. Nice, thanks!\n. Good stuff! I think I fixed them all. Please verify and close the issue.\n. You need to quote, because of the $ char. The shell will try to interpret it as a variable otherwise:\n\n./hashcat64.bin -m 12500 '$RAR3$*0*45109af8ab5f297a*adbf6c5385d7a40373e8f77d7b89d317'\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Good stuff, thanks!\n. Unbelieveable! Thanks :)\n. You mean, on the same hccap or a different one?\n. I'm not certain how the hashes are converted (using cap2hccap) exactly, so it could be like @magnumripper said. Only thing I can say is that hashcat does not longer change the ordering of the mac addresses since v3.00. Here's a snippet from the changes:\n\nFixed a bug in implementation of WPA/WPA2: MAC and nonce stay one their original position as in the hccap file\n\nAlso note that it's possible you have two handshakes (or more) with the same essid and mac addresses in your hccap dump. You should check if the file is of exactly 392 byte. If that's the case, please send me all data and commandline options I need to reproduce this case and I'll fix it.\n. Thanks!\n. So far, I've fixed everything (and more) that looked like a real problem. \nThere's two error types left that I find somehow invalid:\n\nObsolescent function 'usleep' called\n\nI really don't see any reason why to change that. There's no sign of deprecation or whatever. Also it's ideal for us, because both linux and windows have it.\n\nResource leak\n\nThis is kind of an error report. For example, the first one:\n[src/cpu_crc32.c:95]: (error) Resource leak: fd\nI've tracked this down. \n- It's totally not related to any FILE* so I don't know why it calls the variable \"fd\". This error repeats\n- It complains about the fact that some memory was allocated but the function returned without free() it. That would be ok to complain unless in an error case. We explicitely check with VERIFY_PTR if the memory allocation was successfull and only if not we return. I mean, what else can we do?\n\n[src/dispatch.c:434]: (style) The scope of the variable 'words_off' can be reduced.\n\nI could fix this pretty easy but I had a nice idea how to rewrite that entire section to be more easy to read. But not before the release, so let it here as kind of a marker.\n. OK, good to know. Any reason to let this issue open?\n. Can you please retry with 3.20 rc2 ?

I'm using 375.20 as well, it's the latest stable version. \n\nThe nvmlDeviceSetPowerManagementLimit requires root permission, but it doesn't hurt if you don't use it. It's mostly important for modern high end GPU to disable over-aggressive powersave features.\nThe XNVCTRLQueryTargetAttribute() however is kind of suspicious. Do you run hashcat via ssh? Did you add the required access control to X11 so that an external program can query X11?. I've pushed some change. Since I can not reproduce your error (and I tried really hard) it's almost impossible to fix it. Please check if the error still occurs and, more important, if the program crashed.

I don't know either. Let's hope 32 bit OS will die soon :). Kind of looks like the NV gpu isn't the problem here but the Intel ones. Can you please post the full output of clinfo and hashcat -I . Hm, I can't say for sure but my gutfeeling tells me that this error is caused by some OpenCL installation error, not by hashcat. What's really strange here is that the same OpenCL runtime is called twice (Platform 1 and 3), as you can see on the clinfo output. I'd suggest to uninstall all OpenCL drivers from Intel and to uninstall the NVidia driver, too. \nIdeally, follow these steps: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do especially the part with driver fusion and the manual delete of opencl.dll is important. In case you had AMD drivers installed before, also remove them using driver fusion.\nAfter that, install nvidia drivers (but not the cuda sdk) and then intel opencl runtime (also, not the sdk).\n. @cclements Any update?.

Good fixes, thanks!. This is some effect that is related to the potfile file locking. You can see this through a strace:\nfcntl(3, F_SETLKW, {l_type=F_WRLCK, l_whence=SEEK_SET, l_start=0, l_len=0}\n^ blocking there\n@magnumripper Do you really think we need the potfile locking? Hashcat could handle this use case out of the box if the locking is not active\n. Many thanks! There's other files that do locking, too. For example\n\ndebugfile: filename must be given be the user, but would lock in case same file used: not sure if we need a fix at all in such a case, but I don't think so..\ndictstat: only uses locking for writing and instantly closes afterwards: no fix required\nhashfile: like dictstat, also requires --remove\nlogfile: like fixed loopback\nkernelfiles (cache): like dictstat\noutfile: like debugfile\nstdout: like debugfile\n\nIn general, should be fine as-is. OK, so the sysctl () call in FreeBSD returns the real path, not a link, right?. Nice, didn't know that. About the printf() leftover, I think there's no messages that are neither warnings nor errors that use strerror(). So it should be ok. Thanks!. Thanks for report and the analysis. You're absolutely right about how this works. However not a bug, it's a controlled compromise.\nThe reason for all this goes back to the problem that the format \"hash:password\" is a broken format itself, unless CSV would be handled correctly. But that's not the case. Even if hashcat could handle CSV correctly, other tools usually fail, and especially hashdumps you can find in the wild do. That's why I've never thought about adding true CSV parsing in here.\nFrom a technical view, a program can not decide if it parses the string \"hash:salt:pass:word\" which part of it is the hash, the salt and the password. There's two ways to interpret it:\n\n\"hash\" is the hash, \"salt\" is the salt, \"pass:word\" is the password\n\"hash\" is the hash, \"salt:pass\" is the salt, \"word\" is the password\n\nSo the question is, how should we process is. This becomes very complicated and there's event different approaches. In hashcat we decided to use a strategy that if we split the string, but from the right to the left and not from the left to the right, we iterate through all possible variants and accept the first that makes it through the hash parsing check. To not run through this for an unlimited time, we set a maximum number of so called \"MAX_CUT_TRIES\". You can find that in include/common.h and it's currently set to 4, which matches your report.\nWe could increase that value now to something higher, but to which? If we set it to 8, the same problem will occur again if a user runs into the same problem you have but with 8 colons. A much better solutions would be to make the parser more like a real CSV parser that understands escaping. But if we do that, the potfile will become incompatible with out tools like JtR or others.\nSo we end up in a situation where we can only try to find a compromise and that's what we did.\n. @magnumripper What do you think, should we add better RFC conform parsing of CSV to hashcat and JtR?. That seems to be an elegant solution to this problem, I think I'll add that.. With commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/1342cf2ce34eb7337605fa66cd81035e27b3fa1f we changed the logic to use $HEX[...]  in case the separator character is used in the password. This will solve the problem shown in the initial post but requires the potfile to be build up from scratch.. The problem here is that there's no unique id that we can use to match an OpenCL device with an ADL/NVML/NVAPI/SYSFS/XNVCTRL device, so we have to use some fuzzy logic which is likely to fail on complex setups with many different devices.\nTo understand at which point the matching fails I need to know more details about your system. Let's start with something simple. Please post a full output of both: \"hashcat -I\" and, more important,  \"clinfo\".  Also I don't know on which system this is, but the Drivers temperature threshold usually is a unique NVML feature, so I'd guess this is on a windows system.. I've pushed some change with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/2c82e53d3852b15a99f14012d2af2893242f70b7 which uses pci ids to match NVML with OpenCL devices. The problem with your setup seems to be the mix of ADL and NVML, but using this patch it should be clever enough to handle it. There's also a new beta binary on here: https://hashcat.net/beta/\nPlease try if your issue is fixed and close the issue. Any updates here?. @ZerBea Can you confirm both issues fixed?\n@matrix Thanks for patch. Just a suggestion, why don't you just pair the Iris and Iris Pro into a group so that the tuning will work on both the same way? hashcat.hctune supports that.. OK, thanks for reporting. Can you please post a full output of \"clinfo\" tool. Also please post output of \"hashcat -I\" on hashcat v3.20. Thanks!. Looks like this is some AMD-and-only-on-Windows issue. Need to build such a system locally to reproduce. . No, give me some time so that I can build a new PC using the combination of Windows + AMD GPU otherwise I can not reproduce. Wait, is this from a notebook computer?. Since I don't have a Windows+AMD system for test I wrote some code change blindly. Can you please try this version: https://hashcat.net/beta/hashcat-3.20%2b59%2bADLTEST.7z and post what it's doing?\n. It's updated in the meanwhile, please manually pick latest version from here: https://hashcat.net/beta/.

Please post full commandline used. Also post output of \"clinfo\" and \"hashcat -I\". Also try to narrow the problem to whatever it is related to the CPU or GPUs by trying different variants of -D. What about hardware monitor (Fan, Temp, etc) for the GTX1080's, is that working when you do not use the CPU?. Is this watercooled?. OK, I was just wondering about the 0% fan speed and that one:\nWatchdog: Temperature retain trigger disabled\nSo that's correct then.\nAbout that CPU error, does that occur only with WPA?. Both 2100 and 2500 are slow hashes. Maybe the runtime doesn't like long running kernels, like with OSX. Can you retry with -w 1?. I've tried to reproduce in my Intel CPU + NVIDIA GPU system but can't. It seems like you're using the correct Intel OpenCL runtime. For some reason however my clinfo shows the devices reversed, so the GPU first, then the CPU. I don't think this is the reason of the problem but indicates that there's some OpenCL installation difference between our versions. Anyway it doesn't seem to be a hashcat problem, so please let's continue to find the source of the problem on hashcat forum. The github is only for bugs and feature requests.. Did you run make clean before?. Great! Thanks!. Right, if you do > 100000 MH/s it will switch to GH/s. I find it easier to read that way. Is there a special reason to use \"MINGW32\" (32 bit only) mingw macro / was that done intentional?. I'm sorry I think this was lost during refactoring.. That's actually a problem in v3.10 which was undetected, but is now detected in v3.20. The problem is the command you're using. You need to remove the hashlist. If you used --keyspace in combination with a hashlist before, you always used it wrong.. No problem, I just don't see how we can handle both the old and the new commandline parsing configuration at once. So this will break old overlays and also many tutorials and forum help threads. I'll redirect complains to you :). I've changed my mind about this while implementing. It's really more disadvantages than advantages. Alternatively we could up a shortcut for both --increment-min and --increment-max, what you think?. --increment-range 4:8 with 'R' as shortcut? @blandyuk ?. Yes, but assigning 'R' to it would work. What I mean, if sticking to\n--increment-min and --increment-max, what would be the shortcut? It\nwouldn't be intuitive because both min and max start with 'm'.\nOn 10.12.2016 00:29, magnum wrote:\n\nSame problem.

I still prefer the way it is right now. Adding code for handling any backward compatiblity was never how hashcat worked. We can assume users follow the changes because the typical hashcat user is a more experienced user. Bundled with bash completion (which hashcat supports) it's typed really fast with --inc . I've add that with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/ec5610271aae422cfe856bcf4870901baed35641\nPlease try and close the issue if that works for you.\nOutput looks like this:\n```\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat example0.hash -a 3 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a -w 3 --progress-only --mac\nhashcat (v3.20-27-gf9ba949+) starting in progress-only mode...\n1:327680:112190.53\nStarted: Fri Dec  9 23:46:09 2016\nStopped: Fri Dec  9 23:46:12 2016\n```\nThe output is per device, ideal -l size and the time (in miliseconds). For example, if you want to calculate a runtime of ~ 10 Minutes, you'd do: \n\n(60 * 10 * 1000) / 112190.53 = 5,3480449731363244295218143634761\nRound the result down, so result = 5\n5 * 327680 = 1638400\nUse -l 1638400\n\n.

OK, new commit pushed, also new beta up. This should fix the multiple salt issue. It actually was just a multiple salt issue. With a single hash, salted or not, the number was already correct as I've expected. \nMore important, do not forget to add an amplifier (like rules) for fast hashes, otherwise you'll end up with bad numbers caused by pci-express overhead.. From what I can see from your output, the time to compute the ideal -l\nvalue is around 7 seconds. That also includes initializing OpenCL\ndevices, compiling the OpenCL kernel, creating the wordlist cache and\ndoing the autotuning. However, from what you can see in the output, the\nchunk will run 534 seconds, that's a lot more. than 7 seconds. I don't\nunderstand why you can say that this is almost the same time?!\nOne note about the startup time: It will startup faster once the OpenCL\nkernel and wordlist stat is cached. Basically each second time you call\na specific command. Anyway even 7 seconds for so much work is pretty\ngood I think.\nI fully agree that a keyspace value should be small, because it makes\nthe distribution easier. However, a keyspace progress value of 262144 is\nreally good, but that is because you didn't specify to use -w 3. If you\ndo not set -w 3, hashcat operates at -w 2 which is the default. It can\nbe even smaller if you use -w 1, but it will reduce the performance,\ntoo. That's the price of massive parallelized setups like GPU. You need\nto have enough work for them. But as I said 262144 is really good. There\nshouldn't be any problem with that value in a distributed setup.\nOn 10.12.2016 16:37, Sein Coray wrote:\n\nI tried now with the same salted hashlist again, it works as it should\nnow.\n|$ hashcat/hashcat --machine-readable --opencl-devices=3\n--hash-type=2711 hashlists/hl24 -a 0 files/wordlist.txt\n--progress-only hashcat (v3.20-30-g367024d+) starting in progress-only\nmode... 3:262144:534965.57 Started: Sat Dec 10 16:23:32 2016 Stopped:\nSat Dec 10 16:32:45 2016 |\nAs you see the benchmarking took quite some time, nearly as much as a\nchunk normally would be approximately.

Nice, the first PR which adds a rule. The question is just why we would need such a rule. I know there's hash-modes that need zero byte padding, but in this case it's better to have a dedicated hash-mode added. Can you please explain what's the reason you put this into a rule?. I'd prefer to not have any collisions between hashcat and JtR rule\ncommands. Can you make a suggestion for an alternative name that is not\nin use by JtR currently?\nOn 17.12.2016 23:10, magnum wrote:\n\nJtR has 'P' for english grammar (eg. crack -> cracked).

I'm really happy to see a new rule function added via PR, but in this case I think the correct way to implement this logic into the hash mode kernel. Otherwise you can't do mask attacks and combinator attacks against such a hash mode because rules are not supported in those. If you need help in how to add a new hash-mode, contact me on IRC.. Very nice, didn't expect that :)\n2 things needs fixes:\n\nPlease add mode for test.pl and test.sh (and test them)\nI see you move SHA256 -> SHA2, which is ok, but you should also move SHA384 and SHA512 then, because they are SHA2 as well. Perfect!. hashcat v3.10 is outdated, please update to v3.20 and reopen if the issue still exists. Nice find, thanks for reporting. Should be fixed.. But that doesn't really solve the problem. The same problem will occur\nagain if the character selected for separator will be part of the debug\nline.\n\nWe've recently solved a similar problem for the output file by switching\nto $HEX[...] encoding if the separator character is part of the data.\nFor example, if the password is \"lala:\" (without quotes) then the output\nwith the latest hashcat version is:\n```\n757f75dc2ce17be3bb9ccc1f3f565b51:$HEX[6c616c613a]\n```\nand not\n```\n757f75dc2ce17be3bb9ccc1f3f565b51:lala:\n```\nThe same systematic could be done for debug mode line.\nOn 19.12.2016 03:37, recon-ng wrote:\n\nIf I have strings with \":\" in them, parsing debug files is hard since\nthe rule can't be easily distinguished from the source and result\nstrings (especially if the rule itself operates on the \":\" character.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/923, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJ83OQftiVwpLPSDPrcYcQdmmc_gmqhRks5rJe3jgaJpZM4LQUm8.\n\n\n.

You can try latest beta, maybe it fixes the \"nvmlDeviceGetFanSpeed(): Not Supported\" error, but that's not guarenteed as not all mobile GPU do not allow fanspeed control via software. It should also remove the Throttled thing. Please do not forget to close the issue if that's fine for you.. I've added a patch to hashcat to automatically disable Intel GPU devices unless the user forces to enable it: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/78d73e64fe969e2f3e8b9bed8fb11cd08ad9bbb5\nI've also put up a new binary beta to https://hashcat.net/beta/\nCan you please retest on your system if the device is automatically skipped and a warning message is presented to the user?. I think I could change this to return 3 for case 1 and 4 for case 2?. Implemented with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/c7999c66bc289023917b2178cb981f2c47585f45. The next version of hashcat (v3.30) which will be released in the next days have an even better solution to this. \n- New option --progress-only: Quickly provides ideal progress step size and time to process on the user hashes and selected options, then quit\nThat means you can precompute how to set the -l value. If you want to, for example, let hashcat run for 10 minutes and stop afterwards.\nFor example:\n```\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# ./hashcat example0.hash -a 3 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --progress-only --mac\nhashcat (v3.20-96-gaa89b8b+) starting in progress-only mode...\n1:458752:59219.16\n```\nThat means setting -l to 458752 (in this case) takes 59219.16 ms to progress. The good thing is, if you stick to a multiple of 458752  (in this case) hashcat can guarantee you to always run in full speed. So, if you want it to run for 10 minutes, You'd do something like:\n\n((10 * 60 * 1000) / 59219.16) = 10,131...\nEither round up or down the result and multiple it with the 458752, ex: 10 * 458752\nUse -l 4587520 and hashcat should show you a Time.Estimated ~ 10 Minutes\nBecause you have control over -l, you can control -s as well\n\nPlease close the issue if this works for you.\n. Btw here's the issue with the details how it came to this (because it can be useful in distributed computing): https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/916. Which version is that? With latest beta it looks good:\n```\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat hash\nbad55dcf7cfb409bfd851a6dd876f52e:test1\ne609d54d973edf399356156c21da6a23:test2\ne609d54d973edf399356156c21da6a23\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat hash -a3 x\nhashcat (v3.20-102-ge5e97c6) starting...\nOpenCL Platform #1: NVIDIA Corporation\n\nDevice #1: GeForce GTX 750 Ti, 507/2030 MB allocatable, 5MCU\n\nOpenCL Platform #2: The pocl project\n\nDevice #2: pthread-AMD FX(tm)-8120 Eight-Core Processor, skipped\n\nHashfile 'hash' on line 1 (bad55dcf7cfb409bfd851a6dd876f52e:test1): Line-length exception\nHashfile 'hash' on line 2 (e609d54d973edf399356156c21da6a23:test2): Line-length exception\n```\n.

Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/038b915e2da7951f2599b5894169e54c93142c19\nThanks!. I need the .hccap you're using to reproduce locally. OK, I got the file. Now I need one example of a duplicate which is not detected as duplicate. Please name me one.. Yeah I think I found the root problem. Need to think about a good solution. Prepare for testing :). OK, I've patched hashcat. There's also a new beta at https://hashcat.net/beta/\nIn an ideal world, the output of your file should look like this:\nHashes: 69295 digests; 66980 unique digests, 57302 unique salts\nThat is because your file has 11993 handshakes with the same ESSID. Now the problem is that there's a chance that some of those handshakes have the same ESSID, but they are actually from a different AP. There's no way for hashcat to know about this. Therefore we must check all the handshakes, even if they have the same ESSID. But we can still make use of the duplicate ESSID shortcut. I've patched hashcat, so don't get confused if you see this loading screen instead:\nHashes: 69295 digests; 69295 unique digests, 69295 unique salts\nIt will still make use of the duplicate PBKDF2 shortcut. You can find out if you meassure the time it takes to process a full wordlist. Simply ignore what the \"Time.Estimated\" in the status screen tells you.\n. This is important to help the not so advanced users to be able to compile a native hashcat binary and run it without using the install target or using LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The only practical way I see to handle this is to remove the RPATH when using the make install target. What do you think?. Teaching people how to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH is far too big of a goal for the hashcat project. The only solution is that we remove the rpath when the user uses make install target. How exactly did you do it? I see the tools \"patchelf\" and \"chrpath\" can do it. Which one would you suggest?. I kind of agree, but such an wrapper script would confuse new users.\nIt's not very intuitive, so it's not a good solution. Do you have any\nother ideas?\nOn 23.01.2017 16:33, Levente Polyak wrote:\n\nas said, you don't need to teach anyone about LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you\nhave a wrapper script that does so and uses explicitly the directory\nwhere the shared lib was built in. its still vulnerable for all people\nwho don't use the install target.\nThe only solution to this issue is to not use relative rpath at all\nand add a wrapper script to start hashcat when not being in a\n'installed' target, otherwise the users is always vulnerable to\nunintended code execution.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/956#issuecomment-274519690,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJ83OU3WZCE8OXTYs0XHxBMAShdeCeisks5rVMgxgaJpZM4LdmIB.\n\n\n. Well as already discussed, the problem would occur only with the\nself-compiled version which then is not used with the make install\ntarget, because this target will have the rpath removed. That means that\nan attacker would need to convince the victim to compile hashcat with\n\"make\" but not to install it with \"make install\". After that, he need to\nconvince him to execute hashcat but before that, to change the cwd to a\ndifferent one first. This folder must be one that the attacker has\nwrite-permission to. Do you agree so far?\nIf that's the case, only the \"local\" compiled version is a problem. This\nversion has the target output file named \"hashcat\" for purpose. It's\nbecause it's the most intuitive output filename for the binary I can\nthink of what the user expect to have after the compilation. Now, as you\nsuggested, imagine we rename this binary to hashcat.bin and additionally\nadd a wrapper script called \"hashcat\" which then calls the\n\"hashcat.bin\". New and unexperienced users will call this script before\nthey would even think about they have to compile hashcat in the first\nplace. They will execute it and get an error message because hashcat\ndoes not exist. We can make it a good warning to inform the user to\ncompile the binary first, but most of them do not read. They will simply\nclose the shell, remove the hashcat folder and never try it again. The\nuser is probably lost forever. That's why I'm looking for a different\nsolution.\nOn 23.01.2017 16:37, Levente Polyak wrote:\n\nI don't see the difference, wherever you put you hashcat executable\ncould be the place to have the hashcat wrapper script.

No absolutely not, I just want to find a good solution, that's all.\nAnother problem with such a wrapper script is that it needs to be\ncompatible with all the platforms where hashcat already works on. This\ncan be tricky to find a script which works for OSX, FreeBSD, Mingw,\nMSYS2, Cygwin and Linux all at once. If you want, please send in a\nscript as PR and I'll merge it.\nI also think of another solution. Maybe its better to step back to the\nway it was before (statically compiled) but also add the shared library\nusecase with a special \"shared\" Makefile target.

I tend to the 2nd version but I need to think about it some more time.. OK, I've implemented as we discussed the 2nd solutions. So we've completely removed rpath :). Update 14000, 14100 and 14400.\nMode 1300 is not part of hashcat (only hashcat-legacy). Can you please rewrite so that it does not use a NOT. We try to stick to positive cases only for easier reading.. All systems (just not apple?). This feature was never a wanted feature in older version. It was \"just luck\" that it worked like that. Therefore not ported to new version. \nBut I can see how it can be useful. Have to think about how to re-add it with new architecture.\n. Support has been added. Note that the high performance will create tons of collisions, thus it's printing them all and not stopping after one has been found. We can change that if you want.. No, it's a bug, not wanted behaviour. I can reproduce.. Fixed, thanks for reporting. Yes, the --veracrypt-pim option is currently not supported, it has nothing to do with the selected cipher. Since I do not have OSX I can not reproduce. Did you make sure to run \"make clean\" before compiling?. Can you please retry with latest github version? It's doing some detailed file permissions checks on startup, maybe it will give us some more useful debugging output. Also, what is homebrew, maybe it's related?. Thanks! Great work. Can you please retry on Ubuntu? Kali is known to run a broken OpenCL runtime installation.. Should be fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/9005b6662663ebbfab7025d03aa661374d34bf31\nIf it's not working for you, please reopen the issue. Thanks for reporting!. Please do not run any OpenCL application inside a VM, the OpenCL runtimes are instable enough. Please retry on the host directly.. OpenCL is a nieche product and does not have many users giving feedback. Therefore you need to expect multiple bugs in the vendor's driver and their OpenCL runtimes. When we reports bugs, they are typically silenty ignored because from a vendors perspective there's not enough money in fixing those. That's why I said that you shouldn't use a VM.\nHowever, as @epixoid already mentioned, this is not a hashcat issue. We can't fix the vendors drivers. Also, when it comes to multiple GPU support, this is well tested by many hashcat users, even mixed types.. That's not what I'm saying and I think there's some misunderstand here.\nWe're not that kind of developer who ignore users feedback. We care\nabout and we feel no shame admitting bugs if there are any. You can see\nthat from hashcat's changelog, it's full with descriptions about fixed\nbugs.\nBut in your case, you are wrong. The observation with the TDR settings\nare just a fix to a symptom, but not the problem. The problem is that\nthe timing numbers from your SHA1 are ways too high (you can see it in\nthe screenshot after the speed). They should be around 90ms (in -w 3\nmode). Also, if single GPU's randomly drop in utilization that's\nsomething we've experienced in the past already, and it's always\nsomething wrong on a lower level, for example the OpenCL runtime or the\ndevice driver or on the hardware layer the MB or the PSU or even a\nbroken GPU. But all of this stuff is out of our reach to fix\nOn 18.02.2017 14:04, marukka wrote:\n\nSo basically what you're saying is that your code is infailable, and\nthat everyone else must be at fault.

I don't think thhat's comparable. When it comes to the OS they have\nlarge access to the system hardware and can workaround a specific bug.\nIn OpenCL, all we have is an API and we have to follow the way the API\nhas to be used. If the path we are forced to use is broken, there's\nsimply no way for us to workaround.\nAgain, if this would be a problem that we could workaround, we'd do it.\nThe example you gave with modify the registry however is not possible.\nFor one it eventually requires administrative permissions and a user\nwould be confused if we ask for it. Since we're in the scope of security\nsoftware people are even more sharp about it. Another reason is that we\ncan not simply restart the driver because there might be other\napplications already running and using the OpenCL interface (or any\nother GPU related API) and we'd break those.\nI've personally reported bugs to nvidia but as I said, they are ignored.\nReason is, again, because OpenCL is a nieche product and they don't care\nif there are any bugs. But said so, feel free to report it yourself.\nOn 18.02.2017 14:44, marukka wrote:\n\nI apologize as I may have been a bit rash. But my point I think still\nstands.

There's none, but you need to understand how NVML and OpenCL measures\nthese units. For NVML, it's unknown because it's closed source. For\nOpenCL, there's no function inside the API. We measure it simply by\ndividing the number of hashes calculated with the time it took from the\nstart of the OpenCL kernel till it's return (and eventual copy\ntransactions before). So this is a blocking function which means it's\neither finished or not. There's no way for us to know what's actually\ngoing on on the GPU.\nOn 18.02.2017 14:53, marukka wrote:\n\nAlso it would be nice if you could address hashcat incorrectly\nrecording device performance.

What I wanted to say is that there's simply no different path if you\nhave to navigate inside an API rather than a free environment like an OS\n(or Application context). Therefore a workaround is sometimes possible,\nbut not in this case.\nSuch an applications break by driver restart event will not occur if the\nerror itself would not occur. That's why it's more important to fix the\nproblem rather than to try to workaround. You also have no guarantee\nthat the workaround will work as wanted. Whenever some situation is out\nof control, everything can happen. That could be, for example, false\nnegatives and that's something you really don't want in a password\ncracking tool. It would be not maintainable for developers because each\nnew error could be caused by the workaround and you can not know or not\nknow.\nI don't think it makes sense to reimplement that error message. In the\npast it had confused people more than it helped, especially new and\nunexperienced users.\nIn case you don't know, but hashcat in the past was 50/50 OpenCL/CUDA.\nThere's multiple problems with CUDA from a technical perspective but the\nmost important difference is that CUDA does not support AMD GPU or Intel\nCPU while OpenCL does.\nOn 18.02.2017 15:38, marukka wrote:\n\nThe FDIV bug wasnt worked around at the OS level afaik.

OP not responding but we believe this case be fixed with TDR patch which hashcat is warning the user now on startup, therefore closing. Thanks @ZerBea for reporting. The problem is the more ambiguation strings you allow (for whatever parameter) the lower the chance for getting help from non-developers. That is because most users, once they have an understanding of the option, do not care about changes that are added later to the option. \nIf a new users steps into hashcat universe and needs help but then uses such ambiguation the people that maybe could know the answer get confused by the ambiguation and stop thinking about helping them.. Not a bug this time. It's important to feed hashcat with enough words in the wordlist. In your case it's only ~100k words -> 43270828920  / (1000 * 418 ) = 103518\nIf your intention was to get enough traction by using -a 6 that's possible, but you need to do it differently.\nSo, instead of:\nhashcat -m 2500 -w 3 --remove --logfile-disable --potfile-disable --outfile-autohex-disable --outfile-format=3 -o found.list test.hccap -a 6 wordlist ?d?d?d\nDo this:\nhashcat --stdout -a 6 wordlist ?d?d?d | hashcat -m 2500 -w 3 --remove --logfile-disable --potfile-disable --outfile-autohex-disable --outfile-format=3 -o found.list test.hccap\nThis should give you full speed..

Please use latest beta version, the issue should be fixed. Closing this issue because there's a solution from @DoZ10 and at the same time there's no known frameworks/application that are using this. Feel free to reopen in case some frameworks/application will pop up.. We'd need to support ChaCha20 and Argon2 first.. Is that exactly what JtR does? I mean, is that all of it?. I agree with @magnumripper. The single mode, to be efficient, needs a different architecture which is kind of incompatible with devices (such as gpu) that require high parallelization (especially with mixed gpu types). There's a reason why hashcat limits the weak-hash-check (empty password) to a maximum of 100 salts. It would slow down the startup too much, especially with slow algorithms like LUKS or itunes. Adding more password candidates would not make a big difference in startup time for fast hashes, but for slow ones. There's also the problem of how to feed hashcat with a wordlist that is build out of data using --username. Such a logic could be implemented, but that's additional effort. \nMaybe in the future, when hashcat makes another refactorization that enables iterating through salts in the inner loop, this could be a thing to add, but I only see limited potential for this atm.... I have no experience with Android development. Maybe someone else can answer the questions. Thanks :). Nice, I can reproduce this on my Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz, 2047/15999 MB allocatable, 8MCU. The -a 3 works, but the -a 0 fails\n.

I think it's fine as it is. Please reopen the issue if you can not live with it ;). I didn't know about appveyor. Do I need to \"activate\" it like with travis?. The PR caused multiple problems.\n\n\nThe globbing \"CRT_glob.o\" which is required to do globbing with mingw wasn't found anymore when compiling on Msys2, Cygwin or on linux using the cross compiler.

The cross-compilation targets are ment to be called from linux only and to generate the binary package. If we remove it its too confusing. Can you please modify the PR ?. Was the NVML initialization successfull? Does nvidia-smi work?. I've tested with Xanadrel. We had to update to latest driver, but after that the Titan X worked fine.. Support added with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/c28fdf7f44bf5d39f9078f6d82b52bdb052125e3. Should be fixed. Please test. If not working, please reopen issue. Both changes look good to me. Not sure what's going on with AppVeyor but this seems to be a different issue. We should open an issue for it, but that's not related to this PR. Update:\nAfter some tests I found out that there's actually no more need for glob.o when using the _dowildcard variable. For me this variable was unknown, which is the only reason why I've always used the glob.o instead.\nI've tested cygwin, Msys2 and the cross-compilation from Linux. They all work fine, therefore I've also removed the win_file_globbing.mk include which makes the Makefile more easy to read.\nI hope this will also simplify the process with the appveyor integration.. @stephengroat I think the .yml PR was fine as it was before. All the other stuff has been dealt with. So if you create a new PR with just the .yml we can merge that.. @stephengroat I've merged the .yml. Do you think we should add the appveyor badge to README.md as we do with the travis one? Can you please create a PR for that.\n@stephengroat With your new PR you've changed the git submodule init behavior. While it's not problem related to this change, do you know who to tell travis to checkout the correct commit and not just the latest? We intentionally use an older version but travis seems to ignore this. @stephengroat @philsmd Guys, thanks for PR's!. Please use latest beta version, the issue should be fixed. @magnumripper Please do a suggestion on the character to use. @julioauto While I find your syntax more intuitive I also like the idea of using / and %. We should use the same approach to stay compatible with JtR ruleset.. Note that hashcat also inherited this function but from PasswordsPro,\nwhich I thought inherited from crack.

From your repository it seems you've overwritten your hashcat.exe by using the redirect operator > which then leads to Access Denied (not refused). Please learn how to use a commandline first.. I'll merge this now, because I'd like to see the compile process getting tested. If the tests in the post compilation process fail that's bad and you should remove or fix by creating a new PR. One step at a time!.  It's multiple threads writing to the same memory section. There's really no way to get rid of atomics.. OK, we can do that. Question is just how. I think it's better (for the user) if we abort hashcat with an error message and not try to fix his errors silently. I'd suggest abort hashcat with an appropriate error message if the user specifies a custom charset but does not specify a mask.. So much green :+1: . Thanks. The use of NULL for the format variable is something gcc doesn't like much. Given the code:\nprintf(NULL);\ngcc returns with:\nwarning: null argument where non-null required (argument 1) [-Wnonnull]\nSo this seems to be the wrong approach to me. But I can see the need for it. There's another way to do it. Instead of \nevent_log_info (hashcat_ctx, NULL);\none could do\nevent_log_info (hashcat_ctx, \"%s\", \"\");\nThis makes every compiler happy but not us coders, because that looks kind of strange.\nSo as another alternative I'll try to use the patch as you suggested and add a check for null pointer and then let's see how the compiler react. There's many different compilers and versions and it seems they all react different to this.\n. It's fine, the num_files++ can be remove. The only reason it's there is because of this:\n```\n    files[num_files] = hcstrdup (path);\nnum_files++;\n\n```\nBy using a code like this:\n```\n  files[num_files] = NULL;\nnum_files++;\n```\nIt's easier for the coders' eye to identify that there's some \"pattern\" in which two variables are involved, but it's not that important. \n. OK, what to do?. I've had to add it \"manually\" because the correct hashcat/hashcat project name is already claimed. That's kind of strange and causes us to not be able to link it. That's bad because we can not integrate it into Travis CI this way. But let's first try to fix the reported problems and then see how to continue. This is the current hashcat-utils path: https://scan.coverity.com/projects/hashcat-hashcat-utils. The hashcat/hashcat project is now linked inside Covertiy to this GitHub repository. We should be able to run it from within Travis. @neheb can you try to find out how?. Very nice, thanks!. As discussed, not a reference cooler.

I'm about to add this hash-mode to hashcat finally. One question for @ratzrattillo : The hash line you posted\neyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ\nHow and where did you get it initially from? I guess this data must have been somehow sniffed from the wire? I'm asking because I'd like to stick to the original output as close as possible, so that there's no tool needed (like jwt2john) and hashcat can load it directly. However if this is just some data you've collected manually this wouldn't make sense then, thus I'm asking.. Format was added as hash-mode 16500. It supports cracking HS256, HS384 and HS512. You can compile from source or use the binary beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/. Yes, hashcat can resume at an arbitrary point in the keyspace, because of the markov mode that hashcat is using.\nThe request itself would be doable, but would not do what you think it does, except in --stdout mode maybe. OTOH it requires to rewrite some of the core kernel which is not so easy to do (and then from the host to select the correct one).\nIn GPGPU, because of the high parallelization, there's no difference in the ording when you have small masks as they are using hybrid modes. This mean, for your usecase 1, this will not work. There are all started within a single kernel invocation and then it's up to the OpenCL runtime which thread is executed at which time. That means, we do not have a direct control over it. \nFor large keyspace, like in BF, this is usecase 2, this would theoretically work, but for that case I don't see the advantage in this. It's not like the user runs hashcat with --stdout and then picks up the last password that comes out. And even if he would do that, it would be easier to make a wordlist of it and then hit it the same way.\nFor your usecase 3 I like that Idea if the markov mode would be a true markov mode. That is the total number of password candidates depend on the training data. But that's not the case in hashcat, because we can not reject candidates for fast hashes.. There's no way hashcat can do that, because it's the OpenCL runtime managing the thread count / cpu cores. Most OpenCL runtime however support an environment variable that lets you select a fixed number of core, that should help you.. Not sure if they are documented. Here's how I found them for AMD:\nroot@sf:~# strings /opt/amdgpu-pro/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libamdocl64.so | grep CPU\nCPU_WORKER_THREAD_STACK_SIZE\nCPU_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS\nCPU_USE_ALIGNMENT_MAP\nCPU_MAX_WORKGROUP_SIZE\nCPU_MEMORY_GUARD_PAGES\nCPU_MEMORY_GUARD_PAGE_SIZE\n...\nThe CPU_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS sounds good (for AMD).\n. I'm not sure if I like the changes to _WIN. It feels much better to read \"WIN\" instead of \"WIN32\" because \"WIN32\" could be misunderstand that a 64 bit compiler will not use this macro (even if it does, i've just verified). I think we should stick to the current _WIN.\nAlso what's confusing is this:\n+#if defined (__unix__) || defined (__APPLE__) || defined (__FreeBSD___)\nbut according to @magnumripper the FreeBSD should also use unix ?! since I don't have a BSD system I can not verify myself, I need a good recommendation.\nThe ADL on Cygwin sounds good.\nAnother thing I saw is that you've changed copy/paste headers from 3rd party sources, like ADL. I'd prefer to have them non-modified, even if they do not match our format settings. I know it happend before but I try to keep them as they are.. I'm closing this as it's already not longer auto-merging. Can you please resend in the ADL HW-Monitor support for cygwin? About the other stuff (Macros) we should discuss separate.. I think the problem here is a missing shared object which is part of the nvidia driver. @rhertzog Can you please make sure this file is part of Kalis nvidia drivers? Filename is \"libnvidia-ml.so\".\nOn my Ubuntu 16.04 this gets installed by the nvidia driver to \nroot@et:~# ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-ml.so\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 Feb  2 11:01 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-ml.so -> libnvidia-ml.so.1\nroot@et:~# ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-ml.so.1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Feb  2 11:01 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-ml.so.1 -> libnvidia-ml.so.378.09\nroot@et:~# ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-ml.so.378.09 \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1181216 Feb  2 11:01 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-ml.so.378.09\nThis file is important to manage temperature, fans, utilization etc.\n. I'll however add a check for this and output some warning message. I've added a new check to hashcat on startup to disable hardware monitoring in case NVML was not found even if XNVCTRL was found, because it depend on it. That's what happend in your case and lead to the segfault. \nI've pushed the fix to GitHub with commit: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/0aca372ce8e8674dbdda1cc7ce3a6b684b7d118e\nThere's also a binary beta on: https://hashcat.net/beta/\nIt would be nice if you can test the fixes.\nAdditional I recommend to push libnvidia-ml.so to Kali because this library is really useful. After that, you'll find the following informations in your status screen:\nHWMon.Dev.#1.....: Temp: 42c Fan: 33% Util: 95% Core:1189Mhz Mem:2700Mhz Lanes:16\n. You're right, the hardware monitor library has no dependency to the OpenCL library.\nHowever, from my understanding the libnvidia-ml.so library shouldn't be a separate package. It is an official part of the nvidia-driver installer that you can download from their site. I think it should get installed to the user system whenever the user installs the nvidia driver package. This also solves the problems caused by mixing different versions of the library and the driver.\nIf you really don't want to do that, the suggested packages hashcat-nvidia, hashcat-intel and hashcat-amd are actually a nice idea. Make sure those package can be installed in parallel, that is because hashcat also supports mixed GPU types (different vendors) and mixed device types (GPU and CPU) to run in parallel. I'd think of them as a kind of additional packages to a hashcat base package.. Maybe the library is not in the search path? So that hashcat will not\nfind it on Kali Systems, whatever the package is installed or not?\nOn 16.02.2017 15:32, Rapha\u00ebl Hertzog wrote:\n\n@jsteube https://github.com/jsteube So the bug reporter already had\nlibnvidia-ml1 installed... the issue is somewhere else.

I've send you 3 emails to your gmx address. Maybe check the spam folder?. Maybe. I've send you like 5 emails now. hashcat email is using gmail services and also has all kinds of SPF info in DNS. So probably blocking gmail incorrectly?. Come to IRC freenode #hashcat. OK I've pushed a a fix https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/2dd027af65b2fec951e9a9afb0b3959c55510b57 which is likely the root cause for your issue. Unfortionally this is the result of some uninitialized variable on start which means that your current potfile might contain invalid data. You need to rebuild the potfile from scratch to verify it's working. A new beta is up on https://hashcat.net/beta/. I've seen the CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES only in combination with Win10, but never with Windows version lower than 10. If there's a problem with CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT, then it's probably a combination of Windows 10 + CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT. Also note that from the status screen:\nSpeed.Dev.#3.....: 430.3 kH/s (93.89ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#4.....: 402.2 kH/s (100.53ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#5.....: 395.1 kH/s (50.80ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#6.....: 438.0 kH/s (92.30ms)\nWe can clearly see the kernel timeout is less than 2 seconds.\n. Thanks for clarify! I've re-added the check for timeout patch. I think it needs an extraction utility first. After that, adding a mode is simple, since we already have GPU code for TrueCrypt and LUKS which ships all of the ciphers, hashes and modes we'd need.. If it's AES-XTS that would be nice, since we have this kind of kernel\nalready optimized and well tested.\nOn 22.02.2017 18:27, IncognitoEntity wrote:\n\nJust writing to add support a bitlocker feature within hashcat.

I'll push this implementation to hashcat-utils soon. The only change I made is with the mapping.

OK, everything's updated. Please test. Can you please retry with --opencl-vector-width 1 also send me the header for debugging. Congratulations, I think you pulled the probably most unlikely bug I've ever seen in almost 20 years coding :)\nIt's related to the example.dict example wordlist, which has another bug. It has twice the password \"password\" in it and also directly following each other and this is also the password of your LUKS header. On top of that, it's exactly in the same workitem frame which is already as thin as possible because of the enforced -n 2 value. On top of that the buffer allocated for cracked passwords is bound to the number of hashes, which is just 1 for LUKS. But we're cracking it twice now, because the password is twice in the wordlist, leading the Kernel to write into uninitialized memory region, which then creates clEnqueueReadBuffer(), but I'm using a different GPU for testing, so that's fine.\nI'll fix this soon. In the meanwhile you can remove the 2nd password \"password\" in the example.dict.\n. Thanks!. I'll probably merge this after v3.40 release which is already in RC phase (so that it will go into v3.50). Great PR!. I've taken some time to look into this. I must admit I'm still not convinced using autoconf/automake.\nFirst of all when I run ./autogen.sh I get tons of warnings. From technical perspective this is usually not a problem, but from a user perspective it gives the impression that the developers did not even test their own tools and the first impression counts for software, too. The expectation of the entire toolset is lowered from the beginning.\nchmod: cannot access 'config.guess': No such file or directory\nchmod: cannot access 'config.rpath': No such file or directory\nchmod: cannot access 'config.status': No such file or directory\nchmod: cannot access 'config.sub': No such file or directory\nchmod: cannot access 'configure': No such file or directory\nchmod: cannot access 'depcomp': No such file or directory\nchmod: cannot access 'install-sh': No such file or directory\nchmod: cannot access 'missing': No such file or directory\nsrc/Makefile.am:137: warning: shell date +%s: non-POSIX variable name\nsrc/Makefile.am:137: (probably a GNU make extension)\nsrc/Makefile.am:139: warning: shell cd \"$(top_srcdir: non-POSIX variable name\nsrc/Makefile.am:139: (probably a GNU make extension)\nWhy is this GPL now?

So it called \"libtoolize\" (whatever that is)  but still tried to continue after it failed to locate it. Of course this did not work but for a user with no development experience he would never find out how to solve this. \nAfter that it automatically ran ./configure with tons of options we don't care at all. For example:\nchecking how to run the C++ preprocessor... g++ -E\nThis is a C source, not C++. Why is this check done at all? Can't we disable it?\nFinally it finished and I'm ending up with a mess created by tons of files that I have no clue what they are doing. None of these files existed before:\nAUTHORS\n    COPYING\n    ChangeLog\n    INSTALL\n    Makefile.am\n    Makefile.in\n    NEWS\n    aclocal.m4\n    ar-lib\n    autoclean.sh\n    autogen.sh\n    autom4te.cache/\n    compile\n    config.guess\n    config.h\n    config.h.in\n    config.h.in~\n    config.status\n    config.sub\n    configure\n    configure.ac\n    depcomp\n    hashcat-3.3.0.tar.gz\n    install-sh\n    libtool\n    ltmain.sh\n    missing\n    src/.deps/\n    src/Makefile.am\n    src/Makefile.in\n    src/libhashcat.pc\n    src/libhashcat.pc.in\n    src/lzma_sdk/.deps/\n    stamp-h1\nThis is ugly and confusing. Whenever there's a problem with it, I wouldn't even know where to start looking.\nI see that you tried to generate some sort of auto-documentation, but I'm really not a fan of this. Auto-generated documentation out of git's log can not be trusted because we can not force a good documentation of the changes verified from a technical system (git). Therefore changes should always be hand-written.\nI think there's also a misunderstanding of the package distribution. The script tools/package.sh is the one script which creates the files for distribution of Linux and Windows binaries. Especially Windows binaries. But there's no windows binary in the final package hashcat-3.3.0.tar.gz. With our hand writte Makefile we call \"make binaries\" to compile them using mingw GCC. But I do not see a single use of the substring \"mingw\" in autogenerated src/Makefile so there's defenitly a major feature missing. Does autoconf stuff even support cross compiler?\nI see some files/notices that references hashcat v3.3.0. We call that v3.30 but mean the same. We maybe change this to v3.3.0 notation in a later version.\nFinally I still don't see the need of all this. With our hand-written Makefile all the feature we want are working fine. There's no warnings, no errors and it works on multiple systems. Maybe not all but at least on such where the device drivers come with a working OpenCL runtime. All the others are not useable for us anyway?!\n. With my comment I hoped you maybe can convince me why it makes sense to replace our really good working hand-written Makefile with autoconf. The argument \"do some experience of packing binaries for various distributions(rpm,apt,pacman) if not sure.\" reads like \"because everyone is doing it\" which is something I don't care much about. Plus the Makefile as it is right now works pretty well for them. There's packages for many Linux distributions, even FreeBSD. \nAt this time I don't see why we should switch to autoconf and therefore I will close this PR. I'm not saying we'll never switch, but at this time I'm simply not convinced.\n@yhfudev @stephengroat I would like to thanks for your work involved. I just hope that rejecting this PR will not stop you from contributing to hashcat.. Thanks!. Thanks for PR! From what I've seen I think it's no longer required to do this:\n```\ninclude \ninclude \n```\nin both pidfile.h and restore.h. I think we can remove them. What you think?. It's hard to tell what the error is coming from. It looks like the AMDGPU OpenCL runtime but we need to be sure about that. Since I can not reproduce this locally with AMDGPU-Pro on Ubuntu 16.04, please create the following view for me on your system:\nmake clean\ngit pull\nmake DEBUG=1\ngdb --args ./hashcat -t 32 -a 7 example0.hash ?a?a?a?a example.dict\nafter that type \"r\" to start the gdb run... after the crash occurs type \"bt\" (for backtrack). You can exit gdb by typing \"q\" and \"yes\".\n. Note that this is intentional. AMDGPU-Pro is partially broken, the best AMDGPU-Pro is still 16.40. Details here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6242-post-33291.html#pid33291. Right, see here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#what_is_the_maximum_supported_password_length\nAlso note that passwords with static components are better added as salts so that only the variable part of it is actualyl the password. In such a case, the password can be much longer than 64, theoretically unlimited, but it requries to write a special hash-mode for it.. I can not reproduce this on my 4x1080 box. Maybe it's because I'm running them on Ubuntu 16.04. Can you please try to reproduce this issue with Ubuntu 16.04? If it occur on there, too, maybe it's a local hardware problem. Your PCI-E lane configuration looks kind of weird and made me think that.. No response from OP after long time, therefore closing the issue. Feel free to reopen if needed.. hashcat tells me:\nHashfile 'NETGEAR68.hccapx': Invalid hccapx version\nMaybe you're using the old hccapx version 3.

Yeah but that's ok because most of the time you don't really crack something. Also this is a fixed time added for each crack.

It cracks the first hash much sooner, that's right, but in the end both were cracked. \n```\nroot@et:~/xy/hashcat-3.40# ./hashcat64.bin -m 2500 test_new.hccapx -a 3 ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d -w 3\nhashcat (v3.40) starting...\nOpenCL Platform #1: NVIDIA Corporation\n\nDevice #1: GeForce GTX 1080, 2026/8107 MB allocatable, 20MCU\nDevice #2: GeForce GTX 1080, 2028/8114 MB allocatable, 20MCU\nDevice #3: GeForce GTX 1080, 2028/8114 MB allocatable, 20MCU\nDevice #4: GeForce GTX 1080, 2028/8114 MB allocatable, 20MCU\n\nOpenCL Platform #2: Intel(R) Corporation\n\nDevice #5: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz, skipped\n\nHashes: 2 digests; 2 unique digests, 2 unique salts\nBitmaps: 16 bits, 65536 entries, 0x0000ffff mask, 262144 bytes, 5/13 rotates\nApplicable Optimizers:\n Zero-Byte\n Brute-Force\n* Slow-Hash-SIMD\nWatchdog: Temperature abort trigger set to 90c\nWatchdog: Temperature retain trigger set to 75c\n3bc509f17d95e2fc515244b1a1c15003:4cf2bf2a4c94:44636afbbe9e:WiFi-29:00000995\n[s]tatus [p]ause [r]esume [b]ypass [c]heckpoint [q]uit => s\nSession..........: hashcat\nStatus...........: Running\nHash.Type........: WPA/WPA2\nHash.Target......: test_new.hccapx\nTime.Started.....: Tue Mar  7 08:42:19 2017 (28 secs)\nTime.Estimated...: Tue Mar  7 08:43:11 2017 (24 secs)\nInput.Mask.......: ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d [8]\nInput.Queue......: 1/1 (100.00%)\nSpeed.Dev.#1.....:   717.0 kH/s (96.09ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#2.....:   645.6 kH/s (51.03ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#3.....:   718.9 kH/s (94.78ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#4.....:   694.4 kH/s (95.27ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#*.....:  2775.9 kH/s\nRecovered........: 1/2 (50.00%) Digests, 1/2 (50.00%) Salts\nProgress.........: 80773120/200000000 (40.39%)\nRejected.........: 0/80773120 (0.00%)\nRestore.Point....: 819200/10000000 (8.19%)\nCandidates.#1....: 02185695 -> 06175027\nCandidates.#2....: 62630196 -> 66194796\nCandidates.#3....: 42194796 -> 46147432\nCandidates.#4....: 12147432 -> 16185695\nHWMon.Dev.#1.....: Temp: 54c Fan: 33% Util:100% Core:1809MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\nHWMon.Dev.#2.....: Temp: 59c Fan: 33% Util: 99% Core:1797MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\nHWMon.Dev.#3.....: Temp: 54c Fan: 33% Util:100% Core:1822MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\nHWMon.Dev.#4.....: Temp: 60c Fan: 33% Util:100% Core:1809MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\nINFO: approaching final keyspace, workload adjusted       \n62c53e18a34a39ea1a5f6f417709c20a:4cf2bf2a4c94:44636afbbe9e:WiFi-29:00000994\nSession..........: hashcat\nStatus...........: Cracked\nHash.Type........: WPA/WPA2\nHash.Target......: test_new.hccapx\nTime.Started.....: Tue Mar  7 08:42:19 2017 (57 secs)\nTime.Estimated...: Tue Mar  7 08:43:16 2017 (0 secs)\nInput.Mask.......: ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d [8]\nInput.Queue......: 1/1 (100.00%)\nSpeed.Dev.#1.....:   559.9 kH/s (73.69ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#2.....:   519.7 kH/s (51.69ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#3.....:   549.9 kH/s (77.40ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#4.....:   546.9 kH/s (97.24ms)\nSpeed.Dev.#*.....:  2176.4 kH/s\nRecovered........: 2/2 (100.00%) Digests, 2/2 (100.00%) Salts\nProgress.........: 164374720/200000000 (82.19%)\nRejected.........: 0/164374720 (0.00%)\nRestore.Point....: 3768320/10000000 (37.68%)\nCandidates.#1....: 72851946 -> 76309217\nCandidates.#2....: 82175027 -> 86901635\nCandidates.#3....: 02689217 -> 06691484\nCandidates.#4....: 02801635 -> 06921946\nHWMon.Dev.#1.....: Temp: 64c Fan: 33% Util:100% Core:1784MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\nHWMon.Dev.#2.....: Temp: 69c Fan: 33% Util:100% Core:1771MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\nHWMon.Dev.#3.....: Temp: 63c Fan: 33% Util:100% Core:1797MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\nHWMon.Dev.#4.....: Temp: 70c Fan: 38% Util:100% Core:1771MHz Mem:4513MHz Lanes:1\n```\nPlease post hashcat -I and the full commandline you're using. Maybe I then have better chances to reproduce.. Note I've just updated some of the WPA handling with this commit: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/33a043ec63e65c5a497a73100d7243eda040fb86\nThere's also a precompiled beta on here: https://hashcat.net/beta/\nPlease retry with this latest version. Thanks for reporting. As @philsmd already mentioned, this is kind of irrelevant for users. It's only part of the potfile because it's required to mark the right handshakes as cracked when hashcat is starting up or in case the user uses --show or --left. However from a user perspective it shouldn't be important. The hash bases on MD5, but it's no a true MD5 because for our usecase it's good enough as it is now. If you really need to copy the procedure, simply copy the code out of interface.c and save yourself alot of headache.. The most important question: Where is it used in?. It's working as expected, see here:\nRejected.........: 1/1 (100.00%)\nYour input word was < length 8, so it's rejected because of WPA minimum length 8. If you want the behaviour the different way, like after rule to check apply to check for length 8 you need to use a pipe and run the first hashcat instance in --stdout mode.. The more modifier you use, the longer it takes to reach a checkpoint. That's true for both fast and slow hashes.. Looks legit to me, if the keyspace is too small then the speed drops. I'm sorry but since you did not add any additional information to clarify the situation there's nothing we can do.. Thanks, makes this easier to read. I'm not 100% certain, but the command \"-p *\" might cause your shell to incorrectly expand the command to something different and results in creating stuff like \"docs\" and \"charset\" to be a treated as a hashlist. Opening a folder as a file sometimes creates that typical invalid error message \"Permission denied\" produced by windows, which then leads to the false assumption this is something related to filesystem ACL's. IOW, remove the -p parameter and try again.\n. OP not responding plus I'm kind of sure it the problem is the -p usage error, therefore closing. Feel free to reopen if that wasn't the case.. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/963a9772ba532f8c6895a342ea443efd27f5b1a2\nThanks for reporting!. Please use something like: \ncat folder/*.rule > mega.rule\n. > It would be really beneficial to have an option to test commands (e.g. --test) and/or hashes instead of waiting for exception to be raised.\nHashcat is not starting up in case there's fundamental errors.\n\n\nChecking for existence and permissions of all required files and directories (both the ones specified on the command line, and the default/assumed ones)\n\n\nMaybe you missed it, but that already happend with hashcat v3.40: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/docs/changes.txt#L115\n\n\nWhether or not the combinations of command line options and flags are compatible and sane\n\n\nAlready done on startup\n\n\nWhether or not the hashes in the file are the expected length and composition (I would like to have the default behavior be that as soon as a single hash is seen as obviously incorrect, the entire run aborts instead of trying to continue to load them all, and to have this check happen quickly up front instead of after all hashes are loaded, deduped, sorted, etc.)\n\n\nAlready done on startup\n\n\nIt would also be useful for an early rough guess for resources on the target platform.\n\n\nAlready done on startup\n\nTBH issues like this make me really angry. . Feel free to provide some example where hashcat can do something better and reopen the issue. No sorry, that would look kind of bloated. We already had such options in the past (not exactly those, but similar) to shutdown hashcat in case XY occurs and made some experience with them. They were mostly based on cracks-per-time but also time in general. It turned out that such options make sense only for a very few cases, like cracking LI or other mass data. In the real life when we only have to crack a single TrueCrypt volume it created more problems because users misused the flags. It raised lots of support questions that we wouldn't have to deal with if there are no such options, therefore we dropped them.. No response from OP after long time, therefore closing the issue. Feel free to reopen if needed.. I can see the problem with -a bogus (which atoi() translates to 0), but I can not reproduce the case with -a 9:\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 100 -a 9 hash.txt\nInvalid attack-mode specified. Double post, please use: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/371. I've pushed this with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/6d66ff96c16992d32aa7fedc51e9b0cdf7ed19ae\nI've also remove 2x \".\" from the status labels, otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to compress the hash to length 79 and the HWmon line is still at 81.\nI've written a special function to do the compress in case we want to use it on a different place, too.\nPlease close the issue if fixed. I can only agree, very good description. If only all requests would look like that. Please test the implementation and close the issue if fixed.. Sounds like a complete misuse of hashcat. If you want to see only cracked hashes, use an outfile. If you need it as a stream, run tail -f on it. About the issue itself, I'll add an exception for special devices like /dev/null for outfiles.. Changed with commit: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/c3e118f5ea1a67b6cf28db278ef0d86362d101da\nPlease close the issue if fixed. Thanks for reporting!. OpenCL installation error. Please ask on forum or see here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do. Style is acceptable. I've also added the short links to nginx.conf. Thanks!. While I was trying to implement this I've run into two major problems that needs to be discussed first. \n\n\nThe first problem is that hashcat is also available as a library. That means after executing hashcat_init() (done only one time) there is an unknown number of subsequent calls to hashcat_session_init() following. Reason here is because the hashcat_init() initializes the for example the OpenCL subsystem which doesn't change while the calling process lives, but it can also take some time to initialize, depending on the devices and runtimes. The main time is of course the hashcat_session_init() but I wanted to show that there's different layer types that both can create some time to execute but the given example output does not reflect that.\n\n\nThe second problem is that hashcat (both binary and library) support Queues that are used whenever the user chooses wordlist folders, mask files, the -i switch, etc. This adds another 4 more layers to the system (init, outer loop, inner loop 1, inner loop 2). Each of those layers can call time consuming functions. For example the outer loop initializes the hashes itself and everything that depends on the hashes like potfile comparisons and bitmaps, OpenCL kernels and weak hash check. in inner loop2 it runs the autotune and the final cracking loop. The given example output does not reflect that as well.\n\n\nAnd then there's another minor question: Do we want to export the values to hashcat_status_t or just to status_ctx_t? The hashcat_status_t is the \"normalized\" structure that can be used from the user API but it really creates more work.\n@roycewilliams The original request needs to be rewritten with respect due to the different layers. Any Idea?. I think @philsmd explained what to do. Since it turned out to be a usage issue and not a bug, please continue the discussion on hashcat forum. Github issues is only for bugs and feature requests.. Why run hashcat as binary, call the library instead.. There's no documentation in text form, but there's two examples in code. The first one that the hashcat binary itself is using the library, therefore everything the binary can do can be done from your application, too. See the main.c file for details and set the SHARED variable in Makefile. The other example is pyhashcat here: https://github.com/Rich5/pyHashcat. Many thanks!.

You can debug a kernel using printf() in case you have a nvidia GPU.\nThere's a few things you should do additionally:\n\n\nSet DEBUG mode to 1 in Makefile\n\n\nRun you test with -u1 -n1 --force (this is a special condition that\nwill disable the autotuner which otherwise would confuse printf output)\n\n\nAdditionally use -d 1 in case you have multiple GPU\n\n\nUse --weak-hash-check 0 (also to reduce confusion of printf output)\n\n\nIn case you have an AMD GPU you need need to force hashcat to use the\nJiT kernel without caching, otherwise printf() fails.

If that's the case, then the hash format need to have each salt somehow stored along with each hash. From your example hash, it doesn't seem to do so. \n\nOTOH, hashcats hash formats/encoding traditionally tries to stay compatible to jtrs. Since jtr already supports blake2b we should make the format 1:1 to the the one from jtr. That will also give a good inspiration about how to configure the different blake2b features (per hash).\nHere are some more things that looks suspicious in your code:\n\nThis can not be true if the hash is salted: \n\nhashconfig->salt_type      = SALT_TYPE_NONE;\n\nThis function seem to be just byte swaps:\n\nu64 load64(const void *src)\nu64 load64_reverse(const void *src)\nThere's swap64() in OpenCL/inc_common.h maybe you find a way to simply replace them with our functions.\n\nTry to avoid void * in the kernel, that is compatible to all OpenCL runtimes:\n\nu64 load64(const void *src)\n\nThis function seem is simple bit rotate:\n\n+u64 rotr64_w(const u64x w, const u32 c)\nWe already have rotr64() in the types.h. Please try to replace it, too.\nAbout your questions:\n\nFinally, a quick description of m04, m08 and m16 funcs ? Do they relate to different input dimensions or kernel threads dimensions ?\n\nthe \"m\" stands for multiple hashes, where \"s\" stands for single hash. With a single hash, we can do a single integer comparison at the end ofthe kernel, while with \"m\" the kernel has to run through a bloom filter and some binary tree. For you it's not so important, it basically the same code, but because of performance reasons it's not implemented in form of a branch. Just take a look at any other fast hash kernel, for example md5. The only different is that you do not have a search[] array and the COMPARE_S_SIMD() is replaced with COMPARE_M_SIMD().\n\nAlso, I am using the right params for the right kernel purpose or did I hack something in a useless way ? (I am not talking about optimizing my own code, but rather if I am using the right kernel parameters/macros/structs/functions.).\n\nI can't say too much about that as long as you do not full make use of the blake2 features because this changes some stuff in the code, you will find out when you do.\nAlso feel free to join #hashcat on freenode in case you need direct help. Please get test.sh and test.pl working first, it's important for tests\nOn 23.04.2017 14:22, DoZ10 wrote:\n\nOkay there is a problem with test.pl... will have to fix this first.\nIf anything else to look at comes to mind, please let me know.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1226#issuecomment-296439564,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJ83OUhTp-z3tTcpM2fWwOppCQCTmIYDks5ry0KcgaJpZM4M-qXQ.\n\n\n. I can't check the test.pl unless the conflict is resolved. However, here's at least one odd thing i saw by watching the source:\nblake2b_compress(pw, pw_len, digest);\npw_len should be out_len for -a 0 kernel.\n. I've tested all modes (0, 1, 3, 6, 7) and they seem to work fine on the tested systems:\n\nnv 750ti\namd rx 480\namd r9 290x\n\nSome notes:\n\nIt would be nice to have a blake2b_transform function for _a0 and _a1 instead of having the code embedded into the most inner loop. reason here is that we need it in case we need to transport it to a new hash mode (one that is using blake2 interal, ex: pbkdf2-hmac-blake2b) -- Ignore this it already exist!\nFor this reason (1) it would be nice to have the salt and pepper supported by the function. Even for mode 600 we should use this function without suffering for performance drop, because the compiler are clever enough to recognize that the \"faked\" initial buffer we are all set to zero.\nI've noted that you use the vector-datatypes for the blake2b_state structure only in hash mode 0, but not in mode 1 and 3, example: --> u64x h[8]; in a0, u64 h[8]; in a1\nThe same for the blake2b_param struct, but here it makes sense, because we always handle the same salt within a single call of the kernel and therefore3 the parameters must be the same for all password candidates. therefore you should switch those to the scalar types, not the vector types\nFor performance reason you can try to move the blake2b_sigma[] array into the inner kernel as fixed data block, maybe it gives you a performance increase\nplease unroll the following section and do the assigns by hand:\n\nS->h[i] ^= *((u64x*)(p + sizeof(S->h[i]) * i));\n\nP->digest_length seems to be unused. I'm not familar with blake2b, is this some kind of feature like it is in pbkdf2 where you can specify a desired output length? However it seems not to be used, maybe you want to create blake2b_param_optimized structure instead and remove all the unneccessary elements\nIf you do not use a structure to hold the state but only the elements from it as single integer arrays you help the compiler because it does not require to hold the data in that particular order, its faster\nFor our source code convention, please replace code like this:\n\nu32 i;\n  ...\n  for (i = 0; i < 8; ++i)\nwith this:\nfor (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)\nIt's easier to read\n\nThis one looks suspicious:\n\nm[i] = swap32(pw[i * 2]);\n    m[i] <<= 32;\n    m[i] |= swap32(pw[i * 2 + 1]);\nI guess what you want to use instead is this:\nhl32_to_64() see OpenCL/inc_types.h\n\nPlease unroll this section by hand:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 8; ++i)\n    v[i] = S->h[i];\nPlease do the above, then it will be easier for me to understand the code and to start debugging\n. If you take a look below, v[8] .. v[15] is initially set, too.\n```\nv[ 8] = blake2b_IV[0];\n v[ 9] = blake2b_IV[1];\n v[10] = blake2b_IV[2];\n v[11] = blake2b_IV[3];\n v[12] = blake2b_IV[4] ^ S->t[0];\n v[13] = blake2b_IV[5] ^ S->t[1];\n v[14] = blake2b_IV[6] ^ S->f[0];\n v[15] = blake2b_IV[7] ^ S->f[1];\n```\nIf everything is aligned in a picture-like format we have a clear visual\nrepresentation of how the algorithm organizes its data and how its\nstructured. This helps to better understand the algorithm in case we\nwant to optimize it afterwards\nOn 26.04.2017 10:27, magnum wrote:\n\n11.

Same for t[] and f[]\nWhat's the reason for having blake2 as cpu function? I mean it's good to have it, just wondering what's the background\nIn case we want to have Blake2-256, what do we need to change? Simply truncate the output or is it more complex?\nThis section in the parser:\n\nfor (u8 i = 0; i < sizeof(blake2_params_t); i++)\n    ((u8 *)S)[i] ^= ((u8 *)P)[i];\nIs it really required to use a cast here? I'd prefer to see each attribute xor in a single for () loop. This greatly helps understand why we do this because it propably shows which values are set to zero at this point.\n\nAs you can see here:\n\ncase   600: hashconfig->esalt_size = sizeof (blake2_state_t);   break;\n    case  2500: hashconfig->esalt_size = sizeof (wpa_t);            break;\nThe convention of the type is always XXX_t. Can you please rename blake2_state_t to blake2_t\n. 9. One more thing. When running the benchmarks it shows:\nHashtype: Blake2b\nBut shouldn't it be Blake2b-512 or so?\n.

For example here in usage.c it says:\n\n\"    600 | Blake2-512                                       | Raw Hash\",\nBut maybe this is not neccessary, I just don't know what's the difference between Blake2 and Blake2b. You have to decide.\n\nSome notes:\n\nI've tested with test.sh and it worked for me as well. I've tested with AMD, NV and Intel. \nI've also added a default hash to wiki example hashes.\nThis is really great work!\n. I was playing a bit with the data you provided. Some notes:\n\nThe example hash \"$ethereum$p262144ae3cd4e7013836...\" provided does not crack with password \"testpassword\", at least not with JtR's mode (latest github master).\nThe AES part is not needed at all, neither in PBKDF2 nor in SCRYPT mode\nWe will need to rewrite the keccak GPU implementation to get this to work\n\nBy assuming the keccak part will be so fast that it doesn't change the cracking speed, the only relevant slowdown is the PBKDF2. I've tested this to run to approx. 4430 H/s on a single GTX1080. I was playing a bit with the data you provided. Some notes:\n\n\nThe AES part is not needed at all, neither in PBKDF2 nor in SCRYPT mode\n\nWe will need to rewrite the keccak GPU implementation to get this to work\nGPU's will not be able to crack this because of the memory requirement. Math behind: Mem per candidate: size_scrypt = (128 * scrypt_r) * scrypt_N = 256MB. But to make use of the GPU power, we need to spawn at least 1280 parallel computations, so we end up with a memory requirement of 320GB ram per GPU. It would require a minimum of a 256 divisions TMTO to get it working on a GTX1080, which drops the performance < 1 H/s.\nCPU cracking will run fine, tho. By assuming the keccak part will be so fast that it doesn't change the cracking speed, the only relevant slowdown is the SCRYPT. I've tested this to run to approx. 12-13 H/s on my 4770k. That is ~20% faster than JtRs native SCRYPT CPU code.\n. Yes\n\nAm 03.06.2017 4:20 nachm. schrieb \"ethtester\" notifications@github.com:\n\n@jsteube https://github.com/jsteube Thanks for the update.

Yes. Note that Ethereum default is 256k:1:8 and not 256k:8:1. That may explain the difference between 17H/s and 13H/s. When I run JtR against a 1k Wordlist on my 4770k it takes 1m22s with 256k:1:8, but 1m12s with 256k:8:1. So that would be \"only\" 12H/s but there's some startup time involved that should be subtracted so I think 13H/s is correct for JtR. Also note that I am using MPI (mpirun -n 8) - not OpenMP. From my experience with JtR, MPI gives the best performance (it may be different with SCRYPT based algorithms). As a comparison, hashcat takes 1m18s to process the same system, same wordlist and the same hash. That is almost on par with JtR performance. \n\nThe reason why I wrote hashcat was ~20% (it was actually ~40% but I didn't want to overact because it was not fully finished) is because I compared hashcat performance when I was in the middle of the development and compared only the SCRYPT part but without the surrounding PBKDF2 and the Keccak round. From my perspective that was ok, because on GPU the PBKDF2 in SCRYPT (and in this case also including the raw Keccak round) take about no time compared to the SCRYPT part, I didn't even come on the idea it will be different on CPU. The same list was processed in only 57s. I think the large data part (1k of data) is it that bloats up the PBKDF2 around the SCRYPT.. There's too many unknown factors to make an estimation.. Yeah but then where's the advantage to cracking on CPU? The GPU is faster only because there's so many \"small\" CPU that can run in parallel.. Do you think we need to update parser code? /cc @Chick3nman. OK, please create a separate issue for this. That is because GPU are fast only when utilizing all of it's compute hardware in parallel. For todays AMD and NV GPU that is 64 threads per compute unit. For the GTX1080 example above: 1280 / 64 = 20, which is the number of compute units on a GTX1080. You can exchange this number with the number of compute units on your GPU. An alternative to this would be to not fulfil the threads minimum per compute unit but then you'd end up with an almost equal number of parallel computations as you have it on a CPU (my Ryzen 1700 for example shows 16 CPUs cores) and the advantage of a GPU is gone. Even worse since a CPU has much more advanced instructions that a GPU compute unit.. works fine for me:\nroot@et:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 15700 hash.txt -a 3 'P@ssw0rd1!' --quiet -D1 --self-test-disable\n$ethereum$s*1024*8*1*437964c9bd1b5f63bde56560808c894792f8f670694590b776e22381e32dd33b*7f5c865554d67604394ae54d7a4f9735bdb85c90e606a672d18add1d167d793b*96f2a849321cc04cb6c0fcee1bd4b195ca681ca28064dc45000f02e47230c5b6:P@ssw0rd1!\nroot@et:~/hashcat#. Should be fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a93a143d1e2820e2fae5da11e4a9b3292d09e690\nPlease close if fixed. Thanks for reporting!. As @roycewilliams explained, this is a question for hashcat forums.. Yes that's a feature, it's actually the only feature why there's 9820 at all. The goal is to find as many colliding passwords as possible to use them for reuse cases. That's why it's never stopping once it has found a collision. I think what you're looking for is simply -m 9800. I tried on linux with all kind of strange utf-8 characters, seems to works. So it's perhaps the zero byte in the utf-16 causing the problems.. Since windows installations do not make use of \"make install\" we can switch back on windows to relative paths. I've pushed a fix for this issue with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/8ec2af97ed6adeae0dab0cb479f13cdf3e2b0031\nI've also add a new beta to https://hashcat.net/beta/\nPlease test if the issue is fixed and close it. Thanks!. Nice, IIRC, the first contribution that adds a new rule function. Thanks!. IOS 10 needs 40,000,000 calls to sha1_transform and then followed by another 40,000 calls to sha1_transform. \nTo get 2348 H/s it means your CPU would need to do 94,013,920,000 H/s on raw sha1 which I find impossible.\nIt's much more likely what @roycewilliams commented, here's a benchmark of older IOS on CPU:\n```\n* Device #5: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz, 3999/15998 MB allocatable, 8MCU\nHashtype: iTunes backup < 10.0\nSpeed.Dev.#5.....:     5480 H/s (74.28ms)\n```\n@recon-ng There's no way to improve the attack as it is now, because it's simply PBKDF2 and we already have optimized it to the maximum. It's more likely the attack you're linking to does not use that PBKDF2 step2 and in this case we'd need what to do else and create a new hash mode. However, as @magnumripper mentioned, that bug is already fixed in IOS 10.1 so it wont help us much. \nFinally, we have to live with how stuff is.. Again, great contributions! Many thanks so far! Here are some comments:\n\nkernel code quality is very good, but maybe add some \"salt\" section to the initialization code by simply commenting it\n\n+  u32 iv[2]    = { 0 };\n+  u32 plain[2] = { 0 };\n+  u32 position[2] = { 0 };\n+ \n+  position[0] = esalt_bufs->position[0];\n+  position[1] = esalt_bufs->position[1];\n+\n+  u32 plain_length = esalt_bufs->plain_length;\n+\n+  iv[0] = esalt_bufs->iv[0];\n+  iv[1] = esalt_bufs->iv[1];\n+\n+  plain[0] = esalt_bufs->plain[0];\n+  plain[1] = esalt_bufs->plain[1];\n\n\nWhat's the reason to have a \"plain_length\" in the esalt? Isn't this a block cipher?\n\n\nIn the chacha20_parse_hash(), can you add some length verification checks to ensure iv length is actually 16. The best way to accomplish that is by using the code as we do it, for example see the itunes_backup_parse_hash() function. You will find out pretty easily the pattern and you will see how we do the tests for length.\n\n\nThe algorithm makes use of an esalt, but misses to set an artificial salt. While this is not a technical requirement, it's more a requirement of hashcat itself. In order to help hashcat to identify duplicate salts we have to create a unique (artificial) salt for each unique esalt. See pstoken_parse_hash() for example. I think it would be fine simply to copy all data from the esalt data into salt_buf[] array and set the salt_length to 32 or so-\n\n\nMost important. Please do not use mode 670. Please use mode 15400 instead. \n. \n\nPlease replace this:\n\nfor (u8 i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\nwith this:\nfor (u8 i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n\nPrepend for() loops with a fixed iteration count with #pragma unroll\n\nfor (u8 i = 0; i < 10; i++)\nto:\n```\n  #pragma unroll\n  for (u8 i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n```\n\n\nDrop w2[] and w3[] in the inner loop, they are not accessed\n\n\nLoad the base word outside the inner loop, that saves accessing the slow global memory, ex:\n\n\noutside:\n```\n  u32 w0[4];\n  u32 w1[4];\nw0[0] = pws[gid].i[0];\n  w0[1] = pws[gid].i[1];\n  w0[2] = pws[gid].i[2];\n  w0[3] = pws[gid].i[3];\n  w1[0] = pws[gid].i[4];\n  w1[1] = pws[gid].i[5];\n  w1[2] = pws[gid].i[6];\n  w1[3] = pws[gid].i[7];\n```\ninside (replace):\n```\n    u32x w0_t[4];\n    u32x w1_t[4];\nw0_t[0] = w0x;\nw0_t[1] = w0[1];\nw0_t[2] = w0[2];\nw0_t[3] = w0[3];\nw1_t[0] = w1[0];\nw1_t[1] = w1[1];\nw1_t[2] = w1[2];\nw1_t[3] = w1[3];\n...\nchacha20_transform (w0_t, w1_t, position, offset, iv, plain, digest);\n\n```\n. \n1. There's still remainings of this in the single hash kernels. \nposition[0] = esalt_bufs->position[0];\n  position[1] = esalt_bufs->position[1];\nEven if this is always just \"0\" please rewrite it, too. That makes it easier to copy/paste. It will have no impact on performance.\nposition[0] = esalt_bufs[digests_offset].position[0];\n  position[1] = esalt_bufs[digests_offset].position[1];\n\n\nHash mode 15400 is missing in extra/tab_completion/hashcat.sh in HASH_MODES variable\n\n\nTry to use more \"const\" keywords whenever possible, for example:\n\n\nu32 index  = offset / 4;\n  u32 remain = offset % 4;\nto:\nconst u32 index  = offset / 4;\n  const u32 remain = offset % 4;\n\nPlease fix alignment for spaces:\n\nu32 iv[2]    = { 0 };\n  u32 plain[2] = { 0 };\n  u32 position[2] = { 0 };\n  u32 offset = 0;\n\nThose do not need to be u32x in the outer loop, u32 is fine and saves some register:\n\nu32x w0[4];\n  u32x w1[4];\n  u32x w2[4];\n  u32x w3[4];\n\nThe tmp variable can be u32, no need to u32x here:\n\nu32x tmp[3];\n. Great work again! Many thanks!. Nice work. This really looks interessting for the pentesting community. Here some comments:\n\nPlease do not use char in a shared structure datatype (shared between host code an GPU code). Please use only u8, u16, u32 and u64.\n\n+  char cipher_algo[16];\n+  char hash_algo[16];\nTry to replace with u8 also in ascii_digest ()\n\n\nNote that whenever you use u8, the performance drops massively as GPU do not have 8 bit registers as CPU have. That's why you should try to always use u32. If you can rewrite your code so that it does not need to work with u8 you will increase the performance alot.\n\n\nWhat is the reason to have the password (userKey[]) in the tmps variable?\n\n\n+  u32 userKey[5];\nIf possible, please remove that. You should be able to access the password from within _loop() and _comp() kernels the same way as in _init().\n\nPlease align the following code. I tried to do it for you but then saw that there's a value missing:\n\n+  DISPLAY_LEN_MIN_15300 =  1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 1 + 3 + 128,\n+  DISPLAY_LEN_MAX_15300 =  1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 32 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 512,\nto (please find the ? mark):\n+  DISPLAY_LEN_MIN_15300 =  1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +  10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 +  1 + 1 + 32 + 1 + 3 + ? + 128,\n+  DISPLAY_LEN_MAX_15300 =  1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 32 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 512,\n\nIn the dpapimk_parse_hash() section, please move all converter code below the parser code. So for example this:\n\n+  cipher_algo_pos = (u8 *) strchr ((const char *) SID_pos, '*');\n+\n+  if (cipher_algo_pos == NULL) return (PARSER_SEPARATOR_UNMATCHED);\n+\n+  for (int i = 0; i < cipher_algo_pos - SID_pos; i++)\n+    dpapimk->SID_tmp[i] = SID_pos[i];\n+  dpapimk->SID_tmp[cipher_algo_pos - SID_pos] = '\\0';\nShoudl be limited to :\n+  cipher_algo_pos = (u8 *) strchr ((const char *) SID_pos, '*');\n+\n+  if (cipher_algo_pos == NULL) return (PARSER_SEPARATOR_UNMATCHED);\nAnd later, once you have did all the parsing and testing (for correct length) code do the converts.\n\nArtifical salt section:\n\n+  salt->salt_buf[0] = dpapimk->iv[0];\n+  salt->salt_buf[1] = dpapimk->iv[1];\n+  salt->salt_buf[2] = dpapimk->iv[2];\n+  salt->salt_buf[3] = dpapimk->iv[3];\n+\n+  salt->salt_len = 32;\nThis could lead to problems (in case you had an invalid hash parser before). If you set only 16 byte, set the salt_len to 16, not 32. Or set really 32 byte in salt_buf[]\n\nPlease replace all occurances of '\\0' with simply 0\n\n. Great work, thanks!. @magnumripper do you know how to reproduce such an archive locally? How much was the speed drop?.

Make sure to have hashcat and your display driver in the latest version, then it should work.. Problem was already fixed + no response from OP, therefore closed. Thanks for your contributions. Please see my comments below:\n\n\nIn the changes.txt:\n\n+- Rules: Support added for position 'p'\nThis should be modified to reflect this change will work only for the CPU rule enging by using -j and -k, but not on GPU\n\nThe macro name convention:\n\n#define RULE_OP_REJECT_EQUAL_AT         '=' // reject plains that do not contain char X at position N\n #define RULE_OP_REJECT_CONTAINS         '%' // reject plains that contain char X less than N times\n #define RULE_OP_REJECT_MEMORY           'Q' // reject plains that match the plain saved (see M), i.e. if unchanged\n-\n+#define RULE_REJECT_SAVED_POS           'p' // position of the character last found with '/' or '%'\nI'm wondering if the \"REJECT\" substring is correct, or is it really working only for reject cases?\n. 1. OK\n2. OK. RULE_LAST_REJECTED_SAVED_POS sounds good to me. . Yes, there is, since hashcat can optimize the addition of the 0x80 stopbit by simply adding it to each word in the wordlist. This save the branch in the innerloop of the kernel. I've noticed there's fundamental different that should be added to test_rules.pl. That is simply the fact that rules never get rejected on GPU. For example this:\ninput: test\nrule: '6\nexpected CPU: \nexpected GPU: test\nAlso I'd suggest to remove all checks that use rules that are not supported on GPU (reason here is the above reason) like /, <, >, etc\n. The format with expected_host and expected_gpu is good, but I'd use the wording expected_cpu and expected_opencl here, because this matches it better. Also not listing expected_opencl  in case it's not supported is really nice. So I'd say go for it!\nNote that I'd use the tool without specifying a mode to it. This is kind of confusion and should be used only optional. If no mode is selected by the user, do \"the right thing\" ;). Thanks for your report!\nI'm not sure if this issue should be assigned to hashcat. The root of this problem goes back to how the OS handles the dlopen() function because it's this logic in this function (or even deeper) which handles the search paths for the libraries. So this is basically a question related to OS or maybe how drivers copy the libraries and to where, depending on how you see it.. The proposed workaround sounds simple enought to me, I'll add it. I've pushed a fix with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/bb2118a2906280b2c356c2b887c6a18cab98f5ba\nThere's also a new beta binary on https://hashcat.net/beta/\nPlease test the fix and close the issue if successfull. No response from OP but I think workaround is working. Nice tool, will try to find out if the reported errors are real errors or if we have to patch test_rules.pl script.. Use a distributing overlay like hashtopussy. Thanks for the contribtion, looks like a nice fix!

I think you're doing something wrong here. If you compile for Windows (on Windows by using MSYS2), you use the native makefile target. The windows target is only for cross compilation from linux which is used when I'm create the binary package for the site, which is not what you want. So simply use \"make\" without a target and it will not drop that error and you get the windows binary you're looking for.. I'm still getting errors when I run the script.

I think we discussed that often enought, it's working correctly. Words < length 8 get rejected because they do not match the WPA policy of being at least length 8. If you want your rules pre-processed, please use hashcats stdout and stdin features in combination by using a pipe.. Thanks fort reporting. This is an code snippet from @magnumripper - can you take a look please?. Thanks!. Exhausted is not an error. I know, but it's not a hashcat error, I've tested it. It cracked fine on my systems. Please fix your driver setup.. Just added self-test functionality. There's special code used in Office 2013 that differs from other algorithms but it's the kernel compiler who's responsible for creating the right byte code for the GPU out of it. This compiler is part of the drivers (one of the reasons why the GPU drivers are so huge these days). IOW: Just because all other algorithms worked but office 2013 doesn't mean it's not a driver issue. It is a driver issue!. I don't mind how it's written, as long everyone works with it afterwards. In case you want to change it again, please send in a PR, but do it fast because of the release on friday. I can see the problem, but tbh I don't like the fix. Can you please rewrite the code so that it matches the other parser functions? If you do, the problem will be fixed, too. See here for an example: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/interface.c#L14965-L15043. I've accidentially sent my response to @rhertzog directly, so here it is:\nThe reason why hashcat changed this version number is simply because it was wrong before. When I meant 3.40 I've actually meant 3.4.0. I simply didn't know something like \"Semantic Versioning\" existed at that time. IOW, this was a bug and I've fixed it.\nFrom my perspective the problem you have is the following: Your package management system interprets something into the version numbering, in this case that\"40\" is a number. But when I released 3.40 it wasn't meant as such, your system just expected it to be so. Basically the same that happens if you want to sort a textfile using \"sort\" of numbers but not use the \"-n\" switch. The conclusion, in my perspective, is that you're now asking me to fix an error that you (not you in person, but the system) made in the past.\nI'm willing to help you to solve the problem, but only as long it's not on the cost of confusing hashcat users. I've did that change to normalize the versioning with a standard that I think is accepted by a large community. Herein is the problem. If I change it, for example to v4.0.0, I'm afraid hashcat users would lose confidence in it. Such a change would be a violation of the \"Semantic Versioning\" standard because there's no major change in the code.\n. Should be fixed now, thanks! There's no commandline option to show the max password length supported, but a relative good wiki article where the max lengths are listed.. Latest version on github can crack passwords up to length 256 and salts (in this case the domain name) up to length 256, also in combination: https://pastebin.com/8HkttUpy. Is # a valid character as username? I don't feel like changing this is required otherwise.. Question for forum, not github issue. cudaHashcat is outdated, use hashcat.. It's not too hard too implement, but it takes a few hours. I'd like to see\nmore requests for it in here, first\nOn 28 June 2017 at 16:36, sergiolover notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nanything ?

Double Issue: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/293. Is the password always of length 16? I mean exactly 16? What if it password is length 15, does it need to be padded and if yes, which byte is used for padding?. I agree with @DoZ10 this is not really an algorithm that should be added to hashcat. Except your usecase  no one could make use of it. \n\nHowever I find the topic important, given the fact that it's used in a medical application. My question therefore would be, is a \"collision\" enough to exploit whatever type of issue you found or is it required to be the correct key?. @SandraK82 The magic \"service pwd\" is only 11 byte, including the 16 byte salt this makes 27. But your descriptions says 28 byte.. OK and what is the result? Because 07932f496a777a880b927b85b5b267a9 doesn't match.. hmac md5 of '736572766963652070776456d59e656abdc651294ab2afbbf21e0e' (in hex) with key 'u+5Fhz6G' = bec6cc8cafb4a5bd2750b8ccce274e63\nhmac sha1 of '736572766963652070776456d59e656abdc651294ab2afbbf21e0e' (in hex) with key 'w4j1Kkas' = 9e816ba5db708fd311a6830d9ffaf231\nbec6cc8cafb4a5bd2750b8ccce274e63 ^ 9e816ba5db708fd311a6830d9ffaf231 = 2047A72974C42A6E36F63BC151DDBC52. Indeed, it's double hmac! It worked now:\nb6c4fae33b7d5c2dcf843d4da0ce474b ^\nb157d5aa510a26a5c41646c8157c20e2 =\n07932f496a777a880b927b85b5b267a9\n. The reason why I was asking if a collision is \"ok\" was the following: What we can do is to precompute let's say a \"set\" of precomputed hashes (the SHA1 ones), but we're kind of limited in size here. I guess 10-50 million hashes max (means 10-50 million input candidates), depending on the GPU memory. This set can be used in multihash cracking mode as the salt is always the same. Now we can run the full 96^8 ascii charset against this list. On my 4*GTX1080 I expect this to run ~16 days. However, there's no guarantee it will crack at least one. But if not we can continue with another set that will run 16 days again, and so on.... Here's a patch that enables -m 50 to do the cracking:\n```\ndiff --git a/OpenCL/m00050_a3.cl b/OpenCL/m00050_a3.cl\nindex b5120e89..45af4de0 100644\n--- a/OpenCL/m00050_a3.cl\n+++ b/OpenCL/m00050_a3.cl\n@@ -296,6 +296,30 @@ void m00050m (u32 w0[4], u32 w1[4], u32 w2[4], u32 w3[4], const u32 pw_len, __gl\n hmac_md5_run (w0_t, w1_t, w2_t, w3_t, ipad, opad, digest);\n\n\nw0_t[0] = digest[0];\nw0_t[1] = digest[1];\nw0_t[2] = digest[2];\nw0_t[3] = digest[3];\nw1_t[0] = salt_buf0[0];\nw1_t[1] = salt_buf0[1];\nw1_t[2] = salt_buf0[2];\nw1_t[3] = salt_buf0[3];\nw2_t[0] = salt_buf1[0];\nw2_t[1] = salt_buf1[1];\nw2_t[2] = salt_buf1[2];\nw2_t[3] = salt_buf1[3];\nw3_t[0] = salt_buf2[0];\nw3_t[1] = salt_buf2[1];\nw3_t[2] = (64 + 16 + salt_len) * 8;\nw3_t[3] = 0;\n+\nhmac_md5_run (w0_t, w1_t, w2_t, w3_t, ipad, opad, digest);\n+\ndigest[0] ^= swap32 (0x07932f49);\ndigest[1] ^= swap32 (0x6a777a88);\ndigest[2] ^= swap32 (0x0b927b85);\n\ndigest[3] ^= swap32 (0xb5b267a9);\n+\n     COMPARE_M_SIMD (digest[0], digest[3], digest[2], digest[1]);\n   }\n }\n@@ -413,6 +437,30 @@ void m00050s (u32 w0[4], u32 w1[4], u32 w2[4], u32 w3[4], const u32 pw_len, __gl\nhmac_md5_run (w0_t, w1_t, w2_t, w3_t, ipad, opad, digest);\n\n\nw0_t[0] = digest[0];\n\nw0_t[1] = digest[1];\nw0_t[2] = digest[2];\nw0_t[3] = digest[3];\nw1_t[0] = salt_buf0[0];\nw1_t[1] = salt_buf0[1];\nw1_t[2] = salt_buf0[2];\nw1_t[3] = salt_buf0[3];\nw2_t[0] = salt_buf1[0];\nw2_t[1] = salt_buf1[1];\nw2_t[2] = salt_buf1[2];\nw2_t[3] = salt_buf1[3];\nw3_t[0] = salt_buf2[0];\nw3_t[1] = salt_buf2[1];\nw3_t[2] = (64 + 16 + salt_len) * 8;\nw3_t[3] = 0;\n+\nhmac_md5_run (w0_t, w1_t, w2_t, w3_t, ipad, opad, digest);\n+\ndigest[0] ^= swap32 (0x07932f49);\ndigest[1] ^= swap32 (0x6a777a88);\ndigest[2] ^= swap32 (0x0b927b85);\ndigest[3] ^= swap32 (0xb5b267a9);\n+\n     COMPARE_S_SIMD (digest[0], digest[3], digest[2], digest[1]);\n   }\n }\n```\n\nAnd here's a small perl program to precompute the SHA1 blocks:\n```\n!/usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Digest::MD5  qw (md5);\nuse Digest::SHA  qw (sha1);\nuse Digest::HMAC qw (hmac);\nmy $seed = \"service pwd\";\nmy $salt = \"56d59e656abdc651294ab2afbbf21e0e\";\nwhile (my $line = <>)\n{\n  $line =~ s/\\n$//;\n  $line =~ s/\\r$//;\nmy $final_salt = $seed . pack (\"H*\", $salt);\nmy $hash_buf1 = hmac ($final_salt, $line, \\&md5, 64);\nmy $hash_buf2 = hmac ($hash_buf1 . $final_salt, $line, \\&md5, 64);\nmy $hash_buf1 = hmac ($final_salt, $line, \\&sha1, 64);\n  my $hash_buf2 = hmac ($hash_buf1 . $final_salt, $line, \\&sha1, 64);\nprintf (\"%s:%s\\n\", unpack (\"H\", substr ($hash_buf2, 0, 16)), unpack (\"H\", $final_salt));\n}\nmd5:  b6c4fae33b7d5c2dcf843d4da0ce474b\nsha1: b157d5aa510a26a5c41646c8157c20e2\n```\nNote that I've inlined the final hash (the one we want to compare) into both kernels (single and multi hash) by simply XOR the result of the double MD5 HMAC with it, because it doesn't matter which way we use it... since it's XOR! This way we can use hashcats fast bitmaps and binary tree searching on device.\nThe perl program just takes every input on stdin and creates the hash out of it. You can use maskprocessor to create a full BF-stylish attack if you want to do that and pipe it to the perl program. The list that comes out is the hashlist to feed hashcat with.\nExample:\nroot@et:~/hashcat# echo 'w4j1Kkas' | perl dict2hash.pl \nb157d5aa510a26a5c41646c8157c20e2:736572766963652070776456d59e656abdc651294ab2afbbf21e0e\nroot@et:~/hashcat#\nroot@et:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 50 hash.txt --hex-salt -w 3 -a 3 'u+5Fhz6G' --quiet\nb157d5aa510a26a5c41646c8157c20e2:736572766963652070776456d59e656abdc651294ab2afbbf21e0e:u+5Fhz6G\nroot@et:~/hashcat#\nIt's important to use -a 3 and --hex-salt here.\n. I'm sure there's many such false positives, but merging it, it doesn't hurt. Thanks!. It's not about parity at all. Simply the fact that DES shifts each byte by one bit to the left, thus keyspace is 2^56 not 2^64.. The reason of the charset file is just to create a 2^56 keyspace that doesn't include any duplicates, but from a BF perspective the odds and evens are of no relevance.\nYou can freely change the odds and the evens in the charset file in your PR as long as the upper 7 bits (LE) of each byte do not change and the charset file stays at the same file size.. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1288. Thanks! I'll merge and afterwards move some of the files to a new folder, to avoid confusion.. Please retry with new github master version and make sure to have the kernels/ kernel cached removed first. Please retry with new github master version again and make sure to have the kernels/ kernel cached removed first. \nIt's really hard to debug this since this is some error only showing up on your system (I can't reproduce locally).. If you're on github master, is it possible you did miss to use the new -O parameter and therefore have the speed drop? \nThis could also solve the OPs problem because the problem here is not hashcat, it's the OpenCL driver/runtime for this particular device. Different vendors have different runtimes and therefore it works on some devices while on others it does not. We also have no influence on how the watchdog that causes this problem reacts from outside.. It's an Apple-only problem that I can not reproduce since I do not have such a device. Someone else need to find the root of the problem.\n. the issue should be fixed hopefully with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/bf112870a30e84e3e3f66b247e1de6333cd137ca\nplease test and close the issue if fixed. Can you please post -I output?. Looks like the Vendor ID is fixed. It was 214... before, see here: https://imgur.com/0dw8qm9 \nNow it is \"1\" as it should be.\nIn theory the speed should be fixed now. Make sure your installation is clean, all the cached OpenCL kernels are removed, you're using the right version, etc...\nIf that doesn't help we're back to zero. You maybe want to come to IRC so we can do some interactive debugging.\n. I've add some more code to change certain parameters, another shot in the dark, since I do not have access to that system and can not reproduce locally. Can you please pull master, recompile and retry again?. Please retry with latest github master version. It's important to run make clean this time.. Please redo the test with latest github master. Had to do some change because this workaround made other hash-modes no longer working. But with a bit of luck the latest changes lead to the same result.. Pull again and retry please, don't forget to rm -rf kernels. Can you please retry with the latest version from GitHub master?. File is too large, GitHub doesn't like it. It will also increase package size. Anyway, this is a great piece of resource. You should create some dedicated repository for it.. In the patch I've hacked the kernel and this results in a final digest which does not match the expected one. That's good it does that, because it tells us the self-test is working. If it cracks with my example data provided you can assume it's fine.. Try --self-test-disable . It will take time. Cracking so many salted hashes is very unusual (unliked unsalted hashes), because it's expected to be all different salts. If that would be the case, no one would do it. So it's a special behavior caused by a special use case.. There's already the same data in here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/interface.c#L25-L266\nIt would make more sense to just print this data on user request (--example-hashes or so) otherwise there'd be two separate places to maintain the same data.. Implemented with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/12d95fd22c7cab80e0e466946d5a3129eeb15b52. Fixed already, please pull latest master.. This is confusing. I just tried to crack it with both hashcat and jtr and both crack it. I was under the assumption that hashcat can not crack it because of the switched input data?. Closing the issue then. Feel free to reopen if needed.. Can't reproduce it locally on windows 7, same GPU, same driver. Please send all data I need to reproduce. I still can not understand how this would occur in -a 1, -a 6 and -a 7 mode. For -a 0 it's clear, that's just some missing feature which I haven't added, but it's giving me some real headache with -a 1, -a 6 and -a 7. Also I can not reproduce locally.. Please retry with latest version, I've also pushed a new binary beta to hashcat.net/beta. Latest version should support WPA2-PSK-SHA256-AES-CMAC with -m 2500. Please use wlancap2hcx to extract the hccapx for hashcat for testing. Please close the issue if it works. New beta up at https://hashcat.net/beta/. thanks!. Please change the order of the branch so that the test is testing a true case, not a false case. That makes it faster to read. \nThere's more options that can influence benchmark performance: -n, -u, --opencl-vector-width\nIf not set, they are handled by the tuning database. Great! Many thanks. Please post output of clinfo. Should be fixed with latest beta.. Appveyor still showing build failed. Is this safe to merge?. Thanks!.

The reading of $HEX[] strings from a wordlist is still supported in hashcat, but the output has changed.

This strongly depends on version, please retry with latest beta.. Rejecting as discussed. Where is it used in?. Please retry with latest beta version: https://hashcat.net/beta/.

Since I can't reproduce this I can't tell what the problem is.. No worries, you're right with the --help pattern error. We'll fix that, thanks!. Great! Thanks!. I'd think an ideal fix would be to limit the maximum allowed hashes. Cracking so many hashes at the same time really feels crazy.. Bug should be fixed with: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/35a24df55e27b06fae93c0c34f78560c6fc22fc0\nThis is how it was created:\ncase   100:  hashconfig->hash_type      = HASH_TYPE_SHA1;\n...\n                 hashconfig->dgst_size      = DGST_SIZE_4_5;\nDGST_SIZE_4_5  = (5  * sizeof (u32)), // 20\nSo when you have \nHashes: 250000000 digests; 249977448 unique digests, 1 unique salts\nIt does:\nsize_t size_digests = hashes->digests_cnt * hashconfig->dgst_size;\nThen this is: 249977448  * 20 = 4.999.548.960\nFinally:\nCL_rc = hc_clCreateBuffer (hashcat_ctx, device_param->context, CL_MEM_READ_ONLY,   size_digests,            NULL, &device_param->d_digests_buf);    \n    if (CL_rc == -1) return -1;\nThis is not causing an error, because of an integer overflow here:\nsize_t size_digests = hashes->digests_cnt * hashconfig->dgst_size;\nBoth operands are u32, so it should be:\nsize_t size_digests = (size_t) hashes->digests_cnt * (size_t) hashconfig->dgst_size;\nThat explains the behavior. Smaller numbers of hashes can create more confusion than larger ones because of the size_digests & 0xffffffff created by the integer overflow. Depending on the hash numbers, the overflow results in a value that was smaller than \n2028/8114 MB allocatable\nTherefore it didn't catch any memory allocation errors (even such on the host computer).\n. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/1644ac30b50f4cc5fc38762bf93a6913ab1d0030. I can't reproduce with the latest github version. You sure you're in the right current working directory when executing?. As you can see in your backtrace, it's libamdocl64.so, so it's a amdgpu-pro problem. This doesn't really surprise as amdgpu-pro is full of OpenCL bugs.. It depends on what you mean exactly. In current release version 3.6.0 this is not possible at all. In current github master version (or beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/) it is possible if you guess it right. That means for example if you know 60 positions for sure and just want to iterate through the unknown 4, then it works.. There's currently no way known to do that, therefore no software can do it.. Please post all files/commandline/etc we need to reproduce locally. I think the same, we would need to reproduce this locally. We have some testfiles for luks here: https://hashcat.net/misc/example_hashes/hashcat_luks_testfiles.7z\nYou can try with those files locally? . No response from OP, closing. You're right, the both -j and -k option do not support rule files, just single rules. That is because they are applied on host (not on device) while the wordlist is loading. Therefore the only option would be to re-run hashcat itself multiple times each time with a new rule, but that is basically what you're doing already with your script. The only advantage would be that hashcat itself does not need to be re-run and eventual large hashlists do not need to sorted again. But for hashlists with less than a million entries this is just a matter of seconds anyway.\nThe other option would be to allow rule files and apply them for each word in the wordlist while it is loading. That means before hashcat continues with the next word in the wordlist, apply each rule from the rulefile with the current one and push the output to the queue instead. The problem is that this creates a complex logic with rejects and with the wordlist cache database. To know about the ETA in the status view we need to know the total number of words in the wordlist on startup. That's why hashcat loads the wordlist on start, scans for number of words and caches this number. Now if you apply rules to it, this number becomes unknown because there's rules than can cause a reject of the word based on the word itself. For example if you use the rule >N to reject plains of length greater than N some words would be rejected and others are not. Therefore you can not simply take the total number of words from the wordlist and multiply it with the number of rules on start and you'd end up with an unknown ETA.\nSo the conclusion is that you have two solutions. One that always works and that only create a disadvantage under rare conditions and one that definitely causes a disadvantage plus it makes the program logic more complex.\n. If you use the latest hashcat version then hashcat is doing a self-test on startup on which it cracks a known hash with a known password. If this fails, it gives you a warning message. If you do not see this, something else with your input data is wrong.. @kureeoffsec It turns out that there's a problem with AMD OpenCL runtime on OSX which leads to invalid results. However, to compare it with other cracking tools you need to use -D 1 and eventually -O, since hashcat does not use CPU by default.. We're short to release of v4.0.0 please do a check with latest github version.. I've add some code to disable code caching, a shot in the dark. Can you please pull master, recompile and retry?. System was tested by someone else with a R9 M370X. Error did not occur. Therefore I'll close the issue, feel free to reopen if still exists.. Since hashcat has to dispatch the password candidates to different devices in order to make use of parallelisation it's possible that you have one device in which hashcat works as expected and another where it doesn't, for whatever reason. This processes is quasi-random because it's unknown which device gets the candidates first. If you select the device using -d 2 and -d 3 directly and you rerun the test, it's possible one device will always crack and the other never. Also note that John the ripper uses your CPU, you can do that on hashcat by using -D 1 (notice the upper case). On there, it should crack the same way. Please report back when you tried all 3 variants. That's consistent with the behavior of many AMD devices in OSX. Their OpenCL runtime is kind of broken. We can only hope ROCm will be ported to OSX soon ;). That's not exactly correct because there's also some AMD devices that work fine. \nThe Trap 6 is when the OSX kernel watchdog sees a GPU kernel to long running. But that's what we do here, computation. So desktop response is not so important, but the driver doesn't know that. It therefore kills the running kernel. The best way to avoid this is to hold the kernel runtime as low as possible. The user can do that by reducing the workload. That means if you set -w 1, the chances are good you're not running into Trap 6. However, this is again not a hashcat problem. On Linux and on Windows there's the same type of watchdog, but there's ways to turn it off. On OSX, there's no such option. If -w 1 doesn't work, you can also try -u 1 -n 1 --force.. You can increase those numbers and see if they have an influence in performance. Also note that you can always use -O and fall back to optimized kernels. This gives you a great advantage in performance and perhaps allows you to not use to be forced to use -n and -u. It may also allows you to use -d 3. Anyway, this not a hashcat problem, we should close the issue.. Perhaps. Also note that this wasn't known until now since most users that run hashcat use Linux and Windows. OTOH what if they fix the drivers in the future. Then we'd tell the user not to use device even if it works.. As discussed and verified by @hubert3 it turns out the error is not within hashcat but in AMD OpenCL runtime for OSX, therefore closing.. I'm not certain here, because I'm not convinced that this is not also PEBKAC in some way. We'd add some warning that is maybe not required. Also, since I do not own any apple devices, I also can't write a patch because I can't test. You'd need to send in a PR.. This format is horrible broken. Note that the github issue is only for feature requests and bug reports. Please ask on forum. Not a bug, everything is working as expected (even when not intuitional). Note that masks are split into two parts internally to give hashcat something to work as amplifier to overcome PCI-E bottleneck.. Can reproduce, thanks for reporting. There's so much details here that can make this more complicated than one might think of in the first place.  For example, is the out used as binary or as requested by the OP as ascii hex encoded string. If that's the case, should the hex encoding always be lower case or upper case, etc.. Therefore I don't like that Idea to have dynamic modes.. I tried to reproduce this using 2 netntlmv2 hashes in my hashlist. One of them will crack during the run with the first wordlist, the other one will never crack. Anyway, the bug popped not up in on my system so I think this must be related to something else. Try to reduce the variables to an absolute minimum, then pack all files together and send them to me so that I can reproduce locally.\nAbout that thing with $ in the username - that has no effect. The first line in your hash would just not be loaded from hashcat, it will tell you something about line length exception.. OP, please send me the files I need to reproduce. Is this really related to the hashlist? That would explain why I can not reproduce it, but otoh this is very unexpected. Please try with some different hashes. Please retry with latest version (make sure to run make clean when building from source). Do you use a network filesystem for your hashcat installation or your wordlist? Don't do that, it will break hashcat functionality. \nAlso do not edit or copy or save dictstat cache database files, this will cause errors of that type \"BUG pw_add\". Maybe you do that?\n. I've upload RC2 to hashcat.net/beta this should eventuelly fix both problems. Please try.. I think I found the issue finally. Fix was pushed with this: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/bfd3c57308c91de6e39e06fe1be4d05dfffa867d\nPlease retry with latest version from github or hashcat.net/beta (rc4) and close this issue if fixed. I've pushed https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/34c5eac5500dc921e50c7e6b3efcd7055b38726f in order to fix this. Can you please retry with latest version and close the issue if fixed? I can't test myself as you did not append an example header to reproduce.. It's on https://hashcat.net/beta/. Thanks for the files. I did a change to the veracrypt-pim handling. I hope it's fixed now. Please retry and close the issue if fixed.. Nice find, thanks!.

I've pushed a fix with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/7a278ef035fd061291062814541b1e6812890809 that could in theory create an overflow because max password length is no longer 64 (so it's less than the subtract 100), but now its 256. Please retry on your system as I do not run into this error (on Linux BUFSIZ is 8k, while on OSX its 1k).. Warnings are for GPU temperature control (fan etc). If you use --gpu-temp-disable  you should not see them anymore. The -m 9300 error isn't really one. Your device simply has too less memory (521977856). Make sure you're using latest hashcat beta, it includes some tricks to reduce memory required for SCRYPT based algorithms (for the cost of performance).. As the driver says, it's not supported. Just to be clear, this is not a hashcat problem, it's a driver installation problem.. Please try again on the same system without docker. GitHub issues are only for reporting bugs or feature requests. For usage questions please use the hashcat forum.. There's no official documentation about how to add a new algorithm to hashcat. I'd say find a similar algorithm in hashcat, then search for it in the source and write the new one accordingly.. It's a bit more complicated than that. However a github issue is the wrong place to ask for. This is only for bug reports and feature requests. Please use hashcat forum.. GitHub issues are for posting bugs and feature requests only. Please use hashcat forum for usage questsions please.. In theory that should be no problem. However I think it's the wrong approach. Using anything related to machine readable in combination with queued attack inputs doesn't fit together. Better run hashcat a several times but using only single attacks. Then you know the current mask. Another alternative would be to use the hashcat API, that gives you full control on everything. There's however no documentation on, but using main.c as reference in the perfect example because hashcat commandline frontend is basically just calling hashcat API functions.. I like the Idea, but can you please replace the calloc() with hccalloc() and add a note why we use calloc() inside the malloc() wrapper? This could be confusing otherwise.. It's not needed, that's right, but it also doesn't hurt.. I'll fix the missing free(). done https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1955. I think we should stay tolerant. Unless you use some kernel code that can not be cached (scrypt based, cisco $9$, descrypt, lm) there's no way to improve startup time, at least not in hashcat. It's not hashcat hanging, it's the OpenCL runtime.. This seems clear, since there's no m05000_a3.cl any longer (there's only m05000_a3-optimized.cl). It means that you did either ran make install but not make uninstall first. Or, if you installed manually, you did not remove /usr/local/share/hashcat but overwrote it.. rules which apply on device can be of arbitrary size, therefore they cannot be checked at this point. the correct use would be to use a pipe, like this:\nhashcat wordlist.txt -r rule.txst --stdout | hashcat -m 2500 your.hccapx\ni'm closing this because this is not a hashcat bug and github issues are only for bugs and feature requests. please use hashcat forum for usage questions.. It's fine, GPU needs much more work to assign at once than a CPU.. ultra outdated version, please use latest and reopen if not fixed. Oh yeah, you may want to check the commit logs of the last 4 month ;). That looks much better (no more segfault). Still, the package maintainer seem to have it installed incorrectly, therefore the error message is correct. Not a hashcat error, therefore closing.. You need to make sure that the realpath of argv[0] matches the INSTALL_FOLDER, otherwise hashcat looks for it's local content in the realpath folder. IOW, you need so fix the path in the Makefile (which is job of the package maintainer from my perspective).. where is it used in?. Can you please retry with -w 4 (this enables 256 threads instead of 32). Also make sure to use the latest github version, I changed it several times today.. Then it's unknown what causes this. We need to interactively debug this. Please come to IRC freenode channel #hashcat and PM me (atom).. I've eventually found the issue and added some code to handle it with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/2e85972ec55191d9050988571d3de29b8653e456\nPlease retry your test. please test and close the issue if fixed. Yeah and even if uintmax_t somewhere in the future becomes 128 bit, it would still work as expected. It's fine for me, thanks!. Somehow this breaks mingw cross compiled binaries on windows, result looks like this:\n* Device #2: GeForce GTX 980, ju/ju MB allocatable, 1024MCU\nTherefore have to revert the changes, sorry!. One does not simply do KPA on AES, it's more efficient to rebuild the KDF.. I can't say much on the SED_IN_PLACE behavior of macOS since I do not own a macOS compatible system.\nThe reason for VERSION_TAG being hardcoded is just temporarily due the RC phase and it will be switched back to the commented version when we do the release / normal work afterwards.. I think it depends on how much it breaks readability. If the changes done are minor I think we can live with a compromise. If you want, try to get as close as possible to original formating. We can then do a comparison and decide.. There's no up-to-date GUI. Also wrong channel, use hashcat forum.. Feel free to modify the output of the code. Shouldn't be too hard.. Added with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/9aa9725b9104702355465fb4a778c4ef8420a250. Problem is there are algorithms that are \"dangerous\" because they are very resource intensive. While not being a problem with systems with a modern GPU, with older ones they can stop the entire process. This is while the benchmark mode currently is \"limited. Anyway I like the idea of having to \"sets\" of benchmarks and we can reduce the current (default) one to a more limited selection.. So the complicated question here is, which mode is important enough to be in the default selection?\nWe need to discuss this with a larger audience, so let's use the forum for that:\nhttps://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6970.html\n. Added with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/1184ae1cddb3a1e801649b3f3ebda0b006c8de61. If you have a solution for the needed Makefile changes please send in a PR. Thanks!. A good question. I'd say go with the backport for now. Maybe I'll change my mind but currently I'd like to stay with 4.0.0.. but 4.0.1 fixed that already. Wordlists have to be local for ideal performance and to precalculate the ETA. It needs to know how many words are in the wordlist to do this, so it needs to have full access. The trick with wget seems nice, but needs a correction:\nwget -qO- http://example.com/list.txt | hashcat ...\nOtherwise it writes to file\n. Probably the --scrypt-tmto setting. Try values 1 to 8. Also note that's a thread difference between -w 3 and -w 4, so also try them. The kernel code itself wasn't changed (from 3.6) so it's somewhere in the default settings.. You're right, it's just PBKDF2. Forget what I said about the --scrypt-tmto. For PBKDF2 there's a change that enabled it to crack of passwords > length 32. However the -O is not required here, because PBKDF2 (the slow iteration part) is unchanged. That's why such a kernel is not implemented. There should be no performance loss, thus the confusion.. Yes, I'll close the issue. My recommendation is that you play around with the parameter -u, -n, --opencl-vector-width (try values 1,2,4,8) but always also set -w 4, because this let's the GPU access the high numbers of threads (but also large blocks of workload that lead to slower updates of restore checkpoints). It's a game of trade-off.. Can you please rephrase and in detail what this issue is about, I have no clue.. @magnumripper eventually relevant for jtr as well from rar_common.c \ncracked[index] = !memcmp(plain, \"\\xc4\\x3d\\x7b\\x00\\x40\\x07\\x00\", 7);\n. To fix this, we need to have rar2john to output the second 16 byte encrypted data in case $RAR3$0 is used.. I think yes, I'll just do both tests. Please send me output of clinfo, I need it for bugfix\n. Problem is here:\nDriver version:              2482.4 (PAL,HSAIL)\nHashcat thinks this is a ROCm installation and enables inline assembly. A good alternative would be to switch to ROCm (but afaik this also means switching to linux). You get some nice performance increase as reward.\nFor fixing this I hope AMD developer can support me, because currently I see no way to distinguish between \"normal\" AMD windows driver and ROCm. For amdgpu-pro there's no such problem, they do not have this substring.. These numbers are hard to get, because on Linux + Vega64 (my GPU) I can only use ROCm to run OpenCL. A good comparison would be to use Windows + official AMD drivers, but I don't have a Windows box with PCI3.0.\nI have this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xy0kkwB6Jkqo7CEprS-GtcUp3dZFWzV_FvZqWNHWmBM/edit#gid=785768233\nYou can compare it with your numbers from your Vega.\n. I've workaround the problem by disabling the check for ROCm on windows. Please retry with latest beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/ and give some feedback if it worked on your system. If positive, I'll push a 4.0.1 release.. There's many tools using exactly this architecture to protect some sort of data or to do some verification. For example TrueCrypt, LUKS, Office docs, RAR, etc. Hashcat maps a special hashmode to each of them. Same would be required for your software.\nSee here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this. Good stuff, thanks!. Benchmark looks good to me, speed is appropriate for PMK.. The performance of PMK version is mostly depending on how fast it is to copy data from host memory to GPU memory. If the GPU memory is shared with the host memory, there's almost no bottleneck. Therefore it's possible for slow GPU to be faster than a fast GPU.\nWPA PMK cracking is basically in no way faster than WPA cracking, because you still have to do the slow part. The only difference is that you can precompute the PMK for later use. That's useful if you're a pentester and you want to test a customers WPA and ask for the essid beforehand. So you can take the PMK with you while you're on site.\nTo understand how to precompute the PMK please ask on hcxtools page.. It's normal to have \"0\" here, because hashcat does not display floating point values only pure integers. So the speed is eventually somewhere between 0 and 1. If you run a true cracking task you should see the progress value increasing after some time. If it does, everything is fine. \nAlso note that using -b in combination with such a slow hash is bad because it utilizes -a 3 to do the benchmark. Using -a 3 in combination with -m 14800 is a really bad idea, therefore you should not use it. If you really need to use -a 3 for a real-life cracking task, you can use a pipe as a much better alternative like : \nhashcat -a 3 --stdout ?a?a?a | hashcat -m 14800 --status --status-timer 1 hash.txt\n. What's the reason for not changing atoi() in usage.c ?. I've merged it. Please retry with latest github master version. Please reopen if more informations are available. I see this is PIN only. For only PIN, it should be fast enough on CPU. What am I missing here?. I think we replaced the * to [] because of some recommendation of the coverity system. Can you make sure this change is ok? What are the variables creating the unused variable warnings?. OK, let's do the change and see if coverity complains again. For the other variables let's create a separate PR.. That's the way. It's supposed to have only a few candidates in this case, therefore it's not supposed to restore a piped session. You can however use the -s parameter directly on the first command.. Some things to notice is that:\n\nRemoving the default just for --show and --left would be hard to explain. If we do, it should be global.\nSome example scripts would be need to be patched, too (example0.cmd etc)\nRemoving the -m 0 default would also solve the missing default marker\nLot's of tutorials in the wild explain -m 0 to be the default (in case of critic on the change we can point to \"it's a new version\")\n\nThe \"Please specify a hashtype with -m.\" misses a hint on -h to get a list of all available modes\n. @roycewilliams feel free to send in a PR. There's three difference cases:\n\n\nIf the total data size to hash is larger than the blocksize of the hash (64 for SHA1), then the performance drops that many times by 100% as much of the blocksize fits into the total data size, where the last blocksize is also decreased by 9. For example a total data size of 55 creates 100% performance drop compared to 54.\n\n\nEach time you run sha1_update_* you create a branch caused by the switch() behind. GPU really do not like branches which creates a performance drop\n\n\nGPU do not have support for 8bit processing, therefore you can not do sha1_update_global_swap (\"foobar\"), you must use a 32 bit datatype array with the size of the hash blocksize, so W[16]. If you use an array smaller than that, the JiT creates buffer overruns that are not intercepted but create performance drops.\n\n\nAll cases can add up to create an even larger drop which is hard to predict. Howerver, this looks like a normal behavior, therefore closing issue\n. > Max length of $pass.$hash is >32, <64.\nWell that could be one (of multiple) reason, since 55 < 64\n\nI did try writing a new sha1_update_ function\n\nIt's already on the maximum of performance. The only way to improve performance is to workaround the call itself.\n\nBoth pass and salt are u32[64]\n\nIf you have 64 bit value the performance will drop massively since GPU are still 32 bit construct. There are no native 64 bit integers and they are just emulated by 2 times 32 bit integers. Typically this results in two or three times the number of instructions than on 32 bit values.. Invalid self-test message, fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/829ea605c514c457948a84487e7dbb51e18f5c36. done https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/e5ca2e2fcb06d6577564c0462c82cfe58f61e9ea. Thanks!. Maybe you did install the 4.0.0 files over an existing hashcat folder of an older version? That could cause the problem. Please run make uninstall first, then run make install.. Yeah, it does already. Everything here working as it should. GitHub issues are for bug reports and feature requests only. Please use the forum for usage questions. Please read https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack first. . Please use rule stack feature. If unclear how to do that, ask on hashcat forum. GitHub issues are for bug reports and feature requests only.. Not a bug. Sorry, not possible. Sounds like a bad idea indeed. It's much more clever to capture the handshake with the mobile device and then copy it to a remote site for cracking.. Great work, thanks!. Yes, we often do that.. It makes no sense to have a pure Kernel for this algorithm as it does not support password longer that 12. It's not a hashcat problem.. Is this some error that occurs only for older macOS systems?. @matrix Can you please fix the PR as described in the PR. Can I close the issue - is the fix working?. No response from OP, but should be fixed. Please reopen if turns out otherwise.. That's not how I'd have done that in src/timer.c (The other stuff in Makefile is ok). The use of static variables gives me some headache. Can you rewrite it do use this kind of code as used in v4.0.1?\ntypes.h:\ntypedef struct timeval    hc_timer_t;\ntimer.c:\n```\ninline void hc_timer_set (hc_timer_t* a)\n{\n  gettimeofday (a, NULL);\n}\ninline double hc_timer_get (hc_timer_t a)\n{\n  hc_timer_t hr_tmp;\nhc_timer_set (&hr_tmp);\nreturn (double) (((hr_tmp.tv_sec - (a).tv_sec) * 1000) + ((double) (hr_tmp.tv_usec - (a).tv_usec) / 1000));\n}\n```. Wait I wouldn't say don't run hashcat on laptops. You can do that like pentesters have to do it when they are on site. Just make sure you have an adequat setup and don't run it over several weeks in -w 3 or -w 4 mode.\nAnyway, adding the correct configuration settings to your xorg.conf and your Xsetup file is not a hashcat issue. It's clearly an installation issue. Therefore please use the hashcat forum as GitHub issues are for bugs and feature requests only.\n. As @philsmd and @Chick3nman have explained nicely before this is not an issue. A GPU can only work advantageous compared to CPU if the SCRYPT settings are low enough (like with litecoin computation). Therefore there's no way around adding more CPU power for your algorithm if you want more speed.. I wouldn't say don't crack with a laptop. It's required for pentesters that are required to use their own hardware on site. If you use an adequate notebook it's pretty fine to use it.\nEverything else is as @philsmd mentioned, especially the part with mobile GPU being slower than concrete GPU.\nAnyway this is not a hashcat issue and should not be discussed here. GitHub issues are for bugs and feature requests only.. The problem is that the algorithm puts in a fixed 0x80 byte at position 16. If the password (including the salt) is longer than 16, then I'm not exactly sure how to handle that.\n@magnumripper Any Idea? I see JtR is limiting to lenght 16 as well. Wondering what's the salt then. Is it \"admi\" instead of \"admin\" ?. I was lucky to find the change to the algorithm in order to crack passwords > 16. One simply needs to pad with zero bytes to a next segment of 16 bytes.\n@SilRo991 Thanks for the example hashes, that helped. If you want to play with it, clone latest hashcat version from github and build from source or use the binary beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/ to crack them.\n@magnumripper The change required is explained best way here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/e877c30ebcd250ec67074f56c651d72b11478bcf#diff-7687bc127baaaa448c5fc5e56f0c2133L5571. There's a DEBUG variable that you can set to 1 in src/Makefile. Please make clean before recompiling. Then retry with hashcat -b -m 1500 maybe we're lucky and get some better output. If there's nothing that helps, please try with strace -f -v -s 1000 ./hashcat -b -m 1500 . Can you please retry with the latest version from GitHub master or hashcat.net/beta/ ? I think the problem is solved now but needs confirmation.. Please retry after pulling latest version from github and close the issue if fixed.. Problem should be resolved. Thanks for reporting.. Cool stuff, thanks for the contribution! Can you please change the hash-mode from 10201 to 16400?. OK, thanks so far!\nThe next thing that's missing is the test.pl implementation. Usually we need it to do the unit tests but it's also used to create hashes with just a given password (for example to create the self-test hash). Please add the test.pl implementation.. Excellent contribution, thank you!. Can't reproduce this locally. It's all tabs for me.\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat example0.hash -a 3 ?a --mac --quiet | grep \" \" | wc -l\n0. Still can't reproduce :(\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat example0.hash -a 3 ?a --mac  | grep ^STATUS | grep \" \" | wc -l\n0. It seems like we're both wrong. Here's what's happening:\n[s]tatus [p]ause [b]ypass [c]heckpoint [q]uit => ^M                                                 ^MSTATUS    5       SPEED   0       1000    EXEC_RUNTIME    0.072939        CURKU   1       PROGRESS        95      95      RECHASH 12      6494    RECSALT 0       1       TEMP    35      REJECTED        0\nSo the ^M here is doing the carriage return, that's why grep ^STATUS isn't working. However, there are no spaces after the STATUS line, there's only some before. I'd suggest to add --quiet to the htp client. In that case, there will be no \"problematic\" spaces.. Well yeah, because from a technical perspective (since there's no newline) there's also the prompt part of the line and the prompt has spaces. From how hashcat should work it's correct that way. If you can add the --quiet to I think it's the cleanest solution.. From what I see there's like two different version for Electrum wallets. That's kind of confusing since you're talking only about a specific one in particular. If you want that algorithm added cleanly into hashcat, please provide all the data we need in full and everything described here: \nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_want_to_request_some_new_algorithms_or_features_how_can_i_accomplish_this\nThere more you stick to the data requested on there, the higher the chances to motivate me to add it.\nWhile looking at the JtR Code, I found that one example hash:\n{\"$electrum$1*d64ac297de09893a03bc540b346d5e97*0af493539c512e3ded466b4879b8a47b\", \"openwall123\"},\nThe above example, does this match the algorithm that you're talking about?\nThere's also many different Electrum versions listed. But when it comes to the wallet, it seems there's one for wallets and \"encrypted\" wallets. So from hashcat perspective, we should distinguish between wallet and encrypted wallets?\nThere's no need to pay. If I want to add it, I'll do it for free.\n. I'd estimate performance to be around 250MH/s on a single GTX1080. I've pushed the changes to hashcat with commit: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/553668bb9f6311fb86991e4642cd8e0451e3ea52\nYou should be able to test with latest github master or binary beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/\nIf you really want to contribute, the salt-type 2 and 3 are not yet implemented. You can add a new branch for them in the kernels after the AES decryption part.\nI'll close the issue because it should be working now.. Sure, sounds good. Please send in a PR.. I can't reproduce with almost the same GPU (RX480).\nv4.1.0 (it's the RC1 of v4.0.1 - no kernel changes):\n```\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -b -m 2500\nhashcat (v4.1.0) starting in benchmark mode...\nBenchmarking uses hand-optimized kernel code by default.\nYou can use it in your cracking session by setting the -O option.\nNote: Using optimized kernel code limits the maximum supported password length.\nTo disable the optimized kernel code in benchmark mode, use the -w option.\nOpenCL Platform #1: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nDevice #1: Ellesmere, 3254/4077 MB allocatable, 36MCU\n\nBenchmark relevant options:\n\n--optimized-kernel-enable\n\nHashmode: 2500 - WPA/WPA2 (Iterations: 4096)\nSpeed.Dev.#1.....:   173.8 kH/s (52.28ms)\nStarted: Thu Feb  1 09:19:45 2018\nStopped: Thu Feb  1 09:20:08 2018\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -b -m 2500 -w 3\nhashcat (v4.1.0) starting in benchmark mode...\nOpenCL Platform #1: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nDevice #1: Ellesmere, 3254/4077 MB allocatable, 36MCU\n\nBenchmark relevant options:\n\n--workload-profile=3\n\nHashmode: 2500 - WPA/WPA2 (Iterations: 4096)\nSpeed.Dev.#1.....:   174.0 kH/s (102.26ms)\nStarted: Thu Feb  1 09:20:15 2018\nStopped: Thu Feb  1 09:20:28 2018\n```\nv3.5.0:\n```\nroot@sf:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -b -m 2500 -w 3\nhashcat (v3.5.0) starting in benchmark mode...\nOpenCL Platform #1: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nDevice #1: Ellesmere, 3829/4077 MB allocatable, 36MCU\n\nHashtype: WPA/WPA2\nSpeed.Dev.#1.....:   173.1 kH/s (105.89ms)\nStarted: Thu Feb  1 09:21:21 2018\nStopped: Thu Feb  1 09:21:32 2018\n```\nSame speed.

I've add some more code to change certain parameters, another shot in the dark, since I do not have access to that system and can not reproduce locally. Can you please pull master, recompile and retry again?. Please retry with latest github master version. It's important to run make clean this time.. Please redo the test with latest github master. Had to do some change because this workaround made other hash-modes no longer working. But with a bit of luck the latest changes lead to the same result.. Pull again and retry please.

Not sure if they are really better, I'm just playing around with this. I have no real experience with it, therefore I was asking you to provide the PR.. Please send in an update PR, I'll review. The current PR does not apply cleanly and looks like something went terrible wrong. Please fix!. Looks good, I'll merge it. I'll do some small changes afterwards.. OK, I've pushed my changes. Btw I'm planing to release 4.1.0 soon. That should make it easier to use the changed code from your linux distribution.. I can't reproduce on my systems. \nPlease checkout 7a8239b4c1bb72ec963c841a1a53d96848cc547f and see if it still works on yours.\n. OK, thanks for update!. I think you just forgot to format the device. Please reopen if I'm wrong.. It's not that, it's more like I don't like the idea of it. If you want to switch cases for 9-16 you would write:\nT8 T9 TA.. and so on.\nWhen it comes to P@$$w0rd -> p244W)RD it's even worse as this depends on the keyboard layout. On my german keyboard the @ char would be translated to \" char.. No it's like that this rule was written without thinking of it's implications in the first place. There's a design error in it, why should I buy it.. Please ask on Forum. GitHub issues are only for bugs and feature requests.. I did a second thought on this. I don't think any longer this makes any sense for the most users (except you with your special case). It's the opposite, by adding two parameters outputting more or less the same data this will create confusion - especially for new users.\nTo solve your case I'd suggest to talk to @s3inlc and ask them to add the crackpos information to the hashtopussy database. From there you can easily access it. You also save the step to match it with the password. So this has multiple advantages and feels like the correct solution from a software design perspective.. The rule M and X can be used with -j and -k only.\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# echo p@ssW0rd | ./hashcat --stdout -j 'lMX428'\np@ssw0rdw0. Please ask on Forum. GitHub issues are only for bugs and feature requests.. @magnumripper We changes the x rule to be the O rule a while back to be JtR compatible. We just forgot to update the rule files, too. That's what this PR is doing.. I agree that type of error should be fatal. I've pushed a fix: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/bb401c9cec9370b2e832ee175480da0b626f36b3\nThanks for reporting!. Please use the hashcat forums for usage questions. GitHub issues are for bugs and feature requests only.. Not supported. Use -O and/or -w 3. That's some nice work, but please create a smaller set (max. 10 files) and name it so that a user who has no Idea what this is get's an idea of your idea.. Done with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/547025ec475c2aaa4edf16184e91c24fbefe08ff. As an alternative you can use a candidate generator which is doing what you're looking for and pipe it to hashcat. It does not matter which encoding the candidate generator is using, as hashcat has built-in support for iconv. However, this works only for slow hashes (like -m 500 is).\nBasically the trick is to use the single byte encoding for the mask processing and put it to --stdout, and then use hashcat internal iconv converter in a second hashcat instance. For example, in german it looks like this:\nexample password to crack with utf8 multibyte character:\n$ echo -n t\u00e4st | xxd\n00000000: 74c3 a473 74                             t..st\nexample hash in utf8 to crack:\n$ echo -n t\u00e4st | md5sum.exe\n109623cd486dccc1c2a2601b1144305f *-\ncreate your charset in utf8:\n$ echo -n abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u00e4 | xxd\n00000000: 6162 6364 6566 6768 696a 6b6c 6d6e 6f70  abcdefghijklmnop\n00000010: 7172 7374 7576 7778 797a c3a4            qrstuvwxyz..\nencode as 1 byte encoding:\n$ echo -n abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u00e4 | iconv -f utf-8 -t iso-8859-15 | xxd\n00000000: 6162 6364 6566 6768 696a 6b6c 6d6e 6f70  abcdefghijklmnop\n00000010: 7172 7374 7576 7778 797a e4              qrstuvwxyz.\nredirect into file:\n$ echo -n abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u00e4 | iconv -f utf-8 -t iso-8859-15 > umlaut.charset\ncrack md5 (will work for md5crypt, too):\n```\n$ ./hashcat -a 3 --stdout -1 umlaut.charset ?1?1?1?1 | ./hashcat -m 0 '109623cd486dccc1c2a2601b1144305f' --encoding-from iso-8859-15 --encoding-to utf-8\nhashcat (v4.1.0) starting...\nOpenCL Platform #1: Intel(R) Corporation\n\nDevice #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, skipped.\n\nOpenCL Platform #2: NVIDIA Corporation\n\nDevice #2: GeForce GTX 980, 1024/4096 MB allocatable, 16MCU\n\nHashes: 1 digests; 1 unique digests, 1 unique salts\nBitmaps: 16 bits, 65536 entries, 0x0000ffff mask, 262144 bytes, 5/13 rotates\nRules: 1\nApplicable optimizers:\n Zero-Byte\n Early-Skip\n Not-Salted\n Not-Iterated\n Single-Hash\n Single-Salt\n* Raw-Hash\nMinimum password length supported by kernel: 0\nMaximum password length supported by kernel: 256\nATTENTION!

I can reproduce this but only in -a 3 mode if using -O. All other combination seem to work fine. Can you confirm?.

Also note that in -O the maximum password length for is 27. This is also the case for -a 0.. I was trying to find a way to make this more generic so that it will work on other distributions than fedora but failed. For example, on Ubuntu, there's no package which provides Lzma2Dec.h header. I think the better way of handling this would be to use \"Lzma2Dec.h\" in the ext_lzma.h file as include, and then use a full path to the lzma sdk in the Makefile using -I. Can you rewrite your patch that way?. Please attach the hccapx file so we can reproduce locally. I can not reproduce this locally on my GTX 750Ti.

The issue should be fixed with the latest version from GitHub master. Can you please retry and confirm and close the issue?. I think we can simply add sha256($salt . $pass . $salt), and add a loader on top of it. What's the native parser output of the hash and salt?. Thanks for the PR, looks very nice!\nTo merge there are some modifications needed:\n\nAdd the missing kernels. That is the -a1 and -a3 kernel.\nAdd the test.pl and test.sh entries so we can do unit tests.\nRemove the example77xx and 78xx files. Those are obsolte after (2) is implemented.\n. That's how it is expected to work.. There's a long discussion on this on a different issue and I'm afraid that's the only way of doing it. You need to cd to hashcat installation folder first. There's currently no way of working around that.. No response from OP for a long time, therefore closing the issue. Feel free to reopen if you have new insights.. Great work, thanks!. The host ram is an important factory, but in your case it should be sufficient. The problem in your case is the limited GPU memory (only 500MB). Note that the OpenCL runtime limits the accessible one-block allocation to 1/4 of the total memory. This is simply a limit that you've hit. Note that AMD GPU in combination with rocm do not have such a 1/4 limitation, but they have other problems. Anyway this is not a hashcat problem or bug,. I like the idea of the cached hashlist blob. However, this could create a mess in the hashcat installation folder. The question is in the details. Should we store such a blob in the same folder as the original hashlist or should we use a special blob folder to do that? I'd think the first one sounds better. We also need to have a different filename ideally with a special filename suffix (eg: .hcdump or so). \n\nWe'll also need some sort of header. Any ideas of the required attributes? \nOh and what about if the user changes the data in the original hashfile. We need to make sure that there's no change. We could, for example, store the original hashfile filestats (as @philsmd already said as we do in dictstat) and compare them before we allow hashcat to load the blob.\nFinally the question is: Is it worth having such a complex system and what's the benefit? The only affected users would be users with very large hashlists. But for hashlists < 1M hashes this creates almost no advantage. I'd think most of the hashlists load by hashcat are small hashlists and single hashes but I don't have any real statistics about that.\n. I was talking about the complexity this adds to the hashcat sources. There's simply not enough good reason to do this. Feel free to reopen if there are new arguments.. All cascades are supported for TrueCrypt.\n. Did I miss reading about the single quote somewhere ?\nNo, but it's the shell interpreting the $, not hashcat.\nOne thing I do not understand , the hash was obtained from 1.7 version 128 bit key , but we have to use -m 10500 which is for the lower version.\n(Guessing here): Probably the document was created with an older PDF version and then updated on a newer PDF version, which then sticks to the old encryption for backward compatibility.. The problem is that there's switches that can have influence on a mask/iterate it. That is for example when you use -i or if you use mask files instead of a mask. However, if both cases are false, we can auto-activate the switch. But then how do we disable that behavior if the user (for whatever reason) wants that?. After some thinking with @philsmd we found a major problem when it comes to automatic optimized kernel selection:\nIf the mask is small enough which would allow the use of optimized kernel, we can't say for sure if the salt length is. For example, we can not crack a salt of length 200 in optimized kernel mode, only in pure kernel. However the mask length has no influence here. One can say ok so you check on start the salt length as well, but what if it's a hashfile with multiple salts. And what if some of them are short enough for optimized kernels and others are not. Note that we can not switch between kernels as soon as hashcat has been initialized.\nThis complicates everything and it's even more complicated to explain it to the users because it requires some deep knowledge about hashcats architecture and optimization techniques being used.. Can not reproduce locally. Please reinstall hashcat and make sure to not reuse an existing folder for installation.

This algorithm is so slow that it usually takes up to 2 minutes to perform a full walkthrough of the workitem slice. It's not stuck, it's just very slow.

So this is a MESA error. Hashcat can't do anything to fix it.\n. Looks good to me. Your GPU simply does not have enough memory to do it. Note that there's a critical difference between CPU and GPU, it's the number of compute units. For a CPU we're talking about 16, for a GPU we're talking about 4096. This multiplier is it that need to be applied to memory, too. IOW, you need 256 times the total memory size on each GPU that you have on your host system. If you do not have it you need to stick to CPU.. There's no error. One just have to realize that --keyspace depends on -m.\nroot@et:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -O --keyspace -a 3 mask\n56800235584\nroot@et:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -O --keyspace -a 3 mask -m 1000\n3521614606208\n. I was thinking of that when I've added benchmark mode. However it's very likely benchmark number are post-processed either manually or automatically. The change would be easy, I'm just not sure if it creates more problems than not having it. The only reason why someone would like to see it is to be able to compare two or more entire systems to each other. But IMO that should be done on a different level (excel sheet or whatever).. What is this about?. Too many conflicts now.. Adding such an option feels wrong, it's a too specific request for most people.

Something's strange here!\nWhile your example from JSON works, bit it seems to be using a client from Sep 22, 2015, but this is the latest version 0 (or 1?) on GitHub (did it move somewhere else?).\nNow if you take a look at JtR which support cracking BitShares.Setup.2.0.180115.exe it access a sqlite database. The KDF is the same, but no more password_checksum field. It now needs an additional AES descrypt (plus it became salted) this way to find out if the password is correct.\nThe question is now what's the right algorithm and if there's actually 3 different algorithms (including the one from the backup files).. As stated on the webpage and all documentation, please use the Intel OpenCL runtime. POCL still seem to create problems with complex kernel. Using Intel OpenCL runtime will fix all your problems.. Did you run make clean after changing the variable in Makefile?. Yesterday I did a workaround on a mac os system which produced the same output. The problem was that the OpenCL runtime does not support loading cached kernels. Can you please clone the latest hashcat and hack the src/opencl.c and find the line which says:\nbool cache_disable = false;\nand change it to:\nbool cache_disable = true;\nAnd then run make to compile it and then retry?. It seems the clGetProgramBuildInfo() does not return any output. Otherwise, you'd have seen it after running make clean and sett DEBUG=1 in the Makefile.\nThis is a typical behavior if some implementation in the OpenCL runtime is missing. Therefore there's nothing we can do from hashcat perspective.. You're talking about byte, not bit. I can assume that since vbull (mode 2611) has salts of length 3 byte and 30 byte. However there's no way to do that for 6 byte, the keyspace is simply too big. The only exception would be if you know the Password, in that case you can easily BF a 6 byte salt. However, that would require a different kernel.. -a 3 -1 ?l?d ?1?1?1?1?1?1. As some large IT company would say: It's a feature, not a bug. And it actually is. Note that rules are applied on GPU (to avoid PCI-E bottleneck), therefore the host code can not know that some password candidated with a rule applied is > 8 chars. \nOTOH, it doesn't need to do and that's the reason why hashcat works that way and not the other way. You can do the following command instead:\nhashcat64.exe ..\\password.txt -r rules\\my.rule --stdout | hashcat64.exe -m 2500 ..\\bad.hccapx -w 3 -O\nThis should result in the behaviour you're expecting.\n. That the error is pretty clear. You've installed hashcat 4.1 in C:\\hashcat-4.1.0, however, in the other command you call C:\\hashcat\\hashcat64.exe. The path is a different one, therefore you are using a different hashcat version. This explains the different output, the different speed and (as @roycewilliams noted) the different handling of the current working directory. Everything fine for me, but feel free to reopen.. Can you please add some examples? There's a lot different interpretations possible.. OK, so my basic understanding was the same\n$! would instead be $21\n$0 would instead be $30\nMy problem was, it's also possible that the function itself could be written in hex, we would end up in:\n$! would instead be 2421\n$0 would instead be 2430\nAnd what about rules that use an offset, like insert rule:\ni0! would instead be i021\ni10 would instead be i130\nSo basically --hex-rules would only change the rules that use a character. It's not touching the function name nor the offset. That would be ok.\nWhen it comes to multibyte characters, this is very different than hex rules. There's a special ticket for that. We should not mix up things here.\nIn the end of all, what do we get from it. The only advantage I can see is that it becomes possible to add 0x0a easily. But it was possible all the time (it's just a bit more tricky to do). What I mean is that if you add for example the character 0x01 after the function $ then hashcat will append 0x01.\nWe should also note that supporting such a syntax will also change the way people will write rules. If people start writing rules with --hex-rules syntax they become incompatible with JtR rules for example.\nAlso I can see problems with parsing. Mixed up rules for example, because many user simply cat * > new.rule sometimes. A rule like this:\n$3c\nWould be valid in both syntaxes. In the current one it means \"append a 3, then capitalize\" but it will be also valid for the --hex-rule in which it would mean \"append <\". \n. What I tried to explain is that there are users that simply \"throw everything at it\" mentality. So what they do is that they create one large ruleset out of all rules they have. They don't care what the rules do in detail. If we start having hex rules in default rules/ folder then they will end up in a mixed ruleset build out of hex rules and non hex rules. The problem is, as I described above, that some rules will be parsed as \"valid\" in both cases, but their meaning is a different one, depending if you use --hex-rules or not.\nHowever, what I don't really see is why do we need this. I don't see any case where you can not use the engine as it is today.. All right, if that makes us even more compatible that's an ideal change.. OK, should work now, see commit: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/b88c956d9754a56a99f45ebfa95767b65f8bf4eb. Looks like an installation error. Since there's no more m03100_a0.cl in latest version the only explanation is that you've overwritten the files into an existing folder (which is not supported). If I'm right you can remove the OpenCL folder and unpack it from installation archive, that should fix it. However, it's better to not reuse an existing folder.. I can totally not reproduce this locally. Maybe you should use hashcat from hashcat site and not from Kali. Here's what I did:\n```\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat hashes\nAdmin:f5e6da01af01000097a42cf27356aef866ef545ac4b9a762aaef010ca29c37ae40f69ebb3a74ecdf00000000000000000000000000000000140541646d696e:aa42b3a4cccc9ed949c94794dd0cc046e10128ce\nadmin:c5a53db2d854061a5ae8c28acc2a077b85859ede6ea952be1d2a00005a0b0000a74800008247000035383339313447423830333334354a44140561646d696e:d82a44aa893b842ca9659f6877f3c5c46374d607\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat words \n123\n1234\ntest\npentest\n12345678\n123456\nqwerty\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# ./hashcat -m 7300 hashes words --username -o cracked\nhashcat (v4.1.0-22-g469fece1+) starting...\n...\nHashes: 2 digests; 2 unique digests, 2 unique salts\nBitmaps: 16 bits, 65536 entries, 0x0000ffff mask, 262144 bytes, 5/13 rotates\nRules: 1\n...\nDictionary cache hit:\n Filename..: words\n Passwords.: 7\n Bytes.....: 45\n Keyspace..: 7\n...\nSession..........: hashcat\nStatus...........: Cracked\nHash.Type........: IPMI2 RAKP HMAC-SHA1\nHash.Target......: hashes\nTime.Started.....: Wed Jun 13 16:59:40 2018 (0 secs)\nTime.Estimated...: Wed Jun 13 16:59:40 2018 (0 secs)\nGuess.Base.......: File (words)\nGuess.Queue......: 1/1 (100.00%)\nSpeed.Dev.#1.....:    19611 H/s (0.05ms) @ Accel:128 Loops:1 Thr:512 Vec:1\nRecovered........: 2/2 (100.00%) Digests, 2/2 (100.00%) Salts\nProgress.........: 14/14 (100.00%)\nRejected.........: 0/14 (0.00%)\nRestore.Point....: 0/7 (0.00%)\nCandidates.#1....: 123 -> qwerty\nHWMon.Dev.#1.....: Temp: 37c Fan: 33% Util: 13% Core:1032MHz Mem:2700MHz Bus:16\nStarted: Wed Jun 13 16:59:37 2018\nStopped: Wed Jun 13 16:59:41 2018\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# cat cracked \nc5a53db2d854061a5ae8c28acc2a077b85859ede6ea952be1d2a00005a0b0000a74800008247000035383339313447423830333334354a44140561646d696e:d82a44aa893b842ca9659f6877f3c5c46374d607:12345678\nf5e6da01af01000097a42cf27356aef866ef545ac4b9a762aaef010ca29c37ae40f69ebb3a74ecdf00000000000000000000000000000000140541646d696e:aa42b3a4cccc9ed949c94794dd0cc046e10128ce:pentest\n```. I've tested again on different hardware (NV, AMD and CPU). I still can not reproduce this. Please feel free to reopen if you have additional information to reproduce, but make sure to use the latest version.. Note that for WPA it's perfectly ok to crack invalid passwords IF the user has used the wrong password. The difference to regular hashes is that we're cracking a captured network handshake, not a fixed hash. But this is a wanted behaviour: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6273.html. Not sure what you mean. A salt of length 16 is already supported in -m 10900.. Feel free to reopen the issue if you think there's some change needed.. The -m 10900 format expect the data given in base64, not hex. So you have to recode your salt and hash to base64 first:\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# perl -e 'print pack (\"H*\", \"DBE4ECEF10CED715D83F4F8BE938BE3DFEAB1DB7CB57DD16514E5623BBFB2F0B\")' | base64\n2+Ts7xDO1xXYP0+L6Ti+Pf6rHbfLV90WUU5WI7v7Lws=\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# perl -e 'print pack (\"H*\", \"239AC14998913570FC0F2E25001CB6F5\")' | base64\nI5rBSZiRNXD8Dy4lABy29Q==\nYou've also confused salt and hash, you need to swap it.

If you stick below it, everything is fine, otherwise the driver clocks down the GPU a bit.\n. OK, thanks for reporting. That's one of the reason why I've added the self-test functionality, to find out invalid OpenCL drivers/runtimes. It's good to see it' s working. The reason you didn't see it in 3.5 is because this feature was added in 4.0.0\nThe suggestion to stop hashcat in such a case can be discussed. We could make it like that and only if the user specified --force hashcat will continue.. Added with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/469fece141384e766739f88b4f4ddced6d927a51. Looks good to me. You have multiple handshakes, therefore you have a loss in speed. \nIf there's many handshakes, hashcat does not display the mac addresses since they could be all different. So this is just a display thing.\nIf you want full speed, select a single handshake.. To get the idea behind the hccapx format (which supports the multiple handshake cracking), you should read this: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6273.html\nThere's some advantages over single handshake cracking. Looks like the content of that file is not a hash, so the error is a correct one.. What's the size of the file?. If you use a maskfile you need to define the custom charset in the maskfile. See here for reference:\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack#hashcat_mask_files\nIn the past we had support for -1 to be used from a mask file, but it was kind of confusing. A user had multiple lines of masks in his maskfile (which is supported) but wanted to use different custom charsets for each of the masks.\nSince this is a topic for hashcat forum I'm closing it here.. Thanks for answer @DerBunteBall \nHowever this is a usage topic and therefore should be moved to hashcat forum and closing here.. Thanks! Indeed I've worked too close to how utf-8 defines a valid sequence. It's better to leave out 0x00 - 0x1f. Should be fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/60f2d413e04f67ab39fbf80e8f356a097f29919e. Right, this goes back to the problem that the format system of hashes and salts are flawed in the first place. The only way to solve this is to make sure to not have the colon character as part of the password, which is why we will autohex it. So this is a bug, but not a bug in hashcat and therefore there's no way to solve it.. This is a question better suited to the hashcat forums.. Hashcat support cracking WPA/WPA2 handshakes in -m 2500 mode.. That makes it even more easy. Just use -m 12000.. The good thing is, hashcat informs you about the invalid kernel processing on startup:\n* Device #2: ATTENTION! OpenCL kernel self-test failed.\nHowever, it's not a hashcat problem. I've traced the intermediate keys up to the comparison kernel (where AES comes into play). Both the AES key and the IV is correctly computed on rocm. \nThe next step would be to initialize the AES key scheduler array and on here (using the same shared library code) rocm start computing invalid values. All other tested OpenCL runtimes (NVidia, Intel, pocl, etc) compute it correctly.\nThe key scheduler access a shared memory region of the GPU to make it faster. You can however disable this behavior and make it access constant memory region. If we do this you can see how rocm starts to crack without changing any of the code portion. You can reproduce locally by commenting out line 24 in inc_vendor.cl and remove the kernel/ cache folder entirely. \nNote that the same shared AES function are used in many other kernels (truecrypt 6221 for example) and they work fine over there. This is not a problem in how shared memory is accessed.\nI was able to further track down the issue to this data copy from constant memory to shared memory in m11300_comp() function in m11300.cl:\ns_td0[i] = td0[i];\nSo basically there's nothing we can do to make this more easy. If this doesn't work it's for sure a JiT compiler problem.. Why, do you have new informations?. Probably a Mesa problem. Please retry with rocm.. I've heared about segfaults when using RX480/580 in combination with rocm on a non pcie-3.0 board. In that case, use amdgpu-pro in legacy mode.. Only the first slot seems to be PCIE 3.0. Anyway, if it fails inside rocm there's nothing we can do. It's an opencl runtime problem. Try the workaround I've suggested.. Please use ROCM (preferred) or AMDGPU driver for rx480/580 and uninstall the Mesa OpenCL runtime. IT will fix the problem. Feel free to reopen if it did not work.. I can't reproduce this locally either on GPU nor on CPU. Maybe you can give some details about the hardware and OpenCL driver being used.\nYou can also try using --opencl-vector-width 1. I don't have such a debugging gathering info. Let's start with output of clinfo and hashcat -I. I think I found the root cause of the problem, which is a problem in AMD OpenCL runtime. Luckily I was able to workaround the problem with this commit: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/14c444fd47f9307e06dea0769c6060ac1ebec7a7\nIf you pull hashcat github master you should be able to crack it. Thanks for reporting!\n. Do not use pocl, use intel opencl runtime for xeon.. In theory yes, but that doesn't make much sense if you don't know the password. It could make sense if you know the password. However, in such a case a different tool would be more appropriate. \nHowever where did read about the maximum of 9999 for PIM?. Double request. Yeah, looks like OpenCL installation problem. Anyway, hashcat is not tested on android.. Thanks!. I don't get them with gcc 8 :(. Usually that's when there's the OpenCL runtime is load. Please make sure you have a clean OpenCL installation. Please send clinfo output.. Which driver are you using?. > same happens on hashcat64.exe -I command (i am using hashcat v3.6.0)\nThen it's clearly an opencl runtime installation problem. It's possible that nvidia made an error here, not you users. Pretty sure that no OpenCL application will run on your systems. Feel free to reopen if I'm wrong.. > Clearly should be fixed in hashcat.\nThis file is the OpenCL runtime from Intel Graphicscard (IG) driver (DR) for OpenCL (CL). It's automatically load by the OpenCL ICD in order to find out about existing OpenCL platforms. The ICD get's installed by your driver.\nThere's no relation to hashcat in any way. The same error would occur with any other OpenCL application. \nThere's also no way of checking this kind of (user installation) error on start because hashcat does not control this process.. You can try using your code by using this branch selection:\nuser_options_extra_t *user_options_extra  = hashcat_ctx->user_options_extra;\nif (user_options_extra->attack_kern == ATTACK_KERN_COMBI)\n{\n... your code\n}\nelse\n{\n  ... existing code\n}\nAdd some test cases and send in a PR. Any update on this?. If you think this is still valid please feel free to reopen. Please use https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/83. Please use https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/83. Do not confuse two different things.\nWhen it comes to the include headers use the original ones from KhronosGroup (see BUILD.md).\nWhen it comes to hashcat -I you better use rocm for AMD GPU on Linux and Intel OpenCL runtime for AMD CPU on any OS.\nAnyway this topic is not suited for github issues, please use hashcat forum for usage questions.\n. $ cd /usr/lib/llvm-6.0/lib/clang/\n$ ln -s 6.0.1 6.0.0\n. Works fine on my system.\n```\n78972e04454d4b2246a3957747806e37:94103ee1ac2c:f4a99785929c:belkin.c2c:3wafm3w4\n52340951edfa73c507c11dc2c44de3ed:94103ee1ac2c:5c521e9fa24c:belkin.c2c:3wafm3w4\nSession..........: hashcat\nStatus...........: Cracked\nHash.Type........: WPA/WPA2\nHash.Target......: test.hccapx\n```. No response from OP for two weeks, probably OpenCL runtime installation error. I've added this with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/8903adb164ce6e6c554dc9cb9634a725dabcceb0\nThere's no new status flag, it's simply appended to the end of line. Let's see if there's anyone complaining, then we can add it with status flag.. No response from OP for too long. No response from OP, feel free to reopen. There's no workaround known. ROCm is still the best driver. amdgpu-pro drivers (both modes) are even worse (in other modes), thus we recommend ROCm.. You can not use hashcat without an OpenCL runtime, even if it's just stdout mode. The password candidate modificatinos (rules, combinator, etc) are still done inside an OpenCL kernel. You do not need a GPU. Every CPU should be fine by using Intel OpenCL runtime (even for non-Intel CPU).. Clearly OpenCL runtime error (uses LLVM). Which driver do you use?. No response from OP, feel free to reopen. We need some example data to work with (plus password).. Wait there's something wrong with your installation. I've tested with exact your command and it works fine. I've even tested the restore functionality which works fine. So for me it looks you're trying to restore from an incompatible file which has been created from an older version of hashcat. I think you really need to make sure you're using the latest version of hashcat. A good sign that you're not using the latest version is that you did not use ./ in front of hashcat and eventually executed an older 2nd installation of hashcat. Maybe you used \"make install\" or you have another hashcat installation from your OS repostory. Anyway, not a hashcat problem here.. I find it strange that there's a vendor specific function \"amd_bytealign\" in an Intel Graphic Card driver. However I've renamed some of the function in order to deal with this problem. If you can please retry with latest version from GitHub.. There's something horrible broken in your installation. For example, \"uchar\" is a basic datatype in OpenCL. There's no way an OpenCL JiT can not understand that. Not a hashcat problem.. Example sent. I'm fine with the .dylib change, the other ones I don't understand. Please explain what's going on there and why it is needed. Please send multiple PR for multiple changes.. Note that with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/2530f83029da1f657ae54bea62f2a1d90a806b99 I've moved out the LZMA files from the include folder, therefore the change in the installation routines in your PR should no longer be neccessary. Looks like a good fix to me. Please send in a PR.. Thanks. Thanks!. Thanks!. Please explain why we need to do this and what's happening in case we do not merge this PR. \n. > Currently the first library pathname checked is the executing shell's $PWD/libhashcat.\nThis sounds really strange to me. In Linux, there's no library search path for \".\" because of the security implication this creates. Here's an older issue that dealt with the same problem: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/956\n\nIf there isn't a libhashcat in $PWD, then the default library paths are checked. This can cause misbehavior\n\nWait here, what kind of misbehavior are you talking about?\n\nso the PR changes it to the executable path for the initial build (in case the library is used in place)\n\nOK, but wouldn't this create a relative path which is what we need to avoid (see the issue linked above)?. Why is this so different to Linux or Unix in general? Usually if you have a shared library you copy it to /usr/lib or whatever folder your distribution uses for this case. Done.\nIf you don't want to copy the shared library you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the folder where you did installed the library. This can be \".\", too. Is there no LD_LIBRARY_PATH on macOS?. OK, thanks!. Should be fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/9d431117309e51d0a29bb16daa8ac01ba15a77ee\nMany thanks for reporting!. Please use rli or rli2 from hashcat-utils. It makes no sense from a technical perspective:\nIf you want to crack fast hashes (MD5 etc) then a check between existing such an exclude wordlist would slow down the attack more than it would benfit from it. IOW, it's faster to check passwords even if they have been tested already.\nIf you want to crack slow hashes (TrueCrypt etc) it would eventually make sense, however you can also write the candidates first to a file (use --stdout) and then apply rli/rli2 on it.\n. Right, but the disk space required can not be that large for slow hashes (like WPA) because if it's really that large, the attack makes no sense anyway.. There's no problem with special characters in rules, you just need to know that rules work byte-wise. IOW, you need to encode your rule as ISO and not UTF-8. You can use iconv to convert. However, that's a question for hashcat forum, therefore closing this issue.. On my GTX750Ti I have very similar values to yours:\nGTX750Ti:\nGlobal memory size                              2098069504 (1.954GiB)\n  Max memory allocation                           524517376 (500.2MiB)\nGTX960:\nGlobal memory size 2064121856 (1.922GiB)\nMax memory allocation 516030464 (492.1MiB)\nYour Driver Version : 390.77 is fine, too.\nNo idea why this error occurs.. Sure, please install Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 on the box, then we can start debugging (as you know Kali is not supported).. Sorry man there's no way around Ubuntu.. Correct. See if the error still occurs. If yes, please come to IRC freenode channel #hashcat and msg me directly (atom) - then wait.. Any update here?. I was able to reproduce this on my development system, but it required me to have a second instance of hashcat running in parallel. The reason is that with OpenCL there's actually no way to check if the total available OpenCL device memory is free to use or not. That means if you have X11 running on the GPU (or any other application that requires GPU memory, miners, games, browser, etc) than this error will occur.\nPlease check if the error still exists with hashcat v4.2.0 and if yes, please execute nvidia-smi and post the output here.. All right, that's nice. Looks like we just identified another problem related to Kali. So it takes 640mb on your X11, for whatever reason. Can you please shutdown x11 and try to run hashcat from the console directly?. OK based on this information I tried to workaround the problem by checking for available memory before actually running a kernel. I've pushed a beta version of this workaround here: https://hashcat.net/beta/\nCan you please retry your tests with this beta version please.. OK, cool. The workaround is a bit hackish. We have to test it on all the different opencl runtimes, but I think I will let it stay as it is. Thanks for your report! No need to shutdown X11.. > I am seeing this error on Ubuntu 16.04 but with -m 1811\nPlease retry with latest beta version from https://hashcat.net/beta/ or github master and report if it fixes the error for you.. Fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/39af031ced759117fc7c067722950072f1827abd . That's only possible before applying rules (or any other form of amplifier).\nYou can use something like this:\n./hashcat --stdout example.dict -j '>B'\n007ambiorix\n007matthias\n01Neunauge10\n03chevrolet\n03coffeeman\n03liverpool\n03montessori\n03salvatore\n...\n. Yeah there's no useful way to do this on GPU since you have to spawn the thread anyway and then it has to wait for the others to complete, we can not request \"next\" in this case. For slow hashes you can use the method I've shown and pipe to hashcat.. This is great! Can you add test.sh and test.pl cases please?. Almost perfect, I'll merge this. There's three minor things missing for perfection:\n\nMissed entry in read docs/readme.txt\nMissed entry in read extra/tab_completion/hashcat.sh \nInstead of OPTS_TYPE_HASH_COPY add the missing/unused attributes to an extra attribute in esalt so you can rebuild the original string using sprintf in ascii_digest()\n\nThe perl stuff looks good, too.. Thanks!. Fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/afd1efd59c33cf6120cf9e9e97ddb8d7daf6587f\nYou can use latest github master or latest beta from https://hashcat.net/beta for testing\nThanks for report!. Perfect!. At least 1.5GB host memory per OpenCL device. Thanks!. Is there a reason why we developers have to do that? Usually it's done by package maintainers.. No reponse from OP, therefore closing the discussion. Feel free to reopen.. Fixed both problems. You can either rebuild using github master or use the binary from https://hashcat.net/beta/ or wait for the next release. Thanks for reporting!. Please retry with latest hashcat beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/ and post the entire output again using this version.. No response from OP for a long time and probably just a driver issue, therefore closing. Feel free to reopen if any new insights come in.. There's a special parsing module for 9700 called the native output format. If you select --username, the first column is skipped, therefore the native parser can no longer parse it and gives that specific error message.\nThere's not many hash-modes that support native output format, therefore you didn't face that problem with other hash-modes.\nThe only way to make this work is to either remove the native loader (which I think is a good thing) or to not use --username. Please tell @s3inlc to not automatically use --username in this case.. Not a hashcat error. Did you try the impact of the change on fast hash single hash brute-force? What's the speed loss or is it even faster?. I benchmark the changes you made and I can't find any differences. Therefore I'm not going to merge this. \nHowever, while I was checking the changes I came up with a different solution that actually increased the performance a lot (almost doubled):\n```\ndiff --git a/OpenCL/inc_hash_md4.cl b/OpenCL/inc_hash_md4.cl\nindex bce232d..17994c1 100644\n--- a/OpenCL/inc_hash_md4.cl\n+++ b/OpenCL/inc_hash_md4.cl\n@@ -1558,6 +1558,58 @@ DECLSPEC void md4_update_vector_utf16le_swap (md4_ctx_vector_t *ctx, const u32x\n   md4_update_vector_64 (ctx, w0, w1, w2, w3, (len - pos1) * 2);\n }\n+DECLSPEC void md4_update_vector_local (md4_ctx_vector_t ctx, __local u32 w, const int len, const u32x w0r)\n+{\n+  u32x w0[4];\n+  u32x w1[4];\n+  u32x w2[4];\n+  u32x w3[4];\n+\n+  w0[0] = w[ 0] | w0r;\n+  w0[1] = w[ 1];\n+  w0[2] = w[ 2];\n+  w0[3] = w[ 3];\n+  w1[0] = w[ 4];\n+  w1[1] = w[ 5];\n+  w1[2] = w[ 6];\n+  w1[3] = w[ 7];\n+  w2[0] = w[ 8];\n+  w2[1] = w[ 9];\n+  w2[2] = w[10];\n+  w2[3] = w[11];\n+  w3[0] = w[12];\n+  w3[1] = w[13];\n+  w3[2] = w[14];\n+  w3[3] = w[15];\n+\n+  int pos1;\n+  int pos4;\n+\n+  for (pos1 = 0, pos4 = 16; pos1 < len - 64; pos1 += 64, pos4 += 16)\n+  {\n+    md4_update_vector_64 (ctx, w0, w1, w2, w3, 64);\n+\n+    w0[0] = w[pos4 +  0];\n+    w0[1] = w[pos4 +  1];\n+    w0[2] = w[pos4 +  2];\n+    w0[3] = w[pos4 +  3];\n+    w1[0] = w[pos4 +  4];\n+    w1[1] = w[pos4 +  5];\n+    w1[2] = w[pos4 +  6];\n+    w1[3] = w[pos4 +  7];\n+    w2[0] = w[pos4 +  8];\n+    w2[1] = w[pos4 +  9];\n+    w2[2] = w[pos4 + 10];\n+    w2[3] = w[pos4 + 11];\n+    w3[0] = w[pos4 + 12];\n+    w3[1] = w[pos4 + 13];\n+    w3[2] = w[pos4 + 14];\n+    w3[3] = w[pos4 + 15];\n+  }\n+\n+  md4_update_vector_64 (ctx, w0, w1, w2, w3, len - pos1);\n+}\n+\n DECLSPEC void md4_final_vector (md4_ctx_vector_t ctx)\n {\n   MAYBE_VOLATILE const int pos = ctx->len & 63;\ndiff --git a/OpenCL/m00900_a3-pure.cl b/OpenCL/m00900_a3-pure.cl\nindex 5ca3027..9c93234 100644\n--- a/OpenCL/m00900_a3-pure.cl\n+++ b/OpenCL/m00900_a3-pure.cl\n@@ -19,10 +19,9 @@ __kernel void m00900_mxx (__global pw_t pws, __global const kernel_rule_t rule\n    * modifier\n    /\n\nconst u64 lid = get_local_id (0);\n   const u64 gid = get_global_id (0);\n-\nif (gid >= gid_max) return;\nconst u64 lid = get_local_id (0);\nconst u64 lsz = get_local_size (0);\n\n/\n    * base\n@@ -30,32 +29,30 @@ __kernel void m00900_mxx (__global pw_t pws, __global const kernel_rule_t rule\nconst u32 pw_len = pws[gid].pw_len;\n\nu32x w[64] = { 0 };\n\n__local u32 w[64];\n\n\nfor (int i = 0, idx = 0; i < pw_len; i += 4, idx += 1)\n\nfor (MAYBE_VOLATILE u32 i = lid; i < 64; i += lsz)\n   {\nw[idx] = pws[gid].i[idx];\n\nw[i] = pws[gid].i[i];\n   }\n\n\nbarrier (CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE);\n+\n\nif (gid >= gid_max) return;\n+\n   /**\nloop\n*/\n\n\n\n-  u32x w0l = w[0];\nfor (u32 il_pos = 0; il_pos < il_cnt; il_pos += VECT_SIZE)\n   {\n     const u32x w0r = words_buf_r[il_pos / VECT_SIZE];\n-    const u32x w0 = w0l | w0r;\n-    w[0] = w0;\n md4_ctx_vector_t ctx;\n\n md4_init_vector (&ctx);\n\n\nmd4_update_vector (&ctx, w, pw_len);\n\nmd4_update_vector_local (&ctx, w, pw_len, w0r);\nmd4_final_vector (&ctx);\n\n\n@@ -74,10 +71,9 @@ __kernel void m00900_sxx (__global pw_t pws, __global const kernel_rule_t rule\n    * modifier\n    */\n\nconst u64 lid = get_local_id (0);\n   const u64 gid = get_global_id (0);\n-\nif (gid >= gid_max) return;\nconst u64 lid = get_local_id (0);\nconst u64 lsz = get_local_size (0);\n\n/\n    * digest\n@@ -97,13 +93,17 @@ __kernel void m00900_sxx (__global pw_t pws, __global const kernel_rule_t rule\nconst u32 pw_len = pws[gid].pw_len;\n\nu32x w[64] = { 0 };\n\n__local u32 w[64];\n\n\nfor (int i = 0, idx = 0; i < pw_len; i += 4, idx += 1)\n\nfor (MAYBE_VOLATILE u32 i = lid; i < 64; i += lsz)\n   {\nw[idx] = pws[gid].i[idx];\n\nw[i] = pws[gid].i[i];\n   }\n\n\nbarrier (CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE);\n+\n\nif (gid >= gid_max) return;\n+\n   /**\nloop\n/\n@@ -114,15 +114,11 @@ __kernel void m00900_sxx (__global pw_t pws, __global const kernel_rule_t *rule\n   {\n const u32x w0r = words_buf_r[il_pos / VECT_SIZE];\n\n\n\n-    const u32x w0 = w0l | w0r;\n-    w[0] = w0;\n md4_ctx_vector_t ctx;\n\n md4_init_vector (&ctx);\n\n\nmd4_update_vector (&ctx, w, pw_len);\n\nmd4_update_vector_local (&ctx, w, pw_len, w0r);\nmd4_final_vector (&ctx);\n\n\n```\nWith your PR you have shown a good understanding of the core functions for OpenCL kernels.

On my rx480 the speed only went up from 4.4GH/s to 5.1GH/s. However, on all my GTX cards it dropped by almost the half. Therefore I'm no longer going this path because there's much more NV users than there is AMD users.. Very likely to be a problem with the HD Graphics 520. Retry with -D1 too check if the CPU works. Please continue this thread on hashcat forum, this is not a hashcat problem and shouldn't discussed here.. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a4ac370496d030777a5d5d65a894ac6bc2f953c6\nIf you don't want to wait for next release you can use latest github master or beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/\nThanks for reporting!. Please reinstall Intel OpenCL runtime for CPU. Do not install any SDK. Do not install GPU support.. Please retry with hashcat 5.0.0 and reopen if not fixed.. Not a hashcat issue. No response from OP for a long time plus probably driver error therefore closed. Feel free to reopen if you have no insights.. In this case the mask is longer than 16, because ?h gets expanded internally, plus the 8d so you'll end up with 9 characters. I can't see a problem here.. For me it looks like you are using a broken github clone. Ideally re-clone the entire hashcat source from scratch.. Since this algorithm is known to have a dynamic iteration count, I agree with @Chick3nman theory. Feel free to reopen this issue if you want, but please provide both hash lines so we can reproduce locally.. Memleaks come from OpenCL runtime not hashcat. Please inform driver vendors instead.. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a4ac370496d030777a5d5d65a894ac6bc2f953c6\nIf you don't want to wait for next release you can use latest github master or beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/\nThanks for reporting!\n. Not a hashcat problem anyway. Looks nice, please send in PR with all functions affected. Ideally you can use tools/code_generators/ and add or modify a perl script. Those are responsible for doing the changes.. Based on the changes your did with your latest PR, are you going to add this change in form of a new code generator or did you do already? If yes, could please PR the changes to the inc_common.cl as well?. Implemented with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/e1fe3e755b54c0dd8ccb5c6a0bc3a7f48f4c9693\nNot exactly the same way but performance improvement should be the same or better.. GPU is too old. If you want to make use of the CPU uninstall MESA and install Intel OpenCL runtime (works good with AMD CPU).. hashcat is reading wordlists bytewise, therefore it misinterprets the first bytes which ar part of the BOM header as part of the first password. \nAdditionally, new users try out hashcat just to see if it works and then they place a correct test password in the first line of the wordlist. If they do that including a BOM, then hashcat will not find the expected password and new users are disappointed.\nAnyway wordlists should not include BOM because the functionality is ignore anyway.. I can reproduce this with the following command:\n\ntype example.dict | hashcat64.exe -m 400 example400.hash\n\nBut it requires the latest github master version (or binary beta from hashcat.net/beta). Older versions 4.1.0, 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 seem not affected.\n. No response from OP and probably an error in a third party overlay, therefore closing issue. Feel free to reopen.. Good info for start, thanks. Looks doable :). Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a4ac370496d030777a5d5d65a894ac6bc2f953c6\nIf you don't want to wait for next release you can use latest github master or beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/\nThanks for reporting!\n. \nThis line:\n\notp_code = ((ctx.opad.h[otp_offset/4] & 0xffffff) << 8) | ((ctx.opad.h[otp_offset/4+1] % 0xffffff00) >> 24);\n\nYou do:\n\n(ctx.opad.h[otp_offset/4] & 0xffffff) << 8\n\nThis is fine, but then you do:\n\n(ctx.opad.h[otp_offset/4+1] % 0xffffff00) >> 24\n\nThis looks like some bytewise align, IF you'd have used & 0xffffff00 and not % 0xffffff00. \nThe outcome with both operators should be the same, but I think you can replace it with & and make it more logical than arithmetic.\nThis line:\n\ns[idx] = swap32_S (salt_bufs[salt_pos].salt_buf[idx]);\n\nYou can, if you want, do the swapping in the parser code. \nThis has the advantage that hashcat don't has to call swap32_S() again and again in the kernel. \nI doubt it will give alot of performance increase on GPU, but maybe on a slow CPU you can see the difference. Note that you will have to do another swap() in the ascii_digest() to synchronize it with the original salt.\n\nswitch(otp_offset%4)\n\nOn some systems, &3 is faster than %4 while the result is the same\nIf you write a mask like this \n\n0xffffff\n\nand also use a mask like this:\n\n0xffffff00\n\nIt's better to write 0x00ffffff instead of 0xffffff. This keeps the code aligned in width. While it's the same for the compiler, it's much easier for the human brain to figure out the idea if it does have to deal with alignment.\nOne more thing:\nWe can assume this mode to produce tons of collisions. Since this is the expected behavior, you can tell hashcat to enable --keep-guessing by setting it in the hash-mode switch case:\nopts_type |= OPTS_TYPE_PT_NEVERCRACK;\nThis will tell hashcat about to continue cracking\n. > Added hash-mode 18100 = TOTP (HMAC-SHA1)\nand this:\n\nstatic const char *HT_18100 = \"TOTP (HMAC-SHA1)\";\n\nand this:\n\n18100 | TOTP (HMAC-SHA1)  ...\n\nDidn't you want to change this to Onetime Token or something?\n\nunsigned long timestamp = 0;\n timestamp = hc_strtoul ((const char *) salt_pos, NULL, 10);\n\nTwo things here:\n\nDo we really want to use unsigned long?

First i created a random hash (I guess there's not error so far, but please take a close look and verify)\n\n$ echo -n hashcat | tools/test.pl passthrough 18100\n504267:85457442135216\n\nThen I tried to crack it, but it did not work:\n\n./hashcat -m 18100 504267:85457442135216 hashca?1 -1 t -a 3 \nHowever, with smaller salts (less than 2^32) it works. So there seems to be a problem with larger salt values.\n. > snprintf (out_buf, out_len - 1, \"%06d:%llu\", digest_buf[1], tmp_salt_buf);\nthis needs to be written like this:\n\nsnprintf (out_buf, out_len - 1, \"%06d:%\" PRIu64, digest_buf[1], tmp_salt_buf);\n\nyou also need to add this to interface.h in order to enable PRIu64\ninclude \n\nbase32_encode (int_to_base32, (const u8 ) plain_ptr, plain_len, (u8 ) temp_buf);\n   plain_len = strlen ((const char *) temp_buf);\n\nI think you can rewrite this to just:\nplain_len = base32_encode (int_to_base32, (const u8 ) plain_ptr, plain_len, (u8 ) temp_buf);\n\n           hashconfig->dgst_pos0      = 1;\n           hashconfig->dgst_pos1      = 2;\n           hashconfig->dgst_pos2      = 3;\n           hashconfig->dgst_pos3      = 4;\n\n\nPlease rewrite it to use 0, 1, 2 and 3 instead. I see your point with staying stick to sha1-hmac\nbut in my view its not correct. The last one who touches the digest is not sha1,\nit's the algorithm you use. Therefore the compiler can create not auto optimized code by assuming\nthe second element is the first element.\nDon't forget to change the code in parser code, too\n\nDGST_SIZE_4_5\n\nI think you can set it to DGST_SIZE_4_4 afterwards and save some memory\n\n. I can reproduce this problem with 18.10.1 and latest hashcat. However, it's not a hashcat problem. \nThe same hashcat version on the same system runs fine on:\n\nLinux AMD rocm driver 1.9.211\nLinux AMD legacy driver 18.30-641594\n\nIf you think it's a problem related to Windows, that's not the case.\nThe same hashcat version runs fine on:\n\nWindows Intel driver 6.4.0.25\nWindows NVidia driver 416.34\n\nThe reason why hashcat 3.6 works is because it is missing some features especially in WPA kernel. For example cracking WPA2 + SHA256. \nAlso all other kernels work fine using Windows + AMD 18.10.1.\n. Please retry with hashcat 5.0.0 and reopen if not fixed.. It's pretty clear. There was an older version of hashcat installed, either by using \"make install\" or from a package. You can not mix old kernel and new hashcat binary.\nMake sure to use \"make uninstall\" and then run \"make install\" again.. Not by default, you have to alter a kernel and white-out the unneeded bits. Also with just 10 bits you will have tons of collisions. I think 10 bit is even fast enough to produce on slowest CPU you can think of.. For the above reason, I don't see a reason to have a issue in here for it.. Great! Thanks!. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/d4123333c0a6f7836df8ce40b56b9dc308da2925 should help. You can either use hashcat github master and compile yourself, use the binary beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/ or wait for the next release version. I typical announce new releases on twitter.. I did some changes, please retry. If problem still exists, add some more details. Otherwise please close the issue.. No reponse from OP but I think its fixed now, therefore closing. Feel free to reopen if needed.. The default mask is not supposed to crack all LM password. Please use a full mask instead.. Please provide example hash and password.

Note: the original issue was about 734 bytes and we support 2k byte. Therefore there is no issue or it was not described correctly. Note that there has to be an upper limit since there's no dynamic memory alloaction on GPU.. All problems solved, everything works as it should.. Which disk encryption are you talking about? Is that somehow different than the LUKS implementation we already have?. The error message tells you that the driver used (which ships the OpenCL runtime) is not the correct one. For Intel CPU, it's Intel OpenCL runtime. Make sure there's not OpenCL SDK installed. Also make sure that the GPU OpenCL driver part is broken in the Intel OpenCL runtime itself, so it can no be used. IOW, you can only use your CPU but you need to select the right OpenCL runtime. This one was updated to 18.x version recently and I added support for this in hashcat 5. Anyway, not a bug.. There's several things that the IPro rule-engine did different from JtR. When I wrote hashcat rule-engine I was under the impression the IPro rule-engine and the JtR rule-engine are 1:1 the same. Sometimes I used JtR for some functions and sometimes I use IPro. For example, in IPro positions for \"i\" for example, start with 1, not with 0. About the \"S\" I'm not sure what it is doing actually.\nSince both files do not change anymore (since they are not developed anymore) it would actually make sense to \"downgrade\" the content to hashcat/JtR syntax and remove the functions which are not supported.. Try with --opencl-vector-width 1 and post result please. We got rid completely of amd_bytealign(). I think it will work with the latest version from GitHub master.\n. Pretty sure \"So on\" is correct and \"Soon\" is not. We can only do it for -S so it will not work for -m 160. I guess it makes no sense then? Feel free to reopen.. I can confirm that the server is not running on Windows. The client should work. Please confirm.. I've pushed a fix and updated beta version here: https://hashcat.net/beta/ please check if fixed and close the issue. New beta up, please retry.. Not sure what to classify as mainstream distro, but Ubuntu does not (18.04).\nAnother problem is that only the library files xxhash.c and xxhash.h are BSD licensed.\nFinally we need the xxhash.c and xxhash.h to cross compile the windows binary.\n. Stop, I'll provide a more general solution, also for opencl headers. Never said that, just had not time to do it yet. That's simply a misunderstanding. I'll provide the patch in the next minutes.. OK I send in the path. @ZeroChaos- and @anthraxx can you please try if it works for your distributions? Maybe we need to change some of the system specific include paths?. Thanks, fixed!. There's a flag in the Makefile to enable the use of the system headers. OK I send in the path. @ZeroChaos- and @anthraxx can you please try if it works for your distributions? Maybe we need to change some of the system specific include paths?. > I'm pretty sure on ubuntu, for instance, it's called liblzma-dev and you can link it with -llzma (instead of -llzmasdk).\n\nOther distributions could use other names for the library of course (e.g. p7zip or 7z, 7zip related instead of lzma, lzma-sdk etc)\n\nI couldn't find the required headers in this ubuntu package. I think what we would also need is something like liblzma-sdk-dev (which doesn't exist). Mixing SDK headers with distribution libraries could cause problems.\nFor Ubuntu I'd therefore recommend to stick to our bundled LZMA SDK files. I don't see how we can improve this any further. If package maintainers want to use system libraries, they have to modify the path to the includes plus they may have to modify the name of the library to link. Since this can be different from distro to distro want can't do much on here.. Should be fixed, thanks!. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/175fea40942d91af2d79714b69e75b308da1b4c5\nThanks for reporting!. This is something that can occur pretty fast when it comes to scrypt. Almost all resources are heavily used. \nHashcat asks for free availability of resources on startup and the OpenCL runtime is responsible for the response. If the OpenCL runtime approves for enough resources to be available even if that is not the case, it's more like an OpenCL runtime problem, not a hashcat problem.\nAs a workaround try to use -D 1 (after installed intel opencl runtime for your CPU).\n. Thanks!. Great Idea! Added support with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/d4dad3e1e304c34468eaab6661cde940793ceafb. make sure to git clone the repository. do not use the source package from the site. git requires git to be able to initialize the submodules.. continued on https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1760. Please retry with latest beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/. Please post console output. We need to make sure that you're actually using the CPU device not the GPU device.. That's what I expected. Your are using the GPU, not the CPU. Please make sure to specify -D 1 (note the capital D, not d).. It depends on scrypt settings. For cryptocurrencies for example it works fine, but for data protections it's often too high to run on GPU. Only CPU.. Are you sure that this is really a bug? The \"Driver temperature threshold met warning...\" message was always displayed (also in 4.2) even if --gpu-temp-disable was specified. That's a wanted behaviour.\nMaybe the use of -S causes the GPU to create more heat (because of an eventual higher GPU utilization). In that case everything works as expected. Please verify.. I tend to agree with @philsmd to revert the changes (not really a git revert but restore the behavior as it was before the PR), but do an additional change. \nInstead of calling the parameter --gpu-temp-disable and --gpu-temp-abort we should rename them to --hwmon-disable and --hwmon-temp-abort. Note that even if there's no temperature reading for CPU today it doesn't mean we will never have it in the future.\nIt would be nice to have @RAN1 to comment in detail the reason for the changes. But as we want to release a bug-fix release soon we should not wait too long in case @RAN1 does not respond and just to the changes as discussed.. Since there was no response I did the modifications here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/2aff01b20ee3d56defea58fc573dd3340b435293\nNew beta is up on https://hashcat.net/beta/\nThanks for reporting!. Please add files to reproduce. I can crack it as well, but with a password which is not inside the wordlist provided by OP. Not sure what's the problem here, that's exactly how it works.. make sure to git clone the repository. do not use the source package from the site. git requires git to be able to initialize the submodules.. It requires an intense amount of system resources. One does not simply activate the brain :). Wrong project. I'm not sure what's the problem here. You ran into the typical bottleneck caused be feature type 1. Are you sure that you read the entire documentation carefully? It's all here:\nhttps://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7903.html\nFor fast attacks like yours you probably want to stick to --brain-client-features 2\n. Which driver exactly is it?. I tried to reproduce this locally using the latest AMD adrenalin edition drivers (both branches, that is 18.11.1-nov8 and 18.9.3-oct5). I tried with stable 5.0.0 as well as with latest 5.1.0 beta. In all combinations, it always worked perfect. Maybe you need to reinstall the drivers with a clean install..

Note that if you use the install target without copying/moving the binary after install, then hashcat assume to be installed system-wide and will write files to $HOME/.hashcat. I just tested 18.11.1 today and works fine. Your GPU is not too old, so I guess this is just a driver installation problem. Reinstall it and make sure the old driver was uninstalled cleanly.

Great work again, thanks!\nThe parameter for hooks is currently set to void for all the macros. I assume you will push another some PR for the one kernel which is using the hooks.\n. It's important to know which version exactly you are using. In case of hashcat 5.1.0 from github master or from https://hashcat.net/beta/ then you are using the new behavior which sets the --brain-client-features to 2 (from 3) and therefore does not enable deep inspection required as you are describing. In that case, simply add --brain-client-features 3 to your commandline and it should work.\nIf you are using hashcat 5.0.0 release version, then it should do exactly as you said. If that is not that case, please retry with latest hashcat master or beta and report back. Don't forget to set --brain-client-features 3 in that case.\nIf this does not help you, please provide all files we need to reproduce locally.\n. Should be fixed with latest commit. You can use the beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/ if you want to try. Thanks for reporting!. It's a driver error, not hashcat error.. It's a driver error, not hashcat error. Also uninstall MESA, looks like a MESA JiT compiler error. Not a hashcat error.. As it says: NVAPI_ERROR is an error inside nvidias NVAPI library. Thanks for reporting, but not a hashcat problem.. That's correct since we usually dont have the a collision with up-to-date modes. It's also the correct answer to the questoin, therefore closing.. The problem with this is, if a user sets both --keep-guessing and --no-keep-guessing both at the same time, how should hashcat react. Additionally, having both options in --help menu is confusing, too.\nFor that reason, I've decided to not add this option. This will affect only 4 algorithms: 9720, 9820, 14900 and 18100.\nIf you really need to stop this behavior, you can change the setting easily with latest modularized hashcat version. Go to src/modules/module_09720.c and remove the OPTS_TYPE_PT_NEVERCRACK option or replace it with 0. Then run make to recompile.\n. My main concern is about how to deal with the confusion it creates having both options in the --help menu. It doesn't matter if there's a parameter available to the --keep-guessing option. The confusion is the same.\nAn alternative would be to remove the automatic activation of keep-guessing in the modes 9720, 9820, 14900 and 18100. For them, we could instead print a message with a suggestion to use the option --keep-guessing on the command line.\n. Done https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/111889d3fc63554382b99fe3893f63e58ba96b83. This is great, thanks! Exactly what I was looking for. I'll add the missing space and replace the spaces with the tab character.. Indeed :). Great work again, thanks!\nSome comments:\n\nPlease add a string substring (ODF) to the human readable descriptions for example in usage.c, interface.c, readme.txt and changes.txt.

In that case I think we need to modify interface.c a bit, too:\nIn electrum_wallet13_parse_hash:\nif ((salt_type == 1) || (salt_type == 2) || (salt_type == 3))\nIt should be just:\nif ((salt_type == 1) || (salt_type == 2)) ?\nCan you update the PR?\n. $electrum$5* is not supported. Many thanks!. I've never seen \"raw\" cbc mode in LUKS before. The low iteration count also gives a hint. It could be a very old system or a very slow system (embedded) since LUKS meassures the time it takes to do N iterations in a second and then setting this as the iteration count. \nBut I think it's just old. In that case it's possible that the algorithm is just not available anymore today, which is the reason why it's not in hashcat. While the kernel was developed, there was no such function to select from and therefore no one ever thought about having this.. Thanks s3inlc!\nThere's a few things missing:\n\nEntry in docs/readme.txt\nEntry in extra/tab_completion/hashcat.sh\nEntry in src/usage.c\n\nIf you want you can also try the optimized kernels. Especially for fast hashes like this one it has a serious impact.. Many thanks!. OpenCL runtime is not working or not existing. Either way, not a hashcat issue.. Not a hashcat error (it's a POCL error).. You maybe want to make sure your power management settings are in sync. It's possible that the default settings are changed between the different driver versions. For example, I use this script:\n```\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nnvidia-smi -pm 1\nnvidia-smi -acp 0\nnvidia-smi -pl 300\nnvidia-settings -a GPUPowerMizerMode=1 -a GPUFanControlState=1 -a GPUTargetFanSpeed=100 -a GPULogoBrightness=0\n```\nIn case you're on windows, you can use MSI AfterBurner to verify the power limits are in sync. I tried to verify on my local development system. This linux box only has a GTX750Ti installed and my other development box with the 1080 is currently unavailable. However I cannot see any difference for the GTX750Ti at last. If anything I'd say that there was some performance increase from 396.x -> 410.x.\nTested with hashcat v5.1.0: rm -rf kernels; ./hashcat64.bin -b -m 2500 -u 32 -n 128 -T 1024 --opencl-vector-width 1 --force \n384.130: 62381 H/s  \n390.87:  62414 H/s\n396.54:  62433 H/s      \n410.93:  63651 H/s\n415.25:  63532 H/s\nFeel free to reopen if you have new insights.\n. Which hash-mode is this?. I can reproduce this, but it's a driver problem, not a hashcat problem. IOW, we can't do anything about it. \nYou can try other modes in hashcat and you will see hashcat will work well. This explains why zcash and etherium work well. They do not use the same algorithm which WPA is using.\n. Great, thanks!. Perfect, many thanks!. Currently I see no way to do this.. OpenCL installation user error. Salt length constrains in -m 111 cannot be -1. In -m 112, if there's a fixed length  salt it should be fixed in both pure and optimized mode. No response from OP, feel free to reopen. Please retry with latest version from github master. Make sure to run \"make clean\" before recompiling.. I did some change with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/ed7765d8fdca23d3eb71e8fd94ce25546ceacea3 which successfully worked around the same problem with AMDGPU driver on Linux by unrolling some AES function. It is possible that the same workaround will also work for macosx. Please clone latest github master version and retry.. Thanks, this looks like some good work. \nIt would be nice if we can have this not for zip but 7zip. This ensures higher compressing rates, cross platform availability and we even have support for 7zip library in the Makefile.\nPlease create a new PR in the hash-module-plugin branch instead since we're in the middle of a very deep refactorization.. Sorry, wrong wording. Of course I meant LZMA (as it is written in the Makefile).. As discussed, please use LZMA instead.. No that's the reason why I cannot accept the PR because I don't want the zlib SDK deps. For LZMA, currently it's just parts of the LZMA SDK. Please add the remaining files from original LZMA SDK which you need for decompression. If you do not want to update the current PR, please close it and create a new one for LZMA.. It's almost good. I think the OPTS_TYPE_PT_GENERATE_LE is wrong, should be OPTS_TYPE_PT_GENERATE_BE. See src/interface_migrate.c for original settings. After change, please update PR. I think you can 1:1 transfer it settings from interface_migrate.c. If 1:1 transfer is not possible, something else has to be changed first. Keep in mind the interface is very fresh :)\nIdeally also add the unit test tools/test_modules/m01700.pm then you can automate the check.\n. Please note https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/e453a9dc04ceabee9669e1d9eae3604218a1e3b6. Please note https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/31822a9bea0f503ef4c8a17e697ecacf38d0fa0d. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/dd293f7a938dc2188fef3b5e17fa8fdb9eabdc71. I just wanted to implement this but now I had some new thoughts. If we replace the fixed value 32 with a value which is the correct one for the current attack the user selected, then it's also possible the user gets a wrong impression. \nFor example, in md5crypt we are limited to Password length 15 in optimized mode. If we display the value 15 instead of the 32 in the warning message, the user (especially the new ones) maybe do not realize the 15 is valid only for the current attack, but generally for using -O.\nThe only way out I currently see is to not name any limits. For example, calling it like this:\nATTENTION! Pure (unoptimized) OpenCL kernels selected.\nThis enables cracking passwords and salts of shorter lengths but for the price of drastically reduced performance.\nIf you want to switch to optimized OpenCL kernels, append -O to your commandline.\nI'm not perfectly happy with this. Maybe there's a better way to explain? What do you think @s3inlc @roycewilliams ?. This looks even more complicated and overwhelming to new users. I'll use the generalized message type.. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/4653447dfad1427d9c809529e49c9d0d72a656e9. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/5da1e4b87266dd893d334ae27852c0c29d802b9d. Probably the GPU driver. Please append -D 1 to try with the CPU driver. Please post results here. In your case you have to remove the -d.. Please retry with latest version from github master. Make sure to run \"make clean\" before recompiling.. The problem should be fixed with the latest GitHub master. Feel free to reopen if fixes did not work for you.. > Is it preferred to remove the code for the hashmode from interface.migrate.c ?\nAbsolutely. Also interface_migrate.h\n\nAnd does the hashmode need to be added anywhere else in the code?\n\nIn this case, no. For other conversion modules, we also need to add unit test module where it does not exist.\nFor the time after conversion when we add truely new modes we still need to edit the files:\ndocs/readme.txt\ndocs/changes.txt\n. There's a couple of errors in the module. I'll merge this now and fix the errors with the idea to make it easier to spot the changes needed.. Here's the commit which can be used to spot the missing changes: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/3b9a26c9f609f20e1720b3b757bfb15c134b124d\n\nRemoved old code from interface_migrate.c\nFixed typo in HASH_NAME\nAdded OPTS_TYPE_STATE_BUFFER_LE (new option) which helps the decoder_apply_options() function to decide if it has work to do. Currently it is active only for OPTS_TYPE_STATE_BUFFER_BE\nRemoved salt_t *salt = hash_buf->salt; from old parser function. The variable is set as fixed parameter in the function declaration\nModified u32 digest = (u32 ) digest_buf; because digest_buf is now void *. This way we can easily switch between u32 and u64. The same goes for esalt and the hash-mode specific esalt structures\nFixed compiler warning related to input_tokenizer(). This is something I will maybe change in the future and switch it back to char * but for now let's stick to u8 *\nif (hashconfig->opti_type & OPTI_TYPE_PRECOMPUTE_MERKLE) { ... } : This branch is now handled inside the decoder_apply_optimizer() function and the opposite function for the encoder also exists.\nif (hashconfig->opts_type & OPTS_TYPE_ST_HASH_MD5) { ... } : I will remove this option type as it is relevant only for two or three hash-mode specific parser functions. For them we will add this branch directly into their decoder functions.\n\nPlease make sure the module compiles cleanly and and the self-test does not fail before sending the PR.\n. Probably the GPU driver. Please append -D 1 to try with the CPU driver. Please post results here.. Please retry with latest version from github master. Make sure to run \"make clean\" before recompiling.. Should be fixed with the latest GitHub master version. Feel free to reopen if fixes did not work for you.. Looks like all information required has been given. Please feel free to reopen if needed.. I think is happening to bitsliced kernels only. For example combination -a 3 and -m 1500. Other attack modes or other hash modes should not trigger it. Can you confirm?. I don't think this is related. MD5 and SHA1 are not bitsliced. Only DEScrypt (in -a 3 mode) is.. I tried all of the attacks on different development systems. It never occurred. Please retry with the latest version from GitHub master or https://hashcat.net/beta/\n. This is a bad Idea. The compiler will compile the code from for example src/shared.c into the module binary. The module size will grow and the they will have (eventual) different code from src/shared.c in case the module was compile for an older version of hashcat (this is a situation in the future). It's better to let modules use functions from host binary instead, which is why I've add -Wl,--export-dynamic in the first place. This concept works fine on linux using gcc and clang, so I hoped it also worked on OSX. It does not work on windows however, therefore I've add the exception on windows.\nOther fixes like dnclen please make them separate PR and I'll merge them.\n. Maybe you can find a different solution which does not involve compiling the code into the module. That would be great. I cannot check since I do not have OSX computer.. I'm not so happy to edit source code from other projects. Instead I pushed this this alternative solution:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/05b71b6bc06e5dd811b0bbb06ea58a3946aa0d54\nI hope it works on OSX as well.. Please read https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/38e97bd89ada27dd07c74046889b102b34686781/docs/limits.txt#L25-L41. Thanks!. Thanks! There's a lot of invalid removals, probably because you confused sha2-224 with sha3-224? Please double check everything, especially if you actually used keccak_224_parse_hash(). This function usually does not have any optimizers like -= SHA224M_A therefore assume the wrong function was converted.. Perfect, thanks!. How is that possible that the problem is solved without us doing anything to the code?. Fixed with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/e571b890e9175f6fbc0c52c86f534ed1f4f69d6c. Thanks!\nPlease note: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/d266cb5834eea416a02f1f08db939b46b0a7a28f\nError was in original migrate file.\n. Yes, you are right. They are affected in the same way. We need to do the same fix for them.. Many thanks!. It exists, please ask on hashcat Forum.. Not sure why there's a conflict. I just merged the PR in the correct order.. Please fix the conflict first or close this PR and open a new one?. Nevermind I fixed the conflicts inline.\nThanks for PR!. Please ask on hashcat forum. Double post, please continue here: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-8112-post-43528.html#pid43528. It's not a hashcat problem. The fan speed readings are not supported by the underlaying API (nvml) for your device. You might want to use something like afterburner to control them.. Almost OK. Two things:\n\nOPTS_TYPE_STATE_BUFFER_LE is missing\nWriting into existing buffers is unsafe. That's why it's defined as const salt_t *salt.\n\nsalt_buf_ptr[salt->salt_len - 8] = 0;\nPlease create new temporary buffer instead, copy the salt data, then do the modification on there.\n. Make sure to install the correct OpenCL runtime (Intel OpenCL runtime from their site!). Probably you have the wrong one (or two, and using the wrong one).. Thanks for clarify. The problem with the -m 1100 is that this mode does not require a comb mode to be set. \nThe comb mode is only to be set if the same buffer is kernel for both password and salt.\nFixed here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/b9365b89612320012632766e6ac3e51ca967897d. You can use -m 140:\nsha1($salt.utf16le($pass))\nMake sure to prepend the static 'PasswordCheckHash' to the PasswordSalt\n. See:\nroot@ht:~/hashcat# perl -e 'print \"PasswordCheckHash\" . pack (\"H*\", \"ec2a71fc6498810b\") . \"a\\0a\\0a\\0\"' | sha1sum  \n842d0bef6dbb0f060b337c6a9c7d6482a24978c0  -\nThis mean you need to do something like this:\n./hashcat -m 140 842d0bef6dbb0f060b337c6a9c7d6482a24978c0:50617373776f7264436865636b48617368ec2a71fc6498810b --hex-salt -a 3 aaa\n. Looks like the wrong mask, but a wrong mask is a user problem. Please ask on forum.. https://hashcat.net/forum. This is helping a lot, many thanks. @taliseen Can you please run the test which @philsmd was suggesting?. I just build hashcat (current master) on msys2. No problems.. I even tried using cygwin and hash-mode-plugin branch. It works without any problems. Please try harder.. I tried with the same OpenCL runtime (OpenCL for Intel CPU v18.1.0.013) on my i7-6700 CPU. It works fine.\nThe error 'CL_DEVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE' indicated that maybe this particular XEON CPU is not supported? Did you ever tried to run hashcat on this CPU before?\n. Yes, I agree. It should either work fine or not report back as valid OpenCL device.\nCan you try running any other OpenCL application on this CPU? If that fails, too it would be a strong indication that there's some sort of error in the Intel OpenCL runtime itself.\n. Good question actually. I just tried locally with this: https://github.com/krrishnarraj/clpeak and it worked fine. I'm pretty sure it will fail with the same error as hashcat did. Other than that I don't have any Idea what else to run.. Any Update here?. I've installed 18.10 Ubuntu using 4.18.0-15-generic and the Intel OpenCL runtime. No problems here! CPU is a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz. Maybe the CPU model is also relevant, not just the Kernel?. It turned out the problem is only with Ubuntu 18.10 in combination with 4.18.0 kernel and Intel OpenCL runtime and Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8168 CPU. Other OpenCL applications are affected as well. Not a hashcat error.. Please retry with latest version from github master. Make sure to run \"make clean\" before recompiling.. OK, but is the main problem fixed?. Did not see the trap: 6 curse for some time. Please try the same command but with -w 1 added.. You can also try if it's \"just\" the internal GPU and disable it. Use -d 3. With the latest version on GitHub master I added some workaround for option -d 1 and -d 2. At least the trap 6 should be avoided now automatically. Please confirm.. This is fixed with latest hashcat (you need to switch to the development branch during migration).\nmake clean\ngit checkout hash-mode-plugin\nmake. I'm merging this, just one note: The difference between the || and the // is if the value is \"0\". For || this is false, for // it is true. I had some problem with this in the past.. And thanks again, this really helps.. Please use hashtopolis issue, not hashcat.. Thanks again! Note: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a560b45705f4a2b9ed61d2ef27811cf7dea352fc\nIf there's no OpenCL/mxxxxx*optimized* kernel, then no need for optimized constraints.\nSame for OpenCL/mxxxxx*pure*, then no need for pure constraints.. Great! I'll add you to release notes for support, how do you want to be referenced?. Please create a new PR in that case.. I think it's also used in perl, not just Java. However the results are not matching. For example with the C code I do get 2163000881 (Decimal) as result for iceberg. Something is wrong, please verify everything again.. I found the reason. Your C code does not match the Java code. For example, the Java code does not have that initialization value 5381. Also the multiplier is 33, not 31.. What's the reason to have this in hashcat? It should be pretty easy to collide the hash. Please explain.. Wait, there's no way to reverse back the original string.\nFor example the strings:\nBA\nand \nA`\nthey both produce the same hash 0x0000083f. There's no way to tell which is the correct string.. OK, but then there are many collisions for the same hash possible. Do you have any plans on controlling the keyspace low enough so that the number of collisions is low enough to work with the result?\nCan you please give me a real life example where this obfuscation was used?. How about 64 bit version? How important would that be?. There's also a large number of possible optimizations. For example the last character can be detected automatically. How to handle that?. So I've pushed support for DJB (32 bit output) with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/51eb9ebff7bd9d5020b570f0297361296b5e2515\nIf you do not want to build from source you can use the beta on https://hashcat.net/beta/\nSimply because it was so easy to add. Anyway, this implementation does not include any optimizations such as the last letter can be reversed etc. I hope it does what you want to do with it.\nYou maybe want to use the --keep-guessing flag to see all collisions if there are any.\nIf you want some fun, try: ./hashcat -m 18700 -O -w 3 ffffffff -a 3 ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l --keep-guessing. Please note that I'll rename this algorithm to \"Java Object hashCode()\". The original DJB algorithm uses * 33 and not *31 plus it has an initialization value. Just to avoid confusion.. Please ask on hashcat forum. No, the password must have exactly length 64. I think you want to use -m 16800 not 16801.. Should be fixed. Please test and close issue. Thanks for reporting.. This sounds like if the cached kernel binary which is generated by the opencl runtime and which is stored in kernels/ is not useable. In the first run we use the binary compiled by the JiT, which could explain that the first run is working. \nAnyway, this behavior was not changed in any recent version. IOW, this never has worked before, correct?. The problem was fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/b99d392e78c92cd9e624c04f4c72eb4cb6c55849\nFeel free to reopen if fixes did not work for you. Thank you for reporting. Added with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/29fedf2c41bb54a982a270bf7bf754bee6496245\nYou can build from source or use the beta from here: https://hashcat.net/beta/. You can use the androidbackup2john.py from here https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/run/androidbackup2john.py. I think is the wrong OpenCL runtime. In order to use AMD CPU you need to install the Intel OpenCL runtime (not a joke). Anyway this is not a hashcat problem.. Should be fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/761475b224c5054e71d63c84a0cdb6dee8c5ee15\nThanks for reporting!. Please fix OpenCL runtime. Not a hashcat problem.. Hashcat is used to guess passwords. How is ECC related?. Feel free to reopen if there are more concrete details available.. Thanks for info! CC @magnumripper . Fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/0b1169e523d9247821d07cfb783b3a43f20c7ae7\nNew beta on https://hashcat.net/beta/\nThanks for reporting!. Fixed with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/f92ebc658691f629117e7c215c4d684fcd3bd8cb\nBinary beta was updated, too. Can you provide an example hash for each of the different decrypted data variants?. I've add the missing pattern with commit https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/a9bafb7edb49bbf40d097fecf19a5c4ee0620076. Which OS is this running on and which kernel?. I think the issue is that you using and AMD OpenCL runtime to the Intel CPU. If you'd use the Intel OpenCL runtime (this would be the correct one), how does it change?. Please retry with the latest version from GitHub master. Make sure to not use the \"install\" target and use ./hashcat instead. This ensures that hashcat will not search for (old) precompiled kernels in the $HOME/.hashcat folder structure.. Thanks for adding this mode. It was requested several times before! Some things need to be fixed first.\n\nThis mode differs from the original SHA256 raw hash implementation. Therefore it should get its own hash-mode number. I've reserved hash-mode 19800 for this. Please rewrite.\nI know that there's other applications than AuthMe using this mode. It would be therefore make more sense to have a general kernel and then use the 1980x number for the special applications using this mode.\nThe mode is raw and it is also salted at the same time. Therefore the kernel should get the name 19810, the Application AuthMe however should get the name 19811. You can call the 19810 from the 19811 module.\nA very similar structure can be found with the vbull mode (2611).  I recommend to use this mode as template.\nThe hash is doing only two iterations of SHA256. IOW, it's too fast to be marked as a slow hash (ATTACK_EXEC_OUTSIDE_KERNEL). It should use ATTACK_EXEC_INSIDE_KERNEL instead. This is required to achieve full GPU utilization. See mode 2611 as an example.\nYou can start writing the pure kernels only first. Hashcat accepts either pure kernels only, optimized kernels only, or both. In case you stick to pure kernel only, you can set the module constraints to 0,256 for both password and salt. However AuthMe seems to have a fixed 16 byte salt. In this case you can set the test module to 16,16. I just wanted to explain it generally.\nfor parsing the salt, please use the interface generic_salt_decode() and generic_salt_encode() in the module. See 2611 module as an example.\nThe DGST_SIZE      = DGST_SIZE_8_8; is invalid for 32 bit based hashes as SHA256. Use DGST_SIZE      = DGST_SIZE_4_8; instead. (The first 8 indicates that this is a 64 bit integer based hash)\nIf you configure DGST_POS0-DGST_POS3 correctly (see 1400 as an example) you can allow the JiT to auto optimize the early skip the last 3 steps in the last round of sha256. The marcros are transfered to the kernel automatically. If you stick to them in the kernel you dont need to care about them\n\n. So you've started using the same Kernel for \"19800\". This is fine so far! Does \"WIP\" mean work in progress?. Any updates here?. Any updates here?. The unit test successfully finished. Please change the code as requested in the two sections. I'll merge afterward.. Thanks!. Hi There. thanks for creating that issue. Please follow there following steps:\n\nRetry with the latest version either by compiling yourself from Github master or by using the binary beta from https://hashcat.net/beta/\nIf the problem still exists, please retry the same test with the JtR\nIf the problem still exists, please provide all the files we need to reproduce locally. It's normal. You can workaround using slow candidates mode. Use -S. OK, use this:\n\nhashcat64.exe -a 6 ../areacodes.txt ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d --stdout | hashcat64.exe -m 2500 hash.hccapx. Nothing to add here, we can do this.. I'm not sure if this is of any practical use. For example, if you have a hash list of two (or more) -salted- hashes. During the attack, one of them gets cracked. This means the estimated runtime will reduce by 50%.. OK, I understood that already. But the ETA would be wrong in the scenario I've described. How does it help?. Can you please explain what you mean with swapping and how to reproduce this?. This is interesting because the change is only relevant for AMD GPU:\nif (... && (device_param->platform_vendor_id == VENDOR_ID_AMD))\nThe memory check (which is done afterward) was already part of hashcat before. The change just moved it to a different position in the code execution chain. That's why I do not understand how hashcat 5.1.0 release version worked for you.\n. ok, will do after merge\n. should be fine, thanks for cross check @magnumripper \n. I've merged the original version from @matrix but it would be nice if you can send in a PR with the easier to read version you've posted in the comment, too.. not true. What is YMMV. If you do an example for example0.hash, the -m mode is always 0. Removing word-wrap please. OK, remove it.. The TOKEN_ATTR_FIXED_LENGTH is ideal for hashes when there is no separator character (like descrypt) while at the same time there are still different columns. The macro name maybe is not ideal to reflect that, but TOKEN_ATTR_VERIFY_LENGTH is correct use here.. The perl module does not work as expected, therefore we just set it to fixed zero. You can remove it and use sprintf (\"%08x:00000000\", $digest); . This should do it:\nconst int line_len = snprintf (line_buf, line_size, \"%08x:%08x\", digest[0], salt->salt_buf[0]);. All eventual errors which you get with this mode are because of some error in test.sh. However your math in the constraints is correct, you have the right understanding. Basically it always goes back to the kernel code. If you are unsure, use the single or passthrough to generate some examples and try them manually.. Please rephrase, I don't understand. The use of sha1_update_vector typically requires to use sha1_ctx_vector_t type not sha1_ctx_t type. In this case, it works because you disabled the SIMD by commenting out NEW_SIMD_CODE. I would switch it either to sha1_ctx_vector_t or sha1_update(). Up to you.. It's possible that this could be misunderstood by the OpenCL runtime and initialize all elements in the array with the value 0x2d2d0000 not just the first one. Please rewrite this as\nconst u32 glue[16] = { 0x2d2d0000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };\nin all kernels.. You can increase the performance by another 50% in -a 3 mode (probably also -a0 and -a1) if you optimize the strategy of the kernel a bit.\nBefore entering the inner loop you can precompute the following:\n```\n  // precompute some stuff\nsha1_ctx_t ctx0;\nsha1_init (&ctx0);\nsha1_update (&ctx0, k, site_key_len);\n  sha1_update (&ctx0, glue, 2);\n  sha1_update (&ctx0, s, salt_len);\n  sha1_update (&ctx0, glue, 2);\n```\n. To make use of the precomputation you can do use instead:\n```\n    sha1_ctx_t ctx = ctx0;\nsha1_update (&ctx, w, pw_len);\nsha1_update (&ctx, glue, 2);\nsha1_update (&ctx, k, site_key_len);\n\nsha1_final (&ctx);\n\n```. At this position you can hardcode the glue, it will always be at exactly this point.\n```\n      ctx.w2[2] = glue[0];\n  ctx.len = 40 + 2;\n\n```. Here's a fully optimized kernel -a3. I'm sure you can backport most of the improvements to -a0 and -a1:\nhttps://pastebin.com/cHFu55ys. This would only change the behavior in case the user is using the --keep-guessing command line argument. \nThere are however modules which automatically enable the keep-guessing flag automatically, such as 9720 and 18100 and others. Those would not be covered with this test. Please replace this test with the following and we should be good:\nif (hashconfig->opts_type & OPTS_TYPE_PT_NEVERCRACK) return 0;\nThe reason why this will also cover the use of --keep-guessing on the command line is best explained here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/interface.c#L347-L350. Debugging leftover?. Debugging leftover?. In this case, salt->salt_len should be set to 8, since we only set salt->salt_buf[0] and salt->salt_buf[1]. This is only to make the unique salt sorting in hashcat working correctly to remove duplicate salts.. I think you should be able to move\nsha1_update_global_swap (&ctx, pws[gid].i, pws[gid].pw_len);\nto the outer loop (into ctx0). It doesn't change inside the inner loop.. ",
    "epixoip": "This has my signoff as well. @jsteube please merge to master if you approve.\n. Intel GPUs are not likely to be much if at all faster than CPU, which is one of the reasons we never bothered to support them.\n. That link doesn't really say anything of value.\nLet's look at it this way: current top-of-the-line Intel GPUs have up to 384 cores which run at up to 1100 Mhz, and lack instructions that help reduce instruction count for many hash functions (nothing similar to bitselect, bitalign, LOP3.LUT, etc.) So basically these will be almost identical in speed very low-end pre-Maxwell Nvidia GPUs.\nFor example, the Iris Pro 6200 would be about as fast as a GT 640, which yields a staggering 450 MH/s on raw MD5. And by \"staggering,\" I mean that's 23 times slower than a GTX 970. And that's for their top of the line GPU, if you have something like an HD4200 then it would be more like 50 times slower than a GTX 970. \nSo this is why we've never cared about adding Intel GPU support. Even their fastest GPUs are about the same speed as high-end CPUs. \n. 525 H/s @ 5W. Meanwhile a GTX 970 gets 180000 H/s @ 135W.  That's 105 H/W vs 1333 H/W. So that's both poor performance AND poor perf/Watt. \n. Sorry, all I saw was \"#1: 'CUDA-Device #1 'GK20A'': 525.1 PMKs/s (RTT 2.8)\". But even 6203 H/s falls short in the perf/W category, and well short in perf/$ as well. You'd need 29 of these boards to match the speed of one GTX 970 for a cost of $5600 vs $320.\nHistorically we've had zero interest in underpowered / poor-performing hardware. I suppose that's because in our view, Hashcat is for serious professionals, and serious professionals have real hardware. I know JtR aims to be compatible with pretty much anything and everything, but I personally do not see our focus shifting away from serious use cases.\n. JtR is the acronym we frequently use to refer to John the Ripper.\n. There's already another ticket open for Mesa (#71). And those failures appear to be Mesa's fault, not oclHashcat's. Remember that the state of Gallium is not at all mature and their OpenCL platform is not production-ready. Still a whole lot of red/orange on this chart, even for GCN https://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/GalliumCompute/\n. Sure, I think what atom meant was all the work necessary to make oclHashcat work with any OpenCL library has already been done, and thus the ticket can be closed. \n. Only with -m 400 or other algorithms as well?\n. Ok to commit\n. Looks good, I'll provide my signoff for this\n. It's MIT license...\n. Benchmark uses the highest workload profile (-w 3). If you want low resource utilization you should use the lowest workload profile (-w 1) while actually cracking.\n. Looks sane, ok to merge.\n. This might be something to consider for the future as ARM pushes its way into the server market, but right now there's real no value in supporting ARM (not to say we would reject PRs from someone who adds ARM support, just not something we would likely focus on adding.) You're far more likely to see POWER support before ARM. \n. Oh, I'm sorry, for some reason I thought we were talking about Hashcat, not oclHashcat (probably because otherwise the topic makes no sense :wink:). I did indeed have NEON and AltiVec in mind when i wrote that comment. But yes you're of course correct, cross compiling oclHashcat for ARM should already be possible today. \n. As we've discussed on IRC a couple times, POWER is potentially worth supporting. I don't know if there will be a CPU OpenCL driver (would be really sweet if there were), but at the very least Nvidia have joined the OpenPOWER consortium, so you will see affordable POWER servers with Nvidia GPUs in the near future.\n. Way outside the scope of this project. If you want to work on this, go for it. But it doesn't even seem like something that would be desirable, let alone possible, for oclHashcat.\nFurther, these types of questions are better suited for the forums, not a Github Issue. \n. Ok to merge\n. Looks like you have more than one libOpenCL on your system, and oclHashcat is picking up the wrong one. Should only have one libOpenCL, and that should be the one installed by AMD Catalyst. \ndpkg -l | egrep -i 'nvidia|fglrx|opencl'\nfind / -name libOpenCL*\n. Ok to merge\n. Ok to merge \n. VCL hasn't been touched in almost 3 years. It's a dead project. \n. VCL is just a grad school project so I assume interest in it will peak and fade as students come and go. \n. You should be using prince_generated.rule or prince_optimized.rule when piping pp into oclHashcat.\n. There are several issues with this PR:\n1. You did not follow the \"Solve only one problem in each pull request\" rule.\n2. The --session-dir stuff is already obsolete based on other recent changes.\n3. Getting rid of the typedef bool is not the way to fix that problem. \n. You might want to double-check that attachment, you uploaded much more than just two samples of the same key.\n. Why would you open this bug report here, and not with ArchLinux? \n. Cracking NetLM is already supported via -m 3000 and -m 1000, this would be just adding support for this particular format string (like when we added pwdump format.) \n. To clarify, this ticket is only for recovering the MD4 hash from an MS-CHAP hash; if you're looking to just crack MS-CHAP directly, this algorithm is already supported via -m 5500. https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-5052.html\n. With that algorithm you do not need GPU acceleration, you can just use http://strcpy.io/md5substr.c  I've been working on adding this code to Hashcat, but you don't have to wait for that for what you're doing.\n. That's plenty fast enough for a 3-byte collision. You should have already found dozens of collisions at that rate.\nThis is on my laptop:\nTarget......:  a1b2c3\nOffset......:  0\nFound.......:  106\nSpeed/sec...:  25.60 MH/s current, 30.40 MH/s average\nProgress....:  1824000000/60170087060757 (0.00%)\nRunning.....:  60 sec\n106 collisions found in 60 seconds at 30 MH/s. At 6 MH/s you should find ~21 collisions per minute.\n. ADL SDK is needed to enable hardware monitoring and fan control for AMD GPUs. Without this you will not be able to see GPU temp or fan speed.\nIf you cannot simply build with ADL SDK without distributing ADL SDK, then my suggestion is to not distribute a source package, or to not build from source. Simply download the binary release from hashcat.net as you've done with other releases in the past. \n. This looks sane, ok to merge\n. Why do you feel this must be done upstream?\n. it is my opinion that downstream can compile with whatever flags they like, and an issue should only be opened with upstream if the build fails when enabling some compiler flag. Then upstream can evaluate if there is a bug that needs to be fixed in the code, or if downstream should simply not use that flag. \n. ^ that's the proper way to do it\n. I don't think it will be an issue. If anything it should be less confusing rather than more confusing.\n. Are you root?\n. I understand your concern @magnumripper, but I think you're conflating \"open source\" with \"community-driven.\" Hashcat is obviously open source; however, while contributions from the community are appreciated, Hashcat is not a community-driven project.\nThe Hashcat development model is top-down, with @jsteube functioning as the BDFL and the core team members (@philsmd, @gm4tr1x, @Xanadrel, @dropdeadfu, and myself) functioning as the project directors. Control of the development process and decision making authority are retained by the group of aforementioned individuals; they have neither been passed down nor delegated to the community. So it is only natural that this \"little club\" would have a place to meet and discuss the project in private.\nThe upside of this model should be quite obvious, magnum... please do not make me state it.\n. If you need more than one block of input and don't care about the speed loss, then you're probably just better off using OpenSSL on CPU.\n. Holy shit dude, do you intend to write a comment on this every day?\n. We probably need a timeout patch for Intel like we do with Nvidia. \n. Yes, this is already covered on our wiki: http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=timeout_patch\n. Maybe if this has changed for CPU then it's also changed for MIC? If not, can we put something in the .hctab to fix this?\n. Yes, this can be overridden on the command line with --opencl-vector-width and also in the new .hctab file. \n. Cool, go ahead and make one and submit a PR.\n. Nicely done, this is ok to merge\n. Fantastic job, ok to merge!\n. Ouch, yeah, please merge!\n. What is the plaintext password for the above wallet?\nThe scrypt parameters used here are extremely unfriendly to GPUs, this would likely only be able to run on CPU.\n. Questions like this belong on the forums, not on Github. \n. Again, this is an issue for the Hashcat Forums, not Github. But this typically means your OpenCL environment is not set up correctly, or driver is not installed properly. See the Hashcat Wiki for help and if you still need assistance, ask on the forums.\n. I don't understand why you would open an issue on Github for this problem, especially when you're using the release version and didn't test against the code that's actually in Github (cudaHashcat doesn't even exist in this repository anymore.) Questions like this belong on the forums or IRC.\nAnyway this error is addressed in our FAQ, http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#what_does_the_cumoduleload_301_error_mean\n. You have an old GPU that has been supported by oclHashcat for nearly 3 years now, so that is definitely not applicable in this case. \n301 == \"File Not Found\" so either you're not using \"7z x\" to extract the archive, or you're trying to run cudaHashcat from outside of its directory, or something along those lines. But either way it is an issue with your setup and not a bug in cudaHashcat, and therefore a bug report should not be opened for it -- especially when cudaHashcat doesn't even exist in this Github repository anymore.\nIRC channel is listed on our website.\n. Defining your own salt length isn't really possible because max salt length is hardcoded into the implementation of the algorithm, that's why jsteube said you'd have to write a new kernel to support this functionality. And generic algorithms with no length limitations are the antithesis of Hashcat.\n. You can't just change the salt length. You have to write a completely new SHA512 implementation that can support that large of an input. \n. Both are correct, those two statements are not mutually exclusive.\n. Github issues should only be opened against the code that's actually in Github. cudaHashcat no longer exists, so please try latest oclHashcat beta or build from source, and if the problem persists, open an issue at that time. Thanks!\n. This question is best asked on our forums\n. md5(md5(p).s) is already supported by -m 2711. Oh, but it expects a 30-char salt doesn't it. We could probably just add a generic md5(md5(p).s) mode that isn't optimized for vBull. \n. That's a cipher, not a hash, and you aren't going to crack a 256 bit AES key.\n. Ok but this is hashcat, not ciphercat\n. Hashcat targets the use of a password-based key derivation function in that algorithm, not AES itself.\n. This type of question also belongs on the forums, not on Github.\nNote that Github Issues is only for filing bug reports or requesting new features! If you need help or want to discuss a topic, please use the forums. Thanks!\n. This type of question belongs on the forums, not on Github. \n. This is not a bug report or a feature request, so this type of question belongs on the forums not on Github. Please close this issue.\n. Forums is a more appropriate place, but just real quick: you would be much better off installing the official Intel OpenCL runtime.\n. I've always used ''-o /dev/null'' to accomplish this ever since hashcat got potfile support. \n. Why are you filing a bug report for cudaHashcat 2.01? cudaHashcat doesn't even exist anymore.. This isn't a hashcat issue, there is nothing we can do to \"support virtualized environments.\" Your beef is either with ESXi's VGA passthrough, or with the Nvidia driver, or a combination of both. May even be a buggy IOMMU on your motherboard triggering a bug in either of those as well, or perhaps your IOMMU is not fully supported by ESXi. VGA passthrough is very experimental and only a handful of hardware support it properly, there are simply too many variables for us to attempt to help you troubleshoot your setup. Or, you know, you could actually just be out of resources (have you actually checked that?) Anyway, regardless of what is triggering this, it is emphatically not a hashcat issue. . VT-d has been around for a while, yes. But it is also broken on a lot of motherboards (BIOS doesn't implement it at all, or implements it incorrectly, or has corrupt/missing/incomplete IVRS tables), and even broken in some chipsets (e.g. broken interrupt remapping) and CPUs as well (Intel shipped an entire generation of CPUs with a bad VT-d implementation, and I don't think AMD-Vi has ever actually worked.) So while the concept isn't new, it's not something that's actually widely supported.\nThat said, I'm not aware of any issues with Ivy Bridge-E or C602, but there may be issues still with the BIOS on your board, I don't know. I do know that our Gen2 Brutalis platform had the same C602 chipset you have, and I remember experiencing constant ASIC hangs and Oopses. But that very well may have been a software issue, not a hardware issue.\nSorry, but VGA passthrough is indeed still in its infancy (and do not conflate PCI passthrough with VGA passthrough.) ESXi certainly has better support than Xen or KVM, but the last time I tried to use it (ESXi 5.5, Xen 4.2), it was either really buggy or entirely nonoperational on all of my boards.\n\"There are not 'too many variables'\" -> \"just a generic error message when any number of problems go wrong.\" Do I even need to comment on this?\nDon't accuse us of not consulting documentation. We practically have that entire documentation memorized.\nDriver timeout is hardly a bug in hashcat, the issue has been well-documented on our Wiki for several years, which even includes both a registry patch and an xorg.conf patch. ~~Hashcat even tries to warn you if this patch has not been applied.~~ Never mind, looks like we removed the warning in 3.20 as we didn't feel it was necessary any longer with autotuning.  I suppose it is possible that autotuning is not very accurate in a virtualized environment. You could always try using a lower -w value if the timeout patch doesn't resolve the issue and you're intent on using hashcat in a vm. But I'm still not convinced this will actually fix anything. I've not had a single positive experience with VGA passthrough so I'm still leaning toward the issue lying somewhere in there.\nRegardless, still not a bug in hashcat.. This is not an \"issue\", the topic is clearly more appropriate for the forums. Please start a thread there instead.. See if https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=timeout_patch resolves this for you, and please report back to let us know if it did or did not work.\nWhen using CUDA we used to see error 702 (CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT). Based on a few other people's reports, it appears Nvidia's OpenCL just returns -5 (CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES ) for the same condition. Probably because OpenCL doesn't define any sort of timeout error code like CUDA does. I think -2 (CL_DEVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE) may have been a more appropriate equivalent, but I don't work at Nvidia so my opinion doesn't count ;). This is question is more appropriate for hashcat forums than github issues.. --pw-min and --pw-max have been renamed --increment-min and --increment-max. They never had any affect on any attack mode other than ''-a 3 -i'', so the new nomenclature is more correct.\n-k only works with -a 1 and -a 7. Maybe you want -r instead?. It would actually be '<8' not '>8'. But yeah now that you mention it, I don't think the reject rules have been ported to OpenCL because it's too slow. It's actually faster to hash unnecessary candidates than it is to try to reject them.. ",

    "magnumripper": "IMHO, regardless of Intel GPUs' current state there's really no reason for Hashcat not to \"work\" with just any OpenCL device. Instead you could just state that only AMD is actively \"supported\" and/or that the OpenCL code is optimized for AMD and YMMV.\nSo I think we should look into wrapping AMD-specific stuff (just guessing there is some) in #ifdef blocks and provide some alternative \"generic\" alternative. Once it builds and runs on nvidia (as an alternative to CUDA) it should also run fine on Iris or crappy AMD APU's - as well as on some really cool FPGA board with OpenCL abstraction layer...\nI haven't looked much at the code base yet so I'm mostly assuming things here.\n. In fact it might save you a lot of time and work if you (eventually) ditch all CUDA stuff and go all-in for OpenCL. Unless there are some clear cases where CUDA can be significantly faster?\n. In JtR we use function-like macros for \"overloading\". Too bad the typeof keyword is not mandatory in OpenCL - that would have been perfect. Most drivers support it though (including AMD, nvidia and Apple) but Intel does not (well some of their drivers do).\n. @shellster is that thing usable in real life? That is a sincere question, I'm not bashing. What's the performance?\nThere's no need to actually ditch the working CUDA code. Sure, the tree would be much easier to maintain without CUDA but you could keep the kernels for a while and just separate the builds: Stop calling them \"nvidia\" and \"amd\" and instead call them what they really are: \"cuda\" and \"opencl\". That is what we do in JtR although in that case, the CUDA stuff is mostly laughable.\n. I believe there are still plenty of bugs in Beignet. We've had issues in JtR about Beignet but as far as I can remember, all of them were their bugs, not ours. I expect these to be the same - it will eventually work better. BTW it got a LOT better just during last year.\nHaving said that, odd platforms like Beignet are good for finding \"edge cases\" or in our/your code that can be improved, or code that are actually \"undefined behavior\" but happen to work fine on many platforms.\n. According to http://hashcat.net/forum/thread-4761-post-26977.html#pid26977 it's 25-30% for 290X.\nI don't think the GPU memory is too small, we've run JtR like that (all 4096 kernels JIT compiled once using fake hashes, and obviously we cache them forever for re-use). The startup time for 4096 salts (even with cached kernels) is horrible though. We even experimented with threaded JIT compiles: Since make -sj32 for a normal C build is so much faster we figured we'd see the same, but apparently it ended up serialized anyway with most vendors' drivers (when it worked at all).\n. Some old notes from a contest says loading all 4096 salts in JtR took 40 minutes first time (compiling) and less than one minute after that (cached). That was on Tahiti.\nActually having that many salts is uncommon of course. Even Gawker was \"just\" 3,844 salts.\n. IMHO that is the way to go, sooner or later.\n. Clearly? I actually read it as we should use tabs, with tab width set to 2. But I noticed the existing code does not use tabs.\nI'd express it as \"Uses no tabs and 2-character indentations\" (disregarding the fact I would personally prefer use of tabs).\n. > could I do a fork with SL3 support (completely unlinked -except the author and license- from this project)?\nThis is a puzzling question. The only one able to answer it is you.\n. Is that thing LE or BE as is? If it's LE, it should be a walk in the park supporting it.\n. Assuming this thing runs Linux, I can't see anything needing changing at all? We already have a target for Linux (possibly assuming LE) and I see no SIMD intrinsics or assembler used anywhere.\n. You could obviously do something like this (given there is some macro(s) usable for selecting platforms where this does improve performance).\n``` c\nif this_or_that\nconst u32x w0s07___w0s12 = w0s07 ^ w0s12;\nelse\ndefine w0s07___w0s12 w0s07 ^ w0s12\nendif\n```\nIt'd still not be a 100% no-op for the else clause (due to different ordering) but that should not be much of a problem.\n. I'll do some experimenting, will report back.\n. I'm simply hoping the reason it's not been touched in years is that it works like a champ [for nvidia]. I'm assuming they just gave up on AMD's crappy drivers that introduce new bugs with every release. We'll see. The libOpenCL.so: no version information available is a benign warning that can be ignored.\nI had a look at SnuCL some time ago but it's much less transparent. IIRC you need to compile with MPI and I guess you'd need lots of special code in oclHashcat. For VCL, all magic is in the OpenCL layer, not the application.\n. That's worse. But using nvidia and latest oHC source, I guess it shouldn't be a problem.\n. I did some testing with VCL 1.22 with poor results. And then... wow, just as I was going to ask the developers whether they abandoned the project, they released VCL 1.23 - after 2.5 years of silence. Changelog:\n- Works with OpenCL 1.2 or higher.\n- Added the following functions of OpenCL version 1.2:\n  - clEnqueueFillBuffer()\n  - clEnqueueFillImage()\n  - clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects()\n  - clCreateImage() (no new image types yet beyond OpenCL 1.1)\n  - clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties() (no new options yet beyond OpenCL 1.1)\n  - clEnqueueMarkerWithWaitList()\n  - clEnqueueBarrierWithWaitList()\n- Deleted bypass code for some ATI bugs that were fixed.\n- Updated the instructions for connecting with Slurm.\n- Bug fixes.\nWho knows what \"Bug fixes\" might include, but anyway I will test this ASAP.\n. BTW @jsteube I think you mentioned clKernelArgIsMemoryObject in earlier VCL discussions. I can't remember the details and the trac discussion is gone now. Curiously enough Google hasn't heard of clKernelArgIsMemoryObject... what was that?\n. Several problems, mostly not dramatic:\n- VCL has a hard time sourcing header files from kernels. It's easy to understand why it's a problem and a variant of it is seen with JtR too. If you pass a path with -I in OpenCL build options, that path should be absolute and has to be valid from every node's viewpoint (eg. a shared directory for oclHashcat). Ultimately it's a problem with VCL and only for JIT compilation.\n- When run with NV devices (352.39), clCreateContext() fails \"CL_DEVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE\" after the node's VCL daemon (opencld) segfaults. This seems to be a pure VCL problem.\n- When run with AMD devices, Hashcat thinks vendor is \"generic\" so tries to define its own amd_bytealign() function. This clashes with the real one so the build aborts with error. The problem is you are using the platform vendor - using the device vendor would problably solve a bunch of problems.\nI tried a quick hack in oclHashcat so it assumed AMD vendor for VCL, and this introduced another problem: clGetDeviceInfo() -30 (CL_INVALID_VALUE). This is from using proprietrary AMD extension CL_DEVICE_WAVEFRONT_WIDTH_AMD that VCL doesn't support. Hacking that away (allowing failure and falling back to a hardcoded default), VCL basically \"works\" with AMD although I didn't really test it properly yet. Anyway you will probably need to keep track of platform vendor as well as device vendor and use the \"right\" one for each operation. For things like \"amd_bytealign\" you need to look at device vendor [per device], but for using proprietrary parameters you may need to keep using platform vendor (or simply handle errors and fall back to sane defaults).\nI may end up with a PR sooner or later. I emailed VCL developers about the -I and nvidia issues.\n. I'll try to test this within a week.\n. Nah, but please keep this open. VCL is evolving very very slowly but I do have some (even slower) communication with the authors. Rest assured I'm on this. VCL, when it works, is awesome.\n. A really fast implementation would have (at least) some inner loop on GPU... but like we discussed before it's certainly not trivial.\n. I'm extremely improductive at the moment but I'll have a look sooner or later unless someone beats me to it. The recent OpenCL changes have paved the way, should be very easy now.\nRight now though, Apple's OpenCL drivers are very crappy. They were perfectly fine with JtR prior to El Capitan but now we see segfaults, incorrect results and whatnot.\n. Sure, many combinations of formats/devices does work fine, but far from all of them. There was a major regression for El Capitan.\n. RAR5 is simpler than RAR3, it's standard PBKDF2-SHA256 and no UTF-16.\n. Have a look at JtR for complete code, including early-rejection code that is required for speed. You also need a lot of unrar-code, we nicked it from clamAV. You probably need to do all but the 256K SHA-1 on CPU side.\n. I whipped up a JtR plug today but didn't commit it yet: We should agree on an input format to use so we don't end up different. kirbi2john.py currently outputs this from the attached file:\n$ ./kirbi2john.py 1-40a00000-gtremblay@http~WIN-SS.ettic.ca~80-ETTIC.CA.kirbi \n$krb5tgs$unkown:3be794d602ed567c5fcd1b4cee7eb065$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\nThis is problematic in that it includes a :.

And if so, what is the maximum?\n. The best way to support this and other algorithms is to supply more samples! Ideally several per algorithm and from different networks and always with a known password of course.\nOh, and I've got another question (as long I only got the one sample a.zip attached above): I found the known plaintext 20............Z starting at cleartext[107] (while krb5pa has it at cleartext[14]). The latter is a fixed position but given only one sample I'm not 100% sure this one is? If it isn't, it probably will be faster not bothering with the known-plain optimization.\n. > Concerning AES, we could try to implement this ones too, but I don't know if this worths as this would be extremely slow and hard to implement using SIMD\nVectorized RC4 is also impossible to implement. But it's not a problem since it's so fast anyway and you can do parts of an algo vectorized and parts of it with scalar code.\n. @Fist0urs made me aware there is already a krb5tgs format in JtR (I didn't know/remember that). But that format is untagged, just <hex checksum>$<hex data>. I still think we should add some tag like krb5tgs$23$at minimum. Besides, the $23$ is relevant, isn't it? If we implement the other algos they will have other numbers, right?\n. FYI it turns out we've had reports (https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/issues/1838) that max size of eadata should be at least 20480.\nAlso, the \"known plain\" trick is unfeasible because the timestamp's offset does vary. I guess doing some variant of memmem() would be slower than just always doing a complete calculation.\n. We could establish some input syntax right now, for a starter. Something like\n```\n$RC4$*\neg.\n$RC4$40256deadcafe0531337cafebabeccbbaa00*08090a0b\n```\nWould that suffice? Do we need some more field(s)?. This is the same algorithm as the already implemented C/R NTLMv1 and has same opportunity to BF the 3rd DES and then run crazy fast. Only the input parsing differs.\n. @p1pkin not sure what you mean but see https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-2563.html (referenced in the thread epixoip mentioned). But if you're looking for finding a full 56-bit DES key I'm afraid 5500 wont help you at all.\n. Your 400MH/s figure is for descrypt, which is 25xDES. For cracking your DES key I think oclHashcat would do over 20 GH/s per GPU if someone wrote a format for it. With some help (volunteers) that key may well be cracked in a few days.\n. I think you should base it on m3000 (LM) for a starter.\n. Any number of CPU cores will still report as one single device (just like a GPU may have 3000 cores).\nI haven't given up on VCL just yet so I will test this sooner or later.\n. You already use dlopen() so I suppose you actually just need some ADL and NVML headers to be able to build. Redistributing [parts of] them ought to fall under fair use.\n. I just had a look at how it was done in JtR (two years ago, couldn't remember). For NV, we don't seem to have any whole file from their SDK, just a bunch of defines and declarations in our own header and that's it. Possibly copied from nvapi.h from their SDK but I really can't remember. I might have nicked it from https://github.com/gat3way/hashkill.\nFor AMD it looks like we simply provide straight copies of adl_structures.h, adl_sdk.h and adl_defines.h from whatever ADL SDK was released at the time. One could probably just pick the need-to-know from those files like we did for NV - but OTOH why bother.\n. I can't see any point of a plugin since you already use dlopen. The AMD/NV libs themselves should be the plugins!\nTo make that happen you'd just add the four needed headers (or select parts of them) to the tree and drop those SDKs from the build deps. Then you're set. If user doesn't have any non-free stuff, dlopen wont find them so they simply wont be used (even for AMD/NV, a failing dlopen should be a soft failure and behave just like --gpu-temp-disable after possibly emitting a warning). If it does find them, they will be used. Simple as that.\n. If I understand you correctly, you can't distribute JtR Jumbo at all because we currently do provide the AMD headers in our source tree, and have done so for two years.\nIf I were to create an independent header file with an MIT license (for use by both projects) that has all glue we need for NV and AMD, would that solve this problem? If not, I give up.\n. BTW I abandoned the idea of creating a single file shared between JtR and oclHashcat. I did try that idea first, but adding it to ext_ADL.h and ext_nvml.h ended up much cleaner IMHO.\n. Here's a wonderful way to produce a version string (here applied in oclHashcat master branch):\n$ git describe --tags --dirty=+\nv2.01-289-gcd430d5\nWhat it says is\n- Name of latest tag/release (v2.01)\n- Number of commits past that tag (289)\n- And finally a commit hash prepended with g (cd430d5).\nNote that a dirty tree (uncommitted changes) would show as \"v2.01-289-gcd430d5+\" so you would know that it was based upon cd430d5.\n. You could tag each beta (as in 2.10b61) and it would be reflected in the version string. Actually you should do that - how else are you going to find a particular beta in the Git history if needed?\nUnfortunately Github will list ANY tag as a \"release\". But it should not matter much.\n. Good stuff! Works fine on my macbook.\n. > if you want some details send me a mail or write me in private dev channel\nSo much for open source. Oh well.\n. Of course you should discuss some things OOB but if you keep the rationale for design decisions secret it only makes it harder for anyone outside your little club to contribute code. I can't see the upside, but never mind me.\n. That is very tedious to achieve but obviously has some advantages. Hashkill does that. I had a look (long ago) at nicking that code but opted not to.\n. I saw this too when trying to make VCL work. If compilation fails first time for whatever reason, it will later use the 0 byte cache file (with results as above guaranteed) instead of retrying a compile.\n. Breath through your nose, young jedi.\n. We need that test for nvapi.h anyway, because it also (sort of) tells us that nvapi.lib (or nvapi64.lib) is there. Until we dynamically load that lib, there's no point in changing that stuff.\n. I guess it could work fine with Cygwin but not with MinGW until someone contributes some Windows specific code. I wouldn't care about that, they still have O_APPEND which is enough for casual use.\n. This patch is essential!\n. Build verified on Linux, Windows and OSX. Actual functionality is verified on Linux. If the file is already locked by another process, we'll simply wait until we get the lock.\n. Does it crash on MD4 already or what format is causing the hang? My HD4000 works just fine until an Abort trap: 6 in SHA-3(Keccak) (and that may just as well be an Apple driver bug).\n. ```\n$ ./oclHashcat.app -d2 -b\noclHashcat v2.01 (gd544cdb) starting in benchmark-mode...\nDevice #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3615QM CPU @ 2.30GHz, skipped\nDevice #2: HD Graphics 4000, 384/1536 MB allocatable, 1200Mhz, 16MCU\nDevice #3: GeForce GT 650M, skipped\nHashtype: MD4\nWorkload: 16 loops, 256 accel\nSpeed.Dev.#2.:   290.2 MH/s\nHashtype: MD5\nWorkload: 16 loops, 256 accel\nSpeed.Dev.#2.:   185.7 MH/s\nHashtype: Half MD5\nWorkload: 16 loops, 256 accel\nSpeed.Dev.#2.:   111.8 MH/s\nHashtype: SHA1\nWorkload: 16 loops, 256 accel\nSpeed.Dev.#2.: 68021.2 kH/s\nHashtype: SHA256\nWorkload: 16 loops, 256 accel\nSpeed.Dev.#2.: 26484.3 kH/s\nHashtype: SHA384\nWorkload: 16 loops, 256 accel\nSpeed.Dev.#2.:  8045.7 kH/s\nHashtype: SHA512\nWorkload: 16 loops, 256 accel\nSpeed.Dev.#2.:  7466.0 kH/s\nHashtype: SHA-3(Keccak)\nWorkload: 16 loops, 64 accel\nAbort trap: 6\n```\n.

I don't quite understand all these OSX ifdefs. Why are we doing anything special for OSX in this regard at all? It should be all about the target device and not about the OS: A Linux box might have a HD4000 and (at least theoretically) an OSX box might have a Titan X. Am I overlooking something obvious?\nOr put another way: If I boot my Macbook into Linux, why would the default loops/accel values change? The hardware did not.\n. I can now complete a benchmark of all formats with the HD4000, but it takes 45 minutes.

It was correct before, it's busted now.\n. > OpenCL devices are required to correctly track time across changes in device frequency and power states. The CL_DEVICE_PROFILING_TIMER_RESOLUTION specifies the resolution of the timer i.e. the number of nanoseconds elapsed before the timer is incremented.\nYou read it as \"after 80 ns, counter will increase by 1\". I am pretty sure the correct interpretetion is \"after 80 ns, counter will increase by 80\".\nA timer resolution of 80 merely says you can't measure smaller things - like 40 ns. It will go from 0 to 80 to 160.\n. We don't need it at all for our purposes. It's only there so you know what accuracy you are dealing with. My Macbook's GT650M has a resolution as bad as 1000 ns, so I simply can't measure anything smaller than a microsecond. My CPU device has the full 1 ns resolution.\n. @gm4tr1x you should have a \"revert\" button right here below. It will create a PR for revertion of this one.\n.

JtR was just an example, it's very basic code with no interleaving (we do that only in non-OpenCL CPU code).\nThe thing I wrote above about \"auto-de-vectorizing and then auto-vectorizing\" was not something I made up, it's what Intel says will happen when you pass a vectorized kernel even though the device tells you not to. End result: longer build time, worse performance. In some odd cases the performance may end up slightly better by \"coincidence\" but that should be rare. I'm pretty sure I never saw it happen.\nAnyway, the best arbitrator is empirical data from testing oclHashcat of course. Is there a way to force scalar, or a certain width, from command line?\n. No matter what width I use or what accel/loops I try, oclHashcat is only doing 25% of JtR speed for WPA-PSK (eg. 5K vs. 21K) on same Intel CPU as the benchmarks mentioned above. This must be some unrelated issue. @jsteube that's the gear Solar gave you an account on btw.\n. OK that explains it. I will hold back my testing until we've got a really slow format supporting vector code, otherwise we'll just see interleaving effects that make the results very hard to draw conclusions from.\nMeanwhile I did find a new-ish whitepaper from Intel that contradicts things I've read and heard before. Perhaps the CPU drivers (as opposed to MIC/Phi ones) will auto-vectorize only if given scalar code and use already vectorized code as-is. I always thought that would be a better way to go even for the MIC. I really hate it when I give them pre-vectorized code and their compiler just ruins it. Anyway I can't imagine why the heck they would announce 1 if 4 or 8 is better.\n. This is good measure for generic device support. Perhaps it should be queried right after building kernel and cached, instead of querying for every call.\nYou should probably use it for the case of if ((data.opts_type & OPTS_TYPE_PT_BITSLICE) && (data.attack_mode == ATTACK_MODE_BF)) in line 2473 also, you just have to divide the result by 32 (which is done anyway).\n. No problem seen with latest code (g8af57d5), same hardware and OSX 10.11.13.\nAlso no problem seen with OP version (g952c20e), same hardware and OSX 10.11.13.\n. @averagesecurityguy try using -d2 and -d3 respectively, and see if problem is limited to a certain device.\n@jsteube @gm4tr1x perhaps a kernel build error could mention what device we were building for?\nEdit: it seems to be device 2 from OP.\n. You can't compile OpenCL code like that. But you could try running with --markov-disable and see if it works.\n. Building a compiler wouldn't change anything: oclHashcat would print the log if there was any. OSX' poor drivers often segfault while building, with no clue whatsoever as to why.\n. Yeah it's a bit hard to read. Here's the JtR CPU code (for accepting, not rejecting)\nc\nif (((!memcmp(ddata + 8, \"\\x63\\x82\", 2)) && (!memcmp(ddata + 16, \"\\xA0\\x07\\x03\\x05\", 4)))\n    ||\n    ((!memcmp(ddata + 8, \"\\x63\\x81\", 2)) && (!memcmp(ddata + 16, \"\\x03\\x05\\x00\", 3))))\n{\n    /* check the checksum to be sure */\n    (...)\n}\nSo worst case it's 5 bytes, best case is 6 bytes. That's far too small.\n. > But we have the case that \"header 1\" goes with \"footer 2\" and would say \"good boy\"\nThat can be avoided but we'd still only test five bytes worst case. It's pretty clear in the JtR code.\n. Not really, like I said in the other thread they auto-vectorize and is better given scalar code. This is for other devices, eg. CPUs with AVX-512 that doesn't auto-vectorize.\nPatch is complete but I will test some more before a PR.\n. You obviously need to run a version of jumbo built from the very same tree where you got electrum2john.py. Any older john version will just support punch card crypto and bit-sliced 6-bit hashes from the days of steam trains and hot air balloons.. Jim is on a road trip all over US. I think he's back next week.\n. @jsteube the salt here is already an MD5. So basically (in oclHashcat's view) the requested format is \nmd5(md5($pass).$salt) where $salt is 32 characters. For oclHashcat, the fact that the salt is an MD5 is more or less irrelevant except for the support of length.\n. > @magnumripper you sure about that? He said:\n\n\nthe salt is a md5 like value, created from the surname\n\n\nHe also said\n\n\nthe length is 32\n\n\nHis example hashes indicate the salt is stored as ready-to-use MD5:\nad1f95326d65ee793fa347ab7345b246:fc13de57255bed2c26fb5edaa3733640 takealunch\nf84dec8b20b7ea511cb0085f0ec0afcc:3e6affc692019dc8d476111d25872fa1 oscar1017\n5b4ea443ca4d325b60e9d95ce4c0943c:81599f2145e887463733f2810f6a8c72 N3V3R_m0r3\nIt's not 100% clear from the OP whether we know the surname so we can calculate the salt ourselves. @andreamoreto please clarify!\n. @jsteube JtR supports the padding attack using this format (given by Ettercap)\n$o5logon$22E8FA41826608560F0B2A713724689F3D28640577B511B9C36178418C138210D820F7800C14C579D5094F4BBB0E0EBD*A0F9FC5E0D992692AA35\nmeaning\n$o5logon$ <server's AUTH_SESSKEY> * <AUTH_VFR_DATA>\nThe above is enough when exploiting the padding weakness.\nFor this new case, we need to add fields. Something like:\n$o5logon$ <server's AUTH_SESSKEY> * <AUTH_VFR_DATA> * <AUTH_PASSWORD> * <client's AUTH_SESSKEY>\nI'm almost finished with Ettercap support that I'll push upstream once we agree on the format. Are you OK with the above? For the first example by OP it'd be:\n$o5logon$22E8FA41826608560F0B2A713724689F3D28640577B511B9C36178418C138210D820F7800C14C579D5094F4BBB0E0EBD*A0F9FC5E0D992692AA35*5ECC855E89402343D75CA84630222EC0B677929CFFDE91FB0F2EA3BDCEEDAAE9*0F8D4466C0B1A5B9FA68A63B94EB2BA23F222678D7969C2348ADF52C58D1D21DF290794A5208EDD12D0EF71A88687FF4\n. @jackpit110 do you know whether we can use some info from a pcap that tells us whether the padding trick is applicable or not? Like a server version figure or something?\n. > Because the client has to encrypt the plaintext passsword the size of the AUTH_PASSWORD will change whenever the password exceeds the length 16 or more.\nLooks like iphelix found this out in 2009, there's some notes on https://www.thesprawl.org/research/oracle-authentication about it. But the more interesting thing on that page is the server version number stuff. I'll try to parse that too in Ettercap, and add as yet another field. Eg. for version 10.2.0.1.0, the hash will be:\n$o5logon$22E8FA41826608560F0B2A713724689F3D28640577B511B9C36178418C138210D820F7800C14C579D5094F4BBB0E0EBD*A0F9FC5E0D992692AA35*5ECC855E89402343D75CA84630222EC0B677929CFFDE91FB0F2EA3BDCEEDAAE9*0F8D4466C0B1A5B9FA68A63B94EB2BA23F222678D7969C2348ADF52C58D1D21DF290794A5208EDD12D0EF71A88687FF4*0A200100\n. @jackpit110 so maybe the server version number I just mentioned is not very interesting. The LOGON_VERSION used in the authentication is what we need. I'll try to find it.\n. There's also a semantic question: Is it still called \"o5logon\" in Oracle 12? I think it is but I'm not sure.\n. > @magnumripper While implementing it turns out there's a bug in your format.\nUnfortunately it's been $o5logon$hash*hash for several years so we need to stick to it. For example, Ettercap will output it that way. Blame @kholia \ud83d\ude04 \nOn another note the current official Ettercap handles some pcaps poorly. There's a fixed version in my fork and it's also capable of outputting this longer format with all of the fields. I'll wait with pushing it upstream until I can see difference between protocol version 11 and 12. And I will add some kind of version field as the very last one.\n. The ekoparty pdf (page 19) mentions this:\nSQLNET.ORA config file:\nSQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION=12\nIdeally we'd need a pcap with this set to 12 and another with 11 (or whatever was before 12), all else equal. Then we might see a difference in negotiation.\n. @jackpit110 for that oracle 12 pcap, current Ettercap shows username as \"AUTH_TERMINALunknown\". I need to fix that. Looking into the data it looks like actual user was Administrator, is that correct?\n. > @magnumripper no. username is sys. and connected as sysdba\nToo bad, we don't seem to be able to find that in the pcap. This can make it hard to know what user you cracked. Best we can do is list client's IP (or DNS name).\n. Oh, right. I was lazy and just ran strings(1) on the pcap but since SYS is just three letters, it wouldn't show.  Using tshark -x is better. So while some change seem to be needed to Ettercap, the data is definitely available.\n. > jtr is not able to crack oracle 12 cap.\nSince June 22, it is (but only the CPU version for now). And you need to use Ettercap from my fork, or put it together manually. Also, JtR is much slower than it should be (it's not using SIMD) and the GPU version is a joke.\nMy take so far in JtR is that if the old two-field format is used, the padding trick is used (well that's the only thing we can do with that). And if all four fields is there, the padding trick is never used so Oracle 12 does crack with that format.\n. > so to detect presence of padding we should check client version, if version is 11.2.0.3/11.2.0.4 or above that we know there is not padding.\nI now have detection of client/server versions in a private fork of Ettercap (the 0xDEADBEEF ANO packet) but I'm not sure you are right with the details so I'm unsure how to use the information:\n- Several of my sample pcaps (available here) are client 11.2.0.3 and do use PKCS padding.\n- Your oracle12-zip is a client v. 10.2.0.0.0 talking to a server v. 12.1.0.1.0, right? And it does NOT use PKCS#7 padding.\n- That ekoparty pdf, page 19, says clients older than 11.2.0.3 can't use \"logon version 12\", which seems to translate to random padding. Again, your pcap seems to prove the opposite.\nI'm at a loss here. I can't see any particular parameter in the pcaps showing us whether we can safely exploit the padding trick or not.\nPerhaps if both the server and client are older than 11.2.0.3, we can safely assume PKCS padding. If both are between 11.2.0.3 and 11.2.0.4, we can only \"hope\" for PKCS padding (risking false negaitves).\nThere should be at the very least 2x performance gain with the padding exploit. We only need one SHA-1 + one block of AES. Without it, we need the SHA-1, two MD5's and eight or more blocks of AES.\n. \ud83d\udc4d great info, I'll try to complete my Ettercap patch and push it upstream. If we can find out actual fields that are safer to use than version numbers, we can change that later.\n\nso why those documents say 11.2.0 ?? may be those are before patch release.\n\nI guess that's the explanation.\nSo @jsteube do you have any preference for how Ettercap should treat a hash known to have the padding vulnerability? Should we simply output the old two-field o5logon syntax for those, or should we output all fields anyway and add some last flag field (eg. opening up for combining known plaintext length with known padding)? I'm not sure what I prefer. I think I prefer the latter. We could add a simple flag field where bit 1 means PKCS padding. So hashes will currently end with *00 or *01 although we'd reserve the other bits for future use so eg. *07 would also mean we can use the padding trick.\n. > now what is it??\nIs that from one of your posted pcaps? I'm not sure what you mean at all but my ettercap code has changed significantly.\nOn another note, I submitted my Ettercap fixes upstream in https://github.com/Ettercap/ettercap/pull/742\n. Perhaps it's actually fallling back to NTLMSSP? That's a whole different story. Ettercap doesn't recognize a single packet from that pcap. Or does it fall back to o3logon? We don't support that yet.\n. Yeah I've struggled with these for years. Early Maverick was very very poor, then it got better and better and right before Yosemite, all JtR formats worked fine (partly because of workarounds but also a lot better driver). Then for some idiot reason, Yosemite made it just as bad as Maverick in 2012 and that's about where we are still.\nHere are some outrageous examples:\n- Having two spaces in a row anywhere in in build options (as in -Dthis -Dthat  -Ipath) triggered a fatal error in some version(s)!\n- A header file that missed the last line's LF, when #included, was mixed with the sourcing file's next line, causing havoc!\n- Several times I've seen I needed some kind of barrier like this even though there is absolutely no reason AFAICS - and only Apple needed it:\n``` c\nif OS_X && gpu_nvidia(DEVICE_INFO)\n/*\n * Driver bug workaround. Halves the performance :-(\n * Bug seen with GT 650M version 10.6.47 310.42.05f01\n */\nbarrier(CLK_GLOBAL_MEM_FENCE);\n\nendif\n```\n...and sometimes there's not even any normal barrier that does the trick. Here's a crazy workaround actually in use in JtR in some place. Note that the condition is never true!\n``` c\nif OS_X && gpu_intel(DEVICE_INFO)\n/\n * Ridiculous workaround for Apple w/ Intel HD Graphics. I tried to\n * replace this with a barrier but that did not do the trick.\n \n * Yosemite, HD Graphics 4000, 1.2(Jul 29 2015 02:40:37)\n */\n    if (get_global_id(0) == 0x7fffffff) printf(\".\");\nendif\n```\n- The below replaces a function with more or less an exact copy of the same function. For some crazy reason that works around some bug:\n``` c\nifdef OS_X\n    /* This is the weirdest workaround. Using sha1_final()\n       works perfectly fine in the RarFinal() subkernel below. */\n    PUTCHAR_BE(tempin, pwlen + 11, 0x80);\n    for (i = pwlen + 12; i < 56; i++)\n        PUTCHAR_BE(tempin, i, 0);\n    tempin[14] = 0;\n    tempin[15] = (blocklen * (round + 1)) << 3;\n    sha1_block(tempin, tempout);\n\nelse\n    sha1_final(tempin, tempout, blocklen * (round + 1));\n\nendif\n```\n...and these were just some examples. In my darkest moments I deemed Apple even worse than AMD, but to be honest they are still not THAT bad \ud83d\ude04 \n. Oh, and many many other times (unfortunately not documented) I've had great success just shuffling code around in a way that shouldn't make any difference whatsoever. It's extremely frustrating to have to resort to \"throw things at it and see what sticks\".\n. On my machine (latest OSX) both the native and Homebrew's gcc define __APPLE__ by default, but not __DARWIN__\n```\n$ gcc -dM -E -x c /dev/null | egrep \"(APPLE|DARWIN)\"\ndefine APPLE_CC 1\ndefine APPLE 1\n$ /usr/bin/gcc -dM -E -x c /dev/null | egrep \"(APPLE|DARWIN)\"\ndefine APPLE_CC 6000\ndefine APPLE 1\n``\n. Perhaps you could open a PR with suggested improvements? It'd put you in the hall of fame!\n. Why would you not be able to exhaust?l?l?l?d?d?d?d?d?d? That's a tiny keyspace for NTLM.\n. I agree, 1. is what I would expect\n. FWIW: We had a similar problem with JtR recently, that was with-I /some/path` given to the OpenCL run-time compiler. We now simply enclose the whole path with quotes.\nEDIT: It seems that was handled differently in #432.\n. JtR core supports arbitrarily long salts but most optimized formats has a fairly tight limit just like Hashcat, to keep things in one or two Merkel Damgard blocks.\nThis particular format is supported in JtR as dynamic_2009 (only CPU) with salt lengths up to 200 (same format with max. 23 bytes salt is dynamic_9 and it's obviously faster).\n. Using a decent shell you should just escape an actual tab character. Normally that would be something like 'ctrl-v + tab' surrounded by quotes.\n. > Is it as simple as vram / size_of_hash?\nMy guess would be a quarter of that. For some (silly) reason, nearly all OpenCL implementations limit size of any single alloc to a quarter of total memory. You can see that figure when listing devices:\nDevice ID #2\n    Type           : Gpu\n    Vendor ID      : 2147483648\n    Vendor         : NVIDIA\n    Name           : GeForce GT 650M\n    Processor(s)   : 2\n    Clock          : 900\n    Memory         : 256/1024 MB allocatable\n    OpenCL Version : OpenCL C 1.2\nThe \"256/1024 MB allocatable\" is what I'm talking about. You can allocate all 1024 but only at most 256 MB at a time.\n. > Once I've got my intended algorithm working I'll look at contributing some documention for new users wanting to implement new algorithms using the FNV1a32 as a basic example.\nGreat \ud83d\udc4d \n. > instead of a range of aaaaa -> zzzzz I got sange -> uqoql\nThat is fine, they come in probability order instead of alphabetical.\n. Good info here. @polarathene I think your format will be a great \"template\" for how to write a format, since the actual format-specific logic is so simple. So how about extensively documenting things with inline comments, eg. everything @jsteube said about il, cnt and so on. This would be great for people like me who might implement one format a year or so. And from then on, we can always refer people who'd like to write a format from scratch to look at this format.\n. Also, what is the actual problem here? Why would you need to alloc/free at all? Why doesn't the stack variable do the job just fine?\n. > @magnumripper try example0.sh (without apply my patch) and check if you got a segmentation fault.\nYeah I do. I'll debug it a little.\n. Debug data is very strange. I think the real problem is something earlier, like a stack smash. But ASan doesn't help me. Did anyone try running with Valgrind (on Linux)?.\nProcess 7438 stopped\n* thread #5: tid = 0x65c6c, 0x00000001000485af hashcat`check_hash(hashcat_ctx=<unavailable>, device_param=<unavailable>, plain=<unavailable>) + 14 at hashes.c:225, stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x700000eb2718)\n    frame #0: 0x00000001000485af hashcat`check_hash(hashcat_ctx=<unavailable>, device_param=<unavailable>, plain=<unavailable>) + 14 at hashes.c:225\n   222  }\n   223  \n   224  void check_hash (hashcat_ctx_t *hashcat_ctx, hc_device_param_t *device_param, plain_t *plain)\n-> 225  {\n   226    debugfile_ctx_t *debugfile_ctx = hashcat_ctx->debugfile_ctx;\n   227    loopback_ctx_t  *loopback_ctx  = hashcat_ctx->loopback_ctx;\n   228  \n(lldb) print hashcat_ctx\nerror: Couldn't materialize: couldn't get the value of variable hashcat_ctx: read memory from 0x700000eb2718 failed (0 of 8 bytes read)\nerror: errored out in DoExecute, couldn't PrepareToExecuteJITExpression\nIt does happen on second call to check_hash().\n. Oh, right. But anyway I think the alloc/free just hides a problem still present. That stack size theory might be correct, is there a way to bump it?\n. Personally I like the current behaviour better. I even saw to it that JtR works the same way when using -mask with a length range. Just my two cents.\nSpecifically, it helps dealing with the \"exponential wall\" without calculating beforehand. If you are at eg. length 9 and see that it will complete within a day or two, you keep it running. If (using a slower hash) it says it will take three months, you quit and reduce the keyspace.\n. Does your core code allow launching different kernels for different salts? If so, you could have a kernel optimized for a single block, another for two blocks and a third (slower) for arbitrary length.\nIf this isn't possible with current code, perhaps it's not too hard to implement?\n. Sure, that's the base of the idea. I already have that code in use elsewhere and it's proven to work like a champ. For extremely short (eg. two bytes) passwords consisting of random binary data there's a slight chance of mis-interpreting - but actually there's not much harm there either. Once you realise this is the case you can always re-encode it. No data is lost! For lengths of 3-4 bytes already, the risk of mis-interpreting is really slim. For real-life passwords, it practically never happens.\nHaving said that, I think it's a good idea to \"blacklist\" LM from this default behaviour since we know it's never ever made of UTF-8 but from an \"OEM codepage\" like CP850. Same goes for 40-bit RC4 brute-force as in eg. oldoffice.\n. I didn't realize I could use -o for this (in fact I didn't realise the difference between output file and pot file). I'll try using -o /dev/null\n. Sure, closing a file implicitly unlocks it. In fact, unlocking before close would be a race condition unless you flush before unlocking.\n. In fact I think there's more room for improvement: You should ideally open your session file at start of run, then lock it and never close it (I think that's not the case right now) until actually exiting. This way there's no chance you accidentally start another session with same name (or default name) and end up with some one of them actually saved (the one that happened to write last). This is how JtR was made some 20 years ago and it has saved many many hours of cut/paste mistakes...\n. I realized I had missed one instance, added now.\n. > Are you planing to add something to this or can I merge already?\nI'm pretty sure it's fine right now. I haven't tested it as much as I did #177 though.\n. I don't do windows at all ever. What if you change it to\n``` c\ndefine lock_file(dummy) void dummy\n``\n. ...no that will probably not be better. Perhaps we should #ifdef all calls to (un)lock_file instead. Or just that call.\n. Yeah a format flag is the way to go, that'll be perfect.\n. What's the reason you ended up using|instead of,`? Just curious.\n. This is the silliest driver (or run-time) bug ever. It was present already in OS X Mavericks three years ago - we had a similar problem in JtR back then.\n. Sounds more like a cap2hccap problem\n. We absolutely need the locking. However, we're [supposedly] only locking during actual write so something seems to be amiss. I will look into this ASAP!. BTW another test would be to run two instances of HC using the same pot file. This is supposed to work just fine, with no noticable performance problem (unless of course both instances crack thousands of passwords per second - that would mean a little performance drop but the pot file will end up correct and not thrashed). . Apparently the --show and --left options use potfile_write_open which is a bit unintuitive as it's only supposed to read. My fix in #895 works around it.. Yes, I too reviewed all of them and hopefully it's all OK now.. Honestly I don't think it would end up being used a whole lot IRL. We both already have the workaround of using a different field separator and it's nearly always safe using TAB (but obviously there are exceptions).\nUnlike HC, JtR never ever *) use : as a salt delimiter, we usually use $ or *. I guess that simplifies it a bit for us. Our pot file will always have the first : regarded as a field separator and any remaining ones will be regarded part of the plaintext.\n*) Except for cases where eg. the user name field automatically is added as salt, but that's a different story.. Oh, and for salts containing a :, JtR has hex notation $HEX$dead3ababe for input files, similar to your plaintext $HEX[dead3ababe] for output files. I don't know if HC supports that?. Isn't \"weak hashes\" just your name for hashes of null string? They don't exist for WPA-PSK since the minimum length is 8. Perhaps some kernel code assumes a longer string and misbehaves with a null string? Just throwing out the idea.. I can reproduce this problem with OSX CPU device (works fine with GPU and Iris). I get CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE though.\nI tried disabling the weak hash check and it didn't help.. @dtest505 yes it is. At 100000 MH it will start saying 100 GH. I suppose the reason it doesn't do so earlier is you lose too much detail because there's just one decimal: 1423.4 MH would show as 1.4 GH.. The problem with --increment-min/max options is you can't abbreviate them except for the very last letter. How about --lengh-range=4,8, which can be abbreviated to just --len=4,8?. Same problem. You'll need to type --increment-r before it gets unambigouous. Interesting. OSX sed(1) sucks so I have GNU sed installed too. It has at least one option with optional parameter, -i [suffix], and that works just fine. Perhaps I should have a look at how they did that.. OK it turns out OSX getopt doesn't support optional arguments but getopt_long (which isn't POSIX anyway) does (just like GNU's). So as long as we use getopt_long, optional parameters should not be a problem.. JtR has 'P' for english grammar (eg. crack -> cracked). We've been talking about trying to unify rules commands but in this case it's probably not a problem since HC will likely never get the JtR version of 'P' anyway and on the other hand, JtR can't currently implement this version of 'P' since it can not currently handle nulls within plains.\nSo, in short: No problem there.. There already are many collisions. We have https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/doc/RULES#L104-L303.\nRecently Jim added a \"hashcat rules mode\" where we behave differently and try to mimic hashcat (hashcat legacy even, I think) rules. https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/doc/RULES-hashcat\n@solardiz @jfoug . > Note if you compile from source to do a make clean\nWith a perfect Makefile, this is never needed so some dependency must be missing.

You sound like a dumb kid.. FWIW I agree with OP. If user says -d (...) it would be logical to over-ride the default for -D.. That sample code is ancient and we no longer use that tag. This now corresponds to krb5pa-sha1 in current JtR. It's straightforward to implement and finally uses UTF-8 like anyone else IIRC.\nc\n{\"$krb5pa$18$user1$EXAMPLE.COM$$2a0e68168d1eac344da458599c3a2b33ff326a061449fcbc242b212504e484d45903c6a16e2d593912f56c93883bf697b325193d62a8be9c\", \"openwall\"},\n{\"$krb5pa$18$user1$EXAMPLE.COM$$a3918bd0381107feedec8db0022bdf3ac56e534ed54d13c62a7013a47713cfc31ef4e7e572f912fa4164f76b335e588bf29c2d17b11c5caa\", \"openwall\"},\n{\"$krb5pa$18$l33t$EXAMPLE.COM$$98f732b309a1d7ef2355a974842a32894d911e97150f5d57f248e1c2632fbd3735c5f156532ccae0341e6a2d779ca83a06021fe57dafa464\", \"openwall\"},\n{\"$krb5pa$18$aduser$AD.EXAMPLE.COM$$64dfeee04be2b2e0423814e0df4d0f960885aca4efffe6cb5694c4d34690406071c4968abd2c153ee42d258c5e09a41269bbcd7799f478d3\", \"password@123\"},\n{\"$krb5pa$18$aduser$AD.EXAMPLE.COM$$f94f755a8b4493d925094a4eb1cec630ac40411a14c9733a853516fe426637d9daefdedc0567e2bb5a83d4f89a0ad1a4b178662b6106c0ff\", \"password@12345678\"},\n{\"$krb5pa$18$aduser$AD.EXAMPLE.COM$AD.EXAMPLE.COMaduser$f94f755a8b4493d925094a4eb1cec630ac40411a14c9733a853516fe426637d9daefdedc0567e2bb5a83d4f89a0ad1a4b178662b6106c0ff\", \"password@12345678\"},    \n/* etype 17 hash obtained using MiTM etype downgrade attack */\n{\"$krb5pa$17$user1$EXAMPLE.COM$$c5461873dc13665771b98ba80be53939e906d90ae1ba79cf2e21f0395e50ee56379fbef4d0298cfccfd6cf8f907329120048fd05e8ae5df4\", \"openwall\"},. Yes I just realised this too. So perhaps we should just add new fields in the end (those fields shall be invalid for $7z$0$).. As discussed in https://github.com/philsmd/7z2hashcat/issues/6 I seem to do just fine with just the \"first file size\", aka. crc_length, eg:\n$7z$1 or 2$...$[data]$[crc_len]$[coder_attributes]. Sorry, that was meant for 7z2hashcat project. However, this will apply to HC if implemented so I'll leave it open.\nhttps://github.com/philsmd/7z2hashcat/issues/5. This can be handled within #965.. @DoZ10 don't you also need to comment out the early rejection of e? Eg. line 493 of m00100_a1.cl.. The really cool thing with Solar's single mode, is it will run near single-salt-speed with many salts. That's obviously because it only tries the things described above on the very user that had them (unless there are salt collisions, in which case all other hashes with same salt will be tested too). The bad news is this is all CPU, and would be very tricky to implement on GPU I guess. JtR \"can\" use single mode with GPU formats, but they perform like shit (if at all).. This applies to non-split vanilla archives too, the hash often ends up too long for Hashcat.. Oh, that's great! Wasn't mentioned in commit description so I had no idea it was fixed. So is there virtually no limit now? Just OS/FS limits?. I have wanted something similar. For what it's worth, 'S' is already taken in JtR. Ideally we should find some mnemonic compatible with both HC, JtR and possibly others.\nHeads-up @solardiz.. I'll try to create a wiki page listing all free or taken HC and JtR-jumbo mnemonics ASAP. That will come handy in the future too.. In JtR, 'a' is free but not 'A'.\nhttps://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/doc/RULES\nI really should create that wiki page.. This would work\n```\nOSDARWIN        := $(shell uname -s | grep -c Darwin)\n(...)\nifeq ($(OSDARWIN),1)\n    (...)\n``\n. ...but I see now there already is someifeq ($(UNAME),Darwin)` in there. So just moving the stuff around should do. But why limit it to 16 at all? Darwin <16 didn't have gsed either, yes?. I can see a little room for enhancement with that... How about allowing use of default custom charsets 1..4 with a specified non-default mask, and vice versa (as in OP)? Should be a trivial change in code. I have several times wanted that and been bitten by this unintuitive behavior.. > I'd suggest abort hashcat with an appropriate error message if the user specifies a custom charset but does not specify a mask.\nThat's definitely better than current behavior.. https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/issues/2318 is the longest sample I've seen. After that we use 5 MD blocks (311 bytes) for SHA-256 but we're apparently still at 2 blocks (239 bytes) for SHA-384/512.\nI can't recall what plaintext that sample had but it was cracked immediately so probably something like \"secret\".... Just out of curiosity, what is the use case? Hash collisions?. Strange, __unix__ should be defined on all BSDs except MacOS and _POSIX should be less safe to use. I think you updated your patch though.\n```\n-bash-4.4$ uname -mprsv\nOpenBSD 6.0 GENERIC.MP#116 amd64 amd64\n-bash-4.4$ cc -dM -E -x c /dev/null | grep -iE 'unix|posix'\ndefine unix 1\n-bash-4.4$ gcc -dM -E -x c /dev/null | grep -iE 'unix|posix'\ndefine unix 1\n```. I believe @e-ago will commit a utility and establish a hash format in https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/pull/2427 RSN. If you do so before her, I'll see to it that JtR uses the same hash format.. I think @e-ago mentioned somewhere AES-XTS is not needed for cracking, just normal AES.. A bunch of files (eg. autom4te.cache, config*.cache and config.status) should be added to .gitignore\n. Yeah, and it should be added to this PR. That doesn't make any sense. You would need a known plain or something.. OK that makes sense \ud83d\ude03 . You mean missing zeros in the hex representation? I think you'd be better off using a perl script (or something) that brute forces all possible full hashes from what you've got. That \"backwards\" way will run near full speed as opposed to a cracker that does it \"forwards\". At least unless you've got a really huge set of them.. Something like that, yes. If your hash is 31 characters, you'll end up with 31 versions of it. If your hash is only like 25 characters, there will be lots of alternatives but it will still not slow Hashcat down much.\nI bet @philsmd could write a script for it in five minutes if you could persuade him (it would take me longer because I tend to code first and think later and this is somewhat tricky). \nBut again, if you have lots and lots of them, it could be worthwhile creating a format. Is this a one-off? Where did you see it?. http://www.legic.com/en/products-and-services/507894/applications.html\nhttp://www.legic.com/en/products-and-services/smartcard-ic-s/507936/advant-on-credit-card.html. This could end up in lots of bloat but I can see some useful cases.\nJust FWIW, JtR has a KISS variant of it: Given a negative N for --max-runtime=N it will stop after that many seconds of not cracking anything.. > progressp - progress percentage (probably not useful)\nI can see a use case. Let's say you attacked 500 salts for a week and got 12.34% progress. Then you get a few more hashes. You could pause the first job, run the new hashes up to 12.34% and then resume the original job with the new hashes added to it.. Hard-coding 20 can't be right. It should be more like this\nc\n    if (outfile_ctx->outfile_format & OUTFILE_FMT_CRACKPOS)\n    {\n        tmp_len += sprintf (tmp_buf + tmp_len, \"%\" PRIu64, crackpos);\n    }\n(Edit: I see @philsmd already commented on #1195. snprintf should be used as well.). Not sure about .induct and .outfiles, should they too be moved to distclean?. > 11. Please unroll this section by hand:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 8; ++i)\n    v[i] = S->h[i];\n\nWhy would you want things like that manually unrolled? Just curious.. According to the article (unless I misunderstand), the boost was 2500x and the speed on an i5 CPU was a whopping 6 MH/s. But Apple fixed it in IOS 10.1 so it's probably not a big deal (except I too am curious to know the details).\nIs hashcat really only getting 120 H/s on a GTX1080? That doesn't look right. JtR gets 2348 H/s on my (old) laptop CPU and that format isn't really optimised at all AFAIK.. The only archive I've seen is the non-public one we got from a user. Phil can send it to you (or I can). The performance drop is insignificant except for the case of attacking a lot of hashes at once (because we can re-use the KDF, but not the AES and verify, for each \"salt\" - are you doing that in hashcat too?).. It sure is shell wildcard expansion. I never saw that, it's a bit amusing. One workaround is to just wrap the mask in quotes. There's no way to fix this in hashcat as it happens even before hashcat starts. Try changing \"hashcat\" to \"echo\" and you'll see what happens.\n```\n$ touch al bl cl\n$ echo -m 3 -m 0 example0.hash -1 ?l ?1?1?1?1?1\n-m 3 -m 0 example0.hash -1 al bl cl ?1?1?1?1?1\n$ echo -m 3 -m 0 example0.hash -1 \"?l\" ?1?1?1?1?1\n-m 3 -m 0 example0.hash -1 ?l ?1?1?1?1?1\n. BTW another workaround is to use long option `--custom-charset1=?l`\n$ touch al bl cl\n$ echo -m 3 -m 0 example0.hash --custom-charset1=?l ?1?1?1?1?1\n-m 3 -m 0 example0.hash --custom-charset1=?l ?1?1?1?1?1\n``\n. The code is OK. We are deliberately using the fall-through feature of switch/case and apparently the-Walloption now comments on that. Just add-Wno-implicit-fallthroughto get rid of the warning.. Will still might want to add-Wno-implicit-fallthroughbefore most dists has a gcc that new.. I think-Wimplicit-fallthroughis a good option but it shouldn't be included in-Wall`. Is gcc 7.1.1 a mature release?\nPersonally, I really wouldn't want to bloat the code with non-portable attributes to work around silly compiler warnings for perfectly fine code. In JtR I will add -Wno-implicit-fallthrough when supported by compiler.\nBTW how would an older version of gcc react to __attribute__((fallthrough)) (which it won't recognize)? With a warning? Then we're back to square one.. > Personally, I really wouldn't want to bloat the code with non-portable attributes\nI take that back. #1266 solves this in a way that doesn't fail on other compilers, and that actually makes the code a bit more clear about what's happening.\nBTW it's not -Wall that turns this on, it's -Wextra.. IMHO, while the format name might better be ChaCha20, the tag (or signature) should be $chacha20$in all lower. Some tags are all upper (I think) but few ones should have a mix.. > @magnumripper, I'm not attached to either approach strongly, but just out of curiosity, other than historical trends, are there any practical or programmatic reasons why mixed case would be bad?\nIt's not the end of the world but I know for sure that mixed-case tags will lead to confused users. Tags aren't labels and they aren't clear-text. They are just... tags, and in the end of the day they are more like \"machine readable\" than \"human readable\". They should definitely be simple: Either all upper or all lower IMO.. Also, the real arbitrator is compatibility. If hashcat would have ended up having it as $cHaCha20$ before we implemented anyting else, we would have used that in JtR too, fugly or not.. > There's no commandline option to show the max password length supported, but a relative good wiki article where the max lengths are listed.\nWhere? Google let me down.. OK, git grep 'hashconfig->pw.max' is good enough for me \ud83d\ude06. Appveyor MINGW32 as well as MINGW64 (Cygwin 32/64 are fine):\nsrc/shared.c: In function 'get_random_num':\nsrc/shared.c:379:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'rand_s'; did you mean 'rand_r'?

If not, just add this in some sensible place.\nextern errno_t rand_s (unsigned int *randomValue);\n...or maybe it is prototyped nowadays although Appveyor runs an older MINGW version where it isn't. Then you'll need a few gears to sort that out.... #68 \nIn order to check such RAR3 archives you need to implement loads and loads of deflating code on CPU side (it simply wont work on GPU), with very clever early-rejection stuff to keep speed up.. I'd be curious to understand exactly how/why it fails with no warning/error. Is there some error reported by GPU but not handled or what? I mean, if you successfully pushed everything to GPU it should work. If it didn't fit, you obviously should get some kind of error return.. All and any memory used are allocated and if you didn't get any error when allocating it I can't see what would break. Could this be something else?. Well it could theoretically be a bug in bitmap stuff or whatever. But 2^24 is not a huge deal. It's very strange that none of the hashes get cracked.. On another note, it's called hashcat, not hashtag \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 . So we need a fix in rar2john (rar2hashcat) as well as in the crackers?. What use would a cracker have for that functionality? We're \"able to crack passwords using GPUs\" already, without vendor-specific stuff.. > The problem is that the algorithm puts in a fixed 0x80 byte at position 16. If the password (including the salt) is longer than 16, then I'm not exactly sure how to handle that.\n\n@magnumripper Any Idea? I see JtR is limiting to lenght 16 as well\n\nYeah it was 16 at the time we got the first version of our format. I guess we need to bump it in JtR too.\nSo, we'll need some samples with known plain, to determine how to terminate the longer passwords. Perhaps it's set at minimum pos 16 (with nulls or spaces as padding? Can't remember but easy to check source) but then follows normal termination? That would be backwards compatible. But there's no point in guessing - we need samples!. Off the top of my head, the S rule in JtR is simply hard-coded for a US keyboard. You could of course make custom rules for custom keyboards (not using S but eg. s1! s2\" s3# s4$ and so on) but it'd be slower.. I must have missed the original change in rules syntax. Where did that happen? Was it good or bad in terms of compatibility?. How long is that salt? Can you please provide a test vector with a known password?. Is it always 4 digits? A trivial CPU implementation or even a perl script exhausts that keyspace in a few seconds. Writing a GPU format for it would be a total waste of time.\nIf the key can be other characters, perhaps even Unicode ones, it makes a little more sense.. FWIW, most often when my macbook crashed good enough to reboot (which is very very rare), it was a \"watchdog timer\" issue. I have yet to find a way to turn that shite off on macOS.. What if you put single quotes around the hash as in\nhashcat -m 10400 -a 3 -w 3 '$pdf$4*4*128*-3904*1*16*8aaf9105962aaa4182602a81b9485e69*32*615bb2bf8976796e272a3ca130b417d76a6d4429f3a6c5f3ab574bf17a02ff7d*32*3add260c37d64307876f6f0168414109638d74600eeccb925d4d472ee462e4f0' ?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b. >\"/home/motion/hashcat-4.1.0/OpenCL/inc_vendor.cl\", line 102: error: can't\n          enable all OpenCL extensions or unrecognized OpenCL extension\n  #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_amd_media_ops2 : enable\nFWIW, the correct way to know whether a certain driver supports #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_foo_bar is #ifdef cl_foo_bar per the OpenCL spec. This is quite handy.. Please note that JtR has supported \\xNN notation for many years. Eg. you can append a tab using $\\x09. I suggest implementing that (if anything) for compatibility.\nhttps://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/doc/RULES. I believe ce4858f7a broke this. These lines were removed:\ndiff\n-    // This line rejects unprintables. The rest of the function\n-    // reliably rejects invalid UTF-8 sequences.\n-    if (*buf < 0x20 || *buf == 0x7f) return false;. What does clinfo say? I'd guess the problem is the chroot and not anything missing in hashcat.. JtR can do that only because it's so slow/ineffective for this use case: It does all rules processing on CPU side and then has to transfer all resulting candidates, which is a bottleneck (for fast hashes like this).\nHashcat applies rules on GPU-side. This fact makes it more or less impossible to implement what you want. The upside is that it's WAY faster so the end result may still be a whole lot faster than JtR.. I can picture several use cases where this is definitely not wanted - we'll need an option to disable it!. He said it used to be the default, we're not suggesting it should be now.. @philsmd this gave me the idea you could possibly check entropy at loading stage, detecting this, right? At that time we're not even running hot code so it could be a really proper entropy test. Actually it should possibly be shared code because this could be used in other formats as well at loading (most any data blobs that ~are not compressed but~ should be encrypted and/or compressed) for ensuring input data quality.. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1719#issuecomment-430603088 \ud83d\ude09 . > only hex values, especially for ESSID\nAlso, IIRC when parsing the ESSID hex field we should store the length and never use strlen() on the resulting data. So an ESSID of 6d6167006e756d should have length set to 7.. > Hi magnum.\n\nAre you sure, we need an additional ESSID len field in the new hash line?\n\nNo, I meant when parsing that field we need to look at its length instead of doing a strlen on the result. So hashcat and JtR should have a len field in whatever struct is holding the data, but the input field doesn't need it.. This is more of an Android or ArchLinux issue that a hashcat one. It's better discussed on the hashcat forum but a good start would be to forget about hashcat for now and simply run clinfo. Once that works (or does it now?), you can return to hashcat.. The fact clinfo doesn't list your GPU at all shows that something is wrong with the OpenCL driver/runtime installation. There's no point in trying hashcat until this is resolved.. > hint: try to think about the amount of all atoms on the word\nOh, but there's only one Atom! \ud83d\ude04 . @jsteube this PR added support for gzip which is compression only. 7zip and zip are archive formats, and supporting them would likely open up a can of worms.. The warnings are benign, build works fine despite the warnings. I've been planning to fix them for quite some time but didn't get a round tuit[tm].. I can build just fine with Mojave/10.14.2.

If not, you probably need to (re-)install xtools and/or tweak some of its settings. You didn't answer my question though. Also, what's the output of which clang?\nAnyway this is not a hashcat issue at all.. The issue is on your end. I suggest you change your path to ensure /usr/bin/clang is used and not that foreign one.. This works fine, thanks!. > Thanks for info! CC @magnumripper\nThank you for the heads-up. passing it on (blindly) to @kholia : do we need to change something?. Perhaps you should also shorten it to OpenCL platform to use, in case multiple platforms are present\n. Sorry if I'm totally confused here, but is this really correct? I think it isn't.\nBefore this patch:\n- If a device with 1 ns resolution gave a time_end - time_start resulting in 8000, we know it took 8 microseconds +/- one nanosecond.\n- If a device with 80 ns resolution gave time_end - time_start resulting in 8000, we know it took 8 microseconds +/- 80 nanoseconds.\nBut after this patch, the latter will show up like... 8000*80 == 640000 meaning 640 microseconds? That's just not right.\n. Revisiting eg. https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clGetEventProfilingInfo.html I see it's a bit ambiguous but as far as I'm aware it's like I said above: The result is already nanoseconds and the resolution is only needed to know the accuracy.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/34276371/timer-resolution-in-opencl-profiling\n. @Fist0urs on what grounds do you deem it \"must be very rare\"? Are you checking as little as five bytes in some cases, or do I misread the code? If it's just five bytes, you will likely get a false positive even for just ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a and that is definitely not rare! That's why I asked you to add the extra check in JtR.\n. Are you sure about this?\n. Hence the need for the typecast you removed. I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm just asking if you actually understand what you are doing here.\n.

    "shellster": "While I'm all for OpenCL, there is potentially at least one reason not to.  I currently bought an NVIDIA Jetson TK1 with the hope of eventually getting oclHashCat running on it.  There is currently (and likely never will be) any OpenCL support.  We are stuck with CUDA.  There are other issues with running on this platform (ARM and no NVML support), but only OpenCL will add yet another hurdle.  This may or may not be enough of a reason to not go full OpenCL.  I predict that we will see more of this specialty boards in the near future, and they offer some really nice power to energy ratios for cracking.\n. @magnumripper That's a good question.

This guy is getting some pretty decent WPA cracking speeds with the board: https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/785084/jetson-for-pyrit-cpyrit-cuda-stats/\nThe killer feature is that the board only uses about 5W of power, so the potential power comes from clustering them.\n. @epixoip: I believe you are misreading the post.

If oclHashcat uses WIN32 to detect MinGW, then Cygwin(or maybe even MSYS2) should work fine since it does not define it. Well, I can't say I care really. Thinking of just closing this.\n. Oh this. Not exactly. When i originally posted it I used cygwin's sshd to ssh in to a windows computer and use screen to manage hashcat. I no longer do that but the issue where pressing keys does nothing remains. I have a feeling that it has to do with the way the windows shell interacts with hashcat vs. cygwin's bash.\n. works but pressing s does nothing. here's some pastebin to see the issue: http://pastebin.com/56KYZVRg\nnotice the row of s at the end. that was me pressing it.\nedit: i think the proper solution would be a native cygwin build. i feel that the issue is with the cygwin/win32 translation layer. a few things block that though:\nopencl libraries need to be loaded the windows way(ie not by using a linux style opencl icd loader).\nbuilding fails with shared.h i believe. there are a few functions that are not implemented.\n. The main issue probably arises from other tools that display AP MACs first and clients after. airodump-ng is the best example. This is just cosmetic though. Might as well just close it.\n. i mean just adding -fstack-protector-strong, -pie and other such stuff in the CFLAGS.\n. I don't really have an opinion on the matter. Just wondering what the consensus here is.\n. Some have a performance reduction. Some don't. I've tested with gcc and clang and it all seems to work. Not sure if it really matters since the OpenCL kernels(not impacted by the flags) are the ones doing the heavy lifting. I think i'll just close this. There's no point to this with a password cracker. Don't really want to lower performance in any way.\n. umm are you sure you need those CFLAGS? I can compile oclHashcat without them. I remember they used to be required but not anymore.\nedit: i just looked at the PKGBUILD. It makes assumptions that are not true anymore. amd-adl-sdk is not required anymore either.\n. the hashcat developers cross compile to windows from linux. hence the initial check.\npull requests always welcome.\n. the package from fedora's repo and my self compiled one from arch show the same problem. interestingly enough, the device name now shows \"pthread-\" + name of device. well w/e. this isn't really a priority.\n. It is not. Maybe a pocl bug instead.\nOn Fri, Apr 22, 2016, 00:17 Jens Steube notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nDo I need a special version to reproduce, because if I can not reproduce\nthis, I can not fix it.

I'll redo the commit when I get home.\nAs for LLVM, you mean to use it with hashcat? That requires ditching fglrx and installing mesa with its opencl package. Also commenting out the wavefront call since it will fail(unimplemented).\nOh also a 7000 or newer GPU is required. 6000 technically works but global atomics are not implemented.\n.

Not sure if the if statements are quite what you were looking for.\n. Oh I didn't test with the others. My bad!\n. You're using Mesa which doesn't support Northern Islands and below. A warning should be added and --force required. Actually, the second GPU should work.

WordPad and Office do not have this issue. notepad.exe just like many other tools/components in Windows has code in it that has not been touched in at least a decade.\n2: The bug is in hashcat's single usage of the RegGetValue function which is supported starting XP 64-bit. The fix would be to use RegQueryValueEx but i'm not sure if anyone's interested in supporting XP.\n. both commands return /usr/lib on fedora 24. not sure on cygwin. replacing the grep | sed commands with the last one results in:\n=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib\n=/usr/local/lib\n=/lib\n=/usr/lib\nand\n=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib\n=/usr/local/lib\n=/lib\n=/usr/lib\nrespectively.\n. i am\n. /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib\n. same result with cygwin. path and behavior is the same as fedora 24.\n. it does not, no.\n. worked.\n. that bug should be fixed in the latest beta: https://hashcat.net/beta/\n. sounds like you need an opencl runtime then. supported ones by hashcat are:\nIf nvidia, the drivers should include it.\nif intel, beignet is probably your best bet.\n.

Is there an issue with using MinGW's ANSI stdio feature? It removes the PRI formats but adds \u2105z. So the issue is that the find command fails to find the 32-bit include directory and thus disables the glob object. Probably just an issue where the Makefile can't handle the error. Right.

The \"fix\" does nothing but break cygwin building when it works just fine. Here's the beginning from my Fedora build.\nhttps://gist.github.com/neheb/11a5d8afd1ed7fd04892b0e306f73451\nstrictly speaking installing mingw32 fixes the issue but it should not fail like this. File globbing for 64-bit exists.. The whole point of cygwin is to easily cross compile using MinGW. It just errors that cross compiling is not supported. The commit should be reverted.\nAs for the latest one, I will test when I get home.. ...no cygwin is a Linux environment for Windows with a reimplemented POSIX. It's not the same as MSYS2 which is just a front-end for MinGW.\nMeaning running make with cygwin fails for reasons unrelated to this issue.\nIn any case, the 32-bit glob error is now gone. Closing.. It's the same thing as libOpenCL.so, just the cygwin flavor. pocl is the only supported runtime.\nedit: more directly,\n1: all of the other dlopen calls fail. Only this succeeds.\n2: I assume pocl is. yes.\n3: pocl.. Rebasing. Never mind. I really need to stop this.... Yeah I looked through the defines for 32 and 64 compilers and found they both share this one.. Is this on OS X?. agh this also seems to be a problem in 14.04. And only in Ubuntu.\nSo far I have been unable to reproduce in Fedora, MinGW, or Cygwin. This sounds like Ubuntu's version of glibc has a very specific patch to add warn_unused_result to asprintf. Hillarious since neither malloc nor snprintf do.\nI'd suggest adding -Wno-unused-result in the Makefile to silence the warning. . Nvidia GPUs under Mesa are not supported and probably never will be. Install the proprietary drivers.. Actually the first error might not be fixed if this is Ubuntu 14.04. I have a pull request waiting: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers/pull/14/commits/d3efacb69d64c086d1a0508fa4656700e6bd4187. It compiles fine. Not sure if you want any runtime validation(pthreads is broken for some reason).. No. I'll try working on it later today.. My pthreads comment applies to SRC/affinity. Currently, I have it #if'd out to return 0. Cygwin doesn't provide any of the CPU_ functions, cpu_set_t or the pthreads function in that file.\nOriginally, I thought cyOpenCl failed to work properly because of that. But on closer inspection that code shouldn't have anything to do with it.\nWhen I get home, I will do some further testing. That's really interesting that you got the regular Windows runtime to work under cygwin though. My thinking was that you couldn't mix regular win32 DLLs and cygwin(POSIX).. Update: alright this actually works great now. I ran cygwin through ssh (ssh 127.0.0.1) and was able to use the s key to pull up the status. No winpty needed.. For some reason it doesn't actually work with cygOpenCL. Hashcat launches and exits shortly after. I was never able to find the cause.. Although, the : m error is a problem with hashcat since strerror is not used.. It's a clang issue. Try applying this patch: \n`diff --git a/OpenCL/inc_vendor.cl b/OpenCL/inc_vendor.cl\nindex dd11d8f..ff6356f 100644\n--- a/OpenCL/inc_vendor.cl\n+++ b/OpenCL/inc_vendor.cl\n@@ -63,6 +63,10 @@\n #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_amd_media_ops2 : enable\n #endif\n+#ifdef cl_clang_storage_class_specifiers\n+#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_clang_storage_class_specifiers : enable\n+#endif\n+\n /**\n  * Unrolling is generally enabled, for all device types and hash modes\n  * There's a few exception when it's better not to unroll\n`\nedit: unfortunately I can't test this but it should work. Expect slow speeds.\nedit2: actually this will not work either. Northern Islands and below are not supported.. make win32 or win64 makes use of it.. Not related to #1024 .\nThe real issue is that the CRT glob is being used for a non-windows platform (that includes Cygwin) even though it is a MinGW specific thing. Cygwin and MSYS2 (by default) do not generate windows binaries that are usable without Cygwin.dll.\nThe main use case of compiling hashcat with Cygwin is to get proper SSH support (MinGW binaries don't work correctly with Cygwin's sshd due to a difference in input handling).\nOh I also just remembered. I made this after I noticed 100% CPU usage in Cygwin's find command after running make. Although FWIW I've been commenting it out for a while.. Last I remember, MSYS2 creates several shortcuts. The regular MSYS2 is basically equivalent to Cygwin. The MinGW ones compile with MinGW and also change the uname.\nFile globbing only works with MinGW targets. Will do some testing on Windows and update the PR.\nedit: at least MSYS2 fails properly: \nfind: failed to read file names from file system at or below \u2018/\u2019: No such file or directory\nsrc//win_file_globbing.mk:117:\n! The MinGW CRT GLOB library was not found on your system. Please make sure that CRT_glob.o exists\n! ATTENTION: File globbing will be disabled\nActually this makes sense. /cygdrive is where regular drives get mounted. Must be trying to read the whole file system.. Going to resend. Something got messed up.. I'll need to test this again but I believe the MinGW shortcuts provided by MSYS2 change environment variables to help out configure scripts find the right binaries.\nNow, that's important to mention since the hashcat makefile just selects standard GCC under the MinGW environment and compiles a standard POSIX binary.\nI can't say I want to work on this since I'm not an MSYS2 user. They both have different use cases.. @philsmd Cygwin binaries are not meant to be ran from the windows command line. That's what MinGW is for. Pretty sure the tests pass under mintty (or w/e the default shell is called).. FWIW atom tested Mesa before. It's really slow. Plus to get better performance, assembly has to be written (no idea if even possible) since several AMD specific functions are missing in Clover (cl_amd_media_ops and 2).. Log in to https://scan.coverity.com , log in with GitHub account, add project.  Last I remember it took 2 days for them to accept it. After that  hashcat needs to be built and sent to them for analysis.. Ah yes. I remember that from long ago.

I also have a card that errors on Nvapi. The issue is that your card is not a reference design. Using WIN32 was done for consistency purposes. The other relevant ones also have two __ on both sides. Anyway, I'll resend the ADL stuff.. fixed.. sounds like a windows issue. exfat as opposed to fat32 might help.\n\nCould also try using cygwin to change the permissions. or linux. . Why. You could work around that issue by using a pipe. eg.\ncombinator wordlist.dict 4digits.dict | hashcat -a 0 .... fopen fails since the path is UTF-16. Needs to be rewritten to use Windows APIs. I'm gonna close this just because I don't use unicode filenames. The original error is fixed.\nHaving said that, hashcat still cannot handle Unicode files under windows. Let's say you have a file with a unicode name. Hashcat will fail to open that with ??????.txt: No such file or directory. Might want to compile with -Og next time :). Adding attribute((fallthrough)) seems to be the recommended way to silence the warning.. honestly since you're the only one seeing this issue, I recommend bisecting.. Instead of randomly running tests, can you bisect the issue?. driver bug. closing.. cap file is here: https://mega.nz/#!mExTULzA!LD4wYQh8aMoHrWrISh-n3wUnYGdzQq_nA8IVKcRZypQ\npassword: bo$$password. Where is Sha 384 used? I only see it used for FILS which is implemented pretty much nowhere.. Fixed MinGW compile. Had no good solution to it since I would have had to modify lzma_sdk/Alloc.c. I tested the compile on Fedora 26. MinGW that is. It works fine(except for the iconv stuff). So it does work.\nI think I'll just revert to rand(). rand_s is nice since it returns an unsigned 32 bit integer but it looks like it's too much trouble.. Forget it then. done\nedit: One concern I have is that hcmalloc = malloc + memset. The memset zeroes the memory allocated, but I'm sure there's code that does not need this.\nWhich begs the question, is this patch correct or should the memset be removed? I don't think integer overflow is an issue unless we're talking about 32-bit systems. There's also existing code of the form \"void *p = hccalloc(foo, 1).. Add -D 1,2 to command line. Usually not a good idea. Nvidia has a runtime bug that causes 100% CPU usage. Additionally, overall speeds probably won't increase. I think the CPU slows the GPU down. You'll have to test.. Ah bummer. Currently it looks quite clean.

Lol. @jsteube yes. So given that Apple doesn't seem to provide updates to old macOS versions, could justify doing the same here?. AFAIK, those errors come with GPUs where the EC manages the fan, not the GPU itself.\nSo yeah, no problem there.. Will be fixed soon. Consider upgrading OS X to 10.12 or newer.. Because Apple's drivers suck. Simple as that.. Let's see. You could virtualize the GPU. Maybe?\nssh into a system which is properly set up (Windows or Linux). \nI woudln't hold my breath for Apple to make proper drivers.

Note apparent bug in QNX's implementation of SHA-512.\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2015/12/31/1\n. Hey, fantastic !. Somewhat related to #1580. The rules syntax today assume that replacement rules are only one byte for their arguments (so0, etc.). Ideally, a rule syntax that allows delimiting of the two arguments (like /o/0, /oo/00, etc.) would be very valuable for use with multibyte rules and with hex rules. Otherwise, it is difficult to tell when one string argument ends and the next one begins.. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/commit/71a8459d851d246945343ea59effa1d46b965bf8\n. Thanks for the opportunity to weigh in. This may seem like a bit of trouble -- but once the effort is invested, it will benefit many future developers, testers, troubleshooters and researchers forever. :)\nI hadn't thought about the \"compile from uncommitted changes and publish that\" corner case -- good point.\nI agree that compile time alone is useful if commit hash is unavailable or there are uncommitted changes.  But the real value is in being able to compare apples to apples over time for a variety of code states -- and commit hash is almost always the best approximation of that.  IMO, it should be used if it's available. And even when there are betas compiled just for testing, knowing what commit they are derived from is useful.\nSo I'd like to propose always including the commit hash, and if there are uncommitted changes, appending a clean datestamp (and I see that COMPTIME is now based on date +%s, so that's perfect).  \nSo if it's possible (and I don't know if it is), maybe something like (pseudocode):\nVERSION_STAMP := $(shell git rev-parse HEAD | cut -b1-7)\nif (there_are_uncommitted_changes), then\n    VERSION_STAMP := $(VERSION_STAMP)_$(COMPTIME);\nThis would cover the somewhat rare test-compile case cleanly, and still enable future researchers and testers to compare known outputs. And at a glance, everyone can tell if it was based on a specific commit or a local compile (and if a local compile, the commit it was based on).\nThe Makefile would have to know to skip this step if git is not available, of course.  And I've never scripted a check for uncommitted changes, but this looks like a reasonable shell-based approach:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3878624/how-do-i-programmatically-determine-if-there-are-uncommited-changes\nEDIT: changed separator to underscore, fixed some formatting.\n. Once this functionality is available, it would also be awesome if betas pushed to /beta/ had the version stamp appended to the base of the filename, as in:\noclHashcat-2.10b61-cd430d5.7z\nor \noclHashcat-2.10b61-cd430d5_1453306037.7z\nThis way, potential testers can tell at a glance if the code was at a point where testing is relevant for them, and exactly which changes are in play (to the extent feasible).\nRoyce\n. +1. Covers all of the bases reasonably, I think.\n. Awesome!  OK, here's my elevator pitch:\nPosted information about hashing speeds matter - for dev, for troubleshooting, for shopping for GPUs, for academic research, etc.  Now that hashcat is open source and people can be running arbitrary versions, knowing what version was used to create a given piece of output is important. The best way to ensure that all current (and future) uses of output -- most especially, benchmarks and cracking runs -- can be closely tied to what algorithms/code was in use is to include the commit information.\nIf leaving it out of --help is better, I've got no problem with that at all.  But I believe strongly that there is significant value in including it in the startup (so that it shows up in benchmarks and cracking runs).  Knowing which code they came from matters more than it used to.\n. Yes - done.\n. This is usually video driver-related.  Please see our FAQ for more information on how to return your video drivers to a known good state. The FAQ refers to AMD only in spots, but it applies to NVIDIA as well.\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#what_does_the_clgetplatformids_-1001_error_mean\n. https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin2john.py. Try deleting the ./kernels directory and ~/.nv/.  I had this symptom until I did so.\n. Great!  If you could close this ticket as resolved, that will make housekeeping easier.\n. It's a compromise. Same reasoning that I used when I requested the commit hash in the verbose version output -- historical comparison value. A set of stats, even automated stats, is much more useful when you have the context. If people are working with automated stats over time, they will need to know how they were generated. Better IMO to have that as part of the new automated file \"format\", and pay the simple price of cutting away the header (which is very easy, because it's prepended with the comment character).\n. It's the same reason why the performance comparison Google Docs spreadsheet lists which hashcat versions are being compared. I would even suggest expanding the automated format to include the device type as well as the device ID (which could be stripped if not needed) but that's probably too ambitious. :)\n. Please carefully read the link that @jsteube provided.  Depending on the type of hash, dictionary attacks will always be slower than bruteforce on GPU because dictionary attacks cannot take advantage of the parallel nature of the GPU. You can apply rules to your dictionary to achieve higher speeds, but if you are just looking to run through some dictionaries without applying rules, the speeds you are reporting are normal.\n. To reduce the complexity caused by positional parameters, could there be specific flags for dictionary files (--dict) and masks (--mask)? They could be specified more than once (just like -r for rules). Would that help?\nFor backwards compatibility, the default behavior today could be preserved, with the new flags just  disambiguating if needed.\n. Culturally, I suspect that it's left up to user to determine when to feed the entire backlog of discovered plains into an attack. \nThat being said, some kind of \"pre-loopback\" option might be convenient, IMO.\n. This is not as far-fetched as it might appear. https://sites.google.com/site/itstheshappening/\n. 1. I think that most users would expect pausing to trump (take priority over) the timer. That's what I would expect, anyway. :)\n. Per @FiloSottile and @kholia, this is the same hash. https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/771004722010554369\n. Same issue as  two months ago. See https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/436 .\n. Hmm - to clarify, as part of this feature, it sounds like you'd want hashcat to:\n1. Only attempt to crack one of the duplicates, ignoring the others but accumulating a count of them in some way (otherwise, there would be a massive waste of RAM and processing power), and ...\n2. After a hash is cracked, write all duplicate plains to the potfile, so that statistics could be derived directly from the potfile?\nI think this is probably not what @jsteube et al will want to do. Removing duplicates keeps the code simple, keeps GPU RAM usage low, etc.\nAlso, it is trivial to script taking an original hash frequency count and a potfile and generate the statistics. I don't know of a published script, though - it would be nice to have a reference implementation. \nWhat are you currently doing to get the statistics that you need?\n. I see the appeal. If hashcat optionally accumulated the duplicate count on intake, the duplicate count could be part of an output format, such as:\n16 | duplicatecount:hash[:salt]:plain:hex_plain\n@jsteube, would accumulating that duplicate count slow hash loading/dedupe much?\n. There isn't enough GPU memory to hold your attack. hashcat cannot handle this scenario - only you can (either by getting a card with more memory, getting more cards ... or as you said, by dividing up the job). \nUnless I'm misunderstanding your question. :) How could hashcat better handle this?\n. It's not a dumb suggestion at all -- but it is probably outside the hashcat project's current scope. If it's something that can easily be scripted externally, @atom is usually less inclined to take it on as an internal feature. But you're not crazy. :)\n. I think it's sometimes hash-dependent, but should always be pretty close to that ratio. Starting with that ratio, and then doing a bisect (binary walk) should narrow it down pretty quickly.\n. For future searchers, note that I did a survey of real-world memory allocation across multiple platforms.\nhttps://gist.github.com/roycewilliams/5ac28350023613c614034c7fb6ba715d\nSummary of findings:\n\nAt this writing, NVIDIA never exceeds 25%\nAMD, Intel, and pocl sometimes exceed 25%\npocl sometimes makes 100% available (or claims to in hashcat output, anyway)\n\nAnd if I learn any useful technical information, I'll post it to this NVIDIA forums thread:\nhttps://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/992502/cuda-programming-and-performance/why-is-cl_device_max_mem_alloc_size-never-larger-than-25-of-cl_device_global_mem_size-only-on-nvidia-/\n. That is correct. Support for all platforms and devices has been centralized around OpenCL.\n. Can reproduce. Not sure how to produce useful debugging.

I've added a thumbs up, but I have no real understanding of the level of effort required.. Tests as fixed for me - thanks!. Fantastic. This will really help with the learning curve for new users. Very happy to see this.. I've been using hashcat for a couple of years and I sometimes have to stop to think about it. :)  The current method is a relatively rare way to handle options.\nI wouldn't mind seeing something like --attack-mode [straight|combination|bruteforce|wordlist-mask|mask-wordlist], with minimum-disambiguation strings (s,c,b,w,m) allowed. The mode numbers would also still be allowed, of course.\nIt would also make the examples self-documenting, and easier for new users to understand.. Playing devil's advocate for a moment ...\nIf the usability problem that you're describing was widespread and considered to not be worth the tradeoff, more projects would use numeric commandline options.\nThe disambiguation problem that you're describing is one that every other mature command-line utility that I'm aware of (outside of the hashcat family) manages. I don't know of any other mature project outside of the hashcat family that relies solely on numeric options.. @DoZ10, you can check the closed PRs for recent examples of new algorithms - especially the ones that are all done in a single PR - so you can get a clean picture of the full scope of what needs to be done.. From http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/MODES.shtml:\n\nThis is the mode you should start cracking with. It will use the login names, \"GECOS\" / \"Full Name\" fields, and users' home directory names as candidate passwords, also with a large set of mangling rules applied. Since the information is only used against passwords for the accounts it was taken from (and against password hashes which happened to be assigned the same salt), \"single crack\" mode is much faster than wordlist mode. This permits for the use of a much larger set of word mangling rules with \"single crack\", and their use is always enabled with this mode. Successfully guessed passwords are also tried against all loaded password hashes just in case more users have the same password.. Examples are now documented here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack#using_p_nth_instance_of_a_character_with_positional_rules. @solardiz, @0xbsec - good points, both. The distinction is indeed important. I lacked the vocabulary to make it - thanks. Fixed.. I found @neheb's hashcat-utils integration also:\n\nhttps://scan.coverity.com/projects/hashcat-utils. Heh - I see what you did there, @ratzrattillo . :) http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/attachments/jwt-flowchart.png. @ratzrattillo Indeed :) I was acknowledging your wink. I could tell that you already knew why. :). I hadn't thought of that, but that seems interesting. I was thinking a few things, all of which basically boil down to \"least likely is also interesting\" :) :\n\n\nFor keyspaces small enough to exhaust on a given platform, the user can get a higher percentage of harder-to-crack plains first. Depending on your use case, that might be a feature.\n\n\nFor keyspaces too large to exhaust on a given platform, the user can explore parts of the \"Markov keyspace\" that would otherwise be inaccessible on that platform.\n\n\nNow that we have display of candidates, the user can learn more about the far end of Markov.\n\n\nNow that I think about it, \"start the attack at this part of the Markov/keyspace\" might be even better. It would provide a way to divide up the keyspace for distributed work, or a way to do a poor-man's resumption of work if the original work state was lost. If that would be easier than inverting it, that would be an interesting alternative.. I don't actually understand enough about Markov to know whether it can be started/resumed at an arbitrary point in the keyspace without other session information. If it can't, my later idea above is nonsensical.. I imagine that I could explore the far end of Markov for a given keyspace with the load-distribution features (--skip/--limit) and --stdout. I'll tinker with that. Thanks for the detailed explanation - should be informative for future searchers.. For the curious, here's what (I think?) appears to be the other end of the current default markov for some sets of ?a:\n```\n$ hashcat --version\nv3.5.0-76-gb924901b\n$ hashcat -a 3 --skip=81450624 --limit=1 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --stdout | tail\n'~}}~|~\n)~}}~|~\n:~}}~|~\n{~}}~|~\n\\~}}~|~\n]~}}~|~\n\n~}}~|~\n|y}}~|~\n}~}}~|~\n ~}}~|~\n\n$ hashcat -a 3 --skip=7737809374 --limit=1 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --stdout | tail\n'~}}~|~}\n)~}}~|~}\n:~}}~|~}\n{~}}~|~}\n\\~}}~|~}\n]~}}~|~}\n\n~}}~|~}\n|y}}~|~}\n}~}}~|~}\n ~}}~|~}\n\n$ hashcat -a 3 --skip=735091890624 --limit=1 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --stdout | tail\n'~}}~|~}~\n)~}}~|~}~\n:~}}~|~}~\n{~}}~|~}~\n\\~}}~|~}~\n]~}}~|~}~\n\n~}}~|~}~\n|y}}~|~}~\n}~}}~|~}~\n ~}}~|~}~\n```. FWIW, I also see this as an easy/lightweight way to get simple load-distribution effects without dividing up the keyspace, or in addition to dividing up the keyspace - even if only on a temporary basis, and quickly, since no calculations would be required. You can guess why I thought of this in the last 48 hours ;)\n\nHowever, I now also think that the same effect could be achieved by having an option to the tool that creates the Markov stats file, to tell it to invert the Markov while creating it. This would provide more flexibility (and be much easier) than telling Hashcat itself to try to \"invert\" the Markov (which might be hard and it might not be clear how that would work anyway).\nIf it were simply a matter of inverting a basic frequency table, this could be simulated by inverting that table and then getting statistics from it. But Markov is obviously more complex than just frequency. :). GitHub isn't the support path for hashcat - the forums are. Also, please don't cross-post to GitHub and the forums.. The PR is still pending at this writing, but this may be enough fodder for an extraction utility:\nhttps://github.com/e-ago/JohnTheRipper/blob/6fb90c306f420f179db3d143962dbc36daeebba2/src/bitlocker2john.c\nNot sure if this is just a staged copy, or something that's actually functional yet.\n. See also https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/pull/2728. This is more of a usage thing that's more appropriate for the forums if it needs to be addressed further, but you have a few options to truncate depending on context.\n\n\nYou can stack rulesets. So you can add a second ruleset with -r that just contains '8\n\n\nUsing  -j '8 or -k '8\n\n\nAppending '8 to all lines in your ruleset\n\n\nBut even then, you're likely to get duplicates, because all these do is truncate.\nAlso note that unless it's a pretty slow hash, or most of your rules result in strings longer than 8, there's no need to be worried about a few % of strings that are too long.. ~~ Ah, sorry. OK, then creating a rule file with '>8' in it, and then adding it as a second -r (so -r myrules.rule -r min8.rule) may do the trick.~~ Using > -in an -r ruleset doesn't work:\nCannot convert rule for use on OpenCL device in file /var/local/rules/min8.rule on line 1: >8\n-j / -k should skip post-rules plains without trying to hash them. You'll see plains less than 7 in --stdout output, but they'll show up in the \"Rejected\" status line.. It did checkpoint-quit at this point.

For future searchers - my intuition is that for any given run, there would be roughly x restore points that are each 1/x percent of the total. If there's a quick way to capture why not, then it might head off future questions. I will add the answer to the FAQ.. More broadly, the deep symptom you're describing seems to be that it sometimes takes a long time to find out that syntax or inputs are obviously wrong.\nYou're definitely right that simple checks -- for the existence of files and directories, sanity/format of masks, etc. -- need to happen earlier in some cases. Moving them prior to expensive phases like checking for duplicates, sorting hashes, etc. would be a big win. The need for this becomes more obvious as the number of hashes goes up.\nThings that should happen up front or sooner (some of which may already be there, just listing them for completeness):\n\n\nChecking for existence and permissions of all required files and directories (both the ones specified on the command line, and the default/assumed ones)\n\n\nWhether or not the combinations of command line options and flags are compatible and sane\n\n\nWhether or not the hashes in the file are the expected length and composition (I would like to have the default behavior be that as soon as a single hash is seen as obviously incorrect, the entire run aborts instead of trying to continue to load them all, and to have this check happen quickly up front instead of after all hashes are loaded, deduped, sorted, etc.)\n\n\nIt would also be useful for an early rough guess for resources on the target platform. If each hash format hash a relatively well known memory requirement (or at least a rough upper bound), we can probably make a pretty good guess as to if the job will fit on the current platform. Even a rough check of size of hashes file and rule count against available OpenCL memory would go a long way to stopping a nonsensical command line very early.. @jsteube , my apologies for the potentially contentious feedback earlier. I recognize that hashcat has made huge advances in making sanity checks much earlier in a run than in the past. I know that a lot of work has gone into it, and it has helped me to learn hashcat because it is now more forgiving of my errors. :)\nThat being said, it's clear that the original poster has at least one use case where they are experiencing feedback later in the process than expected. I, too, would like to hear more from them about the exact syntax used, to address any issue.\nI myself encountered an issue recently where I thought that hashcat could have aborted much sooner. Unfortunately, I did not record it at the time. :( So I have tried to rediscover it today. In my testing, I discovered a few other cases where sanity checks for naive or unusual input may still be needed. \nI also suspect that any remaining delayed-feedback failure modes are probably now rare for experienced users. But they are more likely to be triggered by unusual or naive use cases. It is common for new users to try \"creative\" things that are more likely to result in typos or nonsensical combinations. I think that it is a good idea to be supportive of new and creative uses of hashcat, and I believe that a good way to support that is to provide extra sanity checking for syntax and inputs ... where time permits. :)\nPlease be gentle, as I do not mean to pile these on as an insult. I just wanted to capture the effort so that others could work from the list if needed. \n\n\nWhen an invalid attack mode (such as \"-a bogus\" or \"-a 9\") is specified, all hashes are loaded and the attack run begins, assuming stdin input. Solution: check for invalid attack modes early.\n\n\nSpecifying a directory as rules input (\"-r /var/tmp/dir\") is accepted. Hashcat pauses for a very long time at \"Generated bitmap tables\". (It appears that hashcat may be trying to parse the directory as a ruleset? This could have weird side effects we should avoid). Reading rules from a directory was a recent feature request, so naive users may try this. Solution: check if -r input is directory and reject.\n\n\nAn empty rules file (\"-r /var/tmp/emptyfile\") is not detected until after the expensive activities of loading all hashes, etc is completed. (This one may seem iffy, but this could happen if, for example, a script tried to combine rules files automatically but experienced an error, resulting in a zero-byte rules file). I think this may have been the one I encountered. Solution: Detect and reject empty rules files early.\n\n\nI also found some incidental ones that are not delayed-feedback issues, but may also need attention at some point:\n\n\nAn empty session name (\"--session=\") is accepted, resulting in a functional run, but using run files with an empty filename prefix, and just the bare file/dir names '.pid', '.outfiles', '.log', etc. Solution: explicitly reject empty session names.\n\n\nAn empty potfile path (\"--potfile-path=\") is accepted. This results in an immediate error, but the error is \"No such file or directory\". Solution: explicitly reject empty potfile paths \n\n\nAn empty restore-file path (\"--restore-file-path=\") is accepted. I am not sure if this is supposed to be interpreted the same as \"--restore-disable\" or not, but should probably return an error.\n\n\n(And really, any other cmdline options that are expecting a value should reject an empty one, which might be common when using scripts or environment variables)\nAll tests above were against v3.40-49-g20057d8.\nIf you prefer, I can create a new issue for the items that I found. \n\"Why the heck would anyone do that?\" is a reasonable response to many of these. :) However, note also that, beyond naive users, but not yet at the level of using the full API, there are also people who want to do simple scripting around hashcat work. Scripting errors can also cause unusual failure modes, like empty variables, files that are supposed to be directories and vice versa, etc. In other words, while naive users might do silly things on purpose, experienced users might do unexpected things as side effects of upstream processes like scripting, so weird corner cases are IMO worth pursuing.\nEven if the items that I found are not a high priority for the core team, if other people can submit PRs for them, it might be worth tracking.. Note also that the tags/names for these attributes were just enough to disambiguate but are otherwise pretty artless, so they could be changed to whatever is best, of course. :). That's interesting - bummer that it's a net loss from a support load perspective. FWIW, if an automatic bypass existed for average per hour and average per day, I would probably use them a lot.. Confirmed as non-reproducible on my side. I am not sure now how I got that case. \nI have a shell script with each test case in it to capture exactly what parameters I used, and this one now behaves as expected. \nIf I can determine that it really was happening, I will open a separate issue.. Problems with operating hashcat should probably be posted on the hashcat forum instead.\nhttps://hashcat.net/forum/\nYour problem is shown in the error:\n\"Intel's OpenCL runtime (GPU only) is currently broken\"\nThis may or may not be workaround for you:\n\"You can use --force to override this but do not post error reports if you do so\"\nAs the error says, this is a problem that Intel must fix in their GPU OpenCL driver. It's possible that if there is a version of Intel's GPU OpenCL driver that is newer than your version, that might work.\n. Rather than truncating, a compression notation (...) that leaves both beginning and end of the target hash might be better, as in:\n$7z$0$19$0$salt$8$f6196259a7326e3f0000000000000000$185065650$112$98$f3b...421cf2\n. Fair question!\nI suggest using the current maximum screen width for ordinary output (the HWMon lines), which appears to be 80, as a starting point (well, actually 81, if the number of lanes is 16!). My example above was intended to be aligned with that.\nThat being said, some native consoles (such as some used on FreeBSD) actually force an extra linewrap to appear if 80 characters are used, so 79 characters may be a better universal choice.\nI also personally like the idea of showing only the last 6 or 8 characters (or so), so that the maximum amount of non-digest material (before the last $) is shown. Most hash formats tend to prepend non-digest material, rather than appending it, so I think that would generally work.\nShould the compression itself be a user-configurable option? Or should we simply compress all hashes above a certain size (and if so, at what threshold? And should that threshold be user-configurable?) I don't want to bog down in too many options, but people may have strong and differing opinions that would be satisfied by making the compression and the length configurable.\n. That's fair.. Great call with tightening up the width overall - much appreciated!. Thanks! You and @jsteube were my primary target audience, so if it's a good writeup (and a successful one!), then mission accomplished. I also wanted to try to create a good example for others to use as a reference.\nMinor edit: I added a few more 'hashcat' NetBSD examples, to demonstrate the spread of the iteration counts.. Ah, indeed - I missed the mention of SHA-256 and SHA-512 from 3.13 onwards in the Juniper docs. Thanks, @sgerraty! (And good to hear from you. I'm a FreeBSD and Juniper fan - thanks for your work on both.). @philsmd, @jsteube - works like a charm - thanks! And quite impressive turnaround time!\nFor reference, this new mode (Juniper/NetBSD sha1crypt) is mode 15100, and was committed in d1b2fa0b31995c74b11bf1699a469ed4a513086d..

I don't know a lot about it yet, but this thread may be informative:\nhttps://bugs.archlinux.org/task/39203. @jsteube - First of all, thanks for considering this!\nOK, I can't pretend to understand the underlying complexity. :) I'm fine with you changing the format from the original request into whatever works better. If we can skip some complexity of the layers in this pass, I would say go for it.\nNot knowing any better, I assume that we can easily know these things:\n\nLiteral start and stop time of hashcat itself\nLiteral start and stop time of dictionary caching\nLiteral start and stop time of guessing\n\nNaively, from these, I would think that we can calculate all of the values I was curious about:\nDictionary caching = dict stop - dict start\nOther setup = total setup - dictionary caching\nTotal setup = literal start - guessing start\nGuessing = guessing stop - guessing start\nTotal time = literal stop - literal start\nAs to how to export the values, is the additional work for using hashcat_status_t complex work, or just boring work? If it's boring work, I would expect that it would be useful to have this info from the API, and it would be worth the cost.\nI trust your judgment on the right balance between functionality and effort. . @philsmd - Concur 100%. I should have caught that. I think that I have them synced now. It was relatively easy to sync usage.c and interface.c (because I could automate comparing them), but docs/readme.txt is a whole other animal (significantly different names, multiple hash types rolled up into single entries, different sort order), so I just manually fixed the obvious things like case in readme.txt, but otherwise had to defer for time/consensus. \nI tried to research the conflicts -- such like exact version numbers in CMSes, etc where hashing methods changed -- but I may have made some errors, so a sanity check would be great.. Once this PR is stable and accepted, I'll also sync the names as shown in the example hashes page on the hashcat.net wiki.. Wiki is synced now, except for some differences due to specific hash examples being different even though the hash mode is the same (MD5 phpBB vs Joomla, etc.) or other such purpose-specific differences.. Something doesn't sound right. @XxoraxX, could you post your command line (with hashes redacted), including any errors that hashcat produces?. Are the whitespace differences a correction to follow the existing standard, or were they inadvertent?. This is really more a question for the hashcat forums.\nYour question isn't really whether this GPU is supported by hashcat, so much as whether there is OpenCL available for the GM45. From a brief search, it looks to me like there is no OpenCL for this chip. OpenCL is required for modern (GPU-based) hashcat. You can still use hashcat-legacy on CPU.\n.

Indeed. I like the unified machine-readable and human-readable lower-case simplicity. As you can see, committed as such. Thanks for speaking up.. Up for me at this writing; still down for you, @shaunwarman ?. Totally understood. This has been debated quite a bit on IRC, and @jsteube has no plans to revert this. \nThe workaround in Kali that you're describing -- arbitrarily picking a different version number that never existed upstream -- is unusual and not recommended, as it can make things much worse.\nFortunately, for Debian/Ubuntu variants, there is a well-known way to handle this:\nhttps://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version\nepoch\nThis is a single (generally small) unsigned integer. It may be omitted, in which case zero is assumed. If it is omitted then the upstream_version may not contain any colons.\nIt is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions of a package, and also a package's previous version numbering schemes, to be left behind.. As I said, @jsteube has made it very clear that this isn't going to change. And I do get exactly what you're saying, and I even personally agree a bit. But two release cycles have happened since, and they're not going to be reverted.. And that is why deciding to use arbitrary version numbers in the packages -- that match no existing upstream versioning and don't even match each other -- was ill-advised.\nThe most robust thing to have done would have been to make a one-time correction, just as @jsteube described. The best way to do this would have been with epoch.\nAnd at this point, even with the multiple unrelated version numbers in play, using epoch is still the best way to fix the situation and move on.\nBut please don't continue to change the downstream version numbers out of sync with the true version number. If you think that using epoch confuses users ... arbitrary, made-up version numbers will surely confuse everyone even more. The hashcat project will start getting bug reports for version numbers that have never existed and never will. It will be a nightmare.\nThe best thing, both for hashcat and the downstreams, is to bump everything to 1:3.6.0 ASAP, and move forward.. @sergiolover Do you have any info on how popular SunShop CMS might be, or what other platforms might use this algorithm? If I search for \"SunShop CMS\", I get almost no hits.. As a control group, the speeds are identical on my 2012 Macbook Air:\n```\n$ ./hashcat -m 2500 -b\nhashcat (v3.6.0-48-g52c1e15f) starting in benchmark mode...\nOpenCL Platform #1: Apple\n\nDevice #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3317U CPU @ 1.70GHz, skipped.\nDevice #2: HD Graphics 4000, 384/1536 MB allocatable, 16MCU\n\nHashtype: WPA/WPA2\nSpeed.Dev.#2.....:     2954 H/s (85.57ms)\n\n$ ./hashcat -m 2500 -b\nhashcat (v3.6.0-51-g56dc8ae3) starting in benchmark mode...\nOpenCL Platform #1: Apple\n\nDevice #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3317U CPU @ 1.70GHz, skipped.\nDevice #2: HD Graphics 4000, 384/1536 MB allocatable, 16MCU\n\nHashtype: WPA/WPA2\nSpeed.Dev.#2.....:     2959 H/s (85.57ms)\n```. Interesting - could be handy.\n@usernamestaken, a related side note: \nMultiple search engines seem to suppress the example-hashes wiki page sometimes. We are not sure why. The page is still there, but is removed entirely from search results, even when using very specific search strings.. It may be useful to separate with tabs or pipes instead, to support various CSV-parsing systems. This will also sidestep any potential commas-in-the-hash-name parsing issues.. @usernamestaken - stray wrapping with leftover quoting around line 17:\n400|\"phpass, WordPress (MD5),\nJoomla (MD5)\"|$P$984478476IagS59wHZvyQMArzfx58u.. Closer ... but the GitHub CSV parser still sees an error (though I'm honestly not sure why yet):\nhttps://github.com/usernamestaken/hashcat/blob/f38fd0f47f2141fab97cfc265b086b4a543d98b0/docs/example_hashes.csv\nMaybe because it's the first record that actually contains commas. Maybe tab-separated would be more universally applicable. Kinda flying by the seat of my pants here. :). Fair. My only reason for citing the online viewer was that if its parser is happy, most other tools will probably also have no problem. Glad to have it, regardless. I hope it's accepted.. Ah, didn't realize that was there! A cmdline option to show them could be handy.. Will do. May be a few days before I can get to it.. Side question: what real-world systems allow '$' in the salt? That would have to be a pretty deliberate and specific modification to the algorithm without a lot of payoff.. @extended11 It's off-topic, but I'm very interested in descrypt in its historical context, so I'd love to confer with you offline in more detail. I'm quite Google-stalkable. :).  For what it's worth, I can reproduce this on the latest.\n```\n$ hashcat -V\nv3.6.0-328-ge6cb69e\n$ cat empty.pot\n$ cat testhashes\n1$ccccccccccc\n1$QQQQQQQQQQQ\n1qYYYYYYYYYYY\n1qwwwwwwwwwww\n1rwwwwwwwwwww\n1rsssssssssss\n$ hashcat -m 1500 --left --potfile-path=empty.pot testhashes\n1$ccccccccccc\n1$YYYYYYYYYYY\n1$QQQQQQQQQQQ\n1$wwwwwwwwwww\n1rsssssssssss\n1rwwwwwwwwwww\n```. Recent John the Ripper work is probably relevant:\nhttps://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/issues/2658\nhttps://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/pull/2659. John the Ripper has a working implementation now, with sample data - see https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/issues/2658. it's a pretty rare corner case, with a known workaround (HEX-ify, then convert that to hex and use --hex-wordlist (i've been calling this \"hexception\"):\nhttps://gist.github.com/roycewilliams/8f3bf8e3109f771b1b773265317c6c1c\n... so it won't hurt my feelings if this is a wontfix ... though there may be a better fix for the more general case..

Admittedly, somewhat rare - but there are a few real-world scenarios where it's needed ... and I think that the number of such use cases is probably only going to increase.\nAm I crazy, or could a reasonable cap on maximum number of allowed hashes be dynamically calculated, based on hash type, allocated memory, and attack type ... maybe even just roughly?\n[Edit: or perhaps, whatever boundary condition is happening that is causing a silent failure could be detected, and used as part of the calculation of the maximum?]. Hmm, I don't see why not (as long as that something is something that varies directly with the number of SHA1 hashes (in this case)). What are the other possibilities?. If there is any value in narrowing the threshold down further, I'd be happy to binary walk it a bit.\nBut just using the information in the issue, should the \"no cracks but no errors\" case be trivial to reproduce?. An interesting find - thanks very much!. This should be closed as \"wontfix - maximum leetness already achieved\" (at least until we reach #31337). Confirmed - this addresses the issue. Thanks! (and credit/blame to @m33x, who noticed that the number was coming up).

There is currently no way to fix this within hashcat. Only Intel can provide a fix.\nYou can also add --force to your hashcat parameters, but it may not work well, and if it has errors, they are not hashcat's fault..

Please close the issue and (if you really can't figure it out at all with all the documentation wiki/faq/hashcat forums) you can open a new thread on the hashcat forum..

It was to demonstrate how useless it is.. Concur - unable to replicate, must have been install cruft. Closing, thanks!. From a downstream maintainer's perspective, \"outdated\" usually means \"there's a later release available\". :) 3.6.0 is indeed the most recent formal release. (Many changes have been made in preparation for the next release, but it is not yet released (but very close)).. Nice - thanks! This will provide a good UX safety net for new users.. Awesome - thanks!. The mask is A) far too large for hashcat to handle and B) even if it could would take thousands of years to complete. You will need to know more about your target plaintext in order to attack it.. This is a question for the forums, not for a GitHub issue.\nThis is informational only. If you ask for optimized kernels (with -O), but there is no separate optimized kernel needed (there is no speed difference), you get this warning.

I'd be curious to hear from @magnumripper about how this \"S\" rule is implemented in JtR, relative to keyboard and character sets. It would have to be a keyboard-specific lookup table of some kind, I guess? It sounds a bit complicated.. I am also interested in all hashes. ;). This is an extremely old version of hashcat. Please upgrade to the latest at hashcat.net.. Anything related to SL3 is verboten in the hashcat community. Long story (which predates my work with the project, but here are some breadcrumbs):\nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#how_can_i_crack_sl3\nhttps://hashcat.net/forum/thread-1887.html\nFurther, any version of hashcat that supports SL3 is so old that it is no longer supported in any way.\nFurther, as I understand it, cudaHashcat-lite v0.9 shouldn't even work anymore unless you're running a cracked version that circumvents time controls.. Perhaps the blob could be created only if the hashlist is above a certain size in bytes, as presented by the filesystem.. This is a question that is better suited for the hashcat forums.\nBut yes, the Truecrypt 62xx family of hash types supports at least some of the possible cascades.. I don't understand the question. Can you give an example (that doesn't use a real/sensitive hash)?. This is probably not a use case for hashcat. In the passwords/crypto context, two hashes being \"less than\" or \"greater than\" each other is irrelevant - because they are randomly distributed by design.. Hi! The hashcat Github is for development of hashcat. This is a question better suited to the support section of the hashcat forums. Please post your question there.. If the version of hashcat in the prompt in your directory (3.30) is the version you're running, that's an extremely old version. Please download the latest (4.10) from hashcat.net and retest. \nYou may also want to make sure you're running the latest version of Kali, as I've heard that a number of OpenCL-related issues have been fixed there.. You appear to be using --force. What warnings is hashcat giving you that are prompting you to use --force?. If the above is a real hash, please delete it and replace it with a hash with a known plaintext (along with the plaintext).. This is a question better suited to the hashcat forums.. There was a change in 4.1.0 that made it necessary to change to the hashcat directory, instead of using full paths. I don't know enough about it to know if there's a better way.\n- Files: Switched back to relative current working directory on windows to work around problems with Unicode characters. I'm open to suggestions on the best way to approach it. Naively, I would say make any part of a rule that isn't the rule directive, but rather the rule argument, interpreted as hex.\nMaybe something like:\n$! would instead be $21\n$0 would instead be $30\nYou could then do a high-frequency newline append with $0a, for example.\nOne problem, of course, is that it would be very nice to be able to do multibyte substitutions, but the rules syntax today assume that replacement rules are only one byte for their arguments (so0, etc.). Ideally, a rule syntax that allows delimiting of the two arguments (like /o/0, /oo/00, etc.) would be very valuable for use with hex rules.\n. Yes, only using hex in the characters seems best.\nI do not intend to mix this up with multibyte, but I do think that we should keep multibyte in mind for the future for this. I will add my comment about multibyte to that other issue.\nTo avoid mixed up rules, we could simply not allow them. We could say that if --hex-rules is used, all rules will be interpreted as hex, and that if --hex-rules is not used, then no rules will be interpreted as hex. I can see how that would be a little bit inconvenient - it would mean that if you wanted to mix, you would have to convert all rules to hex rules. But I am not sure of a better way to resolve this.. Ah, I see. What I didn't realize is that single-byte printable ASCII can be handled natively by hashcat rule processing!\nI still see value in preparing to handle non-printable single-byte (linefeeds, control characters, etc.). Since rules syntax will need to be updated to handle multibyte, I recommend that the future update to rules syntax also have a way to specify hex, perhaps using 0x notation or similar. And IMO, that work could be done independently of the multibyte work (or at least in parallel).. Wow, that's fantastic! I should have searched for other implementations that could be compatible. Thanks very much! This won't get a high number of additional passwords - but the ones that it does get will be interesting!. ... and it works like a charm! \n(Hmm - note the extra newline in the output; should passwords with non-printable ASCII be automatically HEX-ified?)\n```\n$ echo \"passwordwithtrailingnewline\" | md5sum\nc35dd5862611090e628ebab5a25f21d9  -\n$ echo 'c35dd5862611090e628ebab5a25f21d9' >target.hash\n$ cat target.hash\nc35dd5862611090e628ebab5a25f21d9\n$ echo \"$\\x0a\" > test.rule\n$ cat test.rule\n$\\x0a\n$ echo \"passwordwithtrailingnewline\" > test.dict\n$ cat test.dict\npasswordwithtrailingnewline\n$ hashcat --quiet -a 0 -m 0 -r test.rule target.hash test.dict\nc35dd5862611090e628ebab5a25f21d9:passwordwithtrailingnewline\n$ tail -2 ~/.hashcat/hashcat.potfile \nc35dd5862611090e628ebab5a25f21d9:passwordwithtrailingnewline\n$\n```. * Please don't post unknown hashes.\n* Once the hashes are obfuscated, this is a question better suited to the hashcat forums.. I have seen this question from multiple users. It might be good to expand the error message from \"Custom-charset X is undefined\" to \"Custom-charset 1 is missing from the mask file\" or similar, to anticipate similar questions in the future.. Confirmed fixed, thanks for the speed!. IMO, since it's being appended to the end of the existing format, I would expect most implementations to be forward-compatible (or be OK with making a tweak to match it), rather than having its own flag. Just my $0.02.. What category/family should this be? It's not really a password manager per se, but it sort of is.. It would be good to have such an example. In the meantime, see: \nhttps://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat_utils#hcstat2gen\nThis wiki entry is very new, so it isn't showing up yet in Google search results for this problem.. Good alternative - added to the wiki. Thanks!. Also, don't forget to update changes.txt - this is a cool add to be able to brag about. :). If there are more than one OTP formats that could be eventually supported, giving them their own category could neatly solve the short-vs-long issue.. That seems perfect for the official algo. name. If the last column of the --help output (which currently has things like \"Operating Systems\", etc.) could use the category name of \"One-Time Passwords\", I think it would meet the rest of the\"findability\" goal.. Also a way to change the timeout period. Since the default used to be to never time out, maybe a --stdin-timeout=[seconds] option, and when the user uses \"0\" (zero) for [seconds], it is disabled?. JtR reference: https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/pull/3449. Confirmed - I was reading too fast and misread the netstat output.. Unable to reproduce.\n```\n$ cat sha1.hash\nca9b29bf69a2416bb90b6867fa1f6a16f326558c\n$ cat sha1.list\nsongcodondetienuongruouasdqwez\n$ hashcat --quiet -m 100 -a 0 sha1.hash sha1.list\nca9b29bf69a2416bb90b6867fa1f6a16f326558c:songcodondetienuongruouasdqwez\n```. For completeness, I would expect even deprecated schemes to be potential cracking targets.\nI have a set here (actual functional containers) that includes RIPEMD-160 - could they be used as a start?\nhttps://www.techsolvency.com/passwords/hashcat-veracrypt/\nThe password for each of them is 'hashcat'.. Hey, thanks back! :) And sorry my test cases weren't more obviously available - I never even noticed the .tc ones were there, and making the .vc ones part of the actual test suite never even occurred to me! I've now made my test cases public and discoverable.. You're using naive-hashcat, which is not managed by the hashcat project. Please either provide the hashcat commandline generated by naive-hashcat, or else start your inquiry with that project.\nPlease also note that the only driver/OpenCL combinations officially supported by hashcat are the ones listed at the top of hashcat.net. Analyzing such problems is better conducted on the hashcat forum.. Huh, I had no idea that multiple masks weren't allowed - just never tried it before! So that explains why my second example doesn't work, but I don't understand yet why my first example doesn't work.. That's unfortunate for my (admittedly unusual) use case - I was deliberately searching for collisions. \nBut isn't that what --keep-guessing is for - finding collisions? Otherwise, why need --keep-guessing at all?\nThis would also mean that limits.txt would need to be updated, because it's not only \"the same password twice for the same hash\", but also \"two different passwords for the same hash\".. Since hashcat's behavior varies depending on hash type (as it should), the user should IMO be able to control this behavior from the command line, or at least for hashcat to help with common user confusion.\nOne way to resolve this would be for --keep-guessing to take an optional parameter, so you could say \"--keep-guessing 0\" to turn it off.\nThis could make the help something like this:\n--keep-guessing            |      | Keep guessing after crack (some algos only); 0 = off |\nAnother way to help would be for the logic something like this:\n\nIf user asks for --keep-guessing but hash type is already NEVERCRACK, reject the commandline.\nIf user asks for --no-keep-guessing (or 0, whatever is chosen), but hash type is not NEVERCRACK, reject the commandline.\nIf user asks for --no-keep-guessing (or whatever), and --keep-guessing, reject the commandline.\n\n. Hey, that seems like a good idea!. To simplify and to conserve screen real estate, I suggest:\nLengths supported by kernel: passwords: 0  - 55; salts: 0 - 51. Maybe we could combine the output somehow, like always saying both:\nKernel type in use: [pure|optimized]\nPure kernels (no -O) allow longer lengths but are usually slower.\n    Pure lengths supported for this hashtype: passwords: 0 - X; salts: 0 - Y\nOptimized kernels (-O) are often faster, but only work with shorter lengths.\n    Optimized lengths supported for this hashtype: passwords: 0 - Z; salts: 0 - Q. That's fair, understood. Though I would also argue that it's the level of information that matches the actual complexity. Most users will ignore it. The ones who do not will be the ones who need to know it. :). ",
    "Rich5": "Interesting. I wasn't aware of an iptables API until now. I did find this link regarding IPTC - http://www.bani.com.br/2012/05/programmatically-managing-iptables-rules-in-c-iptc/\nIs this similar to what you were looking for?\nIf I understand you correctly would the functionality look something like this pseudocode? \n```\ninclude \"oclhashcat.h\"\nstruct hc_options {\n    ....\n} options\nstruct hc_statuc {\n    ....\n}status\nint main (int argc, char **argv) {\nhc = oclhashcat_init()\noptions.hash_file = \"example0.hash\"\noptions.markov_threshold = 32\noptions.words_files.append(\"example.dict\")\noptions.mask = \"?a?a?a?a\"\nstatus = hc.start(options)\n\n}\n```\nThe next step is I would write up a specification before putting any code down.\n. ok so this sounds somewhat similar to what I was doing with pyhashcat. Might be a dumb question, but in this case oclhashcat would remain an exe rather than a importable library correct? Seems like the oclhashcat_init, generate_commandline, and start functions would be in a separate library that's actually providing process handling to call the oclhashcat exe. If so, you're right, that's a much easier way to start. \n. Ok, this is way more clear to me now. How can I help?\n. Sounds good. I'll put together an overview document to get started.\n. I'm making incremental progress on this. One issue I'm running into is determining if an argument has been changed. For example, if the developer sets a variable like this,\nhc.option1 = 1\nhow do we know that option1 has been changed, and should be passed to the apimain function? If C had reflection this would be a bit easier.  The simplest way is to hard code checks of every possible arg and check if it's changed from it's default value defined at the top of oclhashcat.c which would result in a large series of \"if\" statements. \nThis isn't the most elegant approach, but should work. If this is the way you want to go I can finish a prototype of how invokcation would work fairly soon. The other option is to implement some sort of setter function that tracks what args have been set. Another option is to create a hash table for a dictionary lookup rather than a struct to hold the options. This would change the syntax of the API a little though. It wouldn't quite be as clean as using the dot operator as you mentioned above.\nI might be over complicating this though.\n. No, it was not meant to be criticism of C, just a side comment. I was going off our previous discussion about the  iptables api that used the dot operator to assign values, and trying to keep it close to that. I'll work towards the getter/setter method.  \n. Finally sat down to make some more progress on this. I have a prototype for invocation at the link below\nhttps://gist.github.com/Rich5/e01b94492fec048661e6\nIt's a work in progress, but there's enough there that I thought I'd stop and get some feedback. I've included comments through-out and some items that could be changed/improved upon. Any comments or critiques are welcome. C is not my everyday development language so I'm sure there are some practices that could/should be done differently. \n. I also started thinking about what data and stats I would want to pull as a developer. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the hc_global_data_t data structure holds most of the stats that people would want? If so, then an easy solution could be to have a function that returns a copy of data? That would give a developer access to the stats and maybe help prevent accidental corruption of the variable used to display stats. \n. Ok, should be all updated now with the recent updates included. Same link as above. Let me know if I missed something. I haven't hooked this into the current main function in oclHashcat.c to make sure it works just yet.  So far my tests show that it is generating the command line string correctly. \n. I just looked and I think I'm missing a variable for a second positional (dict) arg for combination attack. I'll update tomorrow.\n. Ok it's been updated again. The three positional args are hash_input, dictmaskdir_p1, dictmaskdir_p2 as shown in the example included in the code. \n. Updated to account for addition of --opencl-device-types option\n. Made some progress on integrating the API with the existing code base. You can review here https://github.com/Rich5/oclHashcat\nMajor edits are:\n- added oclHashcatAPI.c to src/\n- moved defaults from oclHashcat.c to common.h \n- updated make file so now you can just use, make win64API etc.\nStill a work in progress, but coming along. \n. @jsteube I have a design question that I'm struggling with. One of the most useful features of an API is to retrieve information about the program. In this case, it seems like the best data structure to retrieve status is the hc_global_data_t data structure, as I mentioned before. Currently I have a function that returns a pointer to this structure, and it works fine in basic testing. But, I'm assuming that most people will want to run oclHashcat in a background thread or process (e.g. GUI for front end, hashcat background). In that case we could run into a problem with shared memory across threads without mutex, and probably slight performance issues, which of course is unacceptable. \nDo you have any ideas as to a better way to do this without adding multiple lock/unlock calls to the core code base? I hope there is a better design I just haven't thought of yet. \nUPDATE: We might be able to get away with a mutex that locks data as oclhashcat is initializing everything. Then also locks at the beginning of the \"main loop\" (https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/oclHashcat.c#L15620), and then unlocks at each pass to allow other threads to safely read data. It's hard to say without a lot of testing though. \n. @jsteube Are you saying I should fork the process first? Or is calling the main function in a separate thread the instance management you were referring to? \nHere's a basic overview of what I have right now:\n1. Initialize and call main (renamed to hcapi_main) in a separate thread\n2. control returns to wrapper main while oclhashcat is working in the background\n3. call get_data which returns a pointer to the data global variable.\n4. access variables in hc_global_data_t struct to get running status\nFor example,\n```\nint main()\n{\nprintf(\"[*] Starting API Test.\\n\");\n\nOCLHASHCAT_CON hc = oclhashcat_init();\n\n\nhc.options.attack_mode = 0;\nhc.options.hash_mode = 1000;\nhc.options.hash_input = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\auser\\\\Desktop\\\\hashes.txt\";\nhc.options.append_dictmaskdir(&hc.options, \"C:\\\\Users\\\\auser\\\\Desktop\\\\Dicts\\\\dictionary.txt\");\nhc.options.append_rules(&hc.options, \"C:\\\\Users\\\\auser\\\\Desktop\\\\Rules\\\\somerulse.rule\");\nhc.options.append_rules(&hc.options, \"rules\\\\best64.rule\");\n\nhc.options.quiet = 1;\n\nint c;\nchar **v;\n\nhc.generate_commandline(hc.options, &c, &v);\nhc.start_thread(c, v);\nhc_global_data_t *output = malloc(sizeof(hc_global_data_t));\noutput = hc.get_data();\n\nprintf(\"install dir: %s\\n\\n\", output->install_dir);\n\nu64 all_done     = 0;\nu64 all_rejected = 0;\nu64 all_restored = 0;\nchar quit = 'r';\n\nwhile(1)\n{\n\n    for (uint salt_pos = 0; salt_pos < output->salts_cnt; salt_pos++)\n    {\n        all_done     += output->words_progress_done[salt_pos];\n        all_rejected += output->words_progress_rejected[salt_pos];\n        all_restored += output->words_progress_restored[salt_pos];\n\n        printf(\"all_done: %llu\\n\", all_done);\n        printf(\"all_rejected: %llu\\n\", all_rejected);\n        printf(\"all_restored: %llu\\n\\n\", all_restored);\n\n    }\n\n    quit = getchar();\n    if(quit == 'q') break;\n}\n\n\n// Lots of prints for testing.

One last item I would like to include is a data structure that holds all the results (cracked hashes). Something like:\ntypedef struct {\nchar hash;\n char plain;\n}results;\nI'm defaulting the --quiet option to True to suppress most of the output, but the worker threads still print the hashes as they are cracked. \nIs this print to stdout action done at a single location like a central print function (similar to log_final), or is each thread just print to stdout as the results appear? \nI'm looking for a way to suppress that output and also hook the results to copy to an array. I know I could parse the POT file, but it would be nice to keep everything in memory is possible. \n. Ok, I'm done with the first cut at a beta version of the API. If you're interested in having it merged then I can get a pull request together and write up more formal documentation.

There are minimal changes to the core code base, and hashcat builds and functions exactly as it does currently with the API code merged. For example, make win64 works just fine. I tried to make it as unobtrusive as possible. \nThe main changes to the core code is the following:\n- Moved the variables from line https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcat.c#L24 to\n  https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcat.c#L152 to common.h\nI did this because hashcatAPI.c uses these variables to compare user input for changes when building the command line to pass to optparse \n- I've used the API macro for specific changes required for using the API. A couple of examples are here:\n  https://github.com/Rich5/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcat.c#L208\n  https://github.com/Rich5/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcat.c#L2043\n  https://github.com/Rich5/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcat.c#L5346\nOther than that all the main API code base is located in hashcatAPI.c\nhttps://github.com/Rich5/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcatAPI.c\n. Sounds good. I'll let you know if any issues comes up. One question is hashcat_get_log strictly for reporting errors? \n. I realize that I previously posted in the closed PR rather than here. See here for my update https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/382\nAs it turns out I can pass an rpath to the Python extension, but the problem still remains that the lib can't find the OpenCL dependencies.\nIf appears to fails here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L415 because the shared_dir variable resolves to the cwd of /usr/bin (where the Python interpreter is running). It looks like I should be able to pass the install directory to folder_config_init to fix this right? Something like this call:\nfolder_config_init(hashcat_ctx, \"/home/user/hashcat\", \"/home/user/hashcat\")\nbut shared_dir still seems to resolve to /usr/bin rather than '/home/user/hashcat' when I tried this. I'm pretty sure I'm just missing something small here. Any suggestions? \n . @jsteube Ok so you can ignore my previous comments. I tracked the issue down to https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L333\nSince get_install_dir always resolves to resolved_exec_path and resolved_exec_path is resolved using the cwd (exec_path) of the current process here https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L33 I end up with an issue at this line https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L409 because the current process is Python which runs out of /usr/bin by default. \nSo when hashcat tries to find the OpenCL folder it's prepended with /usr/bin and then throws and error here https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L415\nI tested my theory by just copying the OpenCL and hashcat.hctune to /usr/bin and the Python binding work as expected. This is not really a good solution though. You can see the before an after in the image below. \n\nThe easiest solution would to be able to pass in the install and shared directory at compile time just like with native install. \nI also had to cp hashcat.hctune over /usr/bin as well. Similarly, I end up having to run Python as root because libhashcat tries to write to  /usr/bin/hashcat.outfiles at this line https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/ec5610271aae422cfe856bcf4870901baed35641/src/outfile_check.c#L344 \nI'm not sure these are \"issues\" with hashcat, but I wanted to provide feedback.\n. \n I don't have a real good solution at the moment. We basically just need to be able to tell libhashcat where to find 3 items (from my testing so far):\n1. OpenCL directory\n2. hashcat.hctune\n3. Where to output any files (e.g. hashcat.outfiles, hashcat.log) so we're not trying to write to a protected folder like /usr/bin\nAlthough I'm not sure if it's better to set this at compile time or run time as an API call. \nI think if the user can overwrite anywhere it normally prepends the executable path with an install directory it might work. \nMaybe something as simple as:\n```\nifdef SHARED\ninstall_dir = user_defined_install_dir;\nsession_dir = user_defined_session_dir;\nelse\nget_install_dir (install_dir, resolved_exec_path);\nendif\n```\n. I agree that would be the best solution with two comments.\n\n\nI think libhashcat.so should be installed in /usr/local/lib. Python looks for libraries in the standard locations by default, and I'm sure other applications will as well. Otherwise anyone writing bindings would have to specify an rpath. Not a big deal to do, but it's less seamless for developers using libhashcat. \n\n\nIn the case of a shared library get_exec_path will not always return the path where libhashcat is located, but rather the directory of the parent process. For example, Python will return /usr/bin, but libhashcat may be in /usr/local/lib or somewhere else. So as long as we don't rely on that as the anchor point for paths it should work.  \n\n\nOne other issue that ran into, but forgot to mention was a redefine error caused by this line\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/include/common.h#L25\nPython already defined _GNU_SOURCE so compiling the module was giving an error. I'm not sure if this is really a hashcat issue, but I just changed line 25 in common.h to\n```\nifndef _GNU_SOURCE\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n\nendif\n```\nThis could just be an issue with using Python, but I wanted to mention it because other bindings might have similar conflicts. . Awesome! I'll test this out tonight, and let you know if I run into anything else. I think this fixes everything at first glance. . Actually, I'm not sure this fixed it. Unless I'm doing something wrong, but ultimately I'm initializing my module like this:\nself->rc_init = hashcat_session_init(self->hashcat_ctx, \"/usr/local/lib\", \"/usr/local/share/hashcat\", 0, NULL, 0);\nIs that the intended usage?\nWhen I do this the install_dir is eventually set as the resolved_exec_path here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L333 \nSince the resolved_exec_path is taken from the current running process we still get install_dir resolved to /usr/bin(where Python is running out of). \nSo then this check fails: \nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L339\nand profile_dir, shared_dir, and session_dir are all set to install_dir (/usr/bin) here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L363-L365\nThen when we look for the OpenCl folder here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L409\nIt's looking for /usr/bin/OpenClwhich is of course isn't there. I think the root issue is that the get_install_dir function is assuming that libhashcat is being used in the same directory as the program loading it. That's not true in this type of use case. \nSo here's how I got it working. I inserted the following condition starting here: \nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/folder.c#L363\n```\nif (install_folder != NULL)\n    {\n      get_install_dir(install_dir, resolved_install_folder);\n      struct passwd pw;\n      struct passwd *pwp;\n  char buf[HCBUFSIZ_TINY];\n\n  getpwuid_r (getuid (), &pw, buf, HCBUFSIZ_TINY, &pwp);\n\n  const char *home_dir = pwp->pw_dir;\n\n  profile_dir = hcmalloc (HCBUFSIZ_TINY);\n  session_dir = hcmalloc (HCBUFSIZ_TINY);\n\n  get_profile_dir (profile_dir, home_dir);\n  get_session_dir (session_dir, profile_dir);\n\n  shared_dir = hcstrdup (shared_folder);\n\n  hc_mkdir (profile_dir, 0700);\n  hc_mkdir (session_dir, 0700);\n\n\n}\nelse\n{\n   profile_dir = install_dir;\n   session_dir = install_dir;\n   shared_dir  = install_dir;\n}\n\n```\nI didn't have time to do extensive testing, but it's working at the moment. \n\n. Ah, you know I didn't even think to try that last night. Maybe I over complicated this. I'll try again later tonight and see if that works. . I'll be able to verify tonight when I get some spare time. Thanks for your patience. I realize I've been bugging you for over a year on this now. . I just confirmed that this works with the install_dir set to /usr/bin.  No code changes necessarily like you said.  I have some more features to add to the bindings, but the PoC works.\nI think this feature request can be closed. \nThanks!!!. My plan is to have a release candidate ready at the end of next week. . What is the use case for user_options_extra? Is it intended to be part of the API?\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/1f266fb0f2ecfb4e1b94494f8f9b70acd020faf9/include/types.h#L1428\nI notice you're using it in some of the event functions like here:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/1f266fb0f2ecfb4e1b94494f8f9b70acd020faf9/src/main.c#L212\n. \nStill a work in progress, but my code is up in a development branch so others can contribute if they want.\nhttps://github.com/Rich5/pyHashcat/tree/bindings. Agreed. Lots to do. A few people reached outa and wanted to help so this will allow for PRs and issue submissions. This way you can see the progress as it develops too if you want. Added eventing and libhashcat runs in a separate thread now. You can see how it works here\nhttps://github.com/Rich5/pyHashcat/blob/bindings/pyhashcat/test.py\nA little more to do and I'll release it as 2.0rc1. > Does that mean that there's no support for the native and/or osx target?\nI'll add support to the Make file for native install and do a few tests. This should be an easy addition.  \nAs for osx, I don't have access to a mac to do any testing. I don't think there is any reason why it wouldn't work though, but can't verify myself. \n\nI saw you accidentially added the opencl-headers to the repository. Please remove them. We describe in BUILD.me how to install them.\n\nOops. I'll get those removed. \n\nCan you please rename it to hashcat_api.c\n\nNo problem.\n\nCan you please use the format used describe in the contribution section on here? https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat That is like allman-style format etc.\n\nI'll run indent on it to make sure it's formatted correctly. \nShould have most of this done by tonight or tomorrow. \n. Doing some testing. I'll post here when it's ready.\n. Ok. I'm done testing. Checked out good for me on the following systems:\nWin7\nWin8\nDebian 3.16.7-ckt25-2 (2016-04-08) x86_64 GNU/Linux\n. Bah. Ok. The first error might be a result of the example I wrote. hc.status_update() returns 0 because of these checks:\nif (data.devices_status == STATUS_INIT)\n    return 0;\nif (data.devices_status == STATUS_STARTING)\n    return 0;\nif (data.devices_status == STATUS_BYPASS)\n    return 0;\nThe foreground thread seems to get hung because of getchar() I think. I'll have to write a better example. In the mean time if you give the hashcat process a chance to spin up and then try getting the status does it display? \nUPDATE: I also just thought of something. Check these lines starting at 3143 in the example. I bet they aren't pointing to the right example files: \nhttps://github.com/Rich5/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcat_api.c#L3143\nThe second error is a result of the math library not being linked which I don't understand why that's happening. make nativeAPI should compile with this line that links the math library:\n```\nhashcatAPI:       src/hashcat.c src/hashcat_api.c $(NATIVE_OBJS)\n    $(CC) $(CFLAGS_NATIVE)    -DAPI -lm -o $(BINARY_NATIVE) $^ $(LFLAGS_NATIVE) -DCOMPTIME=$(COMPTIME) -DVERSION_TAG=\\\"$(VERSION_TAG)\\\" -DINSTALL_FOLDER=\\\"$(INSTALL_FOLDER)\\\" -DSHARED_FOLDER=\\\"$(SHARED_FOLDER)\\\" -DDOCUMENT_FOLDER=\\\"$(DOCUMENT_FOLDER)\\\"\n```\nI'll have to troubleshoot more on this one because it was working earlier (I'm away from my lab until tomorrow).\nLastly, I agree I think packing into an .so would be ideal. I'm probably going to need some help with that though. I'm not the best Linux dev. If you need to deny this pull that's ok. I'll work on it more in the next few days as I get time.\n. Sounds good. That makes sense. Let me know when you're ready to come back to this after the release.\n. After just briefly reviewing, this looks awesome! I'll be able to dig deeper in the next few days. I think it will be pretty straight forward to adapt the python bindings to this, but I'll know more next week when I get back from travel. Thanks for taking the time to do this.\n. The addition of events is really nice. Is there a way to get all the same status info as pressing \"s\" during a normal run? For example, I've seen people parse out the GPU temp to use as triggers in scripts. Are events intended to be used in this way? I'm my previous PR I was basically taking a snapshot of that type of information and storing for the user in a structure. Is that a feature that should be at this level? Seems like you have a well defined plan here so just let me know if you need me to work on some part or just test by adapting python bindings?\n. Thanks again for taking the time to do this. I'm looking forward to testing it out\n. I'm probably just missing this part, but one more question about accessing the status. It looks like all the information is stored in hashcat_ctx, and I understand that the status_display calculates and displays all the status, but how would that be accessed programmatically through the hashcatlib? Would I access hashcat_ctx directly? Previously, I ended up making a new function that copies the status and updates a structure when called. You can see it here:  https://github.com/Rich5/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/hashcat_api.c#L1897\nhcapi_status_update was basically just a modified version of status_display that calculated and copied values. Is there a better way to do this now?\n. I think developers would at least want to query for the information that is on the status screen. Here's a screenshot of the status info I thought would be useful previously. Maybe not all are necessary though for the first iteration.\n\nIs that helpful?  I can come up with a named list of those items if that's of more use.\n. Wow, thanks @jsteube \nWith this foundation in place I think I'm going to rewrite the python bindings as a native Python extension as opposed to using the ctypes library in Python. Should be pretty straight forward and faster, but I'll let you know as I get into it. My plan is to start this week. I'll post comments here as they come up. \n. @jsteube so I was finally able to make a lot of progress on the Python bindings. If fact, a lot of the work is done for a Python 2.7 extension (the main part of the code is here temporarily if you're interested - https://gist.github.com/Rich5/a97747b91e1066f5d273dc1a6d8fc51b), but the one issue I'm running into is dependencies for libhashcat.so.\nIt looks like, by default, hashcat looks for dependencies relative to it's current working directory. Is there an easy way to specific that is should look somewhere else? For example, we move libhashcat.so to /usr/lib, but it's configured to look for all dependencies in /usr/local/share or something like that?  \nUPDATE: Actually I think I may be able to specify an rpath when I compile the extension. If that works I'll have an branch up on the pyhashcat repo this week.\n. ",
    "halexan": "Wow! oclHashcat API is great function! @Rich5 did a really good jod. I'm looking forward to oclHashcat API being added. Thanks to @Rich5 and @jsteube !\n. Well, I posted that thread...I have the same question too.\nMaybe as roycewilliams said\n\ndictionary attacks cannot take advantage of the parallel nature of the GPU\n\nI think it is because dict attack cannot be calculated parallel in a CPU/GPU. Only after a password being calculated, the next password can be calculated. This leads to a performance drop.\nAnd why rule based attack makes performance better? I think it's because different rules in a rule file can be calculated in parallel...maybe..\nHowever, this condition likely does not happen on hashcat v2.00. I am confused!\nIs there any way to improve performance of dict-mode? I mean calculate different passwords parallel in a CPU/GPU. @jsteube @roycewilliams \n. How about the benchmark of DES-ECB on your own computer? @fransla \nI want to know the performance of GPU's DES-ECB and compare it with FPGA.\n. A german company http://www.sciengines.com/which are doing some cracking with FPGA\nThis is their benchmark http://prntscr.com/bm5net\nMaybe GPU really doesn't good at cracking DES.\nBut I think cracking DES-ECB should be added to hashcat,\n. As we know, DES only uses the MSB 7 bits out of each 8 of the password, so the key length is just 56 bits, the other 8 bits is useless. Hashcat don't need to consider the 8 bits and just set the password \"56 bits hex\" (like \"1A8D938F83920D\").\nUsing char password (like \"S3cr3ts1\") is not good, because different char password may equal to same key (like \"S3cr2ts0\" = \"S3cr3ts1\"), this may cause redundant calculation, so I think it's better to use hex password.\n. Thank you @jsteube ! Hastcat is a really huge software, it has so many functions, it's hard for everyone to master it.\nThis thread (https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-3047.html) does not support reply. Can I ask a question here?\nIf DES-ECB key is in 0x00000000000000-0x00000000000FFF, is the following command right?\nxml\n./hashcat.bin DES-ECB.txt -m 14000 -a 3 ?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b?b -s 0 -l 4096\n.

    "unix-ninja": "Binary distribution should be handled by package management. RPM and DEB will tell the OS where to put the actual files.\nPersonally, I think that the paths for these items should all be constants defined in a header. This way we have two interesting things that can happen:\n- Different paths can be used for different OSes (e.g., Windows vs Linux) without changing the main code\n- Also, if a package maintainer wants to override the paths for their specific distribution, they can make a patch for this one header and the likelihood of further code changes breaking their patch would be much less. This should make the package maintainers' lives easier.\nWe could then also make these paths configurable in the Makefile (this should make the BSD and Solaris folks happy)\n. Another option would be to have hashcat look for a config file on startup. If it finds the config, use the values in there.

That was supposed to be \n__APPLE__\n. @philsmd I made the changes you requested.\nAs for using the abbreviated form or expanding it, I don't feel strongly either way. People likely to care about this mode are probably going to recognize it, but if you really want to expand it that should be a trivial change.. Right now I list it as TOTP (HMAC-SHA1) to address the specific OTP algorithm. Do you think that covers it?. ok, I will add that and push in a little while.. @jsteube I changed the category in usage.c to \"One-Time Password\", which is what I thought Royce was talking about, to solve the find-ability issue. I didn't touch the name of the algorithm, though. This should actually be the proper way to address it, do you agree?\nI guess you have a point there. I will switch timestamp to u64.\nTOKEN_ATTR_VERIFY_HEX was boilerplate straight from m150. For this algorithm we prob want TOKEN_ATTR_VERIFY_DIGIT since this should be a timestamp. I will swap that.\nThe code in check_hash() was mostly off-loading base32 encoding of the founds to CPU. I didn't want to slow down the kernel with this. The result needs to display encoded, even though the keyspace we are searching is not.. @philsmd so, I struggled with that point myself. By the RFC, the secrets must be base32 encoded (this is the way you will input it to something like pyotp.) It seems weird to do that extra work inside the Hashcat kernel though, which would just needlessly slow down performance when you can just encode it at the end. So this way is faster, but I agree that it's confusing unless you know what's going on. I am writing a blog post to explain this attack, which I hope helps. In the end, I thought having that extra performance was probably worth it.. @jsteube ok, I have more commits coming in soon for some of these things. There are two things I wanted to discuss, though.\n\ndigest[1] = otp_code;\n\nSo, I used index 1 because the SHA1 boilerplate ignores index 0 when actually comparing hashes, and if I want to reuse that boilerplate without writing new code I need to start the values I care about at 1. I don't think it's worth reinventing the wheel for this since the algorithm is based on HMAC-SHA1. I'd like to keep using as much of that existing infrastructure as possible.\n\nplain_ptr = (u8 ) strdup ((const char ) temp_ptr);\n\nThere is no memory leak for this one. The buffer is locally scoped and destroyed at the end of the if block. You can't even use the reference outside of that block because it will cause a compiler error. I don't think there's any real value trying to manually manage the memory here.. @philsmd omg- thanks! that's definitely a time-saver!\nI will get these taken care of in a little while and push a new commit. This help is much appreciated.\n\ud83d\ude42. @philsmd I see. Apparently I misunderstood what strdup() was doing under the hood. In that case, I will amend as jens recommended. Thanks for the clarification!. @jsteube changed as requested. the smaller digest size made a small performance bump to my benches. It's not a whole like, just 50k-100k or so, that's still cool. thanks!. agh! I can't believe I missed that. sorry. Will fix it this morning.. wow- I am not sure how the tab got in there, because I have tab expansion set in vim, but it's fixed now. pushing soon.. I used an explicit cast for this. I think that should be good.. ",

I added a $75 bounty for this and the AES decrypt routine should be executed on whatever is fastest between AES-NI (CPU) or GPU.\nThere's also a demo page for the library here: https://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/. \n. Ok.\nIs there any possibility to use already implemented kernel as preprocessing commands? to implement custom algo without copy paste existing code?\n. I did this because on the code side, it's easier for one to see this has something to do with the status output, and that it is transforming it into machine readable code.\n. Do you have the intel/gt450m setup?  I am running at late 2013 MBP with kali rolling and do not see this issue.  Assuming you have the same hardware, the only difference is that I'm on 4.0.0 where you are on 4.6.0.\n. Which nvidia driver are you using on Kali?\n.

Fact is, this isn't meant to be viewed online anyway, but grep'd, cat'd, less'd, more'd, (insert viewing method here).. One of the issues faced here is that initiating an attack can take a lot of time.\nUnless  you disable potfile it can take minutes to start a single attack. Not to mention hashes have to be loaded in every time as well as the wordlists.\nAll together running 1000-500000 commands, each taking a LONG time to complete is terrible.\nNot to mention keyspace and load. As a single command might not fully utilize the GPU's you'll end up with a huge decrease in speed for every, single, command.\nHaving it integrated into hashcat greatly reduces this and allows anyone to easily run a rule list against it.. \n15786_1494403569.hccapx.tar.gz\n. dictionary\nfechasdenacimiento.tar.gz\n. same bug in v4.1.1\naries@aries:/opt/hashcat-master$ '/opt/crack-keys/diccionarios/otros/fechasdenacimiento' | '/opt/hashcat-master/hashcat' -a 0 -m 2500 '/opt/crack-keys/handshake/15786_1494403569.hccapx' \nhashcat (v4.1.1) starting...\n\nDevice #1: This hardware has outdated CUDA compute capability (3.5).\n             For modern OpenCL performance, upgrade to hardware that supports\n             CUDA compute capability version 5.0 (Maxwell) or higher.\nDevice #1: WARNING!

    "sibero80": "@neheb , could you share any insights on the process? would love to compile it for ARM64 (LG G5). ",
    "d2-d2": "Thanks philsmd, so let me explain that a bit.\nSo this hash is used by PunBB forum, right? And as far as I can tell version 1.3.x version of that CMS is using following functions to produce hashes:\n$salt = random_key(12);\n$form_password_hash = forum_hash($form_password, $salt);\nThese two functions are as follow:\n```\nfunction random_key($len, $readable = false, $hash = false)\n{\n        $key = '';\n    $return = ($hook = get_hook('fn_random_key_start')) ? eval($hook) : null;\n    if ($return != null)\n            return $return;\n\n    if ($hash)\n            $key = substr(sha1(uniqid(rand(), true)), 0, $len);\n    else if ($readable)\n    {\n            $chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';\n\n            for ($i = 0; $i < $len; ++$i)\n                    $key .= substr($chars, (mt_rand() % strlen($chars)), 1);\n    }\n    else\n            for ($i = 0; $i < $len; ++$i)\n                    $key .= chr(mt_rand(33, 126));\n\n    ($hook = get_hook('fn_random_key_end')) ? eval($hook) : null;\n\n    return $key;\n\n}\n```\nand\n```\nfunction forum_hash($str, $salt)\n{\n        $return = ($hook = get_hook('fn_forum_hash_start')) ? eval($hook) : null;\n        if ($return != null)\n                return $return;\n    return sha1($salt.sha1($str));\n\n}\n```\nSo I think that's it for PunBB. Fixed salt length (12 characters) and sha1 function. But to be honest, if you could make two additional switches, one for PunBB and second one for any salt length that'd be great.\nDo you think these options are possible?\n. @philsmd that's the thing, instead of chaining different commands in hashcat I'd like to use one consistent that will allow me to write cracked passwords and shorten the left list easily. Then, having multibyte delimiter in output file, I can prepare whatever outputs I like without loosing any characters etc.\n. > I think the multi-byte delimiter could still be a good idea in some very special cases (i.e. if the hash list already has some weird delimiters and the user doesn't want or isn't able to batch modify each line within the file)\nExactly. Such delimiter would clearly tell you about number of fields and therefore ease further scripting.\n. @jsteube what if separator is also in salt?. OK thanks.. Before running hashcat, set your umask to: umask 027.\n. @jsteube I think it's the best and simplest solution. Hashcat (or user) will set umask prior running anything, thanks to that every file will be properly secured. Otherwise, if you decide to do it in per-file manner, there is a chance that one or another file will not be covered and another 'issue' will be raised.\n. Nevermind, it was a local issue (parent directory was created with wrong permissions). Sorry for that ;-). Hi again. I'm sorry to report this again but it turned out that this issue is still present. Some more info:\n- problem tested on windows7 64bit and windows10 64bit (different boxes)\n- whenever hashcat is starting, every file it touches (like potfile, stats, log outfile of cracked hashes) it is assigning +r flag to it\n- issue tested by another user (thanks Chick3nman) and confirmed\nSteps to reproduce:\n- download latest /beta, like https://hashcat.net/beta/hashcat-3.30%2b84.7z\n- uncompress with 7z x ..\n- run example.cmd and see what's happening on console. Last commit fixed this issue. Thanks!. Hi philsmd, actually I don't have any names of webapps that are using this scheme. To be honest, there are other variations of substr() function but the one listed here is most commonly used. I base that statement on what I've seen on forums so far (insidepro and hashkiller to say the least) and lists are very large (hundreds thousands of hashes). There is also very well known list of hashes mentioned by KoreLogic (https://www.korelogic.com/InfoSecSouthwest2012_Ripe_Hashes.html). There are many substr() in there too.. Thanks @DoZ10 it works :-) There are some trailing '0' visible in output but that's fine, I can delete them easily.\n46aef2f12cde0f185843a837a307669700000000:cvugvuhvbuh. @jsteube \n\nPlease do a suggestion on the character to use\n\nSince 's' is taken, how about 'a' (for alter)?. Hey, it looks as the same issue I reported and you linked to it, however, I tested latest official release and following two new versions from /beta/ on my Win10 x64 box.\nhashcat-3.40+38.7z                                 11-Mar-2017 08:17             2680799\nhashcat-3.40+43.7z                                 12-Mar-2017 10:19             2674053\nEverytime I tested I used 7z x archive.7z to extract files and then executed example0.cmd script to see what's going on. In my case, everything worked without issues.\nEDIT: I also checked permissions of docs and charsets folders before and after executing example0.cmd - I see read-only permissions.

Thanks bro ;)\n. Thanks for the test :)\n. Most warning reports from GPU code will be resolved soon.\n. In my previous patch i removed this option for builds without HAVE_HWMON,\nwith that i re-enable (test.sh use this option by default).\n. You can find the ifdef here for example\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/blob/master/src/oclHashcat.c#L5634\n. For now OSX don't use hwmon but in near future can so i don't understand what's your goal.\nMy is find a way to support all options, also for OSX :)\n. For now hwmon for OSX is disabled,\nalso a lot of algo for now are disabled on OSX due to uncommited change to kernel code.\nDo you want remove all code related because today is not ready/supported ?\n. The \"unknown parameter\" is the key, also because OSX support is under development and will be released if finally work else not.\nFor me is the same, tell me if re-enable --gpu-temp-disable globally or push another mod in test.sh\n\n@philsmd, i don't see any break \n. @philsmd when I add HAVE_HWMON i to for osx, not for fix the issue.\nI think you don't see what do in the code, before this PR 156 --gpu-temp-disable for OSX is disabled,\ni write in the comment \"Re-enable\" for that. If the initial commit for oclHashcat.c is correct why you write a lot of comment about that?\n\"The correct fix would check for the --gpu-temp-disable switch in the --help output for each platform (linux/windows/osx)\"\nThe correct fix is the fix I do before \"Keep disable --gpu-temp-disable on osx in oclHashcat.c\", the same that you want :)\n. Now I remove the last patch, tell me what is wrong now\n. I re-check the patch, if you see in master --gpu-temp-disable is not present if HAVE_HWMON is not defined. With that patch we can restore the parameter.\nOSX hwmon support is also under development ;)\n.

Details on algorithm or some more hands to code it?\n. @magnumripper \nWell kirbi2john relies on tickets created by one of the tools part of mimikatz suite, which requires to extract TGT from LSASS memory. So this parser is only for Windows oriented RC4 encrypted TGS whereas it is possible to have some using Linux (eg. using Samba).\nThat said, I think we shouldn't rely on a particular output format from one specific script but get a a common format, as you mentionned.\nTo answer your other question, size of encrypted data can vary (but I guess we can easily fix an upper bound as encrypted-fields should contains strings like domain name, SPN, etc. which are not supposed to be that long...).\n. > RC4_HMAC_NT is much used in UNIX world too ;)\nI was actually talking about kirbi2john parser, not the type of algorithm used :)\n\nDES_CBC_MD5 (3) -- the only one supported by all, but deprecated\n\nThis one is disabled by default, but if for an odd reason it was re-enabled, this could be an option yes (also, are you sure this one is still supported on Windows Server 2012?)\n. Well, they are automaticaly generated, either on workstation and DC, as AES ones, that is by design iirc. But using them or not is defined by DC, so I guess you got reject while try to authenticate even if you declare supporting only this algorithm.\nAnyway, that's not the subject. Concerning AES, we could try to implement this ones too, but I don't know if this worths as this would be extremely slow and hard to implement using SIMD...\n. > The best way to support this and other algorithms is to supply more samples! Ideally several per algorithm and from different networks and always with a known password of course.\nI'll provide you some :)\n\nVectorized RC4 is also impossible to implement. But it's not a problem since it's so fast anyway and you can do parts of an algo vectorized and parts of it with scalar code.\n\nYes of course.\nConcerning the feasability of actually cracking \"real-cases\" ciphers, fyi targeted ciphers are from accounts where a Service Principal Name (SPN) is given. These accounts are normally services accounts ie. random passwords... But when using an application requiring this type of account, sometimes Administrators provide user account, so a maybe non-random password... That's what interests us.\nI'll generate some user accounts like that for you, trying to make ciphered parts as long as possible :)\n. > Oh, and I've got another question (as long I only got the one sample a.zip attached above): I found the known plaintext 20............Z starting at cleartext107. The latter is a fixed position but given only one sample I'm not 100% sure this one is? If it isn't, it probably will be faster not bothering with the known-plain optimization.\nI'll try to generate some samples to check that, but I don't think there are some fixed position, even on pre-authentication case (I am not sure, I'll take a look).\n. Yes, 23 is the constant that specifies that RC4_HMAC_NT is used. This could indeed be the tag we are searching for, to identify the format (as DES_CBC_MD5 would be 3).\nFyi, \"AP-Req\" is the name of the process which consists in relaying a TGS ticket to the server which hosts the service we want to authenticate to. This TGS ticket is the result of the \"TGS-Rep\" obtained after doing a \"TGS-Req\" to the KDC.\nThat's why there is a bit of confusion AP-Req/TGS-Rep but they are the same tickets :) \n. @magnumripper \nActually, I think I found a way to get rid of the max size of edata, so as to the last hmac_md5 operation and get a known plain attack\n. My pleasure :). I actually needed this one too!\n. Yup it will be, when I have time ;). Actually this is not a trivial problem and both cygwin and msys2 have the problem when one wants to use hashcat through an ssh session (they both rely on mintty which does not adresses the problem).\nAfter many things tried (bash on Windows, OpenSSH on Windows by Microsoft Powershell team, etc.), I found a good solution:\nhttps://github.com/rprichard/winpty\nThis binary adresses the actual problems among others (unbuffered problematics and tty communications).\nAll you have to do is compile it on your cygwin\u00a7msys2 plateform and launch problematics binaries through this PE as follows:\nwinpty ./hashcat64.exe -m ...\nPrerequisites if you are using cygwin:\n- mingw64-i686-gcc-g++ or mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++\n- gcc-g++\n- make\nPrerequisites if you are using msys2:\n- msys/gcc\n- mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-gcc or mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc\n- make\nThen:\n./configure && make && make install\n. I tried and my screen freezes. I tried supplying just a single hash of known plain to see if it actually worked but it doesn't\n. > Does it crash on MD4 already or what format is causing the hang? My HD4000 works just fine until an Abort trap: 6 in SHA-3(Keccak) (and that may just as well be an Apple driver bug).\nIt does crash on MD4\nI'll test supplying --benchmark-mode=0 and decreasing gpu accel as soon as I can\n. @Zyntax3rror , what are your custom parameters in benchmark mode? (-u and -n) Because it keeps freezing even on -u 2 -n 2.

Yes, it is (look at first post :-p )\nTGS-REP == AP-REQ concerning ciphered part and as it is name krb5tgs in john, I named it that way\n. Yes!\n. Indeed it is a bit hard to read, the first line is to check if any of first 16bytes contains headers. This was to avoid to compute next 16bytes and increase performances.\nBut we have the case that \"header 1\" goes with \"footer 2\" and would say \"good boy\" whereas it should not, so we have to add the last check to avoir false positives :)\n.

So in case of SHA1, it would be : sha1(sha1(password).sha1(salt)) with sha1(salt) as \"new\" salt?\n. I can't reproduce the output of the first hash:\nhashlib.new(\"sha1\", hashlib.new(\"sha1\", \"1\").digest()+\"824acdc9c2276bc1b7b9a9ec22684e6ac4b55eda\".decode(\"hex\")).hexdigest()\n'5218723a13afe0b988ec1c3dc2bb7699e2f7d2d2'\n. Oh that's odd, it's based on hexdigest. Thanks, I'll try to take a look\n. Seems good to me\n. We should try it yes, good idea. The problem is that I no longer have direct access to a HD4400 Graphics integrated GPU (which we experienced bugs). I'll try to get one to do some more tests\n. I'll ping back again my ex-coworker who has the problematic CPU. Where does this format is used? \nAnw, it is easy to implement this kind of format and there are plenty of new algorithms examples. You can pick one and implement it :)\n. @philsmd told me about that. Actually I knew there were some problems (not all them looking at the commits though) but I did not have time to fix stuff :/\nI'll take a closer look for the next algorithm, sorry about that\nGreat work! \n. Hi,\nI'll try to take a look this week-end. Could you give me some more information please: \n- is it using CPU, GPU or both\n- what is your driver version\n- have you tried with a password with another length/character class\nThank you\n. Actually I've experienced the same problems (password not cracked) using the exact same embeded GPU (issue #287 )\nI'll try to look this week-end but I don't know if I can find something about if it is really optimization related :/\n. I could do that when I find time... (also the KRB 5 TGS one). I'll implement this one soon :+1: . Windows username can contain anything but these characters:\n\" / \\ [ ] : ; | = , + * ? < >\nEven if # is very unlikely to be found, the implementation allows it (though I never saw this). I'll implement this one soon :+1: . Hi!\nI don't think that is related to hardware, 300k would be the maxium for you, right? I'll try to fix that ASAP. Hi there, I have quickly read what you did and nice job @philsmd! \nI've implemented the stuff in both jtr and hashcat for DPAPI and there is also a DPAPImk2john in the run/ in order to extract stuff related to it.\nUnfortunately I really don't have time to take a deeper look at it and implement stuff :/, but feel free to email me if you have any question about DPAPI internal mechanisms (also look at #1238), I'll answer it asap.\nCheers!. Hi @hycday,\nWindows offers a way to \"migrate\" between profiles that use DPAPI. Unfortunately at some point you will always have to rely on the masterkeys (usually in C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Protect\\\\, )  so if you've erased/overwritten it it will be quite complicated not to say impossible...\nAnw take a look at this blogpost from @HarmJ0y if you want to have a better understanding.. It is 6bytes not 5 but same problem. Mmmh you're right, it was 8bytes in my mind, don't know why haha. I'll implement the final stuff then, thanks for notifying it! :+1: \n. ",

From what I understand, the GPU kernel with a fixed key length can be optimised thus making it faster, since it's not wasting clock cycles dynamically shifting things around...\n. Bigfella,\nEven though the effective search length between separate searches is 40 bits, the kernel would have to be written as such to accommodate the entire Key+IV as just a raw key, as this is how the cipher is really configured.\nWith one of the first known RC4 security issues being a weak key-schedule, many protocols that use RC4 as a base algorithm work around this weakness by taking a 40-bit \"key\" and concatenating this with a separate IV, (for example 64-bits in the case of the NICTA P25 paper) to give a 104-bit effective key length.\nOf course, writing many different kernels for obscure modes like this was never the intent of Hashcat, but it would be great to know and demonstrate, as when this was originally researched in 2010, we tested the RC4 on a large Nvidia Tesla cluster, and it was severely limited by the early architecture's lack of shared RAM.\nIf this could be taken into consideration, that would be greatly appreciated. The recent work in adding DES-ECB has been of great benefit as a base algo, and RC4 would be the cherry on top :)\nCheers,\nMatt\n. Yes, once the plaintext/ciphertext pair is extracted (easy to do) they can then be fed into oclHashcat. FPGA implementations are hard to come by, require experience with FPGAs, expensive software tools to be able to create the bitstreams on the larger devices ($5000 for one vendor), and can be time consuming to create an image and troubleshoot it.\nBy comparison, oclHashcat on GPU is fast, off the shelf and if you collaborate with a few friends with GPUs they can 'lend' you their spare cycles and it would be feasible to split the keyspace up into slices for a zero-cost solution using the GPUs that people already own...\n. Hi Guys,\nIs there any chance someone might be able to implement this one? \nCheers,\nMatt\n. Also, since it would be great to run many instances of this across several different PCs (I have access to a few at work with beefy GPUs) why not add a key start range..\nFor example, one PC can start at key 0x00001000000000, the next could be told to start searching at say 0x000F0000000000 and so on...\nSince password to DES input key is application specific, it really doesn't relate to DES-ECB at all, so as halexan commented, it would be best to just work with the raw DES keys in 56-bit hex format.\nThanks so much for this addition, it is really great to see this implemented!!!\n. @jsteube - my apologies, I should have looked harder. Thanks for the info!!\nCheers,\nMatt.\n. Awesome work jsteube!! Can you give an indication of how fast the bitsliced DES-ECB kernel runs on your machine?\nThanks again!\n. Hi guys, from talking to a few users, yes this is broken. Forts117 and bigfella237 - perhaps it would be useful if you ran Hashcat against some standard DES test vectors and some known keys to demonstrate that this is the case please?\n. After reviewing this thread, I believe all the troubles were due to the order of the PT and CT. Hashcat requires the 64 bit input and output blocks in the format Ciphertext:Plaintext, where as Fort's failed examples above are in the order of PT:CT.\nIn any case this mode has been confirmed working by many people at this stage so I'm sure this one can be closed off.\n. Hi Jens, \nYes - I understand that DES keys are only 56 bits in length, because the DES input register is only 56 bits wide.\nI don't understand what the charset is for however. DES itself doesn't do any bit shifting - it just simply takes a 56 bit input from a 64 bit key with odd parity applied. So every eighth bit (the parity bit) is simply ignored by the DES algorithm..\nI can see that 0xFF left shifted once gives 0xFE - this makes sense, but I don't see anywhere in the DES standards that the key is left shifted at all.\nRegards,\nMatt\n. Well this is slightly embarrassing - \"git pull\" and \"make clean\" fixed it. Looks like I compiled a broken build by leaving that out.\nOn another note - I tested the \"Time Estimated\" bug and its now working as expected! Thanks for the fix guys!\n. An example of the old style is:-\nv4.2.1-53-g77daf05d+\n. current hashcat -V \nv5.0.0. OK my mistake - the Makefile is still set to production = 1.\nClosing issue.\n. Cheers Jens!. ",
    "eintw1ck": "I'd like to look into this, how would I go about adding a module?\n. You could always have a few kernels, one 'dynamic' one, and then a few more-optimised ones for common combinations.\n. @anthraxx I spoke with a friend who uses linux, they are having the same issue. I think it's because hashcat isnt in the $(prefix)/bin folder which it was compiled with, and defaults to the binary dir, this if statement is to blame afaict.\nTry manually setting the PREFIX maybe?\n. This probably needs to be added to the README, or there needs to be a design change so that it doesn't fail like this. It was something I'd like to ask the hashcat guys: wouldn't it be better to check the relative resource directories (I.e. ../share) from the bin directory, and then if they don't exist check the current directory before describing an error if neither directories are writable so that a user can either fix permissions or change the prefix? It wouldn't create much overhead, and would reduce a lot of confusion IMO.\n. I was more thinking about /usr/local. Although in your case it didn't use ~/.hashcat even though it should have fallen back onto it. This was my main point really, implement a fallback (or fix the non-working one). Mind you, I haven't had too much time to look at the code though\n. ",
    "bigfella237": "+1 for me (and the other 160+ watchers), this would get a lot of use here!\nRC4 being a stream cipher utilizes variable key lengths with masking, as suggested in the original ticket, but the authors also suggested discarding the first portion of the generated keystream to avoid an inherent weakness. \nThis is what's known as \"DropN\" and is widely implemented in RC4 applications, so the Hashcat version would also need the user to specify the length of the keystream to be generated and the number of bytes to drop from the beginning before the XOR with the plaintext.\nIn summary, we would input:\n-     start key (with mask)\n-     key range (number of keys to search)\n-     keystream length*\n-     DropN length\n-     the \"target\" keystream portion (to compare with the keystream generated by each pass)\n*Alternately the keystream length could easily be calculated automatic by adding the DropN value entered to the Target length.\nThe Target keystream is derived from a known plaintext XOR the ciphertext. Once our Target matches the generated keystream we've found the key!\nPlease, someone, make my day and implement this in Hashcat?\n. My applications require either a 72-bit or 104-bit key length, the last 32 or 64 bits (respectively) of which are known but still must be included in the key, so a \"fixed\" 40 bit key length would be of no use.\nLikewise with DropN, I need to drop either the first 256 or 267 bits (depending on the application) of keystream to align the ciphertext with the correct portion of the stream that was originally used for the XOR.\nThe beauty of stream ciphers is that they are very flexible, allowing for varying key and output lengths, unlike a block cipher, which has fixed key and IV lengths. With so many different applications of RC4 it seems a pity to restrict Hashcat with a fixed key length.\nIs there any advantage to having a fixed key length?\n. @ joshdekock That is a great idea!\nOur project is revisiting some of the work done in the NICTA paper on \"Insecurity in Public-Safety Communications: APCO Project 25\" (found here: www.nicta.com.au/pub?doc=5076 ) but also extending the scope to include some communications platforms that weren't covered in the original research.\nWe have three separate platforms that utilize the RC4 algorithm, all have a 40-bit keyspace but also have a known \"Message Indicator\" concatenated to the key to pseudo-randomize the output. The length of this message indicator varies from one platform to the next.\nLikewise with the DropN value, obviously we need to XOR a known plaintext with a ciphertext to get a \"target\" keystream to test against, but we also need to align the result with the exact portion of the RC4 keystream used on the original XOR. All of these platforms drop the first 256 bytes of keystream, but one has an extra 11 bytes of data sent before our known plaintext that we need to ignore.\nSo in summary, we would need three variants to cover all three platforms, being:\n- 72-bit key with a DropN of 256 bytes;\n- 104-bit key with a DropN of 256 bytes;\n- 104-bit key with a DropN of 267 bytes.\nAs stated, all would still only have a 40-bit keyspace to search, but we do need to append the known message indicator as it forms part of the key.\n. Sorry if this is a \"newb\" question (and sorry for my impatience) but is there a way to tell if anyone is working on support for this?\nAs above, Hashcat already has some RC4 modules in place for other searches and, although I'm no programmer, it shouldn't be too much work to adapt something to suit our needs?\n. @philsmd any chance you could take a look at implementing these RC4 modules for us (in your spare time of course)?\nI'm guessing there's at least four or five different different \"modes\" involved depending on whether you can make the key length and/or DropN lengths variable:\n\n40-bit key with no DropN;\n40-bit key with a DropN of 256 bytes;\n72-bit key with a DropN of 256 bytes;\n104-bit key with a DropN of 256 bytes;\n104-bit key with a DropN of 267 bytes.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!. We would just need to add a key mask as we only want to search the first 40 bits (the balance of the key is known), so something like:\nhashcat64.exe -m [mode] input.txt -o output.txt --outfile-format 5 -a 3 -1 charset --hex.charset ?1?1?1?1?1knownportion\nThe above assumes we have a different [mode] for the different variable and DropN lengths, otherwise, as you suggest, those values would also need to be specified in the command line.. Bumping this request for RC4 known-plaintext attack, it's coming up on 2 years old!\nIf anyone has the time this would still be very useful to us and shouldn't take long as RC4 is already used in other modes. I wish I knew how to add this myself but I just don't have the skills.\nAnyone?. Just checking-in to wish this request a happy birthday... three years old today!\nI would still get a lot of use out of these RC4 known-plaintext attacks, and I'm sure that what would take a CPU several weeks could be done in minutes with Hashcat. \nIf anyone has some spare time to look at this I would be eternally grateful, pretty please (with sugar on top)?. Even if this 3DES work-around works as above for a known key, that does not help when searching for an unknown key since we have nothing with which to populate the first two variables?\n. @fransla can you confirm that -m 14000 does not find the test key with the verified CT:PT?\nIs this a bug in the DES code and if so, how do we report it?\n. Could you tell us please, what is the correct key variable expected from this search?\ncd674507b21e5ebe:1435662222276461\n. Note that those key variables @Forts117 listed above all have odd-parity bytes, however there are some even-parity bytes in the default \"DES_full.charset\" file so the key you find may not be that exact variable, but the seven Most Significant Bits of each byte should still be the same.\nRemember that if you disregard parity that means there are 256 copies of every DES key (2^64 divided by 2^56), so we must only deal with odd-parity bytes.\n. I saw this myself when I first looked at it, the charset file supplied contains a mixture of odd & even parity bytes, but I just re-wrote my own odd-parity charset file.\n. ",

Only attempt to crack one of the duplicates, ignoring the others but keeping them in memory or accumulating a count of them in some way (otherwise, there would be a massive waste of RAM and processing power), and ...\n2 After a hash is cracked, write all duplicate plains to the potfile, so that statistics could be derived directly from the potfile?\nI think this is probably not what @jsteube https://github.com/jsteube  et al will want to do. Removing duplicates keeps the code simple, keeps GPU RAM usage low, etc.\nAlso, it is trivial to script taking an original hash frequency count and a potfile and generate the statistics.

Ok, further testing with both beta and git versions shows this only is the case with md5 hashes, I tested SHA-1 and NTLM and it detected and pruned entries from the potfile at run time.I also noticed that with md5 it displays the wrong amount of total hashes  as well as the cracked hashes (if including entries from the potfile) in the recovered field of console output.

For some\nreason however my clinfo shows the devices reversed, so the GPU first,\nthen the CPU. I don't think this is the reason of the problem but\nindicates that there's some OpenCL installation difference between our\nversions.

Maybe that was for different products?. This would be fairly easy to add.\nDo you know what software is using this scheme?\nIs there a min/max length of the salt?\n. That looks like hashes from OpenCart and is supported since hashcat v3.10\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/docs/changes.txt#L334. I was the one who added this to hashcat that's why I've noticed the scheme and especially the password length restriction.\nBtw. OpenCart uses PHP's mb_strlen() for the length check. This means that a multibyte UTF-8 encoded character counts only as one.\nThat's the reason I didn't enforce any length checks in hashcat for this hashmode.\nSince this has been resolved, please close this issue..

Try coredumpctl debug. This will start gdb with the last coredump.\nIf you don't have systemd then I don't know where core file could be. However you could try this:\ngdb --args ./hashcat --opencl-platforms=2 -b and in the gdb prompt enter run. The crash happens inside Intel's OpenCL library. There's probably not much hashcat can do about this.\nIt works on my Ubuntu 16.04 machine with the same driver version though my CPU is a i7-6700K.\nI don't have a Xeon E5-2623. You could try with Ubuntu 16.04.. I only found the bug today and can't test it with older drivers.\nI added some debug printf's here: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/OpenCL/m03000_a1-pure.cl#L800 (is there a better way?)\nprintf(\"w0[0]: %08x\\n\", w0[0]);\n    printf(\"w0[1]: %08x\\n\", w0[1]);\nNow running the self-test results in this:\nw0[0]: 68736168\nw0[1]: 00746163\nWhich is \"hashcat\"\n$ echo -n 68736168 | xxd -r -p | rev\nhash\n$ echo -n  746163 | xxd -r -p | rev\ncat\nSo it looks like the self-test plaintext is not converted to uppercase and therefore calculates the wrong hash.\nI hope this helps in resolving this bug..

    "rhertzog": "Yes, I'm speaking specifically of ADL SDK, the one that can be downloaded here: http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/graphics-development/display-library-adl-sdk/ and that forces you to accept http://developer.amd.com/amd-license-agreement/ where it says that \u201c9.  Additional Licenses.  DISTRIBUTION OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE WITH AN OPERATING SYSTEM MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LICENSES FROM THE OPERATING SYSTEM VENDOR.\" and also that you don't have the right to electronically transfer the software except for purposes allowed by the license (which amounts to backup purpose only as far I can see).\nA debian source package can \"build-depend\" on other packages to make anything needed available at build time. Thus if the ADL SDK is needed, it needs to be packaged, but this is not possible due to its license. :-| (And obviously I want a proper package that builds native binaries from source)\nFTR, I don't know much about usage of all those GPU SDK, but I\u00a0discovered that Debian has OpenCL and Installable Client Driver (ICD) for AMD/Nvidia and more:\nhttps://packages.debian.org/sid/amd-opencl-icd\nhttps://packages.debian.org/sid/nividia-opencl-icd\nAnd I was thus hoping that it would be possible to build oclHashcat relying only on OpenCL only and thus hide the hardware-specific code behind OpenCL. That's possibly what you explained in point 2... if yes, then it's great. But then why is ADL SDK still needed? Is it because OpenCL does not provide enough features to manage the hardware (you say \"avoid burning their hardware\") ?\n. I will give a try at bundling only the ADL SDK headers in my source package. That said if @magnumripper is correct that this falls under \"fair use\", then you might want to consider doing this direcly. Provide the header in your git repository (and release) so that users do not have to download the ADL SDK at all.\nThat said it would still be nice if oclHashcat was buildable without those headers since they are effectively a non-free dependency which will prevent the inclusion of oclHashcat in Debian main. But if we can build without it, it could be included and it would still provide value to users of non-AMD GPU... if we get to that point, maybe the hardware management layer that requires the non-free parts can then be externalized to a plugin that can be separately built (and provided in Debian contrib or non-free).\n. @magnumripper I built it successfully embedding only the header files (3\u00a0for ADL, 1 for Nvidia).\n@jsteube I understand but when you build a package for a distribution, you want it usable for all users, whatever their hardware. And you still want to keep the package in main if possible (instead of non-free). So the code that requires the non-free header files ought to be compilable separately from the main code (in a non-free package), building a plugin that the main code can dlopen() to handle hardware management. Or something similar.\n. @jsteube For the short term: include the 4\u00a0header files for ADL/NV directly in your git repository and update the bulid machinery to find them here (instead of /opt/something).\nIn the long term, enhance the project so that the parts requiring those headers can be compiled separately as a plugin that can then be loaded by oclhashcat. That way oclhashcat can be in Debian main, and non-free can have the plugin which need those files to be built.\n. @jsteube It's up to you to make that call. It's certainly nice to have achieved this but given that hardware monitoring is an important feature it would be even better if it could be enabled on a plain oclhashcat binary compiled without it just by intsalling a plugin that the main binary would then pick up automatically. And we should be able to build that plugin in a standalone way.\n. @magnumripper In general, I would agree with you and I would not object to this. But my suggestion is specifically to address the requirements of Debian. In Debian main, all files from the source package must be under a DFSG-compatible free license and the header files required for building hardware monitoring code for AMD/NV would thus be stripped from the source package. And it would thus not be possible to compile that feature in oclhaschat. Even if the user installs the required libs afterwards, it would not work. In that scenario, we should provide a second copy of oclhashcat in non-free that would replace/divert the one provided in main...\nTo avoid that duplication I was thus suggesting that the hardware monitoring code could be compiled separately and be used at run-time by the oclhashcat binary provided in the main package.\n.

No, I wanted to show the precise location of the library. Actually the version in Kali (and Debian Testing) is version 375.39-1 but it's in the same location which is in the usual library search path. This was just a bad copy-paste because I picked the output that referred to an older version of Debian.. I know of this but using epoch is just ugly... epoch makes sense when you switch from a date-based versioning scheme back to a traditional version number. But otherwise it's really just up to upstream to bump the version numbers appropriately. We are not short on numbers and going with 4.x to reset the versioning scheme is certainly fine.. History is history, I don't want to rewrite it but I'll wait @jsteube answer here for now before deciding to put an epoch. The epoch is completely non-revertable once used and changes the version number displayed in quite a few places. Instead of 3.6.0, users will see 1:3.6.0 and will wonder what this mean.. Blah, it's not my fault if you meant 3.4.0 and you used 3.40. 40 is a number and the error is not in the system... I understand 4.0.0 would be a violation of the semantic versioning but going backwards is also a violation of the semantic versioning. In that case you could just continue with 3.61.0, 3.62.0, 3.63.0... (I suggest this and not 3.41.0, 3.42.0, 3.43.0 because I used 3.50 in Kali and 3.60 in Debian to work around the lower version number).. ",

    "01BTC10": "It is well explained here: http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3059/what-is-a-compressed-bitcoin-key\nBasicly Bitcoin Core before 0.6 was using uncompressed pubkey format. They switched to compressed format and Hashcat doesn't understand the uncompressed format. The script bitcoin2john.py doesn't do any conversion and JackTheRipper support both format. When I got this issue I say many people complaining about the same problem. I looked carefully at the hash format and found the problem.\nUncompressed format start with 04 and has a length of 65 bytes. Compressed format start with 03 or 02  and is 33 bytes.\n```\n$ ku 04c77ed36b8f0affb1b434ef6975b2fa224131f42ab47df30b7c6b6dffe47cc10c4d92b0bbb8205521bd7b020db080b355acb75cf9ec04ebef0d2c3889f7369679\ninput                        : 04c77ed36b8f0affb1b434ef6975b2fa224131f42ab47df30b7c6b6dffe47cc10c\\\n                                 4d92b0bbb8205521bd7b020db080b355acb75cf9ec04ebef0d2c3889f7369679\nnetwork                      : Bitcoin mainnet\nnetcode                      : BTC\npublic pair x                : 90234338766489736260560541387516194814900220115552850975862447215427335274764\npublic pair y                : 35087268780626980418258611515549367557368934105453932834202777821135781664377\n x as hex                    : c77ed36b8f0affb1b434ef6975b2fa224131f42ab47df30b7c6b6dffe47cc10c\n y as hex                    : 4d92b0bbb8205521bd7b020db080b355acb75cf9ec04ebef0d2c3889f7369679\ny parity                     : odd\nkey pair as sec              : 03c77ed36b8f0affb1b434ef6975b2fa224131f42ab47df30b7c6b6dffe47cc10c\n uncompressed                : 04c77ed36b8f0affb1b434ef6975b2fa224131f42ab47df30b7c6b6dffe47cc10c\\\n                                 4d92b0bbb8205521bd7b020db080b355acb75cf9ec04ebef0d2c3889f7369679\nhash160                      : a3759ac93719b9a3ce91d57413af6f7fbc96a215\n uncompressed                : e53d032e405ce162fa75d054c453419051f053da\nBitcoin address              : 1FuJ2ajAGSTeeXkdS1gbv6oZUxYtcEBwao\nBitcoin address uncompressed : 1Mu6q9WdP3Jd7QHhkfkU4Qijhm6g2H1AiV\n```\nSo if you take this output fom bitcoin2john.py:\n$bitcoin$96$856e263a5c91fa5df09049153f9b3b889b3b5be0185b2ca95a352832e83dc519c63074a0bbc42615bae8b352149431f3$16$9dd95fb690bb7d5e$125989$96$0135a17e315d528da597892e4510d51971a4bb8b2da21f577620a294b8baabb88a0fe5aa4cb672ccdad575a9b9064fb1$130$04c77ed36b8f0affb1b434ef6975b2fa224131f42ab47df30b7c6b6dffe47cc10c4d92b0bbb8205521bd7b020db080b355acb75cf9ec04ebef0d2c3889f7369679\nIt won't work with Hashcat but it can be converted to the compressed format to make it work.\n$bitcoin$96$856e263a5c91fa5df09049153f9b3b889b3b5be0185b2ca95a352832e83dc519c63074a0bbc42615bae8b352149431f3$16$9dd95fb690bb7d5e$125989$96$0135a17e315d528da597892e4510d51971a4bb8b2da21f577620a294b8baabb88a0fe5aa4cb672ccdad575a9b9064fb1$66$03c77ed36b8f0affb1b434ef6975b2fa224131f42ab47df30b7c6b6dffe47cc10c\nBoth hash are equivalent in the Bitcoin network.\n.

    "jfoug": "For SRP, if you have a DB breach, you will obtain these items  (I, s and v)\n```\nx = H(s, p)               (s is chosen randomly)\nv = g^x %N                (computes password verifier)\nThe host then keeps {I, s, v} in its password database.  N and g publicly known for the site.\n```\nAll versions of SRP work about the same (other than they may compute x a bit differently).\nSo you see that you get v, but have no idea what x is. However you have been given H() and s and can try to 'guess' p, then plug that through through H() like   x' = H(s,p').  v'=g^x'  Then if v' matches the v from the db breach, you know that 'p is the unknown p\nNow like you mention, exp-mod.  You will find there is a HUGE reason why they have chosen that as the core of SRP. expmod is almost the definition of a serial function. You can not speed it up (much, there are some tweaks), since it is so serial iterative, and each step REQUIRES the prior step to be complete. This is due to carry logic (along with other issues).\nNow, that is not to say that there is not ability to do some parallelization.  You could compute m x' value (simply hashing here, hashcat is great on that), and then feed all of those different computed x' values into independent running expmod generators running on GPU.  Each of them will complete their part of the task in relatively close proximity of time, since most will have about the same number of set bits and clear bits in their x' values.\nSo yes, there 'is' possibility to gain on this problem with GPU coding, since g and N are fixed values.  But I do not know of any GPU coding that does parallel expmod work like this.  There may well be, but I am not aware.\nWhen I added the few known examples of SRP to john, I did so only in CPU code.  Almost the entire cost of execution is within the expmod calls.  The H() function plays almost no part (until somones implementation defines H() as pbkdf2, or scrypt, which they easily could do).\n. This is not rules 'loading'.  It is the config (.conf file) loading.  They are 2 totally separate items.  The config file loading loads the whole john.conf, and in jumbos case, anything that is .included.   It is this logic where the interpretation of the leading [ and . characters is the problem.\nI may be able to make that change, but it will be very hackish at best.\nThe advantage is for the users.  It allows usage of already made rulesets between more tools.  There is little or no downside to having some of the rules files have a few no-op commands added to them.\n. This was made to work without too much difficulty modifying the config.c file that parses a line, so the changes requested here, are not required to have john able to use these rulez files.\n. That was my own tool's output (it is not in the rule file).\nIn the rule file there are these 2 lines\n^1 ^0\n^1^0\nThey do exactly the same thing and this is 100% identical rule.\nSome of the other instances are not as apparent.\nss5 sa@ se3 si1 so0\nss5 sa@ se3 so0 si1\nss5 sa@ si1 se3 so0\nss5 sa@ si1 so0 se3\nss5 sa@ so0 se3 si1\nss5 sa@ so0 si1 se3\nss5 se3 sa@ si1 so0\nss5 se3 sa@ so0 si1\nss5 se3 si1 sa@ so0\nss5 se3 si1 so0 sa@\nss5 se3 so0 sa@ si1\nss5 se3 so0 si1 sa@\nss5 si1 sa@ se3 so0\nss5 si1 sa@ so0 se3\nss5 si1 se3 sa@ so0\nss5 si1 se3 so0 sa@\nss5 si1 so0 sa@ se3\nss5 si1 so0 se3 sa@\nss5 so0 sa@ se3 si1\nss5 so0 sa@ si1 se3\nss5 so0 se3 sa@ si1\nss5 so0 se3 si1 sa@\nss5 so0 si1 sa@ se3\nss5 so0 si1 se3 sa@\nAll of those lines are in the file, and there is only 1 rule.  The rest are duplicates.\nThere are literally 1000's of such lines (possibly 10's of 1000's).  They are absolutely wasted cycles when used.\n. One thing that would clean up a lot of them, is to first run the rules through a space removal code, to a temp file (preserving line order). Then do an in-place file unique (not a sort | uniq). Then using the original space trimmed file, and the in-place unique file, you can write a script to determine which lines from the original file need to be removed, and remove them (I assume people would want to keep the easier to read .rule file with the spaces separating each rule primative).\nOnce that clean(er) file is made, then the search for the harder to find dupes could be done (such as the leet dupliates).   There are many others which can be found without much problem. Those are:\n- order of mixing [ and ]\n- order of mixing ^ and $ in same rule\n- order of multiple s ops in same rule\n- etc\nIt will be about impossible to find all duplicates, especially in rule sets randomly generated.  But a large number of them can be found.  Some duplicates are very hard to spot, since they use different operations to do the same thing, OR have some operations which are no-op, thus hiding them.  Simple examples such as\n```\n$ ]xA3\nxA3\n$<$k]\n$<\n```\nThese are harder to find, but can be done.    The  ones that are almost impossible to fine, without running data through the rules engine are the ones using different operations to do the same thing.\nI do not have any ready examples from the rules file, but made up examples would be things such as:\n]]\n}[}[\n}}[[\n. $ wc ../dive.rule dive_dedupe.rule\n 123289  262282  973248 ../dive.rule\n 112552  244212  897871 dive_dedupe.rule\n 235841  506494 1871119 total\nThis was just pure easy to find duplicates, which simply were rules where there are spaces between rules difference.  This was an 'in-place' removal. Only the 2nd (or more) duplicate was removed.\nThis change in of itself, gives about a 10% overall throughput improvement, if using that ruleset.  There are still duplicates in there, btw. This is just the most easy write scripts to auto find and remove them.\n. Created PR #304 with the changes (only changes to dive.rule, and ONLY the pure white space identical rules).\nBut there are over 10k of them\n. Right now, the only thing 'automated' is the finding of extraneous white space.  No, I have not run that against other rule files, but easily could.  I image that most of the rule files which are accumulations of 'random' generated rules will have duplicates in them\nOne other thing about dive (and likely others), is that the xNM command likely should be changed to the ONM  I do not know if all of them should, but by looking at some of them, it is obvious that the logic for the current xNM was not right for the rule to find much.  Things like\nx42\n'8 x42\nare almost certainly supposed to be the logic for\nO42\n'8 O42\n. I found about 30 or so like this.  I have redone, just not pushed the changes.  For the 2nd test, I actually pull entire 'proper' rules based upon length, and any left over white space is removed. the first run (that is checked in right now), was simply cat x | sed 's/ //g' so yes, what happened above failed to be viewed as distinct, and does need to be reverted back.\n. This shows the changes, and yes, ,there are rules in dive.rule that need put back, since the spaces removed WERE part of valid commands (mostly $ or ^ rules)\nhttps://github.com/jfoug/oclHashcat/commit/7cb4ab0314444420826f9e262aba72d7d2634902\nI could do a PR now with what is there, but I was going to look for other dupes. I know there are a lot more in dive.rule, I just do not know how easily they can be 'auto' removed. I certainly do not want to do hand edits for 100's or 1000's of different lines.  That would take forever.\nSome I have ways to find, I just need to make changes so that I can auto remove them. Those are:\npure 's' commands (order).\ncycles in s commands   like sa4si1sa@  (made up).  The sa@ is no-op\nwhere things like $ and ]  or ^ and [ totally offset each other (i.e. become no-ops).\norder of blocks of [ and ] rules  i.e.   []  vs ][  or [[[] vs ][]], etc\nI have code to point out the above dupes, but nothing to auto-remove (yet).  I bet there are many more 'types' of duplicate rules, but i have not looked much deeper.\nIf you want me to, I could push for just the dive.rule line additions to get it corrected, and then wait on the rest until I have more done.\n. PR #307 adds back 30+ rules into dive.rule which were over aggressively removed with a brain dead sed space removal command. I used an intelligent space removal to do it the 2nd time which was based upon length of rule commands to remove spaces. The patch uploaded was the few items which were erroneously removed the first time. There are some other duplicate removals in that first patch, most (all?) were actually identical lines, not even space duplicates.\nThen the 2nd commit is a bunch of harder to find dupes.  In the commit, is a list of the exact lines removed from the dive.rule file.  I also listed the canonization rules I used.  I did things like sort blocks of 's' commands. Sort blocks of ^ and $ commands. sort blocks of [ and ] commands.  Remove pairs of $x] and ^x[ commands, etc. The comment in the commit lists them all.   I believe a lot of that duplication comes either from random generation of rules run at different times, OR possibly in someone making rulesets (in the case of s order) and not fully grasping what makes a covering set, or using some script to generate them, and having a busted permutation generator.\nI am sure I will think of other dupe things over time (  { and } pairs are a no-op, etc).  But some of the other dupes (there still are many), are much harder to find.  Some of them are not 100% duplicate either, just duplicates for words of certain length (  such as '5 and p2'5 and d'5 )\n. are some of the dupes there due to these issues?  That can be handled by changing the code to remove the duplicate which does not work on oclHashcat instead of simply removing the '2nd seen' duplicate.\n. Can you point me to documentation on which rules are not oclHashcat supported?\n. One thing I could do, is to simply provide the script files. There is nothing I am hiding in there.\nI do think that no matter what, we need to have separate commits for each type of duplication found.\nThese are:\n- pure duplication (i.e. exact same line appearing later in the rule file).\n- extraneous space duplication  (this is the worst offender with dive.rule)\n- other duplication rules 1 at a time\nThis way, it is much easier to validate that everything being removed fits the rule properly, and that ALL are really duplicates.\n. yes.  But I will do this step by step, since things are MUCH easier to see if only one type item is done.\nBy far the WORST offender, is the errant space duplicate problem in dive.rule  That one alone is huge.  The others do exist, but are not nearly as bad.  But some of those are much more complex to see that they are right\n. It is full of good rules, but is at least 15% slower (due to duplicates), than it should be.\n. #308 contains 2 commits.\nThe first is 100% 'pure' duplicate lines (i.e. lines that are already 100% the same as some prior line).\nThe 2nd is duplicates found by removal of superfluous white space (space characters).  This was done by first tokenizing the rules themselves into proper commands of the right length, then removing all extra white space.  This logic replaces the faulty  cat xxx.rule | sed 's/ //g' > xxx_missing_ws.rule logic which removed about 40 rules which were not duplicates.\nWithin comments in the PR, are all scripting code used to find these duplicates, and auto remove them from the rule files.\n. I will make no further PR about dupes, until these have been fully accepted.  I do not foresee any problem here, since these really are 100% 'pure' duplicate rules.\nOnce everything is happy here, I will start removing other duplicates, but only 1 'rule type' at a time, so that it is easier to validate only correct duplicate rule lines are removed.\n. I am going to work on it.  But I want to do it a step at a time, so we can more easily validate that the changes ARE valid.  There have been some missteps and finding them is not always easy when there are multiple types of duplication that is much more complex than what the diff program can find ;)\n. The next thing I am looking for is s 'reductions'.  This can remove some duplicates, but will also change some rules.\nThe 'reductions' are like this:\nsabsbc becomes sbc\nsabsac becomes sab\nThis will cause some duplicates, and also causes some rules to be reduced in number of operations.  This is required to be done before I start to reorder the order of the s commands. That reorder finds many duplicates.  but if these type no-ops, and cycles are there, then the reorder is not valid.\n. Unfortunately these are having to be dealt with by hand. I do not have an 'auto' fixer tool for these. I can find them however.  These are the rules in dive.rule that I have found:\nR0se5s5&  turned into R0se&\ns.hx13sh<  turned into s.<x13\nslOsOZ  turned into slZ\nsk@s@{oB8  turned into sk{oB8\n+8sPMsMW  turned into +8sPW\nsYfsfut  turned into sYut\nsTDo5OsT*  turned into sTDo5O\nso!$=s!=  turned into so=$=\nso!s!=$=  turned into so=$=\noA[s2dsdX  turned into oA[s2X\ns9Cs9W  turned into s9C\nsDJ*7AsD@  turned into sDJ*7A\ns7ys7)  turned into s7y\nsDk*20sDF  turned into sDk*20\ns^6s6I  turned into s^I\nsiNsNk  turned into sik\nsOusOG  turned into sOu\nsfusue  turned into sfe\nsZEsEd  turned into sZd\nsXcs^Us^`  turned into sXcs^U\ny2s|asaR  turned into y2s|R\nsVusV*o1{  turned into sVuo1{\nsyMsyP  turned into syM\nsaGsGE  turned into saE\n. Yes I do, but I sent you the big change off list.  I wanted to hear from you first, since this was a set of MUCH HARDER to spot duplication.  Some are trivial to see, some not so much.  I just thought you might want to run some testing yourself, before we accept this PR,\nBut I can get a PR done, no problem.\nBtw, that PR will be the last for dive (unless we go through and look for and remove no-op commands from some rules to speed them up).  Once that PR is done, there are NO more duplicates in dive.  The method of running data will flush out all of them.\n. I see your point, you are 100% correct.\nZERO\nsZEsEd == ddRO\nsZd        == dERO\nThat certainly is different.  That 'chain' optimization was one I 'saw' by hand, and then coded for it.  We certainly can undo them. There were some, but not a huge amount.  They should have all been in one of the earlier commits, so they should be easy to undo, and I certainly can get them back in.\nYou are not seeing these in the current dup set?  I would think not...  With the data provided I would find it hard to see anything like that not being seen as different.\n. One thing I 'should' have done, is with the last set of duplicates, to search the block that were all the same, and chosen the first one of the shortest number of operations.  It would have removed more of the 'non-optimal' rules.    A lot of them  early on were optimal  (some just 1 command).  But I am pretty sure that some of them were not the best of the group.   The program I wrote simply took the first rule of the group (i.e. earliest line number which that 'type' was found).\nIf you have not merged yet, I 'could' redo the commit, and change the logic to pick the rule with fewest commands.\n. I see you have not merged that yet, so if you want me to, I can certainly change the PR to behave that way.  It would make better, slightly quicker rules.\n. I fully agree there.. if something in hand written, unless it is wrong (like unforeseen duplicates), then it pretty much should stay intact.\nOn this last PR, why don't you reject it, and I will put some more time in on it. I will do the 'least' commands change, and will also spend some time looking for things that are not duplicates.  I did find some.\n```\nduplicate rules:\n(115)\n(53541)  'V\n(100438)  'Z\n(105211)  'W\nThese are not duplicates, but passed my random input data due to line lengths.  I thought I had long enough stuff, but I guess not.\nduplicate rules: (non-optimal)\n(185)  }[$e\n(186)  }$e[\n(410)  ]$e\nduplicate rules: (non-optimal)\n(225)  }o05\n(95882)  ]^5\nduplicate rules: (non-optimal)\n(226)  }o04\n(90399)  ^4]\n(95884)  ]^4\n```\nThe min-command logic would have caught the 2nd block.   But the optimal speed for block 3 and 4 is probably the last item, since ] and ^ are probably much faster than the } operator.\n. I will get the non-duplicate s-chain rules back in where they were removed. That will be quicker.   Then the de-dupe of dive.rule I will work on a bit.I am traveling for the next few days, so I may have down time to do this, and I may not, hard to say.\n. Which of these would you rather see in the rules:\n$6$6$6\n $6Z2\n$6$6$6$6\n $6Z3\nIn the 2nd set, I can really see using $6Z3  2 commands vs 4.  But in the other one, I am not sure how much time savings there is, vs ease of reading the rule by non-techies, OR does that matter at all ?\nI actually like the john rule of Az'666' or Az|6666| but that is not the question ;)  It gets much easier for pre-pending:    A0'123' vs ^3^2^1  but at this time, this is not in HC, due to lack of handling the z (or l, n, m) length values, or the A command.\nBut there are quite a few of these app/pre-pend the same character multiple times.  It may be best to use z or Z for any that are more than 2 same characters.  The pick least commands duplicate should catch a large percentage of these, since I bet many of them have been duplicated.\n. > all about easy to read :)\nSeriously ?  I thought it was about the fastest way to crack ;)\nBut I can certainly do $6$6$6....$6 if you want it that way, and leave these readable but non-optimal.\nNOTE, some of the reduction of command operations WILL make rules that are more obscure and harder to read, for sure. Many times they become 'better', but sometimes they are fewer commands, but more obscure  (like the $6Z3 vs $6$6$6$6)   And I know that some commands may be much slower 'in code' than others.   ] has to be pretty damn fast vs other commands that may be a bit slower.  I would also thing that $ and ^ would be faster than using i but that may not be the case.\nAre there any rules which are NOT supported by the GPU that I should NOT be using for some of these ruleset, or be on the lookout for in the rulesets?  I have looked in the wiki and other places, and i can not seem to find much about what is NOT in the GPU, other than 256 command limit (which is HUGE, btw).\n. #323 adds those rules that were NOT duplicates in all cases back in. Note, I did not remove the stripped down rules (just in case they also randomly crack something, lol).\nI will spend some time on the dive duplicates found submission. It may end up being more than 1 PR, I do not know.  It is huge, and NOT a simple 'rule' I found, but 100's if not 1000's of little things that can cause duplication    (like [ or D0 or O01 or {] or ^#[[ etc).  These can be trickier to make sure they are dupes (like I mention above, I HAVE found some that are not).  Also, getting an auto-written script/program to figure out which of a set of duplicates should be kept AS THE rule, is also not easy.  So instead of jamming something in, I will spend a bit of time, and try to get it right, or if still too hard, to break it up into more manageable sizes. But even if we say 1000 rule changes is 'manageable', that means 10 PR's and I think that in itself is a bit much.\n. I am glad we put off the prior work. There were problems with the script. I added much validity checking, making sure that everything matches perfectly. First off, there were 6 comment lines in the file I was not accounting for.  But I have to 'start' the adding of offsets at 7. Then about a third of the way through removing data, the matching line is only offset of 6. Somewhere there must be a rule line that is confusing my dupe finder, but for the life of me, I can not find it.  But now that I have the checking logic, that one line really should not matter.  (it is one line turning into 2 somehow, but I do not know which one, or why).\nIts amazing what can be done when your flight in arrives at 8:55 pm, and the layover departure is at 7:00 am ;)  Find all sorts of things to try to make the time pass.....\n. Ive been working on this the a bit over the weekend.  I think its now pretty solid and safe.  I do have it picking the smallest rule.  It chooses the lowest command count, and if 2 commands are same count, it chooses the shorter (character wise) of the 2.  The exception is for things like:  $x$x$x..$x  or ^x^x^x,..  Those are kept intact since you wanted them that way, instead of picking the shorter $xZ3 or whatever it is.  BUT using shorter length of same number of commands gets you things like ^a^b^c instead of i0ai0bi0c type ones, and i find the ^ to be easier to remember.\nI have dug down to a couple thousand lines, and all spot checks are 100% duplicate. There are no more 'hidden' non duplicates that I have seen at all.  There are certainly a lot of duplicates which would have been about 100% impossible to spot, without software to simply run the rules against wordlists made to try to flush out the duplication.  Rules that do not look ANYTHING close to being the same, but when you dig down and look, they certainly are.  There are many that simply have no op stuff in them, such as i0x$a[  That simply is $a due to everything else just being busy work, doing nothing towards the end result. Theres quite a bit of that.\nBut now, when this all gets done, there will be a little over 98k rules in dive.  I think that's about 25% down from where it started.  Still the same ruleset.  A good one.  It will just work that much faster now.  Also, I think it will work better, with the 25k x commands now being O commands, which is the 'proper' logic that originally cracked 'something' to get added to the ruleset.  You might put a notify out that people may actually want to re-run that ruleset if they  have used it since the logic change of x converting into O, or at least to grep the O rules out and run them again.\nI will certainly finish up dive this week, and will probably post it as a single PR, and send you offlist the list of work done, and completed rule set so that you can look at it offline.  I did re-run the entire ruleset before and after against a 6000 word generated list through john, capturing all output words, then uniquing them and sorting. There were about 100 words not generated after the processing sorting and uniquing, there were about 100 lines not in the new data, but they all had somewhat the same pattern, and all had the same binary garbage in them, and I think it is an issue within john's rule proccessing for some encoding aware case changing. I am not re-running, since it's about 4 hours or processing, and I have to have the laptop plugged in, since it chews up the battery when under that load.  I 'know' the rule files are equivalent (certainly for HC), it is just some nuanced issues in john that HC does not deal with (broken unicode letters in the random garbage I generated to find the duplicates).  Magnum did a lot of the encoding stuff, and there are times I would like to re-do some of it to better handle arbitrary binary data.  The encoding logic too easily screws up malformed input data, where I think we should simply leave it as original.    But 99.99% of the time, it does not matter at all.\nWell, once I get dive done, I will run my dupe finding code on some of the other rule sets, to see how clean they are.  The 2 generated might have some, as might d3ad.  The PWP likely has some in it.  Their other rule file seems very clean (hand done).  It usually is the random generated stuff that is bad about the duplicates, because just like writing code, there are 1000's of ways to say foo-bar, lol.\n. > >    There are many that simply have no op stuff in them, such as i0x$a[ ...\n\nI found the example interessting. Are you going to remove the useless work here?\n\nA lot (most?) of this was removed with the last update.  However, if a rule was unique in it's logic, but it still had no-op work in it (offsetting crap, or conditions that can never happen), then it would have  been left in.  However, the method I used in the script to choose the rule to keep out of the block of duplicate rules, would pretty much assure that all no-work commands were removed (most of the time).  The 'keep' rules were:\n1. if 2 rules had differing number of commands, then keep the rule with the fewer commands.\n2. exception to rule 1 was $x$x$x...   or ^y^y^y...  Those were kept over shorter count rules such as $xZ3\n3. if 2 rules had same number of commands, but different lengths (errant spaces removed for length checks), then the shorter length rule was kept.  This would keep things such as ^3^2^1 over i01i12i23\nSo because of the above 'keeper' rules, most rules that had offsetting or no-op work were scrubbed.  So things like i0x$a[ would always get scrubbed, since there was a duplicate $a in the data set.   However, if there was i0x$x[i3z$m and there was not a $x$mi3z rule, then the rule that had that extra no-op pair of commands would not have been removed. \nAre there any left?  I would say there almost certainly are.  However, there likely are few of them, being that if it was randomly generated and DID crack something (to get added to the ruleset at some point), then it is highly likely that a more canonical representation of the rule would also be generated and find something and also added to the ruleset at sometime later. This is how almost all of this duplication grew over time.  A good 'random' rule like sa4se3so0 was created and cracked a bunch. It gets added.  Later, so0sa4se3 gets random generated, and it also cracks a bunch, so it also gets added.  However, together, only 1 of those rules will crack something.  The other never will.\nSo to sum up your original question, no I have not specifically written code to look for these 'never can happen' commands (like usa4) or the offsetting work commands (like ^0[ ) .  But a large percentage HAVE been found and removed as a side effect of the duplication removal project.\n. Here is an interesting block of duplicate rules found in d3ad0ne ;)\nduplicate rules:\n(5687)  *63*63\n(8215)\n(14308)  ^>O01\n(14681)  ^QD0\n(21265)  kk\n(26422)  rr\n(29907)  tt\n(34360)  z3O13\n(34733)  z5O15\n(35307)  }{\nLots of cycles spinning on those, lol.\nAn interesting experiment would be to figure out how many 'make work' rules could be made that end up doing no work at all.   However, I think that there are infinite ways to use the rules engine to give no end change to word, so I do not think that 'experiment' would get very far.\n. It may not be bad to start to 'make' some canonical rules for some of these things.\nThings like all work on front of word should be first then all work on rear of word.\nSo  ^1$1  would be canonical, but $1^1 would not.\nOr, it may be better to claim that commands should be in ASCII sorted order, whenever there are commands which can switch around. (I like that definition better).\nThen things like:\nsa&se3so0  would be in canonical order, but se3so0sa& would not    l$1 would not be canonical, but $1l would   This would not be hard to do within a program.  A rule could be re-arranged, and then checked to make SURE it is still a duplicate.\nOther things:   all O01 should be D0  I0x should be ^x, etc.  Actually, all Ox1 should be replaced with Dx  Also, DxDyDz if xyz are contiguous, should be replaced with Ox3 (or Oy3, etc, whatever is compatible).   There are more of these type multiple ways but one way is better command blocks.\nI am not sure that the ROI is really worth it in this case.  Once we have reduced a rule set to all non-unique rules, then if they are i a canonical format or not may not matter all that much.  Now, if the rule set is being built (especially with random rules), then that would be a different story.  But I do not think there are any ongoing random rule accumulation projects.  If there are, then it might be smart to address them in some canonical manner, as that will help keep some of the duplication out of the mix.  Also, within your rand generation code, it may be possible to build a canonical 'filter' so that when new random rules are generated, at least they are 'standardized' in some manner.\n. I just got back in.  WONDERFUL cycle trip.  11k miles (17k+ km) over 15 days. \nI will pick up on this shortly, after I get my bearings again.\n. All the changes to this point have simply removed duplicates, so there is no harm. It simply speeds up running.  Yes, there are more duplicates AND there are rules that could be reduced  (such as the things like lc, or ^!{ type stuff)\nI do plan on getting back to looking for more duplication, especially now that I have a way to runtime test find the duplicates, but I am still playing catch up with 'real' work, and the long open road still is calling me, so a lot of my time right now is not being spent on OS coding.  But I do plan on picking it up at some point, and again, making the rules 'faster' by trimming off the duplication.\nHowever, your question about 3.0, yes the rules as they are now are 100% identical results, but just faster, and can be put into the release safely.\n. I used something like this, BUT I had to make a special wordlist that fully exercised all rules enough to get rid of many of the false positives.  There are a few rules that are identical to each other, EXCEPT for certain situations (like ending in the letters ck, or starting with a p, or 2nd letter a, or length > 12, etc, etc).\nHowever, finding duplicates automatically, then you can sit down and use your brain to see if something is or IS NOT a duplicate, and the ones not duplicate, make sure they are not removed.  Jens found several early on that my script was labeling as duplicates, and with improvements to the wordlist I was able to run check duplicates and was not seeing any false positives any more. \nI simply have been busy doing non OS coding stuff and have not picked this project back up.  However, a very large part of the duplication has already been flushed out.  But there certainly still is 'some' left in certain rule set files.\nMy tool is a add on (never checked in) used in the rules engine of JtR.  This rule worked by running each rule against my hand generated rule set, appending each output word (and a newline), into a buffer.  I then compute SHA1 on that buffer and simply kept that buffer.  Then on to the next rule. When checksums matched, those 2 rules were flagged as duplicate, and then output.  The scripts I had even took the original rule file, and spit out a rule file minimized.  Within that minimized rule file, it tried to output the line with the fewest rule commands and then if there were multiple rules that had the same number of commands, then the rule with the minimal length string was output.  I did put a couple of 'exceptions' to that logic, where Jens would rather have [[[[^a instead of O04^a even though it was 5 commands vs 2\n. That code is not checked in.  Just specialty stuff I did specifically to find these dupes.  It would not fit well into OS jtr code tree.\n. here is the 'rulez' code.  NOTE, there is lots of other scripts and things that glue this all together.\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/src/Makefile.in b/src/Makefile.in\nindex 6475436..96e9497 100644\n--- a/src/Makefile.in\n+++ b/src/Makefile.in\n@@ -117,7 +117,7 @@ JOHN_OBJS = \\\n    undrop.o \\\n    regex.o pp.o \\\n    c3_fmt.o \\\n-   unique.o putty2john.o gpg2john.o memdbg.o\n+   unique.o rulez.o putty2john.o gpg2john.o memdbg.o\nOCL_OBJS = common-opencl.o opencl_autotune.o bt.o bt_hash_type_64.o bt_hash_type_128.o bt_hash_type_192.o bt_twister.o\n@@ -133,7 +133,7 @@ GENMKVPWD_OBJS = \\\n    genmkvpwd.o mkvlib.o memory.o miscnl.o path.o memdbg.o\nPROJ = ../run/john@EXE_EXT@ ../run/unshadow@EXE_EXT@ ../run/unafs@EXE_EXT@ ../run/unique@EXE_EXT@ ../run/undrop@EXE_EXT@ \\\n-   ../run/rar2john@EXE_EXT@ ../run/zip2john@EXE_EXT@ \\\n+   ../run/rar2john@EXE_EXT@ ../run/zip2john@EXE_EXT@ ../run/rulez@EXE_EXT@  \\\n    ../run/genmkvpwd@EXE_EXT@ ../run/mkvcalcproba@EXE_EXT@ ../run/calc_stat@EXE_EXT@ \\\n    ../run/tgtsnarf@EXE_EXT@ ../run/racf2john@EXE_EXT@ ../run/hccap2john@EXE_EXT@ \\\n    ../run/raw2dyna@EXE_EXT@ ../run/keepass2john@EXE_EXT@ \\\n@@ -494,6 +494,8 @@ rpp.o:  rpp.c arch.h params.h config.h rpp.h common.h memory.h memdbg.h os.h os-a\nrules.o:   rules.c arch.h misc.h jumbo.h stdint.h autoconfig.h params.h common.h memory.h formats.h loader.h list.h logger.h rpp.h config.h rules.h options.h getopt.h john.h os.h os-autoconf.h unicode.h encoding_data.h memdbg.h\n+rulez.o:   rulez.c arch.h misc.h params.h memory.h jumbo.h rpp.h rules.h memdbg.h\n+\n sboxes.o:  sboxes.c nonstd.c\nsboxes-s.o:    sboxes-s.c\n@@ -681,6 +683,10 @@ kernels: @KERNEL_OBJS@\n    $(RM) ../run/unique\n    $(LN) john ../run/unique\n+../run/rulez: ../run/john\n+   $(RM) ../run/rulez\n+   $(LN) john ../run/rulez\n+\n #####################################################################\n # These targets MUST match ALL of the john targets that use ln -s\n # These are built for Win32, so that we have a 'native' symlink back\n@@ -749,6 +755,10 @@ kernels: @KERNEL_OBJS@\n    $(CC) symlink.c -o ../run/unique.exe\n    $(STRIP) ../run/unique.exe\n+../run/rulez.exe: symlink.c\n+   $(CC) symlink.c -o ../run/rulez.exe\n+   $(STRIP) ../run/rulez.exe\n+\n ########################################################\n # Not linked to symlink for a .exe file, so simply make\n # single targets, using the EXE_EXT macro\ndiff --git a/src/common.c b/src/common.c\nindex 5e00969..a912990 100644\n--- a/src/john.c\n+++ b/src/john.c\n@@ -169,6 +169,7 @@ extern struct fmt_main fmt_cuda_rawsha256;\n extern int unshadow(int argc, char argv);\n extern int unafs(int argc, char argv);\n extern int unique(int argc, char argv);\n+extern int rulez(int argc, char argv);\n extern int undrop(int argc, char **argv);\nextern int base64conv(int argc, char argv);\n@@ -1899,6 +1900,11 @@ int main(int argc, char argv)\n        return undrop(argc, argv);\n    }\n\nif (!strcmp(name, \"rulez\")) {\nCPU_detect_or_fallback(argv, 0);\nreturn rulez(argc, argv);\n}\n+\n    if (!strcmp(name, \"unique\")) {\n        CPU_detect_or_fallback(argv, 0);\n        return unique(argc, argv);\n```\n\nthis is rulez.c  (NOTE, this is NOT quality code, just a hack I was doing for this project)\n``` C\n/\n * This file is part of John the Ripper password cracker,\n * Copyright (c) 2016 Jim Fougeron\n \n * Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n * modification, are permitted.\n \n * There's ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, express or implied.\n \n * stand alone rules tool for JtR.\n \n\n */\nif AC_BUILT\ninclude \"autoconfig.h\"\nelse\ndefine _POSIX_SOURCE / for fdopen(3) /\nendif\ninclude \ninclude \ninclude \ninclude \ninclude \"arch.h\"\ninclude \"misc.h\"\ninclude \"params.h\"\ninclude \"memory.h\"\ninclude \"jumbo.h\"\ninclude \"path.h\"\ninclude \"config.h\"\ninclude \"options.h\"\ninclude \"unicode.h\"\ninclude \"rpp.h\"\ninclude \"rules.h\"\ninclude \"md5.h\"\nifdef _MSC_VER\ninclude \"missing_getopt.h\"\nelse\ninclude \nendif\ninclude \"memdbg.h\"\nstatic struct list_main *inp_list;\ntypedef struct word_item {\n    char **candi;\n    char expected[128];\n    int num, hits;\n} word_item;\nvoid add_line(char line, int max_candi) {\n    char word, pos, c;\n    word_item item;\n    char user[128], pass, cp;\n    struct list_entry *link;\npass = strchr(line, ':');\nif (!pass)\n    return;\n*pass++ = 0;\nstrncpy(user, line, 128);\ncp = strstr(pass, \":$2a$\");\nif (!cp)\n    return;\n*cp = 0;\n\nitem = mem_alloc(sizeof(word_item));\nitem->num = item->hits = 0;\nitem->candi = mem_calloc(sizeof(char*), max_candi);\n\nstrcpy(item->expected, pass);\nitem->candi[0] = strdup(user);\n++item->num;\n\npos = user;\nwhile (item->num < max_candi) {\n    int j, bWanted=1;\n    word = pos;\n    while (*word && CP_isSeparator[ARCH_INDEX(*word)])\n        word++;\n    if (!*word)\n        break;\n\n    pos = word;\n    while (!CP_isSeparator[ARCH_INDEX(*pos)])\n        pos++;\n    c = *pos;\n    *pos = 0;\n    for (j = 0;

The amount of duplication is very small now (and hard to find).  There are numerous that are 'almost' duplicate, but vary with specific input. \nThe biggest of the problems have been removed however.   \nNOTE, when new rule sets are submitted, it would be good to have them run through some peer review to make sure they are not full of duplicates (especially rule sets coming from auto-generated rules).\n. HOLD UP!\nI think I see some problems.  Let me validate.  I see some that I think should not be there:\n69544 : $1 $2 d ] ]\n68589 : $8 d ]\nI am pretty sure those were removed because of the d rule, and that is not valid.\nYup, validated, and that is wrong.\n```\n$ cat > x.rule\nd\n$a d ]\n$a$b d ]]\n$ ./a x\nTotal lines read 3 Unique lines written 1\n1 : $a d ]\n2 : $a$b d ]]\n```\n$ echo test | run/john -pipe -stdout -rule=:'d;$ad];$a$bd]]'\ntesttest\ntestatest\ntestabtest\n3p 0:00:00:00 0.00% 14.15p/s testabtest\n.

But it could in random rules.  But this is the type of duplicate finder I am 'trying' to work to find, in a rules emulator that would emulate the work being done, holistically view what was trying to be accomplished, and then see if there is a canonical more optimal way to do something.  So in the $xd] what we are trying to do is insert x into the middle of the word duplicated. So if M$x6 is emulated, it should also show that we are trying to insert x into the middle of the word duplicated, thus showing that $xd] and M$x6 are identical.  However, my script is nowhere to this level of intelligence yet, lol.\n. I had not started on any of the dupes listed in the last post, so do not worry.\nSo, if I did see a dupe of $x d ] and M$x6 I should remove the 2nd one, leaving the first, because we want to make sure that anything left works on more systems?\n. Please simply reject this PR and I will start over with new ones, that can be validated.\n. There is one more block of duplicates after this one.  But now the duplicates are getting fewer, and 'harder' to find and know they are really duplicates.\nAfter the next block, I think I am gonna call it quits for now.  What we have now is a great number of them removed.  Yes, there still are duplicates, but finding enough of them to make the ROI worthwhile is hard.\nI will however, do some rule 'auto re-write', once all of the dupes are in. I want to remove the true no-ops from the file. So far, I have preserved original data (with a couple of exceptions).  The no-ops are things like:     : ^x[ $x] and others.  But I will wait until all duplicate stuff is in, before doing those.  Those changes simply make the rules shorter (fewer steps and faster), by removing commands that play no part in the final word.\n. Well it looks like all recent comments were dumped into this PR, so I think it contains all of the work I have done so far.   That being the case, this is all of the duplicates I plan on right now, unless I spot something else which has a good ROI for the work it takes to find them.\n. This task is not being written off as completed!\n. Here is the entire script used for finding dupes (and finally to remove the no-op data).  NOTE, lots of lines were commented out to start, and then each step uncommented more and more blocks, so that only 1 'type' of duplicate finding was done at each step.  This script was made to run with either HC or john logic.  Also in the john side, we read data from the .conf files with multiple sections.\nIf run with -- hc as the 2 command line params, then only HC logic is used, also neither of the external perl module files will be required.  Those do nothing useful in HC mode.  In john mode, they load and process the .conf files, and perform the preprocessing logic to convert johns input rule (with rpp data in it), into the multiple rules that are used.  I can think of no way to script find duplicates within john's pre-processor extension.  It simply adds too much ambiguity to the work. Duplicates can easily be found with the pp, but it will have to be done by hand. This script works fine at showing the duplicates, BUT whoever is doing it will have to figure out where/how to hook it back into the pp code.  HC has no pp helper logic, so simplistic rule duplication logic is all that is required.\n``` Perl\n!/usr/bin/perl\nscript to canonize (or try to) john/hc/crack rules\n\n1 move all validation to as early as possible.\nlength validations, move to start, or to just after prior length changing command\nis char validations.  Move to start (right after lenght validations), or right after or character modifiers.\ns rule, drop any 2nd usage of original letter (the first ate it).\ns rule, if target (2nd letter) of an s is later the first letter of another s, then merge the 2 rules.\nsort s rules by original letter (and pack back to back).\ns logic groupings are bounded by things like case or other changers.\nplace all adjacent [ before ] so [][][ becomes [[[]] and ][ becomes []\nif we find a [ and there was a prior prepend, then drop the most recent prepend and the [\nif we find a ] and there was a prior append, then drop most recent append and the ]\nNote for prior 2, seeing many rule objects has to remove knowledge of the prior prepend, append\nor both.

Yes, this can be merged. I validated every rule was a duplicate.  There are about 1100 more removed in this PR.\nNOTE, I wrote code to find the rest.  There are a couple of types that I can auto-remove.  The others may take hand looking.  There are roughly 12k more duplicates in dive, than have been removed as of now.\nThe code to find the rest simply built a dictionary file with some random character lines. I started with john's password.lst, then did Rock-You top 50k (which was slow), but in the end, I found the best wordlist simply to be the random character lines, where i have lines of varying lengths (3 to 32), and 50 lines of each length.    The method, is I run each rule over every word. I then hash all the outputs which are different than the input word (simply add them using MD5_Update).  Then when done, do an MD5_Final to a buffer FOR THAT RULE.  Then move on to the next rule against exact same wordlist.   When complete, I simply do a O(n^2) braindead search for rules that have the same hash value (i.e. rules which produced EXACTLY the same end result).  This is not 100% safe, the duplicates DO have to be looked at by hand.  BUT there can be no other rules in the entire set which do produce duplicates. The list I have now is ALL of them.\nBut I am going to wait for this one to be merged (this one has been validated).  If you want, you can look at each commit. There is a comment of exactly which rules were found to be duplicated with which other rules, to see that everything WAS done properly.  There were 2 rules where my script errantly removed a rule. I put them back in by hand.  It had to do with 2 parts of the script fighting with each other (the sorting of the s commands, and the cycle/noop remove code of the s commands)\n. Here is the first 'taste' of the duplicates found by running data:\nduplicate rules:\n(0)  c\n(1304)  T0tc\n(1761)  uc\n(2372)  lc\n(85293)  Ct\n(88696)  Ec\nduplicate rules:\n(1)  l\n(10231)  cl\n(18932)  l*B5*B5\n(33011)  ut\n(47389)  lsMF\n(108387)  ll\nduplicate rules:\n(2)  u\n(148)  uu\n(1138)  cu\n(14801)  Cu\n(27600)  lu\n(63926)  usa3\nAll of those are 100% duplicate.  There are some things that could be scripted for, but I think this will simply have to be looked at by hand, and then a script written to read in this log file and properly remove the lines from the rule file.\nI knew there were duplicates like this (in all, I think dive will end up with 25% or more of it removed, and still have 100% identical finding capability).\nHowever, before I proceed with this, we need to make a call on whether we should change all of the xNM commands to ONM   I think so.  Looking at the data, it really appears that when these rules were generated, that the logic of the ONM is what was wanted for these.  But I will leave that call up to you.  It does greatly impact the duplication finding logic. There are about 2500 fewer duplicates found of we switch from x to O, but most of all, I think there are about 5000 more rules that actually produce hits if we switch from x to O\nThat being the case, it is very likely that all rule files produced prior to when you made that switch should be changed. You might want to keep both flavors, in case there are people running older versions of HC, where the x still means omit.   But if the rules have not been updated since that logic change was done, then x almost certainly is wrong when run on the newer HC versions/\n. > I think changing the xNM to ONM is the right way as the dive.rule was created back when xNM what is today ONM. Go for it!\nI will do that as a stand alone commit, so it does not get 'confused' with anything else.\n\nI'm not so much about supporting old rules.\n\nOk, ONM it is.   A very easy change.  Were there other 'older' .rule files that would have this same issue?  Getting the rules working with proper logic will only help to improve their find rates.  If a rule was supposed to do the logic of Onm, but instead is now doing the extract logic, then it will match many fewer candidates. Actually, it becomes a sore point for duplicates, because often we strip the word down to just 1 or 2 bytes, instead of removing those 1 or 2 bytes.\n. There are some rules in the final dive.rule that are 'almost' duplicates, but have been kept. They may have only produced a couple of unique words on the 55k input file run, but they were kept intact none the less.  I do not see us being able to remove much more than what is removed, without starting to have 'some' affect on the end generated words.  Right now, it is 100% the 'same' as where we started, only 20-25% fewer duplicate words generated.\nThis ruleset still does generated a fairly large number of duplicates, that is mostly due to not using any rejection code.  Running the rules against the input file I have done, produces about 70% or so duplicates.  But this is almost all where the word is left unchanged most of the time.  I am not 100% sure for oclHashcat on the usage of rejection logic.  I now in john for most any salted hash, getting the rejection logic right helps things out. It can cause the speed to be 'less', BUT the overall time required to complete the work is less.  For slower hashes, rejection logic is critical.  That is also with the helper logic in john, that does a uniq logic for generated passwords, and only uses them if the word being generated is different that the last one generated.  That helps, but does not fully eliminated duplicates.   The 70% duplicates is USING the john logic. I bet the percentage is quite a bit higher than that when running the rules through HC.\n. It was a big difference waiting until the xNM were changed to ONM.  The differences were quite a few more before this, and they did not 'look right'.  But after the change, things lined up properly.  I did check the entire list, and all were easy to spot as being duplicates.\nIt looks like generated.rules (and generated2) also need to have the xNM to ONM logic done on them.  They also have quite a few dupes, that can be found using the tools I have.  I will get the x->O checked in first with only that change.  It makes it easier to later look over the duplicate finds, when you have only 1 thing to look at.  Helps to keep my mind focused.\n. ",

I didn't noticed that bug previously.\nBy this way, please stay using C (#511).....\nBoth, c and asm are fine. I'm to old to use c++ or c#......lol\nAgain, well done.....\np.s.

So all founds on the same essid must be in a row.......\nbut they didn't.. It works on small hccap's < 100\nbut my test files a really big ....\nOk, I stay tuned......\n. Right now, I do a presort on the essid and run hashcat on this presorted hccap's.\nSpeed is above 179 M!\n. Maybe the idea of sorting by length of essid is not a good idea.\nIt could be a better way to sort by alphabetical order..... Well done. Now everything works like expected.\nAgain faster then john.........\nThe test file is one of my smallest.......\n. same behavior on hashcat (v3.30-65-g518983d3):\nfound.list: No such file or directory. Thank you for this information.\nIndeed I was very surprised, because if I use a very, vey small wordlist (only wordlistattack with tis testfile), speed is everytime obove 160 MH/s.\nNow I understand......\nBest Regards\n. Hi.\n1) title edited\n   I noticed the difference between pot and outputfile. I only use the outputfile for automated analyses.\n  (because the pot is \"owned\" by hashcat only....)\n2) please do not missunderstand me. That was only a remark, and not a bug report\n    (I don't use cap2hccapx - wrote my own tool instead.....)\n3) shall I open a new issue for this? It's only an idea of me.....\n4) example is on it's way to your pm\nIf you need more examples - please let me know....\n. Well, it's no longer a feature, it's a bug.\nI've send you a pm which contains a hccapx and the concomitant cap which is able to destroy the format of the pot and the -o output file.\nBest regards\nZerBea\n. Well, that's no problem, but the file is realy big. The dumps are downloaded from various sites of the www. So please give me a pm  (at) hashcat.net to send to....\nChecked my mails (jens got my pm address), nothing in there.....\nThe command was every time the same:\nhashcat -m 2500 -w 3 --remove --logfile-disable --potfile-path=$HOME/test/Potfiles/hashcat.pot --outfile-autohex-disable --outfile-format=2 -o $HOME/test/founds $HOME/test/test.hccapx $HOME/test/wordlist\nSame test.hccapx, same hashcat.pot, same wordlist\nFirst run:\nINFO: Removed 76018 hashes found in potfile\nSecond run (every time 264 hashes removed):\nINFO: Removed 264 hashes found in potfile\nThird run (every time 1 hash removed):\nINFO: Removed 1 hash found in potfile\nWell, it seems that hasccat doesn't remove all the founds in pot during the first run.\nhccapxinfo -i test.hccapx -I\nshows\n1286885 records readed from test.hccapx\nhccapx information:\ntotal.hashes.............: 1286885\nunique.nets..............: 94165\nunique.essids............: 71670\nunique.key.mics..........: 285292\nfalse.essids.............: 0\nfalse.nonces.............: 0\nfalse.eap.len............: 0\nkeytype.wpa1.............: 28457\nfalse.keytypes.wpa1......: 0\nkeytype.wpa2.............: 1258428\nfalse.keytypes.wpa2......: 0\neap.4way.type1...........: 0\neap.4way.type2...........: 1282932\neap.4way.type3...........: 0\neap.4way.type4...........: 3953\nWell, the file contains many, many duplicates (doing a cat *.hccapx > test.hccapx isn't such a good idea - but that's the recommended way -> hashcat wiki). On the other hand such a file is very usefull, to explore the boundaries of hashcat....\nWell, I didn't realyze that jsteube expects a bug report (cap2hccapx). But that's no problem, I can do it, if you want. And I can send you my own tools (c-source).\nThe M1+M4 / M3+M4 problem (cap2hccapx) isn't such a big problem, as you the see in the output of hccapxinfo above. Only 3953 hashes of that type dumped....\nThere is also no real need to expand the contence of the authenticated field, because the infos can be gathered from the eapol frame. On the other hand, if there is such a field, why don't we use it in the best manner....\nThat's why I didn't make a bug report.\nBest regards\nZerBea\n. Very strange......\nNo emails, nothing in spam...\nput you now in white list....\nMaybe gmx didn't accept mails from hashcat.net generally????\nPlease try again.\n. Send you a pm containing the testfiles....\nThree parts of 7z archive. None incoming mails. Could it be, that gmx blocked hashcat?. Never used freenode bevor, Must do some investigations how to use it....... on pidgin\n. Ok, works using pidgin....... Again great job.\nWorks like a charm...\nbest regards\nZerBea. Great. I hope that upcomming cap2hccapx converters use this agreement to.\nSo we will get no longer uncontrolled hccapx files in www :)\nThanks again......\n. Not fixed using v3.30-374-gc47f9d4b\nSpeed.Dev.#1.....:   166.9 kH/s (4.88ms)\n. Yes, and no....\nOk. If there are non-cracking hashes inside, it works like you mentioned.\nBut if there is only 1 cracked hash inside, speed will drop and stay on this level......\nLet's say, you have 100 different ap's inside the hccapx, using the same essid called \"default\" and\nthe used word list is about 1 GB.\nThe password for ten ore more ap's is them same \"12345678\"\nSpeed drops from 10 minutes to a day..... \nIf you have a theoretically successrate obove 50 % and many ap's, using the same essid and the same easy pw's, this case happens very often.....\n. No problem. I'll do some complete runs.....\nIt will take a time.....\n. First run:\nv3.30-374-gc47f9d4b\nHashes: 6050728 digests; 146376 unique digests, 146376 unique salts\nSmall wordlist (21197 words)\nall non-cracked\nIt seems to be ok, speed varies from 164.9 kH/s upt to 179 M/s.....\nv3.30-372-gd431874c was constant on ~ 166 kH/s. First run complete:\nStarted: Tue Feb 28 11:06:51 2017\nStopped: Tue Feb 28 11:24:43 2017\n. Second run:\nv3.30-356-g3fb433de (old version)\nStarted: Tue Feb 28 11:26:57 2017\nStopped: Tue Feb 28 11:44:59 2017\nSo far, so good.....\n. Third run:\nv3.30-374-gc47f9d4b\nwe replace 905 not found pw's by found pw's in our wordlist.....\npasswords are picked up randomly......\nStarted: Tue Feb 28 12:11:02 2017\nStopped: Tue Feb 28 12:29:30 2017\nAs you can see, already in this simple case we lose half a minute against the first run (17: 52 vs 18:28).\nThat means, the better the success rate the slower hashcat (that's a big time loss and it behaves like an e-function....).\n. Indeed, it's not a big problem and of course it's ok....\nMan can do some presorting and everything will be fine.\nI'll close this issue, because your fix did it (v3.30-374-gc47f9d4b). It works much better than v3.30-372-gd431874c.....\nAgain, great job, thank you for your effort.. Correct.\nWe are able to do weak point analysis using hccapx files. It's important to know, whether replaycount was disregarded or not, since hashcat had a build in anonce-corr.\nWell, it's not a big change in hashcat, but should be laid down in hccapx structure/format...\nBest regards\nZerBea. Thank you for the info. I know that the code is working well. It was just an information that there are some gcc warnings using the default options of gcc 7.1.1.\nBest regards\nMike\n. Well, it's a good idea to silence the warning, before gcc 7.1.1 reaches UBUNTU.\n. It's the default compiler on arch\nhttps://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/gcc/\nand it's a major release, containing new features (as well as many other improvements) relative to GCC 6.x.\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/\n. Seems to be working on other distro's:\nhttps://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/hashcat/\nCheers\nZerBea\n. Well done.\nWorking like a charm.\nThank's\nZerBea. Please add uncleaned cap an password for included handshake.\nwpa_supplicant is able to handle this (wpa_supplicant.conf):\nkey_mgmt: list of accepted authenticated key management protocols\nWPA-PSK = WPA pre-shared key (this requires 'psk' field)\nWPA-EAP = WPA using EAP authentication\nIEEE8021X = IEEE 802.1X using EAP authentication and (optionally) dynamically\ngenerated WEP keys\nNONE = WPA is not used; plaintext or static WEP could be used\nWPA-PSK-SHA256 = Like WPA-PSK but using stronger SHA256-based algorithms\nWPA-EAP-SHA256 = Like WPA-EAP but using stronger SHA256-based algorithms\nIf not set, this defaults to: WPA-PSK WPA-EAP\n. Please add also the PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA256 plainmasterkey (PMK)\nor check if  wlangenpmk -e essid -p password is able to calculate the correct PMK\nhttps://github.com/ZerBea/hcxkeys\n. I did an analyse on the cap file.\nThe bad news:\nNeither the compare kernel nor the pbkdf kernel will work on this file.\nWe need a new compare kernel and a new PBKDF2-HMAC_SHA256 Kernel.\nThat means: hash-modes 2500 and 2501 will not work.\nThe good news:\nAction-, NULL- and 802.11 Block - Frames are transmitted unencrypted.\nWe are able to jam/spoof this frames.\nWe are able to detect 802.11w\nAuthentication Key Mangement bits are set in Beacon-, Proberequest-, Proberesponse-,\nAuthentication-, Association- and Reassociation-Frames:\nIeee8021 PSK (SHA256)\nManagement Frame Protection Required = TRUE\nManagement Frame Protection Capable = TRUE\nbits 1 and 2 are set in the Key Information Field of the EAP frame\nthat means.: AES Cipher, AES-128-CMAC MIC is used\ninstead of...: AES Cipher, HMAC-SHA1 MIC on wpa2\nor................: RC4 Cipher, HMAC-MD5 MIC on wpa1\nInformation on AES-128-CMAC\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4493\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-38B-2005\nSample c-source (libopenssl):\nhttps://gist.github.com/ecerulm/90653daf2b808aea0837\n. Good news.\nWe are able to reproduce the algo:\nPMK for the hash is:\nfb57668cd338374412c26208d79aa5c30ce40a110224f3cfb592a8f2e8bf53e8\nPTK for the hash is:\n2c76dc592c3b671bac230f6c9e38a062a0ddc98f4ab4d6129022fc7f45fe9264\nAES-MIC for the hash is:\n2e13c40ca1c2e4e2037f99a2da18a46b\nthe following algos are used:\nfor calculating the PTK;\nsha256_prf(pmk, 32, \"Pairwise key expansion\", pkedata, 76, ptk, 48);\nthe calculation of PKE is different to PRF-SHA1.\nfor calculating the MIC:\nomac1_aes_128(ptk, zeigerhcx->eapol, zeigerhcx->eapol_len, mic);\nSource sha256_prf:\nhttps://github.com/digsrc/wpa_supplicant/blob/master/src/crypto/sha256-prf.c\nSource omac1_aes_128:\nhttps://github.com/digsrc/wpa_supplicant/blob/master/src/crypto/aes-omac1.c\nwe should keep in mind that there is another algo:\nsha384_prf, used in IEEE8021X_SUITE_B_192\nSource sha384_prf:\nhttps://github.com/digsrc/wpa_supplicant/blob/master/src/crypto/sha384-prf.c\n. Well, you're right. Indeed, it's implemented pretty much nowhere.\nBut IEEE8021X_SUITE_B and IEEE8021X_SUITE_B_192 are part of wpa_supplicant (and hostapd (?)).\nI found this during my analyse of wpa_supplicant and in the RFC 4868 documentation.\nThe implementation of PRF-256 works pretty good in cpu mode. After long, long talks with atom this weekend, we are now able to crack your hash.\nThe calculation of the PTK is different to PRF-SHA1 (atom found this), because my RFC-conform implementation wasn't able to calculate the correct PTK.\nI did allready an update on hcxtools to convert AES128 CMAC hashes to a separate hccapx for hashcat's upcoming hash-mode 15800 (wlancap2hcx -O option).\n. What are we talking about:\nWPA2 keyver 3 AES128-CMAC (this issue here)\nor\nWPA3 (will use Dragonfly - new feature request) \nThe Dragonfly protocol is specified in RFC 7664. It will use Diffie Hellman (DH) key exchange (implemented in WPS key exchange).\nTherefore we need a complete new attack (hcxtools) and a complete new hashmode for hashcat.\nBut first let's take a look at the first words of http://www.mathyvanhoef.com:\n\"The Wi-Fi Alliance made a press release where it announced WPA3. Unfortunately, this did not include many technical details. Nevertheless, we'll interpret the press release from a technical perspective.

Hi magnum.\nAre you sure, we need an additional ESSID len field in the new hash line?\nFor example:\n * 6d6167006e756d * \nThe parser must do a validity check\n1: count characters between the 2 stars: 14\n2: ESSID len = chars /2\n3: Do we have hex values (%2 ==0) and are they valid (0..9, a..f, A..F)\nIt's similar to the 16800 hash line ESSID (which doesn't contain an ESSID len field).\n. ESSID \nThese SSIDs can be zero to 32 octets (32 bytes) long. \nThe 802.11 standards prior to the 2012 edition did not define any particular encoding/representation for SSIDs, which were expected to be treated and handled as an arbitrary sequence of 0\u201332 octets that are not limited to printable characters. The IEEE 802.11-2012 defines a tag that the SSID is UTF-8 encoded and when interpreting could contain any non-ISO basic Latin characters within it. Wireless network stacks must still be prepared to handle arbitrary values in the SSID field.\nThat is a good reason to use hex values instead of trying to convert an ESSID to printable characters in hash lines.\nEAPOL - we should allow oversized EAPOL len. Found this ones during wpa-sec analysis:\n256, 258, 262, 270, 278, 288, 294, 306, 310, 322, 326, 330, 334,  342, 358, 370, 374, 386, 390, 406, 422, 438, 484, 500, 502, 510\n$ hcxpcaptool -V --eapol-out=eapols caparchiv/2018*\n$ cat eapols | awk 'BEGIN { FS = \":\" } ; { print $NF }' | awk '{print length}' | sort | uniq\nBTW:\nI'm preparing to implement more analysis options to hcxtools. \nCONTROL FIELD:\nRight now we use pcapng comment field to parse additional informations from attacker/dumper to the conversion tool.\nIt would be great if we can use a CONTROL FIELD to parse additional informations from the conversion tool to the hash cracker.\nattack/dumptool --pcapng--> conversion tool --control field--> hash cracker\nAnd it would be awesome if we can use the potfile to parse additional information from hash cracker to the data base (but this will we another proposal: improved potfile line): \nattack/dumptool --pcapng--> conversion tool --control field--> hash cracker  --potfile--> data base\nThan, to complete the WPAx cycle,  we can think about a feed back from the data base to the attacker/ dumper:\ndata base --xxxxx--> attack/dumptool\n. We have no additional field for MIC and key ver, because we can retrieve them from EAPOL,\nas well as the length.\nPlease keep  in mind that we must expect more than the the allready implemented length:\nPMK_LEN_MAX 64 (32, as yet)\nWPA_EAPOL_KEY_MIC_MAX_LEN 32 (16, as yet)\nAlso please notice, that we have a new key descriptor value (0=AKM-defined instead of 1=wpa1, 2=wpa2 , 3=wpa2 key ver 3) on AKM-defined handshakes.\nExampel is here:\nhttps://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717-post-42759.html#pid42759\nRight now hcxpcaptool will set this value to 3 (AES-128-CNC), so that hashcat is able to run hash mode 2501 on that handshakes (currently that works on SAE, but it's a really, really ugly hack). In future times we can use the control field to parse AKM-defined data to the cracker.\n. These are the 2 structs for an authentication frame and a wpa-key frame:\nstruct eapauthentication_frame\n{\n uint8_t    version;\n uint8_t    type;\ndefine EAP_PACKET 0\ndefine EAPOL_START 1\ndefine EAPOL_LOGOFF 2\ndefine EAPOL_KEY 3\ndefine EAPOL_ASF 4\ndefine EAPOL_MKA 5\nuint16_t   len;\n uint8_t    data[1];\n} attribute((packed));\ntypedef struct eapauthentication_frame eapauth_t;\ndefine EAPAUTH_SIZE offsetof(eapauth_t, data)\nstruct wpakey_frame\n{\n uint8_t    keydescriptor;\n uint16_t   keyinfo;\n uint16_t   keylen;\n uint64_t   replaycount;\n uint8_t    nonce[32];\n uint8_t    keyiv[16];\n uint64_t   keyrsc;\n uint8_t    keyid[8];\n uint8_t    keymic[16];\n uint16_t   wpadatalen;\n uint8_t    data[1];\n} attribute((packed));\ntypedef struct wpakey_frame wpakey_t;\ndefine WPAKEY_SIZE offsetof(wpakey_t, data)\nSo it's easy to lay the struct over the EAPOL frame, using bash commands.\nLet's take the example from above and get EAPOL data:\n$ hcxpcaptool -V sae4way.pcapng --eapol-out=example\nreading from sae4way.pcapng\nsummary:                                      \nfile name....................: sae4way.pcapng\nfile type....................: pcapng 1.0\nfile hardware information....: x86_64\nfile os information..........: Linux 4.18.16-arch1-1-ARCH\nfile application information.: hcxdumptool 5.0.0\nnetwork type.................: DLT_IEEE802_11_RADIO (127)\nendianess....................: little endian\nread errors..................: flawless\npackets inside...............: 15\nskipped packets..............: 0\npackets with GPS data........: 0\npackets with FCS.............: 0\nbeacons (with ESSID inside)..: 1\nprobe requests...............: 1\nprobe responses..............: 1\nassociation requests.........: 1\nassociation responses........: 1\nauthentications (SAE)........: 4\nEAPOL packets................: 7\nEAPOL PMKIDs.................: 1\nbest handshakes..............: 1 (ap-less: 0)\nNow let's get the MICs:\n$ cat example | cut -c 189-220\nc652368806f943802f8f57789e1a20d1\n60e5524831cfaff7438ae1c365b9a9e4\nan the key ver:\n$ cat example | cut -c 40-40\n8\n8\n8\na \na\nexplanation:\n8 = AKM-defined, pair wise key\na = WPA2, pair wise key (hcxpcaptool attack vector to downgrade to WPA2 - failed!)\nOr we can add some options to the conversion tool to extract this informations, additional for a data base.\nPlease keep in mind that we use only single EAPOL data for this tests, not a complete, new hash line.\nIf we need fix positions, we should change position from * ESSID * EAPOL * to * EAPOL * ESSID *\n. Maybe it's necessary to increase control field size ( * 00000000 * ) to parse more informations to cracker. Current informations:\nnonce error corrections needed on BE\nnonce error corrections needed on LE\nnonce error corrections needed on BE/LE\nno nonce error corrections needed (hash is a result of an AP-LESS attack vector - we should split this)\nInformation of message pair is not necessary, because we can retrieve this from EAPOL data\nnew :\nuse AKM-defined MIC / PMKID calculation (SHA_192, SHA384, SHA_512, AES-128-CNC for SAE/FILS/WPA3)\nuse PMK len 64\nPMKID received from AP or PMKID received from CLIENT (we got the first one of this kind)\nno nonce error corrections needed\nhash is a result of an AP-LESS attack vector\n. I am a little blinded, because I analyzed plenty of cap files during the last week to test the new hash line.  Reuse of PBKDF2 over EAPOL and PMKID makes cracking process really, really fast.\nThe same applies to reuse of PMK over EAPOL and PMKID.\nSo thanks for your explanation.\nBTW:\nFrom my point of view (hcxtools) a concerted hash line for hashcat and JtR would be fantastic!!!\n. Some early words about the potfile.\nIt would be great to retrieve a potfile line, containing main informations about the result, like this one: \nmac_ap * mac_sta * PMK * PMKID * control field * ESSID (in hex) : PSK\nParsing this kind of information, the hash cracker (hashcat) become part of the whole analysis process. It can add additional informations (for example: how the PSK was retrieved) to the control field and parse it to the data base.\n. More words about the potfile:\nRight now, hashcat use a md5_64 hash over EAPOL (and some other fields, like mac, anonce, ESSID) to make a hash unique and to remove duplicates. Unfortuneatelay an EAPOL message contains several values of counters and many flags, which changes from hash to hash. So hashcat calculates on every hash a new md5_64. A better way is to use the calculated PMK to make the network (and not the hash) unique. That will work, even if the incomming new hash has no ESSID or a damaged ESSID. That is a real benefit of a combined hash line (2500, 2501, 16800, 16801) and a combined potfile line ((2500, 2501, 16800, 16801). Also it will keep the potfile small.\n. How can we help?\n. Now everything is working like expected. Thanks.\n. ",

I have seen a few posts on hashcat forums and alike with the same problem. I'm not sure why but there seems to be quite a few sha512 128:128 going around.\n. It's fine, I hope it gets added at some point. I am using JTR at the moment, it's still on CPU but it works.\n. Any update on this guys?\nIt would be awesome if you could define your own salt length.\n. Can you point me in the direction of the code I need to be looking at to change the salt length for sha512(pass.salt) then please? I've been looking and I really don't know. ( I know it's more complicated than changing a number)\n. This can be closed then.\n. \"it's generally more like you want to have a longer salt support.

It's not too hard to add\"\nThen\n\"You have to write a completely new SHA512 implementation that can support that large of an input. \"\nWhich one is right?\n. Oh really... continue explaining a little please?\n. Actually.. won't I have the same problem trying to account for the hash length? or is it just a case of merging the two with the increased salt length?\n. Nope.. Don't think I can do it xD in 1710 the salt section is all seperate.. in 13800 you have the salt code mixed up seems like and involved with the carry switches and the memcat function?\nSeems so much more complicated than 1710 >.>\nEdit: well I have no idea.. if anybody could tell me the parts that need changing that would be great but for now I really don't know.\n. Found a better solution to my problems, credit to atom and phil :dancer: \nClose if u wish or keep it up, whatever.\n. Not related to hashcat..\nWouldn't mind hearing your 2 salt thing tho..\n. Yea I meant for hashcat CPU... I'd like to see and most likely will try to replicate on sha512. \nIn fact I don't even know if it would be simpler to change the salt length in CPU version.\n. I have a CPU program that does just that.\nWordlist attack ofcourse but still.\n. Hashcat already decrypts AES-256-cbc in a few algos, blockchain for instance.\n. I don't understand but I guess that is just my limited knowledge xD\nLike.. this decrypts my aes encryption..\nopenssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in hash.txt -a -k password\nSo if that can do it? hashcat can't? that is a directly encrypted password(cipher whatever) with aes no?\n. This is over a year old but yea.. I know this stuff by now :). +1 for this, longer salt length strikes again :D. Don't suppose this is easily upgradable to 128 salt length? not related to filezilla, just for an obscure software, but if its easy enough I'd just do it for myself.. Also have a strong interest in this.. I'm on windows 10, 16gb ram, can anybody else on windows 10 check? thanks.. Well, whatever you did it works fine across all modes now, good job..

I've used them several times and found that processing ran much faster than on EC2 spot instances. Easy interface too and pay per hour. Should be able to do many times better than a t2.micro I'd guess. \nI'm playing around with an Arty7 FPGA dev board I have. I created an Electrum cracker engine to try it out. Still simulating and debugging but it actually may work. I thought I would get 24 Mpwds/sec but it looks like the timing is too tight. It uses dual sha256 hashers from an FPGA bitcoin miner and dual AES  decrypter (both open source cores), and my own pwd sequencer logic. It hooks to a pc via usb and you send the xprv and pwd gen mask by usb, and wait for result back. We'll see... if it works then concievably it would be not hard to make a board with many fpga chips on it running in parallel. This chip costs ~ $40 each.. Ya, the FPGA is just toying around for curiosity and practice as I happen to have it here. I've got a working design in simulation but at 10M pwds/sec it still raises timing errors. I'm probably not doing something right so it's good to figure the timing out. In simulation it actually hashes correct values and decrypts the hash to match xprv result - so that's pretty cool for me.. @marcushat \nDid it take all 18-19 days running to get it?. I guess the slow down was since micro instances aren't suited to ongoing cpu load and they limit you after a while. It's great to see that it actually worked out.. ",

If a keyfile is being used, can we simply append this 64 bytes of data to that keyfile data? If these hacks are not possible at all, we can bump the version field to 3, and come up with a new hash format.\nI have opened the corresponding JtR issue now. Patches for keepass2john.c are highly welcome. Thanks!. Yes, I think support for both cases (manual specification of \"wua\" bytes, automatic extraction of those bytes) would be needed.\nYes, we already build JtR Jumbo with MinGW for Windows users.

What I'm trying to achieve in the above code block is to append the hex values of ctx0.h to s and compute sha256 for both of them. Probably there's something wrong in the above block.. ",
    "fgaudreault": "It will be hard to give you an exact bracket or a fixed number, the salt length will vary depending of variables such as the username, the node name, the date, etc. :/ The other thing is that the salt will contain null bytes.\n. Ok, that make sense. I actually created a new parser yesterday on a local copy, but now I have to figure out how to change the algorithm (which is almost identical to -m 140), except that the salt is bigger and the password is encoded in utf16le.\n. Ok, so I will prepare a pull for the parser code (which is basically a copy of 140, but with higher min/max salt length constants), and a copy of the 140 kernels as a base. My local test picked the salt, but the core was not able to crack the password. I believe that's normal nice the kernels are not able to handle that data yet. I used -m 134 since the PeopleSoft application passwords were -m 133.\n. Awesome!! Sorry you had to rewrite some of our code :/  For the verify, I added the mode 13500 to the hash:salt portion.. unless we have additional stuff to add? Let me run it and see whats missing.\n. Ill look at it this morning. When I tried yesterday, I couldnt get it to work.\n. Ok. I just added the missing portion. The rest was already there. I will do a pull request. Actually, the hash file had to be hash:salt, and the crack hash:salt:word in order for the script to work properly. Pull request is open.\n. We changed the mode to 13500, and added an esalt structure. I believe the buffers are populating the data according to your recommendations. So what are the next steps? :)\n. The tests are still missing, as well as the appropriate kernel code. But for the rest, we should have the base in place. More tests will be required afterward.\n. I think that would be great. I'll just make sure we have the tests in place, and remove the warning on compiling. Should be done in the next commit. Meanwhile, I will also fix the test.pl file for the new Digest::ECB versions, the constants are no longer exported.\n. I think we are good now. The test.pl results have been cross-checked using JtR, and it cracks properly. Unfortunately, I had to use a constant salt, but that should do the trick.\n. There is no DES in the algorithm. I fixed the use Crypt::ECB module only because the newer version is no longer using PADDING_NONE and PADDING_AUTO, you have to push the padding in the encrypt sub. That being said, we will fix the problems.\n. Aight. So at this point, we think we would need the kernels in order to test the full loop on our own and fix the remaining issues. Because it's the first time we touch the code base, having working kernels would help, and if you can help us with that, it would go much faster. Thanks for your patience btw ;)\n. ",

See https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1350\nPossibly related - I found that my AMD Radeon device on a new MacBook Pro fails to crack hashes that it should . @kureeoffsec would you be able to test the commands I posted in https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1350 to confirm that your AMD GPU device on OSX is showing the same behaviour as mine? i.e. no warnings, but fails to find passwords that it should.. -D 1 always seems to work\n-d 2 always seems to work\n-d 3 never works.\nSo the culprit seems to be my \"AMD Radeon Pro 455 Compute Engine, 512/2048 MB allocatable, 12MCU\"\n. Ok good to know that the AMD device should not be used for now.\nHowever, I am also seeing crashes on launch (Abort Trap 6) when I'm using all devices or device 2 only (Intel(R) HD Graphics 530) in combination with larger wordlists and rulesets.\nI was running -d 3 to avoid these crashes but it appears cracking is broken with this device (no wonder I didn't crack anything the last few days).\nSee https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/309. Thanks\n-d 2 -w 1 with large wordlist/ruleset still gets Abort Trap 6 on launch\n-d 2 -w 1 -u 1 -n 1 --force runs, but the speed is 720 kH/s which is approximately John CPU only speed.. If \"AMD Radeon Pro 455 Compute Engine, 512/2048 MB allocatable, 12MCU\" is known not to work on OSX currently perhaps it should be auto-disabled or there should be a warning?. Same result with -O (optimized kernels) - Using the AMD Radeon Pro 455 device on OSX (-d 3) Hashcat doesn't display any warnings or errors but silently fails to find any passwords.\nDoes Hashcat v3.6.0-465-g0a0522cf contain the self-test mentioned in https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1348? Should that catch it?\nIn my humble opinion, I think it would be a good idea to disable this particular AMD device on OSX as it seems broken, or at least explicitly document this issue.\nWhether it's a bug in the OpenCL runtime or Hashcat itself is an irrelevant distinction from the user's perspective.\nHashcat running on OSX on current Mac hardware with default options gives the user feedback that everything is working normally, but it will randomly fail to find some passwords (or never find any passwords, if selecting to run only on the buggy device, which I was doing to try to avoid the crashing issue documented in https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/309, which is also not resolved).\nSo Hashcat is giving the user false assurance about the strength of the hashes tested.. I'm as sure as I can be (as the reporter) that it's not PEBKAC.\nI gave the contents of the hash and wordlist files, and the exact commands used above.\nUsing both the Intel and AMD devices in my MacBook Pro (default behaviour), it fails to find the password randomly, which I also experienced during a real-world run with a large dictionary and bigger list of hashes.\nSpecifying only the AMD device, it never finds any passwords. This is 100% repeatable and consistent.\nI have asked the reporter of https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1348 if he could try my commands, as he may be hitting the same issue also with an AMD device on OSX.. @0xbsec I think that would be a great idea. Would have saved me several days of running Hashcat on a non-working GPU device and not finding any passwords. ",

All parameters (hash, wordlists, rules) are stated in my first post, please read. Also I'm not using GPU at all, I'm using Intel OpenCL SDK with Intel XEON E3, also stated in first post.\nI'm using 42M wordlist + >200000 rules, so what could be wrong?\nI've also tried piping old cpu hashcat version but it gives even worse performance.\nOn CPU hashcat (old version v2.00) speed is same for both cases - incremental / wordlist, that's why I filled an issue here, might be there some performance bug for wordlist / rules attack?\n. Is there any more clarification why speed jumps so much for wordlist attack vs incremental?\nThanks.\n. no worries.\njust thought it'd be useful for others, i'm just adding salt to hashfiles via sed.\n.

I'll post a patch later if anyone is interested.\nEDIT: I've updated first post to reflect the actual feature request for oclHashcat.\n. Is there some sort of documentation on kernels to understand how to write your own dynamic hash (e.g. the one I mentioned in my first comment)?\n. The reason why it doesn't work, because you probably made it with:\n$ echo apple|md5sum -\n30c6677b833454ad2df762d3c98d2409 -\nso it actually puts 'apple\\n' instead of 'apple'\nwhilst you should always use echo -n (so there will be no newline in your hash):\n$ echo -n apple|md5sum -\n1f3870be274f6c49b3e31a0c6728957f  -\n. there are multiple solutions to your problem\nyou can use https://bitbucket.org/seinlc/hashtopussy\n. @jsteube, I've tried that branch in both -m 0 and -m 2711 modes with -a 1 and it hashcat didn't find any of the long (>128) passwords candidates. I can see in hashcat's status that such passwords are enumerated but not found for some reason.\n-m 2711 isn't supporting salts bigger than 30 chars.\nI see that you've been adding commits to improve password length for other password hashes. \nSo guess we just have to wait a bit.\nThanks a lot once again for your work, highly appreciated..

Jens, thanks for the follow up.  My cracking machine has been busy the past week, but I will try the steps you outlined soon.. Following those steps resolved the issue.  The intel driver installation utility did offer me two separate versions of the GPU driver, however, I chose to install only the latest version.. Same crash with -d 1 and with -d 2. The 3.20 release version works without issue. Sorry for the delay, I was away on vacation.  I see the same crash as of commit e5e97c6ff8771a047cff195bd0993a3a7d08d4b2. Ugh, forgot to make clean first.  After doing so it appears the crash has been resolved.  Thanks!. Sorry about that, I had indeed updated the hashcat version but when I uploaded it to my windows box I had forgotten I had the old bin paused in a background window.  File locking prevented the new version from being written.  After fixing this, everything works again.. ",
    "anthraxx": "Ok thats cool, but then i especially recommend to never delete tags, they don't really hurt and depending on distributions they don't always ship the newest version. Removing tags breaks building those packages or reproducibly building old packages.\n. Yeah we definitively need a solution that preserves all tags if you don't want to break any kind of user builds like arch AUR, gentoo etc etc :stuck_out_tongue: So I hope once we resolve this issue we could hopefully get back the old tags, plzzz :smile_cat: \nWell now I know the reason, what i'm using when I package GIT versions to have a meaningful string:\nprintf \"%s.%s.%s\" \"$(git tag|sort|tail -n1)\" \"$(git rev-list --count HEAD)\" \"$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\"\nthis gets the semantically same output:\nv0.15.7.786.1dd1f3d%\n. I guess you did not really understand what i mean :smile: \nremoving tags is really a  bad habit, what i mean is that i offered an alternative approach to git describe that outputs you a usefull version string but uses the most current tag.\ngit tags should always be preserved, in my opinion its a failure on the code base if it requires to remove tags (really no offense, I try to find a solution that fits both sides)\nRemoving tags also removes the tarballs here: https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/releases\nI also understand what you mean, but doing it that way destroys the whole possibility building from source tarballs. Also if you jump back to a commit that is equivalent to 2.01 version, then this git describe command will still show you version 3.00. I remember there was a way to extract the current git tag version into a file for the release tarballs, I think radare is doing, let me search a bit around and i can show you what I mean\n. That's great to hear... and please don't get me wrong, I really try to also solve your problem that you may face and I'm really not blaming or offending :smiley_cat: \n- restoring the old tags:\ngit tag v2.00 5065474b4e5ed59add2d5af6e2e9cf3857969fe3\n  git tag v2.01 490ff03fe18b3966ab591e859a79e29eab5ea386\n  git push --tags\nCan you help me trying to reproduce your problem why it still showed v2.01 for you? I have recreated the tags on a local checkout but i could not make git to output v2.01 for the current master HEAD when the v3.00-beta tag was in place :sob: \nI assume you want to avoid having a VERSION file in the root? It would of cause require to manually maintain that file, but that would solve some of the issues and the version in the Makefile could be a concat of that VERSION file + optionally (if its a git checkout and not a tarball extraction) a git describe without tags so the version will reflect also the git hash.\n. Ok, I have found what i meant. Its called export-subst and allows to set a file via .gitattributes where a git version identifier is exported into a marker in the file. This allows to have a switch for non git checkouts (tarballs). If you like this solution, I could create a pull request for that. This would solve that 'git describe' is not available for tarballs.\n. normally git describe should traverse the history graph and pick the latest tag that is linked to the current HEAD when using describe, that's why I'm quite confused. You can try a test repository and play around with tagging and describe, I'm pretty sure it uses the nearest tag to a specific commit.\nOk, I think I get your idea, I will create a pull request with the switch I explained and you can have a look at it.\nThe idea is that it then supports both, 'git describe' (like now) if the current directory is a git checkout (contains .git directory) or as a fallback (if it is a github release tarball) it uses a static version identifier that will be inserted into the Makefile automagically by git-archive.\nReally big thanks that you restored the old tags, I'm very thankful (and I'm sure a lot more people also).\nWill link the pull request when I have time.... maybe in some hours or the following days.\n. I have attached a pull-request with detailed explanation. This will allow to build from a release tarball again but will require that the tarball is either downloaded from github or created locally via 'git archive' command. However note that without such change the 'git describe' will fail in a non git-checkout.\nIf at any point your 'git describe' issues will reappear, feel free to ping me and I'm still willing to help solving that one for you.\n. Feel free to ask for any changes or clarification, I'm happy to explain or change my pull request :smile_cat: \nThis is related to https://github.com/hashcat/oclHashcat/issues/342\n. yes, for both, the git checkout and the exported tarball via 'git archive'. For the git checkout nothing is changed compared to what you had before: this is the normal behavior of 'git describe', it will only add \"-1-gxxxxxxx\" when there are newer commits on top of the last tag. So once new commits are pushed after the \"v3.00\" then it starts adding those suffixes.\nPS: if you want to always add the git hash for the git checkout and/or git archive (even if the current commit is in fact the current tag) then I can change that in the pull request for you.\n. worked on my test, is that a git checkout or the archive? let me check. sry\n. @jsteube sure my fault do worries. let me refix it and test properly, forgot the git checkout test and using git archive replaced the variable identifiers\n. @jsteube Big sorry for the previous failure, I will buy you a beer if we ever meet at a con (f.e. 33C3)! :beers: \nHave re-fixed the previous commit and tested all kind of combinations i could think of.\nTo avoid any possible failure before merging, feel free to clone my fork https://github.com/anthraxx/oclHashcat and run your test before accepting. Thank you very much for taking your time with this.\n. I can confirm this issue, but the provided patch does not help for me (running Linux).\n```\n\nstrace -e open,rmdir,mkdir hashcat --benchmark \n[...]\nmkdir(\"/usr/bin/kernels\", 0700)         = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)\nopen(\"/usr/bin/hashcat.restore\", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nhashcat (v3.00) starting in benchmark-mode...\n\nrmdir(\"/usr/bin/hashcat.induct\")        = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nmkdir(\"/usr/bin/hashcat.induct\", 0700)  = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)\nERROR: /usr/bin/hashcat.induct: Permission denied\n+++ exited with 255 +++\n```\nit should use some world writable location like /tmp or cwd. Currently this issue keeps me from being able to move hashcat into the main distro packages.\neverything installed via make install\n. @joshdekock well I provided PREFIX but didn't thought it may be required for building and the install step that contained the PREFIX was separated. works, thx :smile_cat: \n. well, I agree with the documentation, however the /usr/share directory will never be writable to a user for a distro package. Luckily hashcat uses ~/.hashcat/ is such cases.\n. I see, valid point. ignore my comment :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \n. Consistency is nice but primarily my goal was to be able to get the signature file... where the other files are coming from did not really matter... thats the good part of a trusted signature, the source could be anywhere (like a dropbox :smile: )\nthanks a lot for clarification and fixing, works. Packaging it for my distro now :smile_cat: \n. @jsteube no problem, i was just wondering when observing it again :yum: . well advanced user here or there but this is a security issue and especially non-advanced users are even less aware of the security implication :smile: \nyes, right now i simply strip out the whole rpath to mitigate this threat. stripping it on install would work for those, but the thing is, technically the users not using the install target will still be vulnerable to this problem. in my opinion people need to learn to make things work without the relative rpath to not expose anyone to a potential threat.\nhow about some kind of simply shell script with a readme block that aids non-advanced users to run it locally without installing it into the system?. as said, you don't need to teach anyone about LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you have a wrapper script that does so and uses explicitly the directory where the shared lib was built in. Otherwise its still vulnerable for all people who don't use the install target.\nThe only solution to this issue is to not use relative rpath at all and add a wrapper script to start hashcat when not being in a 'installed' target, otherwise the users are always vulnerable to unintended code execution.. I don't see the difference, wherever you put you hashcat executable could be the place to have the hashcat wrapper script. Nobody would ever notice the difference if you adjust the install target accordingly and distribute the non-wrapper version instead. I honestly don't see where the problem is.. Why would they get an error message? You can easily put the wrapper somewhere else and handle it in the compilation step by moving it where the binary would be. No offense but I start having the feeling like you just don't want to solve this at all for people that use a local copy of hashcat and just keep them vulnerable because of \"convenience\" (where I still disagree that it can't be transparently solved if you really want to).\nThe concerns you mentioned are understandable, but as I pointed out, each one can be solved individually while still not requiring any rpath. I don't see why you can't have such wrapper and i don't see why it has to be there before having compiled the project.. @jsteube sometimes its hard to get intentions and thoughts of someone else over pure text, but i'm very happy to hear this, so excuse my interpretation :smile_cat: \nLuckily the script doesn't need anything complex, just resolving basedir of itself and use LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH before calling the real hashcat binary. While I don't have environments set up to test all those, I can help getting the script and Makefile working... you could then test it in your supported environments.\nThe latter solution sounds also fine. Is it correct when I would expect the 'shared' make target to produce both artifacts, the libhashcat.so and the hashcat binary that dynamically links to it and the 'default' make target that simply produces a statically linked version? Both solutions sound fine to mitigate the relative rpath... its all up to you're preference :smiley: . @jsteube cool, thanks :+1: . @jsteube yes please do, we on Arch definitively want to build unbundled. The problem goes even further as we are using the sources your provide that have detatched signature and its not possible currently to build 5.0.0.\nCan you please make it optionally work to build with system xxhash? this currently blocks the 5.0.0 update.. @ZeroChaos- you can take a sneak preview via #1772 :smile_cat: . It's a pretty basic solution you can still rework it afterwards. You didn't sound like you want to do it so I grabbed my editor and created a PR for your convenience \n. In your private mail my summary from what you wrote was like nothing will happen. And this got closed without such a statement as well, so I implemented it as it's simple to do. Was unaware and unintended this will hurt feelings and I had no ill will here just trying to help instead of only  complain  \ud83e\udd14 code is iterative nothing stops from doing a alternative solution later but I needed one right now to package it for Arch.\n. @jsteube well the Makefile is malformed f.e. $(LIBRARY_DEV_ROOT_FOLDER/ is src/Makefile:111: *** unterminated variable reference.  Stop.. @jsteube works fine over here, thanks for the work. This fixes #1741 . ",

Perhaps there's another test or example that would exercise those better?\nAlso, trying to find and run some tests (figuring that tools/test.sh is a likely candidate :), I'm getting this:\n$ tools/test.sh\n[ test_1475374305 ] > Init test for hash type 0.\n[ test_1475374305 ] [ Type 0, Attack 0, Mode single, Device-Type Gpu, Vector-Width 1 ] > OK : 0/31 not found, 0/31 not matched, 0/31 timeout\n[ test_1475374305 ] [ Type 0, Attack 0, Mode single, Device-Type Gpu, Vector-Width 4 ] > OK : 0/31 not found, 0/31 not matched, 0/31 timeout\ncat: illegal option -- A\nusage: cat [-benstuv] [file ...]\n$\n. First, it still does not provide crack-per-second info. I suspect it might be related to your tests, not necessarily the executable itself - please take a look at that.\nSecond - the current github version crashes on me:\n```\n$ ./example400.sh\nhashcat (v3.10-541-g1c055a6+) starting...\nOpenCL Platform #1: Apple\n\nDevice #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4650U CPU @ 1.70GHz, skipped\nDevice #2: HD Graphics 5000, 384/1536 MB allocatable, 40MCU\n\nHashes: 1 digests; 1 unique digests, 1 unique salts\nBitmaps: 16 bits, 65536 entries, 0x0000ffff mask, 262144 bytes, 5/13 rotates\nRules: 1\nApplicable Optimizers:\n Zero-Byte\n Single-Hash\n Single-Salt\n Slow-Hash-SIMD\nWatchdog: Temperature abort trigger disabled\nWatchdog: Temperature retain trigger disabled\nStarting attack in stdin mode...\n./example400.sh: line 1: 56608 Done                    cat example.dict\n     56609 Segmentation fault: 11  | ./hashcat -m 400 example400.hash\n$ \n```\nAlso, I see that your build recognizes Darwin (Mac OS), but it does not add flag -framework OpenCL to either CFLAGS or LDFLAGS. This flag is required for both compilation and linking phases on Mac OS. I wonder if there's a clash between KHRONOS_OPENCL include files you're pulling from GitHub and the native ones that Apple provides as part of OpenCL framework, since the OpenCL libraries the executable links against are definitely based on the Apple OpenCL files (which might have subtle differences from those at Khronos). oclHashcat successfully builds without that flag, but I don't know if it introduces some incompatibility/problem down the road...\nDebugging traces are in the next message.\nUpdate: \nIn case this matters: MacOS Sierra 10.12, Xcode-8.0.0 (also tried with Macports GCC-6.2.\n.

Thank you! Efforts of @matrix and @jsteube are much appreciated.\n. @jsteube one thing more: the current oclHashcat master cannot be compiled with Macports-installed gcc because of the assembler issues. Two possible solutions are:\n- For Darwin detect that GCC is Macports-installed, and then add -Wa,-q flag to CFLAGS. This is a bit cumbersome, among other reasons because Macports people insist that there must be no differentiator between \"standard\" GNU GCC and its Macports port.\n- For Darwin set the compiler to clang instead of gcc. This appears to be a much better solution - and it works (clang is the default Xcode compiler). That's what I compiled the master with.\nHere's the patch that I urge you to merge:\n```\ndiff --git a/src/Makefile b/src/Makefile\nindex 0b28ea5..2f7fd08 100644\n--- a/src/Makefile\n+++ b/src/Makefile\n@@ -134,6 +134,7 @@ endif # FreeBSD\nifeq ($(UNAME),Darwin)\n export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9\n+CC                      := clang\n CFLAGS_NATIVE           := $(CFLAGS)\n CFLAGS_NATIVE           += -framework OpenCL\n CFLAGS_NATIVE           += -march=native\n```\n. @jsteube thank you!\n. > That solution slows down cracking massive...\nAs compared to crashing with SEGV...?\n. > > That solution slows down cracking massive...\n\nif my patch slow down the cracking speed we can't use it, also if without got a segfault\n\nAs my timing shows, that patch does slow things up, but by no means \"massive\". The difference appeared to be be between 19 minutes and 15 seconds, and 19 minutes and 6 seconds. Not overwhelming.\nNow trying your v2 (currently running :).\n\nIf you need hashcat for some particular reason you can use my repo temporarily until we solve the bug in the best way possible\n\nBoth are fine (waiting for the best solution, and using your repo for now). I am not in any rush. Initially I stumbled upon this project as a good way to exercise OpenCL.\n\nor switch to linux solution\n\nSorry, impractical for me. And I'm not that eager to run Linux in a virtual machine.\n\nSorry all for later response but yesterday I woke up with fever :( I'm sick ... grrr\n\nWish you to get healthy soon!\nAlso, I hope my findings (like, where the first Mac OS X-related failure came about) can be of use:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/508#issuecomment-257064018\nUpdate\nThe current hashcut master (not oclHashcat) runs example0.sh in 19 minutes 9 seconds - only three seconds longer than the oclHashcat (when it doesn't crash :).\n. This is a change to accommodate Mac OS X OpenCL framework:\n```\ndiff --git a/src/Makefile b/src/Makefile\nindex 8c9f2d6..8b7cdd5 100644\n--- a/src/Makefile\n+++ b/src/Makefile\n@@ -94,7 +94,7 @@ VERSION_TAG              := $(shell test -d .git && git describe --tags --dirty=\n ## Compiler flags\n ##\n-INCLUDE_PATHS            := -Iinclude/ -IOpenCL/ -I$(OPENCL_HEADERS_KHRONOS)/\n+INCLUDE_PATHS            := -Iinclude/ -IOpenCL/\nCFLAGS                   += -pipe -W -Wall -std=c99\n@@ -123,10 +123,12 @@ BINARY_NATIVE            := $(PROG_NAME)\nifeq ($(UNAME),Darwin)\n export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9\n-CFLAGS_NATIVE            :=\n+CFLAGS_NATIVE            := -framework OpenCL\n CFLAGS_NATIVE            += $(CFLAGS)\n-LFLAGS_NATIVE            := -lpthread\n+LFLAGS_NATIVE            := -lpthread -framework OpenCL\n LFLAGS_NATIVE            += $(LDFLAGS)\n+else\n+INCLUDE_PATHS            += -I$(OPENCL_HEADERS_KHRONOS)/\n endif # darwin\nifeq ($(UNAME),Linux)\n```\nI'd appreciate if you could merge it.

may be those are before patch release.\nEdit: now with version 10.1 we know there is not random padding.\n i am connecting with same client to ver 11 and 12. one with random and another without. so how server knows use random padding?\nwe should check other bytes in communication.\n. now what is it??\n00000B37  01 0b 00 00 06 00 00 00  00 00 08 03 00 0c 00 00 ........ ........\n    00000B47  00 0c 41 55 54 48 5f 53  45 53 53 4b 45 59 40 00 ..AUTH_S ESSKEY@.\n    00000B57  00 00 40 45 45 45 44 44  37 43 33 37 33 38 38 46 ..@EEEDD 7C37388F\n    00000B67  35 30 39 33 45 30 36 32  36 44 34 35 35 32 35 31 5093E062 6D455251\n    00000B77  35 33 35 34 43 34 30 46  38 33 43 44 39 38 43 30 5354C40F 83CD98C0\n    00000B87  44 32 31 32 38 36 34 41  36 38 32 31 38 32 30 39 D212864A 68218209\n    00000B97  39 44 45 00 00 00 00 0d  00 00 00 0d 41 55 54 48 9DE..... ....AUTH\n    00000BA7  5f 56 46 52 5f 44 41 54  41 00 00 00 00 39 09 00 _VFR_DAT A....9..\n    00000BB7  00 1a 00 00 00 1a 41 55  54 48 5f 47 4c 4f 42 41 ......AU TH_GLOBA\n    00000BC7  4c 4c 59 5f 55 4e 49 51  55 45 5f 44 42 49 44 00 LLY_UNIQ UE_DBID.\nEdit: Oracle 10g TNS AES-128 authentication. client connecting to oracle 11.2.0 server\n@magnumripper  your ettercap cannot detect this, also has problem with client version.server version is ok on this pcap file.\n. @magnumripper  check this pcap. when you connect to oracle 12 server from unpatched client, server falls back to oracle 10 protocol. notice to salt and auth_sesskey length.\noracle_11_12.zip\n. @magnumripper   o3logon is in oracle 8. i dont know why it first uses ntlm. after that it is ora 10.\noracle 10 is more secure than oracle 11 with 0808 padding\nEdit: in my older pcaps i used sqldeveloper that it is using jdbc (java driver). in last one it is sqlplus.\n. yes it is fixed in hashcat-3.30+155.7z\nthx. @Fist0urs\nwe need more than 50k. could you give me a clue. i am in a hurry.\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/282\n.

    "devils-advocate213": "Well, that gets rid of the first error, but doesn't provide a correct calculation.\nHere's an example:\n./oclHashcat64.bin -m 2500 SSID.hccap english_and_1_to_4.txt -r /home/user/Desktop/oclHashcat-2.01/princeprocessor-master/rules/prince_optimized.rule --keyspace --session=keyspace\nShouldn't it multiply the number of lines in english_and_1_to_4.txt by the number of rules applied in the rule file and give a number?  It only provides the number of lines in english_and_1_to_4.txt.\n. Why should it?  Good question.  Answer: to provide a more accurate number for how many keys/passwords will be tried given the dictionary input and any rules that might be applied.\nThe problem is this. \"cat english_and_1_to_4.txt | wc -l\" gives the same number as this: \"./oclHashcat64.bin -m 2500 RB.hccap english_and_1_to_4.txt -r /home/user/Desktop/oclHashcat-2.01/princeprocessor-master/rules/prince_optimized.rule --keyspace --session=keyspace\"\nThe rules in the rule file aren't accounted for at all, it seems.\nI suppose this has to be done manually.  One of the above commands will do for a line count of the input dictionary file.\nSome command line will give me the other number.\ncat prince_optimized.rule | grep -v ^# | grep -v \"^[[:space:]]*$\" | wc -l\nIt is simple multiplication from there.  line_count_of_dictionary_file * number_of_rules\nAfter reading the FAQ, I notice that the CPU version of hashcat actually does exactly this.  Was that small feature going to make its way over to oclHashcat at some point?  It would be nice.\n. line 2 under hashcat says this:  -a 0 + rules \u2013 number of words in wordlist multiplied by number of rules in rule file\nIt seems hashcat already has it, but oclHashcat does not.\n. Admittedly, I am just going off the entries that are listed in the FAQ that was linked.  I was looking at line 2 for both hashcat and oclHashcat and noticed that difference between hashcat and oclHashcat.  Just going off the FAQ, it seems rules aren't factored in for oclHashcat.  I might go do a diff on the source between the two and see what I can find.\nThanks anyway.\n. ",

Driver is NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run. Bug dows not show up when using https://hashcat.net/files/hashcat-3.6.0.7z. I could corner it a bit more. The error happens if one of the pws gets cracked by the last wordlist and then it switches to the next one.\nThe last remaining hash is weirdly formatted. I can force the error by using this hash+ the default hash from the example page.

I tried to reduce it to a smaller pack (hashes, wordlists,rules) but couldn't reproduce it with it. I can't upload the original hashes do to customer NDAs.  The system is busy now with another set of hashes but I'll try to reproduce it using the original hashes on the weekend. I'll try to recreate the original run (same hashes, same lists, same rules with v3.6.0-479-gb169653 and latest. This will take a few hours. i currently have an unreleated problem that dictionary chaches are not being saved and therefore are created over and over. the wordlists and hashcat are on a local storage on a zfs volume. I see that hashcat.dictstat is being modified after each run. \nAre dictstats always saved in hashcat's working dir, or are they saved in the wordlist directory as well? would nuking the hashcat direcotry and pulling an building it again fix this issues?. could reproduce the original bug after 11 hours =(.\ndoing a 4.0.0-rc1 run now.

    "laginimaineb": "I ran two benchmarks on my computer.\nThe CPU is a Core i5-4670 @ 3.40GHz. The tests were executed on a single core. \nBenchmarking scrypt with N=32768, r=8, p=2..........6 H/s\nBenchmarking the fde_bruteforce.py script..............2 H/s\nAs you can see, the fde_bruteforce is three times slower than just running scrypt, since it runs scrypt three times for each attempt (twice for the KDF, and another time to produce scrypted_intermediate_key from IK3).\nThat means that each 1080 can do about 13 full attempts per second, compared to the 2 done by my Core i5-4670. However, you could parallelise the script to run on all cores, which should give us ~8 attempts per second on the CPU.\nWhat do you think? Do you think it's worth it to continue?\nAlso, if we go ahead, hashcat's support for hooks sounds perfect, since all that's needed is one additional (fast) computation.\n. ",
    "voideater": "Was this ever implemented in hashcat? Working with a phone now and using the Python script @laginimaineb did, but with approx 1 pw/sec I assume this can take more lifetimes than I'd wish it did. 21H/s per CPU would be a quite good upgrade, IMO.. Just experienced this myself running \n./hashcat-4.0.0/hashcat64.bin -m 100 file_with_hashes.txt -a 6 wordlists.txt ?d?d?d?d -O --gpu-temp-retain=65 -o hashes_found.txt\nRunning hashcat-4.0.0-rc2.7z from 02-Oct-2017 13:53 on Ubuntu 16.04 w/ 3x GTX 970 Ti (w/ NVIDIA v384.90)\nWordlist I used was the crackstation.txt (700MB file that can be downloaded from various sources). Haven't been able to pin down for which words it happens, but it occurs near the end of the job every time.\nWordlist is located on the same drive for which I run hashcat from if that should have anything to say.\nUpdate; same scenario using other wordlists as well (same list of hashes but slightly different mask used in the attack).. ",
    "GrepItAll": "I'm also going to bump this; due to the stratification in Android versions that people are running, devices running this generation of fde are still encountered 'in the wild', so having a capability beyond a python script for dealing with these would be beneficial. I can provide additional sample data if required.. Ah ok, looks like 1d04de3 changed the number of kernel loops from 1000 to 250. I will test 4.0.0 with the --scrypt-tmto flag and different workload profiles.. Ok, so using a workload of 4 instead of 3 brings hashcat back up to comparable levels of performance, although it averages out at about 5% slower than under 3.6.0 - I know that this isn't much, but it's such a slow algorithm anyway that that 5% is quite noticeable in the long term.\nI experimented with the --scrypt-tmto setting in both 3.6.0 and 4.0.0 and it did not appear to make a difference to either of them. Does -m 14800 actually make use of this flag? I was under the impression that 14800 uses PBKDF2, not scrypt.. Ok, so I should just use -w 4 then under 4.0.0? If so, I guess this issue can be closed.. Just for reference: #1418 \nNot saying that these are necessarily related, but just be aware that -m 14800 is very slow at the best of times and may not be working as it should be in 4.0.0 anyway. Yeah, I didn't think it would shed much light on it, I was just being optimistic!\nI'll see if I can find time to run those tests properly (it occurred on a 'production' system). No, although key elements are similar. #411 deals with FDE on devices where hardware backed FDE is enabled, but where the hardware keys are leaked out of the processor in the case of Qualcomm devices. 4.4 FDE does not use hardware backing. Both use scrypt however.. You are correct that this PoC code is only for PINs. However, Android 4.4 lockscreens can have a password set instead, which is then used as the basis for the FDE encryption. So whilst most users would have PINs for which this script is sufficiently fast, it is not fast enough to use for passwords which are still frequent enough to cause problems when attempting to recover data from these devices.. Correct, apologies for the ambiguity. I meant that the device password can be non-numeric, whilst the python script will only handle numeric codes.. No, I didn't resolve this. I agree that executing from an arbitrary location doesn't seem to work, but executing from the hashcat root directory does work.. I'll try and validate, but I'm surprised that the output was crackable with FileVault 2. Thanks @jsteube! Excellent work as always. I have some disk images with known passwords that I am looking forward to trying this against.. ",

Yep, it works:\n$ file hashcat\nhashcat: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (FreeBSD), dynamically linked, interpreter /libexec/ld-elf.so.1, for FreeBSD 12.0 (1200019), FreeBSD-style, stripped\n$ ldd hashcat\nhashcat:\n    libhashcat.so => ./libhashcat.so (0x800827000)\n    libthr.so.3 => /lib/libthr.so.3 (0x800b07000)\n    libc.so.7 => /lib/libc.so.7 (0x800d2e000).

    "vom513": "hashcat-potfile-example.txt\n. Yes, seems to (really) work as expected now - tested with v3.00-47-gbaea682.  I put my original oclHashcat.pot in place (~ 200k lines, multiple algos/hashes) and it did fine parsing that as well.\nThanks so much for looking at this so quickly.\n. Same hccap.  Essentially the crack can run up to two times for the same \"hash\".  The ordering of the AP and client MACs seem to make it think they are unique hashes, hence the second run.\n. I see the changelog entry for 3.00.  It could be that I still have some entries in my potfile(s) that have the 'old' ordering, therefore it's not matched on the new (stable) logic in 3.00.\nI've just manually edited my potfile to remove all the entries for my test network and recracked it.  After this I've ran hashcat many times against it and it seems to reliably match from the potfile and not recrack.  Looks like the fix was in 3.00 and my potfiles just have 'old' entries.  Sorry for the noise.\n. ",
    "AresS31": "Thanks for this reply @philsmd! \nCould I know why this choice of mask? It would be I think more logical to use ?a for the default mask to simulate a \"pure\" bruteforce attack using the default hashcat behavior.\nTherefore, as a code request for what I judge to be an improvement. I would suggest to change the mask to ?a for the default behavior.\nBest,\nAlexandre\n. I am happy with this explanation. Thanks for your time!\n. Exactly!\n. I personally think that it might be a \"good\" extra information to print out. It is up to you at the end. :)\n. Thanks :)\n. Understood! :)\nAn other question in the same line. Why not having only one hybrid attack mode instead of two (-a 6 and -a 7). The relative position of the mask to the wordlist should be easy to parse, isn't? \nFor example using\nhashcat -a hybrid_attack_id hashes.txt wordlist maskwould result in wordlist+mask\nand\nhashcat -a hybrid_attack_id hashes.txt mask wordlistwould result in mask+wordlist\n. > it's possible to specify a directory instead of several files (also for -a 6 and -a 7).\n@philsmd I have tried to give a directory instead of wordlists files and it did not work. \n. Same issue for me with a RS256 JWT token, I keep getting the \"Token length exception\".. Well, I don't really know the underlying code for this feature but that would basically be taking what is coming from STDIN as the wordlist rather than a text file. I think this could be a very useful feature and simplify quick cracking attempts.. ",

Seems I need to somehow add additional parser in mpsp.c and change status_ctx->words_off and \nstatus_ctx->words_base when the job is starting.\n. Pull request:\nhttps://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/574\n. @magnumripper because it's easier to use '|' than ',' , so I won't have to write code to figure out whether that part is a custom charset or mask or skip/limit number, or touch the mask parsing logic.\n. \"For example, this would not work to set -s and -l for a folder full of wordlists, which hashcat supports and which is also an iterated attack.\"\nWhich attack mode is this? can you elaborate?\n. Well, the delimiter '|' can't be escaped, therefore it can't be used in any inline charsets or masks. Although '|' is very rarely used anywhere, which is the reason why use it as the delimiter.\n. Without this feature, hashcat can only distribute the workload one mask at a time, if the hash file is large, it takes a long time to restart because it has to reload the hash file into memory and map them  again.  By pre-calculating keyspaces and ECDs of all masks in a mask file before hand, we can divide heavier masks into smaller workloads and generate mask files with equal workload mask files  then assign these files to the worker nodes. We can also tailor workloads to different sizes to suit worker nodes that have different performance.\n. ",

As you see, the version number now is parsed from the nearest tag from git and the version number v3.00 in CMakeLists.txt is just a fallback.\nMerge conflicts are not solved automatically (in theory they could be solved completely automatically, but it would require some advanced tools merging ASTs and keeping history of coder's actions in IDE) because a lot of code is changed and put into another files. To merge you need to solve conflict by simply picking my versions.\n\nIs it possible to make this without using cmake?\n\nBoth yes and no. Yes because you can pregenerate files with cmake. No because cmake gens system-specific files without flexibility in them.

You see the code, but in fact it is another code. Please, don't use them except the case of extreme need. I have replaced macros with enums and inlines to be sure that the compilation errors I was getting were not caused by them.\n\nWhy did you add type naming after: typedef struct XXXX_t_ { ... } XXXX_t; ? Anonymous structs are fine aren't them?\n\nThey are fine, but Visual Studio writes the struct type in tooltips, not the typedef one, which looks not fine if the structs are anonymous.\n\nThe filenames have no real convention, for example: ext_OpenCL.h <- original, filenames_generators <- new type 1, hc_concurrency.h <- new type 2. So the question is, why having hc_* in front for some and for others not?\n\nBecause some symbols in them have hc_ prefix :)  In fact developing naming convention is not my target for now, the primary target is to make it be built without errors with msvc, gcc, g++ and clang.\n. > The idea seems nice, however there also some problem with it.

We'd need to rewrite it in a way so that it is able to handle the new folder structure. \n\nThe makefile is to be replaced with cmake script, which uses globbing to get list of all c and h files in the project.\n. > What is BASETSD_H ?\n\nIs BASETSD_H a pre-existing macro from vc or set from Makefile?\n\nA macro defined in a header supplied with compiler where the types you define are defined. Don't know if it exists in gcc and clang, but in VS it is.\n. > we can no longer inline it.\nThat's sad. There are dedicated instructions for this in cpus, so those header is just compiler abstraction layer, they are really meant to be inlined. In later commit I've implemented them as compiler intrinsics (which means their calls would be converted into a single instruction, and they really are, as disasm says).\n. > The use of them is not time intensive, so it's fine\nIt's true, but it is ugly. We still need headers, so I see no reason to move the implementations to a separate binary library. BTW, why do we keep cpu implementations of algorithms at all? GPUs perform much better for computations and there are opencl runtimes for cpus for the cases we need to do the operation on a cpu (and we don't need to optimize those kernels for cpus because as you mentioned performance is not critical in that case)?\n. OK\n. How is the progress?\n. OK.\n. The advantages:\n- capabitity design patterns, for example it can be possible to encapsulate cryptoalgorithms into classes and deal with them in a more uniform way (you can also do it in C putting the base object as the first field and casting the pointer)\n- c++ idioms like raii\n- c++ cross-platform standard library for dealing with threads, time and randomness\n- more strict type checking, elimination of macroses in favour of templates\n- computing tables of coefficients in compile time without storing them as they are in the source code.\nThe disadvantages:\n- imcompatibility with C\n- no standardized ABI for object oriented code which means  one doesn't simply link OO code from the libraries built with another compiler. Not a very big issue.\n- the standard library tools lack some features used like setting affinity\nSince C++ includes frequently used subset of C, I see no reason not to make some minor changes and start to use C++ right now.\n. > C is simpler and easier to read.\n... when used for simple hello-world-level programs.\n\n\"Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity\"\n\n\n\n-Don't multiply entities, b1tch! Don't multiply!\n-OK, Occam, just move the razor away!\n\nIn this case it seems to be necessary because hc is much more complex than helloworld.\n. hashcat is not linux kernel and Linuse's statement was about c++03.\n. > it can be possible to encapsulate cryptoalgorithms into classes and deal with them in a more uniform way\n. Rust can be good, but it is a bit too complicated and hard-to-use. C++ is compatible with c which makes transition easy. So I think it'd be better migrate it to C++ first, reengineer, and then rewrite into rust if it worth it.\n. I still find no good reason to stay on an old language without built-in virtual functions, inheritance and backward compatible with the old one in some large subset.. No problem specific to hc. All the apps in C I saw have the same problems: the code is bloated with pointers (solved by the convention that this is the default pointer and inheritance, allowing to call access the inherited objects without this), macros (often can be solved by templates usage), resources allocation/freeing (raii) and copypasting the code (solved by inheritance and virtual functions). C++ is mainly just a syntax sugar for the things which can be (and often are) done manually in C , a bit more strict type checking and the c++ standard library.\nD can be even better, but it it doesn't have enough good tools and features. Python also can be used (and is used in pyrit) since the main work is done in opencl code, but there is a drawback that you need a python interpreter/jit-compiler. It is nearly always present on linux desktop systems, but nearly never in windows ones.. OK. > Some of those \"if/else\" ladders which you have rewritten to use switch(). I like the way it is and sometimes using switch() makes it harder to read.\n\nI prefer it the original way, it's much easier to read\nI don't think so, but you to decide. One of main purposes purpose of these to make it be build with VS. In fact we don't even need the ladders/switches because the better approach is to populate container with objects/function pointers and select the function by offset.\nMoving code into subfolders make the Makefile unneccary complicated\n\nNot moving makes directory content hard-to navigate. And I don't see much complication in it. Anyway, my cmake script did the globbing.\n\nNot sure why we should move this into a separate file.\n\nWhy not? Large files slow down IDEs.\n\n7fb6fce\n6deede5\n2f4dfdc\n\nand\n\n12e9365\nNot merged.\nDon't see a reason to do that.\nMakes it harder to read. Are there any technical advantages?\n\nType safety and \"source-code safety\" (I mean that if you see the code you can expect that it is actual code, and if you see it valid, it's valid, and if you encounter a compilation error you can investigate the cause without dumping preprocessed output, and if you debug, you see the code corresponding to binary not tampered with macros) are always an advantage. Macros must be eliminated everywhere it is possible because they make the project unmanageable.\n\nIs it because it's better not to use & inside a function macro?\n\nSince C has no references we have to use pointers to replace macros with inlines. The addresses of operands are not params for macros - they are params for inline functions (in the hope the compiler would optimize them out (VS does this and in release we have a long sequence of instructions without calls)). After migration to C++ it would be possible to replace pointers with refs (which are just syntax sugar for pointers) and remove ampersand operators.\nAnother problem is that I see that some defines in your code I've turned into consts/enums/inlines.\n\n239dd7e\n4db2492\n4b4f7ac\nNot merged.\nI don't see any disadvantages.\n\ntheoretically using include guards instead of pragmas slowes the compilation: the preprocessor have to load a file and process it instead of checking its internal associative container to determine if the file was already used. We have to solve problem with pragmas on Mac. If you possess one you can try adding pragmas one by one to determine the troubleful header.\n\nThis section has been taken of from original ADL headers from AMD. I don't think we should change anything to them directly. Can we do this indirectly?\nThis section has been taken of from original NVML headers from Nvidia. I don't think we should change anything to them directly.\n\nWe should decide how do we use the headers: as black boxes or as white ones. If we use them as black boxes we don't touch them at all and even don't have them in repo by itself, using submodules and make system (first check predefined paths, if not present - using submodules). If we use them as white boxes we are free to modify them.\nAnother issue is manual libraries loading. We should consider not to load libraries manually but to rely on compiler/linker delay load feature. GCC and VS have it.\n\n31f45ac\nebea5c5\n796bb05\n693649f\nb6d20be\n210ddd0\nNot merged (yet).\nWill do this (typing) when refactoring is completely finished\n\nOK.

It's hard to navigate and more importantly large files cause problems to some compilers and IDEs (I mean Visual Studio) because the standard doesn't require it. For example in interface.c we hit the limitation of nestedness (see C1061 for example).\n. > However, if you send a PR with only very basic cmake that works without any changes to the current structure and if I get a good understanding about how it works I may change to cmake.\nUsing cmake requires at least config file. It doesn't strictly requires it, you can add the preprocessor into command line, but this will be shit.\nIn fact you can use the cmake script I have already provided because there is no hardcoded paths to files except templates and results. It's very basic, it doesn't even include packaging. But it is not enough to make hashcat to be built with VS : some code changes you made are imcompatible. Another concern is compiler flags, I haven't succeeded in setting them. In any case the provided cmake script should be enough to generate makefiles for officially supported toolchaihs. .travis file is broken, there are some errors in them. In any case I'm not going to fix anything untill someone solved the problems with the files violating c++ standard which make succesful build using VS impossible.\n. The problem is in interface.c where there are lot of else if ladders causing great nesting.\nC++ standard, Annex B says\n\n\u2014 Nesting levels of compound statements, iteration control structures, and selection control structures [256]\n\nBut in VS they use 128 as limit.\nAnd I'm sorry, I was wrong claiming that some files violated the standard because\n\nthese quantities are only guidelines and do not determine compliance.\n\n, so (according to the standard) it's OK to have deep nesting and small nesting limits.\nThe fact that the code complying with the standard cannot be compiled by any compiler complying with the standard means we don't have the standard at all. :(\n. Feel free to close this issue, the most commits are already merged or wontfixed. I'll start a new issue if we have missed something. \n. 1 It is not crossplatform. I mean if you need make you will have to install a gnu toolchain either mingw or cygwin. Because make is not feature-rich, makefiles are often augmented with bash, which means most likely you will have to install cygwin and gnu utils. Cygwin is large and its installation is pain because it installs packages one by one.\ncmake is only ~40 Mib (unpacked) and doesn't need cli gnu tools to build the project if used in a right way. The right way is not to rely on bash or python (if python is strict requirement of your app, you can use scons) :)\n2 it is not good if you support many toolchains with different command lines. I mean that you'll have to write code creating buildng and linking command line by hand for every compiler and platform supported. cmake does this automatically (in fact not cmake itself, but the code in cmake language shipped with cmake, uts stdlib): you just declare the project files paths and cmake generates the files you need to build the project with the selected toolchain. Unfortunatily you will have to set some parameters like /nxcompat by hand because cmake dev's haven't developed this functionality yet.\n. 1 gnu toolchain and other gnu tools are missing. there are exist some native windows tools not requiring cygwin, but they are really ancient. To have bash you need cygwin and it is glitchy if you have non-ascii characters in path.\n. 2 cmake is shipped with scripts creating projects files for different ides and toolchains.. >I was under the impression cmake is required to build hashcat from VS, but it seems that's not the case.\nIt was not required, in fact, it was just an easiest way to make it build crossplatform crosstoolchain without messing with cygwin and bash. Since I don't use VS anymore (I have migrated to linux, but haven't managed to make VS to work on it (yet) ) VS support is not critical for me for now. cmake support is still will be helpful, because it is the project format used by qtcreator.\n. > Please explain, what is that BEX error and which effects does it have?\n\nBEX refers to Buffer Overflow Exception.\nhttps://support.solarwinds.com/Success_Center/Log_Event_Manager_(LEM)/Buffer_overflow_exception_(BEX)error_from_Reports_Console_due_to_Data_Execution_Prevention(DEP)\n\nIt is often triggered by an attempt to execute the code on a page marked as NoneXecutable. In any case when I've built hc with VS (after my modifications) the problem either disappeared or hid.\nI've checked your binary with PE format inspector (PeStudio) and found that it is imcompatible with dep and aslr (I have them forced enabled for all the processes). You may need try to mess with compiler and linker flags.\n. > Sounds like some mingw issue and not sure which compiler and linker\n\nflags you mean. Also, how did you notice this? hashcat runs normally on\nmy Windows 7.\n\nAgain, I have DEP force-enabled  for all the processes, even for those not explicitly marked as dep-enabled. It doesn't cause issues in most cases. In the case of hc from the website it did. You can try to solve it by adding -Wl --nxcompat --dynamicbase into the command line (I don't know which command line exactly).\n. Sorry, it is not clear how I can download it. On the website I see only August version and the listing of binaries directory (https://hashcat.net/files/) is disabled.\n. Sorry, I was without inet for some time. It doesn't. PEStudio showed the flags (dep and aslr) had appeared, but it still crashes, though with another error (exception code 80000003). \n. I use Windows 8.1. Is it forced? Do you have EMET?. I don't know. I don't have Windows on my PC anymore..

Large files slow down IDEs.\nI rarely come across files like this with my editor of choice(Atom) but when I was navigating interface.c it definitely started to have a noticeable impact and I had to switch to a different text editor to avoid that.\n\nIf you're IDE can't handle large files it's not a problem of the project, it's a problem of the IDE. I don't use any IDE btw.\n\nWhile I'd agree, it does discourage contributions somewhat by affected users. I think I've opened other files in the project that were also large enough to cause the problems, from what I read here the refactor has addressed it.\n. I've ported it to Rust as a learning exercise, you can see a working version in browser here.\nIn doing so, I've found the algorithm produces the first hash value in examples I gave, so endianess had to be swapped, I also discovered the community version in C# modified it a bit by adding a loop to the remaining 23 bytes. I've implemented that to get the same results but it'd be non-standard for the algorithm I'm asking for inclusion.\nI'd still like to use hashcat with the modified algorithm so if there is any information on how I can add it to have my GPU utilize it that would be super helpful.\n. I'm attempting to get this working in Hashcat referencing the RAR5 commit and comparing against other algorithm files/settings. I'm figuring out what a bit of it means but struggling to figure out various other properties that are either Hashcat/Cracking/OpenCL specific(rather new to it all). \nI've got the algorithm ported over to OpenCL I think, but not sure how to go about testing it, it isn't clear how much additional code like in the RAR5 commit I need to add to do so as the flow is not clear to a new comer.\n. I'm able to hardcode the comparison value in my .cl file to that of the hash input stored in digest in the parse_hash method. I split a 64bit hex string to 2 u32 values(digest size 4_2?) with hex_string_to_u32(). I tried a digest size of 8_8(smallest u64/64-bit size?) but working with a u64 value instead of two u32 seems to require more work(COMPARE_M/S for example).\nDebugging the file with an nvidia card doesn't seem like I have much options? I can't use printf(), I thought maybe I could treat the comparison as a success and return/store some value in C file or terminal, no luck. I'm not sure how to work with my dict/key values, are the strings being converted into byte arrays? I see pws[gid].pw_len; and pws[gid].i[0]; used in other files assuming that's it?\nOnce I can match the input string to the hash I think I can make more progress, I've got everything working besides the .cl file now.\n. Created a thread on the forum.\nNo further progress so far with the trial and error of the .cl file. If anyone has the spare time to put together a basic example of the .cl file(I've got the rest covered I think, MSQL323 seems a better reference?) for a simple hash like FNV-1a 32-bit, that'd be super helpful.\nIt should look something like this I think, I'm just not familiar with the rest of the OpenCL that all the hash mode files use to integrate it:\n```\nu32 fnv1a32(char data) {\n    u32 hash = 2166136261;\n    for byte in data {\n        hash ^= byte;\n        hash *= 16777619;\n    }\nreturn hash;\n\n}\n```\nThe string \"hello\" should output a hash of \"4f9f2cab\".\n. @jsteube Yes, wikipedia, generator.\nIt's not the algorithm I'm trying to implement, which is larger. I chose this one as it's very simple and would make understanding the process of implement an algorithm showing the basics. \nThe developer could then expand from the base example with their more complicated logic, optimizations and additions like working with salts for their own algorithms.\n. Figured out why I was getting Exhausted for the status but 100% recovery and no key paired to the hash. My hardcoded test was of course providing a perfect match as soon as it was hit, I thought this would be the first word but I'm guessing it was run before the first word in my dictionary was used?\nAfter sussing that out, I was able to get cracked status with the intended hash:key match by filtering the hard coded compare to only happen when the first 4 bytes(\"hell\") was available. I had originally assumed I was getting each string character separately not 4 at a time, after Atom cleared that up it made it much easier :)\nImplemented the FNV1a32 algorithm above, initially with a hard coded byte array then modified it to work with how Hashcat was providing the string data, implemented bitshifts and when thinking about how to handle the <4 end of the string I noticed my approach was quite similar to the MySQL323 algorithm I was referencing, all of the sudden what was going on clicked and I could make sense of all that was going on in that function :P A good amount of it was to handle 3/2/1 bytes in the u32 value and the rest optimizations like avoiding lookups by copying the data into new variables.\nSome variable names I still don't get or understand why bother with larger array sizes than needed with unused indices being set to 0. Does it help performance in some way?\nOnce I've got my intended algorithm working I'll look at contributing some documention for new users wanting to implement new algorithms using the FNV1a32 as a basic example. It should clear up alot of the confusions I came across so someone else doesn't spend several days trying to figure it out :P\n.

So the algorithm is fine, I've swapped my .cl(kernel?) for that of m00200_a3.cl(with 00200 replaced with my hash mode value)  and tested the key/hash and any mask works fine.... so surely I'm doing something wrong with my a3 kernel?\nOnly seems to trip up with the first mask value for some reason, it's a stripped down m00200_a3.cl.\n. Solved it after piecing all the defined code at the top into the one method, the value I initiate my hash with was before the main for loop, turns out it needs to be inside it.\nPRE to POST\n```\n  for (u32 il_pos = 0; il_pos < il_cnt; il_pos += VECT_SIZE)\n  {\n    const u32x w0r = words_buf_r[il_pos / VECT_SIZE];\nconst u32x w0 = w0l | w0r;\n\n// Only need these two lines to handle FNV1a32 on a single digit\nu32x hash = 2166136261;\nhash ^= w0 & 0xff; hash *= 16777619;\n\nu32x z = 0;\nCOMPARE_S_SIMD (hash, z, z, z);\n\n}\n```\nNot quite sure how that loop works if it's dependant on the first character of the key to be specified but allows masks for the rest. Initiating the hash inside the loop is the solution though.\n- What is il? \n- Is cnt count? \n- Does the r/l in w0r/w0l mean right/left?\n- What is the difference between u32x to u32?\nI don't need to know them since I can get the code working, but if there is any value in terms or knowing what the variables are it'd be good to note down :)\n. @jsteube thanks for all that :) I've got my hash algorithm working great at 19 GH/s for a 5 char string, it gets progressively slower the longer the string(15 chars 500MH/s). With the longer strings a good portion is an already known prefix before any mask is used.\nDoes hashcat provide some method to cache calculations based on string of chars? password?d?d for example, it would be a waste to do all the processing on the prefix of the key every time when it could just be done once then using a datastructure like a trie iterate through the string until it doesn't reached a cached result. p -> a -> s -> s -> w -> o -> r -> d -> ? would return the cached value up til d(or a digit if it's already processed that as well), when the prefix password changes to say secret the first character s has no cache hit so it'll start processing from there, 2nd time around it'll have the previous processed word in the cache.\nI'm unfamiliar with openCL, how portable is a C implementation of trie data structure?\n. I don't need to brute force an entire length of 30, I've done this with 9 mask characters and the rest static(56 in length), took a few minutes. I'd like to generate the prefix rather than manually input it. The prefix could be built from a preprocessor extracting out the known directory paths into a wordlist, or a rule attack(?) using some words to form common string patterns(eg ene_[enemy unit name]_?d or `level_[really long level name]stage?d[something else]).\nWith one of the examples I provided in the 1st post units/payday2/characters/ene_bulldozer_1/ene_bulldozer_1 plenty of that only needs to be calculated once. The algorithm iterates through the string(with hashcat, I've changed it to work on up to 4 characters at a time) to form the hash, so it's calculation time grows as the length of the string does, otherwise it's pretty fast. I don't think I can precompute the end of the password without having processed what came before it, but storing what I process in memory as a cache sounds feasible?\n\nThe best way to deal with it would be to generate the innerloop part for the end of the password, not the beginning. In such a scenario you could simply precompute the prefix before entering the inner loop and get full speed, regardless of the length.\n\nI might have misunderstood what you were saying here. I thought I don't have access to the key/password string until the inner loop(and for some reason have to start with w0 as w[0] doesn't appear to be what I expect, then start from w[1] and up). I'm only working on m99000s for a3 right now, would the outer loop still be in this method or is that the s04/s08/s16 methods that call it? I know s is for single hash comparison where I supply the hash in terminal, and m is for multiple from a dictionary, but besides the different allocations to w[] the numbered variants still aren't clear to me what use they are so I haven't touched them.\nDone a little optimization, was able to remove a while-loop/switch/conditional(tried a few variants) as well as just referencing w[i] instead of storing it in another var seemed to help boost performance for 5 chars to 33 GH/s. 15 chars is 560 MH/s now.\n. Sure, I've not written extensive notes, but I can provide the basic example and comment on what's going on along with a markdown file to describe the process/flow. I found out FNV1a32 tends to get hash collisions a bit where it'd crack the hash with a key that wasn't the expected one. I will also push a branch on my fork with the algorithm I'm working on at the moment.\n. I've got a rough version of my .cl file here(note to self hastebin is not reliable for this sort of thing), it's only the inner loop linked atm, can supply the full file text if it's helpful. Whereabouts is the outerloop, is it in m99000s before CODE_PRE's inner loop? or is it the s04/s08/s16 methods? You can see that it's an algorithm that iterates through the given input and could be paused/resumed by storing/retrieving the a/b/c values which I'd like to cache or precompute prefixes from wordlists before the mask/rule generation.\nlookup8.c example on repl.it, good news is I was wrong about my first impression of this being a variant/modifed version, it was just due to language differences or the C# author I guess and I assumed the output was different. They produce the same result so it might be a worthwhile contribution to hashcat community after all :)\n. @jsteube Well I feel stupid now ha, I assumed the performance degradation was my logic and spent all this time to optimize it and it turns out if I make the whole m99000s method empty I still get the performance drop. 15 char length is getting 647 MH/s with no logic for the method.\nIs it a performance problem with Hashcat somewhere generating the strings or is the string too large for the GPU and it's being handled differently?\nCommand that I was using:\nhashcat -a 3 -m 99000 'a0850878201803bd' ene_?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?lr_1 --potfile-disable\n. I think I understand it now, the parallelization branches off from the first 4 characters in some way? Where as I thought Hashcat generated enough strings from the first ?l and sent all those off to be processed by the GPU as if there was no difference from where the key branched off at.\nSo to clarify, from what I can tell on my GPU(GTX 1070) it seems with minimal logic I can get around 600MH/s  per....thread/core? And that by parallelizing from the initial 4 chars it seems I can achieve 64x that rate(I'm not sure why it's 64, is that a Hashcat thing or specific to my GPU specs?), that seems to be a bottleneck max rate as I can achieve it without the first 4 chars all being masked values. Does digest size have any impact on this?\n@jsteube If I understood the parallelization correctly, your work around with salt makes sense. Is it possible to have a precompute stage of 8k prefixes(copy/pasted) where I store the values in an array and my m99000s method could loop through each preprocessed prefix in the array for each generated string that the masks provides?( eg `?l?l?l?l?l?l?l - length 8 paired with each prefix in the inner loop?). According to a similar keyspace at 33 GH/s, looks like it'd take about 20 hours or less (against a single hash, not sure how much of an impact comparing against 4k hashes has).\n. Here is some output with my logic being running through instead of an empty function.

Thanks for the explanation, I'm still having trouble understanding what you're saying though. Why does the same length have such a big difference if using a pure mask vs mask with some static string data?\n\nWithout a fixed w[0] the innerloop has nothing to iterate through\n\nThis is the first 4 chars right? When you say fixed what do you mean? Isn't the example with pass as the prefix static/fixed? Yet it seems considerably slower than replacing the letters with ?l. ?l?l?l?l?l?l?lpassfinishes straight away at 32 GH/s but pass?l?l?l?l?l?l?l which you'd think would have much less to compute takes 13 secs at <600 MH/s.. Am I better in some cases to always start my mask attack with first 4 chars as mask values? \nI'm not quite sure how parralelization is occuring, from the sounds of it, it seems starting the key with L the GPU can only operate on a single sequence at a time vs ?l where it can do parraelize 26? and presumably each of those 26 again if the next char is mask ?l?\n\nThere's no discussion needed about this behavior. It's a well known limitation and there's also a standard workaround\n\nWhere is this documented? There was no mention of this problem or work around on the Mask Attack wiki page from memory.\n\nThe best workaround is to have a prefix added to the hash as a salt.\n\nI don't know if this will be too viable, I have about 4k+ hashes and 8k+ file paths, that'd mean appending the salt 8k times per hash right? Are the other attacks where I can preprend the file path vulnerable to this performance problem too? \nI'm thinking my best option right now is to preprocess the paths and copy/paste their data into a prefix array before the inner loop and then loop through that array for each key generated by the mask.\n. Probably not an option, but is JIT compiling kernels perhaps with a template language if you want to have a variable salt that becomes static during compilation at runtime an option? ArrayFire does JIT compiling for it's kernels from memory.\n. ",

I believe the issue is simply SLI being enabled.\n. Fixed in rc6. Fixed in latest, thanks.. Working as expected, thanks.. This would be pretty easy cut/paste addition using hash mode -m 2811 md5(md5($salt).md5(pass)), would it not? Just some swapping around and then adding it to the mode selection.. Fixed, Thanks!. To add some more details and confirm this issue, using --keyspace with a custom character set, such as in the command shown above, will cause hashcat to not recognize that a mask has been set for some reason, whereas using a mask that doesn't include a custom character set works just fine. Custom character sets work in attacks, it's only when trying to use --keyspace that they fail, giving the error shown on the second line above. The same command as above does work in 3.30, so i believe the intended behavior is for it to work in 3.40 as well.. These questions seem better suited for the hashcat forums( https://hashcat.net/forum/index.php ) than for the issue tracker. You will likely have better luck asking there.. I like that idea better @roycewilliams  \ud83d\udc4d . I dont think it should be a configurable option, thats a bit too much. Simply compressing near the middle of the hash using an ellipsis to keep it within 1 terminal line would be fine in my opinion.. Looks good, thanks!. I personally feel that the status should be on stderr so that pipes can be used to handle cracked hashes and other output on stdout. This would remove the need to add a new flag just for /dev/null and would open things up a bit more for people to pipe cracks into other applications to handle them before going to a file.. Sorry, I had noticed CT and Mac were swapped in your script and forgot to update the examples. They we're generated with my original script, which is no longer the correct format.. @ethtester from what I can find regarding MIST wallets, the keystore seemingly shares the same format as Geth wallets and therefore both this algorithm as well as my extract script should work on MIST wallets as well. If you have a MIST wallet on hand that I could look at that would be helpful as I do not have one and can't seem to confirm 100% what the format of the JSON is and if it's compatible with ether2hashcat.. @kholia I was simply following the format of other extracted hashes however I do agree with the change. I will edit my extract script and both issues to reflect the corrected format.\n@ethtester those wallets look directly compatible as they follow the same format.. @kholia awesome, would you like me to push yours as the main extract script instead of https://github.com/Chick3nman/ether2hashcat.py/blob/master/ether2hashcat.py ? Mine is a lot less clean than yours, plus no error handling.. Perfect, I'll edit both issues to refer to your script and will use it as the extract script from now on. @ethtester Correct, hashcat will need to have the modes written and added to use them, this is simply a request to have them added.. @ethtester the developers are quite busy right now dealing with other, more important things. If no one from the community steps in to add this, it could be a few weeks before anyone can get to them. For now, @kholia's addition to JTR has been merged here: https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/pull/2525. @solardiz It's possible @atom was talking about JTR's implementation of the Ethereum Scrypt mode and not the Scrypt portion alone. That's how I interpreted it at least.. I now follow @kholia's extraction script as the master, hence the message that ether2hashcat was deprecated and replaced, so hashcat should follow his formats for scrypt/pbkdf2/presale. I had noticed the difference in our scripts and i believe there was a forum post that pointed it out as well, however I was not aware that hashcat parsed it under my old format. The OP on this thread was changed to follow @kholia's format directly after his script superseded mine. . I'm guessing your wallet uses the incredibly high 262144 settings? That scrypt setting is beyond the capability of most GPUs currently(by design), and if your CPU is running out of resources, its due to a lack of enough system RAM.. Interesting, that does seem like an issue with the shell and not hashcat. I'll play with surrounding things in quotes and escaping things to see if i can come up with something that works.. Huh, that's weird. I guess it's just something we'll need to work around during usage. I'll go ahead and close this as it's not a hashcat issue however I do think it could use some visibility so that others arent confused when they run across it. It caught me completely by surprise when testing a list earlier.. Can you give me a quick summary of the issue? I'm trying to read through that thread but it's quite long. It sounds like return characters were incorrectly considered during the KDF portion instead of being stripped, which caused wallets that implement the KDF correctly to fail to decrypt due to the lack of the return characters? If so, it should be trivial to apply those characters using a rule or a hex wordlist with those characters applied to the ends of the plaintexts.. --gpu-temp-disable        |      | Disable temperature and fanspeed reads and triggers  |\n     --gpu-temp-abort          | Num  | Abort if GPU temperature reaches X degrees Celsius   | --gpu-temp-abort=100\n     --gpu-temp-retain         | Num  | Try to retain GPU temperature at X degrees Celsius   | --gpu-temp-retain=95. You can't add flags to a restored session without modifying the restore file. Modifying the restore file is risky as well but there are some tutorials online how to do it if you look around. If you ask on the forums, there are more people that can help with the issue.. You can simply restart the attack to change the settings, taking note of where you left off and using --skip and --limit to start roughly where you left off and not go over the same work twice.. I was under the same assumption @jsteube , i thought hashcat was failing to crack the proper format, which is $ethereum$s*n*r*p*salt*ciphertext*mac. It seems both hashcat and JTR are aligned and following the correct format. The old format, $ethereum$s*n*r*p*salt*mac*ciphertext, was deprecated when @kholia built his script for john, and should NOT be used. Hashcat failing to crack the deprecated format is proper behaviour, there is no issue here.. The more VRAM you have, the more hashes you can fit into one run without having any issues. Myspace(~360m) fits into the VRAM on a Titan-X but not into the VRAM on a 1080. If artificially capped in a non-dynamic way, then anyone with Titan's would be limited for no reason.. It's possible all the target hashes fit but no recovered hash:plain pairs have room? I dont understand it at a low enough level to really tell.. So...chained SHA256 to try and derive the \"Hash of the day\" likely from a gambling site? Probably shouldn't be doing that.. Please take this question and others like it to the forums. The candidates displayed are the selection of current work, from point A - point Z. If the GPU can do 1 candidate at a time, it will load up a chunk of work, such as A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I and display A-I while it process through them 1 at a time. It will not update the chunk of work until it finishes. If it loads a chunk such as A-I and has only made it to candidate G when the status is printed, it will still display A-I.. You can already reference a wordlist on a different/networked drive. As long as hashcat has a clear path to the wordlist, it will work. Protocols like HTTP are likely not going to be supported and the speed of read/access would be terrible anyways.. You are receiving these errors because you are trying to run hashcat on a laptop where nvmlDeviceGetPowerManagementLimit() and nvmlDeviceGetFanSpeed() are not supported. Solution is basically don't run hashcat on a laptop.. This is not a hashcat problem, your hardware is simply not adequate for cracking Scrypt with such high settings. Please take this discussion to the forums instead of github. Thanks :). Lets take a look at this thread for a bit and maybe it will clear a few things up.\nhttps://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7170.html\nTL;DR It does not seem like the SSG is usable in that way according to its documentation.\n  . They don't understand how the SSG works then. The NVME drive(s) on the GPU are connected via the new HBCC(High Bandwidth Cache Controller) and act as a local file store for caching files that would normally be read from the host system storage, NOT as addressable mapped memory space. \nhttps://muropaketti.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/amd-capsaicin-radeon-pro-ssg-diagram-20160726.jpg\nAs you can see, the GPU Memory(VRAM) is separate from the NVME storage/cache.\nAnd from the thread I linked above:\nhttp://www.tomshardware.co.uk/amd-radeon-pro-ssg,news-53609.html\n\"AMD indicated that it is not using the NAND pool as a memory-mapped space currently...\"\n\"The current implementation merely uses the SSD as a storage volume for frequently-accessed data...\". From the article you linked:\n\"SSG would not replace graphics RAM itself, such as GDDR5+ or HBM or HBM2, as it would be too slow.\"\n\"When the GPU wants more work, it has to signal the CPU, which then fetches data from the larger pool of local system RAM or primary storage.\"\nIt's acting as a next step down from the VRAM, not as part of the local VRAM. Just like how Intel Optane is not RAM, it's simply a high speed cache that sits above the disks but below the system RAM. This is for when the GPU is done crunching its current work chunk and is going to get the next chunk of work from the disk. This does NOT allow you to increase the size of each work chunk beyond the size of the local HBM2 VRAM, it just lets you switch to the next chunk faster, increasing overall throughput. There seems to be some serious confusion here around the word \"Memory\". For the use case of acting as a Frame Buffer, the SSG will do very very well because it can load to/from the onboard SSD RAID very very quickly. But for our use case, we arent offloading a ton of file read/writes to a local cache. We are initializing a huge lookup table of random bit strings.\n\"The large memory requirements of scrypt come from a large vector of pseudorandom bit strings that are generated as part of the algorithm. Once the vector is generated, the elements of it are accessed in a pseudo-random order and combined to produce the derived key. A straightforward implementation would need to keep the entire vector in RAM so that it can be accessed as needed.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt\nIf we could split this RAM usage up magically into several pieces, some of which would go into the VRAM and the rest into system RAM/Disk efficiently, then the SSG would make sense. But we aren't doing that because doing so is NOT efficient.\nAgain, even if we wanted to get fancy with this and try to do that, the current SSG implementation does NOT allow you to do what you think it does, so we couldn't do it regardless.\n\"http://pro.radeon.com/_downloads/SSG_API_User_Manual%20v1.01.pdf\nPretty clear from the API documentation that the OpenCL extensions added are solely for file operations. And even if the API did have functions to use the onboard storage as VRAM (which, again, it does not), those functions would have to actually be implemented within Hashcat to make use of them, which would be a significant undertaking for a device that surely no one would use for password cracking. It wouldn't just magically work, and we would not be willing to invest the level of effort required to make it work. But again, it does not exist, so this is a non-issue. \"\nFrom the thread on the Hashcat forums that I linked earlier.\n. It is currently not possible due to how the scrypt lookup table is being stored. If we found a way to write it into chunks and started storing internal states to the disk/sysRAM/etc. to get around the maximum VRAM limitation, it would very likely slow the whole process down even further. It would not make it more efficient. Scrypt is a Memory-Hardened algorithm and is very GPU resistant. It is designed specifically to make sure you can't do that efficiently. The ENTIRE lookup table needs to be accessible during computation since you need to look through following a pseudo-random order. Doing it in pieces would likely take more time loading/unloading than simply doing less of it concurrently but keeping the entire concurrent tables in the VRAM.. GPUs can do it now, just not well due to the limitations of their VRAM. Which is EXACTLY what SCrypt was designed to accomplish. It's high memory usage makes GPUs and other accelerated parallel processors require huge amounts of memory so that they arent faster/more efficient at cracking it. That was the goal of setting the SCrypt parameters that way when creating the wallet. To stop people from being able to crack it.. You would need to likely design an ASIC or use an FPGA with an absolutely ridiculous local memory size. It's simply not been done to my knowledge. You are far better off using many CPUs across many systems than designing your own processor. That will save you several million dollars.. I do not believe you understand what an ASIC is or how they work. If you would like, I can explain it, but it might be better to do so on the forums. I will try to make this as simple as possible to avoid having to explain all of that.\nSimple answer: No. There is nothing you can do except cluster a bunch of CPU machines together and hope for the best or deal with the speeds offered by your GPUs, if it runs on them at all. If you want, you can drop a couple million bucks and have a custom ASIC with a massive amount of memory designed to do your math, but most people don't have that kind of capital laying around to blow on something like this. There is no other magical way to make this work or suddenly make it faster. If there was, we wouldnt be using SCrypt for key derivation. Obviously.. What driver version is currently installed? Nvidia drivers are usually the culprit for specific modes not working.. I'm actually not sure when it happened @magnumripper, I need to dig through the versions and find out. It doesnt seem bad at all, considering all it does is add another rule for 'x' (Extract range) and move the original function (delete range) to 'O'.. Remove the *. That is NOT a part of the hash. What you are trying to load is a MySQL5 hashes, which is just a double round of SHA1 raw if i remember correctly. Strip the * and load as -m 300 and it will work just fine.. Cracking of the second layer passwords is supported by https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover \nIt may be possible to implement for hashcat, though I haven't looked into how that specific algorithm works.. It's likely that one of the hashes you are targeting has different KDF settings, which can result in slower/faster generation times. KDF settings in applications are usually tuned towards slower generation speeds as time goes on to resist attacks from newer, more advanced hardware. It's possible that your unknown hash was generated using weaker settings and is thus easier/faster to generate candidates for.. \"hashcat --force\"\nWell that should tell you everything you need to know right there.. After some review, I have revised my proposed fix to include a warning message in place of the potfile count, skipping the potfile remove step entirely. I've issued a pull request that implements my changes. . ",

If I use your calculation there, it would give me a huge length number which is much bigger than the whole keyspace. The length on this task should be something around 250000 to take ~10 mins on this computer.\n. It seems to be related with the salts in some way. When I just use one of the hashes, the result will be the same. \nWith non-salted algorithms the numbers are correct.. I tried now with the same salted hashlist again, it works as it should now.\n```\n$ hashcat/hashcat --machine-readable --opencl-devices=3 --hash-type=2711 hashlists/hl24 -a 0 files/wordlist.txt --progress-only\nhashcat (v3.20-30-g367024d+) starting in progress-only mode...\n3:262144:534965.57\nStarted: Sat Dec 10 16:23:32 2016\nStopped: Sat Dec 10 16:32:45 2016\n```\nAs you see the benchmarking took quite some time, nearly as much as a chunk normally would be approximately. Is there a way that the number of keyspace progresses (like 262144 here) could be smaller?. Thanks a lot for explaining and implementing this. \nThe changes provide what I need now.. Thanks a lot for the quick fix. The output is correctly now.. Sorry for not stating my command clearly. I checked again, it only happens when --quiet is not set.. Yes, because your STATUS grep statement seems to be wrong:\n$ ./hashcat example0.hash -a 3 ?a --mac  | grep ^STATUS\ngives no output. \n$ ./hashcat example0.hash -a 3 ?a --mac  | grep STATUS | grep \" \" | wc -l\n       1\n$. Ok, that's really a strange behaviour. So this carriage return was causing the first part of the STATUS line to be with spaces instead of tabs in the terminal?\nBasically there is no problem with adding --quiet (I think it's cleaner anyway), just need to check that this is done everywhere on the clients. So I guess we will go with this solution.. Ok, thanks a lot.. But when the default is to never timeout, then the idea of alerting user forgetting the attack mode or a dictionary would not work anymore.. Ah sorry, my fault, I misunderstood this part.. Are you sure that this should be switched? Because there might be some confusion between some implementations (e.g. https://github.com/adegtyarev/streebog) which for some reason mirrored the example hashes compared to the original RFC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6986#section-10.1.2). And as far as I see, the current way hashcat is doing is the way how it's given by the examples in the RFC.. Yes, I can confirm that the client is working.\nThough, in case of an error on the client side, the log output is quite scrambled because it's in between the other status output etc.. @apatedolos Are you using the brain with a fast hash algorithm? Keep in mind that according to the release notes, it's only worth to use the brain for very slow algorithms otherwise the brain is a bottleneck.. Thanks, the server now starts successfully and works on Windows.\nBut now the brain client on Windows seem to be broken because of the change:\n```\nhashcat64.exe --brain-client --brain-host localhost --brain-password xxxxxx -m 0 -a 0 example0.hash example.dict\nhashcat (v5.0.0-9-g61ded2bd) starting...\nlocalhost: Either the application has not called WSAStartup, or WSAStartup failed.\nStarted: Wed Oct 31 10:59:42 2018\nStopped: Wed Oct 31 10:59:42 2018\n```. With the newest beta both client and server are working now on Windows, so the issue is resolved.\nThanks again.. The brain is not useful for all algorithms. It depends on the speed in total you have on it (including if you distribute it) otherwise it would introduce a large bottleneck for faster algorithms.. Like the name is indicating, electrum2john.py is part of John the Ripper, you can find it in its repository: https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/run/electrum2john.py. The entry in the readme should be done with the second commit. And the tab_completion is contained in the first commit. Did I miss something there?\nI can give the optimized ones a try maybe at a later point.. Oh, I was not referring to improving the way how this message is displayed. My point mostly was to improve the (in most cases) wrong statement about 32 being the limit of optimized kernels.\nBut your idea is quite nice as well, reducing the number of lines printed, makes a better overview.. I can build as well without any problems on Mojave/10.14.2. Basically, the only steps I do, is to clone and then run make.\ngit clone https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat && cd hashcat\nmake\nBut as @magnumripper already asked, do you have xcode and the command line tools installed?. What kind of vanity hashes are you trying to generate?\nI have some modifications which allow finding special sha1 hashes: https://github.com/s3inlc/hashcat/tree/full-minmax\nMaybe this can help to see what you need to change to generate what you need.. Take a look at the changes which were required on the m00100_a3-optimized kernel, basically you can do nearly the same for the keccak kernel, just adjusted for the kind of vanity hashes you want.. Sorry for the delay, I updated the kernels based on your comments.. Requested changes are applied.. uhh, indeed a very stupid mistake \ud83d\ude48 \nBut I'm surprised that the tests didn't fail when I ran it.. ",

    "marukka": "Unfortunately this request isnt exactly practicable. If you dont intend on supporting virtualized environments then just close this out. Although I think especially in the future you'll see more and more people run this in those environments.. The CPUs and chipset set is a pair of Xeon E5-2660 v2 and a Intel C602 (on a SuperMicro X9DAE). Both are rather common pieces of hardware, which are widely used with environments with PCIe pass through.\nPCIe passthrough is not \"very experimental\". I'm not sure where you're getting this from. VT-d has been around for since the late 2000s, this isnt some bleeding edge feature.\nNo the VM isnt out of resources. It has 4 cores and 16GB RAM allocated to it with 100% resource reservations and all it is doing is running hashcat. The cards are identical, and this will happen even if I try it with a file with only a single SHA1 hash.\nAnd there is not \"too many variables\" for you to attempt to determine the root cause. FFS if you even google the error message, you'll see plenty of posts from other developers talking about how it is just a generic error message Nvidia will return for OpenCL apps when any number of problems go wrong such as kernel launch time exceeding a timeout, and you're just taking it literally without consulting Nvidia's documentation.\nI've been looking in to this some more and I do think I've found the root cause, which of course is a bug in hashcat. The kernel launch time is exceeding the timeout value on Windows (default of 2 seconds) and Windows is killing the driver because it thinks it crashed. The reason it works with one specific GPU is that GPU doesn't have a display attached to it, so the TDR functionality is disabled for it. Playing around with the TDRDelay registry value seems promising so far, I'll continue to test it more tomorrow and report back with more details.\nSee:\nhttps://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/461532/cuda-programming-and-performance/cl_out_of_resources/post/3278455/#3278455\nhttp://mcx.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?Doc/FAQ#Does_MCX_support_multiple_GPUs_in_a_single_computer\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087(v=vs.85).aspx\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff569918(v=vs.85).aspx. I still need to continue testing, or as you recommended disable TDR all together. But to reply to your comments on your experiences with passing through video cards, I've only noticed two issues with other applications. When playing games at 4k resolution with SLI enabled, in full screen mode the screen with have a strong purple tint and strobe effect. This can be worked around by running games in borderless windowed full screen mode or disabling SLI. The second being a compatibility issue between Nvidia's driver and the VMware SVGA driver, which causes the Nvidia driver to constantly crash. Disabling the VMware driver resolves the issue, and the only loss of functionality i've seen is that the remote console doesnt support things like automatically changing the resolution when you make it full screen. Otherwise everything works perfectly.\nI'm not saying this should be a standard test environment of yours, but if you ever decide to give it another try (and assuming you'd use ESXi and a GeForce card) there are a couple things you need to. Since Nvidia didnt want to cannibalize their \"professional\" product line,  they added a basic virtualization check to their driver to prevent it from running in virtualized environments with GeForce series cards. If you add hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = false to the VMX file of the VM, you can work around this restriction. And although this shouldnt be relevant from my reading of your documentation regarding SLI, if you need to enable SLI you can patch the drivers with DifferentSLI Auto 1.5 to remove the license check. VMware doesn't present a SLI license in the VM's BIOS if one is present on the motherboard (which it is in the case of my X9DAE). Personally I think it should, see how they support Apple's OS X license checks on Apple hardware, but I digress.. So i've been playing around with the TDR timeout values some more. Setting it to 300 (5 minutes) allowed hashcat to run for 9 or 10 minutes before it terminated. Setting it to 600 (10 minutes) has allowed it to run for well over half an hour now. But I have noticed some unexpected behavior, and I can only assume the root cause of it (whatever it may be) is what is causing this problem. For some reason the load on the 2nd GPU is fluctuating significantly. It will be at ~100% for a while and then drop down to 0% for a while as you can see in this screenshot. It will continue to oscillate back and forth between ~100% and 0% every few minutes. Do you guys have any idea why this might happen?\n\nAlso when this happens, even though hashcat reports the load as 0% (and the card temperature seems to confirm this) it will erroneously report a large processing rate under Speed.Dev.#2. After a few minutes the Speed.Dev.#2 value begins to drop.. So basically what you're saying is that your code is infailable, and that everyone else must be at fault. And that your programming skills make you a god among men. We just confirmed that your code is timing out and triggering the TDR in Windows, yet you're blamining everyone else. Whats next, when hashcat segfaults you're going to blame everyone else too for your code accessing an illegal address because the kernel should simply let you access any memory address you desire? Wow you've been blown the fuck out.. And to comment on your claim that there is no money in GPU computing for Nvidia, please explain their Tesla line of cards.. I apologize as I may have been a bit rash. But my point I think still stands. Take for instance the FDIV bug in old Intel Pentiums. When it was discovered the entire x86 computing industry didnt throw its hands up in the air and say, oh well too bad, it isnt our problem its Intels. Instead they worked around it, companies like MathWorks implemented software floating point routines for their products, and companies like Microsoft added switches like /QIfdiv to their compilers to use software floating point routines when it detected it was running on an effected chip.\nAnd although reporting a bug doesnt guarantee it will get fixed, a perfect example being my bug report right here, if you never report it upstream then that is a guarantee that it will never be fixed.\nNow i'll play devils advocate for a moment and assume this is a problem with a 3rd party you have no control over. You still can fix this bug. As we've discovered here, changing the TDR timeout works around the problem. All you have to do is have hashcat set a registry key and restart the driver or reboot the computer to make it take effect. As @epixoip said, hashcat used to at least display a warning in prior versions but this functionality was removed. Well as my case demonstrates, and as you say this is something \"we've experienced in the past\", there clearly seems to be a demand for this feature. Now of course this isnt the best fix as the GPU doesn't remain loaded constantly but some additional computing power is better than none.. Also it would be nice if you could address hashcat incorrectly reporting device performance. Specifically it saying Speed.Dev.#2 has a non-zero value when the load is 0% in my previous screenshot.. The FDIV bug wasnt worked around at the OS level afaik. It was worked around either in programs specifically such as MathWorks, or at the compiler level as with MS's VisualStudio compiler.\nIf you are concerned about user confusion regarding UAC prompts you can present a prompt beforehand. And if people are that worried about security then they'll be either running it in a VM like myself or on dedicated hardware which will be reimaged after use, which they wont care about a registry change on anyways.\nRegarding other applications being broken by a driver restart, when this bug occurs it will break them anyways when the driver is restarted by TDR. And again if you are concerned about this, a prompt can be displayed before making this change.\nIf you dont like my ideas then fine, its your product, not mine. But at least consider re implementing the message @epixoip said was in version 3.2. It at least will help some other people.\nAlthough this would be a much more time consuming (and thus a more unreasonable request), if you guys dont like OpenCL as much you can always try adding support for CUDA which gives the impression has better support from Nvidia.. It certainly is possible, not only in the ways I mentioned previously, but in the case of this error, resubmitting the workload, or detecting which GPU timed out and disabling its use. If you would rather  fix the root cause of the problem rather than work around it, then please, go open a support case with Nvidia. But as you've said repeatedly in this thread, you're not interested in doing that, or seemingly anything else about it other than say it exists, and has existed for a long time. You're in a far better position than myself to open a support case with Nvidia as you're actually familiar with the code base.\nAnd regarding false negatives, that is a ridiculous example. The overwhelming majority of systems running hashcat wont have ECC GPU or CPU memory. In the product pics of @epixoip 's Sagitta Brutalis with its base price of $18k, it shows it uses Radeons, not Quadros or Fire Pros which have ECC memory. If anyone was worried about false negatives, it would be his customers, and he would be advertising this system with Fire Pros/Quadros/Teslas if this was a concern of his customers.. ",

Yes. My bad I only tested multi-mode with provided examples. \nJust pushed the modification. This is a nice example of all the little details that needs to be addressed only for changing R0 .. R3 values. to fit with substring(... , 0, 32).. I fixed the output.\nI'll leave it as is for now. You probably want to fork it in case I delete it some day.\nFor the substring() feature itself, still not sure how and why it should be merged to master unless there are some indications of frameworks/applications that are using this.\nCheers,. I'd like to get my hands dirty with Blake2 (hashing function used by Argon2).\nAny resources / quick guidance for new kernel implementations ?   Or we just do it hard with messy PRs ?. @roycewilliams Yeah sure will do. So I guess still no docs for key structs ^^ . Update of what is done so far;\n\n[x] Chacha20\n[x] Blake2b \n[ ] Argon2d\n[ ] Keepass format\n\nRegarding Argon2d, I am trying a full GPU implementation for low costs (bad parameters) and a hybrid CPU/GPU one for high memory costs. I'll probably need @jsteube advice for the hybrid one later on.\n . I could look into this, but I mean... why on earth would you want to crack hashes on Android ? Not sure it worths the time investment...\n. According to @Banaanhangwagen Doc link, this looks like AES-XTS 128 bits.\nI believe there is another Issue opened for this mode (Bitlocker for Windows 10).\nKDF is PBKDFv2 with salted SHA-256 (which is already implemented).\nThis might be simple to implement once AES-XTS is done. \nEDIT: Truecrypt and Veracrypt seem to implement XTS... perhaps this could be feasible.. Ok might have found a way to tshoot this. All GPU debuggers failed on my Ubuntu system, but I could probably return values in buffers of mark() call. Will look at this tomorrow.\nWhat you guys use for debugging ?. Just peed on myself. Never been so happy to have printf() working.\nThx rly much... will fix my crap.. Alright, debugged the kernel code for single hash function s04.\nCan you please confirm coding style is okay, before I move on to other functions and kernel files ?\nAlso, I am using the right params for the right kernel purpose or did I hack something in a useless way ? (I am not talking about optimizing my own code, but rather if I am using the right kernel parameters/macros/structs/functions.).\nFinally, a quick description of m04, m08 and m16 funcs ? Do they relate to different input dimensions or kernel threads dimensions ? \nThanks for helping me out !\n. Understood. \nYes there is a built-in salt in Blake2b and also a variable size output, but I was planning to add it at the very end to avoid too much confusion since this is my first kernel implementation... you know what they say... Romantic Dinner before backseat P0rn. But, I'll comply with JtR format and apply the changes during the weekend.\nThanks.. Alright.. so looking at JtR \nhttps://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/8bcaddef35f703c47367fad612e473061459b156/src/rawBLAKE2_512_fmt_plug.c \nit looks like optional salt is not implemented for this RAW 512 bit implementation also with fixed size output. I guess this would make more sense in the Argon2 implementation.\nIt should not be a hurdle to implement this (variable hash length + salt), but is it preferable to do it with another -m number such as 610 ?\nFor now, all 3 kernels are working and were tested. Hash format works against JtR. Please let me know the final steps, if any, to get this work merged.\nThanks,\n. Okay there is a problem with test.pl... will have to fix this first.\nIf anything else to look at comes to mind, please let me know.. I can see what is wrong, but I don't know the best approach to the problem. I am now testing only with Attack Mode 0. VECT_SIZE will define some kind of array to every u??x types, so I need to process this in \"parallel\" in the algorithm.\nAny thoughts on the best way to achieve this, I still feel there is one piece missing when I look at other implementations.... Thanks for the great feedback !\nI pretty much understand all your points, I'll push all fixes soon. \nI'll include support for blake2b options in kernels.  The big question here is since we need to test them, do we include directly these tests in a 610 mode in the current PR or not ?. Okay, spent some hours looking at this and I think I am doing it wrong by initializing the state and parameters in the kernel. Parameter block (p_) is used only once for state initialization and state (s_) is used and updated for each hash update/final.\nPerhaps, it would be better to handle those initialization variables in CPU and then just relay the state to the GPU kernels. That way, I would not be stuck with all conditional statements/execution branches and would improve speed.\nI saw that there were special cases such as SCRYPT that relays data from CPU directly to kernel function arguments. That would be convenient for this purpose, but I feel this is may become a major change in the current project. In the end, it would really simplify kernel code especially for KEYED mode where pre-hashing is required.\nWhat do you think ?\nPS: Btw only attack mode 0 received some love this weekend, As per dicussion above, next commits will be applied to all other modes.. Gave it a shot !\nParams and State are initiated in interface.c and relayed through \"esalt\" buffer down to GPU kernel. This should be suitable for transforms and KEYED-mode pre-computing.\nNow everything looks fine for attack modes 0, 1 & 3. VECT_SIZE > 1 also fixed for vector-types.\nI guess we can call this a day !\nCheers,. Okay. For the fixes I should be able to commit something tonight. For the questions:\n2) Vector cracking was working yesterday for VECT_SIZE 2 for attack mode 0, 1 & 3 using tools/test.sh. Will take a look to see if any bug was induced, but it should work now. Initial problem was a wrong usage of vector-types uXXx.\n3) Not yet but will do. I needed to have a fully working kernel before doing benchmark tests.\n5) Intent was for KEYED mode in Blake2b performs a first hash with the KEY. This could become handy to pre-hash this in CPU and relay the output through esalt buffer for computation without too much overhead on kernel code. Unless you believe there is a neat performance gain of putting all this in kernel, I could do so. For now, cpu_blake2.h only holds types used in interface.c.\n6) According to the official reference on github, the output is simply truncated. (see. blake2b_final(...) in blake2b-ref.c). So should be a piece of pie to implement in interface.c\n9) I'll comply with JtR convention.\nThanks. Alright. Pushed all the fixes.\nGreat perf gain for the blake2b_sigma integration. Over 100% in gain.\nNot so much for the esalt_bufs out of the loop tho.\n. Blake2 comes in four flavors. The \"b\" one is the most used right now so that is why it is probably referred to only \"Blake2\" in JtR. But the true name is \"Blake2b\" and I don't think this will confuse users since perl and python libraries refer to \"Blake2b\".\nThanks for your help and guidance on this one. Was fun to do, more to come ;). Okay I found what is the problematic code, but I'm not sure if this is some \"desired\" behavior.\nThe pw_max is overriden to 31 in straight.c at function straight_ctx_init see below:\n```\n[...]\nconst bool has_noop = kernel_rules_has_noop (straight_ctx->kernel_rules_buf, straight_ctx->kernel_rules_cnt);\nif (has_noop == false)\n  {\n    switch (user_options_extra->attack_kern)\n    {\n      case ATTACK_KERN_STRAIGHT:  if (pw_max > PW_DICTMAX) pw_max = PW_DICTMAX;\n                                  break;\n      case ATTACK_KERN_COMBI:     if (pw_max > PW_DICTMAX) pw_max = PW_DICTMAX;\n                                  break;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    if (hashconfig->attack_exec == ATTACK_EXEC_INSIDE_KERNEL)\n    {\n      switch (user_options_extra->attack_kern)\n      {\n        case ATTACK_KERN_STRAIGHT:  if (pw_max > PW_DICTMAX) pw_max = PW_DICTMAX;\n                                    break;\n        case ATTACK_KERN_COMBI:     if (pw_max > PW_DICTMAX) pw_max = PW_DICTMAX;\n                                    break;\n      }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      // in this case we can process > 32\n    }\n  }\n```\n ATTACK_EXEC_INSIDE_KERNEL is set for my hash mode 670 and has_noop is true.\nWhat was the original intent from this code ? Since it now seem to conflict with modes that permits pw > 31, I am not sure if we should use a workaround by selecting different configuration options or figure out a patch.  . 1) Sure.\n2) Early implementation leftover.. Thanks for catching it I'll remove it. This is a stream cipher and originally I wanted to allow variable length, but revised such design since it is totally useless for cracking purposes.\n3) I'll implement the is_valid_hex_string() since the hash format is fixed size. Thanks for pointing this out.\n4) Wasn't aware of this. Will fix.\n5) Sure.\n  . One cool thing to add would be position + offset values to be more flexible for the cipher position in use.\nI could commit something to reflect that change, but it requires a new format parameter.\nSuch as $SIGNATURE$*POSITION*OFFSET*IV*PLAINTEXT*CIPHERTEXT. Alright..\nCombining position and offset parameters, you can now reach any consecutive 8 bytes in any keystream. This new addition also enables to reach an 8 byte cipher across two keystream blocks !\nIt makes more sense to allow users to reach any part of the keystream.\nWill wait for your comments !. Hi,\nare you sure this isn't shell specific ? By that, I mean that '?' is interpreted by the command line as a wildcard. Try escape the question mark with a \"\\\".. Just reproduced your problem on Ubuntu with a file called \"dl\". Look at the output of strace utility:\nUBUNTU:~/dev/hashcat$ strace ./hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example0.hash -1 ?l ?1?1?1?1?1\nexecve(\"./hashcat\", [\"./hashcat\", \"-a\", \"3\", \"-m\", \"0\", \"example0.hash\", \"-1\", \"dl\", \"?1?1?1?1?1\"], [/* 65 vars */]) = 0\nbrk(NULL)                               = 0x250b000\nOne of the arguments is \"dl\" and not \"?l\" so it was interpreted by bash and not hashcat.\nSorry, there is no fix for this^^.

So the question to @jsteube is if there is some design requirements for inputs over 31 bytes to be ignored in GPU ?. I believe this is actually a really bad design.\n1) Using two independant parts combined with XOR enables collisions. \n2) This algorithm is not secure. It is vulnerable to a clever attack by pre-computing the right side which may be empty (or padded) for passwords below 9 chars. \nWhich system uses this ?. Do you have a hint on the password's length you are looking for ? Or is it really fixed to 16 bytes ?\nAlso, can you provide a test samples ?. To be honest, I don't believe that implementing that algorithm will solve your problem.\nIf the password is known to be 16 bytes and is not using common dictionary terms, you stil have to search in the whole key space which is about 26**16 for only lowercase characters... which is kinda huge.\nThe way I see the problem, is that you could abuse from the collision problem of the XORing operation instead. You'll get a lot more probabilities of getting a successful result. The rationale behind this is the following:\nWe are looking for challenge C for a password in two parts P1 & P2. The result is thus C = f(P1) XOR g(P2) where f & g are hmacs functions. If we use small numbers to represent this, we know that 7 = 5 XOR 2 = 2 XOR 5. So there exists such collision if we inverse the results. But also, 7 = 3 XOR 4 = 4 XOR 3 and so on... It is a better bet to find a collision instead of a unique pair.\nThe attack could be simple: Pre-compute one side with 8 bytes password and XOR the result with the hash you are looking for. Store all resulting hashes with the password part used. Then compute the other side with new guesses and match the output against the hash stored at previous step. When you get a hit, you get a collision (or the ral password if really really lucky).\nOf course finding a collision will be useless if the password is reused along with another algorithm for further processing.... But if used only for authentication, than this could be a great solution. . I agree.\nIf the password was less than 16 chars this could've been a trivial attack just like fo LM hashes. But for 16 byte passwords it gets more tricky.\nNow understand that the attack I presented IS ambitious but has better potential than a pure key space search.\nIn the end, the question is \"shall we implement such kernel ?\". I don't belive so. But I am ready to help if other (and better) options are available. \nPerhaps core hashcat members can reject comments here.\n  . Looking at the Python code....\n```\ndef getHmac(secret, data, hash):\n    return hmac.new(secret, data, hash).digest()\ndef Khmac(secret, seed, bytes, hash):\n    nu_seed = seed\n    output = ''\n    while len(output) < bytes:\n        nu_seed = getHmac(secret, nu_seed, hash)\n        output += getHmac(secret, nu_seed + seed, hash)\n    return output[:bytes]\n```\nI've never implemented HMACs myself, but it looks odd to perform the computation twice. Seems like your problem may come from there @jsteube . @jamorham Yes if you are looking for a collision., because pre-computing the whole keyspace for just 8 bytes (one half) still requires a huge amount of space. So finding the exact pair will still remain a problem.. If you guys really want this password.. I believe what @jsteub is proposing will be your best bet.. Sure !\nI'll check this out.. Some heads up on this.\nI did not forget, will do this work in upcoming week. \nCheers.. ",

But to make use of the GPU power, we need to spawn at least 1280 parallel computations, so we end up with a memory requirement of 320GB ram per GPU. It would require a minimum of a 256 divisions TMTO to get it working on a GTX1080, which drops the performance < 1 H/s.\nI've tried digging to find further math, but can't find any additional reading on why we have to spawn (at least) 1280 parallel computations for the total GPU memory requirement?\nThanks..

AMD R9 M370X which was previously between 6 and 13KH/s IIRC.\nPlain benchmarks:\n```\n$ hashcat -m 2500 -b -d 3\nhashcat (v4.1.0) starting in benchmark mode...\nBenchmarking uses hand-optimized kernel code by default.\nYou can use it in your cracking session by setting the -O option.\nNote: Using optimized kernel code limits the maximum supported password length.\nTo disable the optimized kernel code in benchmark mode, use the -w option.\nOpenCL Platform #1: Apple\n\nDevice #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4980HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz, skipped.\nDevice #2: Iris Pro, skipped.\nDevice #3: AMD Radeon R9 M370X Compute Engine, 512/2048 MB allocatable, 10MCU\n\nBenchmark relevant options:\n\n--opencl-devices=3\n--optimized-kernel-enable\n\nHashmode: 2500 - WPA/WPA2 (Iterations: 4096)\nSpeed.Dev.#3.....:    18322 H/s (68.22ms) @ Accel:128 Loops:64 Thr:64 Vec:1\nStarted: Sun Feb  4 12:57:31 2018\nStopped: Sun Feb  4 12:57:42 2018\n```\nWith -w 4:\n```\n$ hashcat -m 2500 -b -d 3 -w 4\nhashcat (v4.1.0) starting in benchmark mode...\nOpenCL Platform #1: Apple\n\nDevice #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4980HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz, skipped.\nDevice #2: Iris Pro, skipped.\nDevice #3: AMD Radeon R9 M370X Compute Engine, 512/2048 MB allocatable, 10MCU\n\nBenchmark relevant options:\n\n--opencl-devices=3\n--workload-profile=4\n\nHashmode: 2500 - WPA/WPA2 (Iterations: 4096)\nSpeed.Dev.#3.....:    19438 H/s (259.88ms) @ Accel:128 Loops:64 Thr:256 Vec:1\nStarted: Sun Feb  4 12:57:55 2018\nStopped: Sun Feb  4 12:58:11 2018\n```\nAnything else you need, just ask. Also, plugging in the charger does nothing to improve performance, so they don't seem to be throttling on battery power.. @philsmd I was under the impression that @jsteube wanted us to test the new version...\n\nI've add some more code to change certain parameters, another shot in the dark, since I do not have access to that system and can not reproduce locally.

Sorry to bring this back up, but it looks like SHA-384 is going to be used in WPA3. Mathy Vanhoef (discoverer of KRACK attacks) published this:\n\n\nIncreased Session Key Sizes\nFinally, the fourth improvement that WPA3 offers is increased key sizes. More specifically, they refer to the Commercial National Security Algorithms (CNSA) suite. This means WPA3 will support AES-GCM with 256-bit keys for encryption, and elliptic curve cryptography based 384-bit curves. Additionally, SHA384 of the SHA2 family will be used, and any employed RSA keys must be at least 3072 bits in size. All combined, this results in 192-bit security, because that's roughly the effective strength of 384-bit elliptic curves and SHA384.\n\n\nhttp://www.mathyvanhoef.com. ",

    "extended11": "Hi @philsmd ,\nI just tried to again with beta 3.6.0+305, and the issue seems to be gone. Thanks! . A note on the validity of '$' in the salt. While the crypt(3) man page states: \"salt is a two-character string chosen from the set [a-zA-Z0-9./].\", apparently some real-world systems do seem to use the '$' character in the salt. I just confirmed that hashcat is able to crack hashes with a '1$' salt.\nSo I guess allowing '$' in the salt is debatable. But regardless, the corruption should not happen. . @roycewilliams Good question, I actually don't know. I concluded that from the fact that in thedescrypt hash collection I'm working on there's a couple of hashes starting with '1$' and they can be cracked with -m 1500. So that means, some software has generated them at some point in the past. However this hash collection is over 20 years old (obviously, as I hope no one uses descrypt any more) and it does not contain any contextual information about the origin of the hashes or the software that was used to generate them.. This can explain the '$' in the salts:\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/15/5\nSeems like multiple BSD (Free, Open, DragonFly, Net) variants used to have crypt.c implementations that (silently) converted invalid chars in the salt to a '.' char when crypt()ing.\nAlso, here is an online implementation (in js, based on crypt.c from OpenBSD from 2003) that will accept invalid chars: https://unix4lyfe.org/crypt/.

The good news is that it's running and you can work around with --status to at least get some output about how long it will take, progress, etc.\nI don't see hashcat using any special library for input, it's just stdin and standard fd handling procedures. However the code does look quite complex as input processing goes.\nI would guess that something is either screwing with stdin or denying the mutex to the terminal thread.\nI have AMD and Intel both using the latest opencl drivers. In theory none of those should be touching stdin and are most likely touching the mutex. On the other hand you should be able to wget the AMD drivers without having to set a referrer and Intel should provide deb packages for their drivers but don't, both should be providing a repo and AMD should be providing support for ubuntu 17.

The host machine outputs the same warnings. I tried on different machines, including AWS instances. Also, I couldn't find a tutorial how to setup OpenCL + Nvidia for hashcat. The basic google steps give what I've already shown.. Yes, 2nd option works, thank you.\nI also found already discussed topic at https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1262. I'm closing this a duplicate.. Although I use my phone as @jsteube mentioned - capture handshake and send to a cracking server, - sometimes such a pipeline is not convenient and I'd like to check really small password candidates beforehand. Once I missed for hashcat in android when I was sort of underground or in other countries where for some reason you can't use 3G (for example, it's not cheap for your network provider). Doing WPA/WPA2 handshake password guessing, aircrack-ng is an alternative. But in this case, you'd have to support both versions - hashcat and aircrack-ng - which is not what you want simply because hashcat is a more advanced engine.\nAnother alternative is to run hashcat in a docker container in Android. Has anyone tried this?. > Every CPU should be fine by using Intel OpenCL runtime (even for non-Intel CPU).\nTo use Intel OpenCL runtime one has to install it first which adds ~130 Mb on top of docker image.\nBut you made it clear. OK. ",

The current hardware that the GPU lives in only has PCI Express 2.0 slots, so using ROCm is out of the question.

The beta worked fine on my Windows rig, thanks!   And in fact, most of the benchmark numbers are a touch faster than what's in the spreadsheet above.

    "ryanwoods1706": "Also a side note, I'm cracking an ETH wallet for a friend that has about 22k worth of Ethereum in it, so if someone can help me resolve this, once I'm in I'm willing to pay :). @jsteube Sorry for the tag, but I'd appreciate some help :). @philsmd So its impossible to crack it with a GPU? How much VRam is needed? What if i purchase 256GB of system memory will that work at all or not?. @philsmd So really GPU cracking the wallet is out of the question?. When you tested with -m 15700 on the 1080ti, how much ram did the 1080TI have ? Also mind sending me the KDFParams of the wallet you tested on to see if its the same (forgot which of the paramaters changes how much RAM is needed) But I know that if one of the parameters of the KDFParams is \"262144\" as shown in the screenshot, then the RAM usage for the GPU goes through the roof. Hardware isn't an issue, I'm willing to go out and spend $1k/month renting a GPU server to try and crack this. However https://stealthsploit.com/2017/06/12/ethereum-wallet-cracking/ this tutorial on cracking ETH wallets, in the comments theres loads of people who have the same issue I'm having above and was told that the algorithm will NOT crack on a GPU if certain parameters are too high, hence im trying to get some help here before i go spend a grand. Because when cracking an Ethereum wallet, depending on the wallets parameters you\u2019re unable to crack it with a GPU, since it has huge memory requirements. . Spoken to about 10/15 various hardware experts, and most have said it\u2019ll work without any need of any implementation on the programs end, however some said that the program might need to use the API to intergrate with it. All have said it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s just whether it\u2019ll work without the API implementation or not . I'm waiting to hear back from AMD about this, contacted them directly a few days ago so waiting for a reply. But why wouldn't it be possible to use the SSG as memory in a way meaning that it'll save stuff to files for when it needs it? Might be a bit of work but logically it seems possible. https://www.pcworld.com/article/3099964/hardware/amds-new-ssg-technology-adds-an-ssd-to-its-gpu.html \"The SSG memory would be treated as part of a huge pool of RAM. If the GPU can\u2019t find its data in the local GDDR5+ or HBM RAM, it would then search the SSG. Only after that would it have to ask the CPU for what it wants.\" @Chick3nman \n. Okay fair enough, but from what you\u2019ve said that does that mean that if the GPU needs more memory it\u2019ll go to the System and ask for some? (But it\u2019ll be fucking slow) . If we could split this RAM usage up magically into several pieces, some of which would go into the VRAM and the rest into system RAM/Disk efficiently, then the SSG would make sense. But we aren't doing that because doing so is NOT efficient.\nFrom what you said there, would it be possible to do that with a normal GPU then? Like a 1080ti or something. Of course it wouldn\u2019t be efficient, but it would surely increase hashrates (if possible) to maybe like anywhere from a couple hundred to 10,000? (Just a guess), but it just won\u2019t be efficient \n. So its literally impossible to do this on a GPU at all?. Are there any parallel processors out there (that are good) cost isn\u2019t an issue. FPGA? Are there not ASIC scrypt machines out there? I\u2019d jut need to load an OS on them and run it, and of course as a ton of RAM. I've got a conference call with developers at AMD soon, but from the looks of our conversation so far it looks plausible:\n\u201cThe SSG API is intended to allow you to use the 2TB of SSD storage as a cache layer for the GPU, so it should appear effectively as GPU memory. At this point we\u2019re reaching the limits of what I can explain, and I would recommend getting a quick conference call scheduled between one of our developers and the customer \u2013 is that something you can arrange?\u201d\nOnce I've had the call with AMD and we've reached a conclusion, if it is possible to use the 2TB of SSG in that way, would you (hashcat developers) be able to implement that into your software? . @Chick3nman @jsteube .  Nope, I ended up just spinning up a couple google cloud servers and cracking it that way. :P . ",

Electrum 1.x wallets should be checked by decrypting with sha256(sha256(pass)) and making sure the whole half seed is base16, I believe something very similar applies to versions between 2 and 2.8 (salt type 2, where they have the \"starts with xprv check\"), while they are using full wallet encryption for 2.8+.\nThe various extract scripts you see around are just taking the iv + first 16 bytes of the encrypted seed, leaving the remaining 32 bytes \"private\".\nI can open another issue for the addition request if you want to, of course.

    "yarda": "We would like to package it to Fedora and according to the Fedora packaging guidelines every public library needs to be versioned. For me the library seems like public API/interface so it should probably have SONAME. We can provide patches. What's your opinion?. The patch is more like hack, but seems to work for us. Feel free to improve it or comment. We are ready to update it according to comments.. AppVeyor build failures seems unrelated to the patch for me.. Just proposal, we need API version. Usually in new projects we start from 0.0 (major/minor), but there can be any sane API numbering.. @TomasKorbar please update the PR to address the bug, i.e. edit it to have (you can do git push -f to force push it):\n-$(RM) -f obj/*.o obj/lzma_sdk/*.o *.bin *.exe *.so *.dll *.pid hashcat core\n+$(RM) -f obj/*.o obj/lzma_sdk/*.o *.bin *.exe *.so *.so.* *.dll *.pid hashcat core. No problem, if the e.g. 4.0.1 API is not compatible with the 4.0.0. E.g. all consumers of the API needs to be recompiled upon bump to 4.0.1, 4.0.2, etc. Most projects bump the stable API version after while only when doing API changes.. @jsteube  my previous comment is wrong, yours proposal is better.. Usually auto tools do all the magic :) I will re-think it and provide updated PR soon.. I think libhashcat.so.4.0.1 is OK for the filename of the library, but on Linux we should probably set SONAME to libhashcat.so.4, i.e. use only the MAJOR number for it when linking, ie.: call ld with '-Wl,-soname,libhashcat.so.4', this way the consumers of the API will have to be recompiled only if the MAJOR version of the API will be bumped taking into account the hashcat version means MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Well, it's probably non-portable (it seems e.g. FreeBSD use different approach than Linux). It's usually better to keep the magic on the libtool / auto-tools than doing it the hard way :)\nI will update the patch.. Also the SONAME_VERSION will have to be set by some bootstrap script before making the upstream release, because git history is not available in the tarball. Or maybe we could parse it from the VERSION_EXPORT variable.. it seems VERSION_TAG already does it.. Tomas will update the PR later today - I am supervising/sponsoring him in Fedora.. @TomasKorbar this is wrong patch.. @jsteube sorry for delay, please wait for next PR.. FYI for Tomas this is the first contribution to real upstream/github project.. @TomasKorbar mostly. Why is there hunk on lines 342 - 354? Also you shouldn't change the whitespaces .e.g lines 347/365 and many others. Please provide updated PR.. @TomasKorbar you probably didn't update your repo and rebased the commit by:\ngit pull\ngit rebase\n. @jsteube the basic idea should be clear even from this PR. We do not call now ldconfig in the install, because I think it should be handled by admin, i.e.:\n```\nmake install\nldconfig\n```\ne.g. with RPM packages the ldconfig is called in the RPM %postinst phase to make all the symlinks for new libraries. But we can add it to the install, if you think it's good to have.. @TomasKorbar great, well done, it looks much better now.. @jsteube it's ready for review :). OK, great, thanks.. I also added LZMA_SDK_INCLUDE variable which can specify full path to the SDK. Maybe we could use just one variable for it. Unfortunately the LZMA-SDK is not yet standardized across distros and the upstream LZMA-SDK release has still room for improvement.. Maybe you could consolidate the bundled lzma-sdk and more simplify the proposed patch (e.g. the ifdef could be removed).. Also we are trying to rebase the lzma-sdk to the latest 18.01 version in Fedora (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1546091). Hashcat needs small patch to compile with the lzma-sdk 18.01 (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1398951&action=diff), maybe you could refresh the bundled lzma-sdk and apply the patch.. ",

After doing this, I can run hashcat64.exe -V from anywhere but If I launch hashcat -b -m 0 -D 1 --force to test it is still failing saying ./hashcat.hctune: No such file or directory.\n\n\nThen I created on my hashcat directory (in my case is C:\\Program Files\\hashcat-5.1.0) a file called hashcat.bat . The content of the file is this:\n\n\n@echo off\nset original_dir=\"%CD%\"\ncd \"C:\\Program Files\\hashcat-5.1.0\"\nhashcat64.exe %*\ncd \"%original_dir%\" \nThe orgininal_dir var is set in order to return to the same directory where you are once launched. Otherwise it will change always our cmd prompt to hashcat directory. Remember that on the third line of the bat, the path that must be appear is where you have your hashcat (the same dir you added to the PATH env var, in my case is C:\\Program Files\\hashcat-5.1.0).\n\nLast step, just test it! Execute from anywhere hashcat -b -m 0 -D 1 --force <- this command execute the minimal benchmark test using CPU.\n\nThis worked for me on hashcat 5.1.0 for Windows (W10).. ",

Eventually something like \"Wrong maskfile syntax\" could be a better error message and would help more.\nBest Regards. First of all: If you don't know something of the structure of the pass I would say that you will not be able to recover it.\nMy benchmark shows 21h/s for a ATI GPU.... that's really. slow. The mode must be more or less complex.\nSteps to try:\n\nExtract the Hash of the iTunes Backup with something like itunes_backup2john.pl from the JohnTheRipper Package (http://www.openwall.com/john/). The exporters are helpful but Hashcat is the magic maker.\nYou will need to generate custom masks. You can gen a dictionary with the PACK Package (https://github.com/iphelix/pack). IMPORTANT: I think this won't work well. You try to solve the unsolveable problem.\nYour command looks like this: hashcat -a 3 -m 14800 -o cracked.txt --outfile-format=15 yourhash dict|mask|wordlist\n\nFor example a silly brute force for an 8 char pass about which you know nothing would look so:\nhashcat -a 3 -m 14800 -o cracked.txt --outfile-format=15 yourhash ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a\nThis would start but run until the universe explodes/implodes/or what ever it thinks it shoudl do when it ends. Think 9 char with ?a would cause an integer overflow. This could only be \"solved\" by generating intelligent masks. But also the masks generated by PACK could explode the integer I think.\nTo understand Mask Attacks read this: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack\nHoep this helps a bit. But I think you pass and data are gone.\nBest Regards. ",

    "RAN1": "Currently the first library pathname checked is the executing shell's $PWD/libhashcat. Because that pathname is copied from the library to executables, this is true of all executables linked, whether the library's in hashcat/ or the library directory. If there isn't a libhashcat in $PWD, then the default library paths are checked. This can cause misbehavior, so the PR changes it to the executable path for the initial build (in case the library is used in place) and again after install to the library directory.. > This sounds really strange to me. In Linux, there's no library search path for \".\" because of the security implication this creates. Here's an older issue that dealt with the same problem: #956 \nAs far as I can tell this is default behavior with macOS libraries if at build time the output isn't to an absolute path and the install path isn't specified.\n\nWait here, what kind of misbehavior are you talking about?\n\nI meant it is misbehavior for more or less clear reasons.\n\nOK, but wouldn't this create a relative path which is what we need to avoid (see the issue linked above)?\n\nIt's effectively the same as using $ORIGIN. The alternative is to just pass the library install path to -install_name and remove the changes to install_library and install_hashcat.. On macOS, library pathnames are hardcoded in the executable's load commands and they are checked first at runtime. If the path is \"relative/libfoo\" then it will look in \"./relative/libfoo\" first. This will cause problems similar to the ones RPATH causes.\nYes, there is the equivalent DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on macOS, but it has lower precedence than the hardcoded paths.\nEDIT: I tested this badly, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is checked before everything else, the hardcoded paths only have precedence over the regular library search paths.. I amended my PR to use only the library install path.. My benchmarks also showed no performance change. Compiling both versions with clang produces practically identical LLVM IR, so the final pass is probably just optimized out.\nI haven't been able to get your code to pass the selftest, I also tried it with:\nfor (pos1 = 64, pos4 = 16; pos1 < len - 64; pos1 += 64, pos4 += 16)\nI think it has something to do with this:\nfor (MAYBE_VOLATILE u32 i = lid; i < 64; i += lsz)\n{\n    w[i] = pws[gid].i[i]; // i == lid\n}\n\nThis seems like it copies from 64 different passwords from global into 1 password in local.. I still can't get it to work on my GPUs but my CPU failed (at first, works now) because w is declared u32 * in:\nDECLSPEC void md4_update_vector_local (md4_ctx_vector_t *ctx, __local u32 *w, const int len, const u32x w0r)\n\nIt should be u32x *. The above was due to a typo, I didn't know how to apply a patch. I still can't get it to run on anything other than CPUs.. Hi all, sorry about the late reply.\nThe main reason for the PR was just that the behavior didn't match the flag name. I forgot about the help description, and I didn't notice that the throttle warnings would be set off when temperature abort isn't set.\nThe only other reason was a cosmetic issue with hwmon-less systems, where the hwmon and temp abort flags would prevent the hwmon-not-detected message from displaying. However it's no longer a problem so it doesn't have any significance here.\nThe most recent commit is probably the best way to handle it anyways, again sorry for not seeing this earlier.. ",
    "w3soul": "Thanks jsteube,\nCan you think of any possible solutions ?\nI installed kali almost 20 times just to get hashcat to work, because every single time i tried tons of possible solutions and then ended up at broken OS.\nIf you want i can provide you ssh access for a deeper look (if you have some time please)?\nThanks, W.. Love it, But can we please debug at Kali 2018 because i am (and really wanted to use) Kali as my pentest OS. I have Ubuntu 18.04 in VM. So it will be much much appreciated if we can debug it in Kali please ?. No problem bro, But if i am understanding correctly you can help debug only if i can install Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04? Correct ?. Will do man. Appreciate your help.\nThanks, W.. Hey man, thanks for the follow up.\nSo the update is - hashcat 4.1.0 (from github or hashcat website) i was receiving same error no matter what. I tried every possible solution available on the internet without success.\nbut i garbed the binaries of 4.0.1 (also tried 4.0.0 and 3.6) from https://hashcat.net/hashcat/ and they all worked right out of the box with no issues.\nSo:\nroot@kali: hashcat -b (OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE for wpa2,zip,office etc)\nroot@kali:~/Downloads/hashcat4.0.1# ./hashcat -b (Works well)\nSo something is definitely going in 4.1.0 and i think the problem is with m02500.cl or m13600.cl.\nAny ideas when the next/new version will be avilable in the kali repos ?\nI am so sorry man, but installing ubuntu as a standalone OS and configuring 300+ pentest tools is a next level of pain in the butt.\nThanks & Hope it helps.

The standard does not specifies explicitly how to output the resulting hash. This implementation outputs hash in hexadecimal format in order how bytes are represented in memory - least significant first. With this option set, program outputs digest in hexadecimal format in reversed order - most significant first.\n\n\nI wonder how accurate this statement is, given that all the example digests are presented in big-endian order. I guess we should stick with big-endian, since it is more intuitive from the user point of view.\nWhat needs to be fixed is the ascii_digest branch for mode 11800 (Streebog-512). Currently, if you crack the example hash you get the output\na4db5b5dee898f8c110e[...]:hashcat\ninstead of\n5d5bdba48c8f89ee6c0a[...]:hashcat\nI'll amend the commit so that we won't need to open another PR.. > I would expect even deprecated schemes to be potential cracking targets.\nThey still are, I just did not include a testing container since I figured that there won't be much development going on with the RIPEMD-160 kernels anymore.\n\nI have a set here that includes RIPEMD-160 - could they be used as a start?\n\nYes, they could and yes, I would have saved a bit of time if I came across your set earlier >_>\nI'll add RIPEMD-160 container headers to the test suite, thanks!. > replace the smart match operator with a normal function\nDone.\n\nIs the pygost working with pip3 as well?\n\nIt is, but since the python code is executed with python2 -c, pip2 should be used indeed.

The ODF 1.2 standard does not require a specific iteration count beyond the 1,024 default. The parser expects anything between 1,000 and 999,999. The current LibreOffice version uses 100,000, that is why I choose it as the benchmark constant.\nUpdated the PR & rebased on current master (09ec2a9).. Update:\n- use perl modules instead of python code in the test suite\n- complete test suite with proper verify and passthrough branches\n- remove support for hash suffix generated by libreoffice2john.py\nRebased on current master (0db6913).. You are right, we don't need python code here. That's the just code I used while writing the kernel, and since I am not a perl monk I wrote it in python. But I have to rewrite this anyway, because right now there is no way to properly use the verify function.\nBtw the last time I commited python code to the test suite was because of Streebog hashing. Didn't find anything on CPAN for that either.. That's what I initially did. Afterwards I added the suffix buffer to ensure a better UX; you can take the output of libreoffice2john.py and throw it at hashcat without editing. But if this is not required, then I actually would be glad to get rid of the suffix! Simplifies the parsing.\n@jsteube, what will it be?. I'd be happy to use FIXED_LENGTH (like I did for the 2048 chars of ciphertext at the end), but the tokenizer will automatically omit the separating * only if I use VERIFY_LENGTH. Or I am missing something?. Done! :D. @s3inlc, ouch! :laughing:\nGH-1821. Well, the tests for 18500 run just fine. It was the 18400 case branch that took the hit :sweat_smile: . ",

    "mastercracker1": "Not in my case.  Version 4.2.1 does not display any information about the GPU temps when --gpu-temp-disable is activated:\n\nHere's what I get with 5.0.0:\n\nThe definition of --gpu-temp-disable in the help is \"Disable temperature and fanspeed reads and triggers\".\n . I did not include it but when the temperature of the GPU #3 goes above  80\u00b0C, it starts adding yellow lines with the Driver temperature threshold met... message (in v5.0.0 only).  The information from the status display quickly become out of sight and you see only lines of the warning message.  I have MSI afterburner running in the background that keeps charge in throttling the card when it goes above 80\u00b0C.  Without it, it would go way above 80\u00b0C.  That's constant for both hashcat version so it's not an effect of a higher utilization of the card.. I am definitely not against seeing the GPU temps all the time.  It's just the continuous stream of lines saying \"Driver temperature threshold met...\" that is annoying.  There I can think of 2 options but I don't know if they are implementable.  1) Instead of having the \"Driver temperature...\" message.  Change the color of the line showing the temperature (or the temperature value only) to a different color (yellow or red). 2) When the temperature is reached, push the whole status display and the warning line.   I think the first option would be the best or I am open to other suggestions.  Worst case scenario revert to old behavior.. Yes it's a fast algo but I am in the desired case you described with > 150k salts.  Maybe I don't understand some concept enough.

    "0age": "Hey, jumping in here - asked @GuthL to lend his expertise and he knew the right place to look for answers :)\nBasically, the challenge can be broken up into three steps that would all be executed in parallel:\n Construct a payload that is exactly 85 bytes long, with a 41-byte static \"header\", a 12-byte variable search-space \"body\", and a 32-byte static \"footer\", that will serve as the input to keccak256 (this seems to be supported out-of-the-box via an appropriate mask)\n Take a keccak256 hash of that payload (e.g. using hash mode 17800)\n Drop the first 12 bytes from the resultant hash to get the 20-byte address, then count the number of zero bytes in that address; if there are five or more, write the input to stdout or a file (this step is the generally problematic one)*\nLooking at the kernel you referenced (this is the one, correct?), are you referring to COMPARE_S_SIMD in m00100s? Where might I find more information about how to configure the pattern to match against?\nThank you for taking a look at this! . One more quick followup question: I can successfully run ./hashcat -m 11111 -b after building your forked branch, as well as very specific searches like ./hashcat -m 11111 -a 3 f000111122223333444455556666777788889999, but attempts to utilize a mask / filter command all seem to fail. What would a proper command actually look like? Thanks!. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but it seems as though the hash you use to match against is basically disregarded for this particular mode. I think I've figured out how to apply a mask, but have run into a more fundamental issue: There's no \"Pure OpenCL kernel\" available (and appears as though the same is true for 17800 / keccak256) and the optimized kernel has a maximum password length that is too short (55 < 85).\nHowever, it does look like the optimized 17800 kernel also makes a salt available, up to length 51, but 17800 doesn't seem to support salts - if the salt could be applied directly to the password in raw-hashing mode, that could be used as one work-around. Otherwise, how feasible would it be for me to try and extend the supported password length in the optimized kernel?\nHere's the command I'm running on your branch:\n./hashcat -a 3 -w 3 -m 11111 --outfile-format=4 -o out.txt --hex-charset \\\n  0000000011111111222222223333333344444444 \\\n  'ffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcccccccccccc?b?b?b?b?b?bdddd' # still needs 30 more bytes!\nThanks again and let me know if there's a more appropriate forum for this line of inquiry..

However my problem is not the case above.\nI digged more deeply into the code and made some (very ugly) hacks (sry...) by hard-code a 2000x larger plain-text buffer. Now it works like charm :)\nI'm using a 5-digits (20 bits) SHA256-prefix, so the expectation of the collision rate will be 1 of 2^20.\nOn my K80: 13 * 256 * 512 * 128 / 2^20 = ~208 results per kernel invocation (consistent with experiments). Thus, I think 2000 should be more than enough.\ncommit. ",

The benchmark was the easiest way and doesn't require to provide a hash.\nThe machine was a brand new install. There was nothing but the base OS on it. Then I installed the Intel driver, then I downloaded hashcat and ran it and the issue happened. As you can see with the version number, it fits the requirement mentioned on hashcat.net (I verified this before reporting).\nI've done such install multiple times in the past without any issues on various machines, so I know this is the right driver and this is the first time it happened.\nI forgot to mention the kernel version: 4.18.0-10-generic. I ran hashcat in a VM on a 6700HQ just fine, on a few systems on AWS just fine and I thought running on this high-end Xeon would work.\nBeing a recent CPU according to ARK and my previous experience with hashcat on Intel CPU, I would assume hashcat would have given me a different output screen than the one I got when running hashcat -I as shown above if it wasn't supported.. This server/instance is headless. What other OpenCL application should I run? Hashcat is the only one I can think of.\nAnything else I should run on this? What I mean is that this is a VPS and I got to start an instance every time I need to test something..

    "c0d3z3r0": "@philsmd I always use hashcat with --outfile-autohex-disable.\n\nI think it's more correct to use the last occurrence, because some hash types have \":\" within the hash line because of the salt etc\n\nDamn. You are right, I just tested this with salted SHA1 (120)...\nI will try to find another solution... one idea would be using something like ::: or ;;; or :*: as separator but this would maybe impact performance for big pot files. Another solution could be reverting $HEX for --show. I think the latter one is the correct way. What do you think?. > my response to this is that we shouldn't mix up outfiles with potfiles and that potfiles should (and do!) always use the $HEX[] notation, as it is also needed!\nACK. Didn't realized that before...\n\nI don't think changing the separator etc is a good idea.\n\nACK\n\nI think it's only a problem on your site because you are using outfiles as potfiles, aren't you ?\n\nNo, I don't. Example: I throw LM hashes on hashcat (using --potfile-path test.pot). Those hashes are splitted into two parts and cracked seperately. Then I use hashcat ... --show. The outfile/output then contains passwords with $HEX[...].\nWhat I'd like to have is an option to get those $HEX stuff decoded in the outfile/output.\nFor e.g. NTLM hashes I dont' use --show, since the full passwords go to the outfile. Here I use --outfile-autohex-disable.\nUnfortunately --outfile-autohex-disable does not work with --show.. ",
    "waliedyassen": "I apologize, I've updated the C implementation to match the one in the Java function, they both output identical results now.. This algorithm is widely used to hide the string content in a obfuscated code, and when reverse engineering, it could take huge amount of time to reverse a single string on the CPU, and by implementing it in hashcat, it makes the process go quite faster to retrieve the string content in that code.\nThe obfuscated code usually comes with many strings (could be in thousands), so using the CPU to crack all of those is really painful and time consuming.. That's correct, you could collide them pretty easily, but it's unlikely when dealing with file names or other names, which they use to hide in the most of the cases.\nHowever, you could tell which one is the correct/wanted one by telling which one makes more sense, let's say debug.txt and OwinxTU collide for the sake of giving an example, it would be obviously for the person who's trying to crack it that the first result is the one we are looking for.. The collision can be minimised to very little or none by using a related words list for a dictionary or a hybird attack/cracking.\nRegarding the examples, there is plenty of Java applications that do this to hide their file names, such as the RuneScape file storage system, you can click here to see an example of reversing some of these names.. As for the 64-bit version of this algorithm, I would say it is really unnecessary to implement as it is very uncommon to come across, don't see a need for it as of now.\nHowever, as for the optimisations, I am quite unaware on how to handle that properly..

I've just checked v5.1.0 release and it is OK, so the commit I'm looking for is somewhere after v5.1.0.. It was commit bfdeb6e 'Move test_instruction() to opencl_ctx_devices_init()' from Mar 2, 2019.. That's because the problem was Intel, not nVidia.
