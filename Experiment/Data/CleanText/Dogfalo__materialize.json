Depends on the instructions of the core team.\nIt can use json to generate contents (text) and serve the content with angular via ajax for example or use a server-side language since they have already a domain, and I think they have already a host, so, there are many alternatives many approaches.\n. Understood!\nIf you need some help with spanish translation just contact me.\n. excellent! \n. Well, I'm working on the spanish translation, @ConsoleTVs I think we can divide the  docs to speed up the translation, but the main docs are changing constantly, so we should take that issue into account .\nWhat @marcosbergamo suggests maybe could handle the problem of translating to multiple languages, but the core team has the last word on this, so let's wait for some reply from the core team.\n.

I'm using browserify with materialize in my project and it works great!\nIf you are using npm to install materialize then just require materialize as if you were using a node.js module (Note: this should works,  but I haven't used it in this way.).\njs\n...\nrequire('materialize-css');\n...\nAnother way is using bower to install materialize, this is the way I'm using it, but you need to use browserify-shim. I'm using grunt to automate some tasks and also using grunt-browserify.\nThis is how I'm using materialize with browserify:\nMy package.json looks like this:\njs\n{\n  \"name\": \"myapp\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"bower\": \"^1.4.0\",\n    \"browserify\": \"~5.10.1\",\n    \"browserify-shim\": \"^3.8.1\",\n    \"grunt\": \"^0.4.5\",\n    \"grunt-bower-clean\": \"^0.2.2\",\n    \"grunt-bower-task\": \"^0.4.0\",\n    \"grunt-browserify\": \"^3.2.1\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-clean\": \"^0.6.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-cssmin\": \"^0.10.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-sass\": \"^0.8.1\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-uglify\": \"^0.6.0\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n   //some deps\n  },\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"jquery\": \"./bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\",\n    \"materialize\": \"./bower_components/materialize/dist/js/materialize.min.js\"\n  },\n  \"browserify-shim\": {\n    \"jquery\": \"$\",\n    \"materialize\": \"materialize\"\n  },\n  \"browserify\": {\n    \"transform\": [\n      \"browserify-shim\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\npay attention to \"browser\": { ... }, \"browserify-shim\": { ... } and `\"browserify\": { ... }\nMy js file in ./public/src/js/main.js looks like\njs\nvar $ = require('jquery');\nrequire('materialize');\n...\nAnd lastly my Gruntfile.js looks like:\n``` js\nmodule.exports = function(grunt){\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    pkg : grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),\n    bower : { //bower tasks },\n    browserify : {\n      app : {\n        files : {\n          './public/dist/js/main.js' : ['./public/src/js/main.js']\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    ... \n  });\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-bower-task');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-browserify');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-bower-clean');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-cssmin');\ngrunt.registerTask('default', ['bower:install', 'browserify', 'uglify', 'cssmin']);\n};\n```\nThen just do $ grunt or $ grunt browserify and insert the script on your project:\nhtml\n...\n<script src=\"./public/dist/js/main.js\"></script>\n...\nThen materialize should be working, hope this helps :)\n. require('materialize-css'); It will only include the *.js file from materialize, you will still need to include the css file by your own on your project.\n. @StrikeForceZero unfortunately I don't have a open source project with this configuration, but if you want, you can share your repo and I can help you to get it works.\n. @StrikeForceZero unfortunately I don't have a open source project with this configuration, but if you want, you can share your repo and I can help you to get it works.\n. +1\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n.

So one possible reason that you are not seeing this font rendering issue on internal sites with Roboto is because we are using Roboto 2.0 (http://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/roboto-noto-fonts.html).\nI am thinking that this font rendering issue is due to the fact that DirectWrite rendering as introduced in Chrome 37. This significantly changes the appearance of text in the browser. Here are some examples illustrating the difference (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=395528).\nWe will continue monitoring this issue and hopefully determine whether or not this is something we can fix on our end.\nThanks again for your feedback!\n.

Hey,\nThere are likely two problems here:\n- our .82 release does not have datepicker included\n- the datepicker needs to be initialized through js (I will update this in the docs)\nIs the demo at least working for you?\n. Sorry about the inconvenience, I'll update the docs later today!\n. We won't be adding this for now as there are already many quality plugins online.\n. You can put them all into a function then run it using one line:\nSomething like this would work, which you would then call in a similar fashion as you stated above\nvar initializeAll = function() {\n    $('.dropdown-button').dropdown({\"hover\": false});\n    $('ul.tabs').tabs();\n    $('.tab-demo').show().tabs();\n    $('.parallax').parallax();\n    $('.modal-trigger').leanModal();\n    $('.tooltipped').tooltip({\"delay\": 45});\n    $('.collapsible-accordion').collapsible();\n    $('.collapsible-expandable').collapsible({\"accordion\": false});\n    $('.materialboxed').materialbox();\n    $('.scrollspy').scrollSpy();\n    $('.button-collapse').sideNav();\n    $('.datepicker').pickadate();\n}\n. nope\n. It's possible you are using an older release version, how did you download materialize?\n. Bower actually gets the older v0.82 release, where form labels did not animate. If you want you can grab a new version from github which will have the animations.\n. No problem! I'm glad you find it useful!\n. also take a look at #145\n. Not positive on lowest version needed, but it compiles on sass-3.4.6+\nAlso confirmed working with compass-1.0.1\nAlso make sure your compiler isn't trying to compile every file.\n. Good point, thanks!\nFixed in b045f651ceea0dd7631c7b131f3404583fca6863\n. I'll look into this, thanks for reporting it to us.\n. Hmm could you just call the init functions inside the Template.rendered callback? \n. fixed in 12345fb\nThis should be handled.\n. fixed in 12345fb\nThis should be handled.\n. Hey,\nWe do not yet have a good way of initializing forms dynamically. This is a problem we will fix.\n. fixed in 12345fb\n. fixed in 12345fb\n. Well the problem is that although we made incompatible API changes, I don't want to actually go above v1.0 because its still alpha. There was also a large version jump because we made a ton of changes even though we did not have a formal release\n. The problem is related to having col s2 on the individual tabs. If you want your tabs lie on the grid, it is better to add a col s4 on your tab-sub-menu\n<div class=\"row\">\n   <div class=\"tab-sub-menu col s6\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n         <ul class=\"tabs\">\n            <li class=\"tab\">\n               <a class=\"waves-effect waves-dark\" href=\"#Something1\">Something1</a>\n            </li>\n            <li class=\"tab\">\n               <a class=\"waves-effect waves-dark\" href=\"#Something2\">Something2</a>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n      </div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n. Great! Also your site is looking nice! When you are finished with it, can you provide us with the URL so we can put it on our Showcase?\n. Thanks, I'll keep an eye on it.\n. Try using this for now, while we work on fixing it.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/b6naew9h/3/\n. For now we're going to only support buttons using the markup in the JSFiddle above.\nDocumentation added in  3fab0c59198b8e9d8709c38adc25d2c4eda576cd\n. That is odd, being inside a modal should not affect most of these elements. We will look into this.\n. Fixed in 1aba58fbb43081e263a5c1264356cf774579ec48\n. We incorporated a lot of your changes among fixing other things. Good stuff here.

I don't think that there needs to be one function that reloads all the components, that would just be bad for performance. When you're using dynamic templating systems like Angular or Spacebars in Meteor, you would want to only initialize what is necessary and you can do this by calling the init function again in a .rendered callback\n. I don't know what cause this to happen, but we didn't change the button implementation. Just try check that you didn't change line-height somewhere.\n.

Should be fixed by 49db61bc679970e215c5769e0668f924157b5d10\n. Can someone confirm that this is fixed by testing the build in bin/? That way we can have this fixed for next build.\n. How are you changing tabs using jQuery?\n. Why are you applying your own click handler?\n. Just use the function we provide in the tab documentation. Or you can trigger a click on the tab element. \n. If you are just trying to change tabs, you should be using $('ul.tabs').tabs('select_tab', 'tab_id')\n. What I am saying is that instead of adding a class=\"active\" to change tabs, you should be using the method I stated above. This will add active as well as show the content.\nAdding class=\"active\" only works when tabs is initialized. There is no event to monitor the adding of classes\n. This can be changed on a per-app-basis by the developer\n. Can you post code, we can't debug it either wise.\n.

It's mainly IE, even in the newer 10+ versions, that has issues with it.

We realize we messed up the versioning for the early releases. Also I think it's adherent enough now. In alpha any minor version increment will mean that there are either significant additions to the framework or incompatible implementation changes.\n. This is one of the newer features, so we will have to work on some enhancements/customization options. However it would be more helpful if your issue/feature request was more specific.\n.

A script in the bottom will be run when it is parsed, in meteor, if you generate it dynamically, it will most likely be created after the <script> is run. So the fix is to run this code when you generate the date picker.\n. If you don't want the animation, just add class=\"active\" to the labels.\nI don't know what you mean by bookstore.\nDon't have a release date for 1.0.0, but it will happen when we think it is time.\n. Fixed in 50399b1\n. This has been fixed in the dev builds, but right now you will just have to remove theoverflow:hidden\n.

This is an MVC framework, I don't see how it is meant as a replacement for JQuery. In any case we have no plans to switch.\n. Why can't you just write CSS to override it? It is better than having all the content push down on it by default.\n. I think this would be up to the developer. Some may want it there, some may not.\n. Thanks!\n.

We can't handle every possible scenario.

Range slider has a few bugs which are already being tracked. These are not issues relating to the android browser.\n. I guess it is just due to 4.3. These all work on my android browser with 5.0\n.

Add\n\nCSS\n  .side-nav li a {\n    color: #444;\n    display: block;\n    font-size: 1rem;\n    height: 64px;\n    line-height: 64px;\n    padding: 0 15px;\n  }\n. You likely have some scripts trying to run on null objects. In any case, I don't think this is a materialize problem.\n. This was an error message created by velocity which was removed in 1.0 alpha so this issue is deprecated. @shardy613 Please read my comment above. This is something that would need to be fixed in the Velocity library, which may or may not happen: https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/issues/305\nEither way, we will not be releasing additional fixes for 0.100.2, please look into upgrading to 1.0.0-beta.. While there are still some things we need to iron out, we do believe that 1.0.0-beta is in a more stable state than the old version (0.100.2), purely from the large number of bugs fixed. In addition, it is easier to use form a developer standpoint, especially inside Single Page apps.\nPlease refer to the upgrade guide if you are interested in upgrading: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/v1-dev/v1-upgrade-guide.md. This is because of how modals work, a fixed element within a fixed element will make it fixed within the other. Expanding the modal is the best solution.\nThe other is to take position absolute off .picker and position: absolute off .picker__holder and make .modal overflow: visible;\n. The fix right now would be to have some js run to reparent the form to the body, don't know if this breaks the event handlers on the element. \n. @brugnara I wasn't actually aware this option existed. In that case, this should fix the problem. Thanks for pointing that out!\n. Fixed since 5b5ba8627cdb7670924e871e15c1e85dfa2652cb\n. Fixed in 90afeb0070d7270efe72f3edfbca712e7abec156\n. The color class overrides any hover style. You can add back the :hover style manually, or add this magic to allow buttons of any color to retain their hover effect.\n``` CSS\n.btn {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n.btn:hover:before {\n  opacity:1;\n}\n.btn:before {\n    content: '';\n    opacity: 0;\n    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.6);\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    left: 0;\n    top: 0;\n    transition: opacity .2s;\n    z-index: -1;\n}\n```\n. We've fixed this, will be in next release\n. You have to change the sass file or we can't merge it\n. You have to change the sass file or we can't merge it\n. You modified a compiled file instead of the source, so we made the change manually.\n. Fixed in the latest release.\n.

We're looking into the issue, I've discovered that adding a padding to the last child seems to solve the problem. But we'll see what we can do to fix this on Firefox.\n. This is fixed now\n. We were testing out some new ways to retain hover color in buttons, but we've reverted to the old style. If you can confirm that this no longer happens, we will close this issue. Thanks.\n. We've fixed this already, but it is not live.\n. it probably won't work because col doesn't have a height inherently.\n. Its just a old style that we had in our site style and not in materialize. I removed it however, cdfd35a0b8500839760f49da1a1cb67b26310f5d\n. Use Sass to customize colors\n. Similar to before, use Sass to customize colors\n. See this\n. I'm not sure what requestjs is, but doing this will break a lot of functionality for most users.\n. Add an ID to the original select, then add a change handler to it in Meteor. I have a Meteor app myself in which I do this.\n. I am unsure of how to manually update libraries inside Meteor, but maybe someone more knowledgable about Meteor can help\n. We don't use waves-circle. We've modified waves. See the documentation on how to use waves on circular buttons.\n. Thanks for clarifying with a picture.\n. I don't think this is something we want to do. The more material way to do this is definitely in a sidenav. Although you can use other js plugins to add this behavior.\n. Fixed in 0fe3a1a22760b8754293a15e55467c3a29f24634\n. In the next release, dropdowns will appear as a child of their activator.\n. This would be adding lot of page weight for classes that will be used very rarely. I don't think this is would be used enough to warrant adding this many lines.\n. Looks good. Thanks!\n. Looks good.

The width change is actually keeping the width the same because of the removal of the scroll bar. I think the way it is now is actually good as it will prevent any janky page reflows and won't shift page content.\n. This problem is resolved now as the font is being hosted on CDNJS at the right path\n. I advise using the chrome inspector to get the specific CSS selectors for this. Then use a button\n<button data-target=\"modal1\" class=\"btn\">Modal</button>. This is done to leave the choice for the developer to enforce a hard limit during typing or to allow typing of the limit while warning the user.. The body width is no longer set while modal is opened in v1-dev. See my comment here: #3108. I really don't think this is necessary. Seeing as we do not modify the fonts in any way, they are being updated independently of us, and the fact that Materialize does not require the use of a specific icon font, it makes sense to keep them separate. Developers who require local hosting can download the fonts themselves from Google.\n. It has been added already.

You can apply stopPropagation() or preventDefault() on any element yourself . As @VeeK727 said, you should only be applying the change event handler to the original select.

It is a breaking change, but it isn't changing fundamental about the framework, just renaming some of the option names.

Agree with @thorncorona here. Agree with @thorncorona here. This has been fixed on master branch. As this framework is geared towards providing good user experience through material design.

Most likely you have included materialize.js more than once. \nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4155. You need to initialize it as shown in the documentation. Is this happening for you if you trigger it on the materialize website? When I ran the code pen, it only showed a 4px difference. This is just because it is loading through the CDN I think, if you download it and use it in your project it wont happen. not happening on http://materializecss.com/. must have unique ID's.

We aren't looking to support RTL in the near future as this is a large undertaking which will require maintenance. You are misunderstanding the spec, the radial reaction isn't tied to screen size, but the type of interaction pointer used. According to the spec, it should appear when it is triggered through touch interaction and is not necessary in desktop mouse interaction.\nHowever while this interaction is technically the correct way of implementing it, I don't like complicating things with JavaScript when the deviation from the spec here is not largely detrimental.. I am open to the idea of having more maintainers who have had a good history of contributions.. To be completely honest with you @tomscholz , it's a mixture of laziness on my part and a general disenchantment in the many PR that I've come across. At one point I kept coming across PR that modified the compiled HTML, JS, or CSS file and it really started to annoy me. But in the end it's no excuse to ignore PR's of course\nIt would be great if someone is willing to go through the old issues and PR and aggressively close the ones that are no longer relevant or duplicates. I see you have been really active as of late Tom, let me know if you want to help in this regard.. This is a separate concern, but I think maybe we would just add them to git ignore but leave them where are currently are. that would change the github pages routing no? wouldn't it solve the problem already if the master branch didn't contain the compiled files?. We own it, we were just squatting it in case we needed it.. @tomscholz please send me an email so we can exchange a few words.. I think component labels isn't necessary. Probably used at Google because they have different people manage different components. Lets discuss on Gitter. Finally finished up last batch of changes. Thanks everyone for the work you put in and for your patience.\nPlease give it a try and file bug reports :smile: . I think this is pretty standard as it is no different from any other input.. Would recommend adding disabled attribute to the option then updating the select.. You can just apply the class to the <hr> tag. I think it is fine to leave it as is.. Fixed in v1-dev. We haven't really had a problem with conflicts in Grunfile.js. . http://fiddle.tinymce.com/6Ufaab/1. The translations won't be updated immediately, Transifex has a manual push process that I perform once in a while. Thanks for helping out.. Fixed in v1 dev here: 15c729caa694f256054ce5a857df70db55bbba22. Updated in v1-dev. Won't be adding this to current releases. Don't think these are that useful as you can do something very similar add a keyup handler and check the input itself or the class we've added. @tomscholz  @DanielRuf  Have you checked out the branch to test it yourself?. We don't want to add polyfills for this, so when support for this improves we will consider supporting it. userView has been removed. I add new languages when there is enough contributor demand so that the entire translation does not depend on just one person. In any case I accepted your request for a Hebrew translation since you are so motivated, in addition I made you a coordinator for the language so you can invite people who you think will help with the translation effort for the language.. ShowStaggeredList has been removed in v1-dev. Probably a bit out of scope of the framework in this case. Plugins like masonry deal with this problem. Maybe I am not fully understanding what you are talking about, but this doesn't like an option that promotes good UX if the user is not able to edit their own form by deleting chips they created. Currently type=\"text\" should be used with the datepicker. Fixed in v1-dev. https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/5004. You removed inconsolata. We do want to improve on this; possibly renaming some of the more ambiguous classes into something more materialize specific, but it's still a bit out there on the timeline. Thanks for giving feedback.. Not a fan of the not-allowed cursor change, it's jarring and unnecessary. Although there is nothing in the spec about it, MDC-web and angular material also do not do this. First line probably unnecessary.\nAlso link the contributing document whenever referenced, otherwise, lgtm. Issue template looks good, please add that in. Changed jquery spec to ^2.1.4 for the time being. See 8555d1497906fb0867453eadf0d612d90e0b6dda. There is a current bug, where the <i> tag interferes with the modal button\nsee: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4987\nWe will have a hotfix release out soon\nAdd pointer-events: none to the <i> element to temporarily fix this bug. Buttons should only be one line. This happens because you have 3 separate collapsibles. separate collapsibles don't close each other, they open/close <li> within themselves. Time picker is already working, you just need to place label after the input.\nFor datepicker, I fixed the bug here: 016e251f. Time picker is already working, you just need to place label after the input.\nFor datepicker, I fixed the bug here: 016e251f.

A solution to this is to have a distribution of materialize without the colors. But in this case, this seems to be orthogonal to v1 . Added to the list. jQuery removal is no longer slated for v1.0.0.

Enhancements aren't priority right now and can be focused on later after the release.. Fixed here 7c7a9fd8062a18c17adabf6ae47edbe142bf8393. We're doing large rewrites on v1-dev branch.

This sounds like a general How-To question. Please search stack overflow. Most likely you have not initialized it. You should run use strict inside a function instead of applying it at a global level. We will be reworking Date Picker soon as well which will fix this issue.

Are you sure? The today button no longer exists in alpha 4. It will be changed in the next release then to be more similar to the one found on android phones. What is your intended behavior?. absolute positioned elements will not give their parent a height, this is seems to be related to CSS concepts rather than the framework. Searching on Stack Overflow will give you help on the topic.. I don't quite understand what you mean, but absolute elements are removed from the document flow so it so its parent has no height, just set a height on the parent if you want to achieve the result you want. Thanks!. Thanks!. Please read the issue guidelines. We aren't adding the alpha versions to meteor, we will likely add beta versions to meteor to have them tested before going to 1.0.

The selector for the dropdown that you're using is very broad, so it modifies the dropdown inside the select.. This is something that we're looking to improve on to remove any confusion on. . We aren't looking to drop IE 11 support just yet as its browser share is still relevant. When that happens we can make some of these changes.. You can also usedocument.querySelectorAll('.modal');orM.AutoInit(document.body). Lowered the distance threshold from 50% to 20% here: 22095e50ff96650115fbdb9b0e5b0d33a6a1adf5.\nTo make pulling in from the side easier requires a different set of changes since it requires some rework of the dragging system.. No plans for a angular wrapper, but we've created a angular materialize boilerplate. Still finalizing it, will likely be released alongside 1.0 stable. .

So this should still be fixed by 3ea4667aeb65e7f5edda170c05e09c79ea854026. Since datepicker relies on Modal, this is the same issue and will fixed upon next release.. @StephenChips You are right, the modal-action class is no longer used and I have removed it from the documentation in 8605f945dabb018e5ad0fe89ea419ce0c6791041. Yes, just change the width is css and it will work. Thanks @DanielRuf !. I'd estimate 1-2 months. . The bug is unrelated to the element being absolute positioned. The fix works in either case.. Try just callingWaves.displayEffect();after Materialize has been loaded. Use the endingTop option. As @apazacoder pointed out, the key is to put the internationalization options in thei18n` property of the options.. Hey @jpic,\nThanks for the continued sponsorship. This does seem like it would be helpful to have. We'll have to do some work to rework autocomplete so that it can handle both Dropdowns as well as multi selects. \nWhat are you imagining for the Ajax support? Let me know what you think of the below:\nA url option that takes either a url string or a function.\nURL string  (One time ajax call to populate autocomplete data):\nJavaScript\nurl: 'api/countries.json' \nFunction (A different response is received depending on the search phrase):\nJavaScript\nurl: function(phrase) {\n  return \"api/countries?phrase=\" + phrase;\n}, . This is not something we currently plan to support: #1892. What do you mean? You want a new release or you want us to stop using the next tag on releases?. This is currently the npm command that should be shown in the documentation on http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html. The next tag will be removed when 1.0 goes out of beta.\nnpm install materialize-css@next. It is also preferable to use the container option to allow the datepicker to show outside of the small modal. Please search existing issues.

Please fork this codepen and recreate your issue: https://codepen.io/Dogfalo/pen/qYqWOQ. I don't think I'm experiencing this issue, at least not to the extent that you are. I have a few suggestions of things you could try:M.Modal.init(elem, {preventScrolling: false});`\nThis will prevent page reflow on body and could help performance.\nbackface-visibility: hidden;\nAdd to .modal maybe will also help with transition performance.\nI see slight slowdown during animation, but don't see the slow scroll performance you describe.\n. It will be working in the release coming out today, it was added after the last beta release.. This sounds like an error in your project rather than in Materialize since we do not have any angular specific code. Please try to resolve the problem on your end or post to Stack Overflow..

This isn't something we want to add to the core library.. This isn't something we want to add to the core library.. Duplicate of #5884. On old versions, jQuery must be imported before materialize for it to work. Although I have no experience with Symfony and this would be a better question for Stack Overflow, I would guess that the asset pipeline through which you are including jQuery is causing the reordering of imports.. It's just a matter of perspective mainly. If you remove the box-shadow and overlay color, then it will seem as if the card has opened in the same area. Please search closed issues. This seems like something you should raise with fastclick. That is standard browser behavior. It actually is wrapping as you expect.

Yes we are. During the RC builds, we don't merge non-essential fixes. Since we have now released 1.0. We will merge PR's that are are clear in what they fix and also contain a codepen as an example of the current bug.. Can you create a Codepen that recreates the problem so we can take a look?. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Do you have an image illustrating the use case?. We can have it as an option, but won't be a default. No, sorry this isn't something we are looking to add.. You can't get instance from an array like object. Check what elems contains and pass in a single elem to get instance from. Sounds like you need to use the onOpenEnd option when you initialize the modal. We can't merge this as the checks are failing. Hey everyone, we're just having a small break after the big release for 1.0. We'll be doing some planing for upcoming changes and reviewing PR in the coming week..

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We needed to fix this anyways and we used your suggestion of using keydown as well. There was a bug in safari so we had to use a different method of auto resizing. The changes should be live on our docs site right now.\n. Do you have any code examples, browser versions or console errors? It's hard for us to recreate a bug like this so more information would be appreciated\n. It was a simple z-index issue.

Hello,\nFirst off we use Sass in development so just by that standard we can't merge a pull request that just changes the compiled css file.

We didn't make it a plugin because we didn't want it to be this flexible. We will work on making it easier to define the activator though.\n. Hmm.

So you can use headers by just adding the card-title class. Also if you have many cards on your page, you probably shouldn't be using H1s in all of them from a standards / seo perspective.\n. I made it so that only the card-title, or the card-image will trigger the card reveal. So anything else will no longer trigger it.\nFixed in fd8ba3dd6aa53c6382b84beed843ed7ad89b1ce7\n.

Have you tried using our modals? We have tested their interactions with our modals but we do not support any others.\n. Also you would have to override the color on the a tags. It won't inherit\n. Im not exactly sure, but at first glance it seems the first example is missing type=\"text\"\n. I've tried your code and I'm not sure what you are looking for. Are you talking about how half the image is cut off? The reason the slider needs a fixed height is to make the slides look uniform.\nYou are free to change it to your own custom height but without it, each slide will have different heights.\n. Oh, this was a bug fixed on master but is not yet released I think. Did you say it was working when you recently forked?\n. I wrote a javascript fix that detects the image width\n. Hmm, it could have something to do with the order of things loading. Maybe Wordpress adds the image after the javascript tries to correct the width. I'm not sure though\n. 1: According to Material Design principles, tabs should never be vertically aligned. If you cant fit tabs neatly in a mobile setting, you should use a different component to organize your content, like a Dropdown or something else.\n2: We will look into this\n. Its not currently in our documentation which I will fix but to you need to add the  waves-circle class to your circular floating buttons\n.

The issue here is because you still have s3 defined on your tabs, so the indicator is adjusting to the initial width. If you update those cols to have s4 it should work.\n. Hmm, can I see your code? I'm pretty sure we make the card reveal stretch to fit the card always.\n. Also we do not intend to make it close by clicking elsewhere on the screen because it doesn't interfere with any part of the page while it is open.

We'll think about this for the future, but for now the best way would be to write your own breakpoints in Sass.\n. You should take a look at how we compile our files and add it to the components.

Please be more specific. If you have a specific issue with the new breadcrumbs open an issue.\n. What does this mean? Do you want it so that both the sidenav and the page scrolls at the same time? Because that sounds a lot more counterintuitive.\n. I think its counterintuitive because the user may not always want to scroll both with one scroll. In the case of a side nav, these elements are usually separate enough that you should scroll individually. When you want to read more of the main content it scrolls, and if you want to see more options, the side nav scrolls.\nIf the two things are more interconnected I could see your point but in this case I don't.\n.

Duplicate Issue https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/361\n. At the moment it really depends on the dimensions and resolution of your image. For a fullscreen image it has to be a very large image for it to not look distorted\n.

This is fixed on master, try pulling to the latest and trying it again. It is not in the official release yet.\n. First off, your console test doesn't use the same amount of iterations. And second, the time saved is definitely negligible given the amount of times these parseInts are going to be called. I think its fine to stay with parseInts because they are definitely more legible and make the code more readable. . Are you on master? this is fixed on master. There are many commits that have changed dropdown so I didn't link any specific commit. Yes this is still an issue on the latest release but it will be fixed when we push the next release.\n. Sorry this slipped through the cracks. I just added it in a simple commit: 67c93cf\n. Thanks for letting us know.\n. This will happen when you put many columns into a single row with many different heights. To make things work perfectly and divide into the different number of columns, the height needs to stay constant.

We are working on releasing a new version today\n. Can you make a codepen showcasing the issue?\n. Its because you have the class materialize-textarea on the inputs. That is what ties in the auto resizing textarea feature so adding it to your inputs causes odd effects.\n. Just add a margin-left property onto your input-field div\n. These btn classes are using standard dimensions. If you want to make buttons that fall outside these I would recommend adding your own custom classes on top to override our height.. Thanks for the solution. But in your pull request you only changed the compiled css and not the Sass.

This is not an iPad specific problem, just a screen size related problem. \nI've adjusted the height values to better adapt to multiple sizes in b6d5f86\n. can you post some code where this bug occurs? it would help us to write into our test cases\n. We do not currently support flexbox but we do want to create an alternative grid system that uses flexbox in the future.\n. Fixed in 37c9d7941d6fa0b1a35e055b70d34e6afe634e4c\nIf you don't want to remove overflow: hidden yourself, materialbox will now look for ancestors with overflow hidden and remove that attribute and then reset them to their original overflow when you exit out of the materialbox.\n.

Why do you have a random div wrapping the icon? remove that and it works fine.\n<a class=\"waves-effect waves-light btn\"><i class=\"material-icons left\">cloud</i>working</a>\n<a class=\"waves-effect waves-light btn\"><i class=\"material-icons left\">cloud</i>not working</a>\n. Well if you style that root node differently it can work. Does it have to be a div? If you replace it with a span it will work. Basically that node has to have display: inline\n. I'd like to keep this open. I still want to get to this in the future. What exactly do you mean by scrollable navs? Our tabs now can scroll horizontally if the container has a fixed width.\n. Can you post more code or a demo? I'm not sure where exactly youre getting the error.\n. Well the point of a clearfix is not to put it on the container. A clearfix is supposed to be an empty div after your content you want to give height that is floated content. \n<form name=\"todoForm\" class=\"card-panel\">\n        <div class=\"input-field\">\n            <i class=\"fa fa-pencil-square-o prefix\"></i>\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"todoNote\" placeholder=\"todo something\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"right\">\n            <button class=\"btn waves-effect\">\n                add\n            </button>\n            <button class=\"btn waves-effect red lighten-2\">clean</button>\n            <button class=\"btn waves-effect green\">confess</button>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n    </form>\nThat should work as intended.\n. Are you talking about an expanding text field? Because our textareas auto resize\n. Fixed in 02cf1dc\n. If you have a tags within those li.tab's then you need to put the teal-text class on that. \n. With a pull request of this size it would be very helpful to have some code examples or docs to go along with this. Once these are made I can take a closer look at it and the code. But auto complete ui sounds like something we'd love to add\n. This is looking good! I can try looking into some of the bugs and help polish some of the styles for the eventual merge into master.\n. Looking at this PR again. Because it is rather large, it would be better if you separated this out into 2 pull requests. 1 For images in select, and 1 for autocomplete. This way bugs for either feature won't hold up the submission of the other. \n. thanks!\n. I've added this here 7e0c265808cb8d6d27cba6555fa081ef94ff86b3. This allows for scrolling thru the tabs with touch or mouse but has no arrows yet. This is not in the latest release yet, but will be in the next.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Yeh, I don't remember the reason for not taking off overflow hidden. I've removed it for now but if it causes problems we may need to revert.\nc6d6788\n.

Tested locally, adding selected on a single option in a multiple select works, Adding multiple selected does not. (Will look into other issues mentioned by TyrionGraphiste) TODO\n2. ~~Images in select were just added and we wanted to release as soon as possible so it will be done in the future. TODO~~\n3. Tested locally, if you do a .val() on the actual original select element, it will give you the correct value. You can also set the value on the original select element. Just make sure you are setting to the correct value. On our examples, our values are [1,2,3].\n. Multiple select has been refactored and many bugs have been fixed in ec94158e750156c94ef8303dbf2245271e25b7b0. Coming soon in V1. This is because we removed the default overflow: hidden on cards. You can fix this manually right now by adding overflow: hidden onto your cards.\nI also fixed this in 19965b3\n.

You shouldn't edit bin/materialize.js directly because this is a generated, compiled file. You could probably find a better place to put it in global.js or something and then compile it into bin.\n. Oh, I see. Yeh, adding it to jquery.easing isn't the best idea either because if we want to update it it will be lost. But looking at our compilation order, there really is no good place to put it atm. We'll have to think about this a little more I think.\n. Duplicate of #2265. There have been many issues opened about select if you wanna search them for solutions. Many people are using Materialize in a production ready way (checkout the showcase!).

I'm not sure what you are trying to do but this seems to be a css problem.\nFirst off, having overflow: auto won't make the dropdown extend past your max-height, but will instead make it scrollable to see the extra content. And second even if you tried to combine overflow-x: hidden with overflow-y: visible, It is a well known issue that this does not work.\nSo i'm not sure what kind of effect you are trying to achieve, but the way you are using overflows is what is causing the collapsible to not extend past its 150px max-height.\n.

I think the label should always be selectable and if it is only selectable in a specific state, that is confusing to the user. I understand that sometimes the user may select it when they tried to focus, but text highlight is very noticeable and understandable so I don't think its too much of a concern.. I agree with @fega.

I understand that sometimes the user may select it when they tried to focus, but text highlight is very noticeable and understandable so I don't think its too much of a concern.. Then it would never be selectable right? I think we just disagree here, and it seems like you could easily use some custom css to achieve this on your own project.. Then it would never be selectable right? I think we just disagree here, and it seems like you could easily use some custom css to achieve this on your own project.. On mobile you need meta tags to stop the window from resizing. Codepen won't do it so using the chrome inspector probably won't work but if you just reduce the window size it should work. If you actually try it on a phone it should work too.\nLook into meta tags like:  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n. Finally fixed in b731cf0.

Do you have the right meta tags for mobile?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Merged thanks!\n. Why do you have changes to our dist folder? Can you clean this up and make sure you only make changes to the sidenav.js file and compile to bin/materialize.js only.\nAnd you can keep your documentation changes\n. Yes this was definitely a bug on our part, not sure how that happened. \nFixed in bc257335f5259966125444e78e624b7b71a4c78b\nThanks for pointing this out\n. Please post a more comprehensive example\n. Can you post the code that is causing the error I mean\n. Fixed in e8b16c6\n. Merged\n. Try\n$('.modal-trigger').leanModal({ready: function() {\n  $('ul.tabs').tabs('select_tab', 'test1');\n}});\n. The point of using display none is so that things can reorder. It should be used in conjunction with our grid system. So for example something like:\n```\n\n\n```\nWould not just have some invisible div taking up space. If you are having problems with this do you mind sharing some code?\n. Fixed in d70c9fe\n.

Hmm the multiple select with opt groups seems to work here on the latest version: http://materializecss.com/test/html/forms.html\nCan you provide an updated codepen reproducing this issue?. Merged in PR\n. We now use data-length. Added into docs in 17d59100c517ec324e186e8b207dc5815d34229b\n. Fixed in 1090e81df399c2a6ae05eb1a8a347dcce152785b\n. What our truncate class does is cut content down to one line of text and if there is overflow, represent that overflow with an ellipsis. If the width of your p element is enough to contain all your content in one line it will still show. \nDo you have any code examples of where it isn't working?\n. Currently our checkboxes only work with the label in the exact structure we provide. (After the input)\n. That is not how push and pull work. If you are using more than 12 columns worth in a row, the rows are determined by order in the HTML structure. Push and pull are only used for rearranging in the same row\nIn what case would you need to switch 3 and 4? Would it not be achievable by simply switching them in your HTML?\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed in b7a1803a524650a0f2bc53991920b64627c07c9b\n. Can you post some sample code?\n. Please post more information / code examples to help flesh out your problem.\n. You did nothing wrong. If you want to put more than 12 cols worth inside a single row and want it to fit nicely you can achieve this with masonry. It is not something easily solved with just structure and layout\n. Thanks!\n. You could use our grid system and wrap your card div in a <div class=\"row\"></div>\n. Fixed. Fixed. Plugin rewritten. Plugin rewritten.

I'm not sure why you want to put a sidenav within a parallax container.\n. Did you make changes to the variables file? When you updated you may have overwritten that file causing the color changes.

This is less of a materialize issue and more of a css issue. As a framework we can't possibly support every combination of elements. Maybe try asking on stack overflow?\n. Good catch! Thanks for pointing this out\nFixed in 9d8cd80.\n. Duplicate of #3018. It is fixed on master\n. Thanks for finding and fixing this!\n. Not sure what you want exactly. please try to describe it in more detail\n. Can you post a code example? Our parallax tries to maintain the image in its natural resolution. You can tweak the width of the parallax img and the height of the parallax container but then you have to make sure that its dimensions will always fit in the container.\n.

You can use our grid system. Just make sure each item has the same height and it will naturally grid\n. Have you seen our tooltips? They will work on our fabs.\n. Setting the value with javascript doesn't trigger any of our functions. You can try adding the active class to the label when you set the value of the text field.\n. I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying the letter spacing is squished? because we don't change letter spacing in collapsible header. Can you post some code examples?\n. Your structure is close\ntry: \n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div\n```\nBecause you don't want to take the column out of the flow. So add a nested div inside and call pushpin on that instead\n. Hmm, the characterCounter function should have checks so that calling it twice on the same element won't mess things up. You could check for the character counter element before you do your manual call\n. You can change the radio color in our variables file. look for $radio-fill-color\n. I'm not sure what problem you are trying to describe here. Can you explain more?\n. Can you post your code? or a codepen\n. Can you post your code? The right position should only be negative if your tabs have overflow so your solution would break overflowing tabs.\n. How do you recreate the bug? I'm on the latest chrome mac and I dont see the problem\n. How exactly are you extending the grid? We use Sass loops to make all our grid classes so maybe you added something that is getting duplicated into all those classes.\n. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:indeterminate\n. Currently $(this) won't refer to anything because our callback is just called, not through any jQuery events. I am going to work on extending our callback to return with a parameter which is the current selected element.\n. Added in e3b8c7f8828803b068990dfe1195620a64f6e2ed.\nHere's how you would achieve what you want:\nvar options = [ {selector: '#myelement', offset: 200, callback: function(el) {\n  $(el).addClass(\"animated\")';\n} }, ]; Materialize.scrollFire(options);\n. Added xl in 104da64. Added xl in 104da64. Thanks!\n. Added in 1a7182b58f2d4896af0a2a5e47f738831e10b017\n. Added in 1a7182b58f2d4896af0a2a5e47f738831e10b017\n. This is because your l3 column only has a position fixed item in their giving it no height causing our grid to break. You can try setting the height of your l3 column to something greater than 0\n. This is because the tabs are initialized in a hidden object. To get the indicator to show reinitialize the tabs like: $('ul.tabs').tabs(); when you activate the modal\nTry something like this: \n$('.modal-trigger').leanModal({ready: function() {\n  $('ul.tabs').tabs();\n}});\n. Im not sure you understand how our columns work. If you stuff all these cols inside of a single row then this will happen. What exactly is the layout you want? \nAnd I don't think you ever described exactly what the bug is.\n. I'm sorry, but I still can't reproduce this locally even with your jsfiddle. Feel free to reopen if you can reproduce this on the latest version.. To be honest, I'm not sure who is hosting that link but we are not affiliated. Be sure to always use our site to get the most up to date documentation.\n. To be honest, I'm not sure who is hosting that link but we are not affiliated. Be sure to always use our site to get the most up to date documentation.\n. Where exactly did you find that link?\n. Why didn't destroy and create work? I don't think there is a good solution for changing the options manually at this time.\n. This has always been the case\n. There is a bottom property that you can set that defines where the pushpinned element stops. With some javascript you can calculate where your footer is from the top and use that as your bottom and it will stop before your footer.\n. Can you explain more what feature you are describing? Add some images or code examples to illustrate your point.\n. These inline styles top: 45px; left: 24px; are causing the problem. The fixed-action-btn is position: fixed and it has the initial properties right: 23px; bottom: 23px. By adding top and left you are defining a huge area. If you reset the right and bottom properties it will work.\n<div class=\"fixed-action-btn\" style=\"top: 45px; left: 24px; right: auto; bottom: auto;\">\n. Our pushpin plugin changes the positioning to fixed. Usually if things aren't styled strictly enough, this change in positioning will cause your element to look different. \nI've updated the docs to show how you can change the css classes to help fix this.\n. You can post on stackoverflow or try out our gitter\n. You didn't add the CSS from here: http://materializecss.com/footer.html#sticky-footer\n. Can you post your code? I would like to take a look\n. Have you tried using the latest version of master? I believe I fixed something similar to this but it is not in the current release yet.\n. This has been fixed on master and will be public in the next release. In the meantime you can try our latest version and see if that helps\n. We'll revisit duration on all of our plugins and probably have some form of in and out duration options. . This issue was fixed and merged c129dc1.\nIt will be public in the next release or you could download our latest version\n. Please put more effort into describing your issue. Have you tried recreating this issue with a codepen or a  jsfiddle where you can add these external libraries?\n. Thanks for this!\n. Thanks for this!\n. Initialize your modal with leanModal. openModal and closeModal are methods without options\n. Not sure if chrome recently changed anything but technically speaking, by standards the disabled property should only be used on input buttons. But because it used to work, i've added it as a supported attribute in c34a92f\n.

Can you post some code that reproduces this bug\n. I'm still unsure about the problem. The website seems to be working fine now? Can you post some code that reproduces this bug\n. I'm not too familiar with column-count. Have you tried using masonry with out grid to achieve the varied heights?\n. Thanks for pointing this out.\nFixed in ad28884\n. Thanks for pointing this out.\nFixed in ad28884\n. There are quite a few problems with your structure. The problem is only shown from the new version because there were some changes to the card-action class.\nThe main problem is that your form has a column class on it. Remove this and it should work. You should only use our column classes directly as a child of a row. Doing things like this will cause weird things to happen. In this case it made your form float: left without any clears. \n. Currently there is no javascript way to get the current index. But in the meantime you can get the active slide. The li tag will have an active class when it is the current slide\n. What is wrong with using the active class?\n. You can get the index from the active class with jQuery though. \nhttps://api.jquery.com/index/\nWould this not work?\n. How would you want it to handle those cases?\n. So there are cases where you would want the materialbox to be clipped in either the x or the y direction? The reason this code was added was so that materialbox could \"break out\" of any overflow type container.\n. Your codepen is using outdated materialize files\n. Duplicate of #3161\n. Currently there is not, but I would be open to a pull request \n. This has been added in e3b8c7f8828803b068990dfe1195620a64f6e2ed. It will be public in the next release. You can also download the latest and use it there\n. We try not to over style. There are cases where you'd rather the valign-wrapper inherit a height so I think its better to let the user define the height if needed.\n. Opacity is pretty simple to write your own css classes\n. This issue was fixed and merged c129dc1.\nIt will be public in the next release or you could download our latest version\n. @SmailyCarrilho If you can provide a working codepen that reproduces this issue on the beta, please open a new issue with the codepen link. Thanks\n. Please explain your problem more. I can't see the problem on that page\n. Duplicate #3161\n. Im not sure exactly whats happening but i've tested this locally and it is working. The height will be set dynamically by the plugin.\n. thanks\n. Sidenav is working fine. We have stopped supporting the old icon which is being used in your example. Checkout the icons docs for more information on how to switch over to the official icon font. \n. Can you post some code samples?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hmm why does React do that? Does htmlfor work the same as for by passing along focus?\n. But htmlfor doesn't actually pass focus does it? That's the reason we use it.\n. But htmlfor doesn't actually pass focus does it? That's the reason we use it.\n. Hmm, I'm not sure why this is happening. The masonry is definitely working because if you resize the page the masonry kicks in. So what exactly is almComplete?

These are links to an external site called lorempixel.com\nNothing we can do about it. It probably was down for a small period of time.\n. I'm not sure I understand you correctly, but I'm assuming you want to have multiple click to toggle FABs that will close others when you click them.\nInstead of removing the active class in the each loop, you can check if it's active and then trigger a .click() on it to close it.\n. You can nest an entire collapsible inside a collapsible like this:\n<ul class=\"collapsible\" data-collapsible=\"accordion\">\n    <li>\n      <div class=\"collapsible-header\"><i class=\"material-icons\">filter_drama</i>First</div>\n      <div class=\"collapsible-body\"><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p></div>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <div class=\"collapsible-header\"><i class=\"material-icons\">place</i>Second</div>\n      <div class=\"collapsible-body\"><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p></div>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <div class=\"collapsible-header\"><i class=\"material-icons\">whatshot</i>Third</div>\n      <div class=\"collapsible-body\">\n        <ul class=\"collapsible\" data-collapsible=\"accordion\">\n          <li>\n            <div class=\"collapsible-header\"><i class=\"material-icons\">filter_drama</i>First</div>\n            <div class=\"collapsible-body\"><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p></div>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <div class=\"collapsible-header\"><i class=\"material-icons\">place</i>Second</div>\n            <div class=\"collapsible-body\"><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p></div>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <div class=\"collapsible-header\"><i class=\"material-icons\">whatshot</i>Third</div>\n            <div class=\"collapsible-body\"><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p></div>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\nYou may have to write some custom css to make it look how you want\n. It's been a slow couple of weeks due to some summer vacations. We'll try and get a release soon when we come back.\n. This is something that would definitely be cool to add. There's still a lot on my plate right now and its holiday season for me so I would be open to a Pull Request if anyone wants to take a crack at styling this with checkboxes or radio buttons. \nOtherwise I can look into this when I can.\n.

We always welcome pull requests!\n. The z-depth classes don't actually set z-index. They are just describing the depth of the shadow. You can easily add your own css to the navbar and control the z-index\n. @kmmbvnr is correct\n. can you add some more details. Maybe some references to material design examples.

You need to post the link to your codepen for us to see it\n. Fixed in ebfa85e. \nIf you want to fix it now, you can move the entire ul#nav-mobile out of the nav. \n. Are you on the latest version? The callback element was added in 0.97.7\nOn the latest version it is already how you changed it\n. Can you post some code to help debug?\n. Well, it will be hard to debug without actually playing with something on my browser. But looking at the screen shots it looks like you have it inside a collapsible? If so this is probably causing issues if it is hidden when it is initialized. \nI will add callbacks to the collapsible plugin and then you can use these to make sure the carousel is rendered correctly on open\n. Added in 171a9ef.\nYou can now fix this problem by using the onOpen callback like this:\n$('.collapsible').collapsible({\n  onOpen: function(el) {\n    var carousel = el.find('.carousel');\n    if (carousel.length) {\n      carousel.trigger('carouselNext', [0.000001]);\n    }\n  }\n});\n. Do you have some example code? The value for the input in a tab should not be getting reset.\n. There is a note in the documentation saying if you dynamically set the text in a textarea you have to manually trigger the resize.\n$('#textarea1').val('New Text');\n$('#textarea1').trigger('autoresize');\n. Fixed in 2b32ca4.\nThanks for catching this!\n. Added draggable as a side-nav option in 8301f86\n. The Id's are actually intentional. It is to allow our labels to use the for attribute: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_label_for.asp\nWithout them, clicking on the label doesn't focus the input.\n. Fixed in 086ba34.

Is there any code example that can reliably reproduce this bug?\n. Yup I snuck it into another fix. Is everything working now?\n. You have set your navigation to be tabs which is causing this odd behavior. Remove the tabs class and it shouldn't hide your content anymore\n. Have you tried the latest master commit? Im pretty sure this was fixed\n. This is actually harder than it sounds to do, and adding these additional color classes is probably not worth it from a size / bloat standpoint. Have you tried using the sass variables?\n. Then I think just using plain css to override is your best option right now. The problem with making these color classes work with more specific cases is that it causes our css file to grow very large due to it needing to add css styles for each color in our large color palette.\n. I've been doing some local tests and I can't seem to find any issues with dynamic content? Can you make a simple codepen or something to demonstrate the issue?\nI've added a test page you can use to test scrollspy in f447ac6.

Our center class is only a text-align: center, so if you want to use it for anything other than text like block elements you will need to add inline-block.\nAs for the animation, I tried doing this locally and i'm not seeing any strange jumps.

I'm not sure I understand? We are triggering the change event because it is common. The change event is triggered when inputs are changed normally but not through javascript so we are triggering the same event to make it consistent with what you would expect.\n.

We do appreciate all the contributions we receive but by no means should you feel like it is mandatory. This issue itself is helping bring discussion and awareness to the bug.\n. Added open and close methods to collapsible in b6d3188. Can you post your code.\n. You should be placing the scrollspy class on the entire container for which you want it to recognize. Placing them on the titles will end up with very small areas where the scrollspy is active.\n. We are trying to minimize the amount of 3rd party libraries we rely on. But I agree this library is really helpful but I don't see why it would be necessary to include with the framework at this time.\n. Just override the css. BTW the margin bottom is on a bootstrap class and we don't recommend using both css frameworks together.\n. Are you talking about an iframe? Because you can look into those. Either way not really the right place to be discussing it. Try stackoverflow or our gitter chat.\n. If you just omit offset-s0, and leave offset-l4 offset-m3, This will happen. Our column sizes work by cascading upwards not downwards. \nSo if you only set an offset-s2, ALL sizes would inherit that offset. While if you set an offset-m2, only screen sizes MEDIUM and ABOVE would inherit that offset.\n. In the latest release the modal plugin was changed. Make sure you are on the current release, if you are on older versions then use openModal\n. Added a limit in 14de2a0.\nNot exactly a minLength, but it would fix any lag.

You have to take into account the width of your content when centering.\nSo to center something with a 3 column offset, that means your content needs to be 6 columns wide because it would need 3 columns on each side adding up to 12 columns. \nAlso if you are trying to center a fixed width, you don't need to use columns. You can use basic centering css like margin: 0 auto.

You can use basic centering css like margin: 0 auto. Well you are using 2 nested column classes. You should remove the inner one. And if you don't mind the size of the card being responsive then you don't need the margin, but if you want the card to be a fixed width, like you've set as 390px, then you should use the margin: 0 auto;.

There is no good way to detect changes like this. If the element is resized normally through a browser resize it will adjust. I think this is simply an edge case that we cannot cover.\nWhat you can do though, is whenever you do change properties like this programmatically, you can call .tabs() on your tabs element to recalculate the indicator position..

Have you tried using our grid system to create your 3 columns?. Our javascript files are all separated by file. You can simply just use the carousel.js file and it should work standalone. You may need to write some extra css or copy our css styles for the carousel to make it look the way it does in Materialize. Use the onShow callback to reinitialize the carousel. Something along the lines of:\n$('.tabs').tabs({\n    onShow: function() {\n      $('.carousel').carousel();\n    }\n  }). Not sure, when I add the code snippet to your codepen it works. Are you sure you are putting it in a document ready? Where you initialize all your other components?. This is because you are only instantiating the modal on the first button click? If you want to instantiate at the time of the click, just trigger an additional click on the modal after you initialize it but really you shouldn't be initializing it on every button click. Ideally you would initialize it right after you append the elements and only do it once.. can you explain how to reproduce your issue more? Maybe a codepen that can directly reproduce it.

The carousel currently does this, but the threshold for the horizontal movement is pretty low, so a downward angled swipe will often be misinterpreted as horizontal movement.

It is for jasmine testing. It is automatically generated so it should never be edited.. Hyphens are not a problem with ids. Make sure your trigger and your modal id match. Try recreating your issue in an isolated environment like a codepen to make sure it isn't something on your end.. What tests does it run exactly?. Your code is out of date. A couple versions back we changed the modal code to just be .modal(). Error and success messages have been decoupled from the label element in aa03660 on the v1-dev branch. These styling issues will be fixed for v1. Thanks!. Make sure you are including the css files in the right order. You may be overriding your own custom styles.. Found some issues with reinitialization. Fixed in 6e317e2.\nLet me know if that solves your problems.. I'm not a big fan of this hack because it is never 100% reliable.

I'll work on merging this but I don't think I'll be changing the docs because I don't want to promote use on non floating buttons.. I'm merging right now. And as a framework, I think we should strive to be as flexible as possible. Some people may want to use it in a different way and they can add custom css to make it look better. . Merged, don't worry I took care of the docs\nThanks again @Pierstoval . Is this necessary? most of the code is duplicated. Can we add a note instead about the placement of the side-nav?. Thanks!. It looks like you are viewing the current site right? This issue has been fixed but is not in the current release. It won't show up in the actual site until we release a new version..

Waves is not only meant for buttons so removing this will probably have negative consequences when placed on other elements.\nHave you tested to see if this messes up waves on other components? . Not only. You can use waves on images, nav links, and really anything you want. Its easy to tunnel vision on testing a fix for a specific bug but as a framework this needs to be flexible.. I still think we are misunderstanding each other. Waves can be placed on elements that are not buttons.. I still think we are misunderstanding each other. Waves can be placed on elements that are not buttons.. Well your codepen only tested buttons. I feel like the bug this is solving is minor, and the bugs it can cause could be more major. For now there is an easy 1 line css fix to the bug so I'd rather not remove the display globally until it is more thoroughly tested. Can you explain more what these are and how these differ from the existing callbacks?. It seems you have some merge issues. I would suggest cleaning up your commits and reopening.. What exactly are these fixes to?. Still not exactly sure what this fixes. Can we get a codepen demonstrating this in use?. You can also use the callbacks in tabs to initialize the parallax.

Just don't make the button itself position fixed. If you wrap it in a fixed container everything should work fine.. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the responsive table. If you know for sure each column will have two lines you can get around this by adding <br>&nbsp; in the table header element (<th>). What issue is this fixing? Can you please make a codepen to show what you are fixing?. I feel like it shouldn't be invalid when its empty because then when it first loads, all the required fields would be invalid? I think it makes more sense to only validate it once the user inputs some data.. Merged. There are many issues with using css columns for positioning. Have you tried using our grid system?. Fixed in 511639b8. This makes sense to me. Adding the parent selector removes the necessity of having those padding and width by default.. What exactly is this fixing?

For fixed height elements, it is very hard to make sure nothing is cut off at any size. Because you have added the constrained height class of large, the image will be cut off.

You can tweek these numbers yourself but I do not know of a way that can guarantee an image will always be showing regardless of the image's size.

Please check the documentation to learn more.. We don't use events. We use the callbacks onOpen and onClose which are plugin options. I don't know how else to say it. Also it is not our job to vet every third party plugin in existence and make sure it can work perfectly in every way possible. That is unrealistic. If you find a simple fix that makes them compatible we are happy to merge it. But we won't go out of our way to write our components so they can accommodate third party plugins. .

In our next release we have changed the way you init to support multiple initialization with javascript.\nYou can checkout the changes in 6faf9b045459b252cce6d47b5271aaa179026eab. We can add a responsive threshold, which we've done for a couple of our plugins. It would be a pixel value that below it would disable the effect. Would something like that work?. Added in d90f1049. Can you provide a code example?. Fixed in f76204b2. Can you provide a codepen or something?. The fontsize in buttons is actually specified by a Sass variable so I don't think we can remove that. . Can you provide more information? or a code example reproducing this? . This is on 1.0 alpha?. How exactly are you getting the data? Can you post a more complete code example?. material_chip is not the latest version. In the latest alpha version, you can do:\nvar instance = M.Carousel.getInstance(elem);\ninstance.chipsData\nthat will return an array of the current chips data.. You are correct. This seems to be some old code that is no longer needed.\nRemoved in b928a60c. Hmm, this probably creeped in earlier in alpha. Fixed in 13b1cdfb. Closing due to inactivity. Feel free to repopen with more information and a codepen. Fixed in 5bd9dc35. You cannot use individual files alone. Currently there is no way to import partial components.. Look at the issue submission guidelines.. There is no good way of doing this because if the variables in the Sass are changed the Javascript variable would also have to change. Its probably easier to just write your own helper function. Fixed in 9506120c. Fixed in 9506120c. Use the classes option instead of adding the class directly to the select element. Please fill out the issue template with more information. Also your codepen link doesn't work. The class itself doesn't hide, it only applies display block on small screens. Its up to you to apply the styles to hide the element on default however you see fit.. Added in 8339680d. This pen works on alpha 4. If you add constrainWidth: false it should work.. What version on you are on? Can you make this a codepen?. Wow not sure how that got past us. Thanks for pointing this out! Fixed in 07fcb98f. Good catch!. We suggest you use a container or some sort of wrapper div to set a margin. Adding styles to the element itself can make writing css unintuitive. We try and keep margins on individual elements to a minimum to allow proper alignment when using the grid system and other containers.. We are not planning on releasing anymore to the v0.100.x version. We are focusing all our attention on v1.0.0. This issue is currently fixed on our Alpha version. Fixed in 4bbcb17d. Please put more effort into your issue. What phone / browser are you using and can you make a codepen reproducing this problem? It is working on my own mobile device.. Fixed in 9d1aa47c\nWill be live next release. Is the image support autocomplete currently have not what you are looking for?. Can you post a codepen?. My local test files are using unminified versions. Not sure whats causing your problems. Have you tried using collapsibles? Dropdowns don't seem ideal for a mobile sidenav. Closed due to low effort issue. Please read over the issue guidelines before submitting again. Can you provide a codepen reproducing this? I just tested this locally and it works for me.. JSON stringify is not needed. If you just change your alert functions to console.log and just log the el element itself, you can see it passes back the correct html element.. The version you are using in your codepen is 0.97.8. We can't retroactively fix bugs. You will have to try a newer version to see if this issue still exists.. Thanks!. The version you are using in all of these fiddles is 0.97.3\nYou can always find the version number at the top of the compiled files if you are confused.. Materialbox is no longer automatically initialized. You have to initialize the plugin like any other plugin.. Fixed in baf872f7. What version is this? This should be fixed on our alpha branch.. You can programmatically change the original select element, and then reinit the select plugin. You can just init the plugin again, the same as always. All our plugins are built so that if you init a plugin multiple times, it will destroy the existing instance of the plugin and reinitialize the plugin.. this is fixed in our alpha version. We are not planning on doing any more releases to the v0.100.x version as we are focusing all our efforts on v1.0.0. I don't think this is how onOpenStart should work because you can drag the sidenav a little bit and it will snap back to closed. You could try adding a callback to just drag instead.. Fixed in b5e426f9. Please fill out the issue template and provide more information.. What version are you on? There were some bugfixes to draggable that are not yet released if you want to try downloading the latest from v1-dev and trying that. Fixed in ef90dbd3.\nThanks for pointing this out!. I'm not sure I understand your problem. Do you have a codepen or something demonstrating your issue?. This is a common problem with hovers on mobile and I don't see how this is a problem with collection-item. You can remove the :hover style on mobile devices but I don't think there is a clean programmatic way of removing the \"hover\" state. Added in d033b10f.\nYou can read more about what a compareFunction is and how to write your own here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort. The order of JSON objects is not guaranteed. Fixed in 298a87f4. Good find! I fixed a bunch of issues that caused errors when css properties like max-width or max-height were applied.\nFixed in 51109e1db639e5b4a9f8de755cee140c83d4c218. it seems like you fixed the issue? You are correct in that the safest way for it to work is to put it in the root level of the DOM. Have you tried the closeOnClick option?. Hmmm very weird, when I try and recreate the problem on a local test page, the issue no longer happens. Is this bug only appearing on jsfiddle?. I can't seem to reproduce this issue locally. Is this happening to you only on codepen?. Is this happening on the latest alpha release?. Fixed in c00c954f. Good catch. This is an unintended side effect of us closing the sidenav on window resize. On mobile devices, bringing up the keyboard resizes the window. I've now changed it so the sidenav only closes on horizontal window resizes.\nFixed in aa2997a8. The input field container is required for the autocomplete to function. thanks!. We changed the plugin name for 1.0.0-alpha.4\nIts working on the latest version. It seems like you are passing in an array. Try passing in an object instead:\nlet pozycje = {};. In general, we only remove elements from the DOM on destroy when they were generated by the plugin. In the case of dropdown, the user created the dropdown-content element so we don't remove it. This also allows them to reinit the plugin easily..

Try to see if your issue persists on the latest beta version and you can reopen your issue.. Collapsible keyboard support added in e6e83bdb. Collapsible keyboard support added in e6e83bdb. Tabs focus style added in d1ae3cff7a211dbebdc742ff20d566efba2299b0. Tooltips open when element is focused added in 1428c72d. I have no idea what this means. This is a specialized effect made for the theme. That is also the html theme. There is a separate shopify theme demo. But more importantly, we want to keep this repo focused on just Materialize. \nIf you have further questions about themes you can email us at materializethemes@gmail.com. This style hasn't changed in a long time. It shouldn't be new in alpha 4. Also font-weight: 500 is still bold. Normal font-weight is 400. Its just not as bold.. Hmm, after some testing it seems like a problem with Android's keyboard. When focused on an input within a Form the enter key is turned into a Tab key if there are following inputs. The weird part about this Tab is that it doesn't seem to fire any Keyboard events (keypress, keydown, keyup) so there is no way to handle it. \nA not so ideal solution is to add tabindex=\"-1\" to all the other inputs in the same form as your chips to prevent being able to tab to them which brings back the enter key. Not really sure on what could fix this problem.. Fixed in dd7f0d6f. can you post a codepen?. I've rewritten autocomplete so it now uses dropdown to show its options, meaning it should be more robust.\nChanged in 1e81583466d3373092f1bedfeb699448782eeb48.\nIf it still persists on the latest version you can open a new issue.. We are no longer releasing on the v0.100.2 branch. This issue should be fixed in our latest release on alpha 4 if you want to try that.. Can you make a codepen? I can't help without seeing any code.. Are you on the latest beta version? We switched to a label wrapping structure.\nhttp://materializecss.com/checkboxes.html. This is an old version. Try updating to a more current version to see if the problem persists.. Why don't you clear the timer when you dismiss the toast? Or just check if the timer still exists in your timer code.. can you post a codepen?. I believe this is the same issue as #5677. This has been fixed and will be included in the next release. Can you post a codepen? I have no idea what component or file you are talking about.. Have you taken a look at http://next.materializecss.com/preloader.html?. Fixed in da3f1483. This will be available in the next release. How are you managing to have 2 open? They should close if you open another. It looks from your code that you are on an old version. Have you tried our latest alpha build? That is the build we are currently updating.. Can you give more information about your setup?. That is correct @dev-plus. Using the container option, you can choose the parent container where the picker is appended to. You should specify container: 'body' whenever you are putting the datepicker inside anything with restricted overflow.. I'm not sure I understand your problem. Do you have an example codepen reproducing the issue?. I still don't really understand, sorry. If its not too much trouble, setting up a codepen really helps me out so I can understand the problem visually firsthand.. Fixed in 1cc5f855. Can you explain exactly how to reproduce the issue? I fixed the issue where when you hovered your mouse on a focus activated tooltip, it would stay stuck open.. I've investigated this issue and it seems to only happen to anchor tags because it triggers the browsers' link dragging functionality. This overrides the mouseup event causing the tooltip to lose track of the mouse.\nIf its really bothering you, you can disable drag events on the anchor but I don't think its a good solution to have that as the default for tooltips..

This might be the same issue as c00c954f. Try updating to the latest github version and see if the bug is still happening.. This is because when changing the position of the fixed-action-btn, you need to also set the bottom to auto. Right now the container is being stretched across the whole height of the screen and its blocking inputs.. Fixed in c00c954f. Duplicate of #5776. Fixed in 9e7a1b5f. Could you make a codepen reproducing the problem? It might have to do with the timing of the select(). Have you tried preselecting a tab instead?. The init method supports querySelectorAll so you don't need to use a forEach.. Good catch, thanks.\nFixed in 6ea957f8. Have you tried on 1.0.0-beta?. Tested on 1.0.0-beta and it seems to be working fine.. Copying that code worked for me on my test page. Can you create a codepen that reproduces the problem?. event.stopPropagation should work. How did you try implementing it?. Properties are not the same as passable options. Once you initialize your plugin you can access properties on the instance. \nFor example: \nvar instance = M.TapTarget.init(elem, options);\ninstance.isOpen // Read only property whether the tapTarget is open or not\nYou can use the open() method after you initialize it if you want it to start open..

You are free to grab the compiled files from GitHub. But it does seem like this bug has been fixed but not yet released. Can you make a codepen to reproduce this?. There is no javascript that sets the height. There is a max-height attribute in css you can change to 100% which you may have missed. Then if you remove the startingTop and endingTop it should be full height.. I've tested it locally and it seems to be working fine. The issue may be caused by your implementation. You are passing in a function expression not a function.\nIt should work if you rewrite it in an anonymous function like this:\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n    var elems = document.querySelectorAll('.modal');\n    var instances = M.Modal.init(elems, {onOpenEnd: function() {\n        resizeModals(90);\n    }, endingTop: '5%'});\n});.

You can use the classes option in the Select plugin to pass classes to the select-wrapper. Currently there is no way to pass classes to the input, but you can style accordingly from the select-wrapper class. Pepyta is correct. In 1.0.0 we decoupled initialization from the open action. Now you should only initialize the modal once and call the specific methods on the modal instance.. In the newest versions, we treat character counter like any other javascript component so you will have to initialize it in javascript.. Are you able to actually reproduce an error or anything? We use Cash internally that is a very lightweight library that shares some simple jQuery functionality. \nPlease provide a codepen if you've found something reproducible..

You can use the onOpenEnd callback on modal to update the tab indicator so it renders properly.. Merged. Thanks for catching this. You can use the dropdownOptions option in select to set a callback on the underlying dropdown component. Maybe in the future, but for now css variables are too unsupported. Also Sass has many color functions that we use like lighten and darken.. Fixed in 4a68ebd1. Merged. Thanks!. in v1, Select has an option called dropdownOptions which you can pass an object of options for the underlying dropdown. If the container option fixes your issue you can try doing this for select as well.. I can't reproduce this locally. Please submit a codepen that reproduces this issue. Thanks for finding this! Fixed in b3233253. In 1.0.0 there is no longer automatic initialization, so first off your dropdown isn't initialized. Second, because tabs has overflow properties on it, you will want to move your dropdown content out of there. Then you can specify the container where it is kept to stop the plugin from moving the dropdown content. Then it should work. I've editted your codepen to demonstrate it:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/EdGMQL. Part of the init code destroys and reinitializes so it shouldn't be making more tooltips. I've tested something simple on my local version and it seems to be working correctly. \nDo you have a code example reproducing this issue?. I still dont see the problem. Whenever you init a tooltip it should make sure to destroy any previous tooltips. Also if you want to remove the tooltip functionality, you should call the destroy method instead of removing the material-tooltip manually.. Do you have codepen reproducing the problem? I'm assuming by dropdownlist, you mean any dropdown?. This sounds reasonable. If you want to take a crack at a PR, go ahead. This seems simple enough for you to add on your own? I'm not sure a global class is needed. I used your init code locally and can't seem to reproduce this. Can you try making a codepen reproducing the bug?.

    "yanickrochon": "This issue seems to already be addressed on various cases. More specific ones should be noted, and this issue should be closed for cleanup.. Wait, is this still valid? I mean this\n<a class=\"btn btn-floating btn-flat\"><i class=\"material-icons\">close</i></a>\nessentially does what this issue is referring to, no?. I agree with @kmmbvnr that there are a \"big enough crowd that prefer LESS\" to do something about it, then someone ought to do something, right? \nAlso, that are arguably more reasons to keep SASS only than to have a LESS version, or even both of them. The popularity of something does not necessarily indicate any form of superiority. Because IDE vs SCSI, VHS vs Betamax, Blue-ray vs HD DVD, to name but a few, were popular, and yet not necessarily the best technological choices.\nThe module is published with a pre-built CSS file that can easily be merged with other CSS files, generated or not. I don't see a good reason to fiddle with the SASS anyway; extend the styles with your own custom selectors and styles!. FWIW I think a time picker does also well on desktops with a mouse and keyboard.

FWIW I think a time picker does also well on desktops with a mouse and keyboard. Users rather click and drag things than select a dropdown list or even type values.\n:+1: for a time picker component.\n. Since this is a long standing issue, I'll comment here on this.\n\n\nIf jQuery is removed, will Materialize be refactored in ES6, using Babel to transpile and compile the code? For this kind of project, I believe that it should, just like SASS is compiled to CSS. Therefore, before even removing jQuery, the entire framework should be ported to ES6. In any case, a roadmap with a list of changes that need to be made is preferrable.\n\n\nif jQuery is removed, how will JavaScript components be initialized? Currently, the framework has $(selector).modal(options);, etc. What will that become? The positive thing with jQuery is that, since everything is a plugin, there is no need to import anything, but jQuery. So, we'd have to use things like Materialize.modal(selector, options); ? However, another nice thing about jQuery is that we can rely on a uniform way to communicate with a component. Such as $(selector).modal('close');, how will that work : Materialize.modal(selector, \"close\"); ? I don't really like this. Also, will those using jQuery be able to easily listen to events that Materialize components fire? (i.e what will become of $(selector).on('openModal', handler); ?)\n\n\nWith the amount of PRs, issues, and literally lack of interest from this project maintainers, I doubt that this issue can and will be resolved anytime soon. There are processes that are defined for large organizations to work together, but it seems that many of these processes and recommendations are simply ignored by the team members (i.e. versioning, code reviews, proper discussion on issues, issue management, etc.) and this is causing much frustrations. The team say that PRs are welcome, but most of them are ignored, or rewritten (and ignored), or not properly addressed (no review before merge). Please, prove me wrong on this, because at the moment I am questioning the leadership of this project.. @thednp I think you should actually read the post you just linked.\n\n\n\nIf you're developing a library on the other hand, please take a moment to consider if you actually need jQuery as a dependency.\n\nBecause this is the question that I asked in my very first bullet point. It's not because someone asks \"Do you really need this?\" that it means \"You don't need this.\" Perhaps Materialize does not need jQuery (I personally believe that it can very well benefit from it, due to it's size and component nature), but this is the question to answer. Your link does not add anything concrete to the discussion, and certainly does not prove dropping jQuery at all.. @thednp You suppose a lot of things, which many are simply inaccurate. \n\nIf you think the sizzle syntax is a life saver, please ignore this thread and find yourself something better to do.\n\nWhere, in all my comments, did I ever argued on this? My main argument is how $.fn.* is not only useful, but something that can hardly be replaced.\nFor example, let's say that you refactor the Modal component this way (because you said If you check my repositories you will find the perfect answer to your question. and this is how you seem to do things) :\njs\nvar modal = new Materialize.Modal('#modalElement');\nHow would you pass this reference around? How would you get that reference from inside an event handler across another component? You would need to carry the instance around and manage these references. If the element is destroyed, you would need to handle that as well. My argument is that, with jQuery, UI components are bound to their respective elements (or at least this is the recommended practice, which is not observed in Materialize....) and you don't need to carry instances around, and all references to the UI are destroyed and removed from memory automatically when the target element is removed from the DOM; just like malloc versus garbage collection.\nI agree with you, that if this was a small project, a single component, with minimal features, jQuery could be removed without much consequences. But Materialize is a long way from that, with increasingly many components, and the way these components are accessed (as easily as with jQuery) is a real concern for many projects.\nPersonally, I argue against removing it because the way components are initialized, and accessed is neat and clean; with jQuery I don't have to worry about instances and component lifecyles. I also love that I can chain many calls, for example \njs\n$('ul').append(\n  $('<li class=\"collection-item\">', { \n    text: \"foo\"\n  }).on('click', function () { \n    // I do not need to care about if the element exists, or if it's a modal or not.\n    // If not for jQuery, I'd have to manually check every time I do this.\n    $('#fooModal').modal('open');\n  })\n);\nSo, this is why many people do include jQuery in their projects. So, what? Would you suggest to have materialize.js and materialize.jquery.js? Since materialize.js would require an implementation of many features that jQuery already provides (or rely on other third party components, as suggested by the blog post you provided), it's size would be greater than it currently is, and would be a downside to those who actually want to include jQuery for various reasons. Thus, materialize.jquery.js would be smaller, requiring jQuery, etc.\nSo, you see? You cannot just dumb down the issue with \"We can do without, therefore we can remove it's dependency.\" I do not object that it may be practically faster for some cases without (most speed gain is insignificant, and the loading time of 400ms is quite subjective, here), but my concerns are more on the order of usability as described above with component instances and references, etc.. BTW: Here are two screenshots of an app I am building with Meteor (which is bundled with jQuery, and I added Materialize for it's UI). Both are loaded from the same LAN, and the same machine, so there is no bias and both can be compared. Total size and load time is at the bottom of the screenshots.\nDevelopment version\n(jQuery is highlighted)\n\nProduction version\n(combined JS, including jQuery, highlighted)\n\nThus, the focus should be put on including jQuery, instead of having it a separate library :stuck_out_tongue:  But, seriously, @victorperin 's argument is refuted right there.. Toasts may return an object that can be used to change the toast's behavior. Something like\njs\nvar $toastContent = $('<span>I am toast content</span>').on('click', function () {\n  // toast.delay( 30000 );    change toast's delay to 30s\n  // toast.discard();         discard\n});\nvar toast = Materialize.toast($toastContent, 60000);  // 1 minute\n. HTML5 does have an <input type=\"color\"> element. Where the proposed widget above is complicated, something like this would be nice; A simple element displaying it's color value, compatible with the current form layout (i.e. label, placeholder, input, etc.). Then, click handlers could be set to intercept and display users' custom dialogs such as the one proposed above.\n. HTML5 does have an <input type=\"color\"> element.

Since everywhere I go it says that I have nothing to do, what's the fix for this?\n. The project could support both naming conventions. I personally don't mind the green-lighten-2, etc.\nFor example\n```\ngreen lighten-3 === green-200 === #A5D6A7\ngreen accent-4 === green-a700 === #00C853\nblue-grey lighten-1 === blue-gray-400 === #78909C\n```\netc.\n.

The implementation should return a handler as such :\n``` js\nconst toast = Materialize.toast('I am a toast', 30000);\ntoast.isActive();     // true if the toast is still visible, false if it was dismissed or has timed out\ntoast.dismiss();      // dismiss the toast\n``\n.

Also, many projects do not rely on jQuery's$.ajaxfunction either.

Promises have the advantage of better handling asynchronous errors, and may be chained (no callback hell). And, since a promise is always returned, it does not matter if the resolved value is synchronous or asynchronous.\nBottom line is, do not use \"ajax\" anymore; we no longer use much XML for asynchronous communications nowadays :stuck_out_tongue: . @aashay0101 the term \"ajax\" is pretty much not used anymore.

When this line is executed : data = res; (in the request's success handler), the list of suggestion does not get automatically updated?. Currently, if the associated data value is a string, it is displayed as an image URL. Just add the feature that, if it is an object, then it is some data which is not an image. This way, no need for extra options, and it should be 99% BC.\nFor example : \n```\n// standard implementation\n$('input.autocomplete').autocomplete({\n  data: {\n    \"Apple\": null,\n    \"Microsoft\": null,\n    \"Google\": 'http://placehold.it/250x250'\n  }\n});\n// data has data... (i.e. no images)\n$('input.autocomplete').autocomplete({\n  data: {\n    \"Apple\": null,\n    \"Microsoft\": null,\n    \"Google\": { id: 1, url: 'http://placehold.it/250x250' }\n  }\n});\n```\n. Personally, I don't like underscores in attributes. See the relative issue for my comment on this.\n. I'd rather have a callback when a value is selected.\nconst data = {\n  \"Apple\": { id: 1 },\n  \"Microsoft\": { id: 2 },\n  \"Google\": { id: 3 }\n}; \n$('input.autocomplete').autocomplete({\n  data: data,\n  select: function (input, selection) {\n    var model = data[selection];\n    $(input).data('id', model.id)\n  }\n});\nSee #3583 \n. For example :\njs\n$('.modal-trigger').leanModal({\n  ready: function(event) {\n    // event = {\n    //  \"type\": \"onReady\",\n    //  \"trigger\": <DOMelement>,\n    //  \"timeStamp\": Number,\n    //  ...\n    //}\n    console.log('Modal triggered by', event.trigger);\n  }\n});\nor simply \njs\n$('.modal-trigger').leanModal({\n  ready: function(trigger) {\n    console.log('Modal triggered by', trigger);\n  }\n});\n. Looks nice so far. But it would still be possible to pass the trigger to the ready function. If you pass this here, then you'd have the trigger as argument to pass it as second argument to the ready function here.\n. Splendid! :+1: \n. Splendid! :+1: \n. The issue of $(modalSelector).modal().modal('open') could be solved by two solutions \n1. Have .modal('open') initialize the modal if not already so, then call the instance method\n2. Add an init option to open the modal initially, just like Bootstrap does with it's show option.\nOrdinarily, jQuery plugins are based on instances that are available directly unto the element's data. For example : $(modalSelector).modal('open'); and $(modalSelector).data('modal').open(); should be equivalent. Again, with Bootstrap, components are contained this way, and the modal instance can be retrieved via .data('bs.modal').\nThe widget standard API, with jQuery, is\n- init - create the component (this should not be called twice)\n- setters / getters - mutate and retrieve the component's various states and options\n- methods - to interact with the component (i.e. open, close, isActive, etc.)\n- destroy - cleanup function that reverts any DOM changes back and remove any event listeners\nAll these are contained within a single prototype that can be extended if necessary.\nNote: there is an issue that the modal may be initialize twice, adding duplicate event listeners on the modal element. Ironically, the triggers are properly cleaned, so this may just be an oversight.\n. Here is a jsfiddle to reproduce.\n. The release of the revision (0.97.7 > 0.97.8) that introduced breaking changes is indeed a mistake.

Meh, the easiest way is to manually edit your .meteor/versions file :stuck_out_tongue: Then meteor will install the proper Materialize package automatically without updating. This can even be done running hot.\n. You mean add tests cases? For now, my intention was to make it seamless with existing use cases, and didn't bother reading existing tests; I ran grunt travis --filter=scrollFire and it passed. Also note the timestamp of this issue and my PR; I basically wrote and pushed all that in 20 minutes, before leaving work, today :smile: \n. You simply replaced setInterval with a throttled version. Many of the issues are not resolved, no.. You still keep references to the options passed... This is creating memory leaks.. .. and you are still testing the element's bounding box before validating if you actually even need to test that element. I could've simply refactored my PR instead. You basically shut off all my PR for your own versions without discussing any matter. Do I really want to invest more time on this project with more PR?. @kmmbvnr I don't need to.\njs\nMaterialize.scrollFire({ selector: '.load-more', callback: function () { });\nwill always run in the background. Always. The component won't care if the event has been fire or not, this line will always be executed for ever and ever. More over, during the lifecycle of the page, if another .load-more element is created (using React), then the component will still be called another time\nMaterialize.scrollFire({ selector: '.load-more', callback: function () { });\n... it needs to, since the first one is flagged as done (but is still getting evaluated anyway!).\nThis PR, which is in conflict now because, instead of discussing, you guys decided to trash this one, addressed these issues. If you can't see what I'm talking about, I don't know how I can make this any clearer. An example will simply \"run\" what I'm talking about, and be a waste of my time.. @kmmbvnr  sure! but we would need to create two constructors\n\nMaterialize.scrollFire(options); to support current implementations, keep BC, while implementing the fixes as I mentioned already. (Seriously, I want to contribute, but please don't go behind my PR and re-implement it... especially if the issues the PR addresses aren't resolved!) This API should warn that it is deprecated when used.\n$(selector).scrollFire(options) the new API, bound to the element, where $(selector).scrollFire('destroy'); may be called to remove all handlers and cleanup.. My opinion is that jQuery may help reduce the size of this framework. Some components do use jQuery, some don't. And I think the size to be smaller if all components did use jQuery.\n\nIn fact, jQuery does allow simple plugin integration with DOM elements, such as $(selector).modal(options) and we can listen to events similarly. Getting rid of jQuery would mean that applications using jQuery would require 1) using different APIs when using Materialize and other third party components, or 2) relying on a third-party project to have adaptors for Materialize to jQuery... meaning that, not only Materialize's code size will increase, but more code will be needed to bring back the simpler API that jQuery provides. Ridiculous!\nI get that some people argue that jQuery is wrong, or slow or blah, blah, blah. I just don't buy it. Unless you really need split second optimization, speed is irrelevant in this case, and it does offer a more linear API, with many features already implemented (element size, bounds, inline CSS and classes, events management, user data attached to DOM, etc.) As for the size, jQuery is 86k minified, compared with Materialize at 142k minified (note that, as I said, Materialize could even be smaller if it properly used jQuery, compared to the opposite if not).\n-1 for me.\n. Unfortunately, no. Thus, this is a duplicate of #3865.\nHopefully, code reviews and proper versioning will follow :smile: . What's the point of this line? The variable is simply never used....\n. ",

But if you try this with a little delay, jquery returns real value.\nSo I put @Dogfalo's function into setTimeout function with 100ms delay and it works like a charm.\nBut....dafuq? :)\n. @ciencia You are right, thank for the hint\n@Dogfalo Thanks, I get that. Anyway if there would be the option, like in original pickadate.js is, it would be great. Frankly, when you choose a date, you don't need the calendar anymore -> close it.\nP.S. I'm using latest 0.96.1 version\n. @ciencia You are right, thank for the hint\n@Dogfalo Thanks, I get that. Anyway if there would be the option, like in original pickadate.js is, it would be great.

My workaround is I initialize the Slick when the modal is opened.\n. Just tried your suggestion on different project.\nThe thing is that I can minimalize spaces between boxes but i.e. not inside table cells th and th. The same issue is with material select. Sure I can override them in my CSS file, but who wants to do that for every type of element?\nI've checked all variables in project and all relevant I can see it variable $gutter-width. Sadly this \"global spacing variable\" is not used in tables and most of another elements. It's pitty because if it would we could adjust spacing globally it would keep the ratio between element spacing.\nWhat do you think?\nThank you.\n. This would be super feature. For example Foundation framework has it and it also has push/pull resppponsive version (like small-pull-2). I guess it's not so much line of code but it would improve materializecss about 10 levels.\n. This would be super feature.

Same in Chrome.. > Here is the code that stops throwing that error for me. Granted it may disable waves effects on SVG but that doesn't matter to me.\n@jacobq Not sure if we have any clean fix yet. Does this disable the effect on the material icons?\nIf we have a good and tested fiy and you want to contribute then you can create a PR with the needed changes.. @shanehoban sorry, I meant the svg version of the Material icons. You can download single svg icons from https://material.io/icons/ and insert the svg markup instead of the text used by the font.\nCan you please test if the method still works on svg images or if the change completely disables it on svg elements?\nA codepen could be also useful.. > Granted it may disable waves effects on SVG but that doesn't matter to me.\nDoes or doesn't it disable it the effect?. > Oh I see, well I guess the fix I'm using would disable the waves-effect on them. It will disable waves-effect on any SVG for that matter via && !(target instanceof SVGElement)\nHm, that is not really an option.. It was fixed in https://github.com/fians/Waves/commit/19f4b31a55ea845ba7055ee149671c3bbfe86ed0 https://github.com/fians/Waves/issues/145. I think we should diff our waves.js 0.6.4 file against the original one, rebase it, apply the newest release of it, test it and release it with the next Materialize version.. @jacobq Is this another issue? I thought it is about the svg element code.. @jacobq and this is not (a better) fix? https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2005#issuecomment-310894652\nI am currently not understanding why we discuss different solutions for the (same) problem.. > @DanielRuf I don't think mine is better as it avoids all clicking on SVG elements.\nSo the version of @jacobq is better and still works? Unfortunately I do not have the time to test this. Could you tests if this would solve your issue and still work in other cases?\nWould be interesting to know and see if and how it is fixes in waves.js.. @Denly which version of Materialize do you use? Is it fixed when you move to px measures?. Do you have all the weights /variants of Roboto locally installed?. @tomscholz unfortunately I do not have any environment or device with Safari by Apple so I can not test it so easily. If it works as intended and the issue is solved, we can safely close this issue here.. The codepen info was added in February 2015.\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/cfb7fc3adc3526978177da7d1fe685b6bf4fcaea\nWe are cleaning up and you can still reopen / request to reopen.\nSo far a solution like you suggest makes sense.. Also the suggested solution is still open https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4343. Bootstrap 3 uses\nHTML\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-ok form-control-feedback\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\nThe aria-hidden=\"true\" is important for screen reading solutions and they switched to span in the official docs..

Probably related https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4344. @tomscholz it is about one of the warnings of npm. jQuery is in the devDependencies and dependencies, but should be not in the dev dependencies.. For example https://travis-ci.org/Dogfalo/materialize/builds/224550673#L153 ;-)\nWe should cleanup and update the dependencies in the near future and move to node.js 6.x LTS =). Could be simplified. We could check with .lenth if the element already exists and append it if not.\nBut this here works too and also looks good to me. . @acburst can you link the commit which fixes it?. @acburst can you link the commit which fixes it?.

That is a weird approach @uwong15.. That is not how it should be done in general.. This is not backwards compatible.\n\nYou can programmatically trigger a tab change with our select_tab method. You have to input the id of the tab you want to switch to. In the case of our demo it would be either test1, test2, test3, or test4.. @artm The file that you linked to is just for the docs. There is no automatic initialization in v1 anymore.\nYou should only reinit the components that you actually use.. The event listener should also fire for dynamically added elements.. Try to configure your IDE for SASS.. @cytsunny take a look at https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/sass/components/forms/_radio-buttons.scss#L70-L73, this is normal CSS in general (with a color variable).. Exactly.\n\nJust use\ncss\n[type=\"radio\"]:checked + label:after,\n[type=\"radio\"].with-gap:checked + label:after {\n  background-color: #yourhexcolor;\n}. Duplicate of https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4793. Duplicate of https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4793. I agree with @Dogfalo, the components should follow the specs.. @fega huh, why did you close the issue?\nMaybe it would work with polyfills.\nAlso, is parallax scrolling part of the materialdesign docs?\nFor me it feels a bit like feature creep on some parts.\nMain target should be a web framework wich provides all the material design components in the official specification + plugins.. @fega huh, why did you close the issue?\nMaybe it would work with polyfills.\nAlso, is parallax scrolling part of the materialdesign docs?\nFor me it feels a bit like feature creep on some parts.\nMain target should be a web framework wich provides all the material design components in the official specification + plugins.. > it could be isolated as a plugin\nRight.\n\nHehe, sorry for my English mistakes \ud83d\ude22\n\nNo problem, needed a moment to understand it. No worries.. Why did you close the PR?. No, this is part of the forms component. He can rename the function name and rebuild from source.. It's planned to rename all component parts or namespace them completely.. No, you cant. You would have to clone this repository using Git, install the dependencies and run grunt.. Generally using files from CDNs is not recommended. Also this us a very old issue and not relevant for v1. Please create a new issue.. Use http://rawgit.com/. @snicky can you rebase it against the current master?\n@tomscholz should be ok to merge after resolving the conflict.

Please create a new issue and a codepen which reproduces the issue.. This was a rounding bug which is fixed in https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/4444... @kiere do you mean (unit) tests? Not sure.\n@davelima Can you provide a codepen of before and after?. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GmjGPr. @rosentoski the fix in the PR is not yet merged. Just @acburst and @Dogfalo, the maintainers and owners, can merge it into master.\nOnly the next tagged release would contain the fix.\nIf you want to apply it now you have to change the file yourself, compile Materialize using Grunt and include the compiled files instead of the files from the CDN.. Flexbox might be indeed a great solution in the near future and make such calculations / estimations in components obsolete.. IE is still a bit problematic. We could use flexbox for this component but keep a fallback for IE and other browsers.. Was the PR obsolete @tomscholz? Did not see why it was reverted. If there is an issue I can take a look at it.. @tahnik the function is definitely there so you might have not included Materialize the right way.\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/js/forms.js#L477\nDid you include the scripts at the bottom of the body after all actual markup?. The issue comes from the change that the label for fields with .validate have now a width of 100%.\nNot sure about the fix.\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/4469\nAn alternative fix\nCSS\ninput.validate+label {\n    text-align: initial;\n}. Some weight calculation would be good. The results are currently alphabetically ordered. We have to calculate position of first match (from the start of the string), the length of the match and the length of the full string where the match is in.. This is the sort method what I described (how it should work). The current sorting is what you can do with the native sort() methods for arrays ;-). To overwrite or set a sort method?\nMost developers and users probably await that libraries and frameworks have some sorting already included (which can be overwritten using some configuration like in your code example).\nBut the approach with your code example is definitely a good idea (to set / overwrite the sort method) and in the right direction.. @chris-ti8m please reopen until this is also fixed in the master branch.. Did you test v1 1.0.0 alpha x?. Sorry, meant alpha ;-). So it works at least ;-). > afaik only users with write access to the repo can assign labels\nExactly.. Did you try this?\nTry upgrading node if possible. > This issue doesn't appear in Firefox:\nSure, this is not the same rendering engine ;-) This is an issue in webkit / Blink ;-). Should be ok now. Or do we really need the width and center here just for demo purposes? The used code should be equal to the code in the code box to remove any side effects and reflect the exact same code.. Do you have a codepen whoch shows the fix for the linked issue?\nSo far I did not have any case where the code of my PR did not solve this render bug.. Why not both solutions in combination?\nBecause your solution is slower when the tab is changed and the image has to be downloaded and then the browser knows the exact size of the image, this takes a while and introduces some sort of FOUT.\nThe DOM is faster than the content (images).\nThe first initialization with your solution takes some time..

Any reason for this? Just that it is shorter? Should we close this PR?\nThese are the only breakpoints which have a shortened naming. The others are not shortened so far.. You are right, this could come with the next major release (which could introduce breaking changes) or we keep it like this.. @NonameSLdev why this? I think you mean -med- instead of -medium- when the old -med- would be removed / moved to -medium. Breaking changes in the changelog are bold.. @tomscholz is right, don't change more than necessary.. > The comments are over-complicating things. What needs to be done here is this:\n\nEdit sass files (only sass files!) and where there's a class that matches med-` change themedtomedium.\nAdd a warning in the materializecss.com website (edit jade files) that while med- classes are available, it's best to use medium- as it's the new syntax and it improves consistensy.\nChange all occurrences of med- classes in materializecss.com website to be medium-.\nIt's not so complicated. Redo the PR with only these steps and remove the editing of the compiled css files?\nAll this PR needs is to bring back the med- classes together with the medium- classes to avoid breaking older versions, and a warning in the materializecss.com website about med- being deprecated. That's it.\n_But if you do want to complicate, here's something that could be cool: Perhaps add js code to log to the console about the usage of med- classes if they're used? _\n\nDone.\nBut it should not be a (big) problem because I changed all files at once. This is the exact same result when the files are compiled so no need for an extra \"compile\" commit ;-). Done.. But then you would have to duplicate them and set them for each breakpoint instead of using the breakpoints directly and reflecting them.\nJust as a sidenote, Foundation (Sites) and other frameworks use such classnames with the up/down too.. What do the others think about this? Use the shortest version (s m l xl)?. Sorry, meant xl.. Is this still relevant for v1?. Well there is a conflict with the official guide and some inconsistent things.\nhttp://materializecss.com/sass.html#media\nSmall screens are defined as having a max-width of 600px \nMedium screens are defined as having a max-width of 992px \nLarge screen are defined as having a min-width of 993px \nExtra Large screen are defined as having a min-width of 1200px\nIt should be (mobile first)\nExtra Small screens are defined as having a max-width of 600px \nSmall screens are defined as having a min-width of 601px \nMedium screens are defined as having a min-width of 961px \nLarge screens are defined as having a min-width of 1280px\nExtra Large screens are defined as having a min-width of 1920px\n.

There is no pulse for rectangular buttons according to the official Google documentation https://material.io/guidelines/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-what-makes-a-good-transition. The images are probably blocked by one of your browser extensions. Take a look at your browser console and also in the network tab of the Chrome developer tools and check if the images are loaded.. Take a look at the address bar on the right side next to the star / favourite icon. Click this small image icon with the red x.\nAlso what is the version of your Chrome browser (check chrome://version)?. > I think you should add that nobody should commit compiled files aswell.\nedit ===  commit here on GitHub if you mean this..

We could copy it but as already mentioned, not sure if bug or how it should work. @Dogfalo \n and @acburst are the maintainers who can tell more as this is not described in the docs\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4545#issuecomment-295362079. @sandor could you try something like\nJavaScript\n    if (options.swipeable) {\n        if ($tabs_content.length) {\n            $tabs_content.carousel('set', index);\n            if (typeof(options.onShow) === \"function\") { // add\n                options.onShow.call(this, $content); // these\n            } // lines\n        }\n    }. @edinantox updated the code, please test again.\n@sandor please provide a codepen for us so we can check it with your markup.. Ok, seems we can directly use $content, missed that.. It seems elem.image was removed but not added again.\nSee https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/52c5b850a67df72c6ffa813917918fd39dce755f\n@acburst. Don't we already have the discrete slider? Didn't someone create a stepper and mention it in the Gitter chats?. Still open as you can see, not merged yet.. The mixins Sass file contains no actual code and should be removed.\nNot sure if we should really rename the colors file to palette. This would also be a small breaking change in existing projects which upgrade to a new version with this change in the future.\nThe docs have to be checked too if we have references to colors which should be changed.. Nevertheless, good PR and makes much sense.. It was changed to autocompleteOptions.data but this breaking change was not mentioned in the changelog but the docs were updated (or did I miss this?). http://materializecss.com/chips.html#properties\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/05c48b15c3e2f908769aaeb66db2834349a3831b\ncc @acburst when he is back next week. Not sure what you mean, this works https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zwqdgX. Also with the other codepen? Which Firefox version?. I see it now and will find a solution. Please test the change from the PR (also applied here).. Can you please also try each of the following and let me know which work and wich do not work.\nJavaScript\n$select.find('option').eq(i).selected = true;\n$select.find('option')[i].selected = true;\n$select.val($select.find('option').eq(i).val());\nMight be a bit better than the fix in the PR.. No problem. You just mentioned the line number in the generated file, not in the actual source file of the component ;-). Probably duplicate of https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4380. What about deleting jquery.easing.1.3?. Sure, the other issue is fixed but there are failing tests due to components which have to be fixed for jQuery 3.. Right, oversaw this.

Related: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4582\nJust use .on('change' with something like $('#selectid').val() (that would be for <select id=\"selectid\">\u2026</select>).. Please always fork and fill out the codepen, you did not provide any code. And also change the texts when creating the issue, this was just a template.. Does this change solve this?\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/4555/files. Can you provide a simple codepen so we can track down where we have to set this exactly so we can publish this fix in the next version?. @inventti-leonardo any ideas as you have also worked more with the taptarget code? I guess some wrong calculations are problematic too. I am currently just on my smartphone. Hard to work this way.. Can you provide a codepen with your code?. So far I can see in the sourcecode, that the click is just caught on the input but not on the caret: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/js/forms.js\n($newSelect is the input text field and it has focus and click listeners). You could add a click listener to the caret which calls .trigger('open') on the generated text input (traverse up using jQuery.closest()).\nNormally the caret lies behind an element which catches the click event.. What about $select-background in the variables?\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/sass/components/forms/_select.scss\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/sass/components/_variables.scss. Seems we have to change this and also catch the click on the caret by default? Background be behind the caret imho.. Currently not, I am not on my place.\n@fega @tomscholz do you have some ideas for the best solution?. Please move the js file to the end of your body.\nhttp://materializecss.com/getting-started.html\n\n\nJavaScript should be generally loaded when the rest of the markup / DOM is ready / available.. > I was hoping to update the options in the select right before the select actually opens.\nUpdating the original select and its options and then reinitializing the select should work.\nCombine this with $('select').on('change').\nDo you have any code so far?\nYou can also catch the open event of the generated select.. @Native-Coder get the values, reset and the the values again?. Sure\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4595#issuecomment-296802384\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/js/forms.js#L620. Can you provide a codepen of the code that you tried so far?. I guess we just use jQuery.text() and so we only get the text from the original option elements.\nIs an icon in a select option part of the md specs @tomscholz?. Or prefixed like some other functions, $.fn.material_toast.. @TetianaP just clone and run Grunt in the directory of Materialize to build a new file using the js_compile task.. @knight7024 did you try 0.100.0 or newer?. grunt travis --filter=tabs should help with local tests. It might be that another timeout is needed around the\nnormalTabs.find('.tab').each(function() {\n        tabsScrollWidth += $(this).width();\n      });\nafter the .css() code. I will test this here with your branch in about an hour.. Ok. So on your system the test in the branch did not fail? Will test it here on Windows. Might be that the PhantomJS driver and the headless webkit on Travis under Linux is a bit slower (at least the free plan has less power than the paid ones)?. Then the change did nothing as it should havr fixed the failing test ;-) I will check this for you.. Please test this locally\nit(\"should horizontally scroll when too many tabs\", function (done) {\n      var tabsScrollWidth = 0;\n      normalTabs.parent().css('width', '400px');\n      normalTabs.find('.tab').each(function() {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n          tabsScrollWidth += $(this).width();\n        }, 0);\n      });\n      setTimeout(function() {\n        expect(tabsScrollWidth).toBeGreaterThan(normalTabs.width(), 'Scroll width should exceed tabs width');\n        done();\n      }, 400);\n    });. I guess this is due to the calculation and\n\nThe value reported by .width() is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element or its parent is hidden. To get an accurate value, ensure the element is visible before using .width(). jQuery will attempt to temporarily show and then re-hide an element in order to measure its dimensions, but this is unreliable and (even when accurate) can significantly impact page performance. This show-and-rehide measurement feature may be removed in a future version of jQuery.\n\nand how they get this\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/2.2-stable/src/dimensions.js#L44\nI think one of the dependencies (could be the headless webkit of PhantomJS) introduced some changes to the DOM rendering.. Looks good =). Do you mean this? https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4375#issuecomment-288558471\nIt was fixed in 0.98.2. See http://codepen.io/anon/pen/YVxRed. Please fill out the codepen.. Catch the click on the icon and deliver the click event to the dropdown.\nIs this example / case described in our docs (dropdown with icon)?. Try this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wdqQVG. Sure, it works. Take a look at https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jGoWmR which uses 0.100.2. If not please provide a codepen with your code and check your browser console for any errors.. @SurajMDurgad try onAutoComplete instead of Autocomplete.. Also make sure to use uppercase c.. jQuery is not loaded in your example.. Meant lowercase c, sorry.. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/KXLJba\nIt should work.. Did you include jQuery UI? Because this has its own .autocomplete() and conflicts with Materialize. Mixing UI libraries is never a good idea @SurajMDurgad . I've added a PR for this.. Definitely a good idea.. @pmargreff I doubt the translation files are stored here. Or did you see them in the repository?. This is probably a feature of your browser or framework / webapp. Did you try to not use localhost?\nNot directly related to Materialize.. The status code was 522 (connection timed out) which is currently not the case. \nJust as a sidenote: always try to use the local files and host the files yourself instead of relying on a CDN (for application critical assets).\nImho it makes more sense to apen an issue in the cdnjs repository.. https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues/11212. It seems they resolved this, see https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues/11212#issuecomment-300413878. http://fallback.io and other fallback approaches / solutions might be a good idea.. > multi channel chat room\nGitter also supports multiple channels. Administrators have to create them.\nKeep in mind that there are very few contributors and this whole structure would require huge efforts from the whole community.\nNonetheless great ideas but this will likely not happen in the near future.\nWhat we need are mentors, meetups, more great webcasts, courses and mainly developers pushing the project forward.. Sorry, oversaw this. Might be unproblematic. I see no direct problems arising from the Sass code or the JavaScript component.. Well, 0.97.8 is an old version and this was added / fixed in a newer version. The docs are always for the latest release.. Please try if it works with 0.98.2.. Sure but why more jQuery dependencies when you can do the same without?\nAlso some components do not use or rely on jQuery. Generally it is not needed and one target is to rewrite all components and just use plain vanilla JavvaScript / ES5/6.. Generally it should work. Can you provide a codepen to illustrate the issue?. Hm, it works here (on mobile): https://codepen.io/anon/pen/wdEvjM. Please provide a codepen. Generally click should work when the image is in the center / selected.. See https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/5b71e271a5126c58b7b725e58a1af76933b71303\nAnd no, this is probably not available on the CDN as it uses tagged releases afaik. You may have to clone the repository and compile with Grunt.. Well, here it worked. Did you add the code right before the search / keypress method and recompile or directly change the unminified js file?\nThe dropdown was open and the input focussed and automatically updated itself.\nI could also test and integrate some data method (an event with the new data as parameter) if I find the time.\nSo far the code worked on my side while the input was focused and was open. Maybe I have to check if it is currently opened or not and return / exit if it is not.. > Just make sure I get things right. I download the repository from your branch and load the minified JS in the dist folder.\nClone / download the branch f the PR, go to the new directory, run npm install and then grunt and use the generated files from dist or bin.. > Another thing is my autocomplete starts when the first letter is input. There is no dropdown when the autocomplete initiated. Will your solution takes care of situation like this?\nCurrently not. A check if the dropdown is populated / shown is not yet implemented.. cc @tomscholz. cc @tomscholz. Also should we improve it and add a check if it is open? I guess so. Will prepare another commit later and push it to the branch. Should work much better.\nPS: Imho CDNs are not a good idea anymore. http2, hosting the file yourself and having a fallback when the CDN is not available, extra DNS lookups and requests, SRI, ....

This would be great.\nDo you have more info about your envitonment (browser, OS and so on)?. Sounds like we have to cache / store some data to check against it.\n\nis it possible to keep the ul and just update the data\n\nRequires a bit more work and planning. I did not yet have the time to implement this further but I guess this would be related to https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4714#issuecomment-304250161 where I would also check the length of the children and the last value to decide if rerendering is needed and improve the rendering process to inject the new data on the right position as just appending it might not always be the right solution so I would have to diff the old and new data to get the position to inject it without rerendering the whole part..

It's recommended to fork Msterialize, create a new feature branch, add the files in sass/ and js/ and docs in /jade, add the files to the Gruntfile, test locally and push it to GitHub and open a new pull request for this.. You have to initialize it using $('.modal').modal().\nPlease provide a codepen.. > However, in browsers that do not support passive event listeners, the third parameter is a boolean to indicate whether the event should bubble or capture.

Probably https://github.com/ebidel/lighthouse-ci might be useful in the future.. I guess the others are variations like btn, btn-large, btn-floating (similar to BEM style?).\nNot sure. Is this a critical issue (I doubt it)? Changing this would mean we introduce breaking changes and would have to change the docs and other places where this is used.. @tomscholz Right.\nI agree with both of you. How could we safely transition to one style in all files and slowly deprecate the old one?\nFor the beginning we would have to identify all places where this has to be changed, extend the rules (add the new class names and keep the old ones), probably somehow add some todo comments and make some roadmap when the old ones should be removed.\nSuggestions for some good approach (and let other developers now about the transition and deprecation process)?. @tomscholz shouldn't we keep this open and check all other lines and remaining files too or do you have this in one board of the projects so we can take another look at it again in the future?. @tomscholz shouldn't we keep this open and check all other lines and remaining files too or do you have this in one board of the projects so we can take another look at it again in the future?. Do you mean the shadow?. See https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4580. A codepen would be very useful. Does this happen with Materialize 0.98.2?. > And which browser are you using?\nAccording to the picture it should be Mozilla Firefox (stable) ;-). @SirMaxime the class .blue takes precedence over the rules of the element so you have to add the class to your CSS.\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/dWLeLJ\nBecause .blue also uses !important.. Or add another class for the color.. Try the undocumented onCycleTo option:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/Lyvwoj\n@fega @tomscholz should we add this option to the docs?. @NonameSLdev @fega ideas for better names (if really needed) and some good description for the docs?.

I agree with @tomscholz.\nSo developers always have the docs for their version if they download the full archive (from GitHub).. Probably element.find('> li')?. A PR makes clear what the changes are that are needed to fix this.\nMy thought was that this is related to transforms.. > This issue is caused by the transform property: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20851452/z-index-is-canceled-by-setting-transformrotate on each li\n\nAt the end of the animation it is transform: translateX(0px), it needs to be transform: none\nNot sure if this is a Materialize issue or velocity issue\n\nNot directly. This is a known CSS issue with transforms in most cases. We might change it to transform: none when a single list element has finished with its animation.. This is a HTML5 feature. Browsers / clients can warn but you should implement this also serverside. I agree with @tomscholz.. Makes sense imho https://github.com/humanmade/hm-pattern-library/issues/75\nCan you link the WCAG (2.0) guideline / rule (is it 3.1)?. > @DanielRuf It used to be 3.1 of WCAG 2.0 however I've just had a good look through and can't actually find any reference to over-use of capitalisation anymore. Hopefully it's gone and I can tell our clients that it's no longer relevant next time they mention it!\nExactly. I just saw\n\nUsing upper and lower case according to the spelling rules of the text language (future link)\n\nBut it seems they do not get much clearer and also in the WCAG C22 technique rules they use an uppercase class.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C22.html#C22-ex7\nSo it looks like this is ok now?. I think he generally means the removed line in the linked commit (and the error when a drag event occurs) even which has unexpected results and does not reliably filter the vertical scroll event.. Caution, calc is not supported by older browsers, especially the integrates browser on Android, see http://caniuse.com/#feat=calc\nSo this is not really redundant but some sort of fallback.. Please use\n$(\"select\").material_select({\nonSet: function () {\nthis.close();\n},\n});\nThis may be due to the tab catching the event which is not propagating to the generated select.. @tomscholz @fega hm, we should check multiselect too but in this case there we have to keep it open to allow the selection of multiple values, especially on mobile browsers. Do we have a close bitton for the multiselect like for the datepicker?. @tomscholz @fega hm, we should check multiselect too but in this case there we have to keep it open to allow the selection of multiple values, especially on mobile browsers. Do we have a close bitton for the multiselect like for the datepicker?. The issue is, that there is an animation when a select / dropdown is closed. Setting the duration parameter of this and removing a setTimeout \"fixes\" this.\nSee the following comparison (left side is the original file, right side is the modified file).\n\nYou can test the change here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/owBGBj\nIt comes from the dropdown component which is also used for selects: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/2746daeed242088a298fd4b0b06f6ce2c2242f6a/js/dropdown.js\n@tomscholz @acburst How should we fix this? I fear the change on the right side is not how it should be as this \"removes\" the fadeOut animation (we could also use hide()).\nMh, probably we should allow to set the dropdown options from the select component too.. @Dogfalo can you link us to the specific commit?. Probably add both icons, add some overflow:hidden; to the container of the icon, a CSS3 transition or animation for :hover.. I guess this requires a bigger rewrite of the component and would be a breaking change.\nAnd I think it would be good to extend this to other components where components have no context and no classes and are solely styled depending on the tags.\nThis would also fix other issues (https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4764 https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4661 https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4660) and ease the general usage with own styles.. @tomscholz @fega could we create a board for this and collect related issues?. Meant project https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/projects\nStill confusing this with Trello and other solutions.\nWe should collect the affected files and components and mark the lines using the commit hashes.\nProbably one component after another but as separate branch for a later release so things do not break too often (eg each new release brings a new refactored component).\nMaybe as bleeding edge non-stable for testers and not as normal release and as new major release (probably also refactoring and replace jQuery with vanilla JavaScript) after SemVer.. @donacross I totally agree with all your points and your thoughts about this and these are some good recommendations for a possible roadmap.\nSure, jQuery is stll part of some other dependencies.\nThe goal is to have more performant and native ES6/7 components as jQuery as abstraction layer adds some unneeded overhead and constraint in many cases.\nThis would also make the components consumable for more projects and solutions where you do or can not directly work with the real DOM.\nThe ideal solution in this case would be truly independent components which could be easier leveraged in projects based on React, Vue.js and other solutions.\n@fega @tomscholz your thoughts on this?. Looks good!. The Material Design specification and guides do not define or offer outline buttons. Just raised or flat.\nBootstrap and Bulma do not follow these specs.. I guess 996 would also work as the overlay has 997. Can you test this with a (fixed) navbar and a FAB?. Please test #4784.. Not a duplicate imo, just adds the default keyword.. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EXVqjV\nAlso please use the Gitter channel for such general questions as this is not a bug but an integration question.. Sure, you clone a div which contains both selects at the top.\nhttps://gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize It is also linked in the readme.\nDid you want to achieve this? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/RgrbYb.

I can't see a change. What is it I'm SUPPOSED to do exactly? Pull from a certain branch?\nYou have to recompile the files either with grunt js_compile or grunt release or another task like grunt monitor. Keep an eye on the date and time of the files. They should be in bin (and dist when using the release task).\nThe dist folder does not contain the latest minified files, just the minified files of the last release..

The patch is already in there (as commit in the master branch). You can pull any new commits with git pull origin master. After this run npm install and grunt release|monitor|js_compile.. That's not really a novice if you have this experience.\n\nDoes that mean it's safe for me to assume that when an issue is resolved, I can pull the mater branch to get that particular commit?\n\nYes, if the PR was merged / the commit added to the branch. You can check that with git pull && git log.\n\nDo I need to run npm install and grunt if all I'm doing is using the minified js and css files?\n\nYes. It should be grunt monitor or grunt release.\n\nLastly, what is the difference between release monitor and js_compile?\n\nrelease compiles and creates all files (zip, dist, bin, docs - should run all tasks). monitor compiles sass and js (running js_compile and sass_compile and the other smaller tasks) and recompiles if there are changes (file watcher / monitoring). And js_compile just combines the components to a single js file. You can check these tasks in the Gruntfile.. > What I don't know is how to clone that branch or commit or whatever it is that fixed the issue.\nThe master branch?

Well, most people need a quick overview and directly the information they are looking for instead of reading another full page about the icons and trying to find the needed text as it is a bit hidden ;-)\nNot sure how many people would ask then how they can include the icons.\nThink about a good UX when people read our docs and they await all the needed information there.\nI guess we should hear the opinion of other developers and the rest of the community and then make decisions. Because removing things is probably not a big problem for intermediate and professional developers but makes it harder for beginners which are new to Materialize.\nJust my opinion on this topic. Because the linked site contains much unneeded information and does not summarise it to a few important points. Keep it short and simple.. The inline style is from the sidenav component https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/js/sideNav.js. Seems we need a fix like https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/d9d0028e55d5477d66761fe53231e8750c22b5ba.\n. I guess you mean overflow and not override.. @alexisdiel it is just in the docs as far as I can see it.. ~~Fixes https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4814~~\nPS: overflowY without quotes should also work.. This is the wrong file, please change the right lines in the sidenav.js file. https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/js/sideNav.js\nThe file that you edited is just for the docs.\nCan you create a simple codepen with a sidenav and check if there is also this issue? \nAlso it looks more like an issue with paddings or margins which we should solve (not by changing the overflow). Probably boxmodel related.. As @tomscholz wrote, not part of the official Material Design guidelines. @aheinze created something here: https://codepen.io/arturheinze/details/ZGvOMw. > I think we should wait on a resolution in the debate before we start making PRs.\nExactly. I just prepared a PR if we want to go this way.. See the following line: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/2746daeed242088a298fd4b0b06f6ce2c2242f6a/js/dropdown.js#L169\nWe need a fix for fixed parent elements as position() gets the wrong value, we probably need offset().\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/26844757/offset-top-is-not-working-as-expected-in-if-parent-element-is-fixed. @bukibarak there are more lines probably. I'll prepare a modified version of the component and create a simple codepen and a PR for it.. Probably related issues:\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4582\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4714. @ramsaymax should be generally possible with the right event listeners which add the extra options to the select / dropdown and rerencer it (may still need to trigger close/open).\nSo far we have no method to directly add new options to the select as the rendering process and the creation of the shown inputs is a bit more. Generally your and the other linked issues make sense but it is much more work to implement this and change the existing methods.. @shmshd12 sure, you can mix custom HTML, even flat buttos, with toasts, see https://codepen.io/anon/pen/awWWQr\nYou should be also able to change the layout and overwrite values for paddings and margins.. I did not ignore it but provided a viable solution as HTML was already allowed.\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4553. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MomyVX\n@bert-w you have to call validateField on the needed element(s) to trigger the validation:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/jwmmRx\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/XgRgrw\n@tomscholz we do not have this documented. Should we add a section to the docs about manually triggering the validation on fields using validateField? Makes sense imo.\nFields which have the valid and invalid classes should also use the validate class to listen for the changes and properly validate the value.. Will take a closer look later.. @smileytechguy that's what I also had in my mind. This might help to reduce issues which only occur in unsupported browsers and Materialize versions and to know what they've already tried. (Checkboxes like \"disabled / flushed the cache\").\nWe should provide master releases (bleeding edge) so they can test it against the current master branch as there are often issues fixed but without any relation to a PR or issue.. So far very good and important points there. Leaves much less room for guesswork.\nWe should keep an eye on the code of conduct and styleguides of other great projects and adapt their actively used templates (I guess you already know about the new community page under insights @tomscholz).. They do since March =) https://twitter.com/lorempixel/status/842398954767716352. @Dogfalo it's shipped with Chrome 59 (on Windows it will be in Chrome 60) which was released this month afaik.\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome.

Ah, but does it provide a table like SauceLab does or just the single success / failed indicator for pushes?. @Snewk did you try to add a wrapper div around the nav and give it the navbar-fixed class?

And you can also directly use the SVG files of the Material icons. Just insert the SVG and remove the pointer events on it (because an i tag also has no pointer events and the clicked icon should not get the event but the surrounding title):\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/QggjJz\nThis is not a bug in Materialize but a (well) known problem with SVG files.\n@tomscholz shall we document this?. @tomscholz they use it, see https://getmdl.io/started/index.html.. @tomscholz as far as I can see this is only for combining classnames. I did not see any otger references which really include the font ;-). @tomscholz I can not reproduce this ;-)\n\n\nAnyway, the mentioned pointer-events solution should be sufficient.. @tomscholz maybe you've installed the iconfont on your system?\nhttps://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/iconfont. \\o/ Rick and Morty font =).

Would use jQuery by default and jQuery 2 if 2 is in the root package.json. But imho it makes not much sense to support IE10 and there is jQuery.noConflict() if people need different versions. It's time to move on.. @tomscholz we should maybe print a message to the console that says that we will drop jQuery 2 in the future (forever), lower the jQuery requirement like you recommend and push a new release.\nGet the version with jQuery.fn.jquery\nor jQuery().jquery, split it at ., shift it or directly use the first element of the result and use console.log(our_warning_message); if it is equal to 2.. @tomscholz we should maybe print a message to the console that says that we will drop jQuery 2 in the future (forever), lower the jQuery requirement like you recommend and push a new release.\nGet the version with jQuery.fn.jquery\nor jQuery().jquery, split it at ., shift it or directly use the first element of the result and use console.log(our_warning_message); if it is equal to 2.. Well, that's why I did not want to reset it to a lower jQuery requirement but it seems many developers and thirdparty libraries, scripts and CMS still use jQuery 2. In this case they can use jQuery.noConflict and other solutions but you know that this is not an easy task for most.\n@Dogfalo what is your opinion about this? Should developers push thirdparty dependencies to be jQuery 3 compatible?\nIt's a bit hard as some have / want to support older browsers but this also prevents the usage of modern solutions (native jQuery alternatives for the DOM, flexbox, CSS grid, CSS variables and other features).. @jacobq\nIt is about other frameworks like Yii2\n\nYii2 requires jQuery 2.2.4.

Solution: filter the event (button/buttons/which).. Not sure why it should be 16 on inputs and 14 / 14.5 or 16 on the body.. Forcing it to 16px for all users of the framework is not a solution.. Please provide a codepen which shows this issue.. Shouldn't materialize come before the main.js file?. The problem is that collapsible-header has now padding: 1rem because of your custom CSS.

Also see https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/4461\nThe long versions are better.. Should we still keep the unused / empty mixins file? For me it makes no sense to keep it.. https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/sass/components/_mixins.scss. I see the transitions (the labels) when I tab through the fields. Can you describe in detail what's broken and how it should be?. @fega you mean the animated label and color? I still see the animation. Tested on Chrome mobile 58.\nPlease test it in Firefox and other browsers. This should still work.. Did you test in Chrome 58? Still not reproducible here.. I just see some jump in the textarea but it has transition on all properties.\nTested on Chrome 59 on MacOS. But still no issues with the normal inputs.. Take a look at https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/81ab9ba3654fdbaca88d0f18a1a7f7998424e725. I guess we need some regression testing or similar as part of the CI workflow.. Probably the transition should be on more values, why not use it on all properties?. transition: transform .2s ... should include the transition for the top value and probably some more ;-). An input should have the (correct) type.\nRelying on browser defaults is not a good solution.\nThis means we have somewhere in the Sass a rule for type=text but missed the missing type declaration.. @fega should we cover this case in the Sass code?. You should create a new row after the third l4 element.\nPlease provide a codepen..

I see. Well I did this:\nvar checkTabs = function(){\n        var active = $('ul.tabs .active').attr('href');\n        $('ul.tabs').tabs('select_tab', active);\n        console.log(active);\n    }\nAnd it doesn't work and the active is giving me the correct id too.\nvar checkTabs = function(){\n        $('ul.tabs').tabs();\n        var active = $('ul.tabs .active').attr('href');\n        $('.tabs-content ' + active).show();\n    }\nThis works ^.\n.

This issue is hard to reproduce\n. @loolooii  Yeah,i got the steps to reproduce the issue, when making a tab(secondary tab) inside an other tab(main tab) makes the indicator of the secondary tab invisible, as @joxmar said the only way to get it showing is by either resizing or selecting the tab,Here is an example \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/80jkvumd/\nEDIT: you cant see the issue on fiddle you have to copie that in a real html file(dont forget resources like mrl.css mtr.js and jquery)\nEDIT2: as @evallgar said, This NOT a browser issue.\n.

The issue can be fixed by setting a height on the collapsed item.

Just calculate the height of the div and put it in the css. I'm searching for a general sollution for my project. If I found some then I will submit it to the git.\nA quick fix is to write an error in de complete function. Then the height of the div will be placed and the collapslible-body will be shown.\n.

How to reproduce ? \nI am not having this problem.\n. Yeah, this is happened to me too, to reproduce this issue, you have to create a btn with waves on and click it for a long time, this btn should have some thing like \"#\" in the href, i mean this bnt dont teleport you to another page this can be seen in the web page as example chifrebird.blogspot.com(nav bar ; doesn't apply on the Home btn cause it refresh the page) if you hver over the btn again the effect will be gone.\n. :+1: \n.

Else i will wait till it is released. Ok. will sync and try to build and host the repo.. @joshuadazar Can you elaborate your comment?. Alternatively we should not react on the selected list item.

This seems to be fixed.  Using your codepen, if I run $('.button-collapse').sideNav('show'); twice, however with a 0.1s delay between, it works as expected (rehides, overlay is removed). The issue is how the sideNav function works, as it does its action asynchronously, allowing for 2 calls simultaneously to occur.  This PR should be closed and a separate one made to fix this issue.. All the way in 2018, still asking to be reopened.. @shardy613 if you want to install 1.0.0-beta you may use npm i --save materialize-css@1.0.0-beta per the version list (click \"22 versions\" near the top-right) and this SO thread on installing a specific version from NPM.. @shardy613 I added a pull request (#5782) which adds that command to the readme.

Added interactive playground for CSS grid documentation\nAllows addition and removal of elements in order to test offset, push, pull, etc.\nCurrently resides at the bottom of the grid page\n\nIn the future, I may attempt making each of the examples further up the page interactive.\nDemonstration:\n\nFor some reason the gif plays very slow, sorry about that. I modified it some, now you can click on the box directly and edit it\n\n. In addition, I made it so most of the other examples on the grid.html page is editable\n\nIf I could get some feedback from contributors before I continue and do more, that would be great. @tomscholz I understand the concerns, and maybe the inline edit is confusing, as the descriptions give the premade examples context.  However, I think the \"Try It\" would be a pretty cool feature, and I'm not sure how you would do it all on one page, apart from just rendering HTML as inputted.. @tomscholz I understand the concerns, and maybe the inline edit is confusing, as the descriptions give the premade examples context.  However, I think the \"Try It\" would be a pretty cool feature, and I'm not sure how you would do it all on one page, apart from just rendering HTML as inputted.. To comment on the above - the issue for implementation for a timepicker is several years old, and has many PRs of different implementations, however nothing has been merged. yeah, its pretty amazing!  already under 800. Can we get some spacing between the time and AM/PM here: \n ?\nAlso, maybe a way to customize the displayed date format?  Also, the datepicker on mobile looks like ovals\nFinally, if we could get some waves would be cool too\n. Awesome!  Could you maybe make a codepen or something with this so I can test it?. @philipraets ~In Google Chrome the pen seems to randomly refresh as soon as it renders~ I like it, a few things i would suggest:\nUsing material selects on the dropdowns\nWaves for buttons/clicks\n24 hour option. alright, thanks . It looks great so far!  One more request: the ability to choose a color for it. @Dogfalo I say let the user handle it, most other components require the user to manage stuff like that. Materialize does not use flex box, which that requires. However, I think it's on the roadmap. . Materialize does not use flex box, which that requires. However, I think it's on the roadmap. . i think we have full bleed dividers, with div.divider (http://materializecss.com/grid.html). @tomscholz Timepicker PR: 4445\nMaybe we should comment specific issues and PRs relevant next to each one?\n. I'm not familiar with angular's specifics, but shouldn't you be able to use something along the lines of \njs\n$(\"#myButton\").click(function() {\n  // do stuff\n});\nwhere you have a button with id myButton. I'm not familiar with angular's specifics, but shouldn't you be able to use something along the lines of \njs\n$(\"#myButton\").click(function() {\n  // do stuff\n});\nwhere you have a button with id myButton. Does the above code by @rsella have adverse effects in other browsers?  If it fixes the issue in chrome, why not implement it?. @atlabiz I used the following and it works fine:\ncss\n.dropdown-content li > a, .dropdown-content li > span {\n    color: rgb(245, 124, 0);\n}\nWhere rgb(245, 124,0); is the color you want. Right here: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize#supported-browsers. We could maybe list a few examples, such as very common ones (grade, account_circle, etc.) just like 4 or 5 to start with, and then link to the official page.  I like that it lists a small handful just for examples sake, as that is very helpful when teaching people how to use materialize (they get overwhelmed if i show them the full page at first, as there are so many, and will take 15 minutes picking one).. @Native-Coder I looked at what @DanielRuf posted it and expanded it to match what you needed: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/owzQWM.  If the img element lacks a src attribute, it will add the avatar effect, otherwise it will just display the image as normal.. I think we should wait on a resolution in the debate before we start making PRs.. If anyone else has this issue, the problem most likely is your use of .modal-close buttons.  If you want to submit a form, use jQuery like so:\njs\n$(\"#yourButtonId\").click(function() {\n    $(\"#yourFormId\").submit();\n});. @DanielRuf the .on API is .on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler ).  Why would you use the modal as the selected element?. Ah, I see.  Thanks, I didn't know that, all my code uses .click or similar!. I like it.  A suggestion I'd like to make is to add a troubleshooting checklist, such as latest version, tired isolated (no additional plugins), checked console, stuff like that.  We could use the homebrew-cask repository's as an example https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/new. Oops, alright! Closing!. Oops, alright! Closing!. Can you please make a codepen? I am unable to reproduce your issue. Can you please make a codepen? I am unable to reproduce your issue.

Fixes it, thanks!  @WillTheVideoMan this can be closed; I will submit a PR in a few to correct the docs (if I can D:). Looking at the source, it seems like 97c450bb23c02dca2016b3e6bf72717ce25024c2 is what broke everything.. Do we need to include the span if we only want error/success messages, not the helper text?. It looks like there are many benefits, per the changelog: https://github.com/fians/Waves/releases\n\nAdd support for co-existing with some other things users may use\nRemove unused transition propertied\nDon't do the wave effect while scrolling (this one is a bug I've faced many times in my own applications)\nFixes errors on rapid clicking\nDon't ripple when the disabled property is set\nDon't use z-index in CSS\nAnd, to top it off, fix a memory leak\n\n. I wouldn't think any of this would cause issues. No problem!  Saw those comments on that GH issue and thought that might help others who were struggling similarly.. @Dogfalo Perhaps, if IE 11 is still needed, you guys could provide an alternate legacy build, like Shopify/draggable does.  If this can be done in the SASS engine itself this shouldn't be too difficult.. ",

You can just set 'display:none' for collapsible-body and remove active class on li\n. You can build materialize css from sass with a prefix to all classes, with postcss.\nThere are several projects could help with this, ex:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-selector-prefix\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-class-prefix\n. Could you please provide a codepen that reproduce the problem?\n. See  https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/586#issuecomment-255769998\n. Looks like duplicate for #3849\n. @NitroBAY and @Levino can you be a bit respectful of the hard work that maintainers do?\nEveryone makes mistakes, and actually, this one was no so very hard to find and fix for you.\nMaintaining an open source project is a source of constant abuse from ungrateful users. Some toxic users start thinking that you're under obligation to give your time for free and that's very disappointing.\nI'm leaving here two links, I hope both of you can read them and better understand the consequences.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5c3f7q/brett_cannon_why_i_took_october_off_from_oss/\nhttp://www.snarky.ca/why-i-took-october-off-from-oss-volunteering\n. > >  a project with 1000 open issues and people releasing braking changes as patches should be discontinued\nThat's actually a good example of toxic behavior.\nAs a maintainer of several Python packages, I just can say that the first @GuillermoBlanco and several :+1:  under it was completely enough to raise an issue. If anyone other thought that writing things like a shame, thank you for wasting my time, a project should be discontinued and :+1: under such kind of messages will help somehow to maintainers to resolve this, it's not true.\nI'm not a javascript guy, but I've got the same problem several times already with other packages. Ex, this one was related a minor update in Babel. I don't think that Babel project author is wrong in some way, even b/c the issue was never resolved.\nThe yarn.lock was introduced exactly b/c that's the default npm behavior is the problem for everyone.\n. I don't see something unusual or critical.  W3c standard always was far away from real browsers implementation.\n. Duplicate #3865\n. Check this one - http://codepen.io/kmmbvnr/pen/XNXVaY\nYou just need carefully follow the documentation,\nThe only inconsstence issue that navbar expects the class=\"active\" on a <li> elements, but scrollspy set active class in <a> elements.\nSo you have to specify manually \na.active {\n  background-color: #ea454b;\n}\n. @yanickrochon Can you provide a codepen that demonstrates the issue with bounding box testing?. Mm, for me it looks too late to remove a scroll listener when onScroll event happened.\nIt's better to manage component state explicitly and remove listeners as soon as component been destroyed.\n@acburst can we have an ability to destroy a scrollSpy? Ex:\njavacript\n  $('.selector').scrollSpy('destroy');\nThat's like the MaterializeCSS have for the selects $('select').material_select('destroy');. I strongly disagree. Removing jQuery could increase maintenance and new feature adding costs. \nEven Bootstrap the most popular css framework depends on jQuery and it seems pretty fine. \n. You can get an image url from the background-image style attribute of <img> tag\n$('.slider li.active img').css('background-image'). Very nice. \nI'm thinking about to start new project awesome-materialize - curated list of 3d party libs and tips to work with MaterializeCSS. Are there any codepens that demonstrate the use cases?.

I think one problem is that not only the _variables.scss needs changes but for example different colors need to be added or font-sizes adjusted. Updates on materialize overwrite these changes. \nSASS overwrites double declarations as far as I know. (for example h1 {font-size:20px} in _first.scss followed by h1 {font-size:24px} in _second.scss -- only h1 {font-size:24px} is in the output css).\nThe best option seems to clone the .scss files and include them after the original files in a new materialize.scss file. So all manual changes overwrite/complement the originals but updates do not overwrite changes. \nObviously if bigger changes are made the manual updates still would need a rework but that's unavoidable during alpha.\nEdit: I tested this but got inconclusive results. Sometimes the first and sometimes the second import seems to be used. I need to research how sass (or gulp-ruby-sass in my case) handles double declarations. Maybe @sindresorhus can answer that.\n.

Materialize.updateTextFields(); doesn't seem to help. Were you able to solve it?\n. @orlax Thank you for your reply. The thing is, I WANT the browser to autofill the form. I don't want users to have to put in their login details every time they clear their browser data...?\n. Ok so the problem with the password field, is actually a Chromium 'bug', which prevents password scraping. Read about it in detail here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=352527\nNone of the solutions mentioned here work to fix the password field, except polling, because there is no callback / change event for the password field autofill. It's only shown as filled, but not actually filled, until the user interacts with the page (so scripts triggering clicks won't work either).\nWith polling, you'd check for $(\"#at-field-password:-webkit-autofill\").length (which is still 0 on Meteor's template onRendered callback) and then add active class to the label $(\"#at-field-password:-webkit-autofill\").prev().addClass(\"active\") Use inside try... catch block, because non-webkit browsers can throw an error.\n. :+1: I'm also all for the Android/Lolliclock implementation. Don't care if it's the same on web as on mobile.\n. Like other people, I'm using materialize.clockpicker from @chingyawhao. Why not create a PR based on that? Visually at least it's very nice..

This seems to be fixed now. Can somebody confirm?\n. Apparently the 60px bottom padding prevents a bug on mobile, when the page is scrollable, because dragging down in the menu, scrolls the whole page, too (unlike on desktop) and therefore makes the address bar at the top disappear. So the viewport gets bigger and theres a gap of the height of the address bar (60px) at the bottom of the menu.\nThis problem could be prevented if the page did not scroll when dragging the menu.\n. https://medium.com/@owencm/designing-great-uis-for-progressive-web-apps-dd38c1d20f7\nRecommendation 3: Touching an element while scrolling shouldn\u2019t trigger touch feedback\n\nThe issue was fixed by aborting the ripple animation if the user\u2019s touch location moved more than 6 pixels in any direction within the first few hundred milliseconds.\n. \n",

I will investigate. \n. I have no idea what happened. I reloaded the original page and now it works. Sorry for the inconvenience lads and thank you for the help. \n. Hold on. It's broken again. \nThe problem seems to happen when an Angular template is involved:\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\nWinball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{ theme.name }}\n\n\n{{ theme.author }}\nStuff\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- 3rd party libraries -->\n<script src=\"bower_components/jQuery/dist/jquery.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"materialize/js/materialize.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Load app main script -->\n<script src=\"app/app.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Load controllers -->\n<script src=\"app/controllers/mainController.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Load custom directives -->\n<script src=\"app/directives/material-nav.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n```\nAny thoughts? \n. @Dogfalo Rather something to do with the code being inside of an Angular template?

PR: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/4556. Wrapping the function that creates these colors in a variable could solve the problem.\nWe would have to split the current _colors.scss file into two files: _colors.scss and _color-palette.scss.\nThe palette would only contain the palette and the sass function, that allows you to access the colors via color(\"name_of_color\", \"type_of_color\"). The _colors.scss file would only contain the if statement, that optionally generates all the colors and the primary/secondary classes. \nWith these changes, you could easily access the palette by importing it before anything else.\nE.g.:\n_variables.scss:\nscss\n// Setting this to false will prevent materialize from generating classes for all colors from the color pallette.\n// We highly recommend to set this to false when going into production!\n$generate-color-classes: true !default;\n_colors.scss:\nscss\n@if $generate-color-classes == true {\n// Generate colors...\n}\nIn addition to that, I think it would make sense to provide classes that apply the primary and secondary class:\n```scss\n// Primary and Secondary\n.primary {\n  background-color: $primary-color !important;\n&-text {\n    color: $primary-color !important;\n  }\n}\n.secondary {\n  background-color: $secondary-color!important;\n&-text {\n    color: $secondary-color !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n. ~~This is just a problem with the docs. https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/js/dropdown.js#L15\ndefault hover state is false~~. ~~This is just a problem with the docs. https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/js/dropdown.js#L15\ndefault hover state is false~~. @FoxInFlame Are you still testing? ;). @FoxInFlame Are you still testing? ;).

Please give feedback, if you think that is a good idea :) There are people like @kmmbvnr, @smileytechguy and many more that want to contribute but cant because @Dogfalo doesn't give a damn shit. @Acburst is the only active maintainer, but to handle such a big project alone is impossible. It is Dogfalos project so he has to take care of it or transfer it to another person! There are more than 1000 issues and 300 PRs open!

Ok, I admit the shorter thing is nonsense, but imagine what the consequences with this change are. We are currently at version 0.98.1 and a hell of a lot people are using this framework.

I understand your concerns regarding the duplicate code, but most people don't even read the docs properly and just copy paste the code examples.

I just meant, that the fix is working when you have a look at the master branch and to illustrate that, I used rawgit.com.

Still experiencing this problem in IE11 on Windows 8.1 with the new v0.96.0\n. Fixed in https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/78a48bb064d03073c0f9525e6fd8dbf522ce4fcd\n. Has this been implemented into master? Because I have just downloaded the latest materialize, and each new $('select').material_select(); keeps creating a new \"ul\" element with the new data. (Don't know if it affects your implementation the fact that I replace the html DOM select element with a new one with the same id and name).\n. This is probably no different than the issue I was discussing in https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/452 . As I said there I replace the select element with a new one in the following manner:\noldSelect.parentNode.replaceChild(newSelect, oldSelect);\n$('select').material_select();\nEach time the $('select').material_select() is triggered it adds a new dropdown, and both the old stylized input element and the new one are updated to the latest version (but any older than that stays the same). I end up with another nested select_wrapper div in the DOM, with the original select element at its core, more or less as follows:\n<div class='select_wrapper'>\n   <input type=\"text\" class=\"select-dropdown\" ...>\n   <i class=\"mdi-navigation-arrow-drop-down\" ...>\n   <div class='select_wrapper'>\n      <input type=\"text\" class=\"select-dropdown\" ...>\n      <i class=\"mdi-navigation-arrow-drop-down\" ...>\n      <div class='select_wrapper'>\n         <input type=\"text\" class=\"select-dropdown\" ...>\n         <i class=\"mdi-navigation-arrow-drop-down\" ...>\n         <select ...>\n. To create a new select element to replace the old instead of trying to edit the old one. There are a few reasons why having something like that reduces significantly the amount of js code I had to write.\n.

But issues are piling up, pull requests are taking weeks to be reviewed, or are incorrectly reviewed, or aren't reviewed at all! and there is barely any real support offered.\nHave you guys planned how to deal with this issue at all?

It might be relevant to mention that previous behaviour probably did reuse the overlay, as if you opened 2 different modals and then closed 1 one of them it would remove all the overlay completely and you would end up with the other modal still present in the page without the dark overlay.\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/1512\n.

Yeah, I think we need to be able to easy track the number of overlays opened and the cleanest way could probably be to add a data- attribute to a single overlay.\n\nThe current modal add overlay code can be see in the leanModal.js - L23-61 file. As you have shown, the code will add a new div with a unique identifier each time a modal is opened. I think instead it could add a single div with a unique identifier (so try to getElementById with the unique identifier and only add the new div to the DOM if not found), and then edit an html5 data- attribute with a counter of how many modals remain opened (so openModal adds to the counter, and closeModal subtracts from the counter), which will then only remove the overlay when the counter reaches 0.\nIn essence having something like:\n<div class=\"lean-overlay\" id=\"materialize-single-lean-overlay\" data-overlay-counter=\"3\"></div>\nThe main reason I suggest to add the counter as an attribute is because then other components (like the side menus, date pickers, or whatever) can just reuse the same component.\nOtherwise the variable _lastID could be replaced to an internal overlay counter.\n.

The repeating caret was fixed in https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/cbcf4c8f6c229f42dba1dd3ccde1788d7f96ff80 (or at least it did at the time).\nNow, I haven't had a chance to test this pull request, but could you provide an working example (a codepen would be great) of where the issue occurs with the latest code in master and it gets fixed with this pull request?\n. When submitting some code, please provide in a complete format, otherwise somebody else will have to write the rest of it to test it. Also, as indicated in the contributing, it would be even better if a codepen is submitted with an example illustrating the issue.\nIn the example you are providing, unless I'm not understanding you incorrectly, your issue arises because you are creating a string to create an HTML element (I assume to then append to the DOM as inner HTML). If that is the case, then it's not really the Materialize framework that fails to sanitize the input, but the fact that you'd be adding data directly into a string without ensuring it is sanitised. If I am mistaken, could you provide a working example?\n. Right, I see now that the code posted was forms.js#L345 as you've pointed out, which isn't properly sanitising the data to be embed it into the html.\n. What do you mean exactly with \"WP theme by dynamic\"? if that is a Materialize implementation for wordpress done by somebody else, then you would probably get better support from that developer.\n. That sounds like an issue with the wp integration, it is really hard to tell where the problem resides without any working example. You'll probably get better support asking a general question in stack overflow.\n. If you'd like to submit a pull request for the website documentation, I think you are supposed to edit the files in the jade folder, as the HTML pages would be automatically generated from those.\nApart from that, the floating action button on the documentation page does not have the waves effect added in both the page itself and the documented HTML. I assumed this was deliberate, but I do not know, either way both the documentation and actual page code should correlate and this pull request only edits one of the two.\n. I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Are you requesting markdown to html conversion functionality? That does not really fall within the goals of this framework, I'm sure there are really good libraries available to achieve this.\n. Sounds like a good fix, could you provide a pull request?\n. I think the materialize team has decided to leave some of the dead links for now: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/1671 https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/1211\nAlthough this specific example could have been fixed if the linked pointed to http://demo.geekslabs.com/materialize/index.html instead, as I tried to submit for https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/1671\n. That's a good question, I guess for now you could do something like: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eNPVNe\nFor now I think the only way to change colour defaults is using sass: http://materializecss.com/sass.html\nFor the form themselves, there is more info in the section \"Changing colors\" in http://materializecss.com/forms.html\n. You are only editing the page code to add the waves, and the example code does not have the effect added. As I mentioned in the other pull request, I don't know if leaving the wave effect out of the floating action button was a deliberate decision, but if you edit the page code, then the example code should be edited too.\n. I assume you are running Android 4.3 or older? I'm afraid that support for android below 4.4 is rather limited at the moment.\n. It's just a normal checkbox: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eNQMOL\n. I'm sorry, but Materialize doesn't support IE9. I'll leave this open for a couple of days in case somebody else can offer some help.\n. The mdi type icons are being phased out for the official google sources, that's why you won't find the old chart in the documentation. A complete list of the new icons can be found in https://www.google.com/design/icons/ .\n. Because that would suddenly break all the user implementations, so this way it can be phased out gradually, giving people time to update their icons.\nIf you really need to check the old implementation, you can go through the commit history from https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/icons.html and look at a version before the google icons were added.\n. There was an issue publishing 0.97.0, next release should be there. See https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/1583.\n. As stated in the issue you have linked, this has already been fixed, just not yet released. If can't wait until the next version is released, you could use the files from https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/tree/master/bin.\n.

The documentation hasn't been updated yet on the website (it is on master), but the file input should be implemented as:\nHTML\n  <form action=\"#\">\n    <div class=\"file-field input-field\">\n      <div class=\"btn\">\n        <span>File</span>\n        <input type=\"file\">\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"file-path-wrapper\">\n        <input class=\"file-path validate\" type=\"text\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n.

Either way, updating this would be a breaking change, which is worse than maintaining an inconsistency, so the documentation should be updated to replace constrainWidth with a better description of the option.\n.

I have switched everything to the jquery passthrough in the AngularUI Utils and have mine working like this:\njavascript\n<a  class='dropdown-button btn--icon right-align' href='#' data-activates='dropdown1'\n       ui-jq=\"dropdown\" ui-options=\"dropDownConfig()\"><i class=\"mdi-navigation-arrow-drop-down\"></i>\n </a>\nWith this function in the controller to provide the config to the passthrough:\njavascript\nnavDropDownConfig = function() {\n      return {\n        'inDuration': 300,\n        'outDuration': 225,\n        'constrain_width': false, // Does not change width of dropdown to that of the activator\n        'hover': false, // Activate on click\n        'alignment': 'left', // Aligns dropdown to left or right edge (works with constrain_width)\n        'gutter': 0, // Spacing from edge\n        'belowOrigin': false // Displays dropdown below the button\n      };\n    };\nAgain, I'm not seeing much difference between mine and yours in theory, but that's working for me in an included file.\n.

You need to manage that yourself.  How are you specifying the message?\n. AFAIK, the default HTML5 messages should still appear when you submit the form, but there isn't anything to make messages like what the google spec says to show occur.\n. I have some code at home doing that exact thing - will try to dig it out.\nIn the meantime, going from memory, I am using the angular ui jquery passthrough to integrate, and I seem to recall putting the dropdown config retrieval in a method on the controller at that scope and then calling it from ui-options in the passthrough.\nAs a general rule, the angular integration is trying sometimes and needs some special attention.\n.

If so, you can easily extend the classes. Like so:\ncss\n.btn-success {\n@extend .blue, .white-text\n}\nThen you could use it in your html like so:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"btn btn-success\">#</a>\nThis would then create a blue button with white text, similar to the one that Bootstrap offers.\n. @lexetam I think right now, you cannot. At least the documentation on Materialize's form helpers does not mention such a possibility (cf. http://materializecss.com/forms.html).\nBut you could try to mimmick this behaviour with a noUISlider. Materialize does support that one (cf. http://refreshless.com/nouislider/slider-options/)\n. @MetaiR Thank you, but that's not the problem here. responsive-img just offers a max-width: 100%;. No width is given. width is, despite this case, a fallback for browsers which do not understand max-width. And as it seems Chrome 48 is one of them, or at least Google decided to change this behavior, because I know it was different in the past.\nI explained that by using width: 100%; everything works as it should. So Materialize should add this style, to make sure it works.\nAs for your solution: The grid styling is only to apply on the grid, not on every single html element. :)\n. ",

    "Digital-Thor": "Thanks for the quick response! I tried Materialize.updateTextFields() in various route hooks as well as in a script at the bottom of the template, but there was no improvement.  \nOne further clue may be due to something special with the password field type. The autocompleted email field doesn't have any overlap, but the password text and label do.  A few things I attempted:\n1. I changed the input type from password to text and that definitely stopped the behavior, but left the placeholder behind.\n2. I noticed that when I clicked anywhere on the page, the password label would scoot out of the way.  So I tried $(\"body\").click() and $(\"body\").focus(), but no luck.\n3. I also used jQuery to focus on a different input, but that wouldn't animate the password label out of the way either.\nHere's the markup:\n``` html\n\nLogin\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n```\n. @fabyeah: This worked for me:\nTemplate.myTemplateName.onRendered (function(){\n  Materialize.updateTextFields();\n});\nYou also need to be careful about targeting the appropriate nesting level for the template.\nUpdate: Ooops - Just tested it again, and password label is interfering with anonimization bullets from previous password.  Label scoots out of the way once password field gets focus.\n. None of the above worked for my code.  However, delaying initialization in the rendered function solved the problem:\nsetTimeout(function(){\n    $('.tooltipped').tooltip({ delay: 50 });\n  }, 500 );\nA more robust solution is probably to incorporate a session reactive var.  I haven't tried it, but you could look at this link for such an approach.\n. None of the above worked for my code.

Everything else about Materialize is so gorgeous, I desperately want it to work.\nEDIT: Took me 30 minutes, but I found a solution:\n`<input id=\"password\" type=\"password\" name=\"password\" value=\" \">`\nAdding a space to the value. Seriously. Which of course means I have to do $('#password').focus(function(){ $(this).select() }); so users without autofill submit valid passwords. But now the label doesn't crash the autofill party. Sigh.\n. This is so very necessary! The current autocomplete feature is incomplete. Unlike a select (which can accommodate both a database id and visible value ... as in <option value=\"51234\">Blahblah</option> ... the current autocomplete only yields \"Blahblah\", making it relatively useless for async database queries.\nThe other options I've seen, including https://icefox0801.github.io/materialize-autocomplete/ , don't quite do it either.\n. I came up with something that works pretty great. It requires jquery.auto-complete.min.js and jquery.auto-complete.css from https://github.com/Pixabay/jQuery-autoComplete ... which is beautifully coded, and only requires 3.4k.\nLet's say you want an autocompleted city search input that shows the city name but returns the city_id ...\nHTML:\n<div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"input-field\">\n            <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"city_id\" name=\"city_id\" value=\"\">\n            <input id=\"city_autocomplete\" name=\"city_autocomplete\" type=\"text\">\n            <label for=\"city_autocomplete\">In which city do you live?</label>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n(Note the hidden input. The code below modifies this value.)\nJS:\n$('#city_autocomplete').autoComplete({\n        source: function(term, response){\n            $.getJSON('/path/to/search.php', { q: term }, function(data){ response(data); });\n        },\n        renderItem: function (item, search){\n            // escape special characters\n            search = search.replace(/[-\\/\\\\^$*+?.()|[\\]{}]/g, '\\\\$&');\n            var re = new RegExp(\"(\" + search.split(' ').join('|') + \")\", \"gi\");\n            return '<div class=\"autocomplete-suggestion\" data-id=\"'+ item[0] +'\" data-val=\"' + item[1] + '\">' + item[1].replace(re, \"<b>$1</b>\") + '</div>';\n        },\n        onSelect: function(e, term, item){\n            $('#city_id').val( item.data('id') );\n        }\n    });\n(The renderItem is nearly identical to the default, just modified the return. If, like me, you will only ever do this kind of autocomplete, you can just replace that line in the source code, and omit the renderItem from the call above. With a bit more work, this could be modified to not require #id selectors in either JS or HTML.)\nPHP:\n```\n    require '/path/to/requires.php';\n$res = [];\n$sql = $db->query(\"SELECT `id`,`name` FROM `cities` WHERE `name` LIKE '%\". safeGET($_GET['q']) .\"%' LIMIT 10\");\nwhile ($r = $sql->fetch()) {\n    $res[] = [$r['id'],$r['name']];\n}\necho json_encode($res);\n\n```\n(Basically the PHP just outputs a JSON array like [[255,'New York'], [1261,'New Orleans'], [8212,'Newark'], ...]. Be sure to replace safeGET() with your own injection proofing methods.)\n. For those of us waiting for this fix to get published, can someone suggest a workaround?\n. ",

Does this mean the sticky footer solution you have doesn't work in Safari? I am on version 7.1.5. \n. I wanted to confirm that this is an issue everyone else using materializecss is facing - i.e. the sticky footer solution doesn't work in safari. I think you should mention it somewhere on your sticky footer page.\n. I did - but again, it's not mentioned anywhere in their documentation the sticky footer solution does not work on safari and you have to resort to hacks to make it work. I posted here to check if its working for everyone without any hacks .  Surprised it hasn't come up.\n. Here is what is said on the website: \n\"Note: This may cause issues in Internet Explorer which has weak support for flex box.\"\nNo mention of safari.\n. Thanks guys - the webkit prefix works for me. You should add to the documentation.\n. This is what is working for me ( stylus code - just rewrite into regular css )\n```\nbody \ndisplay -webkit-box\ndisplay -webkit-flex\ndisplay -ms-flexbox\ndisplay flex\nmin-height 100vh\n-webkit-box-orient vertical\n-webkit-box-direction normal\n-webkit-flex-direction column\n    -ms-flex-direction column\n        flex-direction column\nmain \n-webkit-box-flex 1\n-webkit-flex 1 0 auto\n    -ms-flex 1 0 auto\n        flex 1 0 auto \n```\n. the one related to pagepiling?  It still occurs without it. i can remove the page piling plugin and you can check it out again. It also happened on another build i had with materializecss\nupdate - removed the other plugin. There are no console errors now ... please checkout again\n. I haven't set any opacity rules at all in my css for the slider\nps: putting the other plugin code back now. Just wanted to show it still happens without it.\n. I just found this has been resolved through an update. so closing it now. however, the solution is not 100% perfect. it doesn't wrap cleanly\n. ",

Hi there,\nThe best solution would be to use an IDE to merge the JavaScript files.\nFor the CSS files, I advise you to place your modified CSS in late materialize CSS file (0.93.7), but if you've really put everywhere, once again you should use the IDE to merge all the differences between each file.\nIn this case, there is no simple way to update your version to the newest.\nFor the future, set your changes in a separate file.\n. Hi, I included this in my PR. You can choose the direction of the opening dropdown.\n. Undefined is showing because no options exist. If you want to avoid this, add one disabled option.\n. This is a normal behavior. If you want to select multiple options you can use the multiple select.\n. I don't think display nothing on the dropdown is a good idea.\n. It is.\n. This is already fixed, just update to the latest generated CSS version.\n. https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/bin/materialize.css\n. Don't change the materialize.js file, only the dependencies in the js folder. When they will merge your PR and compile the new files, it will change automatically the materialize.js file.\nIf you change the materialize.js file, it will be erased with the next compilation.\n. @acburst There is a lack of documentation for a sticky footer, you should add a working example.\n@Lis1us I think you have to add :\n\nflex: 1 0 auto;\n\nTo your footer, there is a behavior but idk if it's the one wanted.\n. Yeah it's the behavior I was talking to, but I don't really think this is a sticky footer.\nFor now, while waiting for a response you can Google search how to make a sticky footer in CSS.\n. Hi, I closed my PR because no response.\n. Please take a look at #2670.\n. For now it's pretty difficult to develop this functionality because index's option are resetted to 0 after each optgroup and we based the generated list item of the ul on these indexes, so with optgroup there is no more correspondence between the elements.\nSo for now you shouldn't use optgroups in your selects.\nStill, I'm working on a fix but idk if it could be accepted and the fix will take some time.\n[Edit December 25] : It's now fixed in my PR. Single or multiple select support optgroups.\n. Hi, you could simply overload the material_select component with mine like by declaring a script before the end of your  with this content : http://pastebin.com/vsaaB9GD\nDon't forget to wrap it into a $(function () { pastebin_content }) and it should do the trick !\n. Hi, I'm doing a pastebin for you. Remember this is not the latest version of this functionality.\nFocus with tab key isn't working for yet and keep the dropdown visible when it's multiple too.\nThere is the JS pastebin : http://pastebin.com/rfJggs07\nThere is the CSS pastebin : http://pastebin.com/9Gbiyqct\nIf you encounter any error or malfunction please report it.\n. At this point you should implement your own system or get another alternative.\n. Hi, I fixed your issue. I'll synchronize the PR when I will have fixed another issue.\n. Hi, I add the required attribute on the input when it's automatically generated. I'll synchronize the PR when I will have fixed another issue.\nThe fix is working on Firefox, but on Google Chrome, Opera there is the same issue you encountered.\nOn Safari and IE (< 10) there is simply no support.\n. This issue should be fixed if they accept the PR : https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/2514\n. For now you can get the form.js code on my fork.\n. You're welcome. If you encounter an error or any issue please report it.\nDon't forget to update your version with the next stable version.\n. @nicolasFauren Thanks for replied\n@acburst Do you want to merge the PR ?\n. Hi, I'm currently working on an other version. If you want to test it before a probable PR please refer to https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2522#issuecomment-170671609\n. I added the CSS in my last post, you can add after materialize.css for taking account all changes.\n. It works in all cases with me.\n. Use the jQuery version proposed with the framework.\nThe framework can't be responsible of all client modifications.\n. @Thanood Thanks, but you can load an overload file if you really want to use it.\nI encourage anyone to see this message repository to drop it because it is not maintained properly and errors stack every day without anything being done, at least not fast enough.\nThey could organize their pull request or just give an answer but they are choosing to remain silent, to me it's disrespectful.\n. @badaro42 Sorry, I'm just seeing your comment right now, I provide a fix on my fork. But I don't know that will be useful now.\n. Yes it should works but if you encounter an issue don't hesitate to report it, I'll fix.\n. It is a closed PR. I won't ever work for this repo.. A description could be a good idea.\n. The select component follows the native select element. W've added some others functionalities like icons and multiple selection by clicking on a optgroup for multiple select but we have to follow the native element.\nSo actually we can't add a div in a option element, so why could we.\n. Do a pull request and maybe they will merge.\n. Hi, you should provide a JSfiddle instead of giving us all the code you have. W'll better understand your issue btw.\n. It's to you to specify your elements. You should try @acupajoe solution.\n. Did you init the select ? With :\n$('select').material_select();\n. Hi, I'm afraid that this particular case isn't implemented.\n. What is your code ?\n. Hi, this isn't implemented in the latest version, but if you need a workaround you can do like this : https://jsfiddle.net/fv0ff4L8/\n. @acburst Should be close because duplicate of https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/3448\n. I don't have any issue on my side (Chrome, FF, Opera). What is the browser you're using ?\n. Thank for the video. It's not a problem, this behavior (automatically scroll to the element) is wanted.\n. If you want to avoid this behavior, you have to delete the line 3280 in materialize.js :\noptions.scrollTo(option);\n. I just enumerate the fact without having a point of view on the question. May be they had some reasons we don't know to do that, but I can't see which ones.\n. You're right, it's : font-size: 14px; or font-weight: bold; for example.\n. It's a duplicate issue. There is the same on IE.\n. What are you trying to search ?\n. You're on Mac ? On Windows there is no problem.\n. You're on Mac ? On Windows there is no problem.\n. ",

$('select').material_select();\n)\nit adds a ul and li elemnts to your select item which li of ul values is exactly value of your options element.\nhere the codes\nhttp://codepen.io/MetaExploit/pen/vLYaRa\ni think the mater is because u have no option element that it turn them to li and show there\nactually its use the value of option which has \"disabled selected\" attribute for placeholder value and when u have no option the javascript or jquery (i dont know in this case which one do this) return undifined.\ni hope i can convey my idea well (but i dont think so... for better understand see what hapend by see codes in inspect element by ur self)\nsorry for my bad english language its because its not my real language.\nby the way congratulation

Confirmed. Perhaps the names of the placeholders need a rename as it's unclear what each one does.. @tomscholz Silly me :P I was in a hurry so I excuse myself. Fixing on both pages and making a new PR.. @tomscholz Oh :)\n@uok \nSure, it can be overwhelming and it could be a hassle to assign labels to everything. If the labels already exist all we need to do is to encourage issue commiters to put labels on their issues so they're more organized. So, even if there will be a large amount of issues in the future, it'll be easier to go through them.\n@tomscholz I don't think that we should add labels to existing issues/PRs as in my opinion it'll be a waste of time. And yeah, clearing all those issues will be a group effort. But hey, around 5 days ago we had ~1000 open issues and we've already reduced that to a 900 thanks to the amazing collaborators/managers :) So we'll make it eventually.. @uok @DanielRuf Just found that out and was about to write it :) Well why is it like this? If everyone could assign labels (only assigning, not adding new labels) to themselves it could be great for the project.. @meiao @DanielRuf Don't worry, #4437 does fix it. I tested it myself (simply inspecting element and doing it myself \ud83d\ude04 ). @DanielRuf But it is a problem because only the main label should be transformed, and the error/success label shouldn't be affected by this (it should be in it's \"transformed\" style by default). Perhaps we could just make a separate label for the error/success message, or we could keep it the way it is and move the main label to the :before and apply the transformation on it.. This issue doesn't appear in Firefox:\n. This issue doesn't appear in Firefox:\n. @philipraets It seems really neat. Here's an idea: how about a js option to set pickers vertical/horizontal programmatically (where it defaults according to the screen orientation)? :). @Dogfalo Oops, updated. @DanielRuf Huh. I see. Perhaps we should rename it / redo the tutorial on the valign helper as it is unclear what it's purpose is (and it's still unclear to me what it's supposed to do... Set the direction of the elements or center an element vertically). In materializecss.com/helpers, it's specified like so:\n\nYou can easily vertically center things by adding the class valign-wrapper to the container holding the items you want to vertically align.\n\nAnd the purpose of .valign isn't clear to me aswell.. @X3MWorks As we don't know the steps to reproduce your problem, provide a codepen or the issue will be closed in a few days.. @X3MWorks As we don't know the steps to reproduce your problem, provide a codepen or the issue will be closed in a few days.. @Heysoulnat88 Explaning your problem further wouldn't help. What we need is a live example, and that's what codepen is for - you can code in the web browser and it changes automatically and then you can share it with others. Enter http://codepen.io/Dogfalo/pen/xbzPQV, click Fork in the top navbar and insert your code there. Then send the link to the codepen here.. @peterfleck Agreed, but .*medium* classes should be deprecated (there should be a warning for that).\nEDIT: Oops, meant -med-, not -medium.. The comments are over-complicating things. What needs to be done here is this:\n\nEdit sass files (only sass files!) and where there's a class that matches *med-*`` change themedtomedium`.\nAdd a warning in the materializecss.com website (edit jade files) that while *med-* classes are available, it's best to use *medium-* as it's the new syntax and it improves consistensy.\nChange all occurrences of *med-* classes in materializecss.com website to be *medium-*.\nIt's not so complicated. Redo the PR with only these steps and remove the editing of the compiled css files?\n\nAll this PR needs is to bring back the *med-* classes together with the *medium-* classes to avoid breaking older versions, and a warning in the materializecss.com website about *med-* being deprecated. That's it.\nBut if you do want to complicate, here's something that could be cool: Perhaps add js code to log to the console about the usage of *med-* classes if they're used? . @DanielRuf I see, looks great!. It's exclusive to you - as it appears, it works fine for me on chrome. . Please close the issue? Try @DanielRuf 's solution - perhaps you have an extension blocking it, or the connection timed out before the image could load.. @Dogfalo I removed it :)\n@tomscholz It says not to edit compiled files... What exactly do you mean?\n\nI think you should add that nobody should commit compiled files aswell.. This doesn't support Opera and IE<9. In both browsers, it requires an attribute on the html element, unselectable=\"on\":\n$(this).attr(\"unselectable\", \"on\"); //IE<9, Opera\nPerhaps you'd also want to explain in the PR body that it specifically fixes FABs, could make the PR more clear.. @DanielRuf Oh. Well still, supporting IE9 won't hurt :P. @DanielRuf Oh. Well still, supporting IE9 won't hurt :P. @tomscholz Oh. Apologies.\n. @DanielRuf We'd have to decide on a consistent naming style (i like foo-bar the best), and then look through all the names and when we see a name that doesn't match we create a duplicate with the correct naming conventions. Then for each one that we did this for we look through the docs and update that there's a new syntax and that the old one is deprecated. Another thing that can really help would be making a JS function on load that detects if there's an element with a deprecated class name in the html and if so it should log it to the console with a warning that the syntax is deprecated.. @DanielRuf We'd have to decide on a consistent naming style (i like foo-bar the best), and then look through all the names and when we see a name that doesn't match we create a duplicate with the correct naming conventions.

If so: by the user and if not: by user/code) where item is the new item selected.. Why the content: \"\u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f\"?. @tomscholz Also in Arabic, and yeah I know, I was meaning to ask why should the arabic text be included in the official materialize library?\n@arminmon It should be removed anyways so it isn't in the official library.\nP.S: Tom, it's everything rtl (by looking at the code).. @tomscholz @arminmon We could just use javascript for that :). @arminmon You're probably right, but it's just one automatic call when the page loads and another method triggered manually by developer, so it wouldn't take so much memory.. \n",

I have been playing around with your idea of the tabs in the navbar and this is what I have so far, I am still going through it and perfecting it as I go. But here it is, like I said I am still working on it to perfect it. http://codepen.io/tmd-uk/full/megEqR/\n. I just need to either remove the logo or tab nav on Mobile, the tab nav seems to overlap the logo. So I have a few options to try and see what it looks like. If you guys like it when I have finished it and perfected it by all means fork it and use it for your projects.\n. What I mean is look at the mobile version of getmdl.io's nav. It scrolls when interacted with, a few users have been asking and have been confused why there is no docs or evidence of scrollable tabs. Which is why I reference getmdl.io. \n. Because Material Design by Google does not include this in their design specs and it utilises the toast notification bar and cards as a way to well notify the user of their actions. Can I ask what you need the alert messages for?\n. Have you checked out http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/ for notifications, as the name says sweet alerts. I use it and it's really great, I have even had feedback from clients saying that their users love the alerts. Maybe give it a try and see if it works for you.\n. It's an absolute pleasure. That's what we are all here for. Hope it works out for what you need it for?\n. Have you tried adding the center to either the col s12 or the row and see if that works?\n. Can you get put the code in a Codepen and I'll have a look it for you.\n. ",

Just like the codepen shows.\nMaybe could add a comment about that in the docs?\n. I will let a contributor close this issue or give it a feature tag.\n. ",

    "AlexandreDecan": "Consider updating the documentation, as the only example with a textarea does not include a \"for\" attribute for its label. Thank you!\n. I partially agree, but I think that \"too much code\" is linked to another issue. Let me explain ;-) \nI think there's some work to do about how the color schemes are managed in MaterializeCSS. For example, I do not understand why all the color schemes must be provided in the CSS. If I follow Material Design's specification, I should choose 2, 3 or maybe 4 distinct colors/variations among the ones that are provided. The other colors are not useful. \nIt should be possible to define some \"core\" colors, like \"primary\", \"primary-text\", \"success\", \"success-text\", etc. based on \"intentions\", and only have those colors in our resulting CSS (using Sass, for e.g.). This way, one could change the whole \"theme\" of its website by editing only a small part of its code. And this way, only some of color schemes need to be included in the outputted css (and you could, for e.g., use \"primary-border\" to define the \"default\" color of a blockquote, \"success\" to define the color of a validated input form, etc. without having to hard code \"red\" and \"green\" like it is at the moment). \nAt least, I strongly believe that it could be interesting to have seperate materialize.(min.)css and full-color-schemes.(min.)css and give the people the possibility to easily generate their own-color-schemes.(min.)css if they are not satisfied with the colors you chose (for blockquote, sidebar, input field, etc.) by simply manipulating some variables (e.g.: by specifying that the \"primary\" color scheme is populated by, say, blue darken-2, that \"success\" color scheme is populated by \"green lighten-1\", etc.). \nSo, to illustrate:\n- Define all the color schemes in a separate file (quite similar as it is right now) ;\n- Move the function that generate the CSS in another place ;\n- Add some \"intention\" schemes: primary, secondary, success, warning, error, muted, ... \n- Define some \"default\" value for those schemes: primary-text is blue-text darken-2, primary is blue lighten-2, success-text is green, etc. Write in the documentation how the user can easily change this.\n- When the sass-compiler runs, use the intention schemes to populate the currently-hardcoded colors of Materialize\n- in the output include classes like primary, success, warning, primary-text, success-text, warning-text, etc. (in fact, those classes are just an alias for the ones we currently have, like red, green, blue, etc.). \n- Output another css file, say \"color-schemes.css\" with all the classes we currently have (like red, red-text, .red.lighten-1, etc.).\nWe then have:\n- Materialize.css which contains all the funny stuff you already wrote + a user-defined intention-based color scheme (or a default one).\n- color-schemes.css which can be optionaly included by the developers in their websites if they need other colors than the ones that are defined using intentions in materialize.css\nI'm not even sure I'm understandable^^\n. I hope the \"border effect\" will be the same as in the \"tabs\" component :-)\n. ",

    "DavidCRivera": "Is that enhancement with the aligment option for dropdowns still valid? It looks like it's automatically changing alignment based on some factor, but in my implementation, it's cutting the dropdown off. I'd like manual control of the alignment, and while that commit seems to have added it to v95.x, the latest version doesn't seem to have an 'alignment' option anymore. Was this removed? Am I missing something?\n. I think this is related. I expanded my menu with:\n$(\".button-collapse\").sideNav({menuWidth: 300});\nBut the problem I had was that on mobile when swiping the menu closed, it wouldn't close all the way, still sticking out some.

I'm using dropdown within a collection and facing the same problem. \ncss\n.collection {\n  overflow: visible;\n}\nsolved it in my case, but I don't know if this messes with something else.\n. @osxi thanks for the suggestion.\n. I just tried a fresh checkout of the master and the problem still seems to be there. No change of the extra caret behaviour.\nI'm using meteor, if that matters.\n. Having the same problem.\n. Well, that's a workaround, not a solution.\n. No problem, I'm not native either :)\nI don't think adding this CSS snippet solves the actual problem because I'm sure they have made it overflow: hidden for a reason in the first place.\nSo it is best if we knew why it is like that and what else can be done to provide a general solution.\n. I've added this to my css overrides to fix the problem:\ncss\n.collection {\n  overflow: visible;\n}\n. Yep, upgrading to 0.97.1 on Meteor breaks the whole app!\n. @Dogfalo the problem is the minimized javascript. If you point package.js to the (unminified) javascript in the dist folder, the app works. But if you point it to either one of the minified ones, it wreaks havoc!\n. @Dogfalo I've created a quick fix PR, but you need to also either tag that as a new release or publish manually.\n. @mrvol you could edit your .meteor/packages file and change materialize:materialize to materialize:materialize@=0.97.0 for the time being. Then a meteor update will ensure your version stays at 0.97.0 until the latest one gets fixed.\n. Guys, until @Dogfalo gets back to us, we could temporarily fork the repo and publish it on atmosphere.\nOf course that's a double edged sword. It will be abandoned, will definitely create some confusion over why official package is so broken and the presence of unbroken unofficial packages etc.\nSo what do you guys think?\n.

I've made a pr a while back: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/2732\nMaybe the code can help you.\nit's responsive and the timepicker is draggable.\n. I have no idea why it hasn't been merged yet.\nIf anyone wants to try, test, bugfix or update it to the latest code of materializecss and merge it, please do. I don't have time to maintain it, and my project hasn't been updated with the latest code from materializecss after I've made this, but the date-and timepicker are used on a daily basis at the company I work for.\n. I've created a codepen so you can see it in action: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/woqevN. I've created a new clean PR #4445 which is compatible with the latest code.. I've went with another approach with jquery validate, instead of injecting the error message in the data-error attribute, I create another label element after the label. Then place it with css\nexample:\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/aOQejJ\nthis is working with input-fields and textarea's, haven't tried it with checkboxes and switches, but it should be the same idea, just a bit tweaking of the css\n. The height of the modal window is not the issue, it is the height of the textarea in the modal which is calculated wrong, because the hidden div to calculate seems to be only 100px wide.\nIf you want to have modals with fixed footer and dynamic height you could try to add this to the css (this is for now the only solution I have found but it is with fixed max-height - 380px seems to be a reasonable max-height for all devices):\n.modal {\n    overflow-y: scroll;\n}\n.modal .modal-content {\n    display: block;\n    max-height: 380px !important;\n    overflow: scroll;\n    text-overflow: ellipsis;\n}\n.modal .modal-footer {\n    border-top: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n. I've noticed it with 0.95.2 (I don't know if it happened before). I've created a jsfiddle with the problem:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/3e5fgfzo/\n. I've added these 2 lines to my css file:\n.fixed-action-btn ul {display:none;}\n.fixed-action-btn:hover ul {display:block;}\nthis way it still pops up when you hover over the big button, but not when you hover over the red area.\n.

If you replace the a tag with button type=\"button\" then the page doesn't jump back to the top.

I just went to http://materializecss.com and tried the different selects on ipad. The \"normal\" ones I can close by tapping on a disabled option, but the multiple select stays open.\nAlso if you just tap outside the selects, the selects stay open.\nThis is on an ipad retina with ios 9.1\nOn android, they close if you tap outside the selects.\n. I've created a codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/woqevN\n. If you change the option \"twelvehour\" to true, there will be AM/PM (I live in Belgium, we don't use AM/PM, but it's there :-) )\nto change the color, I use classes like .green-picker\ncss example:\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker__date-display,\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker__day--selected,\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker__day--selected:hover,\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker--focused .picker__day--selected {\n  background: #4caf50 none repeat scroll 0 0;\n}. I think those files were because of compiling, but I'm going to clean up my repository, create a new branch, recreate the date- and timepicker and try a new pull request (hopefully with only the correct changes :-) ). the new PR is #4445 and this is based on the latest materialize code. jQuery load is asynchronously which means it will fetch \"status.php\" and doesn't wait until this is finished for executing the rest of the code. \nIt does has a callback function, that gets executed after load gets the \"status.php\" page. So if you put your checks for color in the callback it should work.\nI would change your code to this:\n$(document).ready(function() { \n    setInterval(function() { \n        $(\"#status\").html(\"\").load('status.php', function(){\n            var logo = $(\"#front-page-logo\").attr(\"src\"); \n            if (logo.indexOf(\"orange\") > -1) { \n                Materialize.toast('orange desin', 4000); \n            } else if(logo.indexOf(\"red\") > -1) { \n                Materialize.toast('red desin', 4000); \n            }\n        });\n    }, 10000);\n});\n. You will need to re-initialize the modals in the callback function of \"load\" like this:\n$(\"#activeuserlist\").html(\"\").load('activeuserlist.php', function(){ $('.modal-trigger').leanModal();})\n. You only need the DOM Ready if you load js before the end of the page (for example in ).\nAnd you don't need the outer div with id activeuserlist in activeuserlist.php because the load-function will replace the content in the original div. Otherwise you will get a div with id activeuserlist inside a div with id activeuserlist. You also don't need to clear html (the .html('') ) before doing load.\nfor more documentation on jquery load, see: http://api.jquery.com/load/\nThere are 2 options to get it working:\nOption 1 with the callback in load:\n$(document).ready(function(){\n    setInterval(function(){\n        $(\"#activeuserlist\").load('activeuserlist.php', function(){\n            $(a.modal-trigger).leanModal();\n        })\n    },60000);\n});\nOption 2 is to bind a click event in DOM Ready on the modal-trigger like this:\n$(document).ready(function(){\n    $(\"#activeuserlist\").on(\"click\", \"a.modal-trigger\", function(){\n        $(this).openModal();\n    });\n    setInterval(function(){\n        $(\"#activeuserlist\").load('activeuserlist.php')\n    },60000);\n});\nThese are just examples, they aren't tested but should be in the right direction.\n. Yes there is, by using data-constrainwidth=\"false\" on the dropdown-button.\n. Here are some suggestions:\n963\nI use this one:\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/rxMXob\n. @DanielRuf there will be some small css bugfixing to do like the circles and the spacing between the date and time text, I'll see if I can fix some tomorrow (these screenshots are from the previous PR, but the code is working). If this gets accepted, then maybe there are some people with better css-skills than me who can look at the code and fix some things or improve it.. New screenshots (with css fix):\n\n\n\n\n. Here's a working codepen: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/evQxPy\n. these are the options for the timepicker (we use 24-hour format by default in Belgium):\n```\n$('.timepicker').pickatime({\n    default: 'now', // Set default time\n    fromnow: 0,       // set default time to * milliseconds from now (using with default = 'now')\n    twelvehour: false, // Use AM/PM or 24-hour format\n    donetext: 'OK', // text for done-button\n    cleartext: 'Clear', // text for clear-button\n    canceltext: 'Cancel', // Text for cancel-button\n    autoclose: false, // automatic close timepicker\n    ampmclickable: true, // make AM PM clickable\n    aftershow: function(){} //Function for after opening timepicker\n});\n```\nThe datepicker options are the same as before\nThere is a small waves-effect on the buttons, I've tried on the other clickable stuff, but waves-effect messes with the display property, so I have to find a workaround for it\nto change the selects to materialize also gave me problems (I removed \"browser-default\" from them, but then there is a lot of work to get it right). You can change the colors using the variables or like I did in my app (because we a different color scheme for different modules) add some css rules like these to an extra css-file:\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker__date-display,\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker__day--selected,\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker__day--selected:hover,\n.picker__holder.green-picker .picker--focused .picker__day--selected {\nbackground: #4caf50 none repeat scroll 0 0;\n}\nand in js:\n$('.datepicker').pickadate({\n            format: 'dd/mm/yyyy',\n            formatSubmit: 'dd/mm/yyyy',\n            hiddenName: true,\n            disable: [6, 7],\n            klass: {\n                // The picker holder\n                holder: 'picker__holder green-picker'\n            }\n        });\n        $('.timepicker').pickatime({\n            default: 'now',\n            twelvehour: false,\n            donetext: 'OK',\n            cleartext: 'Clear',\n            canceltext: 'Cancel',\n            afterShow: function(){\n                $('.picker__holder').addClass('green-picker');\n                $(\".timepicker\").removeClass('picker__input picker__input--active');\n            }\n        });. Screenshot timepicker 24-hour format:\n\n\n. @rogeriocorrea: I've just commited a fix for this. It should have the correct AM PM value now.. @rogeriocorrea: I've just commited a fix for this. It should have the correct AM PM value now.. @kapalkat\nyou create an input field like this:\n<input type=\"date\" class=\"timepicker\">\nand then initialize the timepicker with the following code:\n```\n$('.timepicker').pickatime({\n    default: 'now', // Set default time\n    fromnow: 0,       // set default time to * milliseconds from now (using with default = 'now')\n    twelvehour: false, // Use AM/PM or 24-hour format\n    donetext: 'OK', // text for done-button\n    cleartext: 'Clear', // text for clear-button\n    canceltext: 'Cancel', // Text for cancel-button\n    autoclose: false, // automatic close timepicker\n    ampmclickable: true, // make AM PM clickable\n    aftershow: function(){} //Function for after opening timepicker\n  });\n```. @kapalkat\nI didn't think about it, but it's because I don't push those files to github, so the timepicker isn't in those files.\nYou can compile them with grunt, or you can use these:\nmaterialize.css\nmaterialize.js\nThese are the compiled files for this branch.

Hi guys,\nI'm only getting around to checking your suggestions now (I was quite comfortable with the workaround I did for myself back in December) and I see how leaving the duration blank makes a toast that stays on.\nMy problem is this: I need to specify a custom CSS class, which is the third parameter when calling the toast function - so how do I leave the duration blank? I tried the following ways and got a toast that displayed and immediately get removed:\nMaterialize.toast('I am a toast!', 0, 'custom_css_class');\nMaterialize.toast('I am a toast!', '', 'custom_css_class');\nMaterialize.toast('I am a toast!', null, 'custom_css_class');\n. With some trial and error, I found I could provide any string as duration and that would result in a non-expiring toast - Materialize.toast('I am a toast!', \"stay on\", 'custom_css_class');\nBUT...... if you call the toast function without duration, it would still set the interval and run every 20ms. While it may not count as a catastrophe, it makes absolutely no sense overloading the browser with unnecessary work.\nI still believe that wrapping the setInterval with if (parseInt(displayLength)) is the better solution.\n. Anyone knows when this would get merged? I'm still having this issue in version 0.97.6 (@zhaoyao91 - your fix worked perfect for me)\n. I think I realized what happen. I converted the css file to RTL (using rtlcss) and that changed the values from your original (it actually has left: auto on it).\nI should not be coding at 4:30am...\n. ",

I know that pickatime.js is made by the same people that did the date picker so that could also be an option. Yeah, I think in materialize admin they added a skin for pickatime\u00a0. I did some tests, its a great first start. Here's my feedback:\n\nYou can't drag the time pieces\nThere are no animations or smooth transitions\nBottom buttons should be centred\n\nJust my 2c. Hope that helps!. @smileytechguy To get dragging working, you'd need to setup:\n\nWhen the clock is clicked (touchstart, mousedown) events, register an event handler on the window for the touchmove and mousemove events. These events will send the x,y coords of the mouse or finger which we can use to determine the angle around the circle.\nWhen we setup our touchmove and mousemove events we'll also need to setup a touchend and mouseup event to cancel the event listeners.\nTo calculate the angle around the circle we need to get the center of the clock (x1, y1) and pass it into Math.atan2. The mouse position is (x2, y2) so we can get the angle of the mouse around the clock (in radians not degrees) by calculating Math.atan2(y2-y1, x2-x1)\n\nFrom that you should have enough to work with to get the dragging working. The math might need a little tweaking and I'm sure someone more mathy than I will chime out if I've made any mistakes here :)\nHope that helps!.

That salmon color is disgusting.. Why don't we branch it?. I have the latest version. Still having both issues. V.98. Same problem here guys. Required radio buttons don't show the required message. The page just scrolls up to them.\nUsing Chrome 57.0.2987.133 (Official Build) (64-bit). @wupadach 's second example is epic.. @wakuu Why on earth would you want duplicate auto-complete possibilities? It sounds like your code needs an update.. @waku No, I don't. I've use autoconplete in the same way. Dozens of cities have the same name in America. So do Roads. Your solution is the correct one. Just because they have the same name does not make them duplicates. They are still unique just with one piece of metadata in common.so your problem was not duplicate entries, but how to key your data so as to avoid duplicate keys. Try adding step=\"any\" to your input, as described here. I'm thinking that the input is expecting an integer. By adding step=\"any\", both integers and floats will be valid.. And as I stated before, adding step=\"any\" to the input fixes your issue \nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/jyeORZ. Mine? It doesn't when I do it. Honestly, it was an accident. I'm trying to find a way to delete this. sorry everyone . :(. Interesting solution @DanielRuf How would you capture the open event? \nNow, Lets say that the user has selected an option. And all of a sudden gets a message from the server that the available inventory has updated (via a websocket). In theory, I would\nDisable all selects\nUpdate the options for the selects\nRe-Initialize the selects\nWould this not remove the users previously selected item?\nThe issue is that the number of selects varies. They click an \"add item\" button, and a new select is added so that they can choose which inventory item needs to go in that slot. It's kind of like a rudimentary shopping cart. But we have a very small inventory, so the drop down works. \n. that's quite ugly, but it'll have to do. And I'm assuming that there's an \"open\" event that fires right before the select opens?. I'm using a desktop. Unfortunately my native resolution is 1280 X 1024, but still. That should be considered a large device right?\n-UPDATE\nI'm getting the same behavior on all of my devices. Even when I stretch the browser window across both of my monitors. I also tried my laptop at 1080P. OOOOOOH! So those were unix pipes, not binary OR. That makes SO much more sense. thanks for all of that. Now that I know the changes were on the master branch everything else kind of cleared itself up.\nFor some reason I thought the changes were made on some branch I didn't know about. So I'm essentially just using NPM to install the modules. Then run grunt release | monitor | js_compile which just pipes each grunt task to the next one.\nThat's definately simple enough..

The hard and bundled dependencies in this project are starting to be a reason for me to switch over to another css framework.\nI had to debug an issue last week where materialize was not bound to jQuery. Turned out to be a version problem. I had upgraded to a more recent version, where as materialize was using it's own bundled version of jQuery.\nSome while ago I had a lot of difficulties with Velocity (#4212) , and also the easing part has thrown me some issues.\nPlease take this issue seriously. Although the bundle size does matter; it's not \"just the bundle size\". The issue lies in double dependencies and possible conflicts.. Also; please add pickadate / picker.js to the list.. Any idea on when the new release will be published? Can't wait for this to be fixed.. Like this?\n```css\n.tabs {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n.tab {\n  float: left;\n}\n```. Only by making sure that the correct velocity version is imported before materialize. Effectively ending up with multiple versions of velocity in my bundle. \nMaterialize should not embed external libraries, but rather include them via npm. That's where npm is for, isn't it? .

Happy to help add a bunch of tests on top of this, now that we have a runner and framework agreed on :)\n. There are a bunch of gotchas you need to worry about when dealing with CSS3 columns. I've made you a working example since this is a nice pattern to follow (as long as you don't care about IE9)\nKey points:\nNon-breaking cards\nThis CSS (scss) prevents cards from being \"broken\". inline-block allows the cards to flow as if they're on a single line, and single lines cannot be split across multiple columns.\ncss\n.cards-container {\n   column-break-inside: avoid;\n   .card {\n       display: inline-block;\n   }\n}\nResponsive columns\nYou may want your columns to collapse responsively. The following will give you the same effect as if you had something like\nhtml\n<div class=\"col l4 m6 s12\">\n   <div class=\"card\">\n      ...\n   </div>\n</div>\n``` scss\n@mixin column-count($ct) {\n  -webkit-column-count: $ct;\n  -moz-column-count: $ct;\n  column-count: $ct;\n}\n@media #{$small-and-down} {\n  .cards-container {\n    @include column-count(1);\n  }\n}\n@media #{$medium-and-up} {\n  .cards-container {\n    @include column-count(2);\n  }\n}\n@media #{$large-and-up} {\n  .cards-container {\n    @include column-count(3);\n  }\n}\n```\nThe working example\n(click to visit it)\n \n. @Dogfalo I'll find some time soon to work with you and get the test suite working w/ travis-ci properly. my recommendation is to disable it for now\n.

At any rate, cheers, I see #1691 is due to be merged imminently. \n. @rogeriotaques I've just come across this issue too, but you're fundamentally misunderstanding what is going on here.\nThe pushpin function takes a \"bottom\" option:\nThe distance in pixels from the top of the page where the elements stops being fixed. (Default: Infinity)\nThe real problem here for the Materialize guys is that if you are specifying bottom as a pixel count instead of a div id (whose height sets offset), we're going to need media queries. Footers are taller at small and medium breakpoints. As @rogeriotaques pointed out, the pushpin example in the docs is broken on small/medium breakpoints.\nAlternatively, I think using a div id to get height and use this as offset is a better approach, but I suppose you'd have to add a window resize listener.\n.

Did you try for \"expandable\" option or \"accordion\" ? - Please note issue is for \"expandable\"\nI just committed a small test-change in collapsible.html --- you can see preview here:\nhttp://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/snow01/materialize/blob/master/collapsible.html\nTry to expand the expandable there - last one on the page.\n. @Dogfalo - It's not documented, I would probably add soon.\n@tinchoz49 - If you need to show some buttons both in desktop and mobile - do not enclose them in \"side-nav\" container. For example those 3 icons on right (shown in link http://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/structure.html#structure-app-bar) will not be inside a ul that has class \"side-nav\".\n.

At 2015, I think I should have already gotten a taste of the fix, but I cannot verify.\n2) I'm on 97.5 (which is a pain right now) and when I go to my Navigation bar or to a dropdown, I can tab to the dropdown control, the control expands, and then nothing is highlighted and there doesn't appear to be any way to select when you use the arrow keys.  With a mouse, of course it is the same flawless performance as expected, but for my accessibility testing, I have to be able to tab/enter/arrow through everything.\nI like this library very much, but the accessibility tweaking is turning into a nightmare.\nThank you,\nNewBo. Hey,\nGreat news.\n...\n...\n...\nSo what was the fix?  What do we need to do?\n?????. Hello,\nI'm working on accessibility features and while I have truly loved Materialize for a long time, this is turning into a pain.\nThe fix referenced in this is no longer working and I cannot see all of the changed code.  Please please please don't just put a build version--PUT THE ACTUAL CODE.  We are no longer able to see half of the good work you guys put in this.\nSorry -- I'm working with 97.5 because the accessibility came before updating and doing all the break fixes that upgrading causes.  TONS of BREAKS.  I cannot upgrade and now I cannot see what you did to fix the problem.\nPlease please put something more than @#$ASDF as a reply and closing the ticket.  It is very important to those of us who are coming along later.  \nPlease post the actual answer.\nNewbo. I've checked out 2777 and, while it may be great code, I cannot see all the files that changed.  When I attempt to look at the referenced build number I get told 3 files changed, but it only shows the 1st one.  Please consider publishing the actual code rather than simply a build number--it makes it much easier for those of us trying to struggle through problems rather than hoping that we can still access a given build.  And, seeing that this is something from 2015, we can no longer get there from here.\nPlease publish the actual information.. These are the ones that I know about now:\nRadio buttons\nCheck boxes\nCollapsible / Collapsible-accordion\nTabs\nNeed we go on?\nPlease tell us in code how to fix this.  I am working on accessibility and this is turning into a nightmare because all of the links point to long ago builds or builds that are no longer available.\nPlease help.. The only way to avoid the error is to add the \n1.12.1 - jquery-ui.js\n1.12.1 - jquery-ui.css\nI'm already importing jquery 3.2.1.\nBut this isn't as nice as the one demonstrated on https://materializecss.com/pickers.html .\nOne thing I'm wrestling with is that I'm using the webjars version, so I get the feeling it's something missing there, but I don't know what it is.. When I add the ui js and css, it really messes up the tabs.  So I can say that some materialize stuff is happening, but not the datepicker and time picker are not.. ",

From my (limited) experience with webpack, requirejs and reading browserify issues, I think that \"shimming\" Materialize to explicitly require jquery and in turn forcing the app to only have one single jquery instance might solve this issue.

The tap out is only reacting to click events which doesn't seem to be fired on iPad/iPhone.\nThis seems to work if you add a touchstart event handler or \"redirect\" touchstart to click (that is, fire a click event on touchstart events).\n. I agree with that. It would be really good if closeOnClick only closed a fixed menu if it's displayed on a small screen.\n. For datepicker it's really easy because you can simply set the container to \"body\" (or anything in between):\njavascript\n$('#datepicker').pickadate({ container: 'body' });\nModified fiddle:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/asbz02y7/\n.

I've seen this in a sidebar, but navbar works for me.\nPlunk: http://plnkr.co/edit/fDo4fBinveiQ1Wc6et7G?p=preview\nDid you apply waves to the <li>or <a> elements? I did it for <li> and that seems to work.\nHere's a fix for sidenav:\ncss\n.sidenav li.waves-effect {\n  display: block;\n}\n.sidenav li a:hover {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 100%;\n}\nAs you may see, waves cause elements to be display: inline-block; but the <a> elements are inline elements and thus have no width. This may be the reason for\n\nthe wave effect doesnt go all the way of the link but just in the middle of the item\n\nIf navbar doesn't work you could try to make the <a> elements be display: inline-block; and assign a width of 100%.\n. That was exactly my problem. Even worse, try titles with fewer characters, f.i. a single word. The navs will be next to each other.\nSeeing that, it was the hint I needed to do this:\ncss\n.sidenav li.waves-effect {\n  display: block;\n}\n.sidenav li a:hover {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 100%;\n}\nActually, that's untested as I made sidenav a custom element but it should be the same.\nHere is the original for reference.\n. @acburst @rahmadimaru\nHere's aCodePen illustrating the issue:\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/MKzYgz\n.

I don't know Vue.js enough but with Aurelia I had to issue a custom event on the jQuery change event to make that work. Maybe it helps.\nThis seems to work:\njavascript\nnew Vue({\n    el: 'body',\n        ready: function() {\n        var suspend = false;\n        $('#materialize-select').material_select();\n      $('#materialize-select').on('change', function() {\n        if (!suspend) {\n            suspend = true;\n          var event = new CustomEvent('change', {\n            detail: 'change',\n            bubbles: true\n          });\n          $(this).get(0).dispatchEvent(event);\n        }\n      });\n    }\n})\nBut only once in this example since the custom change also triggers jQuery's change. You'd have to prevent stack overflow in a cleverer way than me. :smile: \n(f.i. use a real callback and reset suspend there)\nUpdated fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jk5800wh/\n. Well, I guess you could encapsulate that behaviour in a component easily with either Angular, Angular2 or Vue.js :smile: \n.

Can you move the actual modal out of the parent and just keep the trigger there?\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/jAxQwK\n. @vpiassa29 is right, the initialization example states:\njavascript\n  $('input.autocomplete').autocomplete({\n    data: {\n      \"Apple\": null,\n      \"Microsoft\": null,\n      \"Google\": 'http://placehold.it/250x250'\n    }\n  });\nThis part: $('input.autocomplete') initializes an input with class autocomplete instead of an input with id autocomplete.\nBut it should also be corrected there and not in the HTML part.\n. When I understand this correctly, this may be a workaround:  https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/3790\nAlso, redirect touchstart events to trigger a click on iOS.\nThat is something like:\njavascript\n$(document).on('touchstart', function(e) { $(document).trigger('click'); });\n. TBH, Im not sure what else to expect from adding the invalid css class to the label.\nMaterialize validation is essentially HTML5 validation. If you remove invalid and enter an invalid email address into the pen, it gets \"invalid\". Works as expected IMO.\nYou may want to try the required attribute to check for empty input on form submit.\nOr add the invalid class when it's empty using a script during form submit.\n. I see, hmm..\nThe error text is \"tied\" to the label (which is not yet transformYed)..\nSo it's not supposed to move but technically it's supposed to be in the right place to begin with. :smiley: \n. @lpq66 Maybe attach the fab to the bottom, though. That way you can resize the header if needed (these \"waterfall\" headers for example):\ncss\n.header .fab-button {\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: -35px;\n  left: 10px;\n}\n. It works here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZBzYwB\n(check the second button)\nBtw.: @Dogfalo the CodePen should be updated to the current version. :smiley: \n. More like multiple triggers for the same modal.. :smiley: \nIt's not needed to initialize by class, btw. Just any selector that matches something. The href attribute on a link must be the same as the modal id. If you prefer buttons, you should be able to get away without using any IDs. IMO that's an improvement. :smiley: \n. MDL does basically the same thing but uses javascript. Less code is, in this case, just a matter of perception.\nThe Materialize spinner can at least be shown before any JS is loaded.\nHere is one with SVG and CSS (not from me):\nhttps://codepen.io/mrrocks/pen/EiplA\nBut I'm not sure about browser compatibility in this case.\nMaterialize spinner is at least compatible with anything out there, afaik.

I've tested with Chrome, Edge and Firefox.\nWhich browser are you using?\n. Interesting.. I had an older Chrome version and upgraded to 55. Doesn't happen anymore in Chrome 55.\nBut still happens on Edge and FF (probably IE as well). \ud83d\ude03 \nWould a preventDefault() do the trick here like there is one for the enter event? I could issue a PR for that, too. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Just to be precise, please note that this does not only happen when chips.length == 0.\nThe code line I posted would be the wrong place, though. \ud83d\ude03 . Yes.\nThe default action for the backspace key in the majority of browsers (including Chrome up to a certain point) is history.back().\nIn fact if you hit backspace on Chrome twice the browser shows a popup indicating that this binding is now alt + backspace.\nThus my proposal to prevent the default action if e.keyCode === 8. Just like it is done with the enter key (without adding a new chip, of course).. Interesting.. I'll try it, too when I have some time (I'm currently at work).\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @developeranirudhprabhu Not quite.. Hard to describe somehow.\nWith these lines not removed, the chip to be deleted is first selected (changes its background color to accent) then after another backspace it is removed and that is when the browser navigates back.\nNow with these lines removed chips behave differently. The chip to be deleted is not selected and is removed without triggering history.back(). Instead, the next chip is selected and when you then hit backspace it is removed from the list and still triggers history.back().. \ud83d\ude15 \nSo when you have these chips:\nApple Microsoft Google\nFocus the chip editor and press backspace it looks like this:\nApple _Microsoft_\n(note that I've put _ around the chip being selected)\nIf you nowpress backspace again it triggers history.back().\nI guess the event target is not the input anymore but the chip's <div>.\nBtw. if you blur the input before the second backspace and focus it again it works. But tbh. I think the behaviour of first selecting the chip is a bit nicer. \ud83d\ude03 \nI've tried to debug this behaviour. I think history.back() even happens before any event is caught by the chips implementation. With that I mean the second backspace after the chip is being displayed as selected.\nOf course that also means my \"proposal\" of using e.preventDefault() doesn't work either. I'll try some more if I find the time today.. @developeranirudhprabhu That seems to fix it! \ud83d\ude03 \nI've tried on IE11 and an older Chrome version (also Vivaldi which is basically the same as an older Chrome version).\nI can create a PR but I need some time to do that.

The problem is that Materialize requires jQuery (upper-case Q) while the package is called jquery (lower-case Q).\nAs far as I know, you would have to configure your loader/bundler to use one instance in both cases (plus I think window.jquery and $)..

Well check out this solution #794 and this will fix the issue, but it's not yet merged into master what you can do to fix temporarily is just load scrollfire as a dependency you can see that when i told creatifDynamics about it, so stick to that until the fix is merged into master \n. ok, so i inspected materialize a bit and it turns out that scrollfire is being generated on the wrong spot, meaning it's being used before it even exists so i changed the gruntfile to generate the new modified file and it seems to work, all of these changes are on my own fork #794, so please try out the new solution and tell me if it works @husterk \nNote : use the materialize file in the bin directory not in the dist directory \n. Well, we need @Dogfalo to merge my repo into this one, so please @Dogfalo there you have people saying that my solution works ( i am one of them)  so please merge!\n. I fixed it like a few days ago!, it wasn't working but now it is\n. please everyone that have tried my newest updates to the fix and have it working or not working, comment out on the pull request #794 if it works or not if not tell us what is your problem!! \n. @T00rk what is your problem??,  what is logged in the console?? \n.

Did you pull the new code?, and that js directory is it in dist or not?\n. Try using the entire repo instead of just that file because your version might be a little different \n. well i will add an example file there on how to use and try running that, i will give you a heads up when i do\n. it's done, i added a AMDtest.html to the repo, try cloning and open this file, tell me if it works (if there is no errors and all is displayed in the right way)\n. there is a new issue with their new code, in materialize, they are relying on the presence of the Materialize global variable in global.js which is a big mistake, AMD & commonjs support is needed there is alot of AMD & commonjs users out there so not only the global js file has to be fixed but also the other files that rely on the presence of Materialize globally, to do that we need to check if amd or commonjs support and if so the corresponding function should run which is an IFFEE argument function and the function that is called has that function as an argument i can help any time, if there is anyone that wants to help i would be happy !! and i almost forgot to thank everyone for their support !!\n. Try adding velocity as a dependency to the modal file it might be called modal but i am not sure do that in the app config and rebuild you will find some instructions on hiw to do it in the comments above, or just to debug use the materialize amd file in the js directory not in dist and change it there and see if it works, anyways i will take a look at it asap for now try that if not tell me and i will help you \n. ok this means i have to diagnose the problem and i will give you a heads up when i do\n. True, and that's what i did exactly and also what vuza did is just modified my code but still there are some issues with some functionalities, so i will be testing the code more and more to recognize all the issues and fix it all up,hopefully i will be able to do that very soon\n. @ronakkhunt hi just wanted to let you know that the modal issue was fixed, please confirm it works!, and for everyone else who is having this issue can try it too\n. @akwuh this was my idea initially but this is totally wrong, cause you are using AMD to prevent global variables and when u set define.AMD to false all variables become global, and now AMD is not useful for u, if u use it normally it will be the same so this is not a solution , the apropriate solution is to do it the AMD way, which is what i've also done in my Materialize-AMD repo\n. @akwuh then just add Hammer as a dep. to toast , or just make Hammer only Global while keeping the other the same, the issue here is the guys that added Materialize depended on Hammer to be global and tha's a really bad mistake, they didn't account for AMD nor commonjs they just agnored it that entire file needs refactoring and alot of work just to support AMD and commonjs, and it's always a bad idea to assume things Materialize is gaining popularity and it's a must to account for all the different uses of this library it's used to make things easier and not harder !, we can just put the same plugins they use in our code without using materialize it self bt we use it cause it have all what we need for material design so really it's just essential to support AMD and commonjs, which is actually a must for scalable apps, if they didn't do it we can't just build scalable apps!\n. yes, they must do it from 0 and not a workaround they must always account\nfor all different kinds of uses not just one\nthe global thing (turning define.amd to false) just makes the library act\nas if we used it globally so it should work , i don't know why u get this\nerror, it usually works\nhope they can fix it soon, i am sorry but i have more important stuff than\nmaterialize so i hope they can fix it ASAP\nOn Thu, Sep 10, 2015 at 10:24 PM, Yurij Mikhalevich \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nVoting up for the issue.

Yes but the problem is whenever i resolve they keep updating it if ibresolve they should merge into master if not then there is no need to do it unless they want to merge and they are confident about it\n. for further updates follow me @max1011\n. for further updates follow me @max1011\n. yes, i will pull fix conflicts and then re push , the changes i add are very simple so it shouldn't affect your code, do you want me to recompile this file using dest specific commands,  with all your updates and then my own, i will just tell you some other things you have to keep in mind and that's all it works and there is no problem merging after conflicts are resolved, at the moment i am busy i am working on a project so just wait a few days, i will give you a heads up when it's all ready!\n. right now i am like half way to fully fix the conflicts, what's left is the gruntfile and the dist materialize js file, i will try to finish those soon because these conflicts are really annoying and hard to figure out as well  so it might take me a while so that i can understand and fix the conflicts properly not just throwing code to fix.\nso just be patient !, and hope it all works!\n. view my comment on #634 and close the issue if that was solved for you, because this issue is there before so no need to it, if you have any probs feel free to contact me\n. view my comment on #634 and close the issue if that was solved for you, because this issue is there before so no need to it, if you have any probs feel free to contact me\n. materialize is included from dist or from bin ??\n. materialize is included from dist or from bin ??\n. don't load any thing from the materialize project to the materialize project , like hammerjs, and all the other stuff you are loading just don't load them, and load only materialize with any third party libraries that you want, and look at the console tell me what is the output and on which line and what is that line (if there is)\n. @T00rk this is what the doc says about your issue(mismatched define..) & how to fix it (because you manually used the code),\nTo avoid the error:\n- Be sure to load all scripts that call define() via the RequireJS API. Do not manually code script tags in HTML to load scripts that have define() calls in them.\n- If you manually code an HTML script tag, be sure it only includes named modules, and that an anonymous module that will have the same name as one of the modules in that file is not loaded.\n. @kat-liger hammer is undefined because the jquery hammer (which is different that hammer.js), was not loaded properly or even not loaded at all ! , here is how it should look like in the shim according to the new version:\n\njavascript\n    'jquery.hammer': {\n      deps: ['jquery', 'hammerjs', 'waves']\n    }\n. @ekarudianto i think if your problem is with waves then you must add it as a dep. to jquery.hammer just like the comment above\n. i thought that you included the code manually (copy & paste) in the final compiled js file, now you still have that probem or any similar issue ? \n. @kat-liger can u take a screenshot please? , and tell me which line it was , and if you put your code up some where like code pen or fiddler just so that i can grab all of it that will be alot better\n. ok so i diagnosed your site and i can see that jquery.hammer is not being loaded (check the network tab to see it your self), so the solution to that is to add it as a dep. to materialize (as 'jquery.hammer'), and hopefully that will make it work\n. you are welcome @kat-liger , @T00rk do you still have the problem ? try to do the same.\n. what is your code currently ? , try to make a plunk or something, i want to see your code and try it live, or maybe use heroku and put it online so that i can diagnose it properly.\n. ok check the network tab in chrome and check if jquery.hammer is loaded, and just give me the code please!\n. you said that you included it but where did you do so, and did you copy & paste to some file ? cause that can be the entire issue, in require.js you are not allowed to copy and paste code with define() into some other file that has other define() \n. first of all for jquery.hammer it should look like this:\njavascript\n  'jquery.hammer': {\n      deps: ['jquery', 'hammerjs', 'waves']\n    }\n. add the global module as a dep. to forms\n. ok, tell me what happens\n. the materialize undefined problem ?\n. but this error to which file ? \n. did u copy paste anything ?\n. to compile that file u need to use r.js not file concatenation plugins cause that causes problems, if u don't know how to use it here is the code to run it: \njavascript\ncd js\nr.js -o app.build.js\nfor the app.build.js it must have the same shim as the other file, and it has other configs do it on your own check the docs for any other options, here is an example app build file:\nhttps://github.com/max1011/materialize-AMD/blob/master/js/app.build.js\n. listen i need all of your code to identify the real problem , i just can't look at some error and tell you what is the reason (most of the times you can), but here it's a little bit more complicated, can u put your code in a repo or just anything i want to see all of your files really to know exactly what are you trying to do, and are u using my repo (Materialize-AMD), give it a try , and try to customize the code that is in there and compile with r.js, at the end u have to figure it out some way!\n. well, what happens is i change define.amd to false so when it comes to hammer it will skip the if statement that checks for define.amd because it's false and it will be used as if it was public (normal), so hammer will be publicly available, and the argument Hammer that is passed to the function probably i forgot to remove it because we can use hammer normally without requiring it, so amd might allow us to do something like that without giving an error and works normally but i am not sure so i will check and i will let you know, when trying to log Hammer inside of the function it will probably give us the Hammer function but like i said i am not sure and i will test it, and if there is a need for change i will change! \n. the problem here with this file is that they are using multiple define statements and that's not allowed so to over come that i did what i did (it's all explained) so the thing is here you can't rely on amd because you can't define a module then require it at some point later in that file so the only solution is to make hammer publicly availabe (from that file) so when hammer runs it's code it thinks it's being used normally but it's actually used with amd, i haven't tested what i told you i wanted to test, i am busy today so maybe tommorow or after it (i don't know when i will have free time) so yeah , just wait until i fully test and i will tell you the whole story ok ?\n. and also by the way your suggestion is amazing but like i said it is not possible that's what the guys that created Require did and it's the AMD spec and i didn't wrote it so i don't know why they don't allow you to do such a thing, anyways i think now you know why i rely on hammer being publicly available vs. amd version of it, and note that you don't have to include hammerjs file in require config all you need is the materialize file because it makes no sense to have the same code twice which is the hammer library, this solution works and tested but what i haven't tested is what i talked about so there is no problem in using it i guess, only if you have any problems just include materialize from the bin directory and it will work fine (of course using require not the normal way)\n. so, it's been a while since the last time i worked with this repo so i investigated a bit and just remembered what i did exactly, turns out this file is kind of outdated, because this file is compiled with frunt but i only ran the dist js compile once on the first stages of the solution, this section where talking about is the jquery.hammer.js so you can see what i really did and what worked and what i tested , i was compiling the temp grunt task rather than dest so the most updated version is in the bin directory, that file is not readable so you can take a look at the real code in js/jquery.hammer.js there you can see what i did exactly, if you have any problem just LMK ok ?\n.

    "T00rk": "I had the same problem. I downloaded the version from your repository and that works.\nThanks a lot.\nEDIT\nFinally that doesn't work. I haven't had the error message again and my page did load, but that was just because meterialize.js wasn't included.\n. I've got a \"Load timeout for modules: materialize\" or\nscrollFire is not defined\nIt depends\n. @max1011 Yes that's ok now\n. @max1011 Yes that's ok now\n. I have the same problem.

Hey Alvin,\nPlease reconsider this decision.\nFlexbox is the way to go forward. There are ways to get Flexbox working in IE, and IE8 or older have very small (<4%), and dwindling, market share. The kinds of apps built for a Material Design audience, appeal to users who use modern browsers anyway. The README already mentions that Materialize only supports IE10+.\nThe community is looking for a good framework that uses Flexbox.\nLet's make Materialize better than Bootstrap, which has refused to use flexbox. \n. In #1230, @Dogfalo said\n\nWe don't plan to add support for IE9 and if this is something that you need, you will have to look elsewhere.\n\nSo we'll need to figure out what the Flexbox issues are in IE10+, and come up with workarounds. https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs is a great start - a repo listing flexbox bugs and workarounds.\n. Added this as a con to http://www.slant.co/topics/150/viewpoints/19/~what-are-the-best-css-frameworks~materialize, among many great features.\n. Added this as a con to http://www.slant.co/topics/150/viewpoints/19/~what-are-the-best-css-frameworks~materialize, among many great features.\n. @lee-40square: if Flexbox is not mature enough, can you please remove the mention at http://materializecss.com/footer.html that MaterializeCSS uses flexbox?\n. You can probably use Materialize along with Bootstrap as well, but does it make sense?\nIf I use a flexbox grid system, then the Materialize one is just deadweight. Same if I use flexbox for a proper sticky footer instead of the Materialize one.\nFor what it's worth, Bootstrap 4 has optional flexbox support.\nAnyway, please remove the false claim at http://materializecss.com/footer.html that flexbox is used for the sticky footer. It's not. See #1409.\n. Yes, the package should include the _un_minified .js file.\n. ",

Hi and thanks @carlosperate, I also need to enable interaction outside the side bar, without closing it.\nHow could I do? Should I replicate the component in js and compile a new one? Could you give some guidelines? In jquery ui is possible to have similar behavior with .resize, Id like to use only one framework.\n. I too use a custom template?\nAs example, I would like to use a list of cards instead of a collection, and include more elements than ID, text, and Image.\nHow could I do that?\nAlso, how to load from external URL ?\nIs that autocomplete function a native of jquery or part of materialize extension ?\n\nI tried something like this to load from external url, but it is messy.\nAnything neater to wrap up in Autocomplete.js?\n```\n$input.on('keyup', function () {\n  $.ajax({\n    url: 'http://example.com/fuzzyautocomplete',\n    type: 'GET',\n    data: {\n      q: function() {\n        return $input.val();\n      }\n    },\n    success: function( data ) {\n\n          // $input.remove(); // Clear the old elements\n          var newData = $.extend({}, $input.autocomplete()); // Create copy of autocomplete object\n          for (var i = 0; i < 20 && i < data.length; i++) {\n            newData.data(\n                (data[i][\"name\"]), \n                {\n                  'id' : data[i][\"id\"],\n                  'text' : data[i][\"extract\"],\n                  'image' : 'http://lorempixel.com/400/300/food/1/'\n                }); // Iterate through results and add to the copied autocomplete object (I set the limit to 20 as this is the limit I set below for the autocomplete)\n          }\n\n        console.log(newData.data());\n\n        // for (var i = data.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        //   data[i]\n        // };\n\n        $input.autocomplete({\n            data: newData.data(),\n            limit: 20,\n            onAutocomplete: function(data) {\n              console.log('data', data);\n\n\n            },\n            minLength: 1, // The minimum length of the input for the autocomplete to start. Default: 1.\n            scrollLength: 2, // The maximum number of elements to display before the scroll. Default: disable scroll.\n        });\n\n\n    }\n  })\n\n});\n```\nOther issues:\nThere is also something wrong with 'image' property passed to data structure for autocomplete like the example above by @jonathanarodr :\ndata: {\n                \"Apple\": {\n                    id: 1,\n                    text: 'Apple Inc',\n                    image: null,\n                },\nIt seems onAutcomplete() searches for the image (or the data obejct) in the my uri domain :\nhttp://example.com/app/[object%20Object] error not found\nAnd last issue (UX) related:\nIf will have a long list, I would like to keep the search bar fixed, and the scrolling of a list of custom items (like in Google Maps).\nBut it fails, for all the list and input search get scrolling (I was not able to fix it using position : fixed on the input field, because it prevents all the list from scrolling. I would like to have scrolling behind the input search, like in Google Maps indeed.\nsee below:\n\n. by the project do you mean the index.js file?. by the project do you mean the index.js file?. thank you\u00a0@Dogfalo for helping out - i iupload a folder and kept the relevant structure.\nsee in attachment!\ndebug.zip\n. thank you\u00a0@Dogfalo for helping out - i iupload a folder and kept the relevant structure.\nsee in attachment!\ndebug.zip\n. @Dogfalo Hi Alvin, sorry to hear that.

Okey, i just copied the sources from your test server and exchanged the materialize.min.js for the new one manually. So far, the weird thing for me is.

( yeah, i know right? weird shit, thats why i wasn't having the issue myself) i have to do some other stuff for a bit, ill get back to you in approx 3 hours. :)\n. Fixed it quite quick:\nin sidenav.js file line 57 it has the following IF statement:\njs\n    //set to width\n        if (options.menuWidth != 240) {\n          menu_id.css('width', options.menuWidth);\n          if (!menu_id.hasClass('fixed')) {\n            menu_id.css('left', -1 * (options.menuWidth + 10));\n          }\n        }\nIt doesn't check the edge variable when giving the menu its left attribute.\nTo fix this:\nreplace this block with:\njs\n        // Set to width\n        if (options.menuWidth != 240) {\n          menu_id.css('width', options.menuWidth);\n          if (!menu_id.hasClass('fixed')) {\n            if(options.edge === 'left'){\n                menu_id.css('left', -1 * (options.menuWidth + 10));\n            }else{\n                menu_id.css('right', -1 * (options.menuWidth + 10));\n            }\n          }\n        }\nworks for me now. \n. this seems to be caused by the css rule:\ncss\nul.side-nav.full li, ul.side-nav.fixed li{ width:240px;}\noverwriting it seems to fix it for me. However, i don't have this width issue on my own page. even though on the page im testing your layout on, i seem to have it on both left and right side with both fixed and full nav. I will delve into it a bit deeper later on, but the temporary fix should do the job for you atm i hope ^^\n. my paddings seem to be fine if i try this \" the grid way\"  ( using jade for templating) just imagine div in front of every line and indents as \"is inside the element on the row above me\"  if you are not familiar with jade. \njade\n        .container\n            .row\n                .col.s12(style='background-color:red;') here is some talk for the big containing column. \n                    .row(style='background-color:purple;')\n                        .col.s12.m6(style='background-color:yellow;')  and then this is a 6-column block inside the big 12col one. if the screensize is medium or higher\n                        .col.s12.m6(style='background-color:brown;')  but both of these will align beneath eachother if my screensize falls beneath the medium viewport size.\nreasoning why i tried this as first attempt comes from the documentation:\nRemember when you are creating your layout that all columns must be contained inside a row and that you must add the col class to your inner divs to make them into columns\nwhat it does in css is: a row has a negative margin to make up for the padding it's container. \nso the row basically negates the padding increase from the column in which it is placed. \nI hope this helped you\n. the table, tr and td elements were showing \"display: table, table-row or table-cell\"  as their display style while the rule it was computing from was saying it had to be display: block.

A quick fix for me : \nSASS\n    .sidenav {\n        @media only screen and (min-width : 992px) {\n            transform: translateX(0px) !important;\n        }\n        }\nAnother problem on Android when the keyboard shows up on a search field, the sidenav close.\nI had to listen on focusin and out to add/remove a class on side nav : \n.fix-keyboard {\n            transform: translateX(0px) !important;\n        }\nHope it helps. My bad I didn't saw the new documentation.\nI can't change that easily right now but will do later.\nFor now I just changed this code :\ne.trigger(\"chip.select\",e.data(\"chips\")[t])\nto :\ne.trigger(\"chip.select\",e.data()?e.data(\"chips\")[t]:null)\nTo prevent the error.\nThanks,. After some digging, it seems to occurs when chips are within the same FORM tag as others input fields.\nThat's really annoying as I must have chips in the middle of a form. Any ideas ?. Thanks for your reply.\nThat's indeed not an ideal solution.\nWould you consider something that can be usefull for desktop users too, an alternative solution to validate entries on chips ?\nI had to add an helper text in order for my users to understand how to enter chips, as it is, it's not easily understandable by common (not geek like us) users.\nI suggest a button like this : \n\nThat would solve android problem too.. My solution until it's fixed correctly, if it can help someone.\nWorking fine on desktop & android\n```\n//Javascript / jquery\n//Call this function after chips initialization\nfunction chips() {\n$('.chips').each(function() {\n                var that=this;\n                $(this).find('input').after('add');\n                $(this).on('click', 'a.add', function(e) {\n                    e.preventDefault();\n                    var input=$(e.currentTarget).prev('input');\n                    $(that).chips('addChip', {\n                        tag: input.val()\n                    }); \n                    input.val('');\n                });\n            });\n}\n//css\n.chips a.add {\n  display: inline-block;\n  height: 32px;\n  line-height: 32px;\n  opacity: 0;\n  text-align: center;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-out;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  width: 32px; }\n  .chips a.add i {\n    line-height: 32px; }\n  .chips a.add:hover {\n    opacity: 1 !important; }\n.chips.focus a.add {\n  opacity: 0.6; }\n```.

It's not being recreated. It's going away. If it comes back, it will be an entirely new select element, so, if I call material_select on the new tag, a new ul would be created, without the old one being removed.\n. makes sense. It's simply to create a new select than compare the options and change/add/remove what's necessary.\nEven if it wasn't the case, there was still the case of the select permanently being removed, and we end up with an ul not being removed.\n. @ganySA I don't really understand your problem. This issue is regarding removing junk left by the select. Calling .material_select() reloaded the select with the new options, last time I checked, and the pull request allows us to call .material_select('destroy') to get rid of the junk and return the select to it's uninitialized state.\nAlthough you have a good point about select2, that's something to be discussed in another issue.\n. @ganySA  Then we should use that issue to discuss that problem.

I have created a modal in Angularjs. It was a bit of code to write, and it requires a good understanding of scopes. I decided to create a gist with my code. As for the select, see issue #706 \nTo use my modal, simply inject the modal in your controller(or whatever) and call modal.open.

It's no big deal. I think I'll write a angular lib for materialize. At least the controls (such as the select) and the modal.\n. I'm having this problem too, and I noticed a div with the id \"lean-overlay\" is created every time a new modal is opened.\nI identified the problem after looking at the code in the file leanModal.js. The new overlay is created with jQuery, stored in a variable, and appended to the body. So far so good. \nThe problem is, in lines 21, 36 and 43, for example, instead of using the variable stored for the overlay, they run a new selector, and since it's an id, it gets only the first overlay it finds (jQuery seems to work like this), and reanimates it, and add the click handler to it, if it's dismissible. Not only that, but the newly created overlay remains on the document, even after the modals have closed, because they cannot be referenced.\nSo the issue can be fixed just by changing $(\"#lean-overlay\") to overlay on the lines I said above.\nClosing the modal also has the same problem, but it can be fixed storing the overlay variable into the modal data with the .data function of jQuery, and retrieving it when closing the modal.\nI would create a pull-request, but the last one I submitted hasn't even seen interaction yet, so I won't waste my time unless one of the maintainers ask me to do this.\n. Is this already in bower? I'm using the latest version available in bower, but the modal is still using the version with the id for the overlay.\n. ",

Yes. I did not forget to add the CSS rule, and because of important ! the activates.css(...) call cannot change position anymore (which is good, we want fixed).\nNote that I only tested with my own code and with materialize v0.100.2, your mileage may vary.\nUpdate: I believe our comments crossed, I already answered your next comment.. I just realized (the hard way) that while my suggested patch works when there is a fixed-positioned ancestor, it completely breaks in the case when there is not.\nSee previous comment for an updated patch.. @Lennuj420 I have this in the materialize dropdown.js code, look for the // Position dropdown comment around line 165:\n```javascript\n        // Position dropdown\n        / patch inspired from: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/1527#issuecomment-365829158\n        activates.css({\n          position: 'absolute',\n          top: origin.position().top + verticalOffset + scrollYOffset,\n          left: leftPosition + scrollXOffset\n        });\n        /\n        var fixedParents = activates.parents().filter(function () {\n          return $(this).css('position') === 'fixed';\n        });\n        var msie = window.navigator.userAgent.indexOf(\"MSIE \") !== -1 ||\n          !!navigator.userAgent.match(/Trident.*rv\\:11./);\n        if (fixedParents.length > 0 && !msie) {\n          var fixedOffset = fixedParents.get().reduce(function (acc, ancestor) {\n            acc.top += $(ancestor).offset().top;\n            acc.left += $(ancestor).offset().left;\n            return acc;\n          }, {\n            top: 0,\n            left: 0\n          });\n          activates.css({\n            position: 'fixed',\n            top: origin.offset().top - fixedOffset.top + verticalOffset + scrollYOffset,\n            left: origin.offset().left - fixedOffset.left + scrollXOffset\n          });\n        } else {\n          activates.css({\n            position: 'absolute',\n            top: origin.position().top + verticalOffset + scrollYOffset,\n            left: leftPosition + scrollXOffset\n          });\n        }\n    // Show dropdown\n\n```\nIf it still does not work and you have verified that your browser is loading the correct code, then probably you have a setup which is not addresses by the patch.

Besides it's a pretty major issue as the npm packages simply cannot work at all w/ this bug. So it's surprising it hasn't been fixed already. Anyway I'm gonna make a PR.. Finally I'm unsure about making a PR. Because I don't know how the gruntfile is organized. I don't know how to use it actually.. +1 (year)\n. I installed npm version and everything's working seamlessly. Meteor plans to depreciate Atmosphere in favor of npm in any way.. Sure,\nI did npm i --save materialize-css. I use sass so I had two choices : \n1) In my import.scss (or whatevernameyouwant.scss) in my /client folder do @import \"../node_modules/materialize-css/sass/materialize.scss\" \nOR\n2) if you want to import only certains sass modules. You put materialize.scss in your client, or you put materialize.scss in /imports and you import it in a .scss file from /client. In the file that you copy paste from node_modules/materialize-css/sass/materialize.scss or from the git repo you replace every single @import \"components/\" by @import {}/node_modules/ or @import ../node_modules (you put as much as ../ as you need to access from materialize.scss to the root folder). After that you can import only sass modules you want.\nI didn't try importing .js yet.\nEDIT : Not only the Meteor package is buggy but also the npm package, see #1422. This project is good but has so many issues unsolved.... Hello. As I had the same problem, The solution for me was to add \"overflow-y: visible\" to the modal. \nBy default it is set by Materialize to auto. According to W3C, overflow-y: auto :\n\nShould cause a scrolling mechanism to be provided for overflowing boxes\n\nSo changing auto to visible will make modal unscrollable. I hope this bit could help but this is not a real fix as we need to both show select properly and have a modal scrollable...\n. Second solution use brower's native select by adding browser-default to select as described here. I didn't already figure out which css rules makes browser's native select visible even with overflow-y: auto which is what set by default at bottom sheet modal\n. In this case I was in default zoom but it appears that change zoom can or cannot fix the problem \n. I close as it's a bit annoying for maniac but I think Materialize team has higher priority as they have more than one hundred issue and 270 PR (and it's growing)\n. I didn't understand, until I come across here, that we can customize the color of toasts.. I also have this bug in chrome on android ...\n. I agree\n. see #1018. Commit 5afb6000 add support. You may a little bit, tough, as there's not doc already and there's still issues as  #3281. Besides I needed to remove the materialize.scss otherwise when I added file per file (_variables.scss etc.) it was doubled with materialize.scss.\nSo yeah support is incoming maybe @Dogfalo could tell us a word about that ;)\n. see #1018.

Hello Josepdal, sorry for your problem, I had the same on IE (#2903). I sent a pull request, I don't know if Materialize's team will accept it but as I already patch my website you could test if my pull request fix your problem here : https://pharmaciesousprefecture.fr/ :D\n.

You welcome, as I didn't use form in my search I didn't saw that, I'll commit soon then :D\n. Actually even with form tag surrounding search navbar as proposed by doc it's good for me in IE 11, but I can reproduce the issue in your website by removing height 100% from form as you use search from navbar in a non convential way thus I'll include your modify\n. Not fixed by #3013 ??\n. @Dogfalo why don't you fix that ?. @Dogfalo why don't you fix that ?. Thanks to you for you awesome framework and to add the sass support on meteor as some asked :D \n. By the way all the font are downloaded, is that normal ? In chromium based browser only woff2 should be downloaded, right ? \n\n. any news ?\n. This is kinda incredible as I opened an issue 2 months ago, so way before atmosphere's package was updated, and I referenced this issue to told to fix this bug before publishing, but they just didn't change anything, wait 2 months and publish it with this big bug.\n. +1 mitar (thanks to mitar who's improving both the UI framework I use (materialize) and the isomorphic (back + front) framework I use (Meteor))\n. If anyone of the official team @Dogfalo @acburst etc. could try to make scrollSpy reinitiable it would be very handy \n. I'll show you if you want but I already check, if there's some text with scrollspy and then I init scrollspy it's working but if the HTML changes the scrollspy remains the same as before, and there's no way to refresh it, if I redo       $('.scrollspy').scrollSpy(); it doesn't clean old scrollspy, actually it doesn't do anything.\n. The explanation, that class scrollspy hasn't to be on the title only but on a whole div which wrap title + content, you gave to me on #3830 makes that this issue isn't an issue anymore (for me at least), scrollSpy is working even with dynamic content.\n.

If that can help you a bit you can do that\n// toast takes (message, thetime, theclass), if you set second param (time) to null toast will never dismiss automatically \nMaterialize.toast($message, null, 'offline-toast');\nAnd so to remove it, one just have to call\n$('.offline-toast').remove();\n. You can define you own timeout why do you need a default one ? If only one toast could be shown it wouldn't be backward compatible, except if you want to introduce a fifth parameter to toast maybe ?\n. You can define you own timeout why do you need a default one ? If only one toast could be shown it wouldn't be backward compatible, except if you want to introduce a fifth parameter to toast maybe ?\n. @smitthakkar96 I know you can pass a className, I used className in my first example to show @FoxInFlame how you can add a className to remove one or many toast (depending if you defined one class per toast or one class per all toasts)\n. @smitthakkar96 maybe you wanted to talk to talk @someoneelse\n. Great minds think alike. \n. By the way why isn't dist/js/materialize.js updated by the commit but only bin/materialize.js is updated ?\n. I like it,  this is real material design +1 I will be very happy to see a standard implementation of such design.\n. \"Offcourse I know its material design :|\"\n\"......but we must not stop now.......lets make this possible in official materialize release\"\nSeemingly you didn't get what open source is.\nYou didn't pay for Materialize, it is free, the team and all contributors (hundreds of PR) offers their time to improve this framework for free.

Great I'm happy you stop giving us order to understand what is really open source. Actually, to be honest, I was like you few months/years ago.\nI would be glad to offer the support you could need.\n. Good question. Indeed there's a lack of Materialize template, I remember I wanted a template to show message but there was none except this one http://demo.geekslabs.com/materialize/v2.1/layout03/index.html but it was paying. All geekslab's Materialize templates are paying so maybe you can grab inspiration from the simplest templates they offer but for free (without copying)\n. \"I won't make a pull request\"\nI'm not concerned by this issue, but I am by the fact that people have no problem to take the code for free from an open source project like this but don't always want to help in return by making PR. @GLedoussal if you think about the great result you can have with Materialize without working on the plugin you could think that you could make a PR. It will maybe not be accepted but it will open a discussion with the team and other user about this and they will tell you if this is has side effect or no.\nPlease don't be egoist and think about the next user who could waste time on this, think about the time you have won thanks to previous users who took their time to make a PR so you don't waste yours.\n. (!!) Indeed that explains my modals wasn't working anymore since weeks. I think it's a shame really to make such changes and pack it into a minor version.\nI've try to searched : open modal is not a function materialize and didn't found anything because I and other devs cannot guess that you change public functions and only upgrade a minor version. Thanks @GuillermoBlanco I would have never guess why app wasn't working well, or not before a long time, without your message. What a shame to be such unpredictable.\n. How long do the team will ignore such an issue. The problem is not to unpublish/republish but to be careful when you change a public method on an API used by thousands devs including in production\n. @kmmbvnr you may not be a native speaker because you have a pretty weird definition of ungrateful, I'm grateful and I show it (three PR more than you for instance). \n\n[...] constant abuse from ungrateful users. Some toxic users [...]\n\nTell me what is ungrateful by saying that Materialize team should be more careful ? I said : \n\nHow long do the team will ignore such an issue. The problem is not to unpublish/republish but to be careful when you change a public method on an API used by thousands devs including in production\n\nYou said that I've been thinking that maintainers are : \n\nunder obligation to give your time for free\n\nIf a lot of website depends on it and you didn't drop support nor pass the maintainer role to another guy you have to not break these numerous projects that depend on it. In which way am I asking to spend time, I'm not even telling them to rebuild (which could take .. oh my god ... few minutes).\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/ungrateful?\nTo resume I'm grateful but when a big project cannot break the API without taking some prevention (actually just change major version, not minor one). Don't mix me up with Levino, I don't agree with his way of telling what we're all agree on.\nAlso see #3825 to see if I'm a toxic user and next time before being agressive for no reason think a little bit.\n. I'm not in a part of a entreprise, not a professional, I dont whine, I didn't had to make a lot of changes, I just really think thay they should change the major version when they change API. They decided to change minor version, it's a wrong decision as peoples lost time because of that and as it's a NPM package it's even more likely to break compatibility in a production app. I do respect open source and what this project is, I just share my mind on a decision.\n. Why did you close this issue ? We cannot import SASS files even tough @Dogfalo said in many issues he added this possibility. When I @import \"{materialize:materialize}/sass/components/color\"; it also says {materialize:materialize}/sass/components/color not found in file: so this issue is still a problem in my opinion.. @Kostronor yes but you have to download the repository so the atmosphere package is broken, isn't it ? If we have to download the repo and add manually locally package, things don't work as intented by Materialize's creators so either you gotta reopen this issue or I open a new one.. Thanks. @tomscholz  I tried to install materialize on a fresh Meteor project and the installation didn't work though. @j1016h yes I downloaded the repo, put it in the package then meteor add materialize:materialize works.. @tomscholz I'm pretty sure I did, anyway as everything's working with the local repo I'll wait before trying your fix.

Would a better approach have not to use tried and tested components e.g select2 and simply skin it for materialize css.

Opening a second modal once a modal is already opened doesn't work well. The overlay is referenced by the id \"lean-overlay\", so only one overlay can exist on the page. If you open a second modal, the overlay flashes, and it gets deleted when the second modal is closed, so you end with the first modal without overlay.\nFor now I only need 2 modals opened at the same time in one specific situation, where the second modal is created and populated in JS, so I've solved it by extending the lean-overlay styles into a new class, renaming the id of the lean-overlay of the element before the second modal is opened, and renaming it back to lean-overlay once the second modal is closed\n.

I add more complexity and confusion (my point of view of course). . Haha we both don't understand each other mind ;) But thanks for trying ! \nI'll post some code if it could help. But basically here is a typical situation: \n\nBasic app for activities management. \nAn activity will have a title, a start (datetime), an end (datetime), and a bunch of other fields\nClient says: \"we need to make an activity and it will occur three times, monday x, thuesday y and monday z in two weeks\". We didn't want to repeat the process of filling a new activity form for each date because it's the same infos except for the dates. Here dates didn't follow a pattern like every x week... \n\nIn the form we put an text field connected to the date picker and this particular datepicker is set to allow multiple pick. So the datepicker won't close when a date is selected and the user can select some other dates. The selected dates appeared with a different color on the datepicker so the user sees which dates are chosen. \nThe text field is filled with dates separated by a comma. \nIn the backend we can now parse the textfield and do what we need to do: created more activities in the db with different dates or put dates in a separated model .... \nHere is an exemple of the multiple date picker in action Just be sure to uncomment the allowMultiple line in the options.\nHope this helps! \n. @fega you making me curious, what were you thinking about? \nI agreed to the fact that it's not a common use case, but I also think that it could be a nice enhancement! \nThe fact that the date picker is part of the framework is interesting and avoid having to chose another lib and then try to adjust all its classes and styles to match the framework and theme. . @tomscholz As you mentioned that Materialize uses a modified version cannot it be simpler to add this? \nActually I know that pickadate currently didn't support it, but the link mentioned above on jsbin shows  that the version 4.0 of pickadate can do it. Maybe we can grab the code for that and use it in the \"modified version\" ?. @fega I agree with you, maybe there are more important things to do. As soon as I got time I'll try something and share it if possible.\n@tomscholz strange this is working for me\n\n. @tomscholz sadly yes, maybe the decision should not to add new options to the date picker but do we need to maintain our own picker or should it be externalized. \nMaybe we should wait the answer of the lead contributors to the request and see if we get a clear vision for the future of the picker, than we can decide to make a move or not on the multiple date selection. \nBTW thanks for the discussion, I'm sure we'll come with great ideas..

(in this case the Ng2-Materialize)\nCurrently I think of using the a clean Materialize (wanted to say Material Design ) (https://material.angular.io/) that has a great support of Google and is not much behind in its functions and beauty.\nI also saw the possibility of using PrimeNG (https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/), they have a lot of functions but I do not like the fact that I have so many paid themes, and the themes that are free are kind of lame.\nNice coding for everyone! \ud83e\udd47 .

I was actually having a problem until I implemented this commit: 1d94110\nand then removed my own 'touchstart .selector': function() {...} map in meteor; then all started working right again..\nit happens because the touch event is happening multiple times (sometimes before the link is clicked and followed, and sometimes after) so the 2nd click makes the dropdown disappear. . I'm using meteor  and calling an API to get images to fill carousel. \ncarousel doesn't render when called before images are called, so i set so that when the 'template' is rendered, it calls $('.carousel.carousel-slider').carousel({fullWidth: true}) when each image loads... so sometimes it is called 10 times or more.. \nIt seems that the first carousel object i look at works, and then all other carousels do not when called, (because maybe i'm calling .carousel() multiple times like @Wesitos  mentioned?\noh and i'm forcing height on the carousel with css, so it's always there, just no images. \nsometimes i'll call $('.carousel.carousel-slider').carousel({fullWidth: true}) in the browser console, just to see if my code didn't call it; but no results.  Seeing @Wesitos codepen and looking at my code, it looks as though if i call it multiple times, i break the carousel. All of the above... but now i'm also getting wierd glitches in modal where css isn't changing when modal is triggered; css remains display:none instead of display:block, so the gray overlay shows up, but no modal. \nand then i can't click 'out' of the gray overlay. \n.

Rails generates the extra input when you use the checkbox helper method. The HTML specification says unchecked checkboxes are not successful, and thus web browsers do not send them to the server, so Rails generates the extra input to get around this.\nUnfortunately when the extra hidden input is placed right next to the other checkbox input it causes the switch not to toggle in IE and Edge. If you still want to be able to get the unchecked value of the checkbox sent to the server all you need to do is move the second hidden input so that it's not next to the normal checkbox input.

I found that the formatter js that I linked up there worked when I created a html page only containing a text box and the script; however, when I import the materialize js (i.e. to use the framework) the formatter doesn't work. It seems something in materialize conflicts; since this is a nice feature anyways, maybe in the next version you could include the formatter in the materialize.js in a way that it doesn't conflict -- I don't know enough Javascript to do this myself (yet).\n. On my site: http://steelcowboy.me/test.html. Notice you can only type numbers and it will auto format to a phone number\n. http://steelcowboy.me/test.php\nI noticed in the log:\n\nUncaught TypeError: $(...).mask is not a function\n\nI tried only importing the materialize.min.js and it still worked, so I'm thinking it's a jQuery conflict\n. I am actually using this I just realized: http://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/\nas I don't think the formatter plugin worked at all\n. Hmmmm, I did. Just removed it though, no effect.\n. Having trouble with id, but to use it with a class:\nhtml\n<p class=\"myToast\">This will work fine!</p>\nAdd this to a <script> block:\njavascript\nvar x = document.getElementsByClassName(\"myToast\")[0].textContent;\nAn example of how you may use it:\nhtml\n<a class=\"btn\" onclick=\"Materialize.toast(x, 4000)\">Toast!</a>\n. So the button turns to \"cancelled\" and then disappears? If you can put the x declaration in between where it changes to \"cancelled\" (x would store \"cancelled\") and before the button disappears, it should work fine. \n. Alright, sorry I', not entirely sure how Meteor works either lol. My thought is you had to specify a function to change the button to cancelled, and then another to make it disappear; if Meteor does that all in one step, however, I see your problem.\nAnd what do you want the toast to say exactly? What's wrong with it being static?\n. Ah, well what I was suggesting was something like:\njavascript\nTemplate.myExampleToast.helpers({\n  canceled: function () {\n    return this.canceled.get()\n    var x = document.getElementsByClassName(\"myToast\")[0].textContent;\n  }\n})\nso that immediately after it sets the button to cancelled it stores the new HTML content as x. Not sure if this is legal in what you want to do, and you said none of the code is working anyway, but something to that extent\n. jQuery already has a plugin for this :) You can either do it with a static, predefined JS array or even build the array from pulling your data from a database via a php backend!\nhttps://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/\n.

I used transparent images inside buttons, but images that do not have transparent backgrounds, the wave effect wont work. so adding a new button that supports images of all types with wave effect but would be nice :+1: \n. try adding anchors to the collapse header divs using id=\" \", for example: \n\n<div id=\"first-topic\" class=\"collapsible-header\"><i class=\"material-icons\">filter_drama</i>First</div>\nand see if the scrollto function will work\n. can you give an example?\n. this would a nice addition\n.

I have got to know from another source as well that the code in my website is not working. Although, the pop ups do open on my computer. Are you using a Mac by any chance?\n. @Arial7 I figured out the issue. I am using Meteor and I had to move the jquery plugin init code within the template's onrendered callback. I am not much familiar with Jade. However, if you have any such callbacks for JAde which gets called post the template has been rendered and ready. Within such callback, you need to place this piece of code:\n$(document).ready(function() {\n        // the \"href\" attribute of .modal-trigger must specify the modal ID that wants to be triggered\n        $('.modal-trigger').leanModal(),\n            $('.button-collapse').sideNav({\n                closeOnClick: true // Closes side-nav on <a> clicks, useful for Angular/Meteor\n            });\n    });\nYou can check my site now @ https://meteorialize-rohanray.c9.io/#!\n.

I am running an older version of materialize, but the current version has the same bug. \nI don't understand how including init.js could solve the problem, because it does not define any mousedown handlers on the optgroup class, which is required to fix the bug. \nClearly the item selection handler should not be on the \"click\" event, because the \"click\" event never gets fired if you don't click fast enough, while the menu always pops down immediately on the mousedown event. \nBoth the menu pop-down and the menu item select handler must trigger on the same type of event (which is mousedown in this case, or is often mouseup in many menus, but never click, because clicks are not always delivered), and the menu item selection handler should always fire even when you click slowly, i.e. press, hold for a while, then release, which doesn't send a click event. \nSo either pop the menu down AND select the item on mousedown, or roll between items on enter/exit while dragging then select the item under the cursor (or do nothing if outside the menu) AND pop down the menu on mouseup like most menus do, but never do each of those things on different events, or either of those things on click events. \nClicks depend on timing, may be dropped, and behave inconsistently and unpredictably across different platforms, browsers and system loads, and often entail a 300ms delay on mobile. \nhttps://gist.github.com/tmcw/4260496\nhttps://www.sitepoint.com/5-ways-prevent-300ms-click-delay-mobile-devices/\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31243959/why-doesnt-click-event-always-fire\nMenus need to be 100% reliable and never ignore user input. \nSilently ignoring slow clicks (for some vague definition of slow that varies widely across platforms and system loads) and press/hold/releases is incorrect, inconsistent, frustrating behavior. \n. I disagree. The current behavior is not correct, and leads to missed menu selections, which is terrible. \nThere is a continuum between clicking and pressing and holding, and the problem is with quick clicks that are not quite quick enough, not just pressing and holding, which is just the extreme case. \nThe most problematic behavior is not with click-and-hold, which is the extreme edge case, but with the much more common gray area between quick click, and a not-quite-quick-enough click. \nIf you press and hold, or click quickly but not quick enough, the menu should not pop down on the \"mousedown\" event, but it does. \nAnd as I explained, the user has very little control or feedback whether they are making a press or a mousedown event, because of the unpredictable timeout of a click, which depends on the platform, and how busy the system is at the time. \nThe effect is that you are DROPPING USER INPUT ON THE FLOOR and IGNORING THE INTENT OF THE USER. That is inexcusable user interface design. \nEither fix the event handler that pops down the menu to respond to the click event, not the mousedown event as it currently incorrectly does, or fix the trigger event to respond to the mouse down event. \nThe point, which I already explained, is that the action of popping the menu down must be on the SAME event as the action for selecting a menu item. Anything else in inconsistent, and makes the menus unreliable, flakey and unusable. \nIt took me a long frustrating time to track down why the menus were not selecting the item I \"clicked\" on. It was because I was not clicking really really fast. I not just pressing and holding. The threshold for determining a \"click\" is way too low, and not under your control, so it is important to properly parse the mouse events consistently so that when the user INTENDS to click, you don't IGNORE the click because it wasn't fast enough. \nYou should re-open this bug. . If you don't understand, then please walk down to Newell-Simon Hall 3517 and ask my colleague (and former boss) Brad Myers to explain transition diagrams, which he touches on in these slides:\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/uicourse/05440inter/lecture10.models.pptx\nor:\nhttp://studylib.net/doc/16057891/formal-models-and-design-spaces-for-interaction-technique...\nAlso see this excellent paper by Bill Buxton which he recommends:\nWilliam Buxton, \"Lexical and Pragmatic Considerations of Input Structures,\" Computer Graphics, January, 1983, (17)1, pp. 31-37.\nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=988586\nhttp://www.billbuxton.com/lexical.html\nYou can also see how many other historical menus track the mouse in Brad's video tape, \"All the Widgets\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qtd8Hc90Hw\nPlease fix your menus to track the same way most other menus track, because the way they currently track the mouse is wrong, and causes much frustration and missed user input. \n. There are two processes going on, and both processes need to be triggered on the same kind of event. One process is showing and hiding the menu. The other process is selecting the menu item. \nIt does not make any sense to talk about comparing the way pop up menus behave with the way regular links behave. Regular links are not like pop up menus. \nWhen you press down on a normal link, no menu pops up, and when you release on a link, no menu pops down. But menus are very different than links. When you pop up a menu, it temporarily shows an element that contains the menu items, and then pops it down at the end of the menu selection. There is an event that pops up the menu itself. In normal menus, this can either be a mousedown event, or a click event. Most normal menus can be popped up by either a mouse down event, or a click. There also an event that pops down the menu. Most normal menus pop the menu down on either the mouse up event if you popped the menu up by pressing and holding, or pressing and dragging, and pop the menu down on a click event (effectively the up event of a down/up pair) if you click the menu up. Most menus can support both modes of operation: clicking them up (press down, release quickly, move while not holding button down, press down, release quickly over menu item (the test if you are over the menu item MUST be made on the position of the up event). Also they must support being clicked up, then the mouse moving without pressing the button, then any combination of: pressing down, waiting any amount of time, possibly moving any amount of distance, and then releasing. \nYou have NO CONTROL over the sequence and timing and position of the mouse events that the user might articulate. You MUST be able to handle all cases correctly without ignoring any events and acting unexpectedly. That means: click up, move, click down. Press down, move, release. Click up, wait, press down, move, release. All sequences of events are possible, and if you will try them with any professional implementation of pop-up menus, you will see that all sequences of events will properly select the intended menu item. \nYour implementation of menus only handles a very restricted subset of the possible events that the user may articulate. \nYour menus do not handle pressing down, dragging and releasing over a menu item to select the item, like normal menus do. \nYour menus do not handle clicking up, moving, pressing down, moving to a different item to reselect a different item, and then releasing over that item to select it.\nThe rule is that the item under the cursor when the button is RELEASED should be selected. If you press down inside a menu item, but then drag the cursor outside of the item, the feedback should properly reflect the fact that the item is selected upon mouse down, and deselected when the cursor rolls out of the item, and any other item you roll into while the button is down should be highlighted. Then when you release the button, if an item is highlighted, it is because the cursor is over it, so it will be selected. Or if no item is highlighted (because you are not over an item), then nothing happens. That is the ONLY case where nothing should happen: when you cursor is NOT over an item.\nHowever, your menus IGNORE the case where the cursor is over an item of the menu while dragging between menu items, and then you release the button, if the time between pressing and releasing is so short that it is classified as a mouse click by the system. That is incorrect. The menu should not ignore the selection if you did not click fast enough, even though you are actually pointing at the item you want to select. No user would ever expect the item the are pointing the cursor at NOT to be selected when they actually saw the highlighting implying that the item they were pointing at was selected, then released the button. Showing a highlight on the item under the cursor is the system's way of telling the users that the item will be selected when they release the button. By not selecting it, you have broken the implied contract with the user, and disappointed their expectations, and the will correctly perceive the menus as unreliable, flakey, and broken. \nHere is a step by step procedure for reproducing the problems with the demo that you have on the web site right now:\nGo to this url on a desktop web browser like Chrome:\nhttp://materializecss.com/forms.html\nScroll down to the \"Select\" section\".\nLook at the select labeled \"Materialize Select\". See the select under it labeled \"Choose your option\" which is underlined and has a down arrow on the right side. \nThat is the select's pop up target area. \nMove the cursor over that area. Position the cursor exactly over the \"Choose your option\" label, so that it is exactly over the \"o\" in \"your\". \nNow PRESS the mouse button down (DO NOT RELEASE), and see that the menu pops up underneath the target area. Now move the cursor downwards. \nNotice that the web browser has gone into text selection mode, and that the \"o\" in \"your\" is selected, followed by all the characters below it, until the text under the current position of the cursor.\nThis is obviously incorrect behavior. Not what the user expects. No user would ever want to actually select the text beginning with the middle of the select label and continuing on to the text of several menu items below it. \nThis problem is because you are popping up the menu on the mousedown event, but not properly canceling text selection, so the system goes into text selection mode, which is wrong. \nIt is obvious that whoever implemented and tested these menus only thought about people ever using them by \"clicking\" them up, and never considered or tested the case that somebody might pop up a menu by pressing and dragging, just like most every professionally implemented menu on desktops like Windows, Mac, and even the ancient menus from the 1980's on various Unix and Xerox PARC systems did as documented in Brad Myers video tape, All The Widgets.\nIf you read any professionally designed user interface guidelines specification, like Apple's, they will document the state machine required to implement the menus, and that will include the ability to handle ALL of the possible edge conditions like this.\nYou can not just ignore all of these edge conditions because YOU not happen to ever pop up menus that way, because you can not control how your users do it, and you must be able to implement menus that are usable by people different than yourselves. People who can click faster. People who can not click as fast. People who press down, and then pause because something in the environment distracts them, and then continue to move the mouse to select from the menu. \nMenu tracking is NOT as easy as it seems on the surface at first glance. You will realize that if you watch All The Widgets, or read a well written user interface tracking specification, or the source code for any well written menu implementation. \nThe problem described above is just one edge case you have not implemented properly, the first one I encountered, and that many of your users will encountered, that results in unexpected flakey and useless behavior. \nTo compare with a normal menu implementation that implements selects correctly, go to this url:\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_select\nYou will see the simple HTML that defines a select on the left, and the select it creates on the right. \nPoint the cursor at the select on the right, and position it over the first \"o\" in \"Volvo\". \nNow press down on the button, and HOLD it. See that the menu pops up. Without releasing the mouse button, move the cursor down. See that it does NOT go into text selection mode. See that the menu item highlighting ALWAYS tracks the position of the cursor while the button is held down, and no matter where you point, and no matter what sequence and position of movement you make, if your cursor is over a menu item, THAT menu item will be selected, and when you move the cursor outside of a menu item, that item will deselect, and if you move the cursor over another item, the select highlighting will change to the other item you pointed to, and if you move the cursor outside of the menu so it is no longer pointing at an item, no item will be selected.\nThe highlighting implies a contract with the user: If the menu item under the cursor is highlighted, then that is the system's way of promising to the user that the item will be selected if they release the mouse button at that point. This is called \"Selection previewing\". The system should always immediately continuously preview what it will do if the user releases the mouse button at any point in time. There should never be a mis-match between the highlighted state, and the behavior, as your menus have a problem with. \nThis is a standard practice in user interface design. All menus do this, except for yours. Your menus lie to the user about what will happen if they release the button, by showing highlighting of the item under the cursor, but NOT selecting that item when they release the button, in some cases, depending on the subtleties of timing, far beyond the user's precision of control. This is simply bad user interface design, an unforced error causing problems that were identified and solved decades ago in other systems. It violates the \"principle of least astonishment\" by astonishing and disappointing the user by IGNORING their input when the EXPECT for it to do what they meant and select the item under the cursor when they release the button. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment\nThe scenario described above of selecting an item from a select menu by pressing, moving and then releasing the button in one \"drag\" gesture is but one of the modes of operation a menu should support, that yours don't. They should also support \"click up\" behavior as well. Both modes are compatible and interchangeable if the menus are properly implemented, which is the case with most system menus on Mac and Windows, and most selects and pop up menus in web browsers. \nIn the \"click up\" scenario, which is what this bug report is actually about, your menus also track incorrectly, as I have already described. I should have originally submitted a more complete bug report that described all the edge cases you don't implement properly like I am doing now, but I was just trying to make them usable and stop ignoring selections, not necessarily behave like other standard menus. But now that I see that you don't understand how normal menus are expected to work, I am explaining exactly how they should in step-by-step detail, and I have given you links to the All The Widgets video that demonstrates how many different historical menu systems work so you can see them in action, as well as links to web pages that you can try in your own browser to see how built-in browser select menus and operating system supported menus work). \nWhen you \"click up\" a menu, the menu will appear on the screen immediately on the \"down\" event of the click, not waiting until the up event that completes the click, because at the time you receive the mousedown event at the start of the click, you have not yet received the mouseup event that completes the click, so you do not know whether or not the user is going to click up the menu, or press and drag through the menu. So NEVER wait until the \"click\" to pop up the menu. Menus should always be popped up on mousedown events, never click events, because there should never be a delay in showing the menu associated with waiting for the up event that completes the click. That would make the user interface appear to be sluggish and unresponsive. \nSo the \"down\" event on the select should ALWAYS immediately pop up the menu. If the following up event arrives in time for a \"click\" event to be generated, then that is fine, because the menu will be already shown on the screen. If the user presses and holds the button, or presses and moves the button, in that case it is necessary to have popped the menu up on the down event, because that is when the user wants to see the menu: immediately, not at the end of a delay.\nTry this with the normal select menu on the last page I linked you to a few times, and you will see how it works. You can always select from the menu by either 1) click it up, move without holding the button down to point at an item, and click it down. 2) click it up, move without holding the button down to point at an item, then press the button down without releasing it, then move the cursor into a DIFFERENT menu item to RESELECT a different item -- you can roll between any number of items while holding the button down and the highlighting will ALWAYS show the selected item under the cursor (or no item if the cursor is not over the menu), and when you release the button, it will ALWAYS select the highlighted menu item under the cursor if any (which is where your menus break down and just ignore user input). And the system will NEVER go into text selection mode, as your menus do. And finally 3) Press the button over the select, then (with or without waiting) move the cursor down into the menu, see how the menu item under the cursor is ALWAYS highlighted and ALWAYS changes to the next item when you move out of one item and into the next, and ALWAYS when you point away from the menu it shows no highlighted item, and then when you release the button over a highlighted item, that item will ALWAYS be selected (which is where your menus incorrectly ignore the user input). \nMenus should NEVER show highlighting that implies they will select an item when the user releases the button, but then break that promise by ignoring the button release event. That is the main problem that I was reporting with this bug report, but as you can see, there are a whole lot of other problems with the mouse input event tracking state machine that you have effectively implemented. \nI realize that you are not using formal programming methods such as an actual state machine, and instead you are just implementing an informal effective virtual state machine by defining several different event callbacks with jquery. The problem with the state machine that you have implemented is that it does NOT take into account the many possibilities that users expect it to handle, and that all other professionally implemented standard system desktop and application menus implement. \nOne way of explaining it that I attempted was that the event that pops down your menus is the mouse up event, while the event that triggers your menu item is the click event. But the mouse down event comes BEFORE the click event is fully recognized, because the system has to wait a certain amount of time to see if there is a mouse up event soon enough after the mouse down event. But the system sends the mousedown event immediately, and you have implemented a mousedown handler that immediately pops down the menu, without waiting to see if there is a click event that activates the selected menu item. \nThe act of popping down the menu immediately on the mouse down event without waiting for the corresponding mouse up event that triggers the menu item causes the \"click\" event that you're waiting for to trigger the menu item to be CANCELED. It is never delivered. The menu item that was highlighted under the cursor that you pointed at is never triggered. Because by the time the click event comes along, the menu is no longer on the screen. \nThe problem is that you can't reliably combine \"click\" tracking with \"mousedown\"/\"mouseup\" tracking in that way. It results in flakey unreliable menus, as we have here. \nNow I will walk you through the problem I am describing with your menus again. Go to this page:\nhttp://materializecss.com/forms.html\nScroll down to the \"Select\" section\".\nLook at the select labeled \"Materialize Select\". See the select under it labeled \"Choose your option\" which is underlined and has a down arrow on the right side. \nThat is the select's pop up target area. \nMove the cursor over that area. Position the cursor exactly over the \"Choose your option\" label, so that it is exactly over the \"o\" in \"your\". \nNow CLICK up the menu, by pressing and releasing the mouse button quickly, without moving the mouse.\nYou will see that the menu pops up by animating. Now you are still pointing the mouse button at the same place, but the pop-up menu is positioned over the select target, with the same header label \"Choose your option\" displayed in about the same place (a few pixels off) in a gray color, and the menu items below it. The menu header label is not selectable, which is ok. When you move the cursor down into the first menu item \"Option 1\" without clicking the button yet, that item is highlighted. See how you can move the cursor between active menu items, and the menu item under the cursor will always be highlighted, and when you move outside of the menu, no items are highlighted. The system has not gone into text selection mode. So far, so good. \nNow there are two ways in which this menu tracking can go wrong, and first I will describe one, then the other. Menus must be able to properly handle all of these cases without ignoring user input or going into text selection mode, not just a subset. \nHere is one obvious failure case you can trigger after clicking up a menu: point at the \"Option 1\" item, then click the button slowly (not as slow as a \"press and hold\", but not so quickly that the system interprets it as a click). Try it again and again, each time clicking for a little longer. When you click really fast, the item is selected. Now try selecting a different item next, so you can be sure if the menu selection was actually changed. Try clicking slightly slower. Some times the new menu item will be selected. Sometimes it won't. That depends on how fast you clicked. The difference between clicking fast enough and not clicking fast enough is very tiny, extremely hard for you to accurately measure with normal human perception. If you were to video tape the action and play it back frame by frame, you would be able to measure what the click threshold was, but that is IMPOSSIBLE for a human being to do, and it is terrible for a user interface to have such a fine hair triggered ambiguity between triggering a menu item and not triggering a menu item. That kind of behavior is perceived by users as flakeyness and unreliability. If you tried to summon an elevator by pressing the button, but the button ignored you if you didn't press quickly enough, you would think the elevator was broken. Elevators don't have signs telling people to quickly press the button instead of pressing and holding it, or specifying that it is necessary to press and release the button in under 200 millisecond or whatever the system defined timeout is. And users have no way of reliably articulating a 199 millisecond press versus a 201 millisecond press, or perceiving the difference. A press is a press. Whether it's slow or fast should never make a difference. Sleepy senior citizens with slow reflexes must be able to use the interface, just as well as teenagers with quick reflexes and lots of energy. But your menus make a hair-triggered distinction between clicking \"quickly\" and clicking \"slowly\". And they totally don't support pressing and dragging, or pressing, holding the button down while looking at the screen and waiting to see the menu pop up before deciding where to point next, or any of many common ways of using menus that are universally supported and expected to work across all platforms. \nOne more time, this time making the click even slower so it's like a \"press and hold\". The timeout of a \"press and hold\" event is much longer than a click event, so this is an extreme edge case that will ALWAYS demonstrate what is wrong about your menu tracking, by ALWAYS ignoring the user input. Point at the select label, then press and hold the button, and wait one second while the menu animates up. Now, while continuing to hold the button down, move the cursor downwards towards the \"Option 1\". Notice how the system has gone into text selection mode, and the text between the menu label you clicked on, and the menu item under the cursor, is highlighted to show you that it will select that text when you release the button. CLEARLY this is incorrect behavior. The user NEVER wants to select the menu labels. Proper menus should always lock out text selection by canceling the down event so it does not bubble up to the page and initiate a text selection gesture. That means you HAVE to handle the down event, not the click event, because you can't cancel text selection in a click event, because by the time it happens it is too late, and you never even get a click event if there is enough time after the down event. \nAnd here is another case that your menus handle incorrectly: dismiss the menu if it's already popped up. Now point at the select label that says \"Choose your option\". Now click quickly or slowly, it does not matter, to pop up the menu. Now move down to point to an option (make sure it's not the last option you select, so you will be able to see if the selection changed or not). Now click slowly (not so slow as a \"press and hold\", but slow enough that the system does not interpret it as a click). You will notice that your menu pops down IMMEDIATELY on the down event that begins the click event. And then when the click event finally comes along, it happens after the menu is already popped down, but it is ignored. If you put debugging log statements in your code, like I did when diagnosing this problem, you will see that THE CLICK HANDLER IS NEVER CALLED, although the mousedown handler that pops down the menus is obviously called (which you can tell without a log statement because the menu pops down, but you should put a log statement in there anywhere to prove it to yourself). This is exactly the case that this bug report was describing, although it's only the tip of the iceberg. \nI don't know how much more detailed an explanation I can give you, to convince you that there really is a problem with the way your menus are tracking, that causes horrible usability problems, and violates the principle of least astonishment, and frustrates users, and makes your menus flakey and unreliable. I would never publish a web site that used such flakey menus, and I was horrified to discover this problem right before launching my own web site. But as this bug report shows, I was able to come up with a simple patch that at least prevented the flakey behavior, if actually implementing the full normal expected behavior for all cases, and never accidentally went into text selection mode as I have described.\nThese menus really need their input tracking code to be totally overhauled by someone who pays close attention and is aware of all the possible edge cases and sequences of events that might happen. Otherwise they will never be a viable alternative the the browser's build-in select menus.\nIt's not enough to make a flashy shallow demo that looks great in a screencast but can't stand up against normal users in the real word. Since your Materialize select menus automatically and globally replace all the normal browser select menus unless the designer opts out, you can't require users to always click quickly and never drag otherwise you silently ignore their input or go into text selection mode, because the normal menus you're replacing don't behave that way. \nIt's your job as a user interface developer to adapt to how your users actually behave, and not demand they change their deeply ingrained behaviors for one little web site, or spontaneously develop superhuman precise pointing and rapid clicking abilities. \nIf you still really don't believe there is a problem, and that the current implementation is fine, or your eyes glaze over at my level of detail, then please sit down and have a talk with Brad Meyers. He is a professor and user interface researcher at CMU, who has worked there for decades, who I used to work with on Garnet, who has published many papers and video tape demos about user interface input tracking, and who has implemented many user interface menus and input tracking state machines himself. He understands how complex and nuanced these issues actually are, even though they may appear simple and trivial on the surface. \nHis web page is:\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam\nHis office is in Newell-Simon Hall 3517.\nBrad and I will also refer you to the work of Bill Buxton, specifically his paper \"Lexical and Pragmatic Considerations of Input Structures,\" Computer Graphics, January, 1983, (17)1, pp. 31-37.\nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=988586\nhttp://www.billbuxton.com/lexical.html\nBrad produced the \"All the Widgets\" video tape in 1990 for the ACM CHI 1990 conference in Seattle, for the express purpose of documenting standard practices and showing historical user interface techniques, so people like you don't have to repeatedly re-invent the wheel again and again without realizing all the nuances and edge cases you are expected to handle. So I am sure he will be thrilled to help you and give you more citations and examples. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qtd8Hc90Hw\nThis was made in 1990, sponsored by the ACM CHI 1990 conference, to tell the history of widgets up until then.

ISBN 0-89791-930-0.\n. If you still don't understand what the problem is, I will make a screencast that demonstrates it. Is this explanation that I have given you so far detailed and explicit enough, or should I made a screencast demonstrating the problem? . I am attempting to fix some of these bugs I have reported, but I am finding many problems about the code that could not possibly have been intentional, and cause unfortunate unintended consequences and inefficiencies. \nFirst of all, pressing the button down and dragging should NEVER go into text selection mode.\nIt is incorrect to for the handler to catch \"click\" events instead of \"mousedown\" events, because then it passes mousedown events if you click slowly or just hold the mouse down. In general, you should never handle \"click\" in this situation, because you miss the common case of slow clicks, and of pressing down and moving with the button down, which normal selects properly handle, but materialize selects do not properly handle, because they go into text selection mode. \nThe obvious fix for that problem is to modify the \"click\" handler of the $newSelect element to actually handle \"mousedown\" instead of \"click\", and then to cancel the default behavior which is to start a selection. But then it also has to manually invoke a focus, because you are depending on the default behavior of the mouse down to set the focus (click does not set focus, mousedown sets focus, but you were improperly handling click, and just stopping the propagation, but not canceling the default behavior). \nThe old incorrect code was:\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/76a6ee49dff4049e8bcbac6d05f886b3da521a60/js/forms.js#L612\n    'click': function (e){\n      e.stopPropagation();\n    }\n\nThe correct code should be:\n    'mousedown': function (e) {\n      e.stopPropagation();\n      e.preventDefault();\n      e.target.focus();\n    }\n\nThe stopPropagation prevents the event from bubbling up to the container.\nThe preventDefault prevents the text selection mode from being started if you move the mouse before releasing the button, but it also prevents the element from being focused.\nthe focus manually focuses on the element, which causes the dropdown to be shown.\nUnfortunately this only partially fixes the problem. Properly implemented dropdowns, like the browser default dropdowns, should hide when you click on the label again after clicking them up. But your original implementation and this fix is not able to do that: it just keeps the menu up after you click again and again in the label. That is incorrect behavior, which you can verify by experimenting with any default browser select. If you are going to replace the default browser selects, you should be as compatible with the way they track as possible, because there is a very good reason they track that way, and users expect them to work that way, so you should not disappoint them by implementing non-standard behaviors. \nMore work needs to be done in order to properly track the mouse so that the menus are shown and hidden at the proper time, in response to mouse up and down events, instead of tracking \"click\" events which are dependent on the duration of the click. If you will try using normal browser selects, you will find that at no time is their behavior dependent on the speed that you click: they trigger on mouse down and up events, not click events. \nThe mechanism for hiding the dropdowns from the screen when the user clicks is broken and very inefficient. You are handling a click event on the window, which is called for EACH DROPDOWN, and is called EVERY TIME the user clicks ANYWHERE on the page, no matter if the dropdown is hidden or not. So you are needlessly executing a lot of code every time the user clicks anywhere on the screen, and it makes it very difficult to implement the logic required to properly dismiss the dropdown under the right circumstances by tracking mouse up and down events, instead of clicks. Here is the broken code that is called far too frequently, for every click on the page, times every select on the page:\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/76a6ee49dff4049e8bcbac6d05f886b3da521a60/js/forms.js#L630\n  $(window).on({\n    'click': function () {\n      multiple && (optionsHover || $newSelect.trigger('close'));\n    }\n  });\n\nYou should NEVER use $(window).on unless you really mean for EVERY select to ALWAYS handle that event no matter if it's shown or not. And you should not be tracking the \"click\" event, because that is time sensitive: instead you should be tracking both the \"mousedown\" and the \"mouseup\" events, but ONLY while that particular dropdown is shown, not all the time, and not for every dropdown. \nIn a properly implemented select like the built-in browser selects, if the \"mousedown\" event is not over the dropdown, it dismisses the menu AND stops tracking both the mousedown and mouseup event on the window. You should only ever have one handler for mousedown and mouseup active on the window at a time, and only while a dropdown is tracking. Never leave that handler active, or else it will be called all the time, and cause a lot of inefficiency and slow down ALL event tracking on the page. \nYou will see that normal built-in browser selects work this way: click one up, then move outside of the select and the label, then press the button down but don't release it. You will see that it hides the dropdown on that mousedown event. BUT if you press and HOLD the mouse down over a menu item while the dropdown is shown, you will see that it does NOT hide the dropdown, but it keeps tracking until you RELEASE the button. Then when the button is finally released, if it is over an item, then the item is selected and the dropdown is hidden. But if it is not over an item, no item is selected and the dropdown is hidden. \nMore work still needs to be done to bring your materialize selects in line with the standard way all other normal selects work, but getting rid of \"click\" handlers, triggering on the correct mousedown and mouseup events, and preventing the browser from entering text selection mode are but the first few steps. My next step is to try to get rid of your global window click handlers, which are inefficient and make it difficult to track mouse up and down events properly to hide the dropdown at the correct time.\n. I am attempting to fix some of these bugs I have reported, but I am finding many problems about the code that could not possibly have been intentional, and cause unfortunate unintended consequences and inefficiencies. \nFirst of all, pressing the button down and dragging should NEVER go into text selection mode.\nIt is incorrect to for the handler to catch \"click\" events instead of \"mousedown\" events, because then it passes mousedown events if you click slowly or just hold the mouse down. In general, you should never handle \"click\" in this situation, because you miss the common case of slow clicks, and of pressing down and moving with the button down, which normal selects properly handle, but materialize selects do not properly handle, because they go into text selection mode. \nThe obvious fix for that problem is to modify the \"click\" handler of the $newSelect element to actually handle \"mousedown\" instead of \"click\", and then to cancel the default behavior which is to start a selection. But then it also has to manually invoke a focus, because you are depending on the default behavior of the mouse down to set the focus (click does not set focus, mousedown sets focus, but you were improperly handling click, and just stopping the propagation, but not canceling the default behavior). \nThe old incorrect code was:\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/76a6ee49dff4049e8bcbac6d05f886b3da521a60/js/forms.js#L612\n    'click': function (e){\n      e.stopPropagation();\n    }\n\nThe correct code should be:\n    'mousedown': function (e) {\n      e.stopPropagation();\n      e.preventDefault();\n      e.target.focus();\n    }\n\nThe stopPropagation prevents the event from bubbling up to the container.\nThe preventDefault prevents the text selection mode from being started if you move the mouse before releasing the button, but it also prevents the element from being focused.\nthe focus manually focuses on the element, which causes the dropdown to be shown.\nUnfortunately this only partially fixes the problem. Properly implemented dropdowns, like the browser default dropdowns, should hide when you click on the label again after clicking them up. But your original implementation and this fix is not able to do that: it just keeps the menu up after you click again and again in the label. That is incorrect behavior, which you can verify by experimenting with any default browser select. If you are going to replace the default browser selects, you should be as compatible with the way they track as possible, because there is a very good reason they track that way, and users expect them to work that way, so you should not disappoint them by implementing non-standard behaviors. \nMore work needs to be done in order to properly track the mouse so that the menus are shown and hidden at the proper time, in response to mouse up and down events, instead of tracking \"click\" events which are dependent on the duration of the click. If you will try using normal browser selects, you will find that at no time is their behavior dependent on the speed that you click: they trigger on mouse down and up events, not click events. \nThe mechanism for hiding the dropdowns from the screen when the user clicks is broken and very inefficient. You are handling a click event on the window, which is called for EACH DROPDOWN, and is called EVERY TIME the user clicks ANYWHERE on the page, no matter if the dropdown is hidden or not. So you are needlessly executing a lot of code every time the user clicks anywhere on the screen, and it makes it very difficult to implement the logic required to properly dismiss the dropdown under the right circumstances by tracking mouse up and down events, instead of clicks. Here is the broken code that is called far too frequently, for every click on the page, times every select on the page:\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/76a6ee49dff4049e8bcbac6d05f886b3da521a60/js/forms.js#L630\n  $(window).on({\n    'click': function () {\n      multiple && (optionsHover || $newSelect.trigger('close'));\n    }\n  });\n\nYou should NEVER use $(window).on unless you really mean for EVERY select to ALWAYS handle that event no matter if it's shown or not. And you should not be tracking the \"click\" event, because that is time sensitive: instead you should be tracking both the \"mousedown\" and the \"mouseup\" events, but ONLY while that particular dropdown is shown, not all the time, and not for every dropdown. \nIn a properly implemented select like the built-in browser selects, if the \"mousedown\" event is not over the dropdown, it dismisses the menu AND stops tracking both the mousedown and mouseup event on the window. You should only ever have one handler for mousedown and mouseup active on the window at a time, and only while a dropdown is tracking. Never leave that handler active, or else it will be called all the time, and cause a lot of inefficiency and slow down ALL event tracking on the page. \nYou will see that normal built-in browser selects work this way: click one up, then move outside of the select and the label, then press the button down but don't release it.

BUT if you press and HOLD the mouse down over a menu item while the dropdown is shown, you will see that it does NOT hide the dropdown, but it keeps tracking until you RELEASE the button. Then when the button is finally released, if it is over an item, then the item is selected and the dropdown is hidden. But if it is not over an item, no item is selected and the dropdown is hidden. \nMore work still needs to be done to bring your materialize selects in line with the standard way all other normal selects work, but getting rid of \"click\" handlers, triggering on the correct mousedown and mouseup events, and preventing the browser from entering text selection mode are but the first few steps.

It only works with ul/li now, but there's no reason to keep forcing that instead of working with classes.. The buttons in the screenshots look fine, and a quick look to compare with the official documention (http://next.materializecss.com/buttons.html) should be enough.. What do you mean by reinit?. Solution for me in PR #5627 . Yes, if you look at my PR, I did at a callback onDragStart.. touchstart is not the same as starting to drag, and it's an element managed by materialize.. And what happens if you have two sets of tabs on your page?\nI'm not sure this is a good idea. Optionally at best.. No problem for me, but imho a new alpha with renamed select would be a good idea.. Until it is supported, create a picker per script and move the elements wherever you want them to be. Related to this: an option to use browser-default selects for month and year selector would be nice.. Is that a no to the browser-default or a maybe later, but not in the bugfix?. I thought v1 doesn't need jquery anymore?. Btw: is there a reason that each li in the dropdown has its own click-handler instead of just 1 with a delegate?. @soryy708 And if the maintainers show interest in this I'll fix them.. They should also have colored labels.\nSee https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons.html#buttons-flat-buttons. Does not work inside a \"div\" with class \"input-field\" also sounds like a bug to me.. Why not leave it open as feature request for post 1.0?. I'd agree if it wasn't webkit only.. Better ask for options to adjust the styling of the current picker I think.\nNo need to get another lib.... Don't use zoom, use transform with scale.. Don't use zoom, use transform with scale..

    "Ecksters": "The docs would get quite large if every little possible change you potentially could do were added to them, although maybe a sort of wiki page or something for these kinds of things would be nice in the future, to at least have a central source for this little stuff while keeping the main docs clean.\nAlso, Roboto is used because it is the font of choice for Material design:\nhttp://www.google.com/design/spec/style/typography.html\nAnd I'm not going to argue with Google's design choices, it's pretty attractive looking IMO.\n. Using a smooth scroll plugin I was able to get it smooth, but then it got super laggy on Android devices, would love to see this issue addressed.\n. Are the translations even contained in the repository? I went to fix this and couldn't find translations anywhere. I speak Portuguese and would love to finish off the translation for it.\n. Considering Vista has only 2% of the market (and decreasing), and of that 2% it's likely most of them are using Firefox or Chrome, I think it'd be best to not bother with it.\nI'm happy that Materialize's mixins file is only one mixin long.\n. The WIndows 7 side of that(40% of the market vs. Vista's <2%) will drop substantially when Windows 10 comes out. Still, I suppose it's worth looking at making it function, I wouldn't worry about making it pretty though.\n. Agreed with above, specifically because Material design doesn't really need to do anything special for code formatting, I feel like that's the point of this framework, Material design implemented everywhere for you, and that's not really an issue with code formatting.\n. Here's just a look at what I'm thinking of.\n\n\n. @acburst Yeah, that was something I was a bit afraid of, I don't want to clutter up the main scss code with theme, the only reason I thought it would possibly be okay is because Material design specifically shows dark and light themes, while adding colors appears to be intended for simply accenting, not as a main color scheme. This is actually why I haven't continued making more commits, since I assumed this wasn't an ideal implementation strategy in the long-run.\nWould love to see an example of implementing a full theme redo, because the current SCSS makes a lot of assumptions that the background will be white, so some major changes would need to be made for the variables.scss file to support full theme changes.\n. Well, the main dilemma with that is that keeping that template up-to-date with future changes would be extremely difficult, since various scattered portions of the scss need to be modified to achieve the dark look. Like I said, the current implementation assumes a light-colored background in many locations in the code. I think that would need to be corrected before it'd be worth putting much effort into a full dark theme. :tired_face: \n. Yes, it should probably be closed as it requires major changes to the framework to add dark theme support.\n. Okay, maybe it's something I can look into adding\n. Just responding for now, but the test would simply consist of a div with z-index of 5, with the materialbox'd image inside of it. Because the div has a z-index of 5, the image, even when its z-index is set to 5000(or whatever it is), will never be larger than 5(the parent's z-index), so the overlay, which has an index of 999, will simply cover it up.\nEDIT: Weird, I can't seem to replicate it in a CodePen outside my project..

As far as shadows go I got the z-depth-0 part, my real issue with this is that there should be no default shadows. The user should have to set the shadows they want rather than having to unset shadows on everything. It's all good I'm not using this anyways for the reasons stated in my last comment. The framework that I ended up writing basically just divides all of the settings into the \"do one thing and do that thing well\" diatribe, so my html seems like its full of classes but 1). you can see by looking at the markup what each setting applied to that element is, and 2). there are no defaults for anything. Everything gets set by the user, which is a lot easier than unsetting all of the defaults to be able to customize.\n. ",

However, this doesn't take anything away from their great work.\n. @patrickcfantato as I said in my original post, modifying the source code wasn't a viable option, so I came up with this wild function (which was working just fine surprisingly:)) before your suggestion :))) :\njavascript\nvar forms = document.getElementsByTagName('form');\nfor (var i = forms.length; i--;)\n   forms[i].addEventListener('reset', handleFormReset.bind(this), false);\nvar counter = 0;\nvar defaultValues = null;\nvar timer;\nfunction handleFormReset(el) {\n    timer = setTimeout(handleFormReset, 10);\n    if (defaultValues === null)\n        defaultValues = el.currentTarget.getElementsByTagName('input');\n    for (var i = defaultValues.length; i--;) {\n        if (defaultValues[i].type === 'text' && defaultValues[i].value !== '') {\n            for (var j = defaultValues[i].parentNode.children.length; j--;) {\n                if (defaultValues[i].parentNode.children[j].tagName.toLowerCase() === 'label')\n                    defaultValues[i].parentNode.children[j].classList.add('active');\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (counter > 0) {\n        clearTimeout(timer);\n        counter = 0;\n        defaultValues = null;\n    }\n    else\n        counter++;\n}\nbut then it just became:\njavascript\nvar forms = document.getElementsByTagName('form');\nfor (var i = forms.length; i--;)\n    forms[i].addEventListener('reset', handleFormReset.bind(), false);\nfunction handleFormReset() {\n    Materialize.updateTextFields();\n}\nThank you again!!!\n. awesome!

It helps resolving many issues and style conflicts caused by CSS being a multitude of global variables.\nGeneral principle is a modular approach:\n- Use unique block names to avoid conflicts with other styles in the page (both other libraries' and the user's own styles).\n- Apply styles to classes only. No tag or identifier styling allowed. Users must structure the markup and add classes accordingly.\nBasic example (.mat- being the library prefix that makes it somewhat unique amongst other libraries; better make it configurable in SASS bindings):\n.mat-searchbox { /* (Block) searchbox styles */ }\n.mat-searchbox__search-button { /* (Element) searchbox search button styling */ }\n.mat-searchbox--rounded { /* (Modifier) rounded searchbox additional styling */ }\nPlease read more at bem.info and on the Internet.\nRelated: #949, #936.\n. Resetting CSS rules is a bad practice that leads to making software that is\nhard to maintain.\nThe practices of isolation and modularity are proven to solve conflicts in\nlarge applications.\nIf you make a simple web page, you could be confused why you would need\nsuch seemingly complex separation and longer class names over seemingly\nsimpler styling and shorter class names.\nUnless Materialize targets only developers that make simple webpages, it\nshould allow the ones that make something bigger to use the future-proof\npractices for structure, scalability and maintainability.\n\n[image: :-1:]\nAs someone who likes this library for its ease of use in css this would\ncause a bunch of ugly html code.\nespecially because it does do tag styling.\nAs an alternative solution why not add a class that then cancels every\nstyle used by this library.\nex\nStyled by materialize\nNot style by materialize\nwhere in its css it has the below for every style rule.\nh1:not(.not-material)  {\n...\n}\nThis is just as much work as requiring a class for every element that needs styling but is also allows the library to remain approachable.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/1303#issuecomment-104966724\n.\n. \n",

Things like inputs, badges, or tags in table cells can cause all sorts of alignment issues that need special rules and I've had to figure those out as I go. Those become especially troublesome if you use check boxes for selection and then use the responsive-table class.\nI'd prefer having all the CSS written upfront and documented to support those basic uses like sorting and row selection. If the CSS is available, the materialize team can decide to focus on a JS implementation of tables or leave it for now. If the styles are all available to abide by, the users can determine if a plugin library is warranted in their use case, as raw html will sometimes be all that is required and a JS library is overkill. It wouldn't be a monolithic undertaking to write a JS library, jQuery Plugin, or use any of the big frameworks to take advantage of those classes once they've been introduced.. ",

This has mostly worked well, I've overridden some things myself where needed. However the picker dropdowns are giving me issues. \nWhen you click on the datepicker it immediately appends the month/year lists to the body, then when I click on the months/year in the picker, well it just breaks essentially. \n@DanielRuf sorry, you seemed active on the project so I was hoping you could take a look but if you can't that's fine. Thank you. . onDraw: function() {\n                $(\"body > ul.select-dropdown\")\n                    .detach()\n                    .appendTo(\"#datepicker-container\");\n            }\nThis worked. .

The logic was changed again in 30b2e1d525c5c4a721c9c84f2e33524831331e9a.

This version of JQuery no longer seems to set JQuery.easing.def to easeOutQuad by default, thus there will be an undefined error. \nI solved this by forcing materialize to use JQuery 2.1.1 in the following way:\n<!--Import jQuery before materialize.js-->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> \n     $materialize = jQuery.noConflict(true); \n</script>\nInside materialize.js:\nif (typeof(jQuery) === 'undefined') {\n  var jQuery;\n  // Check if require is a defined function.\n  if (typeof(require) === 'function') {\n    jQuery = $materialize = require('jQuery');\n  // Else use the dollar sign alias.\n  } else {\n    jQuery = $materialize;\n  }\n};\nHowever now it is no longer possible to use the CDN version and to update without making changes to the materialize file. People working on the project after me will likely run into issues with the way I am currently solving it.\nIt would be great to get an official statement from @Dogfalo on how you should use materialize while you you have external modules which are using other versions of JQuery. (I don't have access to those extrernal modules)\nEDIT: This did not actually end up solving the issue for me, since the external dependency also loads JQuery using Java. When this happened, JQuery was again being replaced with the newer version 2.1.3: thus also the word JQuery inside Materialize gets replaced by version 2.1.3, instead of staying 2.1.1. \nThe context gets lost and JQuery.easing.def becomes undefined. I was able to solve this by putting the whole easing plugin inside of the following tags: \n(function($, undefined) {\n<easing plugin here>\n}) (jQuery);\nand replacing the word JQuery with $ in the easing plugin code.\n(as suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11533168/jquery-easingjquery-easing-def-is-not-a-function)\nWould be great to see how this could be standardized though, so that me and others can keep using the standard version of materialize. \n.

On mobile it should appear at the bottom of the screen and it does out of the box.\nBut on desktop it simply makes no sense if I have for example a frame structure where some advertisement is on the right side and the toast appears as an overlay above the advertisement instead at where the action was triggered.

Thanks Lukas, I do agree that the toast should appear also on desktop & tablet at the bottom. I ended up in harmonize the toast so it looks equal on desktop, tablet and mobile (fullscreen, bottom). I think it would make sense to change the default behavior of the toast in desktop and tablet format like @liesislukas described it. Currently it appears in the top right corner of the screen. For anyone who likes to also change the default behavior of desktop and tablet toasts, that's what you have to overwrite in your css (play arround with the values):\n@media only screen and (min-width : 601px) and (max-width : 1260px) {\n    .toast {\n      width: 100%;\n      border-radius: 0;} }\n@media only screen and (min-width : 1261px) {\n    .toast {\n      width: 100%;\n      border-radius: 0; } }\n@media only screen and (min-width : 601px) and (max-width : 1260px) {\n    #toast-container {\n      min-width: 100%;\n      bottom: 0%;\n      top: 90%;\n      right: 0%;\n      left: 0%;} }\n@media only screen and (min-width : 1261px) {\n    #toast-container {\n      min-width: 100%;\n      bottom: 0%;\n      top: 90%;\n      right: 0%;\n      left: 0%; } }\n.

This piece of code perfectly solved this issue. We already used this in our product. I am not going to resubmit my code and hope the code to be merged.\n. @samudranb I know it's a pain. So in our project I folked the Materializecss and applied the changes. Then I have my own  gruntfile.js to build the js file.  In this way there is no conflict but every time you update the Materializecss package, you need to run your own gruntfile.js to generate the file.\nFor your gruntfile, you can simply copy https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/Gruntfile.js and change the leanModel.js route to yours.\n.

The fix should be a bit more complex.\n\nAssuming input is empty, you need to differentiate two states:\n1. no focus:\n   A. label follows default Materialize behavior\n   B. data-error translated by 14% (as your solution suggests)\n2. focus:\n   A. label follows default Materialize behavior\n   B. data-error falls back to default Materialize style \nThe solution should only modify 1.B.\n. Same thing here :) I don't have much time to work on fixing these bugs ^^ I hope they'll find a solution soon :)\n. @marcl2020 have you tried adding !important to the fix ? Not sure why it isn't working for you :/ Thanks for providing a fix :) I will try it at work today and update my initial post in case it works for me as well :) Which browser are you trying this on (so I can reproduce) ?\n@derixithy I'll git it a try if I get some time at work today :) I might just try to find the right fix :)\nAnyone has an idea on the date picker errors not showing ? That's the strangest one to me :/\n. @marci2020 Your solution works for me ! I also noticed a bug cause by my solution: it breaks the width of input[type=search]. The corresponding label has a padding, therefore its outer width is 100% + padding, which exceeds the width of the div, creating an x scroll... So I'll change my solution to yours in my original post. Thanks for providing it !\n. @marci2020 That works gracefully ! I'll update the list. However, I am not a fan of such solutions as I believe that it adds unnecessary tags to the page, that becomes unreadable, although I agree that your solution follows the philosophy of the Materialize framework :)\nActually, in my current pages, .input-fields elements all have the colclass, but not all of them are inside a row. This is intentional, though I know it is not \"semantically\" correct.\n. @marci2020 what is your Chrome version ? (so I can update correctly).\n. @marci2020 Thanks, updated :)\n.

    "maxverro": "IMO, all these work around solutions are fine and do actually work. Although I would suggest a different approach. I use this framework within different .NET MVC application. Having a required Attribute is a common thing. Therefore, when returning a view, as mentioned before, if the input has no focus the data-error is misplaced. So here is what I suggest, we could use an extra markup to serve as the container for the validation error message. Basically, adding a span below the input to hold the text is a clean plain html solution and will most likely be more compatible with other web framework (ie MVC uses unobstructive JavaScript which normally display the error in a span below the field. The span will automatically fill 100% of the width and should use display:block.\nPeople who download the source could easily modify the class name applied to the span to match their need (ie: Again, for a MVC user, the class name could be changed for the one used with unobstuctive JavaScript to match existing or custom JavaScript selectors.\nPseudo element are great in general. Although, I am not a great fan of the approach used to display validation errors.\n. ",
    "ben-sykes": "6 ~~and 7~~ are still issues. Has there been any response from the creators?\nEdit: Workaround for 7 (working in Chrome 52.0.2743.116).\nFor some reason (haven't dug that deep), but it still thinks the datepicker input is the active element on the page, so when the window regains focus, it displays the datepicker. (This can be proven out by interacting with anything else on the page, then switching tabs the same way as originally described by OP). Not sure if this is the most efficient way to handle this, but it works.\nJust add the following to the onClose() option:\njavascript\n$('.datepicker').pickadate({\n    onClose: function () {\n        $(document.activeElement).blur();\n    }\n});\n. I agree that this is an issue.\nAt the very least, if the auto-resize must remain without option to turn it off, should there be some way of indicating that there is a lot of text in the text area? (maybe that's a better way to approach this issue?)\n. I believe the interaction you're experiencing is related to the touch compatibility. Click slower an be more precise when clicking on the dots. Everything seems to work as expected. If you misclick (between the dots) the touch/sliding functionality seems to mess with things. It almost seems like there should be a \"no-drag\" block behind the clickable dots.\n@anvart : Does this analysis seem to make sense with what you're experiencing?. While what you're proposing isn't necessarily incorrect, I believe text alignment should be application specific. What you consider \"ugly\" is largely due to the default text-alignment not working with your application's overall design. For a different application, with its own design, your proposed change may make that one \"ugly\". For example, what if you need to consider LTR vs RTL languages? Your change could throw everything off. \nI disagree that this should be part of the library, although your snippet would fit in nicely with other site-specific overrides to the materialize library..

I was using the ones from https://materialdesignicons.com/ since they include many more (community contributed) icons, which I would like to use.

The latest materialize code (869f10bb00659cb2021440d48df2515220096c3f) seems to have resolved the problem I saw: https://output.jsbin.com/nivapom. @DetlefPeters if you're referring to the else if that was in here then that was part of the 741d47... fix mentioned above. Perhaps you mistakenly pulled the old dist files instead of rebuilding with grunt release?. @DetlefPeters that sounds like it'll work. Alternatively, you can create a fork, generate the dist files, and install that via bower using URL instead of package name, e.g. bower install https://github.com/org/repo.git#master. P.S. although it's a separate discussion, you may want to consider starting to migrate away from bower. See https://www.quora.com/Is-Bower-dying. Would this issue be resolved if materialize was always lowercase? If so, then this may be a duplicate of\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2389\nand should be fixed by this PR\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/3087\n. OK...It seems like in your examples (like this one) you use code like <i class=\"material-icons\">name</i> but if I use the other I think I need to do something like <i class=\"mdi mdi-name\"></i>. Are you saying that Materialize itself does not contain any code depending on this format? (i.e. the examples just show one possible choice of icon integration)\n. @Dogfalo Are there currently any plans to support display: grid in future versions of materialize? I find it to be much more ergonomic than prior layout techniques, the standard seems to be stabilizing, and there appears to be widespread support in browsers.\n(I guess I'm effectively asking if enough time has passed since #5091). @Dogfalo this is a pretty severe issue for me. Is there a fix planned? If not, would you accept a PR?. I am using Linux & will check if screen size matters when I get an opportunity.\n. Fair enough, though mine was first ;). @Dogfalo it appears to still be broken in v1.0-alpha.3, is that expected? Here is a codepen\n\n. @fega Could we please re-open this since it is evidently not actually fixed?. The problem isn't needing a trigger to refer to more than 1 element, it's that when using component templates it is inconvenient to need to generate unique IDs in the DOM. . Note that it appears to work OK when using jQuery 3.1.1 and removing jQuery UI (.sortable())\nSee http://jsbin.com/yigadu/3. @aminnairi While the idea of being able to easily integrate things is great, the problem is that when there is overlap of functionality between tools they can conflict with each other. CSS integration tends to be pretty straight-forward, but JS can get messy quickly.\nFor example, Materialize's drop-down / select control actually wraps the <select> element with other mark-up and binds event handlers to them. If some other piece of code then removes those elements from the DOM and adds them back then there are suddenly 2 problems: (1) the new element doesn't have the necessary handlers bound to it and (2) the old handlers may not have been removed before the element was removed, causing a memory leak.\nIf you really want to use them together, go ahead, but when you encounter problems like this you'll have to dig in with the dev tools and see why they aren't working together. In this case, I suspect that the sortable is removing / recreating elements in the DOM without removing and reinitializing materialize's event handlers. If that's true, then it's not a bug with either Materialize of jQuery UI but rather with your integrating code, which needs to ensure that these libraries are used according to their APIs.. This relates to https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4522. Also, for the 3.x version, why is >=3.2.1 required? I am stuck on 3.1.1 due to blocking regression: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3611. Would you please consider embedding the Materialize version number somewhere for humans to read? Yes, I know, I should be able to tell very easily by looking at my project's package.json or more directly by looking at the manifest of materialize itself, but often it's helpful during debugging to be able to confirm the version with which one is working in the console, e.g. M.version --> \"1.0.0-alpha.3\" (jQuery used to do this via jQuery.fn.jquery). If by some terrible accident, for example, two different versions were being loaded one would presumably overwrite the other, and someone might spend considerable time troubleshooting problems before realizing what happened.\nIs this considered bad practice since it reveals information and can enable version sniffing?. How about \"not recommended\" then? (since the bower website \"recommends\" using yarn/npm) Deprecated seems to imply that an end-of-support date is planned, but bower is still supported.. @tomscholz would you like me to /discouraged/deprecated/g in this commit? If that will make it acceptable I will do so. (The precise wording is not particularly important to me.). I'm not sure whether or not this should be a separate issue, but it also looks funny when a prefix icon is used:\nhttps://jsbin.com/bugavi/edit?html,output\n\nIn my project I am working around this with:\ni.prefix ~ span.helper-text {\n    margin-left: 3rem;\n}.

Hey @DavidCRivera, so the above jsfiddle link is working fine for you?\n. Hey @zkellerdevelops, I have implemented a very similar setup to what I think you're asking for and I'd gladly put together a quick PR if you can confirm it's what you're after.\nIf you register an account (does not have to be real email) against this demo here, it ought to present you with a FAB menu that is triggered only on click.  Let me know if that's the behaviour you had in mind.\n. @zkellerdevelops I've implemented the override you're after.  My PR introduces a CSS class called .click-to-toggle, and adding it into a .fixed-action-btn menu will:\n-  Prevent hover behaviour\n-  Toggle opening or closing the menu (w/ animation) whenever the .btn-large is clicked.  Works for vertical and horizontal FAB menus.\nExample:\nhtml\n<div class=\"fixed-action-btn click-to-toggle\">\n  <a class=\"btn-floating btn-large red\">\n    <i class=\"large mdi-navigation-menu\"></i>\n  </a>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating red\"><i class=\"material-icons\">insert_chart</i></a></li>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating yellow darken-1\"><i class=\"material-icons\">format_quote</i></a></li>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating green\"><i class=\"material-icons\">publish</i></a></li>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating blue\"><i class=\"material-icons\">attach_file</i></a></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n. Accidentally closed this.  Let's see if I can reopen.\n. Have you actually tried 3869f12?  It does not fix either #2039 or #2052.  Here, try this example.  I've copy-pasted 3869f12's dropdown.js into it.  The right-aligned dropdown is in the wrong place.  (Make sure to let the window be large enough that it does not get force-aligned.)\nIn addition, it is not responsive -- if the dropdown moves within the page due to resizing (try shrinking the fiddle window so the cards are stacked vertically, then open the dropdown) the edge detection alignment remains locked in because you are overwriting options.alignment instead of using a locally scoped variable.  So, even when a dropdown has enough space to align as requested, it will only ever align as if it were still at the edge of the window.  This is not expected behaviour.\nThis PR resolves both of these problems.  Here is proof.  Please reconsider accepting it.\n. Yes, 561ee50 appears to work as expected now.  Awesome!  Thanks.\n.

It's more complicated with Javascript.  It's possible, of course, to redefine objects after they've already been defined, but it's not at all recommended.  You must be very careful the order in which you modify your prototype structures -- and now you're sending more redundant code to the client that is never used.\nIn addition, this project uses a build procedure that essentially takes the parts that authors modify and then reduces them down to a handful of \"minimized\" master files that include everything.  Therefore, you have no choice but to merge in the actual changes you like and then rebuild your own JS files.\n. It's not very hard though!

Chips are cool but I was actually more concerned about the other items. I've updated the issue above to specify the features that I'm looking for in a robust autocomplete solution.. Regarding using IDs. This helps immensely with a few things including i18n.\nFor instance:\n[{value: 'apple', id: '4rew65s1', img: '\u2026'}, {value: 'banana', id: '7r98vv8s', img: '\u2026'}]\nand \n[{value: 'manzana', id: '4rew65s1', img: '\u2026'}, {value: 'pl\u00e1tano', id: '7r98vv8s', img: '\u2026'}]\nwould be the same with the labels localized\nWith the current autocomplete implementation, I would have to have a lookup table for every single language that I support to get the proper id, which is not scalable.. I ended up building my own autocomplete from scratch to support IDs. It's built using Aurelia, however, so it might not be helpful to you unless you're using Aurelia..

It's a little confusing that it is currently called collections when the Material Design spec refers to lists.

Hopfully @Dogfalo will accept this PR.. cc: @Dogfalo @acburst @ajmark @tomscholz @klouie93 @kmmbvnr\nWhat's the hold up on accepting this pull request. It passes the tests, it seems like it is ready to go.. @tomscholz It appears that an update to the documentation was included in the PR. Is there something specific that is missing? Would it be possible to accept this PR and add a new issue to expand on the existing documentation?. In the material design specification there is no \"collection\" component. There is, however, a list component and I think this pull request is great.\nI would recommend accepting this PR as is and deprecate the collections component to be completely removed for version 1.0. Yes, there would be two similar components for a time but you would ensure backwards compatibility until the old component is removed.. @penguoir I reviewed the PR, I think it looks good (but I'm not a committer on this project). One thing, it looks like the documentation page page-contents/lists_content.html is missing?. So, I tried using this and ran into a problem. The .primary class clashes with a class name that I already have defined elsewhere. Actually, it appears to be used by aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-materialize-bridge to set the color scheme.\nCollections actually uses .secondary-content and I think that would be great here as well.

They're not manipulating the style at all.\nOn my device, using cordova, this is what I get. Mind that not only the icons are in the wrong place but the text is also smaller than it should be, giving the < li > a look that is like its bigger than it should be.\n\nOn the same device, checking that codepen through the default browser, the mdi-navigation-menu icon of the menu renders properly, but all the other icons (material-icons) don't. This also happens on Dolphin browser.\n\n\nBut on Chrome, all is rendered properly.\n\n. OK, I managed to fix this issue by adding the Crosswalk Webview plugin on my Cordova app. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out what the problem really was, but if I were to point fingers, would be to a poorly handle of EM sizes on the default Android Webview, and/or the meta viewport set.\n.

Agreed, still getting the same issue. \n. Ok let me step in and say something about this. It has been over 1 month of\na release that your team introduced which introduced breaking changes for\nthe entire meteor community. We have clients and projects depending on your\nproject. This is simply unsatisfactory . And shows a lack of support to the\ncommunity. It wouldn't be right for me to sit back and pretend that this is\nok.\n\nThis is completely wrong and you should meet with your team to find a\nbetter workflow to prevent this from happening again in the future. I think\nmaterializecss is a great framework which is why I'm taking the time to\nwrite this critical piece of advice.\nGoing forward never leave the community lagging behind for over a month\nwhile you \"figure out\" a way to fix the issue. A fix was posted and it took\nseveral weeks to review then approved the patch and took several more weeks\nto even respond to the community.

I'm not sure if this would fix the drop down issue, and I can't test right now, but it's worth a shot.\n. If you don't know, the default behavior is for any button (anything of the .material-icons class) to function as a close button. You can call a function with onclick with the button, but regardless of what the function does the chip will disappear. I needed the chip to only vanish in certain instances, so this wouldn't work.\n\nThe change I outlined above makes it so that any element inside the chip that belongs to .close-chip-btn will function as a close button, but anything that doesn't will function just like it would anywhere else. If you need more information on the default behavior, see the MaterializeCSS documentation on Chips.\nFor example, if I used this markup:\nhtml\n<div class=\"chip\">\n    Some Text\n    <i class=\"material-icons\">close</i>\n</div>\nWith the default behavior, the button would make the chip vanish. With my behavior, this would do nothing. If that seems useless, take the example below:\nhtml\n<div class=\"chip\">\n    This is not a closable chip\n    <!---This icon is an \"add\" icon from google's material design icons-->\n    <i class=\"material-icons\" onclick=\"someJSfunction()\">add</i>\n</div>\nWith the default behavior, it would close the chip (just like the example above) because anything inside it that belongs to .material-icons closes the chip. With my behavior, however, this would not close the chip. It would execute someJSfunction(), but the chip would remain on the page.\nNow take this example:\nhtml\n<div class=\"chip\">\n    <i class=\"material-icons left\" onclick=\"someJSfunction()\">add</i>\n    This has 2 buttons\n    <i class=\"material-icons right close-chip-btn\">close</i>\n</div>\nThis markup would yield a chip with two buttons: an add button and a close button.\nWith my version:\n- The <i class=\"material-icons left\" onclick=\"someJSfunction()\">add</i> button would not close the chip, and would execute someJSfunction(), when clicked.\n- The <i class=\"material-icons right close-chip-btn\">close</i> button would not execute Javascript, but would close the chip. Adding the close-chip-btn class makes it behave just like all icons do now.\nWith the existing code:\n- Both buttons would close the chip when clicked.\n- the add button would execute someJSfunction(), but would still close the chip, when clicked. this posed a problem for me.\n\nCould you explain what this change does and if one could override the normal behavior when I'd add this to the footer of a document?\n\n@Sajonara I'm not sure I understand what you're asking about the footer of a document. Are you asking what you would add to the bottom of your HTML page to enable my version of the chip code? If so, you can't do it from HTML alone, you must edit the Materialize.js file as I outlined in my original post. If I'm misunderstanding your question, please clarify, I'll be happy to answer.\nHope this helps!\n. > It's problematic having them close regardless of what the icon is.\nPrecisely. The Chip design is quite universally useful, but the closing feature makes it a pain to use them.\n. > It's problematic having them close regardless of what the icon is.\nPrecisely. The Chip design is quite universally useful, but the closing feature makes it a pain to use them.\n. I think it sort of does. I didn't get the idea from a Material Design site/app, but it seems Google is using some similar transitions. For example, this page on the Google Material spec shows several elements \"flying in\", although in this case it is from the bottom rather than the side. (look at the \"Consistent Choreography\" heading)  My code technically supports flying in from the bottom, however this may do weird things to the dimensions of the page (when I tried having things fly in from the bottom it extended the length of the page to account for the offset during animation, which makes everything seem awkward)\n.

(excuse the styles looking terrible):\n\nBasically the second level of headers should be represented in the row version of the column headers, but they are not represented at all. All column header rows are translated into one column when made into the responsive version of the table. \nMy first header with row 1 column 1 spans two columns and my second also spans two levels the row 1 column 2.  This is done to visually group headers together in the UI. As it stands right now the columns no longer maintain their meaning when it switches to the responsive version of the table. \n. That's what I was thinking, and it looks much better than my image copy/paste version. \nAnd don't worry about taking longer to look at it. Open source work is hard to keep up and it is appreciated. \n.

Could you post your HTML?\nDo you have, by any chance, any event handler for the focus/click where you do a preventDefault()?\nHere you have a sample, a form with 'editable' css class that triggers the focus event on an input within. As you can see, I cannot reproduce the issue:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/La8qx3k9/\n. Happened to me too.\nI don't know why but in the latest relases a css left rule disappeared for the labels.\nIf you write:\nleft: 0.75rem;\nAs in older releases, you will have it placed correctly.\nYou should add this left rule to this part:\n.input-field label {\n. Hello @acburst I have narrowed down the problem on my side.\nOn my project I use an HTML processor that removes unwanted whitespaces, etc. from the final HTML code. Causing the HTML of an input-field to be:\n<div class=\"input-field\"><input type=\"text\" id=\"txt1\"/><label for=\"txt1\">Label 1</label></div>\nSo no linebreak before the label\nOn previous versions of the CSS having that left: 0.75rem fixed the position of the label. I see you have set on the latest commit a left: 0.\nPS: Here is a link to reproduce it http://codepen.io/Nohinn/pen/RRmyVx\n. I don't know if I understood you right. Take a look at this codepen:\nhttp://codepen.io/Nohinn/pen/xONgLv\nTo change the switch color without using !important you should use those css rules.\n. Using for example red as an additional class to an element applies: \n.red {\n    background-color: #F44336 !important;\n}\nto that element.\nBut if you want to apply this class to a switch you must consider all the switch CSS section of the framework:\n- .switch label input[type=checkbox]:checked + .lever\n- .switch label input[type=checkbox]:checked + .lever:after\n- .switch label .lever\n- .switch label .lever:after\n-  input[type=checkbox]:checked:not(:disabled) ~ .lever:active::after, input[type=checkbox]:checked:not(:disabled).tabbed:focus ~ .lever::after\n- input[type=checkbox]:not(:disabled) ~ .lever:active:after, input[type=checkbox]:not(:disabled).tabbed:focus ~ .lever::after\n- .switch label input[type=checkbox][disabled] + .lever:after, .switch label input[type=checkbox][disabled]:checked + .lever:after\nThough in your case you might not need to implement all those rules, by adding the option of changing the color of the switch just by adding a color class all those rules must be taken into account (they might need a modification or not, a lightest/darkest gray for the lever to have a better contrast with the color, etc.).\nSo imagine having to add for each color in the framework the color variation for the switch. The file would be really big compared to the current one.\n. You could try unbinding the click of the link:\nvar btn = $('.dropdown-button');\nbtn.unbind('click.' + btn.attr('id'));\n. As @K1llMan said. There are issues with the handlers.\nThey're only bound if you call .modal() with or without arguments before calling .modal('open').\nBefore you could have the HTML element and just calling .openModal(arguments) would open the modal window, without having to initialize it in any way previously.\nDoing something like in Init.js ($('.modal').modal();) would work if all the modals are already in the DOM tree, but if you create a new modal you must init it first, then call the open function.\n. Another issue.\nWhen closing a modal the opacity is changed, etc. but the display is not changed to 'none' as in previous releases. Making all the content from the modal invisible and on top of everything on your UI.\nP.S:\nCannot customize actions to take on closing/opening a modal. You must define everything before opening or closing, and you cannot run one ready/complete callback depending on any custom criteria (If I click that button it should close/open doing this, if I click this other button it should close/open doing this other thing)\n.

Yes @acburst it is absolutely logical, but in terms of ease of use we are moving from 1 function call to 2.\nThe reamining issue I reported. although you can pass arguments to the open/close function, they're not taken into account. \nA developer may need two buttons to close a modal, each one will do a different task on the complete callback function of the modal. Right now, you define all the plugin parameters when you initialize the modal. But you cannot pass a new complete callback function (for example) to the close function, because  the close function doesn't take into account arguments.\n.

Hello @Saravana-Kumar-putta , there is a misunderstanding on this property.\nThe time_constant property sets the time for the transition effect, not the time between transitions. The carousel control does not change from one element to the next one by itself, you should trigger it.\nThe only control doing that is the slider (currently).\n. The only workarounds right now would be:\n1) \nvar constant = 2000;\nvar carouselInterval = setInterval(function() {\n    $('.carousel').carousel('next');\n}, constant);\nBeing the value of the constant var your custom value.\nIn case you want to stop the carousel, then you will have to clear the interval:\nclearInterval(carouselInterval);\n2)\nChange the carousel control to the slider control.\n. Both jQuery UI and Materialize are UI frameworks having a \"tooltip\" function.\nSo if you add first the reference to materialize, and the reference to jQuery UI on second place. The jQuery UI tooltip function will replace the Materialize function.\nTo avoid this issue put this javascript snippet between the jQueryUI and materialize references:\n$.widget.bridge('uitooltip', $.ui.tooltip);\nSo it would be:\n<script src=\"jqueryui.min.js\"></script>\n<script>$.widget.bridge('uitooltip', $.ui.tooltip);</script>\n<script src=\"materialize.min.js\"></script>\nDoing this, tooltip will be the Materialize tooltip function. While uitooltip would be the jQuery UI tooltip.\nP.S: Take into account that this $.widget.bridge is part of jQuery UI, so the only way to make it work is adding first the reference to jQuery UI.\n. @eboye the data-activates is pointing to the sidenav ID.

Are we missing any additional info?\n. The change event is firing when you click on the option because the input's blur event is fired as soon as you click on it.\nYou could try using a timeout in your change function, or bind a click event to the options suggested by the autocomplete control, to get the current value.\n.

A) Add extra width to the field\nB) Via CSS add white-space: nowrap; to the label\n. Make sure you:\n1) Have more than one carousel item\n2) Initialized the carousel via javascript: $('.carousel').carousel();\nThen you can call the carousel('next')\nIf those 2 steps are ok, and still you cannot make it work then some code would be useful to see where the issue might be.\n. Let's say you have out of the carousel element a materialize button with id 'nextButton'.\n$('#nextButton').click(function() {\n    $('.carousel').carousel('next');\n});\n. Using the code you posted:\n1) I would remove the onclick from both i elements. It might become hard in the future to debug all the code. If you have all the JS code in a js file you know where you have to look for it, but if you place it both in the page and in the js file you might forget where did you bind that click, etc.\nThen:\n```\n$('i.fa-chevron-circle-left').click(function() {\n    $('.carousel').carousel('prev');\n});\n$('i.fa-chevron-circle-right').click(function() {\n    $('.carousel').carousel('next');\n});\n```\n. The issue is related to the position of those buttons. You should place them out of the div with the carousel class\n. Just an annotation.

Hello @davodavodavo3, I have updated your example (I don't know if this is what you were looking for):\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/sj2tm8cd/39/\nTo sum up. Put display: none to your .dropdown-button::before CSS declaration. Then add this:\n.dropdown-button.active::before {display: inline}. Hello @davodavodavo3, I have updated your example (I don't know if this is what you were looking for):\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/sj2tm8cd/39/\nTo sum up. Put display: none to your .dropdown-button::before CSS declaration. Then add this:\n.dropdown-button.active::before {display: inline}. @MickaelH974 You can try and use this until there is something easier to use (if such a function is implemented ever):\n$('.carousel').find('.carousel-item[style*=\"z-index: 0\"]')\nThat will return the top most carousel-item (the active one).. With no more info the only thing we can recommend to you is to take a look at the documentation:\n$('ul.tabs').tabs('select_tab', 'tab_id');\nhttp://materializecss.com/tabs.html#method. @dima74 right now, until there is some sort of option in the modal configuration for it, there are two options:\n1) You should put that $('#modal2').css('transform', 'translateY(-50%)'); into the ready callback of the modal to avoid the css overwrite.\n$('#modal2').modal({ending_top: '50%', ready: function(modal) {modal.css('transform', 'translateY(-50%)'); }});\nBut this option creates a non appealing effect as you will see the modal moving to it's position after being shown.\n2) On your css (not on javascript, neither inline style).\n`\nmodal2 {\ntransform: translateY(-50%) scaleX(1) !important;\n}\n`. <div class=\"input-field col s12\">\n    <select>\n      <option value=\"\" disabled selected>Choose your option</option>\n      <option value=\"1\">Option 1</option>\n      <option value=\"2\">Option 2</option>\n      <option value=\"3\">Option 3</option>\n    </select>\n    <label>Materialize Select</label>\n  </div>\nChanging the text of the disabled option. That is what material select should show by default after being initialized.. Missing a comma after 'left'. You should make a pull request fixing this issue.

What I am actually doing is replacing the Materialize tab headings with a select for mobile users. \nAnd since the value of each original object is ignored when building the Materialize ul. That information is being lost - so my next attempt at working around this was to add in an anchor tag. BUT  - I see now it's not just anchor tags - Materialize strips out any HTML tags inside the option tags if I am not mistaken.\nAlso I am know using the Materialize js function\n$('ul.tabs').tabs('select_tab', 'tab_id') - which seems to do what I am looking for.\n<option> tags have values for a reason though - usually, standard practice is to add the numeric id of a certain object in the value field and the actual human readable name of said object in the option field i.e \n<option value=\"referable_db_id\">Human readable part</option>\nThis is now impossible because the value is stripped - maybe add it to the <li> elements materialize creates as an id? \nI was trying to add the anchor tags because the 'value' was not being added to the <li> tags.\nAll I really needed was have a class or id  to reference so I could hide or display the correct tab.\nThis is a great lib btw - thanks a bunch(forgot to mention this above.)\n- Agreed on the bad practice point,  a drop down is better - I just liked the look of the select.\n. @TyrionGraphiste I see.. Yeh I wasn't aware of the no child elements in an option tag being poor practice.

Okay, after further testing... \n1. It's not appending my options from JS like before. They are in the DOM, but not in the select menu.\n2. The selection of the field seems to be working better.\n3. When I try an opt group multi select just in the markup it seems to work.\n\n\n\nHope this helps. I think we're closer.\n. Yes, I'm filling in the selects with JS on load. Any thoughts? I'm getting desperate. I know this kind of worked, if this sheds any light. \n$('#Format').material_select('destroy')\n$('#Format').material_select()\n. I can't do a fiddle since the service we're using to provide the data to\npopulate the selects is not publicly accessible. With some of the filtering\nwe're doing, rebuilds the selects and the destroying of them is\nconflicting, since they're not real selects, but a manipulation of a DOM\nelement. At this point, I'm starting to use hope of using these selects,\nwhich is a bummer because I love the framework and the way these feel. Is\nthere any way to troubleshoot this?\nI could send you the js creating the options and optgroups?\nOn Fri, Jan 15, 2016 at 8:18 AM, TyrionGraphiste notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nPlease do a JSfiddle.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2522#issuecomment-171988886\n.\n. great, thanks. any other suggestions with the js not populating the selects?\n\nOn Fri, Jan 15, 2016 at 12:38 PM, TyrionGraphiste notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI just update my code for avoid destroy select they don't need.\nI'll do my PR in few time.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2522#issuecomment-172063340\n.\n.

Not part of the spec but something that people clearly wanted from a css framework such as this.\nAny suggestions on what would be correct equivalent according to the spec? If not surely that highlights that the M.D. team at Google missed something that is needed . @jsamuel89 It works if you add JQuery to your pen, I forked it and added that  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oExbXN . @jsamuel89 Not sure exactly how off the top of my head, but you could look at using the pushpin functionality of Materializecss http://next.materializecss.com/pushpin.html. I have experienced this issue today. I can confirm that setting overflow-y:visible on the modal seems to have fixed the issue.. @Dogfalo Yeah, that's a nice feature but I think one of the main issues with it is that it isn't really very user friendly. The user can't see/ammend what they have typed for instance. . bump, @acburst any movement on this being merged?. Not sure I agree/understand. This was merged in previously by @acburst in #2124 but was lost. Why the change of heart? Seemed to get a lot of positive response before. . Just in case anyone else has this issue, I have spent a while looking into this today and have come up with the following solution which seems to be working for me so far. I have added a class to my css that does the following:\nselect {\n    visibility: hidden;\n    display: block;\n    position: absolute;\n}\nThe issue is being caused by the original select element being hidden by materialize (which causes jquery validation to ignore the element). Setting the display to block is the actual bit that fixed the issue and allowed the select to be validated again. The other 2 rules are there as a way for me to make the associated messages appear inline with the other fields etc.\nSomeone can probably suggest a better solution than this but it suits what I need for now, would be great if someone could get round to sorting this in the framework itself.\n. @cvaraj Not sure what you mean here without a little more information but the col class already provides padding to the left and right of a div with that class applied.\n.row .col {\n    float: left;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    padding: 0 0.75rem;\n}\nThis should provide the gutter between columns within a row. If you provide more information I can clarify/correct my answer\n. @joaosardinha They seem to working fine for me, could it just be your browser?\n. @joaosardinha I can't get it to happen in Chrome, Edge, IE or Firefox so I don't think it's default behaviour. Is this happening in one of your projects or are you literally going to the materialize docs and clicking these buttons?\n\n. What triggers the openModal() method? eg. a button click?\n. Is it inside a form tag? If so try adding preventDefault() to the end of the click event.\n$('#btn').click(function (e) {\n            $('#shareModal').openModal();\n            e.preventDefault();\n        });\n. @darckyn You could do this yourself by adding some classes to your own css file.\nFor example to rotate an icon by 45 degrees you could apply the below class to the material icon element.\n.rotate-45 {\n    -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    -moz-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    -ms-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    -o-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    transform: rotate(45deg);\n}\n<i class=\"material-icons rotate-45\">file_download</i>\nWould produce the following output:\n\nHope this helps\n. I guess adding some 'standard' rotate classes like 45, 90, 180 would be beneficial for the time invested but obviously you wouldn't want to be providing a class that allows for each individual degree of rotation I wouldn't of thought.\n. @darckyn Here you go\n.icon-flipped {\n    -o-transform: scaleX(-1);\n    -moz-transform: scaleX(-1);\n    -webkit-transform: scaleX(-1);\n    -ms-transform: scaleX(-1);\n    transform: scaleX(-1);\n}\n. Try adding the class \"left\" to the i with the material-icons class as below\n<span class=\"card-title\"><i class=\"material-icons left\">warning</i> Welcome</span>\n. Try the valign and valign-wrapper helper classes \n<div class=\"card\">\n    <div class=\"card-content\">\n        <span class=\"card-title valign-wrapper\"><i class=\"material-icons valign\">warning</i> Welcome</span>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n. Don't know the answer to this but it only seems to happen when the card is inside of a row. E.g.\n<div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col s12\">\n            <div class=\"card\">\n                <div class=\"card-content\">\n                    <span class=\"card-title\">Test_1</span>\n                    <p>I Am A Card</p>\n                    <div class=\"col s12 m4 offset-s3\">\n                        <div class=\"card\">\n                            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                                <span class=\"card-title\">Test_2</span>\n                                <p>I Am A Second Card</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\nProduces:\n\nBut this:\n<div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"col s12\">\n        <div class=\"card\">\n            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <span class=\"card-title\">Test_1</span>\n                <p>I Am A Card</p>\n                <div class=\"col s12 m4 offset-s3\">\n                    <div class=\"card\">\n                        <div class=\"card-content\">\n                            <span class=\"card-title\">Test_2</span>\n                            <p>I Am A Second Card</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\nproduces:\n\n. @Kinark Very nice! should definitely look at getting this in the framework..

But what if you need to set options before opening it\n(why ? depends on context, exemple : async request)\n+1, this is a bug. @Dogfalo ok :)\nI actually need this in my project.\nToo much async stuff, and nothing in materialize can handle those scenarios without too much dev.\nSo I'll work on it anyway ;) . @bert-w that's precisely what i want to avoid : DOM manipulation just for a loading animation feels really heavy.\nBTW, I already told this in current behavior ^^'. @bassie1995 Oh ^^\nI'm just wondering why not implement Ladda in our framework ?\nAll those loading button are great and use-able easily.\nContract-overlay button is neat for submitting form without manually disabling every input & select.\nOr i'll just implement overlay capabilities on my fork ...\nEDIT : I did the overlay stuff, way more simple with observer =)\nEDIT2 : I tried Ladda, I think there is too much stuff. A simple loading feedback as I did is less complicate to understand & apply them to any project is easier than Ladda. Loading is already implement in Materialize and make them appear on button doesn't seems to be a good idea to me.\nPeople will still be able to add Ladda to their project for specific needs tho.. ~~I'll need help about icons transition ... I wish they could fade away then let loading animation appear but I don't know how to atm.~~\n~~Also, I need a moment to create animation color ... animation will stay white for the moment, I'll make them compatible with *-text color classes.~~\nEDIT : done. ~~I'll need help about icons transition ...

Just added overlay + updated description\n-> I think overlay should have a Jasmine test . > I think the more material pattern would actually be to remove the button and show a spinner in its place, not within the button.\nYou're probably right on this one. So can we start a new PR with this ?\nYou can see on #4941 that people want this feature, some has even melted frameworks together like Ladda to get this feature.. > I think the more material pattern would actually be to remove the button and show a spinner in its place, not within the button.\nYou're probably right on this one. So can we start a new PR with this ?\nYou can see on #4941 that people want this feature, some has even melted frameworks together like Ladda to get this feature.. @jpic Well, there is so much way to make this feature available through so much JS library that it was \"implementing something user would probably customize themselves\". \nI understand why this hasn't been done.\nAnyway, since there is so much commits to catch, you can see what've done in \"Files changes\" tab and DIY or reopen a new PR ;). Attributes id have to be unique\nYou can use & store Materialize.guid() to build your ids,\nOr just change one of your id=\"dropdown1\" to id=\"dropdown2\" and, obviously, change his intier ;) \nAnd please provide a codepen !.

Thank you very much, Thanood! The use of left: inherit;, instead of left: initial;, for .fixed-action-btn.horizontal ul, seems to fix it. There is only one little difference in IE11 vs Firefox or Chrome, as you can see in this gif: a cut of one pixel, in IE11, for the ul li elements (with blue background-color, in the gif), which cuts the blue circle in the bottom, in IE11...

There is only one little difference in IE11 vs Firefox or Chrome, as you can see in this gif: a cut of one pixel, in IE11, for the ul li elements (with blue background-color, in the gif), which cuts the blue circle in the bottom, in IE11...

The scrollable tabs example on the demo page gives a false impression on how scrollable tabs work because all tab captions are relatively short and do not get truncated.\nOne dirty hack would be to change the min-width of a tab a a value that is large enough like so:\ncss\n.tabs .tab {\n  min-width: 250px;  \n}\nBut then all tabs will have this large size which might not be optimal.\n. @djake's comment only partially fixes it or put another way it introduces another issue. Please take a look at the example. Without class=\"validate\" on textarea it looks nice but breaks when typing in additional lines.\nWith class=\"validate\" on textarea it changes css rules and transform: scale(0.8) does not apply to it anymore so the font is bigger than other input fields and which breaks the common look principle. And also it makes me lose control of the line color as the line then becomes green on it's own when you input text in which is not always desired.\nhttps://codepen.io/pingec/pen/qPqVra\nIf my conclusion is correct it should be marked as a bug..

I tried to use this file again today, but...\n1) There seems to be a bug - src of the img element is changed to original on click, but never changed back to thumbnail image. As a result, the image shrinks down and replaces thumbnail with respect to scale only. \n2) You have a bug with ancestorchanged variable - you change it's css, but when it stays undefined (in case while loop never finds it) it throws an error - this probably will be fixed simply by if (ancestorchanged !== undefined) but I am not sure what this one is for.\nThe animations with velocity seem odd here and I am not quite sure how it works.

I've been really frustrated lately juggling between collections and sidebar lists that contain the same content but have totally different capabilities. Collections feel so limited, I can't even get links to work with secondary content, whereas the sidebar list just works.. Another one I came upon is .collection-header vs .subheader. Subheaders are defined by google to be dividers for lists... which is basically what .collection-header does? Are subheaders only defined in a certain context? Why can't seem to use a collection in the sideNav? Documentation should make this functionality clear. Continuing the list of items where components are confusing in my opinion: today I wanted to add a search bar to my nav.

This method uses .search. and .search-wrapper but isn't documented at all! I had to open my browser dev tools and inspect the documentation site, which is certainly not optimal.\n\nAdditionally, I wanted to display search results underneath: I could either go with .collection in keeping with the rest of the framework, or use the completely undocumented .search-results, which appears to be specific to sideNav.\nI ended up stealing from both methods https://codepen.io/chuckdries/pen/yXaJLJ\nI'm beginning to think that my issue may just be with sideNav lol..

Ok now. i fixed.. Hard to coding on codepen. Bec I need two pages. let me descripbe here.\nI have two pages: index.html and test. html\nIndexhtml:\n```\nModal 1\n<div id=\"modal1\" class=\"modal\">\n<div class=\"modal-content\">\n  <h4>Modal Header</h4>\n  <p>A bunch of text</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"modal-footer\">\n  <a  data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"test.html#modal2\" class=\" modal-action waves-effect waves-green btn-flat modal-trigger\"> Open Test html Modal2</a>\n</div>\n\n\ntest.html:\n\n\nTest\nTest\n\n\nAgree\n\n\n```\nProblem is:\nWhen I click  Modal 1 button, modal1 is open. No problem here. But after open modal1, there is a button there Open Test html Modal2 This button should open model in test.html as modal.\nBut I can't do it till now. It is possible bootsrap frame. But i didnt find any solution in  materializecss. If you see my first post, I asked that is it in capabilities , error  or pull request .  Because if it is not possible then i will not search to waste time. \u0130f it is possible but not available now, then i opened pull request. So , If you say, it is  \"how to\", so I understand that it is possible. thnx. ",

I think the heart of the issue is that the .row .col uses floats, .valign-wrapper uses flexbox, and they might not be compatible as is, without a hack.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-containers\nIMO, floats are useful and all that, but things can get difficult if they're relied on too much -- like a row-column layout.  I hope to see a future Materialize version that does away with this and relies on basic position, flexbox, and grid for layouts.\nAlso, while I'd much prefer a full flexbox/grid layout scheme, here's another option for vertical alignment using position:absolute (and a few associated properties).\nhttps://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html\n. FYI, I'm using v0.100.2 and I am having this issue.  sigh. @DanielRuf I think you're right because if I put the carousel initialization inside the modal's 'ready' statement it works as expected (or close to it).  Here's the pen, as requested: \nhttps://codepen.io/jessegilbride/pen/EwdPyr. PLEASE rewrite the layout scheme (.row .col {...}) to be based on flexbox and grid, instead of floats.

This is a problem I am also facing, while using the leaflet layer control with materialize.

Thanks, this is great! This solved a lot of the issues, however, a few still remain.\n- On mobile you can't delete tags, because pressing backspace focuses the chip/tag, which hides the keyboard.\n- When the input is flows over, the label intersects with the chips:\n  \n- There's no way to change (add, remove, reset) the .chips data programatically from javascript. Maybe expose the private methods? A current workaround is to reset the outerHTML of the .chips element and reinitialize it, since you can't reinitialize a chips element. \n- The .prefix and <input> field should maybe still be focused, while selecting a .chip ?\n  \n- Ultra minor issue: very little offset between regular text fields\n  \n. bump\n. There are still issues with the chip tags. Just saw an alternative approach at reach-md. They put the chips above the input field which solves a lot of the issues. . I just noticed this as well. \nThe modal jQuery interface needs to be changed. Currently, it is not possible to bind the ready and complete events to a modal, if it doesn't have a trigger and is just triggered via. JavaScript. \nIMO, the leanModal() method should be called on the modal itself, since the trigger is optional and this makes more sense. \n. Judging by the code, it looks just like I wanted it to be. Will take a look at it when I have time, but it definitely looks like the way forward and looks very promising.\n. I just noticed another problem with the old method, however very minor. When the browser is resized while a modal is open, the body has a fixed width and doesn't resize. Is this fixed in the new proposal?\n. I fixed this my manually adjusting the CSS. It was quite cumbersome to get working properly. It was clearly only meant for small number values. \n. https://gist.github.com/jonasroessum/1618067911e482aea53ab65f6e9233da\n. Could you maybe illustrate this in a codepen? Use this template for easy materializing: http://codepen.io/pen/?template=oLakEj\nIt has all the materialize nescetities included. \n. Just bind a click handler to one or more of the buttons, then you will know which button was pressed. \n. In general, I also find the tooltips very glitchy. For example, if you move your mouse in and out too fast, ghosting occurs. Also, they work really poorly on mobile, where two taps are required to trigger a button. \n. https://gfycat.com/FaithfulFrighteningGourami\nhttp://codepen.io/jonasroessum/pen/BLOdpb?editors=1000\nThe minor issue seems to have been fixed by fading the tooltip in, it seems smoother in the newest version.\nI can't seem to recreate the modal issue that @ev5unleash is experiencing, except that the tooltip has a higher z-index value than the modal and it's overlay, however not the issue he is describing.\n.

Then if I click outside of the input without first clicking into the input to give it focus, nothing happens. But If I click inside the input (giving it focus) and then outside in the rest of the table cell. It works as expected. Thus I am trying to automatically apply focus when making the input visible.\n.

The reason why that is happening is because when you open another sideNav the previous one is just hide, not close, once you click again the button it closes the sideNav, you can modify the materialize.js so it will always open or hide the buttons until the sideNav is close, if you still need the multiple buttons to open the same sideNav i can tell you how to modify the js file\n.

I'm not sure.\nThe change that appears to be the most relevant is \"Meteor package now supports Sass\".\nBefore this change, in v0.97.6, the CSS was added in package.js from dist/css/materialize.css and the CSS used the font as ../fonts/{...}; thus pointing into the dist folder.\nHowever in v0.97.7, SASS is used and the files are imported from sass/{...} where font-path is defined as\n$roboto-font-path: \"../fonts/roboto/\" !default; so apparently .. points somewhere else in this case.\n. For instance, what @poetic did in his fork was to change the variables to\n$roboto-font-path: \"/packages/poetic_materialize-scss/dist/font/roboto/\" !default;\n$icons-font-path: \"/packages/poetic_materialize-scss/dist/font/material-design-icons/\" !default;\nbut that's not a valid approach here because it would only work in Meteor then.\nMaybe he knows better what to do.\n. Ok, in the meantime I've done the following to workaround this issue (because I need the autocomplete feature :smile:):\n// Temporary workaround for materialize fonts\nWebApp.connectHandlers.use(\"/packages/materialize_materialize/fonts\", function (req, res) {\n    const url = req.originalUrl.replace(\"/fonts/\", \"/dist/fonts/\");\n    res.statusCode = 301;\n    res.setHeader(\"Location\", url);\n    res.end();\n});\n. @polkhovsky, I cannot add anything else but \"works for me\".\nCheck this repo for a working brand new project with the workaround.\n. I haven't thought of that. But I guess no, whatever gets the suggestions needs to be called in response to user input and needs that input to fetch them.\n. What I was thinking of is a client provided hook around the folowing point in js/forms.js#L319..327:\n``` javascript\n          // Perform search\n          $input.on('keyup', function (e) {\n            // Capture Enter\n            if (e.which === 13) {\n              $autocomplete.find('li').first().click();\n              return;\n            }\n        var val = $input.val().toLowerCase();\n\n```\nsuch that the hook gets called with val and is in charge of generating the dataset for that text, maybe asynchronously, which then gets rendered into li tags.\nAlso, I believe the code could be improved by extracting the different concerns to configurable functions, namely completion, rendering and value extraction, making the component agnostic of data format and capable of supporting different layouts in the suggestions panel.\nLike in the following code (it's just a draft, I need to test it yet):\n``` javascript\n/ Sample data model which accepts data in the format used\n * by the current implementation of Materialize's autocomple.\n /\nfunction ClientDataModel (data) {\n  var a = [];\n  for(var key in data) {\n    if (data.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n      a.push({text: key, img: data[key]});\n    }\n  }\n  this.data = a;\n}\n/ fn: complete\n \n * Given an input text, produce a list of suggestions and\n * pass it back to the caller provided callback.\n \n * The returned value is an array but the format of each item\n * it holds remains unspecified and the caller should only\n * handle them through other methods of this class.\n /\nClientDataModel.prototype.complete = function (input, callback) {\n  var lowerCasedInput = input.toLowerCase();\n  var filtered = this.data.filter(function (item) {\n    return item.text.toLowerCase().indexOf(lowerCasedInput) !== -1  \n  });\n  callback(null, filtered);\n};\n/ fn: render\n \n * Given one data \u00ectem (that has been produced by complete) and\n * an \u00ecnput, render the item to a li element where the input is\n * highlighted.\n */\nClientDataModel.prototype.render = function (item, input) {\n  var highlight = '$&';\n  var text = item.text.replace(new RegExp(input, 'i'), highlight);\n  var li = $('');\n  var span = $('');\n  if (item.img) {\n    var img = $('');\n    li.append(img);\n  }\n  span.html(text);\n  li.append(span);\n  return li;\n};\n/ fn: extract\n \n * Given a li element rendered by render, return the value the input\n * field should be set to.\n */\nClientDataModel.prototype.extract = function (li) {\n  return $(li).text().trim();\n};\n$.fn.autocomplete = function (options) {\n  if (options.data) options.model = new ClientDataModel(options.data);\nif (!options.model) {\n    console.error(\"Autocomplete does not have a data model.\");\n    return;\n  }\nreturn this.each(function() {\n    var $input = $(this),\n        $inputDiv = $input.closest('.input-field'); // Div to append on\n// Create autocomplete element\nvar $autocomplete = $('<ul class=\"autocomplete-content dropdown-content\"></ul>');\n\n// Append autocomplete element\nif ($inputDiv.length) {\n  $inputDiv.append($autocomplete); // Set ul in body\n} else {\n  $input.after($autocomplete);\n}\n\n// Perform search\n$input.on('keyup', function (e) {\n  // Capture Enter\n  if (e.which === 13) {\n    $autocomplete.find('li').first().click();\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  var val = $input.val();\n\n  // Check if the input isn't empty\n  if (val !== '') {\n    options.model.complete(val, function (err, suggestions) {\n      if (err) return console.error(err); //TODO: handle errors\n      $autocomplete.empty();\n      suggestions.forEach(function (item) {\n        var li = options.model.render(item, val);\n        $autocomplete.append(li);\n      });\n    });\n  } else {\n    $autocomplete.empty();\n  }\n});\n\n// Set input value\n$autocomplete.on('click', 'li', function () {\n  $input.val(options.model.extract(this));\n  $autocomplete.empty();\n});\n\n});\n};\n```\nIt may look quite complex, but there are a few improvements here:\n1. The data structure holding suggestions is an array; thus avoiding ordering issues *\n2. The autocomplete client may specify a custom \"data model\" allowing for more complex data than a pair of text and image and the possibility to display that data using a custom layout.\n3. Because the rendering of suggestions is done in a callback asynchronous completions are supported.\nThe last one is what this issue is about and it's very useful for datasets that won't fit in the client unless pre-filtered server-side.\nIt may make sense not to expose the data model to the client; it's a material design library after all. But having it makes it easy to support the different designs\u00f8.\n. By the way, this is how you would use the approach above for querying GitHub:\n\"Data model\" definition:\njavascript\nfunction GitHubReposModel (user) {\n  this.user = user;\n}\nGitHubReposModel.prototype.complete = function (input, callback) {\n  $.ajax({\n    url: \"https://api.github.com/users/\"+encodeURIComponent(this.user)+\"/repos\",\n    error: function (xhr, status, error) {\n      callback(error);\n    },\n    success: function (data) {\n      /* GitHub endpoint doesn't allow filtering server-side */\n      var lci = input.toLowerCase();\n      var filtered = data.filter(function (item) {\n        return item.name && item.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(lci) !== -1;\n      });\n      callback(null, filtered);\n    }\n  });\n};\nGitHubReposModel.prototype.render = function (item, input) {\n  var highlight = '<span class=\"highlight\">$&</span>';\n  var text = item.name.replace(new RegExp(input, 'i'), highlight);\n  var li = $('<li></li>');\n  var span = $('<span></span>');\n  if (item.language) {\n    var encodedLanguage = encodeURIComponent(item.language);\n    var src = \"http://placehold.it/40x40/?text=\" + encodedLanguage;\n    var img = $('<img src=\"' + src + '\" class=\"right circle\"></img>');\n    li.append(img);\n  }\n  span.html(text);\n  li.append(span);\n  li.data(\"value\", item.name);\n  return li;\n};\nGitHubReposModel.prototype.extract = function (li) {\n  return $(li).data(\"value\");\n};\nInitialization:\njavascript\n$('input.autocomplete-xhr').autocomplete({\n  model: new GitHubReposModel(\"dogfalo\")\n});\nMarkup:\nhtml\n<p>Autocomplete with XHR</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col s12\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"input-field col s12\">\n        <i class=\"material-icons prefix\">textsms</i>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"autocomplete-xhr\" class=\"autocomplete-xhr\">\n        <label for=\"autocomplete-xhr\">Autocomplete XHR</label>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. Here's a CodePen\nhttp://codepen.io/diegonc/pen/qNrWRP\nNote that the autocomplete plugin is registered with jQuery in a ready callback so it's not available until then.\n. Here's another approach #3423 I've been thinking about. :smile: It's more general and moves custom logic outside of the component.\nI'm not very fond of the solution using \"classes\" and I'd like to rework it in terms of simple functions some day. But I didn't have feedback yet, so didn't want to advance any further without knowing if it's acceptable.\n. ",
    "Metrophobe": "Just encountered the problem now and am trying to create a package which uses pure css and js (min version) to resolve the issue but so far not there yet im not managing to trigger the js as I am fairly new to packages.\n. @polkhovsky  The fact that the fonts are bundled but are not loading obviously imply that there is something wrong. My simplest workaround and never fails is to \n1. Download the package from the original site (whatever framework it is) \n2. Create a fonts folder inside your public folder inside meteor , and include all the respective fonts in sub folders that you wish to get loaded.\n3. Locate the import statements inside the css of the framework, in the event you are using google fonts you are provided this. \n4. Then use @import statements inside the main.css of your meteor app (located in the root). Please remember not to put in the word \"public\" in your url as it is not required and nothing would load.\nYour fonts will now load fine.  At least for the time being while the issue is being fixed, you do not have to stay playing about with packages that should be working but they don't.

I think this is related to this issue: #3417 \n. Sure. I'll try to make it as easy as possible and as optional parameter in sidenav function.\n. @acburst \nOK, I've made the implementation of back button that closes the sidenav:\nhttps://github.com/eboye/materialize/commit/967c8ea778fc2f652ba1e31c097399d27aebaeef\nI haven't made a pull request as I've changed the sideNav.js to comply with jslint that may not be what you want. But feel free to copy the parts of code that does this.\nI haven't made the checks if the option is enabled for history pushing that may be needed for option turned off. I'll make those when I have some spare time.\n. Any chance on this being merged?. @Dogfalo OK, great ... looking forward to it.. It can be filtered out.\nFor example, I'm using gulp to copy fonts, so the task looks like this:\n// ### Copy Vendor\ngulp.task('copyVendor', function () {\n    'use strict';\n    //Materialize Fonts\n    gulp.src(\n        './bower_components/Materialize/dist/fonts/roboto/*.woff?',\n        {\n            base: './bower_components/Materialize/dist/fonts/roboto'\n        }\n    ).pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/fonts/roboto'));\n});\nAlso I make my main.scss where I import everything from main scss of Materialize where I skipped _roboto.scss import and added mine without eot and ttf.\n. data-activates attribute must point to the nav ID. So either you rename data-activates to nav-mobile or make the ul ID mobile-demo\n. Do you have any errors in console? If so, which ones?\nAlso, are you including scripts in the right order?\njquery\nmaterialize\nyour_js\nand if you are running on local machine, are you opening it via http://localhost or by opening html file in a browser? opening html in a browser makes some issues if the paths or urls are not done right. Actually it could be anything. Can you paste here or on codepen your code and test it out?\n. I don't think we should remove colors from the library as this is the thing that brought me here.\nThat primary, secondary color scheme was the thing I hate about bootstrap.\nIt's always possible to remove those colors not used from the colors array in colors.scss\nI always do this when my code is ready for production.

Hey, today I improved code for autocomplete - added arrow keys usage, more advanced replacing data and some other things. Look at https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/pull/3694\n. @arlowhite  I added callback onSelect which you described in #3729\n. added in #3694\n. Comment maybe doesn't bring so much, but I do that because it's easier for me to read a code. Comments have different color and for me when I looking through the code it's like headers.\nI separated that intentionally. First and less important I think right now it's just more readable. In one section you define functions - in different section you fired that. \nBut more important thing: if you move everything to one loop and have for example 100 autocomplete inputs, when you run this loop you will define all this function 100 times. Right now you will define functions only once and you can fire that 100 times. It's just about performance.\nAnd you cannot move this code to line 450 because this function just will not work. \n. You're right I changed that.\n. it's a legacy after old code. I changed that and I'm hope so it's not a some kind of hack for old IE or something.\n. I'm not so sure about that, but if you could provide solution like that and it will work we can use that.\n. Yup, you're right. It should be before if. Changed.\n. Duplicated - it's the same what you wrote before. Changed.\n. Hmmm... If you do that you can change:\n    if (maxElementsAmount !== null)\nOn something like this:\n    if (maxElementsAmountIsNumber === true)\nI don't think it's a big change\n. I changed that, but all programmers has own style and there isn't \"the style\" which you can use in each situation. It's about preferences. If we want to have the same style in each file we should configure task in \"gulp watch\" which will be reformating code after save. That's the only way to have the same style in the whole project if you have more than 2 programmers ;)\n. ok\n. look above\n. changed\n.

    "deepsheth": "Method 1: If you want them all to be equally wide, you should manually customize the CSS of col s1 to have width: 7.69 (100% / 13 columns). \nHaving 13 columns all in one row is probably a bad idea if you want it to be responsive -- everything will look crammed on a phone. You should probably use col s2 m1 so the columns are bigger when you shrink the screen size.\nMethod 2: And if you don't want to change the CSS directly, another alternative would be to divide the row into two large columns of size 12 and then divide those two large columns into 6 columns and 7 columns to get you 13, but of course the column sizes will not be equal.\nSo something like this below (notice the last two columns are size col s1 instead of col s2 in order to prevent exceeding 12.\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <div class=\"col s12\">\n      <div class=\"col s2\"></div>\n      <div class=\"col s2\"></div>\n      <div class=\"col s2\"></div>\n      <div class=\"col s2\"></div>\n      <div class=\"col s2\"></div>\n      <div class=\"col s1\"></div>\n      <div class=\"col s1\"></div>\n </div>\n\n\n``\n. The elements are displaying correctly based on the CSS.\nWhen your sidenav is fixed, the Materialize CSS for.side-nav.fixed aspecifiespadding: 0 16px;.\nIf you don't have a fixed sidenav,.side-nav aspecifiespadding: 0 32px;` This is where the padding difference comes from, but I do agree that 32px does look better.\nYou can fix this by making the fixed sidenav have 32px padding.\n. The sidenav is inheriting properties from nav .nav-wrapper i which makes the height of the icons 64px and that cuts into the list item below it, forcing it to shift right. If you move all of the HTML code for the sidenav under </nav>, the .nav-wrapper property will not be inherited and the icons will scale properly making everything adjust properly.\n. ",

Is there a way to manually remove rogue tooltips on route change? Or would it be possible to make materialize check orphaned tooltips every second f.e.?\n. @fega the problem still exists. All these new js frameworks like meteor, blaze, angular, react etc. will swap elements out.

It probably makes more sense to fix the underlying z-index issue, unless that causes bigger issues.\nI assume that way .side-nav would work correctly both within and outside of .navbar-fixed?\nIn an ideal world, we wouldn't need two <ul>s for this, since from a markup perspective it makes little sense to duplicate the nav list.. Hm, I thought I'd written another comment on this but it looks like it never sent.\nWhen .side-nav is a child of .navbar-fixed, no matter what you set .side-nav's z-index to, it seems to be positioned within its parent .navbar-fixed.\nThis is the main cause of this bug.\nThe #sidenav-overlay and .navbar-fixed both share a z-index of 997. This is so that they are always above page content. Since the #sidenav-overlay is later in the markup, it goes above .navbar-fixed (which I believe is intended, since this places the overlay above the scrolling header).\nSome people have suggested modifying the z-index of either .navbar-fixed or #sidenav-overlay so that .navbar-fixed is above #sidenav-overlay, however this would mean that the scrolling header would also be above the overlay. (See Comment 16).\nUnless we find a work around for children of a fixed element with z-index set being positioned relative/within that parent (on the z axis, anyway), the only clean solution I can see is to ensure that .side-nav is not a child of .navbar-fixed. (As per Comment 5 and 6).\nTo those concerned about the ul.side-nav being outside of a nav element: We also can't move the .navbar-fixed > nav outside of .navbar-fixed because it is crucial to the materialize positioning, however you could create a seperate nav > .side-nav structure outside of .navbar-fixed if you like.",

Same disadvantages too: still need to override the z-index of the sidenav-overlay to 1 and seo is affected.. in your codepen: paste 4 times the current text into the div for the tab.  You'll notice the height is limited and no scrollbar appears.  Try the same with the official demo and you'll see the same problem again.  If the text is too long, it is hidden with no scrolling possible.\nOne could use a height with xxx px, but if the content of the different tabs differs, than that is not an option, as it is for me on the site i'm currently trying to develop.  check this: http://test.listoire.be/discipline/2\nIt seems my css skills are lacking, because i cannot trace the root of the issue.  I've tried adding clearfix classes, setting pretty much everything to height 100%, adding overflow hidden to several elements, nothing works.  The only thing that does work is using absolute px values for the height, but that is not an option.. added overflow-y: auto which at least gave me a scrollbar.

It seems Lighthouse 2.0.0 was just released and everything is good now, so it must have been a bug. Thanks!. @DanielRuf I am not a JavaScript developer myself, but if I have the time I will definitely make that pull request!\nI just now noticed the supported browsers, so it seems a polyfill or feature detection would need to be implemented. According to these docs, that could be achieved relatively simply like so:\n```javascript\nvar supportsPassive = false;\ntry {\n  var opts = Object.defineProperty({}, 'passive', {\n    get: function() {\n      supportsPassive = true;\n    }\n  });\n  window.addEventListener(\"test\", null, opts);\n} catch (e) {}\nview[0].addEventListener('touchstart', tap, supportsPassive ? { passive: true } : false);\nview[0].addEventListener('touchmove', drag, supportsPassive ? { passive: true } : false);\n```\nYeah there is definitely a Lighthouse CLI, but it is just a wrapper for launching Chrome. Although headless support just shipped with Chrome 59!\nI am on Debian Linux, so I have been unable to get it to work. There is a docker image with a headless Chrome I still need to try though!. @DanielRuf Sorry, I misinterpreted CI as \"Command (Line) Interface\" instead of the intended \"Continuous Integration\".

I followed the example in docs but i can't get it working. Can you suggest me some solution ?. It would be very helpful. @LucasPaganini I have got some observations about this problem. when sidenav width is greater than 65% of the total screen and scren size is not enough then links in sidenav does not work correctly. for small scrrens you should use dynamic width.\n  $('.button-collapse').sideNav({\n      menuWidth: 300, // Default is 240\n      edge: 'right', // Choose the horizontal origin\n      closeOnClick: true, // Closes side-nav on  clicks, useful for Angular/Meteor\n      draggable: true // Choose whether you can drag to open on touch screens\n    }\n  );\n```\nhere instead of fixed menuWidth calculate the total screen width and put 65% of it.. @bradgillap I don't think the unexpected padding on the cards is a fault of .row or .col class. These classes con not interfere with card's css.  Did you change the css of card? Can you share your full code to explain this problem in detail? A good demonstration of cards can be seen here Try to recheck you code once\n:smile_cat: :smile_cat: . Nice one @TheColorRed This seems to be really good idea. \nWhy don't you send a pull request. So everyone can have the benifit\n:smile_cat: :smile_cat: :smile_cat: . I don't seem to understand your issue. Why do you want use container class if your page is fine without it, just use a main wrapper for whole page and apply your custom css to it.\nUsing container class should not be a problem  just override container class a tweak some properties and you will be fine wiht it.\nContainer class can have some down points so use it carefully.\n:smile: :smile_cat: :smile_cat: . did you initilize jquery plugin of dropdown.\n\nIf a default dropdown is opened programatically calling dropdown('open') it stays opened even after clicking an item because no event handler on $(document) is added here.\nSo, only thing you might do is to open the dropdown and add your own listener:\n$('.card a.btn-floating').dropdown ('open'); setTimeout (function () { $(document).one ('click', function () { $('.card a.btn-floating').dropdown ('close'); }); },10);. I don't know the reason for this problem but here on this repo you can find an implementation which seems to be solving your problem.\nI have a properly functioning sideNav that works on small, medium, and large screens as intended.\nThe issue I have noticed is with sideNav slide-out in small screens. I have not tested this in medium screens (tablets) as of yet. When I slide the sidenav out by either pressing the button or sliding from the edge of the screen and then proceed to close (i.e. not clicking on the button or sliding back to close) the sidenav by pressing somewhere away from the sidenav ... I will then notice a jitter of the sidenav when scrolling on that page.\nNot sure if this is clear enough for someone to try and re-create the above issue but someone else on gitter also faced the same problem.. versio does not seem to be a problem here. In my case i only tried only the right side sidenav.\nI used that code from your repo and noticed the sidenav to still be jittery when i use edge: 'left' but when I use edge: 'right' the jitterness goes away and clicking away from the sidenav does not close the sidenav either\n\nThe problem of sidenav not going away did not happened to me.\nYou can try in my application in the repo.\nCan you provide any github link of your project?. There is a small mistake in your code @bibislayer change class chips  to chip\n<body>\n      <div class=\"chip\">Hello</div>\n      <div class=\"chip\">\n    Tag\n    <i class=\"close material-icons\">close</i>\n  </div>\n      <script>\n        $(document).ready(function() {\n          $('.chips').material_chip();\n          $('.chips').on('chip.add', function(e, chip){\n            console.log(\"Added\",chip);\n          });\n          $('.chips').on('chip.delete', function(e, chip){\n            console.log(\"Delete\",chip);\n          });\n           $('.chips').on('chip.select', function(e, chip){\n            console.log(\"Select\",chip);\n          });\n        });\n      </script>\n  </body\nFollow the docs here. @bibislayer The last code i have seen, there was a mistake. You did not initilize you tags like this one\n$('.chips-initial').material_chip({\n    data: [{\n      tag: 'Apple',\n    }, {\n      tag: 'Microsoft',\n    }, {\n      tag: 'Google',\n    }],\n  });\nSo i fixed that mistake first.\nNo chip was showing before in the last code.

    "kriscooke": "This is really about modularization.\nI think many people's objections may stem from the fact that they do not wish to use or have jQuery available in their projects just because they consume Materialize. In an age of tree-shaking and customized builds, people expect their dependencies not to dictate monolithic global exports into their project.\nFor example, I don't mind that much if Materialize wants to depend on jQuery. However, in my project's build I expect to be able to produce:\n- A reduced project build containing only the Materialize components my project actually uses.\n- A reduced subset of jQuery corresponding to only what is used by those Materialize components (or even Materialize as a whole).\n- A Materialize build which imports jQuery in such a way that $ and jQuery are not in my project's global namespace. This is important because I don't want my team to start using jQuery simply because they found it hanging around as a global - it's a secondary dependency of Materialize, not an explicit dep of my project - which is not well-expressed by the requirement to globally import jQuery in the document <head>.\nAs a stepping stone that I think could assuage many people's concerns over jQuery here and in  #877:\n- This project could distribute a custom build of jQuery\n- Or otherwise as an even nearer-term solution, give people the needed info to produce their own reduced jQuery builds. \nWhat's needed to do this is an up-to-date list of jQuery modules that Materialize absolutely depends upon and/or can safely be excluded from the jQuery build..

No, it isn't. I noticed, that problem is only with first toast on page, second and every next toast will have the same width during appearing. In Chrome bug is very reproducible (on codepen), widths differ about 50px almost every time.. I realized the problem. If I show toast in the beggining of the page loads, when fonts doesn't load yet, then toast text will have default browser font (DejaVu Sans Light in my case). And DejaVu Sans Light is a little more then Roboto Light (which is default Materialize font), so toast will have a little more width while appearing, until Roboto Light font loads. I think nothing can be done with this. Anyway, thanks for helping!.

You guys are really reactive, that's amazing.\n200% agreed with you @DanielRuf.\nI'd suggest you'll adopt SemVer after refactoring all components or ship every breaking change in a same release, otherwise you'll end up with a Materialize v36.0.0 pretty fast. It might be confusing for users and might damage your \"brand trust\".\nA cautious road map might be :\n\nRefactor component's style one after another in an incremental release path upon 0.x.x\nAchievable goal. Ease integration with 3rd party. Fast ROI. Everyone is happy.\nAdopt SemVer and ship 1.0.0\nSend a strong signal to the community about your ambitions.\nIntent to drop jQuery dependency step by step in a separate VanillaJS branch.\nMake a public announcement. Call for help among contributors and plugin developers.\nMerge successively every 1.x.x releases upon VanillaJS branch as the developpement / maintenance of 1.x.x progresses.\nWill help the final merge.\nPerform a final merge when VanillaJS branch is ready, and start a release canditate cycle.\nStart to gather feedbacks from the community and adjust to them.\nShip 2.0.0\nCelebrate and get drunk. (IRL)\n\nIntending to drop jQuery will be savage as Materialize have many dependencies on jQuery plugins (datepicker, srollspy, etc). You could also loose the jQuery addicted fanbase... Moreover, I feel jQuery is not a big entry cost for most projects as it still very popular, already shipped with WordPress, faster than before and easly accessible with CDNs. I tend to personally see Materialize as a \"big jQuery plugin\" even if I'm not a big jQuery fan myself.\nI'm not even sure my point 4. would welp as it'd become be a total rewrite.\nOn the other hand, the idea to be ES6/ES7 compliant might be very well received by the community and could galvenize everyone to start contributing. Being able to promote yourself as a dependency free framework would also be a big marketing argument.\nSo, a big investment cost for a low short term ROI, I guess many product managers would lough at us. But we worth better than that, don't we ? We understand the sake of a sustainable long term CI.\nPeople used to say adopt early is important, let's say so does drop early.\nGathering the community is the key here, why not create a survey ?\nWhy not also adopt TypeScript ?

    "sigma-technology": "This appears to be fixed in 0.99.0 - JSFiddle. I've managed to make this responsive and get around the height issue by adding height: 450px !important to .carousel-slider and then have used the following jQuery to automatically resize it when the screen width changes.\nfunction carouselHeight() {\n    $('.carousel.carousel-slider').each(function() {\n        var newHeight = $(this).find('.carousel-item img').height();\n        var origStyle = $(this).attr('style');\n        $(this).attr('style', origStyle+'; height: '+newHeight+'px !important');\n    });\n}\n$(window).resize(function(){carouselHeight();});\ncarouselHeight() can also be called just after initialisation to fix the initial height issue.. Would be good if max: new Date() was in the docs.. @Dogfalo I agree completely with you - my personal preference is that the ALLCAPS in the buttons is actually easier to read.\n@DanielRuf It used to be 3.1 of WCAG 2.0 however I've just had a good look through and can't actually find any reference to over-use of capitalisation anymore. Hopefully it's gone and I can tell our clients that it's no longer relevant next time they mention it!. As far as I can see, yes.  Whether or not our clients will see it in the same way remains to be seen!. You're going to need to provide more information than just a screenshot. The checkboxes are working fine in 0.98.2 in my app so it must be something your app is doing.. data-position is also ignored - defaults to bottom: JSFiddle. It would also be useful, if data-position=\"bottom\", to make the tooltip hidden when the select menu opens.\nSorry for multiple comments.. Ok, thank you I thought that might be the case.. Apologies, so it does.  I had assumed because the only thing that had changed was the jQuery version that it was something to do with that.  It must be my code :-(. Also when countSpaces: false it should probably ignore any space-type characters, including line breaks if it was a textarea.. Also when countSpaces: false it should probably ignore any space-type characters, including line breaks if it was a textarea.. I'm also experiencing this issue.  Here's a codepen for the v1 release.\n@Blazzike where would that code go?. Thank you for the quick response.  Recompiling the JS isn't really an option for us unfortunately as we're using NPM.\nHowever, your code does work perfectly - I've managed to override that function using $.extend, so anyone using jQuery should be able to do the same:\n$.extend(M.Modal.prototype, {\n  _handleFocus(e) {\n    if (!this.el.contains(e.target)\n       && this._nthModalOpened === M.Modal._modalsOpen\n       && document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(e.target, null).zIndex < 1002) {\n      this.el.focus();\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nI've updated the codepen.\n@Dogfalo I realise this isn't technically a Materialize issue, but would it be possible to include some sort of generic solution such as the one above into the next release?. Calling M.updateTextFields(); after the fields are generated will resolve this in a more reliable way than manually adding classes to the labels.. @diegoscor Version 1.0.0 has been released and M.updateTextFields() is working fine for me in this version. I suggest you upgrade and if it's still not working then it's probably something in your code as I'm pretty sure it was still working for me in RC2 as well.. ",

    "abernix": "@tomscholz The problem here is with fsevents trying to be installed on a Windows platform (It's an OS X-only package).  This seems to indicate that materialize:materialize or one of its dependencies has been published from a directory where the node_modules directory included the fsevents package, thus it has been included in the package bundle.\nThis is along the same lines as https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/3538 (and the linked/related issues).\nThis is merely a suggestion (since it's mentioned frequently above), but is it possible that at one point this happened with the fourseven:scss package?  The dependency in materialize:materialize is on an old version of that package and it has seen a lot of updates!. @tomscholz Correct.  Since files in node_modules are import-able by packages, they are included when running meteor publish and anything listed in devDependencies is installed within node_modules\u2013devDependencies are useful for packages too sometimes!\nIf there are packages which you will not need in production, you should remove them from the node_modules directory prior to publishing.  You can do this on an existing node_modules by running meteor npm prune --production.. @tomscholz Yup, as long as you don't have a dependency on a specific version of fourseven:scss!  That would allow apps to use newer versions of fourseven:scss, which has seen a lot of updates from it's team!. @tomscholz You only need to use.imply a package if you want the consumers of your package to have access to that package as well.  For example, with this line, if someone installs materialize:materializethey will have access to the $ (and jQuery) variables in their application, even if they do not explicitly add the jquery dependency to their package themselves.\nSo, only set api.imply('jquery') if you want to give users jQuery if they use Materialize.  If you just want to use jquery in materialize:materialize, then you only need api.use('jquery').  If you also don't need jQuery, then you can remove jquery altogether. :)\nHope this helps!

    "r3wt": "@jvilk \nthe lifecycle of SPA's are beyond the scope of jQuery plugins. one approach you might take is to override jQuery's init() method and use it to maintain a list of selectors with bound events, and use the well known hack to remove all events.\noverride $.fn.init:\n```js\nvar watchedSelectors = [];\n$.fn.init = function(selector,context)\n{\n    //you could maybe add some logic to see if you want to watch it or not.\n    var jQinstance = new jQselector(selector,context||window.document,$);\nwatchedSelectors.push(selector);\n\nreturn jQinstance;\n\n};\n```\nremove events when needed:\njs\nfor(var i=0;i<watchedSelectors.length;i++){\n        $(watchedSelectors[i]).find(\"*\").addBack().off();\n}\nwatchedSelectors.length = 0;\nyou could probably take it a bit further and remove from specific selectors, but i'll leave that exercise up to you. . @jvilk I'm not associated with the materialize team at all. I built a SPA framework based on jQuery starting in 2015 and ending in may of last year, so i encountered the same type of issues with Foundation and Bootstrap. \nAs to your question:\n\nA possible solution on your end is to expose a cleanup method in some manner, letting folks who are affected by this issue call the method to remove the handlers (material_select_cleanup?). I do not know if there is a convenient / expected way for jQuery plugins to expose this functionality.\n\nThere really isn't a defined standard for destroying plugins. There were several suggested boilerplate plugin frameworks that provide it like $.fn.pluginName('destroy') but alot of plugins don't have this functionality because the boilerplate wasn't widely adopted. Some plugins provide a way to destroy and cleanup, most don't. You're going to run in to this problem time and time again with jQuery plugins and SPA's, in my experience.

If you are using an old version you may need to use $('.tap-target').tapTarget('open');. Your issue is that the div containing the forgot password button is sitting on top of your form.\nSee broken CodePen I have added a background class to the div that has the issue so you can see how it is sitting. \nI then created working CodePen to illustrate how it should be sitting.\nTo get this working properly, you'll have to rework some of your HTML.. From the StackOverflow provided, I created a CodePen that is not loading the additional HTML via JavaScript. With this, you can see that the issue still exists. The Materialize CSS is handling the placement of the .btn and .file-path-wrapper next to each other. By adding the .clear-button-wrapper between those elements you are breaking the expected layout for the file input. Another way to think of this is that the file input will take up 100% of its parents width (in this case s12 which is 100% of the row). Adding another element into the mix that is not outlined in the docs is going to break the layout.\nBased on the StackOverflow I have also added in two ways that I might correct the HTML structure if this were my project. Hope that is helpful.\n. Here is a CodePen that shows this working. This CodePen uses v1.0.0-beta. So if you are using this version, it should be working.

I put some comments into the JS area to which you'll want to pay attention. . Your instances is an array of objects, so you would have to use instances[0].open(); to access the first instance or get a specific instance with var instance = M.Autocomplete.getInstance(elem);.\nHowever, I think that you need v1.0.0-rc.1 to have the .open() and .close() methods.

    "arminmon": "@Dogfalo The most practical way is to auto-generate RTL classes with a Sass function but there are problems:\n Not every CSS attribute should be swapped like float: left to float: right. Doing so, will break the layout for as I've tested it many times already. And it's not only about the float, there are text-align, border, left, right & etc which should be modified in the proper way.\n RTL support should be generated within each component, which will modify all files, otherwise even if there was a global function, it should've gone through every single component everytime something changes.\nBuilding a global function that could generate something like I've done, would be the best way to go. But it just seems that there are too many variables.. @tomscholz I had a quick look at what they're doing for RTL support. It seems quite easy.\nhttps://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/blob/develop/scss/util/_direction.scss\nThe hard part is that we'll need to implement this into the whole project for once and then we can change the direction at any time by changing a variable.\nWe could start working on it, if you're interested.. @JafarAkhondali\nYou're probably right. The other reason that I've holding back from the development is that Materialize is still in development phase an the stable version is not out yet. Till then it'd take too much work to keep up with development from the outside.\n\u067e.\u0646.\n\u062e\u062f\u0645\u062a \u0632\u0648\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0628\u062f \u062f\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0647. \u0648\u0642\u062a\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u0647 \u0645\u0627\ud83d\ude14. @tomscholz Persian, Arabic and Hebrew are RTL for sure.\n@NonameSLdev I removed that line. Maybe That \"new\" content for badge shouldn't be included at all. It seems more flexible if it was fetched as a data-attrib in CSS like this: content: attr(data-badge-text);. @tomscholz @NonameSLdev \nThis class is added in case you want to change the floating behavior of the .cols inside a .row.\neg, You have RTL content inside a grid but you want to pull columns to left (keeping the deeper tags responding to the parent's .rtl class and prevent adding extra .rtl class to nested tags).. @NonameSLdev I'm not sure if JS is the most optimized solution for this case. We're talking about static content here, therefore it won't worth it to bother client's memory load with JS.\nData-attribute would be the best option as soon as it gets well-supported by all browsers, till then we could either load each data-attribute into the tag with JS or let the developer set their own \"phrase\" inside a span tag..

I just check the media sample on the website, and it still doesn't seem to be fixed. Thanks.. Sorry, I mistake you as a collaborator thanks to your active response in this repository.\nAt the moment, I'm just using blur to unfocus and refocus the input, but this causes the dropdown content to flash. The right way to do it is to update things based on the data, so autocomplete doesn't need to be called every time things changes. There should be an updateAutocomplete feature somehow.... I can't think of anything at the moment cuz I'm not sure how this is realised in materializeCSS at the moment. I think there should be some kind of an event listener on the data field, so whenever a data change is detected, the list should be updated in real-time.\nI'm always curious about where the owner and the collaborators are. It may be better if maintainers all sit down and work something out.. Hi @acburst \nJust wondering if this issue will be fixed anytime soon? Or it's one of those issues that'll probably never make it to the priority list. Thanks.. Thanks for the update @DanielRuf \nUnfortunately, it doesn't quite work there. I mean the data does get updated, but the dropdown list didn't unless I unfocus and refocus.\nThis means your trigger there doesn't work cuz you can have the same effect just by recalling the entire autocomplete function, just like what you did above before the trigger.. I can't test it this weekend. I'll have to test it next week when I get back to work.\nJust make sure I get things right. I download the repository from your branch and load the minified JS in the dist folder.\nI'm using Vue, so there is no keypress. I run the code whenever there is an input change which should be the same. I also tried it when the page is mounted, and no luck back then. I'll retest it next week.\nAnother thing is my autocomplete starts when the first letter is input. There is no dropdown when the autocomplete initiated. Will your solution takes care of situation like this?\nThanks again for the updates, if the way I load the file is wrong, please let me know.. Hi @DanielRuf \nThanks so much. It works now. Could you please merge it to master so I can get the feature in cdn instead of a local js file? Thanks.. Hi @DanielRuf \nThanks so much. It works now.

Thanks @DanielRuf \nNo need to rush and there is no deadline.\nAgain, it's not the speed of the update, it's more like the way it gets updated in the frontend. You can see when you keep adding on letters to a word, it works pretty well because the ul is not getting destroyed. All I ask is something like that even when the item gets updated, i.e. update the text in ul > li, not destroying and reconstructing them unless the no. of items is smaller than the user set limit.

It's ok if you can't figure out the best approach we mentioned above, just wonder at least when that feature will be accesible. Thanks.. Just to add to the pool, the search shouldn't have any lines in this nav bar when it's focussed. Sure, I can overwrite it with my own CSS, but a proper fix would be great. For now, I'm not leaving ver.0.98. 100.1 nav search bar still has a border at the bottom when focussed. This is just frustrating.... @fega Putting the icon issue aside, The teal bottom border there is what I'm talking about, not to mention @alexisdiel has already fixed it above and show in codepen. I don't understand how this end up going sideways in the actual update...\n\n. I'm using Chrome 60 (previously 59) on desktop. @fega described it pretty clearly in his first reply. It's the movement of the label when the input is being unfocused. Just on the official website, you can see a clear jump on the transition comparing let's say forms in input field section at the top of the page and the textarea sections.\nIf you still can't tell the difference, then maybe never mind? Currently, I'm overriding all labels in the textarea with transition: all .3s, which solves the issue.. I'm just confused why every time an update is pushed, these fundamental components would get broken... It's not like you guys are adding more features to those building blocks or switching to a new style....

Would be highly appreciated.... @DanielRuf \u2013 sure Daniel here are two codepens demonstrating the problem...\nWorks if we click on the tabs:\nhttp://codepen.io/sandor/pen/OmMOBP\nWill not work on swipe or on tab-klick:\nhttp://codepen.io/sandor/pen/pPgdXw\nThis should work if possible also on swipe.... @tomscholz \u2013 nope nor errors on my side. Just no output to the console (you should use the console of safari and not the one of codepen)..... @tomscholz \u2013 hehe, I know it is uncool to use safari ;-) but I like the look ;-). guys, sorry for my ignorance, but I am a bit confused now. So 0.98.2 has a fix for this bug? Or does 0.98.2 breaking swipable tabs? Hard for a beginner like me checking all the possibilities :-). Just a naive question here \u2013 would it be possible to introduce some callbacks for this (I think this is than also related to some other components that are using the slider) like in slider.js (http://idangero.us/swiper/api/#.WPpzOTZ3VW8) \u2013 something like onXXXX(swiper, event)... Not that I could code this. But I wish I could.. @DanielRuf  Thanks Daniel ! \u2013 will give that a try tomorrow... Too much red wine for now :-). @DanielRuf Hey Daniel, sorry for the late replay. Do you have a complete script that I could test? Would give it a try.... @DanielRuf Hey Daniel, I have done my best. I have never worked with gist and stuff like that, and I am not a developer. I was not able to create the rawgit url so I used the raw URL from the gist. I have re linked my original codepen here http://codepen.io/sandor/pen/pPgdXw with the gist file. I can confirm that now clicking on the tabs will give the desired info in the protocolle. Swiping will also cause the console to show \"something\" \u2013 but the result is to cryptic for a poor designer like me... Anyhow \u2013 nor error message that I can see... But maybe you just have a look at the codepen/gist?. ",

    "sirlancelot": "I kind of like the implementation in #3760. Only reason I didn't go with that in my own is that I wanted to avoid creating a new file. It appears to be a better solution overall though and would allow users to avoid including utility color classes entirely, a plus in my book.\nThis is NOT related to #4088 though.. I updated this PR to be a little closer to #3760 but with the key difference being that with this implementation, it is now only required to import a single \"Variables\" file which defines all variables while not outputting any selectors on its own.\nI kept the color utility classes inside _global.scss because it already contains other \"utility\" selectors within it. Those can moved out in another PR if anyone wishes to do so.\nThanks for creating this repo, @Dogfalo. I'm finding it very useful! I think the community will appreciate the change proposed here.. Haha I thought you might catch that! If you take a look at that file though, you'll see that nearly everything inside it is commented out except for a single mixin which isn't used anywhere. I figured it would be harmless to uncomment it for now to save a future headache where someone puts things in that file and wonders why they're not working ;).

    "penguoir": "This feature can be used when using a transparent navigation bar. Nobody wants a shadow from a transparent element. I'll do the documentation soon. . Perhaps a .flat class which just removes shadow and a .transparent class which turns the navigation transparent as well as removing shadow?. Why is this a problem? Couldn't you just add an if statement to your code?. Think about it like this. For you, it's quite simple to have nothing change if the same value is chosen. However, if someone else does needs an event when the same value is chosen, it will be incredibly difficult for that person to implement.. I just realised that collections is really similar to this. . Cool. Is there a specific way to add a component to the framework?. I've made the pull request. I think it would be a good idea to integrate lists as I implemented them and slowly deprecate the collections component.. See #4716 for more details. What do you guys think? Any improvements? Extra features?. This is quite easy to do on your own but should (in my opinion) eventually be added into the Materialize library.\nHere is what I did:\n```javascript\n(function($) {\n  /\n  options: {\n    id: 'modal1',\n    title: 'Modal Header',\n    content: 'Content goes in this area',\n    action: 'Accept',\n    actionLink: '#'\n  }\n  /\n  $.fn.cModal = function(options) {\n    $(this).append(<div id=\"${options.id}\" class=\"modal\">\n  <div class=\"modal-content\">\n    <h4>${options.title}</h4>\n    <p>${options.content}</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"modal-footer\">\n    <a href=\"${options.actionLink}\" class=\"modal-action modal-close waves-effect waves-green btn-flat \">${options.action}</a>\n    </div>\n  </div>)\n    $(#${options.id}).modal()\n  }\n})(jQuery)\n// later...\n$('body').cModal({\n  id: 'modal1',\n  title: 'Modal Header',\n  content: 'Content goes in this area',\n  action: 'Accept',\n  actionLink: '#'\n})\n// to open:\n$('#modal1').modal('open')\n// to close:\n$('#modal1').modal('close')\n```\ncodepen\nIt's quite clumsy but you get the gist. A custom modal function is quite easy to add yourself if you really need it.\nI might do a pull request into the main framework if I get an 'OK' from one of the moderators.\nHope this helps!.

I'd like to see improvements to the project structure. Have documentation in a separate repo or in the docs folder, use markdown for writing, etc.. I've taken the liberty to create a JSFiddle. Everything seems to be working fine.\nMake sure to put your <button type=\"reset\"></button> inside the <form> element. Or, if you have a problem with your specific code, perhaps upload a Codpen or JSFiddle so that we can help you with that.. I think the trouble might be because of the onclick=\"\". Try using an event handler in Javascript:\njavascript\n$('.btn').on('click touchstart', e => {\n  alert('working')\n  console.log('working')\n})\nIt's better if you give an id to the button and then you can select it with jQuery as $('#id')\nHope this helps!. This is off the top of my head;\nMaybe this is a problem with the carousel button event listener? Perhaps it only listens for click but doesn't listen to touchstart and therefore doesn't trigger on mobile?\nJust a hunch. I'll look into it more.. Could you share a codepen so we could further understand your problem?. I can't reproduce this issue. Could you share a codepen that would show the problem?. Could you share a codepen to illustrate your problem?. How are you nesting your tabs? What \"doesn't work\"? Could you share a codepen to illustrate your problem?\nThanks!. @markstalker thanks for the codepen. I'll work on this tomorrow and give you an answer then.. The problem is with Materialize tabs. When a tab is activated through the hash URL, it doesn't activate the parent tab so you can't see it. I've written some code to solve this problem and I hope this helps:\njs\n// With nested tabs, activate the parent tab if the nested tab is active.\nif ($active.length > 0) {\n  var id = $(this).parent().attr('id');\n  $('a[href=\"#'+id+'\"]').trigger('click');\n}\nI'm opening a pull request now.. I think that might have something to do with your CSS.\nI haven't tested this but try using something like:\ncss\n.tabs {\n  overflox-x: hidden;\n}\nGlad I could help!. Been looking for a solution for a while and I can't find one. I'm not sure if I'm missing something.... @Wsine, I'm not sure what you're checking for in your if statement. Could you elaborate? (The problem is definitely with the if statement). Does the documentation require the use of nested tabs?. Also, should there be tests for this feature?. Couldn't you just use the .divider class on an <hr> element?\nhtml\n<hr class=\"divider\" />. Couldn't you just use the .divider class on an <hr> element?\nhtml\n<hr class=\"divider\" />.

It did warn me, however about experimental versions.. Just as an FYI - I set the view inside a container div , and the bottom of the view is still blocked in the browser, but no element exists there.  I can turn on the developer tools, and hover that blank area, and the whole page is highlighted except that area, which says the dev tools think the mouse is at some parent main element at that point like . \nI also noticed, that with a 4 column table, the width of the table looks to be 100%, but the columns don't fill the full width, it's like a ghost column is out to the right.  Once I added the container div, it did get rid of the extra column space to the right, but the height is still an issue.. I'm closing this because I'm an idiot!  OMG - it's so embarrassing I hate to post it, but I must.  I set the height on a completely different view with a table, and erased the class specifier when I did it, so all tbody tags were getting the height limited...same for width on td...ugh!  \nSo sorry..

Presuming it might not be a huge impact on projects not really dependant on jQuery other than using Materialize, so was useful to see that for myself. We actually wrap Materialize in Angular directives (because we worked with a design company that didn't realize we're using Angular and were using Materialize), so hopefully will be an easy upgrade for us.. Regarding not using bower, we're using bower, and use the bower-npm-resolver to still use bower until we migrate, but via npm. Not sure if this is the right place to post, but the experience of tabs can be improved at some point. See the discussion and specifically check the comment illustrating the example of how it should look according to the Material guidelines - I specifically like the option of a \"More\" dropdown, but the pagination overflow is nice too.\nObviously, if this is only going to come at a later stage, it's understandable, hoping it's high on the priority list, it's currently affecting the UX of our solution quite a bit on a responsive design page with multiple tabbed panels in two ways - you can't make the tabs div smaller in terms of height because you need the space for the scrollbar, but then in our UI the indicator looks out of place being so low beneath the tab, so I've had to customize it via CSS and even customize the JS to customize the width of the indicator which also looks out of place spanning more than the text width of the tab..

    "doubleOrt": "@acburst I fixed my problem by overwriting all of Materialize's z-index calculations and modal openings. \nSteps to reproduce this issue: \n1- Create a modal with the id #modal1 \n2- Inside of #modal1, create a modal-trigger for another modal, say #modal2.\n3- After you go to #modal2 with #modal1's modal-trigger, #modal1 is still opened but its z-index is smaller than #modal2's so it is not visible. \n4- Now if you have a modal-trigger for #modal1 inside of #modal2, when you click it, nothing happens, because the z-index is not recalculated (since Materialize thinks #modal1 is already open so the methods just return or something). \nSo basically, create a modal, go to another modal with a button from that initial modal, and then inside of that second modal try to go back to the first modal using another button, the initial modal, which logically should appear, does not.\n. @acburst currently on a deadline so i can't spare any time to reproduce the issue with a Codepen, i created this issue out of desperation, but i fixed it myself after 6 hours of continuous work. What i did was i created  a stack for the modals and a custom z-index counter, so on a modal-trigger being clicked, i checked if it was already opened and if it was, i updated its z-index so it was on top, and i use that same stack on the modals being closed, everything is working alright so far.. @acburst  If this already had a solution, please inform me because i don't want to mingle with your defaults.. @acburst  \nEdit: Just went through your documentation again, you already have a method for destroying select elements (the issue i am describing below), thanks!!! Will try that out and see if it works. Meanwhile, just ignore everything else in this comment.\nEdit 2:   $('select').material_select('destroy'); function has no effects. I am using Materialize v0.99.0\nOkay, here is another issue i want to ask you about since you appear to be active in this library's issues section.\nIs it mandatory for the select inputs to be recreated over and over again each time you re-initialize them, does this behavior persist in the newer versions of Materialize ? say i initialized a select input, so now everything is great, however i copy the HTML of the div containing it to another div, and now the select inputs, and their UL elements, generated by Materialize, will be copied as well (visible the source code), however those won't be actually shown anymore when i click their select input elements. I have to re-initialize them, and if i do that, then i end up with duplicate select inputs. \nSo is there a solution for this or do i have to remove the already-generated UL elements manually before re-initializing. \nSorry for the too-many questions, i feel like i am demanding too much of this library and i am using it for   something it was not meant to do (a mobile-app, virtually). And i did end up having to do the most things Materialize was supposed to do for me myself, like the tabs, even their animations didn't work as expected when they were added dynamically, that is the only issue with this library, it is not as dynamic as it should be. Perhaps  you guys could work on that.\nThis is really bugging me, destroying the selects has no effects, and re-initializing them results in duplicates. So the entire documentation related to updating/destroying selects is just not doing what it is supposed to do, i don't know if this is for me only, or everyone else as well. . @acburst  Gist to reproduce the second bug\n. I am using the latest release of Materialize. I believe this is occuring because in your JS, you are keeping a reference to the select input, and when i reload the HTML using x.html([etc]), that reference of yours is not updated (you have to update your reference, otherwise it becomes useless), hence the x.material_select('destroy') not working. Just a theory. \nShould i create an issue for this bug ?. Yes, i also faced this issue, there are 2 solutions: \n1- Create a callback for the showing of the container of the tabs (the element that is hidden), and in that callback, re-initialize the tabs (for example, if the parent element is a modal, you can use the built-in modal complete callback).\n2- Hide Materialize's standard tab indicator manually in your CSS, and then edit the .tab.active class so that it has a border-bottom that replaces the tab indicator, if you go this way, you will lose Materialize's nice tab changing animation, but if you try a bit hard you should be able to replicate it. Or you just create another simple animation like i did (a combination of scaling and skewing on active, it looks great).\nAnd this issue is a duplicate of another issue i have seen a hundred times over the past few months.. @tomscholz BTW, the functionality i am talking about is different than the one you have implemented in the Pen, yours appears as soon as the user scrolls down 100px, what i am talking about is an FAB that disappears when you scroll down, and re-appears if you do a small scroll up 10px. . @tomscholz  The Pen is not working, the page just keeps refreshing forever.

I find a way to disable certain hours from being picked (I didn't need to disable minutes for now but it should be easily extended). \nMy code isn't clean enough yet but I'd like to share this info as soon it was working.\nFirst of all, it's necessary to extend slightly the options of the pickatime plugin to accept a disabledHours option defined as an array of integers (range 0-23 that defaults to an empty array, so that no hour is disabled if the option is not used when initializing the plugin).\nThen it's necessary to update the ClockPicker.prototype.setHand function in this way (line 8137 of the dist/js/materialize.js file) by adding:\nif(isHours && $.inArray(value,options.disabledHours)>-1)\nreturn;\nSince in my case it was enough to disable hours, first of all there is the check to verify if the setHand is actually working on the hours part of the picker and if so we also check if the computed hour (stored into value) is one of the hour of the day we included inside the disabledHours array.\nWith this fix, everytime the picker is moved over a disabled hour  the hand is not drawn and the value is not selected, so the picked hour value is not updated (as a matter of fact we have disabled picking some hours).\nTo enhance visually the picker I also used the afterShow callback to add a grey-text class to the elements (get by using $(\".clockpicker-dial.clockpicker-hours .clockpicker-tick\") ) inside the disabled range.\nWhat could be improved\nWell... a lot! :)\nFIrst of all, if we drag the mouse/touch over a disabled hour, the selected input remains the last valid hour where we moved the cursor/finger.\nIf the mouseup event is fired the picker switches immediately to the minutes view keeping the \"old but correct\" value. \nMaybe could be useful to disable the switch to the minutes view unless the mouseup event occurs over a valid hour (or maybe not... it's still acceptable this way and the left side of the picker shows the selected hour anyway so it's quite clear what has been selected/accepted as valid input)\nThen it could be interesting to add some sort of visual feedback if the user released the mouse/touch over a disabled hour.\nMore ideas:\n\nbe able to implement intervals instead of listing all the hours we need to disable (like the from: 'someValue', to: 'someOtherValue' used in pickadate.js\ndisable values even on the minutes view, but it could be tricky because each hour can have a different set of minutes to disable\n\n. Here you are: https://codepen.io/devsware/pen/XgQPbR\nOn the javascript tab:\n\nline 7921: the default options of pickatime is extended with the disabledHours variable (it defaults to an empty array, so that if the option isn't specified during initialization, no hour will be disabled)\nline 8140, you can find my fix.\n\nAt the end of the javascript tab there is the plugin initialization with the new disabledHours option and the greying out of the disabled hours inside the afterShow callback.\nIf you try the picker you will find that you cannot position the hour hand over the disabled hours..

You can use $('.picker__holder ')   instead of  $('.picker ')\nTo keep focus on the days when the calendar is open:\nonOpen: function() {\n            $('.picker__day').attr(\"tabindex\",\"0\");\n          }.

As far as I understand the problem is that Meteor 1.6 uses Node 8 which is only supported on node-sass 4.5.3 upwards. Materialize uses node-sass 4.5.2 therefore doesn't work with Meteor 1.6\nIf that's the case would you consider moving to a newer version of node-sass?. Cloning Materialize gives me package.json with 4.5.2.\nMeteor works only when I manually change it to 4.5.3, as suggested.. @DanielRuf you are correct. There is a caret in package.json and ^4.5.3 in package-lock.json\nIs there a reason not to put ^4.5.3 in package.json?. @dryhurst it works for me when I clone it into the packages folder in my project's root directory.. Does it matter that node-sass in package-lock.json is under grunt-sass and not a \"direct\" dependency of materialize?. ",
    "Zep18": "But not here  https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/package.json\nTo fix the issue:\nClone materialize repo in /packages in your meteor directory, then edit package.json and edit line 51 from  \"node-sass\": \"^4.5.2\", to  \"node-sass\": \"^4.5.3\",\nNow meteor add materialize:materialize works. If you want to manually do it as I suggested, it's in \"your meteor project\"/packages (Create it if not exist)\nI had a problem with version alpha 1, but it work when I switched to master (git checkout master). ",
    "bprinsloo": "Is this something that will be fixed in the foreseeable future with a full release? This doesn't work at all as it stand with Meteor 1.6, and this include creating a brand new project. I made it work by creating a folder called \"packages\" under my meteor project, and cloned the master git into this new folder. After that it ran. \n. ",
    "ccornici": "Same error here on 1.6. Is there any workaround to not being able to install this package in meteor? I tried to install the npm one but it seems to not be working as expected even tho I did:\nimport 'materialize-css/dist/css/materialize.min.css'\nimport 'hammerjs/hammer.min.js'\nimport 'materialize-css/dist/js/materialize.min.js'\nin main.js (those are the only things I imported so far). Does anyone know what I need to import (from npm package since the materialize package for Meteor is still broken when trying to run \"meteor add materialize:materialize\") to make the Materialize Modals work? I took the first example from the Materialize website and threw it in a template and the button that should open the modal is displayed but clicking it does not open the modal, my imports are the ones that I posted 2 posts above this one, imported \nBTW: the waves effect on the button works, and I have no console errors when clicking the button. @DanielRuf Yes, but apparently in the wrong place (main.js, then Template.name.onCreated), I moved it now in Template.name.onRendered (hopefully this is the best practice to init js stuff) and it works.\nIt is related to node-sass because I'm still using the npm package instead of the atmosphere package as a workaround to the current bug that's preventing everyone from using the atmosphere package and I thought I might be missing some imports to make the npm package work and thus if anyone else would've gotten that issue they could've read this post and potentially fix it.\nI also want to mention that I have low to 0 experience with npm, Meteor, atmosphere etc. and I'm trying to see how can I make all this work (npm package with meteor).\nAnyway, thanks for the reply.. @DanielRuf do you know when a release with the fix will be available for download on Atmosphere?.

So out of the zone of responsibility, that the guys themselves are redoing the script .... And also I would not do origin.css (\"width\") and origin.css (\"height\"), because someone has an adaptive design.. But because of this there is a problem that the placeholder when the image is open has dimensions of 0 to 0 and pictures and other pictures become the place of the one that we called. There is a negative effect.. It is necessary to give dimensions to the placeholder class at the moment of clicking on the preview, because the size of the preview and the original picture may differ. The placeholder should be left with dimensions, and not be empty so that other pictures on it do not jump and take its place. It's visually not very nice to see.. Why not origin.removeAttr ('class'); ? When you delete the active, there is an empty class attribute.. ",

Okay, so it seems that it works under \"normal\" conditions.\nIt doesn't work when put into a collapsible which is initially folded. \nIn that case the height is (line height * character count). So If the field has only one Character, all looks fine. With three characters the field has a height of 76px!\nThat's because the collapsible-body is display: none; and so the width of the inner elements is not reliable. The textarea has then a 0-width and therefore the text breaks after each character which causes to get the field super height.\nMy solution for now would be to call M.textareaAutoResize() on onOpenEnd.

Resolve it removing materialize from meteor and add the npm package unstead.\nThis atmosphere version is a good idea, but unfortunately it does not work properly. @minhna, you need:\n1 - install the npm package\nmeteor npm install materialize-css@next\n2 - in main.js import materialize and set global (that way you don\u00b4t need to import in every file)\nimport Materialize from 'materialize-css';\nglobal.M = global.Materialize = Materialize;\n3 - in mais.scss, import materialize sass\n@import \"{}/node_modules/materialize-css/sass/materialize.scss\";. To help with inicializations, I set one folder in my project call \"materialize-helpers\" to set every change or js inicialization\ninside that folder I set one file for js and another for html templates\nfor exemple, to start floating action buttons:\nIn helper.html\n<template name=\"floatingActionButton\">\n  <div id=\"floatingActionButton-{{this.id}}\" class=\"fixed-action-btn {{this.class}}\">\n    {{> Template.contentBlock}}\n  </div>\n</template>\nIn helper.js\nTemplate.floatingActionButton.onRendered(function(){\n  var elem = document.getElementById('floatingActionButton-' + this.data.id);\n  M.FloatingActionButton.init(elem, this.data);\n});\nThan every time that i need to start this:\n{{#floatingActionButton id='buttonID' hoverEnabled=false class=\"my-custom-class\" ....  }} // pass the js options in here\n  <a class=\"btn-floating btn-large red\">\n    <i class=\"large material-icons\">mode_edit</i>\n  </a>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating red\"><i class=\"material-icons\">insert_chart</i></a></li>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating yellow darken-1\"><i class=\"material-icons\">format_quote</i></a></li>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating green\"><i class=\"material-icons\">publish</i></a></li>\n    <li><a class=\"btn-floating blue\"><i class=\"material-icons\">attach_file</i></a></li>\n  </ul>      \n{{/floatingActionButton}}. @minhna, a quick solution could be copy the path 'sass' from npm_modules to your client folder\nWhen I import the scss I just import in main.scss and it work's on every sass that I import from npm_modules.

Ok I figured this out, but it's no surprise that this is catching a lot of people out - I noticed two other similar threads that were closed without proper resolution. For full disclosure, I'm actually using the startup theme, which also requires an amendment to the init.js file. These are the steps:\n1) Create a new Task to include uglify (or amend the existing js_compile task on line 661)\nIn the Gruntfile.js, add the following task on line 672:\ngrunt.registerTask('ugly', ['concat:temp', 'configureBabel', 'babel:bin', 'clean:temp', 'uglify']);\nthe js_compile task is missing uglify for some reason - it compiles without minifying. I added 'uglify' to the end, and in this instance I created a new task called ugly.\n2) Comment out the unwanted components (lines 192 to 220 of Gruntfile.js)\nNote that the components appear twice, first in 'dist' (lines 152 to 180) and then in 'temp' (lines 192 to 220). The src files in dist appear to have no effect, so I left them as they are. They do not affect the final file size. Also note that some of the components are probably global, and need to be left in. I left the first 4, and also dropdown, sidenav, scrollspy, forms, cards and buttons.\n3) Comment out the unwanted components from Global.js\nGlobal is itself a component, but contains references to the other components on lines 111 to 128. Comment out the unused ones. I left in Dropdown, Scrollspy and Sidenav.\n4) Amend init.js (where applicable)\nIf using the Startup theme, or if there is an init.js in your project, take care of the unwanted components - for me it was lines 7 to 45. Again I left in dropdown-trigger, scrollspy and button-collapse.\n5) Run ''ugly' from the command line \nThis should now generate a much lighter materialize.min.js in the bin folder. I got down from 171KB to 63KB. Chrome coverage is still telling me that 70% of this is unused but an improvement nonetheless.\n. ",

The process that I did is to make two dropdown content for small and large scale device.\nHence, web_ver-historical id raises two ids web_ver-historical_small and web_ver-historical_large.\nWhich this concludes that I made two seperate dropdown content both exclusively for small and large scale device.\nRealization\nWarning : Poor Explaination\nAlthough in the process of recreating my work, I found out that using only one dropdown content both for small and large scale device seems that it will likely to fail to calculate or to execute getComputedStyle due of complex reasons. Although I can't explain it yet because I don't know how would I said it. But to make clue it seems the 'getComputedStyle' only execute contents on one side-device scale. It cannot compute for both large and small scale, but only one type (large or small) for the content. So in overall, I cannot initiate it both for small and large (because I think it is confusing case and for the function as well), but only for  only. Which concludes the raise of two IDs that I stated from above. One for Large Scale and one for Small Scale.\nIn reply response\nI'm not sure that two button holders for dropdown would interfere from calculating the style. Anyway, specifying container class wouldn't resolve the problem I guess, I tried and it doesn't override the movement.\nThank you for your reply and I would likely to apologize for constructing poor explanation or statement but I hope you would understand.

The specific line can be seen here:\nhttps://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/v1-dev/js/datepicker.js#L144\nAs a workaround, you can probably split the date and call setDate to fix initial position, something like this:\nfor(el of elems){\n  var picker = M.Datepicker.getInstance(el);\n  var splitDate = el.value.split(\"/\");\n  picker.setDate(splitDate[1] + \"/\" + splitDate[0] + \"/\" + splitDate[2], true);\n}\nif #6106 ever gets merged, it would be nicer to set the starting date with a custom formatter..

The best solution is just to ignore any <select> that sweeetalert2 should use, just like I did in my proposed solution.\nEdit: I don't see this as a bug from either side, it is just how it works, you are not supposed to set every select to materialize, or another option is to add the class browser-default, which will not create the extra elements, thus it should abide by your display: none.. @gverni if we are strictly looking at documentation, they only talk about starting all, maybe for convenience, as seen here:\nhttps://materializecss.com/select.html#initialization\nTo that effect, you can still not get the materialize select by adding the class I mentioned..

It's also quite annoying that the left side bar of the date picker wobbles because it's not fixed size (and the font isn't monospaced). For example \"Thu, Sep 20\" takes more space than \"Fri, Sep 21\". While this isn't a bug, it could be fixed for the new release. I can create another ticket, if you're interested in adjusting this behavior.. @drewrwilson I haven't been keeping track of the development, so I'm not sure if there's been a regression in the code. What you could do to fix this yourself is edit the scss and manually patch with either my quick and dirty suggestion from above or the fix suggested by @hnordberg.. @drewrwilson Glad it worked. The clean way of doing the modification is to edit the _datepicker.scss and compile it to the css file using a SASS compiler.. I think this really depends on your personal preferences and the toolchain you're using. Without endorsing a specific vendor, there are IDEs that can auto-compile SCSS. Once you have your IDE configured it shouldn't be much of a hassle to edit the variables for the color scheme and the color variables.. This is the same issue as in #6002.

The issue is that materialize is replacing all the style of all the select tags in the DOM, regardless of any previously set style.

This has nothing to do with Sweetalert2 and the same issue would happen if there was an hidden select tag anywhere in the HTML page. \nIMHO it's not a good practice to blindly replace the style. Materialize should only change the style attributes needed to style the element, and leave the other (e.g. display) unchanged. . > I don't see this as a bug from either side, it is just how it works, you are not supposed to set every select to materialize\nIf this is the case, then I agree with you @leomoty.

    "robrechta": "I'm working with vue, and have no jquery availble. So I tried to add the select (with class=\"browser-default\") to the body in the 'mounted' step, but it didn't changed anything. At first I thought it worked, but after reloading the page, the dropdown is still not scrollable with the mouse scroll wheel as described above.. @frostless I've tried different solutions, but I see no changes...\n- I've added the select element in the html-body, and did an M.Autoinit in the mounted step, in the updated step, ... all no effect\n- I've added the select in the beginning of the body, in the end of the body.... (no luck here)\n- I've added the select element with document.createElement function, together with the M.Autoinit,... also no effect\nThe one thing that I did notice, I have the dropdown in a form with multiple fields. When I click with the mouse in some random textfields, and then in the dropdown, the scrollable-functionality in the dropdown is back. Maybe this can be usefull in finding the solution.\n~~Update: I've found another work-arround. After the dropdown.open() is called, I've called the function recalculateDimensions. The width collapes to the minimum => the scrollable area is smaller => no scrolling possible in whitespace. The look of the dropdown is a little bit worse, because it's smaller then the input box, but there is almost no scrolling problem more. There is still a little bit of space where you cannot scroll.~~\nUpdate2: previous update had some side effects, better workarround is calling recalculateDimensions(); in the onOpenEnd callback.  .
