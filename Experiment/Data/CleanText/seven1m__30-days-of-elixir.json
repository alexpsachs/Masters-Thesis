Thanks!!\n. Sorry I haven't played with Elixir since version 0.13, but it appears that the list comprehension syntax changed before 1.0 was released. It appears that this:\nsome = lc n inlist sample, String.first(n) < \"M\", do: n <> \" Morgan\"\n...should become this:\nsome = for n <- sample, String.first(n) < \"M\", do: n <> \" Morgan\"\nSee here: http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/18.html\nI haven't tried this, but if it works, would you make a Pull Request to fix it?

Great thanks!\n. @eddwardo this same thing was done on day 24. I'd like to leave it there as it's a more advanced topic.\n. Looks great! With exception of the regex feedback, would merge.\n. Great!
