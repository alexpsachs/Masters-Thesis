    "ericdrowell": "Awesome!  I've been meaning to do that.  I'll probably pull these changes in this weekend.\n. great questions!  Yes, I haven't made this Github project official yet because I'm still new to Github and getting my feet wet :)\n1) I'll be making the Github project official very soon, probably within a week or so.\n2) I do already have plans to document the config object more fully (it's also already documented on html5canvastutorials.com)\n3) I use jsdoc toolkit now (as of like a few days ago) and it's been working out great.  Here's the new docs page: http://www.kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Stage.php\n4) I still haven't decided yet about the best place to report bugs.  I'm leaning towards using Github and removing the Bugs Forum\n5) haven't put thought into tagging yet\n6) absolutely.  I'm setting things up on Github because a lot of people are requesting it (so they can manage forks) and so people can help contribute and get more involved (KineticJS is growing very rapidly and it's becoming too big of a project to be managed by one person)\nCheers!\n. Antoine, I was going to message you with a request, but it appears that you don't have messaging enabled on GitHub, or maybe you don't have an email address tied to your account.  At any rate, if you're able to see this message even after the pull request is closed, I wanted to see if you could do these:\n1) modify the rake file so that all of the comments are stripped out correctly for the minified version (for some reason the GlobalObject comments are still there)\n2) is it possible to add a version number to the build command, something like \"3.8.3\" and the rake file can auto update the license.js page, perhaps with a token (i.e. @version@)\n3) is it also possible to automatically update the date in the license.js file?\nCheers\n. Awesome, that sounds great!  Thanks so much for putting this together.  Would also be cool if after we pass in a version number \"e.g. 3.8.3\", it would also rename the dist files like this:\nkinetic-v3.8.3.js\nkinetic-v3.8.3.min.js\nCheers!\n. Brilliant!  Works perfectly!\n. Great suggestion.  This is something that's been on my mind for awhile, and have been planning on adding soon.  Any special requests on how you'd like for it to be handled?  To keep things simple, I don't think I'll be supporting event capturing (only event bubbling).  I figured we could do something like this:\nshape.on(\"click\", function(e) {\n    // do stuff\n    e.stopPropagation();\n}\nDo you think this is sufficient?\n. Sounds good!  Hopefully I'll get this added in soon.\n. Hiya!  Have you tried using Groups?  Groups enables you to create complex shapes by grouping multiple regular shapes.  In essence, a group is a shape that can have multiple paths.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-a-group-with-kineticjs/\n. Yes, I investigated this technique a long time ago because on the surface it sounds like a great idea.  However, the performance is horrible.  In fact, if you start using more than like 10 images, the whole app will start to break down pretty rapidly. \n. That's a pretty good idea (storing the pixel data for an image once and reusing the array).\nI just realized that it would be awesome to add a new property to the Kinetic.Image object, \"detectionType\", which could be set to \"path\" or \"pixel\".  This way developers can choose.  Thanks for the discussion, and great demo btw!\n. Thanks for posting this!  This is a known bug that hasn't been fixed yet - it's slightly lower on the priority list at the moment, but should hopefully get put in soon.\nCheers!\n. Well in that case, I'll have the issue fixed by this weekend and bundle it with the v3.8.4 release :)\n. oh and by the way, if you need the fix even faster, you can try making a change in the _getContainerPosition() method in Stage.js.  This method is not taking into account div scroll offsets, only the window scroll offset :)\n. sweet, if you drop by the Bay area let me know and I'll take you up on that!  Btw the fix for this has been checked in :)\n. Can you post your code on a web server somewhere so I can take a look at it there? (since you're saying that the code works on jsfiddle but not your local) KineticJS should be supporting scrollable containers and scrollable parent DOMS.  Thanks!\n. ah, you're not the first person to have problems with the styling of the container node (non dispay:relative styles).  I'll look into this a bit more.\n. great!  glad you got it working\n. have you tried using the dragBounds property?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-bounds-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. right, and that was sort of my thinking.  In other words, I'm trying to keep KineticJS as light as possible so I don't want to implement everything, but I do want to implement things that have a light foot print and is commonly used (like rectangular bounds).  For more special cases, like creating circular bounds, devs could create plugins for that :)\n. Agreed.  I think drag and drop, constraints, and bounds, still need a ton of improvements :)\n. Sweet!  I've been meaning to add a mimeType to the toDataURL method.  Thanks!\n. done and done :)\n. You rock!!  Kudos on updating the unit tests too, I appreciate that :)\n. it's okay, everything's good to go\n. This issue has been addressed in the forums - no fix needed\n. yep, they sure don't :)  The stage is the only Node object that isn't tied to a layer, and currently transitions are tied to each layer for performance reasons.  Originally, I was going to add support for Stage transitions for the next release by tweaking the transition code a bit for the Stage node, but now, I've recently come up with a better way to manage animations + transitions with relation to layers, so I'll be taking that approach now instead.  The new approach will also enable stage transitions for the next release.  Stay tuned!!\n. Following up with this issue - stage transitions are now supported as of v3.9.2\n. No prob!  I'll keep this open for awhile\n. Closing this pull request - If I do end up implementing a full screen method, it will probably leverage the HTML5 full screen API\n. ah, yes Firefox appears to be failing for me.  I'll look into this thanks!!\n. oh, I'm a dope :)  The same text in Firefox and Chrome has slightly different text sizes (due to implementation), so my unit tests shouldn't test for a specific text width.  Thanks!\n. Oh and in regards to the pixel detection, you really can't use a bounding box (because parent nodes can be transformed, causing the child node to be way outside the bounding box)\nAlthough, it actually performs pretty nicely for me because I've enabled the developer to decide when to save the pixel data with the save() method (very expensive).  If you choose good times to save the data, I think the performance should be okay.  What sort of test case were you using?\nmy example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-animals-on-the-beach-game-with-kineticjs/\n. After a bit of exploration, I found that the root problem was with the getAbsolutePosition() method.  It should not have been taking into account center offset transforms.  Issue is now fixed :)\n. Perfect!  I had plans on implementing rounded corners in exactly the way that you've done (I wanted it to be a config property, not a new shape).  I'll pull this in soon.  Thanks!\n. Your work made it to v3.9.4 and I gave you credit in the change log.  Thanks again!\n. This is good stuff!  However, is it possible that you could move most of this logic to Kinetic.Line, and add a new line property called \"lineStyle\" that's defaulted to \"normal\", and devs can set it to \"dashed\" if they want a dashed line.  I'd like for KineticJS to have as few shapes as possible.\nIn the future, I also wanted to add support for lineStyle: \"dotted\" which would draw small circles instead of lines along the line path.\nCheers!\n. status update - I'm currently doing a little bit of research to see what other implementations look like, and will most likely be merging some of your work with some other ideas I've been finding as well.  I really like that you have the ability to animate the dashed line, pretty slick.\n. I ended up using a method by Phrogz which is only about 30 lines of code, and enables an unlimited amount of dashed and dotted lines with varying dash lengths and spacings for each alternate.  This will provide quite a bit of flexibility. \nThanks so much for digging into this with me!\n. Nicely done!!!  I was planning on working on Node.js support at some point.  As soon as I get a chance, I'll look over the changes and pull in it.\nThanks again!\n. added these changes to the nodejs branch.  I'll spend a little time later doing further testing and taking a closer look.  Very exciting stuff!!\n. Hiya!  It hasn't really been supported, as of yet.  If I understand correctly, there's not too much effort that has to go in to get it working.  I've had plans to add support, along with a suite of unit tests, but other priorities have been bubbling on top of it.  Hopefully I'll have this addressed soon (possibly with the next release or so)\n. sorry for the headache guys.  Really hoping to officially add node.js support soon.\n. absolutely possible, just a matter of time :)\n. Yea, I've taken a couple weeks off from KineticJS dev.  I have a whole slew of things that I'll be working on during xmas break :P\n. well, turns out that the native max width w3c spec really sucks.  I don't like that the text scales rather than being cut off (similar to html text inside of a div element with a max width).  Also, the changes didn't incorporate the bounding box dimensions.\nso, I ended up reworking the logic to use clipping rather than the native text scaling.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/05df07829533fa1de3b6a6e23da05845586c1a2f\nThanks for getting these changes rolling!\nCheers\n. Thanks for this!  After a bit more thought, I've decided that the API should look like this:\ncornerRadius:5 -> causes all 4 corners to have radius of 5\ncornerRadius: [1,2,3,4] -> causes top left corner radius to be 1, top right to be 2, etc.  \nI'll put together a mashup of some of your work plus this API.  \nThanks again!\n. still not fully following your use case.  Could you expand on it a bit?\nCheers!\n. Follow up:\nI've replaced the Circle Shape with Ellipse, which enables you to define a radius like this for circles:\nradius: 10\nand a radius like this for ovals:\nradius: {\n   x: 10,\n   y: 5\n}\nIt's much cleaner to transform the context than to connect several bezier curves.  Check out the Ellipse shape in the source to see how it looks\nCheers!\n. hi thanks for looking into this!  It turns out that I'm in the process of exposing attr change events internally and externally, which means that KineticJS is becoming more event driven.  I've added a widthChange and heightChange listener to the stage that listens for dimension changes, and when they occur, the DOM dimensions are synced.  This enables us keep a lot of node specific logic out of the setAttrs method and greatly decouples the code base\nCheers!\n. updated on this issue - I've added an on size change listener that updates the DOM dimensions whenever the stage dimensions change, so this issue should be resolved :)\nCheers!\n. very nice changes!  As soon as I get a chance, I'll look into pulling these in and check out the code a bit more closely.  Great work!\n. Thanks for this!  You've done some great work.  Unfortunately though, I've already begun a total Kinetic.Text rewrite.  Now that (I think) I fully understand what most people need from the Text shape, I decided to do a full rewrite of the shape to make it very clean and elegant.  Word wrap will be added very soon.  \nCheers!\n. Hiya!  This problem should be resolved with the latest version of KineticJS.  I went though and cleaned up undefined, null, 0, and empty string usage.  If you now set any attr to undefined, nothing will happen.  If you set an attr to null, 0, or empty string, the attr will be disregarded.\ne.g. if you set image to null, it won't be drawn.\n. Hi again, this issue has been resolved with v3.10.2\nif you set any attr to null, 0, or '', the attr will be ignored.  If you set an attr to undefined, nothing will happen.\nCheers!\n. I'll take a look at this one as soon as I get a chance!\nCheers!\nEric\n. adding this to the next release.  Thanks!\n. There still seems to be some issues with remove() in general, so I'm going to do a full blown reinvestigation of it.  Sorry for this!  All of the issues should be resolved by the next version, 4.3.1.  I think that I get more bug reports related to remove() than anything else, so it's clearly not designed well.  Thanks for being patient! \n. very likely.  I also have a todo item for the next release that involves creating some memory performance tests around remove().  Hopefully we'lll get it cleaned up and working seamlessly soon\n. wait, did you mean layer.remove() doesn't work?  the remove method does not take in an argument:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#remove\nI looked very closely at my layer.remove() tests, and they are passing correctly\n. hiya!  Are you referring to animations specifically?  The event stress tests seem to performing well still.  I'll look into this asap!\n. Here's some eventing stress tests which still seem to perform well:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-10000-shape-stress-test-with-kineticjs/\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-drag-and-drop-stress-test-with-1000-shapes/\n. sweet!  Glad to hear.\nP.S. The current build has +7% drawing performance, and I have a lot of other peformance improvements lined up for the next few releases.  i.e. KineticJS should keep getting faster and faster :)\n. Thanks!  this change looks really good.  As soon as I get the chance I'll pull it in and create some unit tests for it\n. ah good one.  Thanks for letting me know!  I'll get this one fixed up asap.\nCheers!\n. Just tested this use case, and the problem seems to have been resolved.  Please let me know if you're still experiencing this problem!\n. Hiya!  Thanks for this.  I've actually already begun re-writing the Text shape, including a new API for alignment.  align and verticalAlign now refer to the text's alignment relative to its containing text box (which makes a heck of a lot more sense).  Rounded corners are also now available since the Text shape is now a Group which utilizes the Rect shape for the text box.  Word wrap will be coming soon as well.\n. Hiya!  This is technically a bug because the attribute is present in the code, but is not used yet.  It will be working by v4.3.3\n. Awesome point!  That does really suck.  I'll add this to my todo list.\nCheers!\nEric\n. fixed in v3.10.2!  Thanks again for pointing that out\nCheers!\nEric\n. Hiya!  Yea, I noticed that before - my formatter for some reason screws up that line.  I tried multiple variations without success.  Went ahead and changed the else if to an else, and inside the else block used an if block.  Very strange!\n. Great point.  I'll look into a better solution asap\nCheers!\n. Fixed!  At first glance, I thought that John's inheritance implementation was too complex for what I needed, but after trying to implement it myself I realized that it was spot on.  I added his Class function to Class.js in the util folder and am now extending all parent nodes with it.  Works like a charm!\nCheers!\n. great idea.  I'll add this the todo list\n. following up with this thread - Kinetic.Text added support for the \\n character to force word wrap.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-text-tutorial/\n. Great point!  Assuming that Shapes are typically the node whose visibility is toggled on and off (in contrary to to groups, layers, or stage), this would certainly be nice performance improvement.  Just pushed to change and gave you props.\nThanks!\n. cool work!  I like where you're going with this, but isn't the concept of your Style class the same thing as just storing styles as an object like this:\nvar myStyle = {\n    fill: 'blue',\n    stroke: 'red'\n}\nand then applying that style to any node via setAttrs\ncircle.setAttrs(myStyle);\nI've been meaning to create a clone method, and what you have is pretty close to what I had imagined as well, with the exception that the clone method might also need to clone event handlers and other non attr properties.  I'll take a closer look at this when I get a chance\nThanks for looking into this!\nEric\n. Thanks for getting the ball rolling!  There's quite a few things that still needed to change, so I went ahead and created my version of the clone method here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/a8ab9a253348f9628e60727bf67f0839aeb58253\nI'll mention you in the change log for getting this rolling\nHere are a few things that needed to change with your implementation:\n- we don't want to copy over all of the object properties (such as _id, because this is a unique node identifier)\n- we also don't want to directly copy over the eventListeners property because some of the listeners are generated from class constructors, and we don't want to override these handlers with the original objects handlers\n- I wanted to make sure that the constructor is called for proper object initialization using the 'new' keyword\n- we don't need to manually do a deep copy to copy over the attrs because each class initializer uses the setAttrs method to set the attrs, which automatically does a deep copy\nThanks again!\nCheers\n. Hiya!  Actually KineticJS works very similarly to that.  Check out this tutorial\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-remove-event-listener-by-name-with-kineticjs/\n. right, that makes sense.  I think that's a reasonable request :)  I'll add it to my todo list\nCheers!\n. Hey sorry, this is still in my todo list but it's been lower in priority than other tasks. It'll get in there I promise. In the meantime, would you be interested in making th change for us, and submitting a pull request?\n. fixed as of v4.0.3 courtesy of Davonium.  Thanks!\n. hi there!  All shape radii should be centered on the shape's perimeter, such that the shape radius should be equal to or larger than the inner stroke radius.  Is this what you're referring to?  If not, maybe you could create a jsfiddle showing the behavior, or provide a screenshot.\nCheers!\n. Ellipse strokes seem to be working fine in FF now http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-ellipse-tutorial/\n. Hiya!  Thanks for looking into this.  At the time being, I don't really want to support automatic image loading, because different apps may need to load images in different ways depending on what's needed, and I don't want to go down the route of supporting all kinds of different image loading strategies (e.g. load all images, then draw the whole stage at once, draw each image as soon as it's available and manage layering and redrawing, combinations of the two, etc.)\nI've found that it's much more straight forward to let the developer manage image loading and drawing themselves.  Plus, I'm trying to keep KineticJS as light weight as possible, and since image loading really has nothing to do with canvas (there are hundreds of other image loading libraries out there), I feel like adding the logic would add extra bloat.\nI'll keep an open mind though - may need to revisit this and incorporate image loading at a later time\nCheers!\n. hey Jason, I pulled in the new TextShape (awesome by the way), and moved the non-primitive shapes to the plugins folder.  Was wondering if you could possibly make a few changes to the Path and TextPath shape, if you get the chance.  If not, I can take a look sometime next week:\n1) I would like for Shape drawFunc functions to not be overridden by children classes (the TextPath class extends Path, but then overrides its drawing function).  In other words, if something were to extend a particular shape, it shouldn't override anything in its initializer, it should only add or modify methods.\nThat being said, maybe it's more appropriate if the TextPath shape directly extends Shape like all of the other shapes, but simply inherits some of the Path methods\n2) I noticed that you made the Path shape much heavier in preparation for TextPath support.  I would like for the Path shape to be as lean as possible, and not assume that another class will be using it for something.  Is it possible for all of the extra logic you added to reside in the TextPath shape somehow?  It feels like the Path class suddenly became very bloated, and I was actually hoping to spend some time later on improving on its performance\n3) is it possible you could also use jslint or jshint on the shapes so that the JS code style is similar to the other plugins? (What you and I are building here are the officially supported KineticJS plugins)\nWhat do you think?\n. awesome. keep rockin :)\n. Whoops, you're right, we should add them to Kinetic.Plugins\n. wow guys that's a lot of +1's!  I'll take this a bit more seriously and revisit\n. finally getting around to looking into this again :)\nthanks for the patience\n. Thanks for getting this rolling!  I ended up using a more generic technique for supporting AMD + node.js with one shim from this:\nhttps://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExports.js\nand here's the AMD support commit + special test:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ab19b442a00a3261c68c71683eb5b80a0558a5b3\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/266026c76f5d16788c0fe48303c81332071b2a72\nPlease let me know if this looks good to you, or if any further changes need to be made.  Thanks!\n. Hiya!  Thanks for the detailed response.\nYes, I've been thinking about how to handle the global access for users who\ndon't use AMD (which I'm assuming is most users), and I realized that I can\njust define Kinetic in the global namespace only if AMD or node are not\nbeing used.  I'll make this change soon.\nCheers!\nEric\nOn Mon, Dec 3, 2012 at 10:44 PM, michaelgilley notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nHey Eric, thank you for supporting this. There are a few issues though.\nThese are non-critical but still yet they should be addressed. If you'd\nlike me to add these as new issues just let me know.\nFirst, the Kinetic should be hidden from the global namespace. It looks\nlike in Global.js line 31 Kinetic is left outside of the wrapper. Part of\nthe power of AMD (requirejs) is to contain libraries/modules within the AMD\nwrapper and be used through direct require instead of reference to the root\nnamespace. This is why the UMD spec you included defaults to assigning\nKinetic to the root (window) namespace IF define and exports are undefined.\nIf define is a function then Kinetic should not be accessible via the\nwindow object, only through requiring the module.\nIf you'd like to keep Kinetic in the global namespace independent of\nwhether define exists or not that's fine. Plenty of libraries/frameworks do\nthis (e.g., jQuery, Underscore, etc.) You can see an UMD example of this at\nhttps://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExportsGlobal.js. However,\nit would be best practice to also provide a noConflict method to the\nlibrary for developers who would prefer to remove its footprint from the\nglobal namespace and thus save from any potential library naming conflicts.\nSecond, now when loading Kinetic without AMD it stores a reverence to the\nlibrary under window.returnExports (Global.js line 110). This needs to be\nchanged to root.Kinetic. The UMD spec did not intend for returnExports to\nactually be used. Again, this is why var Kinetic should be contained\nwithin the factory function scope referenced in Global.js line 112. It's\nintended to be made global on this line if exports and define prove\nundefined.\nThird, as is Kinetic is stored under root and so makes irrelevant the\nwrapper functions on each Kinetic module. I assume you added these for the\ncustom build feature you offer on your site? If they are treated as\nindividual modules this is where you can truly leverage the power of AMD by\nusing a define function with each of those modules and requiring their\ndependencies respectively.\nThanks for all the work!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/47#issuecomment-10986235.\n. Just so I don't forget, could you open up a bug and copy and paste your comment?  This way, when I make changes, you'll now where to find them\n. P.S. I absolutely don't want to include the require.js library within KineticJS because its 12K (in order to leverage it for dependency management), so I definitely won't be using it internally.\n. This is a great change!  Thanks so much for fixing this, and for adding a nicely constructed unit test.\n\nCheers!\n. Have you tried the demo in it's own window? (click open in new window).  Sometimes the Flash ads can temporarily slow down page.\nWhat browser are you using?\n. ah yes.  Unfortunately, I've been battling with Chrome to get some performance issues fixed that were introduced a few months ago (via bug reports), but they are still having some issues.  In fact, I introduced the layer throttling logic specifically to fix Chrome's issue (or at least greatly improve it).  Even with the throttling in place, I've noticed that in some situations, the cursor can lag behind a shape when dragging and dropping in Chrome.  I may need to dig into it a bit deeper to see if there's something else can be done. (P.S. I bet if you try the demo in Firefox, Safari, and believe it or not IE9, you won't see the lagging).\n. tell me about it.  it's a real downer\nthe layer throttling logic is KineticJS specific logic that's applied to non animation situations, such as drag and drop.\n. One of their releases killed canvas performance, so if you try to draw something simple say 200 times per second, it starts to lag behind (this can occur with drag and drop because shapes are redrawn each time the mousemove event is fired).  To remedy the problem, I added layer throttling which reduces layer draws if they start exceeding a certain threshold.  This is why sometimes you may start to see lagging every now and then when using Chrome, in which case the throttling kicks in and the layer draws are dynamically reduced.\n. Has anyone else tried the KineticJS demos lately with v4?  v4 made tremendous performance improvements since v3\n. Thank you so much for looking into this!  And sorry I wasn't able to address this sooner, there's been a million things going on with KineticJS since this pull request.  Since the Animation logic has changed so drastically, I'll take another look at this soon and make sure that the race condition has been resolved.  thanks again!!\n. Hiya!  I actually have plans to add chaining in lots of different places, but it's been lower on my priority list at the moment.  stay tuned!\n. Nice!!  Thanks so much for this\n. remember, that since custom shapes have no point of reference, their position is relative to the top left corner of the canvas context.  To define its center, you need to draw the custom shape around the top left corner of the canvas context\n. fixed!  Thanks for catching this\n. Thanks!  I missed that one\n. ah, microsoft!  Why are they implementing non w3c standard events?  I almost don't want to add support for them just because they aren't standard.  Will have to put some thought into this :)\n. haha true.  Well it's on my todo list, so hopefully I'll add it in soon.  It probably won't be too much effort\nCheers!\n. great idea, I'll put some thought into this.\n. as a side note, don't forget that you can scale the entire stage.  In other words, I think it's fairly common for people to create fixed size stages, and then set the canvas width and height via setWidth() and setHeight(), and then scale the context via setScale() so that the stage filles up the screen.  This would be more predictable, and have better performance, then trying to calculate the relative heights, widths, offsets, nested translations, etc., for every shape on the stage\n. I've had several people bring this up, so maybe it would make more sense for me to create a tutorial on how to do this :)\n. somethings wonky with this pull request - it's showing that every line in Path was modified.  I'll commit the change.  Thanks!\n. So very very sorry - I haven't forgotten about this pull request, just put it on the back burner because filters were lower priority a couple months ago.  Will look at this soon!\n. Oh yea, I was planning on eventually having a dozen or so Filters.  Just haven't gotten around to getting them put together.  I also need to add support for passing parameters in, so there's a bit of work left to do.\n. Thanks for getting this started!  Since the Filter API changed a bit, I went ahead and reimplemented it from scratch.  Will still give you credit in the change log for getting this going.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/b76cc09742b6d7ea81596b810f1277d2cbe34be3\nThanks!!\n. Actually this is up to the developer.  Filters are used to modify the current image.  If a developer wants to store images before and after, they can save it as a variable.\n. would you mind trying out v4.0.0?  The filter logic was rewritten so the problem may be resolved.\nJust let me know!\nCheers\n. coming soon :)\n. nice catch!  I hadn't thought of that scenario\n. I like where you're going with this, but there are a couple of big changes that I'd like to make:\n1) I want to create a reusable rounded corner path method in the Rect shape that Image can leverage when doing the clipping.\n2) I want the rounded corners to be specified as an array rather than an object, like [12, 0, 10, 15], or [12, 10], or 12 for  all corners to be rounded with a 12px radius.\n. not yet, this is bit of a lower priority than other items.\n. I'll be adding all of the corner radius enhancements in the next release, v4.4.4.  Hopefully, I'll be able to find a clean, consistent solution to handle corner radius for rect, image, and Label, without adding overhead.  Thanks again for working on this with me!\n. This is super interesting!!!!  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance\n. nice work!  This is working exactly as I had hoped.  merging soon :)\n. heya, I believe that this issue was fixed with this commit:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8883e80bfe88cbe2c92c1de027eb4fd166294e6b\n. could you post a jsfiddle demo showing the behavior?  I need to see some code :)\n. Coming soon! :)\n. thanks for this!  I'll add this to my todo list\nCheers\n. Haven't forgotten about this thread - I'll try to get this fixed up for the next release.  Thanks!\n. After looking into this, I won't fix this after all.  add() and remove() do much more than just add and remove a node from a parent node.  add() updates the global id counter, updates the temp node array, updates the id and name hashes, and updates the pull nodes array.  This logic is intended purely for new nodes added to the stage.  remove() does similar things.  It's purpose it to completely remove a node from the stage.  Therefore, these methods should not be used to move a node from one container into another one.\nWhat exactly are you trying to do?\n. yep, KineticJS is event driven, which mean you have access to all attr changes.  e.g.\nshape.on('xChange yChange scaleChange rotationChange', function() {\n  // do something\n});\n. Isn't this the correct behavior?\nIf you click in the area that intersects the blue circle and the red circle, only the blue circle's event handler and the blue circle's layer's handler should be executed because the blue circle is on top of the red circle.  Node nesting in KineticJS was modeled after DOM nodes.  if you click on a div that's on top of another div, only the top div event handlers will be executed.\nThoughts?\n. thanks for this!  I'll take a look asap.\nAbout the Forums - I have quite a bit of threads to catch up on.  It's not dead, I'm just really behind :)\nAlso, planning on removing the bug forum and utilizing Github for bug tickets.\nCheers!\n. This issue was fixed awhile back, closing this ticket.  If it's still an issue, please reopen :)\n. interesting use case.  I'll add this to my todo list\n. Hiya.  In an effort to make the sprite sheets more flexible, I didn't want to assume that each sprite image would be the same size (the sprite tutorial on html5canvastutorials.com is a good example)  Also, some people implement sprite sheets radially, like for sprites that walk up, right, down, left, and diagonally.  I didn't want to force people to change their sprite sheets to use Kinetic.\n. This was done intentionally.  You're assuming that all sprite sheets are put together in the same way, which is incorrect.  \nI actually expect developers, currently, to write something similar to what you have done to handle the sprite sheets in whatever format that they have them.\n. no worries!  I've been thinking about possibly creating plugins like this for Sprite, but haven't gotten around to it yet :)\n. Update on this thread: based on Davonium's concept, I created a drawBufferFunc which enables devs to create custom hit detection functions.  Here's an example functional test:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/tests/js/functionalTests.js#L862\n. pls see comment with Layer.js pull request\n. what might make more sense is for a node to have a toJSON method and load() method (this will take care of the stage, layers, groups, and shapes).  I'll look into this as soon as I can.  Thanks for putting thought into this!!!!\nEric\n. fixed :)\n. np :)\nv4.0.0 had huge architectural changes, and unfortunately a few nasty bugs like this one snuck past my unit tests.  v4.0.1 is shaping up to be super solid\n. fixed as of v4.0.2\n. you read my mind.  I don't particularly like how multiple stages are currently handled either, and haven't put too much thought into it since as of yet it's been lower on my priority list.  Now that Kinetic is looking pretty solid, I'd like to relook into this.\nWhat if you could manage your stages like this:\nKinetic.remove(stage);\n. added it to the top of my todo list here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Todo-List\nCheers!\n. This should be working as of v4.3.1 via the destroy() method which should work with stages\nstage.destroy();\nIf you still run into issues, please reopen this ticket :)\n. have you tried moving the image to its own layer when dragging and dropping?  This greatly improves performance.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-drag-and-drop-stress-test-with-1000-shapes/\n. but to your point, I'll look into the FF issue as soon as I get a chance.\n. v4.0.5 is already looking pretty heavy, so this issue will probably be addressed with a later version (mostly because it seems to be a FF bug)\n. Although there have been a lot of performance improvements made with drag and drop, this issue is ultimately dependent on the FF Canvas API implementation.  Dragging and dropping a shape filled with a pattern actually performed pretty well for me in FF.\n. Currently I have no plans to support IE8 - this would involve creating an SVG renderer.  If KineticJS becomes popular enough, and there's a huge demand for older browser support, may be forced to support SVG in the future.  Hopefully though, we won't have to do that :)\n. Sorry for the late response!  Seriously.\nI think the correct fix for this is to combine the touchPos and mousePos attributes into a single one, pointerPos.  I'll do that today.\n. That should fix it up.  Let me know if this doesn't solve your problem - assuming that you're still working with KineticJS a year later ;)\n. I'm afraid that enabling devs to specify image sources in addition to image objects will end up causing more confusion - If people are getting confused about the async nature of loading images (this is like JavaScript 101), then they will probably also not understand why images are being drawn out of order when using src. \nfor example, if someone draws a square, an image, and then a triangle, they will end up seeing a square, triangle, and then image.  I'm pretty sure that this would be more confusing.\nI don't think the library should decide for the developer when an image should be rendered.  The developer should control that.\nThoughts?\n. Agreed, if anything, we could add a loader utility in the Utilities directory.  I had considered doing that before, but wanted to keep the library as light weight as possible so I didn't add it in.  But, now that I have plans to create a configurator which will custom builds which just includes the modules that are needed, it may make sense to go ahead and provide the loader, and devs can use it if they want\n. Definitely agree that we need a way to specify which canvas to draw onto for performance reasons - willl look closer at this one soon\n. Haven't forgotten about this thread, and still realize it's very important :)\nHopefully I'll be able to put more thought into this and have a solution by v4.0.5\n. Shoot, I just realized that this is technically already supported.  Just set the listening property to false like this:\nrect.setListening(false);\nNode's that aren't listening to events are not drawn onto the buffer canvas.  Is this an acceptable solution?  \nIn regards to drag and drop - you're right, I could auto stop listening for events while dragging, and then reable listening when drag ends.\n. btw I haven't forgotten about this pull request.  I'm currently rewriting the setAttrs logic in Node to improve the OO design there as.  Once that's set up and working, I plan on making similar changes to the ones that you've suggested here.\nCheers,\nEric\n. Thanks again Davonium, I think overtime most of your suggestions have been accounted for.  Improving the OO design also really helped modularization when it came to supporting the configurator:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/configurator.php\nClosing this pull request - if you find more OO improvements, would you mind submitting a new request?  Thanks!\n. nice work.  I like how the children logic resides in the container rather than inside the clone() method in Node.  very clean\n. heya!  Yea I know that it works, but the thing is, I was planning on setting something up that would work for all methods, not just a select few.  e.g.\nshapes.setX(5);\nnodes.transitionTo(...);\netc.  I'll keep thinking on this\n. Heya!  This is what I was sort of looking for:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8d6103d1e052196ae8958f4fe91c1116a1555e39\nI wanted the extended Array to be a class so that the methods are space efficient, and I wanted all of the node methods to be attached to the prototype.  I'll still give you props in the change log for getting the ball rolling.\nCheers!\n. can you be more specific?  I'm going to guess that you were referring to mousemove specifically.  There have been huge performance improvements in the past 4 months, so I would recommend downloading the most current version of KineticJS and trying again.  If you still have issues, please reopen this ticket :)\n. I think that this issue has been resolved with some of the work I did related to layer hide/show.  Could you verify for me if the problem is fixed, or if it's still an issue?\nThanks!\n. yep you're right, it's still an issue\n. Thanks Adam!  I made a small change to your logic, but will stil give you credit in the change log.  \nThanks again!\n. @Davonium ah yes, must have missed that note.  You brought up a good point, and it was something I had thought about but forgot to act on :)\nIt might be cleaner to hide and show the buffer canvas as well\n. also, why are we needing to hide the actual canvas element via display: none?  KineticJS automatically clears the canvas in preparation for the next drawing.  I can't think of a reason why we would also have to remove the canvas element from the document flow with display:none\n. I see where you're going.  Another issue though is that it breaks the pattern of show hide for other node types.  For example, to hide a shape, you would do:\nshape.hide();\nlayer.draw();\nbut to hide a layer, you would just do\nlayer.hide();\nbut, I do really like the idea of having a super high performance mechanism for hiding an entire layer, could be really useful.  I'll take a second look at this later tonight and will probably merge in your changes, thanks!\n. Thanks again for suggesting this change!  I ended up moving the layer specific logic to the Layer class to decouple the Layer and Node modules.  Here's the change:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/d0a1b2870e9975aa226dc78b6938450c0d067bf2\nStill gave you credit in the change log.  Keep on rockin!\n. not quite what I had in mind.  I'll double check that the getIntersections method is performing well - not sure how it would be slow just for the mousewheel event.  Thanks!\n. will do! Thanks\n. fixed, thanks!\n. I'll put together a tutorial that shows how to extend KineticJS objects and make sure that it's working as expected.  stay tuned!\n. +1 that's absolutely correct\n. Excellent!  I had intended on making those exact changes once I was sure that this was the approach I wanted to take (using apply())\nThanks for enhancing the each method as well\nCheers\n. What is your Twitter handle btw?  I need to be giving you some major props\n. agh, wish I had fixed this earlier.  I'm adding it to the v4.3.4 release right now.\n. fixed!  Thanks for reporting.  The change will be in the 4.4.0 release this weekend.\n. Ah, I see what you mean.  I actually misunderstood my own code!  After taking a second look at get(), I realized that it was in dire need of refactoring (the code paths were pretty odd).  Just checked in that change.  Now it contains specific code blocks for node type selectors, id selectors, and name selectors.\n. thanks for rocking all these fixes David!  I'm working on some new cool KineticJS t-shirt designs -I need to send one to you and Jason soon :)\n. This pull request is a bit tricky because there's a lot of stuff that's already been added in terms of OO design improvements.  I do like the changes made to get(), and also glad to see the new ability to select by node type.  May end up cherry picking some of the changes. \n. hiya!  This is on my todo list here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Todo-List\nWill be fixed with the next release :)\nCheers,\nEric\n. fixed!  https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/3f8801a4941ea8344845e5b1b6402eb2e3faab38\n. @BlackScorp Thanks for the help!\n. @0xE1 actually it's the same thing.  To hook into before/after redraw for shapes, just do this:\nshape.getLayer().beforeDraw(...);\nin order to redraw a shape, it's entire layer has to be redrawn (this is why KineticJS enables you to create user defined layers so that you can group shapes intelligently)\n. This issue should be fixed because KineticJS now automatically moves shapes to a temporary top layer when dragging.  Try downloading the latest version and see if you're still having this issue.  If you are, please reopen this ticket :)\n. all points attrs now can be set with an array of integers, an array of arrays which contain two elements each, or an array of point objects:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Polygon.php#getPoints\n. Interesting stuff.  We can leave this issue open so that I can come back to it later\n. Following up with this thread - This is no longer an issue because remove() now removes a Node from the node tree without destroying it as of v4.3.1:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nto destroy a node, you now use destroy();\n. Thank you so much for this!  You rock.  Nice job on the thorough unit tests.\n. whoops you're right, thanks\n. Heya, KineticJS supports Animation key frames and 16 different kinds of Transitions right out of the box.\ntransitions: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-linear-transition-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\nanimation: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-animate-position-tutorial/\n. drag and drop bounds has been rewritten as of v4.0.2:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nWhen in doubt, also don't forget to checkout the Docs here:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.php\nand the tutorials.  Here is the tutorial you're looking for:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-bounds-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. KineticJS is still evolving fairly rapidly so always check the change log when upgrading :)\n. Hi there!  KineticJS and GreenSock have recently partnered up, meaning that all of the transition issues should be resolved.  Check out the tutorials again for an update on the API.\nThanks!\n. don't do that!  I may need to hardcode styles inside the canvas tags so that people's canvas styles don't interfere with the stage DOM.\nThis problem isn't unique to KineticJS, but any widget from any library.  If users override widget CSS styling, the widget UI may be compromised. \n. On second thought, I'll go ahead and hardcode positional styles (e.g. margins, padding, display, position, etc) and hook those changes into this issue.\nThanks!\n. so new canvases will now be have inline position, width, height, margin, border, padding, and background defaults.  Anything other styles we should worry about?\n. fixed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ca0d3790b287f3dec2a76fd3a3c948d37a12bf3f\n. sorry, the framework has been evolving rapidly since it began :)\nFortunately, KineticJS is now reaching a mature state, so I don't foresee any new radical API changes.  And at least, if there are, there's a higher chance now that I will add backwards compatibility. \n. Still need to add support for this - I would like for us to be able to pass in an array of integers as well.  Stay tuned.\n. touching base - this is still on my todo list :)\n. Kinetic Transitions have been deprecated in favor of Tweens.  Tweens now also support points transitions.\n. Interesting thread!  Thoughts:\n1) okay, the buffer canvas.  Every shape is assigned a unique color code for the purpose of really fast hit detection.  When shapes are antialiased around the edges of a shape, the alpha component of the RGBA color is not equal to 1, and therefore is ignored by the hit detection algorithm.  I don't personally see this as a bug, because this case only occurs within a fraction of a pixel around the edges of a shape.\n2) canvas border used in Html5CanvasTutorials.com - very interesting!  This whole time, I had no idea that border sizes were offsetting the hit detection.  Will definitely look into this.\n. This isn't really an issue any more - The Kinetic.Text hit graph now renders a rectangle in place of the text to make the hit detection easier.  Also, the Kinetic tutorials have removed the one pixel border so there shouldn't be an issue there anymore.\nAlso, since KineticJS is building the canvas elements dynamically, we shouldn't be modifying the styles of those elements.\n. Hiya!  Will review this as soon as I get a chance.  Thanks for the pull request!\n. Thanks for getting this started!  I ended up adding all transformation attrs to the pattern fill object:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/01c5f4f7ca4e4ca03f497f7908b07e11885bb86e\n. interesting, I'll look into this one.  Thanks for reporting!\n. yes, if you have a need to stop event propagation after the Kinetic container element (the one that you pass into the stage) then you need to bind a listener to your container that uses \nevent.cancelBubble = true\nor you could use the jQuery stopPropagation method as well.\n. hiya!  I've seen that behavior too, and unfortunately that's a side effect of using the requestAnimationFrame that's build into the browser.  The browser uses a dynamic frame rate, and sometimes I've noticed that animations can be glitchy because of this.  I'm currently investing a custom request animation frame solution that may remedy this problem.  Stay tuned!\n. The issue is related to the iOS requestAnimationFrame implementation. Still investigating :)\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Oct 30, 2012, at 10:55 AM, Chris Jennison notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs there any update on the bug fix, Eric?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I did identify and fix a major issue with transitions that greatly improves performance for multiple transitions, but I'm still looking into improving it even more, possibly with a custom implementation of requestAnimationFrame.  maybe you could help me take a look :)\n. KineticJS currently uses the requestAnimFrame shim.  Fixed framerates will crash mobile devices.\n. Heya - I made several big animation and transition performance improvements with v4.0.5.  Could you give it a whirl and see if this resolves the problem?\n\nCheers,\nEric\n. There's been a ton more perf enhancements since v4.0.x (we are now on v.4.5.0), plus KineticJS is using the GreenSock TweenLite library which is very fast as well.  Closing this ticket for now.\n. interesting, you're right this looks like a bug.  After looking through the clone unit tests, I noticed that the tests are instantiating objects that use a shadow object, which has an offset property, so my guess is that if you include an empty shadow object like this:\nvar rect = new Rect({shadow:{}});\nthat this may provide a work around for now.  I'll have this fixed in the next release, v4.0.5\nThanks!!!\n. I don't think I have unit tests that clone sprites - ill look into that. Thanks!!\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Oct 30, 2012, at 9:50 AM, Wazabii notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi again.. Not sure if this is a bug or not. Since I stick with kinetic 4.0.1, I've been trying to clone a sprite object as well. But the result: cloned object seems to be a shape rather than a sprite. Is it suppose to be like that?\nThanks\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. sorry for the pain guys!  Yes, it will be fixed by v4.0.5\n. I created a jsfiddle that creates a rectangle and clones it without any issues (not using shadows or offsets).  Check it out:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/hz77b/\nAm I missing something?  If so, could you modify the jsfiddle to break the clone method?\n. P.S. you're right about Sprite shapes (unrelated to the first bug you mentioned), the Sprites class wasn't defining the shapeType which meant that the clone method couldn't figure out that it was a Sprite.  this issue will be fixed and added to the upcoming release - thanks!!\n. @macl this sounds like the expected behavior.  The whole point of Shape classes was to provide draw functions for you.  Doesn't seem to make sense to overwrite them.  If there are particular methods in a Shape class that you'd like to reuse, you could create a new class and reference those methods.  A good example is the TextPath shape which references methods from Text and Path.\n. follow up with this thread - Sprite cloning has been fixed as of v4.0.5\n. okay guys, there's a lot going on with this ticket, and since a lot of these issues have been resolved, I'm closing this one for now.  If you're still having problems with clone(), please open up a new ticket so it that can be tracked, and also provide a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem.  I've been unable to reproduce the error mentioned in the first comment, or a black transparent image.  I provided a jsfiddle in one of my earlier comments that demonstrates cloning a node without a shadow or offset.\nThanks!\n. @macl sure, but the drawFunc attr for Shapes was never intended to be editable (if this were Java, it would have been a private attribute)\nFunny thing is, the Rect shape actually doesn't even have any methods that you could reuse:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Rect.js\nIt really would make more sense to create a custom shape for what you're doing.  Also, if you want to make a hole inside of something, you should look into leveraging the winding rule, rather than xor.\n. I'll probably go ahead and add logic to each Shape class to make sure it doesn't overwrite a user defined drawFunc though, because several other people have had similar problems.\nCheers!\n. use 'dragend'.  Here's a list of the supported events:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\n. np!  no, the drag end event is fired immediately after a redraw:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/DragAndDrop.js#L51\nso if you want to do something and then draw the layer again on drag end, you'll have to use draw();\n. Yes, this is an issue with older versions of android:\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/114-canvasclearrect-bug-in-android-stock-browser/\nthe simplest work around is to create your stage and layer, and then add the layer to the stage after a timeout (50ms worked for me)\n. This is the correct behavior since a dbl click is defined by two clicks... You just need to add logic in your event handlers to do whatever is is you're trying to do.  For example, you could add a timer in your click handler that waits 300ms before doing whatever it's supposed to do, and cancel that action if a double click occurs.\n. lines don't support cornerRadius, although they do support lineJoin: 'round'.  This will produce rounded connections at steep angles.  cornerRadius is just for Kinetic.Rect, and will eventually be used with Images as well.  Here's the line docs:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Line.php\n. if you want dramatic curves where the lines connect, you might consider creating an SVG path shape instead.  Here's an example of that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-path-tutorial/\n. Thanks for the pull request, and also thanks Davonium for helping me look at these :)\n. Currently, I'm not planning on supporting composite operations via an API, although I may later.  Closing this for now, but I may come back to it.  Thanks for this though!\n. yikes, sounds like a bug.  I'll add this to my todo list. \nThanks!\n. Actually, it looks like the setDrawFunc is working correctly.  Here's a jsfiddle that alters a Rect draw function:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/wJ36T/\nIn regards to extending Line - I don't think it quite makes sense to enable passing drawing functions into the Line constructor, since the whole purpose of Shape classes is to have a drawing function predefined.  If you want to reuse methods of Line, you can extend the methods instead of the whole class (this pattern is very common inside the KineticJS codebase).  Here's an example of the TextPath shape extending a method from Text:\nsetText: function(text) {\n    Kinetic.Text.prototype.setText.call(this, text);\n},\n. This is the correct behavior.  remember that transformations are applied after a shape is drawn.  We wouldn't want the height and width to take into account scale, or else scaling a node would have no effect.\nI would suggest either not scaling the node, and placing it in a different layer that's not scaled, or if it's absolutely necessary, you could include the scale with your setWidth() and setHeigh() usage.  i.e.\nnode.setWidth(100 / node.getScale().x);\n. this is very, very interesting.  The idea of having separate scene and buffer draw functions is very compelling... Might even make sense for every default shape to include a sceneDraw and bufferDraw method.  Devs could then also override the bufferDraw method with something customized if desired.  Such a change would also fit in nicely with the request to not render the buffer graph during animations.  I'll work on this for the next release :)\nP.S. thanks so much for putting so much thought into this!  I'm inspired\n. follow up with this thread - I've done a ton of work in regards to graph drawing logic, including the ability to define custom hit drawing functions via the drawHitFunc attr.  In addition, the drawing performance in general has been greatly improved, because there are now three different drawing functions - scene, hit, and buffer graph drawing functions.  This enables each draw function to be optimized for its purpose.  I'll have tutorials up within a week or so.\n. super interesting.  I've also been thinking about applying the winding rule to do stuff like this.  I currently have a todo item to create inner shadows, and I think using the winding rule would be an excellent approach.  The only problem, though, is that if users can create inner shadows for rectangles, they would also expect them for all other shapes.  It sounds like it would be quite a task to construct winding drawing procedures for all shapes.  And how would this work for images and sprites?  What do you think?\n. I'm not entirely convinced that every Kinetic shape should be able to support the winding rule to cut holes in them.  Wouldn't it make more sense to create shape plugins?  I.e. you could create a doughnut shape, Kinetic.Doughnut, which people download.  I intend to eventually provide a gallery of 3rd party plugins that people can download.\nThoughts? \n. Thanks!\n. I've had several requests to provide some sort of clipping functionality that would do exactly what you're asking for - I'll add it to my todo list :)\nThanks!\n. It'll be in the next release:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n\"container clipping function\"\n. Follow up - Clipping regions are now fully supported as of v4.4.0\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#440-mar-26-2013\n. I'm actually not able to replicate this. Check out this jsfiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/KdM55/\nI wrapped a console.warn() with two alerts so that I can detect if perhaps IE9 fails when executing console.warn() if the console window isn't open. Not able to get a failure.\nAlso, console.warn() is working correctly for me when the console window is open as well.\nDoes the jsfiddle work for you?\n. AH that's the problem.  IE9 running on Windows 7 64 bit is notorious for having problems :)\nI'll go ahead and make this change, thank you!\n. I wasn't able to auto merge the pull request because of some changes made to the dist files, so I went and just added the window.console part locally and committed it here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/b3e7e26248ec3a2d86653bf567aaa92c2b3523ac\nI'll still give you credit for the fix in the changelog though :)\nP.S., if you find any other bugs in IE9 on Windows7 64bit please let me know because I don't have that environment for testing.  Thanks!\n. dang IE10.  did you test on IE9, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, iOS, and Android?\n. might be a bug with IE10 because the getBoundingClientRect JS method is supposed to take into account all of the CSS styling of itself and ancestor nodes\n. haven't forgotten about this, will get to it asap :)\n. Hey Jason, closing this pull request for now because I haven't had anyone else mentioning this - I'll keep track of it though in my todo list.  I'm still waiting for MS to send me some test devices ;)\n. would you mind testing this in FF, Safari, and iOS if possible?  I'd like to pull in the change, but I'm currently unable to test on windows devices.  If you give me the thumbs up, I can just pull it in.\n. ah okay.  When I get a chance, I'll just pull it in, and if it works on all the devices that I'm able to test on, I'll commit it back to the repo\n. yes, you can use a clipping region, and then convert to the node to an image with toImage().  Here's a tutorial on clipping\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-clipping-functions-with-kineticjs/\nI would suggest, however, to use an Ellipse shape with an image fill.  This will produce smoother edges.  Tutorial on fills here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. have to agree wtih @lazerblade01 on this one - generally, in JavaScript, if you want to delete an object (such as a KineticJS Shape), it's not necessary to null out, or delete all of the object's properties.  Instead, you just need to remove all references to it, and the JavaScript garbage collector will do the rest.\n. Actually, here's another issue related to this one that makes a great point:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/29\nI'll spend a little time re-investigating this one.  Thanks!\n. nice, thanks!!\n. update on this thread: you can now create custom hit detection functions.  Here's an example functional test:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/tests/js/functionalTests.js#L862\nThis is pretty powerful because it gives us unlimited flexibility in terms of how standard shapes, or custom shapes, are detectable.  Furthermore, it also enables us to create high performance hit detection functions. \n. BlackScorp, did you try upgrading ruby?\n. Exactly.  Was going to mention that actually, all shapes support borders, including images, via the stroke property.  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-stroke-with-kineticjs/\n. I'll have to think on this one - not sure if I want to repurpose the Circle shape to support wedge shapes via an angle property.  From a code line count point of view, it makes sense.  From a pure OO point of view, circles aren't defined by an angle property.  At the moment I'm kind of leaning towards creating a Kinetic.Wedge shape instead.  Thoughts?\n. A full circle makes sense, that's what I would expect.  I'm also planning on making an Arc shape, and a Ring Shape, with a similar relationship between Wedge and Circle\n. Ring shape will be coming soon.  Closing this ticket for now\n. great catch!  Not sure how this was missed\n. oh I see how it was missed, the buffer canvas is immediately resized afterwards with _resizeDOM()\n. fixed it up - thanks!\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/908fa24b8e9b217ed6bbd8d75cec5ac04323f222\n. Actually, KineticJS used to throttle drag and drop, but this created a laggy drag and drop experience which most people didn't like.  We want the drag and drop to be as snappy as possible.\nI don't think the issue is necessarily the fact that drag and drop operations trigger redraws 60 frames per second, but that the getIntersections() algorithm should be revisisted.\nIf I were personally in your shoes, I would throttle the use of getIntersections().  In other words, on my dragmove handler, I would trigger a getintersections at about 10 frames per second or so as chris has suggested.\n. shoot didn't mean to close this one because getIntersections does need to be worked on.\nTo explain a bit further, I basically did a trade.  KineticJS hit detections are now nearly instantaneously fast.  The new algorithm, unfortunately, makes the getIntersections() method a bit slower.  Since the 99% use case is regular hit detection, this is a good trade off though.\n. okay, to be clear, there are two ways to get an intersected shape based on mouse position:\n1) getIntersection() - preferred\n2) getIntersections() - very slow, and should be used for special situations\nthe getIntersection() method is blazingly fast, and returns an object containing information about the intersection point, such as a reference to a KineticJS shape if one is there, or pixel color information.  \nthe getIntersections() method does the same thing, except that it iterates through and redraws every single node in the stage in order to return a collection of intersections that may have been layered on top of eachother. \n99 times out of a 100, you're probably just interested in the visible intersected node which is at the top of nodes beneath it.\nI've actually considered removing the getIntersections() method entirely, but haven't because there are some special situations when you actually do need a collection of intersections.  At this time, I haven't been able to find a way to speed up getIntersections, although I'll keep looking into it.\n. Closing this ticket for now.\n. is it possible you could set up a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  It's a bit hard to debug something like this without seeing it in action.\nThanks!\n. @eduardo ditto, looks good to me in latests version of Chrome.  What OS are you using?  32bit 64bit?\n. classic JavaScript closure problem.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work\nhttp://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62\n. drawFunc should never add or remove nodes.  Its purpose is solely for rendering.  Try hooking into an attr event, or a draw event, to remove a shape.  Also, tons of performance improvements have been made since these versions, so I'd recommend trying out the latest release\n. yep that's right, you cannot put layers inside layers.  If you want to layer things inside of a layer, you need to use groups.  Layers are like groups, except they are tied to a physical canvas element for rendering.  Be sure and read over the how it works page here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\nHere's an example Node hierarchy:\n/*\n     *        Stage(0)\n     *          |\n     *        Layer(1)\n     *          |\n     *    +-----+-----+\n     *    |           |\n     *   G1(2)       G2(3)\n     *    |           |\n     *    +       +---+---+\n     *    |       |       |\n     *   S1(4)   G3(5)  G4(6)\n     *            |\n     *            +\n     *            |\n     *           S2(7)\n     */\nG stands for Group, and S stands for Shape.  I'll try to make this more clear as soon as possible, thanks!\n. np!\n. A KineticJS shape can only have one fill and one stroke.  When creating more complex nodes, you need to use groups.  Here's an example of that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\n. oh snap, okay I'll take a second look.  Thanks!\n. Follow up: Just checked your code with the latest version of KineticJS, and it's working correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/JrCbx/\nMust have been fixed somewhere a long the way :)\n. Haven't forgotten about this - filters have been somewhat of a lower priority lately so I haven't gotten to this.  Hang in there :)\n. Thanks again for this!  I made your change here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/0c38e3cf391e80195af29bc2b75e3e967748c62b\n. planning on using Rob's excellent spline tutorial to enable curve smoothing for the Line shape\nhttp://scaledinnovation.com/analytics/splines/aboutSplines.html\nDo you think this will be sufficient?\n. Agree very much with you there.  Will keep doing my best to keep up with documentation.  Thanks!\n. Update on this thread:\n1) yes, the documentation has been updated\n2) The Spline shape has been created and works great.  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-spline-tutorial/\n3) The spline shape is great for creating  curved shapes based on points, but sometimes people don't actually want a spline, they want rounded corner connections (as was the original reason for this thread).  After a bit more thought, I think it makes sense to keep the Spline shape as is, and also add cornerRadius functionality to Line, afterall.  macfreak, I'll take another look at the work you did some 9 months ago.\nv4.6.1 is purely for bug fixes at the moment, so I'll try to get this feature added into v4.6.2\nReopening the ticket.\n. This will get into the code base soon.  I'm actually now planning on supporting rounded corners for all shapes, including rect, polygon, star, regularPolygon, line, etc.  This will most likely make it to v4.7.1 or 4.7.2 depending on other priorities (I'm currently working on splitting the Canvas class into a Canvas and Context class, adding context tracing, fixing some major bugs, and migrating unit tests over to Mocha, which will be in v4.7.0)\n. update on this thread.  All shapes will support rounded corners with v4.8.0.  This will definitely make it into that release.  Stay tuned.\n. This is the expected behavior.  Drag and drop modifies the translation of the entire shape, not the position of the points relative to the translation.  You can get the translation with the getPosition(), getX(), or getY() methods.\n. getPosition() works correctly for me after dragging a line (it returns non-zero result).  Can you setup a jsfiddle showing the behavior?\n. clicking on a shape inside of a group, which is inside of a group, which is inside of a layer, which is inside of the stage, works for me:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/8gAW4/\nclosing this ticket.\n. this is definitely an event bubbling issue.  I'll look into this as soon as I can.\n. ah okay.  the stage is using evt.preventDefault() to prevent the page from scrolling when you try to drag and drop.  Come to think of it though, it doesn't make much sense to use evt.preventDefault() everytime (i.e. for cases when you are not trying to drag and drop).  I'll look into this\n. This is possible today.  just make the whole stage draggable.  This enables panning.  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-the-stage-with-kineticjs/\n. hm, isn't that what scrolling is?  when you scroll downwards, you're panning the stage upwards, right?  If you're looking to implement scrollbars, here's a lab that shows a way to accomplish this:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-simple-scrollbars-with-kineticjs/\n. This has been fixed and will be included in v4.5.5.  Please see this issue:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/510\n. I believe this issue is now resolved - please try out the latest version of KineticJS and let me know if it's fixed for you.  The shadow properties have been flattened, and now look like this:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shadows/\n. eek!  That's very unusual.  I'll fix this today and release a hot fix, v4.1.1.  Thanks everyone for the heads up\n. SO sorry for the inconvenience guys.  Cross browser issues have virtually been non existent lately, so I didn't test FF or IE.  The problem was the '#' symbol :)\nReleased v4.1.1 which you can get on the homepage now: http://kineticjs.com/\n. that sounds very unusual.  Can you provide a jsfiddle demo, and also the OS and browser that you're using?\n. Strange, your demo works great for me on Windows 7 Chrome as well.  Are you using 64bit by chance?  It's notorious for having browser related problems.\nAlso, you should try out the latest version, v4.1.1, which greatly improved drag and drop performance by skipping the hit graph draws.\nLet me know what you find!\n. hi there!  interesting - I suppose IE9 is really inefficient about obtaining text metrics (no surprise).  Okay, to fix this, I need to cache the text metrics so that it doesn't have to be read over and over (probably should have done that anyways).  I'll see what I can do to get this fixed for the next release, and if not, it will definitely be in the following release.  sorry for the frustration!!\n. Thanks for the kind words!  So with v4.3.3, I made several Text performance enhancements which should help speed things up.  At the end of the day, the root problem is that the fillText() method of the HTML5 Canvas API is just darn slow.  This is a browser implementation issue, not a KineticJS one.  However, KineticJS can come to the rescue with node caching.  Check out this tutorial which runs pretty smoothly by caching text shapes:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-wheel-of-fortune/\n. hi I need more info.  Can you post a jsfiddle demonstrating the behavior?  Thanks!\n. yea, looks like a context problem inside the on() method.  I'll add this to my todo list.  Thanks!!\n. fixed!  The problem was that the drag and drop module still had a reference to the node that was removed which caused things to blow (in other words, this problem only occurred if your shape was draggable:true).  Here's the change:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/5e16b3d7d0538dce04d35a91acebc288918be51c\n. it fixed the jsfiddle mentioned in the issue:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/9YfSc/\nif there are other conditions where the problem occurs, can you create a new ticket?\n. try this: \n- resize the stage with setSize()\n- scale the stage\n- redraw\n- get the stage image with toImage() or toDataURL(),\n- set the stage size back with setSize()\n- scale the stage back\n- redraw\n. Hiya, unfortunately there's nothing KineticJS can do about this - KineticJS is using the requestAnimationFrame JS method, which means that the animation rendering is up to the browser implementation.\n. not sure where you're going with this, KineticJS already supports on and off, with those features.  Have you checked out the events tutorials?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-path-mouseover/\nAlso, why do you feel that it's necessary to create an Observer and Mediator class?\nKineticJS already supports the Observer pattern because devs have access to attr change events, and custom events\n. actually that doesn't quite make sense... there should be no reason to pass in a handler to the off method.  a namespace, or event type should be enough\n. currently, you can only directly use on() and off() on an array of nodes.  You can also use the apply() method to apply a method to an array of nodes:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Collection.php\nIt would be a big overhead for Kinetic.Collection to support all Node methods directly.  I would be willing to do it if there's enough of a demand, but currently there are much bigger fish to fry :)\n. ctx.stroke() will not work.  You must use canvas.stroke(this) in order for hit detection to work property.  The canvas variable points to both the scene graph renderer, and the hit graph renderer. \nIf you modify the tutorial with canvas.stroke(this), events are working correctly\n. following up with this thread - this issue has been fixed as of v4.5.5\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#455-july-28-2013\n. Hiya!  most of those errors are happening because you need to run the unit test suite on a web server in order for image data related stuff to pass due to security constraints.  Thanks for bringing this up, just realized that I need to mention that they should be ran on a web server :)\nas for the \"Problem with node and shape type selector\" error, that definitely shouldn't be happening, it's passing for me locally.  are you running the latest source files?  Have you made any changes to the selector logic?\n. OH.  got it.  I just checked the test, which is line 632 of the containerTests.js file, and test() should be warn() so that the failed dataUrl comparison doesn't block the rest of the tests (should be a soft test).  I'll fix this and check it in right now\n. fixed!\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/5705d909e59ee802a9f1c5ed937db9d81f4ead95\nAlso added more README info\n. sorry for the confusion, I cleaned up the Testing instructions here: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS\n. ah yes, I've seen this before but haven't gotten to it yet.  There's definitely some weirdness that goes on when you change tabs.  The problem isn't actually KineticJS, per say, but with the requestAnimationFrame implementation of the browser.  I do certainly need to add something in that prevents this from happening, perhaps some logic that detects if a new tab was activated, and then halt the animation until focus is returned.  Not sure if this is even possible though.\n. Thanks for this!  Will take a look as soon as possible\n. Closing this pull request because I'm planning on rewriting how touch events work soon (in order to cleanly support multi touch + gestures).  Thanks for looking into this!!\n. I remember really struggling with this, because each browser places the text in a slightly different position.  I remember that I had to use vertical align center to best normalize the inconsistent placements.  Have you tested your fix in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE9?\nIn Chrome, it's actually placed in the correct spot.\n. Hi again!  Unfortunately, each browser positions text slightly differently based on different configurations (Canvas API issue, not KineticJS).  I remember that I had spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to get all of the text to line up consistently across all browsers, and I ened up with the vertical align middle style as part of the solution.  \nI'm closing this ticket for now, but will keep it in mind.  Whenever I get the time, I'd like to reinvestigate text positioning across all browsers to see if things have changed.\nThanks again!\n. unfortunately, Windows 7 does not support touchstart, touchmove, and touchend (like every other browser that supports touch).  This is currently on my todo list, but haven't had enough demand for it to increase the priority.\n. oh actually there were was a slight problem that I fixed here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/df63558686c3b7ab65f427c5749534e80b6df253\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/bec7f5450b45d429dd0e3999b9e92f946902f9d1\n1) the frame width and height should override the shape level width and height, not the other way around\n. in the end, decided not to take the change after all.  The frame width and height should be defined by the width and height properties in the frame object, not the shape level width and height.  In the context of sprites, the shape level width and height have no meaning because the width and height of the shape actually changes depending on the frame because each frame can have different widths and heights.  Here's a good example of that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-sprite-tutorial/\n. hiya!  This will added to the next release.  Thanks!\n. done and done:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/01c5f4f7ca4e4ca03f497f7908b07e11885bb86e\n. works perfectly for me:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/xQSMe/\n. oh I see your problem.  The rotation property is a node property, which means that it's a property of the entire shape.  Frame objects do not have a rotation property.\nIf you want to rotate the whole shape for specific frame indices, you might try hooking into the afterFrame event via the afterFrame() method, and then rotate the whole shape accordingly:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Sprite.php#afterFrame\n. can you provide a screenshot with the output you're trying to create?  You might be able to use a single shape with a pattern to generate the 10x10 grid\n. are you sure that it's only slow once you do stage.add(layer), and not when you're adding shapes to the layer?   Did you measure the time for the double for loop as well?\n. interesting.  btw, when you do stage.add(layer), the layer is rendered.  So the ~3000ms is the time it takes to render the whole layer (which in your case is the whole stage)\n. have you tried not using clone() ?  just instantiate a new rectangle directly with Kinetic.Rect\n. Also, I'd like to see the code that you're using for the cloned shape.  That info will reveal where the slow down is occurring\n. Thanks for this!\n1) Shear transform is spot on, that's exactly how I planned on implementing it\n2) Arc shape - I have plans to implement this slightly differently.  I plan on having Arc extending Shape, and Wedge extending Arc\n3) Spline shape - I released my own version of Spline in v4.3.0, which extends Line, and also has a tension attr that lets you define the interpolation.\nSince the Shear code is a few lines, I'll manually put those in and give you credit in the change logs :)\nSeriously really appreciate the work you put into this\nCheers!\n. Haven't forgotten about this - will add it in as soon as I get the chance (been pretty swamped lately)\n. Will look into this before the next release. Thanks!!\n. ah, this is because the hit graph is no longer redrawn during drag and drop operations to improve performance.  Will have to put some thought into this.  Thanks!\n. yes, dragend should work as a work around for now.  I'll try and see if I can sneak this into the next release\n. ah okay thanks for the heads up.  I'll have this fixed by the next version, v4.3.2.  Thanks!!\n. Thanks! As i mentioned before, the problem is just that the hit graph doesn't redraw during drag and drop, so when the mouseup event triggers, the hit graph rendering isn't there to pick up the event.  The fix should be pretty easy, and will be in the v4.3.2 release sometime this week.\nHang in there,\nEric\n. Fixed!  Thanks guys for all of your help.  The fix will be included with the 4.3.2 release coming out this week.\n. This will hopefully be addressed soon.  I plan to eventually support multi touch in KineticJS, which should resolve issues like this.\n. very interesting stuff!  will take a look as soon as I can\n. for this use case, wouldn't it be simpler to stack sprites on top of eachother?  i.e. you could have a character sprite, an armor sprite, a weapon sprite, etc., inside of a common group.  That way, you can hot swap out armor and weapons by changing the corresponding sprites.  \nClosing this for now because I haven't had anyone else needing this feature.  I'll keep in mind though.\nThanks again!!\n. fixed this yesterday, thanks! (check the disqus comments at the bottom)\n. heya!  You're absolutely not coming across as a downer, totally appreciate it.  I want all of the tutorials and labs to be perfect :)\nI'll take a second look as soon as I get a chance, thanks!!\nEric\n. This has been fixed - it was a problem with the lab, not KineticJS\n. I believe this is more of an issue with implementation, not a bug inside KineticJS.  Your logic should never allow multiple circles to be \"active\".  touchstart should flag a circle as \"active\", and then you could have a function or method that synchronizes the drawing based on the active circle (model view pattern).\nIn regards to forcing a touchend when you touchmove out of the stage, I'm not sure that this is something KineticJS should enforce.  When this situation occurs, you can simulate a touchend like this:\nstage.simulate('touchend');\nor just trigger touchend directly:\nstage.fire('touchend');\nWhat do you think?\nP.S. your graphic looks really neat :)\n. this is the correct behavior.  the touchend event should be called only when you touchend over the shape that you bound the event to.\nIt sounds like you want the contentTouchend event.  This will fire anytime a touchend event is triggered, regardless if you're over a shape or not.  Try this:\nstage.on('contentTouchend', function() {...});\nLet me know if this doesn't work for you.\n. Yea, I was expecting this to be a problem :(\nThe thing is, I want KineticJS to move forward.  Previously, KineticJS only supported dashed straight lines.  If we hook into the native dash line support (only chrome supports this right now), then any stroke can be dashed, including splines (which is coming for the next release).\nI don't want browsers who aren't implementing the spec to hold us back.  Just like today in web development, if you're using IE6, you won't get pretty rounded corners.  This is a form of graceful degradation.  I fully expect most browsers (especially FF and Safari) to implement dashed lines soon.\nIt is true that I could put in logic that sometimes draws dashed lines when its possible, manually, in browsers that dont support dashed lines (like straight lines, or straight strokes in IE9), but this is effectively adding bloat to the framework in order to make up for browsers not keeping up.  Also, since dashed lines are purely aesthetic, it shouldn't break applications.\nWhat do you think?\n. FF is usually pretty good with keeping up.  I would be really surprised if they don't implement it within the next couple of months\n. For the time being, I don't have plans to reintroduce the lineDash logic just for the Line shape, because I'm fairly certain it will cause more confusion for people than its worth.  In doing so, line dashes will work in all browsers, but will only work for general strokes for browsers that have implemented lineDash.  It's easier to understand if its all or nothing, if a browser always supports it, or doesn't at all.\nTo me, the lineDash attribute is a lot like the border-radius CSS property.  When creating a website, you can use border-radius to get nice rounded corners in modern browsers, while knowing that older browsers will just render the sharp corners.  It won't break the app.  This is a form of graceful degradation.\nIf more people make a ruckus about this I'll consider putting it back in, but currently I have a lot of bigger fish to fry in regards to bugz and enhancements :)\n. what do you mean by \"break\"?  is a JavaScript error thrown?\n. This is the expected behavior.  When two shape perimeters intersect and are antialiased, how is KineticJS supposed to know which shape belongs to the pixel if its color key doesn't match either shape?  There's really no need to try and add extra logic to figure out antialiased pixel mappings :).  Antialiased pixels are simply not part of the hit region.\n. can you explain a bit further?  what do you mean by thumbnails?  Images?  what's broken?  JavaScript errors?\n. Would you mind posting this problem in Stackoverflow?  I'm really sorry, but I don't have time at the moment to walk through your code and pinpoint the problem.  There's a lot going on there.\n. KineticJS doesn't support \"drop\" and \"dragenter\" events.  Here's a list of the currently supported events:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\nthis behavior can be implemented using the intersects() and getIntersections() method.  Thoughts?\n. heya!  interesting - yes.  However, I haven't had much demand for events like these, so they would be put lower in the priority list.  As you mentioned, there's a lot of complexity with drop and drag enter events, in regards to how different users would expect it to work, which implies a lot of configurations, which implies a lot of complexity.  For now, I think it's best if left to the user to roll their own drop or drag enter logic, unless a lot of people start asking for it.\nCheers!\n. Github issues are mostly for bugs. I would suggest re-posting this on Stackoverflow so the community can help you there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. the code is a bit buggy... Github issues are mostly for bugs.  I would suggest re-posting this on Stackoverflow so the community can help you there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. your problem is here:\ncontext.fillText(\"I\", parseInt(width/2), parseInt(height/2));\nneed to use canvas.fillText().\nI would also recommend just combining a Kinetic.Rect with rounded corners and a Kinetic.Text shape.  Here's a tutorial on grouping:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\n. yep, just set the listening attribute to false with setListening(false).  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-listen-or-dont-listen-to-events-with-kineticjs/\n. Yep, pass an object as the second parameter. Here's the docs: http://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#simulate\n. yep, you're absolutely correct, thanks!  There's a lot to document, so there's a high chance there are other errors like this sneaking around the code base.  Fixed!\n. I believe what you need is the once() method - this is currently on my todo list.\n. Thanks!  This will hopefully be addressed with the next release\n. This is really strange code - why is a reference to the Rectangle stored after you've deleted it?  When you remove a node with remove(), all of its references in the stage are removed, including event handlers.  You should instantiate a new rectangle each time with new Kinetic.Rect();\n. ah, I see the confusion here.  the setAttr method shouldn't be public.  You need to set the draggable property with the setDraggable() method.  The code is here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/DragAndDrop.js#L138\nYou'll notice that this method invokes additional logic other than just setting the attribute.  I need to investigate whether I should change setAttr to _setAttr to indicate that it shouldn't be used (it's already not documented), or if I should allow developers to use the method, and add an overhead of attr event listeners to run extra logic for special attrs like draggable.\n. np!  It's a legitimate issue\n. cool app.  Though, there's no way I would have time to go through all of the code to find the issue.  Can you put together a simpler jsfiddle to demonstrate the problem?  It would be much easier for me to fix something there.  No one else has mentioned a problem with clicks not firing, so I'm guessing that you have something setup with jquery that's stopping event propagation. \n. Closing this for now.  Chrome has had lots of problems over the months related to canvas, so this may be resolved by now.  Please reopen if this is still an issue.\n. layer.get('.testText') returns an array of nodes, not a single node.  Here's the docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Container.php#get\nand here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-select-shapes-by-name-with-kineticjs/\n. Hiya!  Believe it or not, this is the expected behavior.  The override coordinates in the dragBoundFunc are absolute coordinates, meaning that they will not be affected by transforms such as scales.  If you want the dragBoundFunc to adapt to the stage after it scales, the function will need to take the stage scale into account.\nCheers!\n. I made significant changes to remove() with v4.3.1, including a counterpart destroy() method.  Try it out and let me know if this resolves your issue.  Thanks!\n. great!\n. yep, have plans for that.  I'll try to get the change in for the v4.3.1 release. \n. Here you go!\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/4136ddb398f2138d8942bbe42024351a9d13e49b\n. I believe the problem you're seeing is that you're expecting drag events to bubble, which currently they do not.  dragstart, dragmove, and dragend events will bubble with the next version v4.3.2\n. correction, drag events will bubble with v4.3.4 which will be released next month\n. drag event bubbling was added in v4.4.0\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#440-mar-26-2013\n. does anyone know if this issue has been resolved?  I haven't heard of any issues like this in months.  (If mousemove was broken in FF, I'm certain that people would be filing more bugs left and right).  Please reopen this if it's still an issue.\n. This is not a bug with KineticJS.  The tutorial just needs to be updated\n. Probably will not work because it looks like hammer only works with DOM nodes. Kineticjs has plans for multi touch support, but its lower in priority at the moment. You can, however, do some of the multi touch work in your app. Check out this lab - http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-multi-touch-scale-shape-with-kineticjs/\n. Heya!  A few bugs were fixed with drag and drop with version 4.3.1.  can you give it a try and see if you're still having issues?\n. Wow that's pretty in depth, thanks!  My thoughts:\n- isEmpty --> great idea, I'll add something like this, or hasChildren()\n- global to local --> you can use getAbsolutePosition() and setAbsolutePosition()\n- too many shortcuts adds an unnecessary overhead to the library, both in size and maintenance, so I probably won't be adding much of those unless there's a really big demand for them.\n- good idea about an option for keeping an image width and height in proportion, although this could be extended to work with any node using size.  I'll add this to my todo list\n- chrisrittter has a good point in regards to the opacity comment, although it may make more sense to use a cloaking method (already on my todo list) which sets a shape visibility to false, but keeps the shape detectable.\n- very interesting about accelerated canvases!  I'll add this to my todo list as well\nThanks for all of your suggestions!!\n. The tutorial just needs to be updated.  Not a KineicJS bug.\n. Thanks chris!\n. don't use jquery to add events to KineticJS - KineticJS nodes are virtual nodes, not DOM nodes.  jQuery is a DOM library.  you need to use KineticJS event binding, e.g.\nshape.on('click', ...);\n. ah interesting okay, that makes more sense.  Does jQuery do this?  I suppose this is needed in order to make destructors?  Reopening ticket, thanks.\n. yep, Have plans to create a plugin like this as soon as the fundamental stuff is completed.  Maybe you could create one and publish it :)\n. Once KineticJS core is set in stone, I want to get the community involved with creating plugins.  I was also hoping that someone might be willing to create a KineticJS plugins website (I don't have the time to manage one at the moment)\n. This is the expected behavior - Ironically (and as expected) I made this change because a lot of people complained about the previous behavior.  There are only two options\n1)  If the mouse ever leaves the stage, force drag end and stop the drag and drop operation (this is how it used to work)  A lot of people complained about this when their app had draggable elements near the stage edge\n2) keep drag and drop alive when the mouse goes outside of the stage (current) with the caveat that if you mouseup outside of the stage, and then move the mouse back into the stage, the drag and drop operation is still alive.  The only way to overcome this is to add a mouseup listener outside of the stage - however, this should definitely not be done, because a widget should never bind listeners to DOM elements outside of its container.\nThoughts?\n. The general consensus is that this is the expected behavior (other software that implements drag and drop works exactly the same way).\nIf you'd like to force drag and drop to end, you can just do this:\nshape.stopDrag();\nhere's the docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Node.html\n. Yikes!!  This is pretty serious.  When using linear or radial gradients, it appears that shadows are also being applied to the stroke if one is defined (if you don't define a stroke, you don't get the double shadow)  I'll fix this up by the next release, v4.3.2\n. Fixed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/624ec25c2991aa5bf611b44562aa5d8d054efbab\nA logic problem was introduced when the fill attr was flattened.  This fix will go out with version 4.3.2 that I'm hoping will be released this weekend or next week.\n. Don't forget that under the covers, KineticJS is using the Canvas API, which means it's under the mercy of the browser implementation. \nHave you tried scaling the image instead?  image.setScale(2);\n. Okay, I'll keep this one in the back of my mind in case something comes up where this can be addressed client-side.  Thanks!!\n. Actually, the problem is that the API for setSize() changed.  in v5.0.1, you have to pass in an object literal.  In v5.0.2, I'll be adding back in the option for passing in two arguments via setSize(width, height).  Lab is updated.\n. Hiya!  Unfortunately, I believe that Microsoft has created new Event types (not in the w3c spec) that they expect all developers to use in order to handle touch events on wp8.  I haven't had a chance to look into it yet, and actually pretty annoyed with them in general.  The only reason I would consider supporting wp8 is because you fine folks are requesting it :)\nI'll keep you posted\n. +1 Samurai\nVery sorry for this, but Kinetic.Text needed an API do-over.  It's much cleaner and consistent now.  Here's the updated Kinetic.Text tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-text-tutorial/\n. cool!  I'll look into this as soon as I get a chance\n. Nice job!!  It works great\n. whoops forgot to update this!!  Adding it to the next release todo list right now :)\n. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. yikes, this is more than a typo, it's a logical error,  The intent was for clockwise to be defaulted to false.  Fixed up now.  Thanks for catching this!\n. thanks, I'll look into this.  It's possible that the method was changed for some reason.  Thanks!\n. yep, stage.remove() will remove the stage.  if you want to remove a layer, use layer.remove() (this doesn't destroy the layer but just unhooks it from the node tree).  If you want to actually destroy the layer, use layer.destroy()\n. You guys are correct.  I finally had a chance to look at the lab, and there is indeed a problem with this scenario:\nappears to be a problem with .get() when trying to select children of the parent of a node that is being dragged and dropped, with dragOnTop = true. See drag and drop with resize lab\nThe quickest work around for the lab is to set dragOnTop = false for the anchors.  I've updated the lab and it's working again.  I'll address the problem with get() by the next release.\nThanks guys!\n. Fixed - the dynamic drag layer now does a deep copy for the Groups and Layers that are reconstructed (which means they now also pick up ids and names and should play well with selectors).  The change will be available with the 4.3.2 release this week.  Thanks!\n. you should be able to clear the fill color with:\nsetFill(null)\nhave you tried this yet?\n. Even so, this is an unexpected behavior, so I'll get this fixed by v4.3.2.  Whenever a fill type is set, KineticJS should clear the other fill types.  Thanks!\n. Okay so I put a bit of thought into this.  I don't like the idea of the fill rendering style being determined by the order of setting fill configurations.  First off, it creates a huge logic overhead everytime a fill attribute is set (will be a performance hit).  Second, it's inconsistent with all the other KineticJS attributes.\nWhat I've done instead, is created a mechanism that makes it really easy to toggle between different fill types, if you choose to set multiple fill types.  You will now be able to use the fillPriority attribute, which can be color, pattern, linear-gradient, or radial-gradient.  \nLet's say that you want to toggle between a color fill, and a radial gradient fill.  When instantiating the shape, you can set both the fill property, and the radial gradient fill properties.  If you want the shape to start out with the radial gradient fill, then set fillPriority = 'radial-gradient'.  Then, if you want to toggle to the color fill, just use shape.setFillPriority('color').  \nThoughts?\nP.S. setting the other fill attributes to null does work, and is essentially another way to coerce fill type priority.\n. This is probably related to the issue people are having related to the mouseup event not being detectable during drag and drop after some rendering optimizations that I made.  I'll address this issue by the next release:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule/_edit\n. haven't forgotten about this issue - it'l just take a little time to get to it.\n. interesting thanks!  I'll fix this up before the next release.\nThanks!\n. Thanks!  Fixed up now.\n. You have two options:\n1) fork the project and do a build\n2) wait and download the official release sometime this week (will be v4.3.2)\n. np!\n. thanks firebluetom for the initial assist :)\n. This is a known issue - I just need to update the tutorial.\nThanks!\n. I'm marking this as invalid now because the dragOnTop functionality has been deprecated because it was causing too many issues.\n. Hiya, if you're still looking into this, I would suggest reposting on Stackoverflow because the community support is really great there\n. hiya, I'll be creating a public method to programmatically stop drag and drop soon - until then, you can do:\nKinetic.DD._endDrag();\nThat should stop the drag and drop.\nAlso, a lot of changes were made to drag and drop with v4.3.2.  These may resolve your issue as well.  Please reopen this ticket if it does not.\nThanks!\n. I think it's a bit cleaner, and more consistent, to call the callback with the context of the node, so that the node is accessed via the \"this\" keyword, similar to drawFunc.  Here's the commit:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/9160b694ae24413319e53796af8d75321d0860b2\nThanks for bringing this to my attention!!\n. The fill attr has been flattened. When in doubt, check the change log\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nOr check out the updated tutorial\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. drats you're absolutely right.  I'll get this fixed by the next release.  Thank you!\n. Fixed up, the change will make it to the 4.3.2 release this week.  Thanks!\n. Cool! I created something just like this for a client some months ago, and used event delegation to handle the resizing for shapes that had the resizable=true flag.  I don't have any tutorials up for plugins at the moment, but the general idea will be for your code to live in the Plugins namespace.  Essentially, you would create a new file, and do something like this:\nKinetic.Plugins.Resizable = function(....)\nand do your magic there.  Then host your file on a personal website, or as a Github project.  Eventually, I plan to create a gallery where people can submit plugins.  When people want to use your plugin, they will just include your JS file.  The best plugins are the ones that are seamless, such that users don't have to do much extra work, if any.  In my case, simply adding the JS file, and then adding resizable=true to shape configs made them resizable.\nCheers!\n* Update *\noh and almost forgot, if you get this up and running, be sure to send me a link so I can link to it from kineticjs.com\n. Cool!  I'm planning on building a community plugin gallery in a few months. Keep your eye out for it (although, I'd actually prefer if someone else managed a plugin gallery). Well see how it goes\n. absolutely, that would be awesome\n. This is probably related to the new drag and drop performance optimizations that were made recently.  I'll have this addressed by the next release, thanks!\n. Hi again!  It turns out that you've surfaced an even bigger problem with KineticJS (whether you meant to or not).  When both a node and its ancestors are set to draggable=true, currently KineticJS gives the oldest ancestor priority over any of the descendants.  This isn't a very good design.  I made a change that now gives nodes priority over its ancestors.  So now, if both the stage and a shape is set to draggable = true, when you drag and drop a shape, just the shape moves, and when you drag and drop the stage, the whole stage moves.  This will eliminate all the mouseover and mouseout logic you were adding to achieve this behavior.  \nThanks again!\n. Each stage can contain multiple layers, and each layer has its own canvas.  You can access the canvas element with:\nlayer.getCanvas().getElement();\nHere are the docs of interest:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Layer.php#getCanvas\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Canvas.php#getElement\n. interesting, I believe this may be a result of an optimization I made with the transitionTo method.  I bet the callback is being executed after the first Tween is completed (a Transition is made up of several tweens).  I'll look into this one.  In the meantime, you should be able to work around this by adding a small timeout in your callback function, say 50ms or so to be safe.\n. great!  Sorry for the headache\n. This should be fixed now, because the transition callback is executed after the last tween has finished, instead of the first.  This logic change will be in the v4.4.0 release coming out this weekend.\n. hmph haven't heard about this.  I've added it as a todo item for the 4.3.2 release because it sounds pretty serious.  stay tuned.\n. Actually, all of the mouseout and mouseleave unit tests are passing fine, and I did several manual tests verifying the functionality as well.  Could you post a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  \nThanks!\n. Hiya!! ah, the problem is your custom shape.  A custom shape can only have one path, here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shape-tutorial/\nIf the bg rendering needs to have events tied to each element, you should combine a Line with a Rect using groups:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\nIf you don't need events, and just want to use the canvas API, you can create a separate layer just for the background rendering, and then draw directly onto the canvas element.\n---- About sponsoring\nSweet!  KineticJS has lots of code created by the community, so would love to see any pull requests you come up with.  Typically, small enhancements and bug fixes are the most likely pull requests to be accepted.  If you'd like to sponsor the project financially, here's the sponsor page:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Sponsor-the-KineticJS-Project\nCheers!\n. Each shape can only have one path for two reasons:\n1) The high performance hit detection algorithm requires that each shape has one path (this is how KineticJS is so fast)\n2) Shapes are defined as primitives.  Anything that's composed of multiple primitives should be a Group.\nHere's an example of drawing directly onto the layer canvas (check out the curved lines)\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-modify-curves-with-anchor-points-using-kineticjs/\n. Exactly!  All languages have primitive and complex data types.  With KineticJS, all Shapes are primitives, and you can combine multiple shapes to create complex shapes (like complex data types)\nIn regards to inheritance, I know.  I was originally using a more robust inheritance pattern, that enabled developers to easy extend any Node in the framework.  This, however, comes at quite a performance cost (as much as 2x).  KineticJS uses a very high performance inheritance pattern, which in turn makes it harder for developers to extend Nodes.\nThinking about it now, I could easily create a public extend() method that automatically propogates properties and methods to children nodes when extending a parent Node.  I'll add this to my todo list!\nI only have one branch, the trunk.  Currently, I only make new branches for experimental stuff.\n. that's the KineticJS specific extender.  The modules are loaded in such a way that methods and properties will automatically propagate to children nodes.  I need to create a new public extend method that traverses children and sets those methods and properties regardless of the module load order.  This extend() method will turn into a private _extend() method.\n. hiya!  Can you create a jsfiddle for me so that it's easy to try out?  Thanks!\nAlso, have you checked the changelog? https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\n. +1 Thanks firebluetom!        \n. Heya, originally I was going to use NodeJS for the build, but someone created the Ruby build for me early on, and it's been working great so far.  Don't think it's really a big deal to put in an effort to ditch Ruby at the moment, but if I'm convinced that it's needed, I'll let you know :)\n. hiya, this is a known issue.  rotationDeg is actually a special attribute that converts the degree and maps it to the rotation attribute.  I have plans in the near future to hook the transition config object into this mapping.\n. The transition class has been deprecated in favor of Tween, which does now support rotationDeg.\n. you have a couple of options:\n1) apply a slight shadow to the line such that it creates a 1px border\n2) create two overlapping lines, such that the bottom line is a bit thicker than the top line, which creates a border around the top line.\nThere's no plans at this point to support line fills.  But this could change if enough people request it.\n. drats!!  This was a side effect of some major Kinetic.Text refactoring that was bundled with the release.  I'll fix this up and put out another release this weekend (I would put out a release out tonight, but I want to wait and see if any other problems come up).  I'll add a new set of text functional tests so this doesn't happen again.\nThanks so much!\n. fixed!  This will be pushed out sometime this week as v4.3.3\n. this is the new expected behavior.  \nI don't understand, you want the whole stage to be pannable, and also have shapes drag and droppable?  Only one thing can happen at a time.  Can you expand a bit further?\n. As soon as I get a chance, I'll try and backfill older versions in the version archive.\nv4.3.1 is the last version to support text drag and drop.  A bug with text drag and drop was introduced in 4.3.2, which will be fixed this weekend with 4.3.3\n. so all of the versions are now in the CDN (including v1.0.0).  I just need to go through and update the links to them.\n. could you possibly setup a jsfiddle demo?  You've explained the problem great, it would just help me save a bit of time.  Thanks!\n. I just did a lot of testing on different browsers, including Firefox, and transitioning the layer opacity to 0 works correctly for me, even when its containing a circle and text.  Closing this ticket for now - if this is still an issue for you, please create a jsfiddle to demonstrate the problem.  It might be related to the way you're building the stage.\nCheers\n. You're right, it shouldn't be running that slow.  Is each sector track an individual shape?\n. I'll go ahead and create a lab that's similar to what you're doing (mine will be a wheel of fortune demo) and I'll check out the performance there.  You're use case just doesn't really have anything that should be slowing the Kinetic engine down.  I'll get back to you later tonight.\n. Well got to the bottom of it.  Strangely, I never saw this happening, but KineticJS appears to have a major performance issue when animating nodes nested inside other transformed nodes, which is only surfaced when we're animating lots of groups.  And, I believe I know the root cause - I've been wanting to revisit how I construct transformation matrices for nested nodes, and it looks like now may be a good time to do this.  I'll have this addressed by v4.3.4.  Stay tuned!\n. p.s. as a work around for your use case, I would recommend not nesting shapes inside one another with groups, unless you can wait until the end of next month for this issue to be addressed.\n. Update: after more digging, I discovered that the culprit is actually Kinetic.Text.  Nested groups still render lighting fast, the problem is just text.  I believe the problem is related to the fact that I'm not caching text metrics - I'll keep digging.\n. After further digging, I've found that the root problem is really just the fillText method of the canvas context.  Basically, drawing text is just really slow with HTML5 canvas.  This isn't a KineticJS specific issue.  To improve performance (I'm talking about getting the FPS back up to 40fps+), you can cache the text node as an image.  Here's a tutorial on that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\nI'm currently working on a lab that does just this, so I'll let you know when it's published so that you can use it as a guide.\n. exactly.  Groups nested in groups nested in groups perform great.  drawing text with HTML5 canvas does not.  Hopefully, when I get this lab out, it'l be a bit more clear on what you need to do to dramatically boost the FPS.\n. Here you go sir, cached text nested inside of a group, which is nested inside of another group:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-wheel-of-fortune/\nShould be somewhat similar to what you are doing\n. There's lots of ways to animate colors, I typically increment the rgb components of a color (0-255) and then set the fill to 'rgb(x,x,x)'\n. This is by design.  If you don't want the drag and dropped shape to go to the top layer, you can set dragOnTop = false\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#setDragOnTop\n. why is draggable being toggled on and off on mousedown and up?\n. It sounds like the root problem is that right and middle click should not trigger and drag and drop.  I'll fix this up.\n. this ticket has not been closed which means that it hasn't been worked on yet :)\n. It's been added to the release schedule\n. would definitely be cool.  I have big plans to eventually open up a community gallery page where people can submit 3rd party plugins like this.  If you're interested, by all means, setup a github project page and build it out.  I could link to it from the homepage for now.\nCheers!\n. You're absolutely right, this is a bug.  I'll have this fixed up with the next release, v4.3.4.  Thanks for catching this!\n. Thanks for the assist Chris!  Yes, I'm planning on doing a release mid March\n. that sounds reasonable.  I committed some refactored code that fixed the dragend / mouseup ordering bug:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/966ebf2a326fb32911d38d79f3c3ac68ade5c347\nI'll also prevent the click event from firing once the drag and drop operation has started\n. on second thought, I think I'll keep it the way it is for now.  The definition of a click is when a user mouses down inside of an element, and then mouses up inside that same element.  There might be cases where someone intends to click on an element, and if they accidentally drag the element by 1px, we don't want to prevent the click event from firing.  I think it makes more sense for you to add logic on your end to prevent the click when the user is in drag and drop mode.  I'm open to keeping this discussion open though :)\n. Hiya!  Since this isn't a KineticJS specific issue, would you mind reposting this on Stackoverflow?  I'm currently using Stackoverflow for the discussion forum:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. very interesting, this does indeed look like a bug.  I'll address this one with the next release (v4.3.4)\n. as a work around, you can set the dragOnTop property to false.  There appears to be a problem with the layer cloning step with the dynamic drag and drop layer.  \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/HHfMG/\n. by default, the dragOnTop property is set to true, which means that when you drag and drop something, KineticJS dynamically builds a temporary drag and drop layer, moves the node to that layer, and then animates the drag and drop.  When finished, the dynamic layer is destroyed, and the node is moved back to its original container.  Super complex, but it provides a pretty big performance boost because only the node being dragged and dropped is redrawn for each frame, rather than its entire associated layer.\n. I double checked that this is no longer an issue.\n. Most likely a geographic issue.  KineticJS is using Godaddy hosting, and this isn't the first time that people have seen down time in different areas.\n. I've seen this before - it's actually a byproduct of the browser implementation of path fills in relation to context translations.  I'll add this to my todo list and investigate further.\nThanks!\n. Closing this one for now, please let me know if this is still an issue. GoDaddy typically gets these types of outages resolved fairly quickly.\n. Heya, I have plans to go through the codebase and add return this to the appropriate methods, but haven't had a chance yet.  Stay tuned!\n. I looked very carefully at your jsfiddles, and the positioning of everything looks correct.  Maybe you are mis understanding absolute position?  Here are the positioning rules:\n1) x and y are always relative to the parent container\n2) when you use setAbsolutePosition, this method calculates the relative x and y that you need in order to position the node absolutely.  If you update the position of a parent container, the child container position will move as well because its x and y position are still relative to its parent\nThoughts?\n. Oh and, not sure if you knew this, but you can also set the absolute position when an object is created like this:\nvar sqr3 = new Kinetic.Rect({\n            width: 50,\n            height: 50,\n            fill: '#FFFFFF',\n            stroke: '#00FF00',\n            strokeWidth: .4,\n            id: 'sqr3',\n            name: 'sqr3',\n            absolutePosition: [10, 120]\n        });\nThe sqr3 shape's position will change, however, the moment you change the position of one of its ancestors (this is by design).\nIf you truly wanted a shape to be fixed in a specific position, you shouldn't nest it inside of a group.  Just add it directly to a layer, and don't change the position of the layer.\n. hiya! Nope, it's on my todo list.  Kinetic.Text has been heavily refactored over the months, and support was temporarily dropped.  It will be added back in the v4.3.5 release\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\nSorry for the confusion!\n. this never made it to the codebase, unfortunately.  It is still on my todo list.  Priorities keep pushing it down the list.  Stay tuned.\n. After more thought, I've decided not to support none 2d contexts.  It just doesn't make sense with KineticJS.  I created several variants of  KineticJS + Three.js, and I found that the easiest thing to do is to just overlay a KineticJS stage on top of a Three.js canvas, or vice versa.  There's just absolutely no benefit to having this built into KineticJS.  I'll put up a lab on html5canvastutorials.com that shows a clean way to combine KineticJS and Three.js.  Thanks!\n. Ah, this is a regression bug, which occurred when the remove() behavior changed to just removing a node from the node tree, rather than fully destroying it.  The reset() method should call a new method called destroyChildren().  I'll fix this up by the next release.\n. Also, I'll be sure to add better unit tests around the reset() method to make sure this doesn't happen again.  Thanks for catching this!\n. Hiya!  As of v4.3.4, I'll be removing the reset() method entirely, because it is essentially the same thing as stage.destroy() and new Kinetic.Stage().\nThanks!\n. thanks for looking into this!  I'll try and get this in asap\n. interesting, I'll have this fixed up soon\n. Following up with this thread - I don't believe that I should be validating all inputs.  Where would I draw the line?  Param validation will degrade performance, which doesn't seem to be worthwhile when most people are sending the correct data types.  I think it makes more sense for the developer to send the right data type into a method as described by the docs, at least for now.  i.e. you should use shape.move(parseInt(x), parseInt(y));\nP.S. I'm still open to adding validation to all methods, I would just need to have enough of the community wanting that feature, and I'd have to make sure the perf consequences arn't too bad.\n. the getDOM method was deprecated and replaced with getContent() in v4.3.1.  Here's the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\n. I don't believe that performance has gone down, but there is a bug related to drag and drop on mobile devices that causes a flicker.  Is this in reference to drag and drop?  If so, the work around is to set dragOnTop: false in the shape config.  This particular issue will be fixed with the next version, v4.3.4\n. yes, please reopen if this is still an issue.  the dragOnTop property was deprecated.  Drag and drop should perform quite well now because a lot of optimizations have been made since this ticket was filed.\n. this doesn't quite look right. e is an array that should look like this:\n[0, 'blue', 1, 'red']\nare you using the correct format for the colorStop property?  Here's an example\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. no, you have a valid point.  I came up with the single array idea to try and make the config as easy as possible.  Perhaps, as you've suggested, a 2d array might make sense, or even some other notation.  Keep the ideas coming.\n. odd, your jsfiddle is actually working correctly for me in Chrome on Windows7.  What browser and OS are you seeing the problem?\n. might also be related to Ubuntu.  This would be a pretty serious issue, and I haven't had anyone else reporting a similar issue, so there might be something going with the Ubuntu Chrome combo\n. ah interesting!  Sorry about this - the interpolated control points are set when points is set, which is dependent on tension.  As you've noted, if tension isn't yet defined, the control points won't be set correctly.  The control points should be set if either points or tension is set, and the other property is available.  I'll have this fixed up soon.\n. I created a unit test for this case, and it appears to be fixed now.  I've done several refactorings of the points and tension attr handling, so it was probably fixed a long the way.  Try out v4.5.5 when you get a chance and let me know if it works for you.\n. Hiya!  First off, I'd recommend upgrading to the latest version, v4.3.3.  Quite a bit has changed since v3.10.0 - here's the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nI'm closing this ticket in Github since it's not related to a bug with the library.  You may try reposting on Stackoverflow - the KJS community is pretty helpful there:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. do you mean an exception is thrown if you fire a custom event when nothing is listening for it?  If so that definitely sounds like a bug.  I'll add this to my todo list.  Thanks!\n. fixed!  This will be a part of the 4.4.0 release coming this weekend.  Thanks for reporting!\n. did you post the right link?  It's pointing to an example of toImage, which appears to be working correctly.\n. can you expand a bit more on what you're expecting, vs. what is happening?  I checked the jsfiddle in chrome on OSX, and I correctly see two images (the second image was produced with toImage).  Thanks\n. what exactly is your use case?  Are you destroying the node after dragend, or while drag and drop is occurring? \n. great!  Okay I'll have this fixed by the next release.\nCheers!\n. Fixed!  This will go out with th 4.4.2 release.  Thanks!\n. Hate to say this, but it is now createImageHitRegion()\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-pixel-detection-with-kineticjs/\n. great!\n. can you show me the code that you used to generate the text?  a jsfiddle would be best\n. the demo runs really smoothly for me in FF 19 on MacOS.  What OS are you using?\nAlso, why are you using such a large canvas?\nP.S., KineticJS will soon support clipping functions at container levels (such as layers and groups), and this can be used to optimize render performance.  So if for some reason a particular rendering is slow, this would be one way to alleviate it.\n. First off, have you guys:\n1) created multiple layers, and grouped things together inside layers that are redrawn frequently, or together?\n2) reduced the amount of text and shadows for intense animations? (this is a canvas rendering constraint, not a KineticJS one)\n3) tried out node caching?  caching greatly improves performance, because it essentially converts any piece of your drawing into an image.\nThe next release of KineticJS will now have clipping built into all containers so that you can define clipping paths around particular regions of interest on a layer to further tweak performance.\nIf you're seeing a problem exclusively with FF, there's a good chance it's just FF not performing well.  I'll keep on eye on this.\n. Thank you Jason!\n. Awesome thanks.  Yea, I've gotten into the habit of running mocha-phantomjs test/runner.html before committing to make sure everything passes\n. looking into this right now :)\n. This isn't a complete solution, because there's actually 3 different variants of toDataURL.  One for Stage, one for Layer, and one for Node, which covers Shape + Group.  The fix for this problem will have to be a bit more generic.  Still looking into it.\n. So a couple of things:\n1 I'm not able to reproduce this problem, toDataURL() is working correctly for me with non 1 pixel ratio devices (like iOS)\n2 you submitted this pull request about a month ago.  A lot has changed since then, and I've fixed up some pixel ratio issues as of version 4.3.3.\nI'm closing this ticket for now because I believe this should already be fixed.  Try out the latest version and see if you still have problems.  If you do, reopen this ticket.\nThanks!\n. Unless of course, you are testing on Android.  I do recall seeing some people having pixel ratio issues on Android devices\n. Reopening this because I can't replicate the issue for older versions of KineticJS.  I'm assuming that you're using an Android device correct?\n. ahh okay.  Thanks!\n. hi again!  I did some more research, and there appears to be an inconsistency between chrome and Safari on devices with retina display (like the macbook pro with retina display).  I don't currently have a laptop with retina display, so would you mind checking both Chrome and Safari?  From what I've read, I'm guessing that the problem you're seeing will occur in only one of these browsers, while the other browser will work correctly.  Thanks!\n. okay I got to the bottom of this.  The problem occurs if you don't specify a width and height.  (as a work around, if you specify the width and height properties in the dataURL config, it works correctly.  Thanks!\n. Agreed.  I'll start tagging versions starting with the next release, v4.3.4.  Thanks!\n. One thing that has changed with the newer versions is that drag and dropped shapes are moved to a temporary layer for performance reasons.  I bet the problem is related to that change.  As a work around, you can use dragOnTop:false to keep the shape in the same layer.  This should fix your problem.\n. would you mind reposting this on stack overflow?  This is not a KineticJS bug, it's an implementation question.  Thanks!\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. cool idea.  I'll add it to my todo list\n. This sounds very promising!!  Thanks for doing this.  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.\n. sweet!  Can't wait to pull this in and try it out.\n. Works like a charm!  Beautiful work.  Thank you so much for fixing up the text wrapping problems (this was on my todo list but I just hadn't gotten around to fixing it up yet).\n. Thanks again for your work.  Attribution is in a few places here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. very interesting.  I agree, the dragstart event should use the event object generated from mousedown.  I'll add this to my todo list.\n. actually, after putting a bit more thought into it, I don't think we should pass the mousedown event object into drag start.  For now, I would recommend storing a reference to the event object, or the evt.button, for use with subsequent events such as dragstart and dragmove.  I'll still keep thinking on this though.\nThe reason is that, as you pointed out, dragstart is triggered by mousemove.  It would be odd for a user to mousedown, wait 2 seconds, and then start dragging (which triggers drag start),  and then pass a mousedown event object to dragstart.\n. this is just the effects of anti-aliasing.  You can  use a custom hit function to reduce the hit region.  Here's an example\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-custom-hit-function-tutorial/\n. Thanks for bringing this up!  It turns out that the uniformity isn't really an issue.  The idea of the getRandomColor() key is to return a (probably) unique rgb value as fast as possible.  After some investigation, I discovered that Math.round() and Math.floor() are actually quite slow.  Using a bitwise or operation is much faster.  More on that:\nhttp://jsperf.com/math-floor-vs-math-round-vs-parseint/2\njust committed the change.  \nThanks!\n. +! nitriques.  There are lots of ways to load and preload images, and I didn't want to bloat KineticJS with logic not related to canvas.  For simple cases, use image.onload = function() to instantiate your image.  Here's an example\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. this is incorrect.  the arguments variable is a reference to the arguments array.  The arguments are referenced this way because the number of arguments is not known ahead of time.  Here's some reading:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments\n. yep, this wasn't over looked, it just hasn't been implemented yet.  It will get in there soon.\n. @lavtron Tweens no longer support complex objects.  You have to define each component.  Here's a working example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/5jbyw/\nso you need to do:\nvar tween = new Kinetic.Tween({\n node : node,\n duration : 1,\n offsetX: 2,\n offsetY: 2\n});\ntween.play();\n. I used to support complex objects, but the Tween class started to get really huge, and really complex, and really coupled to KineticJS attribute types (x, y, width, height, r, g, b, points, etc).  To keep the Tween class light weight, I decided that for complex objects, you have to pass in each component individually.  This keeps the Tween class much more decoupled\n. agreed.\n. Ah, the problem is that the id attr is being copied over to the temporary drag and drop layer (since you have draggable:true), which results in an override of the layer id in the id hash.  As a work around, use draggable:false, or dragOnTop:false\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/RNCXz/4/\nI'll add this to my todo list, thanks!!\n. This would break many, many things in KineticJS if I allowed developers to pass in their own canvas elements (I looked into this to investigate the possibility of passing in Three.js contexts into a KineticJS layer).  At the end of the day, it's much cleaner, and simpler, if you just overlay a KineticJS stage on top of your own canvas element, if you're doing something special (or vice versa)\n. Side note, KineticJS is a bit more complex than EaselJS, because it automatically handles the canvas elements for you - one scene canvas and one hit canvas per layer.\n. I don't believe that there are any 2d canvas libraries which are also compatible with excanvas.  If you're requirement is to use a graphics library which works in all browsers, you might consider going with Raphael.js, which has an SVG and VML renderer, but is much slower and less feature rich than a canvas library.\n. what is the use case here?  You need the time to be set back to zero?\n. sounds like you should be using Tweens.  Here's what you're looking for:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-stop-and-resume-transitions-with-kineticjs/\n. That is correct.  Currently, stage.toDataURL requires a callback.  I will be changing that soon though (trying to make everything synchronous)\n. you can also access past versions here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Version-Archive\n. and sorry for the confusion.  I intended for most developers to use kineticjs.com as a portal to downloads, docs, and tutorials.  I use github for advanced stuff.\n. Thank you!\n. You're absolutely right, some things could be done to be more minification friendly.  I'll get to this as soon as I can, although it's a bit lower in priority than other items.\n. Heya.  In the future, please post implementation questions like this on stack overflow.  Also, your problem is JavaScript closures :)\n. you're not supposed to initialize containers.  it's an abstract class.  You can initialize Stages, Layers, and Groups, which extend Container\n. Ubuntu or Linux?\n. This was a problem with Google Chrome.  the latest update broke versions of KineticJS for 4.3.1 and below.  The best way to fix the issue is to upgrade to a recent version of KineticJS.  Sorry for the headache :(\n. @nitriques yes, I push KineticJS versions to the Amazon Cloud Front CDN\n. +1 chrisritter, nice!  That totally makes sense.\n. @3tcubed truly sorry for that.  now that the event target can be any node type, the name of the property needed to change.

I'll put this fix in with the next release\n. This has been fixed and will be a part of the 4.4.1 release this weekend.  Thanks!\n. Thanks louis!  I missed this as well.  Yes, it appears that the last word auto wraps regardless if it fits or not.\n. this is currently fixed.  The patch will be released as v4.4.1 this weekend:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. you're using the method incorrectly.  When in doubt check the docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#remove\nyou can also use destroy() if you want to comletely destroy the node\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#destroy\nWhat you want to do is just yellowGroup.remove()\n. Here's the official tutorial on labels (which can be used for tooltips):\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-label-tutorial/\n. this was done intentionally.  I believe that the current w3c spec for CSS index handling is critically flawed.  As an experienced web developer, I can't tell you how many times I've seen other developers break applications because of z-index issues (z-index conflicts, and developers trying to create the highest z-index, so you see z-indices of like 9999 and 99999).  I think KineticJS's spec is much cleaner.\n. Also note, that if you want to get the absolute z Index (like the CSS spec), you can use getAbsoluteZIndex()\n. Hey @ruionwriting !  I specifically did not want KineticJS index to work like CSS z index, because quite frankly, I feel that the w3c spec for z indices is just weird.\nYour approach is the right one - just use shape.moveToTop() to move a node to the top of its siblings.  Or, if you have a separate layer dedicated for drag and drop stuff, you can do shape.moveTo(layer).\nThis example of drag and drop does something similar:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-drag-and-drop-stress-test-with-1000-shapes/\n. Thanks for this!  One other question - would you mind looking into padding as well?  It looks like horizontal padding isn't taking affect with text wrapping\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-text-tutorial/\nIf not just let me know, and I can take a look :)\nThanks!\n. Hiya!  After taking a second look at your pull request, it looks like you're now correctly taking padding into account.  Great!  I'll do some more testing before I release a patch this weekend.\nP.S. don't fret this - the 4.4.0 release was a big one which introduced a few regressions anyways.  We'll have everything up to snuff soon :)\n. This is working correctly for me in Both Chrome and Firefox:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-layering-with-kineticjs/\nCan you be more specific when you say \"moveToTop doesn't work\".  Very hard to debug that :)\nAlso, to be clear, moveToTop moves a node to the top of its siblings inside a common parent, not to the top of all nodes in the stage.  i.e. if you have two layers, and some shapes in the bottom layers, calling moveToTop() on one of those shapes will place the shape at the top of the siblings in the bottom layer.  The shapes in the top layer will still be  above the shape that was just moved to the top.\n. No problem!  Great.  This ticket scared me because that would have been a major bug ;)\n. Chrome seems to have introduced some bugs with older versions of KineticJS.  These problems are not present with the latest release, v4.4.0\n. Unfortunately there's nothing I can do about this - The update broke older versions of KineticJS (v4.4.1 and below).  You'll have to upgrade to a newer version.  Sorry for the headache!!\n. +1.  I definitely recommend to try and keep your KineticJS version as up to date as possible.  Browsers (especially chrome) tend to break things quite often.  When this happens, KineticJS typically has a hot fix release to overcome whatever was broken.\n. Hiya!  The drag layer was removed with v4.4.0 because it was causing too many problems.  Here's the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nalso, the afterDraw() method has been removed, in favor of .on('draw').  \nSince the drag layer logic has been removed, I believe you can remove all of the code mentioned in your ticket.  The shape will stay in its layer as you drag and drop, so there's no reason to keep it in sync.  if you want to update another layer as you drag, you could do this:\nlayer.on('draw', function() {\n  layer2.draw();\n}\n. ah must have missed this - I'll have this fixed in the next release which is going out in about a week (v4.4.1).  Sorry for the headache!\n. Is this specific to v4.4.0?  Does this work in earlier versions?\n. interesting - does KineticJS fail in some situations?  I'll look into this soon.  Thanks!\n. could you possibly create a simple jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  That would be very helpful :)\n. I don't believe I have any unit tests that cover stage.destroy().  I'll look into this soon\n. I'll be looking into this soon.  My guess (without looking at the code) is that the hit graph is not being redrawn correctly, since a LOT of refactoring was done in regards to scene and hit graph rendering.  This will be fixed by the weekend.  stay tuned.\n. no prob!\n. this is the expected behavior.  Although, it doesn't look like this is spelled out explicitly in the documentation.  I'll update that asap.  When stage draggable is true, the stage is in panning mode.  Here's a tutorial on that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-the-stage-with-kineticjs/\nThanks\n. help with debugging and implementation issues need to be on stack overflow.  Github tickets are for cases when you can demonstrate that there's a problem with KineticJS itself\n. guys, just listen for events on the container DOM element with addEventListener(), jQuery, YUI, etc.  At that point, you need DOM events, not KineticJS shape events\n. added this to the release schedule, thanks!\n. Hiya, yes, this should be fixed up by v4.5.2.  Here's the todo list for that release:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule#452-mid-june-2013\n. priorities.  Be sure to check the release schedule to get an idea of when bug fixes / features will be released:\nCurrently this issue is scheduled to be released in the middle of July, assuming that no other urgent issues pop up, and push it into August:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule#455-mid-july-2013\n. Thanks again for starting this thread!  Finally got around to fixing this one.\n. Thanks so much for looking at this!  It turns out that the way default attrs is handled was rewritten, and the index default was lost.  The problem is that we shouldn't be accessing the index property directly, we need to use the getter method so that the default is returned, i.e. getIndex()\n. thanks!  The getters and setters are dynamically generated at here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Sprite.js#L113\n. I believe you're misunderstanding what stage.on() does.  stage.on('mouseup') does not fire a mouseup event anytime you mouseup inside the stage.  It fires a mouseup event when you mouseup inside of a shape (all events are relative to shapes).  It sounds like what you want, is to listen for mouseup on the container DOM element instead\n. Here's a (more concise) demo that shows that a rect background is working.  There's too much going on in your code for me to take a close look.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/mCGQC/\n. Thanks for looking into this!  It turns out that what you proposed was very close to what I was looking for, but there were a few additional things that I needed.  Thank you!!!\n. shoot!  Yes, arrays are modified by reference in JavaScript.  I hadn't taken that into account with handling the default.  I'll take a look at this soon.\n. Hiya!  Thanks for looking into this.  I still believe that if the developer wants to hook into general events for the stage, they should do so at the DOM level by adding events to the container, or the content DOM element.\n. I'll keep in mind.\nFor your second use case, if you want to detect events on spaces where there's not a node, you can add an event listener to the container DOM element, and also do this:\nstage.on('mouseup', function(evt) {\n  evt.cancelBubble = true;\n});\nThis will prevent the event object from bubbling up to the container DOM element, and therefore will not fire the event handler bound to the container\n. you can use stage.getPointerPosition() at anytime to get the pointer position.\n. This looks really cool!  Can you explain a bit more on what exactly it does and how it works?\n. Awesome!  Do you think it would make sense to change the filter name to Mask?\n. hiya.  I would need to see some code :)  Perhaps you could post something in jsfiddle or stackoverflow\n. Hi all, please upgrade to the latest version of KineticJS.  This issue was fixed with v4.4.2. The problem was occurring with a .bind() method that was added with a pull request. iOS 5.1 and below does not support bind().  Change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\n. hiya!  Are you using the latest version of KineticJS?  A recent release of Chrome broke older versions of Kinetic\n. Great!  Thanks for verifying \n. Thanks everyone for helping eachother!  KineticJS is truly a community project :)\n. Isn't it already a module?\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Global.js#L157\n. Thanks @lavrton !\n. Hiya, \n1 you're custom shape doesn't have context.beginPath().  this fixes the drag and drop issue:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/D9tzR/\n2 this is a pretty small issue, since people shouldn't be setting the radius to 0.  I'll take a look none the less :)  Thanks!\n. Glad to hear!  I've spent a lot of time on it :)\n. Heya!  This was fixed last night actually.  the v4.4.1 patch will be going out this weekend.  stay tuned!\n. Interesting, I'll have to put some thought into this.  As a temporary work around, have you tried replacing the ids with names instead?  If you keep the names unique, it should still function as a unique identifier\n. Currently no, although it's on my todo list :)\n. On second thought, I'll add these to the next release, v4.4.2.  Thanks!\n. The problem is that clone should not also clone ids, since they are unique identifiers.  This change is scheduled to get in pretty soon.  \nIf this is urgent, you can modify the KineticJS source code here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L954\nand we'll need to create a new attrs object that doesn't contain the id key.  That new object should be used to instantiate the cloned object.\nStay tuned.\n. These methods were deprecated.  Please use the beforeDraw and draw events instead.  i.e.\nlayer.on('beforeDraw', function(){...});\nlayer.on('draw', function() {...});\n. Thanks!\n. Heya, I ended up removing the before funcs completely, which means that we don't need to add the this.afterDrawFunc on line 54.  Closing this one.  Thanks!\n. can you create a jsfiddle showing the problem?  The tutorials on html5canvastutorials are working great.\n. this is really strange.  in my local copy, it is capitalized, in the repo, it's lower cased, but Git doesn't detect the difference.  Looking into this.\n. heya!\nin response to \"There is also the potential problem of having an anti-aliased (and thus unpredictable) pixel color value mapping to an entirely different shape color key just by chance alone.\" - This is actually untrue.   Anti-aliased pixels are not different colors, they simply have opacities that are less than 1.  Anti-aliased pixels will never trigger other shapes\nOne way to solve your particular problem is to create custom hit regions.  You actually have full control of the hit region paths.  For example, you could increase the hit region by a pixel around your shape.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-custom-hit-function-tutorial/\nI will however, spend some time investigating this further to see if there's a high performance solution to the problem.  I'd like to note though, that my impression is that this isn't a problem for 99.9% of KJS users, which has made it slightly lower priority than other things.  I'll keep the ticket opened.  Stay tuned!\n. @tomg7 I don't think your test results are proving what you believe to be happening - are you picking out the pixel color from the scene graph or the hit graph canvas?  KineticJS uses a hidden hit graph which is rendered with completely different rules than the scene graph, as defined in the Canvas.js renderer class (for example, full opacity is always used)\n. @tomg7 also, each browser produces slightly different results for all canvas renderings.  pixels will be slightly different from browser to browser.\n. That's a great suggestion fogbrain.  would you mind trying it out and submitting a pull request?  Otherwise I can add this to my todo list to further investigate\n. Hi Jason, not sure where you're going with this - KineticJS doesn't use the bind method anywhere in the codebase.  Could you expand a bit?\n@vc05946 can you be more specific as to what the problem is?  JS error? \n. wow okay.  I think that probably snuck in with a pull request.  I'll take a closer look at this.\n. can you guys do me a favor - I don't currently have access to an iOS 5.1 device - could you apply the change made with the fix above to your version of KineticJS, and let me know if it resolves the issue?  Thanks!\n. scratch that, I came up with a cleaner solution that completely removes the bind() dependency all together.  It didn't need to be there in the first place.  This will be included with the v4.4.2 release.\n. I don't believe this is an issue - the Label plugin is actually a group that contains Text and a special Custom Rect shape.  the Text shape itself will not have the idea - the group will.  You need to do this:\nvar id = evt.targetNode.getParent().getId();\n. great!\n. I'll look at this as soon as I can.  Will be adding webgl support this weekend.\n. Hi guys.  After a lot of careful thought and prototyping, I've unfortunately decided not to support non 2d contexts.  It's actually pretty easy to combine KineticJS with other contexts anyways, such as Three.js.  More on that here\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/282#issuecomment-16328614\n. you're absolutely right.  the remove() method in Shape is supposed to be destroy.  fixing that right now.\n. yep, it will be removed.  Shape extends Node, so Shape has access to all of Node's methods.\n. could you possibly setup a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  That would really help me fix this faster.\n. drats, I'll fix this up today and release a 4.4.3 patch.  Looks like my regression tests missed this one.  As a temp work around, you just need to add the utility back to Type.js:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/v4.4.1/src/util/Type.js#L286\nThanks!\n. hiya, have you looked at this lab?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-world-map-svg-path-with-kineticjs/\nDo you have a special highlight layer setup, so that you don't have to redraw the whole map each time?\n. P.S awesome demo.  Can I link to it from the kineticjs homepage?\n. it's not an event detection issue - it's probably a redraw issue.  are you drawing the regions on mousemove or mouseover?\n. Great!  No worries, I have yet to put up some KineitcJS performance tips on the HCT tutorials.\n. do you have a div id = \"Frame\" ?\n. are you sure that the backbone view executes after the DOM has loaded (i.e. on dom ready).\nbefore initializing the stage, you can do a test:\nconsole.log(document.getElementById('Frame'));\nto see if the Frame div is available or not.\n. the .bind method has been removed because older browsers don't support it.  It snuck in with a pull request about a week ago.  Update to the latest version of KineticJS and that error should go away.\n. I don't believe this is a bug.  isDraggable returns the draggable property, which is set to true or false.  when you use startDrag, you are forcing drag and drop regardless if the shape is draggable or not.  Forcing it to drag and drop should not auto set draggable to true\n. yep, this is absolutely a bug.  Thanks for pointing it out!  I'll have it fixed with the next release\n. you shouldn't have to do anything special to remove an image from memory.  KineticJS should remove all of the references to the image object, which means that the JavaScrip engine should auto garbage collect, unless of course your app still has a lingering reference to the image object\n. This issue has been fixed as of v4.5.4.  It will be released this weekend.  Thanks!!\n. here's the readme for unit testing:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS#testing\nlet me know if that doesn't clear things up\n. np!\n. I think you're misunderstanding remove vs. destroy.\nremove() removes a node from the stage, but keeps it intact, in case you want to re add it later, or even add it to another stage.\ndestroy() calls remove() to detach it from the stage, and then actually destroys the node so that it's no longer accessible\n. what you need is destroyAll, which will be added to the next release\n. you're looking at the minified code.  Here's the method in the source:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Global.js#L121\ncan you be more specific as to what doesn't look correct?\n. #1 you're still focusing on the minified code (you shouldn't, you should be looking at the sourcE).  #2 the minified code reads like this:\nif(c!==undefined){for(var d=0;d<c.length;d++)\nwhich is valid\n. as a side note, you can also hide the shadow with the shadowEnabled = false property so that you can preserve your shadow configs when toggling it on or off.\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Shape.php\n. Nonetheless, I'll take a look.  Opacity = 0 should work.\n. fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/85c99c1bb9c482fcca2008cf47f8dff644fa9ed7\n. Everything seems to be running great in FF and IE for me.  Can you please post your working code into a jsfiddle so I can take a look there?  I also need to know exactly at what point things are breaking.  It's likely an implementation issue since no one else has reported problems like this.\n. KineticJS doesn't support text gradients at the moment, although it will soon.  Stay tuned.\n. common technique for proper scoping in JavaScript.  Look online for information about anonymous functions.\n. will look at this as soon as I get the chance, thanks for posting :)\n. I've promoted this ticket in priority.  I'll try to get this fixed for v4.6.1\n. @edplus you are correct, I demonstrated the hit canvas issue by forking the jsfiddle here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/37pG3/\n. another update on this thread: I'm actually in the process of putting together the 4.7.0 release.  This bug is still present.  It will be fixed along with some other hit graph enhancements in v4.7.1.\n. drats, you're right, the augmented methods will be lost after serialization.  I'll have this fixed by the next release.   Thank you!\n. Image properties are serializable, but not the images themselves.  It's mentioned in the tutorials and the docs:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-load-complex-stage-with-kineticjs/\nImages aren't serializable because you'd essentially have to store giant data URLs in the json, which is just silly.\n. you can do that.  just set a custom attribute like this:\nvar image = new Kinetic.Image({\n  image: ...,\n  src: 'image-src.png'\n});\nor you can set it like this:\nimage.setAttr('src', 'image-src.png');\nwhen you call toJSON(), your custom src attr will be picked up.\n. strange.  Is this for v4.4.3?\n. Thanks!  I'll have this fixed up by the next release.\n. Thanks @lavrton.  @SneakyBobito please reopen this ticket if it's still as issue.\n. You cannot add layers inside layers.  You should be adding groups to the layers.  Here's an overview:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\n. I can see how it would work, since both Layer and Group extend Container.\nI was thinking the same thing.  I'll add some logic that prevents layers from being added to layers.\n. that's expected.  You should always call layer.draw().  if you call group.draw() or shape.draw(), the layer will not be cleared, and you will just be drawing on top of the layer.\n. Thanks for doing this!  I'll be adding the skew transform in the next release.  I'm planning on adding these methods:\nsetSkew()\nsetSkewX()\nsetSkewY()\ngetSkew()\ngetSkewX()\ngetSkewY()\nrather than working with angles.  These methods can be auto generated with the new addPointGetterSetter methods.\nAs a side note, this means that I'll have to change the skew() method in the Transform class, such that it accepts an x and y component, rather than an x and y angle.\nReally clean code btw :)\n. This will be supported eventually, stay tuned!\n. Thank you!!\n. It's working for me.  Can you post a jsfiddle of some sample code?\n. +1 yes this is working for me.  Here's a simpler use case:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/R94ZP/1/\n. You're absolutely right, it does fail.  The work around for now is that you can immediately set visible=false after instantiating\nlayer.setVisible(false);\nI'll have this fixed by v4.4.4\n. This issue is on the road map for v4.5.2:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. Hiya!  This is already fixed in the github repo.  It will be released with v4.5.0.  The problem was that the dynamic point getters were being defaulted to an object literal containing an x and y property, and all of the nodes that were defaulted with the object literal were sharing that same object (objects are modified by reference in JavaScript).  Thanks for hanging in there!\nEric\n. Not enough info here.  please repost this with more context (more code) on stackoverflow.  Thanks!\n. This is not a bug. You need to call layer.draw() to redraw the layer\n. Thanks for this!\n1 will be fixed with the next release\n2 will be solved immediately if I incorporate Green Sock transitions into KineticJS (may be coming very soon)\n. Yes, priorities shifted every so slightly.  It turns out that I'm going to release 4.5.1 with a new Tweening class, because I'm no longer going to recommend developers to use GreenSock by default.  #2 will be addressed with the new Tweening class as well (working on this right now)\n1 will make it into 4.5.2, which will be released sometime next month :)\n. KineticJS tweens now support tweening point arrays (v4.5.4).  This includes tweening Lines, Splines, Blobs, and Polygons.\n. here's an example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-animated-clown-face/\n. you're forgetting layer.draw().  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. can you submit this as a pull request?  Just create an RGBA filter in the Filters folder.  You can use the other filters as a template.  Thanks!\n. Hiya!  Performance depends on so many factors, I can't really provide you with any specific, especially without seeing your code (but, it sounds like it's a complex app, which means that I wouldn't have the time to look through it).  Would you mind reposting this on stack overflow, along with some code snippets?  If I don't get time to help you there, the stackoverflow community is usually pretty good about responding quickly.  Post a link to it from this ticket :)\n. Hiya!  This should be resolved in the latest source, which will be a part of the 4.5.0 release later this month.  The extend method no loner accepts object literals or arrays (which can be modified by reference).  If you need an immediate fix, you could pull in the source code from git, and build the library at its current state.\nSorry for the headache!\n. I'll add this to my todo list, although it's a bit lower in priority than most of the other items on the list.  Thanks!!\n. on second though, this is a pretty easy change.  I'll try and have this fixed by the next release, or the following release.  I just need to check if the node has a parent when adding it to a container.  If it does, automatically run remove() :)\n. if you build from source, that's considered bleeding edge, because there could potentially be big bugs that haven't been addressed yet.  any of the published versions are stable releases.  Are you having any issues with v4.5.4?  If so, please reopen this ticket :)\n. Two things that kill performance on mobile is Text + Shadows.  Have you tried removing shadows for the mobile experience?\n. P.S. cool demo, I'll be linking to it from the homepage soon :)\n. are you redrawing the layer afterwards?\nshape.destroy();\nlayer.draw();\n. I believe this was fixed with v4.5.4, because I fixed some issues with .remove() and .destroy() in which children were not correctly being destroyed.  Can you try with this version and see if you still have an issue?  If you do, please reopen this ticket :)\n. This is an issue with anti-aliasing.  It'l be addressed with the next release\n. This is all fixed up.  Thanks!!\n. Hiya!  I'm about to release v4.5.0.  This issue will be addressed in 4.5.1.  Stay tuned!\n. sorry, this hasn't been addressed yet.  I just need to add a check to make sure that nodes aren't added multiple times.  Should go in for the next release.  Until then, just make sure that you don't add something multiple times ;)\n. this logic has not been added in yet.  As a work around, can't you just make sure that you don't add a node twice to the stage?  Shouldn't be that hard.  if node.getParent() !== undefined, don't add it to the stage again.  That's pretty much the logic that will be added in.\n. hiya!  Are you seeing any JavaScript errors?  I'm not familiar with Qt\n. Ah okay, this means that Qt is using an older version of webkit which doesnt support requestAnimationFrame.  I have a ticket open right now to fix this for older versions of Safari, which would also resolve your problem.  The fix will be included with v4.5.1, which will be released next month.\nIf you need the fix faster, delete the RAF code block:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L200\nand set the raf variable here to FRAF.  get rid of the ternary\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L214\n. scratch that.  the problem is this line:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L206\nwhich should be returning FRAF, not Animation.fixedRequestAnimFrame, which doesn't exist\n. Fixed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ddee366f96f7374cbf7517f90ded1fa2cd43f080\nYou can either clone this github repo and do a build a yourself, or just modify the kinetic js file with this change.  Let me know if this doesn't resolve your problem\n. :)\n. Don't have the time to look through your code, but I can tell you that I've seen several really complex apps run smoothly on mobile devices with KineticJS.  Your app crashed my iPhone as well, and  I've never had it crash before :)\nCould you repost this on stackoverflow so that the community can chip in?\nis it possible to use a smaller canvas size?  I know that even if you use say a 200 * 400px sized stage on iOS, the viewport can still resize such that the stage is full screen.  Are you using caching?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\nClosing this ticket in favor of you creating a stackoverflow thread.\n. ah, you should never have been setting attrs directly to the attrs object.  It prevents a lot of things from happening, that need to happen, under the covers.  I'm surprised that your app was working before!\nIn short, you just need to go through and use setter methods.\n. for example, when setting x and y, some optimizations are made to improve draw performance by handling matrix caching.  This can only happen if you use the setX() method.\n. wow this sounds pretty serious.\naccording to my perf tests, GS actually ran a bit faster than my original implementation of Transition.  Is it possible that your patch introduced a perf hit?\nOne cool thing about using a 3rd party transition library is that it only updates properties, it doesn't handle the redraws.  KineticJS still fully controls the animation engine, and the redraw logic.  I'll take a look at this.\nAnd in terms of the license.  How can I say this.  Holy crap.  I was under the impression that GS did not require a license for use under any condition.  From this alone, I'll have to to pull it back out (won't be too much trouble).\nThanks for pointing this out!  Looks like I'll be releasing v4.5.1 soon.\n. I'm working on a new Tween class that's similar to my old Transition class.  It will be like a Lite version of TweenLite, optimized specifically for KineticJS.  It's nearly complete.  The API will be consistent with Kinetic.Animation and Kinetic filters.  The api will look like this:\nvar tween = new Kinetic.Tween({\n  node: rect,\n  x: 300,\n  ease: Kinetic.Eases.EaseInOut,\n  duration: 1\n});\ntween.play();\ntween.pause();\ntween.reverse();\ntween.reset();\ntween.finish();\ntween.kill();\ntween.goto(time);\nsimilar to Kinetic filters, the ease property will point directly to a function, not a key that maps to a function.  This will make it easier for developers to create their own easings, or even pull in easings from other libraries.\nThis will come packaged with KineticJS v4.5.1 (or it can be removed using the custom build).  It will not provide methods for tweening along curves, or controling tweening order via Timelines.  For these types of advanced use cases, I'll point people to GS. As Jack points out, most people won't need to purchase a license.  But I absolutely don't want people to create an app with KineticJS + GS, and then later find out that they need to buy a license for the GS portion, especially if they are just doing some basic tweens.\nSince this is a rewrite, I'm expecting the performance to be screaming.  stay tuned.\n. Thanks for hangin in there!  4.5.1 will be released this weekend.\n. Done.  Here's the commit:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/622041aeafb9b5bfe4108b89e9f6c156c4f55ec8\nand here's an example usage:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/tests/js/manualTests.js#L173\nI also added the ability to yoyo with a yoyo property.  I didn't have a need for a kill() method.  Anytime the tween pauses, the corresponding KineticJS animation auto stops.  If you remove a reference to the tween instance, the JS garbage collector will auto remove it from memory.\nOne last tweak that I need to add, is tween overrides.  When two tweens are tweening the same property of the same node, the last tween needs to take precedence.  I'll have a follow up commit with this tomorrow.\n. The new Tween class is a full rewrite.  The old Transition class was a port that someone from the community submitted.  There were a lot of things that I didn't like about it, such as the \"onFinished\" event name.  This has changed to \"onFinish\" to be consistent with other event types, such as onClick, onMouseover, etc.  I took out the \"ed\" :)\n. hey guys, it does turn out that a bug was introduced when refactoring the Animation class - the setTimeout fallback was lost.  It's been fixed and will be a part of 4.5.1:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule#451-apr-11-2013\n@mihhail-lapushkin can you verify if a JS error was being thrown? \n. Thanks!  I changed the onFinished key to onFinish\nthe 4.5 animation issue will affect all browers using an older version of webkit.  I believe CocoonJS uses webit, correct?\n. right, it uses accelerated canvas.  Okay.  I didn't think that KineticJS every worked wth accelerated canvas.  It's already on my todo list.\n. It is done.  v4.5.1 is live.  Here's a tutorial that shows off the new API:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-stop-and-resume-transitions-with-kineticjs/\nSorry for the confusion!\nP.S., I still fully believe that GreenSock is the best Tween library on the planet.  for more advanced use cases, drop the Tween class and go with GS.\n. transitions didn't \"stop working\" in 4.5.0, they were removed in favor of GS transitions.  Here's the changelog:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nfortunately, I've decided to drop this as well, and put back in a new Tween class that will perform better than Transition.  This will be added back into 4.5.1.  Sorry for the confusion!  stay tuned.\n. No problemo!  Wait until 4.5.1 is released.  It'l be released tonight.  \nThe old transition class was pretty limited.  The new Tween class is looking pretty slick so far :)\n. It is done.  v4.5.1 is live.  Here's a tutorial that shows off the new API:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-stop-and-resume-transitions-with-kineticjs/\nSorry for the confusion!\nP.S., I still fully believe that GreenSock is the best Tween library on the planet.  for more advanced use cases, drop the Tween class and go with GS.\n. the problem with back pat is that it bloats the code base over time.  KineticJS is still evolving pretty rapdily, so I'm not quite ready to start adding back compat in newer versions (getting close to that point though)\n. Thanks :)\n. I'll fix this up tonight.  stay tuned.\n. interesting.  I'll take a close look at this and see what's slowing down setX().  Stay tuned!\n. Hi again, could you try something for me?  comment out these two lines of code from the unminified source:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L946\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L948\nThis prevents the handling of attr change logic.  If this is the culprit, I need to consider handling attr change events differently.\n. I'll do some perf tests when I get a chance.  I'll let you know what I find.\n. This says it all:\nhttp://jsperf.com/kineticjs-setter-perf\nI knew that the attr change logic would add a little bit  of overhead, but not a 25% overhead.  I'll fix this up by requiring devs to explicitly subscribe to different attr change events via subscribe().  If an event has not been subscribed to, KineticJS won't bother traversing ancestors to see if an event handler exists.\n. and here's v4.5.2-beta (much faster)\nhttp://jsperf.com/kineticjs-4-5-1-vs-4-5-2-beta-render\n. yep.  I turned off event bubbling for attr changes.  It's kind of a weird thing to bubble anyways.\n. Interesting.  Okay thanks for this!\nP.S. I'm currently investing a whole slew of potential performance enhancements, because although KineticJS is blazingly fast on desktop apps, I want it to be as fast as possible on mobile.  Stay tuned :)\n. yes you need to use images.  the jaggedness of fill patterns is controlled by the browser rendering engine.  Not much we can do there.\n. just do this:\nshape.on('click', function(evt) {\n  var target = evt.targetNode;\n  var nodeType = target.nodeType;\n  var shapeType = target.shapeType;\n}\n. ah, yes, I'll fix this up soon.  Thanks!\n. fixed as of v4.5.2.  Thanks!\n. interesting.  This is a valid use case.  I'll add this to the release schedule for v4.5.3.  Thank you!\n. The Tween class was re written in v4.5.4.  Kinetic Tweens are no longer made up of an array of tweens.  Now, a single value is tweened between 0 and 1, and the change is applied to all of the properties.  This should resolve the problem you're seeing with v4.5.3.  Let me know if it does not.\nThanks!!\n. that sounds reasonable.  I'll add this to my todo list, thank you!\n. unfortunately, I believe that sub domains still count as different domains.  Don't ask me, I wasn't part of the WHATWG group :)\n. I'll have this fixed by the next release.  stay tuned!\n. great!  I was going to recommend moving the entire stage.\nstage.getContent().addEventListener('touchmove', function(evt) {\n  stage.setPosition(touchX, touchY);\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer){\n    layer.batchDraw();\n  });\n});\n. I see where you're going with this, but I don't think the solution is to create a new node attribute.  You might want to alternate between buttons, or you might want to enable several buttons.  Also, this doesn't really have a parallel for mobile devices (touch events)\nIf you want drag and drop to only work with specific mouse buttons, you have several options\n1) on the drag handler, you could cancel drag and drop if the mousebutton isn't the one you want by calling node.stopDrag()\n2) you could cancel event propagation on mousedown if the mouse button type isn't the one you want\n3) you could manually trigger drag and drop by hooking into mousedown, checking for the button type, and then calling startDrag()\n4) there are probably several others\n. fixed.  The algorithm now looks at the pixels around the pixel of interest if it's anti-aliased. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/aa78d632dbc89ace518890946dfc3947bcd74d89\n. which areas?  I'm able to see the click event when clicking on multiple regions\n. I see what's happening.  You're hitting anti-aliased pixels.  I updated your jsfiddle to show the hit graph below the circle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/GXWFY/20/\nnot quite sure how to solve this at the moment... very interesting edge case.\n. As a work around, if you ensure that the text is positioned at whole number pixels, anti-aliasing won't occur in the hit graph.  see if you can replicate the problem with this jsfiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/GXWFY/21/\n. I'm closing this ticket for now, although I will be investigating anti-alias issues at some point.  be on the watch for that.\n. Thank you sir!!\n. It might be browser / OS specific.  Which browser OS are you using?  are you able to repo the problem in other browsers?\n. Yes this appears to be related to newer versions of chrome.  The problem is that Chrome takes over the mouseevent, and assumes you are trying to drag and drop the canvas element offscreen as an image.  Here's the work around:\nstage.getContent().addEventListener('mousedown', function(evt) {\n        evt.preventDefault();\n      });\nThis will prevent chrome from taking over the event.  I'll add this to the next release.\n. fixed.  Releasing a patch tonight, v4.5.3\n. please repost this on stackoverflow.  Make sure you don't have a JS closure problem :)\n. Yes, please check out the revamped docs + new tutorials\nThe new Tween class is much more robust than transitionTo\n. how odd, thanks I'll look into this today\n. Thank you!\n. I'm planning on hooking jshint up to my build, but haven't had the time quite yet :)\n. I tried modifying the following tutorial to tween brightness, and it worked as expected:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-tween-blur-filter-with-kineticjs/\nCan you do the same and let me know if you can repo the problem?  \nCan you post an example on your own website showing the problem?  Try to create the simplest demo (I won't have the time to look through a lot of code).  As you've pointed out, the Brighten filter doesn't touch alphla values, so I can only suspect that something else is going on in your code.\n. Hi there!  will try my best to look into this soon.  As you might guess, I have hundreds of todo items on my plate at any moment in time.  I do offer support licenses, if you're interested, which gets you dedicated help and priority bug fixes:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Purchase-a-Support-License\nstay tuned\n. by the way, I've added a new Brighten filter tutorial here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-brighten-or-darken-image-tutorial/\nwhich doesn't seem to have any problems with opacity.\nI'm closing this ticket for now because I'm just not able to reproduce it.  I'll keep an eye out for this, and if I come across it, I'll reopen the ticket.\n. Thanks for the clarification!  I didn't realize that the problem was specific to pngs.  thank you!\n. ah interesting.  Do you think it would be a better solution to just clear the existing filter canvas?  I'm sure that will perform better than creating a new canvas each time.\n. sounds like a memory leak with destroy().  Will look into it soon, thanks!\n. ah yes, that makes sense.  It just so happens that the remove() method doesn't correctly remove children.  This is on my todo list for the next release.  Since destroy() uses remove(), calling destroy() will also fail to destroy the children, causing the memory leak that you've experienced.  Stay tuned!\n. This should be fixed now.  The latest release, v4.5.4, now correctly removes and destroys children:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#454-june-9-2013-current\nPlease reopen this ticket if this does not fix your issue!\nEric\n. transitionTo was replaced with Tween.  Here's the changelog:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nHere's updated tutorials:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-linear-transition-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. sorry about this, I'll have this fixed up soon.  The truth is, I've dropped the ball lately in terms of testing different build combinations to make sure things work as expected.  I need to create a solid suite of tests that test every build combination.  Quite a feat, but needs to be done :)\nEric\n. added this task for the next release.\n. Newer versions of Chrome broke older versions of Kinetic.  Are things working correctly for you now that you've updated to the latest KineticJS version?\n. OS?  Fill and DD work for me on Mac OSX\n. In my experience, 64 bit windows 7 is very buggy in general.  I'll look into this as soon as I can though\n. Umesh, did you verify if drag and drop is working on the tutorials:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-an-image-tutorial/\nif so, then it's likely an issue with your code\n. Umesh, also, it's nearly impossible for circles to be rendered as rectangles.  Very likely it's an issue with your code\n. to be clear, are these problems only happening on Windows 7 64bit Chrome?\n. The latest versions of Chrome have been very buggy in regards to HTML5 canvas.  It's not a KineticJS issue.  I did however make some adustments to help with a circle fill issue in Chrome 27, which is part of v4.5.4 released last night.  Try out that version to see if it helps your case.\n. surely you don't mean \"any parameter\".  x?  y?  offsetX?  offsetY? width? height? etc\n. I've tested several tweens in Firefox with starting numeric values of 0, and they all work fine.  Could you please create a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  Thanks!\n. The API changed.  please see the changelog:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nAnd the updated tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-label-tutorial/\n. This is a bug with early versions of Android.  \nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/114-canvasclearrect-bug-in-android-stock-browser/\nThe workaround is to define your stage and layer, but then add the layer to the stage after a timeout (I've used 50ms with success)\n. no, you have to create the layer, and THEN draw with a timeout, or else the timeout won't do any good.  The bug with Android is that the first thing that's drawn onto the canvas is stuck there forever, and can't be cleared.  So, if you create a layer, and add it to the stage with no shapes in it, then canvas in the layer will render with nothing in it.  Subsequent draws will be clearable. \nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage(conf);\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\nstage.add(layer);\nsetTimeout(function(){\n  // add shapes to the layer and then do layer.draw()\n}, 50);\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/test/unit/DragAndDrop-test.js#L17\n. what do you mean by \"too many global variables\"?  They aren't actually global.  They are scoped to the anonymous function wrapping the module.\n. gotchya, that's what I thought you meant.  I'll clean up the JS Hint errors by v4.5.3 :)\n. thanks!  After adding a jshint task to the build, I discovered quite a few of those.  All fixed up now\n. Thanks for doing this!  I'll take a look soon.\n. Thank you for looking into this!  The _setTextLine method has been refactored quite a bit, and getWidth() now appears to be working as expected for wrapped text.  Please reopen this pull request if the latest version of KineticJS doesn't handle getWidth() correctly.\nThanks!!\n. setX and setY works fine for text objects.  Can you create a simple jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?\nremember that x and y of the text is relative to its container, the group.  Therefore, if the group is positioned, it will affect the origin of the text.  If you want to override this behavior, you can set the absolute position via setAbsolutePosition().  Close this for now, but please reopen after you've put together a jsfiddle.\n. this was a bug with a recent release of Google Chrome.  The issue has been resolved in newer versions of KineticJS.    If you upgrade to v4.6.0, drag and drop in Chrome will work as expected.\n. that is correct.  It hasn't been implemented yet.\n. sorry guys, I'm hoping to get this added in by the next version, v4.7.3\n. Thanks for this!  It turns out, however, that you should not be calling applyFilter.  It's handled automatically inside draw() for caching reasons.  I need to put a couple of underscores in front of it to designate it as a private method.\n. yep, I have plans to eventually create an Arrow plugin, unless someone from the community creates one first :)\n. example in the docs here:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Circle.html\nwill create a tutorial on it as well soon\n. Thanks for doing this!  Sorry it took me so long (infinitely busy these days)\n. will look at this as soon as I get another Android device :)\n. I was able to replicate this - I'm shocked that more people weren't complaining about this.  Looking into it.\n. Which version of android?  This appears to be an Android bug.  Stuff drawn on the canvas element isn't able to be cleared after the first draw:\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/114-canvasclearrect-bug-in-android-stock-browser/\n. okay, the work around here (for Android 4.1.1 and 4.1.2) is to not immediately draw onto the canvas.  set a small timeout (50ms works for me) before adding layers to the stage.  I believe that this is no longer an issue with recent versions of Android.\n. I've actually never used Telerik MVC.  are there JS errors?  can you be a bit more descriptive when you say \"don't work any more\"? \nThanks!\n. precisely, I do have plans to auto toggle the listening property based on both user input (setters) and usage (on() method).  coming soon \n. update on this thread: For optimal performance, you may give the new FastLayers a try.  When you just want to draw stuff as fast as possible, and you don't care about mouse interactions, node nesting, event pub/sub, etc, FastLayers are a really good choice.  You instantiate them like this:\nvar layer = new FastLayer();\nI think this is an even better solution than managing the overhead of checking for situations when creating a hit canvas is required.\nStill, there may be cases where you want some shapes to be listened to, and others not, and for some reason you need them all in the same layer.  In this case, the hit graph will still need to be generated for the shapes that need it, and Kinetic could auto toggle off listening for shapes that have no handlers bound to them.\n. yes, the majority of the jshint problems are coming from pull requests that I've taken in.  Haven't had time to clean those up yet. It's okay if jshint doesn't pass at the moment since there's a lot of things not passing today.\n. Just wanted to note that I haven't forgotten about this thread.  some other priorities are a bit more pressing, but I'll definitely get back to this.\n. sorry it took me awhile to get this.  I setup a jshintrc file and added it to the repo:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/1dec988c27b85b3de4000479930a77ff49a62b96\nI have quite a bit of work ahead to cleanup all the jshint errors, and then hook jshint into travis CI.  That will come in time.  In the meantime, having the jshintrc file in the repo at least defines the standard of coding that's expected, and it allows people (like you) to modify the jshintrc file to enforce or relax code quality.\nThanks again!\n. your jsfiddle is wrong.  the two2 function sets listening to false again, instead of true.\n. This should all be fixed up now.  I made several fixes to Android touch events + drag and drop this morning.\n. Thanks for looking into this!  I'm currently working on a change that will enable corner radius for all shapes, including label tags.  This will be released with v4.8.0.  This way, we don't have to implement corner radius logic in each shape separately.\nThank you!\n. its in the change log here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#452-may-21-2013\nyou want to use getType() or getClassName() instead.\n. that's odd.  I found that the chrome 27 bug was occurring when you draw an arc with a stroke, in which the angle difference between the start angle and end angle was exactly 360 degrees.  I found that if it was slightly off, like 359.9999999, Chrome 27 rendered the circles correctly.  This was the fix that I put in.  May have to revisit it again.\n. I'll look into this as soon as I get a chance.  A lot of people have been asking for this.  Stay tuned!\nEric\n. you're incorrect.  take a look at this line:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L200\nonly one animation loop is used for all animations. \n. Oh I see what you mean, you're referring to the FRAF exclusively.  okay thanks, I'll take a closer look at this :)\n. you should use the least amount of layers as possible, while grouping things together intelligently.  Things that aren't updated often should be placed into one layer, while things that are updated regularly, and with other shapes, should be grouped together in their own layers.  Typically, most KineticJS apps will use between 2 and 10 layers.\n. That is correct.  I ultimately decided to use an inheritance pattern that was dead fast, in exchange for less flexibiilty.  I have a todo item to revisit the inheritance mechanism to address some of these issues, and I'll take a close look at lavrton's solution as well :)\nThanks for this!!\n. by the way, forgot to mention that you can use the getClassName() to get the class name of any node.  you can also use getType() to get the type of node.\nI'm closing this ticket for now, but have added a link to it from my todo list when I get around to taking a look at the inheritance model again.  Thank you for this!\n. it's necessary - you shouldn't ever be manually putting things into the stage container.  Just overlay the stage container on top of your image.\n. yes, Chrome 27 is very very buggy in regards to html5 canvas.  So far it doesn't appear to be KineticJS related.  staty tuned on this.\n. I made several fixes to Android touch events + drag and drop this morning, so we should be good.  Please reopen this ticket if there are still issues.\n. This was done intentionally in order to create smooth drag and drop operations.  If we were to continually stop and restart the animation, you would notice a slight lag each time you moved the mouse.  Closing this for now, but I'll put more thought into it.\n. yep, KineticJS ignores the anti-aliased pixels.  If you're drawing a 1px diagonal line, and you want it to be detectable, you need to create a custom hit function to define the hit region.  You probably will want to create a hit region that's a line which is about 5px thick or so.  Here's an example on creating custom hit regions:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-custom-hit-function-tutorial/\n. hi there, actually, KineticJS mimics native JS events and jQuery events exactly.  What you want is the \"mouseenter\" and \"mouseleave\" events, which KineticJS supports.  For more info about the difference, just do an online search for mouseover vs. mouseenter\n. it's a problem with your code.  1 out of 5 times, your randomized color index is out of bounds and returns undefined.  you need to use (len - 1) instead of len.  Updated it here http://jsfiddle.net/HCV8b/59/\n. can you create a jsfiddle showing the problem?  my unit tests are passing for id selectors\n. nice!  makes sense.  I'll pull this in soon.\n. Thanks again Gabriel.  I had to make some changes to the logic, because it turns out that we do also need preventDefault() for certain desktop browsers because the drag and drop operation triggers a drag and drop of the whole canvas element for the html5 drag and drop API which has undesired effects.  I couldn't merge in this pull request due to the extensive changes, but I still gave you credit in the change log.  Thanks!\n. ah, yes, this has been resolved.  There were some antialias issuese with the event detection awhile back but they were resolved with this block of code:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Layer.js#L14\n. when clicking on a circle, move it to its own layer first.  i.e. you need to create a layer specfiically for animations, such as animLayer = new Kinetic.Layer();  Also, windows phones will generally be a bit slower than apple or Android\n. This is very cool!  I'll look closer into this soon.\n. Hi again!  I was just looking at this pull request again - what do you think about creating a new distortion transformation that all nodes can use, not just images?  Currently KineticJS supports translate, rotate, scale, and skew.  We could do something like this:\nvar circle = new Kinetic.Circle({\n  radius: 5,\n  fill: 'red',\n  distortion: [0, 0, 10, 50, 10, 100, 0, 10]\n});\nWhat doyou think?\n. I'll take a crack at integrating the distortion transform into Node sometime this weekend and I'll let you know what I find.  Stay tuned!\n. Thanks for this!  I'm going to tweak it a little bit such that selectors are separated by commas to mirror CSS selector rules.\n. hey gaddie, it looks like the change broke the unit tests.  There were several problems with the logic that was introduced.  I fixed them up, and cleaned up the get method even further:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e6a9324d50c98c97292b062131f984729792dc35\n. no worries!  Thanks again for getting this rolling\n. +1\n. you need to redraw the layer with layer.draw()\n. for performance reasons, I chose not to auto redraw the hitgraph, for the same reasons that I do not redraw the scene graph whenever you update node properties.  to redraw the hitgraph, you should be able to do the following:\nlayer.drawHit()\nlet me know if this doesn't work for you\n. currently no, you need to do something like this:\nlayer.add(child);\nchild.setZIndex(5);\n. +1 Jason Follas made some changes awhile back that addressed this issue.  Should be fixed.  Please reopen if it's still an issue.\n. don't add layers inside layers.  you need to add groups inside layers.\n. Thank you for doing this!  Looking at this right now.\n. At a quick glance, these look like great changes!  I've been meaning to add color / convolution filters.  I'll go ahead and pull this in and play around with it and let you know what I find.\nAs a site note, KineticJS is starting to get a bit filter heavy, so I probably need to create separate builds just for the filters.  Stay tuned on that one.\n. nice work!  The filters look great.\n. you should update the Filter files with the @author tag for credits\n. Hi again, I was looking more into your code and you've done some really awesome work!  A few questions / comments:\n1) did you notice that the convolve related filters create a black border around the image?\n2) is there a difference between your Lighten / Darken and the currently existing Brighten filter?  Brighten can take positive values to brighten the image, and negative values to darken it\n3) You've put a lot of filters inside the same file, because they all use the same functions, but with different params.  Perhaps we should change Convolution to ConvolutePack, to indicate that the file includes multiple filters.  Same comment for the Colors filter. Maybe it could be ColorizePack.  This will be helpful when people create custom builds: http://kineticjs.com/configurator.php.  On the topic of naming conventions, you'll notice that all of the currently existing filters are verbs for consistency.  Can we do the same for yours?\n4) Another neat thing about filters is that they are tweenable.  Here's an example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-tween-blur-filter-with-kineticjs/.  This is only possible if the filter params are numbers.  Do you think its possible to create wrappers around your existing Filter functions to allow numeric parameters?  This way we could tween your filters, such as Emboss and Sharpen.  i.e. an emboss value of 0 could mean no Emboss, and a value of 100 could mean a lot of Emboss.\n5) is there a difference between your blurring functions, and the currently existing Blur filter?  Should the Blur filter be removed in favor of your filters?\nThanks again for your awesome work!  If you don't have time to work on these any further, no worries.  I'd still like to get your thoughts.\n. KineticJS handles this automatically if you use the Kinetic.Animation for your loop.  Everything hooks into the KineticJS animation engine, which means that layers are only redrawn once per frame, no matter how many animations are tied to a particular layer.\n. don't do that, it will trigger a redraw hundreds of times per second.  you need to use batchDraw().  I'll be releasing a new version soon with an improved version of batchDraw that performs much better than the current version.  It will be apart of v4.6.0.  Watch out for that.  When it's released, you should replace stage.draw() with stage.batchDraw();\n. absolutely.  stage.batchDraw() will be perfect for this case as well.  just keep checking for v4.5.5 to be released.  Should be released in the next couple of weeks.\nIn fact, you could technically always use stage.batchDraw(), unless it's absolutely necessary to redraw something immediately.\n. now that Kinetic supports batchDraw, closing this ticket.  Here's the tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-batch-draw/\n. Interesting, I'll add this to my todo list.  Thank you!\n. That's pretty interesting.  I've had several other requests that are similar to this one.  Perhaps any attribute could be set to a function.  I'll add this to my todo list.  My only concern is the possibility that it could impact performance when constantly checking if things are functions are not.  stay tuned.\n. can you provide a screenshot or jsfiddle?  KineticJS automatically handles pixel ratio adjustments by increasing the stage width and scale to create a sharp image.  Are you saying that the canvas appears to be twice as big as it should be, or just has a style that's set to twice the amount that you're expecting?\n. ah shoot, that's too bad.  The quick fix would be to disable the pixelRatio by just hard coding it to 1.  I'll look into creating a public way of setting or retrieving the current device pixel ratio.\n. Closing this ticket for now because I'm in the process of adding more docs to explain pixel ratio.\n. mobile events are working for me on this page:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-mobile-events/\nI'm using iOS.  What device are you using?  what code are you using?  jsfiddle demo?\n. you need to read through the change logs to see what changed, or go through the tutorials\nwww.kineticjs.com\n. can you create a simple jsfiddle showing the problem?  It will be easier to debug there.\n. great observation.  I'll take a look, as there are probably several solutions to this.\n. Thanks guys for bringing this up.  It will be addressed soon.\n. @hohmann that will definitely help, but may not be ideal, because it means that the first tween will render immediately, and the other tweens will have to wait for the next animation loop to start tweening.  This could result in the first tween jumping ahead at first.\n. no updates so far.  The fix will be in the next release, v4.7.3, which will be released sometime next month.\n. This is by design. the dragstart event should not be fired until the mousedown event has occurred, and the mouse has started to move.  It sounds like you should just be hooking into the mousedown event instead.\n. Thanks for looking into this!  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.  KineticJS v4.6.1 will resolve all of the pixel ratio issues\n. thank you!  this is the same fix that I came up with.  It turns out that I also did some refactoring for the clip() method so I couldn't pull in your request.  I'll still credit you in the change log though.\nThanks again!\n. Haven't forgotten about this, will take a look as soon as I get a chance.  This definitely needs to be addressed one way or another.\n. question: is it true that checking the 4 pixels around a pixel with an alpha < 255 is accurate?  I would think that it's possible that adjacent pixels could also have an alpha < 255 depending on the angle of the edge.  We could go to all 8 pixels, but I wonder if that's accurate as well.  I'll try to manually merge this in since it's been awhile. (sorry about that)\n. Okay, here's the deal.  I started reviewing my code for getIntersection, and I was horrified.  There's lots of bad stuff in there.  You are definitely on the right track, and I like your unit tests.  However, rather than merging in what you have, I've chosen to rewrite the getIntersection methods, and pull in some of your logic (I'll give you credit in the change logs).  Stay tuned!\n. fixed.  The algorithm now looks at the pixels around the pixel of interest if it's anti-aliased. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/aa78d632dbc89ace518890946dfc3947bcd74d89\n. Thank you so much for getting this started!  I'll add your name to the release schedule.\n. and this one: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/658064b5ef1d22a85b6fe7f507a0b6851a5cf216\n. node.id is a Kinetic generated id for each node that shouldn't really be useful for you.  Also, you should not use spaces for names and ids (think CSS selectors).  you can use \"-\" or \"\"\n. +1 support for this was added with v5.0.0.  I have yet to create a tutorial for it.\n. Here's a lab that uses an array of filters:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-animals-on-the-beach-game-with-kineticjs/\nOn mouseover, a brighten + blur filter is applied\n. +1 you can now cache any node, and apply filters to any node, including layers, groups, and shapes.  I believe this was introduced with v5.0.0\n. here's an updated filter example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-invert-image-tutorial/\nIn this tutorial, we're applying a filter to an image, but you can apply filters to anything.\n. exactly.  This is a constraint of the w3c spec for where strokes are positioned, so the rules are a bit different than Photoshop.\n. will do, as soon as I get a chance.\n. Thanks for looking into this.  And yes, these are some of the things that I've addressed with v4.6.0.\n1) yes, the getStage() method has to walk up the node tree everytime it's called.  I was considering adding this to the new caching system\n2) clear() is a bit expensive, as expected.  The cost of clearing can be reduced with the new clip feature that's being added in 4.6.0\n3) the _fireAndBubble method was being called hundreds of times per redraw because draw events were bubbling. draw events no longer bubble as of 4.6.0\n4) this is the getter method used for all attributes.  It only shows up in your results because it's called so often.  It's a fast method\n5) this is the getParent method.  Same as number 4, it's fast, just called often\n6) the visible attr has already been added to the new caching system.  Previously, it would crawl up the node tree to calculate visibility every time it was called.\n7) drawScene was further optimized with 4.6.0.  the _applyAncestorTransforms method is much faster, because I'm now double caching matrix transforms.  I'm caching the transform matrix at the node level, as well as the absolute transform matrix.  This has sped things up quite a bit.  This is also where the draw events were being fired, which was expensive in 4.5.5\n8) _applyAncestorTransform, as mentioned above, this is no longer an issue because the transforms are cached.  Here's what it looks like if you're interested:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L863\nThanks again for looking into these!  These findings validate all of the work that I've been working on this weekend.  So far, KineticJS is a little over 10% faster with all of these fixes.  The only one that I haven't addressed yet is number 1, but I'll do that before I release 4.6.6\nCheers,\nEric\n. Hi there!  Did you get my message about possibly joining the KineticJS team?  You've done some fantastic work with the filters, so we'd love to have you.\n. This is an interesting idea, although I'm not sure it would fit cleanly into the KineticJS node tree model.  I.e., it might be odd to set text properties on a stage or layer node.\n. I have a todo item for the next release (v4.6.0) to reinvestigate the text default logic, so I'll definitely keep this in mind when I get there.\n. this is the expected behavior.  if you want to scale the line and circle together, you need to scale its container (the layer).  You could also create a scaled group, and then add the shapes to that group. \nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer({\n  scale: 2\n});\n. Truly sorry for the headache.  This issue will be fixed by v4.6.1 or v4.6.2, depending on priorities.  Thanks for hanging in there!\n. good to know, thanks!  I'm planning on knocking out all of the device pixel ratio issues in the next release, v4.6.1.  Thanks for the heads up!\n. Interesting, this appears to be a bug with Firefox, which they've marked as WON'T FIX\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809788\nIt's not KineticJS specific, and there's not really a clean way to work around this.  The Firefox devs seem to be a bit stubborn about this issue.  I'm closing this for now, but will keep it in mind.\nBtw, the point of the pixel ratio adjustments is to ensure sharp drawings.  On devices with a pixel ratio != 1, the canvas drawings will appear blurry without the adjustments.  Overall, it's very good to have this in place, because it effects many mobile devices, tablets, iMacs, etc.\n. As a reference, there does appear to be a possible solution to obtain the  Firefox zoom level\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1713771/how-to-detect-page-zoom-level-in-all-modern-browsers\nBut it's extremely hacky, and may possibly have unwanted side effects.  If you really need this, you could try and detect when the zoom has changed:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6163174/detect-page-zoom-change-with-jquery-in-safari\nand then try out the above approach to get the zoom level, adjust the pixel ratio accordingly, and then recreate the layer canvases.\nIt's a lot of hoops to jump throug to work around a Firefox bug :(\n. Thanks!  Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ae66350d7f7c6d96653ef321c7a5ee833ed6d82e\n. I don't think this is an elegant solution.  As pointed out by the person asking the question, it would make sense to have a way to apply a transform to a node, such as shape.setTransform().  I'll add this to my todo list, thanks!\n. you were using ids incorrectly.  Like DOM, ids must be unique.  you were using an id=overlay for multiple shapes, so only the last id was accessible.  I changed the id to a name.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/7YJMv/\nAs a side note, you can also select nodes by type, such as Layer.get('Group'), or group.get('Rect').  This way, you don't have to add names to everything.  Also, you'll see improved performance if you use event delegation.  example here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-get-event-shape-with-kineticjs/\n. Thanks!  Each of the browsers handle dash arrays differently, so I probably just need to update the dash array logic.  That can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Canvas.js#L385\nI'll try to get this fixed up by the next version.\n. ah yes, IE9 and IE10 do not support line dashes, so KineticJS falls back to a solid stroke.  IE11, however, will support line dashes.  Safari currently does not support line dashes, although I believe they plan to with the webkitLineDash property.  It does not work as of today.  Here's the KineticJS code that handles the cross browser compat:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Context.js#L297\nSo long story short, as of today, dashed lines are only supported in Chrome and Firefox, and will be supported soon with IE11.\n. I'll have this setup for v5.0.1, coming out in a couple of weeks.  I need to auto update the bower package info with the grunt build.  Stay tuned on that.\n. done.  The bower json file generation has been hooked into the grunt build, and the kineticjs minified file has been added to root.  Let me know if this doesn't work for you guys.\n. there's actually not much desktop specific code at all.  You'll only find a little bit in Stage.js, about 100 lines.  compared to the 14,000 lines that makes up KineticJS, this is pretty insignificant. \n. actually I don't believe this is necessary.  Do you know of any articles discussing <!DOCTYPE> vs. <!DOCTYPE html>?\n. Closing this because the test suite has been rewritten.\n. ah.  Very interesting use case.  Do you think an array of box objects would work? i.e.\ngroup.setClip([\n  [0, 0, 100, 50],\n  [0, 50, 50, 100]\n]);\nI can add this functionality to an upcoming release.\n. I'm unable to replicate this.  I think there must be something else going on.  can you create a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?\n. scratch that, I am able to replicate the issue.  It only occurs if you have an offset.  I'll get this fixed up with v4.6.1.  Thanks!\n. precisely.  I ust wonder if we can hook into the native support for performance reasons.  I haven't had a chance to look into this one.\n. It turns out that this is a Chrome specific issue with HTML5 canvas.  It's not an issue with KineticJS, and I don't believe there's any way to correctly resolve the issue from KineticJS's end.\nFor the time being, the work around is to not use huge scale factors, but instead scale the position of each point that makes up the line.\n. Thank you!\n. yes, I need to add an attr blacklist to the clone method to make sure I don't clone the id.  This fix will probably make it ot the v4.7.1 release\n. Thanks everyone!\nGoogle Chrome clearly doesn't have any unit tests for canvas changes.  They break stuff every other release.\n. Google Chrome is notorious for releasing canvas bugs.  It seems like every release breaks something.  Let's give this a couple days to see if they resolve the issue.\n. This logic is already built into the getHeight() method.  Check it out here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Text.js#L167\nYou should always use getHeight to get the height of the text object because it does all of the calculations for you.\n. The confusion is my fault for not writing better docs for the method.  I'll fix this soon.\n. ah yes, great catch.  fixing now.\n. Sorry guys, this is fixed. It will be in the next release in about a week\n. you're overwriting the drawFunc with a method that doesn't use the canvas renderer methods, so you lose out on events.  You have two options:\n1) use the Kinetic.Path method and pass in SVG data like the path tutorial here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-path-tutorial/\n2) create a Kinetic.Image and set the image attr to your svg shape, and then use createImageHitRegion to create a hit region, like this tutorial\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-pixel-detection-with-kineticjs/\n. It should. If it does not, you could try scaling it with setScale()\n. Thank you!  I'll try this out as soon as I get a chance.\n. as per the documentation, functions are not serializable (security constraints).  You'll have to reapply the filters after you've deserialized the JSON.\n. Thanks Jason \n. very cool!  At some point soon, I plan on adding a gallery of extensions to the KineticJS website.  These extensions (plugins) should be hosted on individual github accounts, and KineticJS will link to them (along with user reviews).  So to answer your question, you should create a separate github project, with documentation about how to use your plugin.  \nThanks so much for putting this together!  I'll keep this ticket open until I've built the gallery page.\n. Good call. This will definitely get fixed, it's just a question of when\n. +1 yes this is a bug with Chrome and HTML5 Canvas.  Hopefully they resolve this soon.\n. By the way, the width of text varies from browser to browser.  You should be taking text.getWidth() into account for the next x calculation.  I believe this is what you're seeing.  Please reopen if this doesn't help.\n. Let me clarify a bit on what's happening.  Currently, when you drag and drop a shape, the hit graph is not redrawn on each animation frame to help improve drag performance.  As a result, shapes are temporarily undetectable. \nWhat you really need is true collision detection + dragover / dragout.  I have plans to support these, but haven't gotten around to it yet.\n. This is fixed with v5.0.0 which will be released this week.  Here's the changelog\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. just to clarify, this does appear to be related to TextPath specifically.  If you just use Text, everything works correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/BaTxP/\nYou mentioned that there may be missing restores, so I'll check out the TextPath draw func.  Also, you use layer.getContext().getTrace() if you want to see strict trace string, or layer.getContext().getTrace(true) for the relaxed trace string\n. fixed.  You were right Jason, somehow I deleted a restore() from the text path draw func.  Fixed it up, and added a test that uses the new nifty context trace :)\n. Hiya, there's three different topics in this ticket:\n1) Retina display: can you explain what you mean by \"works fine on non-retina, but not on Retina\"  What exactly is not working?  is the problem being caused by the JS error that you mentioned?  If there is a problem, it's probably related to pixel ratio calculations.  Retina displays typically have a pixel ratio of 2.  Try setting Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1 before you've instantiated any layers.  This will prevent pixel ratio calculations.\n2) \"Unable to create image hit region\" This warning is thrown if you've created an image hit region for an image that's not on the same domain as the code executing it.  In other words, your app needs to be running on a web server. It won't work locally.  This is a security constraint set by the w3c.\n3) the event.layerX error is probably related to a logic change that was made recently with the setMousePosition method.  We'll look into this.\n. I was thinking the same thing.  the current logic isn't sound anyways, because if evt.layerX is zero, we are still falling back to the _getContentPosition() block on line 580.  we should split the logic up into if else blocks, and also cache some of the variables.  I'll take a look real quick\n. it appears that this is a jQuery warning, not an error:\nhttps://drupal.org/node/1420984\nare you using jQuery on the page as well?\n. scratch that, it's just a Chrome warning.  There's a lot of jquery threads about this because people who are using jQuery are seeing this warning as well.\n. perhaps we should just check for the layerX case at the end of the ternary.  I'll keep looking.\n. @ellenm1 what device are you using?\n. @jfollas what do you think of this commit above?\n. @jfollas actually, I think we can remove evt.layerX/Y entirely.  FF appears to support evt.pageX/Y.  Check the commit above.  what do you think?\n. @jfollas okay what do you think of the above commit.  We are using UA detection now.\n. This should be fixed up now.  I resolved several pixel ratio issues.  They will be added to the 4.7.3 release going out this weekend.  Please reopen this ticket if your issues are still not resolved.\n. is this working now?  What was the issue?\n. greensock is really nice.  Definitely recommend checking it out.\n. KineticJS core will probably never support inertial scrolling.  This is more appropriate as a plugin (like the Greensock plugin)\n. you need to just use this.clear().  The clear() method is now in the Context class.  i.e. you can clear the canvas doing one of these:\nlayer.clear();\nor\nlayer.getCanvas().getContext().clear()\n. ahhh, I see what you mean.  This is a very, very bad bug!  Just fixed it up.  layer.clear() now also correctly clears the hit context, and I added unit tests to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThanks guys!\n. I'll release 4.7.1 sometime today or tomorrow with the fix.\n. replaced fill() with fillShape() in the hit draw function for Sprite.  This was a regression introduced with the major refactorings done for 4.7.0\n. Haven't been able to look into this yet, but one thing you can try is to force the pixel ratio to 1 like this:\nKinetic.pixelRatio = 1;\nand you'll need to do that before you instantiate any layers.  Devices with retina displays have a pixel ratio of 2, which means that KineticJS has to do a bit of extra work to sharpen the scene graph.  Setting it to 1 prevents all of this extra work from happening.\n. I can look into this when I get a chance (won't be for awhile though, unless someone else from the team gets a chance).  It's probably pixel ratio related.  As a work around, you can set Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1.  You can also use the Kinetic.UA object if you need browser or device dection.\n. Thanks for looking into this!  Not sure if I'm entirely sold on bringing in 200 lines of JS to fix a problem with iOS 6 and 7 for very large images.  I'll think on it\n. Let's do it.  Would you like to submit a pull request?  You can use Kinetic.UA to detect the user agent\n. this will make it to the next release, which will be later this month, or early December.  The suggested fixes in this thread are on the right track, if you need a quick fix.\n. nice work!  This is a very interesting idea.  Originally I was supporting user defined drawing functions which is very flexible, but requires a bit more work to setup.  It seemed like 99% of people who were interested in using clip functions just needed a rect, so I removed the user defined functions, and added the clipping bounding box.  This also makes it easy to transition.  At any rate, I'll keep this in mind, and I'll come back to this in the near future.\n. Closing this one for now.  I believe that if I decide to support custom clipping shapes in the future, it would be cool if it could hook into an actual arbitrary shape node (like a Star for example) so that the clipping function can be updated, animated, and tweened.  Thanks again for bringing this up!\n. that's odd.  I have an Android 4.1.1 Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and it seems to be working great.  what happens on your device?  Exactly which device do you have?\n. you need to use groups.\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\n. hiya!  One thing that changed form 4.6.0 to 4.7.2 is the way that nodes are rendered who have both a fill and stroke, and an opacity or shadow.  Before 4.7.2, nodes with both a fill and stroke who also had an opacity or shadow were not rendered correctly due to the canvas spec.  I.e., if you have a shape with both a fill and stroke, and an opacity was applied to the shape, you could see the fill beneath the stroke, because the canvas applies opacities to both the stroke and fill.  v4.7.2 addresses this use case by rendering those shapes onto a buffer canvas, copying the result onto the scene canvas, and then applies an opacity to the whole shape.  This means that performance will suffer a bit for those use cases.\nDoes your application have any shapes with both a fill and stroke, and also has an opacity or shadow applied?  If so, you'll see much better performance if you remove one of these properties (stroke, opacity, or shadow).  If not, you could use toImage() to cache a shape as image so that it doesn't have to be redrawn.\nThoughts?\n. yes, Ill add a config option that enables \"lazy opacity and shadows\" to help boost performance, if the dev doesn't care about the stroke / fill problem with canvas.  This will be added to v4.7.3\n. 4.7.3 schedule: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. @villabolo that is correct.  in v4.7.3, I'll add a config option that improves performance but degrades the rendering quality if so desired (essentailly making things render as they did before 4.7.2)\n. i.e., I was thinking of adding a new strokeShadowEnabled=false, which means that the shadow is only applied to the filled portion of a shape, which improves performance (this is the way shadows worked automatically in v4.7.1 and earlier).  \nLikewise, I may add another attribute that reduces opacity rendering quality for shapes with both a stroke and fill to further improve performance (as it was before v4.7.2)\n. Later this month.   I released v4.7.3 early because there were a lot of pixel ratio issues that needed to be hot fixed.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. the answer to this one is pretty straightforward - you should never append DOM elements to containers that a library has created for you.  The kinetic-content element is for KineticJS elements only.  you need to do this instead:\n<div>\n  <div id=\"container\">\n    <!-- Kinetic adds stuff here -->\n  </div>\n  <!-- you can add more stuff here -->\n</div>\n. the hit context should not render shadows.  This is by design.  Can you be more specific as to how you are getting an error?  can you copy and paste the exact error you're getting?\n. clipping works correctly in v4.7.2 as far as I can tell.  can you create a jsfiddle that demonstrates the problem?  I suspect that there's something in your code causing the issue.\n. never mind, I was able to replicate the issue.  Clipping isn't working correctly when the container has shapes with shadows.  I'll get this fixed up by the next release.  Thanks!\n. the API slightly changed.  if you want to hook into a click event that's anywhere on the stage, you need to use:\nstage.on('contentClick', function(){...});\n. Thank you!\n. v 4.7.0 and 4.7.2 are working correctly for me.  What browser and device are you using?  can you be more specific than \"it bugs out\".\nAlso, try v 4.7.2.  There were some pixel ratio issues with 4.7.0, that may be causing you problems on a device with retina displayl\n. fixed!  This will be in the 4.7.3 release going out this weekend.\n. can you post the code on jsfiddle?\n. Are you using Firefox with the zoom != 100%?\n. I think you guys are misunderstanding mouseover, mouseout, vs mouseenter and mouseleave.  Do you guys have experience with those events when managing DOM?  KineitcJS matches DOM event behavior exactly (as well as jQuery).  I updated the jsfiddle to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/5eQDM/\nDo a search online for mouseenter and mouseleave and tell me what you think.\n. are you attaching mouseenter and mouseleave to the container node? i.e. a group or layer.  Attaching mouseenter or mouseleave directly on a shape will have the same result as mouseover or mouseout.\n. Thanks @kzhdev I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.  BTW thanks for looking into all these issues.\n. fixed!  https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/623\n. Yep this was the issue.  fixed + some refactoring with this commit: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/224436aa182a87a6f54a7eafd2f771d13ac7e119\nThis will be in v4.7.3 released this weekend.\n. Here, I created a JS fiddle for you and everything seems to be working correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/6KSbv/\nI suspect that there's something weird going on with your code to cause the error.  Try and see if you can update the jsfiddle to replicate your issue.  If you can, please reopen this.\n. a fixed request animation frame (FRAF) yields better performance for drag and drop.  Without it, the node that you're dragging and dropping will lag a bit behind the cursor.\n. It looks like you're running into a very slim edge case.  It looks like KineticJS is storing an invalid click start position because you're creating the rectangle on mousedown.  When the mouseup event is triggered, the error is thrown there.  As a work around for now (you should be doing this anyways for performance) you can add listening: false to the rectangle so that it's not detectable.  Here's the working fiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/JtZ8c/\n. Thanks @pdille I was able to repro this as well.  I was thinking of the same fix that you've proposed.  This should make it to the next release.\n. done!  Thanks guys for your patience.  I have a crazy todo list for v5.0.0 coming out soon, so I've been neglecting the issue list temporarily :P\n. It sounds like we need to create a remove() extender for Images to make sure filter stuff is cleaned up.  Similarly to the Layer extender here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Layer.js#L202\n. yes, this is a known issue that will be addressed with the next release (v4.3.3).  Thanks!\n. I suppose this could be added in an as enhancements.  It would be a bit of a lower priority compared to the other issues, to it might take a few versions to get it in.\n. Thanks for fixing this Andrew!\n. At some point I need to hook jshint into the build & Travis CI\n. This isn't a bug with KineticJS.  The lab that you're referring to is just that, a lab.  It wasn't built to support that use case.  The lab code needs to change (if your requirement is added in), not KineticJS\n. Can you put together a simple jsfiddle that demonstrates the problem?  My guess is that we are making assumptions based on how the lab is coded\n. I'm not sure you know what I meant - the purpose of creating a JS fiddle is to creating the simplest possible example that demonstrates a problem.  I created this fiddle for us:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/MBQxm/\nIt's a simple group that contains two shapes.  If you uncomment the commented out line, the group is correctly offset, and the shapes are in the correct location.  You proposed that changing the offset of a group affects its children position, which isn't true for this jsfiddle.  Am I missing something?\n. thanks @ippo615 !\n. @kzhdev I agree with you that the docs aren't perfect.  Doing my best to continually improve them :)\n. I believe the issue is that we do not need to force the pixelRatio to be 1, and should instead allow the computed pixel ratio to take affect (this happens in the canvas constructor).  i.e., rather than setting pixelRatio=2 for your case, we just need to delete that line entirely.  I'll do some testing and check in the fix if it works.\n. This is fixed up now.  Thanks for taking a look!\n. You need to upgrade to v4.7.4.  Pixel ratio issues were addressed in v4.7.3\n. Closing this for now. Please reopen if v4.7.4 does not resolve the issue\n. +1 this is not a bug, you should not be modifying the transform object directly because you bypass the caching system.  use move(), setX(), setY(), setPosition(), or setAbsolutePosition()\n. Interesting, I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance\n. you cannot run start() until the shape is added to the group, the group is added to a layer, and the layer is added to the stage.  Please reopen this ticket with a code snippet if this doesn't solve your problem.\n. I'll take a look at this when I can.  The right way to go is to to do something like this in Kinetic.Image:\nif (Kinetic.UA.browser === 'ios') {\n  // override some methods\n}\nthis way the logic is only executed once, when KineticJS is first setup\n. Thanks, I'll look at this again this week.  Stay tuned.\n. Hiya, yes, with v5.0.0.  Here's the release schedule:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. I'm still in the process of wrapping up the new documentation for all of the API changes in v5.0.0.  It's the biggest release in KineticJS's history.  Since this seems like a pretty burning issue, I'll still try to get this fix in before I release.  I plan to build a beta release and start doing integration testing with Html5CanvasTutorials by the end of this week.  If things go smoothly, v5.0.0 should be released during the weekend, maybe sooner.\n. v5.0.0 was too big of a release, so I had to cut out a lot of things that I was planning on putting in (including a fix for this ticket).\nI'm planning on taking a week off and letting v5.0.0 stew a bit more to see if there are any issues (there's already one that I just fixed).  I'll release v5.0.1 the following week (end of January) which will be a small patch that only contains high priority bug fixes.  Here's the revised release schedule so far:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\nStay tuned!\n. Haven't forgotten about this thread.  I spent a few minutes looking into this, and it's pretty clear that this change could have a lot of side effects.  I feel that it's a fairly high risk change, which means that I need to spend a solid couple of nights reverse engineering stomita's library, and making sure that it doesn't cause side effects with pixel ratio adjustments, event handling, caching, data urls, the toImage method, filters, image size getters, etc.  \nIn the past, these types of hacky work arounds for a bug with a specific device, browser, or OS often times aren't worth the effort because they eventually get fixed.  However, there's a lot of people on this thread that clearly need a fix, so I will continue to investigate.\nI don't want this to hold back the 5.0.1 patch, which fixes a lot of issues that affects everyone.  So, unfortunately I'll have to push this fix to 5.0.2 and I will get to it asap. \nFor those of you that need a fix now, the changes in this pull request look like they are in the right direction.  I'd suggest forking the KineticJS repo and trying to pull the changes in, and see if it fixes your issues.  Even if it does cause side effects, you might not notice them depending on the features of KineticJS that you're using. \n. Thanks!  This is a known issue.  Will hopefully be fixed up soon.\n. * copied from above *\nnever mind, I created a JS fiddle which shows that this is working correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/X9U4H/\nI created a custom class, instantiated it, cloned it, and ran a method on the clone. It's working as expected.\nPlease reopen this ticket if you feel that this is still an issue.\n. no problemo!\n. agreed, this is something that I've been needed to work on, but it's been de-prioritized.  Would you like to give it a shot?\n. The challenging part is that the defaults are stored inside each getter method.  In order for the toObject method to know about these defaults, we'd have to pull all of them out into some kind of default map that getters can access, and toObject() can access. (not a walk in the park)\n. very smart!  I like that approach\n. can you submit a pull request with this change?  I think this is a great solution.\n. nicely done!!!\n. Thanks for looking into this!  It turns out that I will soon be deprecating the beforeFrame func, and I'll also remove the function deletion behavior.  Soon, you'll be able to do this:\nsprite.on('frameChange', function(evt) {\n  if (evt.frame === 2) {\n    // do whatever you want\n  }\n});\nThis will be much more flexible, and consistent with other event bindings.\n. Done!  You need to use this instead:\nsprite.on('indexChange', function(evt) {\n  var oldVal = evt.oldVal;\n  var newVal = evt.newVal;\n});\nThis is available today, and is much more flexibile than afterFrame().  afterFrame has now been removed.\n. Class.extend has been deprecated.  Please use Kinetic.Util.extend instead.  Here's an example class that extends the Shape class:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Circle.js\n. +1 v3.x was using a very slow class extender.  It has since been replaced with Kinetic.Util.extend.  Please take a look at some sample shape classes for examples:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Circle.js\n. Actually, this is a legit issue:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/qPWja/\nneed to call getTextWidth()\n. right.  if you set the width and height property, you're essentially defining a bounding box that the text must fit inside (like a max width and height).  It's not called maxWidth and maxHeight, though, for consistency.  getTextWidth() returns the width of the longest text string in a multi line string.  getWidth() returns the width set by the user, or the calculated width which takes into account padding. \n. cool app!\nCurrently I do not intend to support the capturing phase.  Your use case could be easily handled by listening for an event on a Kinetic Node, and then attaching an event handler that traverses the children and does something with each, like this:\nnode.getChildren().each(function(child) {\n  // do something with each child, or traverse downwards further\n});\n. Thanks!  I squeaked this one into 4.7.4 because I had to release a hotfix.\n. how odd, I'll fix this and release v4.7.4 this weekend if there's an issue.  Strangely, I have several unit tests that cover touch events which are passing.  Stay tuned.\n. figured it out.  It turns out that KineticJS techincially has had this bug all along, but it never surfaced until the _setPointerPosition() method was refactored in v4.7.3.  The problem was that I was assuming that the touchend event returns a touches array from the event obect which contains one touch element, which contains the touch position.  This is incorrect.  After the refactor, since the touches array length is zero for the touchend event, the x and y coordinates were being defaulted to 0, which does not intersect your shape (unless your shape intersects 0,0) and therefore doesn't execute the touchend event.\nI'm adding some tests around this use case and will psh out v4.7.4 shortly.\nThanks!\n. v4.7.4 is now available on kineticjs.com.\nThanks again!\n. this would be a great stackoverflow question.  Can you repost this there?  Github issues are for bugz\n. btw, I think you're looking for drag bounds: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-bounds-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. Try updating to the latest version and see if it's still an issue.\n. Thank you for this!  This is quite involved, so I'll need to look closely as soon as I get a chance.  Stay tuned.\n. This is actually a bug with chrome - it doesn't apply shadows correctly to elements copied from a buffer canvas (while all other browsers do).  The next version of kinetic will offer some options to get around this, but ultimately it's an issue with Chrome.\n. 4.7.2 includes logic to essentially fix a bug with the w3c spec in regards to shadows.  If you draw a shape that has both a stroke and fill, and you apply a shadow, the shadow is applied to the stroke and fill separately.  For this case, 4.7.2 draws the shape onto a buffer canvas, copies the result onto the visible canvas, and then applies a shadow.  While this produces the correct result, it's slower than drawing directly onto the scene canvas.\nTo remedy this, 4.7.4 will offer a config option to lazily render shadows, such that the result isn't quite correct, but it's performant.\nHere is the logic that determines if a buffer canvas is needed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Shape.js#L221\nIn the meantime, if you avoid this condition, you can avoid using the buffer canvas copy.  You can also get around this by caching your shapes with toImage().  \nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\n. Way cool!  I'll take a look as soon as I can\nEric\nSent from my iPad\nOn Nov 6, 2013, at 9:41 PM, Anton Lavrenov notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHello.

Thank you guys for looking into this. I'll have a patch for this soon. Chrome seems to break canvas functionality on a pretty regular basis. I guess they don't do any testing before releases\n. sorry guys, haven't been able to look into this yet.  I'm planning on taking a look tomorrow.  Sorry for the delay!\n. unfortunately, I can confirm that Google Chrome is the buggiest browser out there in regards to HTML5 Canvas.  They seem to break things with every release.  Even simple things like drawing circles!\n. +1\n. thank you!\n. You're correct, assuming that there are no other animations running alongside the sprites.  For cases when you are running other animations, tweens, or dragging and dropping stuff, while sprites are animating, you don't want to only refresh a layer when a sprite is updated.  Also, for people who are using Sprites with different frame rates, the layer redraw rate is no longer constant.\nEssentially, you have a special use case, in which the only thing driving layer redraws are sprite animations, and each of your sprites have the same frame rate.  What I need to do, is to add logic that detects this condition, and then redraws layers only when the sprites update.  The moment that another animation or tween is detected on the same layer, Kinetic would have to switch to the current model.  I'll add this to my todo list, thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. I'm not sure if I ever tested stage cloning.  I'll add this to my todo list, thanks!\n. Yikes that looks pretty awful.  I'll try and take a look tonight or tomorrow to see what's going on.\n. I am SO glad you brought this up.  Thank you!\nSo first off, I do have some perf tests in place, but they don't benchmark performance for really old versions of Kinetic (v3.6.2 is ancient).  So I haven't seen the extreme perf difference.  You are right, newer versions of Kinetic are about 2-4x slower than 3.6.2.  Believe it or not, v4.7.4 is a bit faster than 3.6.2 if it weren't for a few features.  On my system, your 3.6.2 test was running at about 36fps, and the 4.7.4 was running at 8fps.  Here's a breakdown of new features that are causing the perf issue:\n1) each layer redraw actually draws the shape on two canvases, a scene canvas and a hit canvas.  This enables nearly instantaneous event detection.  Event detection was extremely slow in versions prior to 4.0.  However, this can be disabled by setting listening = false for each shape, or at the stage level.  This brought the fps up to 14\n2) newer versions of Kinetic support grouping and node nesting, and therefore theres a bit of transformation matrix math that's needed for each redraw each time a transformation property is changed (i.e. position).  Disabling grouping gets us up to 22fps (this is not yet a feature built into KineticJS)\n3) newer versions of KineticJS support event pub/sub, which means that you can hook into attr changes.  Each time an attribute changes, a before and after event is emitted.  disabling these events gets us up to 24 fps (not yet a feature in KineticJS)\n4) setPosition() is a lot more flexible now.  you can do setPosition(x, y), setPosition([x, y]), setPosition({x: y}), and even setPosition(n) which sets both x and y.  While convenient, this incurs a per overhead.  Disabling this features saves another 2fps and gets usu up to 26fps\n5) Now for the big perf problem.  Newer versions of KineticJS support all kinds of different stroke and fill styling options which older versions of Kinetic would drool over.  This logic is handled in the _fill and _stroke methods here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Context.js#L492\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Context.js#L526\nnone of these options were available with v3.6.2.  if youw anted to swap out or change stroke and fill styles, you'd have to do so in your custom draw function.  This means that the developer would have to do a lot more work.  Disabling _fill and _stroke, and just filling the rectangle directly saves us a whopping 13fps, which gets us up to 39fps\nso, technically you can bypass stroke and fill by doing something like this:\nreturn new Kinetic.Shape({\n        drawFunc: function(context) {\n          var _context = context._context;\n          _context.beginPath();\n          _context.rect(0, 0, 10, 10);\n          _context.closePath();\n          _context.fillStyle = 'red';\n          _context.fill();\n        },\n        listening: false\n      });\nyou can access the raw context of the KineticJS context with _context.  So, if you don't want the convenience of all the styling options with 4.7.4, you can draw your stuff manually with native canvas methods\nSummary:\nyou've already avoided the fillStrokeShape(this) method in your tests, so you can gain another perf improvement by setting listening: false on the stage.  This should get you another 6fps.  This is soemthing that I've been meaning to do automatically.  When there's no events bound to an element, it should automatically not be listening.  I'll make this chagne soon\nThe transformation matrix logic is heavy.  That killed 8fps.  I might consider giving developers the option to disable node nesting and bypass the transformation matrix logic entirely.  This would be a huge effort, but might be worth it\nDisabling automatic event firing will get us another 2fps.  I may need to introduce a mode where you have to explicitly subscribe to events.  This would be a lower ROI effort so it might be awhile before I get to this one.\nFinally, the overloaded functions, and automatic conversion of different arguments with setPosition (and other methods) reduces our fps by about 2.  While convenient, maybe it's not totally necessary.  I might remove this entirely and just force people to use a certain format.\nLooks like I have a lot of work in store :P\n. uncommenting context.fillStyle just means that the html5 canvas context is doing more work because it's setting the fill style over and over (which is needed if you want colored rectangles)  This isn't a side effect of KineticJS, it's just plain old canvas.\nfor now, the easiest way to get a perf boost is to set listening=false on each shape.\nP.S. this ticket has inspired me to release v5.0.0.  I'm currently working on addressing each of the issues mentioned in our discussion.\nStay tuned\n. v5.0.0 is now more than 2x faster than v4.7.4, and is even faster than v3.6.2.\nCheck the change log for some of those changes:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. I haven't updated the performance tutorials yet, but you can get huge perf boosts by..\n- setting transformsEnabled = 'position' on the shape\n- setting hitGraphEnabled = false\n- caching where possible\n. Just so happens I'm planning on doing something very similar for v4.8.0 :)\n. +1 yep, I added the new cache() method as requested :P\n. I'll have to look into this.  Each layer has its own canvas.  after creating a layer, you could try setting the canvas with layer.getCanvas()._canvas = yourCanvas.  the \"_canvas\" property points to a native canvas element.\n. Cool!  Thank you!  I'll probably rename this to Arc, though.\n. You rock!  Thanks again for the high quality pull requests.  I've been meaning to add a ring shape but hadn't gotten to it yet.\nThank you!!\n. This is awesome!  However, this is more appropriate as a 3rd party plugin.  KineticJS is made up of:\n1) core shapes\n2) KineticJS managed plugins\n3) 3rd party plugins\nA cross hair would fit much better as a 3rd party plugin.  Would it be possible for you to create a github repo for this, and I can link to it from KineticJS?  I will be putting together a plugin gallery soon.\nThanks!\n. this is technically a bug with chrome.  The w3c spec for shadows is very wonky.  If you create a shape with both a fill and stroke, and you apply a shadow, you'll get a double shadow.  KineticJS fixes this bug in the spec by creating a temporary buffer canvas.  Google chrome, unfortunately, doesn't apply the shadow blur correctly to things drawn onto a buffer canvas.  This only occurs if your shape has both a fill and stroke.  I'll have a work around for chrome in v5.0.2\n. You can do this:\nshape.setFill('rgba(255, 100, 113, 0.5');\nYou also have access to the RGB components directly.  Here are a few examples:\nshape.setFillRGB({\n  r: 255,\n  g: 12,\n  b: 100\n});\nshape.setFillR(255);\nshape.setStrokeG(114);\nHere's the shape docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Shape.html\nIn version 5.0.0, or 5.0.1, I plan on adding support for alpha as well.\n. it's impossible to serialize a JavaScript function, as mentioned in the docs and tutorials.  You have to reset images and functions after deserializing a JSON string.\nyou can set the dragBoundFunc like this:\nnode.dragBoundFunc(...);\nDocs are here:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Node.html#dragBoundFunc\n. right, when I said 'impossible\" I really meant \"not logical\"  - you serialize data, not code.  Why not just serialize all of the JavaScript for your whole app?\nEric\n. wow!  Thank you for taking a look at these.  I'm planning on doing a 5.0.1 release in a couple of weeks, so I'll definitely include these.  I'll pull this in about a week\nThanks again!\n. Excellent work!  Thanks again so much for doing this.\n. I want to stay away from cascading because I think it will cause more problems than it solves.\nIf you take advantage of Kinetic.Collections, which is similar to jQuery, you can do:\ngroup.find('Image').each(function(node) {\n  node.width(9);\n});\nsoon, I plan to support this:\ngroup.find('Image').width(9);\nbut I haven't set that up yet.\n. Hi guys.  Believe it or not, there was alot of requests for this.  In order to lighten the KineticJS API, I wanted to support a single unit for all attrs.  This also greatly simplified lots of portions of the code base.  Most people seemed to want degrees for rotation.  I looked at a lot of people's code on stackoverflow and other places, and I saw a lot of people using rotateDeg() or rotationDeg().  It seemed natural to make the default unit in degrees to accommodate most people's use case.  \nThere have been many other threads with people unhappy with this change.  This is one of those topics where there is so much backlash that may have to go back and support both cases again :/\nI'll add this to our todo list, but it's a sucky change \n. Thanks @jfollas . And to re-iterate, I've heard loud and clear that a lot of people are upset about the radian to degree change.  But again, I think most people are frustrated by the change because it required lots of changes to their codebase, and not because it was necessarily a bad change.  I'm still keeping a close eye on this topic, don't worry.\n. @jfollas had a brilliant idea - we introduced a new config option that lets you choose which angle unit you'd like to use.  the default is degrees, but you can switch to radians if you like.  You can change to radians like this:\nKinetic.angleDeg = false;\nhere's the change: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5562f5dbbef8de248d2046131172c3c5a27cc70\n. agreed - this is something that's not fully quite worked out yet.  The idea is to have a transform option that ignores parent transforms for performance reasons.  I may need to introduce another option like:\nshape.ignoreParentTransforms();\nor something.  Stay tuned on that one.\n. update on this thread - the transformsEnabled property is now deprecated.  In v5.0.0, I was moving into a direction where devs have to configure lots of individual properties to tweak performance.  This doesn't scale.  In v5.1.0, you can now use fast layers, which render about 2x faster than normal layers.  All of the performance tweaks are done automatically.  You can create a fast layer like this:\nvar layer = new Kinetic.FastLayer();\n. v5.0.0 had several API changes.  please check the changelog, docs, and tutorials.\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. yep, check the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nKinetic promoted to a new major version because there are a lot of API changes.  Please check the tutorials for updated examples:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. that's incorrect - the docs say that the rotation should be in degrees:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Shape.html#fillPatternRotation\nThe tutorials on HCT are probably out of date though - I still need to get those updated.\nThanks!\n. This is now fixed via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5562f5dbbef8de248d2046131172c3c5a27cc70\nThanks for catching this!\n. shoot I thought this was handled.  I'll add this to the 5.0.1 release which is a patch coming out soon\nThanks!\n. 1) This is the expected behavior.  the Cache bounding box x,y is relative to the default position, which for the case of a circle, is the center point.  Take a look at the cache tutorial here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\nYou'll notice that you need to set the x,y position of the cache, along with the star offset.\n2) that's expected behavior.  the cache bounds that you set need to account for stroke width.  This can't be done automatically because of several stroke side effects such as line Join, and tensions.\n3) expected behavior\nThanks!\n. Thanks for looking into this!  I was hoping that this could be solved without adding pixel ratio logic to the Node class.  The Canvas class should contain all pixel ratio adjustments.  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.\nThanks!\n. I guys, just wanted to let you know that I've verified this is a problem.  It's a pixel ratio issue.  As a work around, before you create any stages or layers, you can set the pixel ratio to 1:\nKinetic.pixelRatio = 1;\n. This is fixed now:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/c2e138c6f4625a084c1e8d732e3f888ff968feda\nso here's the deal.  When users change the zoom level, it affects the pixel ratio, and causes artifacts on the canvas.  As of today, there does not appear to be a way to reliably detect user zoom levels with JavaScript for modern browsers.  There are a few libraries out there that are able to do it for older browsers, but not newer ones.  Therefore, for desktop browsers, I'll force the pixel ratio to 1.  For mobile experiences, the pixel ratio will be calculated and used to create crisper renderings on devices with a pixel ratio > 1.\nThis will be included with the next release.  Until then, just use Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1 as described above.\n. @nicolasloupias this is supported as of v4.7.0\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#wiki-470-sep-16-2013\nI would suggest biting the bullet and upgrading to v5.0.1 before you get too behind\n. The next release will be v5.0.2 or v5.1.0, depending if I introduce the new FastLayers or not.\n. I don't believe the zoom issue a problem for mobile.  Is that correct?\n. yikes, you're right.  I was planning on using an alternative to rgbToHex anyways.  I'll get this fixed up.\n. It's probably not optimized. Kinetic can run at nearly native speeds. Ill take a look soon. \n. Haven't forgotten about this thread - I need to put together a demo for you guys.\nBy default, KineticJS has a lot of stuff enabled that will slow down performance, like node nesting and event handling.  \"faster\" libraries probably don't handle these by default.  With Kinetic, however, you can disable these features to produce nearly native speeds.  I still need to get some more perf tutorials out there for you guys - just slammed with a million other things :P\n. First of all - awesome demo!  Do you mind if I repost this on HTML5 Canvas Tutorials?  I would just need your twitter handle, author bio, gravatar link for your image, and a link to your website if you have one.\nSecond of all - nice job, you did a pretty good job of fine turning performance.  The disableHitGraph is actually a layer property, but it doesn't matter in your case sense your using drawScene()\nAlso, on my macbook air, it was running at 30fps for 1000 bunnies.\nSomething else to watch for every soon - v5.02 will support something called a StaticLayer.  Static layers are like normal layers, except they don't handle node transforms or events.  For people who just want to draw a ton of stuff on the canvas and don't care about interactivity, StaticLayers will provide the fastest rendering performance possible.  \nI might go as far as to create a StaticStage, which has no layers either.  It would basically be the KineticJS api that draws directly onto a single canvas.\n. agreed - I'd like to keep the event support as minimal as possible, and users can use something like HammerJS if they want additional events.\n. yep this is a bug, and will be fixed with the 5.0.1 patch coming out in about a week or so. \nThanks!\n. scratch that, I forgot that it's already fixed in Github.  when 5.0.1 comes up, just upgrade and you should be good to go.  \nIf you need a quick fix, be sure to manually set your fillPatternScaleX and fillPatternScaleY values.  Otherwise they are defaulted to 0, which causes the shape to be invisible.\n. Thanks for this!  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.\n. can you please provide a jsfiddle example?\n. can you repost this on stackoverflow, with a jsfiddle?  for implementation questions, stack overflow is a much better forum than github.  Also, I noticed that you're passing arguments to the draw() method.  The draw method takes no arguments.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L1465\n. hah, there's a typo here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Shape.js#L46\nthis line listens for shadow changes, and then clears the hasShadow cache when one occurs.  It's listening for shadowEnabledChanged instead of shadowEnabledChange :P\nI'll fix this up by the next version\n. scaling with a negative value works for me.  It's working in this tutorial as well:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-scale-animation-tutorial/\ncan you post a jsfiddle?  There's probably something else wrong.\n. Thanks for reporting this!  Your solution of getter.call(this, {attrs: {}}) doesn't quite work because you're calling the getter method from the \"this\" context, but passing the \"{attrs: {}}\" object as an argument, which will be ignored (getter methods don't require arguments)\nThe fix is to remove the attr from attrs, use getter.call(this) to extract the default value from the getter method, and then restore the attr.  I added a unit test as well.\nThank you!!!\n. nice @lavrton!\nCurrently, I don't have plans to archive old documentation.  This may change if enough people demand it :P\nHopefully (keeping fingers crossed) v5.x is the last big API change to the library.  It's now very close to my vision of what KineticJS should be, so I don't suspect it will change much from here on out.\n. +1 @kzhdev \n. Thank you!\n. currently, the plan is to keep all getters and setters.  This enables you to override specific getters and setters, and the overloaded methods will keep working.  The overloaded methods, like stroke(), in turn call setStroke() and getStroke()\n. in other words, the getters and setters are the source of truth, and the overloaded methods are just convenience methods.  However, I purposely took out the explicit getters and setters from the documentation in order to cut it down in half.  The docs were getting huge, and I want the API to be as simple as possible.\n. you need to use layer.draw() to redraw layers.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-alpha-with-kineticjs/\n. I think circle.draw() used to in turn do a layer.draw for you, but I believe this was removed.\n. This was just fixed along with a new flag that lets devs choose if angles are in degrees or radians.  Thanks for catching this:\nchange: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5562f5dbbef8de248d2046131172c3c5a27cc70\n. Thanks!!\n. taking a quick look right now.\n. Can you give us more information about how your app works?  This isn't enough.\nHow many stages?  how many layers?  how many groups?  What kind of images?  How big are they?  Can they be put into a sprite image?\n. oh, the problem is when you're including your custom filter.  You currently can't just add it after you include the kineticjs file.  Filters must be defined after the Node class is defined, but before the Image class.\nThis is something that I need to fix or else other people will have the same headache.  I'll have a fix for this in the next version\n. for a work around, just use this instead:\nKinetic.Factory.addGetterSetter(Kinetic.Image, 'myFilterVal', 0, null, Kinetic.Factory.afterSetFilter);\nsince you are using an image, this will add the myFilterVal attribute directly to the Image class.\n. This should be fixed now.  please refer to this ticket for more info:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/753\n. Thanks @lavrton \nSorry for the confusion guys.  In an effort to simplify the KineticJS api, and improve performance, I removed support for Number and Array inputs.\n. Thank you guys!\n. Heya!\n1) you're right, looks like this missed\n2) it was done for performance reasons\n3) you're not the only one who dislikes the change - I'm considering changing it back\n. The performance cost of detecting the user input and converting very large arrays of points to another format is actually noticeably expensive when you're dealing thousands of data points that are updated several times per second :P\nThere are also lots of cases when you just want to change a single point inside the array of hundreds of points.  Since the input is guaranteed to be an array of integers, with no conversion, this gives people the opportunity to change a single point by reference, without resetting the entire array each time.\ni.e.\nvar points = []; // huge array of points\npolygon.setPoints(points);\npoints[9998] = 5;\npoints[9999] = 6;\npolygon._clearCache('points');\nlayer.draw();\nAlso, I wanted it to be easier to configure points, i.e.\nvar polygon = new Kinetic.Polygon({\n  points: [{\n    x: 1,\n    y: 2\n  },\n  {\n    x: 3,\n    y: 4\n  }]\n};\nvs.\nvar polygon = new Kinetic.Polygon({\n  points = [1,2,3,4];\n});\nor\nvar polygon = new Kinetic.Polygon({\n  points = [\n    // x, y\n    1,2,\n    3,4\n  ];\n});\nThis is one of those cases where I was trying to balance flexibility vs. performance.  I'm still open to changing it back, however, if more people speak up about this.  Let's give it a little more time.\n. Here's another idea - maybe this will be a win win situation.\nWhat if I provide array methods that enable you to modify the points array?  i.e.\npolygon.push(point);\npolygon.pop();\npolygon.shift();\npolygon.unshift(point);\npolygon.insert(point, position);\npolygon.remove(position);\npolygon.concat(arraOfPoints);\netc.\nThoughts?\n. you got it.\n. Common question. You need to use mouseenter and mouseleave events.  jquery does the same thing \n. +1 this is the expected behavior.  This is a typical pattern for libraries/frameworks - i.e. the framework should not modify the container element in anyway, or any other DOM elements outside of the container.  Everything inside the container, though, is fair game.  You need to move your content outside of the KineticJS container.\n. Hey @lavrton, can you explain what exactly is slow?  Are you just referring to drag and drop?  The event detection algo is actually much faster than other libraries.  It can detect shape intersections for millions of nodes on the screen.\n. Look into the hit graph and scene graphs.  When things are drawn with Kinetic, shapes are drawn on both a scene graph (what you see) and a  hit graph (used for event detection)\n. interesting, okay.  I don't believe the problem is getIntersection itself, but rather the frequency that it's called.  i.e., we can play around with throttling the getIntersection call on touchmove.  For that matter, maybe we should throttle all touchmove events, since we know they will be used with mobile devices.  Do you want to take a look at this?  Maybe we could create a throttle function and put it in Kinetic.Util (something similar to underscore's throttle, or maybe even the exact same one) and then hook it up with the touchmove fire event here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Stage.js#L539\n. no don't do that, you're essentially indirectly throttling the event detection.  If people are listening for the draggableChange event, they will get some very odd results\n. I'll take a look at throttling, and might hook it into the batchDraw function as well (which is technically doing throttling)\n. yea, I know you were doing it for testing purposes, but just wanted to make sure.\n. really cool jsfiddle demo btw!  Can I make a lab out of that (you would be the author)\n. no no, I like the comparison\n. here it is:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8fcd882ba5d2da288c846d9a76911729e7d56728\nSo I've been working on Android issues this morning, and made a lot of improvements.  I discovered that Android was listening for both touch and mouse events, which not only caused some weird issues from time to time, but also really hurt performance.  I added throttling to both mousemove and touchmove.  I think both of these should help with Android perf a lot.  Can you pull the latest changes and give it a try on your device?\n. for drag and drop, I wonder if we can avoid it entirely.  I think at one point I was, but I don't remember why I put it back in.  i.e., there's no reason to detect for events on other shapes when you're dragging and dropping.\n. Also, in your hack, you were essentially throttling down to 50ms.  My throttle is 17ms.  You could try changing 17 to 50.\n. Cool!  Thanks!\n. cool thank you!\n. +1\n. +1 Thanks @lavrton.  This is my fault, I didn't have any tutorials that covered the setAttr() method.  I'll revamp the KineticJS tutorials soon.\n. yes, odd, I'm not sure how this could be happening - each time the scene function is executed for the  Line class, it just loops through the points array and then closes the shape at the end:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Line.js#L75\nAs @ippo615  mentioned, a jsfiddle would be most helpful here.\n. Ah, I think it makes sense for opacity to affect cached shapes.  I'll fix this up.\n. can you repost this on stackoverflow?  This is an implementation question.  I would like for other people to see the answer.\n. stackoverflow.  It's linked to from the kineticjs homepage.\n. Can you try v5.0.2 or v5.1.0?  Those should be a bit better\n. ah yes.  Except, I don't like that we are tacking on the event type as a second argument.  It either needs to be added to the native event object as some other key (like eventType) or we need to split up the native event object from the Kinetic event object.  I'm favoring the latter at the moment.  Still thinking on this.\n. On second though, I think we should continue to reuse the native event object, but add a kinetic namespace to it.  I'll make that change soon\n. fixed. \n@lavrton using two arguments gets weird when you are trying to fire custom events with the fire() API.  \nKinetic will now pass around a Kinetic event object, which has a reference to the native event object, if it's needed.  i.e.\nevt = {\n  target: Kinetic.Circle,\n  type: 'tap',\n  evt: NativeEventObj\n};\n. @lavrton  can you take a look at the dispatchEvent that you added for HammerJS and let me know if it looks okay to you?\n. change: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/47ecb4559de2891c2687a42cd49eb0ce5ff209db\n. and here's a unit test that shows what the API looks like now:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ddf34d0af9b84b217e1a4d9d4e8e43b932901b00\n. agreed this is a big API change.  Luckily, we are already releasing an API change version (5.1.0) so we can sneak it in.  I'll be sure to address this clearly in the change log under the API section.\n. Thanks!  Sounds logical.\n. Thanks @lavrton !  I'll be releasing v5.1.0 within about 3 or 4 days which will patch up any regression issues with v5.0.2\n. @lavrton what do you think?\n. yep!\nJust saw that and changed it.  https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/0800f1e31ab1848920b1733daa255930b7e9941e\n. Upgrade to v5.1.0, which was released yesterday - it fixes the drag and drop perf problem on Android.  Please reopen this ticket if there's still an issue.\n. oh shoot, I meant v5.0.2.  I'll look at this.\n. oh, for mobile devices, the pixel ratio is automatically taken into account.  To disable this adjustment, you can set Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1.  Let me know if this fixes the issue.\n. I'm pretty sure this is the issue so I'm going to go ahead and close this one while I'm here.  Please reopen if this doesn't help.\n. You should place it at the top of your app, before you create any stages or layers.  It's a global KineticJS config.  I'll look into this as well to see if I'm missing something.\n. Cool!  no problemo.  Rest assured that KineticJS will continue to get faster and faster :P\nEric\n. will do, sorry about that!\n. done.\n. Can you explain a bit more?  What exactly are you wanting to do?\n. Hiya!  This isn't a bug, it's an implementation question.  Can you repost this on stackoverflow.com?  That way, others can see the answer (plus you'll get more responses)\n. Awesome!  I've been meaning to do that.  I'll probably pull these changes in this weekend.\n. great questions!  Yes, I haven't made this Github project official yet because I'm still new to Github and getting my feet wet :)\n1) I'll be making the Github project official very soon, probably within a week or so.\n2) I do already have plans to document the config object more fully (it's also already documented on html5canvastutorials.com)\n3) I use jsdoc toolkit now (as of like a few days ago) and it's been working out great.  Here's the new docs page: http://www.kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Stage.php\n4) I still haven't decided yet about the best place to report bugs.  I'm leaning towards using Github and removing the Bugs Forum\n5) haven't put thought into tagging yet\n6) absolutely.  I'm setting things up on Github because a lot of people are requesting it (so they can manage forks) and so people can help contribute and get more involved (KineticJS is growing very rapidly and it's becoming too big of a project to be managed by one person)\nCheers!\n. Antoine, I was going to message you with a request, but it appears that you don't have messaging enabled on GitHub, or maybe you don't have an email address tied to your account.  At any rate, if you're able to see this message even after the pull request is closed, I wanted to see if you could do these:\n1) modify the rake file so that all of the comments are stripped out correctly for the minified version (for some reason the GlobalObject comments are still there)\n2) is it possible to add a version number to the build command, something like \"3.8.3\" and the rake file can auto update the license.js page, perhaps with a token (i.e. @version@)\n3) is it also possible to automatically update the date in the license.js file?\nCheers\n. Awesome, that sounds great!  Thanks so much for putting this together.  Would also be cool if after we pass in a version number \"e.g. 3.8.3\", it would also rename the dist files like this:\nkinetic-v3.8.3.js\nkinetic-v3.8.3.min.js\nCheers!\n. Brilliant!  Works perfectly!\n. Great suggestion.  This is something that's been on my mind for awhile, and have been planning on adding soon.  Any special requests on how you'd like for it to be handled?  To keep things simple, I don't think I'll be supporting event capturing (only event bubbling).  I figured we could do something like this:\nshape.on(\"click\", function(e) {\n    // do stuff\n    e.stopPropagation();\n}\nDo you think this is sufficient?\n. Sounds good!  Hopefully I'll get this added in soon.\n. Hiya!  Have you tried using Groups?  Groups enables you to create complex shapes by grouping multiple regular shapes.  In essence, a group is a shape that can have multiple paths.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-a-group-with-kineticjs/\n. Yes, I investigated this technique a long time ago because on the surface it sounds like a great idea.  However, the performance is horrible.  In fact, if you start using more than like 10 images, the whole app will start to break down pretty rapidly. \n. That's a pretty good idea (storing the pixel data for an image once and reusing the array).\nI just realized that it would be awesome to add a new property to the Kinetic.Image object, \"detectionType\", which could be set to \"path\" or \"pixel\".  This way developers can choose.  Thanks for the discussion, and great demo btw!\n. Thanks for posting this!  This is a known bug that hasn't been fixed yet - it's slightly lower on the priority list at the moment, but should hopefully get put in soon.\nCheers!\n. Well in that case, I'll have the issue fixed by this weekend and bundle it with the v3.8.4 release :)\n. oh and by the way, if you need the fix even faster, you can try making a change in the _getContainerPosition() method in Stage.js.  This method is not taking into account div scroll offsets, only the window scroll offset :)\n. sweet, if you drop by the Bay area let me know and I'll take you up on that!  Btw the fix for this has been checked in :)\n. Can you post your code on a web server somewhere so I can take a look at it there? (since you're saying that the code works on jsfiddle but not your local) KineticJS should be supporting scrollable containers and scrollable parent DOMS.  Thanks!\n. ah, you're not the first person to have problems with the styling of the container node (non dispay:relative styles).  I'll look into this a bit more.\n. great!  glad you got it working\n. have you tried using the dragBounds property?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-bounds-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. right, and that was sort of my thinking.  In other words, I'm trying to keep KineticJS as light as possible so I don't want to implement everything, but I do want to implement things that have a light foot print and is commonly used (like rectangular bounds).  For more special cases, like creating circular bounds, devs could create plugins for that :)\n. Agreed.  I think drag and drop, constraints, and bounds, still need a ton of improvements :)\n. Sweet!  I've been meaning to add a mimeType to the toDataURL method.  Thanks!\n. done and done :)\n. You rock!!  Kudos on updating the unit tests too, I appreciate that :)\n. it's okay, everything's good to go\n. This issue has been addressed in the forums - no fix needed\n. yep, they sure don't :)  The stage is the only Node object that isn't tied to a layer, and currently transitions are tied to each layer for performance reasons.  Originally, I was going to add support for Stage transitions for the next release by tweaking the transition code a bit for the Stage node, but now, I've recently come up with a better way to manage animations + transitions with relation to layers, so I'll be taking that approach now instead.  The new approach will also enable stage transitions for the next release.  Stay tuned!!\n. Following up with this issue - stage transitions are now supported as of v3.9.2\n. No prob!  I'll keep this open for awhile\n. Closing this pull request - If I do end up implementing a full screen method, it will probably leverage the HTML5 full screen API\n. ah, yes Firefox appears to be failing for me.  I'll look into this thanks!!\n. oh, I'm a dope :)  The same text in Firefox and Chrome has slightly different text sizes (due to implementation), so my unit tests shouldn't test for a specific text width.  Thanks!\n. Oh and in regards to the pixel detection, you really can't use a bounding box (because parent nodes can be transformed, causing the child node to be way outside the bounding box)\nAlthough, it actually performs pretty nicely for me because I've enabled the developer to decide when to save the pixel data with the save() method (very expensive).  If you choose good times to save the data, I think the performance should be okay.  What sort of test case were you using?\nmy example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-animals-on-the-beach-game-with-kineticjs/\n. After a bit of exploration, I found that the root problem was with the getAbsolutePosition() method.  It should not have been taking into account center offset transforms.  Issue is now fixed :)\n. Perfect!  I had plans on implementing rounded corners in exactly the way that you've done (I wanted it to be a config property, not a new shape).  I'll pull this in soon.  Thanks!\n. Your work made it to v3.9.4 and I gave you credit in the change log.  Thanks again!\n. This is good stuff!  However, is it possible that you could move most of this logic to Kinetic.Line, and add a new line property called \"lineStyle\" that's defaulted to \"normal\", and devs can set it to \"dashed\" if they want a dashed line.  I'd like for KineticJS to have as few shapes as possible.\nIn the future, I also wanted to add support for lineStyle: \"dotted\" which would draw small circles instead of lines along the line path.\nCheers!\n. status update - I'm currently doing a little bit of research to see what other implementations look like, and will most likely be merging some of your work with some other ideas I've been finding as well.  I really like that you have the ability to animate the dashed line, pretty slick.\n. I ended up using a method by Phrogz which is only about 30 lines of code, and enables an unlimited amount of dashed and dotted lines with varying dash lengths and spacings for each alternate.  This will provide quite a bit of flexibility. \nThanks so much for digging into this with me!\n. Nicely done!!!  I was planning on working on Node.js support at some point.  As soon as I get a chance, I'll look over the changes and pull in it.\nThanks again!\n. added these changes to the nodejs branch.  I'll spend a little time later doing further testing and taking a closer look.  Very exciting stuff!!\n. Hiya!  It hasn't really been supported, as of yet.  If I understand correctly, there's not too much effort that has to go in to get it working.  I've had plans to add support, along with a suite of unit tests, but other priorities have been bubbling on top of it.  Hopefully I'll have this addressed soon (possibly with the next release or so)\n. sorry for the headache guys.  Really hoping to officially add node.js support soon.\n. absolutely possible, just a matter of time :)\n. Yea, I've taken a couple weeks off from KineticJS dev.  I have a whole slew of things that I'll be working on during xmas break :P\n. well, turns out that the native max width w3c spec really sucks.  I don't like that the text scales rather than being cut off (similar to html text inside of a div element with a max width).  Also, the changes didn't incorporate the bounding box dimensions.\nso, I ended up reworking the logic to use clipping rather than the native text scaling.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/05df07829533fa1de3b6a6e23da05845586c1a2f\nThanks for getting these changes rolling!\nCheers\n. Thanks for this!  After a bit more thought, I've decided that the API should look like this:\ncornerRadius:5 -> causes all 4 corners to have radius of 5\ncornerRadius: [1,2,3,4] -> causes top left corner radius to be 1, top right to be 2, etc.  \nI'll put together a mashup of some of your work plus this API.  \nThanks again!\n. still not fully following your use case.  Could you expand on it a bit?\nCheers!\n. Follow up:\nI've replaced the Circle Shape with Ellipse, which enables you to define a radius like this for circles:\nradius: 10\nand a radius like this for ovals:\nradius: {\n   x: 10,\n   y: 5\n}\nIt's much cleaner to transform the context than to connect several bezier curves.  Check out the Ellipse shape in the source to see how it looks\nCheers!\n. hi thanks for looking into this!  It turns out that I'm in the process of exposing attr change events internally and externally, which means that KineticJS is becoming more event driven.  I've added a widthChange and heightChange listener to the stage that listens for dimension changes, and when they occur, the DOM dimensions are synced.  This enables us keep a lot of node specific logic out of the setAttrs method and greatly decouples the code base\nCheers!\n. updated on this issue - I've added an on size change listener that updates the DOM dimensions whenever the stage dimensions change, so this issue should be resolved :)\nCheers!\n. very nice changes!  As soon as I get a chance, I'll look into pulling these in and check out the code a bit more closely.  Great work!\n. Thanks for this!  You've done some great work.  Unfortunately though, I've already begun a total Kinetic.Text rewrite.  Now that (I think) I fully understand what most people need from the Text shape, I decided to do a full rewrite of the shape to make it very clean and elegant.  Word wrap will be added very soon.  \nCheers!\n. Hiya!  This problem should be resolved with the latest version of KineticJS.  I went though and cleaned up undefined, null, 0, and empty string usage.  If you now set any attr to undefined, nothing will happen.  If you set an attr to null, 0, or empty string, the attr will be disregarded.\ne.g. if you set image to null, it won't be drawn.\n. Hi again, this issue has been resolved with v3.10.2\nif you set any attr to null, 0, or '', the attr will be ignored.  If you set an attr to undefined, nothing will happen.\nCheers!\n. I'll take a look at this one as soon as I get a chance!\nCheers!\nEric\n. adding this to the next release.  Thanks!\n. There still seems to be some issues with remove() in general, so I'm going to do a full blown reinvestigation of it.  Sorry for this!  All of the issues should be resolved by the next version, 4.3.1.  I think that I get more bug reports related to remove() than anything else, so it's clearly not designed well.  Thanks for being patient! \n. very likely.  I also have a todo item for the next release that involves creating some memory performance tests around remove().  Hopefully we'lll get it cleaned up and working seamlessly soon\n. wait, did you mean layer.remove() doesn't work?  the remove method does not take in an argument:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#remove\nI looked very closely at my layer.remove() tests, and they are passing correctly\n. hiya!  Are you referring to animations specifically?  The event stress tests seem to performing well still.  I'll look into this asap!\n. Here's some eventing stress tests which still seem to perform well:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-10000-shape-stress-test-with-kineticjs/\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-drag-and-drop-stress-test-with-1000-shapes/\n. sweet!  Glad to hear.\nP.S. The current build has +7% drawing performance, and I have a lot of other peformance improvements lined up for the next few releases.  i.e. KineticJS should keep getting faster and faster :)\n. Thanks!  this change looks really good.  As soon as I get the chance I'll pull it in and create some unit tests for it\n. ah good one.  Thanks for letting me know!  I'll get this one fixed up asap.\nCheers!\n. Just tested this use case, and the problem seems to have been resolved.  Please let me know if you're still experiencing this problem!\n. Hiya!  Thanks for this.  I've actually already begun re-writing the Text shape, including a new API for alignment.  align and verticalAlign now refer to the text's alignment relative to its containing text box (which makes a heck of a lot more sense).  Rounded corners are also now available since the Text shape is now a Group which utilizes the Rect shape for the text box.  Word wrap will be coming soon as well.\n. Hiya!  This is technically a bug because the attribute is present in the code, but is not used yet.  It will be working by v4.3.3\n. Awesome point!  That does really suck.  I'll add this to my todo list.\nCheers!\nEric\n. fixed in v3.10.2!  Thanks again for pointing that out\nCheers!\nEric\n. Hiya!  Yea, I noticed that before - my formatter for some reason screws up that line.  I tried multiple variations without success.  Went ahead and changed the else if to an else, and inside the else block used an if block.  Very strange!\n. Great point.  I'll look into a better solution asap\nCheers!\n. Fixed!  At first glance, I thought that John's inheritance implementation was too complex for what I needed, but after trying to implement it myself I realized that it was spot on.  I added his Class function to Class.js in the util folder and am now extending all parent nodes with it.  Works like a charm!\nCheers!\n. great idea.  I'll add this the todo list\n. following up with this thread - Kinetic.Text added support for the \\n character to force word wrap.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-text-tutorial/\n. Great point!  Assuming that Shapes are typically the node whose visibility is toggled on and off (in contrary to to groups, layers, or stage), this would certainly be nice performance improvement.  Just pushed to change and gave you props.\nThanks!\n. cool work!  I like where you're going with this, but isn't the concept of your Style class the same thing as just storing styles as an object like this:\nvar myStyle = {\n    fill: 'blue',\n    stroke: 'red'\n}\nand then applying that style to any node via setAttrs\ncircle.setAttrs(myStyle);\nI've been meaning to create a clone method, and what you have is pretty close to what I had imagined as well, with the exception that the clone method might also need to clone event handlers and other non attr properties.  I'll take a closer look at this when I get a chance\nThanks for looking into this!\nEric\n. Thanks for getting the ball rolling!  There's quite a few things that still needed to change, so I went ahead and created my version of the clone method here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/a8ab9a253348f9628e60727bf67f0839aeb58253\nI'll mention you in the change log for getting this rolling\nHere are a few things that needed to change with your implementation:\n- we don't want to copy over all of the object properties (such as _id, because this is a unique node identifier)\n- we also don't want to directly copy over the eventListeners property because some of the listeners are generated from class constructors, and we don't want to override these handlers with the original objects handlers\n- I wanted to make sure that the constructor is called for proper object initialization using the 'new' keyword\n- we don't need to manually do a deep copy to copy over the attrs because each class initializer uses the setAttrs method to set the attrs, which automatically does a deep copy\nThanks again!\nCheers\n. Hiya!  Actually KineticJS works very similarly to that.  Check out this tutorial\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-remove-event-listener-by-name-with-kineticjs/\n. right, that makes sense.  I think that's a reasonable request :)  I'll add it to my todo list\nCheers!\n. Hey sorry, this is still in my todo list but it's been lower in priority than other tasks. It'll get in there I promise. In the meantime, would you be interested in making th change for us, and submitting a pull request?\n. fixed as of v4.0.3 courtesy of Davonium.  Thanks!\n. hi there!  All shape radii should be centered on the shape's perimeter, such that the shape radius should be equal to or larger than the inner stroke radius.  Is this what you're referring to?  If not, maybe you could create a jsfiddle showing the behavior, or provide a screenshot.\nCheers!\n. Ellipse strokes seem to be working fine in FF now http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-ellipse-tutorial/\n. Hiya!  Thanks for looking into this.  At the time being, I don't really want to support automatic image loading, because different apps may need to load images in different ways depending on what's needed, and I don't want to go down the route of supporting all kinds of different image loading strategies (e.g. load all images, then draw the whole stage at once, draw each image as soon as it's available and manage layering and redrawing, combinations of the two, etc.)\nI've found that it's much more straight forward to let the developer manage image loading and drawing themselves.  Plus, I'm trying to keep KineticJS as light weight as possible, and since image loading really has nothing to do with canvas (there are hundreds of other image loading libraries out there), I feel like adding the logic would add extra bloat.\nI'll keep an open mind though - may need to revisit this and incorporate image loading at a later time\nCheers!\n. hey Jason, I pulled in the new TextShape (awesome by the way), and moved the non-primitive shapes to the plugins folder.  Was wondering if you could possibly make a few changes to the Path and TextPath shape, if you get the chance.  If not, I can take a look sometime next week:\n1) I would like for Shape drawFunc functions to not be overridden by children classes (the TextPath class extends Path, but then overrides its drawing function).  In other words, if something were to extend a particular shape, it shouldn't override anything in its initializer, it should only add or modify methods.\nThat being said, maybe it's more appropriate if the TextPath shape directly extends Shape like all of the other shapes, but simply inherits some of the Path methods\n2) I noticed that you made the Path shape much heavier in preparation for TextPath support.  I would like for the Path shape to be as lean as possible, and not assume that another class will be using it for something.  Is it possible for all of the extra logic you added to reside in the TextPath shape somehow?  It feels like the Path class suddenly became very bloated, and I was actually hoping to spend some time later on improving on its performance\n3) is it possible you could also use jslint or jshint on the shapes so that the JS code style is similar to the other plugins? (What you and I are building here are the officially supported KineticJS plugins)\nWhat do you think?\n. awesome. keep rockin :)\n. Whoops, you're right, we should add them to Kinetic.Plugins\n. wow guys that's a lot of +1's!  I'll take this a bit more seriously and revisit\n. finally getting around to looking into this again :)\nthanks for the patience\n. Thanks for getting this rolling!  I ended up using a more generic technique for supporting AMD + node.js with one shim from this:\nhttps://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExports.js\nand here's the AMD support commit + special test:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ab19b442a00a3261c68c71683eb5b80a0558a5b3\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/266026c76f5d16788c0fe48303c81332071b2a72\nPlease let me know if this looks good to you, or if any further changes need to be made.  Thanks!\n. Hiya!  Thanks for the detailed response.\nYes, I've been thinking about how to handle the global access for users who\ndon't use AMD (which I'm assuming is most users), and I realized that I can\njust define Kinetic in the global namespace only if AMD or node are not\nbeing used.  I'll make this change soon.\nCheers!\nEric\nOn Mon, Dec 3, 2012 at 10:44 PM, michaelgilley notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nHey Eric, thank you for supporting this. There are a few issues though.\nThese are non-critical but still yet they should be addressed. If you'd\nlike me to add these as new issues just let me know.\nFirst, the Kinetic should be hidden from the global namespace. It looks\nlike in Global.js line 31 Kinetic is left outside of the wrapper. Part of\nthe power of AMD (requirejs) is to contain libraries/modules within the AMD\nwrapper and be used through direct require instead of reference to the root\nnamespace. This is why the UMD spec you included defaults to assigning\nKinetic to the root (window) namespace IF define and exports are undefined.\nIf define is a function then Kinetic should not be accessible via the\nwindow object, only through requiring the module.\nIf you'd like to keep Kinetic in the global namespace independent of\nwhether define exists or not that's fine. Plenty of libraries/frameworks do\nthis (e.g., jQuery, Underscore, etc.) You can see an UMD example of this at\nhttps://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExportsGlobal.js. However,\nit would be best practice to also provide a noConflict method to the\nlibrary for developers who would prefer to remove its footprint from the\nglobal namespace and thus save from any potential library naming conflicts.\nSecond, now when loading Kinetic without AMD it stores a reverence to the\nlibrary under window.returnExports (Global.js line 110). This needs to be\nchanged to root.Kinetic. The UMD spec did not intend for returnExports to\nactually be used. Again, this is why var Kinetic should be contained\nwithin the factory function scope referenced in Global.js line 112. It's\nintended to be made global on this line if exports and define prove\nundefined.\nThird, as is Kinetic is stored under root and so makes irrelevant the\nwrapper functions on each Kinetic module. I assume you added these for the\ncustom build feature you offer on your site? If they are treated as\nindividual modules this is where you can truly leverage the power of AMD by\nusing a define function with each of those modules and requiring their\ndependencies respectively.\nThanks for all the work!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/47#issuecomment-10986235.\n. Just so I don't forget, could you open up a bug and copy and paste your comment?  This way, when I make changes, you'll now where to find them\n. P.S. I absolutely don't want to include the require.js library within KineticJS because its 12K (in order to leverage it for dependency management), so I definitely won't be using it internally.\n. This is a great change!  Thanks so much for fixing this, and for adding a nicely constructed unit test.\n\nCheers!\n. Have you tried the demo in it's own window? (click open in new window).  Sometimes the Flash ads can temporarily slow down page.\nWhat browser are you using?\n. ah yes.  Unfortunately, I've been battling with Chrome to get some performance issues fixed that were introduced a few months ago (via bug reports), but they are still having some issues.  In fact, I introduced the layer throttling logic specifically to fix Chrome's issue (or at least greatly improve it).  Even with the throttling in place, I've noticed that in some situations, the cursor can lag behind a shape when dragging and dropping in Chrome.  I may need to dig into it a bit deeper to see if there's something else can be done. (P.S. I bet if you try the demo in Firefox, Safari, and believe it or not IE9, you won't see the lagging).\n. tell me about it.  it's a real downer\nthe layer throttling logic is KineticJS specific logic that's applied to non animation situations, such as drag and drop.\n. One of their releases killed canvas performance, so if you try to draw something simple say 200 times per second, it starts to lag behind (this can occur with drag and drop because shapes are redrawn each time the mousemove event is fired).  To remedy the problem, I added layer throttling which reduces layer draws if they start exceeding a certain threshold.  This is why sometimes you may start to see lagging every now and then when using Chrome, in which case the throttling kicks in and the layer draws are dynamically reduced.\n. Has anyone else tried the KineticJS demos lately with v4?  v4 made tremendous performance improvements since v3\n. Thank you so much for looking into this!  And sorry I wasn't able to address this sooner, there's been a million things going on with KineticJS since this pull request.  Since the Animation logic has changed so drastically, I'll take another look at this soon and make sure that the race condition has been resolved.  thanks again!!\n. Hiya!  I actually have plans to add chaining in lots of different places, but it's been lower on my priority list at the moment.  stay tuned!\n. Nice!!  Thanks so much for this\n. remember, that since custom shapes have no point of reference, their position is relative to the top left corner of the canvas context.  To define its center, you need to draw the custom shape around the top left corner of the canvas context\n. fixed!  Thanks for catching this\n. Thanks!  I missed that one\n. ah, microsoft!  Why are they implementing non w3c standard events?  I almost don't want to add support for them just because they aren't standard.  Will have to put some thought into this :)\n. haha true.  Well it's on my todo list, so hopefully I'll add it in soon.  It probably won't be too much effort\nCheers!\n. great idea, I'll put some thought into this.\n. as a side note, don't forget that you can scale the entire stage.  In other words, I think it's fairly common for people to create fixed size stages, and then set the canvas width and height via setWidth() and setHeight(), and then scale the context via setScale() so that the stage filles up the screen.  This would be more predictable, and have better performance, then trying to calculate the relative heights, widths, offsets, nested translations, etc., for every shape on the stage\n. I've had several people bring this up, so maybe it would make more sense for me to create a tutorial on how to do this :)\n. somethings wonky with this pull request - it's showing that every line in Path was modified.  I'll commit the change.  Thanks!\n. So very very sorry - I haven't forgotten about this pull request, just put it on the back burner because filters were lower priority a couple months ago.  Will look at this soon!\n. Oh yea, I was planning on eventually having a dozen or so Filters.  Just haven't gotten around to getting them put together.  I also need to add support for passing parameters in, so there's a bit of work left to do.\n. Thanks for getting this started!  Since the Filter API changed a bit, I went ahead and reimplemented it from scratch.  Will still give you credit in the change log for getting this going.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/b76cc09742b6d7ea81596b810f1277d2cbe34be3\nThanks!!\n. Actually this is up to the developer.  Filters are used to modify the current image.  If a developer wants to store images before and after, they can save it as a variable.\n. would you mind trying out v4.0.0?  The filter logic was rewritten so the problem may be resolved.\nJust let me know!\nCheers\n. coming soon :)\n. nice catch!  I hadn't thought of that scenario\n. I like where you're going with this, but there are a couple of big changes that I'd like to make:\n1) I want to create a reusable rounded corner path method in the Rect shape that Image can leverage when doing the clipping.\n2) I want the rounded corners to be specified as an array rather than an object, like [12, 0, 10, 15], or [12, 10], or 12 for  all corners to be rounded with a 12px radius.\n. not yet, this is bit of a lower priority than other items.\n. I'll be adding all of the corner radius enhancements in the next release, v4.4.4.  Hopefully, I'll be able to find a clean, consistent solution to handle corner radius for rect, image, and Label, without adding overhead.  Thanks again for working on this with me!\n. This is super interesting!!!!  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance\n. nice work!  This is working exactly as I had hoped.  merging soon :)\n. heya, I believe that this issue was fixed with this commit:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8883e80bfe88cbe2c92c1de027eb4fd166294e6b\n. could you post a jsfiddle demo showing the behavior?  I need to see some code :)\n. Coming soon! :)\n. thanks for this!  I'll add this to my todo list\nCheers\n. Haven't forgotten about this thread - I'll try to get this fixed up for the next release.  Thanks!\n. After looking into this, I won't fix this after all.  add() and remove() do much more than just add and remove a node from a parent node.  add() updates the global id counter, updates the temp node array, updates the id and name hashes, and updates the pull nodes array.  This logic is intended purely for new nodes added to the stage.  remove() does similar things.  It's purpose it to completely remove a node from the stage.  Therefore, these methods should not be used to move a node from one container into another one.\nWhat exactly are you trying to do?\n. yep, KineticJS is event driven, which mean you have access to all attr changes.  e.g.\nshape.on('xChange yChange scaleChange rotationChange', function() {\n  // do something\n});\n. Isn't this the correct behavior?\nIf you click in the area that intersects the blue circle and the red circle, only the blue circle's event handler and the blue circle's layer's handler should be executed because the blue circle is on top of the red circle.  Node nesting in KineticJS was modeled after DOM nodes.  if you click on a div that's on top of another div, only the top div event handlers will be executed.\nThoughts?\n. thanks for this!  I'll take a look asap.\nAbout the Forums - I have quite a bit of threads to catch up on.  It's not dead, I'm just really behind :)\nAlso, planning on removing the bug forum and utilizing Github for bug tickets.\nCheers!\n. This issue was fixed awhile back, closing this ticket.  If it's still an issue, please reopen :)\n. interesting use case.  I'll add this to my todo list\n. Hiya.  In an effort to make the sprite sheets more flexible, I didn't want to assume that each sprite image would be the same size (the sprite tutorial on html5canvastutorials.com is a good example)  Also, some people implement sprite sheets radially, like for sprites that walk up, right, down, left, and diagonally.  I didn't want to force people to change their sprite sheets to use Kinetic.\n. This was done intentionally.  You're assuming that all sprite sheets are put together in the same way, which is incorrect.  \nI actually expect developers, currently, to write something similar to what you have done to handle the sprite sheets in whatever format that they have them.\n. no worries!  I've been thinking about possibly creating plugins like this for Sprite, but haven't gotten around to it yet :)\n. Update on this thread: based on Davonium's concept, I created a drawBufferFunc which enables devs to create custom hit detection functions.  Here's an example functional test:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/tests/js/functionalTests.js#L862\n. pls see comment with Layer.js pull request\n. what might make more sense is for a node to have a toJSON method and load() method (this will take care of the stage, layers, groups, and shapes).  I'll look into this as soon as I can.  Thanks for putting thought into this!!!!\nEric\n. fixed :)\n. np :)\nv4.0.0 had huge architectural changes, and unfortunately a few nasty bugs like this one snuck past my unit tests.  v4.0.1 is shaping up to be super solid\n. fixed as of v4.0.2\n. you read my mind.  I don't particularly like how multiple stages are currently handled either, and haven't put too much thought into it since as of yet it's been lower on my priority list.  Now that Kinetic is looking pretty solid, I'd like to relook into this.\nWhat if you could manage your stages like this:\nKinetic.remove(stage);\n. added it to the top of my todo list here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Todo-List\nCheers!\n. This should be working as of v4.3.1 via the destroy() method which should work with stages\nstage.destroy();\nIf you still run into issues, please reopen this ticket :)\n. have you tried moving the image to its own layer when dragging and dropping?  This greatly improves performance.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-drag-and-drop-stress-test-with-1000-shapes/\n. but to your point, I'll look into the FF issue as soon as I get a chance.\n. v4.0.5 is already looking pretty heavy, so this issue will probably be addressed with a later version (mostly because it seems to be a FF bug)\n. Although there have been a lot of performance improvements made with drag and drop, this issue is ultimately dependent on the FF Canvas API implementation.  Dragging and dropping a shape filled with a pattern actually performed pretty well for me in FF.\n. Currently I have no plans to support IE8 - this would involve creating an SVG renderer.  If KineticJS becomes popular enough, and there's a huge demand for older browser support, may be forced to support SVG in the future.  Hopefully though, we won't have to do that :)\n. Sorry for the late response!  Seriously.\nI think the correct fix for this is to combine the touchPos and mousePos attributes into a single one, pointerPos.  I'll do that today.\n. That should fix it up.  Let me know if this doesn't solve your problem - assuming that you're still working with KineticJS a year later ;)\n. I'm afraid that enabling devs to specify image sources in addition to image objects will end up causing more confusion - If people are getting confused about the async nature of loading images (this is like JavaScript 101), then they will probably also not understand why images are being drawn out of order when using src. \nfor example, if someone draws a square, an image, and then a triangle, they will end up seeing a square, triangle, and then image.  I'm pretty sure that this would be more confusing.\nI don't think the library should decide for the developer when an image should be rendered.  The developer should control that.\nThoughts?\n. Agreed, if anything, we could add a loader utility in the Utilities directory.  I had considered doing that before, but wanted to keep the library as light weight as possible so I didn't add it in.  But, now that I have plans to create a configurator which will custom builds which just includes the modules that are needed, it may make sense to go ahead and provide the loader, and devs can use it if they want\n. Definitely agree that we need a way to specify which canvas to draw onto for performance reasons - willl look closer at this one soon\n. Haven't forgotten about this thread, and still realize it's very important :)\nHopefully I'll be able to put more thought into this and have a solution by v4.0.5\n. Shoot, I just realized that this is technically already supported.  Just set the listening property to false like this:\nrect.setListening(false);\nNode's that aren't listening to events are not drawn onto the buffer canvas.  Is this an acceptable solution?  \nIn regards to drag and drop - you're right, I could auto stop listening for events while dragging, and then reable listening when drag ends.\n. btw I haven't forgotten about this pull request.  I'm currently rewriting the setAttrs logic in Node to improve the OO design there as.  Once that's set up and working, I plan on making similar changes to the ones that you've suggested here.\nCheers,\nEric\n. Thanks again Davonium, I think overtime most of your suggestions have been accounted for.  Improving the OO design also really helped modularization when it came to supporting the configurator:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/configurator.php\nClosing this pull request - if you find more OO improvements, would you mind submitting a new request?  Thanks!\n. nice work.  I like how the children logic resides in the container rather than inside the clone() method in Node.  very clean\n. heya!  Yea I know that it works, but the thing is, I was planning on setting something up that would work for all methods, not just a select few.  e.g.\nshapes.setX(5);\nnodes.transitionTo(...);\netc.  I'll keep thinking on this\n. Heya!  This is what I was sort of looking for:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8d6103d1e052196ae8958f4fe91c1116a1555e39\nI wanted the extended Array to be a class so that the methods are space efficient, and I wanted all of the node methods to be attached to the prototype.  I'll still give you props in the change log for getting the ball rolling.\nCheers!\n. can you be more specific?  I'm going to guess that you were referring to mousemove specifically.  There have been huge performance improvements in the past 4 months, so I would recommend downloading the most current version of KineticJS and trying again.  If you still have issues, please reopen this ticket :)\n. I think that this issue has been resolved with some of the work I did related to layer hide/show.  Could you verify for me if the problem is fixed, or if it's still an issue?\nThanks!\n. yep you're right, it's still an issue\n. Thanks Adam!  I made a small change to your logic, but will stil give you credit in the change log.  \nThanks again!\n. @Davonium ah yes, must have missed that note.  You brought up a good point, and it was something I had thought about but forgot to act on :)\nIt might be cleaner to hide and show the buffer canvas as well\n. also, why are we needing to hide the actual canvas element via display: none?  KineticJS automatically clears the canvas in preparation for the next drawing.  I can't think of a reason why we would also have to remove the canvas element from the document flow with display:none\n. I see where you're going.  Another issue though is that it breaks the pattern of show hide for other node types.  For example, to hide a shape, you would do:\nshape.hide();\nlayer.draw();\nbut to hide a layer, you would just do\nlayer.hide();\nbut, I do really like the idea of having a super high performance mechanism for hiding an entire layer, could be really useful.  I'll take a second look at this later tonight and will probably merge in your changes, thanks!\n. Thanks again for suggesting this change!  I ended up moving the layer specific logic to the Layer class to decouple the Layer and Node modules.  Here's the change:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/d0a1b2870e9975aa226dc78b6938450c0d067bf2\nStill gave you credit in the change log.  Keep on rockin!\n. not quite what I had in mind.  I'll double check that the getIntersections method is performing well - not sure how it would be slow just for the mousewheel event.  Thanks!\n. will do! Thanks\n. fixed, thanks!\n. I'll put together a tutorial that shows how to extend KineticJS objects and make sure that it's working as expected.  stay tuned!\n. +1 that's absolutely correct\n. Excellent!  I had intended on making those exact changes once I was sure that this was the approach I wanted to take (using apply())\nThanks for enhancing the each method as well\nCheers\n. What is your Twitter handle btw?  I need to be giving you some major props\n. agh, wish I had fixed this earlier.  I'm adding it to the v4.3.4 release right now.\n. fixed!  Thanks for reporting.  The change will be in the 4.4.0 release this weekend.\n. Ah, I see what you mean.  I actually misunderstood my own code!  After taking a second look at get(), I realized that it was in dire need of refactoring (the code paths were pretty odd).  Just checked in that change.  Now it contains specific code blocks for node type selectors, id selectors, and name selectors.\n. thanks for rocking all these fixes David!  I'm working on some new cool KineticJS t-shirt designs -I need to send one to you and Jason soon :)\n. This pull request is a bit tricky because there's a lot of stuff that's already been added in terms of OO design improvements.  I do like the changes made to get(), and also glad to see the new ability to select by node type.  May end up cherry picking some of the changes. \n. hiya!  This is on my todo list here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Todo-List\nWill be fixed with the next release :)\nCheers,\nEric\n. fixed!  https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/3f8801a4941ea8344845e5b1b6402eb2e3faab38\n. @BlackScorp Thanks for the help!\n. @0xE1 actually it's the same thing.  To hook into before/after redraw for shapes, just do this:\nshape.getLayer().beforeDraw(...);\nin order to redraw a shape, it's entire layer has to be redrawn (this is why KineticJS enables you to create user defined layers so that you can group shapes intelligently)\n. This issue should be fixed because KineticJS now automatically moves shapes to a temporary top layer when dragging.  Try downloading the latest version and see if you're still having this issue.  If you are, please reopen this ticket :)\n. all points attrs now can be set with an array of integers, an array of arrays which contain two elements each, or an array of point objects:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Polygon.php#getPoints\n. Interesting stuff.  We can leave this issue open so that I can come back to it later\n. Following up with this thread - This is no longer an issue because remove() now removes a Node from the node tree without destroying it as of v4.3.1:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nto destroy a node, you now use destroy();\n. Thank you so much for this!  You rock.  Nice job on the thorough unit tests.\n. whoops you're right, thanks\n. Heya, KineticJS supports Animation key frames and 16 different kinds of Transitions right out of the box.\ntransitions: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-linear-transition-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\nanimation: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-animate-position-tutorial/\n. drag and drop bounds has been rewritten as of v4.0.2:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nWhen in doubt, also don't forget to checkout the Docs here:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.php\nand the tutorials.  Here is the tutorial you're looking for:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-bounds-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. KineticJS is still evolving fairly rapidly so always check the change log when upgrading :)\n. Hi there!  KineticJS and GreenSock have recently partnered up, meaning that all of the transition issues should be resolved.  Check out the tutorials again for an update on the API.\nThanks!\n. don't do that!  I may need to hardcode styles inside the canvas tags so that people's canvas styles don't interfere with the stage DOM.\nThis problem isn't unique to KineticJS, but any widget from any library.  If users override widget CSS styling, the widget UI may be compromised. \n. On second thought, I'll go ahead and hardcode positional styles (e.g. margins, padding, display, position, etc) and hook those changes into this issue.\nThanks!\n. so new canvases will now be have inline position, width, height, margin, border, padding, and background defaults.  Anything other styles we should worry about?\n. fixed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ca0d3790b287f3dec2a76fd3a3c948d37a12bf3f\n. sorry, the framework has been evolving rapidly since it began :)\nFortunately, KineticJS is now reaching a mature state, so I don't foresee any new radical API changes.  And at least, if there are, there's a higher chance now that I will add backwards compatibility. \n. Still need to add support for this - I would like for us to be able to pass in an array of integers as well.  Stay tuned.\n. touching base - this is still on my todo list :)\n. Kinetic Transitions have been deprecated in favor of Tweens.  Tweens now also support points transitions.\n. Interesting thread!  Thoughts:\n1) okay, the buffer canvas.  Every shape is assigned a unique color code for the purpose of really fast hit detection.  When shapes are antialiased around the edges of a shape, the alpha component of the RGBA color is not equal to 1, and therefore is ignored by the hit detection algorithm.  I don't personally see this as a bug, because this case only occurs within a fraction of a pixel around the edges of a shape.\n2) canvas border used in Html5CanvasTutorials.com - very interesting!  This whole time, I had no idea that border sizes were offsetting the hit detection.  Will definitely look into this.\n. This isn't really an issue any more - The Kinetic.Text hit graph now renders a rectangle in place of the text to make the hit detection easier.  Also, the Kinetic tutorials have removed the one pixel border so there shouldn't be an issue there anymore.\nAlso, since KineticJS is building the canvas elements dynamically, we shouldn't be modifying the styles of those elements.\n. Hiya!  Will review this as soon as I get a chance.  Thanks for the pull request!\n. Thanks for getting this started!  I ended up adding all transformation attrs to the pattern fill object:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/01c5f4f7ca4e4ca03f497f7908b07e11885bb86e\n. interesting, I'll look into this one.  Thanks for reporting!\n. yes, if you have a need to stop event propagation after the Kinetic container element (the one that you pass into the stage) then you need to bind a listener to your container that uses \nevent.cancelBubble = true\nor you could use the jQuery stopPropagation method as well.\n. hiya!  I've seen that behavior too, and unfortunately that's a side effect of using the requestAnimationFrame that's build into the browser.  The browser uses a dynamic frame rate, and sometimes I've noticed that animations can be glitchy because of this.  I'm currently investing a custom request animation frame solution that may remedy this problem.  Stay tuned!\n. The issue is related to the iOS requestAnimationFrame implementation. Still investigating :)\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Oct 30, 2012, at 10:55 AM, Chris Jennison notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs there any update on the bug fix, Eric?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I did identify and fix a major issue with transitions that greatly improves performance for multiple transitions, but I'm still looking into improving it even more, possibly with a custom implementation of requestAnimationFrame.  maybe you could help me take a look :)\n. KineticJS currently uses the requestAnimFrame shim.  Fixed framerates will crash mobile devices.\n. Heya - I made several big animation and transition performance improvements with v4.0.5.  Could you give it a whirl and see if this resolves the problem?\n\nCheers,\nEric\n. There's been a ton more perf enhancements since v4.0.x (we are now on v.4.5.0), plus KineticJS is using the GreenSock TweenLite library which is very fast as well.  Closing this ticket for now.\n. interesting, you're right this looks like a bug.  After looking through the clone unit tests, I noticed that the tests are instantiating objects that use a shadow object, which has an offset property, so my guess is that if you include an empty shadow object like this:\nvar rect = new Rect({shadow:{}});\nthat this may provide a work around for now.  I'll have this fixed in the next release, v4.0.5\nThanks!!!\n. I don't think I have unit tests that clone sprites - ill look into that. Thanks!!\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Oct 30, 2012, at 9:50 AM, Wazabii notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi again.. Not sure if this is a bug or not. Since I stick with kinetic 4.0.1, I've been trying to clone a sprite object as well. But the result: cloned object seems to be a shape rather than a sprite. Is it suppose to be like that?\nThanks\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. sorry for the pain guys!  Yes, it will be fixed by v4.0.5\n. I created a jsfiddle that creates a rectangle and clones it without any issues (not using shadows or offsets).  Check it out:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/hz77b/\nAm I missing something?  If so, could you modify the jsfiddle to break the clone method?\n. P.S. you're right about Sprite shapes (unrelated to the first bug you mentioned), the Sprites class wasn't defining the shapeType which meant that the clone method couldn't figure out that it was a Sprite.  this issue will be fixed and added to the upcoming release - thanks!!\n. @macl this sounds like the expected behavior.  The whole point of Shape classes was to provide draw functions for you.  Doesn't seem to make sense to overwrite them.  If there are particular methods in a Shape class that you'd like to reuse, you could create a new class and reference those methods.  A good example is the TextPath shape which references methods from Text and Path.\n. follow up with this thread - Sprite cloning has been fixed as of v4.0.5\n. okay guys, there's a lot going on with this ticket, and since a lot of these issues have been resolved, I'm closing this one for now.  If you're still having problems with clone(), please open up a new ticket so it that can be tracked, and also provide a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem.  I've been unable to reproduce the error mentioned in the first comment, or a black transparent image.  I provided a jsfiddle in one of my earlier comments that demonstrates cloning a node without a shadow or offset.\nThanks!\n. @macl sure, but the drawFunc attr for Shapes was never intended to be editable (if this were Java, it would have been a private attribute)\nFunny thing is, the Rect shape actually doesn't even have any methods that you could reuse:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Rect.js\nIt really would make more sense to create a custom shape for what you're doing.  Also, if you want to make a hole inside of something, you should look into leveraging the winding rule, rather than xor.\n. I'll probably go ahead and add logic to each Shape class to make sure it doesn't overwrite a user defined drawFunc though, because several other people have had similar problems.\nCheers!\n. use 'dragend'.  Here's a list of the supported events:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\n. np!  no, the drag end event is fired immediately after a redraw:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/DragAndDrop.js#L51\nso if you want to do something and then draw the layer again on drag end, you'll have to use draw();\n. Yes, this is an issue with older versions of android:\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/114-canvasclearrect-bug-in-android-stock-browser/\nthe simplest work around is to create your stage and layer, and then add the layer to the stage after a timeout (50ms worked for me)\n. This is the correct behavior since a dbl click is defined by two clicks... You just need to add logic in your event handlers to do whatever is is you're trying to do.  For example, you could add a timer in your click handler that waits 300ms before doing whatever it's supposed to do, and cancel that action if a double click occurs.\n. lines don't support cornerRadius, although they do support lineJoin: 'round'.  This will produce rounded connections at steep angles.  cornerRadius is just for Kinetic.Rect, and will eventually be used with Images as well.  Here's the line docs:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Line.php\n. if you want dramatic curves where the lines connect, you might consider creating an SVG path shape instead.  Here's an example of that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-path-tutorial/\n. Thanks for the pull request, and also thanks Davonium for helping me look at these :)\n. Currently, I'm not planning on supporting composite operations via an API, although I may later.  Closing this for now, but I may come back to it.  Thanks for this though!\n. yikes, sounds like a bug.  I'll add this to my todo list. \nThanks!\n. Actually, it looks like the setDrawFunc is working correctly.  Here's a jsfiddle that alters a Rect draw function:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/wJ36T/\nIn regards to extending Line - I don't think it quite makes sense to enable passing drawing functions into the Line constructor, since the whole purpose of Shape classes is to have a drawing function predefined.  If you want to reuse methods of Line, you can extend the methods instead of the whole class (this pattern is very common inside the KineticJS codebase).  Here's an example of the TextPath shape extending a method from Text:\nsetText: function(text) {\n    Kinetic.Text.prototype.setText.call(this, text);\n},\n. This is the correct behavior.  remember that transformations are applied after a shape is drawn.  We wouldn't want the height and width to take into account scale, or else scaling a node would have no effect.\nI would suggest either not scaling the node, and placing it in a different layer that's not scaled, or if it's absolutely necessary, you could include the scale with your setWidth() and setHeigh() usage.  i.e.\nnode.setWidth(100 / node.getScale().x);\n. this is very, very interesting.  The idea of having separate scene and buffer draw functions is very compelling... Might even make sense for every default shape to include a sceneDraw and bufferDraw method.  Devs could then also override the bufferDraw method with something customized if desired.  Such a change would also fit in nicely with the request to not render the buffer graph during animations.  I'll work on this for the next release :)\nP.S. thanks so much for putting so much thought into this!  I'm inspired\n. follow up with this thread - I've done a ton of work in regards to graph drawing logic, including the ability to define custom hit drawing functions via the drawHitFunc attr.  In addition, the drawing performance in general has been greatly improved, because there are now three different drawing functions - scene, hit, and buffer graph drawing functions.  This enables each draw function to be optimized for its purpose.  I'll have tutorials up within a week or so.\n. super interesting.  I've also been thinking about applying the winding rule to do stuff like this.  I currently have a todo item to create inner shadows, and I think using the winding rule would be an excellent approach.  The only problem, though, is that if users can create inner shadows for rectangles, they would also expect them for all other shapes.  It sounds like it would be quite a task to construct winding drawing procedures for all shapes.  And how would this work for images and sprites?  What do you think?\n. I'm not entirely convinced that every Kinetic shape should be able to support the winding rule to cut holes in them.  Wouldn't it make more sense to create shape plugins?  I.e. you could create a doughnut shape, Kinetic.Doughnut, which people download.  I intend to eventually provide a gallery of 3rd party plugins that people can download.\nThoughts? \n. Thanks!\n. I've had several requests to provide some sort of clipping functionality that would do exactly what you're asking for - I'll add it to my todo list :)\nThanks!\n. It'll be in the next release:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n\"container clipping function\"\n. Follow up - Clipping regions are now fully supported as of v4.4.0\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#440-mar-26-2013\n. I'm actually not able to replicate this. Check out this jsfiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/KdM55/\nI wrapped a console.warn() with two alerts so that I can detect if perhaps IE9 fails when executing console.warn() if the console window isn't open. Not able to get a failure.\nAlso, console.warn() is working correctly for me when the console window is open as well.\nDoes the jsfiddle work for you?\n. AH that's the problem.  IE9 running on Windows 7 64 bit is notorious for having problems :)\nI'll go ahead and make this change, thank you!\n. I wasn't able to auto merge the pull request because of some changes made to the dist files, so I went and just added the window.console part locally and committed it here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/b3e7e26248ec3a2d86653bf567aaa92c2b3523ac\nI'll still give you credit for the fix in the changelog though :)\nP.S., if you find any other bugs in IE9 on Windows7 64bit please let me know because I don't have that environment for testing.  Thanks!\n. dang IE10.  did you test on IE9, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, iOS, and Android?\n. might be a bug with IE10 because the getBoundingClientRect JS method is supposed to take into account all of the CSS styling of itself and ancestor nodes\n. haven't forgotten about this, will get to it asap :)\n. Hey Jason, closing this pull request for now because I haven't had anyone else mentioning this - I'll keep track of it though in my todo list.  I'm still waiting for MS to send me some test devices ;)\n. would you mind testing this in FF, Safari, and iOS if possible?  I'd like to pull in the change, but I'm currently unable to test on windows devices.  If you give me the thumbs up, I can just pull it in.\n. ah okay.  When I get a chance, I'll just pull it in, and if it works on all the devices that I'm able to test on, I'll commit it back to the repo\n. yes, you can use a clipping region, and then convert to the node to an image with toImage().  Here's a tutorial on clipping\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-clipping-functions-with-kineticjs/\nI would suggest, however, to use an Ellipse shape with an image fill.  This will produce smoother edges.  Tutorial on fills here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. have to agree wtih @lazerblade01 on this one - generally, in JavaScript, if you want to delete an object (such as a KineticJS Shape), it's not necessary to null out, or delete all of the object's properties.  Instead, you just need to remove all references to it, and the JavaScript garbage collector will do the rest.\n. Actually, here's another issue related to this one that makes a great point:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/29\nI'll spend a little time re-investigating this one.  Thanks!\n. nice, thanks!!\n. update on this thread: you can now create custom hit detection functions.  Here's an example functional test:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/tests/js/functionalTests.js#L862\nThis is pretty powerful because it gives us unlimited flexibility in terms of how standard shapes, or custom shapes, are detectable.  Furthermore, it also enables us to create high performance hit detection functions. \n. BlackScorp, did you try upgrading ruby?\n. Exactly.  Was going to mention that actually, all shapes support borders, including images, via the stroke property.  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-stroke-with-kineticjs/\n. I'll have to think on this one - not sure if I want to repurpose the Circle shape to support wedge shapes via an angle property.  From a code line count point of view, it makes sense.  From a pure OO point of view, circles aren't defined by an angle property.  At the moment I'm kind of leaning towards creating a Kinetic.Wedge shape instead.  Thoughts?\n. A full circle makes sense, that's what I would expect.  I'm also planning on making an Arc shape, and a Ring Shape, with a similar relationship between Wedge and Circle\n. Ring shape will be coming soon.  Closing this ticket for now\n. great catch!  Not sure how this was missed\n. oh I see how it was missed, the buffer canvas is immediately resized afterwards with _resizeDOM()\n. fixed it up - thanks!\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/908fa24b8e9b217ed6bbd8d75cec5ac04323f222\n. Actually, KineticJS used to throttle drag and drop, but this created a laggy drag and drop experience which most people didn't like.  We want the drag and drop to be as snappy as possible.\nI don't think the issue is necessarily the fact that drag and drop operations trigger redraws 60 frames per second, but that the getIntersections() algorithm should be revisisted.\nIf I were personally in your shoes, I would throttle the use of getIntersections().  In other words, on my dragmove handler, I would trigger a getintersections at about 10 frames per second or so as chris has suggested.\n. shoot didn't mean to close this one because getIntersections does need to be worked on.\nTo explain a bit further, I basically did a trade.  KineticJS hit detections are now nearly instantaneously fast.  The new algorithm, unfortunately, makes the getIntersections() method a bit slower.  Since the 99% use case is regular hit detection, this is a good trade off though.\n. okay, to be clear, there are two ways to get an intersected shape based on mouse position:\n1) getIntersection() - preferred\n2) getIntersections() - very slow, and should be used for special situations\nthe getIntersection() method is blazingly fast, and returns an object containing information about the intersection point, such as a reference to a KineticJS shape if one is there, or pixel color information.  \nthe getIntersections() method does the same thing, except that it iterates through and redraws every single node in the stage in order to return a collection of intersections that may have been layered on top of eachother. \n99 times out of a 100, you're probably just interested in the visible intersected node which is at the top of nodes beneath it.\nI've actually considered removing the getIntersections() method entirely, but haven't because there are some special situations when you actually do need a collection of intersections.  At this time, I haven't been able to find a way to speed up getIntersections, although I'll keep looking into it.\n. Closing this ticket for now.\n. is it possible you could set up a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  It's a bit hard to debug something like this without seeing it in action.\nThanks!\n. @eduardo ditto, looks good to me in latests version of Chrome.  What OS are you using?  32bit 64bit?\n. classic JavaScript closure problem.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work\nhttp://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62\n. drawFunc should never add or remove nodes.  Its purpose is solely for rendering.  Try hooking into an attr event, or a draw event, to remove a shape.  Also, tons of performance improvements have been made since these versions, so I'd recommend trying out the latest release\n. yep that's right, you cannot put layers inside layers.  If you want to layer things inside of a layer, you need to use groups.  Layers are like groups, except they are tied to a physical canvas element for rendering.  Be sure and read over the how it works page here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\nHere's an example Node hierarchy:\n/*\n     *        Stage(0)\n     *          |\n     *        Layer(1)\n     *          |\n     *    +-----+-----+\n     *    |           |\n     *   G1(2)       G2(3)\n     *    |           |\n     *    +       +---+---+\n     *    |       |       |\n     *   S1(4)   G3(5)  G4(6)\n     *            |\n     *            +\n     *            |\n     *           S2(7)\n     */\nG stands for Group, and S stands for Shape.  I'll try to make this more clear as soon as possible, thanks!\n. np!\n. A KineticJS shape can only have one fill and one stroke.  When creating more complex nodes, you need to use groups.  Here's an example of that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\n. oh snap, okay I'll take a second look.  Thanks!\n. Follow up: Just checked your code with the latest version of KineticJS, and it's working correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/JrCbx/\nMust have been fixed somewhere a long the way :)\n. Haven't forgotten about this - filters have been somewhat of a lower priority lately so I haven't gotten to this.  Hang in there :)\n. Thanks again for this!  I made your change here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/0c38e3cf391e80195af29bc2b75e3e967748c62b\n. planning on using Rob's excellent spline tutorial to enable curve smoothing for the Line shape\nhttp://scaledinnovation.com/analytics/splines/aboutSplines.html\nDo you think this will be sufficient?\n. Agree very much with you there.  Will keep doing my best to keep up with documentation.  Thanks!\n. Update on this thread:\n1) yes, the documentation has been updated\n2) The Spline shape has been created and works great.  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-spline-tutorial/\n3) The spline shape is great for creating  curved shapes based on points, but sometimes people don't actually want a spline, they want rounded corner connections (as was the original reason for this thread).  After a bit more thought, I think it makes sense to keep the Spline shape as is, and also add cornerRadius functionality to Line, afterall.  macfreak, I'll take another look at the work you did some 9 months ago.\nv4.6.1 is purely for bug fixes at the moment, so I'll try to get this feature added into v4.6.2\nReopening the ticket.\n. This will get into the code base soon.  I'm actually now planning on supporting rounded corners for all shapes, including rect, polygon, star, regularPolygon, line, etc.  This will most likely make it to v4.7.1 or 4.7.2 depending on other priorities (I'm currently working on splitting the Canvas class into a Canvas and Context class, adding context tracing, fixing some major bugs, and migrating unit tests over to Mocha, which will be in v4.7.0)\n. update on this thread.  All shapes will support rounded corners with v4.8.0.  This will definitely make it into that release.  Stay tuned.\n. This is the expected behavior.  Drag and drop modifies the translation of the entire shape, not the position of the points relative to the translation.  You can get the translation with the getPosition(), getX(), or getY() methods.\n. getPosition() works correctly for me after dragging a line (it returns non-zero result).  Can you setup a jsfiddle showing the behavior?\n. clicking on a shape inside of a group, which is inside of a group, which is inside of a layer, which is inside of the stage, works for me:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/8gAW4/\nclosing this ticket.\n. this is definitely an event bubbling issue.  I'll look into this as soon as I can.\n. ah okay.  the stage is using evt.preventDefault() to prevent the page from scrolling when you try to drag and drop.  Come to think of it though, it doesn't make much sense to use evt.preventDefault() everytime (i.e. for cases when you are not trying to drag and drop).  I'll look into this\n. This is possible today.  just make the whole stage draggable.  This enables panning.  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-the-stage-with-kineticjs/\n. hm, isn't that what scrolling is?  when you scroll downwards, you're panning the stage upwards, right?  If you're looking to implement scrollbars, here's a lab that shows a way to accomplish this:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-simple-scrollbars-with-kineticjs/\n. This has been fixed and will be included in v4.5.5.  Please see this issue:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/510\n. I believe this issue is now resolved - please try out the latest version of KineticJS and let me know if it's fixed for you.  The shadow properties have been flattened, and now look like this:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shadows/\n. eek!  That's very unusual.  I'll fix this today and release a hot fix, v4.1.1.  Thanks everyone for the heads up\n. SO sorry for the inconvenience guys.  Cross browser issues have virtually been non existent lately, so I didn't test FF or IE.  The problem was the '#' symbol :)\nReleased v4.1.1 which you can get on the homepage now: http://kineticjs.com/\n. that sounds very unusual.  Can you provide a jsfiddle demo, and also the OS and browser that you're using?\n. Strange, your demo works great for me on Windows 7 Chrome as well.  Are you using 64bit by chance?  It's notorious for having browser related problems.\nAlso, you should try out the latest version, v4.1.1, which greatly improved drag and drop performance by skipping the hit graph draws.\nLet me know what you find!\n. hi there!  interesting - I suppose IE9 is really inefficient about obtaining text metrics (no surprise).  Okay, to fix this, I need to cache the text metrics so that it doesn't have to be read over and over (probably should have done that anyways).  I'll see what I can do to get this fixed for the next release, and if not, it will definitely be in the following release.  sorry for the frustration!!\n. Thanks for the kind words!  So with v4.3.3, I made several Text performance enhancements which should help speed things up.  At the end of the day, the root problem is that the fillText() method of the HTML5 Canvas API is just darn slow.  This is a browser implementation issue, not a KineticJS one.  However, KineticJS can come to the rescue with node caching.  Check out this tutorial which runs pretty smoothly by caching text shapes:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-wheel-of-fortune/\n. hi I need more info.  Can you post a jsfiddle demonstrating the behavior?  Thanks!\n. yea, looks like a context problem inside the on() method.  I'll add this to my todo list.  Thanks!!\n. fixed!  The problem was that the drag and drop module still had a reference to the node that was removed which caused things to blow (in other words, this problem only occurred if your shape was draggable:true).  Here's the change:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/5e16b3d7d0538dce04d35a91acebc288918be51c\n. it fixed the jsfiddle mentioned in the issue:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/9YfSc/\nif there are other conditions where the problem occurs, can you create a new ticket?\n. try this: \n- resize the stage with setSize()\n- scale the stage\n- redraw\n- get the stage image with toImage() or toDataURL(),\n- set the stage size back with setSize()\n- scale the stage back\n- redraw\n. Hiya, unfortunately there's nothing KineticJS can do about this - KineticJS is using the requestAnimationFrame JS method, which means that the animation rendering is up to the browser implementation.\n. not sure where you're going with this, KineticJS already supports on and off, with those features.  Have you checked out the events tutorials?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-path-mouseover/\nAlso, why do you feel that it's necessary to create an Observer and Mediator class?\nKineticJS already supports the Observer pattern because devs have access to attr change events, and custom events\n. actually that doesn't quite make sense... there should be no reason to pass in a handler to the off method.  a namespace, or event type should be enough\n. currently, you can only directly use on() and off() on an array of nodes.  You can also use the apply() method to apply a method to an array of nodes:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Collection.php\nIt would be a big overhead for Kinetic.Collection to support all Node methods directly.  I would be willing to do it if there's enough of a demand, but currently there are much bigger fish to fry :)\n. ctx.stroke() will not work.  You must use canvas.stroke(this) in order for hit detection to work property.  The canvas variable points to both the scene graph renderer, and the hit graph renderer. \nIf you modify the tutorial with canvas.stroke(this), events are working correctly\n. following up with this thread - this issue has been fixed as of v4.5.5\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#455-july-28-2013\n. Hiya!  most of those errors are happening because you need to run the unit test suite on a web server in order for image data related stuff to pass due to security constraints.  Thanks for bringing this up, just realized that I need to mention that they should be ran on a web server :)\nas for the \"Problem with node and shape type selector\" error, that definitely shouldn't be happening, it's passing for me locally.  are you running the latest source files?  Have you made any changes to the selector logic?\n. OH.  got it.  I just checked the test, which is line 632 of the containerTests.js file, and test() should be warn() so that the failed dataUrl comparison doesn't block the rest of the tests (should be a soft test).  I'll fix this and check it in right now\n. fixed!\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/5705d909e59ee802a9f1c5ed937db9d81f4ead95\nAlso added more README info\n. sorry for the confusion, I cleaned up the Testing instructions here: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS\n. ah yes, I've seen this before but haven't gotten to it yet.  There's definitely some weirdness that goes on when you change tabs.  The problem isn't actually KineticJS, per say, but with the requestAnimationFrame implementation of the browser.  I do certainly need to add something in that prevents this from happening, perhaps some logic that detects if a new tab was activated, and then halt the animation until focus is returned.  Not sure if this is even possible though.\n. Thanks for this!  Will take a look as soon as possible\n. Closing this pull request because I'm planning on rewriting how touch events work soon (in order to cleanly support multi touch + gestures).  Thanks for looking into this!!\n. I remember really struggling with this, because each browser places the text in a slightly different position.  I remember that I had to use vertical align center to best normalize the inconsistent placements.  Have you tested your fix in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE9?\nIn Chrome, it's actually placed in the correct spot.\n. Hi again!  Unfortunately, each browser positions text slightly differently based on different configurations (Canvas API issue, not KineticJS).  I remember that I had spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to get all of the text to line up consistently across all browsers, and I ened up with the vertical align middle style as part of the solution.  \nI'm closing this ticket for now, but will keep it in mind.  Whenever I get the time, I'd like to reinvestigate text positioning across all browsers to see if things have changed.\nThanks again!\n. unfortunately, Windows 7 does not support touchstart, touchmove, and touchend (like every other browser that supports touch).  This is currently on my todo list, but haven't had enough demand for it to increase the priority.\n. oh actually there were was a slight problem that I fixed here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/df63558686c3b7ab65f427c5749534e80b6df253\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/bec7f5450b45d429dd0e3999b9e92f946902f9d1\n1) the frame width and height should override the shape level width and height, not the other way around\n. in the end, decided not to take the change after all.  The frame width and height should be defined by the width and height properties in the frame object, not the shape level width and height.  In the context of sprites, the shape level width and height have no meaning because the width and height of the shape actually changes depending on the frame because each frame can have different widths and heights.  Here's a good example of that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-sprite-tutorial/\n. hiya!  This will added to the next release.  Thanks!\n. done and done:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/01c5f4f7ca4e4ca03f497f7908b07e11885bb86e\n. works perfectly for me:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/xQSMe/\n. oh I see your problem.  The rotation property is a node property, which means that it's a property of the entire shape.  Frame objects do not have a rotation property.\nIf you want to rotate the whole shape for specific frame indices, you might try hooking into the afterFrame event via the afterFrame() method, and then rotate the whole shape accordingly:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Sprite.php#afterFrame\n. can you provide a screenshot with the output you're trying to create?  You might be able to use a single shape with a pattern to generate the 10x10 grid\n. are you sure that it's only slow once you do stage.add(layer), and not when you're adding shapes to the layer?   Did you measure the time for the double for loop as well?\n. interesting.  btw, when you do stage.add(layer), the layer is rendered.  So the ~3000ms is the time it takes to render the whole layer (which in your case is the whole stage)\n. have you tried not using clone() ?  just instantiate a new rectangle directly with Kinetic.Rect\n. Also, I'd like to see the code that you're using for the cloned shape.  That info will reveal where the slow down is occurring\n. Thanks for this!\n1) Shear transform is spot on, that's exactly how I planned on implementing it\n2) Arc shape - I have plans to implement this slightly differently.  I plan on having Arc extending Shape, and Wedge extending Arc\n3) Spline shape - I released my own version of Spline in v4.3.0, which extends Line, and also has a tension attr that lets you define the interpolation.\nSince the Shear code is a few lines, I'll manually put those in and give you credit in the change logs :)\nSeriously really appreciate the work you put into this\nCheers!\n. Haven't forgotten about this - will add it in as soon as I get the chance (been pretty swamped lately)\n. Will look into this before the next release. Thanks!!\n. ah, this is because the hit graph is no longer redrawn during drag and drop operations to improve performance.  Will have to put some thought into this.  Thanks!\n. yes, dragend should work as a work around for now.  I'll try and see if I can sneak this into the next release\n. ah okay thanks for the heads up.  I'll have this fixed by the next version, v4.3.2.  Thanks!!\n. Thanks! As i mentioned before, the problem is just that the hit graph doesn't redraw during drag and drop, so when the mouseup event triggers, the hit graph rendering isn't there to pick up the event.  The fix should be pretty easy, and will be in the v4.3.2 release sometime this week.\nHang in there,\nEric\n. Fixed!  Thanks guys for all of your help.  The fix will be included with the 4.3.2 release coming out this week.\n. This will hopefully be addressed soon.  I plan to eventually support multi touch in KineticJS, which should resolve issues like this.\n. very interesting stuff!  will take a look as soon as I can\n. for this use case, wouldn't it be simpler to stack sprites on top of eachother?  i.e. you could have a character sprite, an armor sprite, a weapon sprite, etc., inside of a common group.  That way, you can hot swap out armor and weapons by changing the corresponding sprites.  \nClosing this for now because I haven't had anyone else needing this feature.  I'll keep in mind though.\nThanks again!!\n. fixed this yesterday, thanks! (check the disqus comments at the bottom)\n. heya!  You're absolutely not coming across as a downer, totally appreciate it.  I want all of the tutorials and labs to be perfect :)\nI'll take a second look as soon as I get a chance, thanks!!\nEric\n. This has been fixed - it was a problem with the lab, not KineticJS\n. I believe this is more of an issue with implementation, not a bug inside KineticJS.  Your logic should never allow multiple circles to be \"active\".  touchstart should flag a circle as \"active\", and then you could have a function or method that synchronizes the drawing based on the active circle (model view pattern).\nIn regards to forcing a touchend when you touchmove out of the stage, I'm not sure that this is something KineticJS should enforce.  When this situation occurs, you can simulate a touchend like this:\nstage.simulate('touchend');\nor just trigger touchend directly:\nstage.fire('touchend');\nWhat do you think?\nP.S. your graphic looks really neat :)\n. this is the correct behavior.  the touchend event should be called only when you touchend over the shape that you bound the event to.\nIt sounds like you want the contentTouchend event.  This will fire anytime a touchend event is triggered, regardless if you're over a shape or not.  Try this:\nstage.on('contentTouchend', function() {...});\nLet me know if this doesn't work for you.\n. Yea, I was expecting this to be a problem :(\nThe thing is, I want KineticJS to move forward.  Previously, KineticJS only supported dashed straight lines.  If we hook into the native dash line support (only chrome supports this right now), then any stroke can be dashed, including splines (which is coming for the next release).\nI don't want browsers who aren't implementing the spec to hold us back.  Just like today in web development, if you're using IE6, you won't get pretty rounded corners.  This is a form of graceful degradation.  I fully expect most browsers (especially FF and Safari) to implement dashed lines soon.\nIt is true that I could put in logic that sometimes draws dashed lines when its possible, manually, in browsers that dont support dashed lines (like straight lines, or straight strokes in IE9), but this is effectively adding bloat to the framework in order to make up for browsers not keeping up.  Also, since dashed lines are purely aesthetic, it shouldn't break applications.\nWhat do you think?\n. FF is usually pretty good with keeping up.  I would be really surprised if they don't implement it within the next couple of months\n. For the time being, I don't have plans to reintroduce the lineDash logic just for the Line shape, because I'm fairly certain it will cause more confusion for people than its worth.  In doing so, line dashes will work in all browsers, but will only work for general strokes for browsers that have implemented lineDash.  It's easier to understand if its all or nothing, if a browser always supports it, or doesn't at all.\nTo me, the lineDash attribute is a lot like the border-radius CSS property.  When creating a website, you can use border-radius to get nice rounded corners in modern browsers, while knowing that older browsers will just render the sharp corners.  It won't break the app.  This is a form of graceful degradation.\nIf more people make a ruckus about this I'll consider putting it back in, but currently I have a lot of bigger fish to fry in regards to bugz and enhancements :)\n. what do you mean by \"break\"?  is a JavaScript error thrown?\n. This is the expected behavior.  When two shape perimeters intersect and are antialiased, how is KineticJS supposed to know which shape belongs to the pixel if its color key doesn't match either shape?  There's really no need to try and add extra logic to figure out antialiased pixel mappings :).  Antialiased pixels are simply not part of the hit region.\n. can you explain a bit further?  what do you mean by thumbnails?  Images?  what's broken?  JavaScript errors?\n. Would you mind posting this problem in Stackoverflow?  I'm really sorry, but I don't have time at the moment to walk through your code and pinpoint the problem.  There's a lot going on there.\n. KineticJS doesn't support \"drop\" and \"dragenter\" events.  Here's a list of the currently supported events:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\nthis behavior can be implemented using the intersects() and getIntersections() method.  Thoughts?\n. heya!  interesting - yes.  However, I haven't had much demand for events like these, so they would be put lower in the priority list.  As you mentioned, there's a lot of complexity with drop and drag enter events, in regards to how different users would expect it to work, which implies a lot of configurations, which implies a lot of complexity.  For now, I think it's best if left to the user to roll their own drop or drag enter logic, unless a lot of people start asking for it.\nCheers!\n. Github issues are mostly for bugs. I would suggest re-posting this on Stackoverflow so the community can help you there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. the code is a bit buggy... Github issues are mostly for bugs.  I would suggest re-posting this on Stackoverflow so the community can help you there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. your problem is here:\ncontext.fillText(\"I\", parseInt(width/2), parseInt(height/2));\nneed to use canvas.fillText().\nI would also recommend just combining a Kinetic.Rect with rounded corners and a Kinetic.Text shape.  Here's a tutorial on grouping:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\n. yep, just set the listening attribute to false with setListening(false).  Here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-listen-or-dont-listen-to-events-with-kineticjs/\n. Yep, pass an object as the second parameter. Here's the docs: http://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#simulate\n. yep, you're absolutely correct, thanks!  There's a lot to document, so there's a high chance there are other errors like this sneaking around the code base.  Fixed!\n. I believe what you need is the once() method - this is currently on my todo list.\n. Thanks!  This will hopefully be addressed with the next release\n. This is really strange code - why is a reference to the Rectangle stored after you've deleted it?  When you remove a node with remove(), all of its references in the stage are removed, including event handlers.  You should instantiate a new rectangle each time with new Kinetic.Rect();\n. ah, I see the confusion here.  the setAttr method shouldn't be public.  You need to set the draggable property with the setDraggable() method.  The code is here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/DragAndDrop.js#L138\nYou'll notice that this method invokes additional logic other than just setting the attribute.  I need to investigate whether I should change setAttr to _setAttr to indicate that it shouldn't be used (it's already not documented), or if I should allow developers to use the method, and add an overhead of attr event listeners to run extra logic for special attrs like draggable.\n. np!  It's a legitimate issue\n. cool app.  Though, there's no way I would have time to go through all of the code to find the issue.  Can you put together a simpler jsfiddle to demonstrate the problem?  It would be much easier for me to fix something there.  No one else has mentioned a problem with clicks not firing, so I'm guessing that you have something setup with jquery that's stopping event propagation. \n. Closing this for now.  Chrome has had lots of problems over the months related to canvas, so this may be resolved by now.  Please reopen if this is still an issue.\n. layer.get('.testText') returns an array of nodes, not a single node.  Here's the docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Container.php#get\nand here's a tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-select-shapes-by-name-with-kineticjs/\n. Hiya!  Believe it or not, this is the expected behavior.  The override coordinates in the dragBoundFunc are absolute coordinates, meaning that they will not be affected by transforms such as scales.  If you want the dragBoundFunc to adapt to the stage after it scales, the function will need to take the stage scale into account.\nCheers!\n. I made significant changes to remove() with v4.3.1, including a counterpart destroy() method.  Try it out and let me know if this resolves your issue.  Thanks!\n. great!\n. yep, have plans for that.  I'll try to get the change in for the v4.3.1 release. \n. Here you go!\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/4136ddb398f2138d8942bbe42024351a9d13e49b\n. I believe the problem you're seeing is that you're expecting drag events to bubble, which currently they do not.  dragstart, dragmove, and dragend events will bubble with the next version v4.3.2\n. correction, drag events will bubble with v4.3.4 which will be released next month\n. drag event bubbling was added in v4.4.0\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#440-mar-26-2013\n. does anyone know if this issue has been resolved?  I haven't heard of any issues like this in months.  (If mousemove was broken in FF, I'm certain that people would be filing more bugs left and right).  Please reopen this if it's still an issue.\n. This is not a bug with KineticJS.  The tutorial just needs to be updated\n. Probably will not work because it looks like hammer only works with DOM nodes. Kineticjs has plans for multi touch support, but its lower in priority at the moment. You can, however, do some of the multi touch work in your app. Check out this lab - http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-multi-touch-scale-shape-with-kineticjs/\n. Heya!  A few bugs were fixed with drag and drop with version 4.3.1.  can you give it a try and see if you're still having issues?\n. Wow that's pretty in depth, thanks!  My thoughts:\n- isEmpty --> great idea, I'll add something like this, or hasChildren()\n- global to local --> you can use getAbsolutePosition() and setAbsolutePosition()\n- too many shortcuts adds an unnecessary overhead to the library, both in size and maintenance, so I probably won't be adding much of those unless there's a really big demand for them.\n- good idea about an option for keeping an image width and height in proportion, although this could be extended to work with any node using size.  I'll add this to my todo list\n- chrisrittter has a good point in regards to the opacity comment, although it may make more sense to use a cloaking method (already on my todo list) which sets a shape visibility to false, but keeps the shape detectable.\n- very interesting about accelerated canvases!  I'll add this to my todo list as well\nThanks for all of your suggestions!!\n. The tutorial just needs to be updated.  Not a KineicJS bug.\n. Thanks chris!\n. don't use jquery to add events to KineticJS - KineticJS nodes are virtual nodes, not DOM nodes.  jQuery is a DOM library.  you need to use KineticJS event binding, e.g.\nshape.on('click', ...);\n. ah interesting okay, that makes more sense.  Does jQuery do this?  I suppose this is needed in order to make destructors?  Reopening ticket, thanks.\n. yep, Have plans to create a plugin like this as soon as the fundamental stuff is completed.  Maybe you could create one and publish it :)\n. Once KineticJS core is set in stone, I want to get the community involved with creating plugins.  I was also hoping that someone might be willing to create a KineticJS plugins website (I don't have the time to manage one at the moment)\n. This is the expected behavior - Ironically (and as expected) I made this change because a lot of people complained about the previous behavior.  There are only two options\n1)  If the mouse ever leaves the stage, force drag end and stop the drag and drop operation (this is how it used to work)  A lot of people complained about this when their app had draggable elements near the stage edge\n2) keep drag and drop alive when the mouse goes outside of the stage (current) with the caveat that if you mouseup outside of the stage, and then move the mouse back into the stage, the drag and drop operation is still alive.  The only way to overcome this is to add a mouseup listener outside of the stage - however, this should definitely not be done, because a widget should never bind listeners to DOM elements outside of its container.\nThoughts?\n. The general consensus is that this is the expected behavior (other software that implements drag and drop works exactly the same way).\nIf you'd like to force drag and drop to end, you can just do this:\nshape.stopDrag();\nhere's the docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Node.html\n. Yikes!!  This is pretty serious.  When using linear or radial gradients, it appears that shadows are also being applied to the stroke if one is defined (if you don't define a stroke, you don't get the double shadow)  I'll fix this up by the next release, v4.3.2\n. Fixed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/624ec25c2991aa5bf611b44562aa5d8d054efbab\nA logic problem was introduced when the fill attr was flattened.  This fix will go out with version 4.3.2 that I'm hoping will be released this weekend or next week.\n. Don't forget that under the covers, KineticJS is using the Canvas API, which means it's under the mercy of the browser implementation. \nHave you tried scaling the image instead?  image.setScale(2);\n. Okay, I'll keep this one in the back of my mind in case something comes up where this can be addressed client-side.  Thanks!!\n. Actually, the problem is that the API for setSize() changed.  in v5.0.1, you have to pass in an object literal.  In v5.0.2, I'll be adding back in the option for passing in two arguments via setSize(width, height).  Lab is updated.\n. Hiya!  Unfortunately, I believe that Microsoft has created new Event types (not in the w3c spec) that they expect all developers to use in order to handle touch events on wp8.  I haven't had a chance to look into it yet, and actually pretty annoyed with them in general.  The only reason I would consider supporting wp8 is because you fine folks are requesting it :)\nI'll keep you posted\n. +1 Samurai\nVery sorry for this, but Kinetic.Text needed an API do-over.  It's much cleaner and consistent now.  Here's the updated Kinetic.Text tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-text-tutorial/\n. cool!  I'll look into this as soon as I get a chance\n. Nice job!!  It works great\n. whoops forgot to update this!!  Adding it to the next release todo list right now :)\n. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. yikes, this is more than a typo, it's a logical error,  The intent was for clockwise to be defaulted to false.  Fixed up now.  Thanks for catching this!\n. thanks, I'll look into this.  It's possible that the method was changed for some reason.  Thanks!\n. yep, stage.remove() will remove the stage.  if you want to remove a layer, use layer.remove() (this doesn't destroy the layer but just unhooks it from the node tree).  If you want to actually destroy the layer, use layer.destroy()\n. You guys are correct.  I finally had a chance to look at the lab, and there is indeed a problem with this scenario:\nappears to be a problem with .get() when trying to select children of the parent of a node that is being dragged and dropped, with dragOnTop = true. See drag and drop with resize lab\nThe quickest work around for the lab is to set dragOnTop = false for the anchors.  I've updated the lab and it's working again.  I'll address the problem with get() by the next release.\nThanks guys!\n. Fixed - the dynamic drag layer now does a deep copy for the Groups and Layers that are reconstructed (which means they now also pick up ids and names and should play well with selectors).  The change will be available with the 4.3.2 release this week.  Thanks!\n. you should be able to clear the fill color with:\nsetFill(null)\nhave you tried this yet?\n. Even so, this is an unexpected behavior, so I'll get this fixed by v4.3.2.  Whenever a fill type is set, KineticJS should clear the other fill types.  Thanks!\n. Okay so I put a bit of thought into this.  I don't like the idea of the fill rendering style being determined by the order of setting fill configurations.  First off, it creates a huge logic overhead everytime a fill attribute is set (will be a performance hit).  Second, it's inconsistent with all the other KineticJS attributes.\nWhat I've done instead, is created a mechanism that makes it really easy to toggle between different fill types, if you choose to set multiple fill types.  You will now be able to use the fillPriority attribute, which can be color, pattern, linear-gradient, or radial-gradient.  \nLet's say that you want to toggle between a color fill, and a radial gradient fill.  When instantiating the shape, you can set both the fill property, and the radial gradient fill properties.  If you want the shape to start out with the radial gradient fill, then set fillPriority = 'radial-gradient'.  Then, if you want to toggle to the color fill, just use shape.setFillPriority('color').  \nThoughts?\nP.S. setting the other fill attributes to null does work, and is essentially another way to coerce fill type priority.\n. This is probably related to the issue people are having related to the mouseup event not being detectable during drag and drop after some rendering optimizations that I made.  I'll address this issue by the next release:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule/_edit\n. haven't forgotten about this issue - it'l just take a little time to get to it.\n. interesting thanks!  I'll fix this up before the next release.\nThanks!\n. Thanks!  Fixed up now.\n. You have two options:\n1) fork the project and do a build\n2) wait and download the official release sometime this week (will be v4.3.2)\n. np!\n. thanks firebluetom for the initial assist :)\n. This is a known issue - I just need to update the tutorial.\nThanks!\n. I'm marking this as invalid now because the dragOnTop functionality has been deprecated because it was causing too many issues.\n. Hiya, if you're still looking into this, I would suggest reposting on Stackoverflow because the community support is really great there\n. hiya, I'll be creating a public method to programmatically stop drag and drop soon - until then, you can do:\nKinetic.DD._endDrag();\nThat should stop the drag and drop.\nAlso, a lot of changes were made to drag and drop with v4.3.2.  These may resolve your issue as well.  Please reopen this ticket if it does not.\nThanks!\n. I think it's a bit cleaner, and more consistent, to call the callback with the context of the node, so that the node is accessed via the \"this\" keyword, similar to drawFunc.  Here's the commit:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/9160b694ae24413319e53796af8d75321d0860b2\nThanks for bringing this to my attention!!\n. The fill attr has been flattened. When in doubt, check the change log\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nOr check out the updated tutorial\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. drats you're absolutely right.  I'll get this fixed by the next release.  Thank you!\n. Fixed up, the change will make it to the 4.3.2 release this week.  Thanks!\n. Cool! I created something just like this for a client some months ago, and used event delegation to handle the resizing for shapes that had the resizable=true flag.  I don't have any tutorials up for plugins at the moment, but the general idea will be for your code to live in the Plugins namespace.  Essentially, you would create a new file, and do something like this:\nKinetic.Plugins.Resizable = function(....)\nand do your magic there.  Then host your file on a personal website, or as a Github project.  Eventually, I plan to create a gallery where people can submit plugins.  When people want to use your plugin, they will just include your JS file.  The best plugins are the ones that are seamless, such that users don't have to do much extra work, if any.  In my case, simply adding the JS file, and then adding resizable=true to shape configs made them resizable.\nCheers!\n* Update *\noh and almost forgot, if you get this up and running, be sure to send me a link so I can link to it from kineticjs.com\n. Cool!  I'm planning on building a community plugin gallery in a few months. Keep your eye out for it (although, I'd actually prefer if someone else managed a plugin gallery). Well see how it goes\n. absolutely, that would be awesome\n. This is probably related to the new drag and drop performance optimizations that were made recently.  I'll have this addressed by the next release, thanks!\n. Hi again!  It turns out that you've surfaced an even bigger problem with KineticJS (whether you meant to or not).  When both a node and its ancestors are set to draggable=true, currently KineticJS gives the oldest ancestor priority over any of the descendants.  This isn't a very good design.  I made a change that now gives nodes priority over its ancestors.  So now, if both the stage and a shape is set to draggable = true, when you drag and drop a shape, just the shape moves, and when you drag and drop the stage, the whole stage moves.  This will eliminate all the mouseover and mouseout logic you were adding to achieve this behavior.  \nThanks again!\n. Each stage can contain multiple layers, and each layer has its own canvas.  You can access the canvas element with:\nlayer.getCanvas().getElement();\nHere are the docs of interest:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Layer.php#getCanvas\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Canvas.php#getElement\n. interesting, I believe this may be a result of an optimization I made with the transitionTo method.  I bet the callback is being executed after the first Tween is completed (a Transition is made up of several tweens).  I'll look into this one.  In the meantime, you should be able to work around this by adding a small timeout in your callback function, say 50ms or so to be safe.\n. great!  Sorry for the headache\n. This should be fixed now, because the transition callback is executed after the last tween has finished, instead of the first.  This logic change will be in the v4.4.0 release coming out this weekend.\n. hmph haven't heard about this.  I've added it as a todo item for the 4.3.2 release because it sounds pretty serious.  stay tuned.\n. Actually, all of the mouseout and mouseleave unit tests are passing fine, and I did several manual tests verifying the functionality as well.  Could you post a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  \nThanks!\n. Hiya!! ah, the problem is your custom shape.  A custom shape can only have one path, here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shape-tutorial/\nIf the bg rendering needs to have events tied to each element, you should combine a Line with a Rect using groups:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\nIf you don't need events, and just want to use the canvas API, you can create a separate layer just for the background rendering, and then draw directly onto the canvas element.\n---- About sponsoring\nSweet!  KineticJS has lots of code created by the community, so would love to see any pull requests you come up with.  Typically, small enhancements and bug fixes are the most likely pull requests to be accepted.  If you'd like to sponsor the project financially, here's the sponsor page:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Sponsor-the-KineticJS-Project\nCheers!\n. Each shape can only have one path for two reasons:\n1) The high performance hit detection algorithm requires that each shape has one path (this is how KineticJS is so fast)\n2) Shapes are defined as primitives.  Anything that's composed of multiple primitives should be a Group.\nHere's an example of drawing directly onto the layer canvas (check out the curved lines)\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-modify-curves-with-anchor-points-using-kineticjs/\n. Exactly!  All languages have primitive and complex data types.  With KineticJS, all Shapes are primitives, and you can combine multiple shapes to create complex shapes (like complex data types)\nIn regards to inheritance, I know.  I was originally using a more robust inheritance pattern, that enabled developers to easy extend any Node in the framework.  This, however, comes at quite a performance cost (as much as 2x).  KineticJS uses a very high performance inheritance pattern, which in turn makes it harder for developers to extend Nodes.\nThinking about it now, I could easily create a public extend() method that automatically propogates properties and methods to children nodes when extending a parent Node.  I'll add this to my todo list!\nI only have one branch, the trunk.  Currently, I only make new branches for experimental stuff.\n. that's the KineticJS specific extender.  The modules are loaded in such a way that methods and properties will automatically propagate to children nodes.  I need to create a new public extend method that traverses children and sets those methods and properties regardless of the module load order.  This extend() method will turn into a private _extend() method.\n. hiya!  Can you create a jsfiddle for me so that it's easy to try out?  Thanks!\nAlso, have you checked the changelog? https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\n. +1 Thanks firebluetom!        \n. Heya, originally I was going to use NodeJS for the build, but someone created the Ruby build for me early on, and it's been working great so far.  Don't think it's really a big deal to put in an effort to ditch Ruby at the moment, but if I'm convinced that it's needed, I'll let you know :)\n. hiya, this is a known issue.  rotationDeg is actually a special attribute that converts the degree and maps it to the rotation attribute.  I have plans in the near future to hook the transition config object into this mapping.\n. The transition class has been deprecated in favor of Tween, which does now support rotationDeg.\n. you have a couple of options:\n1) apply a slight shadow to the line such that it creates a 1px border\n2) create two overlapping lines, such that the bottom line is a bit thicker than the top line, which creates a border around the top line.\nThere's no plans at this point to support line fills.  But this could change if enough people request it.\n. drats!!  This was a side effect of some major Kinetic.Text refactoring that was bundled with the release.  I'll fix this up and put out another release this weekend (I would put out a release out tonight, but I want to wait and see if any other problems come up).  I'll add a new set of text functional tests so this doesn't happen again.\nThanks so much!\n. fixed!  This will be pushed out sometime this week as v4.3.3\n. this is the new expected behavior.  \nI don't understand, you want the whole stage to be pannable, and also have shapes drag and droppable?  Only one thing can happen at a time.  Can you expand a bit further?\n. As soon as I get a chance, I'll try and backfill older versions in the version archive.\nv4.3.1 is the last version to support text drag and drop.  A bug with text drag and drop was introduced in 4.3.2, which will be fixed this weekend with 4.3.3\n. so all of the versions are now in the CDN (including v1.0.0).  I just need to go through and update the links to them.\n. could you possibly setup a jsfiddle demo?  You've explained the problem great, it would just help me save a bit of time.  Thanks!\n. I just did a lot of testing on different browsers, including Firefox, and transitioning the layer opacity to 0 works correctly for me, even when its containing a circle and text.  Closing this ticket for now - if this is still an issue for you, please create a jsfiddle to demonstrate the problem.  It might be related to the way you're building the stage.\nCheers\n. You're right, it shouldn't be running that slow.  Is each sector track an individual shape?\n. I'll go ahead and create a lab that's similar to what you're doing (mine will be a wheel of fortune demo) and I'll check out the performance there.  You're use case just doesn't really have anything that should be slowing the Kinetic engine down.  I'll get back to you later tonight.\n. Well got to the bottom of it.  Strangely, I never saw this happening, but KineticJS appears to have a major performance issue when animating nodes nested inside other transformed nodes, which is only surfaced when we're animating lots of groups.  And, I believe I know the root cause - I've been wanting to revisit how I construct transformation matrices for nested nodes, and it looks like now may be a good time to do this.  I'll have this addressed by v4.3.4.  Stay tuned!\n. p.s. as a work around for your use case, I would recommend not nesting shapes inside one another with groups, unless you can wait until the end of next month for this issue to be addressed.\n. Update: after more digging, I discovered that the culprit is actually Kinetic.Text.  Nested groups still render lighting fast, the problem is just text.  I believe the problem is related to the fact that I'm not caching text metrics - I'll keep digging.\n. After further digging, I've found that the root problem is really just the fillText method of the canvas context.  Basically, drawing text is just really slow with HTML5 canvas.  This isn't a KineticJS specific issue.  To improve performance (I'm talking about getting the FPS back up to 40fps+), you can cache the text node as an image.  Here's a tutorial on that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\nI'm currently working on a lab that does just this, so I'll let you know when it's published so that you can use it as a guide.\n. exactly.  Groups nested in groups nested in groups perform great.  drawing text with HTML5 canvas does not.  Hopefully, when I get this lab out, it'l be a bit more clear on what you need to do to dramatically boost the FPS.\n. Here you go sir, cached text nested inside of a group, which is nested inside of another group:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-wheel-of-fortune/\nShould be somewhat similar to what you are doing\n. There's lots of ways to animate colors, I typically increment the rgb components of a color (0-255) and then set the fill to 'rgb(x,x,x)'\n. This is by design.  If you don't want the drag and dropped shape to go to the top layer, you can set dragOnTop = false\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#setDragOnTop\n. why is draggable being toggled on and off on mousedown and up?\n. It sounds like the root problem is that right and middle click should not trigger and drag and drop.  I'll fix this up.\n. this ticket has not been closed which means that it hasn't been worked on yet :)\n. It's been added to the release schedule\n. would definitely be cool.  I have big plans to eventually open up a community gallery page where people can submit 3rd party plugins like this.  If you're interested, by all means, setup a github project page and build it out.  I could link to it from the homepage for now.\nCheers!\n. You're absolutely right, this is a bug.  I'll have this fixed up with the next release, v4.3.4.  Thanks for catching this!\n. Thanks for the assist Chris!  Yes, I'm planning on doing a release mid March\n. that sounds reasonable.  I committed some refactored code that fixed the dragend / mouseup ordering bug:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/966ebf2a326fb32911d38d79f3c3ac68ade5c347\nI'll also prevent the click event from firing once the drag and drop operation has started\n. on second thought, I think I'll keep it the way it is for now.  The definition of a click is when a user mouses down inside of an element, and then mouses up inside that same element.  There might be cases where someone intends to click on an element, and if they accidentally drag the element by 1px, we don't want to prevent the click event from firing.  I think it makes more sense for you to add logic on your end to prevent the click when the user is in drag and drop mode.  I'm open to keeping this discussion open though :)\n. Hiya!  Since this isn't a KineticJS specific issue, would you mind reposting this on Stackoverflow?  I'm currently using Stackoverflow for the discussion forum:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. very interesting, this does indeed look like a bug.  I'll address this one with the next release (v4.3.4)\n. as a work around, you can set the dragOnTop property to false.  There appears to be a problem with the layer cloning step with the dynamic drag and drop layer.  \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/HHfMG/\n. by default, the dragOnTop property is set to true, which means that when you drag and drop something, KineticJS dynamically builds a temporary drag and drop layer, moves the node to that layer, and then animates the drag and drop.  When finished, the dynamic layer is destroyed, and the node is moved back to its original container.  Super complex, but it provides a pretty big performance boost because only the node being dragged and dropped is redrawn for each frame, rather than its entire associated layer.\n. I double checked that this is no longer an issue.\n. Most likely a geographic issue.  KineticJS is using Godaddy hosting, and this isn't the first time that people have seen down time in different areas.\n. I've seen this before - it's actually a byproduct of the browser implementation of path fills in relation to context translations.  I'll add this to my todo list and investigate further.\nThanks!\n. Closing this one for now, please let me know if this is still an issue. GoDaddy typically gets these types of outages resolved fairly quickly.\n. Heya, I have plans to go through the codebase and add return this to the appropriate methods, but haven't had a chance yet.  Stay tuned!\n. I looked very carefully at your jsfiddles, and the positioning of everything looks correct.  Maybe you are mis understanding absolute position?  Here are the positioning rules:\n1) x and y are always relative to the parent container\n2) when you use setAbsolutePosition, this method calculates the relative x and y that you need in order to position the node absolutely.  If you update the position of a parent container, the child container position will move as well because its x and y position are still relative to its parent\nThoughts?\n. Oh and, not sure if you knew this, but you can also set the absolute position when an object is created like this:\nvar sqr3 = new Kinetic.Rect({\n            width: 50,\n            height: 50,\n            fill: '#FFFFFF',\n            stroke: '#00FF00',\n            strokeWidth: .4,\n            id: 'sqr3',\n            name: 'sqr3',\n            absolutePosition: [10, 120]\n        });\nThe sqr3 shape's position will change, however, the moment you change the position of one of its ancestors (this is by design).\nIf you truly wanted a shape to be fixed in a specific position, you shouldn't nest it inside of a group.  Just add it directly to a layer, and don't change the position of the layer.\n. hiya! Nope, it's on my todo list.  Kinetic.Text has been heavily refactored over the months, and support was temporarily dropped.  It will be added back in the v4.3.5 release\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\nSorry for the confusion!\n. this never made it to the codebase, unfortunately.  It is still on my todo list.  Priorities keep pushing it down the list.  Stay tuned.\n. After more thought, I've decided not to support none 2d contexts.  It just doesn't make sense with KineticJS.  I created several variants of  KineticJS + Three.js, and I found that the easiest thing to do is to just overlay a KineticJS stage on top of a Three.js canvas, or vice versa.  There's just absolutely no benefit to having this built into KineticJS.  I'll put up a lab on html5canvastutorials.com that shows a clean way to combine KineticJS and Three.js.  Thanks!\n. Ah, this is a regression bug, which occurred when the remove() behavior changed to just removing a node from the node tree, rather than fully destroying it.  The reset() method should call a new method called destroyChildren().  I'll fix this up by the next release.\n. Also, I'll be sure to add better unit tests around the reset() method to make sure this doesn't happen again.  Thanks for catching this!\n. Hiya!  As of v4.3.4, I'll be removing the reset() method entirely, because it is essentially the same thing as stage.destroy() and new Kinetic.Stage().\nThanks!\n. thanks for looking into this!  I'll try and get this in asap\n. interesting, I'll have this fixed up soon\n. Following up with this thread - I don't believe that I should be validating all inputs.  Where would I draw the line?  Param validation will degrade performance, which doesn't seem to be worthwhile when most people are sending the correct data types.  I think it makes more sense for the developer to send the right data type into a method as described by the docs, at least for now.  i.e. you should use shape.move(parseInt(x), parseInt(y));\nP.S. I'm still open to adding validation to all methods, I would just need to have enough of the community wanting that feature, and I'd have to make sure the perf consequences arn't too bad.\n. the getDOM method was deprecated and replaced with getContent() in v4.3.1.  Here's the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\n. I don't believe that performance has gone down, but there is a bug related to drag and drop on mobile devices that causes a flicker.  Is this in reference to drag and drop?  If so, the work around is to set dragOnTop: false in the shape config.  This particular issue will be fixed with the next version, v4.3.4\n. yes, please reopen if this is still an issue.  the dragOnTop property was deprecated.  Drag and drop should perform quite well now because a lot of optimizations have been made since this ticket was filed.\n. this doesn't quite look right. e is an array that should look like this:\n[0, 'blue', 1, 'red']\nare you using the correct format for the colorStop property?  Here's an example\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. no, you have a valid point.  I came up with the single array idea to try and make the config as easy as possible.  Perhaps, as you've suggested, a 2d array might make sense, or even some other notation.  Keep the ideas coming.\n. odd, your jsfiddle is actually working correctly for me in Chrome on Windows7.  What browser and OS are you seeing the problem?\n. might also be related to Ubuntu.  This would be a pretty serious issue, and I haven't had anyone else reporting a similar issue, so there might be something going with the Ubuntu Chrome combo\n. ah interesting!  Sorry about this - the interpolated control points are set when points is set, which is dependent on tension.  As you've noted, if tension isn't yet defined, the control points won't be set correctly.  The control points should be set if either points or tension is set, and the other property is available.  I'll have this fixed up soon.\n. I created a unit test for this case, and it appears to be fixed now.  I've done several refactorings of the points and tension attr handling, so it was probably fixed a long the way.  Try out v4.5.5 when you get a chance and let me know if it works for you.\n. Hiya!  First off, I'd recommend upgrading to the latest version, v4.3.3.  Quite a bit has changed since v3.10.0 - here's the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nI'm closing this ticket in Github since it's not related to a bug with the library.  You may try reposting on Stackoverflow - the KJS community is pretty helpful there:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. do you mean an exception is thrown if you fire a custom event when nothing is listening for it?  If so that definitely sounds like a bug.  I'll add this to my todo list.  Thanks!\n. fixed!  This will be a part of the 4.4.0 release coming this weekend.  Thanks for reporting!\n. did you post the right link?  It's pointing to an example of toImage, which appears to be working correctly.\n. can you expand a bit more on what you're expecting, vs. what is happening?  I checked the jsfiddle in chrome on OSX, and I correctly see two images (the second image was produced with toImage).  Thanks\n. what exactly is your use case?  Are you destroying the node after dragend, or while drag and drop is occurring? \n. great!  Okay I'll have this fixed by the next release.\nCheers!\n. Fixed!  This will go out with th 4.4.2 release.  Thanks!\n. Hate to say this, but it is now createImageHitRegion()\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-pixel-detection-with-kineticjs/\n. great!\n. can you show me the code that you used to generate the text?  a jsfiddle would be best\n. the demo runs really smoothly for me in FF 19 on MacOS.  What OS are you using?\nAlso, why are you using such a large canvas?\nP.S., KineticJS will soon support clipping functions at container levels (such as layers and groups), and this can be used to optimize render performance.  So if for some reason a particular rendering is slow, this would be one way to alleviate it.\n. First off, have you guys:\n1) created multiple layers, and grouped things together inside layers that are redrawn frequently, or together?\n2) reduced the amount of text and shadows for intense animations? (this is a canvas rendering constraint, not a KineticJS one)\n3) tried out node caching?  caching greatly improves performance, because it essentially converts any piece of your drawing into an image.\nThe next release of KineticJS will now have clipping built into all containers so that you can define clipping paths around particular regions of interest on a layer to further tweak performance.\nIf you're seeing a problem exclusively with FF, there's a good chance it's just FF not performing well.  I'll keep on eye on this.\n. Thank you Jason!\n. Awesome thanks.  Yea, I've gotten into the habit of running mocha-phantomjs test/runner.html before committing to make sure everything passes\n. looking into this right now :)\n. This isn't a complete solution, because there's actually 3 different variants of toDataURL.  One for Stage, one for Layer, and one for Node, which covers Shape + Group.  The fix for this problem will have to be a bit more generic.  Still looking into it.\n. So a couple of things:\n1 I'm not able to reproduce this problem, toDataURL() is working correctly for me with non 1 pixel ratio devices (like iOS)\n2 you submitted this pull request about a month ago.  A lot has changed since then, and I've fixed up some pixel ratio issues as of version 4.3.3.\nI'm closing this ticket for now because I believe this should already be fixed.  Try out the latest version and see if you still have problems.  If you do, reopen this ticket.\nThanks!\n. Unless of course, you are testing on Android.  I do recall seeing some people having pixel ratio issues on Android devices\n. Reopening this because I can't replicate the issue for older versions of KineticJS.  I'm assuming that you're using an Android device correct?\n. ahh okay.  Thanks!\n. hi again!  I did some more research, and there appears to be an inconsistency between chrome and Safari on devices with retina display (like the macbook pro with retina display).  I don't currently have a laptop with retina display, so would you mind checking both Chrome and Safari?  From what I've read, I'm guessing that the problem you're seeing will occur in only one of these browsers, while the other browser will work correctly.  Thanks!\n. okay I got to the bottom of this.  The problem occurs if you don't specify a width and height.  (as a work around, if you specify the width and height properties in the dataURL config, it works correctly.  Thanks!\n. Agreed.  I'll start tagging versions starting with the next release, v4.3.4.  Thanks!\n. One thing that has changed with the newer versions is that drag and dropped shapes are moved to a temporary layer for performance reasons.  I bet the problem is related to that change.  As a work around, you can use dragOnTop:false to keep the shape in the same layer.  This should fix your problem.\n. would you mind reposting this on stack overflow?  This is not a KineticJS bug, it's an implementation question.  Thanks!\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kineticjs\n. cool idea.  I'll add it to my todo list\n. This sounds very promising!!  Thanks for doing this.  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.\n. sweet!  Can't wait to pull this in and try it out.\n. Works like a charm!  Beautiful work.  Thank you so much for fixing up the text wrapping problems (this was on my todo list but I just hadn't gotten around to fixing it up yet).\n. Thanks again for your work.  Attribution is in a few places here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. very interesting.  I agree, the dragstart event should use the event object generated from mousedown.  I'll add this to my todo list.\n. actually, after putting a bit more thought into it, I don't think we should pass the mousedown event object into drag start.  For now, I would recommend storing a reference to the event object, or the evt.button, for use with subsequent events such as dragstart and dragmove.  I'll still keep thinking on this though.\nThe reason is that, as you pointed out, dragstart is triggered by mousemove.  It would be odd for a user to mousedown, wait 2 seconds, and then start dragging (which triggers drag start),  and then pass a mousedown event object to dragstart.\n. this is just the effects of anti-aliasing.  You can  use a custom hit function to reduce the hit region.  Here's an example\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-custom-hit-function-tutorial/\n. Thanks for bringing this up!  It turns out that the uniformity isn't really an issue.  The idea of the getRandomColor() key is to return a (probably) unique rgb value as fast as possible.  After some investigation, I discovered that Math.round() and Math.floor() are actually quite slow.  Using a bitwise or operation is much faster.  More on that:\nhttp://jsperf.com/math-floor-vs-math-round-vs-parseint/2\njust committed the change.  \nThanks!\n. +! nitriques.  There are lots of ways to load and preload images, and I didn't want to bloat KineticJS with logic not related to canvas.  For simple cases, use image.onload = function() to instantiate your image.  Here's an example\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. this is incorrect.  the arguments variable is a reference to the arguments array.  The arguments are referenced this way because the number of arguments is not known ahead of time.  Here's some reading:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments\n. yep, this wasn't over looked, it just hasn't been implemented yet.  It will get in there soon.\n. @lavtron Tweens no longer support complex objects.  You have to define each component.  Here's a working example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/5jbyw/\nso you need to do:\nvar tween = new Kinetic.Tween({\n node : node,\n duration : 1,\n offsetX: 2,\n offsetY: 2\n});\ntween.play();\n. I used to support complex objects, but the Tween class started to get really huge, and really complex, and really coupled to KineticJS attribute types (x, y, width, height, r, g, b, points, etc).  To keep the Tween class light weight, I decided that for complex objects, you have to pass in each component individually.  This keeps the Tween class much more decoupled\n. agreed.\n. Ah, the problem is that the id attr is being copied over to the temporary drag and drop layer (since you have draggable:true), which results in an override of the layer id in the id hash.  As a work around, use draggable:false, or dragOnTop:false\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/RNCXz/4/\nI'll add this to my todo list, thanks!!\n. This would break many, many things in KineticJS if I allowed developers to pass in their own canvas elements (I looked into this to investigate the possibility of passing in Three.js contexts into a KineticJS layer).  At the end of the day, it's much cleaner, and simpler, if you just overlay a KineticJS stage on top of your own canvas element, if you're doing something special (or vice versa)\n. Side note, KineticJS is a bit more complex than EaselJS, because it automatically handles the canvas elements for you - one scene canvas and one hit canvas per layer.\n. I don't believe that there are any 2d canvas libraries which are also compatible with excanvas.  If you're requirement is to use a graphics library which works in all browsers, you might consider going with Raphael.js, which has an SVG and VML renderer, but is much slower and less feature rich than a canvas library.\n. what is the use case here?  You need the time to be set back to zero?\n. sounds like you should be using Tweens.  Here's what you're looking for:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-stop-and-resume-transitions-with-kineticjs/\n. That is correct.  Currently, stage.toDataURL requires a callback.  I will be changing that soon though (trying to make everything synchronous)\n. you can also access past versions here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Version-Archive\n. and sorry for the confusion.  I intended for most developers to use kineticjs.com as a portal to downloads, docs, and tutorials.  I use github for advanced stuff.\n. Thank you!\n. You're absolutely right, some things could be done to be more minification friendly.  I'll get to this as soon as I can, although it's a bit lower in priority than other items.\n. Heya.  In the future, please post implementation questions like this on stack overflow.  Also, your problem is JavaScript closures :)\n. you're not supposed to initialize containers.  it's an abstract class.  You can initialize Stages, Layers, and Groups, which extend Container\n. Ubuntu or Linux?\n. This was a problem with Google Chrome.  the latest update broke versions of KineticJS for 4.3.1 and below.  The best way to fix the issue is to upgrade to a recent version of KineticJS.  Sorry for the headache :(\n. @nitriques yes, I push KineticJS versions to the Amazon Cloud Front CDN\n. +1 chrisritter, nice!  That totally makes sense.\n. @3tcubed truly sorry for that.  now that the event target can be any node type, the name of the property needed to change.

I'll put this fix in with the next release\n. This has been fixed and will be a part of the 4.4.1 release this weekend.  Thanks!\n. Thanks louis!  I missed this as well.  Yes, it appears that the last word auto wraps regardless if it fits or not.\n. this is currently fixed.  The patch will be released as v4.4.1 this weekend:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. you're using the method incorrectly.  When in doubt check the docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#remove\nyou can also use destroy() if you want to comletely destroy the node\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Node.php#destroy\nWhat you want to do is just yellowGroup.remove()\n. Here's the official tutorial on labels (which can be used for tooltips):\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-label-tutorial/\n. this was done intentionally.  I believe that the current w3c spec for CSS index handling is critically flawed.  As an experienced web developer, I can't tell you how many times I've seen other developers break applications because of z-index issues (z-index conflicts, and developers trying to create the highest z-index, so you see z-indices of like 9999 and 99999).  I think KineticJS's spec is much cleaner.\n. Also note, that if you want to get the absolute z Index (like the CSS spec), you can use getAbsoluteZIndex()\n. Hey @ruionwriting !  I specifically did not want KineticJS index to work like CSS z index, because quite frankly, I feel that the w3c spec for z indices is just weird.\nYour approach is the right one - just use shape.moveToTop() to move a node to the top of its siblings.  Or, if you have a separate layer dedicated for drag and drop stuff, you can do shape.moveTo(layer).\nThis example of drag and drop does something similar:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-drag-and-drop-stress-test-with-1000-shapes/\n. Thanks for this!  One other question - would you mind looking into padding as well?  It looks like horizontal padding isn't taking affect with text wrapping\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-text-tutorial/\nIf not just let me know, and I can take a look :)\nThanks!\n. Hiya!  After taking a second look at your pull request, it looks like you're now correctly taking padding into account.  Great!  I'll do some more testing before I release a patch this weekend.\nP.S. don't fret this - the 4.4.0 release was a big one which introduced a few regressions anyways.  We'll have everything up to snuff soon :)\n. This is working correctly for me in Both Chrome and Firefox:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-layering-with-kineticjs/\nCan you be more specific when you say \"moveToTop doesn't work\".  Very hard to debug that :)\nAlso, to be clear, moveToTop moves a node to the top of its siblings inside a common parent, not to the top of all nodes in the stage.  i.e. if you have two layers, and some shapes in the bottom layers, calling moveToTop() on one of those shapes will place the shape at the top of the siblings in the bottom layer.  The shapes in the top layer will still be  above the shape that was just moved to the top.\n. No problem!  Great.  This ticket scared me because that would have been a major bug ;)\n. Chrome seems to have introduced some bugs with older versions of KineticJS.  These problems are not present with the latest release, v4.4.0\n. Unfortunately there's nothing I can do about this - The update broke older versions of KineticJS (v4.4.1 and below).  You'll have to upgrade to a newer version.  Sorry for the headache!!\n. +1.  I definitely recommend to try and keep your KineticJS version as up to date as possible.  Browsers (especially chrome) tend to break things quite often.  When this happens, KineticJS typically has a hot fix release to overcome whatever was broken.\n. Hiya!  The drag layer was removed with v4.4.0 because it was causing too many problems.  Here's the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nalso, the afterDraw() method has been removed, in favor of .on('draw').  \nSince the drag layer logic has been removed, I believe you can remove all of the code mentioned in your ticket.  The shape will stay in its layer as you drag and drop, so there's no reason to keep it in sync.  if you want to update another layer as you drag, you could do this:\nlayer.on('draw', function() {\n  layer2.draw();\n}\n. ah must have missed this - I'll have this fixed in the next release which is going out in about a week (v4.4.1).  Sorry for the headache!\n. Is this specific to v4.4.0?  Does this work in earlier versions?\n. interesting - does KineticJS fail in some situations?  I'll look into this soon.  Thanks!\n. could you possibly create a simple jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  That would be very helpful :)\n. I don't believe I have any unit tests that cover stage.destroy().  I'll look into this soon\n. I'll be looking into this soon.  My guess (without looking at the code) is that the hit graph is not being redrawn correctly, since a LOT of refactoring was done in regards to scene and hit graph rendering.  This will be fixed by the weekend.  stay tuned.\n. no prob!\n. this is the expected behavior.  Although, it doesn't look like this is spelled out explicitly in the documentation.  I'll update that asap.  When stage draggable is true, the stage is in panning mode.  Here's a tutorial on that:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-the-stage-with-kineticjs/\nThanks\n. help with debugging and implementation issues need to be on stack overflow.  Github tickets are for cases when you can demonstrate that there's a problem with KineticJS itself\n. guys, just listen for events on the container DOM element with addEventListener(), jQuery, YUI, etc.  At that point, you need DOM events, not KineticJS shape events\n. added this to the release schedule, thanks!\n. Hiya, yes, this should be fixed up by v4.5.2.  Here's the todo list for that release:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule#452-mid-june-2013\n. priorities.  Be sure to check the release schedule to get an idea of when bug fixes / features will be released:\nCurrently this issue is scheduled to be released in the middle of July, assuming that no other urgent issues pop up, and push it into August:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule#455-mid-july-2013\n. Thanks again for starting this thread!  Finally got around to fixing this one.\n. Thanks so much for looking at this!  It turns out that the way default attrs is handled was rewritten, and the index default was lost.  The problem is that we shouldn't be accessing the index property directly, we need to use the getter method so that the default is returned, i.e. getIndex()\n. thanks!  The getters and setters are dynamically generated at here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Sprite.js#L113\n. I believe you're misunderstanding what stage.on() does.  stage.on('mouseup') does not fire a mouseup event anytime you mouseup inside the stage.  It fires a mouseup event when you mouseup inside of a shape (all events are relative to shapes).  It sounds like what you want, is to listen for mouseup on the container DOM element instead\n. Here's a (more concise) demo that shows that a rect background is working.  There's too much going on in your code for me to take a close look.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/mCGQC/\n. Thanks for looking into this!  It turns out that what you proposed was very close to what I was looking for, but there were a few additional things that I needed.  Thank you!!!\n. shoot!  Yes, arrays are modified by reference in JavaScript.  I hadn't taken that into account with handling the default.  I'll take a look at this soon.\n. Hiya!  Thanks for looking into this.  I still believe that if the developer wants to hook into general events for the stage, they should do so at the DOM level by adding events to the container, or the content DOM element.\n. I'll keep in mind.\nFor your second use case, if you want to detect events on spaces where there's not a node, you can add an event listener to the container DOM element, and also do this:\nstage.on('mouseup', function(evt) {\n  evt.cancelBubble = true;\n});\nThis will prevent the event object from bubbling up to the container DOM element, and therefore will not fire the event handler bound to the container\n. you can use stage.getPointerPosition() at anytime to get the pointer position.\n. This looks really cool!  Can you explain a bit more on what exactly it does and how it works?\n. Awesome!  Do you think it would make sense to change the filter name to Mask?\n. hiya.  I would need to see some code :)  Perhaps you could post something in jsfiddle or stackoverflow\n. Hi all, please upgrade to the latest version of KineticJS.  This issue was fixed with v4.4.2. The problem was occurring with a .bind() method that was added with a pull request. iOS 5.1 and below does not support bind().  Change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\n. hiya!  Are you using the latest version of KineticJS?  A recent release of Chrome broke older versions of Kinetic\n. Great!  Thanks for verifying \n. Thanks everyone for helping eachother!  KineticJS is truly a community project :)\n. Isn't it already a module?\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Global.js#L157\n. Thanks @lavrton !\n. Hiya, \n1 you're custom shape doesn't have context.beginPath().  this fixes the drag and drop issue:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/D9tzR/\n2 this is a pretty small issue, since people shouldn't be setting the radius to 0.  I'll take a look none the less :)  Thanks!\n. Glad to hear!  I've spent a lot of time on it :)\n. Heya!  This was fixed last night actually.  the v4.4.1 patch will be going out this weekend.  stay tuned!\n. Interesting, I'll have to put some thought into this.  As a temporary work around, have you tried replacing the ids with names instead?  If you keep the names unique, it should still function as a unique identifier\n. Currently no, although it's on my todo list :)\n. On second thought, I'll add these to the next release, v4.4.2.  Thanks!\n. The problem is that clone should not also clone ids, since they are unique identifiers.  This change is scheduled to get in pretty soon.  \nIf this is urgent, you can modify the KineticJS source code here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L954\nand we'll need to create a new attrs object that doesn't contain the id key.  That new object should be used to instantiate the cloned object.\nStay tuned.\n. These methods were deprecated.  Please use the beforeDraw and draw events instead.  i.e.\nlayer.on('beforeDraw', function(){...});\nlayer.on('draw', function() {...});\n. Thanks!\n. Heya, I ended up removing the before funcs completely, which means that we don't need to add the this.afterDrawFunc on line 54.  Closing this one.  Thanks!\n. can you create a jsfiddle showing the problem?  The tutorials on html5canvastutorials are working great.\n. this is really strange.  in my local copy, it is capitalized, in the repo, it's lower cased, but Git doesn't detect the difference.  Looking into this.\n. heya!\nin response to \"There is also the potential problem of having an anti-aliased (and thus unpredictable) pixel color value mapping to an entirely different shape color key just by chance alone.\" - This is actually untrue.   Anti-aliased pixels are not different colors, they simply have opacities that are less than 1.  Anti-aliased pixels will never trigger other shapes\nOne way to solve your particular problem is to create custom hit regions.  You actually have full control of the hit region paths.  For example, you could increase the hit region by a pixel around your shape.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-custom-hit-function-tutorial/\nI will however, spend some time investigating this further to see if there's a high performance solution to the problem.  I'd like to note though, that my impression is that this isn't a problem for 99.9% of KJS users, which has made it slightly lower priority than other things.  I'll keep the ticket opened.  Stay tuned!\n. @tomg7 I don't think your test results are proving what you believe to be happening - are you picking out the pixel color from the scene graph or the hit graph canvas?  KineticJS uses a hidden hit graph which is rendered with completely different rules than the scene graph, as defined in the Canvas.js renderer class (for example, full opacity is always used)\n. @tomg7 also, each browser produces slightly different results for all canvas renderings.  pixels will be slightly different from browser to browser.\n. That's a great suggestion fogbrain.  would you mind trying it out and submitting a pull request?  Otherwise I can add this to my todo list to further investigate\n. Hi Jason, not sure where you're going with this - KineticJS doesn't use the bind method anywhere in the codebase.  Could you expand a bit?\n@vc05946 can you be more specific as to what the problem is?  JS error? \n. wow okay.  I think that probably snuck in with a pull request.  I'll take a closer look at this.\n. can you guys do me a favor - I don't currently have access to an iOS 5.1 device - could you apply the change made with the fix above to your version of KineticJS, and let me know if it resolves the issue?  Thanks!\n. scratch that, I came up with a cleaner solution that completely removes the bind() dependency all together.  It didn't need to be there in the first place.  This will be included with the v4.4.2 release.\n. I don't believe this is an issue - the Label plugin is actually a group that contains Text and a special Custom Rect shape.  the Text shape itself will not have the idea - the group will.  You need to do this:\nvar id = evt.targetNode.getParent().getId();\n. great!\n. I'll look at this as soon as I can.  Will be adding webgl support this weekend.\n. Hi guys.  After a lot of careful thought and prototyping, I've unfortunately decided not to support non 2d contexts.  It's actually pretty easy to combine KineticJS with other contexts anyways, such as Three.js.  More on that here\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/282#issuecomment-16328614\n. you're absolutely right.  the remove() method in Shape is supposed to be destroy.  fixing that right now.\n. yep, it will be removed.  Shape extends Node, so Shape has access to all of Node's methods.\n. could you possibly setup a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  That would really help me fix this faster.\n. drats, I'll fix this up today and release a 4.4.3 patch.  Looks like my regression tests missed this one.  As a temp work around, you just need to add the utility back to Type.js:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/v4.4.1/src/util/Type.js#L286\nThanks!\n. hiya, have you looked at this lab?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-world-map-svg-path-with-kineticjs/\nDo you have a special highlight layer setup, so that you don't have to redraw the whole map each time?\n. P.S awesome demo.  Can I link to it from the kineticjs homepage?\n. it's not an event detection issue - it's probably a redraw issue.  are you drawing the regions on mousemove or mouseover?\n. Great!  No worries, I have yet to put up some KineitcJS performance tips on the HCT tutorials.\n. do you have a div id = \"Frame\" ?\n. are you sure that the backbone view executes after the DOM has loaded (i.e. on dom ready).\nbefore initializing the stage, you can do a test:\nconsole.log(document.getElementById('Frame'));\nto see if the Frame div is available or not.\n. the .bind method has been removed because older browsers don't support it.  It snuck in with a pull request about a week ago.  Update to the latest version of KineticJS and that error should go away.\n. I don't believe this is a bug.  isDraggable returns the draggable property, which is set to true or false.  when you use startDrag, you are forcing drag and drop regardless if the shape is draggable or not.  Forcing it to drag and drop should not auto set draggable to true\n. yep, this is absolutely a bug.  Thanks for pointing it out!  I'll have it fixed with the next release\n. you shouldn't have to do anything special to remove an image from memory.  KineticJS should remove all of the references to the image object, which means that the JavaScrip engine should auto garbage collect, unless of course your app still has a lingering reference to the image object\n. This issue has been fixed as of v4.5.4.  It will be released this weekend.  Thanks!!\n. here's the readme for unit testing:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS#testing\nlet me know if that doesn't clear things up\n. np!\n. I think you're misunderstanding remove vs. destroy.\nremove() removes a node from the stage, but keeps it intact, in case you want to re add it later, or even add it to another stage.\ndestroy() calls remove() to detach it from the stage, and then actually destroys the node so that it's no longer accessible\n. what you need is destroyAll, which will be added to the next release\n. you're looking at the minified code.  Here's the method in the source:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Global.js#L121\ncan you be more specific as to what doesn't look correct?\n. #1 you're still focusing on the minified code (you shouldn't, you should be looking at the sourcE).  #2 the minified code reads like this:\nif(c!==undefined){for(var d=0;d<c.length;d++)\nwhich is valid\n. as a side note, you can also hide the shadow with the shadowEnabled = false property so that you can preserve your shadow configs when toggling it on or off.\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/symbols/Kinetic.Shape.php\n. Nonetheless, I'll take a look.  Opacity = 0 should work.\n. fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/85c99c1bb9c482fcca2008cf47f8dff644fa9ed7\n. Everything seems to be running great in FF and IE for me.  Can you please post your working code into a jsfiddle so I can take a look there?  I also need to know exactly at what point things are breaking.  It's likely an implementation issue since no one else has reported problems like this.\n. KineticJS doesn't support text gradients at the moment, although it will soon.  Stay tuned.\n. common technique for proper scoping in JavaScript.  Look online for information about anonymous functions.\n. will look at this as soon as I get the chance, thanks for posting :)\n. I've promoted this ticket in priority.  I'll try to get this fixed for v4.6.1\n. @edplus you are correct, I demonstrated the hit canvas issue by forking the jsfiddle here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/37pG3/\n. another update on this thread: I'm actually in the process of putting together the 4.7.0 release.  This bug is still present.  It will be fixed along with some other hit graph enhancements in v4.7.1.\n. drats, you're right, the augmented methods will be lost after serialization.  I'll have this fixed by the next release.   Thank you!\n. Image properties are serializable, but not the images themselves.  It's mentioned in the tutorials and the docs:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-load-complex-stage-with-kineticjs/\nImages aren't serializable because you'd essentially have to store giant data URLs in the json, which is just silly.\n. you can do that.  just set a custom attribute like this:\nvar image = new Kinetic.Image({\n  image: ...,\n  src: 'image-src.png'\n});\nor you can set it like this:\nimage.setAttr('src', 'image-src.png');\nwhen you call toJSON(), your custom src attr will be picked up.\n. strange.  Is this for v4.4.3?\n. Thanks!  I'll have this fixed up by the next release.\n. Thanks @lavrton.  @SneakyBobito please reopen this ticket if it's still as issue.\n. You cannot add layers inside layers.  You should be adding groups to the layers.  Here's an overview:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki\n. I can see how it would work, since both Layer and Group extend Container.\nI was thinking the same thing.  I'll add some logic that prevents layers from being added to layers.\n. that's expected.  You should always call layer.draw().  if you call group.draw() or shape.draw(), the layer will not be cleared, and you will just be drawing on top of the layer.\n. Thanks for doing this!  I'll be adding the skew transform in the next release.  I'm planning on adding these methods:\nsetSkew()\nsetSkewX()\nsetSkewY()\ngetSkew()\ngetSkewX()\ngetSkewY()\nrather than working with angles.  These methods can be auto generated with the new addPointGetterSetter methods.\nAs a side note, this means that I'll have to change the skew() method in the Transform class, such that it accepts an x and y component, rather than an x and y angle.\nReally clean code btw :)\n. This will be supported eventually, stay tuned!\n. Thank you!!\n. It's working for me.  Can you post a jsfiddle of some sample code?\n. +1 yes this is working for me.  Here's a simpler use case:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/R94ZP/1/\n. You're absolutely right, it does fail.  The work around for now is that you can immediately set visible=false after instantiating\nlayer.setVisible(false);\nI'll have this fixed by v4.4.4\n. This issue is on the road map for v4.5.2:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. Hiya!  This is already fixed in the github repo.  It will be released with v4.5.0.  The problem was that the dynamic point getters were being defaulted to an object literal containing an x and y property, and all of the nodes that were defaulted with the object literal were sharing that same object (objects are modified by reference in JavaScript).  Thanks for hanging in there!\nEric\n. Not enough info here.  please repost this with more context (more code) on stackoverflow.  Thanks!\n. This is not a bug. You need to call layer.draw() to redraw the layer\n. Thanks for this!\n1 will be fixed with the next release\n2 will be solved immediately if I incorporate Green Sock transitions into KineticJS (may be coming very soon)\n. Yes, priorities shifted every so slightly.  It turns out that I'm going to release 4.5.1 with a new Tweening class, because I'm no longer going to recommend developers to use GreenSock by default.  #2 will be addressed with the new Tweening class as well (working on this right now)\n1 will make it into 4.5.2, which will be released sometime next month :)\n. KineticJS tweens now support tweening point arrays (v4.5.4).  This includes tweening Lines, Splines, Blobs, and Polygons.\n. here's an example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-animated-clown-face/\n. you're forgetting layer.draw().  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. can you submit this as a pull request?  Just create an RGBA filter in the Filters folder.  You can use the other filters as a template.  Thanks!\n. Hiya!  Performance depends on so many factors, I can't really provide you with any specific, especially without seeing your code (but, it sounds like it's a complex app, which means that I wouldn't have the time to look through it).  Would you mind reposting this on stack overflow, along with some code snippets?  If I don't get time to help you there, the stackoverflow community is usually pretty good about responding quickly.  Post a link to it from this ticket :)\n. Hiya!  This should be resolved in the latest source, which will be a part of the 4.5.0 release later this month.  The extend method no loner accepts object literals or arrays (which can be modified by reference).  If you need an immediate fix, you could pull in the source code from git, and build the library at its current state.\nSorry for the headache!\n. I'll add this to my todo list, although it's a bit lower in priority than most of the other items on the list.  Thanks!!\n. on second though, this is a pretty easy change.  I'll try and have this fixed by the next release, or the following release.  I just need to check if the node has a parent when adding it to a container.  If it does, automatically run remove() :)\n. if you build from source, that's considered bleeding edge, because there could potentially be big bugs that haven't been addressed yet.  any of the published versions are stable releases.  Are you having any issues with v4.5.4?  If so, please reopen this ticket :)\n. Two things that kill performance on mobile is Text + Shadows.  Have you tried removing shadows for the mobile experience?\n. P.S. cool demo, I'll be linking to it from the homepage soon :)\n. are you redrawing the layer afterwards?\nshape.destroy();\nlayer.draw();\n. I believe this was fixed with v4.5.4, because I fixed some issues with .remove() and .destroy() in which children were not correctly being destroyed.  Can you try with this version and see if you still have an issue?  If you do, please reopen this ticket :)\n. This is an issue with anti-aliasing.  It'l be addressed with the next release\n. This is all fixed up.  Thanks!!\n. Hiya!  I'm about to release v4.5.0.  This issue will be addressed in 4.5.1.  Stay tuned!\n. sorry, this hasn't been addressed yet.  I just need to add a check to make sure that nodes aren't added multiple times.  Should go in for the next release.  Until then, just make sure that you don't add something multiple times ;)\n. this logic has not been added in yet.  As a work around, can't you just make sure that you don't add a node twice to the stage?  Shouldn't be that hard.  if node.getParent() !== undefined, don't add it to the stage again.  That's pretty much the logic that will be added in.\n. hiya!  Are you seeing any JavaScript errors?  I'm not familiar with Qt\n. Ah okay, this means that Qt is using an older version of webkit which doesnt support requestAnimationFrame.  I have a ticket open right now to fix this for older versions of Safari, which would also resolve your problem.  The fix will be included with v4.5.1, which will be released next month.\nIf you need the fix faster, delete the RAF code block:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L200\nand set the raf variable here to FRAF.  get rid of the ternary\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L214\n. scratch that.  the problem is this line:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L206\nwhich should be returning FRAF, not Animation.fixedRequestAnimFrame, which doesn't exist\n. Fixed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ddee366f96f7374cbf7517f90ded1fa2cd43f080\nYou can either clone this github repo and do a build a yourself, or just modify the kinetic js file with this change.  Let me know if this doesn't resolve your problem\n. :)\n. Don't have the time to look through your code, but I can tell you that I've seen several really complex apps run smoothly on mobile devices with KineticJS.  Your app crashed my iPhone as well, and  I've never had it crash before :)\nCould you repost this on stackoverflow so that the community can chip in?\nis it possible to use a smaller canvas size?  I know that even if you use say a 200 * 400px sized stage on iOS, the viewport can still resize such that the stage is full screen.  Are you using caching?\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\nClosing this ticket in favor of you creating a stackoverflow thread.\n. ah, you should never have been setting attrs directly to the attrs object.  It prevents a lot of things from happening, that need to happen, under the covers.  I'm surprised that your app was working before!\nIn short, you just need to go through and use setter methods.\n. for example, when setting x and y, some optimizations are made to improve draw performance by handling matrix caching.  This can only happen if you use the setX() method.\n. wow this sounds pretty serious.\naccording to my perf tests, GS actually ran a bit faster than my original implementation of Transition.  Is it possible that your patch introduced a perf hit?\nOne cool thing about using a 3rd party transition library is that it only updates properties, it doesn't handle the redraws.  KineticJS still fully controls the animation engine, and the redraw logic.  I'll take a look at this.\nAnd in terms of the license.  How can I say this.  Holy crap.  I was under the impression that GS did not require a license for use under any condition.  From this alone, I'll have to to pull it back out (won't be too much trouble).\nThanks for pointing this out!  Looks like I'll be releasing v4.5.1 soon.\n. I'm working on a new Tween class that's similar to my old Transition class.  It will be like a Lite version of TweenLite, optimized specifically for KineticJS.  It's nearly complete.  The API will be consistent with Kinetic.Animation and Kinetic filters.  The api will look like this:\nvar tween = new Kinetic.Tween({\n  node: rect,\n  x: 300,\n  ease: Kinetic.Eases.EaseInOut,\n  duration: 1\n});\ntween.play();\ntween.pause();\ntween.reverse();\ntween.reset();\ntween.finish();\ntween.kill();\ntween.goto(time);\nsimilar to Kinetic filters, the ease property will point directly to a function, not a key that maps to a function.  This will make it easier for developers to create their own easings, or even pull in easings from other libraries.\nThis will come packaged with KineticJS v4.5.1 (or it can be removed using the custom build).  It will not provide methods for tweening along curves, or controling tweening order via Timelines.  For these types of advanced use cases, I'll point people to GS. As Jack points out, most people won't need to purchase a license.  But I absolutely don't want people to create an app with KineticJS + GS, and then later find out that they need to buy a license for the GS portion, especially if they are just doing some basic tweens.\nSince this is a rewrite, I'm expecting the performance to be screaming.  stay tuned.\n. Thanks for hangin in there!  4.5.1 will be released this weekend.\n. Done.  Here's the commit:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/622041aeafb9b5bfe4108b89e9f6c156c4f55ec8\nand here's an example usage:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/tests/js/manualTests.js#L173\nI also added the ability to yoyo with a yoyo property.  I didn't have a need for a kill() method.  Anytime the tween pauses, the corresponding KineticJS animation auto stops.  If you remove a reference to the tween instance, the JS garbage collector will auto remove it from memory.\nOne last tweak that I need to add, is tween overrides.  When two tweens are tweening the same property of the same node, the last tween needs to take precedence.  I'll have a follow up commit with this tomorrow.\n. The new Tween class is a full rewrite.  The old Transition class was a port that someone from the community submitted.  There were a lot of things that I didn't like about it, such as the \"onFinished\" event name.  This has changed to \"onFinish\" to be consistent with other event types, such as onClick, onMouseover, etc.  I took out the \"ed\" :)\n. hey guys, it does turn out that a bug was introduced when refactoring the Animation class - the setTimeout fallback was lost.  It's been fixed and will be a part of 4.5.1:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule#451-apr-11-2013\n@mihhail-lapushkin can you verify if a JS error was being thrown? \n. Thanks!  I changed the onFinished key to onFinish\nthe 4.5 animation issue will affect all browers using an older version of webkit.  I believe CocoonJS uses webit, correct?\n. right, it uses accelerated canvas.  Okay.  I didn't think that KineticJS every worked wth accelerated canvas.  It's already on my todo list.\n. It is done.  v4.5.1 is live.  Here's a tutorial that shows off the new API:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-stop-and-resume-transitions-with-kineticjs/\nSorry for the confusion!\nP.S., I still fully believe that GreenSock is the best Tween library on the planet.  for more advanced use cases, drop the Tween class and go with GS.\n. transitions didn't \"stop working\" in 4.5.0, they were removed in favor of GS transitions.  Here's the changelog:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nfortunately, I've decided to drop this as well, and put back in a new Tween class that will perform better than Transition.  This will be added back into 4.5.1.  Sorry for the confusion!  stay tuned.\n. No problemo!  Wait until 4.5.1 is released.  It'l be released tonight.  \nThe old transition class was pretty limited.  The new Tween class is looking pretty slick so far :)\n. It is done.  v4.5.1 is live.  Here's a tutorial that shows off the new API:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-stop-and-resume-transitions-with-kineticjs/\nSorry for the confusion!\nP.S., I still fully believe that GreenSock is the best Tween library on the planet.  for more advanced use cases, drop the Tween class and go with GS.\n. the problem with back pat is that it bloats the code base over time.  KineticJS is still evolving pretty rapdily, so I'm not quite ready to start adding back compat in newer versions (getting close to that point though)\n. Thanks :)\n. I'll fix this up tonight.  stay tuned.\n. interesting.  I'll take a close look at this and see what's slowing down setX().  Stay tuned!\n. Hi again, could you try something for me?  comment out these two lines of code from the unminified source:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L946\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L948\nThis prevents the handling of attr change logic.  If this is the culprit, I need to consider handling attr change events differently.\n. I'll do some perf tests when I get a chance.  I'll let you know what I find.\n. This says it all:\nhttp://jsperf.com/kineticjs-setter-perf\nI knew that the attr change logic would add a little bit  of overhead, but not a 25% overhead.  I'll fix this up by requiring devs to explicitly subscribe to different attr change events via subscribe().  If an event has not been subscribed to, KineticJS won't bother traversing ancestors to see if an event handler exists.\n. and here's v4.5.2-beta (much faster)\nhttp://jsperf.com/kineticjs-4-5-1-vs-4-5-2-beta-render\n. yep.  I turned off event bubbling for attr changes.  It's kind of a weird thing to bubble anyways.\n. Interesting.  Okay thanks for this!\nP.S. I'm currently investing a whole slew of potential performance enhancements, because although KineticJS is blazingly fast on desktop apps, I want it to be as fast as possible on mobile.  Stay tuned :)\n. yes you need to use images.  the jaggedness of fill patterns is controlled by the browser rendering engine.  Not much we can do there.\n. just do this:\nshape.on('click', function(evt) {\n  var target = evt.targetNode;\n  var nodeType = target.nodeType;\n  var shapeType = target.shapeType;\n}\n. ah, yes, I'll fix this up soon.  Thanks!\n. fixed as of v4.5.2.  Thanks!\n. interesting.  This is a valid use case.  I'll add this to the release schedule for v4.5.3.  Thank you!\n. The Tween class was re written in v4.5.4.  Kinetic Tweens are no longer made up of an array of tweens.  Now, a single value is tweened between 0 and 1, and the change is applied to all of the properties.  This should resolve the problem you're seeing with v4.5.3.  Let me know if it does not.\nThanks!!\n. that sounds reasonable.  I'll add this to my todo list, thank you!\n. unfortunately, I believe that sub domains still count as different domains.  Don't ask me, I wasn't part of the WHATWG group :)\n. I'll have this fixed by the next release.  stay tuned!\n. great!  I was going to recommend moving the entire stage.\nstage.getContent().addEventListener('touchmove', function(evt) {\n  stage.setPosition(touchX, touchY);\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer){\n    layer.batchDraw();\n  });\n});\n. I see where you're going with this, but I don't think the solution is to create a new node attribute.  You might want to alternate between buttons, or you might want to enable several buttons.  Also, this doesn't really have a parallel for mobile devices (touch events)\nIf you want drag and drop to only work with specific mouse buttons, you have several options\n1) on the drag handler, you could cancel drag and drop if the mousebutton isn't the one you want by calling node.stopDrag()\n2) you could cancel event propagation on mousedown if the mouse button type isn't the one you want\n3) you could manually trigger drag and drop by hooking into mousedown, checking for the button type, and then calling startDrag()\n4) there are probably several others\n. fixed.  The algorithm now looks at the pixels around the pixel of interest if it's anti-aliased. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/aa78d632dbc89ace518890946dfc3947bcd74d89\n. which areas?  I'm able to see the click event when clicking on multiple regions\n. I see what's happening.  You're hitting anti-aliased pixels.  I updated your jsfiddle to show the hit graph below the circle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/GXWFY/20/\nnot quite sure how to solve this at the moment... very interesting edge case.\n. As a work around, if you ensure that the text is positioned at whole number pixels, anti-aliasing won't occur in the hit graph.  see if you can replicate the problem with this jsfiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/GXWFY/21/\n. I'm closing this ticket for now, although I will be investigating anti-alias issues at some point.  be on the watch for that.\n. Thank you sir!!\n. It might be browser / OS specific.  Which browser OS are you using?  are you able to repo the problem in other browsers?\n. Yes this appears to be related to newer versions of chrome.  The problem is that Chrome takes over the mouseevent, and assumes you are trying to drag and drop the canvas element offscreen as an image.  Here's the work around:\nstage.getContent().addEventListener('mousedown', function(evt) {\n        evt.preventDefault();\n      });\nThis will prevent chrome from taking over the event.  I'll add this to the next release.\n. fixed.  Releasing a patch tonight, v4.5.3\n. please repost this on stackoverflow.  Make sure you don't have a JS closure problem :)\n. Yes, please check out the revamped docs + new tutorials\nThe new Tween class is much more robust than transitionTo\n. how odd, thanks I'll look into this today\n. Thank you!\n. I'm planning on hooking jshint up to my build, but haven't had the time quite yet :)\n. I tried modifying the following tutorial to tween brightness, and it worked as expected:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-tween-blur-filter-with-kineticjs/\nCan you do the same and let me know if you can repo the problem?  \nCan you post an example on your own website showing the problem?  Try to create the simplest demo (I won't have the time to look through a lot of code).  As you've pointed out, the Brighten filter doesn't touch alphla values, so I can only suspect that something else is going on in your code.\n. Hi there!  will try my best to look into this soon.  As you might guess, I have hundreds of todo items on my plate at any moment in time.  I do offer support licenses, if you're interested, which gets you dedicated help and priority bug fixes:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Purchase-a-Support-License\nstay tuned\n. by the way, I've added a new Brighten filter tutorial here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-brighten-or-darken-image-tutorial/\nwhich doesn't seem to have any problems with opacity.\nI'm closing this ticket for now because I'm just not able to reproduce it.  I'll keep an eye out for this, and if I come across it, I'll reopen the ticket.\n. Thanks for the clarification!  I didn't realize that the problem was specific to pngs.  thank you!\n. ah interesting.  Do you think it would be a better solution to just clear the existing filter canvas?  I'm sure that will perform better than creating a new canvas each time.\n. sounds like a memory leak with destroy().  Will look into it soon, thanks!\n. ah yes, that makes sense.  It just so happens that the remove() method doesn't correctly remove children.  This is on my todo list for the next release.  Since destroy() uses remove(), calling destroy() will also fail to destroy the children, causing the memory leak that you've experienced.  Stay tuned!\n. This should be fixed now.  The latest release, v4.5.4, now correctly removes and destroys children:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#454-june-9-2013-current\nPlease reopen this ticket if this does not fix your issue!\nEric\n. transitionTo was replaced with Tween.  Here's the changelog:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nHere's updated tutorials:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-linear-transition-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. sorry about this, I'll have this fixed up soon.  The truth is, I've dropped the ball lately in terms of testing different build combinations to make sure things work as expected.  I need to create a solid suite of tests that test every build combination.  Quite a feat, but needs to be done :)\nEric\n. added this task for the next release.\n. Newer versions of Chrome broke older versions of Kinetic.  Are things working correctly for you now that you've updated to the latest KineticJS version?\n. OS?  Fill and DD work for me on Mac OSX\n. In my experience, 64 bit windows 7 is very buggy in general.  I'll look into this as soon as I can though\n. Umesh, did you verify if drag and drop is working on the tutorials:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-an-image-tutorial/\nif so, then it's likely an issue with your code\n. Umesh, also, it's nearly impossible for circles to be rendered as rectangles.  Very likely it's an issue with your code\n. to be clear, are these problems only happening on Windows 7 64bit Chrome?\n. The latest versions of Chrome have been very buggy in regards to HTML5 canvas.  It's not a KineticJS issue.  I did however make some adustments to help with a circle fill issue in Chrome 27, which is part of v4.5.4 released last night.  Try out that version to see if it helps your case.\n. surely you don't mean \"any parameter\".  x?  y?  offsetX?  offsetY? width? height? etc\n. I've tested several tweens in Firefox with starting numeric values of 0, and they all work fine.  Could you please create a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?  Thanks!\n. The API changed.  please see the changelog:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nAnd the updated tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-label-tutorial/\n. This is a bug with early versions of Android.  \nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/114-canvasclearrect-bug-in-android-stock-browser/\nThe workaround is to define your stage and layer, but then add the layer to the stage after a timeout (I've used 50ms with success)\n. no, you have to create the layer, and THEN draw with a timeout, or else the timeout won't do any good.  The bug with Android is that the first thing that's drawn onto the canvas is stuck there forever, and can't be cleared.  So, if you create a layer, and add it to the stage with no shapes in it, then canvas in the layer will render with nothing in it.  Subsequent draws will be clearable. \nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage(conf);\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\nstage.add(layer);\nsetTimeout(function(){\n  // add shapes to the layer and then do layer.draw()\n}, 50);\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/test/unit/DragAndDrop-test.js#L17\n. what do you mean by \"too many global variables\"?  They aren't actually global.  They are scoped to the anonymous function wrapping the module.\n. gotchya, that's what I thought you meant.  I'll clean up the JS Hint errors by v4.5.3 :)\n. thanks!  After adding a jshint task to the build, I discovered quite a few of those.  All fixed up now\n. Thanks for doing this!  I'll take a look soon.\n. Thank you for looking into this!  The _setTextLine method has been refactored quite a bit, and getWidth() now appears to be working as expected for wrapped text.  Please reopen this pull request if the latest version of KineticJS doesn't handle getWidth() correctly.\nThanks!!\n. setX and setY works fine for text objects.  Can you create a simple jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?\nremember that x and y of the text is relative to its container, the group.  Therefore, if the group is positioned, it will affect the origin of the text.  If you want to override this behavior, you can set the absolute position via setAbsolutePosition().  Close this for now, but please reopen after you've put together a jsfiddle.\n. this was a bug with a recent release of Google Chrome.  The issue has been resolved in newer versions of KineticJS.    If you upgrade to v4.6.0, drag and drop in Chrome will work as expected.\n. that is correct.  It hasn't been implemented yet.\n. sorry guys, I'm hoping to get this added in by the next version, v4.7.3\n. Thanks for this!  It turns out, however, that you should not be calling applyFilter.  It's handled automatically inside draw() for caching reasons.  I need to put a couple of underscores in front of it to designate it as a private method.\n. yep, I have plans to eventually create an Arrow plugin, unless someone from the community creates one first :)\n. example in the docs here:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Circle.html\nwill create a tutorial on it as well soon\n. Thanks for doing this!  Sorry it took me so long (infinitely busy these days)\n. will look at this as soon as I get another Android device :)\n. I was able to replicate this - I'm shocked that more people weren't complaining about this.  Looking into it.\n. Which version of android?  This appears to be an Android bug.  Stuff drawn on the canvas element isn't able to be cleared after the first draw:\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/114-canvasclearrect-bug-in-android-stock-browser/\n. okay, the work around here (for Android 4.1.1 and 4.1.2) is to not immediately draw onto the canvas.  set a small timeout (50ms works for me) before adding layers to the stage.  I believe that this is no longer an issue with recent versions of Android.\n. I've actually never used Telerik MVC.  are there JS errors?  can you be a bit more descriptive when you say \"don't work any more\"? \nThanks!\n. precisely, I do have plans to auto toggle the listening property based on both user input (setters) and usage (on() method).  coming soon \n. update on this thread: For optimal performance, you may give the new FastLayers a try.  When you just want to draw stuff as fast as possible, and you don't care about mouse interactions, node nesting, event pub/sub, etc, FastLayers are a really good choice.  You instantiate them like this:\nvar layer = new FastLayer();\nI think this is an even better solution than managing the overhead of checking for situations when creating a hit canvas is required.\nStill, there may be cases where you want some shapes to be listened to, and others not, and for some reason you need them all in the same layer.  In this case, the hit graph will still need to be generated for the shapes that need it, and Kinetic could auto toggle off listening for shapes that have no handlers bound to them.\n. yes, the majority of the jshint problems are coming from pull requests that I've taken in.  Haven't had time to clean those up yet. It's okay if jshint doesn't pass at the moment since there's a lot of things not passing today.\n. Just wanted to note that I haven't forgotten about this thread.  some other priorities are a bit more pressing, but I'll definitely get back to this.\n. sorry it took me awhile to get this.  I setup a jshintrc file and added it to the repo:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/1dec988c27b85b3de4000479930a77ff49a62b96\nI have quite a bit of work ahead to cleanup all the jshint errors, and then hook jshint into travis CI.  That will come in time.  In the meantime, having the jshintrc file in the repo at least defines the standard of coding that's expected, and it allows people (like you) to modify the jshintrc file to enforce or relax code quality.\nThanks again!\n. your jsfiddle is wrong.  the two2 function sets listening to false again, instead of true.\n. This should all be fixed up now.  I made several fixes to Android touch events + drag and drop this morning.\n. Thanks for looking into this!  I'm currently working on a change that will enable corner radius for all shapes, including label tags.  This will be released with v4.8.0.  This way, we don't have to implement corner radius logic in each shape separately.\nThank you!\n. its in the change log here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#452-may-21-2013\nyou want to use getType() or getClassName() instead.\n. that's odd.  I found that the chrome 27 bug was occurring when you draw an arc with a stroke, in which the angle difference between the start angle and end angle was exactly 360 degrees.  I found that if it was slightly off, like 359.9999999, Chrome 27 rendered the circles correctly.  This was the fix that I put in.  May have to revisit it again.\n. I'll look into this as soon as I get a chance.  A lot of people have been asking for this.  Stay tuned!\nEric\n. you're incorrect.  take a look at this line:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Animation.js#L200\nonly one animation loop is used for all animations. \n. Oh I see what you mean, you're referring to the FRAF exclusively.  okay thanks, I'll take a closer look at this :)\n. you should use the least amount of layers as possible, while grouping things together intelligently.  Things that aren't updated often should be placed into one layer, while things that are updated regularly, and with other shapes, should be grouped together in their own layers.  Typically, most KineticJS apps will use between 2 and 10 layers.\n. That is correct.  I ultimately decided to use an inheritance pattern that was dead fast, in exchange for less flexibiilty.  I have a todo item to revisit the inheritance mechanism to address some of these issues, and I'll take a close look at lavrton's solution as well :)\nThanks for this!!\n. by the way, forgot to mention that you can use the getClassName() to get the class name of any node.  you can also use getType() to get the type of node.\nI'm closing this ticket for now, but have added a link to it from my todo list when I get around to taking a look at the inheritance model again.  Thank you for this!\n. it's necessary - you shouldn't ever be manually putting things into the stage container.  Just overlay the stage container on top of your image.\n. yes, Chrome 27 is very very buggy in regards to html5 canvas.  So far it doesn't appear to be KineticJS related.  staty tuned on this.\n. I made several fixes to Android touch events + drag and drop this morning, so we should be good.  Please reopen this ticket if there are still issues.\n. This was done intentionally in order to create smooth drag and drop operations.  If we were to continually stop and restart the animation, you would notice a slight lag each time you moved the mouse.  Closing this for now, but I'll put more thought into it.\n. yep, KineticJS ignores the anti-aliased pixels.  If you're drawing a 1px diagonal line, and you want it to be detectable, you need to create a custom hit function to define the hit region.  You probably will want to create a hit region that's a line which is about 5px thick or so.  Here's an example on creating custom hit regions:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-custom-hit-function-tutorial/\n. hi there, actually, KineticJS mimics native JS events and jQuery events exactly.  What you want is the \"mouseenter\" and \"mouseleave\" events, which KineticJS supports.  For more info about the difference, just do an online search for mouseover vs. mouseenter\n. it's a problem with your code.  1 out of 5 times, your randomized color index is out of bounds and returns undefined.  you need to use (len - 1) instead of len.  Updated it here http://jsfiddle.net/HCV8b/59/\n. can you create a jsfiddle showing the problem?  my unit tests are passing for id selectors\n. nice!  makes sense.  I'll pull this in soon.\n. Thanks again Gabriel.  I had to make some changes to the logic, because it turns out that we do also need preventDefault() for certain desktop browsers because the drag and drop operation triggers a drag and drop of the whole canvas element for the html5 drag and drop API which has undesired effects.  I couldn't merge in this pull request due to the extensive changes, but I still gave you credit in the change log.  Thanks!\n. ah, yes, this has been resolved.  There were some antialias issuese with the event detection awhile back but they were resolved with this block of code:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Layer.js#L14\n. when clicking on a circle, move it to its own layer first.  i.e. you need to create a layer specfiically for animations, such as animLayer = new Kinetic.Layer();  Also, windows phones will generally be a bit slower than apple or Android\n. This is very cool!  I'll look closer into this soon.\n. Hi again!  I was just looking at this pull request again - what do you think about creating a new distortion transformation that all nodes can use, not just images?  Currently KineticJS supports translate, rotate, scale, and skew.  We could do something like this:\nvar circle = new Kinetic.Circle({\n  radius: 5,\n  fill: 'red',\n  distortion: [0, 0, 10, 50, 10, 100, 0, 10]\n});\nWhat doyou think?\n. I'll take a crack at integrating the distortion transform into Node sometime this weekend and I'll let you know what I find.  Stay tuned!\n. Thanks for this!  I'm going to tweak it a little bit such that selectors are separated by commas to mirror CSS selector rules.\n. hey gaddie, it looks like the change broke the unit tests.  There were several problems with the logic that was introduced.  I fixed them up, and cleaned up the get method even further:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e6a9324d50c98c97292b062131f984729792dc35\n. no worries!  Thanks again for getting this rolling\n. +1\n. you need to redraw the layer with layer.draw()\n. for performance reasons, I chose not to auto redraw the hitgraph, for the same reasons that I do not redraw the scene graph whenever you update node properties.  to redraw the hitgraph, you should be able to do the following:\nlayer.drawHit()\nlet me know if this doesn't work for you\n. currently no, you need to do something like this:\nlayer.add(child);\nchild.setZIndex(5);\n. +1 Jason Follas made some changes awhile back that addressed this issue.  Should be fixed.  Please reopen if it's still an issue.\n. don't add layers inside layers.  you need to add groups inside layers.\n. Thank you for doing this!  Looking at this right now.\n. At a quick glance, these look like great changes!  I've been meaning to add color / convolution filters.  I'll go ahead and pull this in and play around with it and let you know what I find.\nAs a site note, KineticJS is starting to get a bit filter heavy, so I probably need to create separate builds just for the filters.  Stay tuned on that one.\n. nice work!  The filters look great.\n. you should update the Filter files with the @author tag for credits\n. Hi again, I was looking more into your code and you've done some really awesome work!  A few questions / comments:\n1) did you notice that the convolve related filters create a black border around the image?\n2) is there a difference between your Lighten / Darken and the currently existing Brighten filter?  Brighten can take positive values to brighten the image, and negative values to darken it\n3) You've put a lot of filters inside the same file, because they all use the same functions, but with different params.  Perhaps we should change Convolution to ConvolutePack, to indicate that the file includes multiple filters.  Same comment for the Colors filter. Maybe it could be ColorizePack.  This will be helpful when people create custom builds: http://kineticjs.com/configurator.php.  On the topic of naming conventions, you'll notice that all of the currently existing filters are verbs for consistency.  Can we do the same for yours?\n4) Another neat thing about filters is that they are tweenable.  Here's an example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-tween-blur-filter-with-kineticjs/.  This is only possible if the filter params are numbers.  Do you think its possible to create wrappers around your existing Filter functions to allow numeric parameters?  This way we could tween your filters, such as Emboss and Sharpen.  i.e. an emboss value of 0 could mean no Emboss, and a value of 100 could mean a lot of Emboss.\n5) is there a difference between your blurring functions, and the currently existing Blur filter?  Should the Blur filter be removed in favor of your filters?\nThanks again for your awesome work!  If you don't have time to work on these any further, no worries.  I'd still like to get your thoughts.\n. KineticJS handles this automatically if you use the Kinetic.Animation for your loop.  Everything hooks into the KineticJS animation engine, which means that layers are only redrawn once per frame, no matter how many animations are tied to a particular layer.\n. don't do that, it will trigger a redraw hundreds of times per second.  you need to use batchDraw().  I'll be releasing a new version soon with an improved version of batchDraw that performs much better than the current version.  It will be apart of v4.6.0.  Watch out for that.  When it's released, you should replace stage.draw() with stage.batchDraw();\n. absolutely.  stage.batchDraw() will be perfect for this case as well.  just keep checking for v4.5.5 to be released.  Should be released in the next couple of weeks.\nIn fact, you could technically always use stage.batchDraw(), unless it's absolutely necessary to redraw something immediately.\n. now that Kinetic supports batchDraw, closing this ticket.  Here's the tutorial:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-batch-draw/\n. Interesting, I'll add this to my todo list.  Thank you!\n. That's pretty interesting.  I've had several other requests that are similar to this one.  Perhaps any attribute could be set to a function.  I'll add this to my todo list.  My only concern is the possibility that it could impact performance when constantly checking if things are functions are not.  stay tuned.\n. can you provide a screenshot or jsfiddle?  KineticJS automatically handles pixel ratio adjustments by increasing the stage width and scale to create a sharp image.  Are you saying that the canvas appears to be twice as big as it should be, or just has a style that's set to twice the amount that you're expecting?\n. ah shoot, that's too bad.  The quick fix would be to disable the pixelRatio by just hard coding it to 1.  I'll look into creating a public way of setting or retrieving the current device pixel ratio.\n. Closing this ticket for now because I'm in the process of adding more docs to explain pixel ratio.\n. mobile events are working for me on this page:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-mobile-events/\nI'm using iOS.  What device are you using?  what code are you using?  jsfiddle demo?\n. you need to read through the change logs to see what changed, or go through the tutorials\nwww.kineticjs.com\n. can you create a simple jsfiddle showing the problem?  It will be easier to debug there.\n. great observation.  I'll take a look, as there are probably several solutions to this.\n. Thanks guys for bringing this up.  It will be addressed soon.\n. @hohmann that will definitely help, but may not be ideal, because it means that the first tween will render immediately, and the other tweens will have to wait for the next animation loop to start tweening.  This could result in the first tween jumping ahead at first.\n. no updates so far.  The fix will be in the next release, v4.7.3, which will be released sometime next month.\n. This is by design. the dragstart event should not be fired until the mousedown event has occurred, and the mouse has started to move.  It sounds like you should just be hooking into the mousedown event instead.\n. Thanks for looking into this!  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.  KineticJS v4.6.1 will resolve all of the pixel ratio issues\n. thank you!  this is the same fix that I came up with.  It turns out that I also did some refactoring for the clip() method so I couldn't pull in your request.  I'll still credit you in the change log though.\nThanks again!\n. Haven't forgotten about this, will take a look as soon as I get a chance.  This definitely needs to be addressed one way or another.\n. question: is it true that checking the 4 pixels around a pixel with an alpha < 255 is accurate?  I would think that it's possible that adjacent pixels could also have an alpha < 255 depending on the angle of the edge.  We could go to all 8 pixels, but I wonder if that's accurate as well.  I'll try to manually merge this in since it's been awhile. (sorry about that)\n. Okay, here's the deal.  I started reviewing my code for getIntersection, and I was horrified.  There's lots of bad stuff in there.  You are definitely on the right track, and I like your unit tests.  However, rather than merging in what you have, I've chosen to rewrite the getIntersection methods, and pull in some of your logic (I'll give you credit in the change logs).  Stay tuned!\n. fixed.  The algorithm now looks at the pixels around the pixel of interest if it's anti-aliased. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/aa78d632dbc89ace518890946dfc3947bcd74d89\n. Thank you so much for getting this started!  I'll add your name to the release schedule.\n. and this one: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/658064b5ef1d22a85b6fe7f507a0b6851a5cf216\n. node.id is a Kinetic generated id for each node that shouldn't really be useful for you.  Also, you should not use spaces for names and ids (think CSS selectors).  you can use \"-\" or \"\"\n. +1 support for this was added with v5.0.0.  I have yet to create a tutorial for it.\n. Here's a lab that uses an array of filters:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-animals-on-the-beach-game-with-kineticjs/\nOn mouseover, a brighten + blur filter is applied\n. +1 you can now cache any node, and apply filters to any node, including layers, groups, and shapes.  I believe this was introduced with v5.0.0\n. here's an updated filter example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-invert-image-tutorial/\nIn this tutorial, we're applying a filter to an image, but you can apply filters to anything.\n. exactly.  This is a constraint of the w3c spec for where strokes are positioned, so the rules are a bit different than Photoshop.\n. will do, as soon as I get a chance.\n. Thanks for looking into this.  And yes, these are some of the things that I've addressed with v4.6.0.\n1) yes, the getStage() method has to walk up the node tree everytime it's called.  I was considering adding this to the new caching system\n2) clear() is a bit expensive, as expected.  The cost of clearing can be reduced with the new clip feature that's being added in 4.6.0\n3) the _fireAndBubble method was being called hundreds of times per redraw because draw events were bubbling. draw events no longer bubble as of 4.6.0\n4) this is the getter method used for all attributes.  It only shows up in your results because it's called so often.  It's a fast method\n5) this is the getParent method.  Same as number 4, it's fast, just called often\n6) the visible attr has already been added to the new caching system.  Previously, it would crawl up the node tree to calculate visibility every time it was called.\n7) drawScene was further optimized with 4.6.0.  the _applyAncestorTransforms method is much faster, because I'm now double caching matrix transforms.  I'm caching the transform matrix at the node level, as well as the absolute transform matrix.  This has sped things up quite a bit.  This is also where the draw events were being fired, which was expensive in 4.5.5\n8) _applyAncestorTransform, as mentioned above, this is no longer an issue because the transforms are cached.  Here's what it looks like if you're interested:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L863\nThanks again for looking into these!  These findings validate all of the work that I've been working on this weekend.  So far, KineticJS is a little over 10% faster with all of these fixes.  The only one that I haven't addressed yet is number 1, but I'll do that before I release 4.6.6\nCheers,\nEric\n. Hi there!  Did you get my message about possibly joining the KineticJS team?  You've done some fantastic work with the filters, so we'd love to have you.\n. This is an interesting idea, although I'm not sure it would fit cleanly into the KineticJS node tree model.  I.e., it might be odd to set text properties on a stage or layer node.\n. I have a todo item for the next release (v4.6.0) to reinvestigate the text default logic, so I'll definitely keep this in mind when I get there.\n. this is the expected behavior.  if you want to scale the line and circle together, you need to scale its container (the layer).  You could also create a scaled group, and then add the shapes to that group. \nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer({\n  scale: 2\n});\n. Truly sorry for the headache.  This issue will be fixed by v4.6.1 or v4.6.2, depending on priorities.  Thanks for hanging in there!\n. good to know, thanks!  I'm planning on knocking out all of the device pixel ratio issues in the next release, v4.6.1.  Thanks for the heads up!\n. Interesting, this appears to be a bug with Firefox, which they've marked as WON'T FIX\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809788\nIt's not KineticJS specific, and there's not really a clean way to work around this.  The Firefox devs seem to be a bit stubborn about this issue.  I'm closing this for now, but will keep it in mind.\nBtw, the point of the pixel ratio adjustments is to ensure sharp drawings.  On devices with a pixel ratio != 1, the canvas drawings will appear blurry without the adjustments.  Overall, it's very good to have this in place, because it effects many mobile devices, tablets, iMacs, etc.\n. As a reference, there does appear to be a possible solution to obtain the  Firefox zoom level\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1713771/how-to-detect-page-zoom-level-in-all-modern-browsers\nBut it's extremely hacky, and may possibly have unwanted side effects.  If you really need this, you could try and detect when the zoom has changed:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6163174/detect-page-zoom-change-with-jquery-in-safari\nand then try out the above approach to get the zoom level, adjust the pixel ratio accordingly, and then recreate the layer canvases.\nIt's a lot of hoops to jump throug to work around a Firefox bug :(\n. Thanks!  Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ae66350d7f7c6d96653ef321c7a5ee833ed6d82e\n. I don't think this is an elegant solution.  As pointed out by the person asking the question, it would make sense to have a way to apply a transform to a node, such as shape.setTransform().  I'll add this to my todo list, thanks!\n. you were using ids incorrectly.  Like DOM, ids must be unique.  you were using an id=overlay for multiple shapes, so only the last id was accessible.  I changed the id to a name.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/7YJMv/\nAs a side note, you can also select nodes by type, such as Layer.get('Group'), or group.get('Rect').  This way, you don't have to add names to everything.  Also, you'll see improved performance if you use event delegation.  example here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-get-event-shape-with-kineticjs/\n. Thanks!  Each of the browsers handle dash arrays differently, so I probably just need to update the dash array logic.  That can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Canvas.js#L385\nI'll try to get this fixed up by the next version.\n. ah yes, IE9 and IE10 do not support line dashes, so KineticJS falls back to a solid stroke.  IE11, however, will support line dashes.  Safari currently does not support line dashes, although I believe they plan to with the webkitLineDash property.  It does not work as of today.  Here's the KineticJS code that handles the cross browser compat:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Context.js#L297\nSo long story short, as of today, dashed lines are only supported in Chrome and Firefox, and will be supported soon with IE11.\n. I'll have this setup for v5.0.1, coming out in a couple of weeks.  I need to auto update the bower package info with the grunt build.  Stay tuned on that.\n. done.  The bower json file generation has been hooked into the grunt build, and the kineticjs minified file has been added to root.  Let me know if this doesn't work for you guys.\n. there's actually not much desktop specific code at all.  You'll only find a little bit in Stage.js, about 100 lines.  compared to the 14,000 lines that makes up KineticJS, this is pretty insignificant. \n. actually I don't believe this is necessary.  Do you know of any articles discussing <!DOCTYPE> vs. <!DOCTYPE html>?\n. Closing this because the test suite has been rewritten.\n. ah.  Very interesting use case.  Do you think an array of box objects would work? i.e.\ngroup.setClip([\n  [0, 0, 100, 50],\n  [0, 50, 50, 100]\n]);\nI can add this functionality to an upcoming release.\n. I'm unable to replicate this.  I think there must be something else going on.  can you create a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?\n. scratch that, I am able to replicate the issue.  It only occurs if you have an offset.  I'll get this fixed up with v4.6.1.  Thanks!\n. precisely.  I ust wonder if we can hook into the native support for performance reasons.  I haven't had a chance to look into this one.\n. It turns out that this is a Chrome specific issue with HTML5 canvas.  It's not an issue with KineticJS, and I don't believe there's any way to correctly resolve the issue from KineticJS's end.\nFor the time being, the work around is to not use huge scale factors, but instead scale the position of each point that makes up the line.\n. Thank you!\n. yes, I need to add an attr blacklist to the clone method to make sure I don't clone the id.  This fix will probably make it ot the v4.7.1 release\n. Thanks everyone!\nGoogle Chrome clearly doesn't have any unit tests for canvas changes.  They break stuff every other release.\n. Google Chrome is notorious for releasing canvas bugs.  It seems like every release breaks something.  Let's give this a couple days to see if they resolve the issue.\n. This logic is already built into the getHeight() method.  Check it out here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Text.js#L167\nYou should always use getHeight to get the height of the text object because it does all of the calculations for you.\n. The confusion is my fault for not writing better docs for the method.  I'll fix this soon.\n. ah yes, great catch.  fixing now.\n. Sorry guys, this is fixed. It will be in the next release in about a week\n. you're overwriting the drawFunc with a method that doesn't use the canvas renderer methods, so you lose out on events.  You have two options:\n1) use the Kinetic.Path method and pass in SVG data like the path tutorial here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-path-tutorial/\n2) create a Kinetic.Image and set the image attr to your svg shape, and then use createImageHitRegion to create a hit region, like this tutorial\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-pixel-detection-with-kineticjs/\n. It should. If it does not, you could try scaling it with setScale()\n. Thank you!  I'll try this out as soon as I get a chance.\n. as per the documentation, functions are not serializable (security constraints).  You'll have to reapply the filters after you've deserialized the JSON.\n. Thanks Jason \n. very cool!  At some point soon, I plan on adding a gallery of extensions to the KineticJS website.  These extensions (plugins) should be hosted on individual github accounts, and KineticJS will link to them (along with user reviews).  So to answer your question, you should create a separate github project, with documentation about how to use your plugin.  \nThanks so much for putting this together!  I'll keep this ticket open until I've built the gallery page.\n. Good call. This will definitely get fixed, it's just a question of when\n. +1 yes this is a bug with Chrome and HTML5 Canvas.  Hopefully they resolve this soon.\n. By the way, the width of text varies from browser to browser.  You should be taking text.getWidth() into account for the next x calculation.  I believe this is what you're seeing.  Please reopen if this doesn't help.\n. Let me clarify a bit on what's happening.  Currently, when you drag and drop a shape, the hit graph is not redrawn on each animation frame to help improve drag performance.  As a result, shapes are temporarily undetectable. \nWhat you really need is true collision detection + dragover / dragout.  I have plans to support these, but haven't gotten around to it yet.\n. This is fixed with v5.0.0 which will be released this week.  Here's the changelog\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. just to clarify, this does appear to be related to TextPath specifically.  If you just use Text, everything works correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/BaTxP/\nYou mentioned that there may be missing restores, so I'll check out the TextPath draw func.  Also, you use layer.getContext().getTrace() if you want to see strict trace string, or layer.getContext().getTrace(true) for the relaxed trace string\n. fixed.  You were right Jason, somehow I deleted a restore() from the text path draw func.  Fixed it up, and added a test that uses the new nifty context trace :)\n. Hiya, there's three different topics in this ticket:\n1) Retina display: can you explain what you mean by \"works fine on non-retina, but not on Retina\"  What exactly is not working?  is the problem being caused by the JS error that you mentioned?  If there is a problem, it's probably related to pixel ratio calculations.  Retina displays typically have a pixel ratio of 2.  Try setting Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1 before you've instantiated any layers.  This will prevent pixel ratio calculations.\n2) \"Unable to create image hit region\" This warning is thrown if you've created an image hit region for an image that's not on the same domain as the code executing it.  In other words, your app needs to be running on a web server. It won't work locally.  This is a security constraint set by the w3c.\n3) the event.layerX error is probably related to a logic change that was made recently with the setMousePosition method.  We'll look into this.\n. I was thinking the same thing.  the current logic isn't sound anyways, because if evt.layerX is zero, we are still falling back to the _getContentPosition() block on line 580.  we should split the logic up into if else blocks, and also cache some of the variables.  I'll take a look real quick\n. it appears that this is a jQuery warning, not an error:\nhttps://drupal.org/node/1420984\nare you using jQuery on the page as well?\n. scratch that, it's just a Chrome warning.  There's a lot of jquery threads about this because people who are using jQuery are seeing this warning as well.\n. perhaps we should just check for the layerX case at the end of the ternary.  I'll keep looking.\n. @ellenm1 what device are you using?\n. @jfollas what do you think of this commit above?\n. @jfollas actually, I think we can remove evt.layerX/Y entirely.  FF appears to support evt.pageX/Y.  Check the commit above.  what do you think?\n. @jfollas okay what do you think of the above commit.  We are using UA detection now.\n. This should be fixed up now.  I resolved several pixel ratio issues.  They will be added to the 4.7.3 release going out this weekend.  Please reopen this ticket if your issues are still not resolved.\n. is this working now?  What was the issue?\n. greensock is really nice.  Definitely recommend checking it out.\n. KineticJS core will probably never support inertial scrolling.  This is more appropriate as a plugin (like the Greensock plugin)\n. you need to just use this.clear().  The clear() method is now in the Context class.  i.e. you can clear the canvas doing one of these:\nlayer.clear();\nor\nlayer.getCanvas().getContext().clear()\n. ahhh, I see what you mean.  This is a very, very bad bug!  Just fixed it up.  layer.clear() now also correctly clears the hit context, and I added unit tests to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThanks guys!\n. I'll release 4.7.1 sometime today or tomorrow with the fix.\n. replaced fill() with fillShape() in the hit draw function for Sprite.  This was a regression introduced with the major refactorings done for 4.7.0\n. Haven't been able to look into this yet, but one thing you can try is to force the pixel ratio to 1 like this:\nKinetic.pixelRatio = 1;\nand you'll need to do that before you instantiate any layers.  Devices with retina displays have a pixel ratio of 2, which means that KineticJS has to do a bit of extra work to sharpen the scene graph.  Setting it to 1 prevents all of this extra work from happening.\n. I can look into this when I get a chance (won't be for awhile though, unless someone else from the team gets a chance).  It's probably pixel ratio related.  As a work around, you can set Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1.  You can also use the Kinetic.UA object if you need browser or device dection.\n. Thanks for looking into this!  Not sure if I'm entirely sold on bringing in 200 lines of JS to fix a problem with iOS 6 and 7 for very large images.  I'll think on it\n. Let's do it.  Would you like to submit a pull request?  You can use Kinetic.UA to detect the user agent\n. this will make it to the next release, which will be later this month, or early December.  The suggested fixes in this thread are on the right track, if you need a quick fix.\n. nice work!  This is a very interesting idea.  Originally I was supporting user defined drawing functions which is very flexible, but requires a bit more work to setup.  It seemed like 99% of people who were interested in using clip functions just needed a rect, so I removed the user defined functions, and added the clipping bounding box.  This also makes it easy to transition.  At any rate, I'll keep this in mind, and I'll come back to this in the near future.\n. Closing this one for now.  I believe that if I decide to support custom clipping shapes in the future, it would be cool if it could hook into an actual arbitrary shape node (like a Star for example) so that the clipping function can be updated, animated, and tweened.  Thanks again for bringing this up!\n. that's odd.  I have an Android 4.1.1 Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and it seems to be working great.  what happens on your device?  Exactly which device do you have?\n. you need to use groups.\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-complex-shapes-using-groups-with-kineticjs/\n. hiya!  One thing that changed form 4.6.0 to 4.7.2 is the way that nodes are rendered who have both a fill and stroke, and an opacity or shadow.  Before 4.7.2, nodes with both a fill and stroke who also had an opacity or shadow were not rendered correctly due to the canvas spec.  I.e., if you have a shape with both a fill and stroke, and an opacity was applied to the shape, you could see the fill beneath the stroke, because the canvas applies opacities to both the stroke and fill.  v4.7.2 addresses this use case by rendering those shapes onto a buffer canvas, copying the result onto the scene canvas, and then applies an opacity to the whole shape.  This means that performance will suffer a bit for those use cases.\nDoes your application have any shapes with both a fill and stroke, and also has an opacity or shadow applied?  If so, you'll see much better performance if you remove one of these properties (stroke, opacity, or shadow).  If not, you could use toImage() to cache a shape as image so that it doesn't have to be redrawn.\nThoughts?\n. yes, Ill add a config option that enables \"lazy opacity and shadows\" to help boost performance, if the dev doesn't care about the stroke / fill problem with canvas.  This will be added to v4.7.3\n. 4.7.3 schedule: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. @villabolo that is correct.  in v4.7.3, I'll add a config option that improves performance but degrades the rendering quality if so desired (essentailly making things render as they did before 4.7.2)\n. i.e., I was thinking of adding a new strokeShadowEnabled=false, which means that the shadow is only applied to the filled portion of a shape, which improves performance (this is the way shadows worked automatically in v4.7.1 and earlier).  \nLikewise, I may add another attribute that reduces opacity rendering quality for shapes with both a stroke and fill to further improve performance (as it was before v4.7.2)\n. Later this month.   I released v4.7.3 early because there were a lot of pixel ratio issues that needed to be hot fixed.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. the answer to this one is pretty straightforward - you should never append DOM elements to containers that a library has created for you.  The kinetic-content element is for KineticJS elements only.  you need to do this instead:\n<div>\n  <div id=\"container\">\n    <!-- Kinetic adds stuff here -->\n  </div>\n  <!-- you can add more stuff here -->\n</div>\n. the hit context should not render shadows.  This is by design.  Can you be more specific as to how you are getting an error?  can you copy and paste the exact error you're getting?\n. clipping works correctly in v4.7.2 as far as I can tell.  can you create a jsfiddle that demonstrates the problem?  I suspect that there's something in your code causing the issue.\n. never mind, I was able to replicate the issue.  Clipping isn't working correctly when the container has shapes with shadows.  I'll get this fixed up by the next release.  Thanks!\n. the API slightly changed.  if you want to hook into a click event that's anywhere on the stage, you need to use:\nstage.on('contentClick', function(){...});\n. Thank you!\n. v 4.7.0 and 4.7.2 are working correctly for me.  What browser and device are you using?  can you be more specific than \"it bugs out\".\nAlso, try v 4.7.2.  There were some pixel ratio issues with 4.7.0, that may be causing you problems on a device with retina displayl\n. fixed!  This will be in the 4.7.3 release going out this weekend.\n. can you post the code on jsfiddle?\n. Are you using Firefox with the zoom != 100%?\n. I think you guys are misunderstanding mouseover, mouseout, vs mouseenter and mouseleave.  Do you guys have experience with those events when managing DOM?  KineitcJS matches DOM event behavior exactly (as well as jQuery).  I updated the jsfiddle to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/5eQDM/\nDo a search online for mouseenter and mouseleave and tell me what you think.\n. are you attaching mouseenter and mouseleave to the container node? i.e. a group or layer.  Attaching mouseenter or mouseleave directly on a shape will have the same result as mouseover or mouseout.\n. Thanks @kzhdev I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.  BTW thanks for looking into all these issues.\n. fixed!  https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/623\n. Yep this was the issue.  fixed + some refactoring with this commit: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/224436aa182a87a6f54a7eafd2f771d13ac7e119\nThis will be in v4.7.3 released this weekend.\n. Here, I created a JS fiddle for you and everything seems to be working correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/6KSbv/\nI suspect that there's something weird going on with your code to cause the error.  Try and see if you can update the jsfiddle to replicate your issue.  If you can, please reopen this.\n. a fixed request animation frame (FRAF) yields better performance for drag and drop.  Without it, the node that you're dragging and dropping will lag a bit behind the cursor.\n. It looks like you're running into a very slim edge case.  It looks like KineticJS is storing an invalid click start position because you're creating the rectangle on mousedown.  When the mouseup event is triggered, the error is thrown there.  As a work around for now (you should be doing this anyways for performance) you can add listening: false to the rectangle so that it's not detectable.  Here's the working fiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/JtZ8c/\n. Thanks @pdille I was able to repro this as well.  I was thinking of the same fix that you've proposed.  This should make it to the next release.\n. done!  Thanks guys for your patience.  I have a crazy todo list for v5.0.0 coming out soon, so I've been neglecting the issue list temporarily :P\n. It sounds like we need to create a remove() extender for Images to make sure filter stuff is cleaned up.  Similarly to the Layer extender here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Layer.js#L202\n. yes, this is a known issue that will be addressed with the next release (v4.3.3).  Thanks!\n. I suppose this could be added in an as enhancements.  It would be a bit of a lower priority compared to the other issues, to it might take a few versions to get it in.\n. Thanks for fixing this Andrew!\n. At some point I need to hook jshint into the build & Travis CI\n. This isn't a bug with KineticJS.  The lab that you're referring to is just that, a lab.  It wasn't built to support that use case.  The lab code needs to change (if your requirement is added in), not KineticJS\n. Can you put together a simple jsfiddle that demonstrates the problem?  My guess is that we are making assumptions based on how the lab is coded\n. I'm not sure you know what I meant - the purpose of creating a JS fiddle is to creating the simplest possible example that demonstrates a problem.  I created this fiddle for us:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/MBQxm/\nIt's a simple group that contains two shapes.  If you uncomment the commented out line, the group is correctly offset, and the shapes are in the correct location.  You proposed that changing the offset of a group affects its children position, which isn't true for this jsfiddle.  Am I missing something?\n. thanks @ippo615 !\n. @kzhdev I agree with you that the docs aren't perfect.  Doing my best to continually improve them :)\n. I believe the issue is that we do not need to force the pixelRatio to be 1, and should instead allow the computed pixel ratio to take affect (this happens in the canvas constructor).  i.e., rather than setting pixelRatio=2 for your case, we just need to delete that line entirely.  I'll do some testing and check in the fix if it works.\n. This is fixed up now.  Thanks for taking a look!\n. You need to upgrade to v4.7.4.  Pixel ratio issues were addressed in v4.7.3\n. Closing this for now. Please reopen if v4.7.4 does not resolve the issue\n. +1 this is not a bug, you should not be modifying the transform object directly because you bypass the caching system.  use move(), setX(), setY(), setPosition(), or setAbsolutePosition()\n. Interesting, I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance\n. you cannot run start() until the shape is added to the group, the group is added to a layer, and the layer is added to the stage.  Please reopen this ticket with a code snippet if this doesn't solve your problem.\n. I'll take a look at this when I can.  The right way to go is to to do something like this in Kinetic.Image:\nif (Kinetic.UA.browser === 'ios') {\n  // override some methods\n}\nthis way the logic is only executed once, when KineticJS is first setup\n. Thanks, I'll look at this again this week.  Stay tuned.\n. Hiya, yes, with v5.0.0.  Here's the release schedule:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. I'm still in the process of wrapping up the new documentation for all of the API changes in v5.0.0.  It's the biggest release in KineticJS's history.  Since this seems like a pretty burning issue, I'll still try to get this fix in before I release.  I plan to build a beta release and start doing integration testing with Html5CanvasTutorials by the end of this week.  If things go smoothly, v5.0.0 should be released during the weekend, maybe sooner.\n. v5.0.0 was too big of a release, so I had to cut out a lot of things that I was planning on putting in (including a fix for this ticket).\nI'm planning on taking a week off and letting v5.0.0 stew a bit more to see if there are any issues (there's already one that I just fixed).  I'll release v5.0.1 the following week (end of January) which will be a small patch that only contains high priority bug fixes.  Here's the revised release schedule so far:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\nStay tuned!\n. Haven't forgotten about this thread.  I spent a few minutes looking into this, and it's pretty clear that this change could have a lot of side effects.  I feel that it's a fairly high risk change, which means that I need to spend a solid couple of nights reverse engineering stomita's library, and making sure that it doesn't cause side effects with pixel ratio adjustments, event handling, caching, data urls, the toImage method, filters, image size getters, etc.  \nIn the past, these types of hacky work arounds for a bug with a specific device, browser, or OS often times aren't worth the effort because they eventually get fixed.  However, there's a lot of people on this thread that clearly need a fix, so I will continue to investigate.\nI don't want this to hold back the 5.0.1 patch, which fixes a lot of issues that affects everyone.  So, unfortunately I'll have to push this fix to 5.0.2 and I will get to it asap. \nFor those of you that need a fix now, the changes in this pull request look like they are in the right direction.  I'd suggest forking the KineticJS repo and trying to pull the changes in, and see if it fixes your issues.  Even if it does cause side effects, you might not notice them depending on the features of KineticJS that you're using. \n. Thanks!  This is a known issue.  Will hopefully be fixed up soon.\n. * copied from above *\nnever mind, I created a JS fiddle which shows that this is working correctly:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/X9U4H/\nI created a custom class, instantiated it, cloned it, and ran a method on the clone. It's working as expected.\nPlease reopen this ticket if you feel that this is still an issue.\n. no problemo!\n. agreed, this is something that I've been needed to work on, but it's been de-prioritized.  Would you like to give it a shot?\n. The challenging part is that the defaults are stored inside each getter method.  In order for the toObject method to know about these defaults, we'd have to pull all of them out into some kind of default map that getters can access, and toObject() can access. (not a walk in the park)\n. very smart!  I like that approach\n. can you submit a pull request with this change?  I think this is a great solution.\n. nicely done!!!\n. Thanks for looking into this!  It turns out that I will soon be deprecating the beforeFrame func, and I'll also remove the function deletion behavior.  Soon, you'll be able to do this:\nsprite.on('frameChange', function(evt) {\n  if (evt.frame === 2) {\n    // do whatever you want\n  }\n});\nThis will be much more flexible, and consistent with other event bindings.\n. Done!  You need to use this instead:\nsprite.on('indexChange', function(evt) {\n  var oldVal = evt.oldVal;\n  var newVal = evt.newVal;\n});\nThis is available today, and is much more flexibile than afterFrame().  afterFrame has now been removed.\n. Class.extend has been deprecated.  Please use Kinetic.Util.extend instead.  Here's an example class that extends the Shape class:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Circle.js\n. +1 v3.x was using a very slow class extender.  It has since been replaced with Kinetic.Util.extend.  Please take a look at some sample shape classes for examples:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Circle.js\n. Actually, this is a legit issue:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/qPWja/\nneed to call getTextWidth()\n. right.  if you set the width and height property, you're essentially defining a bounding box that the text must fit inside (like a max width and height).  It's not called maxWidth and maxHeight, though, for consistency.  getTextWidth() returns the width of the longest text string in a multi line string.  getWidth() returns the width set by the user, or the calculated width which takes into account padding. \n. cool app!\nCurrently I do not intend to support the capturing phase.  Your use case could be easily handled by listening for an event on a Kinetic Node, and then attaching an event handler that traverses the children and does something with each, like this:\nnode.getChildren().each(function(child) {\n  // do something with each child, or traverse downwards further\n});\n. Thanks!  I squeaked this one into 4.7.4 because I had to release a hotfix.\n. how odd, I'll fix this and release v4.7.4 this weekend if there's an issue.  Strangely, I have several unit tests that cover touch events which are passing.  Stay tuned.\n. figured it out.  It turns out that KineticJS techincially has had this bug all along, but it never surfaced until the _setPointerPosition() method was refactored in v4.7.3.  The problem was that I was assuming that the touchend event returns a touches array from the event obect which contains one touch element, which contains the touch position.  This is incorrect.  After the refactor, since the touches array length is zero for the touchend event, the x and y coordinates were being defaulted to 0, which does not intersect your shape (unless your shape intersects 0,0) and therefore doesn't execute the touchend event.\nI'm adding some tests around this use case and will psh out v4.7.4 shortly.\nThanks!\n. v4.7.4 is now available on kineticjs.com.\nThanks again!\n. this would be a great stackoverflow question.  Can you repost this there?  Github issues are for bugz\n. btw, I think you're looking for drag bounds: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-bounds-tutorial-with-kineticjs/\n. Try updating to the latest version and see if it's still an issue.\n. Thank you for this!  This is quite involved, so I'll need to look closely as soon as I get a chance.  Stay tuned.\n. This is actually a bug with chrome - it doesn't apply shadows correctly to elements copied from a buffer canvas (while all other browsers do).  The next version of kinetic will offer some options to get around this, but ultimately it's an issue with Chrome.\n. 4.7.2 includes logic to essentially fix a bug with the w3c spec in regards to shadows.  If you draw a shape that has both a stroke and fill, and you apply a shadow, the shadow is applied to the stroke and fill separately.  For this case, 4.7.2 draws the shape onto a buffer canvas, copies the result onto the visible canvas, and then applies a shadow.  While this produces the correct result, it's slower than drawing directly onto the scene canvas.\nTo remedy this, 4.7.4 will offer a config option to lazily render shadows, such that the result isn't quite correct, but it's performant.\nHere is the logic that determines if a buffer canvas is needed:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Shape.js#L221\nIn the meantime, if you avoid this condition, you can avoid using the buffer canvas copy.  You can also get around this by caching your shapes with toImage().  \nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\n. Way cool!  I'll take a look as soon as I can\nEric\nSent from my iPad\nOn Nov 6, 2013, at 9:41 PM, Anton Lavrenov notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHello.

Thank you guys for looking into this. I'll have a patch for this soon. Chrome seems to break canvas functionality on a pretty regular basis. I guess they don't do any testing before releases\n. sorry guys, haven't been able to look into this yet.  I'm planning on taking a look tomorrow.  Sorry for the delay!\n. unfortunately, I can confirm that Google Chrome is the buggiest browser out there in regards to HTML5 Canvas.  They seem to break things with every release.  Even simple things like drawing circles!\n. +1\n. thank you!\n. You're correct, assuming that there are no other animations running alongside the sprites.  For cases when you are running other animations, tweens, or dragging and dropping stuff, while sprites are animating, you don't want to only refresh a layer when a sprite is updated.  Also, for people who are using Sprites with different frame rates, the layer redraw rate is no longer constant.\nEssentially, you have a special use case, in which the only thing driving layer redraws are sprite animations, and each of your sprites have the same frame rate.  What I need to do, is to add logic that detects this condition, and then redraws layers only when the sprites update.  The moment that another animation or tween is detected on the same layer, Kinetic would have to switch to the current model.  I'll add this to my todo list, thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. I'm not sure if I ever tested stage cloning.  I'll add this to my todo list, thanks!\n. Yikes that looks pretty awful.  I'll try and take a look tonight or tomorrow to see what's going on.\n. I am SO glad you brought this up.  Thank you!\nSo first off, I do have some perf tests in place, but they don't benchmark performance for really old versions of Kinetic (v3.6.2 is ancient).  So I haven't seen the extreme perf difference.  You are right, newer versions of Kinetic are about 2-4x slower than 3.6.2.  Believe it or not, v4.7.4 is a bit faster than 3.6.2 if it weren't for a few features.  On my system, your 3.6.2 test was running at about 36fps, and the 4.7.4 was running at 8fps.  Here's a breakdown of new features that are causing the perf issue:\n1) each layer redraw actually draws the shape on two canvases, a scene canvas and a hit canvas.  This enables nearly instantaneous event detection.  Event detection was extremely slow in versions prior to 4.0.  However, this can be disabled by setting listening = false for each shape, or at the stage level.  This brought the fps up to 14\n2) newer versions of Kinetic support grouping and node nesting, and therefore theres a bit of transformation matrix math that's needed for each redraw each time a transformation property is changed (i.e. position).  Disabling grouping gets us up to 22fps (this is not yet a feature built into KineticJS)\n3) newer versions of KineticJS support event pub/sub, which means that you can hook into attr changes.  Each time an attribute changes, a before and after event is emitted.  disabling these events gets us up to 24 fps (not yet a feature in KineticJS)\n4) setPosition() is a lot more flexible now.  you can do setPosition(x, y), setPosition([x, y]), setPosition({x: y}), and even setPosition(n) which sets both x and y.  While convenient, this incurs a per overhead.  Disabling this features saves another 2fps and gets usu up to 26fps\n5) Now for the big perf problem.  Newer versions of KineticJS support all kinds of different stroke and fill styling options which older versions of Kinetic would drool over.  This logic is handled in the _fill and _stroke methods here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Context.js#L492\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Context.js#L526\nnone of these options were available with v3.6.2.  if youw anted to swap out or change stroke and fill styles, you'd have to do so in your custom draw function.  This means that the developer would have to do a lot more work.  Disabling _fill and _stroke, and just filling the rectangle directly saves us a whopping 13fps, which gets us up to 39fps\nso, technically you can bypass stroke and fill by doing something like this:\nreturn new Kinetic.Shape({\n        drawFunc: function(context) {\n          var _context = context._context;\n          _context.beginPath();\n          _context.rect(0, 0, 10, 10);\n          _context.closePath();\n          _context.fillStyle = 'red';\n          _context.fill();\n        },\n        listening: false\n      });\nyou can access the raw context of the KineticJS context with _context.  So, if you don't want the convenience of all the styling options with 4.7.4, you can draw your stuff manually with native canvas methods\nSummary:\nyou've already avoided the fillStrokeShape(this) method in your tests, so you can gain another perf improvement by setting listening: false on the stage.  This should get you another 6fps.  This is soemthing that I've been meaning to do automatically.  When there's no events bound to an element, it should automatically not be listening.  I'll make this chagne soon\nThe transformation matrix logic is heavy.  That killed 8fps.  I might consider giving developers the option to disable node nesting and bypass the transformation matrix logic entirely.  This would be a huge effort, but might be worth it\nDisabling automatic event firing will get us another 2fps.  I may need to introduce a mode where you have to explicitly subscribe to events.  This would be a lower ROI effort so it might be awhile before I get to this one.\nFinally, the overloaded functions, and automatic conversion of different arguments with setPosition (and other methods) reduces our fps by about 2.  While convenient, maybe it's not totally necessary.  I might remove this entirely and just force people to use a certain format.\nLooks like I have a lot of work in store :P\n. uncommenting context.fillStyle just means that the html5 canvas context is doing more work because it's setting the fill style over and over (which is needed if you want colored rectangles)  This isn't a side effect of KineticJS, it's just plain old canvas.\nfor now, the easiest way to get a perf boost is to set listening=false on each shape.\nP.S. this ticket has inspired me to release v5.0.0.  I'm currently working on addressing each of the issues mentioned in our discussion.\nStay tuned\n. v5.0.0 is now more than 2x faster than v4.7.4, and is even faster than v3.6.2.\nCheck the change log for some of those changes:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Release-Schedule\n. I haven't updated the performance tutorials yet, but you can get huge perf boosts by..\n- setting transformsEnabled = 'position' on the shape\n- setting hitGraphEnabled = false\n- caching where possible\n. Just so happens I'm planning on doing something very similar for v4.8.0 :)\n. +1 yep, I added the new cache() method as requested :P\n. I'll have to look into this.  Each layer has its own canvas.  after creating a layer, you could try setting the canvas with layer.getCanvas()._canvas = yourCanvas.  the \"_canvas\" property points to a native canvas element.\n. Cool!  Thank you!  I'll probably rename this to Arc, though.\n. You rock!  Thanks again for the high quality pull requests.  I've been meaning to add a ring shape but hadn't gotten to it yet.\nThank you!!\n. This is awesome!  However, this is more appropriate as a 3rd party plugin.  KineticJS is made up of:\n1) core shapes\n2) KineticJS managed plugins\n3) 3rd party plugins\nA cross hair would fit much better as a 3rd party plugin.  Would it be possible for you to create a github repo for this, and I can link to it from KineticJS?  I will be putting together a plugin gallery soon.\nThanks!\n. this is technically a bug with chrome.  The w3c spec for shadows is very wonky.  If you create a shape with both a fill and stroke, and you apply a shadow, you'll get a double shadow.  KineticJS fixes this bug in the spec by creating a temporary buffer canvas.  Google chrome, unfortunately, doesn't apply the shadow blur correctly to things drawn onto a buffer canvas.  This only occurs if your shape has both a fill and stroke.  I'll have a work around for chrome in v5.0.2\n. You can do this:\nshape.setFill('rgba(255, 100, 113, 0.5');\nYou also have access to the RGB components directly.  Here are a few examples:\nshape.setFillRGB({\n  r: 255,\n  g: 12,\n  b: 100\n});\nshape.setFillR(255);\nshape.setStrokeG(114);\nHere's the shape docs:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Shape.html\nIn version 5.0.0, or 5.0.1, I plan on adding support for alpha as well.\n. it's impossible to serialize a JavaScript function, as mentioned in the docs and tutorials.  You have to reset images and functions after deserializing a JSON string.\nyou can set the dragBoundFunc like this:\nnode.dragBoundFunc(...);\nDocs are here:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Node.html#dragBoundFunc\n. right, when I said 'impossible\" I really meant \"not logical\"  - you serialize data, not code.  Why not just serialize all of the JavaScript for your whole app?\nEric\n. wow!  Thank you for taking a look at these.  I'm planning on doing a 5.0.1 release in a couple of weeks, so I'll definitely include these.  I'll pull this in about a week\nThanks again!\n. Excellent work!  Thanks again so much for doing this.\n. I want to stay away from cascading because I think it will cause more problems than it solves.\nIf you take advantage of Kinetic.Collections, which is similar to jQuery, you can do:\ngroup.find('Image').each(function(node) {\n  node.width(9);\n});\nsoon, I plan to support this:\ngroup.find('Image').width(9);\nbut I haven't set that up yet.\n. Hi guys.  Believe it or not, there was alot of requests for this.  In order to lighten the KineticJS API, I wanted to support a single unit for all attrs.  This also greatly simplified lots of portions of the code base.  Most people seemed to want degrees for rotation.  I looked at a lot of people's code on stackoverflow and other places, and I saw a lot of people using rotateDeg() or rotationDeg().  It seemed natural to make the default unit in degrees to accommodate most people's use case.  \nThere have been many other threads with people unhappy with this change.  This is one of those topics where there is so much backlash that may have to go back and support both cases again :/\nI'll add this to our todo list, but it's a sucky change \n. Thanks @jfollas . And to re-iterate, I've heard loud and clear that a lot of people are upset about the radian to degree change.  But again, I think most people are frustrated by the change because it required lots of changes to their codebase, and not because it was necessarily a bad change.  I'm still keeping a close eye on this topic, don't worry.\n. @jfollas had a brilliant idea - we introduced a new config option that lets you choose which angle unit you'd like to use.  the default is degrees, but you can switch to radians if you like.  You can change to radians like this:\nKinetic.angleDeg = false;\nhere's the change: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5562f5dbbef8de248d2046131172c3c5a27cc70\n. agreed - this is something that's not fully quite worked out yet.  The idea is to have a transform option that ignores parent transforms for performance reasons.  I may need to introduce another option like:\nshape.ignoreParentTransforms();\nor something.  Stay tuned on that one.\n. update on this thread - the transformsEnabled property is now deprecated.  In v5.0.0, I was moving into a direction where devs have to configure lots of individual properties to tweak performance.  This doesn't scale.  In v5.1.0, you can now use fast layers, which render about 2x faster than normal layers.  All of the performance tweaks are done automatically.  You can create a fast layer like this:\nvar layer = new Kinetic.FastLayer();\n. v5.0.0 had several API changes.  please check the changelog, docs, and tutorials.\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. yep, check the change log:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log\nKinetic promoted to a new major version because there are a lot of API changes.  Please check the tutorials for updated examples:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/\n. that's incorrect - the docs say that the rotation should be in degrees:\nhttp://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Shape.html#fillPatternRotation\nThe tutorials on HCT are probably out of date though - I still need to get those updated.\nThanks!\n. This is now fixed via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5562f5dbbef8de248d2046131172c3c5a27cc70\nThanks for catching this!\n. shoot I thought this was handled.  I'll add this to the 5.0.1 release which is a patch coming out soon\nThanks!\n. 1) This is the expected behavior.  the Cache bounding box x,y is relative to the default position, which for the case of a circle, is the center point.  Take a look at the cache tutorial here:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-shape-caching-with-kineticjs/\nYou'll notice that you need to set the x,y position of the cache, along with the star offset.\n2) that's expected behavior.  the cache bounds that you set need to account for stroke width.  This can't be done automatically because of several stroke side effects such as line Join, and tensions.\n3) expected behavior\nThanks!\n. Thanks for looking into this!  I was hoping that this could be solved without adding pixel ratio logic to the Node class.  The Canvas class should contain all pixel ratio adjustments.  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.\nThanks!\n. I guys, just wanted to let you know that I've verified this is a problem.  It's a pixel ratio issue.  As a work around, before you create any stages or layers, you can set the pixel ratio to 1:\nKinetic.pixelRatio = 1;\n. This is fixed now:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/c2e138c6f4625a084c1e8d732e3f888ff968feda\nso here's the deal.  When users change the zoom level, it affects the pixel ratio, and causes artifacts on the canvas.  As of today, there does not appear to be a way to reliably detect user zoom levels with JavaScript for modern browsers.  There are a few libraries out there that are able to do it for older browsers, but not newer ones.  Therefore, for desktop browsers, I'll force the pixel ratio to 1.  For mobile experiences, the pixel ratio will be calculated and used to create crisper renderings on devices with a pixel ratio > 1.\nThis will be included with the next release.  Until then, just use Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1 as described above.\n. @nicolasloupias this is supported as of v4.7.0\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/wiki/Change-Log#wiki-470-sep-16-2013\nI would suggest biting the bullet and upgrading to v5.0.1 before you get too behind\n. The next release will be v5.0.2 or v5.1.0, depending if I introduce the new FastLayers or not.\n. I don't believe the zoom issue a problem for mobile.  Is that correct?\n. yikes, you're right.  I was planning on using an alternative to rgbToHex anyways.  I'll get this fixed up.\n. It's probably not optimized. Kinetic can run at nearly native speeds. Ill take a look soon. \n. Haven't forgotten about this thread - I need to put together a demo for you guys.\nBy default, KineticJS has a lot of stuff enabled that will slow down performance, like node nesting and event handling.  \"faster\" libraries probably don't handle these by default.  With Kinetic, however, you can disable these features to produce nearly native speeds.  I still need to get some more perf tutorials out there for you guys - just slammed with a million other things :P\n. First of all - awesome demo!  Do you mind if I repost this on HTML5 Canvas Tutorials?  I would just need your twitter handle, author bio, gravatar link for your image, and a link to your website if you have one.\nSecond of all - nice job, you did a pretty good job of fine turning performance.  The disableHitGraph is actually a layer property, but it doesn't matter in your case sense your using drawScene()\nAlso, on my macbook air, it was running at 30fps for 1000 bunnies.\nSomething else to watch for every soon - v5.02 will support something called a StaticLayer.  Static layers are like normal layers, except they don't handle node transforms or events.  For people who just want to draw a ton of stuff on the canvas and don't care about interactivity, StaticLayers will provide the fastest rendering performance possible.  \nI might go as far as to create a StaticStage, which has no layers either.  It would basically be the KineticJS api that draws directly onto a single canvas.\n. agreed - I'd like to keep the event support as minimal as possible, and users can use something like HammerJS if they want additional events.\n. yep this is a bug, and will be fixed with the 5.0.1 patch coming out in about a week or so. \nThanks!\n. scratch that, I forgot that it's already fixed in Github.  when 5.0.1 comes up, just upgrade and you should be good to go.  \nIf you need a quick fix, be sure to manually set your fillPatternScaleX and fillPatternScaleY values.  Otherwise they are defaulted to 0, which causes the shape to be invisible.\n. Thanks for this!  I'll take a look as soon as I get a chance.\n. can you please provide a jsfiddle example?\n. can you repost this on stackoverflow, with a jsfiddle?  for implementation questions, stack overflow is a much better forum than github.  Also, I noticed that you're passing arguments to the draw() method.  The draw method takes no arguments.\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L1465\n. hah, there's a typo here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Shape.js#L46\nthis line listens for shadow changes, and then clears the hasShadow cache when one occurs.  It's listening for shadowEnabledChanged instead of shadowEnabledChange :P\nI'll fix this up by the next version\n. scaling with a negative value works for me.  It's working in this tutorial as well:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-scale-animation-tutorial/\ncan you post a jsfiddle?  There's probably something else wrong.\n. Thanks for reporting this!  Your solution of getter.call(this, {attrs: {}}) doesn't quite work because you're calling the getter method from the \"this\" context, but passing the \"{attrs: {}}\" object as an argument, which will be ignored (getter methods don't require arguments)\nThe fix is to remove the attr from attrs, use getter.call(this) to extract the default value from the getter method, and then restore the attr.  I added a unit test as well.\nThank you!!!\n. nice @lavrton!\nCurrently, I don't have plans to archive old documentation.  This may change if enough people demand it :P\nHopefully (keeping fingers crossed) v5.x is the last big API change to the library.  It's now very close to my vision of what KineticJS should be, so I don't suspect it will change much from here on out.\n. +1 @kzhdev \n. Thank you!\n. currently, the plan is to keep all getters and setters.  This enables you to override specific getters and setters, and the overloaded methods will keep working.  The overloaded methods, like stroke(), in turn call setStroke() and getStroke()\n. in other words, the getters and setters are the source of truth, and the overloaded methods are just convenience methods.  However, I purposely took out the explicit getters and setters from the documentation in order to cut it down in half.  The docs were getting huge, and I want the API to be as simple as possible.\n. you need to use layer.draw() to redraw layers.  Here's an example:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-alpha-with-kineticjs/\n. I think circle.draw() used to in turn do a layer.draw for you, but I believe this was removed.\n. This was just fixed along with a new flag that lets devs choose if angles are in degrees or radians.  Thanks for catching this:\nchange: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5562f5dbbef8de248d2046131172c3c5a27cc70\n. Thanks!!\n. taking a quick look right now.\n. Can you give us more information about how your app works?  This isn't enough.\nHow many stages?  how many layers?  how many groups?  What kind of images?  How big are they?  Can they be put into a sprite image?\n. oh, the problem is when you're including your custom filter.  You currently can't just add it after you include the kineticjs file.  Filters must be defined after the Node class is defined, but before the Image class.\nThis is something that I need to fix or else other people will have the same headache.  I'll have a fix for this in the next version\n. for a work around, just use this instead:\nKinetic.Factory.addGetterSetter(Kinetic.Image, 'myFilterVal', 0, null, Kinetic.Factory.afterSetFilter);\nsince you are using an image, this will add the myFilterVal attribute directly to the Image class.\n. This should be fixed now.  please refer to this ticket for more info:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/753\n. Thanks @lavrton \nSorry for the confusion guys.  In an effort to simplify the KineticJS api, and improve performance, I removed support for Number and Array inputs.\n. Thank you guys!\n. Heya!\n1) you're right, looks like this missed\n2) it was done for performance reasons\n3) you're not the only one who dislikes the change - I'm considering changing it back\n. The performance cost of detecting the user input and converting very large arrays of points to another format is actually noticeably expensive when you're dealing thousands of data points that are updated several times per second :P\nThere are also lots of cases when you just want to change a single point inside the array of hundreds of points.  Since the input is guaranteed to be an array of integers, with no conversion, this gives people the opportunity to change a single point by reference, without resetting the entire array each time.\ni.e.\nvar points = []; // huge array of points\npolygon.setPoints(points);\npoints[9998] = 5;\npoints[9999] = 6;\npolygon._clearCache('points');\nlayer.draw();\nAlso, I wanted it to be easier to configure points, i.e.\nvar polygon = new Kinetic.Polygon({\n  points: [{\n    x: 1,\n    y: 2\n  },\n  {\n    x: 3,\n    y: 4\n  }]\n};\nvs.\nvar polygon = new Kinetic.Polygon({\n  points = [1,2,3,4];\n});\nor\nvar polygon = new Kinetic.Polygon({\n  points = [\n    // x, y\n    1,2,\n    3,4\n  ];\n});\nThis is one of those cases where I was trying to balance flexibility vs. performance.  I'm still open to changing it back, however, if more people speak up about this.  Let's give it a little more time.\n. Here's another idea - maybe this will be a win win situation.\nWhat if I provide array methods that enable you to modify the points array?  i.e.\npolygon.push(point);\npolygon.pop();\npolygon.shift();\npolygon.unshift(point);\npolygon.insert(point, position);\npolygon.remove(position);\npolygon.concat(arraOfPoints);\netc.\nThoughts?\n. you got it.\n. Common question. You need to use mouseenter and mouseleave events.  jquery does the same thing \n. +1 this is the expected behavior.  This is a typical pattern for libraries/frameworks - i.e. the framework should not modify the container element in anyway, or any other DOM elements outside of the container.  Everything inside the container, though, is fair game.  You need to move your content outside of the KineticJS container.\n. Hey @lavrton, can you explain what exactly is slow?  Are you just referring to drag and drop?  The event detection algo is actually much faster than other libraries.  It can detect shape intersections for millions of nodes on the screen.\n. Look into the hit graph and scene graphs.  When things are drawn with Kinetic, shapes are drawn on both a scene graph (what you see) and a  hit graph (used for event detection)\n. interesting, okay.  I don't believe the problem is getIntersection itself, but rather the frequency that it's called.  i.e., we can play around with throttling the getIntersection call on touchmove.  For that matter, maybe we should throttle all touchmove events, since we know they will be used with mobile devices.  Do you want to take a look at this?  Maybe we could create a throttle function and put it in Kinetic.Util (something similar to underscore's throttle, or maybe even the exact same one) and then hook it up with the touchmove fire event here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Stage.js#L539\n. no don't do that, you're essentially indirectly throttling the event detection.  If people are listening for the draggableChange event, they will get some very odd results\n. I'll take a look at throttling, and might hook it into the batchDraw function as well (which is technically doing throttling)\n. yea, I know you were doing it for testing purposes, but just wanted to make sure.\n. really cool jsfiddle demo btw!  Can I make a lab out of that (you would be the author)\n. no no, I like the comparison\n. here it is:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8fcd882ba5d2da288c846d9a76911729e7d56728\nSo I've been working on Android issues this morning, and made a lot of improvements.  I discovered that Android was listening for both touch and mouse events, which not only caused some weird issues from time to time, but also really hurt performance.  I added throttling to both mousemove and touchmove.  I think both of these should help with Android perf a lot.  Can you pull the latest changes and give it a try on your device?\n. for drag and drop, I wonder if we can avoid it entirely.  I think at one point I was, but I don't remember why I put it back in.  i.e., there's no reason to detect for events on other shapes when you're dragging and dropping.\n. Also, in your hack, you were essentially throttling down to 50ms.  My throttle is 17ms.  You could try changing 17 to 50.\n. Cool!  Thanks!\n. cool thank you!\n. +1\n. +1 Thanks @lavrton.  This is my fault, I didn't have any tutorials that covered the setAttr() method.  I'll revamp the KineticJS tutorials soon.\n. yes, odd, I'm not sure how this could be happening - each time the scene function is executed for the  Line class, it just loops through the points array and then closes the shape at the end:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Line.js#L75\nAs @ippo615  mentioned, a jsfiddle would be most helpful here.\n. Ah, I think it makes sense for opacity to affect cached shapes.  I'll fix this up.\n. can you repost this on stackoverflow?  This is an implementation question.  I would like for other people to see the answer.\n. stackoverflow.  It's linked to from the kineticjs homepage.\n. Can you try v5.0.2 or v5.1.0?  Those should be a bit better\n. ah yes.  Except, I don't like that we are tacking on the event type as a second argument.  It either needs to be added to the native event object as some other key (like eventType) or we need to split up the native event object from the Kinetic event object.  I'm favoring the latter at the moment.  Still thinking on this.\n. On second though, I think we should continue to reuse the native event object, but add a kinetic namespace to it.  I'll make that change soon\n. fixed. \n@lavrton using two arguments gets weird when you are trying to fire custom events with the fire() API.  \nKinetic will now pass around a Kinetic event object, which has a reference to the native event object, if it's needed.  i.e.\nevt = {\n  target: Kinetic.Circle,\n  type: 'tap',\n  evt: NativeEventObj\n};\n. @lavrton  can you take a look at the dispatchEvent that you added for HammerJS and let me know if it looks okay to you?\n. change: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/47ecb4559de2891c2687a42cd49eb0ce5ff209db\n. and here's a unit test that shows what the API looks like now:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/ddf34d0af9b84b217e1a4d9d4e8e43b932901b00\n. agreed this is a big API change.  Luckily, we are already releasing an API change version (5.1.0) so we can sneak it in.  I'll be sure to address this clearly in the change log under the API section.\n. Thanks!  Sounds logical.\n. Thanks @lavrton !  I'll be releasing v5.1.0 within about 3 or 4 days which will patch up any regression issues with v5.0.2\n. @lavrton what do you think?\n. yep!\nJust saw that and changed it.  https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/0800f1e31ab1848920b1733daa255930b7e9941e\n. Upgrade to v5.1.0, which was released yesterday - it fixes the drag and drop perf problem on Android.  Please reopen this ticket if there's still an issue.\n. oh shoot, I meant v5.0.2.  I'll look at this.\n. oh, for mobile devices, the pixel ratio is automatically taken into account.  To disable this adjustment, you can set Kinetic.pixelRatio = 1.  Let me know if this fixes the issue.\n. I'm pretty sure this is the issue so I'm going to go ahead and close this one while I'm here.  Please reopen if this doesn't help.\n. You should place it at the top of your app, before you create any stages or layers.  It's a global KineticJS config.  I'll look into this as well to see if I'm missing something.\n. Cool!  no problemo.  Rest assured that KineticJS will continue to get faster and faster :P\nEric\n. will do, sorry about that!\n. done.\n. Can you explain a bit more?  What exactly are you wanting to do?\n. Hiya!  This isn't a bug, it's an implementation question.  Can you repost this on stackoverflow.com?  That way, others can see the answer (plus you'll get more responses)\n. ",

    "jfollas": "The security exception being thrown by FF3.6 is due to the quality parameter - their implementation was before that parameter was introduced in the spec/recommendation.  \nI first thought of having cascading logic that takes out one parameter at a time, but thought that code may have been too messy for the limited audience that it would serve.  If interested, the code would have resembled:\njavascript\ntry {\n    // If this call fails (due to browser bug, like in Firefox 3.6),\n    // then revert to previous no-parameter image/png behavior\n    callback(bufferLayer.getCanvas().toDataURL(mimeType, quality));\n}\ncatch(exception)\n{\n    try {\n        callback(bufferLayer.getCanvas().toDataURL(mimeType)); // Try with just mimeType\n    }\n    catch(exception)\n    {\n        callback(bufferLayer.getCanvas().toDataURL()); // If all else fails, this is the original behavior\n    }\n}\n. May want to consider changing the name of the Kinetic.Path attr from \"command\" to \"data\" to match nomenclature used by SVG (i.e., their html syntax is <path d='M1,2...'>)\n. Looks like the elliptical arc curve is the only svg path command not implemented here yet.  \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands\n. Weird bug! \nIn a pinch, you could use a Path shape with two elliptical arcs (i.e., one for each half):\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/jfollas/tdar8/\nFor a ellipse with radius [20, 40] centered at 100,200, something like:\nvar ellipse3 = new Kinetic.Path({\n    x: 100,\n    y: 200,\n    fill: \"#777\",\n    stroke: \"black\",\n    data: \"m -20 0 a 20 40 0 1 0 40 0 a 20 40 0 0 0 -40 0 z\"\n});\n. Shape pack makes absolute sense.  No need to bloat the core API with functionality that most people won't need (and can easily be added by means of a 2nd script tag)\n. 1) Path and TextPath share the same core path parsing logic, so I was looking for a way to keep from duplicating all of that code.  The implementation tried to replicate how the other various shapes extended Shape (in this case, I was trying to extend a shape that already extends Shape), but since the draw logic is different, I needed a way to render the TextPath after path parsing took place.  \nThat being said, I recognize the need to refactor and simplify, so will look into it.\n2) The code bloat in Path is functionality that is needed by TextPath, but could also be used with Path if desired (things that the Canvas doesn't yet provide, like point-on-curve and path length).  With a cleaner separation of the two shapes (#1 above), these functions can be moved into TextPath itself, or externalized somehow (maybe similar to Tween), but TextPath does need them in order to calculate the location and rotation of each glyph.\n3) Sure!\n. Do you want to namespace things in the plugins folder?  Meaning, should they be named Kinetic.Plugins.Foo, or just Kinetic.Foo?\n. Ok, I added the empty Kinetic.Plugins object to Global (just like Kinetic.Filters).\n. I should have included this forum link where it was reported:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1042\n. Does anyone have a jsFiddle that demonstrates the issue?  I like to convert these into unit tests within the codebase.\n. In my testing, Firefox is the only browser that will respect the opacity when rendering a SVG as an image.  Chrome and Internet Explorer will render SVG-as-images to the Canvas, but ignore the globalAlpha setting on the Canvas context at the time that drawImage() is invoked.  I have not found bug reports yet to this effect, but have proven it with testing (i.e., set globalAlpha and then draw an image - any file type other than svg will have transparency).\nNote: A tip that I found to ensure that browsers can render SVG-as-images consistently is to ensure that the svg markup has width, height, and viewBox attributes all defined.  If any are missing, you'll have different behavior among the various browser versions.\nClosing because there doesn't appear to be anything that Kinetic itself can do since the behavior is at the native code level of the browser's canvas implementation.\n. Nice catch!\n. It's not just iOS. I've seen the same symptom at least with IE10 (Windows 8 apps). I always assumed it was a memory management issue/garbage collection/etc because it only became apparent after many animations.  Perhaps in my case, those types of issues lead to an inconsistent frame rate with requestAnimationFrame.\n. :) I just keep adding it back into my local version of Kinetic when my\nshapes stop responding to clicks. ;)\nOn Nov 15, 2012 2:55 PM, \"Eric Rowell\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nhaven't forgotten about this, will get to it asap :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/141#issuecomment-10422772.\n.

Integrating as a separate commit from this pull request\n. What's not working on Windows Phone 8?  Have you tried it recently with the latest version of Kinetic to see if enhancements made in the past 10 months have improved things?\n\nI am assuming that you're referring to opening a web page in IE10 on WP8, and not creating an HTML5 application.  I can say that I have tested Kinetic on WP8 with success (sometimes, just need tweaking, but that's primarily to the HTML, not the Kinetic/canvas code).\nAs for what @ericdrowell referred to, IE10 introduced the MSPointerEvent that brings mouse, touch, and pen events all into one single event.  This has since been committed to webkit and firefox as \"pointerevent\", so expect to use it everywhere in the future.\nThe nice thing, though, is if a MSPointerEvent is not handled, it elevates to a normal mouse event (so I don't even try to handle the new event in my Kinetic apps).\n. I closed it due to no response. Guessing that it's probably related to this (which is still open):\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/880\n. [Finally] added this fix to the codebase.  Thanks for researching the issue and providing the code!\n. Fixing this by rendering the text (glyphs) to the hit canvas.\n. CI doesn't like the changes I made to the test. Still getting familiar with the new test framework...\nEdit: Fixed the test, CI passes.\n. Since MSPointer events automatically elevate to Mouse events if they aren't handled, is this still a concern?  My Win8 apps have been working fine with the first touch elevating to a mouse event.\n. In IE10/11, you need to tell the browser that you will be handling touch events for a container (else, it will try to interpret touch as an action for the browser to perform, like panning or zooming, etc).\nIf you want to try it out, edit the Drag/Drop tutorial that you referenced to add a style to the container div (did you know that the code in those tutorials are in a live editor?):\nhtml\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"-ms-touch-action: none;\"></div>\nReference: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772044(v=vs.85).aspx\n. Do you have a jsFiddle or something that exhibits the issue so that I can take a look in IE9?\n. If this is still a problem with > 4.7.2, then reopen this issue.\n. Oh, are you trying to use the DataURI as the address of the web page?  (Sorry, haven't opened your example yet).  IE9 won't allow this, but you can create a img src=\"your data uri\" in the popup window.\nLook at how I handle a popup window here (code at bottom) as an example that works in IE9:\nhttps://github.com/jfollas/CanvasKineticDemo/blob/master/kineticDemos/6.1.toDataURL.htm\n. When you say \"SVG Image\", is that using Kinetic.Image to draw a picture onto the canvas (using svg as a source of that image), or is it using a SVG path in conjunction with the Kinetic.Path shape?  Do you have a jsFiddle that exhibits this issue so we can keep an eye on it (especially if an upcoming browser fix could positively affect the results)?\n. We can't do anything about #98 because it's native browser rendering issue.  Apparently,at the moment, only Firefox will respect the Canvas context's opacity setting when SVG is used as an image (Chrome and IE ignores opacity when it renders the SVG using drawImage(), while correctly rendering any other image format using the very same code).\nBy the same token, because it's native code in the browser that renders the image, I don't believe that we have control over anti-aliasing from Kinetic, which seems to be the cause of the issue that you are reporting here (\"jagged\" rendering).  I think we'll just need to wait for Firefox 24 as @fuzzley reported above.\n. I had to review the Path code, but I think I see the culprit.  At the end of drawing all of the vectors, it's doing a fill and stroke operation.  The fill part of that operation will close the path, which is giving it area between the endpoints of your curve - Kinetic is picking up this invisible area as being part of the shape.\nI can probably break up the fillStroke() into a separate fill and stroke operation, and only perform the fill operation if there's something to fill with.\nMaybe Eric will have another suggestion for handling stroke-only scenarios to prevent the inside of the shape from being detected by Kinetic.\n. Committed the fix.  If the shape's \"fill\" is not defined, then it will only Stroke() the path.\n. Wonder what the range of browser support is... \nSVG is neat because you can use it as the src of an img right in your HTML, so it doesn't surprise me that there are browsers that can render SVG onto a canvas (using context.drawImage), treating it as just another image format.\nKinetic's Path shape isn't intended to replace SVG, or even render SVG.  I created it just for reusing the terse Path syntax since Canvas didn't have an equivalent yet (the latest WhatWG spec shows a lot of SVG being brought into Canvas, including native Path support).  \nBefore Kinetic.Path, my alternative was a custom Shape with Canvas API commands to perform each operation that was represented within the SVG Path data (moveTo, lineTo, etc).\n. I've reproduced your code as a JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/KBnYM/\nThe problem with issues like this is that Kinetic has no control over how the browser handles rendering - Kinetic simply tells the browser what to do, and the browser performs the rendering of pixels to the screen using native code.  Firefox and Internet Explorer both correctly anti-alias your rotated image, but Chrome (at least the current version) does not when 2D acceleration is enabled.\nBut, if you were to \"Disable accelerated 2D canvas\" (from URL: chrome://flags/#disable-accelerated-2d-canvas), then Chrome's software renderer correctly anti-aliases the image on my machine.  This would suggest a bug with Chrome's accelerated 2D canvas implementation.  \nUnfortunately, I don't think there's anything that we can do in Kinetic to this handle bad behavior that exists only in versions of Chrome.\n. I believe these are Chromium bugs that may cover the bad behavior that you are seeing: \nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7508\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=82268\n. You have to click the \"Enable\" link to turn on the \"Disable accelerated 2D canvas\", and then click the Relaunch button at the bottom.  Not saying this is the recommended fix to solve your issue, but that this demonstrates that it's an issue with Chrome's 2D GPU accelerated canvas implementation.\nDefault:\n\n2D Accelerated Canvas Disabled:\n\n. I believe this is a bug in the current version of Chrome.

As Eric mentioned above, Kinetic attempts to correct an issue with a double-shadow being applied by utilizing a temporary canvas, and then copying the temporary canvas to the final canvas.  Chrome has had a bug for a long time now with \"using drawImage to copy from one canvas to another, when the source canvas had transparent areas\".  The Chromium bug at fault appears to be this one, if you want to track status or provide feedback to Chrome about their bug: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=100703\n\nOne possible workaround would be to bypass this buffering technique by overriding a helper function in Shape.js named _useBufferCanvas.  If this function returns false, then the \"old\" way will be used, which may result in the double shadow issue, depending on the browser and your shapes.\nYou can override on a per-shape basis as follows:\n``` javascript\nvar rect4 = new Kinetic.Rect({ ... });\nrect4._useBufferCanvas = function () {\n    return false;\n};\n```\nOr, another possible patch would be to override globally for a given type of shape (Rect, Circle, etc) with User Agent detection (include the following code before instantiating any shapes of the type that you specify as the first argument):\njavascript\nKinetic.Util.addMethods(Kinetic.Rect, {\n    _useBufferCanvas: function () {\n        if (Kinetic.UA.browser === 'chrome')\n            return false;\n        else\n            return (this.hasShadow() || this.getAbsoluteOpacity() !== 1) && this.hasFill() && this.hasStroke() && this.getStage();\n    }\n});\nThe point of mentioning these workarounds is that you can do this in your own application code without waiting for the next official release of Kinetic.\nSee this Fiddle for results: http://jsfiddle.net/ae3A4/1/\n. I can understand the frustration that comes from having an API change from underneath you, but it's not really fair to lay into Eric so hard about this.  He puts so much time into producing a free and open source library to make it easier to do cool things with the canvas, and doesn't deserve to be chastised over a decision that he made based on feedback that he received.\nInstead of going back to 4.5.5, it may be easier to just change your project's version of Kinetic 5.x to use radians, since Kinetic is fully open source.  This would have a benefit of your code not needing changed yet again when support for radian angles are restored.\nAfter a quick look through the code, there's only one line in node.js (1145, part of _getTransform) that would seem to be the culprit.  Remove the conversion from degrees to radians there, and you can then supply all of your rotations in radians.\nTest providing radian angle for rotation: http://jsfiddle.net/mjg6r/1/\nModified 5.0.1: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=WXaHyd1R\n. For the record: I'm still in favor of the old/separate .rotation (for\nradians) and .rotationDeg (for degrees), with one just being a convenience\nmethod to set the other.  Not sure what kind of impact this has on the\nbackend stuff, like tweens, etc...\nOn Mon, Mar 17, 2014 at 12:47 AM, Paul van Dinther <notifications@github.com\n\nwrote:\nNo, it is definitely a bad change.

You're looking for a bounding box function.

Kinetic doesn't actually draw every pixel of arcs and curves - it simply\ntells the browser \"I need this curve\", and native code in the browser\nrenders the pixels.  So, we don't actually know the x/y of the individual\npixels that are rendered without calculating them ourselves.\n\nBut, when I wrote the TextPath shape, I needed to find points along the\npath to know where to render glyphs.  So, some undocumented functions that\nmay be of assistance to you if you wanted to attempt to write your own\nbounding box algorithm using path traversal:\nKinetic.Path.getPointOnCubicBezier(pct, P1x, P1y, P2x, P2y, P3x, P3y, P4x,\nP4y)\nKinetic.Path.getPointOnQuadraticBezier(pct, P1x, P1y, P2x, P2y, P3x, P3y)\nKinetic.Path.getPointOnEllipticalArc(cx, cy, rx, ry, theta, psi)\nThese functions return a point object (i.e.,  { x: 123, y: 456} ).  You\nwould just need to traverse the curve by iterating the pct from 0 to 1.0\nusing some increment (i.e., 0.1 to get each point 10% along the path), and\ntrack the min/max over all of the parts of the path.  For arcs, you iterate\nthe theta property from the starting angle to the ending angle.\nA parsed version of the path string can be found in your instance's\nPath.dataArray.  Refer to the findSegmentToFitCharacter function within\nTextPath.prototype._setTextData for how to used the parsed data in\nconjunction with these functions.\nIf you're successful in implementing this, feel free to submit a pull\nrequest!\n-Jason\nOn Sun, Mar 2, 2014 at 10:18 PM, wiregrasscoder notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nThanks jfollas.

You'll probably want to use offsetX and offsetY instead of offset (which takes an object now with x and y properties). And, while it doesn't appear that the stage supports this tween (in my few minutes of playing around), you can definitely tween a layer:\n\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/PQ9um/\n. It appears that the built in tweening engine can only go as low as the layer (which directly maps to a canvas in the DOM).\nNothing stops you from using an external tweening engine, such as the GreenSock Animation Platform (http://www.greensock.com/get-started-js/).  \nCheck out this modified version of that fiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/PQ9um/2/\n(Just be aware that each canvas is being redrawn with each frame, so performance may become an issue, especially if the rendering logic and/or garbage collection takes longer than a frame's timeslice to execute).\n. I discovered today that there's a Greensock plugin for Kinetic: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/KineticPlugin.html\n. You can use an external tweening library, like GreenSock (http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/) with it's ColorProps plugin (http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ColorPropsPlugin.html) to tween colors and then apply them to the Kinetic shape on each frame update:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ZH2AS/2/\n. No plans for direct support of tweening color stops on a gradient fill. \nI would consider this tween to be an outlier that would justify the use of an external library, since it's easy enough to implement with something like Greensock, and deferring complex/outlier tweens to an external engine does not inflate the Kinetic library's size (and potential slow down built-in tween animations in the process for everyone else who just need simple tweens). Once you have justification for using Greensock for a complex tween, then you can actually use it for all of your tweens.\nSent from my Windows Phone\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"AxoInsanit\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e4/\u200e20/\u200e2014 3:48 PM\nTo: \"ericdrowell/KineticJS\" KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"jfollas\" jfollas@gmail.com\nSubject: Re: [KineticJS] How can I tween shape gradient fill stops?

Try overriding the mobile flag for now if the browser is Internet Explorer:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/880\n. Some background first, for anyone else coming to this thread:\nIE10 still reported itself in the user agent as \"MSIE\". But, because people were [wrongly] trying to apply IE6/7/8 semantics if they detected any version of IE, MSFT has altered the user agent for IE11 to just look like a Mozilla-compatible browser (no mention of \"MSIE\" in the user agent).  This starts with Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.\nI first patched the UA detection and implemented the touch workaround for mobile IE 10/11 here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/f9f7b89c3f8522868bab3a857c687b7487bd2f10\nand then corrected a bug here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8d5298d7ca8e36ee433fd1a121103f74e737ddf2\nUnfortunately, I only have Windows Phone 8.1 devices/emulators (IE11) now to verify that the patches work.

The Kinetic Context object is a proxy to the HTML5 Canvas Context, so it does not implement 100% of the browser's Canvas API.  You can get a reference to the actual browser context using Context._context, as in:\n\njavascript\nlayer.getContext()._context.globalCompositeOperation = \"source-atop\";\n. This is probably due to RequestAnimationFrame, which is letting the browser tell the program when it's ready to draw the next frame. It makes sense for RAF to not fire when the browser tab does not have focus, since that would be rendering frames that are never displayed.\nYou may need to look into using a Tween engine with more sophistication, like GreenSock Animation Platform (which has a Kinetic Plugin and a Timeline object, which is handy for coordinating many different tweens that need to work together, etc)\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"Martin Velchevski\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e5/\u200e29/\u200e2014 3:55 PM\nTo: \"ericdrowell/KineticJS\" KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [KineticJS] Tween not animating when it's browser window loosesfocus.

I tried using setClip() in the event that layer\nclipping defaulted to the size of the viewable window, to no avail (I am\nstarting to think that the layers do not concern themselves with what is\n\"outside\" the stage bounds, even when specified, when you call toImage()).\nIs this a limitation of toImage(), a bug, or am I just missing something\nto do before calling toImage() on a layer?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/965.\n.

The security exception being thrown by FF3.6 is due to the quality parameter - their implementation was before that parameter was introduced in the spec/recommendation.  \n\nI first thought of having cascading logic that takes out one parameter at a time, but thought that code may have been too messy for the limited audience that it would serve.  If interested, the code would have resembled:\njavascript\ntry {\n    // If this call fails (due to browser bug, like in Firefox 3.6),\n    // then revert to previous no-parameter image/png behavior\n    callback(bufferLayer.getCanvas().toDataURL(mimeType, quality));\n}\ncatch(exception)\n{\n    try {\n        callback(bufferLayer.getCanvas().toDataURL(mimeType)); // Try with just mimeType\n    }\n    catch(exception)\n    {\n        callback(bufferLayer.getCanvas().toDataURL()); // If all else fails, this is the original behavior\n    }\n}\n. May want to consider changing the name of the Kinetic.Path attr from \"command\" to \"data\" to match nomenclature used by SVG (i.e., their html syntax is <path d='M1,2...'>)\n. Looks like the elliptical arc curve is the only svg path command not implemented here yet.  \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands\n. Weird bug! \nIn a pinch, you could use a Path shape with two elliptical arcs (i.e., one for each half):\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/jfollas/tdar8/\nFor a ellipse with radius [20, 40] centered at 100,200, something like:\nvar ellipse3 = new Kinetic.Path({\n    x: 100,\n    y: 200,\n    fill: \"#777\",\n    stroke: \"black\",\n    data: \"m -20 0 a 20 40 0 1 0 40 0 a 20 40 0 0 0 -40 0 z\"\n});\n. Shape pack makes absolute sense.  No need to bloat the core API with functionality that most people won't need (and can easily be added by means of a 2nd script tag)\n. 1) Path and TextPath share the same core path parsing logic, so I was looking for a way to keep from duplicating all of that code.  The implementation tried to replicate how the other various shapes extended Shape (in this case, I was trying to extend a shape that already extends Shape), but since the draw logic is different, I needed a way to render the TextPath after path parsing took place.  \nThat being said, I recognize the need to refactor and simplify, so will look into it.\n2) The code bloat in Path is functionality that is needed by TextPath, but could also be used with Path if desired (things that the Canvas doesn't yet provide, like point-on-curve and path length).  With a cleaner separation of the two shapes (#1 above), these functions can be moved into TextPath itself, or externalized somehow (maybe similar to Tween), but TextPath does need them in order to calculate the location and rotation of each glyph.\n3) Sure!\n. Do you want to namespace things in the plugins folder?  Meaning, should they be named Kinetic.Plugins.Foo, or just Kinetic.Foo?\n. Ok, I added the empty Kinetic.Plugins object to Global (just like Kinetic.Filters).\n. I should have included this forum link where it was reported:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1042\n. Does anyone have a jsFiddle that demonstrates the issue?  I like to convert these into unit tests within the codebase.\n. In my testing, Firefox is the only browser that will respect the opacity when rendering a SVG as an image.  Chrome and Internet Explorer will render SVG-as-images to the Canvas, but ignore the globalAlpha setting on the Canvas context at the time that drawImage() is invoked.  I have not found bug reports yet to this effect, but have proven it with testing (i.e., set globalAlpha and then draw an image - any file type other than svg will have transparency).\nNote: A tip that I found to ensure that browsers can render SVG-as-images consistently is to ensure that the svg markup has width, height, and viewBox attributes all defined.  If any are missing, you'll have different behavior among the various browser versions.\nClosing because there doesn't appear to be anything that Kinetic itself can do since the behavior is at the native code level of the browser's canvas implementation.\n. Nice catch!\n. It's not just iOS. I've seen the same symptom at least with IE10 (Windows 8 apps). I always assumed it was a memory management issue/garbage collection/etc because it only became apparent after many animations.  Perhaps in my case, those types of issues lead to an inconsistent frame rate with requestAnimationFrame.\n. :) I just keep adding it back into my local version of Kinetic when my\nshapes stop responding to clicks. ;)\nOn Nov 15, 2012 2:55 PM, \"Eric Rowell\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nhaven't forgotten about this, will get to it asap :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/141#issuecomment-10422772.\n.

Integrating as a separate commit from this pull request\n. What's not working on Windows Phone 8?  Have you tried it recently with the latest version of Kinetic to see if enhancements made in the past 10 months have improved things?\n\nI am assuming that you're referring to opening a web page in IE10 on WP8, and not creating an HTML5 application.  I can say that I have tested Kinetic on WP8 with success (sometimes, just need tweaking, but that's primarily to the HTML, not the Kinetic/canvas code).\nAs for what @ericdrowell referred to, IE10 introduced the MSPointerEvent that brings mouse, touch, and pen events all into one single event.  This has since been committed to webkit and firefox as \"pointerevent\", so expect to use it everywhere in the future.\nThe nice thing, though, is if a MSPointerEvent is not handled, it elevates to a normal mouse event (so I don't even try to handle the new event in my Kinetic apps).\n. I closed it due to no response. Guessing that it's probably related to this (which is still open):\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/880\n. [Finally] added this fix to the codebase.  Thanks for researching the issue and providing the code!\n. Fixing this by rendering the text (glyphs) to the hit canvas.\n. CI doesn't like the changes I made to the test. Still getting familiar with the new test framework...\nEdit: Fixed the test, CI passes.\n. Since MSPointer events automatically elevate to Mouse events if they aren't handled, is this still a concern?  My Win8 apps have been working fine with the first touch elevating to a mouse event.\n. In IE10/11, you need to tell the browser that you will be handling touch events for a container (else, it will try to interpret touch as an action for the browser to perform, like panning or zooming, etc).\nIf you want to try it out, edit the Drag/Drop tutorial that you referenced to add a style to the container div (did you know that the code in those tutorials are in a live editor?):\nhtml\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"-ms-touch-action: none;\"></div>\nReference: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772044(v=vs.85).aspx\n. Do you have a jsFiddle or something that exhibits the issue so that I can take a look in IE9?\n. If this is still a problem with > 4.7.2, then reopen this issue.\n. Oh, are you trying to use the DataURI as the address of the web page?  (Sorry, haven't opened your example yet).  IE9 won't allow this, but you can create a img src=\"your data uri\" in the popup window.\nLook at how I handle a popup window here (code at bottom) as an example that works in IE9:\nhttps://github.com/jfollas/CanvasKineticDemo/blob/master/kineticDemos/6.1.toDataURL.htm\n. When you say \"SVG Image\", is that using Kinetic.Image to draw a picture onto the canvas (using svg as a source of that image), or is it using a SVG path in conjunction with the Kinetic.Path shape?  Do you have a jsFiddle that exhibits this issue so we can keep an eye on it (especially if an upcoming browser fix could positively affect the results)?\n. We can't do anything about #98 because it's native browser rendering issue.  Apparently,at the moment, only Firefox will respect the Canvas context's opacity setting when SVG is used as an image (Chrome and IE ignores opacity when it renders the SVG using drawImage(), while correctly rendering any other image format using the very same code).\nBy the same token, because it's native code in the browser that renders the image, I don't believe that we have control over anti-aliasing from Kinetic, which seems to be the cause of the issue that you are reporting here (\"jagged\" rendering).  I think we'll just need to wait for Firefox 24 as @fuzzley reported above.\n. I had to review the Path code, but I think I see the culprit.  At the end of drawing all of the vectors, it's doing a fill and stroke operation.  The fill part of that operation will close the path, which is giving it area between the endpoints of your curve - Kinetic is picking up this invisible area as being part of the shape.\nI can probably break up the fillStroke() into a separate fill and stroke operation, and only perform the fill operation if there's something to fill with.\nMaybe Eric will have another suggestion for handling stroke-only scenarios to prevent the inside of the shape from being detected by Kinetic.\n. Committed the fix.  If the shape's \"fill\" is not defined, then it will only Stroke() the path.\n. Wonder what the range of browser support is... \nSVG is neat because you can use it as the src of an img right in your HTML, so it doesn't surprise me that there are browsers that can render SVG onto a canvas (using context.drawImage), treating it as just another image format.\nKinetic's Path shape isn't intended to replace SVG, or even render SVG.  I created it just for reusing the terse Path syntax since Canvas didn't have an equivalent yet (the latest WhatWG spec shows a lot of SVG being brought into Canvas, including native Path support).  \nBefore Kinetic.Path, my alternative was a custom Shape with Canvas API commands to perform each operation that was represented within the SVG Path data (moveTo, lineTo, etc).\n. I've reproduced your code as a JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/KBnYM/\nThe problem with issues like this is that Kinetic has no control over how the browser handles rendering - Kinetic simply tells the browser what to do, and the browser performs the rendering of pixels to the screen using native code.  Firefox and Internet Explorer both correctly anti-alias your rotated image, but Chrome (at least the current version) does not when 2D acceleration is enabled.\nBut, if you were to \"Disable accelerated 2D canvas\" (from URL: chrome://flags/#disable-accelerated-2d-canvas), then Chrome's software renderer correctly anti-aliases the image on my machine.  This would suggest a bug with Chrome's accelerated 2D canvas implementation.  \nUnfortunately, I don't think there's anything that we can do in Kinetic to this handle bad behavior that exists only in versions of Chrome.\n. I believe these are Chromium bugs that may cover the bad behavior that you are seeing: \nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7508\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=82268\n. You have to click the \"Enable\" link to turn on the \"Disable accelerated 2D canvas\", and then click the Relaunch button at the bottom.  Not saying this is the recommended fix to solve your issue, but that this demonstrates that it's an issue with Chrome's 2D GPU accelerated canvas implementation.\nDefault:\n\n2D Accelerated Canvas Disabled:\n\n. I believe this is a bug in the current version of Chrome. I can confirm similar behavior after a while of using a canvas on a page.\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"nvikram\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e9/\u200e7/\u200e2013 2:14 AM\nTo: \"ericdrowell/KineticJS\" KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [KineticJS] Canvas goes blank quite often (#598)\nQuite often the canvas goes blank and does not render the shape or the shape maybe rendered but not the fill colors.

As Eric mentioned above, Kinetic attempts to correct an issue with a double-shadow being applied by utilizing a temporary canvas, and then copying the temporary canvas to the final canvas.  Chrome has had a bug for a long time now with \"using drawImage to copy from one canvas to another, when the source canvas had transparent areas\".  The Chromium bug at fault appears to be this one, if you want to track status or provide feedback to Chrome about their bug: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=100703\n\nOne possible workaround would be to bypass this buffering technique by overriding a helper function in Shape.js named _useBufferCanvas.  If this function returns false, then the \"old\" way will be used, which may result in the double shadow issue, depending on the browser and your shapes.\nYou can override on a per-shape basis as follows:\n``` javascript\nvar rect4 = new Kinetic.Rect({ ... });\nrect4._useBufferCanvas = function () {\n    return false;\n};\n```\nOr, another possible patch would be to override globally for a given type of shape (Rect, Circle, etc) with User Agent detection (include the following code before instantiating any shapes of the type that you specify as the first argument):\njavascript\nKinetic.Util.addMethods(Kinetic.Rect, {\n    _useBufferCanvas: function () {\n        if (Kinetic.UA.browser === 'chrome')\n            return false;\n        else\n            return (this.hasShadow() || this.getAbsoluteOpacity() !== 1) && this.hasFill() && this.hasStroke() && this.getStage();\n    }\n});\nThe point of mentioning these workarounds is that you can do this in your own application code without waiting for the next official release of Kinetic.\nSee this Fiddle for results: http://jsfiddle.net/ae3A4/1/\n. I can understand the frustration that comes from having an API change from underneath you, but it's not really fair to lay into Eric so hard about this.  He puts so much time into producing a free and open source library to make it easier to do cool things with the canvas, and doesn't deserve to be chastised over a decision that he made based on feedback that he received.\nInstead of going back to 4.5.5, it may be easier to just change your project's version of Kinetic 5.x to use radians, since Kinetic is fully open source.  This would have a benefit of your code not needing changed yet again when support for radian angles are restored.\nAfter a quick look through the code, there's only one line in node.js (1145, part of _getTransform) that would seem to be the culprit.  Remove the conversion from degrees to radians there, and you can then supply all of your rotations in radians.\nTest providing radian angle for rotation: http://jsfiddle.net/mjg6r/1/\nModified 5.0.1: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=WXaHyd1R\n. For the record: I'm still in favor of the old/separate .rotation (for\nradians) and .rotationDeg (for degrees), with one just being a convenience\nmethod to set the other.

You're looking for a bounding box function.

Kinetic doesn't actually draw every pixel of arcs and curves - it simply\ntells the browser \"I need this curve\", and native code in the browser\nrenders the pixels.  So, we don't actually know the x/y of the individual\npixels that are rendered without calculating them ourselves.\n\nBut, when I wrote the TextPath shape, I needed to find points along the\npath to know where to render glyphs.  So, some undocumented functions that\nmay be of assistance to you if you wanted to attempt to write your own\nbounding box algorithm using path traversal:\nKinetic.Path.getPointOnCubicBezier(pct, P1x, P1y, P2x, P2y, P3x, P3y, P4x,\nP4y)\nKinetic.Path.getPointOnQuadraticBezier(pct, P1x, P1y, P2x, P2y, P3x, P3y)\nKinetic.Path.getPointOnEllipticalArc(cx, cy, rx, ry, theta, psi)\nThese functions return a point object (i.e.,  { x: 123, y: 456} ).  You\nwould just need to traverse the curve by iterating the pct from 0 to 1.0\nusing some increment (i.e., 0.1 to get each point 10% along the path), and\ntrack the min/max over all of the parts of the path.  For arcs, you iterate\nthe theta property from the starting angle to the ending angle.\nA parsed version of the path string can be found in your instance's\nPath.dataArray.  Refer to the findSegmentToFitCharacter function within\nTextPath.prototype._setTextData for how to used the parsed data in\nconjunction with these functions.\nIf you're successful in implementing this, feel free to submit a pull\nrequest!\n-Jason\nOn Sun, Mar 2, 2014 at 10:18 PM, wiregrasscoder notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nThanks jfollas.

You'll probably want to use offsetX and offsetY instead of offset (which takes an object now with x and y properties). And, while it doesn't appear that the stage supports this tween (in my few minutes of playing around), you can definitely tween a layer:\n\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/PQ9um/\n. It appears that the built in tweening engine can only go as low as the layer (which directly maps to a canvas in the DOM).\nNothing stops you from using an external tweening engine, such as the GreenSock Animation Platform (http://www.greensock.com/get-started-js/).  \nCheck out this modified version of that fiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/PQ9um/2/\n(Just be aware that each canvas is being redrawn with each frame, so performance may become an issue, especially if the rendering logic and/or garbage collection takes longer than a frame's timeslice to execute).\n. I discovered today that there's a Greensock plugin for Kinetic: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/KineticPlugin.html\n. You can use an external tweening library, like GreenSock (http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/) with it's ColorProps plugin (http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ColorPropsPlugin.html) to tween colors and then apply them to the Kinetic shape on each frame update:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ZH2AS/2/\n. No plans for direct support of tweening color stops on a gradient fill. \nI would consider this tween to be an outlier that would justify the use of an external library, since it's easy enough to implement with something like Greensock, and deferring complex/outlier tweens to an external engine does not inflate the Kinetic library's size (and potential slow down built-in tween animations in the process for everyone else who just need simple tweens). Once you have justification for using Greensock for a complex tween, then you can actually use it for all of your tweens.\nSent from my Windows Phone\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"AxoInsanit\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e4/\u200e20/\u200e2014 3:48 PM\nTo: \"ericdrowell/KineticJS\" KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"jfollas\" jfollas@gmail.com\nSubject: Re: [KineticJS] How can I tween shape gradient fill stops?

Try overriding the mobile flag for now if the browser is Internet Explorer:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/880\n. Some background first, for anyone else coming to this thread:\nIE10 still reported itself in the user agent as \"MSIE\". But, because people were [wrongly] trying to apply IE6/7/8 semantics if they detected any version of IE, MSFT has altered the user agent for IE11 to just look like a Mozilla-compatible browser (no mention of \"MSIE\" in the user agent).  This starts with Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.\nI first patched the UA detection and implemented the touch workaround for mobile IE 10/11 here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/f9f7b89c3f8522868bab3a857c687b7487bd2f10\nand then corrected a bug here:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/8d5298d7ca8e36ee433fd1a121103f74e737ddf2\nUnfortunately, I only have Windows Phone 8.1 devices/emulators (IE11) now to verify that the patches work.  Which means there could still be an issue with mobile IE10.\n.

The bug is in Chrome itself (related to shadows on images not having alpha channel support). You can find a workaround in this thread: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/726\n. The Kinetic Context object is a proxy to the HTML5 Canvas Context, so it does not implement 100% of the browser's Canvas API.  You can get a reference to the actual browser context using Context._context, as in:\n\njavascript\nlayer.getContext()._context.globalCompositeOperation = \"source-atop\";\n. This is probably due to RequestAnimationFrame, which is letting the browser tell the program when it's ready to draw the next frame. It makes sense for RAF to not fire when the browser tab does not have focus, since that would be rendering frames that are never displayed.\nYou may need to look into using a Tween engine with more sophistication, like GreenSock Animation Platform (which has a Kinetic Plugin and a Timeline object, which is handy for coordinating many different tweens that need to work together, etc)\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"Martin Velchevski\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e5/\u200e29/\u200e2014 3:55 PM\nTo: \"ericdrowell/KineticJS\" KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [KineticJS] Tween not animating when it's browser window loosesfocus.

Well, since this is an anti alias problem, it should be only one pixel wide.  So if the getIntersection code checked near the hit coordinates it should find something.  Could we modify getIntersection to search the 8 surrounding pixels if it finds alpha != 0 but does not find a matching shape?  In this case finding something slowly would be better than finding something quickly i think.\n. Happy too.  I will submit a pull after I finish all the corner cases.\n Literally.\n\nDavid\nOn Sat, Jul 20, 2013 at 7:21 PM, Eric Rowell notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nThat's a great suggestion fogbrain. would you mind trying it out and\nsubmitting a pull request?

Hi Eric, Thanks for the response. And yes v4.5.4 worked without a hitch.\n. I have the same problem with 4.5.3.\n. Hey folks,\n\nI worked around this by first adding a \"shim\" layer with a big white rectangle (my background is white). My canvas size is 800x600, so you should adjust for your canvas size. Next, I added a separate layer for my draggable items. \nHope this helps some poor soul. I wrestled with it for quite a while. \n```\n  var layerShim = new Kinetic.Layer({\n        id: 'layerShim',\n        name: 'layerShimName',\n        clearBeforeDraw: false\n  });      \nvar layerDraggableStuff = new Kinetic.Layer({\n        id: 'layerDraggableStuff',\n        name: 'layerDraggableStuff',\n        clearBeforeDraw: true\n  });      \nvar rect = new Kinetic.Rect({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0,\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    fill: 'white',\n    stroke: 'white',\n    strokeWidth: 4\n  });\n  layerShim.add(rect);\n  layerShim.draw();\n// Add shim layer\n  stage.add(layerShim);\n// Add nodes to draggables layer here... \n// Add draggables layer\n  stage.add(layerDraggables);\n```\n. I'm running Android 4.3, so it looks like the Android bug is still lingering. Thanks for the workaround, @ericdrowell. Much cleaner than my elaborate hack. \n. Thank you Eric, Telerik MVC (http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/slider) dropdown or sliders do not work. Maybe, there could be a conflict with Telerik ScriptRegistrar!  By-the-way, thanks for HTML Canvas Cookbook, very helpful.\n. I don't think so.  The most important case for users of the library is\nprobably 2 shapes which clearly overlap.  When you click you should\nalways hit one or the other.  The current anti-aliasing causes the\ndividing line between them to be in neither which is the big\ncomplaint.\nOn 11/27/13, Eric Rowell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nquestion: is it true that checking the 4 pixels around a pixel with an alpha\n< 255 is accurate?  I would think that it's possible that adjacent pixels\ncould also have an alpha < 255 depending on the angle of the edge.  We could\ngo to all 8 pixels, but I wonder if that's accurate as well.  I'll try to\nmanually merge this in since it's been awhile. (sorry about that)\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/545#issuecomment-29426491\n. Yes, this is annoying. I think this is related with anti aliasing.\n\nI've created example: http://jsfiddle.net/LwRnj/\nMove the curosr between the squares.\n. @lavrton I never had any issue loading it with requirejs. Only with Dojo. My assumption is that KineticJS optimizations in the compressed code ends up breaking some of the AMD-detection code. The Dojo AMD loader successfully loads uncompressed KineticJS, but simply returns an empty object if I use the compressed version of KineticJS.\n. I agree with binoculars. I'd prefer to set the rotation in radians instead of degrees. It is more natural in mathematical calculations.\n. It can be vaguely expressed. If you set the rotation in degrees, the result is bad.\nSee: http://jsfiddle.net/klatecki/s3wCz/2/\n. Thanks jfollas. In my case, the paths use both lines and Bezier curves, however, the shapes are such that it would suffice to just know the min/max x/y values used to create the path. That's all I would need for an accurate bounding box.\nIt would be great if KineticJS could tuck path coordinates away and return max/min of a shape. It may not work on every shape, but I've seen others performing elaborate workarounds with regex and eval statements to accomplish this. \nI think I may be able to roll my own bezierCurveTo and lineTo methods that track max/min values per path...\n. Did this ever get merged in?  I'm using KineticJS 5.1.0 and can't get mousewheel to work on shapes.\n. Thanks for the quick response, that was the problem!\n. Hi, I'm facing the same problem, the reason behind this is that the touch coordinate is not scaled with the canvas. Currently I have overriden the _setTouchPosition methode, so that the touch position also be transformed.\n. ``` javascript\nsetZoomLevel: function(zoomLevel){\n       this.zoomLevel = zoomLevel;\n },\n getZoomLevel : function(){\n      return this.zoomLevel;\n },\n_setTouchPosition: function(evt) {\n            var touch, touchX, touchY;\n        if(evt.touches !== undefined && evt.touches.length === 1) {\n            // one finger\n            touch = evt.touches[0];\n\n            // get the information for finger #1\n            touchX = touch.clientX - this._getContentPosition().left;\n            touchY = touch.clientY - this._getContentPosition().top;\n            var zLevel = this.getZoomLevel() == undefined ? 1 : this.getZoomLevel();\n            this.touchPos = {\n                x: touchX/zLevel,\n                y: touchY/zLevel\n            };\n        }\n\n}\n```\nI have recomputed the touch position using the scale level this way. Maybe there is a better solution.\n. Oops, duplicate of #1071 . ",

Unexpected \"invisible\" image.\nIf you want to check is image is ok, you may do this:\njavascript\nlayer.add(image);\ntry {\n  layer.draw();\n} catch (e) {\n  // ops...\n}\n.

The problem was with firefox browser, and currnly is solved. Issue is closed.\n. Is this issue actual? You can define dash property of line as you wish, so line may look like  transition from one dash array to another.\n. Currently onFinish callback will be called even if node is destroyed.

Currently drag&drop is going on the same layer. So this problem is not actual. I will close the issue.\n. With new KineticJS version timeDiff (in Kinetic.Animation callback) will be  floating-point number too.\n. As transitionTo is deprecated by Tween class, problem still exists. Currently this will not work:\njavascript\nvar tween = new Kinetic.Tween({\n node : node,\n duration : 1,\n offset: {\n  x : 2,\n  y : 2\n }\n});\ntween.play();\n. I think that information that Tween is not support objects should be placed at documentation.\n. Issue can be closed, because currently nodes are dragging on same layer.\n. Should be fixed.\n. Can't reproduce bug with latest version: http://jsbin.com/xoqex/1/edit\n. I will close the issue. If it still actual for you, please, reopen with jsfiddle example.\n. @dchhetri , it is not working, because if call draw, it also call drawHit. Result: you have backgroud on bottom, line on top, so mouseup will fire on line shape, but not on background. As I know, Kineticjs has specal canvas for events. If you are calling \"layer.drawScene\", this canvas is not updating, so events for line not fire, but fire for background.\n. Also If you need some events on stage you can use this tip. Create invisible background rectangle and listen events on it (or in stage, while events are bubbling):\njavascript\nvar back = new Kinetic.Rect({\n    draggable : true,\n    // disable move on dragging\n    dragBoundFunc : function() {\n        return {x : 0, y : 0};\n    }\n});\nlayer.add(back);\nback.on(\"click tap\", () => { \n    // some code\n});\n. Resolved issue. I will close it.\n. Currenly KineticJS works fine with AMD. I will close the issue.\n. I think issue can be closed. Currently opera works as expected.\n.

Now you can do this with drawHitFromCache function using alphaThreshold parameter.\n. Demo for bug: http://jsbin.com/cuqas/1/edit\nOk for rect, not ok for text.\n. Hit canvas is not updating while dragging (for performance reasons).\nAs a workaround you may draw layer on dragend.\njavascript\nkItems.lowerLayer.on(\"dragend\", function() {\n    kItems.upperLayer.draw();  // or just drawHit()\n});\nUpdated demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/37pG3/1/\n.

Close as duplicate https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/193\n. v5.0.1 dblcick event works: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/a69V9/\nBut this is bad use case, because dblcick, actually, should not trigger on circle. Because after each click a new circle is created, so second click happens on NEW node.\n. Your use case is very strange. You should not use \"private\" properties. Please, repost you question to stackoverflow, if it still actual.\n. You may add text to layer before converting.\nOr you have to set {x, y} in toImage params: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TMML9/1/\n.

Currently getTextHeight returns fontSize, if you need multiline support use getHeight instead.\n. +1 May be create special \"arrow\" shape?\n. I will close this issue. If you still have problems, please, create jsfiddle to demonstrate problem and reopen issue.\n. I think we should not do this. Main reason is event bubbling. User may listen events on parent, not on shape. So library code will be too complicated if we will add such functionality. It is MUCH easier to manually use shape.listening(false)\n. I am closing the issue as you have an answer on stackoverflow. I am not sure can we do something here with KineticJS codebase.\n. Looks like problem is resolved.\n.

Using KineticJS in this case is incorrect. You should not draw to context manualy by yourself (excepts using custom shape and related use cases: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shape-tutorial/ ).\n. It works as expected with latest version.\n. Such behavior maybe unexpected, but DOM elements are working in the same way. See demo: http://jsbin.com/poqec/1/edit\n@ThomasRuby children are not placed in the stage after group.remove(). removeChildren just prevent event bubbling, so mouseleave will be fired on mouse, but not in group, because circle is not in group any more.\n. Problem still exists. I made small fiddle for demonstration: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/h927F/\n. Fixed at fork. https://github.com/lavrton/KineticJS\n. Currently KineticJS (v5.0.1) has not support of this.\nYou can do this:\n- Find intersection by yourself.

If you need to take clip region into account you should use parent's draw function: group.draw() or layer.draw()\n. Also I think it will be very helpful to create page with kineticjs related stuff such as: ide tools, snippets, articles, plugins, tips, etc.\nMy suggestion: create special github repo \"KineticJS stuff\", with readme file with this related information.\nIt is very easy to add new plugins, articles via pull request in this case.\nFor example I created Backbone plugin that helps me work with KineticJS. May be it can be usefull for someone else.\n. Also someone created this interesting tool: https://github.com/soloproyectos/jquery.transformtool\nDemo: http://jsfiddle.net/cequiel/hkjtM/\n. Now sprite.start() works as expected. Also I added isRunning method for sprite object. (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/53ac9329de63d01f11822975a17932828085e877)\n. If you know coordinates of your line you can calculate coordinates of text manually. If this question is still actual, please, post it to stackoverfow.\n. :+1: Really need to such stuff as detect drop shape. I think best realisation is events \"dragover\", \"dragout\".\n. You can move draggable shape to temporary layer on dragstart, then call getIntersection to detect collision. See demo: http://jsbin.com/pecor/1/edit\n. I think we should implement easy way to change layer while dragging and add drawHitOnDrag configuration.\nAs dirty workaroud look there: http://jsbin.com/pecor/3/edit\n. I believe I found the problem. Original issue is fixed.\nBut we have new issue with cache system: http://jsfiddle.net/LwRnj/49/. Problem is related to aliasing. KineticJS is taking aliasing into account. But only for 1 pixel. If you will cache node then scale it a lot, aliasing area will bigger than 1 pixel.\nCurrently I have no idea how to fix problem in this case... Your thoughts, guys?\n.

If you still have problems, please, reopen the issue with more specific information and jsfiddle demo.\n. Close as fixed.\n. Works as expected with v5.0.1\n. I think this is a bad idea to use many libraries in the same canvas.\nFor example kineticjs take full controll of canvas element. It can clean and redraw it whatever it want.\nAlso kineticjs has good mechanism with layers and creating more canvases for performance reasons.\n. You may use offset for this purpose. Please, post your question to stackoverflow if you still have it.\n. You can use Kinetic.Shape to draw object with context access. See example: http://jsbin.com/kixeq/2/edit \n. Works for me for latest kineticjs version with requirejs.\n. May be helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11929099/html5-canvas-drawimage-ratio-bug-ios\n. Hello, folks! Update on this thread. As we know this is a REAL bug of iOS webview. And as @ericdrowell said it may be dangerous to include such workarounds to KineticJS codebase.\nBUT! I found very good solution. You should know, that you can pass not only Image objects to Kinetic.Image. Also you may pass <canvas> element! So there is working way:\n1. Create special 'buffer' canvas (with same size as original image)\n2. Draw the image into the canvas with some extra workarounds\n3. Create Kinetic.Image with the canvas.\nCode:\n``` javascript\n    // detect scale ratio\n    function detectVerticalSquash(img) {\n      var iw = img.width, ih = img.height;\n      var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n      canvas.width = 1;\n      canvas.height = ih;\n      var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n      ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);\n      var data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, ih).data;\n      // search image edge pixel position in case it is squashed vertically.\n      var sy = 0;\n      var ey = ih;\n      var py = ih;\n      while (py > sy) {\n          var alpha = data[(py - 1) * 4 + 3];\n          if (alpha === 0) {\n              ey = py;\n          } else {\n              sy = py;\n          }\n          py = (ey + sy) >> 1;\n      }\n      var ratio = (py / ih);\n      return (ratio===0)?1:ratio;\n    }\n// create canvas to replace with image\nfunction generateCanvas(image){\n    var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n    var context = canvas.getContext('2d');\n    canvas.width = image.width;\n    canvas.height = image.height;\n    var vertSquashRatio = detectVerticalSquash(image);\n    console.log(image);\n    context.drawImage(image, 0, 0, \n                       image.width, image.height / vertSquashRatio);\n    return(canvas);\n}\n\nvar img = new Image();\nimg.onload = function() {\n  var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n      container: 'con',\n      width: 1000,\n      height: 1000\n  });\n  var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\n  stage.add(layer);\n  var image = new Kinetic.Image({\n    image : generateCanvas(img),\n    width : 200,\n    height : 200,\n    draggable : true\n  });\n  layer.add(image);\n  layer.draw();\n}\nimg.src = 'diana2.jpg';\n\n```\nI tested this code on iPad, and it is fixing the bug. Can someone approve?\n. @icaliman I tested my solution on iPad - and problem was gone. Do you have any errors?\n. What is value of vertSquashRatio? What are you expecting? Did you try my way with replacing image object by fixed canvas object?\n. 0.375 is not correct? May be wrong calculation if image has transparent area on left edge.\n. Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/6c46e44bbd2ba88fd3d8f63f71d8f9fa1606f8a1\n. I think too that kineticjs must have ways to detect such probems. For example:\nKinetic.setDebugLevel(\"all\");\n. KineticJS has no validation of parameters for performance reasons. But is some cases validation might be VERY helpful. I was thinking to add some debug mode to KineticJS.\nIn this mode all set methods will be overwriting with validation step. It may slow down performance, but this is just developer tool and you will be able to do something like Kinetic.debugModeOff().\nWhat do you think?\n. Good news everyone!\nI made this small script to support full validation of parameters for KineticJS.\nhttps://gist.github.com/lavrton/9363432\nUsage:\n1. Add kinetic.debug.js script after kinetic.js in your html\n2. Somewhere in your code: Kinetic.debugModeOn();\nSee example: http://jsbin.com/kujef/1/edit\nIs it awesome?\n. Plugin is available there https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/tree/master/debug\n. Looks like bug is fixed with latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/mTZEP/1/\n. Now works fine: http://jsbin.com/kojaci/1/edit. Reopen if issue still exists.\n. As expected. toImage is async function. You should use img inside callback function.\n@ericdrowell, I think you should remove from docs var image = because it can lead to confusion.\n. Use Kinetic.Util.extend\n. A layer is creating new canvas element. This is expected behaviors. You should carefully read http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-layer-management-with-kineticjs/\n. Works fine : http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/T43NK/1/\n. Ups, sorry, my mistake. Setting width of text is working as max width, right?\n. Works with latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/44reA/1/\n. API for now is\nvar html = new Kinetic.HTML({\n    html : \"<content>\",\n    callback : function() {}   //callback here is bad\n});\nMay be it wiil be more usefull with this API:\nKinetic.htmlToImage({\n    html : \"<content>\",\n    callback : function(img) {\n       var image = new Kinetic.Image({\n           image : img\n       });\n   }\n});\n. Also, if someone interesting, this may be helpfull: https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas\n. I added pinch event to my project (that is using kineticjs).\nI made first implemantation from here: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-multi-touch-scale-stage-with-kineticjs/\nBut I had some problems, so I moved to using hammer.js. It so easy and clean http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/\nMy code example:\n``` javascript\n//get stage document element and listen it\nvar transformer = Hammer(this.getStage().getContainer());    \nvar startScale = null;\ntransformer.on(\"transformstart\", function(e) {\n  startScale = _this.getCamera().getScale();\n});\ntransformer.on(\"transform\", function(e) {\n  return _this.getCamera().setScale(startScale * e.gesture.scale);\n  // or stage.setScale(...) or... Whatever you want\n});\n```\nYou can do the same for swipe event.\n. That is because hammer.js know nothing about kineticjs objects. It can't pass kineticjs targer node in event param.\nAll is posible here is define or find target node by youself.\n. HammerJS support for KineticJS's nodes will be added with next release. See example: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/\n. I added pull request https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/684 with new test.\n. How to try multitouch on object? Scale, move?\nKineticJS currently handle only one touch for dragging.\n. Of couse I can add shape to some cache layer.\nBut I will still have problems if shape size is bigger than stage size.\nShape wil be cutted: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TFW9T/1/\n(But (!) will not cuted with not shadow and stroke: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TFW9T/2/)\n. For tests: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/T43NK/6/\nAs @CyranX said :  try to drag red rect to top left corner.\n. In my machine latest example http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/T43NK/6/ (Chrome) works as expected. I will close the issue.\n. Fixed.\n. The error is somewhere else.\nProperty position doesn't matter. http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/7BjGg/\n. Currently with Chrome 33 examples work as expected. I think Chrome problem is resolved and I can close the issue.\n. run grunt dev before opening page.\n. Now you can apply filters in order you want: http://jsbin.com/novej/1/edit\n. You can convert shape to image with toImage function then apply filter.\n. Now you can use filters for all shapes. I will close the issue.\n. You may use event.changedTouches.length\n. Lates version works as expected.\n. I will close the issue. If it still actual for you, please, repost it to stackoverflow. (Demo works fine, just clarify what you are expecting)\n. remove function is not destroying object, only remove it from parent container. You should use destroy if you want permanently kill object. Post you question to stackoverfow if you still have problems.\n. Hmm.. Looks like browsers have very bad support of toBlob function.\n. Awesome! @ericdrowell please look at this. I think it is important request. It is VERY hard to do dbltap on some devices, because every time you tapped on node it is moving little bit, and that is prevent tap and dbltap. I set dragDistance = 3 in my main application. Much better.\njavascript\nKinetic.dragDistance = 3;\n// or\nnode.dragDistance(3);\n. Fixed via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5db9115a09e22dea2d0f0b97296ec9131addd70\n. Fixed. Thx.\n. You should not set node's zIndex before adding to container. Only after.\nFix: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/cadcb91fbc368d129c6a9e7261276625d1cd1d8c  Now zIndex will be ignored (with warn message) in this case.\n. You can cancel event propagation in this way:\njavascript\nrect.on(\"dragstart\", function(e){\n  e.cancelBubble = true;\n});\n. Actually, if you REALLY need this you can do some javascript hacks with Function constructor (still bad way, because JSON - is only data, no code!):\n``` javascript\nKinetic.Rect.prototype.toJSONFull = function() {\n    var obj = this.toObject();\n    obj.attrs.dragBoundFunc = this.getDragBoundFunc();\n    return JSON.stringify(obj, function (key, value) {\n        if (typeof value === 'function') {\n            return value.toString();\n        }\n        return value;\n    });\n};\nKinetic.Node.createFixed = function(json, container) {\n        var passed = JSON.parse(json, function (key, value) {\n            if (value \n                && typeof value === \"string\" \n                && value.substr(0,8) == \"function\") {\n                var startBody = value.indexOf('{') + 1;\n                var endBody = value.lastIndexOf('}');\n                var startArgs = value.indexOf('(') + 1;\n                var endArgs = value.indexOf(')');\n           return new Function(value.substring(startArgs, endArgs)\n                             , value.substring(startBody, endBody));\n        }\n        return value;\n    });\n    return this._createNode(passed, container);\n\n};\n```\nThen using:\njavascript\nvar rect2 = Kinetic.Node.createFixed(rect.toJSONFull());\nExample: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/7chvS/\n. I can't reproduce the bug. Please, reopen the issue if you still have problems.\n. Do you use offset? Looks like yes, because after scale image should be placed at same position (same top left point). May be you need to take offset into account.\n. Can't reproduce: http://jsbin.com/nonul/1/edit\n. After some time and testing I will make pull request to https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped\n. I found one more. Without pull request: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L118\nshowBorder -> drawBorder\n. Hint errors are resolved.\n. I can't reproduce the bug (Chrome Version 33.0.1750.117) http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/k8zf5/4/. Reopen if need, please.\n. :+1: @ericdrowell, your thoughts?\n. Are you sure that quality of non-cached shapes is bad? Everything is good for me. (tested on iPad)\n. There are two dependencies need for NodeJS: jsdom and canvas.\n1. We need to add them to package.json\n2. Change travis configuration to install only dev dependiences.\n3. Publish KineticJS to npm.\n@ericdrowell, can you do this?\n. grunt dev\n. npm install kinetic\n. Firefox don't understand color like 590b0a only #590b0a, but chrome understand.\n@ericdrowell, is it expected behavior:\nKinetic.Util._rgbToHex(89, 11, 10)\n\"590b0a\"\n. Sure, for 10 items, right? Try to add more by clicking on stage. See fps and compare with other examples.\n. You right. it may use WebGL. But in my tests browser has no WebGL support, so Pixi was using 2d canvas.\n. Yah, more tutorials! I wrote some tips, that you already noticed: https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools#performance (like transformsEnabled and hitGraphEnabledparams).\n. I updated fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Yc73v/6/) with transformsEnabled: 'position', hitGraphEnabled: false and using previous position API (getX, setX) instead of overloaded. Better, but not to much. (+ 5 fps for 1000 BUNNIES in my machine)\n. With new cache function from v5.0.0 KineticJS getting much faster.\n. No need after HammerJS support.\n. Wait until image loaded:\njavascript\nvar heating_on3= new Image();\nheating_on3.src = \"icons/heating_on.png\";\nheating_on3.onload = function() {\n    this.heating = new Kinetic.Rect({\n        x: 100,\n        y: 200,\n        height: 100,\n        width: 100,\n        fillPatternImage: heating_on3,\n        stroke:\"black\",\n        strokeWidth:10\n    });    \n};\n@ericdrowell, I think KineticJS should have some out of the box ways to wait loading.\n. Really looks like a bug. You must set fillPatternScaleX and fillPatternScaleY:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/33Zet/1/\n. @ericdrowell,\njavascript\nKinetic.Factory.addGetterSetter(Kinetic.Shape, 'fillPatternScaleX', 0);\nShould it be:\njavascript\nKinetic.Factory.addGetterSetter(Kinetic.Shape, 'fillPatternScaleX', 1);\n?\n. Tested with latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Vm52D/\nWoks fine everywhere. Can you make a fiddle example?\n. Looks like a bug. Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/uT5Zb/\n. http://web.archive.org/web/20130917231605/http://kineticjs.com/docs/ :+1: \n. Look at this demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/show\nTry to transform with multitouch! Awesome, is it?\nSo easy to setup:\n``` javascript\nvar startScale = 1;\nvar startRotate = 0;\nvar hammertime = Hammer(rect)\n.on(\"transformstart\", function(e) {\n    startScale = rect.scaleX();\n    startRotate = rect.rotation();\n}).on(\"transform\", function(e) {\n    rect.scale({\n        x : startScale * e.gesture.scale,\n        y : startScale * e.gesture.scale,\n    });\n    rect.rotation(startRotate + e.gesture.rotation)\n});\n```\n. Updated for swipe event. http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/show\n. What you mean \"it's hard\"? Do you mean it is hard to implement all multitouch events INSIDE KineticJS?\nIn example above you may test that all events are supported via hammerjs. (and some little patch to kineticjs). I will make pull request for this soon.\n. No. It is only adding more events for one node.\n. Done: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/61542ea6cce360218a7a34f50d749d00411c5438\nBut currently it is not possible to remove specific handler:\njavascript\nhammerInstance.off(\"event\", handler);\nyou may use namespace for this case:\njavascript\nhammerInstance.off(\"event.namespace\");\n. I think this is good workflow. I also added same behaviour for touchmove. That will increase dragging performance on some android devices a lot (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/821)! Thanks!\n. May be it will be useful if group will find width by itself.\n. You can use node.strokeEnabled function.\n. javascript\nstage.setSize({\n   width : params.width,\n   height : params.height\n});\n. My thoughts:\n1. Do not use cache - each cache function is new canvas element in memory.\n2. Try to use as less number of layers as possible. 75 - is TOO MANY! I think that 10 is max.\n. I don't think this is useful commit:\n1. We have very good support for requestAnimationFrame http://caniuse.com/requestanimationframe\n2. You will get wrong behaviour if you call multiple FRAF at once. Example:\n``` javascript\nvar callback = function() {\n    console.log(Date.now());\n}\nfor (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n    FRAF(callback);\n}\n```\n. Please, repost your question to stackoverflow with jsfiddle example.\n. Hint errors are resolved.\n. http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shape-tutorial/\n. Thank you! I think this algorithm https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/807 is much cleaner and easier to understood; so I added it.\n. Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/a524ba9ec12fc23fbb774739947c567628752c4f\n. Thx! https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/3a5b6eb76618a8b5bb6bca6bfafb6fe9e06fac2a\n. Close via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf\nCheck again, please, with your system. Reopen if need.\n. API changes:\njavascript\nstage.setScale({\n x : scale,\n y : scale\n});\nstage.setSize({\n  width : width,\n  height : height\n});\n. Looks like tutorial is not updated (@ericdrowell, please look at this).  It is not working on my device.\n. stage.setSize({\n  width : newWidth,\n  height : newHeight\n});\n. You may prevent using cache() function for Image but hit graph will have rectangle shape in this case. It is not possible to create hit graph with same shape as image without cache().\n@m73 currently cached node does not support changing opacity value. Will be fixed soon.\n. Bug here. Opacity will be applied twice (if cached object already has opacity).\n. May be we can reset opacity before caching (cache function):\njavascript\nvar prevOpacity = this.getOpacity();\nthis.setOpacity(1);\nthis.drawScene(cachedSceneCanvas);\nthis.drawHit(cachedHitCanvas);\nthis.setOpacity(prevOpacity);\nthen apply opacity to cache\n. close by https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/cb52be6dc0e62fa526579762d45e92d08b434d23\n. You should not touch built in methods of KineticJS's nodes. Just use another variable\n. Thx. But I think this is very specific use case. You can do this manually. As example:\njavascript\nvar isOk = true;\nstage.getChildren().each(function(layer){\n    if (!layer.toDataURL()) {\n        isOk = false;\n    }\n});\nif (!isOk) {\n   // something\n}\n. I made this set of tests for different ways of drawing objects: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TwAh3/show/\nNo difference on desktop, but different on android devices.\nAlso I founde little hack that helps solve subject :\njavascript\n        var oldFunc = this.layer._getIntersection;\n        node.on(\"dragstart\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = function(){\n                return node;\n            }\n        });\n        node.on(\"dragend\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = oldFunc;\n        });\nUsual usage: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Yp8gP/show/\nWith hack: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/ANJ98/show/\nDo you feel difference on android devices?\n. This problem is relative to drag&drop. While dragging, every touchmove event will call getIntersectrion function. By design of KineticJS intersections are finding via native context getImageData function. As I explained at first post problem only on android devices, where this function (getImageData) is slow.\n. Profiling on Asus Transformer TF101G (Android). (while dragging one star)\nUsual Kinetic usage (http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Yp8gP/show/):\n\nAfter disable _getIntersection (http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/ANJ98/show/) (plus 5-10 fps):\n\n. > no don't do that, you're essentially indirectly throttling the event detection.\nDo you mean my small hack?\n. Sure! There is a full version of demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TwAh3/show/\nI can make only for KineticJS if need with code cleaning.\n. In my case looks faster (plus 2-4 fps), but getImageData is still bottleneck function. Not sure can we do something here more. I think I will use the hack in my project. I added it to https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/blob/master/README.md#mobile-tips, because it may be usefull in small set of KineticJS applications.\n. @ericdrowell I mean this hack:\njavascript\n     var oldFunc = this.layer._getIntersection;\n        node.on(\"dragstart\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = function(){\n                return node;\n            }\n        });\n        node.on(\"dragend\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = oldFunc;\n        });\nNot this (@Pe443):\nmoveStage(mousePos) {\n    ... code  ...\n    this._mainStage.draggable(false);\n    setTimeout(() => {\n        this._mainStage.draggable(true);\n    }, 50);\n}\nThere is reason to detect events when you want to drag several nodes at same time by multi touch. (Currently KineticJS has not this support, but I hope it will)\n. Performance may be different depend on type of your application. Canvas on android has many bugs. You should try to use all performace tips available to you. See: https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/blob/master/README.md#performance\n. Close by https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/777.\n. There are no bugs. Here bitwise operation is using for rounding.\nI think Math.round will be much cleaner https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/347e4d697fbc5fd1431e55a9f873b82385d36fd4. It has almost same performance: http://jsperf.com/math-floor-vs-math-round-vs-parseint/2\n. ``` javascript\nfunction isCircleOnScreen(circle) {\n    var center = circle.position(); // you can define center as you need. You may have offset or shape, where x, y of position is not center (as Rect)\n    // then find width and height of shape. Remember that by default group has 0 width and height\n    var width = circle.raduis() * 2;\n    var height = circle.raduis() * 2;\nif (center.x < - width / 2 || center.x > stage.getWidth() + width / 2 || center.y < - height / 2 || center.y > stage.getHeight() + height / 2) {\n    return false;\n} else {\n    return true;\n}\n\n}\n```\n. Can you provide fiddle? I can't reproduce: http://jsbin.com/kaped/1/edit\n. This is browser bug:\n1. https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=161464\n2. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14538743/what-to-do-if-mousemove-and-click-events-fire-simultaneously\n3. https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=312305\nYou can do this trick:\njavascript\nif (!((typeof e.webkitMovementX != 'undefined' || typeof e.webkitMovementY != 'undefined') && e.webkitMovementY === 0 && e.webkitMovementX === 0)) {\n      console.log(\"real mousemove\");\n}\nSee: http://jsbin.com/hequhiya/6/edit\nShould the fix be inside KineticJS? Hmmm....\n. Can you be more specific what problems do you have?\n. Done.\n. You have to add layers to stage BEFORE using moveToTop(), moveToBottom().\nMay be KineticJS should throw error (like \"Add object to container before using this function\") or log warn message in this case.\n. The answer on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22140094/512042. I will close the issue.\n. I don't see any useful use case here, so I am closing the pull.\n. fixed here: http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Filters/Brighten.html\n. You may add viewport meta tag to your html, and install it with your properties.\nI am using this in my application:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,width=device-width,height=device-height,target-densitydpi=medium-dpi,user-scalable=0\"/>\n. I think there is not KineticJS bugs, something with you code. One thing that i found:\njavascript\n        var x = $('form#frmProperties #lineX2').val();\n        var y = $('form#frmProperties #lineY2').val();\nval() returns String not a Number. So code should be:\njavascript\n        var x = parseInt($('form#frmProperties #lineX2').val());\n        var y = parseInt($('form#frmProperties #lineY2').val());\nRepost you question to stackoverfow, if you still have problems.\n. @kzhdev can you write unit test for this?\n. Can you provide any jsfiddle?\n. Try latest build. With this pull (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/777) performance on androind should be much better.\n. context that you have from function parameters is not real canvas context. It is KineticJS's wrapper. Try this (use setAttr):\n``` javascript\nvar reveal=new Kinetic.Shape({\n    drawFunc: function(context){\n        var comprobar=0;\n    context.beginPath();\n    context.setAttr('fillStyle', 'black');\n\n    context.setAttr('globalCompositeOperation', \"destination-out\");\n    for (var i=0;i<arrayaux.length;i++){\n        if (i==primeros[comprobar]){\n\n            context.moveTo(arrayaux[i].x, arrayaux[i].y);\n            comprobar++;\n        }\n        else{\n            context.lineTo(arrayaux[i].x, arrayaux[i].y);\n        }                       \n    }\n    context.closePath();\n    context.fillStrokeShape(this);\n}\n\n});\n```\n. It is very easy to convert dataURL to blob. For example https://gist.github.com/davoclavo/4424731\nI think we shouldn't include this functionality to library.\n. may be this:\njavascript\nwindow.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL;\nTry it. Please, repost you question to stackoverflow if need .\n. Can you provide any jsfiddle demo? This example works as expected for me: http://jsbin.com/jotud/1/edit what about your system?\n. Currently you can't change opacity of cached node. You need clearCache before setting opacity. @ericdrowell look at https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/787 please. It is related with current issue.\n. You are using drawHitFromCache, right? You can:\n1. Create image with opacity 1\n2. Create hit\n3. only THEN set opacity to 0\nSee demo: http://jsbin.com/yaqap/1/edit\n. Oh. Looks like it will not work in this way, because after clearCache hitFunc also cleared\n. You may use ultra hack: set opacity to 0.01 - invisible for you, but visiable for hit! http://jsbin.com/yaqap/2/edit\n. fixed https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/cb52be6dc0e62fa526579762d45e92d08b434d23\n. Just for advertisement try to use debugger plugin: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/658#issuecomment-36724160\nsetSize has another specification:\njavascript\nstage.setSize({\n  width: window.innerWidth,\n  height: this.window.innerHeight\n});\n. Can you provide more information with fiddle? Adding new node while dragging http://jsbin.com/goxon/1/edit\n. Why not. But it will but much easier if you will localize the problem and provide small demo.\n. I tested MultiTouch, works really cool. But I don't believe that native drag drop is slower. Because it have MANY optimizations. Can you provide any demo?\n. Each frame of your sprite may have different width or height.\nWhen you are setting width of Kinetic.Image it is working as scaling, but I think this behavior is not expected for Sprite object. For example we have one sprite with two frames. One has 100 width, another one has 200 width. What you mean, if you are doing sprite.width(150)? \n. Why not to use scaling?\n. javascript\nsprite.scaleX(134/123);\nsprite.scaleY(22/21);\nno?\n. Can you provide any example? This demo is working: http://jsbin.com/lujan/2/edit\n. I see. May be KineticJS should say (throw or warn) that caching Stage is not allowed (it has no his own canvas). Try to cache each Layers: http://jsbin.com/cetosabo/2/edit\njavascript\nstage.on(\"dragstart\", function(){\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer) {\n    layer.cache({\n      x : stage.x(),\n      y : stage.y(),\n      width : stage.width(),\n      height : stage.height()\n    });\n  });\n});\nstage.on(\"dragend\", function(){\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer) {\n    layer.clearCache();\n  });\n  stage.draw();\n});\n. Yep, this is a bug. As workaround until bug is fixed you may also do this:\n``` javascript\nstage.on(\"dragstart\", function(){\n  stage.setScaleX(1);\n  stage.setScaleY(1);\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer) {\n    layer.cache({\n      x : stage.x(),\n      y : stage.y(),\n      width : stage.width(),\n      height : stage.height()\n    });\n  });\n  stage.setScaleX(1.5);\n  stage.setScaleY(1.5);\n});\n```\nhttp://jsbin.com/cetosabo/4/edit\n. Possible way:\n1. Every time you have changes on stage cache it to image, then draw this image to hidden layer.\n2. On dragstart hide every layer except layer with the image.\n3. On dragend hide layer with image and make other layers visible.\n. You have a bug in your code. You are adding layer to stage on button click. But layer is already on stage.\n. What kind of error you are expecting there?\n. Emmm... You want to add error, right? Are you sure? Do not do this! Any program already have a lot of bugs.\najax have error callback because many things may happen: wrong url, no network etc. stage.toDataURL is local function. And it should not have any errors. But if it will it is just KineticJS bug.\n. Actually HammerJS support is not required. You can do this in \"pure\" KineticJS. (http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-multi-touch-scale-stage-with-kineticjs/)\nWith HammerJS example: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/6P4fc/2/\n. Can you post your code example with KineticJS?\n. But I think that tracking event type as a second arguments is good idea. It is not easy to include event type to native event object. For example code:\njavascript\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEOVER, evt, this.targetShape);\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEENTER, evt, this.targetShape);\nHere we have same event object for different events. How to insert event type here? If will do something like this:\njavascript\nevt.kineticEventType = MOUSEOVER;\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEOVER, evt, this.targetShape);\nevt.kineticEventType = MOUSEENTER;\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEENTER, evt, this.targetShape)\nWe will have unexpected behavior in this case:\nnode.on('mouseover',function(e){\n   setTimeout(function(){\n      console.log(e.kineticEventType);  // why mouseenter?\n  });\n});\nWe can clone event object for every event - but this may be expensive action. Thoughts?\n. WOW! I think this is good way. But actually this is VERY BIG API changes. I think many developers use many properties from native event object (as I do). So with this new API I have to do some refactor work. This changes should be documented and described at Change Log very well.\nI updated and tested dispatchEvent and addEventListener (but in this case addEventListener will use old API)\n. This is the bug of new version.\nremove function of BaseLayer Class:\njavascript\nvar stage = this.getStage();\n// then\nif(stage && _canvas && Kinetic.Util._isInDocument(_canvas)) {\n   // bla bla\n}\nstage will be undefined, because while removeChildren function is working it delete parent referance from child node (for performace reasons). I am fixing the bug.\n. Nice. Also we don't need overloaded removeChildren and destroyChildren functions at Stage.js. I think unit test - is best way here.\n. You have to use touches property.\njavascript\n// for example for first finger\nvar clientX = evt.evt.touches[0].clientX;\n. You getting right position. Repost your question to stackoverflow, if it still actual.\n. We can not use adventure options because it will break API. You may use closure compiler with this options for your whole project.\n. Is it working on usual browser?\n. Ok. First try to set timeout to 300ms:\n``` javascript\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage(conf);\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\nstage.add(layer);\nsetTimeout(function(){\n    // add shapes to the layer and then do layer.draw()\n}, 300);\n```\nIf it is not helpful try second (insert before your code):\n``` javascript\nvar updateCanvas = function(canvas){\n    canvas.style.opacity = 0.9;\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        canvas.style.opacity = 1;\n    });\n};\nvar oldDraw = Kinetic.Layer.prototype.draw;\nKinetic.Layer.prototype.draw = function(){\n    updateCanvas(this.canvas._canvas);\n    oldDraw.apply(this, arguments);\n    return this;\n};\n`\n. Currently `KineticJS` supports dragging only for one shape at same time. So I don't understand how both shapes are dragging in you case. May be you are dragging group or layer?\nI will close the issue. Please, go to stackoverflow if you need a help.\n. Look at this demo http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/. Just use image instead of the rectagle.\n. Too much code! Looks like you get wrong json from server. You should:\n1. Save somewhere json that you get from server\n2. Create simplest jsfiddle demo with this json\n3. Post your question to stackoverflow. (I am sure there are no KineticJS bug here)\n. I see `\"className\" : \"Kinetic.Group\"`, but should be\"className\" : \"Group\"in your JSON. After fixing works fine: http://jsbin.com/dibas/1/edit\n. Which problem you mean?\nAlso you should uselayer.draw()instead ofnode.draw()(layer is not clearing in this way).\n. Close via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf\n. Also I want to add some note there. Might be related.\nI was testing KineticJS on desktop with windows 8. Testing device support both mouse and touch manipulations. Mouse events work fine, but touch - no. Also I accidentally discovered that touch event had start working after I addedHammerJS` to stage container.\njavascript\nvar hammer = new Hammer(stage.getContainer());\n. May be we can insert some polyfill to KineticJS? For example https://github.com/WebReflection/ie-touch#ie-touch? Or add some note to documentation (or readme, or wiki, hmmm)?\n. But TouchEvent is not defined in some browsers. http://caniuse.com/touch\n. It is not reproducing on a real device. I tested on ipad 3. So I am not sure it is a bug.\n. What is not correct? What are you expecting?\n. By design scaling don't affect x and y properties, only \"size\" properties - like width, height. Green line is moved because scale affect points property like size properties.\n. 1. No. This information is incorrect. Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/3b14818ac57f658c2f9cc930f19a18095af434bd\n2. How you get this error? Code?\n. You are right. It was bug. Fixed now. Thanks.\n. Can you provide demo? This example works fine: http://jsbin.com/garas/1/edit\n. You are right. My demo using v5.0.1. Same bug with v5.1.0\n. Answered on stackoverflow.\n. When you are executing stage.find('.column') it returns collection (array) of 3 element with name 'column'. Then you are adding click event handler only to this 3 objects. When you are creating more columns they have no such event handler. An you are right - instead of creating new Rect you may clone existent Rect. Cloning action is also copying event handlers.\n. It is not a bug. This is design solution.\n. This is a bug. I will fix it soon.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. This may be helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12886286/addeventlistener-for-keydown-on-canvas\nAlso look at this demo: http://jsbin.com/tojof/1/edit\n. I think best use case is listen all keydown events:\nwindow.addEventListener(\"keydown\", handle, true);\n. Try my demo. I thinks that is what you need.\n. I thinks yes - user should know what stage is current. Also you may focus element on other events: any application event, on scrolling etc.\n. It may be iframe issue. \"Pure\" page works fine: http://jsbin.com/bipociqo/1\n. javascript\nvar node = new Kinetic.Shape({\n  offset : {\n    x : 10,\n    y : 10\n  }\n  // or\n  // offsetX : 10,\n  // offsetY : 10\n});\n. Do you understand warning message?\nLayer's getWidth() and getHeight() return 0 (maybe they should return stage values...). So caching is not working.\n. Currently KineticJS can't handle width or height of groups (or layers) automatically. So you have to calculate them by yourself or use stage size values.\njavascript\nlayer.cache({\n   width : stage.getWidth(),\n   height : stage.getHeight()\n});\n. I think KineticJS should not care about this problem.\n1. The downsized image has \"strange\" quality, but not bad quality\n2. Including such downsizing algorithm may drop performance a lot\n3. Also is is hard to integrate this algorithm when we want to have different from original image width/height ratio.\n4. Also tweening.\nAnytime you can downsize image to canvas element, then pass the canvas to Kinetic.Image\n. Why do use think it is not working?\nUse display : inline-block; css for container.\n. visible is working: http://jsbin.com/buzix/1/edit\nWhy do you need width and height for layer?\n. I will update docs for supported params for FastLayer. If you need to change x or y of FastLayer just change such properties for each children.\nAlso if you will set hitGraphEnabled to false for Layer you will have almost FastLayer.\n. Do you meen color or point position?\n. Can you provide demo?\n. I see. You are resizing stage content manually, don't do this. Because KineticJS can not handle such behaviour. If you need to change size of a stage you should do something like this:\njavascript\nstage.scale({\n   x : scaleFactor,\n   y : scaleFactor\n});\nstage.width(yourWidth);\nstage.height(yourHeight);\nSo. There are no KineticJS bugs here. If you need more information or help, please, repost your question to stackoverflow.\n. Fixed. :+1: \n. Close as answered.\n. Close as issue is not a bug. Use stackoverflow.\n. Create background rectangle and use it for events:\njavascript\nvar text = new Kinetic.Text(config);\nvar back = new Kinetic.Rect({\n x : text.x(),\n y : text.y(),\n width : text.width(),\n height : text.height()\n});\nback.on('mouseleave', callback);\n. This is expected behaviour of cache function.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf. Can you download latest kinetic.js from repo and test?\n. I made unit test for this case. Just for example updated demo works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/fy6LQ/4/\n. Ops...\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I believe this plugin https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/tree/master/debug may help you find problem by yourself. Add https://rawgithub.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/master/debug/kinetic.debug.js after kinetic.js.\n. Can you provide more information about \"losing pixel\"? Screenshots?\n. I have ubuntu with chrome 34 and I don't see any difference. What is your system?\n. I think it is related to https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/819 and https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/750.\n. Interesting. But sometimes user may call draw method for shape (not for whole layer). Also may be it is possible to move such functionality to Context class.\n. I made this test: http://jsperf.com/dh-getimagedata-pixel-by-pixel-or-all-image/5\nIs it correct? I don't see any profit here.\n. I updated test. Looks like performance is much better.\n. May be we can make this in this way:\n1 Clear cache on ANY drawHit (on any node):\nvar layer = this.getLayer()\nif (layer) {\n    layer.hitCache = undefined;\n}\n2 Create hitCache on first (after drawHit) getIntersection call (layer method):\njavascript\nif (this.hitCache) {\n   // get data from cache\n} else {\n    // 1. create hitCache\n    // 2. return this.getIntersection(args);\n}\n. Thanks. I also added unit test https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/acac6e402f98ca5dc4ab662df11b8b8704c6b847#diff-9f8320baecfa172311b90096f1144d7cR297.\n. I disabled such caching awhile. I was testing on big project - it has many side effects. getImageData is very slow if values of width and height are large.\n. Of course it depend on application. If layer has animation - we will call getImageData every mouse move. Also I was testing on iOS. Dragging performance is dropped: when you created stage cache is empty. On dragstart new cache are creating - but that action is very slow.\n. Can you, please, repost your question to stackoverflow?\n. Ok. I will answer you here. Objects are rotating relative to their \"center\" point {x, y}. Your line object has no x and y attrs at configuration - that means they equal 0. So your line rotate relative top left canvas point. You may draw your shape near \"center\" point, then move your shape anywhere by changing x and y attrs (not points array). Also you may use offset attributes to move \"center\". May be demo will be more descriptive then my answear: http://jsbin.com/nuhaf/2/edit\n. Opacity - you are right, it is fixed (test latest build).\nOffset and rotation - are working fine. You need to apply rotation and offset AFTER cache() function is called to get best result or config x, y, width and height arguments of cache function manually.\n. javascript\nhexagon.draw();\nlayer.getContext().setAttr('globalCompositeOperation',\"source-atop\");\nrect.draw();\nhttp://jsbin.com/kufas/1/edit\nI think it is better to use Kinetic.Shape here. Use context.setAttr('globalCompositeOperation',\"source-atop\"); at drawFunc.\n. What is use case? Container may have many children. But any node has only one parent.\nSearch in all parent, grandparent, ...? I don't think this function is very useful.\n. javascript\nnode.visible(state);\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/23787397/512042\n. Float mouse position?! WAT?!\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/23787397/512042\n. Convert it on server side and use converted png on client or look there https://code.google.com/p/canvg/\n. I was not testing. But I guess it should work (library works as parser). https://code.google.com/p/canvg/#Potential_uses\n. You have to move node to tween layer BEFORE creating Tween instance. http://jsfiddle.net/CLBkm/2/\n. Cursor position has no offset. If you scaled stage you should take scale into account when you are creating new line on mousedown. http://jsfiddle.net/448Nc/1/\n. html5 canvas stroke always draws half-inside / half-outside the stroke's path\nThat means you have 2 antialiased pixels stroke.\n. You may add Kinetic.Rect on bottom of you stage with your fill.\n. I am sure that KineticJS should not care about this. You have strange and very specific use case. You may replace layerX and layerY with \"correct\" values while faking events.\n. Looks like you are right. But function _merge is old and currently not using in KineticJS. So i guess it will be removed.\nAlso you should not use private methods (starts with underscore).\n. Yes, site is not working for me too. As I know @ericdrowell is upgrading it.\n. I think dragDistance should be relative to dragBoundFunc. Do you have an example where your behaviour is important?\n. Can you create any jsfiddle?\n. Canvas element still has problems with drawing svg files. Look there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5495952/draw-svg-on-html5-canvas-with-support-for-font-element/5505861#5505861.\n. > it means drawHitFromCache() with Local domain svg is bugged and will never support IE10 ?\nCorrect. Just try not to use svg inside canvas.\nAs workaround use png instead of svg.\n. I don't know ways to solve the bug inside KineticJS.\n. fixed. You may take latest version from from repo. kinetic.js or kinetic.min.js files.\n. Set scale after cache. Or pass width and height params to cache function (\nheight = imageHeight * scaleX, same for width)\n. This is design solution. All transform functions are disabled for FastLayer.\n. fixed\n. Fixed on latest dev version.\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. Can you provide jsfiddle? If you are calling draw on any node (except Layer and Stage) it will not remove \"old\" node from canvas. Just draw new on top of canvas.\n. http://www.zeali.net/mirrors/html5canvastutorials/kineticjs/html5-canvas-events-tutorials-introduction-with-kineticjs/index.html\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. Do you have demo? Test is passing:\njavascript\nvar ring = new Kinetic.Ring({\n          x: stage.getWidth() / 2,\n          y: stage.getHeight() / 2,\n          innerRadius: 50,\n          outerRadius: 90,\n          fill: 'green',\n          stroke: 'black',\n          strokeWidth: 4,\n          draggable: true\n});\nvar clone = ring.clone();\nassert.equal(clone.outerRadius(), ring.outerRadius());\n. Yep. It is strange that you have width, height and outerRadius together. width (and height) should be = outerRadius * 2. Look https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Ring.js#L52. In your case while cloning width (or height) was applying after outerRadius attribute so it was change outerRadius value.\n. Yep. I made small mistake while publishing first version to npm. I can't publish 5.1.0 to npm. So 5.0.6 (on npm) is newer then 5.1.0 (last stable release). Will fixed with new release.\n. While link is not working, It will be very nice if you will make pull requests with any demo to there: https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools#applications\n. Now should work. http://jsbin.com/mitis/3/edit\nA lot of API changes from 4.x version.\n. Can you create unit tests for this?\n. I think it will be better to test with node, not \"private\" method. \n\nFor example you could name a circle: 'red circle' and a square: 'red square', and now stage.find('.red') will return both elements, but stage.find('.square') will return just the square.\n\nThis is VERY good test case.\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. context argument is not native canvas context. It is KineticJS wrapper. Use: context.setAttr('fillStyle', 'red');\n. 1. Try to use latest dev version from master.\n2. Make any jsfiddle.\n. prevent context menu:\njavascript\ndocument.getElementById(\"con\").addEventListener('contextmenu', function (event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n});\nthen listen click or mousedown events:\njavascript\ngroup.on('click', function(e) {\n  if (e.evt.button === 2) {\n    alert('Right click');\n  }\n});\nhttp://jsbin.com/qedez/1/edit\n. New version is not released yet.\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. Closed as not related to KineticJS.\n. Can you provide any fiddle?\nThis one is working with latest build: http://jsbin.com/bivuce/1/edit\n. Fixed.\n. It return this for chainable code:\nlayer.add(rect).add(circle);\n. Do you mean bad performance while dragging?\nTry latest version from master. How it works for you?\n. I don't think this is a bug. Moving canvas from kinetic container is unexpected behaviour.\n. Can you create jsfiddle?\n. Hello, guys! I was contributing to KineticJS awhile. I made many fixed, but I don't want to tag new version as I am not a maintainer. I was thinking about future developing, but for my project KineticJS is on very good state and improving it is not required. May be I will continue contributing soon, just for experience and practicing.\n. FabricJS and EaselJS are very close to KineticJS. If you are developing game - look at PhaserJS\n. As I know all of them have very good support. In my tests EaselJS has very good performance. But it is really depends on type of application, so you should test youself.\n. @confile you can use toImage approach if you have many issues with cache. About Phaser - I guess yes. Go to examples page.\n. Phaser JS is based on Pixi. It adds game specific stuff such as camera, physics, sounds, etc. Do you need it? Yes - Phaser JS. No - Pixi. Also one of the main feature of Pixi (Phaser) against Kinetic, Fabric, Easel is that Pixi have awesome build in WebGL support. So if all of your objects on canvas might be represented as picture - you must try it.\n. I will maintain KineticJS in a fork: https://github.com/lavrton/KineticJS\n. API changes:\njavascript\nvar wave =  new Kinetic.Star({\n  x: 100,\n  y: 200,\n  numPoints: 5,\n  innerRadius: 70,\n  outerRadius: 70,\n  stroke: 'black',\n  strokeWidth: 4,\n  fillLinearGradientStartPoint: {\n    x : 0, y : 0\n  },\n  fillLinearGradientEndPoint: {x : 20, y : 20},\n  fillLinearGradientColorStops: [0, \"#EA493B\", 1, \"#E32486\"]\n});\nhttp://jsbin.com/toqexe/1/edit\n. Also you can get documentation from downloads: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/releases\n. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/api/Kinetic.html\n. Hello everyone. I decided to create a fork. As a contributor of current repo I think I can support KineticJS in a new fork. Repo and link will be ready in ~ one week.\n. @confile agree, PIXI (and Phaser) is really great. But it is different framework. In my opinion PIXI is best for games. But if you need a lot of \"vector\" graphics (such as text) you will have problems. This is my experience. I was thinking to move to Phaser in my main mind map application. In the app I need to draw a lot of nodes (with text) on canvas. It is possible to create custom graphics with PIXI. But for each graphics PIXI has separate canvas element in memory (You can not just draw text into webgl context, you have to convert text to image first, then you can display that image). So I had big memory leak. I was not able to find solution for this case.\n. Hello everyone. I made a fork. https://github.com/konvajs/konva\nThe homepage is http://konvajs.github.io/\n. Ops. I am really sad to see this... Waiting Eric's answer.\n. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/releases/download/v5.1.0/documentation.zip\n. All forks may be merged in any repo (as in personal as in org).\nBut sure that is might be very good idea. Are there any other active forks?\nPS: hmm. all good name already taken.\n. As it is hart to evolve project under old name I decided to rename fork to Konva project. Fork is available in this organization: https://github.com/konvajs\n. What an issue? Second tap event is not expected?\n. Usual DOM works is same way: http://jsbin.com/tejohe/1/edit?html,js,output.\nSecond tap is still tap event, so event should be fired.\nYou can implement simple workaround:\n``` javascript\nvar wasDblClick = false;\nrect.on('click tap', function() {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n         if (wasDblClick) {\n             wasDblClick = false;\n             return;\n         }\n          console.log('click');\n}, 10);\n});\nrect.on('dblclick dbltap', function() {\n  wasDblClick = true;\n  console.log('dblclick');\n});\n``\n.var dbltap = false;should be outside ofwireKineticEventSafefunction.\n. Works nice for me: http://jsbin.com/bipoke/13/edit?js,output\n. Now sure how long it will be available here: http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/api/\nBut I suggest you to switch to KineticJS fork: http://konvajs.github.io/\n. @zuoRambo right. + template https://github.com/terryweiss/docstrap\n. I think for current moment KineticJS has almost full support of NodeJS. All tests is passing. Seenodejs-demo.jsfile as example.\n. If you needmoveTonode to another layer ondragstart` you may do this:\njavascript\nrect.on(\"dragstart\",function(){\n  rect.stopDrag();\n  rect.moveTo(tempLayer);\n  rect.startDrag();\n  layer.draw();\n});\nrect.on(\"dragend\",function(){\n  rect.moveTo(layer);\n});\n. Currently stage.toDataURL should work as expected. If you still have problems, please, provide jsfiddle example.\n. Currently stage.toDataURL should work as expected. If you still have problems, please, provide jsfiddle example.\n. Resolved on fork. https://github.com/lavrton/KineticJS\n. http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/bKq2y/2/ Tested with FireFox 27. Works fine. Reopen if need.\n. I don't think that Kinetic should be hidden from global namespace while using AMD. It is easier to use KineticJS with third party plugins if Kinetic in global namesapce (for example BackboneJS do same thing).\nAdding UMD patter to each plugin (or module) is defently bad idea. returnExports is fixed, thx!\n. I added this with nodejs support commit.\n. You should not use fill configuration for images. Use fillPatternImage instead. This example http://jsbin.com/hohir/1/edit demonstrate that in this case toJSON will work.\n. Not yet. @ericdrowell I think this feature must be with highest priority after FastLayer.\n. I made a demo with drop events support (drop, dragenter, dragleave, dragover). http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Drag_and_Drop/Drop_Events.html\n. All suggestions are resolved. I added proportional feature to TODO list. I will close the issue. If need, please, create separate issues for features, bugs.\n. close by https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/16511a9aefa28eb1102fe85b39335359e4cf3c6a\n. Does it work now?\n. Close via https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/0b93e21e0b9e11165dfed7574dbafa0ae2a144e0.\njavascript\nKinetic.dragDistance = 5;\n// or\nnode.dragDistance(5);\n. Currently works as expected http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/CxgPN/2/.\nReopen if you have problems.\n. I tested examples (IE9) and for now they works very well.\n. I think the issue is not actual with latest KineticJS version and new cache mechanism. Please, reopen if need.\n. What you expected here? Rectangle is bigger than image. Please, repost your question to stackoverflow.\n. Is this workaround working for you?\njavascript\nimage.onload = function() {\n  if (!image.complete) {\n    image.src = image.src;\n    return;\n  }\n  // Insert your code here\n};\n. I think that including such workaround with try:\njavascript\ntry {\n        if(a.length === 5) {\n            context.drawImage(a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4]);\n        }\n        else if(a.length === 9) {\n            context.drawImage(a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7], a[8]);\n        }\n} catch(err) {}\nis bad idea. Thoughts:\n1. It may break performance\n2. Unexpected \"invisible\" image.\nIf you want to check is image is ok, you may do this:\njavascript\nlayer.add(image);\ntry {\n  layer.draw();\n} catch (e) {\n  // ops...\n}\n. Also you can use this small snippet:\njavascript\nif (Kinetic.UA.browser === \"mozilla\") {\n        var originDraw = Kinetic.Context.prototype.drawImage;\n        Kinetic.HitContext.prototype.drawImage = Kinetic.SceneContext.prototype.drawImage = function() {\n          try {\n            originDraw.apply(this, arguments);\n          } catch (e) {\n             console.log(e);\n          }\n        };\n      }\n. Please, reopen if problem still exists and you have code example.\n. Hey! I will close the issue. I can't reproduce the problem on my Ubuntu station. So many chrome version was published after this issue, so I think problem is resolved. If not, please, reopen issue!\n. Problem is resolved. I will close the issue.\n. The problem was with firefox browser, and currnly is solved. Issue is closed.\n. Is this issue actual? You can define dash property of line as you wish, so line may look like  transition from one dash array to another.\n. Currently onFinish callback will be called even if node is destroyed. (with using Tween API )\n. Close as duplicate https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/193\n. The issue is resolved. If you still have problems post your question on stackoverflow.\n. Currently drag&drop is going on the same layer. So this problem is not actual. I will close the issue.\n. With new KineticJS version timeDiff (in Kinetic.Animation callback) will be  floating-point number too.\n. As transitionTo is deprecated by Tween class, problem still exists. Currently this will not work:\njavascript\nvar tween = new Kinetic.Tween({\n node : node,\n duration : 1,\n offset: {\n  x : 2,\n  y : 2\n }\n});\ntween.play();\n. I think that information that Tween is not support objects should be placed at documentation.\n. Issue can be closed, because currently nodes are dragging on same layer.\n. Should be fixed.\n. Can't reproduce bug with latest version: http://jsbin.com/xoqex/1/edit\n. I will close the issue. If it still actual for you, please, reopen with jsfiddle example.\n. @dchhetri , it is not working, because if call draw, it also call drawHit. Result: you have backgroud on bottom, line on top, so mouseup will fire on line shape, but not on background. As I know, Kineticjs has specal canvas for events. If you are calling \"layer.drawScene\", this canvas is not updating, so events for line not fire, but fire for background.\n. Also If you need some events on stage you can use this tip. Create invisible background rectangle and listen events on it (or in stage, while events are bubbling):\njavascript\nvar back = new Kinetic.Rect({\n    draggable : true,\n    // disable move on dragging\n    dragBoundFunc : function() {\n        return {x : 0, y : 0};\n    }\n});\nlayer.add(back);\nback.on(\"click tap\", () => { \n    // some code\n});\n. Resolved issue. I will close it.\n. Currenly KineticJS works fine with AMD. I will close the issue.\n. I think issue can be closed. Currently opera works as expected.\n. If you need validation you may try to use debugging plugin: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/658#issuecomment-36724160\n. Clone method now don't clone id. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5db9115a09e22dea2d0f0b97296ec9131addd70\n. Now you can do this with drawHitFromCache function using alphaThreshold parameter.\n. Demo for bug: http://jsbin.com/cuqas/1/edit\nOk for rect, not ok for text.\n. Hit canvas is not updating while dragging (for performance reasons).\nAs a workaround you may draw layer on dragend.\njavascript\nkItems.lowerLayer.on(\"dragend\", function() {\n    kItems.upperLayer.draw();  // or just drawHit()\n});\nUpdated demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/37pG3/1/\n. Fixed at fork. https://github.com/lavrton/KineticJS\n. Currently it is fixed.\n. Thanks! But perfomance is bad for me. Waiting for native support.\n. Close as duplicate https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/193\n. v5.0.1 dblcick event works: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/a69V9/\nBut this is bad use case, because dblcick, actually, should not trigger on circle. Because after each click a new circle is created, so second click happens on NEW node.\n. Your use case is very strange. You should not use \"private\" properties. Please, repost you question to stackoverflow, if it still actual.\n. You may add text to layer before converting.\nOr you have to set {x, y} in toImage params: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TMML9/1/\n. Should be resolved with latest version. Also with this fix https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/6c46e44bbd2ba88fd3d8f63f71d8f9fa1606f8a1\n. http://jsfiddle.net/ajzhG/40/\nThis demo will not work on ipad3 with retina display.\nBecause KineticJS automatically resolve high resolution device and increase canvas size twice.\nIf you don't need such behaviour use this:\njavascript\nKinetic.pixelRatio = 1;\n. Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/74060ce9355a8d977ac7da5ebdddd426a7331293\n. ```\nclass Navigation{\n     myOtherClass: MyOtherClass;\n constructor(myOtherClass){\n     this.myOtherClass = myOtherClass;\n     this.wireEvents();\n }\n\n wireEvents(){\n     var that = this;\n     this.buttonPrevious.on(\"click\", function(): void {\n         that.myOtherClass.myFunction();\n     });\n}\n\n}\n```\n. similar: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/411\n. I will close the issue. Currently there are no errors with multitouch - shape just stops dragging. There is issue for full multitouch drag support: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/411\n. I think then preventing event propagation to DOM is bad idea.\n. As one way:\njavascript\nimage.on('dragend', function(e){\n  $(e.evt.target).data('dragend', Date.now());\n});\n$('#con').on('click', function(e){\n  var time = $(e.target).data('dragend');\n  if (Date.now() - time < 2) {\n    console.log('prevent')\n  } else {\n    console.log('click');\n  }\n});\nhttp://jsbin.com/pulof/1/edit\n. @nicktgr15 try latest version from master branch.\n. This chrome issue is resolved. Closing it!\n. Instead of this:\njavascript\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage(conf);\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\nstage.add(layer);\n// other stuff\nWe have to do this:\njavascript\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage(conf);\nsetTimeout(function(){\n  var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\n  stage.add(layer);\n  // other stuff\n}, 50);\n@ericdrowell , am I right?\n. 1 You may try to use throttle function http://underscorejs.org/#throttle (or any alternative) to save performance\njavascript\nstage.on('contentTouchmove', _.throttle(function(evt) {\n  layer.moveToTop();\n}, 300);\n2 Also look at other hacks: http://slash-system.com/en/how-to-fix-android-html5-canvas-issues/\n. getTextWidth is fixed. Currently getTextHeight returns fontSize, if you need multiline support use getHeight instead.\n. +1 May be create special \"arrow\" shape?\n. I will close this issue. If you still have problems, please, create jsfiddle to demonstrate problem and reopen issue.\n. I think we should not do this. Main reason is event bubbling. User may listen events on parent, not on shape. So library code will be too complicated if we will add such functionality. It is MUCH easier to manually use shape.listening(false)\n. I am closing the issue as you have an answer on stackoverflow. I am not sure can we do something here with KineticJS codebase.\n. Looks like problem is resolved.\n. Currently KineticJS has bower sopport.\n. Also it solves this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17002932/extend-kinetc-shape-and-all-derived-shapes\n. I will close this issue. If you still have problems with latest KineticJS, please, provide jsfiddle as demo.\n. Clone method now don't clone id. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5db9115a09e22dea2d0f0b97296ec9131addd70\n. I can't reproduce with latest version. Reopen if problem still exists.\n. Using KineticJS in this case is incorrect. You should not draw to context manualy by yourself (excepts using custom shape and related use cases: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shape-tutorial/ ).\n. It works as expected with latest version.\n. Such behavior maybe unexpected, but DOM elements are working in the same way. See demo: http://jsbin.com/poqec/1/edit\n@ThomasRuby children are not placed in the stage after group.remove(). removeChildren just prevent event bubbling, so mouseleave will be fired on mouse, but not in group, because circle is not in group any more.\n. Problem still exists. I made small fiddle for demonstration: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/h927F/\n. Fixed at fork. https://github.com/lavrton/KineticJS\n. Currently KineticJS (v5.0.1) has not support of this.\nYou can do this:\n- Find intersection by yourself. (You have to know math very good)\n- Or you may place node on different layers, then loop over all points of layers and check intersection with node. (getIntersection function).\n. Can't reproduce with latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/huLJ9/1/\nReopen if need.\n. Reopen if need with demo.\n. The issue must go away with latest chrome and kineticjs. If not, please, reopen issue with jsfiddle example.\n. Bug fix for this issue is closed, because solution already in code, so I will close the issue.\n. See: http://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Node.html#filters\n. Now you can do this:\njavascript\nnode.cache();\nnode.filters([Kinetic.Filters.Invert]);\n. Should work as expected. Reopen with fiddle if need.\n. Works as expected with latest version. http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/GFRNz/\n. Now you may use grunt docs\n. Please cleanup your question if it still actual. And repost your question to stackoverflow.\n. I will close the issue as old Chrome related bug. For now everything should be fine. Reopen if need.\n. All Chrome related issues should be fixed with new Chrome releases. Reopen if problem still exists.\n. This is browser bug. See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18430482/html5-canvas-text-stroke-for-large-font-size-not-drawn-properly\nKIneticJS can do nothing here. As a workaround you may scale a text.\n. If you need to take clip region into account you should use parent's draw function: group.draw() or layer.draw()\n. Also I think it will be very helpful to create page with kineticjs related stuff such as: ide tools, snippets, articles, plugins, tips, etc.\nMy suggestion: create special github repo \"KineticJS stuff\", with readme file with this related information.\nIt is very easy to add new plugins, articles via pull request in this case.\nFor example I created Backbone plugin that helps me work with KineticJS. May be it can be usefull for someone else.\n. Also someone created this interesting tool: https://github.com/soloproyectos/jquery.transformtool\nDemo: http://jsfiddle.net/cequiel/hkjtM/\n. Now sprite.start() works as expected. Also I added isRunning method for sprite object. (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/53ac9329de63d01f11822975a17932828085e877)\n. If you know coordinates of your line you can calculate coordinates of text manually. If this question is still actual, please, post it to stackoverfow.\n. :+1: Really need to such stuff as detect drop shape. I think best realisation is events \"dragover\", \"dragout\".\n. You can move draggable shape to temporary layer on dragstart, then call getIntersection to detect collision. See demo: http://jsbin.com/pecor/1/edit\n. I think we should implement easy way to change layer while dragging and add drawHitOnDrag configuration.\nAs dirty workaroud look there: http://jsbin.com/pecor/3/edit\n. I believe I found the problem. Original issue is fixed.\nBut we have new issue with cache system: http://jsfiddle.net/LwRnj/49/. Problem is related to aliasing. KineticJS is taking aliasing into account. But only for 1 pixel. If you will cache node then scale it a lot, aliasing area will bigger than 1 pixel.\nCurrently I have no idea how to fix problem in this case... Your thoughts, guys?\n. Close via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf\nCheck again, please, with your system. Reopen if need.\n. I have an interesting bug too. Performance is really good on landskape mode. But it is very poor on portrait mode. I will try to localize this bug with jsfiddle example.\n. Jsfiddle for tests: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/JYqJp/2/show/ (from kineticjs lab)\nYou can try landskape mode. Then go to  portrait mode and refresh the page.\n. I am closing the issue as this is not KineticJS bug.\nChange pixel ratio for better performance:\njavascript\nKinetic.pixelRatio = 1;\n. @icaliman look there https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/654#issuecomment-40284966\n. I tested with latest KineticJS version. Works as expected: http://jsbin.com/dixup/1/edit\n. I believe problem is resolved with last commit (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf). @kzhdev can you test on your last demo? Reopen issue if need.\n. I will close the issue. If you still need help, please repost question to stackoverflow with more specific information.\n. destroyChildren works fine. If you still have problems, please, reopen the issue with more specific information and jsfiddle demo.\n. Close as fixed.\n. Works as expected with v5.0.1\n. I think this is a bad idea to use many libraries in the same canvas.\nFor example kineticjs take full controll of canvas element. It can clean and redraw it whatever it want.\nAlso kineticjs has good mechanism with layers and creating more canvases for performance reasons.\n. You may use offset for this purpose. Please, post your question to stackoverflow if you still have it.\n. You can use Kinetic.Shape to draw object with context access. See example: http://jsbin.com/kixeq/2/edit \n. Works for me for latest kineticjs version with requirejs.\n. May be helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11929099/html5-canvas-drawimage-ratio-bug-ios\n. Hello, folks! Update on this thread. As we know this is a REAL bug of iOS webview. And as @ericdrowell said it may be dangerous to include such workarounds to KineticJS codebase.\nBUT! I found very good solution. You should know, that you can pass not only Image objects to Kinetic.Image. Also you may pass <canvas> element! So there is working way:\n1. Create special 'buffer' canvas (with same size as original image)\n2. Draw the image into the canvas with some extra workarounds\n3. Create Kinetic.Image with the canvas.\nCode:\n``` javascript\n    // detect scale ratio\n    function detectVerticalSquash(img) {\n      var iw = img.width, ih = img.height;\n      var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n      canvas.width = 1;\n      canvas.height = ih;\n      var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n      ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);\n      var data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, ih).data;\n      // search image edge pixel position in case it is squashed vertically.\n      var sy = 0;\n      var ey = ih;\n      var py = ih;\n      while (py > sy) {\n          var alpha = data[(py - 1) * 4 + 3];\n          if (alpha === 0) {\n              ey = py;\n          } else {\n              sy = py;\n          }\n          py = (ey + sy) >> 1;\n      }\n      var ratio = (py / ih);\n      return (ratio===0)?1:ratio;\n    }\n// create canvas to replace with image\nfunction generateCanvas(image){\n    var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n    var context = canvas.getContext('2d');\n    canvas.width = image.width;\n    canvas.height = image.height;\n    var vertSquashRatio = detectVerticalSquash(image);\n    console.log(image);\n    context.drawImage(image, 0, 0, \n                       image.width, image.height / vertSquashRatio);\n    return(canvas);\n}\n\nvar img = new Image();\nimg.onload = function() {\n  var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n      container: 'con',\n      width: 1000,\n      height: 1000\n  });\n  var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\n  stage.add(layer);\n  var image = new Kinetic.Image({\n    image : generateCanvas(img),\n    width : 200,\n    height : 200,\n    draggable : true\n  });\n  layer.add(image);\n  layer.draw();\n}\nimg.src = 'diana2.jpg';\n\n```\nI tested this code on iPad, and it is fixing the bug. Can someone approve?\n. @icaliman I tested my solution on iPad - and problem was gone. Do you have any errors?\n. What is value of vertSquashRatio? What are you expecting? Did you try my way with replacing image object by fixed canvas object?\n. 0.375 is not correct? May be wrong calculation if image has transparent area on left edge.\n. Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/6c46e44bbd2ba88fd3d8f63f71d8f9fa1606f8a1\n. I think too that kineticjs must have ways to detect such probems. For example:\nKinetic.setDebugLevel(\"all\");\n. KineticJS has no validation of parameters for performance reasons. But is some cases validation might be VERY helpful. I was thinking to add some debug mode to KineticJS.\nIn this mode all set methods will be overwriting with validation step. It may slow down performance, but this is just developer tool and you will be able to do something like Kinetic.debugModeOff().\nWhat do you think?\n. Good news everyone!\nI made this small script to support full validation of parameters for KineticJS.\nhttps://gist.github.com/lavrton/9363432\nUsage:\n1. Add kinetic.debug.js script after kinetic.js in your html\n2. Somewhere in your code: Kinetic.debugModeOn();\nSee example: http://jsbin.com/kujef/1/edit\nIs it awesome?\n. Plugin is available there https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/tree/master/debug\n. Looks like bug is fixed with latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/mTZEP/1/\n. Now works fine: http://jsbin.com/kojaci/1/edit. Reopen if issue still exists.\n. As expected. toImage is async function. You should use img inside callback function.\n@ericdrowell, I think you should remove from docs var image = because it can lead to confusion.\n. Use Kinetic.Util.extend\n. A layer is creating new canvas element. This is expected behaviors. You should carefully read http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-layer-management-with-kineticjs/\n. Works fine : http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/T43NK/1/\n. Ups, sorry, my mistake. Setting width of text is working as max width, right?\n. Works with latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/44reA/1/\n. API for now is\nvar html = new Kinetic.HTML({\n    html : \"<content>\",\n    callback : function() {}   //callback here is bad\n});\nMay be it wiil be more usefull with this API:\nKinetic.htmlToImage({\n    html : \"<content>\",\n    callback : function(img) {\n       var image = new Kinetic.Image({\n           image : img\n       });\n   }\n});\n. Also, if someone interesting, this may be helpfull: https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas\n. I added pinch event to my project (that is using kineticjs).\nI made first implemantation from here: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-multi-touch-scale-stage-with-kineticjs/\nBut I had some problems, so I moved to using hammer.js. It so easy and clean http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/\nMy code example:\n``` javascript\n//get stage document element and listen it\nvar transformer = Hammer(this.getStage().getContainer());    \nvar startScale = null;\ntransformer.on(\"transformstart\", function(e) {\n  startScale = _this.getCamera().getScale();\n});\ntransformer.on(\"transform\", function(e) {\n  return _this.getCamera().setScale(startScale * e.gesture.scale);\n  // or stage.setScale(...) or... Whatever you want\n});\n```\nYou can do the same for swipe event.\n. That is because hammer.js know nothing about kineticjs objects. It can't pass kineticjs targer node in event param.\nAll is posible here is define or find target node by youself.\n. HammerJS support for KineticJS's nodes will be added with next release. See example: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/\n. I added pull request https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/684 with new test.\n. How to try multitouch on object? Scale, move?\nKineticJS currently handle only one touch for dragging.\n. Of couse I can add shape to some cache layer.\nBut I will still have problems if shape size is bigger than stage size.\nShape wil be cutted: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TFW9T/1/\n(But (!) will not cuted with not shadow and stroke: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TFW9T/2/)\n. For tests: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/T43NK/6/\nAs @CyranX said :  try to drag red rect to top left corner.\n. In my machine latest example http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/T43NK/6/ (Chrome) works as expected. I will close the issue.\n. Fixed.\n. The error is somewhere else.\nProperty position doesn't matter. http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/7BjGg/\n. Currently with Chrome 33 examples work as expected. I think Chrome problem is resolved and I can close the issue.\n. run grunt dev before opening page.\n. Now you can apply filters in order you want: http://jsbin.com/novej/1/edit\n. You can convert shape to image with toImage function then apply filter.\n. Now you can use filters for all shapes. I will close the issue.\n. You may use event.changedTouches.length\n. Lates version works as expected.\n. I will close the issue. If it still actual for you, please, repost it to stackoverflow. (Demo works fine, just clarify what you are expecting)\n. remove function is not destroying object, only remove it from parent container. You should use destroy if you want permanently kill object. Post you question to stackoverfow if you still have problems.\n. Hmm.. Looks like browsers have very bad support of toBlob function.\n. Awesome! @ericdrowell please look at this. I think it is important request. It is VERY hard to do dbltap on some devices, because every time you tapped on node it is moving little bit, and that is prevent tap and dbltap. I set dragDistance = 3 in my main application. Much better.\njavascript\nKinetic.dragDistance = 3;\n// or\nnode.dragDistance(3);\n. Fixed via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/e5db9115a09e22dea2d0f0b97296ec9131addd70\n. Fixed. Thx.\n. You should not set node's zIndex before adding to container. Only after.\nFix: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/cadcb91fbc368d129c6a9e7261276625d1cd1d8c  Now zIndex will be ignored (with warn message) in this case.\n. You can cancel event propagation in this way:\njavascript\nrect.on(\"dragstart\", function(e){\n  e.cancelBubble = true;\n});\n. Actually, if you REALLY need this you can do some javascript hacks with Function constructor (still bad way, because JSON - is only data, no code!):\n``` javascript\nKinetic.Rect.prototype.toJSONFull = function() {\n    var obj = this.toObject();\n    obj.attrs.dragBoundFunc = this.getDragBoundFunc();\n    return JSON.stringify(obj, function (key, value) {\n        if (typeof value === 'function') {\n            return value.toString();\n        }\n        return value;\n    });\n};\nKinetic.Node.createFixed = function(json, container) {\n        var passed = JSON.parse(json, function (key, value) {\n            if (value \n                && typeof value === \"string\" \n                && value.substr(0,8) == \"function\") {\n                var startBody = value.indexOf('{') + 1;\n                var endBody = value.lastIndexOf('}');\n                var startArgs = value.indexOf('(') + 1;\n                var endArgs = value.indexOf(')');\n           return new Function(value.substring(startArgs, endArgs)\n                             , value.substring(startBody, endBody));\n        }\n        return value;\n    });\n    return this._createNode(passed, container);\n\n};\n```\nThen using:\njavascript\nvar rect2 = Kinetic.Node.createFixed(rect.toJSONFull());\nExample: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/7chvS/\n. I can't reproduce the bug. Please, reopen the issue if you still have problems.\n. Do you use offset? Looks like yes, because after scale image should be placed at same position (same top left point). May be you need to take offset into account.\n. Can't reproduce: http://jsbin.com/nonul/1/edit\n. After some time and testing I will make pull request to https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped\n. I found one more. Without pull request: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Node.js#L118\nshowBorder -> drawBorder\n. Hint errors are resolved.\n. I can't reproduce the bug (Chrome Version 33.0.1750.117) http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/k8zf5/4/. Reopen if need, please.\n. :+1: @ericdrowell, your thoughts?\n. Are you sure that quality of non-cached shapes is bad? Everything is good for me. (tested on iPad)\n. There are two dependencies need for NodeJS: jsdom and canvas.\n1. We need to add them to package.json\n2. Change travis configuration to install only dev dependiences.\n3. Publish KineticJS to npm.\n@ericdrowell, can you do this?\n. grunt dev\n. npm install kinetic\n. Firefox don't understand color like 590b0a only #590b0a, but chrome understand.\n@ericdrowell, is it expected behavior:\nKinetic.Util._rgbToHex(89, 11, 10)\n\"590b0a\"\n. Sure, for 10 items, right? Try to add more by clicking on stage. See fps and compare with other examples.\n. You right. it may use WebGL. But in my tests browser has no WebGL support, so Pixi was using 2d canvas.\n. Yah, more tutorials! I wrote some tips, that you already noticed: https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools#performance (like transformsEnabled and hitGraphEnabledparams).\n. I updated fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Yc73v/6/) with transformsEnabled: 'position', hitGraphEnabled: false and using previous position API (getX, setX) instead of overloaded. Better, but not to much. (+ 5 fps for 1000 BUNNIES in my machine)\n. With new cache function from v5.0.0 KineticJS getting much faster.\n. No need after HammerJS support.\n. Wait until image loaded:\njavascript\nvar heating_on3= new Image();\nheating_on3.src = \"icons/heating_on.png\";\nheating_on3.onload = function() {\n    this.heating = new Kinetic.Rect({\n        x: 100,\n        y: 200,\n        height: 100,\n        width: 100,\n        fillPatternImage: heating_on3,\n        stroke:\"black\",\n        strokeWidth:10\n    });    \n};\n@ericdrowell, I think KineticJS should have some out of the box ways to wait loading.\n. Really looks like a bug. You must set fillPatternScaleX and fillPatternScaleY:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/33Zet/1/\n. @ericdrowell,\njavascript\nKinetic.Factory.addGetterSetter(Kinetic.Shape, 'fillPatternScaleX', 0);\nShould it be:\njavascript\nKinetic.Factory.addGetterSetter(Kinetic.Shape, 'fillPatternScaleX', 1);\n?\n. Tested with latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Vm52D/\nWoks fine everywhere. Can you make a fiddle example?\n. Looks like a bug. Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/uT5Zb/\n. http://web.archive.org/web/20130917231605/http://kineticjs.com/docs/ :+1: \n. Look at this demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/show\nTry to transform with multitouch! Awesome, is it?\nSo easy to setup:\n``` javascript\nvar startScale = 1;\nvar startRotate = 0;\nvar hammertime = Hammer(rect)\n.on(\"transformstart\", function(e) {\n    startScale = rect.scaleX();\n    startRotate = rect.rotation();\n}).on(\"transform\", function(e) {\n    rect.scale({\n        x : startScale * e.gesture.scale,\n        y : startScale * e.gesture.scale,\n    });\n    rect.rotation(startRotate + e.gesture.rotation)\n});\n```\n. Updated for swipe event. http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/show\n. What you mean \"it's hard\"? Do you mean it is hard to implement all multitouch events INSIDE KineticJS?\nIn example above you may test that all events are supported via hammerjs. (and some little patch to kineticjs). I will make pull request for this soon.\n. No. It is only adding more events for one node.\n. Done: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/61542ea6cce360218a7a34f50d749d00411c5438\nBut currently it is not possible to remove specific handler:\njavascript\nhammerInstance.off(\"event\", handler);\nyou may use namespace for this case:\njavascript\nhammerInstance.off(\"event.namespace\");\n. I think this is good workflow. I also added same behaviour for touchmove. That will increase dragging performance on some android devices a lot (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/821)! Thanks!\n. May be it will be useful if group will find width by itself.\n. You can use node.strokeEnabled function.\n. javascript\nstage.setSize({\n   width : params.width,\n   height : params.height\n});\n. My thoughts:\n1. Do not use cache - each cache function is new canvas element in memory.\n2. Try to use as less number of layers as possible. 75 - is TOO MANY! I think that 10 is max.\n. I don't think this is useful commit:\n1. We have very good support for requestAnimationFrame http://caniuse.com/requestanimationframe\n2. You will get wrong behaviour if you call multiple FRAF at once. Example:\n``` javascript\nvar callback = function() {\n    console.log(Date.now());\n}\nfor (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n    FRAF(callback);\n}\n```\n. Please, repost your question to stackoverflow with jsfiddle example.\n. Hint errors are resolved.\n. http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-shape-tutorial/\n. Thank you! I think this algorithm https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/807 is much cleaner and easier to understood; so I added it.\n. Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/a524ba9ec12fc23fbb774739947c567628752c4f\n. Thx! https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/3a5b6eb76618a8b5bb6bca6bfafb6fe9e06fac2a\n. Close via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf\nCheck again, please, with your system. Reopen if need.\n. API changes:\njavascript\nstage.setScale({\n x : scale,\n y : scale\n});\nstage.setSize({\n  width : width,\n  height : height\n});\n. Looks like tutorial is not updated (@ericdrowell, please look at this).  It is not working on my device.\n. stage.setSize({\n  width : newWidth,\n  height : newHeight\n});\n. You may prevent using cache() function for Image but hit graph will have rectangle shape in this case. It is not possible to create hit graph with same shape as image without cache().\n@m73 currently cached node does not support changing opacity value. Will be fixed soon.\n. Bug here. Opacity will be applied twice (if cached object already has opacity).\n. May be we can reset opacity before caching (cache function):\njavascript\nvar prevOpacity = this.getOpacity();\nthis.setOpacity(1);\nthis.drawScene(cachedSceneCanvas);\nthis.drawHit(cachedHitCanvas);\nthis.setOpacity(prevOpacity);\nthen apply opacity to cache\n. close by https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/cb52be6dc0e62fa526579762d45e92d08b434d23\n. You should not touch built in methods of KineticJS's nodes. Just use another variable\n. Thx. But I think this is very specific use case. You can do this manually. As example:\njavascript\nvar isOk = true;\nstage.getChildren().each(function(layer){\n    if (!layer.toDataURL()) {\n        isOk = false;\n    }\n});\nif (!isOk) {\n   // something\n}\n. I made this set of tests for different ways of drawing objects: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TwAh3/show/\nNo difference on desktop, but different on android devices.\nAlso I founde little hack that helps solve subject :\njavascript\n        var oldFunc = this.layer._getIntersection;\n        node.on(\"dragstart\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = function(){\n                return node;\n            }\n        });\n        node.on(\"dragend\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = oldFunc;\n        });\nUsual usage: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Yp8gP/show/\nWith hack: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/ANJ98/show/\nDo you feel difference on android devices?\n. This problem is relative to drag&drop. While dragging, every touchmove event will call getIntersectrion function. By design of KineticJS intersections are finding via native context getImageData function. As I explained at first post problem only on android devices, where this function (getImageData) is slow.\n. Profiling on Asus Transformer TF101G (Android). (while dragging one star)\nUsual Kinetic usage (http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/Yp8gP/show/):\n\nAfter disable _getIntersection (http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/ANJ98/show/) (plus 5-10 fps):\n\n. > no don't do that, you're essentially indirectly throttling the event detection.\nDo you mean my small hack?\n. Sure! There is a full version of demo: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/TwAh3/show/\nI can make only for KineticJS if need with code cleaning.\n. In my case looks faster (plus 2-4 fps), but getImageData is still bottleneck function. Not sure can we do something here more. I think I will use the hack in my project. I added it to https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/blob/master/README.md#mobile-tips, because it may be usefull in small set of KineticJS applications.\n. @ericdrowell I mean this hack:\njavascript\n     var oldFunc = this.layer._getIntersection;\n        node.on(\"dragstart\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = function(){\n                return node;\n            }\n        });\n        node.on(\"dragend\", () => {\n            this.layer._getIntersection = oldFunc;\n        });\nNot this (@Pe443):\nmoveStage(mousePos) {\n    ... code  ...\n    this._mainStage.draggable(false);\n    setTimeout(() => {\n        this._mainStage.draggable(true);\n    }, 50);\n}\nThere is reason to detect events when you want to drag several nodes at same time by multi touch. (Currently KineticJS has not this support, but I hope it will)\n. Performance may be different depend on type of your application. Canvas on android has many bugs. You should try to use all performace tips available to you. See: https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/blob/master/README.md#performance\n. Close by https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/777.\n. There are no bugs. Here bitwise operation is using for rounding.\nI think Math.round will be much cleaner https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/347e4d697fbc5fd1431e55a9f873b82385d36fd4. It has almost same performance: http://jsperf.com/math-floor-vs-math-round-vs-parseint/2\n. ``` javascript\nfunction isCircleOnScreen(circle) {\n    var center = circle.position(); // you can define center as you need. You may have offset or shape, where x, y of position is not center (as Rect)\n    // then find width and height of shape. Remember that by default group has 0 width and height\n    var width = circle.raduis() * 2;\n    var height = circle.raduis() * 2;\nif (center.x < - width / 2 || center.x > stage.getWidth() + width / 2 || center.y < - height / 2 || center.y > stage.getHeight() + height / 2) {\n    return false;\n} else {\n    return true;\n}\n\n}\n```\n. Can you provide fiddle? I can't reproduce: http://jsbin.com/kaped/1/edit\n. This is browser bug:\n1. https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=161464\n2. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14538743/what-to-do-if-mousemove-and-click-events-fire-simultaneously\n3. https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=312305\nYou can do this trick:\njavascript\nif (!((typeof e.webkitMovementX != 'undefined' || typeof e.webkitMovementY != 'undefined') && e.webkitMovementY === 0 && e.webkitMovementX === 0)) {\n      console.log(\"real mousemove\");\n}\nSee: http://jsbin.com/hequhiya/6/edit\nShould the fix be inside KineticJS? Hmmm....\n. Can you be more specific what problems do you have?\n. Done.\n. You have to add layers to stage BEFORE using moveToTop(), moveToBottom().\nMay be KineticJS should throw error (like \"Add object to container before using this function\") or log warn message in this case.\n. The answer on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22140094/512042. I will close the issue.\n. I don't see any useful use case here, so I am closing the pull.\n. fixed here: http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Filters/Brighten.html\n. You may add viewport meta tag to your html, and install it with your properties.\nI am using this in my application:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,width=device-width,height=device-height,target-densitydpi=medium-dpi,user-scalable=0\"/>\n. I think there is not KineticJS bugs, something with you code. One thing that i found:\njavascript\n        var x = $('form#frmProperties #lineX2').val();\n        var y = $('form#frmProperties #lineY2').val();\nval() returns String not a Number. So code should be:\njavascript\n        var x = parseInt($('form#frmProperties #lineX2').val());\n        var y = parseInt($('form#frmProperties #lineY2').val());\nRepost you question to stackoverfow, if you still have problems.\n. @kzhdev can you write unit test for this?\n. Can you provide any jsfiddle?\n. Try latest build. With this pull (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/777) performance on androind should be much better.\n. context that you have from function parameters is not real canvas context. It is KineticJS's wrapper. Try this (use setAttr):\n``` javascript\nvar reveal=new Kinetic.Shape({\n    drawFunc: function(context){\n        var comprobar=0;\n    context.beginPath();\n    context.setAttr('fillStyle', 'black');\n\n    context.setAttr('globalCompositeOperation', \"destination-out\");\n    for (var i=0;i<arrayaux.length;i++){\n        if (i==primeros[comprobar]){\n\n            context.moveTo(arrayaux[i].x, arrayaux[i].y);\n            comprobar++;\n        }\n        else{\n            context.lineTo(arrayaux[i].x, arrayaux[i].y);\n        }                       \n    }\n    context.closePath();\n    context.fillStrokeShape(this);\n}\n\n});\n```\n. It is very easy to convert dataURL to blob. For example https://gist.github.com/davoclavo/4424731\nI think we shouldn't include this functionality to library.\n. may be this:\njavascript\nwindow.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL;\nTry it. Please, repost you question to stackoverflow if need .\n. Can you provide any jsfiddle demo? This example works as expected for me: http://jsbin.com/jotud/1/edit what about your system?\n. Currently you can't change opacity of cached node. You need clearCache before setting opacity. @ericdrowell look at https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/787 please. It is related with current issue.\n. You are using drawHitFromCache, right? You can:\n1. Create image with opacity 1\n2. Create hit\n3. only THEN set opacity to 0\nSee demo: http://jsbin.com/yaqap/1/edit\n. Oh. Looks like it will not work in this way, because after clearCache hitFunc also cleared\n. You may use ultra hack: set opacity to 0.01 - invisible for you, but visiable for hit! http://jsbin.com/yaqap/2/edit\n. fixed https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/cb52be6dc0e62fa526579762d45e92d08b434d23\n. Just for advertisement try to use debugger plugin: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/658#issuecomment-36724160\nsetSize has another specification:\njavascript\nstage.setSize({\n  width: window.innerWidth,\n  height: this.window.innerHeight\n});\n. Can you provide more information with fiddle? Adding new node while dragging http://jsbin.com/goxon/1/edit\n. Why not. But it will but much easier if you will localize the problem and provide small demo.\n. I tested MultiTouch, works really cool. But I don't believe that native drag drop is slower. Because it have MANY optimizations. Can you provide any demo?\n. Each frame of your sprite may have different width or height.\nWhen you are setting width of Kinetic.Image it is working as scaling, but I think this behavior is not expected for Sprite object. For example we have one sprite with two frames. One has 100 width, another one has 200 width. What you mean, if you are doing sprite.width(150)? \n. Why not to use scaling?\n. javascript\nsprite.scaleX(134/123);\nsprite.scaleY(22/21);\nno?\n. Can you provide any example? This demo is working: http://jsbin.com/lujan/2/edit\n. I see. May be KineticJS should say (throw or warn) that caching Stage is not allowed (it has no his own canvas). Try to cache each Layers: http://jsbin.com/cetosabo/2/edit\njavascript\nstage.on(\"dragstart\", function(){\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer) {\n    layer.cache({\n      x : stage.x(),\n      y : stage.y(),\n      width : stage.width(),\n      height : stage.height()\n    });\n  });\n});\nstage.on(\"dragend\", function(){\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer) {\n    layer.clearCache();\n  });\n  stage.draw();\n});\n. Yep, this is a bug. As workaround until bug is fixed you may also do this:\n``` javascript\nstage.on(\"dragstart\", function(){\n  stage.setScaleX(1);\n  stage.setScaleY(1);\n  stage.getChildren().each(function(layer) {\n    layer.cache({\n      x : stage.x(),\n      y : stage.y(),\n      width : stage.width(),\n      height : stage.height()\n    });\n  });\n  stage.setScaleX(1.5);\n  stage.setScaleY(1.5);\n});\n```\nhttp://jsbin.com/cetosabo/4/edit\n. Possible way:\n1. Every time you have changes on stage cache it to image, then draw this image to hidden layer.\n2. On dragstart hide every layer except layer with the image.\n3. On dragend hide layer with image and make other layers visible.\n. You have a bug in your code. You are adding layer to stage on button click. But layer is already on stage.\n. What kind of error you are expecting there?\n. Emmm... You want to add error, right? Are you sure? Do not do this! Any program already have a lot of bugs.\najax have error callback because many things may happen: wrong url, no network etc. stage.toDataURL is local function. And it should not have any errors. But if it will it is just KineticJS bug.\n. Actually HammerJS support is not required. You can do this in \"pure\" KineticJS. (http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-multi-touch-scale-stage-with-kineticjs/)\nWith HammerJS example: http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/6P4fc/2/\n. Can you post your code example with KineticJS?\n. But I think that tracking event type as a second arguments is good idea. It is not easy to include event type to native event object. For example code:\njavascript\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEOVER, evt, this.targetShape);\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEENTER, evt, this.targetShape);\nHere we have same event object for different events. How to insert event type here? If will do something like this:\njavascript\nevt.kineticEventType = MOUSEOVER;\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEOVER, evt, this.targetShape);\nevt.kineticEventType = MOUSEENTER;\nshape._fireAndBubble(MOUSEENTER, evt, this.targetShape)\nWe will have unexpected behavior in this case:\nnode.on('mouseover',function(e){\n   setTimeout(function(){\n      console.log(e.kineticEventType);  // why mouseenter?\n  });\n});\nWe can clone event object for every event - but this may be expensive action. Thoughts?\n. WOW! I think this is good way. But actually this is VERY BIG API changes. I think many developers use many properties from native event object (as I do). So with this new API I have to do some refactor work. This changes should be documented and described at Change Log very well.\nI updated and tested dispatchEvent and addEventListener (but in this case addEventListener will use old API)\n. This is the bug of new version.\nremove function of BaseLayer Class:\njavascript\nvar stage = this.getStage();\n// then\nif(stage && _canvas && Kinetic.Util._isInDocument(_canvas)) {\n   // bla bla\n}\nstage will be undefined, because while removeChildren function is working it delete parent referance from child node (for performace reasons). I am fixing the bug.\n. Nice. Also we don't need overloaded removeChildren and destroyChildren functions at Stage.js. I think unit test - is best way here.\n. You have to use touches property.\njavascript\n// for example for first finger\nvar clientX = evt.evt.touches[0].clientX;\n. You getting right position. Repost your question to stackoverflow, if it still actual.\n. We can not use adventure options because it will break API. You may use closure compiler with this options for your whole project.\n. Is it working on usual browser?\n. Ok. First try to set timeout to 300ms:\n``` javascript\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage(conf);\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\nstage.add(layer);\nsetTimeout(function(){\n    // add shapes to the layer and then do layer.draw()\n}, 300);\n```\nIf it is not helpful try second (insert before your code):\n``` javascript\nvar updateCanvas = function(canvas){\n    canvas.style.opacity = 0.9;\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        canvas.style.opacity = 1;\n    });\n};\nvar oldDraw = Kinetic.Layer.prototype.draw;\nKinetic.Layer.prototype.draw = function(){\n    updateCanvas(this.canvas._canvas);\n    oldDraw.apply(this, arguments);\n    return this;\n};\n`\n. Currently `KineticJS` supports dragging only for one shape at same time. So I don't understand how both shapes are dragging in you case. May be you are dragging group or layer?\nI will close the issue. Please, go to stackoverflow if you need a help.\n. Look at this demo http://jsfiddle.net/lavrton/qQeH6/. Just use image instead of the rectagle.\n. Too much code! Looks like you get wrong json from server. You should:\n1. Save somewhere json that you get from server\n2. Create simplest jsfiddle demo with this json\n3. Post your question to stackoverflow. (I am sure there are no KineticJS bug here)\n. I see `\"className\" : \"Kinetic.Group\"`, but should be\"className\" : \"Group\"in your JSON. After fixing works fine: http://jsbin.com/dibas/1/edit\n. Which problem you mean?\nAlso you should uselayer.draw()instead ofnode.draw()(layer is not clearing in this way).\n. Close via: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf\n. Also I want to add some note there. Might be related.\nI was testing KineticJS on desktop with windows 8. Testing device support both mouse and touch manipulations. Mouse events work fine, but touch - no. Also I accidentally discovered that touch event had start working after I addedHammerJS` to stage container.\njavascript\nvar hammer = new Hammer(stage.getContainer());\n. May be we can insert some polyfill to KineticJS? For example https://github.com/WebReflection/ie-touch#ie-touch? Or add some note to documentation (or readme, or wiki, hmmm)?\n. But TouchEvent is not defined in some browsers. http://caniuse.com/touch\n. It is not reproducing on a real device. I tested on ipad 3. So I am not sure it is a bug.\n. What is not correct? What are you expecting?\n. By design scaling don't affect x and y properties, only \"size\" properties - like width, height. Green line is moved because scale affect points property like size properties.\n. 1. No. This information is incorrect. Fixed: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/3b14818ac57f658c2f9cc930f19a18095af434bd\n2. How you get this error? Code?\n. You are right. It was bug. Fixed now. Thanks.\n. Can you provide demo? This example works fine: http://jsbin.com/garas/1/edit\n. You are right. My demo using v5.0.1. Same bug with v5.1.0\n. Answered on stackoverflow.\n. When you are executing stage.find('.column') it returns collection (array) of 3 element with name 'column'. Then you are adding click event handler only to this 3 objects. When you are creating more columns they have no such event handler. An you are right - instead of creating new Rect you may clone existent Rect. Cloning action is also copying event handlers.\n. It is not a bug. This is design solution.\n. This is a bug. I will fix it soon.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. This may be helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12886286/addeventlistener-for-keydown-on-canvas\nAlso look at this demo: http://jsbin.com/tojof/1/edit\n. I think best use case is listen all keydown events:\nwindow.addEventListener(\"keydown\", handle, true);\n. Try my demo. I thinks that is what you need.\n. I thinks yes - user should know what stage is current. Also you may focus element on other events: any application event, on scrolling etc.\n. It may be iframe issue. \"Pure\" page works fine: http://jsbin.com/bipociqo/1\n. javascript\nvar node = new Kinetic.Shape({\n  offset : {\n    x : 10,\n    y : 10\n  }\n  // or\n  // offsetX : 10,\n  // offsetY : 10\n});\n. Do you understand warning message?\nLayer's getWidth() and getHeight() return 0 (maybe they should return stage values...). So caching is not working.\n. Currently KineticJS can't handle width or height of groups (or layers) automatically. So you have to calculate them by yourself or use stage size values.\njavascript\nlayer.cache({\n   width : stage.getWidth(),\n   height : stage.getHeight()\n});\n. I think KineticJS should not care about this problem.\n1. The downsized image has \"strange\" quality, but not bad quality\n2. Including such downsizing algorithm may drop performance a lot\n3. Also is is hard to integrate this algorithm when we want to have different from original image width/height ratio.\n4. Also tweening.\nAnytime you can downsize image to canvas element, then pass the canvas to Kinetic.Image\n. Why do use think it is not working?\nUse display : inline-block; css for container.\n. visible is working: http://jsbin.com/buzix/1/edit\nWhy do you need width and height for layer?\n. I will update docs for supported params for FastLayer. If you need to change x or y of FastLayer just change such properties for each children.\nAlso if you will set hitGraphEnabled to false for Layer you will have almost FastLayer.\n. Do you meen color or point position?\n. Can you provide demo?\n. I see. You are resizing stage content manually, don't do this. Because KineticJS can not handle such behaviour. If you need to change size of a stage you should do something like this:\njavascript\nstage.scale({\n   x : scaleFactor,\n   y : scaleFactor\n});\nstage.width(yourWidth);\nstage.height(yourHeight);\nSo. There are no KineticJS bugs here. If you need more information or help, please, repost your question to stackoverflow.\n. Fixed. :+1: \n. Close as answered.\n. Close as issue is not a bug. Use stackoverflow.\n. Create background rectangle and use it for events:\njavascript\nvar text = new Kinetic.Text(config);\nvar back = new Kinetic.Rect({\n x : text.x(),\n y : text.y(),\n width : text.width(),\n height : text.height()\n});\nback.on('mouseleave', callback);\n. This is expected behaviour of cache function.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/243904031677382c6b8945fdb6c72d250ba6a8bf. Can you download latest kinetic.js from repo and test?\n. I made unit test for this case. Just for example updated demo works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/fy6LQ/4/\n. Ops...\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I believe this plugin https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/tree/master/debug may help you find problem by yourself. Add https://rawgithub.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools/master/debug/kinetic.debug.js after kinetic.js.\n. Can you provide more information about \"losing pixel\"? Screenshots?\n. I have ubuntu with chrome 34 and I don't see any difference. What is your system?\n. I think it is related to https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/819 and https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/750.\n. Interesting. But sometimes user may call draw method for shape (not for whole layer). Also may be it is possible to move such functionality to Context class.\n. I made this test: http://jsperf.com/dh-getimagedata-pixel-by-pixel-or-all-image/5\nIs it correct? I don't see any profit here.\n. I updated test. Looks like performance is much better.\n. May be we can make this in this way:\n1 Clear cache on ANY drawHit (on any node):\nvar layer = this.getLayer()\nif (layer) {\n    layer.hitCache = undefined;\n}\n2 Create hitCache on first (after drawHit) getIntersection call (layer method):\njavascript\nif (this.hitCache) {\n   // get data from cache\n} else {\n    // 1. create hitCache\n    // 2. return this.getIntersection(args);\n}\n. Thanks. I also added unit test https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/acac6e402f98ca5dc4ab662df11b8b8704c6b847#diff-9f8320baecfa172311b90096f1144d7cR297.\n. I disabled such caching awhile. I was testing on big project - it has many side effects. getImageData is very slow if values of width and height are large.\n. Of course it depend on application. If layer has animation - we will call getImageData every mouse move. Also I was testing on iOS. Dragging performance is dropped: when you created stage cache is empty. On dragstart new cache are creating - but that action is very slow.\n. Can you, please, repost your question to stackoverflow?\n. Ok. I will answer you here. Objects are rotating relative to their \"center\" point {x, y}. Your line object has no x and y attrs at configuration - that means they equal 0. So your line rotate relative top left canvas point. You may draw your shape near \"center\" point, then move your shape anywhere by changing x and y attrs (not points array). Also you may use offset attributes to move \"center\". May be demo will be more descriptive then my answear: http://jsbin.com/nuhaf/2/edit\n. Opacity - you are right, it is fixed (test latest build).\nOffset and rotation - are working fine. You need to apply rotation and offset AFTER cache() function is called to get best result or config x, y, width and height arguments of cache function manually.\n. javascript\nhexagon.draw();\nlayer.getContext().setAttr('globalCompositeOperation',\"source-atop\");\nrect.draw();\nhttp://jsbin.com/kufas/1/edit\nI think it is better to use Kinetic.Shape here. Use context.setAttr('globalCompositeOperation',\"source-atop\"); at drawFunc.\n. What is use case? Container may have many children. But any node has only one parent.\nSearch in all parent, grandparent, ...? I don't think this function is very useful.\n. javascript\nnode.visible(state);\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/23787397/512042\n. Float mouse position?! WAT?!\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/23787397/512042\n. Convert it on server side and use converted png on client or look there https://code.google.com/p/canvg/\n. I was not testing. But I guess it should work (library works as parser). https://code.google.com/p/canvg/#Potential_uses\n. You have to move node to tween layer BEFORE creating Tween instance. http://jsfiddle.net/CLBkm/2/\n. Cursor position has no offset. If you scaled stage you should take scale into account when you are creating new line on mousedown. http://jsfiddle.net/448Nc/1/\n. html5 canvas stroke always draws half-inside / half-outside the stroke's path\nThat means you have 2 antialiased pixels stroke.\n. You may add Kinetic.Rect on bottom of you stage with your fill.\n. I am sure that KineticJS should not care about this. You have strange and very specific use case. You may replace layerX and layerY with \"correct\" values while faking events.\n. Looks like you are right. But function _merge is old and currently not using in KineticJS. So i guess it will be removed.\nAlso you should not use private methods (starts with underscore).\n. Yes, site is not working for me too. As I know @ericdrowell is upgrading it.\n. I think dragDistance should be relative to dragBoundFunc. Do you have an example where your behaviour is important?\n. Can you create any jsfiddle?\n. Canvas element still has problems with drawing svg files. Look there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5495952/draw-svg-on-html5-canvas-with-support-for-font-element/5505861#5505861.\n. > it means drawHitFromCache() with Local domain svg is bugged and will never support IE10 ?\nCorrect. Just try not to use svg inside canvas.\nAs workaround use png instead of svg.\n. I don't know ways to solve the bug inside KineticJS.\n. fixed. You may take latest version from from repo. kinetic.js or kinetic.min.js files.\n. Set scale after cache. Or pass width and height params to cache function (\nheight = imageHeight * scaleX, same for width)\n. This is design solution. All transform functions are disabled for FastLayer.\n. fixed\n. Fixed on latest dev version.\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. Can you provide jsfiddle? If you are calling draw on any node (except Layer and Stage) it will not remove \"old\" node from canvas. Just draw new on top of canvas.\n. http://www.zeali.net/mirrors/html5canvastutorials/kineticjs/html5-canvas-events-tutorials-introduction-with-kineticjs/index.html\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. Do you have demo? Test is passing:\njavascript\nvar ring = new Kinetic.Ring({\n          x: stage.getWidth() / 2,\n          y: stage.getHeight() / 2,\n          innerRadius: 50,\n          outerRadius: 90,\n          fill: 'green',\n          stroke: 'black',\n          strokeWidth: 4,\n          draggable: true\n});\nvar clone = ring.clone();\nassert.equal(clone.outerRadius(), ring.outerRadius());\n. Yep. It is strange that you have width, height and outerRadius together. width (and height) should be = outerRadius * 2. Look https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/shapes/Ring.js#L52. In your case while cloning width (or height) was applying after outerRadius attribute so it was change outerRadius value.\n. Yep. I made small mistake while publishing first version to npm. I can't publish 5.1.0 to npm. So 5.0.6 (on npm) is newer then 5.1.0 (last stable release). Will fixed with new release.\n. While link is not working, It will be very nice if you will make pull requests with any demo to there: https://github.com/lavrton/kineticjs-tips-and-tools#applications\n. Now should work. http://jsbin.com/mitis/3/edit\nA lot of API changes from 4.x version.\n. Can you create unit tests for this?\n. I think it will be better to test with node, not \"private\" method. \n\nFor example you could name a circle: 'red circle' and a square: 'red square', and now stage.find('.red') will return both elements, but stage.find('.square') will return just the square.\n\nThis is VERY good test case.\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. context argument is not native canvas context. It is KineticJS wrapper. Use: context.setAttr('fillStyle', 'red');\n. 1. Try to use latest dev version from master.\n2. Make any jsfiddle.\n. prevent context menu:\njavascript\ndocument.getElementById(\"con\").addEventListener('contextmenu', function (event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n});\nthen listen click or mousedown events:\njavascript\ngroup.on('click', function(e) {\n  if (e.evt.button === 2) {\n    alert('Right click');\n  }\n});\nhttp://jsbin.com/qedez/1/edit\n. New version is not released yet.\n. All tutorials are repaired in new homepage. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/Getting_Started.html\n. Closed as not related to KineticJS.\n. Can you provide any fiddle?\nThis one is working with latest build: http://jsbin.com/bivuce/1/edit\n. Fixed.\n. It return this for chainable code:\nlayer.add(rect).add(circle);\n. Do you mean bad performance while dragging?\nTry latest version from master. How it works for you?\n. I don't think this is a bug. Moving canvas from kinetic container is unexpected behaviour.\n. Can you create jsfiddle?\n. Hello, guys! I was contributing to KineticJS awhile. I made many fixed, but I don't want to tag new version as I am not a maintainer. I was thinking about future developing, but for my project KineticJS is on very good state and improving it is not required. May be I will continue contributing soon, just for experience and practicing.\n. FabricJS and EaselJS are very close to KineticJS. If you are developing game - look at PhaserJS\n. As I know all of them have very good support. In my tests EaselJS has very good performance. But it is really depends on type of application, so you should test youself.\n. @confile you can use toImage approach if you have many issues with cache. About Phaser - I guess yes. Go to examples page.\n. Phaser JS is based on Pixi. It adds game specific stuff such as camera, physics, sounds, etc. Do you need it? Yes - Phaser JS. No - Pixi. Also one of the main feature of Pixi (Phaser) against Kinetic, Fabric, Easel is that Pixi have awesome build in WebGL support. So if all of your objects on canvas might be represented as picture - you must try it.\n. I will maintain KineticJS in a fork: https://github.com/lavrton/KineticJS\n. API changes:\njavascript\nvar wave =  new Kinetic.Star({\n  x: 100,\n  y: 200,\n  numPoints: 5,\n  innerRadius: 70,\n  outerRadius: 70,\n  stroke: 'black',\n  strokeWidth: 4,\n  fillLinearGradientStartPoint: {\n    x : 0, y : 0\n  },\n  fillLinearGradientEndPoint: {x : 20, y : 20},\n  fillLinearGradientColorStops: [0, \"#EA493B\", 1, \"#E32486\"]\n});\nhttp://jsbin.com/toqexe/1/edit\n. Also you can get documentation from downloads: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/releases\n. http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/api/Kinetic.html\n. Hello everyone. I decided to create a fork. As a contributor of current repo I think I can support KineticJS in a new fork. Repo and link will be ready in ~ one week.\n. @confile agree, PIXI (and Phaser) is really great. But it is different framework. In my opinion PIXI is best for games. But if you need a lot of \"vector\" graphics (such as text) you will have problems. This is my experience. I was thinking to move to Phaser in my main mind map application. In the app I need to draw a lot of nodes (with text) on canvas. It is possible to create custom graphics with PIXI. But for each graphics PIXI has separate canvas element in memory (You can not just draw text into webgl context, you have to convert text to image first, then you can display that image). So I had big memory leak. I was not able to find solution for this case.\n. Hello everyone. I made a fork. https://github.com/konvajs/konva\nThe homepage is http://konvajs.github.io/\n. Ops. I am really sad to see this... Waiting Eric's answer.\n. https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/releases/download/v5.1.0/documentation.zip\n. All forks may be merged in any repo (as in personal as in org).\nBut sure that is might be very good idea. Are there any other active forks?\nPS: hmm. all good name already taken.\n. As it is hart to evolve project under old name I decided to rename fork to Konva project. Fork is available in this organization: https://github.com/konvajs\n. What an issue? Second tap event is not expected?\n. Usual DOM works is same way: http://jsbin.com/tejohe/1/edit?html,js,output.\nSecond tap is still tap event, so event should be fired.\nYou can implement simple workaround:\n``` javascript\nvar wasDblClick = false;\nrect.on('click tap', function() {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n         if (wasDblClick) {\n             wasDblClick = false;\n             return;\n         }\n          console.log('click');\n}, 10);\n});\nrect.on('dblclick dbltap', function() {\n  wasDblClick = true;\n  console.log('dblclick');\n});\n``\n.var dbltap = false;should be outside ofwireKineticEventSafe` function.\n. Works nice for me: http://jsbin.com/bipoke/13/edit?js,output\n. Now sure how long it will be available here: http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/api/\nBut I suggest you to switch to KineticJS fork: http://konvajs.github.io/\n. @zuoRambo right. + template https://github.com/terryweiss/docstrap\n.

    "michaelgilley": "@imakewebthings I agree that was a bit of an overstatement on my part. :) Still, it'd be a huge plus to the library.\n. Hey Eric, thank you for supporting this. There are a few issues though. These are non-critical but still yet they should be addressed. If you'd like me to add these as new issues just let me know.\nFirst, the Kinetic should be hidden from the global namespace. It looks like in Global.js line 31 Kinetic is left outside of the wrapper. Part of the power of AMD (requirejs) is to contain libraries/modules within the AMD wrapper and be used through direct require instead of reference to the root namespace. This is why the UMD spec you included defaults to assigning Kinetic to the root (window) namespace IF define and exports are undefined. If define is a function then Kinetic should not be accessible via the window object, only through requiring the module.\nIf you'd like to keep Kinetic in the global namespace independent of whether define exists or not that's fine. Plenty of libraries/frameworks do this (e.g., jQuery, Underscore, etc.) You can see an UMD example of this at https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExportsGlobal.js. However, it would be best practice to also provide a noConflict method to the library for developers who would prefer to remove its footprint from the global namespace and thus save from any potential library naming conflicts.\nSecond, now when loading Kinetic without AMD it stores a reverence to the library under window.returnExports (Global.js line 110). This needs to be changed to root.Kinetic. The UMD spec did not intend for returnExports to actually be used. Again, this is why var Kinetic should be contained within the factory function scope referenced in Global.js line 112. It's intended to be made global on this line if exports and define prove undefined.\nThird, as is Kinetic is stored under root and so makes irrelevant the wrapper functions on each Kinetic module. I assume you added these for the custom build feature you offer on your site? If they are treated as individual modules this is where you can truly leverage the power of AMD by using a define function with each of those modules and requiring their dependencies respectively.\nThanks for all the work!\n. No problem Eric. Just opened the new ticket.\nYou shouldn't include requireJS with Kinetic. It's only one of several AMD library solutions that users might use. AMD is quite agnostic in this sense. RequireJS is also bloated for production use since it includes a lot of development time loading capabilities that are unnecessary once everything is optimized. To run an AMD built app you'd only need the smallest AMD shim that met the spec. See https://github.com/jrburke/almond for this.\nIt probably would be in your best interest to go ahead and write Kinetic to the root object to retain backwards compatibility for folks who have relied on it being under root up till now. But I'd also provide a quick noConflict method to remove it from root for those who would prefer that. An example of this method might be:\njs\n// _Kinetic is the previously stored value of root.Kinetic (usually undefined)\nnoConflict: function() {\n    root.Kinetic = _Kinetic;\n    return Kinetic;\n}\n. @imakewebthings I agree that was a bit of an overstatement on my part. :) Still, it'd be a huge plus to the library.\n.

Updated exampel with circle limits:\nconstraint on circle edge: http://jsfiddle.net/jjR55/2/\nbound within circle: http://jsfiddle.net/jjR55/3/\n. I've used kinetik to draw link in an app that should work also on an iPad. These links should be clickable (or tappable), but a link with just the width och 2 px is very har to hit on the ipad (specially if its zoomed out). If you look at how links are handled in safari-mobile the \"tap-zone\" is much bigger than the anchor itself, I was trying to make something similar.\nBefore I changed the line's width when before I called the saveImageData() and later restored it before the layer was drawn. (Did this in a beforeDraw-function). But since the new implementation of the buffer this is no longer possible.\nBut if the drawfunction was to know when it was called for drawing the buffer you can customize it to add som pixels for the line on the buffer.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/qsGSA/\nAlso someone in the forum just pointed out that if you make a custom shape that has more than one color, you also risk to break the buffer. This can be used to solve that as well. se Forum post:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1131\n. What is you opinion about this?\nI see no other good option for making it possible / easier for touchscreen users to tap small shapes.\n. My plan was to give another option for the developers, and often the developers don't care about which order the images are created.\nBut you probably right, if there is a simple way to do things no one would bother to do it the \"right way\" maybe it would be better to create some tools for helping developers.\nMaybe something like this:\nKinetic.Load(function (images) {\n    var stage = new Kinetic.Stage(config);\n    [...]\n    var image = new Kinetic.Image({image: images.cat, [...]});\n    [...]\n},\n{\n    cat: \"http://example.com/cat.png\",\n    dog: \"http://example.com/dog.png\"\n});\n. What if isAncestorOf could be recursive?\nisAncestorOf: function(node) {\n    if (this._id == node._id) return true;\n    if (node.getParent()) return this.isAncestorOf(node.getParent());\n    return false;\n}\nIt would change the behavior a bit like:\ngroup1.isAncestorOf(group1); would always return true. What is the expected value in this situation?\nThe original value could be obtained by:\nisAncestorOf: function(node) {\n    if (!node.getParent()) return false;\n    if (node.getParent()._id == this._id) return true;\n    return this.isAncestorOf(node.getParent());\n}\nThe special case for stage (if it should exist) is handled from the stage type.\n. I think it works great! But I couldn't gather the energy to write any automated tests...\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/mLRzM/\n. OK, not really sure what you're after...\nDid two more examples but didn't check them in (extended manually from a jsfiddle instead)\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/GAbvk/ - This one calls whatever attribute dynamically\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/w2h2P/ - This one extends the array with all the functions of its children (when it's extended)\nI dont like the way you call the first one, but i don't like to loop everything, or that you can't add anything avter extendArray is called as in the second one.\nMaybe its possible to do a combination. The basic stuff is added like i suggested earlier, and the more advanced stuff is added by a handle-method. I can't think of any more ways of doing it ;)\n. Eric: don't you get notifications of comments to checkins and line notes? I have at least made some code review of your checkins that way. For instance on:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/d0a1b2870e9975aa226dc78b6938450c0d067bf2\nwhere I questioned wether you change would have any effect on the event triggering.\n. The problem of the suggested code is that the _initImage must be renamed to _initScaledImage (or similar). In the example you will have a recursive loop since the image constructor will call back on this._initImage.\n. Should have used a new branch to leave out the old history.. Sorry for that.\n. Glad you liked it ;)\nI don't use twitter (mainly because I was to dissapointed to find my usual nick already taken...)\n.

Sounds like you should set the beforedraw of the shapes to use composition. And then restore in afterdraw.\n. I think I have a solution, but it includes som coding. Let me try it then I'll be back with the result ;)\n. Ok, sorry if keeping you waiting.\nHere's my suggestion:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/davonium/RNLxb/7/\nYou can send any shape to the makeShapeComposite-function and it will be \"updated\" to use the compositeOperation you specify.\n. Just realised that this might mess up the buffer layer as well.. \n. http://jsfiddle.net/cZLnM/3/\nSince the setAttrs is refactored you need to write the points as xy-objects. Not sure if this is by design or not..\n. I have noticed this before. The reason is that the remove command removes the nodes colorkey from the stage, and that's why it can trigger events. You can manually insert the color key in the stage's list. I've done this but don't remember the code right now, but it shouldn't be to har to figure out.\nI saw one workaround: instead of adding the node after it's removed, add a clone of the node. The clone will have a new colorkey.\nFinally I would suggest to Eric to solve this by re-adding the remove to containers, but don't let it remove the colorkey and instead have a .destroy() on the node (that removes the node, the colorkey and maybe unsets other values). This way the add/remove analogue would remain intact.\n. Yes, the move to would do what you need. But i've seen some cases where a developer wants to have an undo-method for deleting object, and then there are no way to first remove it from an object, and then put it back without using remove(), so i still think it's a bit of a problem.\nAnd since the colorkey of the object is created when the object is created (and not added to the stage) it shouldn't really be deleted when you do a remove. This is still not expected, i would say. But probably not very high priority either...\n. Glad to be able to give something back ;)\nBtw, from the changelog: \"get() now also supports node type selectors\", think you mean shape type selectors...\n. The remove-function is changed since 4.0.2. Instead of layer.remove(node) just write node.remove().\n. I see two reasons for this problem.\n1# The canvas is offset by 1px because of the border (almost all exampled on html5canvastutorials have this problem)\n2# The font is anti-aliasing causing the buffer layer to be a different colour at the edges - This is very hard to fix, I've ben looking in to it before, but found no solution. While the is no shape behind the color is correct but the opacity is not 1.0, but when there is something behind the color will be a mix of the to shapes colorkey...\n\nThere is also another problem for me with this (obviously not showing in Chrome): all texts (maybe even all shapes?) will have a solid fill in the buffer layer even when not set in the config. This is probably caused when white-/blacklisting members of the attars before the shape is drawn on the buffer. This is probably not very hard to solve, but I haven't had time to look into it. Maybe Eric can take a look?\n. @v1r: the reason you're not seeing this in win might be what i described at the end. I have one temporary workaround to make the first problems more visible:\nInclude the setting \"image: true\" in the config of the simpleText, then after the node is created add (to a new line):\nsimpleText.imageBuffer = true\nlike in this version:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/davonium/tDTfr/1/\n. stopPropagation() is a jQuery method (that only works on jQuery events). Kinetic is not using jQuery, so it will have np effect. The preventDefault() is working as expected though.\nIf you need to be able to stop propagation you could do something like this:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/davonium/k3sN8/8/\n. This is a problem that's hard to try in a jsfiddle, pixel modifications on canvas does not work when using cross-origin image data...\n. http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-image-tutorial/ this example works when changing to the newest library, so I don't think this is an issue.\n. Updated exampel with circle limits:\nconstraint on circle edge: http://jsfiddle.net/jjR55/2/\nbound within circle: http://jsfiddle.net/jjR55/3/\n. I've used kinetik to draw link in an app that should work also on an iPad. These links should be clickable (or tappable), but a link with just the width och 2 px is very har to hit on the ipad (specially if its zoomed out). If you look at how links are handled in safari-mobile the \"tap-zone\" is much bigger than the anchor itself, I was trying to make something similar.\nBefore I changed the line's width when before I called the saveImageData() and later restored it before the layer was drawn. (Did this in a beforeDraw-function). But since the new implementation of the buffer this is no longer possible.\nBut if the drawfunction was to know when it was called for drawing the buffer you can customize it to add som pixels for the line on the buffer.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/qsGSA/\nAlso someone in the forum just pointed out that if you make a custom shape that has more than one color, you also risk to break the buffer. This can be used to solve that as well. se Forum post:\nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1131\n. What is you opinion about this?\nI see no other good option for making it possible / easier for touchscreen users to tap small shapes.\n. My plan was to give another option for the developers, and often the developers don't care about which order the images are created.\nBut you probably right, if there is a simple way to do things no one would bother to do it the \"right way\" maybe it would be better to create some tools for helping developers.\nMaybe something like this:\nKinetic.Load(function (images) {\n    var stage = new Kinetic.Stage(config);\n    [...]\n    var image = new Kinetic.Image({image: images.cat, [...]});\n    [...]\n},\n{\n    cat: \"http://example.com/cat.png\",\n    dog: \"http://example.com/dog.png\"\n});\n. What if isAncestorOf could be recursive?\nisAncestorOf: function(node) {\n    if (this._id == node._id) return true;\n    if (node.getParent()) return this.isAncestorOf(node.getParent());\n    return false;\n}\nIt would change the behavior a bit like:\ngroup1.isAncestorOf(group1); would always return true. What is the expected value in this situation?\nThe original value could be obtained by:\nisAncestorOf: function(node) {\n    if (!node.getParent()) return false;\n    if (node.getParent()._id == this._id) return true;\n    return this.isAncestorOf(node.getParent());\n}\nThe special case for stage (if it should exist) is handled from the stage type.\n. I think it works great! But I couldn't gather the energy to write any automated tests...\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/mLRzM/\n. OK, not really sure what you're after...\nDid two more examples but didn't check them in (extended manually from a jsfiddle instead)\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/GAbvk/ - This one calls whatever attribute dynamically\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/w2h2P/ - This one extends the array with all the functions of its children (when it's extended)\nI dont like the way you call the first one, but i don't like to loop everything, or that you can't add anything avter extendArray is called as in the second one.\nMaybe its possible to do a combination. The basic stuff is added like i suggested earlier, and the more advanced stuff is added by a handle-method. I can't think of any more ways of doing it ;)\n. Eric: don't you get notifications of comments to checkins and line notes? I have at least made some code review of your checkins that way. For instance on:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/commit/d0a1b2870e9975aa226dc78b6938450c0d067bf2\nwhere I questioned wether you change would have any effect on the event triggering.\n. The problem of the suggested code is that the _initImage must be renamed to _initScaledImage (or similar). In the example you will have a recursive loop since the image constructor will call back on this._initImage.\n. Should have used a new branch to leave out the old history.. Sorry for that.\n. Glad you liked it ;)\nI don't use twitter (mainly because I was to dissapointed to find my usual nick already taken...)\n.

Looking at version 3.10.3 there is code in _setChildrenIndices for actually rearranging the layers - in versions after this the code is no longer there.\n. wow\n. thanks Eric for all the hard work!\n.

    "fitzalon": "I have implemented the 'hit detection' drawFunc solution that I outlined in my comments in \nhttp://www.kineticjs.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1131\nThis solution also includes the worthy \"pass boolean\" solution that DAVID proposed in that discussion thread.   You have the option of defining a special purpose 'hit detection' drawFunc [as another 'attrs' parameter, 'hitDrawFunc'], or simply to code your drawFunc to look at the second parameter passed to it... which is the value of the Shape's colorKey.   If it is passed, then the draw is to the hit detection buffer, and I use the value of colorKey in all my fills and strokes.  This gives me great flexibility to create composite Shapes with multiple colored bits and pieces without having to create separate Shapes for each of the bits.  This is conceptually much cleaner from a design viewpoint, and frees me to create all sorts of multi-colored Shapes without being restricted to a single fill and stroke color.  \nThe solution also encompasses the current solution in Eric's code which currently implements the very restrictive rule of 'one shape can only have one fill or stroke color'.  The solution also opens up the possibility to have a very different 'hit draw' pattern than the pattern of the actual shape.   For example, you can draw a 'fatter hit line' for a narrow line so that your users will be able to select it easily.   This is what Davonium in the above comment is wanting.  \nTo use this solution, simply include the new Kinetic.Shape.prototype.draw below in a separate JS file that is included AFTER Eric's KineticJS file.  It will override Eric's Kinetic.Shape.prototype.draw function for Custom Shapes ONLY.   His other Shapes will continue to use his  Kinetic.Shape.prototype.draw function [because his code extends those Shapes with his generic Shape functions before my new Kinetic.Shape.prototype.draw function is encountered in a later file].  You could overwrite his  Kinetic.Shape.prototype.draw function, but that is not recommended until he agrees to adopt this solution or to implement a similar one.  Keep his code clean.. he is the gatekeeper for the inclusion of new ideas.\nAs feedback on my use of this solution, I have used both the hitDrawFunc variation and the detection of the colorKey parameter in a single drawFunc.   When I want a very different hit draw pattern, I have used the hitDrawFunc.  When I want the same pattern with only a substitution of my fill color for the Shape's colorKey, I have used the same drawFunc with a simple detection of the colorKey parameter to tell me to substitute it in my fills. \n\n```\nKinetic.Shape.prototype.draw = function(canvas) {\n    if(this.attrs.drawFunc && Kinetic.Node.prototype._shouldDraw.call(this, canvas)) {\n        var stage = this.getStage();\n        var context = canvas.getContext();\n        var family = [];\n        var parent = this.parent;\n    family.unshift(this);\n    while(parent) {\n        family.unshift(parent);\n        parent = parent.parent;\n    }\n\n    context.save();\n    for(var n = 0; n < family.length; n++) {\n        var node = family[n];\n        var t = node.getTransform();\n        var m = t.getMatrix();\n        context.transform(m[0], m[1], m[2], m[3], m[4], m[5]);\n    }\n\n    this.applyOpacity(context);\n    this.applyLineJoin(context);\n    this.applyLineCap(context);\n\n    // draw the shape\n    this.appliedShadow = false;\n\n    var wl = Kinetic.Global.BUFFER_WHITELIST;\n    var bl = Kinetic.Global.BUFFER_BLACKLIST;\n    var attrs = {};\n\n    if(canvas.name === 'buffer') {\n        for(var n = 0; n < wl.length; n++) {\n            var key = wl[n];\n            attrs[key] = this.attrs[key];\n            if(this.attrs[key] || (key === 'fill' && !this.attrs.stroke && !('image' in this.attrs))) {\n                this.attrs[key] = '#' + this.colorKey;\n            }\n        }\n        for(var n = 0; n < bl.length; n++) {\n            var key = bl[n];\n            attrs[key] = this.attrs[key];\n            this.attrs[key] = '';\n        }\n        // image is a special case\n        if('image' in this.attrs) {\n            attrs.image = this.attrs.image;\n            if(this.imageBuffer) {\n                this.attrs.image = this.imageBuffer;\n            }\n            else {\n                this.attrs.image = null;\n                this.attrs.fill = '#' + this.colorKey;\n            }\n        }\n        context.globalAlpha = 1;\n        if (!!this.attrs.hitDrawFunc) this.attrs.hitDrawFunc.call(this, context, this.colorKey);\n        else this.attrs.drawFunc.call(this, context, this.colorKey);\n\n        var bothLists = wl.concat(bl);\n        for(var n = 0; n < bothLists.length; n++) {\n            var key = bothLists[n];\n            this.attrs[key] = attrs[key];\n        }\n        // image is a special case\n        this.attrs.image = attrs.image;\n\n    } else this.attrs.drawFunc.call(this, context); //This is a draw to the real display buffer\n\n    context.restore();\n}\n\n}\nKinetic.Shape.prototype.setHitDrawFunc = function(hitDrawFunc) { //This is only if you don't want to include the 'hitDrawFunc' as a attrs parameter in your Shape constructor call.\n        this.attrs['hitDrawFunc'] = hitDrawFunc ;\n        return this ; \n}\n```\n\n.

Hi Ckristijan,\nYour case is just another instance of the current untenable restriction of forcing Eric's otherwise-excellent hit-detection system on the functioning of the drawFunc.  I have implemented a design solution that enables the user to separate the hit-detection functioning from the drawFunc on a if-desireable basis. Have a look my solution at the following:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/136\nLet me know if it solves your issues and frees you to do as many setFill()s as you want in your drawFuncs without any loss of event detection.  \nNeedless to say, this design flaw needs to be fixed.\nCheers Mate.\n. Hi Ckristijan, \n  Don't use setFill; instead directly use the context.setFillStyle() as illustrated below and you will be OK.  \nif(colorKey) context.setFillStyle(colorKey);\nelse context.setFillStyle(\"#FAFAFA\");\nRemember that you will need to implement the instructions at https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/136\nAlso, don't go back to version 3.10.5 that uses an older inferior hit-detection system.   Keep up with Eric's new versions as he is continuously introducing improvements, and you want to keep your code compatible.  \nHe will eventually fix this design flaw and free us to create rich multi-colored Shapes with variant hit-detection mechanisms that can be independent of the Shapes drawing (... the hitDrawFunc idea).\nMy drawFunc functions work perfectly.  Here is an example---------\n//This draw function draws a simple circle representing a node in my application, \n//but its display could vary for a variety of different situations in the application. \n//It has different stroke color depending whether it is \"locked on\" or not, or whether \n//it represents a \"Right-Hand (RH)\" node or not. \n//Or if it represents a \"Phantom\" node, it will be faded (globalAlpha=0.3)\n//The example illustrates that there is a real need to be able to vary the display color,\n//via FILL and STROKE changes.  I'm sure that lots of applications will need this\n//flexibility, independent of hit-detection restrictions.\n//Note that the hit FILLs the circle, but the display only STROKEs it (no fill) \nthis.drawSplotch = function(ctx,colorKey) {\n    var splotchRadius = this.radius ;\n    var assocNode = this.assocNode ;\n    var X = assocNode.getX() ;  \n    var Y = assocNode.getY() ;  \n    var drawColoredSplotch = function(splotchColor) {\n            var lockedOn = assocNode.getLockedON() ;\n            if (lockedOn || !assocNode.getPreviousNode()) {\n                ctx.lineWidth = 3 ;  \n                ctx.strokeStyle = (lockedOn? \"orange\": \"white\") ;\n            } else \n                if (assocNode.isRHnode()) {\n                    ctx.lineWidth = 2 ;  \n                    ctx.strokeStyle = \"red\";\n                } else {\n                    ctx.lineWidth = 1 ;\n                    ctx.strokeStyle = makeHexColor(splotchColor) ;\n                }\n            if (assocNode.notPhantomNode()) \n                ctx.globalAlpha = 1.0 ;\n                else ctx.globalAlpha = 0.3;  \n            ctx.beginPath() ;\n            ctx.arc(X, Y, splotchRadius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);\n            ctx.stroke() ;//No Fill, only stroke\n            ctx.closePath();\n        }\n    if (!!colorKey) {//draw hit region... notice the fill rather than stroke\n        ctx.fillStyle = colorKey ;\n        ctx.beginPath() ;\n        ctx.arc(X, Y, splotchRadius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);\n        ctx.fill() ;\n        ctx.closePath();\n    } else {\n        drawColoredSplotch(this.splotchColor) ;\n    }\n}\n.

It almost seems to work better to get the object you wish to clone and simply use its more common properties, or the ones you really want, to sort of \"duplicate\" it. Transparent .png's are horrible cloned - they turn all black! I think at this point perhaps clone needs to be revisited and there needs to be a separation of user-defined values and default / auto values, so when you DO clone, you're basically just copying previously-set values.\n. @ericdrowell I think the bigger issue with cloning is the way it clones png images with transparency. I have a glass image with highlights around the edges but most of the image is almost transparent (approx. 10% transparency with a white base). The clone looks like it's basically black, though the pure white highlights where there's no transparency do show up.\n. I actually have group clipping working, at least as much as I need it to.

And I'm not very familiar with github so I'm not sure how to submit code for review and inclusion.\nThe code I have isn't true group clipping since groups don't have a width or height, but my code includes the creating of a clipping rectangle to \"define\" the group's width and height, and includes the ability to clip a group within the clip group.

I have code to do that as well though.\nLet me know if you want to review the code, and perhaps I'll look around here and figure out how to commit code.\n. I would think this is actually a logical response, since removing the parent also removes all children contained within it. This applies to groups and layers both. Once the parent is removed, assigning the child to a variable or console logging the child would result in an undefined value. I don't think KineticJS should have to test for whether a shape is defined or not before removing it - that's up to the coder using the library.\n. @soulBit I believe I understand what you're saying, but here's the question I guess - are you saying that when a parent or container is removed, the children should still be accessible? Granted, when you create a group or layer and add children to that layer, each child is a variable (object), and that variable exists in whatever scope it was originally set, but technically if it is added to a container then the container is removed, the child should NOT have a reference within the stage. The variable may still exist, but only as a collection of values, not as an actual reference to an object / container / shape on the stage. Think of it in simpler terms - if this were jQuery and you created a div, then added an image to the div, then removed the div - all using jQuery - if you then tried to reference the image (NOT the variable used to create the image but the \"physical\" image in the DOM), would you get a similar response?\n. Sorry but I don't follow. Why would a bound event work fine on a group that only contains objects (Kinetic shapes with draw functions) but not on a group that contains groups, each of which contains shapes?\n. I'm not seeing any issues with using custom non-standard fonts. The one I'm using shows up fine. One thing you may need to consider is that an @font-face font has to load a file in order to display, so if you're changing your font using a select but the font isn't loaded when you change it, it won't show up the way it should. I've found that adding a hidden or offscreen div with a single period (.) in it and a class that utilizes the font for each @font-face font I wish to include in the stage works quite well - it forces the DOM to load all of your font files on document.ready.\nAs for anti-aliasing, the fonts I've used so far show up perfectly. Are you sure the font you're using, and the browser you're using, should display the font crisper? Maybe do a side-by-side comparison of the text you're displaying - one in a div, the other on the canvas.\n. Unfortunately, I'm using a Mac at work and in Chrome everything looks fine. However, assuming you're using a PC doesn't really matter, as the text should render the same both in the canvas and in the DOM.\nCan you provide the @font-face CSS code as you're using it? Perhaps you missed something. Also, which font are you using? I noticed that Chrome doesn't like the format tag in @font-face (adding it actually broke my font). Too bad too, you almost have to use some sort of browser selection / distinction when using any CSS these days. They all render different and all seem to follow their own rules when it comes to the newer W3C stuff (CSS3 / HTML5).

Sorry, Eric, I think we both misunderstood. Of course Kinetic doesn't use jQuery, what I meant was Kinetic has similar functions to jQuery in that it uses both on() and off() for event handlers.

I ran into this\nissue when\nremoving a group that shared its name with another group where the removed\ngroup had events attached.

Thanks Eric for the quick response. Here is a quick and dirty example of what's happening:\nhttp://www.oppimispeli.fi/kinetic_bright/\nThe forest tile is the actual effect I am going for. You can see the pixels with some opacity to stay white. The green rectangle is a slider to apply brighten effect (0-255) to 2x2 to pixels (scaled 20 times) and up in the left corner it logs the RGBA values of those pixels. On the right there is a gradient image, with the upper half using opacity and lower half using fading to background color. Here you see the effect the best: In the ideal situation, they would work the same. But as you can observe, the gradient part goes super bright and stays that way due to the opacity values getting out of hand. That's at least what I think is happening from observing this from the debugging. clearFilter() get's it back to normal, so I definitely think it's due to the filter, but I'm lost where that happens since the filter isn't touching alpha values.\nHope this helps, let me know if I can be of more help.\n. Eric, did you get a chance to try my example? Sorry to ask again, I know you have your hands full, but it would really help to get confirmation of why this is happening and whether it's something that is gonna get fixed. This is blocking us to use images with alpha + brighten filter, which we use to highlight selection.\n. Thank you for the quick example. Of course your example doesn't have problems with opacity, jpeg doesn't have any opacity! I copied the example exactly, added a black background and switched to our test image (png) and I am able to reproduce easily. I can attach the image here and you can see it for yourself easily.\n\nGoing from slider to right (255) and back to center (0) works as expected on the lower bar, since it doesn't have opacity. But the higher bar, which has opacity, gets messed up. Here is a screenshot of the end situation:\n\nBoth bars should look the same, but as you can see, they clearly are not.\nHere is the code (your example with the added background and changed image reference):\nhttp://notepad.cc/hoqoozbe13\n. Chrome 26 seems to be fine for us as well, 27 is having this issue and also the drag & drop issue. These should be submitted to Chrome team.\n. So it seems KineticJS is now listed. I just tried Bower and it finds KineticJS, but uses 4.5.2, not the newest version. Is there a way to get it always use the latest version? It would be really nice to be able to use Bower for dependency management with KineticJS.\n. We have observed this same thing. Glad this is under consideration.\n.

HTML-tags got cut inside the append, here it is:\ninput type=\"text\" style=\"position:absolute; left:300px; top:300px\";\n. Okay thanks, that works. I tried to the container div, but then it didn't work and didn't think of making a new parent div. \n. This might be interesting for me as well. I have tried using my KineticJS project inside CocoonJS wrapper and there is a special way to scale the canvas:\ncanvas.style.cssText=\"idtkscale:SCALE_TYPE;\";\nBut if KineticJS creates the canvas, I haven't found a way to get that to work. If there was a way to create the canvas first myself - it might at least make it easier to use that property of CocoonJS.\n. This is very welcome addition, it helps with unwanted drag & drops that prevented tap/click actions triggering. I hope it is integrated to KineticJS. Thanks for the pull request.\n. We are also experiencing major problems in our canvas game if the user uses minus browser zoom. There are some graphics being drawn wrong while dragging and hit areas are not working as expected.\n\n. I like the proposed array methods to handle the points array.\n. This also happens for me. It is because pixelRatio != 1 for retina iPad and I guess clipping is not working correctly for > 1 pixelRatio. I forced the pixelRatio to be 1 and touch starts working even on retina iPad. Any chance to get this fixed for other pixelRatios as well?\n. +1 on Ring shape!\n. We have this issue as well. Touchend is never called if touch goes out of the listening node.

I can attach the image here and you can see it for yourself easily.\n\nGoing from slider to right (255) and back to center (0) works as expected on the lower bar, since it doesn't have opacity. But the higher bar, which has opacity, gets messed up. Here is a screenshot of the end situation:\n\nBoth bars should look the same, but as you can see, they clearly are not.\nHere is the code (your example with the added background and changed image reference):\nhttp://notepad.cc/hoqoozbe13\n. Chrome 26 seems to be fine for us as well, 27 is having this issue and also the drag & drop issue. These should be submitted to Chrome team.\n. So it seems KineticJS is now listed. I just tried Bower and it finds KineticJS, but uses 4.5.2, not the newest version. Is there a way to get it always use the latest version? It would be really nice to be able to use Bower for dependency management with KineticJS.\n. We have observed this same thing. Glad this is under consideration.\n.

It would be really nice to be able to use Bower for dependency management with KineticJS.\n. HTML-tags got cut inside the append, here it is:\ninput type=\"text\" style=\"position:absolute; left:300px; top:300px\";\n. Okay thanks, that works. I tried to the container div, but then it didn't work and didn't think of making a new parent div. \n. This might be interesting for me as well. I have tried using my KineticJS project inside CocoonJS wrapper and there is a special way to scale the canvas:\ncanvas.style.cssText=\"idtkscale:SCALE_TYPE;\";\nBut if KineticJS creates the canvas, I haven't found a way to get that to work. If there was a way to create the canvas first myself - it might at least make it easier to use that property of CocoonJS.\n. This is very welcome addition, it helps with unwanted drag & drops that prevented tap/click actions triggering. I hope it is integrated to KineticJS. Thanks for the pull request.\n. We are also experiencing major problems in our canvas game if the user uses minus browser zoom. There are some graphics being drawn wrong while dragging and hit areas are not working as expected.\n\n. I like the proposed array methods to handle the points array.\n. This also happens for me. It is because pixelRatio != 1 for retina iPad and I guess clipping is not working correctly for > 1 pixelRatio. I forced the pixelRatio to be 1 and touch starts working even on retina iPad. Any chance to get this fixed for other pixelRatios as well?\n. ",

Hi Eric - this approach does make the stage draggable, but does not\naccomplish the correct result on an iPad.  The rest of the document does\nnot scroll with the stage moving, it simply allows the user to drag the\nstage, yet content below the stage (off screen) stays hidden.  Any other\nsuggestions to try? Thanks.\n\nOn Sun, Apr 7, 2013 at 9:54 PM, Adam Furman afurman@furmantation.comwrote:\n\nSure, that is one form of scrolling.  I'll give this approach a try and\nprovide feedback.

Drag and drop the blue rect over the yellow rect: \"you get a mouseup event for the lower not dragged element\" as noted by hakhak.\n3. In some special cases shapes stays on the dragLayer after dragging:\n  a. Start dragging the yellow rect\n  b. Move the mouse cursor outside the canvas and release the mouse button\n  c. Move back the mouse cursor (and therefore the yellow rect) over the blue rect (mouse button is still up) and click: the yellow rect disappears. \n  d. Start dragging the blue rect: the yellow rect appears while you are dragging the blue rect.\nHope this very simple fiddle helps to fix/test these issues.\n. I think that it is not a big problem that the shape is still being dragged after the mouse button is released outside of the canvas. I think most users will quickly figure out what is going on and try to drop the shape by clicking the mouse button at the desired location.\nThe problem is that when you click on another shape (with the still dragged shape) KineticJS does not move back the shape from the dragLayer to the original layer. see: http://jsfiddle.net/gDXA5/3/\nFor me it would be sufficient to fix only this problem. I prefer the new drag-and-drop behaviour of KineticJS.\n. I had the same problem. A workaround is to set draggable to false in 'dragstart' instead of 'mousedown'.\nI tried to debug this problem and found that in the '_executeHandlers' function events.length = 2, but by the time events[i].handler.apply(this, [evt]) is executed the second time in the for loop, this.eventListeners['mousedown'] contains only one handler. By that time the second handler with name: 'kinetic' is deleted.\n. I ran into the same problem and created a test to see what is going on: \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/dfHgb/\nMove the mouse pointer around the edge of the top rectangle to see that the mousemove event is not fired for some of the pixels. Press the mouse button to display the neighboring pixel values.\nThe above test shows that anti-aliased pixels are indeed give different color values. I get this on my notebook for example: http://imgur.com/O8mThjy\nThe problem exists without scaling applied and it is happening in all four browsers I tried.\nI think Eric is right that this issue is rarely a problem, but in a few cases it can be quite annoying. Like in a game when the player has only one shot to click on an object (one object put together from primitive shapes like in the above test or there are several overlapping shapes on the screen) and the click is ignored.\nI do not have an idea how to address this on the shape level better than atis' proposal (to check neighboring pixels). However, as kind of a workaround, layer events could fire regardless of the colorKey. I think this would only cause a small performance hit, but it would provide a way for the developer to deal with this issue without hacking the kineticjs source files.\n. There is something reallly strange regarding the opacity values. On my notebook I always get 255 as opacity value even for anti-aliased pixels (tried three different browsers under Win7 and two browsers under OSX running on virtualBox). On another computer Chrome shows 254 value for AA pixels while IE9 shows 255 for the same pixels.\n. @ericdrowell I use layer.hitCanvas.context.getImageData in my test (copied the code from the getIntersection function) so I believe that I am picking out the pixel color from the hit graph.\n.

I think most users will quickly figure out what is going on and try to drop the shape by clicking the mouse button at the desired location.\nThe problem is that when you click on another shape (with the still dragged shape) KineticJS does not move back the shape from the dragLayer to the original layer. see: http://jsfiddle.net/gDXA5/3/\nFor me it would be sufficient to fix only this problem. I prefer the new drag-and-drop behaviour of KineticJS.\n. I had the same problem. A workaround is to set draggable to false in 'dragstart' instead of 'mousedown'.\nI tried to debug this problem and found that in the '_executeHandlers' function events.length = 2, but by the time events[i].handler.apply(this, [evt]) is executed the second time in the for loop, this.eventListeners['mousedown'] contains only one handler. By that time the second handler with name: 'kinetic' is deleted.\n. I ran into the same problem and created a test to see what is going on: \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/dfHgb/\nMove the mouse pointer around the edge of the top rectangle to see that the mousemove event is not fired for some of the pixels. Press the mouse button to display the neighboring pixel values.\nThe above test shows that anti-aliased pixels are indeed give different color values. I get this on my notebook for example: http://imgur.com/O8mThjy\nThe problem exists without scaling applied and it is happening in all four browsers I tried.\nI think Eric is right that this issue is rarely a problem, but in a few cases it can be quite annoying. Like in a game when the player has only one shot to click on an object (one object put together from primitive shapes like in the above test or there are several overlapping shapes on the screen) and the click is ignored.\nI do not have an idea how to address this on the shape level better than atis' proposal (to check neighboring pixels). However, as kind of a workaround, layer events could fire regardless of the colorKey. I think this would only cause a small performance hit, but it would provide a way for the developer to deal with this issue without hacking the kineticjs source files.\n. There is something reallly strange regarding the opacity values. On my notebook I always get 255 as opacity value even for anti-aliased pixels (tried three different browsers under Win7 and two browsers under OSX running on virtualBox). On another computer Chrome shows 254 value for AA pixels while IE9 shows 255 for the same pixels.\n. @ericdrowell I use layer.hitCanvas.context.getImageData in my test (copied the code from the getIntersection function) so I believe that I am picking out the pixel color from the hit graph.\n.

Have a look - perhaps it can help until \"real\" multitouch becomes available in Kinetic\n. I've been using GS with Kinetic for a while now (before 4.5) and I honestly can say its performance is amazing. It also allows a better control of transitions and animations that eventually makes code simpler and more reusable, so I am not planning to move back to other tweening solutions.\nSaid that, it makes a lot of sense for Kinetic to provide its own transitions in order to:\n- make the framework complete (every user will expect some form of transitions handling to be built-in)\n- keep Kinetic dependency-free\n- lower the learning curve for new comers (who otherwise have to learn GS as well)\n- allow any sort of distribution options under the Kinetic MIT license\n+1 for pulling back transitions into the framework\n+1 to allow developers to rely on GS if they want/can do so\n. I have seen this also on Chrome 27.0.1453.93 on OSX (circles rendering as rectangles if a stroke is specified).\nIn the attempt to reproduce a reduced testcase I restarted the browser and noticed that the problem went away.\nIt still sporadically reappears (esp. after a zillion refreshes of the page I am working on) - but then if I open a new tab to the very same content it does not show up again there (the problem does not go away on the tab that showed the problem no matter how many refreshes). So, IMO, this is a Chrome rendering bug and it has nothing to do with Kinetic or wrong code. It seems at some point the canvas rendering gets all messed up. BTW, I has similar issues with some mouse events disappearing altogether - also in that case a restart of the browser fixed the issue. Glad to know I haven't had hallucinations, though :)\n. I found many posts around that refer to this issue - which is not a Kinetic issue, for what I can tell, but a problem with Android browsers not implementing clearRect correctly. A work-around that seems to work is to use fillRect instead of clearRect on clear - but that of course assumes you know which fill to use and, in my tests, degrades performance quite a bit. Another hack that seems to do the trick is to reset the canvas width - which, depending on the browser, could be disastrous performance-wise or acceptable (but I haven't really tried that)\n. Probably related to #469 \n. I assume listening:false prevents the hitCanvas from being updated, which can be quite a performance saving in some cases (especially if you are not drawing simple primitives). By default I tend to set listening:false to all nodes unless they really need to handle events. It kinda feels like mouse/touch event listening behaviour could be defined in Kinetic the other way around: disabled by default and activated on the nodes that require user interaction (IIRC that's kinda what EaselJS does).\n.

    "ericmandel": "We have to be a bit careful here: most seemingly related FF reports are about the canvas not being updated. Here, we have offered an example where a textarea element is also not being updated. In addition, Kinetic calls can produce incorrect behavior in scenarios where pure canvas calls do not.\nSo, while this does appear to be a FF issue, verification is needed that Kinetic is not exacerbating a FF problem. Beyond that, the Kinetic-based examples might be more easily reproducible by FF experts than previously reported problems, implying that Kinetic experts might be able to help shed light on the problem.\nEric\n. Its good information to know that upgrading graphics drivers can fix the problem on some machines. But without knowing the decisions being made by FF regarding mousemove events (if indeed decisions are being made!) and whether Kinetic might be doing anything to exacerbate  the FF problem, the question of whether a given machine works with Kinetic can only have a random answer: a) today we tested a Linux Mint 13 machine which worked using FF 17, but failed spectacularly as soon as we upgraded to FF 18. b) we re-tested a CenOs machine that failed in the past but worked under a very light load. c) we tested a pretty powerful Ubuntu machine that worked fine, where previously it seemed that Ubuntu mostly failed.\nThe Linux Mint case (FF17 works, FF18 broken) is distressing because the graphics is handled by the integrated intel chip, so (to our knowledge) no driver update is available -- hence no driver upgrade fix. That's going in the wrong direction ....\nEric\n. Good news. We have fixed this problem on all previously broken Debian/Ubuntu machines (one CentOS outlier left to test) by setting  \u201cgfx.xrender.enabled\u201d to \u201cfalse\u201d in Firefox's about:config, as described here:\nhttp://www.hackermusings.com/2012/05/firefoxs-graphics-performance-on-x11/\n```\nIt\u2019s been long known that a vocal minority (or perhaps even\nmajority) of Firefox users have had issues with rendering\nperformance on X11, but nobody has quite pinpointed what the\nissue is.\nRecently Nicolas Silva landed a change in mozilla-central to\nadd a preference to allow for disabling the use of the RENDER\nextension when drawing using Cairo on X11. I\u2019d like to call on\nany Firefox/Linux users who have been experiencing speed\nissues to download the latest nightly and go to about:config\nand set \u201cgfx.xrender.enabled\u201d to \u201cfalse\u201d. If you could also\nlet me know what hardware and drivers you\u2019re running that\u2019d\nalso be great.\n```\nIn addition, Mac Firefox 18 appears to fix the related problem that occurs when hw acceleration is turned off in the Mac Firefox Preferences (see original report above).\nThis fix seems to span our full problem space, is simple to document, and is less invasive than upgrading hardware and/or drivers. Thus, we are closing our internal investigation, at least for the time being.\nEric\n. The bug reported in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=835064 could be of the same class. Recall that, for us, the problem was solved differently on the Mac than on Debian-derived machines (including Ubuntu), so it's likely not a single problem with a single solution.\nOn the Ubuntu machine I am testing right now, correct behavior of our Kinetic-enabled app requires setting  \u201cgfx.xrender.enabled\u201d (which became available sometime after v14) to \u201cfalse\u201d. The new suggestion, setting \"gfx.canvas.azure.enabled\" to \"false\", has no effect at all on our app running under Ubuntu. It does, however, fix the test page attached to that bug report.\nWe have one CentOs machine which was not fixed by setting \u201cgfx.xrender.enabled\u201d to \u201cfalse\u201d. I will test this new suggestion on Monday on that still-broken machine.\nGiven the fact that our Debian-derived machines were all fixed with the \u201cgfx.xrender.enabled\u201d work-around, but Macs were fixed with an upgrade to v18, the generic class of problem seems to be that Firefox's attempt to optimize rendering actually slows it down. If the problem depends on what type of optimization is being attempted (xrendr vs azure vs Mac),  the fix will require side-stepping the specific optimization code.\nRegards,\nEric\n. Sorry, Nevin, I don't have any specific insight: my shape-resizing code is modeled after the broken tutorial and, of course, is now broken in 4.3.1. My fear (not insight) is that the new use of a temporary top layer for drag/drop has broken the connection between the moving anchor and the rest of the shapes in the group, but it's not based on any data ....\nI could not get the v3.10.0 tutorial you mentioned to work in my local file:// environment using kinetic 4.1.2 or kinetic 4.3.1. I'm not sure why, but only a single horizontal line is displayed. Anyway, I do notice that \"your\" tutorial puts the anchors in one layer and the triangle in another, while \"my\" tutorial groups the anchors and the primary shape into a single group in one layer, so that the whole group can be displayed, removed, etc. in one operation. So if you can get \"your\" tutorial to work but not \"mine\", the separation of anchors and primary shape might be a clue.\nEric\n. Yes, I see that your triangle_test.html does work. But it is significantly different from the tutorial I pointed out at:\nhttp://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-resize-and-invert-images\nAll of the anchors and the triangle in triangle_test are separate shapes on a layer, while the broken tutorial above puts the anchors and primary shape (or image) into a group. \nNote that the fiddle you created does contain anchors at all and therefore is not relevant to the current problem, so far as I can see. I was not saying the image won't move, but rather that it does not resize as the anchors move.\nIt seems to me that the original question is still open: what changes must be made to the original (group-enabled)  tutorial to get it to work? As I said, this might not be a bug, just a change in API or a change in proper technique.\nSo I'm not sure how to proceed: it might be worthwhile modifying your triangle_test to put the anchors and triangle in a group, or it might be simpler to fix the original tutorial. Do you need me to check whether the triangle_test works with groups before you look at the original tutorial?\nEric\n. OK, thanks, I'll await your further investigations using the yoda tutorial page. For when you get back to it ... I see now that the bottomRight anchor works fine (resizes the image), but the other three are broken.\n\nusing stage.get instead of this.get\n\nAlso, the yoda code calls group.get(), not stage.get(), so if an API change was made (I don't see it in the changelog) that could be a problem.\nThanks for helping,\nEric\n. Good catch, your fix may be pointing to the root of the problem ... since it implies that this code does not work:\nvar topLeft = group.get(\".topLeft\")[0];\n    var topRight = group.get(\".topRight\")[0];\n... which either is a bug or a change to the API that we don't understand. Hopefully, an expert will weigh in.\nEric\n. Thanks, Eric, this fix works for me -- but only if I set dragOnTop to false for each shape in a group, not just the anchors. Otherwise, only some components of the group move, leaving others behind. If there is a way to turn off dragOnTop globally, please let me know: better to have a one-line fix than to change all of the many groups that I create. (Note that setting dragOnTop to false at the group level did not work -- each component had to be set).\nEric\n. Yes, of course. Perhaps I was not clear: the shape usually is erased, but every so often it is not erased, even though its destroyed (i.e. can no longer be dragged).\nEric\n. So you are saying that the fact that a call to group.setOffset() can change the position of a shape within the group is expected behavior? That sort of side effect sounds like a bug to me, but OK ... \nOn Nov 3, 2013, at 1:53 AM, Eric Rowell wrote:\n\nThis isn't a bug with KineticJS. The lab that you're referring to is just that, a lab.

I suppose so.\nSee also: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Blocklisting/Blocked_Graphics_Drivers\nEdit: Finally in my eyes the last question still is why I really need Hardware-Accelleration. Why Canvas doesnt work without it? That could really be some Firefox-Bug.\n. Good morning!\nI read the article word by word: Whats new for me is that \"gfx.canvas.azure.enabled\" may fix it.\nIn fact, i have seen one Laptop with a Nvidia 9300M GS, that wouldnt even work after newest driver install.\nSo far.. it seemed so within my short time analysis.\nI would love to test your \"gfx.canvas.azure.enabled\"-fix on it to see if we get some same fixing-behaviour. But I'm afraid that It is not available till monday.\n[On my Systems I couldn't find \"gfx.xrender.enabled\" (like ericmandel described) just some consimilar settings. Thatwhy I couldnt test this.]\nOne Idea:\nIf you render the link i posted as example-site (http://downfight.de/attmap/?level=1)\nAND if you see some rounded area with points and circles: \nAND if you experience --no-- tooltips at those Points/nonworking Machine, \nTHEN we could have seen the same bug.\nWorking excample on a good machine, http://prntscr.com/r1h72\nFirefox 18.0.1: http://prntscr.com/r1h9k\nabout:config: http://prntscr.com/r1hb6 -> not by me, maybe ATI driver did this.\nabout:config: http://prntscr.com/r1hcr\nAs far as I know my users just don't play my \"nonworking\" game or use Crome instead. Only some know the fix with driverupdates and they tell others. A real Fix by Firefox would be awsome!\n. Your Attachment works on this good machine: http://prntscr.com/r1hi2\nGreetings Stefan\n. Me again. I sent your Attachment to some User who still had my bug.\nHe gave answer: It is not well working on this machine.\nMy Code: Not working.\nYour Code: Not working.\nMy Code: He cant even move the \"map\" by dragging.\nYour Code: He is able to move the \"text\" but only if he klicks like 2-3 cm below it and drags.\nGreetings Stefan\n.

Hi Jack,\nI have no doubts that GS is better in all possible means. The code that I showed runs only once to start the animation, but the problem was that the animation itself was a bit less smooth, although both performed quite good and even the CPU usage was the same. On a faster computer or the one with SSD or even in a faster browser like Chrome the difference is not noticeable, but that does not help me, since I make the game for mobile devices, where every bit of FPS makes sense.\nMaybe the problem was really in the updated KJS or how I had to make tiny adjustments to some parts of the game to make it compatible with 4.5, I don't know. It was a pretty clear comparison on a real product: same codebase with different engines.\nI will try to test it in CocoonJS on a really old device to see if results repeat. There the difference is more noticeable.\nThanks for the great discussion!\n. Thanks for your hard work Eric!\nI did a few more tests on desktop and actually have not found any significant differences in performance. From the visual point of view both engines performed identical.\nRegarding CocoonJS, I was not able to test it, because 4.5 version had some serious problems with animations, although it worked fine on desktop. Properties were tweening, but only one redraw was being executed though the whole tween. Maybe it has something to do with batchDraw, CJS delays RAF or something. Anyway, if 4.5.1 won't fix this I will investigate it more deeply.\n. Thanks for your comment Jack!\nEric, onFinished seems to not work.\n. Well, in the blacklist you still have onFinished and I don't see any onFinish events fired...\nAre you asking about those 4.5 animation problems? I experienced not in Safari, but in CocoonJS and I am not sure if they are even related to this bug.\n. nope, you're mistaking with PhoneGap\nCocoonJS is separate browser-like emulator for canvas only\n. OK, I got it.\nI changed one very performance critical setter from attrs.x/y to setX/Y. Before I was using attrs.x/y directly, since in that place true setters were giving a huge impact on performance with those pre and post actions.\nTo solve this I use direct setting through attrs and manually clear cachedTransform on every node before the draw. This works, but it is of course bad in terms of encapsulation.\nWith that fix performance wise everything seems to be OK and maybe even better in some places, so good job!\n. mm, no, I am saying that using node.attrs.x = x is faster than node.setX(x)\n. Yes, like I mentioned earlier there is a lot of stuff happening in those setters so for performance critical stuff they are a bit of an overkill.\nIf I comment out those things than a lot of my logic would not work, so the test would not show much, but I see no other reasons why setters could be slow. The core reason seems to be that the event is propagated though the whole tree, but generally you don't need that to happen anyway.\n. OK, I'll give it a try today.\nWouldn't making change events with cancelBubble = true by default be better? I mean, why would some upper level node want to know if some lower node changed it's property or not. If it really wants to, then it would be better to pass a reference to this node and listen only on this node for the event.\n. Well, my mobile tests showed that things improved, but setting properties directly is still a bit faster. I guess it is just a really performance critical part of the app, where every tiny bit of CPU matters.\n. initially I think the framework had a proper class system, but it was dropped in v4.0.1 (see changelog):\n- Dependency on Class utility has been removed because it was really slowing down Node instantiations. New custom solution is about 2x faster\n.

I guess it is just a really performance critical part of the app, where every tiny bit of CPU matters.\n. initially I think the framework had a proper class system, but it was dropped in v4.0.1 (see changelog):\n- Dependency on Class utility has been removed because it was really slowing down Node instantiations. New custom solution is about 2x faster\n. That's so awesome!\nJust a few days ago had this idea.\nI am starting a new Kinetic project with TypeScript, so I would definitely give it a try!\nPS- make sure you include it here: https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped\n.

See the event firing in the div below the container.\nSee the comments in the javascript file. Basically, the hit testing on opaque background is not working.\nI will try to install ruby in order to play with the code (and run the tests too)...\nBTW, we would like to sponsor your project by contributing to it. We do lots of interactive experiences and Kinetic is really a nice piece of code and we plan to use it a lot. I read your release plans, and would be happy to help. To dot hesitate to contact me if you are interested. \n. I tried setting a size to my custom shape and separate background layer from circle layer and the problem is still there.\n. Thanks for your help. We definitively will send some PR. As per the financial sponsoring, I will see what I can do.\nThis is kind of sad, the limitation of one path. Why/how did this constraint have been set ?\nLike I said, I tried to separate the background layer from the other ones, but it does not resolve the problem. Are you saying that I should not use a custom shape for my background ? Can I draw directly on the layer ? How ?\nThanks again.\n. Thanks for your answer. Well performance is a no brainer, I should have thought about it.\nSo we use shapes just as we used integers and boolean, and should create Groups just like we create Classes! Nice!\n\nJust for reference, this is the working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/HZfNC/6/ (not working in Chrome Canary though, the 'empty filled' shape is being considered \"outside\")\nIt works by creating a new extended class from the Layer.\n\nThere is one thing that's been bothering me since I started to play with Kinetic. Extending classes created with prototype sucks hard. (see the anonynous function in the fiddle) Would you like to have a better way to extend base classes ? Something a little by like jQuery's extends method ? Then each shape could be extended easily.\nI send a PR on that maybe later today.\n. And I just forked the project... Which branch contains the \"dev\" code ? Which branch to you prefer to get PR in ?\n. Look at this:\njavascript\nKinetic.extend = function(base, members, ctor) {\n    var C = ctor || function () {};\n    C.prototype = new base();\n    C.prototype.constructor = C;\n    $.extend(C.prototype, members);\n    return C;\n};\nEDIT: Note that $.extend is jQuery extends. It could be a simple object's member copy.\nAnd after that, in other classes:\njavascript\nKinetic.Layer.extend = function(members, ctor) {\n    return Kinetic.extend(Kinetic.Layer, members, ctor);\n};\nWould this affect performance a lot ???\nI use this pattern in my current project in other to create a \"extended\" layer. And it looks great.\njavascript\nBackgroundLayer = Kinetic.Layer.extend({\n    drawScene: function() {\n        ...\n    }\n};\nvar bg = new BackgroundLayer();\n. Great :)\n. Good. Well in the mean time, I will try to install Ruby... :(\n. Good!\n. Damn. I should've RTFM.\nSorry about that. I just hate representing the array like that. I would prefer [[0, 'blue'], [0, 'black']].\n. Yeah I really like the idea about the 2d array (just the same as points in a line).\nThis makes the code really easier to read. Thanks.\n. This is normal. You have to wait for the image to be loaded first. Please check the onload event of the image before adding your fill pattern to the scene.\n. > and I didn't want to bloat KineticJS with logic not related to canvas\nYou are absolutely right. You can even use jquery for this\njavascript\nvar i = new Image();\n$(i).load(function () { ... });\ni.src = '/path/to/image';\nAlways remember to add the load handler BEFORE you set the src.\n.

But I meant http://cdnjs.com/. 4.4.0 is not there yet.\nAnd do you know why 26 broke all those things ?\n. Use 'mouseover' event.\n. @vvMINOvv  Yeah that's one solution. Or, you could try to group the nodes into a 'group' and listen on that too.\n. @vvMINOvv Actually, mouseover only fires 'on enter'.\n. Absolutely!\n. @ericdrowell Thanks you so much for your time eric.\n. Awesome!!!\n. >  Could you post a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem?\nI will do that right now.\n. Bug reproduced here: http://jsfiddle.net/HZfNC/4/. Try to hover on the yellow circle. See the event firing in the div below the container.\nSee the comments in the javascript file. Basically, the hit testing on opaque background is not working.\nI will try to install ruby in order to play with the code (and run the tests too)...\nBTW, we would like to sponsor your project by contributing to it. We do lots of interactive experiences and Kinetic is really a nice piece of code and we plan to use it a lot. I read your release plans, and would be happy to help. To dot hesitate to contact me if you are interested. \n. I tried setting a size to my custom shape and separate background layer from circle layer and the problem is still there.\n. Thanks for your help. We definitively will send some PR. As per the financial sponsoring, I will see what I can do.\nThis is kind of sad, the limitation of one path. Why/how did this constraint have been set ?\nLike I said, I tried to separate the background layer from the other ones, but it does not resolve the problem. Are you saying that I should not use a custom shape for my background ? Can I draw directly on the layer ? How ?\nThanks again.\n. Thanks for your answer. Well performance is a no brainer, I should have thought about it.\nSo we use shapes just as we used integers and boolean, and should create Groups just like we create Classes! Nice!\n\nJust for reference, this is the working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/HZfNC/6/ (not working in Chrome Canary though, the 'empty filled' shape is being considered \"outside\")\nIt works by creating a new extended class from the Layer.\n\nThere is one thing that's been bothering me since I started to play with Kinetic. Extending classes created with prototype sucks hard. (see the anonynous function in the fiddle) Would you like to have a better way to extend base classes ? Something a little by like jQuery's extends method ? Then each shape could be extended easily.\nI send a PR on that maybe later today.\n. And I just forked the project... Which branch contains the \"dev\" code ? Which branch to you prefer to get PR in ?\n. Look at this:\njavascript\nKinetic.extend = function(base, members, ctor) {\n    var C = ctor || function () {};\n    C.prototype = new base();\n    C.prototype.constructor = C;\n    $.extend(C.prototype, members);\n    return C;\n};\nEDIT: Note that $.extend is jQuery extends. It could be a simple object's member copy.\nAnd after that, in other classes:\njavascript\nKinetic.Layer.extend = function(members, ctor) {\n    return Kinetic.extend(Kinetic.Layer, members, ctor);\n};\nWould this affect performance a lot ???\nI use this pattern in my current project in other to create a \"extended\" layer. And it looks great.\njavascript\nBackgroundLayer = Kinetic.Layer.extend({\n    drawScene: function() {\n        ...\n    }\n};\nvar bg = new BackgroundLayer();\n. Great :)\n. Good. Well in the mean time, I will try to install Ruby... :(\n. Good!\n. Damn. I should've RTFM.\nSorry about that. I just hate representing the array like that. I would prefer [[0, 'blue'], [0, 'black']].\n. Yeah I really like the idea about the 2d array (just the same as points in a line).\nThis makes the code really easier to read. Thanks.\n. This is normal. You have to wait for the image to be loaded first. Please check the onload event of the image before adding your fill pattern to the scene.\n. > and I didn't want to bloat KineticJS with logic not related to canvas\nYou are absolutely right. You can even use jquery for this\njavascript\nvar i = new Image();\n$(i).load(function () { ... });\ni.src = '/path/to/image';\nAlways remember to add the load handler BEFORE you set the src.\n.

Unfortunately the need to set the position after adding the group would require me to re-write my entire application as I have hundreds of objects all being organized in groups .

Max layers i could create 52, than the safari crashed.\nAs a canvas is basicly nothing more than an image I've did the same test with some divs containg a same sized image: same result...\nMy guess is that is has nothing to do with Kinetic / Canvas, but the resource limitations of iDivece(s)\n. Nice job! Looking forward to :)\n. I have a same issue on tabs. Destroying layers and creating new ones eventually causes my device to crash. It also seems to come in some kind of loop where it is destroying and hiding the layers i was working with (the canvas ellements are visible in the DOM but are flashing in my browser view)\n. I experience only issues at a Samsung Galaxy Note Tab. It seems it simply does not receive/handles touch input with Kinetic. (i've tried the tutorials and labs on KineticJS.com as well). \n. I expierience the same problem. What i DO se is that the interaction is still available! (hitregions are being drawn)\nI guess it's a chrome issue though...\n. Tahks for the reply,\nBut clearing the cache and setting the opacity to 0 will resolve into an non-clickable region because all pixels have 0 opacity.\n. Is it possible to manually replace the image data (stripped with opacity pixels)\n. Thanks. I was experimenting with that already. I think i'll wait for the update. Nothing is broken yet.. :-)\n. ",

    "atis--": "After thinking about this though I can see where the confusion comes from. \"dragstart\" and \"dragmove\" events are generated from \"mousemove\" event which may not be associated with a specific mouse button (depending on underlying event implementation).

When you scale things down (make 'em smaller), suddenly the anti-aliasing starts playing a bigger role since there's a lot more of it going on, and the likelihood of hitting an anti-aliased pixel increases.\nAlso this is only ever a problem when two shapes overlap (and both are listening for mouse events).\n.

    "wighawag": "Cool, just tested and it works :)\nMy workaround had its own problem when releasing mouse outside the stage\nThanks\n. Hi Hackencrash\nThe original source (look in github) are spread into separate files. \nThis is line 482 of Stage.js\nBut as you said it is line 5176 in the generated js file\nHope that make sense\n. OK\nI understand stage behavior and I think this is a behavior that makes sense except maybe the word \"draggable\"\nBut regarding layer, since like stage it also act as a container only, I expected it behave similarly than stage regarding the draggable property.\nThe problem can be stated as follow:\nThe main reason someone want to pan the stage is when you have a set of objects that span more space than the viewport (stage width and height). As soon as you want to add a static layer on top of it you cannot anymore use (stage {draggable : true}) because this would pan this layer as well. Making layer panable individually would work though (but maybe this will add other issues?).\nmaybe we could add an option. or have another property name. If you can give me some pointer I could have a look at implementing it myself and make a pull request\nFor now, the one workarround I can see for achieving what I want is to make the UI coordinate follow the stage coordinate by applying an inverse transition but I was hoping there were another more elegant solution\nThanks\n. Hi Eric\nThanks for your quick replies\nYour solution using dom handler seems indeed possible, \nbut then in the dom event handler we have no information regarding the event in term of Kinetic state. For example I might want to do something different whether the click is on a node or not \nWithout Kinetic providing an API for that I would need to do it myself, maybe by calling Kinetic specific function (getIntersection)\njavascript\ncontainer.addEventListener(\"click\", function(e){\n//how do I know whether it was click on empty space or a node ?\nobj = stage.getIntersection(mousePosition);\n//...\n})\non the other with kinetic support, i would be able to do in a much cleaner way without the need to know Kinetic internals:\njavascript\nstage.on(\"click\", function(e){\nif(e.targetNode == stage) {//or null ?\n///create an shape on the pointer position\n}else{\n///delete the shape (e.targetNode) \n}\n})\nwhat do you think?\n. I decided to have a go at implementing it my self, see the pull request : https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/364\n. Hi Eric\nI took a look at the source code while debugging and the issue is that _endDrag* functions are called before the mouseup event so when the execution reach mouseup, Kinetic js is not anymore in state of dragging. Thus the click event is fired\nthe following condition is thus true \nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/Stage.js\nline 445-449:\njavascript\n                    /*\n                     * if dragging and dropping, or if click doesn't map to \n                     * the correct shape, don't fire click or dbl click event\n                     */\n                    if(!go.isDragging() && shape._id === this.clickStartShape._id) {\nI also found this code with the relevant comment:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/blob/master/src/DragAndDrop.js \nline 224\n``` javascript\n    // listen for capturing phase so that the _endDrag* methods are\n    // called before the stage mouseup event is triggered in order\n    // to render the hit graph just in time to pick up the event\n    var html = document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0];\n    html.addEventListener('mouseup', Kinetic.DD._endDragBefore, true);\n    html.addEventListener('touchend', Kinetic.DD._endDragBefore, true);\nhtml.addEventListener('mouseup', Kinetic.DD._endDragAfter, false);\nhtml.addEventListener('touchend', Kinetic.DD._endDragAfter, false);\n\n```\nSo I am not sure what to do here :)\nHope that it helps\n. @c-ice\nAs a workaround you can use a stageDragging variable that you set and unset on dragstart and dragend events\nsee http://jsfiddle.net/um4a2/\n. @ericdrowell \nI did not tested and read the code correctly :p\n_endDragBefore is called before\nbut _endDragAfter is called after\nmake sense :)\nso this means I just had to move \njavascript\ndd.isDragging = false;\nto the _endDragAfter function and it seems to have fixed it\n. HI Eric\nDid you read my comment on https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/356 ?\nIn other words : how in Kinetic can I listen for events that happen on stage but not on any node ?\nThere are some valid use case for this. One of them is dragging and this is why in your current code you need to have special if statement to deal with dragging the stage. \nOn the other hand with stage events as you can see in my pull request there is no more need for special stage dragging code.\nAnother use case is when you want to do something when you click on empty space (add a new circle for example) and something different when you click on a particular node (select it for example)\nOf course this can be achieved using DOM events and some special code to know whether the pointer is not above any node but would not be nicer if this was part of Kinetic (look at the code example in the comment  on https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/356)?\nI understand if you want to keep as it is, I just want to make sure you understand the possible use case :)\nThanks for your work\n. that would work, but this is not as nice as with my modif. \nI might just keep my fork :)\nthanks anyway\n. Cool, just tested and it works :)\nMy workaround had its own problem when releasing mouse outside the stage\nThanks\n. Hi Hackencrash\nThe original source (look in github) are spread into separate files. \nThis is line 482 of Stage.js\nBut as you said it is line 5176 in the generated js file\nHope that make sense\n. OK\nI understand stage behavior and I think this is a behavior that makes sense except maybe the word \"draggable\"\nBut regarding layer, since like stage it also act as a container only, I expected it behave similarly than stage regarding the draggable property.\nThe problem can be stated as follow:\nThe main reason someone want to pan the stage is when you have a set of objects that span more space than the viewport (stage width and height). As soon as you want to add a static layer on top of it you cannot anymore use (stage {draggable : true}) because this would pan this layer as well. Making layer panable individually would work though (but maybe this will add other issues?).\nmaybe we could add an option. or have another property name. If you can give me some pointer I could have a look at implementing it myself and make a pull request\nFor now, the one workarround I can see for achieving what I want is to make the UI coordinate follow the stage coordinate by applying an inverse transition but I was hoping there were another more elegant solution\nThanks\n. Hi Eric\nThanks for your quick replies\nYour solution using dom handler seems indeed possible, \nbut then in the dom event handler we have no information regarding the event in term of Kinetic state. For example I might want to do something different whether the click is on a node or not \nWithout Kinetic providing an API for that I would need to do it myself, maybe by calling Kinetic specific function (getIntersection)\njavascript\ncontainer.addEventListener(\"click\", function(e){\n//how do I know whether it was click on empty space or a node ?\nobj = stage.getIntersection(mousePosition);\n//...\n})\non the other with kinetic support, i would be able to do in a much cleaner way without the need to know Kinetic internals:\njavascript\nstage.on(\"click\", function(e){\nif(e.targetNode == stage) {//or null ?\n///create an shape on the pointer position\n}else{\n///delete the shape (e.targetNode) \n}\n})\nwhat do you think?\n. I decided to have a go at implementing it my self, see the pull request : https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/364\n.

You've declared the other variables in scope but not 'layer', meaning that every time you resize the stage (e.g. when iPad orientation is changed from portrait to landscape to make the contents fit properly), the value of layer returned back to the app using js is always the last layer created (because of the for loop on line 6400 in kjs 4.5.4)\n.

It has a connection with the error I mentioned before:\nh.addColorStop(g[i],g[i+1])\non kineticJS.js, line 28 character 7356\nWhat it makes more strange is that I have another object with radialgradientfill which works fine in FF and IE.\nvar lichtrondje = new Kinetic.Circle({\n                  x: 0,\n                  y: 0,\n                  radius: 90,\n                  fillRadialGradientStartPoint: 0,\n                  fillRadialGradientStartRadius: 0,\n                  fillRadialGradientEndPoint: 0,\n                  fillRadialGradientEndRadius: 90,\n                  fillRadialGradientColorStops: [0, '#DDD', 1, 'rgba(0,0,0, 0.0)'],\n                  opacity: 1,\n                  id: 'lichtrondje' + x,\n                  name: 'lichtrondje'\n            });\nI have found out that the result looks different between the Chrome version and the FF and IE version. The right one is what its intended.\n\n. The bug was that i forgot to have a '#' sign in the fillRadialGradientColorStops array.\nChrome was less strict in it (making it more confusing) Thanks Eric for the help on stackoverflow!\n. Everything worked when you save the objects within a group object instead of a layer\n. I got the same issue that the circle is displayed as rectangle. Strangely I have this only on my last project and not my previous which both uses the latest KineticJS. I have debugged and I am pretty sure I haven't made mistakes. I use 64-bit Windows 8 with chrome.\nOw now I have updated to the latest (27.0.1453.94) it's working perfectly again!\n. I have posted that I didn't had issues anymore with the Chrome (27.0.1453.94) version but now my circles are rectangles again :/ Strangely 2 other projects with the same latest KineticJS works still perfectly on the (27.0.1453.94) Chrome version\n. No, It did also occur on Windows 8 64bit Chrome. But now again it works fine and when it previous did happen it didn't happen on all my projects with my latest KineticJS version. \n. ",

Hi, thanks for your answer!!\nIm novice in programming also more with kinetics, I cant overrride methods because It is so difficult for me.\nI achieved to fix the problem with the squash canvas image with this:\nfunction detectVerticalSquash(img) {                    var iw = img.naturalWidth, ih = img.naturalHeight;                    var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');                    canvas.width = 1;                    canvas.height = ih;                    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');                    ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);                    var data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, ih).data;                    // search image edge pixel position in case it is squashed vertically.                    var sy = 0;                    var ey = ih;                    var py = ih;                    while (py > sy) {                        var alpha = data[(py - 1) * 4 + 3];                        if (alpha === 0) {                            ey = py;                        } else {                            sy = py;                        }                        py = (ey + sy) >> 1;                    }                    var ratio = (py / ih);                    return (ratio===0)?1:ratio;                }var verticalSquashRatio = detectVerticalSquash(img);var testHeight = 332.598425197 / verticalSquashRatio;\nvar image1 = new Kinetic.Image({                                    x: 9,                                   y: 8,                                   width: 238.11023622,                                    height: testHeight,                                 name: \"image\",                                  image:img,                                  crop: [getX, getY, getWidth, getHeight]                             });\nBut....When I add text to the canvas image I have also the same problems and I dont know how fix....it is strange!!\nThanks&Regards!!\nDate: Sun, 3 Nov 2013 16:48:53 -0800\nFrom: notifications@github.com\nTo: KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nCC: valero_albatera@hotmail.com\nSubject: Re: [KineticJS] Fix Issue Where Large Images Get Vertically Squashed In iOS6 & iOS7 (#654)\nI'll take a look at this when I can.

    "ippo615": "Thanks! I merged the code from #527 which seemed like the same issue. It's in commit 8b7b3db9ef.\n. The filtered image was being drawn in a temporary canvas where it was\npreviously drawn. With each draw, the alpha-values of the image increased\nuntil they hit 255 (effectively removing the alpha channel).\nTo fix it: I created a clear canvas each time the filter is applied. This fix\nshould be in the latest commit.\n. That was my first attempt - I used something like context.clearRect(0,0,width,height) but it didn't fix the problem. Perhaps I put that code in the wrong spot...\n. 1) Yes. That happens because the convolution matrix is looking for pixels that are past the edge of the image. I should either make it \"tile-able\" or just extend those edge pixels. I wasn't sure which would be more appropriate. Perhaps a 'filterIsTileable' flag to determine which the user wants?\n2) Ah, I didn't realize Brighten could do that. That sounds like a better option (and probably faster) than mine.\n3) Yes I could change that to ConvolutePack and similar for ColorPack. Would it be desirable to break them down further? or would that require a different file structure and too much repetitive code? About the verb naming convention: I was trying to name them verbs but didn't do a good job (shoulda got a thesaurus :-), I'd love to hear your suggestions.\n4) That's awesome! I'll work on restructuring those filters so that they are tweenable with 0 meaning no effect and 100 being the max. Is [0-100] the range you've been using (with negatives allowed when appropriate)?\n5) The my blur function should be the same as the existing Blur filter. My \"soft blur\" is slightly different than a \"regular\" blur. A soft blur first blurs the image then blends it with the unblurred image. I handle a soft blur as 1 operation, if we implemented it with the existing filter it would take blurring time + blending time which I'm guessing would be a bit slower than mine. I think mine is easier to maintain and would keep the files smaller but I don't know which performs better.\nI think KineticJS is an awesome project and I'm happy to help out! I'll try to work on these but probably won't get to it anything until Tuesday night so if you want to start some edits or send more suggestions that's cool.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi! Sorry, I didn't see any message about joining the KineticJS team but I'd like to talk with you about it. I put my personal email address in my profile so you can contact me using that address.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not sure what your goal is but here are some things I noticed.\nIn http://jsfiddle.net/SLrTj/2/ in line 77 in the JavaScript you have PageListS[0]. I think you want pageListS[0] (lower case p at the beginning).\nCheck out Mozilla's Array documentation for using two-dimensional arrays:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\nThe section on 2d arrays in near the end but basically, I think you want something like:\n// Create an array of 2 arrays\npageList = [[],[]];\n// Access the 3rd element of the 0th array\npageList[0][3] \n// As you had:\npageList[0][i] // similar to your pageList[0+i*2]\npageList[1][i] // similar to your pageList[1+i*2]\n. Currently, textHeight is the height of an individual character and lineHeight is a ratio controlling how tall the line is compared to a character.\nFor example a textHeight of 16 and a lineHeight of 2 gives a line which is 2*16=32 units tall and has characters which are 16 units tall (there will be some space between the lines). A textHeight of 12 and a lineHeight of 0.5 creates lines 6 units tall with the characters are 12 units tall (ie lines will overlap slightly).\nYou can determine how many lines of text you have with yourStringObj.split('\\n').length or kineticTextObj.textArr.length. You can determine the total height of your block of text by multiplying by both the lineHeight and textHeight. The following should give you the height of your text block (similar to the width):\ntext.getTextHeight()*text.getLineHeight()*text.textArr.length\ntext is your Kinetic.Text object.\n. Hi, I think you need to round your stage width like so:\n//Defining Stage\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n    container : 'container',\n    width : Math.floor(viewportWidth*.75) + 100,\n    height : viewportHeight + 26,\n    name : 'container',\n    id : 'stageWindow'\n});\nYou are specifying a canvas to be a fractional number (1366*0.75 = 1024.5) of pixels wide. That fractional part is probably what's making your line blurry. (And make sure your browser's zoom is set to 100%, took me a while to realize 125% zoom makes everything blurry ;-)\nClose this if that fixes it for you.\n. Glad you could figure it out!\n. Thanks! It's been merged\n. Hi (nice report)! Instead of removing children, try destroying them:\nkLayer.destroyChildren();\nWhen I ran your code with removeChildren() - my memory usage kept increasing (I managed to push it over 1 gig) however, it was cleared once I closed the tab.\nI also ran your code with destroyChildren() and my memory usage also increased but it eventually levelled off (around a few 100 mB).\nI think we're trying to be conservative with our filter handling code but I'll double check to make sure we haven't overlooked anything.\n. To summarize this: use kLayer.destroyChildren(); in your code.\nThis is what you should expect: If you're clicking the button only occasionally - your memory usage should be effectively constant. However, if you're clicking the button really fast (more than once ever 20 seconds in my tests) the memory usage will rise until you don't click the button for a while. Then it should drop to a level just above where it was when your image didn't have a filter.\nReopen or start a new issue if something else bugs you.\n. Thank you! These should be fixed now\n. Don't change the width or height of the DOM image. Use temporary variables to store the width and height of your image, for example:\nvar w = img.width;\nvar h = img.height\nif(w > scaleWidth) {\n    h = scaleWidth / (img.width / img.height);\n    w = scaleWidth;\n}\n_userPicImg = new Kinetic.Image({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0,\n    image: img,\n    name: \"image\",\n    width:w,\n    height:h\n});\nCheck it out in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/n2veK/\n. Thanks for doing this!\n. There is no way to apply a filter to a shape; however, I am working on adding support for filters to be applied to layers. You could put all of the shapes you want to filter on one layer and then apply the filter to the layer in the layer's \"draw\" event. NOTE: this is only in the latest version on Github.\nYou can look through some of the unit tests for examples of applying a filter to a layer: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/tree/master/test/unit/filters \nHere's a quick example which pixelates the left half of a layer:\nlayer.on('draw', function () {\n  var imageData = this.getContext().getImageData(0, 0, this.getCanvas().width/2, this.getCanvas().height);\n  var scratchData = this.getContext().createImageData(imageData); // only size copied\n  Kinetic.Filters.Pixelate(imageData,scratchData,{pixelWidth:8,pixelHeight:16});\n  this.getContext().putImageData(scratchData,0,0);\n});\nLet me know if you have suggestions, feedback or questions. I may not have updated the interface for the particular filter you want to use - let me know which one and I'll move it to the top of my priority list.\n. Could you create a jsfiddle for us? I think there may be a problem where you compute index or midpointX/Y.\nYou seem to be adding points the correct way. You can verify that by going to the polygon example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-polygon-tutorial/ and then adding this code to the end:\nvar points = poly.points();\npoints.splice(6,0,420,36);\npoly.draw();\n. You could call .removeChildren() on each layer, then redraw the stage:\nlayer.removeChildren();\nlayer2.removeChildren();\nstage.draw();\nOr you could redraw each layer after removing them:\nstage.removeChildren();\n  layer.draw();\n  layer2.draw();\nOn Thu, Mar 27, 2014 at 4:49 AM, JercSi notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI have an issue with new version - 5.0.2.\nstage.removeChildren() removes the layers (stage.getChildren().length ==\n0), but it still shows the object on the stage.\nExample: http://jsbin.com/tiyiyada/1/edit\nVersion 5.0.2 is still showing two Rectangle objects\nVersion 5.0.1 does not show anything\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/866\n.\n. Is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/eL2rr/1/\nI set the x and y to the same value for each object. Then I needed to adjust the points so instead of being absolute on the canvas they were relative to the x, y of the line.\n. I believe you want to use .on('frameIndexChange', ... for example:\n\nsprite.on('frameIndexChange', function(evt) {\n    if( evt.newVal === 0 ){\n        console.log('Animation Started');\n    }\n});\nSee http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-sprite-tutorial/ for more info. Hope this helps!\n. First of all, you're trying to applying Kinetic getters/setters to a HTML image. This is wrong:\nvar imagj = new Image();\nimagj.onload = function() {\n    var x = new Kinetic.Image(/* ... */);\n    // ...\n};\nimagj.cache();\nimagj.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\nimagj.blue(bleu);\nimagj.red(rouge);\nimagj.green(vert);\nThis is correct:\n```\nvar imagj = new Image();\nimagj.onload = function() {\n    var x = new Kinetic.Image(/ ... /);\n// ...\n\nx.cache();\nx.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\nx.blue(bleu);\nx.red(rouge);\nx.green(vert);\n\n// ...\n\nlayerB.draw();\n\n};\n```\nSecondly, you're using an image from the domain: http://kineticjs.com/ but you're running the code on the domain: http://jsfiddle.net This is a security problem. Your console will say \"Kinetic warning: Unable to apply filter. The operation is insecure.\" To fix that I would just make sure your image is coming from the same domain that your code is running on.\nThe weird part is that even after I updated your fiddle it still is gives the security warning http://jsfiddle.net/5gF2c/4/ but that is fine because you can see it working elsewhere.\nTo see the example working goto http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-invert-image-tutorial/ and put the following code in the script tag of the code editor:\n```\nvar imagj = new Image();\nimagj.onload = function() {\n    var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n      container: 'container',\n      width: 400,\n      height: 500\n    });\nvar layerB = new Kinetic.Layer();\n\nvar kineticImage = new Kinetic.Image({\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  image: imagj,\n  draggable: true\n});\n\nlayerB.add(kineticImage);\nstage.add(layerB);\n\nkineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\nkineticImage.red(0);\nkineticImage.green(255);\nkineticImage.blue(0);\n\nlayerB.draw();\n\n};\nimagj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n```\nHope this helps!\n. I'd make 2 tiny changes which will make your function reusable:\n1) You can get which layer to redraw from the image with kineticImage.getLayer(). This prevents you from having to change the layer (layerB) if you draw the image on a different layer.\n2) I would pass kineticImage as an argument so that you can use this function for any image. Right now you may only be using this for one image, but what if you wanted to apply it to several images? This will make it easier for you to do that.\nHere's how I would write the function:\nfunction rbg(kineticImage,red,blue,green){\n    kineticImage.cache();\n    kineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n    kineticImage.red(red);\n    kineticImage.green(green);\n    kineticImage.blue(blue);\n    kineticImage.getLayer().draw();\n}\nThen don't forget to pass the extra argument, for example: rgb(kineticImage,0,255,0);.\nYou can also chain the methods for a more compact syntax:\nkineticImage.red(0).green(255).blue(0);\nYou may not like the look of it but it is a nice trick to use when your code gets long ;-)\n. My guess is you are removing the RGB filter when you apply the brightness filter. Here is a working example:\n```\nvar imageObj = new Image();\nimageObj.onload = function() {\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n  container: 'container',\n  width: 578,\n  height: 300\n});\n\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\ndarth = new Kinetic.Image({\n  x: 10,\n  y: 10,\n  image: imageObj,\n  draggable: true\n});\n\nlayer.add(darth);\nstage.add(layer);\n\ndarth.cache();\ndarth.red(128).green(0).blue(0);\n\n// Note: brightness values are between -1.0 (makes image black)\n// and +1.0 (makes image white); 0.0 does not change image\ndarth.brightness(-0.8);\n\n// Notice how an array is passed to filters\n// the array has both filters that we want to apply\ndarth.filters([Kinetic.Filters.Brighten,Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n\ndarth.getLayer().draw();\n\n};\nimageObj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n```\nYou can place that in script tag on http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-brighten-or-darken-image-tutorial/ to see it working.\nYou need to pass BOTH filters to .filters([...]). Make sure you're using kineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB,Kinetic.Filters.Brighten]);\nHope this helps! (if it doesn't, post some code or a fiddle)\n. I think I see what you want to do: in that function you're saving the red, green, blue, and brightness values then applying them if your function is not passed a new parameter. Try this:\n```\n// These global variables are no longer needed becuase\n// kineticImage remembers the value\n// var red, green, blue, alphix;\nfunction rgb(kineticImage, rouge, vert, bleu, alpha) {\n// No worries, I left this part in for you ;-)\nif (kineticImage === undefined) {\n    kineticImage = testImage;\n}\n\nkineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.Brighten, Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n\n// Only update the properties that were passed as arguments\nif (alpha !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.brightness(alpha / 50.0);\n}\nif (rouge !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.red(rouge);\n}\nif (vert !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.green(vert);\n}\nif (bleu !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.blue(bleu);\n}\n\nkineticImage.getLayer().draw();\n\n}\n```\nKinetic stores the values (red,green,blue,brightness,x,y, etc...) for you so you don't have to worry about storing or resetting them. All you have to do is change them when you need to.\nHere's an example of it working. For 5 seconds you should see a \"regular\" image, then it will change to a blue image with a little bit of brightness added, and then the filter will add some red in so it will look like a purple image:\n```\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        // These global variables are no longer needed becuase\n        // kineticImage should remember the value\n        // var red, green, blue, alphix;\n        function rgb(kineticImage, rouge, vert, bleu, alpha) {</p>\n<pre><code>        // No worries, I left this part in for you ;-)\n        if (kineticImage === undefined) {\n            kineticImage = testImage;\n        }\n\n        kineticImage.cache();\n        kineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.Brighten, Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n\n        // Only update the properties that were passed as arguments\n        if (alpha !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.brightness(alpha / 50.0);\n        }\n        if (rouge !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.red(rouge);\n        }\n        if (vert !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.green(vert);\n        }\n        if (bleu !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.blue(bleu);\n        }\n\n        kineticImage.getLayer().draw();\n    }\n\n    // Example of rgb function being used\n\n    var imageObj = new Image();\n    var testImage;\n\n    imageObj.onload = function () {\n        var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n            container: 'container',\n            width: 578,\n            height: 300\n        });\n        var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\n        testImage = new Kinetic.Image({\n            x: 10,\n            y: 10,\n            image: imageObj,\n            draggable: true\n        });\n\n        layer.add(testImage);\n        stage.add(layer);\n    };\n\n    // After 5 seconds make the image blue and a little brighter\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        rgb(testImage, undefined, undefined, 255, 25.0);\n    }, 5000);\n\n    // After 10 seconds add some red to the image\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        rgb(testImage, 255, undefined, undefined, undefined);\n    }, 10000);\n\n    imageObj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></body>\n</html>\n```</p>\n<p>Notice how I finally remembered to use version 5.1.0 ;-)</p>\n<p>You can copy and paste all of that code into the editor on http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-invert-image-tutorial/ to see it working. </p>\n<p>Let me know if this works for you (or if I missed something).\n. So my <code>rgb</code> implementation did not work as you wanted? Maybe I misunderstood what you wanted to do. I don't see any obvious way to make it shorter but I belive you meant <code>blue</code> in the last conditional:</p>\n<p><code>else if (blue !== undefined) { // there was a `green` there\n    kineticImage.blue(blue);\n}</code></p>\n<p>You want to adjust the red, green, and blue channels individually, correct? Kinetic's RGB filter recolors the entire image so that each pixel retains its \"darkness or lightness\" but is the red, green, blue that you specify.</p>\n<p>I created a new filter for you. Add this to your code (somewhere at the beginning):</p>\n<p>```\n(function () {\n    Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust = function (imageData) {\n        var rAdj = this.red(),\n            gAdj = this.green(),\n            bAdj = this.blue(),\n            data = imageData.data,\n            len = data.length,\n            i,r,g,b;</p>\n<pre><code>    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += 4) {\n        r = data[i] + rAdj;\n        g = data[i+1] + gAdj;\n        b = data[i+2] + bAdj;\n        data[i] = (r&gt;255)?255:(r&lt;0)?0:r;\n        data[i+1] = (g&gt;255)?255:(g&lt;0)?0:g;\n        data[i+2] = (b&gt;255)?255:(b&lt;0)?0:b;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>})();\n```</p>\n<p>It uses <code>.red()</code>, <code>.green()</code>, and <code>.blue()</code> to adjust the color levels in your image. For example:</p>\n<p><code>kineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust]);\nkineticImage.red(20);    // add some red\nkineticImage.green(-30); // remove some green\nkineticImage.getLayer().draw();</code></p>\n<p>Note that this will adjust the image based on the original image. If you want it to \"add\" to what you've done (ie <code>red += 10</code>) then you can do something like:</p>\n<p><code>kineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust]);\nkineticImage.red( kineticImage.red() + 20 );   // add some more red\nkineticImage.blue( kineticImage.blue() - 10 ); // remove some more blue\nkineticImage.getLayer().draw();</code></p>\n<p>Another warning: the <code>.red()</code>, <code>.green()</code>, and <code>.blue()</code> that are being using are the same ones which are used in <code>Kinetic.Filters.RGB</code> so you should not use <code>Kinetic.Filters.RGB</code> and <code>Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust</code> on the same image.</p>\n<p>Here's a full example:</p>\n<p>```\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n<html>\n<head></head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"container\"></div>\n    <script src=\"http://d3lp1msu2r81bx.cloudfront.net/kjs/js/lib/kinetic-v5.1.0.min.js\">\n\n        (function () {\n            Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust = function (imageData) {\n                var rAdj = this.red(),\n                    gAdj = this.green(),\n                    bAdj = this.blue(),\n                    data = imageData.data,\n                    len = data.length,\n                    i,r,g,b;</p>\n<pre><code>            for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += 4) {\n                r = data[i] + rAdj;\n                g = data[i+1] + gAdj;\n                b = data[i+2] + bAdj;\n                data[i] = (r&gt;255)?255:(r&lt;0)?0:r;\n                data[i+1] = (g&gt;255)?255:(g&lt;0)?0:g;\n                data[i+2] = (b&gt;255)?255:(b&lt;0)?0:b;\n            }\n        };\n    })();\n\n    var imageObj = new Image();\n    imageObj.onload = function () {\n        var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n            container: 'container',\n            width: 578,\n            height: 300\n        });\n        var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\n        darth = new Kinetic.Image({\n            x: 10,\n            y: 10,\n            image: imageObj,\n            draggable: true\n        });\n\n        layer.add(darth);\n        stage.add(layer);\n\n        setInterval(function () {\n            darth.cache();\n            darth.filters([Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust]);\n            darth.red(darth.red() + 1);\n            darth.blue(darth.blue() + 2);\n            darth.getLayer().draw();\n        }, 50);\n    };\n    imageObj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></body>\n</html>\n```</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have more questions ^_^ \n.

There was a sight bug where negative values were being treating as 0. I changed the range so that 0 removes all the r,g,b and 255 increases it to the max.</p>\n<p>I would use the sliders to store the r,g,b values that you want to use. This way you don't have to worry about storing/adding/subtracting \"stock\" values, you can just read the value from the slider.</p>\n<p>Let me know how this works for you!\n. Luckily, I was curious about hue, saturation and luminance so there already is a filter for that in Kinetic:</p>\n<p><code>kineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.HSL]);\nkineticImage.hue(180);        // 180 degree hue shift\nkineticImage.saturation(1.0); // more color, less grey\nkineticImage.luminance(-0.5); // darker\nkineticImage.getLayer().draw();</code></p>\n<p><code>hue</code> is between 0 and 360. <code>saturation</code> can be any number: -1.0 halves the saturation of the image (makes it more grey) and +1.0 doubles the saturation (makes it more colorful). Similarly, <code>luminance</code> can be any number: -1.0 halves the luminance of the image (makes it more darker) and +1.0 doubles the luminance (makes it brighter).</p>\n<p>It should be easy for you to add that to your code but you may also find a complete example below ;-)</p>\n<p>```\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n<html></p>\n<p><head>\n    <style>\n        body { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; }\n        input { position: absolute; left: 20px; }\n        label { position: absolute; left: 200px; }\n        #slide-red, #label-red { top: 20px; }\n        #slide-green, #label-green { top: 40px; }\n        #slide-blue, #label-blue { top: 60px; }\n        #slide-hue, #label-hue { top: 80px; }\n        #slide-saturation, #label-saturation { top: 100px; }\n        #slide-luminance, #label-luminance { top: 120px; }\n    </style>\n</head></p>\n<p><body>\n    <div id=\"container\"></div></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- Sliders to adjust the red, green, blue, and brightness levels of an image --&gt;\n\n&lt;input id=\"slide-red\" type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"255\" step=\"1\" value=\"127\" /&gt;\n&lt;label id=\"label-red\" for=\"slide-red\"&gt;Red&lt;/label&gt;\n\n&lt;input id=\"slide-green\" type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"255\" step=\"1\" value=\"127\" /&gt;\n&lt;label id=\"label-green\" for=\"slide-green\"&gt;Green&lt;/label&gt;\n\n&lt;input id=\"slide-blue\" type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"255\" step=\"1\" value=\"127\" /&gt;\n&lt;label id=\"label-blue\" for=\"slide-blue\"&gt;Blue&lt;/label&gt;\n\n&lt;input id=\"slide-hue\" type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"360\" step=\"1\" value=\"0\"&gt;\n&lt;label id=\"label-hue\" for=\"slide-hue\"&gt;Hue&lt;/label&gt;\n\n&lt;input id=\"slide-saturation\" type=\"range\" min=\"-2\" max=\"2\" step=\"0.05\" value=\"0\"&gt;\n&lt;label id=\"label-saturation\" for=\"slide-saturation\"&gt;Saturation&lt;/label&gt;\n\n&lt;input id=\"slide-luminance\" type=\"range\" min=\"-2\" max=\"2\" step=\"0.05\" value=\"0\"&gt;\n&lt;label id=\"label-luminance\" for=\"slide-luminance\"&gt;Luminance&lt;/label&gt;\n\n&lt;script src=\"http://d3lp1msu2r81bx.cloudfront.net/kjs/js/lib/kinetic-v5.1.0.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script defer=\"defer\"&gt;\n    // Custom filter for adding or subtraction r,g,b colors\n    Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust = function (imageData) {\n        var rAdj = this.red() - 127,\n            gAdj = this.green() - 127,\n            bAdj = this.blue() - 127,\n            data = imageData.data,\n            len = data.length,\n            i, r, g, b;\n        for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += 4) {\n            r = data[i] + rAdj * 2;\n            g = data[i + 1] + gAdj * 2;\n            b = data[i + 2] + bAdj * 2;\n            data[i] = (r &gt; 255) ? 255 : (r &lt; 0) ? 0 : r;\n            data[i + 1] = (g &gt; 255) ? 255 : (g &lt; 0) ? 0 : g;\n            data[i + 2] = (b &gt; 255) ? 255 : (b &lt; 0) ? 0 : b;\n        }\n    };\n\n    var imageObj = new Image();\n    imageObj.onload = function () {\n\n        // Create the stage and layer to show the image\n        var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n            container: 'container',\n            width: 578,\n            height: 300\n        });\n        var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\n        darth = new Kinetic.Image({\n            x: 10,\n            y: 10,\n            image: imageObj,\n            draggable: true\n        });\n        layer.add(darth);\n        stage.add(layer);\n\n        // Read the inputs, apply them to the image, and redraw the layer\n        function redraw() {\n            darth.cache();\n            darth.filters([Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust, Kinetic.Filters.HSL]);\n            darth.red(document.getElementById('slide-red').value);\n            darth.green(document.getElementById('slide-green').value);\n            darth.blue(document.getElementById('slide-blue').value);\n            darth.hue(document.getElementById('slide-hue').value);\n            darth.saturation(document.getElementById('slide-saturation').value);\n            darth.luminance(document.getElementById('slide-luminance').value);\n            darth.getLayer().draw();\n        }\n\n        // Automatically redraw the image when the sliders change\n        document.getElementById('slide-red').onchange = redraw;\n        document.getElementById('slide-green').onchange = redraw;\n        document.getElementById('slide-blue').onchange = redraw;\n        document.getElementById('slide-hue').onchange = redraw;\n        document.getElementById('slide-saturation').onchange = redraw;\n        document.getElementById('slide-luminance').onchange = redraw;\n\n        // Draw the image with the default slider values\n        redraw();\n    };\n    imageObj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></body>\n</html>\n```</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!\n. Thanks! I merged the code from #527 which seemed like the same issue. It's in commit 8b7b3db9ef.\n. The filtered image was being drawn in a temporary canvas where it was\npreviously drawn. With each draw, the alpha-values of the image increased\nuntil they hit 255 (effectively removing the alpha channel).</p>\n<p>To fix it: I created a clear canvas each time the filter is applied. This fix\nshould be in the latest commit.\n. That was my first attempt - I used something like <code>context.clearRect(0,0,width,height)</code> but it didn't fix the problem. Perhaps I put that code in the wrong spot...\n. 1) Yes. That happens because the convolution matrix is looking for pixels that are past the edge of the image. I should either make it \"tile-able\" or just extend those edge pixels. I wasn't sure which would be more appropriate. Perhaps a 'filterIsTileable' flag to determine which the user wants?</p>\n<p>2) Ah, I didn't realize Brighten could do that. That sounds like a better option (and probably faster) than mine.</p>\n<p>3) Yes I could change that to ConvolutePack and similar for ColorPack. Would it be desirable to break them down further? or would that require a different file structure and too much repetitive code? About the verb naming convention: I was trying to name them verbs but didn't do a good job (shoulda got a thesaurus :-), I'd love to hear your suggestions.</p>\n<p>4) That's awesome! I'll work on restructuring those filters so that they are tweenable with 0 meaning no effect and 100 being the max. Is [0-100] the range you've been using (with negatives allowed when appropriate)?</p>\n<p>5) The my blur function should be the same as the existing Blur filter. My \"soft blur\" is slightly different than a \"regular\" blur. A soft blur first blurs the image then blends it with the unblurred image. I handle a soft blur as 1 operation, if we implemented it with the existing filter it would take blurring time + blending time which I'm guessing would be a bit slower than mine. I think mine is easier to maintain and would keep the files smaller but I don't know which performs better.</p>\n<p>I think KineticJS is an awesome project and I'm happy to help out! I'll try to work on these but probably won't get to it anything until Tuesday night so if you want to start some edits or send more suggestions that's cool.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi! Sorry, I didn't see any message about joining the KineticJS team but I'd like to talk with you about it. I put my personal email address in my profile so you can contact me using that address.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not sure what your goal is but here are some things I noticed.</p>\n<p>In http://jsfiddle.net/SLrTj/2/ in line 77 in the JavaScript you have <code>PageListS[0]</code>. I think you want <code>pageListS[0]</code> (lower case <code>p</code> at the beginning).</p>\n<p>Check out Mozilla's Array documentation for using two-dimensional arrays:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array</p>\n<p>The section on 2d arrays in near the end but basically, I think you want something like:</p>\n<p><code>// Create an array of 2 arrays\npageList = [[],[]];\n// Access the 3rd element of the 0th array\npageList[0][3] \n// As you had:\npageList[0][i] // similar to your pageList[0+i*2]\npageList[1][i] // similar to your pageList[1+i*2]</code>\n. Currently, <code>textHeight</code> is the height of an individual character and <code>lineHeight</code> is a ratio controlling how tall the line is compared to a character.</p>\n<p>For example a <code>textHeight</code> of <code>16</code> and a <code>lineHeight</code> of <code>2</code> gives a line which is <code>2*16=32</code> units tall and has characters which are <code>16</code> units tall (there will be some space between the lines). A <code>textHeight</code> of <code>12</code> and a <code>lineHeight</code> of <code>0.5</code> creates lines 6 units tall with the characters are 12 units tall (ie lines will overlap slightly).</p>\n<p>You can determine how many lines of text you have with <code>yourStringObj.split('\\n').length</code> or <code>kineticTextObj.textArr.length</code>. You can determine the total height of your block of text by multiplying by both the <code>lineHeight</code> and <code>textHeight</code>. The following should give you the height of your text block (similar to the width):</p>\n<p><code>text.getTextHeight()*text.getLineHeight()*text.textArr.length</code></p>\n<p><code>text</code> is your <code>Kinetic.Text</code> object.\n. Hi, I think you need to round your stage width like so:</p>\n<p><code>//Defining Stage\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n    container : 'container',\n    width : Math.floor(viewportWidth*.75) + 100,\n    height : viewportHeight + 26,\n    name : 'container',\n    id : 'stageWindow'\n});</code></p>\n<p>You are specifying a canvas to be a fractional number (1366*0.75 = 1024.5) of pixels wide. That fractional part is probably what's making your line blurry. (And make sure your browser's zoom is set to 100%, took me a while to realize 125% zoom makes everything blurry ;-)</p>\n<p>Close this if that fixes it for you.\n. Glad you could figure it out!\n. Thanks! It's been merged\n. Hi (nice report)! Instead of removing children, try destroying them:</p>\n<p><code>kLayer.destroyChildren();</code></p>\n<p>When I ran your code with <code>removeChildren()</code> - my memory usage kept increasing (I managed to push it over 1 gig) however, it was cleared once I closed the tab.</p>\n<p>I also ran your code with <code>destroyChildren()</code> and my memory usage also increased but it eventually levelled off (around a few 100 mB).</p>\n<p>I think we're trying to be conservative with our filter handling code but I'll double check to make sure we haven't overlooked anything.\n. To summarize this: use <code>kLayer.destroyChildren();</code> in your code.</p>\n<p>This is what you should expect: If you're clicking the button only occasionally - your memory usage should be effectively constant. However, if you're clicking the button really fast (more than once ever 20 seconds in my tests) the memory usage will rise until you don't click the button for a while. Then it should drop to a level just above where it was when your image didn't have a filter.</p>\n<p>Reopen or start a new issue if something else bugs you.\n. Thank you! These should be fixed now\n. Don't change the width or height of the DOM image. Use temporary variables to store the width and height of your image, for example:</p>\n<p><code>var w = img.width;\nvar h = img.height\nif(w &gt; scaleWidth) {\n    h = scaleWidth / (img.width / img.height);\n    w = scaleWidth;\n}\n_userPicImg = new Kinetic.Image({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0,\n    image: img,\n    name: \"image\",\n    width:w,\n    height:h\n});</code></p>\n<p>Check it out in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/n2veK/\n. Thanks for doing this!\n. There is no way to apply a filter to a shape; however, I am working on adding support for filters to be applied to layers. You could put all of the shapes you want to filter on one layer and then apply the filter to the layer in the layer's \"draw\" event. NOTE: this is only in the latest version on Github.</p>\n<p>You can look through some of the unit tests for examples of applying a filter to a layer: https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/tree/master/test/unit/filters </p>\n<p>Here's a quick example which pixelates the left half of a layer:</p>\n<p><code>layer.on('draw', function () {\n  var imageData = this.getContext().getImageData(0, 0, this.getCanvas().width/2, this.getCanvas().height);\n  var scratchData = this.getContext().createImageData(imageData); // only size copied\n  Kinetic.Filters.Pixelate(imageData,scratchData,{pixelWidth:8,pixelHeight:16});\n  this.getContext().putImageData(scratchData,0,0);\n});</code></p>\n<p>Let me know if you have suggestions, feedback or questions. I may not have updated the interface for the particular filter you want to use - let me know which one and I'll move it to the top of my priority list.\n. Could you create a jsfiddle for us? I think there may be a problem where you compute <code>index</code> or <code>midpointX</code>/<code>Y</code>.</p>\n<p>You seem to be adding points the correct way. You can verify that by going to the polygon example: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-polygon-tutorial/ and then adding this code to the end:</p>\n<p><code>var points = poly.points();\npoints.splice(6,0,420,36);\npoly.draw();</code>\n. You could call <code>.removeChildren()</code> on each layer, then redraw the stage:</p>\n<p><code>layer.removeChildren();\nlayer2.removeChildren();\nstage.draw();</code></p>\n<p>Or you could redraw each layer after removing them:</p>\n<p>stage.removeChildren();\n  layer.draw();\n  layer2.draw();</p>\n<p>On Thu, Mar 27, 2014 at 4:49 AM, JercSi notifications@github.com wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have an issue with new version - 5.0.2.\nstage.removeChildren() removes the layers (stage.getChildren().length ==\n0), but it still shows the object on the stage.</p>\n<p>Example: http://jsbin.com/tiyiyada/1/edit\nVersion 5.0.2 is still showing two Rectangle objects\nVersion 5.0.1 does not show anything</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues/866\n.\n.

Hope this helps!\n. First of all, you're trying to applying Kinetic getters/setters to a HTML image. This is wrong:</p>\n<p><code>var imagj = new Image();\nimagj.onload = function() {\n    var x = new Kinetic.Image(/* ... */);\n    // ...\n};\nimagj.cache();\nimagj.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\nimagj.blue(bleu);\nimagj.red(rouge);\nimagj.green(vert);</code></p>\n<p>This is correct:</p>\n<p>```\nvar imagj = new Image();\nimagj.onload = function() {\n    var x = new Kinetic.Image(/<em> ... </em>/);</p>\n<pre><code>// ...\n\nx.cache();\nx.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\nx.blue(bleu);\nx.red(rouge);\nx.green(vert);\n\n// ...\n\nlayerB.draw();\n</code></pre>\n<p>};\n```</p>\n<p>Secondly, you're using an image from the domain: http://kineticjs.com/ but you're running the code on the domain: http://jsfiddle.net This is a security problem. Your console will say \"Kinetic warning: Unable to apply filter. The operation is insecure.\" To fix that I would just make sure your image is coming from the same domain that your code is running on.</p>\n<p>The weird part is that even after I updated your fiddle it still is gives the security warning http://jsfiddle.net/5gF2c/4/ but that is fine because you can see it working elsewhere.</p>\n<p>To see the example working goto http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-invert-image-tutorial/ and put the following code in the script tag of the code editor:</p>\n<p>```\nvar imagj = new Image();\nimagj.onload = function() {\n    var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n      container: 'container',\n      width: 400,\n      height: 500\n    });</p>\n<pre><code>var layerB = new Kinetic.Layer();\n\nvar kineticImage = new Kinetic.Image({\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  image: imagj,\n  draggable: true\n});\n\nlayerB.add(kineticImage);\nstage.add(layerB);\n\nkineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\nkineticImage.red(0);\nkineticImage.green(255);\nkineticImage.blue(0);\n\nlayerB.draw();\n</code></pre>\n<p>};\nimagj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n```</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!\n. I'd make 2 tiny changes which will make your function reusable:</p>\n<p>1) You can get which layer to redraw from the image with <code>kineticImage.getLayer()</code>. This prevents you from having to change the layer (<code>layerB</code>) if you draw the image on a different layer.</p>\n<p>2) I would pass <code>kineticImage</code> as an argument so that you can use this function for any image. Right now you may only be using this for one image, but what if you wanted to apply it to several images? This will make it easier for you to do that.</p>\n<p>Here's how I would write the function:</p>\n<p><code>function rbg(kineticImage,red,blue,green){\n    kineticImage.cache();\n    kineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n    kineticImage.red(red);\n    kineticImage.green(green);\n    kineticImage.blue(blue);\n    kineticImage.getLayer().draw();\n}</code></p>\n<p>Then don't forget to pass the extra argument, for example: <code>rgb(kineticImage,0,255,0);</code>.</p>\n<p>You can also chain the methods for a more compact syntax:</p>\n<p><code>kineticImage.red(0).green(255).blue(0);</code></p>\n<p>You may not like the look of it but it is a nice trick to use when your code gets long ;-)\n. My guess is you are removing the RGB filter when you apply the brightness filter. Here is a working example:</p>\n<p>```\nvar imageObj = new Image();\nimageObj.onload = function() {</p>\n<pre><code>var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n  container: 'container',\n  width: 578,\n  height: 300\n});\n\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\ndarth = new Kinetic.Image({\n  x: 10,\n  y: 10,\n  image: imageObj,\n  draggable: true\n});\n\nlayer.add(darth);\nstage.add(layer);\n\ndarth.cache();\ndarth.red(128).green(0).blue(0);\n\n// Note: brightness values are between -1.0 (makes image black)\n// and +1.0 (makes image white); 0.0 does not change image\ndarth.brightness(-0.8);\n\n// Notice how an array is passed to filters\n// the array has both filters that we want to apply\ndarth.filters([Kinetic.Filters.Brighten,Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n\ndarth.getLayer().draw();\n</code></pre>\n<p>};\nimageObj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n```</p>\n<p>You can place that in script tag on http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-brighten-or-darken-image-tutorial/ to see it working.</p>\n<p>You need to pass BOTH filters to <code>.filters([...])</code>. Make sure you're using <code>kineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.RGB,Kinetic.Filters.Brighten]);</code></p>\n<p>Hope this helps! (if it doesn't, post some code or a fiddle)\n. I think I see what you want to do: in that function you're saving the red, green, blue, and brightness values then applying them if your function is not passed a new parameter. Try this:</p>\n<p>```\n// These global variables are no longer needed becuase\n// kineticImage remembers the value\n// var red, green, blue, alphix;\nfunction rgb(kineticImage, rouge, vert, bleu, alpha) {</p>\n<pre><code>// No worries, I left this part in for you ;-)\nif (kineticImage === undefined) {\n    kineticImage = testImage;\n}\n\nkineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.Brighten, Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n\n// Only update the properties that were passed as arguments\nif (alpha !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.brightness(alpha / 50.0);\n}\nif (rouge !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.red(rouge);\n}\nif (vert !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.green(vert);\n}\nif (bleu !== undefined) {\n    kineticImage.blue(bleu);\n}\n\nkineticImage.getLayer().draw();\n</code></pre>\n<p>}\n```</p>\n<p>Kinetic stores the values (red,green,blue,brightness,x,y, etc...) for you so you don't have to worry about storing or resetting them. All you have to do is change them when you need to.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of it working. For 5 seconds you should see a \"regular\" image, then it will change to a blue image with a little bit of brightness added, and then the filter will add some red in so it will look like a purple image:</p>\n<p>```\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n<html>\n  <head></head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"container\"></div>\n    <script src=\"http://d3lp1msu2r81bx.cloudfront.net/kjs/js/lib/kinetic-v5.1.0.min.js\">\n\n        // These global variables are no longer needed becuase\n        // kineticImage should remember the value\n        // var red, green, blue, alphix;\n        function rgb(kineticImage, rouge, vert, bleu, alpha) {</p>\n<pre><code>        // No worries, I left this part in for you ;-)\n        if (kineticImage === undefined) {\n            kineticImage = testImage;\n        }\n\n        kineticImage.cache();\n        kineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.Brighten, Kinetic.Filters.RGB]);\n\n        // Only update the properties that were passed as arguments\n        if (alpha !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.brightness(alpha / 50.0);\n        }\n        if (rouge !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.red(rouge);\n        }\n        if (vert !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.green(vert);\n        }\n        if (bleu !== undefined) {\n            kineticImage.blue(bleu);\n        }\n\n        kineticImage.getLayer().draw();\n    }\n\n    // Example of rgb function being used\n\n    var imageObj = new Image();\n    var testImage;\n\n    imageObj.onload = function () {\n        var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n            container: 'container',\n            width: 578,\n            height: 300\n        });\n        var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\n        testImage = new Kinetic.Image({\n            x: 10,\n            y: 10,\n            image: imageObj,\n            draggable: true\n        });\n\n        layer.add(testImage);\n        stage.add(layer);\n    };\n\n    // After 5 seconds make the image blue and a little brighter\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        rgb(testImage, undefined, undefined, 255, 25.0);\n    }, 5000);\n\n    // After 10 seconds add some red to the image\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        rgb(testImage, 255, undefined, undefined, undefined);\n    }, 10000);\n\n    imageObj.src = 'http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/assets/darth-vader.jpg';\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></body>\n</html>\n```</p>\n<p>Notice how I finally remembered to use version 5.1.0 ;-)</p>\n<p>You can copy and paste all of that code into the editor on http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-invert-image-tutorial/ to see it working. </p>\n<p>Let me know if this works for you (or if I missed something).\n. So my <code>rgb</code> implementation did not work as you wanted? Maybe I misunderstood what you wanted to do. I don't see any obvious way to make it shorter but I belive you meant <code>blue</code> in the last conditional:</p>\n<p><code>else if (blue !== undefined) { // there was a `green` there\n    kineticImage.blue(blue);\n}</code></p>\n<p>You want to adjust the red, green, and blue channels individually, correct? Kinetic's RGB filter recolors the entire image so that each pixel retains its \"darkness or lightness\" but is the red, green, blue that you specify.</p>\n<p>I created a new filter for you. Add this to your code (somewhere at the beginning):</p>\n<p>```\n(function () {\n    Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust = function (imageData) {\n        var rAdj = this.red(),\n            gAdj = this.green(),\n            bAdj = this.blue(),\n            data = imageData.data,\n            len = data.length,\n            i,r,g,b;</p>\n<pre><code>    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += 4) {\n        r = data[i] + rAdj;\n        g = data[i+1] + gAdj;\n        b = data[i+2] + bAdj;\n        data[i] = (r&gt;255)?255:(r&lt;0)?0:r;\n        data[i+1] = (g&gt;255)?255:(g&lt;0)?0:g;\n        data[i+2] = (b&gt;255)?255:(b&lt;0)?0:b;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>})();\n```</p>\n<p>It uses <code>.red()</code>, <code>.green()</code>, and <code>.blue()</code> to adjust the color levels in your image. For example:</p>\n<p><code>kineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust]);\nkineticImage.red(20);    // add some red\nkineticImage.green(-30); // remove some green\nkineticImage.getLayer().draw();</code></p>\n<p>Note that this will adjust the image based on the original image. If you want it to \"add\" to what you've done (ie <code>red += 10</code>) then you can do something like:</p>\n<p><code>kineticImage.cache();\nkineticImage.filters([Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust]);\nkineticImage.red( kineticImage.red() + 20 );   // add some more red\nkineticImage.blue( kineticImage.blue() - 10 ); // remove some more blue\nkineticImage.getLayer().draw();</code></p>\n<p>Another warning: the <code>.red()</code>, <code>.green()</code>, and <code>.blue()</code> that are being using are the same ones which are used in <code>Kinetic.Filters.RGB</code> so you should not use <code>Kinetic.Filters.RGB</code> and <code>Kinetic.Filters.rgbAdjust</code> on the same image.</p>\n<p>Here's a full example:</p>\n<p>```\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n<html>\n<head></head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"container\"></div>\n    <script src=\"http://d3lp1msu2r81bx.cloudfront.net/kjs/js/lib/kinetic-v5.1.0.min.js\">\n",

Thanks.\nMay you build a seperate version for IOS squash image issue?\n. lavrton,\nThank you for this thread. You know we use Kimage class of kineticjs framework, so we need to know how to use this 3rd js to solve it and where the good place in kineticjs code is?\n. lavrton,\nThank you for this thread. You know we use Kimage class of kineticjs framework, so we need to know how to use this 3rd js to solve it and where the good place in kineticjs code is?\n. Really good!\n. Hi,\nBelow is the related information.\nV4.7.3 + IOS 7\nThe canvas is not big, it's equal to the width and height of your screen, but i load a big image into layer into this stage. Image is 3295 * 2900. \nThanks.\n. This problem was resolved. When i create a instance of kinetic.image, and then call setImage method to load image, it didn't work for me, but i put image object in parameters in constructor of kinetic.image, it works well.\nThanks.\n. Hi everyone,\nWas this resolved? Now I am also in this hole. Does anyone have a proper solution to fix it?\n. Hi guys, what's the plan on fixing this issue? We need IOS. Thanks.\n. Hi guys, When will we meet the next release?\n. Do you have another way to resolve it now?\n. Hi ericdrowell,\nThank you for this information. \nThanks,\nSean\nDate: Tue, 7 Jan 2014 16:15:15 -0800\nFrom: notifications@github.com\nTo: KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nCC: xf_cheng@hotmail.com\nSubject: Re: [KineticJS] Fix Issue Where Large Images Get Vertically Squashed In iOS6 & iOS7 (#654)\nI'm still in the process of wrapping up the new documentation for all of the API changes in v5.0.0. It's the biggest release in KineticJS's history. Since this seems like a pretty burning issue, I'll still try to get this fix in before I release. I plan to build a beta release and start doing integration testing with Html5CanvasTutorials by the end of this week. If things go smoothly, v5.0.0 should be released during the weekend, maybe sooner.\n\u00a1\u00aa\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.                  \n. Hi Eric,\nLet's say it. Is this issue caused by IOS or KineticJS? Can we use viewport attribute to solve it? Any feedback?\nThanks,\nSean\nDate: Sun, 12 Jan 2014 02:45:25 -0800\nFrom: notifications@github.com\nTo: KineticJS@noreply.github.com\nCC: xf_cheng@hotmail.com\nSubject: Re: [KineticJS] Fix Issue Where Large Images Get Vertically Squashed In iOS6 & iOS7 (#654)\nHi ericdrowell, I see that there are not any solution for ios problem in v5.0.0 ?

I'll release v5.0.1 the following week (end of January) which will be a small patch that only contains high priority bug fixes.

Here is the question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22306947/kineticjs-image-stoke-is-not-available-when-using-hit-region\n. This lib solves the problem: https://github.com/stomita/ios-imagefile-megapixel\n. I use it with my gwt-kinetic lib: https://github.com/confile/gwt-kinetic in GWT.\nHere is the code: \n```\nvar files = inputFile.files;\nif (!files || !files.length) \n    return\nvar myFile = files[0];\nvar createFileReader = $entry(function() {\n    return new FileReader();\n});\nvar reader = createFileReader();\nvar createMegaPixImage = $entry(function(file) {\n    return new $wnd.MegaPixImage(file);\n});\nvar mpImg = createMegaPixImage(myFile);\nvar _URL = $wnd.URL || $wnd.webkitURL;\nimage.onload = function() {\n    callbackDone(\"done\");\n};      \nvar callbackDone = $entry(function(file) {\n    callback.@com.google.gwt.core.client.Callback::onSuccess(Ljava/lang/Object;)(file);\n});\nreader.onload = function(event) {\n    var file = reader.result\nvar orientationFunction = $entry(function(file) {\n    return @mobile.client.app.CanvasHelper::getOrientation(Ljava/lang/Object;)(file);\n});\n\nvar orient = parseInt(orientationFunction(file));\n\nmpImg.render(image, { maxWidth: 2000, maxHeight: 2000, quality: 1.0, orientation: orient });\n\n} \nreader.readAsBinaryString(myFile);\n```\nThe orientation you get from: https://github.com/jseidelin/exif-js\npublic static int getOrientation(Object file) {\n        ExifJso exif = ExifJso.create(file);\n        return exif.getOrientation();\n    }\nI works perfect for me. Be carefull to use MegaPixel only if the EXIF stores an orientation. This is only the case for iOS devices. Then you can get it in the right orientation.\nYou do not need to do it when EXIF does not provide orientation. This is true for Android devices.\nHope that helps you.\n. I got 30% less file size uncompressed with the advanced option. That is great.\n. +1 I have the same problem\n. Well there is still an issue, because the content is not resized with the resize of the stage.\n. @jfollas yes that is what I expected. Okay may be it is not a bug. I will close this issue.\n. I made a demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/confile/p6Eey/\nAs you can see in the exported image the edges are very crispy and not very sharp.\n. @lavrton Convert image to png with canvas is not working because auf security concerns.\n. @lavrton Why should canvg solve the security problem?\n. I works only with Canvg https://code.google.com/p/canvg/ on Safari and ios.\n. What do you mean by raster?\n. PNG does not change anything. Still slow.\n. is there a plan for release?\n. +1\n. I am also thinking that this project might not be supported anymore.\n. Are the any similar alternative projects? What would you recommend?\n. Which one is the best for mobile use?\n. Does any of them support layers like KineticJS?\n. Caching in the current version of KineticJS is a hugh problem. There are many issues that are open. We consider to change the project.\n. @lavrton PhaserJS has the most stars on github is this also good for image manipulation, rotation, layers, filters?\n. @lavrton Would you recommend PhaserJS or PixiJS for my case?\n. @lavrton Does PixiJS also has a layer system like KineticJS?\n. It is very said. I will move on to Pixi.js it seems to me to be the best alternative. Good bye KineticJS.\n-1\n. At least we should write a migration guide from KineticJS to PixiJS (http://www.pixijs.com/) Pixi uses WebGL Renderer with canvas fallback so it is much faster than Kinetic. What do you think of my idea?\n. As you can see here: http://jsperf.com/js-anim/28 Pixijs performs most of the time much better than any other lib especially KineticJs. \nI suggest we open a github project which documents how to migrate to PixiJs. \nI created a project for this purpose here: https://github.com/confile/Kinetic2Pixi\nAnyone how wants to join can contact me and I make you a collaborator on this project.\n. I think moving to PixiJs is much more promising because Pixi has a much greater support audience. Pixi also has WebGL support which makes you app super fast. \nSo feel free to join our project to migrate a KineticJS app to PixiJS https://github.com/confile/Kinetic2Pixi\n. Okay I suppose this is the new base repo https://github.com/lavrton/KineticJS\n@lavrton How active will you be in development and bugfixing?\n. @lavrton  So kineticJS is now KonvaJS right?\n. +1\n. +1\n.

So far we haven't had any issues on WebKit-based browsers with touch events becoming drag-and-drop events.\n. ",

This isn't the nicest way to do it, as it doesn't leverage the existing code in drawFunc.\nI'd like to rely on existing code as much as possible, and making this a basic KineticJS transformation sounds like the right way to achieve that.\nThere's an issue though: this isn't actually one affine transformation, it's four different ones, one for each triangular section of the image.

This will need to be implemented differently, as it can't be applied to the same matrix.\nThe way it's done right now is at draw time. I save the context's currently active transformation with context.save(), then I do my thing, and then I restore everything with context.restore(). I do that four times, for the four triangular sections, each with its own transformation.\nTo integrate this with Kinetic.Node, I could add a new field to go along with the others (scale, rotation, etc.), calling it distortion or something, where I can store distortion coordinates like the ones you suggested above, and add a method to the Kinetic.Transform prototype, which calculates the four transformations based on these coordinates. Then, at draw time, I can apply these transformations before calling the shape's draw function, and undo them after the drawing.\nWhat do you think?\nIs there a logical place to do this stuff right before drawing a shape?

    "MarkusLeth": "I have been testing your framework pretty thoroughly and in my first attempt I ended up with events firing all over the place and a lot of attributes changing back and forth as the state changed in the application.\nIn my second attempt I decided to go for a more functional programming approach where shapes loaded attributes from other shapes, for example this shape x = other shape x + 5.\nI started to extend your types and overload the attributes that had dependencies to other objects. This gave me really clean code without complex event handlers.\nMy point being that I could do all this without changing the Kineticjs-source (which is great). The first time I run into problems was when I wanted to add a line between two shapes (points calculated from the coordinates from the other shapes). Then, the point array was hidden from me inside Kineticjs.\nSo from my point of view, passing functions to all attributes is not as important as getting better access to the point array. The fact that this was the first time I had to make changes to your source proves that :)\nI totally agree that performance is a big issue. I have been thinking about checking the attributes in the constructor. Then you know once and for all if the attribute is a function.\nAgain, Kineticjs is absolutely brilliant.\n. I have been testing your framework pretty thoroughly and in my first attempt I ended up with events firing all over the place and a lot of attributes changing back and forth as the state changed in the application.\nIn my second attempt I decided to go for a more functional programming approach where shapes loaded attributes from other shapes, for example this shape x = other shape x + 5.\nI started to extend your types and overload the attributes that had dependencies to other objects. This gave me really clean code without complex event handlers.\nMy point being that I could do all this without changing the Kineticjs-source (which is great). The first time I run into problems was when I wanted to add a line between two shapes (points calculated from the coordinates from the other shapes).

The problem is still there. Actually, 5.1.0 is worse, not just the cashed image, the quality of non-cached shape is bad too.\n. Set the pixelRatio to 1 for desktops is really bad.

Once I extracted the code out, it worked fine. I'm trying to reproduce it on a simplified code, but have no luck yet. \n. I believe the problem could be in layer.getIntersection. I encountered another issue where mouseout event was fired incorrectly. In that case, I have a small rectangle (8x8), it listened to mouseout event, but the event sometimes fired when the mouse was still inside the rectangle. In both case, the layer.getIntersection wasn't return the shape.\n\nI am also suspect that the point position was not correct because in mouseout event, I logged the pointer position, the y value was slightly off when the mouse was still in the rectangle.\n.

Ok, I was messing around with the kinetic.js file, and I've noticed 2 things that might help you with solving this issue:\n1) The .min file is not the same as the source file\n2) I've fixed the problem by deleting the line if(!b.antialiased)return null from the .min file (version 5.1.0)\nNow I have no idea what this line does, or if it will have long-term consequences, but for now, and for me, it solves the issue, and I hope it might help you solve the issue on the bigger scale.\n. Sorry, didn't mention it, but this is that latest kinetic.js. It fixed the issue with antialiasing as you can see here http://jsfiddle.net/LwRnj/54/ but this bug (if it's a bug) is still present. Both this and the jsfiddle in the opening post use the same version of kinetic.js Basically, it works fine with shapes inside groups, but doesn't work with groups inside groups.\n. My bad, the links are http://jsfiddle.net/LwRnj/54/ for the example with shapes inside groups (works fine) and http://jsfiddle.net/fy6LQ/3/ for the example with groups inside groups (doesn't work). Both examples have the same, latest version of kinetic.js from repo.\n. ",

The image of the red anesthesia cart loads, and the blue circle target is drawn. At that point,no amount of touching, tapping or whatever seems to affect anything on the screen. Normally, I would expect to be able to click any drawer handle on the cart and have that action trigger an animation where the corresponding drawer layer would smoothly move down from out-of-frame onto the middle of the stage, so you could see the objects in it. Clicking the drawer handle should also make the drawer handle highlight to show that it is active. Neither of those 2 things happen.\nYesterday, after reading a lot of possibly related messages, I removed all but one of the drawer layers from the game, and set its initial position to inside the stage boundaries. I also changed to kinetic.js v. 1.7.1 and adjusted the code so that pixelratio would always be \"1\". it worked exactly once, sort of: the animations were very very slow, as was the drag motion when I would drag one of the findable objects.

I am fixing this issue like so:\n``` javascript\nvar image = new Kinetic.Image({\n  image: imageObj\n});\nvar vertSquashRatio = detectVerticalSquash(imageObj);\nif (vertSquashRatio != 1) {\n  var h = image.height();\n  image.height = image.height;\n  image.height = function() {\n    return arguments.length ? image.height(arguments[0] / vertSquashRatio) : image.___height() * vertSquashRatio\n  }\n  image.height(h);\n}\n```\nbut vertSquashRatio seems to be incorrect, and the image is scaled incorrectly.\n@lavrton can you check my code?\n. I tried your fix but it does not work on my iPhone https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/654#issuecomment-43608359\nValue of vertSquashRatio for some images is 0.5 and this is correct, but for others it is 0.375.\n. Yes 0.375 is not correct. Images are taken by iPhone, they don't have transparent area.\nIt is another problem, I have images that was taken in landscape and portrait mode but all of them are drawn on canvas in landscape mode (why?). And here appears the problem: for images that was taken in portrait mode vertSquashRatio is 0.375.\n. ",

Below is the code and a pich to zoom example ... hope this helps:\n```\n// registerGestures simplifies handling touch gestures for kineticjs stages (or any element)\n// adds support for touchholdstart, touchholdmove, touchholdend\n// adds offset0, offset1, distance & center to the event object where relevant\n//     elem - use kineticStage.getContent()\n//     callbacks - dictionary of callback functions, keys can be touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchpinchstart, touchpinchmove, touchpinchend, touchholdstart, touchholdmove, touchholdend\n//     recieverArg - optional reciever for the callbacks \nfunction registerGestures(elem, callbacks, recieverArg) {\n    var reciever = recieverArg || window,\n        touchduration = 1000;\n$.data(elem, 'gestureData', {\n    longTouchTimer: null,\n    touchPinchOn: false,\n    touchHoldOn: false,\n    touchstartpos: null,\n    lastTouchMoveTouches: null\n});\n\nfunction calcTouchEventData(touches) {\n    var res = {};\n    if (touches[0]) res.offset0 = makePos(touches[0].pageX - $(touches[0].target).offset().left, touches[0].pageY - $(touches[0].target).offset().top);\n    if (touches[1]) res.offset1 = makePos(touches[1].pageX - $(touches[1].target).offset().left, touches[1].pageY - $(touches[1].target).offset().top);\n    if (touches[0] && touches[1]) {\n        res.distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow((res.offset1.x - res.offset0.x), 2) + Math.pow((res.offset1.y - res.offset0.y), 2));\n        res.center = makePos(Math.abs((res.offset0.x + res.offset1.x) / 2), Math.abs((res.offset0.y + res.offset1.y) / 2));\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nfunction clearTimer() {\n    var timer = $.data(elem, 'gestureData').longTouchTimer;\n    if (timer) clearTimeout(timer);\n    timer = null;\n}\n\nelem.addEventListener('touchstart', function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    $.extend(e, calcTouchEventData(e.touches));\n    clearTimer();\n    var data = $.data(elem, 'gestureData');\n    data.touchstartpos = e.offset0;\n\n    if (e.touches[0] && e.touches[1]) {\n        data.touchPinchOn = true;\n        data.touchHoldOn = false;\n        if (callbacks.touchpinchstart) callbacks.touchpinchstart.call(reciever, e);\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (callbacks.touchholdstart || callbacks.touchholdmove || callbacks.touchholdend) {\n            data.longTouchTimer = setTimeout(function() {\n                clearTimer();\n                data.touchPinchOn = false;\n                data.touchHoldOn = true;\n                if (callbacks.touchholdstart) callbacks.touchholdstart.call(reciever, e);\n            }, touchduration);\n        }\n\n        if (callbacks.touchstart) callbacks.touchstart.call(reciever, e);\n    }\n});\n\nelem.addEventListener('touchmove', function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault(); // prevent iPAD panning\n    $.extend(e, calcTouchEventData(e.touches));\n    var data = $.data(elem, 'gestureData');\n    // if we got a move in the same location of start before the timeout run out ignore it (as we may still get a hold)\n    if (data.longTouchTimer && data.touchstartpos.x === e.offset0.x && data.touchstartpos.y === e.offset0.y) return;\n    clearTimer();\n\n    if (e.touches[0] && e.touches[1]) {\n        if (callbacks.touchpinchmove) callbacks.touchpinchmove.call(reciever, e);\n    } else if (data.touchHoldOn) {\n        if (callbacks.touchholdmove) callbacks.touchholdmove.call(reciever, e);\n    } else {\n        if (callbacks.touchmove) callbacks.touchmove.call(reciever, e);\n    }\n\n    data.lastTouchMoveTouches = e.touches;\n});\n\nelem.addEventListener('touchend', function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    clearTimer();\n    var data = $.data(elem, 'gestureData');\n    // for some reason touchend has an empty touches array so using lastTouchMoveTouches\n    $.extend(e, calcTouchEventData(data.lastTouchMoveTouches));\n\n    if (data.touchPinchOn) {\n        if (callbacks.touchpinchend) callbacks.touchpinchend.call(reciever, e);\n    } else if (data.touchHoldOn) {\n        if (callbacks.touchholdend) callbacks.touchholdend.call(reciever, e);\n    } else {\n        if (callbacks.touchend) callbacks.touchend.call(reciever, e);\n    }\n    data.touchHoldOn = false;\n    data.touchPinchOn = false;\n});\n\n}\n```\nHere is sample usage to show using pinch to zoom around center:\n```\nvar pinchLastDist, pinchStartCenter;\nregisterGestures(kineticStage.getContent(), {\n    touchpinchmove: function(e) {\n        if (!pinchLastDist) pinchLastDist = e.distance;\n        if (!pinchStartCenter) pinchStartCenter = e.center;\n        var newscale = kineticLayer.getScale().x * e.distance / pinchLastDist;\n        pinchLastDist = e.distance;\n        zoom(newscale, pinchStartCenter);\n    },\n    touchpinchend: function(e) {\n        pinchLastDist = pinchStartCenter = 0;\n    },\n    touchholdstart: function(e) {\n        console.log('touchholdstart');\n    },\n    touchholdmove: function(e) {\n        console.log('touchholdmove');\n    },\n});\nfunction zoom(scaleTo, center) { // zoom around center\n    var mx = center.x - kineticLayer.getX(),\n        my = center.y - kineticLayer.getY();\nvar zoomOrigin = kineticLayer.getOffset(),\n                oldscale = kineticLayer.getScaleX();\n            zoomOrigin = makePos(mx / oldscale + zoomOrigin.x - mx / newscale, my / oldscale + zoomOrigin.y - my / newscale);\nkineticLayer.offset(makePos(zoomOrigin.x, zoomOrigin.y));\n\nkineticLayer.scale({\n    x: scaleTo,\n    y: scaleTo\n});\nkineticStage.draw();\n\n}\n```\n. After tracing through the code I managed to get this to work by adding the two lines:\n        Kinetic.Util.extend(Kinetic.Shape, Kinetic.Node);\n    Kinetic.Util.extend(Kinetic.Image, Kinetic.Shape);\nAfter the line \n       Kinetic.Factory.addGetterSetter(Kinetic.Node, 'myFilterVal', 0, null, Kinetic.Factory.afterSetFilter);\nHowever I don't know if this is the right/safe solution ?\n. thanks Eric that works. Would be good to get a more full solution/documented solution to adding filters.\nI also realized I have to call image.cache(); before changing my parameter or the filter is not called, which is not intuitive.\nThank you\n. Also, it seems the structure of the line points array that getPoints returns has changed in v5 ??\nwhat used to be [ { x: x1, y: y1 }, { x: x2, y: y2 }] is now [x1, y1, x2, y2] ??\nI can't find this in the changelog and it breaks a big part of my code :(\n. Thanks Moeriki\n. Thx Lavrton ! yes I am aware of solutions by catching keydown on the document level and passing it down to the stage but they are hackish  and do not scale well once you have a big project with lots of events/stages ... I am looking to contain the keydown event handler in the stage code as I tried above.\n. Great thx! so canvas.focus(); is essential for this to work. However in my situation I have more than one stages/layers, does that mean I have to focus the canvas on mouse over etc ?\n. ok. I just realized your solution doesn't work on firefox :( does focus works differently there ? I don't see the blue frame \n. Ok great, thx a lot, I also posted the answer to http://stackoverflow.com/a/23003139/460084\n. ",

So the first time I add a string I also add a layer, then I just check if the layer exists and draw the stage. For the record, I avoid text duplication like this:\nflyerSheets.add( myText );\nif( flyerStage.getLayers().length < 1 ) {\n     flyerStage.add( flyerSheets );\n}\nflyerStage.draw();\nThanks @lavrton for your prompt answer.\nCheers!\n. Hello @lavrton, I've made two fiddles but I was unable to reproduce the same behavior as explained here. The only difference with my app is I'm exporting images through AJAX, and forcing them to be downloaded using PHP.\nIn my app I export using toDataURL and toImage, the issue explained before just happens on the image resulting from the toDataURL + AJAX + PHP download.\njsFiddle Export in v5.0.1\njsFiddle Export in v5.1.1\nI'll close this topic because I was unable to reproduce it, I'll keep investigating my own app to see if I can figure this out.\nCheers,\nJos\u00e9 SAYAGO.\n. Hello @lavrton, thank you for your prompt response. I have checked your example, and noticed the reason my code wasn't working.\nSee this example where I assigned a numeric value instead of a string to the name: http://jsbin.com/girefelunewa/1/edit?html,js,console,output\nThis breaks the code. I was assigning numbers instead of strings, I solved this issue by appending .toString() at the end of the variable.\nHowever, this indeed changed since the last update and would be great if you could inform about this somewhere.

I'm not sure if mozCurrentTransform is reliable, but I couldn't find another way to access this information.\n. Hi @kaplag, that fix also seemed to work for me. It was the end result of my earlier pull request:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/885/files\nHowever, that pull request caused some failed test cases, so I closed it.\n. @kaplag, this was my first look into the internals of the KineticJS project, so I can't say for sure what side-effects that fix might have.  \nMy guess is that this change causes the \"hit canvas\" to render at a pixelRatio of 1, and (somehow) the \"hit canvas\" scales up to match the size of the \"draw canvas\" (which has a pixelRatio of 2). The result would be that, while the two canvases have the same dimensions, the drawing resolution of the \"hit canvas\" is not as good. (Again, my guess is...) This may cause issues for the hit-states of thin lines or shapes with lots of fine-grained detail.\n. The following change to Kinetic.HitCanvas (independent of the change in the pull request) also seemed to fix the issue for me:\nKinetic.HitCanvas = function(config) {\n    config = config || {};\n    config.pixelRatio = 1; //force a pixelRatio of 1 for the hit canvas\n    [...]\n. I just ran across a side-effect issue caused by this change (removing the reset() call). Please don't accept this pull request in its current state.\nThis code shows the issue -- the boxGetsRotatedAgain shape is incorrectly rotated twice.\n``` js\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n    container: 'container',\n    width: 400,\n    height: 400\n});\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\nstage.add(layer);\nvar group = new Kinetic.Group({\n    rotation: 10,\n    x: 30\n});\nlayer.add(group);\nvar box = new Kinetic.Rect({\n    x: 50,\n    y: 50,\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n    fill: '#0f0'\n});\ngroup.add(box);\nvar clippedGroup = new Kinetic.Group({\n    clip: {\n        x: 20,\n        y: 20,\n        width: 360,\n        height: 360\n    }\n});\ngroup.add(clippedGroup);\nvar boxGetsRotatedAgain = new Kinetic.Rect({\n    x: 200,\n    y: 50,\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n    fill: '#00f'\n});\nclippedGroup.add(boxGetsRotatedAgain);\nstage.draw();\n```\n.

I'm not sure if mozCurrentTransform is reliable, but I couldn't find another way to access this information.\n. Hi @kaplag, that fix also seemed to work for me. It was the end result of my earlier pull request:\nhttps://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/pull/885/files\nHowever, that pull request caused some failed test cases, so I closed it.\n. @kaplag, this was my first look into the internals of the KineticJS project, so I can't say for sure what side-effects that fix might have.  \nMy guess is that this change causes the \"hit canvas\" to render at a pixelRatio of 1, and (somehow) the \"hit canvas\" scales up to match the size of the \"draw canvas\" (which has a pixelRatio of 2). The result would be that, while the two canvases have the same dimensions, the drawing resolution of the \"hit canvas\" is not as good. (Again, my guess is...) This may cause issues for the hit-states of thin lines or shapes with lots of fine-grained detail.\n. The following change to Kinetic.HitCanvas (independent of the change in the pull request) also seemed to fix the issue for me:\nKinetic.HitCanvas = function(config) {\n    config = config || {};\n    config.pixelRatio = 1; //force a pixelRatio of 1 for the hit canvas\n    [...]\n. I just ran across a side-effect issue caused by this change (removing the reset() call). Please don't accept this pull request in its current state.\nThis code shows the issue -- the boxGetsRotatedAgain shape is incorrectly rotated twice.\n``` js\nvar stage = new Kinetic.Stage({\n    container: 'container',\n    width: 400,\n    height: 400\n});\nvar layer = new Kinetic.Layer();\nstage.add(layer);\nvar group = new Kinetic.Group({\n    rotation: 10,\n    x: 30\n});\nlayer.add(group);\nvar box = new Kinetic.Rect({\n    x: 50,\n    y: 50,\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n    fill: '#0f0'\n});\ngroup.add(box);\nvar clippedGroup = new Kinetic.Group({\n    clip: {\n        x: 20,\n        y: 20,\n        width: 360,\n        height: 360\n    }\n});\ngroup.add(clippedGroup);\nvar boxGetsRotatedAgain = new Kinetic.Rect({\n    x: 200,\n    y: 50,\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n    fill: '#00f'\n});\nclippedGroup.add(boxGetsRotatedAgain);\nstage.draw();\n```\n. These latest changes make the build fail in Travis. I'm going to close this pull request.\n.
