    "sampotts": "Hey there @Haroenv, Sorry to hear that. \nPlyr is really just a wrapper for the HTML5 native player so it could be an issue with the demo movie file, Safari playing up, your computer load, or your connection possibly. Are other videos having issues such as Vimeo? https://vimeo.com/108792063 (They also use a native  element). I get it sometimes if my CPU is getting smashed. \nAnyhow, I've pushed v1.0.9 which now displays the buffering progress, along with some other minor improvements. Maybe take a look and see if the movie hasn't loaded completely or something? \n\nThe darker progress is the amount of media that's buffered. You'll probably find on most machines it shoots up to 100% pretty quick. Give it a go: http://plyr.io\n. I'll do some more digging. Thanks for the vid. This might be an issue with the native  element that there's a work around for. I'll work something out and get back to you. \n. Closing this one as I can't reproduce. If someone else is experiencing it, I'll take another look. Suspect it is network/machine related? \n. Ah, I used their default license. Will update. Cheers.\n. Great idea. I'll look at this as soon as I can. \n. Hey Joe, I'd probably look at the two as one ticket item. \nHey Tom, very good points. My original thoughts were to use the preload attribute on the element to prefetch some of the next media. That way it would play instantly. That would mean two video/audio elements on the page though. It needs some more thought... \n. That would be good to see @servermeta !\n. Sorry @servermeta , I missed your message about a PM. Twitter is fine or me@sampotts.me \nI'll be looking at playlists next since I've added .source() and .poster() API methods now. \n. Thanks @nickdesaulniers , I'll take a look :+1: \n. Hey, \nNot a lot to be honest. I'm currently finishing up what's left to get v3 out the door (working on it now). After that I'm keen to convert to ES6 with modules so that people can build their own version which what they need - e.g. no Vimeo, YouTube or no controls if they use their own. I have someone who's offered help there. I don't think this would be too hard to do - the work to change sources is there int he API already but passing the playlist to setup would be tricky with the current setup. It's not something I've looked at yet in detail. . v3 is currently in the develop branch but it still has bugs (hence not being in master) and is currently undocumented. I can add a boolean for that sure. . For sure. It's not my native CSS preprocessor but I will take a look. It's something I want to learn.\n. Hey Bruno, I'll take a look at your pull request in a little bit. I'm sure it'll be fine. My only worry is supporting both LESS and SASS. \nHey Tom, nope. I've got a gulpfile that I use to render it for local testing along with the generation of the SVG sprite etc. It doesn't do anything too fancy. I'll add the SASS build into it too. \n. Hey Bruno, just pushed 1.0.17 with your SASS file in (with slight amend for #6 ). I've not included the SASS files for docs since they will just add extra maintenance there and be less useful for users. I've also separated the core Plyr files from docs to clean things up. I think it makes sense?\nThanks for your help!\n. Good idea. I've updated bower.json to include the source files. Let me know if there's any problems. \nCheers!\n. No problem at all. Let me know if you find anything else or ideas you have :+1:\n. Thanks for this. I'll look into it. \n. Let me know if you run into any more issues :+1: \nCheers!\n. I'll take a look at this tomorrow. I'll need to add a gulp build for the SASS to test it. \nCheers for contributing! \n. We definitely could. It would probably have to be some sort of module/add I'd say as not everyone would want it but it would definitely be a plus. The YouTube player would have to be rendered as an iframe and the YouTube API used to control it. It can be done. I'll look into it. The same would apply for Vimeo I'd imagine. For obvious reasons they don't expose the raw files although services exist to fetch the mp4 from YouTube pages. Hardly ideal though and probably against YouTubes usage policies. \n. I'd also prefer that option but unfortunately getting access to the raw mp4 files from YouTube and Vimeo isn't possible (Vimeo do I think depending on what settings the author sets). In that case if it's to be done, it might have to use iframes and PostMessage/APIs to control playback. I'd probably build this as an add-on or module as mentioned previously. \n. Sorry, I will get around to this, I just need to lock myself away for a day :+1: \n. Sorry, I have started on YouTube playback. Will update once I have more. Will find some more time this week. \n. Sorry, I'm still working on it around other commitments. Will try to devote some more time to it. I really want to get it in and I've already made a good start on it. \n. Sorry I'm currently on vacation at the moment. It's hard to find the time so if anyone wants to contribute, feel free to pull develop and do a pull request if you're desperate. \nI am working on it just life takes precedence over work and life's been busy. \n. Will do when I get home. Currently in Dallas, about to board my 17 hour (!) flight home to Sydney.\n. A bit of an update on this. I finally managed to find some time today and I have made some more progress with YouTube playback. All going well, I should have something to release this week. It'd be great if you guys could give it a spin once done and let me know any changes/improvements. \nI'll keep you guys posted and sorry about the slowness on this. Next up Vimeo. \n. Just pushed the YouTube support in v1.2.0. Please give it a test and if you find anything quirky, let me know. I'll make a start on Vimeo on this week. Sorry it's taken so long!\nHey @nahtnam, I'll take a look but Vimeo's API is decent (better than YouTube's) and not sure Twitch has support for HTML5? It wants me to install Flash. That's a no-go :-1: \n. @calvintam236 Yep, this is in the docs. Have a read :+1: https://github.com/Selz/plyr#embeds\n\nThe .source() API method can also be used but the video id must be passed as the argument.\n\n@martindale I'll work on this too, shouldn't be too hard (he says...)\n. Yep, e.g. go to plyr.io and chuck this in the console: \ndocument.querySelector(\"#youtube .player\").plyr.source(\"-jp3o7R5Q1I\")\nI'll add to the docs now in the API table\n. Weird, I'm not seeing that error with fullscreen in Chrome? The source change works for me although I've just seen that it doesn't reset the seek position properly in Chrome (annoying) so I'll look at that. \nCurrently switching between HTML5 and YouTube isn't supported but I am working on that and will get that sorted before moving on to Vimeo. \n. The YouTube API (and YouTube in general) is a bit flaky. I occasionally see errors in the console but none actually effect playback which lets be honest, is the most important thing. \nThere is no API method (that I could see) to toggle captions on or off. Currently it will use whatever your account (if logged into YouTube) setting is. \nGood news about Twitch. They must be rolling it out in phases or they do as Facebook does and user agent sniff, for whatever reason. I still get this: \n\nI'll add it to the list but after Vimeo. \n. @calvintam236 Yes. I use Opera though, which also doesn't work for HTML5 on Facebook because they UA sniff, no other reason. Another reason UA sniffing is not ideal. If you change UA to Safari, videos play fine. Still, I'll do twitch after Vimeo like I say. \nWell that error will be caused by their API I guess then, since the API is used to create the iframe. I'll look into it though. Odd that I'm not seeing any of these issues. \nOh that option would only work at initialisation so the captions couldn't be toggled. \n@nahtnam Cheers, I'll look into it :+1: \n. Cheers guys, that's awesome :+1: :+1: \nI'll work on Vimeo and Twitch asap. \n. I'll create another issue for that. Not really too sure what to do there apart from disable full screen on non HTTPS for Chrome then. \n. Just upgraded to Opera 31 and seeing it myself. OK I'll start an issue since it's not related to this one. \n. I have Vimeo in a working state now but the issue is that Vimeo's embed has limited options in terms of controls. The emphasis is left more to the video owner. I have, however found a way to hide the controls (while still being responsive of course) by making the iframe taller than 16:9 (the video is centered) so the controls are hidden in the overflow. This has me worried though that it will be a breach of the Vimeo AUP. I need to look into it further before I release it and get people in hot water with Vimeo. If only they added an option like YouTube have :-1: \n. Yep. I'll work on that this weekend then. Makes sense. I'll release it with Vimeo as well (which is pretty much done). \n. I've basically rewritten how the .source api function works, it will now only accept an object but has much greater flexibility which makes sense for the next big feature, playlists. You can change type, specify title (for the aria label on the play button), specify multiple or single sources and tracks (although only one track is supported until I sort out multiple tracks). \njavascript\nplayer.source({\n    type:       'video',\n    title:      'Bug Buck Bunny',\n    sources: [{ \n        src:    'https://cdn.selz.com/plyr/1.0/movie.mp4',\n        type:   'video/mp4'\n    },\n    {\n        src:    'https://cdn.selz.com/plyr/1.0/movie.webm',\n        type:   'video/webm'\n    }],\n    poster:     'https://cdn.selz.com/plyr/1.0/poster.jpg',\n    tracks:     [{\n        kind:   'captions',\n        label:  'English',\n        srclang:'en',\n        src:    'https://cdn.selz.com/plyr/1.0/example_captions_en.vtt',\n        default: true\n    }]\n});\nThis is currently in the develop branch. I'm just finishing up some more testing and working with a couple of Vimeo quirks and then it's good to go. Should be within the next couple of days. I'll report back. \nThen the plan is to tackle loop and playback speed controls before I crack on with playlists. \n. Cool. Let me know if you find any bugs, I'm still finishing it up. \n. Yes I will once it goes to the master branch. As I said, it's in the develop branch at present so if I update the release docs, it'd be a bit pointless. It's in develop because, well, it's in development still. Not final. \nYes, you can just specify src for tracks. I've made it so whatever you supply in that object is used for the html element's attributes. You can obviously add your own attributes, or just use src. I'll make it replicate the behaviour for the sources property so rather than an array, you can specify a single url. \nDocumentation takes time and as I've not finished it yet, things are still changing. \n. Damn. I'll take a look. What's your html look like? \n. That looks fine. I'll have a play tonight and get back to you. Sorry about that. \n. Sorry I just looked through this again but basically the shape of your object is a little off. You need to pass the type of the player to the method as well. \n``` javascript\nvar sources = [\n    {\n        type: 'audio',\n        sources: [{\n            src: 'http://inumedia.io/whalestep.mp3',\n            type: 'audio/mp3'\n        }],\n        autoplay: true\n    },\n    {\n        type:   'youtube',\n        sources: 'SZO5QYP-GeQ',\n        autoplay: true\n    }\n];\nsetInterval(function() {\n    player.source(sources[Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)]);\n}, 5000);\n```\nAlso calling play() straight away on a YouTube video after source change will throw an error because there's a high chance it's not had time to load. I can add a callback if you think it's beneficial, otherwise you can pass an autoplay option as above.\nStill working on the Vimeo issue. It works but their API throws an error for some reason:\njavascript\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ready' of undefined\nHad a busy week but hopefully I can find some more time this week. \n. Hey @martindale , that's fair enough. I can make the YouTube type sources property an array also and do something with error handling. I need to look at this as a whole for HTML5 too. \nIt does in a way. Once YouTube's API fires a ready event, then event listeners etc are setup. These differ slightly between audio, video, YouTube and Vimeo but to you, they're the same (or should be). \n. Heh, thanks for this. I'll try and find some time today to crack on. If not, tomorrow. \n. Pushed changes to the develop branch. Could you take a look and let me know.\n- Fullscreen audio option \n- Fullscreen bug fix when changing source\n- Docs for .source method\n- .source api method is universal so the same shape object can be passed for all types although only the first item in the array will be used for YouTube and Vimeo at this point until I work on error handling as a whole. \nI think it might be ready to go to master (with a big warning around Vimeo, I'm not sure what's going on with that) \n. - I presume you want to just autoplay the video you added with the API? You can just add an autoplay property to the source as above. It's because the YouTube API needs to load first. \n- It would make the code a bit more complex since I'd have to parse the each of the sources before I could determine the actual type of the player to set up the correct markup, etc. I could but it doesn't feel as clean to me but if you feel really strongly, I could look at it. \nYou're right about the Vimeo API. I still have the error I mentioned above, seemingly for no apparent reason. It's really hard to work out what's going on. That said, the YouTube API isn't great either. With YouTube, you have to poll for everything whereas at least Vimeo uses PostMessage so it's more push than pull. \n. Yes, sorry, it's just the way the YouTube API works. Not so great. Both Vimeo and YouTube API's have their flaws. A combination of them both would be good. I could however look at queuing the call to play() but that would probably set the expectation that all the other API methods would allow this (meaning massive headache) so perhaps a callback would be better. \nYes, it's more the type of the container. Which makes sense to me. There's arguments either way but I'll take a look. If we're to do that then the mime type within the sources array would be mandatory. The way it's setup, any attribute inside the sources array is mapped to a HTML attribute (so you can easily add custom) but I guess I'll have to rethink that. \n. @martindale , I was thinking about your suggestion to use type as video for YouTube and Vimeo and I think it makes sense as we might be able to use YouTube as a source for Audio also (at a later date).\nVimeo will be a beta feature on release, I'll need help/feedback on it I think. I think the fragaloop API is really the problem and might have to write my own (it just uses window.postmessage anyway). We'll see.\nI'm almost done with v1.5. Sorry it's taken so long. Christmas and New Year was pretty hectic. Hope you all had a good one! :+1: \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\n. Hey Tom, yes we already do this. If you check the dist directory, there's a file sprite.svg. This contains all the SVG defs and then the default controls icons call the defs using <use>.\n. Checkout the gulpfile.js to see how the build works. The LESS to CSS and JS compression all happens there. Gulp is awesome (if you've not used it!). \n. Haha no worries! :+1: \n. No worries. I was going to take a look at this tomorrow but feel free. \n. Hey Joe, going to merge this with #3 and take a look in one hit. \n. Thanks for this. I'll fix this tomorrow. \n. Let me know if you run into any more issues :+1: \nCheers!\n. Hey there,\ndocs.js just contains the demo code to setup the player. If you don't call the setup method then it won't work- this is where you pass any custom options to plyr. The section below in docs.js which calls the setup method. The only required parameter is html but if you read the docs you can find out more about how it all works. \njavascript\nplyr.setup({\n    debug:  true,\n    title:  \"Video demo\",\n    html:   templates.controls.render({}),\n    captions: {\n        defaultActive: true\n    }\n});\n. Might be worth having a read of controls.md and the general docs readme.md again. You don't have to use Hogan. \n. Good idea. Should be pretty quick to do as well. I'll look at this asap. \n. Hey tuag,\nYes that would be possible but you might have to do something like this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8885701/play-local-hard-drive-video-file-with-html5-video-tag\nCheers\n. Thanks for reporting. I'll look at this now. \n. This should be fixed now. Pushed a new build and updated http://plyr.io. \nThanks for reporting. Let me know if you find anything else! :+1: \n. Hey @terraconnect , sorry about that. Of course, each browser has their own and generally inconsistent implementation of the fullscreen API, some using FullScreen and some Fullscreen. Then of course there's good old Microsoft who feel sometimes they should prefix their events and methods with ms and sometimes MS. Sterling work.  \nThanks for reporting it :+1: \n. Safari certainly has it's quirks. A recent one that's been frustrating is (1000).toLocaleString() which should return 1,000 in most browsers when set to English language and 1.000 or 1 000 in some other languages. Of course Safari just returns 1000 so it's hard to get the thousand group separator for the users locale in Safari. \n. Hey @zyxep , I'll look into how feasible this is and get back to you. \n. Hey @ronag , it's something I want to do but struggling to find the time to devote to it at the moment. I know there's dash.js but wasn't aware of hls.js. I'll take a look at that. It's hard to say when it'll be done given the nature of the project is basically whenever I get free time at the moment :-(\n. Thanks @jocelynthode , I'll take a look at this. Should be pretty straight forward.\n. Hey @jocelynthode , I've just pushed a fix with some changes to seeking. There's no popup (it's on my list) but when you seek you get an instant update of the play time and it's just generally a bit nicer now. Let me know if that's better for you. \n. Thanks for this :+1: Spelling is not my strong point, clearly! :-)\n. Hey Riaan,\nGood suggestion. It should be possible. I'd have to overlay an <input type=\"range\"> over the top of the progress I think but let me have a think and get back to you. There might be a better way. Definitely do-able though. \n. Hey Riian, \nJust pushed a fix for this. Take a look and let me know! \nCheers\n. Both good points. The problem is the native <progress> element is pretty janky (I tried everything). IE is actually pretty smooth oddly but Webkit and Mozilla aren't the best. I tried adding transitioning but of course that means 2) happens. I think I'll remove the transition for now. \n. Hey @slapresta , I'll put a fix in for this now. Cheers for letting me know! \n. Fixed in v1.0.20!\n. Great idea. I'll look into it. It would need to accept an array I'd think for multiple formats as well. Easily done though. \nCheers!\n. Looking into this next as it fits well with playlists as @dvdheiden mentioned. Give me a day or two. \n. Almost done with this. It'll go out later today. \nBasically I've written the method so it'll take either:\n- A single string source \n- An object of attributes (src, type, etc)\n- An array of attribute objects \nDepending on what's been passed will effect how it's rendered (src attribute on the element vs child <source> elements)\nDoes this sound about right? Currently working through some quirky Webkit behaviour and then I'll merge it to master and push v1.0.22.\nCheers for the support :+1: \n. This should be fixed in v1.0.22 - let me know. \nI ended up just accepting a string source which sets the src attribute on the video or audio element and also an array of objects which will output <source> elements with the provided keys as attributes. \nCheck out https://github.com/Selz/plyr#api for more info and let me know if you find anything wrong! \n. Hey @martindale , my aim was to avoid including them to keep the size down but I can't see the size increasing too much thinking about it. I'll add them now though.\n. Added them into v1.0.20. Cheers\n. Hey @adantzler,\nThanks! Nice idea. I'll have a look at implementing something for sure. :+1: \n. Cool! You might want to use MutationObserver rather than DOM events given the performance benefit:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver\n. Hey @master-lincoln ,\nGood suggestion and relatively easy to add. My only concern was keyboard users but some clever focus event detection should solve that. I'll look into it. We actually do it on selz.com (check the homepage vid) so I've already written the CSS but an option would be good. \n. Sorry, you're right. It's a purely CSS solution I used on Selz. It's based on :hover so if you can hover out (you'd need multiple screens) it'd slide down but it's not ideal. I'll work on a JS based solution (with class hook) for this to monitor mouse move. \n. Hey @master-lincoln , sorry for the delay but this is now in v1.0.29. I've made it so it hides after 1s (CSS transition) and if you mouseover over the progress bar (the only visible control), the controls re-appear. If you focus a child control they should also appear. On a touch device you need to tap the video which will play or pause it if you have the click option set to true (default).\nThe option is within the fullscreen option object and the property name is hideControls. It's defaulted to true.\nCheck it out on http://plyr.io :+1: \n. HTML5 and Vimeo players progress elements are updated based on the 'progress' event from the media element - the rate of which can't be sped up. Were you referring to a YouTube player? \n. Hey @AndersonReyes , that'd be awesome. My thoughts on it would be to try and re-use the current sr-only labels/spans as the tooltips (by switching class based on the option). This would keep the markup clean. Also they shouldn't be \"display: none\" as this would mean they'd not get read out by screen readers. If you use Mac you can test using Voiceover , and NVDA on Windows. \nIf you need any help with anything, give me a yell on Twitter. :+1: \n. Without going into too much detail, SVG is my preferred option now. Icon webfonts often don't look as crisp. If you're set on using fontawesome, I'd suggest using custom controls using the html parameter.\nFor more info on why SVG is better:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/\n. I\u2019m happy with the current icons that I made but you\u2019re welcome to use whatever icons you like in your implementation \ud83d\udc4d. That isn't a directory, it's a protocol relative URL. The docs index is purely meant as an example usage of the player. <script src=\"//cdn.plyr.io/1.0.20/plyr.js\"></script> will load the JavaScript source from the CDN, for example. \nIn terms of a how to, I'd suggest starting with the readme.md. \n. Hey there, yes that's because you're serving it from the local filesystem. Looks like you're using Ubuntu which comes with Apache so you should use that for local development. I'm pretty sure the root directory for Apache is /var/www/html so you can create a plyr folder in there and put all the assets into it. Then go to http://localhost/plyr and it should work. \n. Awesome! \n. I'll update the docs to make it more obvious. Thanks for the feedback fellas :+1: \n. I'm working on this next along with loop controls for #115 \n. I'm getting there slowly. It's hard with a wife who's 7 months pregnant and preparing for the little ones imminent arrival (our first). I've been trying to squeeze it in here and there. I'm keen to get it out ASAP too. . Yep, I saw that. Unfortunately my impending child (very soon) takes priority over this right now. I'll try my best though. \nSam\n\nOn 24 Jan 2017, at 1:13 am, Paulius Uza notifications@github.com wrote:\n@SamPotts I posted a 50$ bounty, I would appreciate if you could spend some time on this in the next few days.

Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . It is responsive and yes, it's bootstrap compatible although it's designed to be a standalone module and work with any framework/ui kit. \n. Hey @fclaussen, \n\nThanks for that. Yes, the reason it's broken down into folders is the standard build process with projects like these. You tend to have a src folder where the source files live (uncompressed JS, LESS, SASS, etc) and are then built using build systems like gulp or grunt which output compressed, production ready files to dist. If you're not familiar with this setup, I'd encourage you to have a play. Once you're learnt it, you'll wonder how you worked before! :) \nAs I said in the original issue, my preference would be to make it an option (not everyone may want them) and use the original .sr-only spans and labels for the tooltip so there's not doubled markup but I've not had a deep dive into your solution yet. \nI'll take a look at what you've done and go from there. :+1: \n. Hey @fclaussen , I've done it a slightly different way but thanks for your work on this :+1: \n. Hey @jofrysutanto ,\nDid you try the loop attribute? I tested that today and it seemed to work ok? \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/video.html\nCheers\n. Thanks! :+1: \nI meant you can add it to the <video> or <audio> element. e.g....\nhtml\n<video src=\"path/to/video.mp4\" controls autoplay loop>\n</video>\n. No worries :+1: \n. I did look into this but I've not found a suitable solution yet. The \"native\" way seems to be to seek to 0 and then call .load() but the problem with that is .load() will basically make another request for the video. Not ideal. I will keep looking. It looks like video.js and the like load the poster image into a div, which I'd like to avoid that if possible. \n. Hey, there's a bug fix for this in v1.6.2\n. Hey @tomByrer ,\nThe fundamental reason I wrote Plyr was because neither Video.js or MediaElement.js allowed me to write semantic, custom controls. At the time they used hacks like <span>  and <a href=\"#\"> as buttons which is just plain lazy. Even supporting IE7 is possible using the correct elements. I didn't support IE8 and 9 because the longer you support vintage browsers, the longer they stay around for. You have to break eggs to make an omelette as the saying goes. I really just wanted to write a simple layer/abstraction on top of the already pretty decent HTML5 player. I didn't really write Plyr to be \"better\" but perhaps giving people another option. If you need to support the older browsers then consider Video.js or MediaElement.js. \nVariable playback rate has been raised and should be relatively easy to write. I just need to think about the best way to incorporate some of these changes without the library becoming too bloated with features that only some people use. Variable play rate is super simple so would be a \"core\" feature. Things like playlists and Youtube or Vimeo playback would be add-ons to the core in my eyes. \nJust my 2c. I am totally happy to hear feedback on it. \n. You'll probably find that these days, it's corporate users that get stuck on old versions (from experience). Legacy systems make the upgrades more difficult. Most (if not all?) major browsers now self-update so the non computer savvy users barely notice anything has changed unless something they use frequently in the UI has changed. \nLike I say the playback speed itself is easy. The UI will probably take a little longer to do nicely. I also want to be able to make controls optional which I'd probably do at that stage. \n. Yeah I acknowledge this is a problem. It annoys me too. I'm really not sure what the best way to do it would be unless the tooltips \"expired\" after a couple of seconds. The fact the buttons are highlighted is also not ideal. We need a :tabbed pseudo class selector :+1: \n. Yeah the styles are based on :focus which for a keyboard user is the only way to see which control is the current selected one. This has the downside that if you click an element, the focus stays on that element until you click elsewhere. :active and :hover have different meanings, :active is the pressed state and obviously I don't need to explain :hover. There is a way of detecting a tab vs a click which I will implement at some stage but there's more important features (playlists and youtube/vimeo etc) to work on right now. \n. Couple of useful links for when I get around to this:\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5653332/differentiate-between-focus-event-triggered-by-keyboard-mouse\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16144611/detect-focus-initiated-by-tab-key\n. Yep. Aware it's not fixed, hence the issue still being open. I'm getting to it. \n. This should be fixed (at long last!) :+1: \n. Is this just the formatting changed to 2 spaces? I usually use tabs or 4 spaces but I noticed GitHub isn't so great at retaining the formatting. I'll merge this shortly. \n. Oh what were they? It was building and working fine for me using the gulp script?\n. Ah, I can see an @ reference for a variable that you've fixed. Cool. \n. Thanks for that Bruno :+1: \n. You're pointing to an old version. Check the latest version. Due to cloudfront caching I had to change the name to en.vtt. It's just demo code. \n. Hey @adrianmak,\nI'm sure you can although I've not tried it personally. You'd need to set the advertisement video as the original source for the video and then bind an event to the \"ended\" event that then calls source() to set the source as the \"main\" video. e.g.:\n``` javascript\n// Either reselect the player instance or use the return value from plyr.setup();\nvar player = document.querySelector(\".player\").plyr;\n// Listen for end and call source();\nplayer.media.addEventListener(\"ended\", function() { player.source(...); }, false);\n```\nYou would need to remove this event binding after the switch though or the video source will keep getting reset (not ideal). \nCheck https://github.com/Selz/plyr#api what arguments source() accepts. \n. How did you go with this? I'm just going to close the issue. Let me know if there were problems. \n. Hey Jakub,\nThanks! Are you using the latest version? I changed to use a range input rather than detect a click on the progress bar and calculate the offset. The change was partly for the reason you mentioned and partly for a better experience on touch devices. \nMaybe give that a go and let me know?\nCheers\nSam\n. No worries at all. If you find anything else let me know :+1: \n. Excellent suggestion. I have a few other tweaks that I can bundle this with. I'll do this shortly. \n. Should be all good now. Check it out and let me know. Cheers :+1: \n. Hey mate,\nI've not really had a play with either but like you say it might be a bit overkill? Could you not use apache or the like in one of your VMs? I just use the built in apache in OS X. \nCheers\n. How do you mean? On the source of the player? I think the best I could do would be to just throw up a message if none of the sources were valid? e.g. nothing loaded, like a catch all? \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video#Error_handling\n. Very strange. I'll take a look. \n. Thanks for the feedback fellas :+1: This should be fixed now. \n. Hey @franks921, funny that you added this as I just this minute added displaying duration at startup as an option. I'm going to make some changes to how the controls work soon though so I'll use what you've done for that. I was going to add an option for hiding/showing some controls etc so this will be useful for that. It'll probably be v1.1 or something. Then I need to crack on with playlists... \nThanks for your work :+1: Looks the same as how I've done it. \n. Hi @afemath , I was unaware of these issues. I will take a look. I'm sure it'll be an easy fix. \nThanks :+1: \n. Hi @afemath, I've just had a look at this again but I can't seem to re-produce the errors with IE10? Plyr doesn't currently support IE9 because it doesn't support the <progress> element unfortunately. I was planning on adding support by detecting the presence of Lea Verou's polyfill (https://github.com/LeaVerou/HTML5-Progress-polyfill) but not sure what to do about <input type=\"range\"> since all the polyfill's are pretty gross for that. \n. Closing this as I don't plan to support IE9 and IE10 should be functioning. \n. No worries :+1: \n. Duplicate of #8 - I will get to it asap but need to build some sort of plugin framework first. :+1: \n. I'll write something for this now. Good idea :+1: \n. I've added a couple of methods that should be useful for you? Let me know. \nBear in mind that due to browser security restrictions toggleFullscreen needs to be user initiated. So if you had a button on your page you wanted to use to trigger fullscreen:\nhtml\n<button type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"fullscreen\">Toggle fullscreen</button>\n``` javascript\nonSetup: function() {\n    var player  = this,\n        type    = player.media.tagName.toLowerCase(),\n        toggle  = document.querySelector(\"[data-toggle='fullscreen']\");\nconsole.log(\"\u2713 Setup done for <\" + type + \">\");\n\nif(type === \"video\" && toggle) {\n    toggle.addEventListener(\"click\", player.toggleFullscreen, false);\n}\n\n}\n```\n. Grab v1.1.3, there's a couple of other small fixes in it :+1:\n. Cheers dude :+1: \n. Sounds good to me. I've been meaning to clean up the LESS and SASS/SCSS a bit so I'll take a look at your other suggestions. Cheers :+1: \n. Yep should be straightforward. I'll take a look. \nCheers :+1: \n. Sorry for the delay, this is now in the latest version. I created destroy() and restore() API methods. destroy() will basically restore the player to the original untouched state and restore() basically creates   a new instance. Let me know if that's what you were after? :+1: \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plyr.js#L1532\nRemember if you're using AJAX, you can set the source using the source(...) API method:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#api\n. It's an API method so needs to be against an instance - check the docs . OK I'll take a look. Strict mode does change a few things though. Ideally you want it on. \n. Sorry it took me so long. Let me know if everything is ok now. It should be fixed. Thanks for your code snippet. I basically just used that. Feel free to submit pull requests for anything else you find :+1: \n. Hey @arcadio813, Sorry to hear that. I've tested on Firefox and it seems ok for me. Have you tried http://plyr.io? Failing that, could you show me your VTT file? \n. What mime type were you using? It should be text/vtt. Maybe try using the demo file as mime type is already set. It can be found at http://cdn.selz.com/plyr/1.0/en.vtt. I'm not sure what else can be the problem to be honest. \n. Glad to hear you got it sorted... :+1: \n. :+1: \n. This will be included in v1.5. Sorry it's taken so long. \n. Fixed in v1.5.0 as part of the new source API changes.\n. Hey @tkggusraqk , could you clarify the issues you're having? If it's iOS you're using, the native <video> element doesn't allow much customisation unfortunately. \n. Hey @calvintam236 , this behaviour is already present but you need to be focused on the <input type=\"range\"> scrubber. I'd be hesitant to change the binding to be for the whole player since the left and right arrow keys also control the volume control. This is default browser behaviour which shouldn't really be changed on accessibility grounds. Keyboard users will be familiar which various inputs on HTML controls and changing them is generally not a good idea.\n. Hey @calvintam236 ,\nDon't enter a value less than 0 :+1: heh, I'll put some handling in there for that. \nYou can get the volume from the HTML element itself, but of course it's a floating point rather than the 0-10 range that plyr uses. \ndocument.querySelector(\".player\").plyr.media.volume would return 0.7 on plyr.io for example. \nMore info here:\nhttp://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html\nI'll put some handling in for the out of bounds values. \n. Pushed a fix for this also improved how the player monitors volume/mute changes. Let me know if there's any problems :+1: \n. I've just pushed some tweaks in 1.1.9 but check your local storage value. The value of the volume is set in local storage (it's an option, defaulted to on) so when a user comes back, they get the same value. If you muted and refreshed, this would be 0.\nRun this in your console:\nwindow.localStorage.plyr_volume\nIf it returns 0, then that's why.\n. Check 1.1.10 :+1: I think I've nailed it. \n. No problem. I'll look at your suggestion for changing track by API asap too. \n. Sorry I need to buy another Android device for testing to fix this one. Will get one asap. \n. Blimey. You're busy today. :)\nThey do two different jobs. \n- .support(\"video/mp4\") will check a plyr instance can support a certain mime type. e.g. \"video/mp4\"\n- .supported() returns if plyr is supported by the users browser (https://github.com/Selz/plyr#checking-for-support). e.g. IE8 would return {basic: false, full: false}. \nMight be worth having another quick read through the docs? \n. .supports() might be a better name since you're basically asking instance.supports(x). I'll move the position of the .supported docs but it doesn't work on a plyr instance, you can just call plyr.supported() so it works a little differently. \n. Sure - I'll do this at lunch time, won't take long. :+1: \n. Added this in as .togglePlay() :+1: \n. Will check this out. :+1: \n. You're using a data URI for the track source? That's pretty edge case. You're better off hosting them on a CDN and setting proper cache headers but I will look at this at some stage.\n. I've made a couple of changes which should resolve this I think. Thanks for doing some digging. :+1: \nYou really should add the correct kind attribute to the <track> element though since captions and subtitles are different things. Plyr now supports both and treats them the same. \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track\n. Closing this as it's a dupe of #157 \n. You're right. They must have made some changes. I'll take a look tonight. :+1: \n. This should be fixed now. Sorry about the delay :+1: \n. :+1: \n. It could well be a CSS issue, do you have a public page I could take a look at by any chance?\n. Someone else has mentioned this recently so I'll look into a solution for users using the base tag. \n. I'm not going to make that change globally though as it wouldn't work if the sprite is ajax'ed into the page elsewhere. In that case you just need <use xlink:href=\"#icon-id\"> - using external resources in tha attribute only works currently for same domain and not in all browsers. . Not quite. The current recommended method of loading a sprite if you're using cross domain is to load in the sprite using the AJAX method into a hidden div on the page and then reference the elements in the sprite by id. For example:\nhtml\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"#icon-example\"></svg>\nIn an ideal world to save the hassle with loading via AJAX you would reference the path to the icons in the <use> element as you describe, either:\nhtml\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"/path/to/sprite.svg#icon-example\"></svg>\nOr externally referenced:\nhtml\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/sprite.svg#icon-example\"></svg>\nUnfortunately the second option isn't allowed due to cross domain issues (even adding crossorigin does nothing). I've catered for these options however by offering an iconUrl option in the config which will either load via AJAX if external or using the first method if relative: \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#svg\nSo you could achieve what you're asking by specifying the URL to the sprite as the iconUrl option. \nYou can see the iconUrl in action if you clone and run the repo locally and head to /demo - you'll notice the xlink:href attribute value has the path prefixed:\n\n. Good point! :+1: \n. Is this still an issue? I think I pushed a tweak for this... \n. Yes but if I go ahead with this, you'll have to pause the video for the controls to show and then seek which is far from ideal. I think it needs some more thought than just disabling it otherwise it'll be annoying for some.\n. Could definitely make it an option (defaulted to allowing seeking since thats what I think most users will want - it's not an issue on IOS for example). \nAs for \"Or change play/ pause behavior to act after the controls are shown, not the first click like on the desktop?\", how do you see that working? The controls only show when the video is paused in fullscreen mode.\n. Sounds good. I'll implement something like that then. Nice one :+1: \n. You can change the height in the LESS or SASS if you want to. \n. Good call. This would be a quick win. I'll give it a go. \n. This is a browser bug, not a problem with Plyr. You'll notice if you refresh, 9 times out of 10 you won't get it. You don't need the cross origin attribute unless your tracks are being hosted on a different domain (like a CDN in the demo). Unfortunately the crossorigin attribute is not support on the <track> element itself. If you remove it on the <video> element you'll get another message:\nText track from origin 'http://cdn.selz.com' has been blocked from loading: Not at same origin as the document, and parent of track element does not have a 'crossorigin' attribute. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access.\nI'd suggest you raise it with Chrome or Safari if it's an issue for you. \n. The most annoying part is that header is present on the image response. \n\n. Hey @jayss, could you give me some more information on this? Safari on iOS or Desktop? What version? Looks ok here. \n. That's intended as Safari doesn't allow keyboard input in full screen mode... \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plyr.js#L556\n. Did you read the code in the link? I tested it and found it to be an issue, hence disabling it. Things may have changed since then. I'll take another look. \n. Looks like it's ok now. \n. :+1: \n. Hey mate, so what exactly do you want to do, control a player with custom buttons? \n. I could definitely look at a different container to inject the controls to. For sure.\nGood idea :+1: \n. The custom controls container will be in v1.5. I'm almost done with it. You'll be able to specify a selector (e.g. .js-plyr-controls) or a HTMLElement itself. \n. Fixed in v1.5.0 - selectors.controls.container is the text selector or HTMLElement for where to render controls. I will update docs shortly. \n. Points off for using Kanye West as the example ;-) but I see what you mean now. That might require some more work. I'll re-open this one then :+1: \n. Hard for me to help if I don't know what the errors are... v1.5+ does require some config changes so that might be the issue. \n. Thanks very much :+1: \n. It's not duplicate code:\nmozFullScreenElement is not the same as mozFullscreenElement ... notice the case of the S. \nNot sure what you're implying about the coding standards but it's just standard JavaScript. Please feel free to fork and make any changes you think are needed and issuing a pull request. \n. Sure. We do this on Selz using a hogan template and then injecting the correct language into placeholders but I'm sure I could come up with something for the default controls to make life easier. \n. Hey Lionel, I've added in i18n as an option. See controls.md for more info. :+1: \n. Good idea. Feel free to open a pull request! . Ah sorry to hear about this. I'll install NVDA on my Windows box and fix it up. I'd been testing on Voiceover on Mac which I guess is fairly niche but even that doesn't read the tooltips for the checkboxes even though they have labels but I think it's to do with visibility: hidden like you say. \n. What did you mean by \"Using 's with a description\"? \n. Ok awesome. I'll work on this a bit later today/tomorrow as it should be a quick win. Thanks for reporting it :+1: \n. Hey, can you check out http://plyr.io? I think I've fixed this now? \n. Good suggestion @MichielBijl , I'll change them to toggle buttons which should resolve it for Safari. Oddly, Chrome on OSX reads the labels correctly. \n. I've implemented the 'aria-pressed' attribute on toggle buttons and it seems to get picked up in Chrome on OSX as a toggle button (also reads selected state) using voiceover. NVDA in windows also works too and states they are toggle buttons. \nI've also made some improvements so that captions are read by NVDA etc (using live regions). \nIf you find anything else please let me know. I'm keen to make sure everything is top notch a11y wise. \n. Hey @Veyfeyken, I've removed the live region now so captions should no longer be read. I thought the same after I'd released it that perhaps it wasn't really needed given the captions intended purpose and thought about removing that. :+1: \n. Happy to make a button change at some point... \n. Chrome and Opera read the buttons as toggle buttons in Voiceover. I guess I should be consistent and change the play/pause to be a toggle switch or do you think it's ok as is? \nThanks again for your help :+1: \n. Cheers dude :+1: \n. Dang. I'll take a look. \n. @calvintam236 @ChristianPV Seems to be a bug with the YouTube API. I'll see if I can find a workaround. \n\n. I've been working on it when I can but basically the issue is that their onStateChange callback does not fire when you seek before you start playback. This basically breaks the script from that point onwards. We're not alone...\nhttps://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=4706\n. Thanks @calvintam236 , I'll take a look at your pull request and give it a test. \nI wouldn't add arrow support into the core library since it is ok on YouTube.com as a concept because each video has it's own page so there's no chance of two players being present whereas with Plyr that's not the case. The arrow keys will work when you are focused on the progress bar, as is the default behaviour for the <input type='range'> element. If you wanted the arrow keys to seek the player when not focused on the progress, I'd suggest binding to the document and using the API functions to do so. \n. This is the default behaviour of the YouTube API unfortunately. Calling .seekTo in their API will automatically play the video. \n. Thanks to @calvintam236 for your help with this :+1: Looks to be all resolved now. \n. Cheers :+1: \n. Sorry dude, I do have a task to test the scss but it built and rendered fine. Are some processors more forgiving of the @ vs $?\nCheers for fixing it (again!)\n. Did you update the LESS also? Does the same happen on http://plyr.io?\n. The control markup changed as a result of #103 which would cause this. You need to upgrade your LESS or SCSS me thinks. \n. OK so it's probably the captions markup that you've not changed. I did add a note to the change log:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/changelog.md#v130\nMore info here:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/controls.md\nA pretty small change really (<input> + <label> to <button>) which made more sense accessibility wise and it cleaned up the CSS and JS a bit also.\n. Awesome :+1: \n. Thanks for doing the housekeeping stuff. \nThe only change that concerns me is now you've broken the JSHinting by changing the quotations to mixed for the HTML commit. Maybe revert that or just change everything to be single if you really want to change it and then I'll merge it. \nI'd suggest using and editor that supports JSHint. Sublime has JSHInt Gutter which is good. \n. \n\nMixed double and single quotes\n. What was your reasoning behind that change anyway? The others seem fine. \n. Heh, \"us\" includes me. I'm also a full time designer and developer and I'm aware that both single and double quotes work fine for both HTML and JavaScript. It's merely a personal preference thing. Happy to go with singles for this though if it's needed. HTML in JavaScript is always going to be a trade off. Having HTML in JavaScript is a bit of an anti-pattern in itself. Templates should be used (like in the docs example). \n\nAlso, your \"fix\" for equal signs isn't really a fix. Nothing was broken there. Are you aware of the difference between == and === ? I only use === (which also checks type) when it's really needed. For example typeof will always return a string so === is not really necessary. Other cases such as checking for null or 0, it's recommended. \nI'll merge this in a bit later today if I don't find anything else. \n. All live in v1.3.4 :+1: \n. Good idea :+1: \n. Hey mate, I'll check this out and let you know. Thanks for raising it :+1: \n. Hey, this should now be fixed! Sorry about that. Cheers :+1: \n. I'll see if I can work on something. I need to do something for playback speed as well so this could be done at the same time. \n. I'll take a look. Thanks for reporting it... \n. Hi, could you give this another go with the latest version? \n. This should be fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Hey Mary,\nThis will be included in the playlists (#3) when I get around to it. It's my next big milestone though. \n. Well the instance is stored against the original selector. I agree it could be made more clear but it's essentially covered here:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#api\njavascript\nvar player = document.querySelectorAll(\".player\")[0].plyr;\nAlso setup will return the element similar to your second example, however if you have multiple on the page, it will return them all, which might be less than useful. \njavascript\nvar player = plyr.setup(config);\nHowever currently setup only accepts a full config as an argument, I could easily change setup() to allow either the config, the selector or the config and selector if you think that's easier to understand? \njavascript\nvar player = plyr.setup('.js-player');\nvar player = plyr.setup('.js-player', config);\nvar player = plyr.setup(config);\n. :+1: \nWhat do you think @martindale ?\n. OK. I've made it like so:\nPassing a NodeList:\njavascript\nplyr.setup(document.querySelectorAll('.js-player'), options);\nPassing a HTMLElement:\njavascript\nplyr.setup(document.querySelector('.js-player'), options);\nPassing a string selector:\njavascript\nplyr.setup('.js-player', options);\nPassing just the options object (which looks for .player elements):\njavascript\nplyr.setup(options);\nThis will go in v1.4 in the next couple of days\n. Added docs here in the develop branch:\nhttps://github.com/selz/plyr/tree/develop#quick-setup\nand \nhttps://github.com/selz/plyr/tree/develop#api\nWill add more on the \nClassnames and the default hook will change in 1.4 to plyr instead of player to be consistent. Easy enough to find/replace. \n. Yeah, you're probably right. I guess my thinking was just to make it easier for the less technically advanced users out there. I agree with you though, it'd be better to not do it automatically. \nMy issue with not having an initial <audio> and <video> element on the page is that there's no non JS fallback in place then. I've tried to keep this a progressive enhancement thing. \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\n. Why did you give all my replies thumbs down? I'd have replied to help but don't want to risk another thumbs down! Good luck with it, you're on your own. . I can look into this but feel it would be strange behaviour, what would the fullscreen version show? It would just be a stretched player. I could probably consider this if support for audio covers was added I guess? \n. OK, I'll look at this when adding the cover photo in somehow but don't feel it's worthwhile with the current audio player. It'd be fullscreen and using 5% of the screen real estate which negates the UI consistency for me. \nI could make it an option though I guess. That'd do no harm. \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\n. Good call. Thanks for picking up on this. \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\n. Hey @Riim , I'll take a look and add this into the next release. :+1: \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\nCould you please check as I'm new to UMD. \n. Cheers :+1: \n. Thanks :+1: \n. I'll add this into the next release :+1: \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\nIt now uses the title option.\n. iOS doesn't allow custom HTML5 video players. You'll notice all videos (on other sites too) will open the native player. Just one of those things unfortunately. \n. As I say, it's something Apple doesn't support. The native player is forced and videos play in full screen no matter what. Native apps have more control. \nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html\n. Yep. No point adding the custom controls since the video always opens up in the native player anyway. \n. I'm just unsure why we need to kill the sources when destroying the plyr instance. The point of .destroy() is to revert back to pre-initialisation state. Removing the source might be a bit heavy handed. I think we should make it an option you can pass to the method (boolean) and add it to the docs as an option to remove sources. Anyway, to remove all sources, it'd be better to call _removeSources() anyway as it will remove child <source> elements.\n. Sorry I never merged this but I was working on the new API method at the time. I've used this code in a fix I just pushed though, thanks :+1: \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/174\n. Will add something for this to the next release :+1: \n. Actually looking at this, I think this is something the dev should handle at their end rather than including in the code, since the loading of the SVG is really just an example of how it can be done. You should bundle the icons with any other svg icons as part of your build and manage them outside of the plugin. This is what we do with Plyr at Selz.com. \nI'll add a link to that gist in the docs though, thanks :+1: \n. Self hosted SVG sprite you mean or using icon fonts? I'd advise against icon fonts but if you must use them you'd have to create custom controls and pass them to the plugin. More details are here:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/controls.md\nJust replace any <svg> with your icon font <span> or whatever. \n. Sorry about this. You need to run Gulp to build the templates but I've removed that dependency now so grab the latest version and you should be good. If you want to remove the dependency locally without updating, just remove the templates.controls.render() line for the html option. It was just to showcase that custom HTML can be used for the controls rather than using the built-in template.\n. Are you seeing these errors on https://plyr.io? The docs code is specific to the docs setup so don't use that for your setup. Take a look through the docs https://github.com/Selz/plyr \n. It seems to be the only way to \"clear\" the previous text in one of the major browsers. I tested in quite a few when I first did the project. It might no longer be a bug now. I'll check it out. \n. You need to call plyr.setup() which is all mentioned in the docs. I'd really suggest reading that first? \nI'll look at your potential iPad bug. \n. Are you using the develop branch? That's not really production ready code at this point. \n. Ahhh it makes sense. I'll add something into the docs about that for v1.5.\n. Fixed in v1.5.0. plyr is now exclusively the namespace for CSS. \n. Is this an issue on plyr.io? Or just an issue on the develop branch? The controls should not even show on iOS due to support issues.\nSam\n\nOn 27 Dec 2015, at 2:24 PM, Joseph Silber notifications@github.com wrote:\nIn iOS (at least on the iPhone), tapping anywhere in the progress bar does not seek to that position.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Ah, well that's again an iOS quirk where you have to drag the handle of a progress element. However, as its not really visible on the current design, it's not obvious. I was planning on making the controls a little more like the YouTube and new Facebook video controls so I guess I'll do that in v1.5. \n\nSam\n\nOn 27 Dec 2015, at 4:56 PM, Joseph Silber notifications@github.com wrote:\nIt's there too.

Use rangetouch. It works fine on https://plyr.io. I've also mentioned it in the docs. . Good catch. This an easy fix - need to actually store a test object in storage (in a try/catch) and check it actually stored. I'll make a fix. \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\n. Yes, because you're passing a JSON string as opposed to an object. Try this:\n\nplyr.setup({ controls: [\"restart\"] });\n. I've not tried such a bare bones UI so I'll have to get back to you on that. \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\n. Hey @gurupras , the LESS or SASS (you only need one) must be processed into CSS for any changes you make. There's a few ways to do this depending on your environment: \n- Gulp / Grunt - Node/JavaScript based built tools\n- Codekit - Desktop mac app for building many languages\n- Dotless - A nuget package for c#/.NET builds\n  ... and many more\nIt really depends on your workflow. If you're new to LESS or SASS, I'd probably recommend SASS at this point since it's more advanced. I'm yet to make the switch over. \n. Just closing this as an issue. Feel free to reply if you have questions still. \n. Cheers for this :+1: \n. Fixed in v1.5.0\n. Yep, certainly is. You can write custom controls. More info is here:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/controls.md\n. Cheers for this :+1: \n- That's not going to work for those that use the src attribute on the video or audio element itself\n- I'd probably return all the child source elements as an array of objects, with keys src and type\n- You don't need the semi colon at the end of a function definition. \n- The comments standard we're using is //\n- Missing the curly brackets for the first if statement\nHappy to make these changes if you don't have time.\n. Awesome. Yeah no worries on 1 and 2. I can take care of them. \n. That would work yep. \n. Nice one fella :+1: \n. Probably develop. I'm working on v1.5 in that branch (Vimeo support added) and a few other fixes:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/milestones/1.5\n. One more thing. Setup jshint in your editor and it'll show formatting errors. Just realised you used double quotes and we changed to single recently. Not a big issue as I'll manually merge and fix it in develop now. \n. This is merged to Develop now with the changes I mentioned above. \n. My only concern is the the passing of this will be broken. I'll merge it though and take a look. \n. It's cool. All minor and sorted. I just moved the _registerHandler up to where _on and _off etc are and renamed to _proxyHandler as it's kinda like a middle man. You were right about the this references but what I've done is:\nuserHandler.apply(element, [event]);\nThat will send the element the handler is bound to as this to the callbacks which I thought might be useful for those wanting to add their own handlers.\nCheers for that :+1: will add to the v1.5 changelog. \n. Will this just append new track elements or should we remove old ones?\n. Definitely mate :+1: I've been planning on adding this in at some point. I'll work on the UI when I get some spare time. \n. I'll be spending some time on this at the weekend. Getting close. \nCheers\nSam\n\nOn 4 Jan 2017, at 7:10 pm, Harm Aarts notifications@github.com wrote:\nI'd love to see this happen: https://www.bountysource.com/issues/29869063-add-support-for-multiple-tracks\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. I've already started work on it. I can't see any UI changes in your fiddle there that would facilitate the functionality. I've been working on a settings menu for captions, speed and quality and working on them simultaneously so will finish that.  \n\n\n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . I think what he's suggesting is that we have an option to pause other instances on play of a particular player? We could certainly add this as an option. \n. It would need to sit behind a setting/option ideally as not everyone may want the behaviour but sure go ahead. \n. Hey, \nIn the latest version you can get the instance reference to all players on a page using plyr.get(). This will return an array of instances so you could do something like:\njavascript\nplyr.get().forEach(function(instance) { \n    instance.pause();\n});\nThat's going to pause all players of course though. I'll still look into the unique option though. \n. The thing is Plyr is a 1-to-1 constructor in v3+ so it has no knowledge of the other players. \nYour snippet is for pre v3 by the looks of it as there's no setup method anymore. . @weavermedia It might be something I could port over as a static method that sets up multiple players. Will have a think. . You only need to specify options if they are different from the default. In the case of the html option, you could omit that and just use the controls option like you have.\nplyr.setup({\n    controls: [\"play\", \"current-time\", \"duration\", \"mute\", \"volume\", \"captions\", \"fullscreen\"],\n});\nWhat's your HTML markup?\n. You don't need to use the controls option if you're specifying html, they are mutually exclusive. What have you changed in the HTML and what is the error?\n. Sorry, the controls docs were out of date. I've just updated. Try the updated code. \n. You don't need line breaks. It's simple HTML. A line break (unless you mean <br>) means absolutely nothing. Basically it just needs to be a string.\nYou could use something like this:\nhttp://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/developer-tools/html-javascript-convertor/\nand select Build up a string variable that you can use later then use that in your configuration. I could add more information but this is basic JavaScript and HTML knowledge. \nIf you want, you could use a Hogan template instead. \n. There were three classnames that were wrong on the example controls but they didn't throw an error, just made the controls look weird. I've fixed that now in the example: \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/controls.md\nI've used those exact controls here:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/587x93rd/\nSeems to work fine for me? Make sure you're using the latest code of course. The player namespace is from an older version, 1.5+ uses plyr as the CSS namespace and contains a lot of bug fixes and enhancements. \n. Sounds good. Will take a look :+1: \n. The latest version is now included in npm. Let me know if you run into any problems. \nnpm install plyr\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/plyr\n. Cheers :+1: \n. Thanks mate, I'll fix these up. :+1:  \nOddly I do test by running the gulp sass task but it didn't throw any errors.\n. Cool mate. Looking at #149 now. \n. No worries, just pushed the fixes :+1: \n. I ended up re-writing this as the new source stuff meant after source change, the events weren't bound properly. Could you give the latest version a check? \nIt should wait 2 seconds (I could make that timeout an option) before hiding the controls if you've not moved the mouse. When mouse is over the controls, they should never hide.\nFeel free to close if you think it's fixed now.\n. You're right - it needed to be outside that block (which it is in the LESS, hence that working). All sorted :+1: \n. Cheers for this :+1: \n. Thanks. The NPM stuff is new to me :)\n. Awesome, glad you like it. \nI did this today? Is this what you mean? \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/146\nShould have the latest version on there now. I've also updated the readme but I can push your change to package.json if you like?\n. Just updated it to v1.5.10 with your changes in :+1: \nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/plyr\n. Thanks again, sorry again UMD etc is new to me. \n. Merged this previously. Can I close this or should we keep it open just incase anyone has input?\n. Thanks :+1: \n. I will take a look. There were several bugs with VTT captions and WebKit browsers, hence rendering using the in built engine instead. I will have a look and see if things have changed though. \n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Cheers :+1: \n. Please check the docs. v1.5 had breaking changes to the source api method. \n. Just noticed that and edited :+1: Apologies for the confusion. I think it was a merge with the new get function of the source method. \n. OK will give it a test... \n. Oh sorry yeah, I already updated the docs to mention that it needs to be an array of objects. I assumed you'd seen that part... \n. Yes, that was _before _ v1.5. An array is now required. I updated the docs after your initial comment above and replied saying they were edited.\n. There's also a whole section dedicated to it now:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#source-method\nMaybe the table was the confusing part but I removed the array comment in there. It was meant to be object. Check the above for examples :+1: \n. Ah yes, that needs updating, clearly. \n. I have looked in this again and just can't understand why it doesn't work using the source API. Using the exact same string on initial load is fine but dynamically adding it to the DOM means it just permanently loads. \nI don't really understand the benefit of using Base64 for something like this given the downsides of memory usage, increased bandwidth (base64 generally increases file size) and not being able to cache the content anyway. \n. Not sure what you mean about the exclusion? Do you have a link? \nThe odd thing is that loading a Data URI on initial load is fine, it's when a source is dynamically added that it just doesn't work. I verified the string is identical too, so it's very weird.\n. Well nothing changed regarding adding the source elements to the dom. It basically takes whatever 'src' attribute is specified, adds it to the element, injects it to the DOM. \n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . I think using !default would solve this? \nhttps://robots.thoughtbot.com/sass-default\nSorry, I've always been a LESS person and have been meaning to move over to SASS but just haven't found the time. I'll check it out and get back to you.\nCheers :+1: \n. Hey Michael, \nThis is definitely on the cards. Currently the player only supports the standard progressive download which as you know, isn't ideal. I'm just weighing up the possible solutions at the moment. It seems Safari only supports HLS and everything else supports Media Source Extensions (to a mixed degree). Dash.js is a nice library that wraps MSE and seems to standardise it but still that leaves HLS. It's definitely the next big feature as the demand is there (I keep getting tweets about it too!) \n:+1: \n. There's another related issue, #39 \n. Good idea :+1: I'll do this today. \n. Sorry about the issues. I'll take a look. :+1: \n. Thanks man :+1: :-)\n. Hey - could you give this a check in v1.6.0? I made some changes to the seeking UI which may help this. \n. Awesome - thanks for getting back to me \ud83d\udc4d \n. Sounds like I need to have another look at how the captions are working. The support was mixed at the start of the project and I think things have changed recently. I'll take a look. \n. Thanks for your fix, can we close this one now? \n. The problem seems to be that Chrome decides it doesn't want to fire a cuechange event after doing it twice. Safari and Firefox have some pretty tragic bugs in this area too. It might be better to manually render them for everything which is a shame, I guess it's not important for the browser developers :-1: I'll keep digging. \n. Found the issue - my demo webVTT file didn't pass validation and the browsers don't seem to communicate these issues, they just fail silently - awesome. \nFound a good validator and added it to the docs: \nhttps://quuz.org/webvtt/\nDone a quick test in the various browsers, Firefox still doesn't support the cuechange event - a bug has been raised. I found that Safari now supports TextTrack... well, apart from ignoring the type attribute on the track (we set it to hidden to hide default rendering) but that's solved by hiding them with CSS.\nGrab v1.5.13 and let me know how you go but I think we're all good?\n. Does it work on https://plyr.io for you? It sounds like an issue with the audio file to me. Have you tried another file?\n. I could definitely add it as an option to pass in. I'll look into it. :+1: \n. I did start at the weekend but the problem is that the duration property of a media element is only a getter so setting it won't be possible meaning I'll have to abstract it to to another variable somehow. Should be fine, I'll create an internal 'getDuration' method which will return the custom duration (if specified) or the determined duration. I'll take a look again tonight.\n. Hey, sorry for the delay with this. You can now add a duration option either using the usual options object or using a data attribute (data-plyr) which I just added support for, obviously it needs to be JSON formatted so you need to wrap the JSON in single quotes in your markup. \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/readme.md#options\n. Good idea :+1: I'll work on this for the next release\n. Will look into this. Thanks for reporting :+1: \n. Cheers :+1: \n. Thanks for this :+1: \n. The controls don't effect the duration - the duration comes from the media itself. If you want to display duration, try setting displayDuration to true in the config.\n. You can specify a custom duration if you need to over ride the one coming from the media file now if you need to using the duration option:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/readme.md#options\n. Hey @phanan , sorry about this. Is this after calling .source()? If so I did just find a bug with that, the media object is not reset so accessing it like that would still give you info about the old media object. Your example shows a new setup though, which should work. \nThis is with a basic example.\n\nRemember duration won't be available until after either a durationchange loadedmetadata event has occurred. You can check for these events using plyr:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#events\n. If you need the duration, you'll probably want to listen for the loadedmetadata as well. Unfortunately you have to wait for this to load - there's no way to predict how long the media is without this occurring. It's usually pretty fast though. \nI've fixed the .source() API to reset the media object on change so potentially your original issue is resolved. \n. Yeah you can do that if you need to retain the same element. Sounds like the .source() api method is probably no use to you unless you want to re-set the binding in your call to .source(). I could maybe look at not changing the element unless it's a different type.\n. It was requested that the source method should allow changes of type (e.g. audio to video). To allow for this, I remove the element and replace it. Like I say, I can look into retaining it if it's the same as the new type. It shouldn't be too hard. \n. Hey guys, sorry this was missed in my testing. It's strange that it's throwing an error. I did add a CustomEvent polyfill but didn't realise that the issue with IE is that CustomEvent is an object when it should be a function so the check should be more specific like the MDN polyfill. \nI'll update it now. \n. Hey @ronag, this is certainly possible but using CSS would probably be the best approach - much like the responsive iframe embed method (height: 0, padding-bottom: 56.5% and absolute positioned iframe to give you 16:9). What happens with the controls when you try to do it? \n. There's a video container div which may be useful. I've been meaning to make an option for auto hiding controls so they can be included in the aspect ratio and sit on top of the video like most other players but it's on the back burner at the moment. \n. Hey @ronag , with the new theme you should be able to use the 56.25% padding, 0 height trick to force 16:9 or another method as the controls are overlaid. \n. Thanks for this. There was a pull request for this for the old source() method but I'd been meaning to port it to the new method.\nI've fixed this for the source() api method but with destroy() the intention there is to return the player to it's \"default\" state, e.g. back to a native UI'd player. In my mind that would mean you wouldn't want to remove the sources there? I could make it an option of course though?\n. Hey @ronag, unfortunately this is a browser issue, not a plyr one. The poster display is handled by the browser itself - might be worth submitting this to Chrome, etc for review? I wouldn't want to get into the realms of changing this behaviour really. \n. Hey @shakeelmohamed, this is definitely possible and should be a small change, I'll try and do it this weekend. :+1: \n. Just pushed a change for this. You can access the API through element.plyr.embed.getVideoData() for YouTube and Vimeo through element.plyr.embed.api('play') :+1: \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/releases/tag/v1.5.17\n. Sorry if I was unclear, basically the embed property is a direct mapping to the respective api's. So all the methods for YouTube, such as .getVideoData() are available on that property. Vimeo uses .api('method') and is exposed in a similar way. \nDon't forget a lot of these methods are available in the standardised API methods built into Plyr. \n. I should probably check if duration has been set. Thanks for this. I guess the progress bar is probably redundant as well then. \n. Sounds good. I'm going to be looking at some UI improvements soon so I'll add this to the list. Probably more of a positive like plyr--has-duration\n. Hey, there's a bug fix for this in v1.6.2\n. Hey @phanan , this is a bug with the mobile browser implementation of the <input type=\"range\"> element and not the fault of Plyr. It just uses regular elements after all. I can look at something to perhaps \"fix\" the browser bug but it might be better as a polyfill outside of Plyr itself. It's a shame they haven't implemented it properly given the pressure to use the correct elements for semantics. It's frustrating. \n. I'll give this a test:\nhttps://github.com/dwyl/range-touch\n. That looks to be more of a polyfill for older browsers whereas we really need a fix for just touch devices compatibility. It doesn't seem to be an issue on desktop browsers. \n. I'll take a look at this on the weekend along with the other bugs raised recently. Should be able to come up with something by setting the input value based on the offset of the touch location. Might make it a separate lib given that it's a browser bug. \n. I just launched this: RangeTouch - I couldn't think of a better name (originally went with TouchRange but bought the wrong domain hah!) and given that the old lib above hasn't been touched for 2 years I thought it didn't matter too much. \nCould someone give it a spin on Windows and Android and report back? I think Mobile Safari was the main issue but it would be good to get it tested on those and unfortunately I don't have test devices. I did try the Xamarin Android Player which seemed to work ok. \n. Could you try adding RangeTouch to your setups and see how you go? You can also test on https://plyr.io \ud83d\udc4d \n. Awesome - will close this one for now then \ud83d\udc4d \n. @okhick Have a read up \u261d\ufe0fYou can just include the rangetouch script to fix the issues with touch devices and <input type=\"range\">. It's not an issue exclusive to this player. . You can try it out here: https://plyr.io . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thanks for this :+1: \n. Thanks for this :+1: \n. Hey @ruhong65 , sorry this isn't currently supported but is on my to-do list. \n. Merging this with #143 \n. I'll look into this ASAP. Sorry for the delay. \n. I've been trying to get to the root of it but can't seem to work out what's causing it. It seems to be an issue for YouTube as well. Still looking at it, it's my next priority. \n. There's a reason it's pointer-events: none - so that click events don't get to the iframe, using auto would be pointless as it's the default value. I'll do some testing but I suspect that won't be the fix. The problem seemed to also effect the YouTube embeds too. \n. I think I've worked out why this is an issue. It's an iOS limitation of playing videos without user input. As the iframe is treated as a seperate document the click on the parent of the iframe doesn't count (since it calls the API methods). Removing pointer-events: none fixes YouTube as that seems to bind to the video container to play but does mean that some changes will have to be made regarding hiding and showing controls on touch rather than play/pause. However, Vimeo doesn't bind to the video container, only their own play/pause button (hidden off screen in plyr) so this won't work unless we just use the vimeo controls for vimeo embeds. Less than ideal. I will keep digging. \nHere's a related thread on the YouTube issues:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/33902844/how-to-fix-if-playback-doesnt-begin-shortly-try-restarting-your-device-using\n. I've temporarily disabled support for YouTube and Vimeo on iOS until I can find a way to get them working 100%. It's an iOS limitation currently. \n. Does that work? I think the Vimeo API is the issue. I raised an issue on the API:\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/player.js/issues/87. YouTube should be working with full UI in the latest version, on iPads running iOS 10. . Yes. Read my comments above yours \ud83d\udc4d \n. Cheers :+1: \n. Fixed in the latest build. Thanks for reporting :+1: \n. Sorry, just going through issues and I can't see your demo page. Did you get this fixed?\n. Closing this as I can't seem to view your example or really understand the issue. Maybe give the latest version a go?\n. I'll add it to the list but there's streaming and playlists to get done first \n. Sorry I've not gotten around to this. It's hard to find the time and to prioritise everything. \nIn regards to your issues:\n- You can use the api to play the video after the ad has finished. There's a few methods that might be useful there.\n- You can use the api also for this. Calls to the source method will change the player. The only problem I can foresee is the need for an original element but give it a go and let me know. \n- Do you know the dimensions of the ads? You can probably do the old position:relative; height: 0; padding: x% and then a child with position: absolute; height: 100%; width: 100%; rather like responsive videos/iframes perhaps? \nWere you going to make this part of the core code or some sort of add-on? I've been meaning to create a modularised setup to allow for plugins but just haven't got around to it.\n. Sorry that's a typo in the docs - try adding event as an argument to the callback. \njavascript\nvar player = document.querySelector('.js-media-player').plyr;\nplayer.addEventListener('ready', function(event) {\nvar player = event.target.plyr;\n});\n. I think it would just be using the ended event:\njavascript\nvar player = document.querySelector('.js-media-player').plyr;\nplayer.addEventListener('ended', function(event) {\n    var player = event.target.plyr;\n});\nDid you try that and no luck?\n. The buffer error I will fix very shortly. \nI think the docs were incorrect here. I will update but try this code:\njavascript\nvar container = document.querySelector('.js-media-player');\ncontainer.addEventListener('ended', function(event) {\n    var player = event.target.plyr;\n});\nThe change is that events fire on the container, rather than the plyr object so you can't bind to that. Try that instead?\n. Ah no the docs were correct - I just didn't relay it correctly \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'll create an error callback, yeah. Will get to this on the weekend all going well. \n. Sure. Will have a crack this weekend. \nSam\n\nOn 29 Apr 2016, at 3:21 PM, Shakeel Mohamed notifications@github.com wrote:\n@SamPotts sorry to nag, will you be able to get this in the same release as #194?

I've already raised an issue to create the older theme for anyone that wants to use it. Styling should be kept separated from the JS so this will be a CSS change. In terms of a workaround, you'd have to hack around the LESS to get it presentable. Sorry, it was a improvement for most but I can understand the frustration of the UI change. I'll make a start on it now and maybe finish it today. \n. Pushed v1.6.4 with a fix for the progress issue\n. Are you using like YouTube and hiding the video? Hmm I've not thought about that but I guess that could be a use case for others too. \n. OK well a couple of others have asked for the old theme so I'll just make that and it'll be two birds with one stone as it were... \n. Thanks for reporting this. I'll take a look into it this weekend. Cheers :+1: \n. Sorry I admit I didn't look at the code snippet the first time around. Remove it from the event listener and it should work as expected. \n. Thanks for reporting this, I'll take a look this weekend :+1: \n. This should be fixed in v1.6.0\n. We could certainly add this option for HTML5 video and audio but of course links for YouTube and Vimeo wouldn't be possible. Vimeo offers downloading of some videos (opt-in by the owner). YouTube has no approved method. \n\nWith regards to adding load, that wouldn't be the case. Since the user is watching the video using progressive download anyway, it would be the same as them watching the whole video through the player. Using S3 and CloudFront (or similar) to serve your videos would be fastest method but might not always be the cheapest (the largest chunk of my AWS bill is always CloudFront by a large margin). \nThe only issue (minor) I can foresee is choosing the source to use for the link. If there are multiple (.mp4 and .webm for example), which one would be used? \n. Sounds like a good solution to me. I'll add it as part of a UI refresh I've been meaning to do.\n. I'll add this to my current stream of work given it'd be pretty straightforward. I guess with HTML5 we'd just grab the first <source> or src attribute. The others would link to YouTube or Vimeo. . I'll dig out an icon. I think I had one lined up already. If you wanted to add a PR that'd be great. \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/contributing.md. Just an FYI, I started on this. Should be done soon. . @jamesoflol Sure, will take a look. . It only took me over 2 years (!!) but this is finally in as of v3.4.5. \nYou can turn it on in the controls option by adding download. It'll automatically point to the current source and open in a new window. You can also specify a custom url in the urls option, specifically setting the urls.download property - e.g. \njavascript\nconst player = new Plyr('#player', {\n    urls: {\n        download: 'https://example.com/path/to/download',\n    },\n});\nYou can set the custom URL on the fly when changing source too by setting the config:\njavascript\nplayer.config.urls.download = 'https://example.com/path/to/download';. Add 'download' to your controls options. I need to make it clearer in the docs I guess:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/controls.md#using-default-controls. Thanks for this. I just need to merge with my new UI changes in v1.6.0 and we're set \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey, this is in v1.6.2\n. I didn't play around with it too much. I noticed in the SoundCloud API docs, to play \"direct\" without using their player would require an API key. Something to look at later on I think. \n. Awesome! Thanks for this. Could you create the pull request against the develop branch (I've just updated it) so I can check it out and test it before updating master? \n. OK will take a look thanks for the report \ud83d\udc4d \n. Ah, just taken a look and this is an error with Vimeo's code in https://f.vimeocdn.com/p/2.24.3/js/player.js - Might be worth raising it with them\n. Just pushed v1.6.0 with a new UI and updated NPM:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/plyr\n. +1 from @shakeelmohamed \n. I did make a start but I think it's going to require some changes to the controls markup to accomodate it because of the left and right groupings. I'll take another look shortly. It'll have to be a new set of styles + a JS flag for the different controls markup I think.\n. Hey mate, could we make the event name statechange just to be consistent with the HTML5 event naming rather than YouTube's old school camel case? \n. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d  I'll get it into master once the theming stuff is done\n. Merged this \ud83d\udc4d \n. Cheers dude! \ud83d\udc4d  I noticed this in the develop branch but cheers for sorting it. \n. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. This should be resolved now. Thanks for reporting \ud83d\udc4d \n. I manually cherry picked this and merged it in. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. You might be able to listen to the 'ready' event and then make the call to seek? \nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#events\n. Thanks for this \ud83d\udc4d \n. Merged this, cheers! \n. Cheers for doing this, just left a couple of notes \ud83d\udc4d \n. I've manually merged this one (the button with overflow: visible) - I think the other issues were already resolved - cheers! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Using left/right positioning wouldn't be ideal as it would mean the tips were either left or right aligned or you'd have to fix the width and use negative margins. Using translate (it's not scale) means its always center aligned based on the content. The overflow is not ideal I know and I've come up against this in full screen mode also. A possible solution might be to do custom styling for the 'outer' tooltips; on the play/pause button and fullscreen toggle to be left and right aligned respectively. I'll take a look at this one. \n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Fixed in latest version - thanks for reporting \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yeah I noticed this recently. It's because we have to do something funky to hide the Vimeo controls as they have no option like YouTube. Will investigate with the track API issue. \nSam\n\nOn 14 May 2016, at 8:55 PM, Calvin Tam notifications@github.com wrote:\nIt is currently align to the top of the screen.

This isn't really a bug with Plyr as such. As custom UIs for HTML5 video are not fully supported on iOS, no styles are added for it in Plyr. I'd recommend adding the following standard CSS for images, videos and audio to your build if you don't have it already:\n\ncss\nimg,\nvideo,\naudio {\n    /* Prevent overflow */\n    max-width: 100%;\n    /* Prevent gap underneath */\n    vertical-align: middle;\n}\nYou'll see the docs have something similar.\n. I didn't know that! Thanks for making the change! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Going to have to merge this one manually but will do. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. Will do. good idea \ud83d\udc4d \n. From #220 @thelamborghinistory \n\nFirst of all I just want to say I came here from PH and I instantly fell in love with this player (not only I have a crush on it but it also came up at the perfect time on my screen ;)). So big kudos to you guys.\n\nHowever, I am curious if it's possible to integrate an option to switch quality of a video like YouTube has (I think half of the functionality for such a feature is already done with the plyr.source() method, so there might just remain a nice dropup menu for the resolution options). What do you think?\nFrom #245 @tamanhquyen\n\nI have created player using your plugins . But i can't change quality on vimeo source . Please help me . Thanks a lot!\n. It's coming along... \n\n\n. No, but my baby son is and is growing well. Sorry, he takes priority right now. . I've been managing to squeeze in some more time here and there in between changing nappies and getting the little fella to sleep. Sorry it's just been a bit more complicated than previous changes given all the new UI components and having a kid in the middle of it wasn't well planned. \nThis is going to be launched along with:\n\nMultiple caption support\nMore advanced loop support\nSpeed controls \n\nI'm getting there just hang in there \ud83d\udc4d \n\n . Cool - I'm hoping to get a working version up and running in develop soon. Just trying to find more time. . Hey,\nI'm getting there slowly. I keep chipping away at it when I get a few minutes. \nVimeo's API is fairly limited and doesn't allow control over the quality like YouTube does unfortunately. It seems to be \"auto\" the majority of the time for me - mostly loading in HD. \nNice VWs! I have an R36 wagon and Audi S3 8L myself \ud83d\udc4d . Nope, still working on it. You'll see here when there's updates. Sounds like we'll have a load of testers \ud83d\udc4d I'm trying to find time where I can to get it done but as I'm sure you're aware (judging by your avatar) - there's a shortage of time when you have a kid. . See above. Plyr isn't a commercial, paid product. I do it in my spare time for free. . Thanks for the donations guys. Really nice of you. I'll set aside as much time I can this weekend to make progress on the remaining items on my list. \ud83d\udc4d . > ...and then most people forgot about this\nI'm not sure what you mean? No one's forgotten and I've been putting in as much time on it as I can. So far it only works for YouTube and their API is pretty flaky in this area. The video will play back with \"auto\" as the default (they determine it based on connection) and from there you can only increase quality it seems. i.e. attempting to go from 720P to 1080P is fine but downgrading doesn't seem to work. The way the API works is you \"suggest\" a quality and it may or may not change the actual quality - you listen for an event to indicate the quality has changed. \nVimeo does not expose the ability to toggle from SD to HD and vice versa. They don't allow a lot in their API but what they do allow works well. \nHTML5 quality control will have to come later, I'm not sure how to tackle that one quite yet. \nThe main delay is that I'm trying to do too much at once really, the main features in v3 include:\n\nAirPlay support\nPiP support\niOS inline playback support\nImprovements to the setup (a proper constructor) \nMulti language captions support \nImprovements to looping options\n\n...accompanied with a fairly hefty re-write in preparation for ES6 and making the lib more modular. . Yeah as @friday said really. It's still buggy at the moment. I am chipping away at it as much as I can and am close but still doing a lot of testing and fixing bugs. This version should be a lot more stable as a result but again, I can't guarantee when it will be done other than as soon as I can get it out the door. \nAs for @POPSuL for now it'll be YouTube only. Vimeo doesn't expose their HD toggle. HTML5 will follow soon after (and should be relatively straight forward) but I want to get it out rather than keep delaying. . The theory part is easy. Yes, it's easy in theory. Depends if we want to support multiple source formats etc - e.g. webm with fallback to mp4, etc . He struggles with reading I think. \n@ewwink Going by your avatar, you either have a child or are a child yourself so you know how much time they take up. If it's not so hard, where is your pull request? Did I miss a donation from yourself? If so I'm sorry!!\nI have to repeat myself over and over seemingly; open source is quite often written by people for free in their spare time. Be thankful, contribute, assist. Anything but sit back and moan like a child. \nv3 is in beta. Check it out. It doesn't have HTML5 quality options yet but I will work on that next. It was a major rewrite so it took some time. I hope that's ok with you. I'm sorry I let you down!! . Thanks fellas \ud83d\udc4d . Go for it. Just make sure you remember how the cascading sources work, i.e. if webm is specified and  supported, that's used, if not mp4, etc . I'm working on the HTML5 quality selection at the moment. Will look at Shaka after... . I think they'd be similar but I'm really not too familiar with Shaka, HLS, etc. I really need to brush up in those areas. \nThe way I'm doing it currently is by using markup like this:\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nThe issue I foresee is the compatibility of manual selection vs selection via media queries so I'm going to have to do a bit of testing there... \n. I'm not sure the native element fires an event when it switches via media query. Perhaps loadstart but I'd have to do more testing.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Media_events. The good news is I have the basic functionality working. There is a flash while the new source loads and the poster image is shown. I'm not really sure how that can be avoided other than somehow preloading the other video which would get really complex I'd imagine. Currently it's just swapping out the source.\nSome bad news. It appears YouTube are removing the option from their API! See the last comment here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/70440398. It was linked to from my issue here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/74463069. So it looks like my solution with the HTML5 quality selection breaks the media query functionality anyway so I think they'd be mutually exclusive. It's a shame there's no way to set an active attribute on the <source> element to force it to be active. Also disabled while we're at it. \nAnyhow, I've pushed v3.1.0-beta.1 which includes HTML5 quality selection. I still need to document it properly but effectively you specify a size attribute on the <source> elements and then a menu is created based on that. You can have multiple <source> for the same size with different mime types so the cascading <source> mechanism works as before. \nCheck it out here:\nhttps://plyr.io/beta. @aolko Not sure what's going on in that plugin. Pretty bad code: inconsistent formatting, strange variable names, and no comments. \nSo, I pushed this to master and it's now up at https://plyr.io . Sorry, could you be a little more impatient? There's plenty of other issues to attend to as I'm sure you can see. You're not the only one around here... \nIf you're going to raise an issue, at least put some effort into an explanation. A thumbnail where? There's poster image functionality baked right into the HTML5 elements. If you mean in the seek tooltip like YouTube does, then you'd need to do something custom. It might be possible using canvas to load the buffered video and use that to display. Another option would be generating them server side. It's on my to-do along with a load of other features. This is an open source project that I maintain in my spare time. \n. For sure - I will look into how this can be done. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Merging to #218 \n. This shouldn't be too hard to implement. Will take a look. \n. This was merged a few days back \n. We should totally add one though ... and fix the bug where scroll is not prevented if you're at 0% or 100%..... Can you try this again in v3? I have a feeling this should be resolved but if not, feel free to re-open \ud83d\udc4d . Will take a look, cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'm not able to replicate the above... I'd say you have a CSS issue there. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . This might be better as a suggested value in the docs. For most people (including myself), I use other SVG icons and combine them all into a sprite which is loaded asynchronously, this is something I would recommend over adding bulk to the core library. The cross origin issues are annoying but that's something that will probably get ironed out over time and then it will be possible. \n. Made a change to just load the SVG sprite using the CDN by default. \n. Yeah, for sure. Check the docs. https://github.com/Selz/plyr#html\n. There's something about killing the context menu that doesn't feel good to me. There are other options in there that user may find useful. I'll look into using shadow DOM selectors to hide the default controls. \n. I added an option to hide the context menu using @johnyeye 's code. Thanks for that \ud83d\udc4d \n. @accunity-arpit It's built in as an option now - see my comment above yours from last year \ud83d\udc4d . When I was designing the recent update to the UI, I did think about adding hover styles but concluded that it wasn't really necessary. If you think it is then maybe we can add something a little more subtle like an alpha transparent box-shadow thats nicely transitioned or perhaps scale the thumb a touch but I think flipping the color to the same as the progress bar is not something I'd go for... \n. Sounds good mate. You might want to update your branch as I changed transition to be all .3s ease so it won't auto merge. Sorry! \n. I'll add v1 in to the next release then - subtle is good \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yep. The first example as you said. \n\nOn 7 Sep. 2016, at 4:03 am, Robin notifications@github.com wrote:\nI meant this https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6537798/15412402/da319af6-1e2f-11e6-806d-c17a4cea2145.gif\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

Hey Morgan, \nThat's very odd given that CSS is just the LESS files built and deployed. What are you using to build the LESS? I had this issue when I wasn't using Autoprefixer (which I'd recommend using if you're not already) so it could be and probably is, that. If you can't use the Autoprefixer lib, then anywhere you see appearance: none you'll need to add prefixed versions manually - this would also apply to other spots too. I only write the unprefixed versions of properties to keep things lean and let Autoprefixer do it's thang.\nI'll add a note about this to the docs though. Thanks for reporting \ud83d\udc4d \n. Awesome \ud83d\udc4d \n. Sorry, not sure if they are bugs? They are toggle buttons and they toggle the state of mute or fullscreen. If they were regular buttons, it would be 'enter/exit fullscreen' and 'mute/unmute'. \n. Closing this one for now \n. Someone had raised this previously - I'll take a look \ud83d\udc4d \n. The time to load is the Vimeo or YouTube API's loading. There's no point showing the fullscreen action unless it can be used? \n. It appears the <iframe> that jsfiddle uses doesn't have the required allowfullscreen attribute. If you add this in the dev tools it works. As far as I can tell there's no real failsafe way to detect that the parent iframe has this attribute set. \n. A bug has already been raised for the above. I'm working on it:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/222\n. Issue or not it's awesome! I'll add this example to the readme \n. Dude, you're awesome. I'll add these to the docs very shortly... \n. Thanks again for this - I've added it to the docs here:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#streaming\n. My only concern is that the full screen functionality uses the native behavior and API. Changing that can sometimes be a bit iffy. If there's an option related to the standard full screen API, that would be preferable. \n\nOn 22 May 2016, at 11:29 AM, Lakshay Akula notifications@github.com wrote:\nIf you scroll down to watch a video, enter full screen and then escape, the browser moves to the top of the page.

Last time I look at custom context menus, only Firefox supported them. \n. Add it on the element with theplyr class. \ud83d\udc4d \n. The keys need to be wrapped in double quotes like this: \nhttp://codepen.io/sampotts/pen/yJBdaw\n\ne.g. \nhtml\ndata-plyr='{ \"tooltips\": { \"controls\": true, \"seek\": true } }'\n. Cheers - will do \ud83d\udc4d \n. I think this one can be closed now? Good idea with the CSS class hook usage \ud83d\udc4d \n. Could you not have used the iconPrefix option for this? The iconUrl option is really for if you want plyr to load the sprite for you. iconPrefix would allow you to specify the #plyr- part and change it to something like icon-plyr- and it would render:\nhtml\n<use xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#icon-plyr-play\"></use>\n. The viewBox is set on each icon in the sprite though. Check the examples and you'll see them. They aren't set by the JavaScript.  \nI think adding the templates option wouldn't really add anything? It's just a link to the SVG def after all. \n. Wouldn't surprise me with IE being quirky. If that were the case though, the demo on plyr.io would be broken in IE10 and 11. Plyr is not supported on IE9 anyway due to lack of support for <progress> elements and <input type=\"range\">. From experience, it's only needed on the nested SVG itself. Let me know. \n. Closing this one for now - no news is good news \ud83d\udc4d \n. I like the idea of not having to maintain the iframe code but an obvious downside is the slower performance of a round trip to get the HTML using AJAX prior to rendering. Will have a think about it. \n. As @friday pointed out, the API isn\u2019t standardized so it\u2019s not really an option. . Did you read the quick start section? The docs are comprehensive and assume an understanding of front end technologies.

I'll rename it then if you think that's what it needs - to me quick start = quick setup? Clearly a couple of you are struggling though so perhaps it needs more thought. Do feel free to suggest amends. It's a free, open source project that I maintain in my spare time after all :-) \n. Made some improvements in v1.7.0\n. Would it be better for you guys if setup() returned the HTMLElement (single or array if multiple) that Plyr was setup on, for you? Totally happy to do that. It makes more sense thinking about it given that the instance can always be accessed by the plyr property anyway. Happy to take suggestions. \n. So v1.8.0 has changes that mean setup now returns the elements (it's still an array), rather than the plyr object itself. Also some other refactoring which improves how the setup works but only if multiple media elements are found inside the HTMLElement, NodeList or text selector passed to the method. \n\nLet me know if this helps. Bear in mind v1.7.0 also had some changes to the initial markup required too. See the changelog for more info. \n. As above basically; no. \n\ud83d\udc4e for a link to w3schools though @AnthyG haha! I prefer MDN:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats\nPlyr also has an API method for checking support for a mime type:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#api\nSee support() - it requires you to pass a mime type such as video/mp4.

Cheers dude. \n. HTML5 Video is working fine as far as I'm aware. Users have reported issues with YouTube and Vimeo though. Are you seeing issues with HTML5 video?\n. I've merged this in manually since I had other changes. Thanks for helping out with it \ud83d\udc4d \n. @gino8080 I'll have a look when I find some time \n. Are you also getting this error on plyr.io by any chance? What is your config? \n. Currently if you're focused on the seek bar then the left/right arrows will seek (as is default browser behaviour when focusing an <input type=\"range\"> element. \n\nThinking it through though; when would you expect the left/right arrows to work? I'm not sure it would be expected behaviour and would be tricky when as I say, the <input type=\"range\"> elements also bind to left/right.\n. But what I mean is; when should left and right arrows trigger the seek? It needs some more thought around the interactions. Like mouse over the player but no control focused? It's not simple. I don't want to break standard keyboard interactions for accessibility reasons. \n\nOn 26 Jun 2016, at 11:40 AM, Mohamed Salem notifications@github.com wrote:\nyeah i know but it will be more flexible if you add this feature it will be nice rather than focus on the seek bar\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were assigned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

Hmm that screenshot looks like an old version of Plyr. This issue was fixed a while ago.  If you try the latest version (you'll need to update CSS too) then you'll see it works fine: \n\n\n. Thanks. Will update the docs. \n. Try using the latest version.

Fixed! I was experimenting with something and left that in there. \ud83d\udc4d \n. No worries. Sorry about the brief issue. \n. These prefixed declarations are handled using autoprefixer. I'd like to keep it that way as it manages which versions are required etc.\n. PostCss has a plugin for autoprefixer if there's any way you can use that? Sorry, I'd add the prefixed value to source but it means it's something else to maintain when the browsers eventually ditch the prefixes. \n\nI'll add a note in though, good suggestion! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Totally. I'd love to devote more time to Plyr but struggle to find time. Cheers for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d \n. These prefixed declarations are handled using autoprefixer. I'd like to keep it that way as it manages which versions are required etc.\n. It's a tough one. I'd like to add something like this into the library but I have concerns over the size of Plyr getting larger and more complex. I recently added some notes and examples and about streaming support but it's something that is new to me at this point. I'm aware that support is all over the place at the moment which makes it even harder. \n. No worries \ud83d\udc4d  Out of interest, what was it :)\n. I'll write a wrapper for this - HTML5 is easy but it'd be good to wrap them all into one API method. \n. Just push version 1.8.8 with a new API method getCurrentTime which will return the currentTime in seconds (as a float). This works with all media types. \n. There is a destroy method but someone has raised a bug with it with YouTube so I will take a look. \ud83d\udc4d \n. The destroy() method is fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Really this is managed on YouTube but I might be able to work something out in a future version. \n. Hmm. Strange one. What browser were you on? \n. Sorry, not done much with Angular so I'll open this one up for help... \n. > I would be in favor of switching to Typescript eventually, but besides the work needed I don't know if @sampotts is.\nI've nothing against it. I've only heard good things! . Are you using a SASS or LESS build system and incorporating the source files into this? You'll need to run autoprefixer if so. It looks like the appearance: none declaration is not prefixed:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr#less--sassscss\n. Awesome! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Sorry, I'm going to need some help with this one. I've not used the module setup a great deal myself. \n. This should be fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Feel free to jump in a with PR. Cheers\n. You're right! I think it's been lost in another merge. I'll re-add it now. Sorry about that. \n. Just pushed a new version with the merge fixed up. Let me know if that's fixed it? \ud83d\udc4d \n. Ta \ud83d\udc4d \n. Maybe have a look at the YouTube embed docs re: ads. Plyr doesn't do anything special to the embeds themselves, it just provides custom controls and a unified API wrapper over the top. The YouTube logo is already visible at the start of playback. Do you mean add a logo to the controls? We could certainly do that for YouTube and Vimeo and link to the page like they do themselves on their own embeds. \n. Without seeing the whole implementation it's going to be hard to work that one out. \n. You'd want to call setup once all the markup you want to call the plugin on, is rendered to the page, yeah.  In this case probably a shown type callback. \n. Oh definitely. I made a custom version of froogaloop (with all the PR bug fixes included) which is loaded when required as part of plyr but this looks even better. \nWill get onto it. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey, I just added this in v1.8.11 - could you take a look :) \n. Grab v1.8.12 as I just fixed a couple of other Vimeo issues \n. This is intended. Tapping in the video on a touch device will show the controls. Much like other players do. \n. Sorry, you're right. That is a bug then. I'll check it out. \n. Just pushed a fix for this in the latest version \ud83d\udc4d \n. Probably needs a config change for autoprefixer for it to work. I've restored my test Nexus 5 to 4.4.4 but it comes with Chrome and I presume you're using \"Dolphin\" (?) or something there?\n. I'm honestly not sure it's possible. I tried a variety of ways and couldn't get it to work hence hiding the caption option. \n. YouTube.com != YouTube Embed \nThey don't expose the same functionality in the embeds as they do in their own players. That's the problem. You can't (or couldn't when I last looked) toggle the captions using their API. You can either set them to be on at the start with cc_load_policy but even that seems to yield mixed results. I can take another look but it wasn't possible with YouTube was added initially. \n. Sorry about this. Will take a look \ud83d\udc4d \n. Sorry about the delay - planning to spend a day this weekend on outstanding issues. \n. This may be fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. I couldn't replicate (and still can't). If you could give me some more info, like a code sample. That would help \ud83d\udc4d \nHere's two working with v2.0.7. I can't see any issues with it:\nhttp://codepen.io/sampotts/pen/mAKjAp\n. I've been trying to debug that page and I'm not sure what's causing it to break. It's obvious the player works in isolation so it's gotta be something to do with the implementation. I notice there's jplayer on the page too which could be an issue. The YouTube API uses postMessage from the iframe to parent so it's also possible that there's some sort of postMessage handler screwing it up. I'd look at that first. \n. Duplicate of #292 - I'll work on this later today if I get time. \n. Damn. I'll take a look. Thanks for reporting \ud83d\udc4d \n. Which version of Chrome  + Android are you using? I'm struggling to replicate on Android 4.4 with latest Chrome. \n. Is this still an issue?. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah for sure, I think someone's requested this before so I'll add it to my list. Should be a quick win \ud83d\udc4d \n. I've added these in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? More info here: shortcuts\nBear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Hmm, which browser? Do you get the same thing on plyr.io ?\n. That was intended. Say I have an input on the page and I click \"F\" while typing something and the video goes full screen? Not really expected behaviour. \nI assume what YouTube are doing is either:\n- Detecting the user has an input capturing DOM element (input, [contenteditable], etc) focused and if so ignoring the request to go fullscreen\n- If the user types into a input, the event is prevented from propagating up the DOM (less good) \nThe first I might be able to do but would still need to detect that there's only 1 player in the document and it's still risky to maintain. Easy if you know the environment it's going in, like YouTube does. \n. Yeah, it would be something like that but I think it'd need to worry about:\n- <input>\n- <textarea>\n- <select> (for skipping to entries)\n- [contenteditable]\nbasically:\njavascript\nif (document.activeElement.matches(/* list of selectors */)) { \n    return; \n}\nI can't think of any other elements that capture input but this would only apply to the0-9,  K, F, C, M shortcuts, the others (space, arrows) would stay focus only as they are used for page navigation. \n. Yeah I'll have a go at this later today and see how I go. I'm just conscious of other elements that may capture keyboard input that we need to worry about.\n. I've just pushed v2.0.2 which has a global option for keyboard shortcuts. Check the docs for a small change in the config  (keyboardShortcut is an object rather than boolean now). It should also fix the issue with having to press F twice. \n. For now it'll just ignore any global key presses when the active element is an <input>, <select> or [contenteditable] but thinking about it - it needs to do <textarea> too. Will add this now.\n. As far as I can see, there's no API or configuration options for Facebook Video Embeds so not sure adding it to Plyr would add any benefit over just embedding it directly.\n. Yeah that would be a good idea! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Merged in v2.0.0 - thanks again for this \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thanks dude \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey, thanks for this. I was just looking through though and thinking it might be best to keep all the settings under a plyr key in the storage and JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() an object. We'll be adding more to the storage as time goes on and it'd be good to keep them tidy. \n. This looks spot on - nice work \ud83d\udc4d \nI'm just in the middle of upgrading the Vimeo API but will merge this with that and release today or tomorrow.\nThanks! \n. Hey, thanks for this - I've manually merged this into some other refactoring work I've been doing. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Awesome. Thanks for this. I can add it in the next release and give you the credit for it of course or a PR (remember LESS + SCSS versions), whichever. \ud83d\udc4d \n. What's the content of .sourceVideo ? Is that the <video> element? All calls to the API must be using the plyr object/instance. See https://github.com/Selz/plyr#getting-the-plyr-instance\n. You're right. There seems to be a bug with restart. Will look into it \ud83d\udc4d \n. Not sure - I'd imagine so yes. It's whatever YouTube decides really given it's just one of their embeds at the end of the day. \n. Fixed \ud83d\udc4d \n. Will take a look at this. I've just upgraded the Vimeo API to their new player.js which may help but I need to look at the destroy() method anyhow. Thanks for reporting \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'm looking at this now along with trying to clean up the object references a little more. Will be re-writing .destroy() as I think it's been forgotten a long the way and should be used by .source() anyway as a lot of the code is replicated. \n. Really sorry - I am working on it. Hoping I can get a fix out for this, plus a load of other issues this weekend. Have you tried the .source() method for updating instead of destroying and starting over?\n. This should be fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Just added this - could you give it a test? \ud83d\udc4d \n. Awesome \ud83d\udc4d  Cheers for the docs update too. \n. Sorry about that - it was my new type checking method at fault. All good in v1.8.11\n. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. This should be fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Hey @joshuapease , I've just pushed v2.0.0 which has a new global method to get all instances on a page. You can now do plyr.get() and it will return an array of all instances on that page as an array that you can look though and call .pause() on each one. \nBear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d \n. Please see v2.0.0 - I've added an .on() API method which should help you. \nBear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Hey, thanks for this - I've manually merged this into some other refactoring work I've been doing. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thanks for taking a look but I'm not sure what this actually fixes? I still get the post message bug when switching sources with these two lines removed. It would not surprise me if the post message bug is a Vimeo thing. It seems calling .unload() makes no difference. Their Fragaloop (or whatever weird name they gave it) API was mega buggy.\n. Well, we had an issue without the media being reset on the container although the solution could have been wrong. \nI'm looking at the .setup() / .destroy() methods now as I've never been 100% happy with them (and destroy is broken currently) - I'll take another look and go from there. I'll also include your other changes. \n. Hey, thanks for this - as per the other PR I've manually merged this into some other refactoring work I've been doing. \ud83d\udc4d \n. This seems to be a Chrome issue by the looks of things:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=593273\n. Closing this and waiting on a Chrome fix \n. No update but it can be safely ignored. v3 will return a Promise for calls to .play() and will be in beta very soon. . Apologies about this. Fix coming soon. I've just been refactoring some other parts too. \n. This should be fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Thanks for this - I was doing a load of refactoring work so I've just manually merged this as part of that. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Duplicate of #218 \nPlease check before raising issues \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yep this should be on the to-do for sure. I think it requires the plugin framework building to allow for other providers to be plugged in to Plyr. \n. Before we do this, I'd like to get the plugin framework/structure nailed... \n. It's an embed so sadly not possible as far as I'm aware. Vimeo handles all loading and preloading, the same as YouTube.\n. Firefox bug is a duplicate of #323 \nQuality request is a duplicate of #218 \nPlease check before rasing issues \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yep - just add the loop attribute:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video\n. The way it works currently is to allow for the <iframe>'d players to be responsive, they use the padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0 method to create a responsive 16:9 container. I'd have to look into some sort of class hook to support 4:3 as it'd be a little tricky. HTML5 videos should work as-is. \n. Vimeo makes life even trickier as they don't technically support hiding the controls so we have a larger container to hide them off screen. \n. You realise this exact CSS is already built in for the embedded players. Plyr uses the same 16:9 assumption so your code won't change anything? . When I get around to it, I'll just be changing the 56.25% value to change the aspect ratio rather than add extra divs etc (certainly not with camel case classnames! \ud83d\ude04). You can't explicitly set the width/height as then it's not responsive. That's the whole point of the 56.25% solution.  \nFor 16/9 it's calculated like so:\n100 / 16 = 6.25 \n6.25 * 9 = 56.25%\nSo, for 4/3 it'd be: \n100 / 4 = 25\n25 * 3 = 75%\nVimeo allows getting the height and width of the video so this could be done dynamically. YouTube doesn't so it would be a little more tricky. The best solution would for it to be dynamic like it is with the HTML5 video. \nI'll get around to it once I've finished the current improvements. Things have calmed down a bit now since my boy's birth so I should get some time after work this week and next weekend to get that lot wrapped up then I can look at this. . I've added an option in v3 for this for the embeds. Feel free to re-open if you have issues \ud83d\udc4d . Pointless -1's @AkgunFatih and @lofcz. \n@systemist That ratio option was for the embedded players as the docs show. It's now automatic based on data from the YouTube and Vimeo APIs so should probably be removed. Do you have an example of a HTML5 player experiencing the issue? . This should be fixed in v2.0.0 - could you give it a go? Bear in mind there were also several breaking changes so check the changelog\n. Thanks for spending time on this. I think I'm going to create some form of plugin system to allow for extra providers like this to be plugged in. I'll come back to this shortly. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'm aware of semver, thanks. I did consider a v2.0.0 but as they are potentially breaking changes and didn't think it warranted a \"major\" release. Sorry if it tripped you up. Always check the changelog. \n. Right, will bump to v2.0.0 \n. Aware of that - if you blindly update without thorough testing though then you've got bigger problems :) \n. Ah sorry for the extra work. Annoyingly NPM doesn't allow me to remove a version. \n. Will do in future - sorry for the inconvenience \ud83d\udc4d \n. Just pushed a fix \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'd have to look into this in more detail as I've not done a lot with components yet (but would like to) \ud83d\udc4d \n. Good idea and should be pretty straight forward with a bit of Regex. I think even the Vimeo new API will parse a URL anyway. I'll give it a go. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. @gurupras has done a PR for this and I've just modified it slightly to support Vimeo also. Will be pushing to master shortly and deploy 2.0.10 \ud83d\udc4d \n. Added in v2.0.10:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/releases/tag/v2.0.10 \ud83d\udc4d \n. Cool. Will add this in, cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey @lastmjs - I've added in getVolume() and isMuted() API methods \ud83d\udc4d \n. Firefox seems to be causing all sorts of issues recently. I'll take a look. Strangely it's fine on Chrome, etc. \n. This seems to be fine now - perhaps it was a Firefox bug before. \n. This should be fixed now \ud83d\udc4d \nInstead of passing an ID to the Vimeo constructor, I'm now passing the HTMLElement instead which seemed to fix it in IE10. Let me know how you go. \n. It should fire now - I worked out a way to get it to fire \ud83d\udc4d \n. I think this is outside of the scope of Plyr? \n. I'll have a look and see if I can come up with something then \ud83d\udc4d \n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . This should be fixed in v2.0.7 - sorry about that \ud83d\udc4d \n. Duplicate of #3 \n. You could start by looking at the .source() API method I'd say?\n. VTT is the web standard for captions. As above you might be best off converting them before hand. \n. Hey mate - thanks for starting this. I'll get on and finish it soon \ud83d\udc4d \n. Good idea - I'll add this to my ToDo. \nFor now you could do this which I know is not ideal...\njavascript\nplayer.on('ready timeupdate pause', function(event) { \n    switch(event.type) {\n        case 'ready':\n            console.log(event.detail.plyr.getDuration());\n            break;\n        case 'timeupdate':\n            console.log(event.detail.plyr.getCurrentTime();\n            break;\n        case 'pause'\n            something();\n            break;\n    }\n});\n. Could you give this another go on the latest version? I'm not seeing it on https://plyr.io? Feel free to re-open if still an issue. \n. I was testing on Microsoft Edge 38.14393.0.0 (latest in Windows 10 as far as I know) \n. Duplicate of #365 \n. @gurupras has done a PR for this. I'll just take a look at it and then merge soon. It probably won't make 2.0.10 but in 2.0.11 for sure. \n. What's the logic behind that? It'd also break HTML5. If the duration is reported to be 10 seconds then how should be 9 seconds? \n. It's not a robust solution is my point though. It might work for this scenario but it's more likely a rounding issue. Plyr just uses the value that is provided through the YouTube API:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plyr.js#L1658\nIt's an open source repository, anyone can contribute with working, tested code. I don't have any problems with that. I don't have time to look at and fix every issue with the plugin. I have a full time job also \ud83d\udc4d \n. OK, so I had a quick dig into this and I suspect the API is at fault here. Here's the demo video on YouTube's main site (showing 3:03 duration):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTqVqk7FSmY\nAnd here's it in the iframe mode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/bTqVqk7FSmY\nNotice it initially shows 3:04 (as reported by the API) and then flicks to 3:03. \nI'll see if the API changes the duration after play too and update the calcs then. I'll raise this as a bug to Google/YouTube. \n. I've raised this as a bug with YouTube:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=8690\nI've also found a fix. I will re-check the duration after play has begun. Not ideal but all we can do with the bug in their API. \n. Pushed a temporary fix (until YouTube fixes the API) in v2.0.9:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/commit/08b4c09b896e1ad27c7a7f974e98831eec294019\n. It doesn't use anything other than standard HTML and CSS (or LESS). If you need any more info one how LESS and SASS work, see their docs:\n- LESS\n- SASS\nAnd if you need more basic help, try Treehouse\n. Just going to leave this for now. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . This should work so is definitely a bug. Will look at fixing it shortly. \n. I have it in my notes to fix this in the next major release (which will be soon). Sorry for the delay. . Everything's critical depending on who you ask \ud83d\udc4d  \nIt's coming. I've been doing a lot of work on v3 which has tons of bug fixes in and improvements. I can't give a firm date but I'm in a testing and optimisation kinda phase at the moment.  . I'm in the testing + fixing phase now so it's mostly done but of course I keep finding things as I go. We're into the Christmas period as well which doesn't help (I'm in the UK at the moment with family). I'm hoping to get it out in January. \nWistia support has been requested a lot and is in the list. I really want to make a plugin framework so that things like Wistia, YouTube and Vimeo can become addons rather than core functionality as not everyone needs them. I'd like to tackle this first as potentially it could speed up development of features etc since I wouldn't have to be doing it all and it'd open it up a little more and cut down the size of JS and CSS required.  . Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . I've already been looking at this, just not got around to getting it into the player. It's pretty straight forward to do. Working on it \ud83d\udc4d \n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . This is because you need to use the correct codecs for HTML5 video:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats\n. This one can be ignored. Or perhaps raise the bug with the YouTube team. We're using their API as-is. \n. It's understandable and I'm the same really. It's just not in my control. I'll have another look but as I say, we just use the API as per their examples :(\n. Strange. Is this the case with all browsers? Do you have any more info on reproducing this? \n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Setting the height with JavaScript isn't something I'm keen on.

I suspect it's a rounding issue. \n. This is related to #362 so will manage both there\n. Thanks - I'll add this into the next release \n. There was a suggestion that we do this through a <track> element with type=\"metadata\" attribute which could be used for this? Then store URLs in a JSON file or something. \n. There were a couple of other ideas in there:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/46\nThe <track> could be another option - seems cleaner to pull the URLs from a file. Perhaps we just use events initially and expand it later. \n. This PR was created against v2 so it'd need to be re-written for v3 before it can be merged. . I'll take a look - thanks for letting me know \n. Thanks Josh. I'll try and fix this issue as soon as I get some time (possibly today/tomorrow). \n. Hey @joshuapease,\nThanks for reporting back. So is there still a bug that needs fixing or are we good? \n. Thanks - will take a look at the PR \n. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d \n. Do you see this on https://plyr.io too? \nWhat browser? \n. Weird. Is it the same for you here? https://plyr.io/#vimeo\n. Closing this for now. If you're still having issues, let me know and re-open. I suspect this is other CSS effecting it. \n. They were the numbers which worked really - from trial and error. The common method of achieving 16:9 ratio for the iframe embeds is with padding-bottom: 56.25% but that would have meant the controls were visible. Vimeo decided that hiding the controls by with a flag is a \"premium\" feature (you need a Pro account) yet YouTube just allows it. It's not ideal both technically and ethically (getting around their limitation) I suppose, but it works. \n. Others have asked about 4:3 support amongst others for Vimeo so I'll work on something for it. \n. It\u2019s actully included in v3. See the issue with info on upgrading. . Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Good suggestion. I'll add this to the list. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Is this any use? https://github.com/Selz/plyr#checking-for-support\n. This is perfect timing! I'm just working on the UI for this. I'll hopefully release it this weekend along with playback speed and quality (for YouTube / Vimeo) \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey mate, I'm having to merge this one manually but I have a question. Is there any reason we don't use the srclang attribute instead of relying on the index in the source? _setCaptionIndex could then be _setCaptionLang or whatever and just pass the matching language? Happy to do the change (since I'm in there) if there wasn't a compelling reason to use index instead? \n. That's true, it's just relying on the source code order seems fragile to me. I'll have a think about it. Maybe it's fine as is. \nSam\n\nOn 2 Oct. 2016, at 4:46 am, DA COSTA Filipe notifications@github.com wrote:\nYeah, I had the same idea but what if you have two tracks with the same language?

Closing this one for now . Yep - contact Google/YouTube if you'd like this removed (there's no flag to hide it with the API) or write some custom LESS/SASS/CSS to make the play button bigger. Up to you. \n\nThis won't be fixed. \n. Which device are you using? Android? Not seeing it on iOS.\n. That responsive mode is a little odd. Doesn't seem to reflect the actual device behaviour at all. It supports inline HTML5 video which the real devices don't (unless there's no audio in iOS10). I wouldn't trust that. \nUse the Xcode device simulator if you want something a little closer to the real thing (about as close as it gets). I'm not seeing the error in that. \n. Glad you like the plugin. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d \nI'll take a look at the \"awful\" rendering. Have you heard of a pull request? This is open source, feel free to contribute. \n. What version of Plyr are you guys using? It's not ideal but Vimeo and YouTube don't currently have full UI support due to an issue with iOS and <iframe>s:\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/183\nI'm looking into whether I can improve this somehow...\n. OK what type of video are are we talking about here? Is it YouTube for everyone? This is why it helps to put as much detail into the issues as possible. I wrote a template to help but people seem incapable of filling it out and instead delete it all and replace it with vague details. \nYouTube and Vimeo are currently not supported so you will get the native embed UI on iOS. This is because, for whatever reason, programmatically playing the video via API does not work and iOS wants a click of the iframe instead. This may have changed in iOS 10 so I'm looking into it. \n. Can you try this again in the latest version? I think it should be fixed. Re-open if not. I've re-enabled YouTube on iPad with iOS10+ as it seems to work ok now. . Will take a look. Thanks for raising this. \n. Thanks for this - about to push a fix for this \n. Fixed this by using z-index: 0 instead. The mask was basically to ensure that border-radius was respected in WebKit. Weird that Mozilla was using their prefixed CSS but not unheard of. The issue now is that the z-index: 0 breaks the YouTube embed and it's just black. I've raised a bug with Chrome for this:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=658573\nDemo: https://jsfiddle.net/Lnjqrt36/\n. I want to make a plugin/module style framework, much like video JS etc. This way people can build their own. I'm not sure when I can start on it though. \n. I can't guarantee it'll happen any time soon. I'm a one man band and I'm having a little baby boy in 6 weeks. I'm still trying to finish other features then I'd need to build the framework I mentioned before. . Awesome. If you're doing a PR, can you do it against the develop branch as otherwise I'll have a mammoth merge. . Not yet. I'm currently working on other features. I will get to this after. Also need to fix bugs first. \nSam\n\nOn 21 Apr 2017, at 4:35 am, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Iglesias notifications@github.com wrote:\nHey @samhibberd @SamPotts, any progress on this?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Looks ok to me on Firefox 49 on OS X. Which version and platform are you on. This issue is likely due to something interfering with window.postMessage that the YouTube API depends on for communication. \n. Maybe contact the plugin author. It will break other embeds. Plyr doesn't do anything different in terms of YouTube embeds. It uses the YouTube API which uses window.postMessage - if your plugin breaks that, it will break other embeds that use the API. \n.

Have you tried with a native HTML5 player in the same browser. Plyr is really just a UI layer over the top of the standard player. If your positive it's Plyr, do you have any errors in the console perhaps (you'll need to set the debug config option to true). \n. Duplicate of #383 - please check before raising existing issues \ud83d\udc4d \n. Please provide some more information for debugging:\n- Browser (e.g. Chrome 54)\n- Platform (e.g. Windows 10, MacOS Sierra)\n- Video type (HTML5, YouTube or Vimeo)\nRemember Plyr is purely an abstraction for all HTML5 and embedded iframe players so most issues like this are caused by the media itself or are a browser related bug. Plyr does not have independent control over Audio and Video. It just uses the browser or 3rd party APIs. \nDoes this issue occur on https://plyr.io ?\n. Seems to be a new browser bug related to autoplay. I'll take a look. Thanks for reporting. I think I may have to pause while the player initialises although I can't see a logic reason why this would be happening... \n. Yep, as above - looks to be a browser autoplay issue. I'll take a look. \n. Good point. I'll fix this in the next major release (soon) with a few other new features as it would be a breaking change. \n. It's already in v3 which I should have out soon (sorry, I keep saying that)\n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @samuelcarreira , v2.0.8 includes a new API method called .isPaused() which should be useful? \ud83d\udc4d  Otherwise you can listen for events, yep! \n. I think I'll merge this one into develop . It was written when v3 wasn't around so it'll need a rewrite first. . Thanks - what would the expected behaviour be if the user sets the volume to 0 on the slider, then mutes, then un-mutes? What value should be restored? \n. What's that based on? Perhaps we should use the config.volume value? \n. config.volume is the volume property of the initial config passed to the player. Setting it to 0 would be a pretty strange case but I guess setting it to max on un-mute makes sense in this case. YouTube doesn't restore the previous value on unmute, they just set it to max. However, the native HTML5 player does not. If you set volume to 0 and then try to unmute nothing happens. It stays muted. On Chrome at least. \nExample:\nhttp://html5demos.com/video\n. I will get this fixed up in the next major release (which I'm very close to working on). Really sorry about the delay. Being a dad hasn't left me much spare time... . I think this is resolved in v3+, I just forgot to close the issue. Let me know if it's still an issue \ud83d\udc4d . That should work. Is 131.vtt hosted in the same directory as that page? \n. That's already the default.

As @gurupras pointed out - I'm in the middle of a large update and want to get that out ideally before any more major work is done .

You have to consider visually impaired users as well as your annoyance by the dotted outline.

The default styles don't include it so you can add/remove this as you want. \n. Twitter video doesn't look like Plyr. Facebook does since their redesign though.  Anyhow, that's the power of CSS. You can make it look how you like. Go for it \ud83d\udc4d \nWith regards to font icons. I'll not being going backwards from SVG. I'd suggest you do some reading:\n- https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/\n- https://www.sitepoint.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg-debate/\nSVGs are designed to be used as icons etc. They are perfect for the job. Using a font is a hack and generally they never look as crisp as SVGs. \nYou can create skins that use SVG too. You have complete control over the HTML for the controls. Have a read of the docs \ud83d\udc4d \nHere's the Twitter player for reference: \n\n. Videojs is hardly the benchmark to go by. If you want to use outdated technology that was never designed for the job, then use videojs or write your own \"old tech\" skin for Plyr. SVG is the future, you just haven't realised it yet :) \nYou can change the CSS for that button. As I say, go for it \ud83d\udc4d \n. OK I get it. You don't like the appearance. Change the CSS then. Done. \n. I could at it to the to-do but I'm not really convinced using Plyr is of benefit here, given you're best off using HTML5 video natively without controls and interacting with it's API as needed. \nI believe iOS will now autoplay videos without audio (which background videos shouldn't have anyway). \n. You were complaining about something so minor that no one out of the 8,000+ watchers has even mentioned. The whole point of providing the CSS and the ability to customise the HTML is so you can make it look how you want. You have your opinion and that's fine but your opinion is no more important than anyone else's. Please understand that. \n. Thanks for that. Will push a new version shortly. \n. 1. This is a custom implementation - I don't have time to write you the CSS for it. \n2. This is a config option but if you're doing 1) then you can ignore the class name that's added to hide the controls. \n3. If you use the default stylesheet, you'll get the default styling\n. Might be worth raising this over at the player.js repo?\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/player.js\n. Can this not be fixed in the Vimeo lib itself? I'd rather not modify their code and then host that modified file in your repo. \n. When you say CND do you mean CDN?\nOK maybe we can build it into the gulp build somehow. I'll take a look. \n. So this is a bug with Safari as opposed to Plyr? \nProbably best to raise it here:\nhttps://webkit.org/reporting-bugs/\n. So are you seeing this on https://plyr.io? \n. If you don't need the crossorigin attribute - i.e. you're not loading webvtt files from another domain, you can remove the attribute. \nI've had a quick look and as no error is thrown in Safari, it's making debugging a little tricky.\n.

I'm not familiar with ionic so not sure how much help I can be there. \n\nThe exception with 'match' on null means the embed id is not set for whatever reason. Do you have any code examples? Do you see this error on https://plyr.io? . Also the Uncaught ReferenceError: ytcfg is not defined(\u2026) is from YouTube unfortunately. Their API and Vimeo's are a bit flaky at best. . I could definitely look into allowing templates like that. \nThe large play button is really styled with CSS and just the centre triangle is an SVG so you might be able to achieve what you're after with just CSS?. This can be achieved using the preload attribute on the <audio> element. Not a feature of Plyr but the underlying HTML5 media elements. \nThis link is for <video> but the same applies:\nhttps://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/04/12/html5-video-preload/. I'm not sure I can help out there given Plyr doesn't effect the underlying HTML5 implementation. Maybe raise it with Apple or WebKit themselves. . I think from looking at the docs , it's saying it never preloads, so it shouldn't download the whole file and should play whatever it has buffered. . Thanks for this \ud83d\udc4d . You don't need to set the height. If you want responsiveness, you should also just use max-width. Not sure you need overflow: hidden either. \nIf you need to set the height and width then you need to do the 16:9 trick:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php. I'd try that method above first or perhaps try using flexbox if you need to set the height. . Should I close this one?. Read the docs. It's an option called controls. .

Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . This could be made into a flag for sure.

In your case it would be player.destroy() - API methods need to be accessed via the instance. . Setup always returns an array (as more than one can be setup at a time) so you need to use:\njavascript\nplayer = plyr.setup()[0];. Cool \ud83d\udc4d . That's not valid JSON, the keys need to be in quotes and those values don't need to be in quotes, only strings do. i.e.:\n<audio data-plyr='{ \"autoplay\": true, \"volume\": 10 }' controls>\n10 is the default for volume anyway btw. \n. Fixed in the readme. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . What browser? Please use the template I provided in future as it helps me fix the issue quicker.

Sorry for the super late response. . I'd be hesitant at this stage as I already have to maintain both SASS and LESS separately so whenever I make a change to the LESS (primary), I have to remember to retro-fit it to the SASS and this would just add to that workload.

In v3 first tap will play, 2nd tap will show controls (including the pause button) which I think is the standard behaviour. . It won't be going into master but can go into develop once I've reviewed and then I'll finish the UI. I've merged to develop and will tidy up as well as finishing the rest of the UI. Cheers for your help \ud83d\udc4d . I'm trying to squeeze it in where I can but have just had a baby boy so will have to see how time goes. I'm making decent progress though.

Some of your changes can be used and some can't. It's up to you if you want to carry on with it. \nThe stumbling block I've hit is that currently plyr has a html option allowing you to specify the markup for controls and with the addition of the settings popover menu, this will require some sort of dynamic aspect to the template (like moustache templates have {{#options}}...{{/options}} to loop through an array. I also noticed your changes will break the html option also. \nAs I say you're welcome to carry on but some of this won't make it in. . Also, some work was done for this here: https://github.com/Selz/plyr/pull/385. Please wait for me to finish the current train of work before doing any more on this... . Also, please try and use the built in type checking object that I've made (i.e. is.function(), etc). That and the standard JavaScript formatting: \n- Using ===\n- Spaces after if and before parenthesis - i.e. if () \n- 4 space tabs (like the rest of the file!) \n- Using array.forEach \nI'd recommend installing jsbeautify and jshint and you'll get shown the issues. I appreciate the effort but future PR's won't be accepted unless you clean it up a bit. . Will manage this in #383 . Vimeo captions are now supported as of v3 \ud83d\udc4d .

Just tested Opera 43.0.2442.1165 - works as expected (video plays). Perhaps check your extensions?. Still not able to replicate this on 2 Mac OS machines and a windows box. . The screenshots would suggest to me you have other issues causing this... . Not something I have control over unfortunately. It's worth raising a bug with Chrome though. They're quick to fix usually. . There was a bug in Chrome 56 where HTML5 poster images seemed to render a black bar above and below some poster images. Seems to be fixed in 57. \nWith the iframe embedded players, to allow them to be responsive a 16:9 aspect ratio is assumed. This is fairly standard practice given that's the most popular aspect ratio. HTML5 video will reflect the video's aspect ratio naturally. \nAs such I'm not sure this is something I'll be able to fix in Plyr. \nFYI: the markdown [] render checkboxes and you just need to add an 'x' in the middle [x]. This would require all players to have an ID. Not a bug as such as this is intended behavior, but an improvement. \n\nOn 14 Mar 2017, at 2:50 am, Marcus Lindfeldt notifications@github.com wrote:\nThe volume control setting saved in localStorage is not bound to a player so when I refresh the page all my players get the same default volume.\nIssue does not already exist\n Issue observed on https://plyr.io\nExpected behaviour\nEach player should have their own localStorage key for volume\nActual behaviour\nAll players share the same localStorage key for volume\nPlayers affected:\nHTML5 Video\n HTML5 Audio\n YouTube\n Vimeo\nSteps to reproduce\nSlide the volume slider to something other than it was on one player\nReload the page and see that all players have that same volume\nRelevant links\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

The problem with Vimeo is that they don't actually support hiding their controls like YouTube does. So the hack to hide them is to make the iframe larger so they are hidden off screen. It would be possible eventually to set the height and width dynamically somehow using the API to get height and width (if it's available on load unlike the lame YouTube API). The current setup assumes 16:9 which is fine for 99.99% of videos out there. \nAre you trying to make the player full window? .

Ah ok I'll manually merge the rest. . Closing this one for now . Sure - we can create a plyr-with-sprite.js - can we remove the spriteOutput in gulp?

There's plans once I seperate out controls into a module. Then I'll inline each SVG rather than the sprite as that makes more sense to me. For now this'll have to wait. If it's a big issue, feel free to use the default CDN implementation. . Closing this one for now but will re-visit later as it should be easier in the new build setup. . That's a copyright issue not an issue with Plyr. Not much I can do about that. \nIf you try and play the video in an iframe you get the same response: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/PJniSb91tvo\n\n. Since Plyr is a wrapper for the HTML5 player it's certainly possible but not built into Plyr. . Is there a link I can look at? Plyr only adds classed to the element you pass to the setup method . Well I can't really help then. As I say, Plyr only adds classes to the element you pass to setup. Without any code to look at, I'm working in the dark. . Yep, they count. It's been raised before. All Plyr does is provide a custom UI for their embeds so while their embeds count plays for all types (they do) then you're all good. \nAutoplay won't work on iOS due to a restriction in Mobile Safari. \nThat error is unrelated and is an error their side. Feel free to raise a bug over at YouTube although I've raised a few and got no where. They're fairly useless. . I'm not sure Plyr is the best use for this but have you tried object-fit in CSS?. You don't need to set those values as strings in an array. Also, hidecontrols is default to true\nTry this\njavascript\nplyr.setup({ \n    autoplay: true, \n    loop: true\n});. Develop is not production ready otherwise it'd be in the master branch. . I use develop as a feature branch for developing.

Ads are in the backlog yeah but not a really high priority. . It should be...\njavascript\nvar ref = plyr.setup()[0];\nI'm working on a new version where setup is a lot easier with proper constructor etc. . Hey @marcobiedermann, \nThis is definitely on the cards. I've never been 100% happy with how the JS is structured. In the develop branch I've rewritten it to use a proper constructor and prototypes but moving to ES6/ES2015 would be even better. Once I've finished getting the bugs ironed out with the changes I'm working on then I'll give you a yell to give me a hand if that's ok? \nCheers. Yeah I've always wanted to make Plyr more modular in that regard. Some may also want custom controls and not use the built in etc. . The good news is, the way I've restructured the plugin in v3.0.0, it should make this a lot easier. . Just to update you.

Hey Julian, did you read the docs? \nplaysinline support is coming in V3. . Yes. playsinline allows the player to remain inline rather than full screen when playing - meaning the custom UI can be used. Without it, the custom UI is pointless as it's hidden when the video is actually playing. \nhttps://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/. https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#browser-support\nAs I said in my first comment: \n\nplaysinline support is coming in V3. \n\nThat's when the custom UI will be supported on iOS.  The other issue I'll have to take a look at. Autoplay also isn't supported on iOS as outlined in the link I provided. It requires user input to play. If the video is muted and playsinline is enabled then it'll work.\nI'm working on getting V3 out as quick as I can but I've had a son since starting on it and time is scarce. It's getting closer though. . I'll make it a little larger so you read it...\nplaysinline support is coming in V3.\nCurrent is V2. \nplaysinline is not supported for YouTube but is for Vimeo through their SDK/API - from memory. YouTube are little slow to make changes to their JS/iframe SDK. It's passed as a parameter when initialising. As I say though - support is coming soon. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . You need to make sure the video is a HTML5 friendly format. Closing this one as it's not really a Plyr issue. . I'll try and make sense of that:\n\nThe WordPress plugin I don't manage or look after. Get in touch with the author for that\nIn regards to \"more support\" - this will come later. I'm not going to go down that road but instead make Plyr work with plugins that would allow this\nAdvertisements has been raised already - not a huge amount of incentive for me to do this as I don't like ads really. Only advertisers do! :) \nSubtitles is already supported - have a read of the docs - doing something like you want has a low use case so I'd not really incorporate that but you can build it yourself pretty easily\nYouTube branding is already reduced to the minimum it can be - unfortunately they still show their logo and loader \nCustom sharing you can build yourself \nLogo can be added with CSS fairly easily \n\nThanks for the feedback but most of what you suggested has such low general appeal that I wouldn't want to bloat Plyr even further for features that wouldn't get much use. . Not sure on those issues as I've not experienced them myself. \n\nAnd Advertisement is the only way to survive for publisher so I think its Important\n\nAs I say, it's on the list but is low priority for me. Once I get the plugin framework ready then someone can build something to put ads in. . Hey mate, all in the docs:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr#quick-setup. Thanks for raising this. IE has always been crap with <button> elements which is what drove many developers to use the horrible <a href=\"javascript:void(null)\"> type stuff or worse <div> and <span>.\nI'd rather not add the extra <span>s in personally to bloat the markup. IE11 is slowly dying off anyway. Currently at 3% usage. I'll put this on the back burner. . I think I'm just going to close this and not worry about it for now. IE11 is slowly dying anyway \ud83d\udc4d . There's currently no way to pass an <iframe> but it's in the backlog as a task. I'd like to do it as it's true progressive enhancement. . Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Whatever's compatible with the <video> element:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video. I'm not really too sure what the question is? Do you mean the Plyr CDN returns a 302? Or your video CDN returns a 302 and you're asking if the <video> element is ok with that?. Well that last URL doesn't load for me...\n\nIt doesn't seem like a Plyr issue so I'd make sure the video is in the correct format, is served with the correct content type and actually loads by itself. As I say, Plyr is just an abstraction for the <video> element so if it doesn't work with that, it'll not work with Plyr. . No, it's not. Good luck fixing it! :-) \n\nOn 11 Oct 2017, at 6:29 pm, An0nymous notifications@github.com wrote:\nsource url can not be played when redirected,I'm not sure if it's Plry.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Yes, the sprite is required by the controls. There's information about it in the docs on the main page. Worth a read \ud83d\udc4d . Closing this one for now then? Let me know if it's still an issue . It's already used for the label on the play button and the iframe title attribute? Not really an issue but glad you sorted it. . Can you fill out the rest of the bug report so I can replicate, debug and fix it? Mainly the OS and browser part.... I'm not sure - I should have left a comment there. I've removed it in V3 and there doesn't seem to be an issue. V3 is coming soon. . Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d .

If anyone has time to look at it, it'd be greatly appreciated. . As above really - use .setVolume(). Cheers. This is actually resolved in v3 as the controls slide out of the element. . You can reference a local version of the SVG sprite instead. See the demo for an example. I'm going to close this one as it's been around a while. Feel free to re-open if you have issues \ud83d\udc4d . I'd have to check whether mute is actually possible on iOS - it probably is so this is an oversight. I know volume control didn't used to work (as it's controlled system-wide). \n\n@in31 I'm still working on it but making good progress. No firm date as yet but I am slowly getting more and more time to spend on it as my son is settling down a bit. . This works on HTML5 and YouTube but I'll have to hide it for Vimeo as their API doesn't support toggling mute and as you can't set volume on an iOS device, nothing works. I've raised it with them...\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/player.js/issues/236#issuecomment-384663183. Pushed a fix in v3.2.4.

Duplicate. \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/512. I'm working as fast as I can on it - hopefully very soon.. Could you be more vague? . Nope - the styling is taken care of with the LESS/CSS so you'd need to build and host your own. Later on once CSS variables are becoming more mainstream then it'd be possible to do using those. I'd prefer to keep the styling in CSS and the JS handling logic as they were designed to do. . It would be a case of editing this hex color:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/less/variables.less#L12\n\n..then you can build the CSS by first running npm install in the root of the project to install the dependencies and then run gulp which will output the CSS to dist/plyr.css . If you don't have NPM then you'll need to install node - you can use homebrew for this on a mac or just install the package on Windows. . Nope - the CDN is the processed LESS so you'll need to host it yourself. Eventually once CSS variables get more support then it'll be possible. . Sorry for the delayed response - the above is correct \ud83d\udc4d . This should be handled in v2.0.16. Safari, being Safari changed how they handle fullscreen elements, of course. .

Will take a look \ud83d\udc4d . It's a limitation of the Vimeo API unfortunately. There's no support for playsinline. YouTube supports it but is coming soon to Plyr once I finish it. . Where can I see the code? Likely some other CSS causing issues. I'm working blind though currently... . Remove the inline styles on the <video> element. That's what's causing your issues. . This will be resolved in v3. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . This is a known issue and is super tricky - in the middle of the scrubber it's pretty accurate but as you go left or right of center the accuracy drops. It's worst at each extreme. The problem is the way the tooltip value is calculated is based on the mouse offset from left to right but the range doesn't quite work like that as the edge of the handle for the range input is only inline with the edge of the track rather than the center of the handle being in the centre of the end of the track.  I'll look into it but as I say, it's a tricky one to do. . This will be removed in favour of just a ready event in v3.

This is coming in v3 (which is unfinished and currently in develop) so I'll close this for now but thanks for your time on it \ud83d\udc4d . Sure - will add it in then \ud83d\udc4d . Argh, Vimeo really is crap. I think it might be time to drop support. There's no way to hide their controls via the API so we had a kinda hack to hide them off screen (iframe was 200% height and then centered in the viewport) but clearly that's no longer working. Either they found it on someone's site or they discovered Plyr. A really downer. \nI think the options are either we drop support or keep it but using their controls which would offer an inconsistent experience and frankly not as good looking. \nIt's a shame as they have some good quality videos but when it comes to embedding that content on your own website, YouTube far exceeds them and even they have their downsides. . Is it possible to turn them off for everyone? I was planning to just use their \"native\" controls for now and add an option to the config to turn on the custom controls. . Hey @danaburger , it's always been their intention to display their controls on embedded videos. I just took advantage of a loophole that allowed them to be hidden. A loophole they've now closed unfortunately. . So the usual way to display an iframe in 16:9 is to sit it in an container with 0 height and padding bottom of 56.25% (to create 16:9) and then make the  absolute positioned and 100% height/width. With Vimeo, I added an extra div in between which was set to 200% height and then positioned in the center of the outer div using a transform. This kept the responsive functionality but to Vimeo the container was really tall so their controls would sit outside the of the 16:9 container of course, hidden off screen. They've since forced their own 16:9 container within the embeds so my loophole/hack no longer works. I guess it was only going to last so long anyway.  . Obviously not something they'd like or support but I guess they have to make money somehow without resorting to ads. . Great find @jonnitto! I wonder how long before they close that loophole though \ud83d\ude14\nI think I can see why this is happening now - as their API is bound to the iframe and then the source changes, all events/bindings are lost perhaps? \nI'm going to try initialising the Vimeo API with an <iframe> that I create first and see if that helps. I'm working in develop currently but I'll retro-fit it to master so those having issues currently at least have a solution. I wanted to offer this originally anyway as a true progressively enhanced solution but I think that'll wait for a later version. \nI'm not sure if I'll get time tonight (it's 10pm Friday) but definitely at some point tomorrow. Will report back. . Looks like the iframe solution works \ud83d\udc4d I've got it working in develop (which is still work in progress) but will port the changes over to master. \nNice find fellas. . I've just pushed v2.0.17 with the iframe fix in. Let me know if you find any issues. There's some other small bug fixes in there too: \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/releases/tag/v2.0.17. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . I'm going to be changing all the data attribute namespacing in v3 so everything is under data-plyr-x so this won't be an issue any longer. . Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Cheers - will retrofit this to develop . Closing this as it's fixed via the <iframe> solution. Thanks for the work though \ud83d\udc4d . Cheers mate! \ud83d\udc4d . Hey, the google-cast.js file can probably go in the /plugins folder? Eventually I'll work out a way to include/exclude these without breaking the core functionality.\nRemember to use Prettier and ESLint plugins if you have them. Thanks. I can assist with any UI parts if there's any left when the time comes. . I\u2019ll need to take another look but it\u2019s showing a load of tasks as incomplete? . That\u2019d be good.

It's coming in v3 - which is getting closer every day. I've been spending more and more time on it. \nFor Vimeo it will be automatic as they expose API methods that mean I can grab the video dimensions and then calculate the ratio to set the frame and inner container to. YouTube I think forces 16:9 but I've added a config option anyway so this can be used if preferred. \nI'll let you know when this is ready for testing. .

Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . This is being fixed in v3 (working on it at the moment). It's one of the last big pieces of v3 work before it can be beta tested. The detection of touch devices has always been a bit flaky so I'm going to look at trying to listen for mouse vs touch events. The issue is iOS will sometimes fire mousemove even though it has no mouse, etc. It's a real pain. . Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . This will be fixed in v3. The only downer is that the volume controls will briefly show as of course I need to check if the media has audio tracks and that can only be done after the loadeddata event has occurred. I assume that most video will have audio so the default is for them to be shown. In the majority of cases loadeddata fires pretty quickly anyway.   .

I think what @vibhi19 is referring to is setting up Plyr on an already loaded embed <iframe>. It's something I've considered doing but won't be part of v3.

I have a personal life as well as maintaining Plyr \ud83d\udc4d \nFor any discussion, use the Slack channel rather than GitHub issues: \nhttp://bit.ly/plyr-slack. v3 is a massive re-write and is way better. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . It's not something that needs to be added to plyr. You can handle deferring the load in your own JS however you like - either by loading the script to initialise the player with the defer attribute or just call setup on the load event on window or DOMContentLoaded on the document. \nNeither will make a huge difference to performance though.. Should I state the obvious fix? . Yeah, you need to use web VTT as per docs. .

It might be worth raising your concerns with YouTube directly but I don\u2019t fancy your chances.

Just for reference, any PRs against v2 probably won't get merged as v3 is imminent. Playlists will be visited in v3. Feel free to work from the develop branch. . This is a network error on your side. Plyr is merely an abstraction/wrapper for the native HTML5 player so isn't the cause of this. . Even with origin set, the error is present. It\u2019s a YouTube bug but good luck getting them to fix it. They just close bugs I\u2019ve raised and say it\u2019s intended. Like display incorrect duration. It\u2019s not the best API/SDK.\nLet me know how you go with raising it with them.... No, it\u2019s not violating the terms of service. The player had been like this for several years now. Other players do exactly the same thing too. \nWith regards to the console message, people raise it all the time. At the end of the day, it\u2019s thrown by the YouTube SDK not Plyr. It doesn\u2019t effect playback, it just seems to needlessly worry developers. The message can be ignored.

Sorry, will check the bit.ly link. \nYep, the new version uses ES6 which IE obviously doesn\u2019t support so the polyfills are required if you need to support IE. Will add a section on polyfilling. It\u2019s going to be the case with most libs these days. . I've been working a lot with ES6 recently and haven't really found an ideal solution to this. polyfill.io means relying on a third party which is never ideal and babel-polyfill / core-js massively bloat the bundle for 95% of users who don't need the polyfills. I also found babel-polyfill included a fair bit I didn't need even with it set up correctly to apparently include all that's required rather than everything. My plan, as lazy as it sounds, was to let the end users decide since inevitably you're going to have to polyfill for other libs as ES6 and newer become more prevalent. I could probably do a polyfilled bundle somehow with gulp/rollup but it was like 50k gzipped when I tried which is insane. \nI can probably roll back fetch to use XHR as I'm not sure I need fetch as such anyway. Polyfill.io does include a polyfill but it's 7k and as I say, I'll work on replacing it with XHR. . Slack link updated ... it's https://bit.ly/plyr-slack \ud83d\udc4d . I'll document the polyfills but it's pretty common practice now with ES6. As I mentioned above, you'll notice the demo uses polyfill.io... . OK, just pushed 3.0.0-beta.12 with:\n\nFetch removed in favour of XHR. One less polyfill. Didn't really need fetch anyway. \nAdded more notes about polyfilling\nAdded backwards compatibility for <div> embed placeholders\n\nNext up is to fix captions on IE11 and the custom controls. \nFor anyone that wants the easy polyfill option...\nhtml\n<script src=\"https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=es6,Array.prototype.includes,CustomEvent\"></script>\nI'll make a more comprehensive list of the polyfill features required at some point before release but that string works well for now. \n@dacostafilipe I will look at making a polyfilled built JS option. This should be possible. \n@aolko Babel can handle polyfills and that's probably what I'll end up using for the polyfilled build. The problem seems to be most of their polyfills are huge. It at least doubled the size of Plyr when I tried it. Bit of a shame when ~90% of users won't need most of the polyfills. . Hey, \nI've just pushed v3.0.0-beta.13 which contains:\n\nA fix for custom controls\nCompletely rewritten fullscreen class - iOS native fullscreen is WIP since playsinline makes it a little more tricky\nA bug fix from @friday \n\nWill look at IE11 captions next. \nCheers \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah I will work out a build that includes polyfills. I'll probably try and use core-js and include just the polyfills that are needed or use babel-polyfill and babel-preset-env to try and limit the polyfills. I'll work something out... . Just pushed v3.0.0-beta.14 which contains:\n\nFix for pause button not showing while playing\nAdded polyfilled build (need to document) as plyr.polyfilled.js - this is 20kb (gzipped!) larger than the base build so I'd warn that it's only really suitable for standalone players as really you'd want to manage polyfills globally\nAdded unminified builds to /dist - minified is now plyr.min.js (need to document). CDN builds remain minified and use the same filename (plyr.js)\n\nWill look at IE11 captions today or tomorrow. . Oh, thanks to @friday for the work on the unminified builds \ud83d\udc4d . This last solution seems like a good one. Good find! \ud83d\udc4d I'll give it a go. The new font is really only for use in the demo as that's all it's licensed for anyway. . @friday I included your typeface change. I actually set it as a global declaration on the whole player as we present timestamps in a few spots and I actually preferred now the numerics looked with it. \n3.0.0-beta.18 contained several fixes for issues with .destroy() leaving event bindings on the document causing issues (as you can imagine). Also fixes for trying to set menus when there's no menus in the controls and some improvements to the ad plugin from @friday and @gehaktmolen \ud83d\udc4d \n3.0.0-beta.19 contains the above fix for the timestamps font spacing, thanks to @friday. . I think so. Closing all the tickets related to bugs fixed in v3 might take me a while. I think I'll push current master to a v2 branch and then merge beta to master tomorrow night and prepare for the backlash \ud83d\ude02. @Maqsyo Try 3.0.0-beta.20 - I found in some cases I had to delay the garbage collection of old elements.. Thanks for all your feedback and help. I'm gonna close this for now but if you find anything, please don't hesitate to grab me in Slack or raise an issue if need be! \ud83d\udc4d . Autoplay on is only supported if the video either has no audio tracks or has the muted attribute on a mobile device (rightfully so, as most of the time it's a pain in the arse). This isn't something I have control over but is a browser decision. . I presume you tried adding playsinline with v3? Using the attribute fixes many styling issues but also has a trade off that fullscreen is a little harder to work with - you end up with full-window instead. Still investigating the options there. . It's probably a genuine issue by the sounds of it. I could take a look. \nSome are already using v3 in production but I could understand your hesitance. . I've added a new option in v3 which will allow you to combine playsinline and the native fullscreen. It's called iosNative under the fullscreen property and is a boolean of course - default is false (to allow custom controls). I'll add it to the docs shortly but in my testing it seems to work well. . iOS 9? Yeah, probably not going to support that far back. < 5% on iOS 9 from what I can see. I'm just using the standard browser APIs and a fallback if they aren't present. . Yeah probably a CSS issue then - let me know what you find and I can see if I can put something into the core CSS if it makes sense. . Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . I think this should be fixed now. I've updated the main property as suggested. . It's really weird. IE11 should support VTT files and I swear it did in testing before. I'll keep digging. Thanks for taking a look \ud83d\udc4d . Done some more digging and it appears IE11 doesn't seem to like loading captions from a remote URL for whatever reason. Using a relative URL like you've done seems to work fine for me too. I'm thinking of moving v3 to master and using GitHub Pages to host plyr.io. Maybe that'll help solve it, at least for the demo/docs site. . Looks like IE11 never worked with CORS VTT:\n\nhttps://github.com/videojs/video.js/issues/2073\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/8832169/\n\nI'm not going to restore all that code to load the captions with AJAX and the extra logic so might just add a note in the docs about it. IE11 numbers are dropping anyhow - currently 2.78% and my theory is often the longer developers support these turd browsers, the longer they stay around. . That looks good. We had something similar before. \nI tried even downloading the captions with AJAX and then updating the src to be a base64 encoded data URI. Still nothing. Is there anything this browser supports? Apparently it's undocumented but IE11 only supports data URIs on:\n\n<object> (images only)\n<img>\n<input type=\"image\"> \n<a> \nand CSS declarations that accept a URL, e.g. background, background-image, etc\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1207190/embedding-base64-images. Oh man, IE6 \ud83e\udd15 I had to support that on a bank website for years purely because senior execs were forced to use it. So. Many. Hacks. \nI think I have IE11 working using a blob instead\n```javascript\n// Fix IE\nif (browser.isIE && window.URL) {\n    const elements = this.media.querySelectorAll('track');\nArray.from(elements).forEach(track => {\n    const src = track.getAttribute('src');\n    const href = utils.parseUrl(src);\n\n    if (href.hostname !== window.location.href.hostname && [\n        'http:',\n        'https:',\n    ].includes(href.protocol)) {\n        utils\n            .fetch(src, 'blob')\n            .then(blob => {\n                track.setAttribute('src', window.URL.createObjectURL(blob));\n            })\n            .catch(() => {\n                utils.removeElement(track);\n            });\n    }\n});\n\n}\n``. Thanks. This should be fixed in the latest version \ud83d\udc4d . Yep - check the docs forcontrols`. You can show both current time and duration together. . This should be sorted in 3.0.0-beta.11 . Cheers for your help \ud83d\udc4d . Wouldn't it be better to do something like this?\njavascript\nthis instanceof window.Plyr ? this : null. Ah, just realised I should have just used the helper at the top of the file utils.is.plyr(this) ? this : null. Can you try v3.0.0-beta.11 ? I just pushed with a change to use utils.is.plyr() instead as it follows the standard to use the is helper. . Awesome. Thanks for your help with it \ud83d\udc4d . Sure. Will do. Bear in mind that v3 is coming very soon (it's on NPM already) so will need to update when that goes to master? . Ah that should be fixed now but setup has been removed in favour of a proper constructor.... It's still in testing and the feedback has been a little slow really. I'll badger people about it. It's pretty close though I think. \nYeah that's the change for the player. Previously the setup function would always return an array and now it returns a single instance. Also some of the config options have changed but not sure if that would effect your wrapper. . Are you using v3/beta? https://plyr.io / https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/tree/beta ?\nIf so you can do player.speed = 1.5.. In that case - use the beta/v3 and let me know any feedback as per: \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/766. We could certainly add the config option for this. I'll add it to the queue. . Cheers mate! \ud83d\udc4d . https://godaddy.com/contact-us.aspx \ud83d\udc4d . It\u2019s a HTML5 video player. There\u2019s a bit of a hint in the name. Also, \u201chuge error\u201d means nothing to me. . Not really. It's a HTML5 media player. The elements only exist in HTML5 therefore it won't work with XHTML.  . ^ This. . Worth a read:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5. This is a weird once since all Plyr does is bubble the media elements events (usually they don't bubble). . Thanks Arthur, I\u2019ll take a look today. \nSam\n\nOn 10 Feb 2018, at 9:16 am, Arthur notifications@github.com wrote:\nI confirmed this on https://plyr.io/beta after setting the source to a YouTube video.\nplayer.source = {type: 'video', sources: [{src: 'OTHHeIAYfuU', provider: 'youtube'}]}\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

Good idea \ud83d\udc4d . Please be less vague. That's exactly how the demo works (which works). You either have an issue with the MIME type or something else network related. . It looks the same to me on here:\nhttps://plyr.io/beta/#youtube\n\nAnd then playing the logo disappears as expected? \n. Very strange. Must be a language/location thing. Someone else also raised this recently... . The problem here is with YouTube you request the quality you'd like but you might not necessarily get that quality setting. I make a note of it here:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/tree/beta#youtube-only\nA bit lame but that's their API :( . @malinushj I actually fire that event and handle the requesting so could build that into Plyr itself. It's a shame the YouTube API works that way. I'd raise a bug but every time I've done that they just close issues and say it's meant to be that way (broken!) \ud83d\ude02\nI could actually have timeout from quality requested to quality change and if nothings happened then I manually re-load like you've done? . I've raised a bug but it's pretty pointless I think. They'll just say \"that's how it's meant to work\" effectively. https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/74463069\nTo me it seems like poor design. Basically they've said \"We've created this API method that may or may not work depending on how lucky you are\". They should call it .maybeSetQualityPrettyPlease(). \nWe'll see. . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Can you try again? I think this is fixed in v3. Will close for now but feel free to re-open if it's still an issue \ud83d\udc4d . I think in this case maybe using a 0 setTimeout would work as it would execute \"async\" at the end of the current execution stack wouldn't it? That's how I've always remembered a zero timeout to work. It does seem to fix it in this instance anyway...\njavascript\nwindow.setTimeout(() => {\n    utils.dispatchEvent.call(this, this.media, 'ready');\n}, 0);. I've used the above to solve it for now in v3.0.0-beta.16. Not ideal I know but unless we can come up with something better, it'll work for now. I can always add the callback too but I've never really been a fan of those callbacks in the options anyway. I'd rather any external code used events and then preventDefault if the default behaviour wasn't desired. . All good \ud83d\udc4d . Could I suggest you give v3 a try? Head over to the beta branch for more info. . I\u2019m not sure what to say. Full screen works perfectly fine on the demo site https://plyr.io/beta. I\u2019d suggest you have issues elsewhere unrelated to the plugin. Good luck with it. . I'll just retrofit this one as it's easier . I've moved the check to the setXMenu methods themselves incase they get called from elsewhere. Will push shortly. . Can you try v3? . The beta branch or if you use NPM you can get it on there also. \nSam\n\nOn 4 Mar 2018, at 1:53 am, electroheadfx notifications@github.com wrote:\nhey sorry sampotts, where is the v3?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Closing this one as I think it's fixed but feel free to re-open if not solved in v3 \ud83d\udc4d . Yep, .setup() was removed in favour of a proper class and one to one relationship with element vs instance. It was getting a little messy with allowing whatever in and then spitting out an array with one or many instances back. This way is cleaner and as you've found out if a developer wants to setup multiple players it's as easy as...\n\njavascript\nconst players = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.js-player')).map(player => new Plyr(player));\nThe example is just to show a NodeList is accepted as a value. It doesn't necessarily make it the best for any scenario. It's really because I added support for passing jQuery objects which are always an array of elements as I'm sure you know. \nI'll update the docs to make this a little clearer. . Are these changes all good now @friday / @gehaktmolen ?. Hey @gehaktmolen , with uBlock Origin (ad blocker) I get an Uncaught (in promise) undefined error in the console. Any ideas?. I've made some other tweaks so maybe do a pull first \ud83d\udc4d . Can you verify this is still an issue with v3 and if so then raise another PR for that? Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . @card This should be fixed now \ud83d\udc4d . It does \ud83d\ude44. OK but it does on https://plyr.io so you have a problem elsewhere.... Use the latest version - v3.1.0. If you're using a plugin/wrapper by someone else (like Vue, React, etc) then you need to contact the author to get them to upgrade... . Do you see the same on https://plyr.io ?. Thanks for that. I'll get a fix into the next release (hopefully tomorrow). . This should actually be resolved now in v3.2.0 . Translated:\n\nThe tooltip does not work using iframe in ie11, I did tests in chrome, opera, firefox and had no problem.\nBy moving the mouse over the progress bar the pre-view time is totally in the direct bar but the time remains normal.\nUntil then I do not know where the problem comes from, I think the problem is coming from pageXOffset but I can not verify.\n\nWill take a look. . Events like progress are merely re-dispatched and set to bubble (media events don't by default) so if it fires twice, that's because it's only fired twice on the underlying media element. Are you on a fast connection or have the file cached? The spec says:\n\nWhile the load is not suspended (see below), every 350ms (\u00b1200ms) or for every byte received, whichever is least frequent, queue a task to fire a simple event named progress at the element.\n\nAnyway, you should try v3 as it's way better than v2. I'm about to merge to master but you can grab it from the beta branch or npm. \nI can add a progress getter on the instance which I guess would return between 0 and 1 (for percentage). . As above, read the docs . It's do-able but you need to ensure that you add the allowfullscreen attribute to the iframe. Will look at this. For iOS though you'd need to also force the native fullscreen rather than use the \"full window\" which means you'd lose the custom controls. It's all a bit of a trade off. . Yeah I said \"it's do-able\" implying it doesn't support it now but it could be done with the trade offs I outlined. . You're probably right but there were loads of changes in v3 which included supporting playsinline which enabled custom controls on iOS. I'll look at fixing it soon. . Well not everyone wants playsinline. So you can add the attribute? \n\nOn 25 Mar 2018, at 11:44 am, thexeos notifications@github.com wrote:\nI've also noticed that playsinline is not getting added on iPad.

Sorry for the abrupt answer. Basically all browsers have capacity to allow you to style the \"lower fill\" of an <input type=\"range\"> slider. Edge even allows you to style both sides! WebKit however is missing this, for whatever reason. In v2 I dealt with this by displaying a <progress> behind the slider but always felt it was a hack and then discovered it was possible to use JS + CSS variables (since WebKit supported them ages ago) to set the values of a background gradient instead. This is the JavaScript part of it:\n\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/controls.js#L15 . Pushed a fix - will release a new version shortly \ud83d\udc4d .

I settled on 200% as otherwise the Vimeo captions start appearing in the video and I'm not sure how to turn off their rendering. \n\nHere's 400%, 300% is very similar. Presumably because they base font size on the viewport size. \n\n. Will try 240 and see if that helps with your screen size? . Can you reference the source (/src) files? It's a little easier than the built (/dist) files in future. I'll take a look though. . I think we can remove the .toFixed() completely?. Which browser and you have autoplay enabled? For me on Chrome 65 on https://plyr.io if I run player.stop() in the console, it just stops playback. \nBTW the issue template helps me to work out these things. That's why I created it (and you deleted it \ud83e\udd14). All good \ud83d\udc4d . Found a fix and will push asap \ud83d\udc4d . Can you guys give v3.0.4 a go? I've put a fix in there. OK try v3.0.6 but instead of event.preventDefault() you'll need to return false. I tried to get to event.preventDefault() working but failed. I will leave that for another day as it's late. I'll keep looking though. . Feel free to debug and PR a fix then \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah I noticed that - have pushed a fix. I'm working on the controls now - touch events are a monumental pain in the ass. Essential the requirements are hide after x seconds unless: \n\nControls are hovered on a mouse device\nControls are pressed on a touch or mouse device \nLoads of other scenarios I've forgotten\n\nIt doesn't help that iOS just fires all the touch events and mouse events... . It's really hard to work out what's changed from that lot. \nWith the seek tooltip, I'd planned to just hide it on touch devices but could look at those changes you've done. \nI can see the direction but another thing we need to support is both mouse and touch support. I think I have it fixed but seeing a weird bug with Safari after seeking it's impossible to press any other buttons in the controls and the progress container seems to get all the click events. It's so weird.  . I've pushed my changes but will continue to work on a fix for after seeking. If you could take a look that'd be good. \nBTW it's best to fork the repo, make your changes (run gulp to build + watch) and then commit and PR when you're done.  . I think I'll push 3.0.4 for now as there's other fixes in there. Will fix the seeking issue and push 3.0.5 asap. . If you need a hand, feel free to grab me in the Slack . Will update but try https://bit.ly/plyr-chat. I'll close this for now as I think it's just the issue of the controls acting odd after a seek . This should be fixed in v3.0.5. What's your markup for the iframe? . Did you read the docs at all? Might be a start \ud83d\udc4d \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr#youtube-embed\nhtml\n<div class=\"plyr__video-embed\" id=\"player\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTqVqk7FSmY?origin=https://plyr.io&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1\" allowfullscreen allowtransparency allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe>\n</div>\nor \nhtml\n<div id=\"player\" data-plyr-provider=\"youtube\" data-plyr-embed-id=\"bTqVqk7FSmY\"></div>. You'll be waiting a long time for an event that doesn't exist. Read the docs \ud83d\udc4d . Sorry this must be a regression somewhere. Should be a quick fix. . Try this:\njavascript\nvar api = new Plyr(element, {\n    muted: true\n});\napi.on('ready', () => { \n    api.pause();\n});. This should be fixed in the latest version \ud83d\udc4d . They won't if you've previously set the muted state and have it in local storage. Obviously the users settings overwrite the defaults. Try clearing your plyr local storage key. . Did that work? :) . I'd say that's probably a bug with Vimeo's API, player.js?. Sure - will do this shortly . Fixed in v3.0.8 \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for this. I'll take a look... . Pushed v3.0.7 which has a fix for this... . Try \n```javascript\nconst player = new Plyr('#player');\nplayer.on('ready', () => { \n    player.toggleControls(false); \n});\n``. Well you'll have to work it out then. You need to run.toggleControls(false)on each instance. Good luck with it \ud83d\udc4d . You might as well use.forEach()since you're usingArray.from()` to convert it to an array anyway.\n```javascript\nconst options = {\n    settings: ['captions', 'quality', 'speed'],\n    volume: 0.5\n};\n$(document).on(\"turbolinks:load\", () => {\n    const players = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.plyr-player')).map(player => new Plyr(player, options));\nplayers.forEach(player => { \n    player.on('ready', () => {\n        player.toggleControls(false);\n    });\n});\n\n});\n```. Ah I can see now what the issue is. May I ask though, how is a user meant to start playback if there's no controls to do so? . Very odd. I\u2019ve not seen that before on Chrome 64/65/66 on MacOS. It\u2019s just a simple rotation so I guess you\u2019d have issues in other places too. . Sounds like a bug with Chrome. Will raise it with them if I can reproduce but this is the first I\u2019ve seen that issue. . Firefox seems to flicker the poster image regardless of if the transition or drop shadow are there. Even stranger. Once played it's fine. \nReally hard working around the browser bugs sometimes. I still can't replicate the original Chrome issue though. . I'll dig out my MacBook as that's still clinging on to El Capitan and give it a try then. . I could wrap it in a <span> for now. Not too much of an issue. . Are you still seeing this? I've not been able to replicate again. If you can then report back and I'll take another look. . Pushed v3.0.7 which has a fix for this.... Sorry yeah there are issues with the muted and volume options. Looking into it. . Can you try again? I think this is fixed in v3.0.11. You need to sign up as a publisher with vi.ai and enter your ID but if you don't have that set it won't break anything. I think you have issues elsewhere based on your other issue. . Fixed in v3.0.9. P.S. Don't need to prefix issues with v3 etc anymore \ud83d\udc4d . This is a duplicate of #812 - please check before raising new issues. I'll look into this ASAP. . All good mate \ud83d\udc4d . I'm not sure what you mean? . Yep can do this. The change in v3 was to use the native pseudo class :fullscreen instead but it'd be easy enough to add a class to extend that. . On second thoughts, can you not use the CSS pseudo class :fullscreen too? The only downer is it's prefixed of course... \ncss\n.plyr:fullscreen, \n.plyr:-webkit-full-screen,\n.plyr:-moz-full-screen,\n.plyr:-ms-fullscreen {\n    // Your styles...\n}\nBear in mind you may need to specify them as seperate declarations as some browsers get funny about combined selectors for pseudo classes. . See my comment above ^. Closing this. Please use the CSS selector above. . I'm working on the HTML5 quality selection right now. I'm not sure how I'd do the Vimeo one without signing up for a Vimeo Pro account?. I'm not sure this is something I'd want to include in the core code? It's something you'd want to manage outside of it. Also, you should use the muted setter instead of setting volume. . Ah this looks like a regression. I've not seen ant of these come through on the demo site's Sentry but I'll get these fixed up. . Are you guys using the latest version? . Well the root cause is the listeners still firing. I could add the null checking but that\u2019s not really going to solve the issue. The listeners would still fire and they are only bound initially if the UI is supported anyway. I\u2019ll take another look. . It's been raised before. It's a tricky one though due to the responsive requirement. I'll keep looking into it though and see what I can do.... . Hey @rklabal , could you check the latest version? I've pushed a fix which should mean that non standard aspect ratios will now be catered for in fullscreen. . It's not supported currently with passing custom HTML as outlined here:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/controls.md#limitations\n\nCurrently the settings menus are not supported with custom controls HTML\n\nIf you want to use the built-in controls, then simply add settings to your array for the controls option. Or omit it completely and use the defaults (which includes settings).. Can you raise this with vue-plyr please. I think it needs to be updated to v3. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d . Do you mean event or listener ? . My preference would be to, you know, fix it \ud83d\udc4d . This is fixed in v3.1.0 . Isn't this a duplicate of your other issue? . Ahh ok cool \ud83d\udc4d I've found the cause and both are related. Will push it to master shortly. . This is fixed in v3.1.0. The YouTube API doesn't seem to support playback rate changes on Android for some reason so a call to getAvailablePlaybackRates() will return just the 1x speed. . I'm not a big fan of the listeners object and my preference would be to just rely on events with event.preventDefault() where required as this whole proxy thing is a pain to maintain. I'd also prefer to not have to catch and re-throw events but if I remove them, people whine and I think they have their uses :) The problem is the events on media elements such as <video> and <audio> don't bubble by default so I have to catch and re-throw them... . Isn't it possible to namespace events using a . and the event type will appear the same if you listened for play for example and we fire play.plyr or something. That's how bootstrap does it with jQuery but not sure if it's possible with good old fashioned JavaScript. . What I don't get though, is media events don't bubble so you should only get events that Plyr has fired. For example:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/play\n\nBubbles: No \n\nUnless I'm completely missing something :) . I'll still take a look and see if I can resolve this another way. . I'll leave it open as a reminder. Awesome cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Please upgrade to v3. . This should be resolved in v3.2.0 but please let me know if not \ud83d\udc4d . Does this work ok with Vimeo and YouTube? That's my only worry as they respond with the options later on. YouTube doesn't give quality options until you play for example. . It's so complex these days \ud83d\ude22. I think I have this sorted - just had to add it to the other menu methods . This should be resolved in v3.2.0 but please let me know if not \ud83d\udc4d . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Are you using v3? Do you see this on https://plyr.io ?. This should be resolved in v3.2.0 \ud83d\udc4d . Is there a way to detect HLS is being used? Sorry I need to play with HLS and Shaka etc a little more really. . I've renamed the option to resetOnEnd in v3.3.0 and it now applies to all media types. I've created a poster container much like @friday 's suggestion and the poster setter will now update both. This is also used for Vimeo and YouTube so the behaviour is consistent. . I suspect .stop() could just do the same thing - pause and restart effectively. I'll make that change and see?. Try v3.3.5! . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . This should be resolved in v3.2.0 \ud83d\udc4d . I can't reproduce this on either Chrome or Firefox as stated.\nAs a side note there's a playing getter on the Plyr.. OK just seen it's with YouTube. \nThis is why I have the default issue template. I'm half tempted to auto close any issue not using the template. . Seems to also effect Vimeo. I'll look into it. It's a bit of a pain they do that. . What size screen? I'm not sure we can do a lot about this as Vimeo doesn't let you disable their caption rendering via their API. . It's because we have to do some magic to hide the Vimeo controls which means Vimeo thinks the window is large and renders the captions to match. It's pretty painful to work with. . This should be resolved in v3.2.0 \ud83d\udc4d Feel free to re-open if not. . This is a tricky one. I need to take another look as Vimeo doesn't seem to allow you to turn off their rendering of the captions without them also not being available via the API if I remember correctly. The offset hack to hide the controls also means the captions get larger (they must use some sort of responsive type mechanism) so it's a fine balance. I'll take another look as this is a good example to test with. . I'm not massively familiar with require but sounds like you have your solution? If so, can you please close this one. . Thanks! \nIt's been raised already. Closing this one. Feel free to subscribe to the other. . Will look at this tonight \ud83d\udc4d Fullscreen API is dogs breakfast across the browsers. . Hey @friday, this should be resolved now. Feel free to re-open if not... . Hmm, on Chrome 66 I don't get it ... \n\n. Chrome 65 windows... \n\n. Ah damn, I don't have El Capitan any more. Literally upgraded the only machine I had running it last night. I'll see if I can find another way to test. Should setup a VM I guess. \nIt must be something to do with the event as that sets the pressed state of the toggle button. . Ahh Karabiner? I saw they'd changed it to Karabiner Elements that was a little odd... I use it to customize home and end keys to act like a PC. \nThe event should trigger that aria state change which effects the UI. Something must be going wrong with that. . Are you still seeing this? It seems to work ok. We should probably handle the error though... . Should be resolved now. \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah, it's pretty crazy. I think I've re-written it a few times but will take a look. . I'd say this is an issue outside of Plyr. We have no checks for file extension... . Duplicate of https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/854. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d Glad you didn't opt for the usual 999999999999 \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks mate \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . Not a Plyr issue. I'm not sure how we can disable that. . Hmm, this is actually a bug with player.js, the Vimeo API. A call to getDuration() on the demo video for example returns an int of 62 yet the error when you seek states Error: Seconds must be a positive number less than the duration of the video (61.867) hence the issue (we try and seek to 62). I guess it could easily just caught and ignored in the promise. . YouTube are crap at this too oddly. I have to re-request the duration after playback begins to get the true duration. Maybe I'll give that a go for Vimeo too. . Yep. Sure enough if you get the duration after playback has begun, you get the correct value or close enough 61.87.  I'll work something out. . This should be resolved in the latest version - v3.2.1 . I've merged the PR but will fallback to navigator.userLanguage for IE... \njavascript\nlanguage: (navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage).split('-')[0]. This should be resolved in v3.2.0 . Thanks for your help \ud83d\udc4d . Not sure where you got those numbers from:\n\nhttps://cdn.plyr.io/2.0.18/plyr.js is 12.9kb gzipped\nhttps://cdn.plyr.io/3.1.0/plyr.js is 24.3kb gzipped\n\nObviously v3 did increase file size, but the result is much more features, a cleaner code base, better API, etc, etc.\nI do want to look at being able to include/exclude parts of the player as that would definitely help with filesize. Currently it's all dependent on each other. \nAny help with this is appreciated... . I think rather than default to english we can get navigator.userLanguage as that's the IE equivalent. I'll merge and update though. . This should be resolved in v3.2.0 \ud83d\udc4d . HTML5, YouTube or Vimeo? This is why I created the bug template \ud83d\ude44. Also, do you get this issue on https://plyr.io?. Cheers for this and the other PR! . This is great feedback and as they look like small fixes, it shouldn\u2019t take me long. I want to make sure it\u2019s as accessible as possible so I\u2019ll jump onto these straightaway. . OK I've fixed the majority of these issues in this commit:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/commit/a97b08e8ea0022646eae005ce64a7edf8b26fb29#diff-502df26753b20c330d95456a4c8db867\nSome notes:\n A screen reader only <label> was already being generated for the <input type=\"range\"> but I guess the aria-labelledby attribute re-enforces that link between label and input? \n The <input type=\"range\"> do have keyboard focus styles but probably need to be less subtle. I will work on improving those\n* I've not added the button yet to toggle the <progress> element updates but will do that next. Awesome. I really appreciate your time reviewing. . With the <progress> would aria-hidden=\"true\" not do anything or perhaps role=\"presentation\"?. Hey @fleps , v3.2.1 has the majority of the fixes for these issues in, only thing missing is the toggle for <progress> pending confirmation from your team. Let me know \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @fleps , any more feedback? . Hey,\nNo worries about the delay. I'm thankful for your time testing. Feel free to use this issue and I'll action the changes required. . This is epic. Awesome feedback and I will action it ASAP and keep you updated :-) \n\nOn 18 May 2018, at 1:34 am, Felipe Spengler notifications@github.com wrote:\nHi @sampotts\nAs mentioned our consultant team did an extensive testing on the player and here are the issues found and the recommendations.\n1) Frames\nThe imasdk.googleapis.com iframe is used as a shim, or to capture events, or for data transport, but it is not ignored by screen readers. Screen reader users may be confused by information that should be hidden.\nRecommended Modification\nHide the iframe as follows:\nUse CSS display:none or visibility:hidden on the iframe element.\n--- OR ---\nAdd role=\"presentation\" and tabindex=\"-1\" to the iframe element. Use the attribute title=\"empty\" to indicate the iframe contains no user information.\n2) Buttons definitions\nThe Play/Pause, Mute/Unmute, Disable/Enable Captions, and Enter/Exit Full Screen buttons are defined as toggle buttons but they do not indicate the state correctly because the name of the buttons changes when activated. Screen reader users will not understand the current state of the controls.\nRecommended Modification\nThe aria-pressed attribute should not be used on buttons where the button name changes to indicate the state. This causes incorrect information to be communicated to screen reader users.\nFor example, the Play button is announced as \"Play toggle button not pressed\" which is correct, but when the button is activated it is announced as \"Pause toggle button pressed\" which communicates that the video is paused, but it is not.\nEither remove the aria-pressed attributes from the buttons OR keep aria-pressed and do not change the name of the button to reflect its current state.\nAlso remove role=\"tooltip\" from the  elements used for the button names, this role is not appropriate for this content.\nNote: The full screen button is not displayed in IE.\n3) Sliders\nThe Seek and Volume sliders are semantically defined but use multiple methods to label the control. There is a label element with a for attribute and aria-labelledby referencing the label element. This may complicate screen reader interaction with these controls. In addition, the slider values are not properly communicated to screen readers.\nRecommended Modification\nRemove the for attribute from the label elements and keep aria-labelledby attribute.\nThe seek slider value should be communicated as the time shown visually. Currently aria-valuemax=\"100\" and the current time (aria-valuenow) is a percentage and not the actual time.\nSet aria-valuemax=\"183\" (total minutes) and use aria-valuetext to communicate the actual time (e.g. aria-valuetext=\"00:23 of 03:03\").\nThe aria-valuetext attribute should be used when alphanumeric values should be indicated to screen reader users\nThe volume slider current value is not communicated properly. When the volume is at 100 the value is communicated as 1.\nUse aria-valuetext to communicate the volume percent (e.g. aria-valuetext=\"100%\").\nNote: In IE, the PageUp and PageDown keys do not work on the sliders as they do in Firefox and Chrome. While this interaction is optional, it allows keyboard users the ability to move the slide in larger increments which increases the usability.\n4) Menus Definition\nThe Settings menu uses dropdown menus that do not define the proper role or state information for the expanded menus. The expanded menus are instead defined as a tab control with incorrect roles and properties defined on the tablist child elements. Screen reader users will not understand this menu and will have difficulty interacting with it.\nRecommended Modification\nRemove role=\"tooltip\" from the  with the button name for the Settings button.\nRemove all of the tablist, tabpanel, and tab roles.\nRemove all instances of aria-labelled-by (the attribute is also misspelled, but this is not required on these elements).\nDefine the menu using WAI-ARIA:\nUse role=\"menu\" on the  elements and add role=\"presentation\" on the  elements for the lists in the expanded menus.\nUse role=\"menuitem\" on the buttons in the expanded menus.\nUserole=\"menuitemradio\" and the aria-checked attribute for the submenus with radio buttons (remove the radio input and label elements).\nIn the submenus, the buttons at the top (Captions, Quality, Speed) are defined as menu buttons but they do not open a menu, they navigate back to the previous menu. Remove aria-haspopup and aria-expanded from the buttons and add visually-hidden text \"go back to previous menu\" so screen readers understand the action of these elements.\nSee http:www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menubutton for more information and examples.\n5) Settings Keyboard Access\nThe expanded Settings menus do not have the keyboard interaction users expect. Screen reader users are told to use the arrow keys to navigate the menus but this does not work properly.\nIn addition, when navigating the radio submenu items, a selection is automatically made and the menu is collapsed. Keyboard and screen reader users will have difficulty with the menus.\nRecommended Modification\nWhen keyboard focus is on the Settings menu button, pressing space or enter opens or closes the menu.\nWhen the menu is opened, keyboard focus should be moved to the first element in the expanded menu.\nFrom within the expanded menus:\nSpace/Enter opens a submenu if present and keyboard focus should be moved to the first item or activates the menu item and closes the menu.\nUp-arrow should move keyboard focus to the previous menu item or wraps to the last.\nDown-arrow should move keyboard focus to the next menu item or wraps to the first.\nLeft-arrow should move keyboard focus back to the previous menu.\nRight-arrow should open the submenu and keyboard focus should be moved to the first item, if no submenu moves to the next menu item.\nSee http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menu for details.\n6) Buttons Keyboard Access\nThe buttons elements cannot be used with the keyboard consistently across different browsers and Assistive Technology/browser combinations. Content is not accessible to screen reader or keyboard users when mouse actions are required.\nRecommended Modification\nDo not auto-hide the control bar when a control is activated. Before triggering the auto-hide, wait for a period of inactivity.\nKeyboard only:\nIn FF, The Play/Pause button cannot be activated with the keyboard, it changes briefly but then switches back to the previous state. For the other buttons, the button with focus activates that button but also activates the Play/Pause button and hides the control bar.\nIn IE, once the video starts, the Play/Pause button cannot be activated with the keyboard or mouse.\nIn Chrome, the spacebar only activates the Play/Pause button regardless of which button has focus.\nWith a screen reader running:\nThe buttons cannot be activated using NVDA/Firefox.\nThe Play/Pause button cannot be activated using JAWS/IE.\n7 ) Focus visibility\na) (IE Only) The video controls, including the menus, have no visible focus indicators in IE. Mouse users get visible cues that a page element is actionable (mouse pointer change, rollover color change, etc.) that are not available to keyboard-only users.\nRecommended Modification\nMake sure that there is a clear visual indicator when an object receives focus and when the mouse pointer moves over the object. For example, you could add an outline or change of background color.\nb) Keyboard focus indicators are used in Firefox and Chrome but are difficult to distinguish against the colors used for the buttons and background for the large Play button overlaid on the video and for the seek and volume sliders. Keyboard-only users and low-vision users may not be able to see where they are on the page.\nRecommended Modification\nChange the focus indicator to be more visible. If a custom focus indicator is used, it should have at least a 3:1 color contrast ratio between the color used for the focus indicator and the background it is used on.\n8) Tab Order\nThe non-interactive video container is in the tab order. Screen reader and keyboard-only users expect only interactive elements to be in the tab order. In some browsers/screen readers, this will be announced as \"clickable\" which will be confusing to screen reader users.\nRecommended Modification\nRemove the tabindex=\"0\" from all non-interactive elements.\nIn addition, remove the aria-label attribute, its use is not valid in this context:\n\n9) Contrast on focus\nImage icons used for the video controls have insufficient contrast (less than 3:1) when they have keyboard focus. Users who are color blind or cannot perceive color may not perceive the content.\nRecommended Modification\nIncrease color contrast to have 3:1 color contrast ratio when the buttons have focus.\nNote: This issue is has low priority because it is not currently a requirement under WCAG 2.0 however, it will be a requirement in the upcoming WCAG 2.1.\n10) Valid Markup\nThe video player contains coding errors that may prevent assistive technologies (AT) from interpreting content correctly. AT users may be unable to perceive or interact with page content and forms.\nRecommended Modification\nFix the validation errors.\nThat's it Sam.\nAs I mentioned, this became more complex than I was expecting, so let me know what are you thoughts on this, and also if you need clarifications on any of the issues reported.\nIf you decide to fix this, when everything is completed I'll ask the consultant to verify the player again and see if everything is ok.\nHope it helps!\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Hey @fleps , sorry it's still work in progress. Trying to get back to it ASAP. Will keep you updated \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @fleps, \n\nSorry I've been trying to get to it. I've got some time now so getting back to it. It's the re-working of the menu that's taken me the most time and getting my head around the new structure. I'm not sure there's anything that I'm struggling with per-se. I'll report back as I make progress. . One part around the focus styles was going to involve using this:\nhttps://github.com/WICG/focus-visible\nBut it looks like it's not possible to confine it's use to one element: \nhttps://github.com/WICG/focus-visible/issues/126\nSo that may have to wait for now and I'll look at why the current setup doesn't highlight focus in IE11. It should but IE is a right PITA as we all know. . Thanks for that - I'll revisit. From memory we're using box-shadow - I think it just needs to be less subtle. Sorry, it's the designer in me. \nApologies for the delay on it. I want to get it out ASAP myself too but want to make sure it's spot on before asking you to check it again. . Hey @fleps, I've just raised a PR for @friday to take a look at. Once that's in develop then I'll push it to a beta test page so you can take a look. I'll also push a beta tagged version to npm. . I have pushed the improvements to hopefully rectify the issues outlined in v3.4.0-beta.1 which is now on npm and also live here: https://plyr.io/beta. If you want to take a look and let me know. I'll also double check myself tomorrow. . Thanks for that. I'll try and clear those up tonight if I get time. It's my top priority to get this wrapped up. . Sorry, I've been out of action with a cold/flu \ud83e\udd12 . I've just pushed 3.4.0-beta.2 to npm (and updated https://plyr.io/beta) which contains fixes for all of those bar the IE11 (I'm really surprised IE11 has issues \ud83d\ude02) and NVDA issues which I'll need to do more testing with. . I'm still working on the remaining issues which are:\n\nIE11 \nNVDA\n\nI'll look at these two next. The rest has been released in v3.4.0. I won't close this until it's fully resolved.. Sorry - I've been away on vacation. I'll try and get to the remaining issues this week. \nAlso, with regards to the ARIA menus, I saw this:\nhttps://www.marcozehe.de/2018/09/22/wai-aria-menus-and-why-you-should-generally-avoid-using-them/\nDo you have any feedback on that? . Cool thanks for the feedback. I'll leave that as-is then! \ud83d\udc4d . Sorry I'm really struggling to debug on IE11. It's such a drainer and time waster. I'll get there though. . Not too sure - as it's not part of the core plugin functionality then you're kinda on your own, sorry. . Are you seeing this on https://plyr.io? There's certain things in the bug template that you've removed which help me debug issues... . Hmm I\u2019ll take a look tonight then . OK I've changed the property name in v3.2.3 and it seems fixed now in the simulator.  . Unavoidable unfortunately. Please raise these issues with YouTube directly as the issue is with their API. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d . Hey, you need to setup each player individually... \njavascript\nconst players = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.player')).map(player => new Plyr(player, { /* options */ }));. Are you seeing this on https://plyr.io? . Let me know what you find as the fix may be something I can incorporate into the main project \ud83d\udc4d . https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#setting-up-multiple-players. Wherever you initialise the players normally? Speed controls work fine on https://plyr.io so I'd say you have other issues.  . Did you read the docs about polyfilling? . https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#polyfills. Good point @friday , I should document that build. . @ClementThu Sounds like you need a new team leader \ud83d\ude06 . Yeah I'd like to avoid polyfills too but to be able to move forward with better syntax and better performance in 95% of browsers, to support the 5% of people stuck using vintage browsers, we have to use polyfills. You'll find Plyr isn't the only modern JS lib relying on polyfills. Even so, the polyfilled build is ~40kb. By far the best method is to use polyfill.io though as it only serves the polyfills required by that user agent - it's backed by the financial times. . Thanks for the support! https://www.patreon.com/plyr. That\u2019s intentional (the title). Also you might want to read up on pull requests. . Please create a proper pull request. I can\u2019t see what your changes are. . Thanks for finding this \ud83d\udc4d It's fixed in v3.2.2. It was just the buffer display that was effected. . It\u2019s likely due to their API not firing an event but I\u2019ll take a look and see if I can mimic the event in lieu of the missing event. \n\nOn 7 May 2018, at 2:01 pm, Guru Prasad notifications@github.com wrote:\nI'm able to reproduce the issue reported here.

I'll get this one fixed today. . I can add width: auto as that seems more logical to me as a reset? . Will add to the next release (probably later today). This should be resolved in v3.3.0 \ud83d\udc4d . This is usually specified in the VAST tag. Have you spoken with vi about this? They manage the tags for the ads plugin. . I've asked them and apparently the ability to skip the ads is controlled by the advertisers. . The option is now called controls. Worth reading the docs first.... Given that's almost identical code to the demo (it's a basic HTML5 video initially) then I'm at a loss. Do you have multiple #player elements perhaps? \nHere's a basic codepen that might shed some light \nhttp://codepen.io/sampotts/pen/jARJYp. Yeh go for it if it works \ud83d\udc4d . This is a real pain. We need to clone the original node for the destroy() method but this has the side effect of loading the video twice with no way that I can see, to prevent it. I've had a play and think I've found a fix though.. This should be fixed in v3.3.0 but report back if not... . As noted this is documented but thanks!. All good. I'll make it clearer. The other issues you raise with IE11 definitely need looking at though. . What are the stats on iOS 8 & 9? Probably less than 2%? . OK it looks like 9 has ~5% share. I'll take a look. . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . When selecting an option, it'll now take you back to the home tab pane. . The weird thing is that the HTML5 media elements don't have the concept of stopped but I guess we can safely assume if the player is paused and currentTime is 0 then it's stopped. \nI'll take a look. \nBTW I'm originally from Portsmouth, just down the road. Small world! \ud83d\udc4d . Yep. It\u2019d be effectively the same state. It\u2019s probably why the standard API doesn\u2019t support it. \nSam\n\nOn 5 May 2018, at 11:36 pm, friday notifications@github.com wrote:\nBy the sound of it, wouldn't that also toggle the class on if you pause it, and move the progress slider to 0:00?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were assigned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. This should be resolved now in the latest version (v3.3.0). This would be great. I'll start taking a look into it. . Thanks mate, any help is appreciated!. > but haven't got a full picture other than that it's still lacking (not consistent and/or following the standards).\n\nCould you expand on this perhaps? What standards? \n\nexcept the progress event since the w3c spec pretty much leaves it up to interpretation\n\nPersonally I think is the naming is a little strange and trips people up but it's consistent with XHR. Other than the name it works fine IMO. It's fired periodically as data is downloaded. How would it be improved? \nIt's not something we have control over anyway and getting the browser devs to fix even minor bugs is painful at best. I've been trying to get Safari to fix a bug where custom styled <input type=\"range\"> elements are constantly redrawn after interaction and getting no where. You'd think wasted CPU/GPU cycles would be an issue?!\n\nThe Plyr progress \"slider\" doesn't pause when you seek like native browsers do\n\nWe don't have to mimic everything the native players do. We should decide what's best. Remember the browser devs don't always make the best decisions. In this case though, would this be pause on mousedown/touchstart and then set currentTime and play on mouseup/touchend? \n. Could you provide the i18n object so I can test? Cheers. Thanks, I'll take a look tomorrow if I get time. . This should be resolved in v3.3.6 \ud83d\udc4d . Buffering video would be down to the quality/compression vs network speed. Just a factor of how much you can get down the pipe. \nThe other issue I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up. Are you saying backspace triggers play/pause when in full screen? . I think this is just due to the history api - backspace = go back. I don't think we should disable that behaviour. . This is an easy fix - just need to tweak the regex. Will get it sorted today. . This should be resolved in v3.3.6 \ud83d\udc4d . Which video type? I can't replicate on https://plyr.io for HTML5, YouTube or Vimeo. . As I say I can't replicate on the demo site. Could you link to the player with the issue? Any errors in the console perhaps? . @mhluska @friday It's now released in v3.3.7 \ud83d\udc4d . This should now be resolved in v3.4.0 but please report back if you're still seeing it. . Using contain won\u2019t stretch a smaller image of course which I think the default does (I need to check again). It\u2019s probably just 100% (stretched horizontally) but this didn\u2019t match the default behavior when I tested. . Sorry, you are correct \ud83d\udc4d . Does anything work on that browser? It's just about the worst browser I've used (and that includes <= IE6). It's really hard for me to test as my Google Nexus 5 test phone refuses to install it and defaults to Chrome. . The cause of this is the <input type=\"range\"> and my calculation of the value for the tooltip. The issue is that the handle never overlaps the end of the track on the input so you need to know the width of the handle itself and account for a varying amount of that as you get closer to the extremities. Unfortunately you can't determine the width of the handle with JavaScript as it's in the shadow DOM. I wonder if it's possible to do by creating an offscreen <input type=\"range\"> that has width: 0 then calculate the rendered width. I'll take another look. Someone else raised a similar bug. . Sorry about this. \nI think this may be due to using the <div> method rather than the progressively enhanced <iframe> and perhaps something related to playsinline but I need to do some more testing. . This seems to work:\nhttps://codepen.io/sampotts/pen/jxxygv\nI'll add a default option for playsinline to be true. . @ndimatteo Well it used to, back in May. You have to remember I don't control the YouTube API or functionality... Feel free to, you know, contribute rather than just -1 \ud83d\ude12. The only bit with this one that concerns me is the overriding of the standard behaviour of the slider. I'm not sure how this will play with libs like range touch (another one of mine) that help with touch devices. They don't work too great with <input type=\"range\"> or at least iOS doesn't. I'll give it a test. . Should we update on both seeking and seeked? Otherwise the scrubber would indicate a different time to the actual time displayed? i.e. you'd seek to an unbuffered part of the video and the time wouldn't update until that part could be played. Unless I'm mistaken. . Ah sorry, \"scrubber\" is like an industry term some folks seem to use for the seek input. \nI'm not sure what you mean by the other part. I tried to keep the methods small to update things like the buffer display, times etc and then only binding to the events required for those methods. Are you suggesting we have one mega method to handle it all? My preference is usually smaller methods with limited responsibility. I'm sure there could be cleanup though. Also, you can't really bind to currentTime (perhaps some sort of mutation observer?), there needs to be an event to listen to to know about the update - in the case of a change to currentTime, the event triggered is timeupdate. \nI'll merge this and see but really the time should update to the intended seek time. It may still do this but I'm not 100% sure. . I think it'd be a limited use case but worth doing I suppose. \nWith the cloneDeep, is that faster than just doing Object.assign({}, object)? Using Object.assign seems cleaner at least.\nAlso, can Plyr.defaults = utils.cloneDeep(defaults); not be within the class itself? As a getter/setter or static perhaps? . You're right about Object.assign. I thought it actually cloned if you passed an empty object as the first argument like jQuery's $.extend(). Sadly not.  \n\n\nStatic properties unfortunately doesn't exists in javascript classes (at least yet). The functional equivalent to static methods for properties is what I just did.\n\nActually they do. That article seems to be about public vs private. We already use static classes:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plyr.js#L1235. Ah totally misread then! Looks like you've done more homework than me \ud83d\udc4d \nThe private class properties will definitely be useful when they get introduced. It's a bit of a mess currently. . Using the SASS variable as per the previous version:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/sass/settings/colors.scss#L5. Nice work. Do we need to reset/remove the background-size when changing source?. As above. I\u2019m really on the verge of going back to pure HTML5 and improving the support for streaming (and teaching myself about it). Constant issues with crap API, SDKs and UX with YouTube and Vimeo.  . Nice work. I guess we should PR this to a branch other than master so I can test? Same for the others I'd say? \nThe error stuff was WIP but I guess I can come back to this PR to grab that again. . This should now be resolved in v3.4.0 . It shows the controls instead; which allows you to pause. This mimics most other video players behavior and makes the most sense. . How do you normally set the captions with a HLS stream? We could easily add a setter to set the captions but I'm unfamiliar with the format they are usually set using HLS. . Ah, excellent. I'll wait for them to fix that then \ud83d\udc4d . It\u2019s a bug. Will fix it. \nSam\n\nOn 26 May 2018, at 4:54 am, Ashley L Hill notifications@github.com wrote:\nExpected behaviour\nInstalling plyr@3.7. using npm install shouldn't install npmlocally\nActual behaviour\nnpm@6.1.0 is being installed in node_modules like it is a local dependency.\nThis causes a fatal error when I try to build:\n```bash\nTo use this template, you must update following to modules:\nnpm: 6.1.0 should be >= 5.3.0 <= 5.6.0\n(The app that I'm upgrading plyr on has npm locked down in its engines field. )\npackage.json in master has this, however the version in develop does not.\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"babel-polyfill\": \"^6.26.0\",\n    \"custom-event-polyfill\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"loadjs\": \"^3.5.4\",\n    \"npm\": \"^6.0.0\",\n    \"raven-js\": \"^3.24.2\"\n  },\nI've never seen npm installng npm as a local dependency before.

Yep it has to do that. When you load new media it won't know the duration until the loadedmetadata event is fired.

Did you try with a native HTML5 <video>? . I now know what this is but I'm totally unsure how to resolve it. iOS seems to, only for the controls in the menu, set the :focus styles on the first tap and then the second tap works as expected. I'm still unable to fix this. Even removing the CSS styles doesn't resolve it.

This should probably be documented but the best way to do it would be to have the source you want as default to be first in the list as that's how HTML5 <video> and <audio> work; they will loop through all  until they find a supported source. \n\nThere's also a config option but this would be less ideal as it'd start to load the first <source> and then switch. \nIn your case it would load the 360p file first. . @friday to help diagnose; clicking the progress bar doesn't seem to be enough. You need to click, hold and then scrub. When you lift it's muted. It seems to be limited to YouTube. I'll have a quick look now. . Pretty much as above \ud83d\udc4d I'd just add:\n\nElement queries will solve this but currently it's hard to know the size of the actual player vs the viewport itself (where media queries are useful). It's possible to hack something together with IntersectionObserver as far as I'm aware but not something I've investigated yet. \nI agree not sure we'd want to add another option when we could just take the order that the options are specified in the array that was my initial thinking before but never jotted it down. \nTitle is only currently used for accessibility attributes.. Definitely agree with all of this. I had originally thought about ordering the controls based on their order in the array in the options. I guess I'm not sure which is better - defaults that you can disable or opt in/out for everything (using the array). \n\nCreating custom buttons has been asked for before.

No other browsers seem to exhibit the same behaviour. \n\n. As I said, it's the <input type=\"range\">. Without Safari actually fixing the bug in their browser, I'm not sure what else we can do. I'll try and see if I can hack something to fix it. . Ah sorry, @JonathanBristow asked which element was causing it, hence my answer. The issue is definitely related to the <input type=\"range\"> element and the CSS used to style it, causing Safari to constantly redraw. I'm not convinced it's the MutationObserver but I'll take another look. . I think I've found a fix. Removing transition: all 0.3s ease in the @mixin plyr-range-track() stops the redraws. It's a bit risky to transition all anyway so I'll work out what's actually needed to transition there and push a fix tomorrow. . I've pushed v3.3.23 to npm which includes the patch so you should be good to grab that. Sorry for the delay.. If it's possible to do via their API/options then we can, otherwise SOL unfortunately \ud83d\ude22. Cheers! \ud83d\udc4d . Your change is now merged in v3.4.0! Cheers dude \ud83d\udc4d . Any non zero values should come from a variable really if we're changing that. I'll look at tonight and merge. . I should have the changes for the a11y issue ready soon. Just working through a weird Firefox quirk with the keyboard shortcuts. . Cheers! \ud83d\udc4d . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . Are you seeing these on https://plyr.io? I can't replicate either. It works fine for me on IE11 and Firefox. 99 times out of a 100 this is due to an issue with implementation. Possibly due to polyfills. Is there a public page I can see? . Why have you opened another issue? And ignored the template. As I replied already. It works fine in those browsers on the demo - https//plyr.io. Good luck fixing it your end. . Did you test https://plyr.io? It\u2019s working fine. Good luck fixing your implementation. \nSam\n\nOn 1 Aug 2018, at 9:25 pm, Naveen Kumar notifications@github.com wrote:\nYup!!! Sorry.

I'll create a matrix in the docs and wiki . We've decided to remove support for YouTube quality control as the API was becoming less and less useful to the point where it didn't work 99% of the time. I'll write some documentation on this shortly. . Firstly, thanks for using the issue template \ud83d\udc4c\nAre you able to replicate this on https://plyr.io? I'm not able to replicate on Chrome + Windows 10. It's also strange as even in your screenshot I can see it defined above \ud83d\ude02. It's kinda expected that you'd understand what ES6 is vs ES5 to use a library like this. I can make a note though. I'd recommend using babel. . This is now updated. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . @INFJakZda This should be resolved in the latest version? let me know if not. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d I'll do a release later today with the a11y stuff since there's minor stuff remaining. . I\u2019ll still sleep at night don\u2019t worry. Feel free to get a pull request in... . Yep, I just need time to review. . > Ergh debugging Edge is awful\nIsn't it?! Same for IE. There's a reason Microsoft have stopped trying to make browsers! \ud83d\ude02. Thanks @friday . Will push out 3.4.1 shortly with your fix. . Found it and fixed in v3.4.3 - https://codepen.io/sampotts/pen/PBgNNe. Damn it - that'd be my change. Fix one thing, break another \ud83d\ude02. This should be resolved in v3.4.4. Cheers all \ud83d\udc4d . That\u2019s nothing to do with Plyr. That\u2019s an issue with your server configuration. You only need the crossorigin attribute if you\u2019re hosting captions on a different origin. \nSam\n\nOn 15 Aug 2018, at 3:00 am, mlearncore2018 notifications@github.com wrote:\nI am playing a video using Plyr and getting this issue-\nFailed to load http://--video url --: Redirect from 'http://--video url --' to 'https://--video url --' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

It needs updating and there's already an issue for that:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1127. Are you exposing player correctly? E.g. const player = new Plyr('#player', options); ?. Read the docs. . Possibly an issue with the Vimeo library, particularly as it works in Firefox and as we don't really control that feature. I'll have a look but if there's any chance you can debug and test without Plyr that'd help. . There is another way. You can use the <div> placeholder that even their own API and documentation supports. It won't make any difference to the playback though as either way require user input to begin playback in browsers that block autoplay. Don't always trust the YouTube API docs. They document the ability to request a change in quality but it actually does sod all \ud83d\ude02 . Very low priority and a breaking change. Maybe in the next major version. HTML validation does very little other than make the developer warm and fuzzy inside \ud83d\ude02. Fair enough. I prefer actually working functionality myself. . data-res is cool with me. Lets go with that then. . Any chance you have a CodePen example of this? . Why not data-size? Also, this way it\u2019s a breaking change as it\u2019s not backwards compatible. I can\u2019t merge this as is unless it waits for v4.0.0. Reading the docs would be a good start. I presume you've generated the quality levels you want? Plyr doesn't do it for you. It's only a client side library. The slack is really the best place to discuss this given this isn't really an issue.. Please use the template.. When you create an issue, there's a template for what browser, Plyr version etc. You must have deleted it but it helps us work out the issue. I suspect this isn't an issue with the latest version for example. . Yeah not sure how you update unpkg but they're pointing to an old version. . Please update to the latest version of Plyr. Thanks. . No. It's not. As I stated (maybe read my replies if you want help?) it's loading an older version:\nhttps://unpkg.com/plyr@3.3.23/dist/plyr.min.js\n\nThe latest is 3.4.3. You're using 3.3.23. So that's definitely not latest \ud83d\udc4d . \nPLEASE USE THE TEMPLATE\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/new?template=bug.md. Also. It's not something Plyr can really fix unless we can somehow inject/remove the viewport change on enter/exit fullscreen ... https://webkit.org/blog/7929/designing-websites-for-iphone-x/. It supports whatever formats you give it. Remember it's just an abstraction of native HTML5 video and audio or YouTube/Vimeo. . Do you see this on https://plyr.io/#vimeo ? I can't seem to replicate. . I'm not really too sure what to do about this. I can't prevent that error in the console and let's be honest, it does no harm other than effect logs if you log to Sentry or similar. It's a 404 at Vimeo's end. We can't use the new API as you'd need to specify an API access token which is a bit of effort for some. I could probably add an option to load the poster image or not (that's what the call is for) if the console message is causing a problem. . I\u2019m dreadfully sorry I\u2019m not meeting your SLAs with this free software! \nFeel free to open a PR. . Hmm I need to check where the event is being fired as your code should work. In the meantime you can always use the on method for that instance to check for events. e.g. \n```javascript\nconst player = new Plyr('#plyr-video', {\n  controls: ['play', 'progress', 'current-time', 'mute', 'volume', 'fullscreen'],\n  autoplay: true,\n  loop: { active: true },\n  invertTime: false,\n  volume: 0,\n  muted: true\n});\nplayer.on('timeupdate enterfullscreen exitfullscreen', event => console.log(event.type));\n```\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/h82L5x7f/. Should be resolved in v3.5.0 \ud83d\udc4d . Closing in favour of #193. Thanks for this \ud83d\udc4d I had already made the change after the issue was raised initially but not commited/pushed. . This would need the UI building out for it. We'd also have to add an option to enable it as it looks like only some accounts have it (Pro etc). . I now have access and aim to get it updated and working again soon but I can\u2019t give a firm date of course. \n\n?\n\nWhat does your comment add? Sorry if I didn\u2019t meet your SLA for a response. I\u2019m on vacation. In case you forgot, this project is open source and I work on it in my spare time. . Closing in favour of #1127. Only through Vi currently. . Hey, yep I was on vacation but I'll get to fixing this one asap. With regards to the fullscreen. You can try the iosNative option as @jamesoflol pointed out but the other way should block scrolling. I'll look into that. I'm also going to see if I can get the fullscreen working correctly (so it fills the viewport) on the iPhone XS when I get mine \ud83d\udc4d . The pause issue should be resolved in v3.4.4. I've also pushed some code to improve the fullscreen on iPhone X/XS with the notch. \nI'm unable to replicate the issue with the iosNative option. For me it triggers the native fullscreen player in both the simulator for iPhone XS and a physical iPhone 8. \n\n. This is a hard one to test since I can't easily go back that far. I've signed up to BrowserStack and awaiting their approval as an open source project. Will get back once I've had a play. . Cheers fellas. Why was this raised?. It's really baked in so that it makes it easier for the end users. The majority don't even touch the options and just load the SVG sprite from the CDN. Open to any ideas if you think we can improve that though. . Referencing the SVG like that using CORS (which most would be) has very limited (perhaps none?) support currently. The sprite would need to be same domain. . Pull requests should be to the develop branch as per docs . If you click a focusable element, it automatically gets focus, so much of that code is redundant. Also, as part of the acccesibility issue, tabindex was removed from the container. What\u2019s the actual bug here? . The tabindex has been restored in v3.5.0 which should resolve this \ud83d\udc4d . Again, I\u2019m not seeing the issue here. You\u2019ll notice the logic is that if the quality level passed is not supported, we choose the closest supported level. Do you have an example (codepen or similar) demonstrating the issue with the current implementation? . Thanks for this \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah, that's fair enough. I need to work out a way to seperate the demo page from the core lib. . We don\u2019t control the actual context menu but feel free to raise this with the browser vendor. Good luck!. Use SASS. Boom! \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr#sass. Yep. It's a bug with the YouTube API unfortunately. There's a plan to remove support for it as their API is useless. You request a quality level but they never actually set it. . Hey, the CodePen demo was using an outdated version. I've updated it to use latest (v3.4.5) and it now functions correctly: https://codepen.io/sampotts/pen/jARJYp. Hey @jamesoflol I've not looked yet. It seems ok on my iPhone XS on 12.0.1. I'd need to give it a go on an iPad. . Yeah, the issue seems to lie with <input type=\"range\"> - I don't know why but they seemed to have not implemented support for it properly at all. A real pain. It might even be worth baking in the functionality of RangeTouch into Plyr. . It\u2019s in the develop branch currently. I\u2019m just testing another feature before it can be released. . Remind me why we want to seek to the end of the video on source change? I've backed this one out as I don't think there's any benefit to it. What was the issue you were trying to solve? . I can't reproduce that. Anyway duration is the length of the media, I think you meant currentTime but that's already handled. For me it seeks back to where it was previously. . OK. Yeah, your code was using duration instead of currentTime ...\njavascript\n// Seek to duration before changing quality\nthis.seek = duration;\nAnyway, glad it's sorted. Nothing has changed with that recently. Perhaps you were using an old version. . Thanks, this is now updated! . Sounds good. I didn't even know that was possible. Here's the reference for whoever works it on it (probably me when I get around to it):\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API#Cue_settings. Will take a look but this is a minor bug as really all it does is log a message in the console. It doesn't actually effect functionality. . Thanks dude!. I think technically it should show controls on the first tap and then while controls are visible then another tap should pause it. This is how most players work on touch devices from my experience anyway. . I don't notice anything like that on my iPhone XS. What device are you testing on? . What version of the library? Have you tried with the latest?. Feel free to take a look and open a pull request \ud83d\udc4d. You want:\nhttps://github.com/redxtech/vue-plyr/issues/. Which change should I make then? Remove the fallback (I'd say no if we can avoid it) or is there an option you guys can use to avoid the error perhaps? . Duplicate of #1222. Let\u2019s take care of it in that one. I think it\u2019s a YouTube issue though, sadly. . I can only assume this is a YouTube issue since we\u2019re doing all we can to hide branding and info via their official options. I\u2019d raise an issue with them directly but they are very slow to even respond, not to mention actually fix issues. . I\u2019m fairly certain this happened before and they fixed it. . Good find! They're using the following URL: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/3Bwsbp981lc?embed_config={\"adsConfig\":{\"nonPersonalizedAd\":false},\"relatedChannels\":[],\"disableRelatedVideos\":true}&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://www.theguardian.com&widgetid=1 \nPerhaps that embed_config is the key. . I think the easiest option here is I just disable the custom controls for YouTube and Vimeo or remove support. There seems to just be constant issues with them and it's always on me to resolve them. . This looks great! I'll merge it later today and get a new version out along with the download button once I remember where I was up to with that. . Reading the docs would be a good start. Have a look at the options section for the controls option \ud83d\udc4d. Ok so read some more of the docs. seekTime Is what you\u2019re looking for. It might be worth reading the docs again? . See closed issues. Thanks for this. It was an oversight. The build script is meant to update the version but has a bug. I\u2019ll deploy both fixes in the morning. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d. Hey @mkody, I've fixed this in the build script so won't need this change. Thanks for bringing it to my attention and making the effort to help out though. It's appreciated. If you find anything else, feel free to dive in \ud83d\udc4d . Please be less vague. Pause seems to be working fine for me on those browsers too. . Sorry, I can\u2019t replicate this on MacOS or Windows 10 on Chrome or Firefox. Are you seeing that on https://plyr.io? . I've tested on 62, 63, and 64.0b3 and still can't replicate. I hope you find the cause your end. Good luck!. There's some weird behaviour with error handling (well, events in general) and HTML5 media elements. Media Events don't bubble at all which is a pain but there's also some really quirky behaviour and errors are a big one. What I've found is, if you set the media as the src attribute/property, you're good. Error handling is easy:\njavascript\nconst player = document.querySelector('#player');\nplayer.addEventListener('error', event => console.error('Doh!', player.error, event), false);\nBoom. Works a treat. When you start adding <source> elements, that's when it goes out the window. Most of the info online will say you need to add an event listener for the 'error' event on the <source> elements themselves. I've never found this to be reliable either. \nHere's a couple of examples:\n<audio> : http://jsfiddle.net/b64yjtz7/3/ \n<video> : http://jsfiddle.net/cpxe1ko7/3/\nFor me, I always see an error for Player 1 (using src attribute) but no events fire at all for the second player (using <source> elements). \nAny help with this would be appreciated. \n. I carried on digging; it looks like you need to set the src property and then reload the media. Not ideal... \njavascript\n// Force a reload of source\nplayer2.src = player2.currentSrc; \nplayer2.load();\n<video> : http://jsfiddle.net/b64yjtz7/6/\n<audio> : http://jsfiddle.net/cpxe1ko7/4/\nNot sure how this will play out with autoplay etc. Will have to do more testing. . Thanks! . Not possible. Also, it would defeat the object. . This is really a bug with Edge but I\u2019ll see if we can do a workaround by forcing a redraw or something I guess. . I'm not even sure where to start debugging on a Samsung TV. You might be better off just using the native player there... . Not yet. There's a (very old) issue that's tracking this but it's not something I've started on yet. . See #1231. Do a search next time \ud83d\udc4d . No need for the caps - I can read. Yes, that's because it's not fixed yet, otherwise you'd see the issue closed. It's being worked on, be patient. Your solution is a hack and only works for HTML5 anyway. . It's something I'd like to build in but haven't spent much time thinking about how it could be structured. Any help would be appreciated. Making the YouTube and Vimeo players into true plugins would be a good start. . > There should also be support for custom themes.\nThere already is via CSS. . @musicworldcup Your question is unrelated to this one. Your issue is your config is incorrect. The ads property value is an object, also publisher ID is a string. So your example should be data-plyr-config=' {\"debug\": true, \"title\":\"Test\", \"ads\": { \"enabled\": false, \"publisherId\": \"902676586493663\" } } '\n@nexushp Sorry this isn't possible with anything built-in. Ads are currently all managed through the Vi ad plugin. \n. I get asked this a lot. Embed views count as views as far as I\u2019m aware but feel free to test it out and report back. Our implementation of YouTube just uses the same code as their embedded player so I can\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t unless they ignore embedded players. \nRemember there\u2019s likely a delay. . I would say contact them and raise it as a bug but you'll be lucky if they actually fix it... \ud83d\ude02. https://www.quora.com/Does-YouTube-count-views-if-the-video-is-posted-to-Facebook-and-viewed-from-there\nhttps://www.quora.com/If-I-post-a-video-from-YouTube-on-my-website-will-the-views-count-on-YouTube\nhttps://boostlikes.com/blog/2014/08/youtube-video-views-embeds-count. Plyr isn't customizing their code at all though. It's just using their embed API... \nhttps://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference. I've no idea. I don't think anyone has solid evidence to point either way but it certainly seems strange to me that they wouldn't count views of embedded videos given how widely they are used. We're already using their API so I'm not sure there's anything else that can be done if in fact they aren't being counted. They aren't the most responsive either when it comes to fixing issues... . OK I guess that's a no then. I'll add a note in the docs. Do you have any source for that @gehaktmolen . You don't need to hack the source code to change those two paths. Check the docs for how to change them via config. https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#options\nFor the issue of your sprite not loading, make sure you have the correct mime type set in your server config.\nGood luck! \ud83d\udc4d  . It's easy to use another server for those files. You need to change the iconUrl to your new URL and then the blankVideo option to your new URL. \nThe mime types for the files should be \n| File | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| blank.mp4 | video/mp4 |\n| plyr.svg | image/svg+xml |\nIt's strange though as the files are served via Fastly's very fast CDN which is globally distributed. . It really depends on the server you're using. I'd just Google it myself and get an example. . Please post the code you're using on jsfiddle.net or codepen.io . I'm not able to replicate this on https://plyr.io ? Could you give some more information or better an example codepen or jsfiddle? This is why we have the bug template (that you removed!) \ud83d\udc4d . Nice! Thanks \ud83d\udc4d . The player currently has an animation in the progress bar while buffering. Adding something something in the center of the video player is possible though. . I'm a bit confused. Where is the logic for the auto selection? . That\u2019s just CSS in the demo. If you actually implement it yourself, there\u2019s no radius. . It\u2019s the expected behavior on iOS as it\u2019s the only way to retain the custom controls since it doesn\u2019t support the full screen API. You can use the iosNative Option to use the native player in full screen. \nI\u2019ll take a look at windows 10 though. What browser? This is why I have the bug template that everyone removes. I wish GitHub would force its use! . Thanks! I'll give this a go locally . Looks great! I've shot you a message on Slack about getting the images you've created and the VTT so I can add them to the demo. I'll use some of those notes you've written for the docs. . Cheers for this! \ud83d\udc4d . Deployed in 3.4.8 - sorry for the massive delay . You can remove the crossorigin attribute if you have that added as I'm fairly certain it's only the .vtt files that require that attribute plus CORS to be implemented on the server. Failing that CORS is very easy to setup on S3/CF. That's how plyr.io is hosted.  . You're looking for the i18n option:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr#options. Can you create a codepen so I can see/replicate? It looks fine on https://plyr.io on an iPhone XS for me. . There's a CSS class you can use:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/config/defaults.js#L342\nThere's already a loading state in the progress bar when buffering but others have asked for a central loader which I'll do eventually. . The theatre mode really changes the container or page that the player is in. This isn\u2019t something that would be feasibly built into the player but perhaps a method to add custom buttons would help, with a callback to resize the container. . I guess the issue is including or loading the JSON somehow. Building localized bundles or getting users to include i18n files that override the config is another way. Obviously loading the remote JSON file is possible but slower unless cached in local storage or something. . I\u2019m not sure this is something that is best built into the player. Another candidate for the ability to add custom buttons perhaps. \n\nOn 18 Nov 2018, at 8:29 pm, ahmadshc notifications@github.com wrote:\nHello\nCan design and add social share button for your player?\nThe sharing button can have several different modes:\nshare link (url) of page video in\nshare link (url) of page video in, with picture of page and few description\nshare embedable video code\nWhichever one you implement is great\nThank you\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. I'd say there wouldn't be a requirement for this. The sharing should be done on the parent page rather than built into the player itself.

It looks like this is a Safari-wide issue. It also does it on desktop. I'm looking into it now. . Try testing the code in the develop branch. I have it working there but need to finalise another feature that's also in that branch first. . This is now fixed in v3.5.0 \ud83d\udc4d . Weird. It looks fine for me in Version 12.0.3 (14606.4.5). Perhaps there was a bug in 12.0.1? . > I'm even still having this issue in Safari Tech Preview 76 (Safari 12.2, WebKit 14608.1.6.2)\nGrrrr. Dangit Safari!\nI've just tested Release 76 (Safari 12.2, WebKit 14608.1.6.2) of Safari Tech Preview and it also seemed ok. In Safari Tech Preview there seems to be issues with hover interaction but that also effects loads of other sites and isn't isolate to Plyr. YouTube does the same. I presume this is a bug with Safari Tech Preview. However, the fullscreen works fine for me on https://plyr.io. I tried to use Safari and Safari Tech Preview for a while as my primary browser but they are quite buggy. I now use Firefox primarily. . Changed base to develop (as per all PRs other than docs) and merged \ud83d\udc4d . Perhaps we just create a build task that accepts an argument for an ISO code and bundles that lang (if it exists) with the rest of the JS. . My only concern for this is that it will increase the size of the player somewhat and I'm not sure of the demand for it. . I think you'd have to contact VI about this one? I did ask about skipping ads and they said it's done on a per-ad basis. . Please search next time... \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/682\nFeel free to PR it. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d . Do you play when you embed them without using Plyr? Sorry this is a hard one for me to debug. . Not currently implemented. You could do it with custom controls and CSS. Sorry I don't have an example. . Closing in favour of #652 . Are you both using the latest version? \nSam\n\nOn 13 Mar 2019, at 8:44 pm, DA COSTA Filipe notifications@github.com wrote:\nI have a fork for the change if you want to test : https://github.com/dacostafilipe/plyr/tree/yt-fullscreen-fix\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Cool. Let me me know.

The library expects basic knowledge of JavaScript, which can be obtained elsewhere. Thanks for the consideration though. . The volume isn't technically 0 when the media is muted though (unless it was 0 before); it doesn't change from it's previous value. Perhaps you're looking for the muted boolean getter? . Not really a bug is it? Edit the CSS. . What device? Seems fine to me on Android and iOS. . It's fine here on an iPhone 8 and iPhone XS, both running iOS 12. I'll dig out my Android phone to test but it's always been fine in testing and the logic for that hasn't changed. . I can't replicate this. . You're probably looking for this then...\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr#rangetouch. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks! I never knew about this. Very interesting. I guess it's recommended to use Math.trunc instead of parseInt generally? \n\nWith regards to Vimeo progress, we could probably do a string comparison I guess. Not 100% sure myself. \nWe can add a polyfill to the list and add a note to the docs. . I doubt @friday will get time as he's stepped back a little. I'll try to when I can. Do you get this on https://plyr.io ?. Both loading states for HTML5 are the same - the background of the progress element is animated with stripes (they move but this is a static image):\n\nI've been thinking about other options for this. Video is easy; a centred spinner but audio is a little harder as we don't want to change dimensions of the player. A spinner in the place of the play button is an option but then doesn't make it obvious still. I'll keep thinking. .

Does the PR fix it for you? The reason the tab index was removed was due to accessibility concerns. . I'll add the tabindex back in on the container as that's all that's useful in the PR. A click on a focusable element will focus it by default so the event listener isn't needed. . Does your example not achieve the same thing? . Why not just use the seeked event? It's worth having a read of the docs:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr#standard-media-events. Sure you can. Why can't you do something like this? \n```javascript\nconst player = new Plyr('video');\nlet lastTime = player.currentTime;\nplayer.on('timeupdate', () => { \n    lastTime = player.currentTime;\n});\nplayer.on('seeked', () => {\n    console.log(lastTime, player.currentTime);\n});\n```. Why not hide them via the options? https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#options. Good idea and do-able. I'm sure there's a reason that's in there but can't for the life of me remember \ud83d\ude02. As of v3.5.0 this is now possible \ud83d\udc4d . As discussed on email. You can add a wrapper...\nhtml\n<div style=\"max-width: 300px\">\n    ...\n</div>\nYou can use that <div> to pass to the setup/constructor. . Please check current issues. Thanks for this. I'll do the same for YouTube and also make it possible to add extra options. . Please search before opening new issues. Search for \u2018playlists\u2019 . https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/3. Is your issue a bug? If you\u2019re looking for support, this isn\u2019t the place. Stack overflow or even the slack channel are for that. . It's a trade off. If you want click to play then we must be able to capture the click. Obviously a click on an <iframe> will be captured by the <iframe> unless pointer-events: none is set or we overlay an invisible element. It also effects other parts of the player including capturing hover events. . I tried your change and it didn't seem to make a difference in the demo. The poster image <div> is always overlaid over the <iframe> but will be opacity: 0;. This allows us to capture the pointer events. If that <div> is not there or display: none then we can't capture hover or click events. Your change to pointer-events: all isn't needed on the <iframe> as by default its value is auto anyway. We don't change this in CSS. Maybe you're using an older version?  . I've pointed the VI guys to this. It looks like the ads on https://plyr.io have stopped working too. . Your site needs to be approved by Vi guys. It's not an issue with Plyr. Please contact Vi and they will be happy to assist. \ud83d\udc4d . I think if we're going to make this change we can remove the role altogether can't we? Isn't progressbar the default for a <progress> element? The reason I added presentation was to stop updates being announced. See https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/905. Probably using something like Handbrake or a video editing tool. Good luck! . No idea but it\u2019s nothing to do with Plyr. We don\u2019t request access to that. Hope you find the cause. . Explain the benefits and I might consider it but SVGs are designed for the job. . That settles that then \ud83d\udc4d We'll stick with SVGs then. . Happy to accept a PR for this. . Hey,\nAs per the docs, you need to set up each player individually or use the static Plyr.setup method and pass as selector to it. Otherwise you're using the Constructor which will only setup one player (since it's a class). \nHere you go:\nhttps://codepen.io/sampotts/pen/KJZZMx\nNote: Plyr.setup will return an array of players it sets up. If you want better control over reference to the players. You can always add an id on the elements and loop or something:\n```javascript\nconst players = {};\nArray.from(document.querySelectorAll('video')).forEach(video => {\n    players[video.id] = new Plyr(video, { ...options });\n});\n``. Updated the title for others in future to find it easier. . I\u2019ll make a change to the docs . Duplicate of https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1118 - Please search next time \ud83d\udc4d . This isn't really the right way to go about it - it's still a dependency of the project as the demo JavaScript imports the module. Linting fails if it's moved todevDependencies. Ideally what I'd like to do is have a separate package.json (that somehow inherited the root one or perhaps just included theplyrpackage itself) and gulpfile for the demo site. . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Yep. This is expected behaviour and is controlled by Vi. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . You'd have to ask them. I've suggested it but they wanted muted ads. Up to them really. . The query isnot dead` and it builds fine here. \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/package.json#L32\nPerhaps you need to update something on your end? It's valid:\nhttps://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+1%25%2C+not+dead. This should be fixed in v3.5.1. Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . I'd recommend using terser these days but this looks to be a genuine issue. Babel doesn't seem to be transpiling the const to var for whatever reason. I had a very quick look but couldn't find anything obvious. Will have another look later. . Also, I would use the unminified version if you want to minify it yourself - plyr.js. . Yep this is a bug as I\u2019ve said. Any help is appreciated. I\u2019ve taken a quick look and there wasn\u2019t a quick fix. I\u2019ll look again when I get some time. Probably this weekend. . This should now be resolved. It was due to node_modules being excluded from the Babel process and a dependency using ES6 syntax. . Yep it is unfortunately as we display it in a custom element. The only other solution would involve removing the progressive enhancement. I don\u2019t think removing the poster attribute with JavaScript would abort the initial load. I doubt it. . If we had access to the shadow DOM then we could clone the contents yep but its not possible. . Please give more details then? . Re-open using the template . Wrong repo. I don\u2019t work on that one. . The selection was removed for YouTube. The API never worked correctly (a bug at YouTube end) so it was removed. . Listen to events and then send them to GA. Good luck! .  I'm confused. Is the issue with \"Yandex\" or Opera? What's the market share of the \"Yandex\" browser? Opera seems to work fine using the native button but the custom button isn't visible. Is that the issue?  . OK I'll take a look when I get a chance. It looks like worldwide use is very low at 0.155%:\nhttps://caniuse.com/usage-table\n. There are other issues raised related to this.

I wouldn't even know where to start on this one. . 1. This is for accessibility reasons. Space should activate menus. \n\n\nThis will come in a later major release. What's not minimalist about the design? It's usually the feature people like the most actually. \n\nFeel free to jump into a PR if you're in a rush \ud83d\udc4d . This should be this.value otherwise it won't get the value of the input?\n. To be consistent, could you use the full event variable name so it's clear. \nEdit: Ah I see the parent variable is event, could we not use another name like proxyEvent or something? \n. Could you make sure the tabbing matches the rest of the code? I can't remember if we use 4 spaces or a hard tab but can you just make sure it's consistent, cheers\n. I'm pretty sure you don't need the display: flex but just the flex: 1 which could be specified on the parent selector\n. What's the reason for changing this to flex? Pretty sure block is fine? \n. As with below, don't think we need this to be display: flex and the flex: 1 is already declared on the element outside of the media query\n. I think this can just remain for iPhone only given videos can't be played inline on them yet (coming in iOS 10 by the sounds of it). iPad play video inline fine though. \n. This might need to remain for the below. \n. This line will remove access to the underlying YouTube or Vimeo API which some may find useful?\n. Again, this allows access to the media after a source change - otherwise the reference is to the old element\n. Is this needed? I think you meant to put this in selectors? \n. Can't this just be:\nvar lastScriptTag = scripts[scripts.length - 1];\nSave a lookup?\n. Can this change be reverted please. I'd like to leave the demo as-is. . Any reason this is a <form> ?. How come the loop functionality is mixed in with loop stuff? I can't see this function referenced . What's the return for? . I'm confused by these function changes - are they duplicates of other functionality? Also can't see this referenced?. All good then \ud83d\udc4d . Interesting. Good to know \ud83d\udc4d . This should use getElement as it will just get the correct buttons within that player rather than all on the page. I'll do some tidying the develop branch before this goes out. . Same for this. Should also use getElement or you're updating a random match. Should also use a selector from config. . Same as others - this will select the first it finds on the page (not necessarily this player) and should use config . I noticed in a couple of spots there's random -2 and +2 - any idea what they are for?. Can you remove the extra :first-child selector here and make it a selector per line please? Same for the SASS. Actually don't worry - I'll do it . Can we just leave the demo as-is please. Does this not work on one line? . Can we just make this a getter to follow the same standard as the parent? get playing() { return this.playing } it might not even need to be specified since it's exposed by default in the class anyway... . You can enable timestamps in your browser. Also, you can remove the fullstops from console messages to follow the standard. So this would become just Resume video.. Can't this just be pauseContent() ?. Can this just be resume ?. Good point - maybe make it resumeContent() then?. Yep. I prefer using the HTML5 hidden attribute instead. It\u2019s used elsewhere in the player so I\u2019ve stuck with that. It\u2019s still hidden by default . What's the reason behind this one out of interest? hidden no good? . Could you add a new line before this nested selector. Stylelint + Prettier should have picked it up but I guess you're not using that (I'd recommend it).. We need to keep the return in here somehow as it allows devs to do their own thing to prevent the issue of pause being called before play etc. . In fact you could just make it:\n```css\n\ndiv,\ndiv iframe { \n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n``. Yeah, I think that'll work nicely :-) . OK cool lets roll with that if it doesn't cause other issues. Would opacity + visibility work instead? . Minor typo but it's YouTube. A pet hate of mine with WordPress too haha . Is the!importantrequired for these two?. How do you feel about perhaps making the default language'auto'and we translate that intonavigator.languagein the code? Might be more user friendly. . Super minor but can we make thisHTML5. Small one but could we call the variablelabeland maybe the property for i18n asqualityLabel?. Are we missing the[0]at the end of this to get the 'neutral' language? eg.en-GBtoen. . Ahhh yes of course. I missed the destructuring (still getting used to the new syntax) \ud83d\udc4d . The reason I didn't include these is they are a branded product and an acronym rather than words that need translating. I know this doesn't force people to localise them but it implies they should if they are in the list. . Could you use the type checkers we have? e.g.is.string(input). Could you use the type checkers we have? e.g.is.object(input). Could you use the type checkers we have? e.g.is.string(input). Could you use the type checkers we have? e.g.is.object(input). This can just be an early return since you're returning it on the next line anyway. . What's the reason for this change? Just shorter?. Ah good spot. I knew about.searchbut never realised.searchParamshad nolengthproperty. . Should we useis.function(player.media.play)`?. Can we not use object destructuring here? e.g. \n\nconst { duration, playing } = this;. It'd be good to start comments with a capital to match the others . Can you make sure you have prettier and ESLint setup? This could be a one liner. Also you should use === rather than ==. Basically this line can be:\njavascript\nconst english = languages.filter(e => e.code === 'en');\nAlso should we not use a config option for the default? It may not always be 'en'. . As above. There's some odd syntax and formatting going on. . You'll notice the rest of the project uses 4 space tabs. We should stick to this \ud83d\udc4d . As above with formatting. Do we not want to allow en-AU, en-US, en-GB etc?. Shouldn't this one be player.play?. I would just remove this completely. Also if we're removing from the docs. We should also remove from the source. The static method can be used to setup multiple players. . You're correct. That's why it's already covered in the docs:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/#setting-up-multiple-players\nRemoving it should be part of this PR to complete it but I'm happy to do that after. .

I think at least 20% of Windows users who have Fx or Chrome had a friend install it for them.  Alot of people don't even understand you need a 'client' to access the internet.\nFor my tool, I can force people to use the latest browsers.  For sharing video to my typical consumers, I can not.

Maybe make your own independent repo?\nI agree that it could be overkill, but I could see it would be helpful in testing.

More often than not I will load useless data, because I will not watch the full video.\nSplitting the video in 10 chunks of 10 mb, means that i will load up to 10 + n mb of memory, which is usually less than the default buffer size.

    "martindale": "VideoJS has a plugin that does this, but it seems they use the iframe rendering option in most cases.\n. If it's possible to use a native video element, that would be vastly preferred to the iframe solution.\n. Even moreso, changing sources altogether \u2013 for example from a YouTube video to an mp3 audio file.\n. @ChangeTip, give @SamPotts $5 for working so hard on this library!\n. Can we unify the API for YouTube vs. other sources?  It's extremely inconvenient to have to tear-down and reconstruct a new Plyr instance when switching from a YouTube source to an MP3 source, and vice-versa.\n. This is great.  I'll be using this immediately (from the develop branch indeed, but will switch to a release as soon as it's available).  Thanks a ton!\n. Okay, started my integration, but I'm not sure of the correct approach as expected by the library.  I've posted the following experiment, which implements the general use case I need:\n``` js\nplyr.setup();\nvar player = document.getElementsByClassName('player')[0].plyr;\nvar sources = [\n  {\n    src: 'http://inumedia.io/whalestep.mp3',\n    type: 'audio/mp3'\n  },\n  {\n    src: 'SZO5QYP-GeQ',\n    type: 'youtube'\n  }\n];\nsetInterval(function() {\n  var time = new Date();\nplayer.source({\n    sources: [(time % 2) ? sources[0] : sources[1]]\n  });\nplayer.play();\n}, 5000);\n```\nIt seems to correctly load the direct mp3, but not the YouTube video.  Am I doing it wrong?  Maybe this case will help you define an API, alternatively.\n. It's Jade, but very simply:\n``` jade\nextends layouts/media\nblock content\n  h1 yo\n.player\n    video\nblock scripts\n  script.\n    //var player = plyr.setup();\n    plyr.setup();\nvar player = document.getElementsByClassName('player')[0].plyr;\n\nvar sources = [\n  {\n    src: 'http://inumedia.io/whalestep.mp3',\n    type: 'audio/mp3'\n  },\n  {\n    src: 'SZO5QYP-GeQ',\n    type: 'youtube'\n  }\n];\n\nsetInterval(function() {\n  var time = new Date();\n\n  player.source({\n    sources: [(time % 2) ? sources[0] : sources[1]]\n  });\n\n  player.play();\n}, 5000);\n\n(function(d, p){\nvar a = new XMLHttpRequest(),\n    b = d.body;\na.open(\"GET\", p, true);\na.send();\na.onload = function(){\n    var c = d.createElement(\"div\");\n    c.style.display = \"none\";\n    c.innerHTML = a.responseText;\n    b.insertBefore(c, b.childNodes[0]);\n}\n})(document, \"/img/sprite.svg\");\n\n```\n. Heroic.  Getting library interfaces built in a way that's easily accessible is a non-trivial problem.  You're doing an amazing job.\n. I'd like as consistent an API as possible across all sources; YouTube and direct mp3 streams are the only ones we are using in production now, and we have several different code paths depending on the audio player's behavior with a particular source.  Our choice to use Plyr was in hopes that we can finally find a tool that lets us reduce that to exactly one code path!\nIdeally, you use the callback you mention internally, to fire an event to Plyr, which then handles the YouTube videos identically to a direct MP3 stream.  I'm not sure Plyr is designed this way, though!\nOn the note of consistency; can the YouTube sources property be an array?  In your above example it's a single value, while the mp3 source has an array.  (We actually keep track of several different YouTube videos per audio track, and the clients will rotate on to the next element in the array if the first video doesn't load -- which is surprisingly common!  Some videos aren't available in some countries, so the ability to use \"fallback videos\" is necessary).\n@changetip, give @SamPotts 1,000 bits for continuing to be awesome.\n. Hey @ChangeTip, give @SamPotts a helpful hacker to help him wrap up the YouTube and audio APIs!  Can't wait to finish integration with soundtrack. :D\n. Alright, this looks much better.  There's a couple minor tweaks I'll be submitting in a pull request, but first some questions;\n- is play among the methods that YouTube doesn't support? Uncaught TypeError: plyr.media.play is not a function when attempting to call player.play() immediately after loading a YouTube video.\n- are you opposed to unifying the video and youtube \"type\" at the top level, in favor of adding a new attribute type to source?  The \"media\" would still have type: 'video', even if one of the sources in the array had type: 'youtube' (as perhaps another source is a pure mp4 stream, or an audio file).\nWas unable to test Vimeo for now, but will happily do so once I iron out the above two issues.  Adding Vimeo support to soundtrack will be great!  Their API always has been a pain...\n. Hrm.  We do want autoplay, but this working shouldn't be dependent on that feature (since we'll be allowing our users to turn the player off entirely).  I'd rather Plyr wait for the YouTube API to emit some sort of \"loaded\" event, but allow .play to be queued up when called so it actually plays when the YouTube event is emitted, not simply hard error... though your comments about polling make me a sad panda when it comes to the feasibility of this.\nMore importantly is the separation of source and media objects; I agree it's more complex, but it's a little more accurate.  A YouTube video is still a video after all, not a different \"type\" of media.  We've the need to feed an array of potential sources to the player, and they might all be of different types (YouTube, mp3, etc.), so this would vastly simplify the code necessary to use Plyr, which would be a better experience for future users, IMHO.\n. Awesome.  Thanks!\n. I think the ability to control the player with custom buttons is what you want here; though, even better would be able to select a different target to render the controls to!  Huge +1 for that latter option, specifically.\n. Suggestion: var player = plyr.setup('.some-css-selector');\n. I like the new method, it's much more in line with expectations.  I'd go so far as to not instantiate unless explicitly called; that is to say, don't automatically instantiate on anything (well, definitely not a class name).  Barring that, it looks good! :+1:\nAh, and the other requirement of having a nested <video> or <audio> tag -- just let it bind to anything, and automatically create the required child elements.\n. Long-term plans include rendering the audio cover (or Soundcloud track image, which we use in production today!), or potentially later, a Javascript-powered audio visualization.  I'd ignore the latter case  for now and just focus on keeping the interface the same.\nI think my crazy visualization dream case will require a <canvas> anyway, unless I can figure out how to render to <video> from JS...\n. If I can control the fullscreen setting externally, that'd solve the problem, as long as fullscreen isn't eliminated when rotating from a video to an audio track (or vice versa).\n. ",

For native android video player (AwesomePlayer/ NuPlayer), clicking on the screen shows the control and it does not pause the video, users have to press the pause manually to do such action. I believe the same rule applies on iOS too.\nFor desktop users, clicking on the screen pause the video is what we used to.\nDoes this work here?\n. So for mobile users, when the controls are hidden, no action (including seeking) by touch can trigger unless the user first clicked the screen once and reappear the controls. No changes for desktop users.\nAlso, can you make the seeking bar higher for mobile users? It is just too narrow for touch screen as it doesn't have the drag thing.\n. @SamPotts Actually when I click full screen in Safari, the full screen is not a full screen. It is a full window.. I believe this is what he mentioned.\nAttached screenshot when it is toggled to full screen.\n\n. Is it necessary to have \"ALLOW_KEYBOARD_INPUT\" flag in Safari? If it does not support the tag, it should able to request a full screen without keyboard.\nI just googled and see a demo that has no issue to request full screen in Safari. http://www.sitepoint.com/html5-full-screen-api/\nDon't know if there is any help.\n. Thank you, @SamPotts. Works now! :+1: \n. @ChristianPV You can stop/resume by clicking the screen. The button is not working nor reflecting the player status.\n. @ChristianPV My comment is a workaround until the issue being fixed, and also part of troubleshoot.. I do not think it should hide the progress bar because a lot of people seek the video to a point instead of the beginning.\n@SamPotts YouTube just updated their HTML5 player in the website. The controls background are now transparent :) Should have changes to API as well. http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/04/youtube-rolls-out-new-html5-player/\n. @SamPotts Updating @ChristianPV's last comment. It cannot seek the video to a particular point when the video has seeked before starting. I believe it is the same root cause.\n@ChristianPV My previous comment is not a suggestion. My comment is a workaround until the issue being fixed, and also part of troubleshoot..\n. @SamPotts @ChristianPV I just created a pull request to fix the events are not fired and video cannot seek before video started.\nI notice other issues like keyboard control in YouTube player is different than plyr itself. I don't know @SamPotts is willing to match the keyboard control or just disable it (adding disablekb: 1 in YT object). Right now, when you use arrows to seek, the progress does not update.\n. To fix @ChristianPV issue completely, plyr should not start the video after seeking. No such issue on Youtube.com player though.\n. I am using the CSS file from the dist folder. I looked into the code, and plyr does not generate the button. Live demo at https://calvintam236.github.io/media-plyr/\n. Thanks. Fixed.. :+1: \n. I just tested the RAW code on http://jshint.com. I do not receive any errors..\n. Fixed. As a web developer, most of us use double quotes in html coding. If you validate the source, it will give us warning of \"Mixed double and single quotes.\"\n. I looked at your source code, and most typeof cases use ===, not ==. I also checked https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof, and all the examples use ===. That's why I \"fixed\" them.\n. In my opinion, I would prefer:\nvar player = plyr.setup('.js-player');\nvar player = plyr.setup('.js-player', config);\nvar player = plyr.setup(config);\n. @SamPotts You should update the API doc in the table. I didn't notice you wrote another section for source as in the API table it is showing the old method..\n. I still get error message after switched to new source method..\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'type' in d\nI used this: (String is allowed for sources)\nplayer.source({\n            type: 'video',\n            sources: datauri\n});\n. So I figure it out..\nSomehow the sources is not accepting string as expected. Plyr will work when using this: sources: [{src: datauri}], but not sources: datauri...\n. In the table before events states it can accept array or string for sources.. Is that an error?\n. I am referring to this section\n\n. @SamPotts I just updated the code with your new version, and source using data URI stuck at forever loading status. There is no error message under plyr.media.error, and empty src at plyr.media.src. Confirmed that data URI is entered into source() inside an array in sources.\nMy repo: https://github.com/calvintam236/media-plyr\n. There are use cases:\n1. you want to embed to short video or audio files (e.g. less than 100k) in order to reduce several page requests for small files\n2. You want to play the media using file upload without hosting a server. (File protocol would not work, so base64 is the only way to archive that\nI know it is working before source APi change.\n. Actually the second paragraph is referring #165. I got mixed up as it was so long time ago.\nI think the bug is caused by source API change before it wasn't the before that. (Still working around v1.3.2)\n. Tested v1.6.8, and it works on Firefox. Chrome and Opera are not working. While debugging, I check the media.networkState value, and I get 3. Maybe it is an issue on webkit core?\n. Last checked on v2.0.7. Chromium core e.g. Chrome, Opera is not working. Safari & FF is working.\n. @SamPotts any update on this? I reviewed the code, and it seems its an easy enhancement.\n. @sampotts FYI: reopening the issue is not an option even for me (issue author). I will check on the code later this week and report back.. This is probably an upgrade for #3, but it is not resolved yet.\n. You are trying to use .srt file in <track src=\"\">? HTML5 specification does not support subtitle format other than webvtt, so you need a webvtt format subtitle for the src. You can convert it on server or use a data URI with Javascript in src.\nMy solution to convert .srt, .ass, .ass to webvtt format by JS: https://github.com/calvintam236/webvtt-subtitler\n. ",

This is possible now. See: #994. @SadeqRasheed: You can access v3 in the develop-branch. I'm already doing that (only for subtitles), but it's not recommended. Some features are partially implemented and will break unless you disable them.. Exactly. I don't have a family/child but I still haven't been able to use my spare time to develop and maintain something as popular as plyr. So instead I'm very grateful Sam has pulled it off. If you think you can do better. Just do better!. @Droppers This is part of https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/766 due to release very soon. It is implemented, but not for HTML5 yet, and the youtube api seems to ignore quality change requests (https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/793#issuecomment-371278521).\nIt's hard to do this smoothly with HTML5 video unless it's a stream btw. I'm not sure but I imagine this is why html5 video hasn't been implemented yet.. I think it's easy to implement, but hard to implement smoothly, without pausing or getting jumps. HTML5 Media Fragments for example aren't that precise/granular and neither is the html5 timeupdate event. For a smooth effect you may have to preload another html5 video and swap.\nGood luck!. Perhaps you could implement the vanilla HTML5 video first, but allow overriding the actual switching with an event listener? That way you wouldn't have to detect, implement and support individual APIs like shaka, hls.js and dash.js but still work with them. Getting the sources list should be the same for all of them right?. Manual vs automatic switching could be a problem. I don't know much about it, but Imagine it could be handled in an event listener-implementation as well in that case.\nEdit: Remove hls.js comment that was inaccurate (I mixed things up). This is implemented now for HTML5. For Vimeo it's not supported/possible (at least without a hack). For YouTube it was supported. Sam implemented it, but YouTube remove the support on their end shortly after :( hls.js, dash.js and Shaka player is still not supported. There are a few assumptions in the architecture that makes this a little hard to implement.. @alex-devPY: Plyr is wrapping existing browser features and apis, and doesn't determine what is or isn't supported. If your browser supports html5 video and the codec, container and preset plyr should work. Disable plyr and use html5 directly. If this fixes the issue (not likely), it could be a problem with plyr.. @firescript See https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#5-autoplay-scripted-play-andor-the-preload-attribute-doesnt-work-in-some-browsers and #1112. I think this only solves the easy part (getting the content). But there's no standardized oembed js API we can use to connect events from our controls to the iframe, right?. I'm closing this since it's such a small browser that we don't officially support. It may already be fixed (both qutebrowser and Plyr have gone through two years of development since the issue), but if not, PR's are welcome.. Great to know, and thank you for the update! . @a-barbieri: It's player.currentTime now and the documentation is at the github page.. Plyr now has a poster element and automatically sets it for youtube. You can set it after creating the instance with instance.poster = ..., but if you run this too soon after the original poster is created then it will be ignored. Should be pretty easy to support setting a custom youtube poster though.\nExample:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/fgegfjp7/1/. @LittleHamster Yes. The method is there and work regardless as long as it's video.. Closing since the main work has been done. Created a new issue #1018 for using custom posters for YouTube/Vimeo.. Looks great @wagich!\nI would encourage you to create a PR for this, but I'm not sure it's something we can maintain. dtslint should work to some extent to ensure not breaking the definitions, but it doesn't seem like a good option (seems to be based on tests, that have to be maintained in themselves if I read the readme right).\nPerhaps unmaintained typings are better than no typings though?\nI would be in favor of switching to Typescript eventually, but besides the work needed I don't know if @sampotts is.. This is possible as mentioned. With v3 using the source setter. @sourovroy posted this on our Slack:\n\nI want to re-write these code for v3\ni have already written for testing purpose and one of my project here\nhttps://github.com/sourovroy/plyr-test\n\nI can't say for sure since it's not a clear case, but I do think this would be better as a Plyr plugin, which is something we don't yet support. I've been looking at it, but there are architectural challenges. So I wouldn't expect it any time soon.. I created a new issue #1090 for subtitles (captions), so for further discussion about that please go there.\nThis issue seems to actually be about annotations, which is not the same thing. In addition annotations have been removed from YouTube (but is still supported for old videos).. > I would like to verify that if I use Plyr to play captioned YouTube-hosted videos, Plyr will, in fact, surface a CC button so viewers will be able to toggle the YT captions on and off from within the Plyr UI.  Is this true?  \nNo. This is not supported.. I'm taking the liberty of closing this, since it's almost entirely off topic. The topic is adding support for is a YouTube-specific feature which they have now abandoned. I doubt anyone is interested in developing or supporting this.\nIf you found this you're probably interested in #1090 rather than annotations.. Closing due to inactivity (no reply from issue author). This is very likely a server error that would happen to native html5 video as well.. #383 is about annotations, so this wasn't really a duplicate.\nIf you see this, go to #1090 for further information and discussion about captions.. This should be possible in Plyr using something like the settings {controls: [], clickToPlay: false, autoplay: true, muted: true} or vanilla html5 video with the muted and autoplay properties.. @julmot Please create a new issue with details how to replicate the issue (optimally with an online code example on jsfiddle or something) and the stack trace, unless it's the same as #1001. Closing in favor of #470.. If someone has issues with this (I'm not using require.js myself), a PR with an alternative method to load the URL is welcome. For example, you could detect if require.js exists globally and use it to load the URL instead of loadjs, like the solution above but in Plyr instead of a workaround.. I'm going to close this since it's very outdated and can't be merged, and wasn't a sustainable solution to begin with. The link was to a private repo which didn't update and which we didn't have control over. Also: vimeo now supports amd (in case they didn't before).\nExample of how to import vimeo in require.js:\nhttp://jsbin.com/filogakaqu/edit?js,console\nIf someone needs to make alterations to the code to support this use case (I think it is still the case, but I don't use require.js, so I wouldn't know), please create a new pull request to the develop branch. \ud83d\udc4d \nAnd thanks for the effort!. Is this still happening? Seems very strange to me that only a couple of people would have these issues if it's a browser bug, rather than a browser addon, proxy issue, misconfigured server or something.\nThere was a related issue in iOS 10 around that time though: https://poodll.com/ios-10-and-html5-video-and-html5-audio-on-https-sites/\nAnyway. I'll close this until some confirmation of the opposite (comment here).. I'm closing this since this it's over a year and there's nothing anyone could help with or respond to it at this point.\nIf you ask at our slack with a code playground (like http://plnkr.co), the latest Plyr version and minimal code to reproduce your problem I will try to help you.. I'm closing this since it's now outdated and phrased as a question. If you still have this issue, please upgrade Plyr in the example and paste the full stack trace. Also our slack (which we didn't have at the time of this issue) is better for questions.. Closing this as it's very old by now and I wasn't able to replicate it.\nIf you ask at our slack with a link to a jsfiddle, codepen or something similar, the latest Plyr version and minimal code to reproduce your problem I will try to help you.. I can't reproduce this. The creator is MIA, and the second comment has a syntax error (semi-colon after ]).\nIf someone experiences a similar problem, please create a new issue.. @Blucreation for both play and pause? This is working now in my tests with play, but not pause  (see #968 for that one).. Closing since I think this is either fixed or the same issue as #968, which is better described. If I'm wrong about that comment here or open a new issue.. Still not working, although the reason specified is now fixed for v3. I updated the example to v3, jsbin (better for console output) no debugging and waited for the TEXT_TRACKS_ADDED- event to initialize Plyr.\nhttp://jsbin.com/sorociboju/1/edit?js,console,output\nThe menu is now generated, but switching doesn't work. Like #971. Seems to be working pretty poorly even without Plyr though. At least in Chrome.. Closing in favor of #994 (has more relevant info and a working reference implementation). Plyr is using HTML5 video. As long as browsers don't support RTSP (which will likely never change since it's a legacy format), neither will Plyr. To support RTSP you either need to use flash, or you can convert the stream with your own server and ffmpeg.. > This is reproducable in the Hls.js only version too\nThis of course means it's not a Plyr issue. Since Clappr is using Hls.js it seems unlikely that it's a Hls.js issue either. Probably something you can do to avoid it in your implementation, or you should take it up with hls.js.. @humayuncep: Plyr v3 is not compatible with plyr 2. Read more here if you want to test it https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/766.\nAbout the vimeo video controllers showing for v2, please report that separately using the issue template.. @premhameed: ~~Check that you are not using v3 since plyr.setup() is v2 syntax. If you are, then either downgrade to v2 or update the the initialized from plyr.setup(element, options) to new Plyr(element, options).~~\n~~If there is something wrong with the module still, please try to change the lib/plyr reference to point directly to the dist output (this shouldn't be needed though) and report the version.~~\nIgnore this. The thread was \"bumped\" very close to a year after complete inactivity, so I confused the year of your post with 2018.. I think this has been fixed. I'm not getting this issue in Chrome on my Android, and it hasn't been brought up in quite a while now. If not, please comment and I'll reopen.. Late response @artifex404: Which options do you need this for? Couldn't you use window.innerWidth or window.innerHeight to conditionally change the options before initiating Plyr?\nIf you need some option to adapt in real time to viewport size changes, this is something best done with css rather than javascript imo. So depending on what it is there might be alternatives.\nI think we should avoid adding another layer of abstraction to the options unless we really really need them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glZ1C-Yu5tw. You can do that already. You don't need Plyr to do this for you.\njs\nconst isTouchDevice = 'ontouchstart' in document.documentElement; // This is not completely safe though\nconst controls = ['play-large', 'play', 'progress', 'current-time', 'volume', 'settings'];\nif (window.innerWidth > 320) {\n    controls.push('fullscreen');\n}\nif (window.innerWidth > 768) {\n    controls.push('mute', 'captions');\n}\nnew Plyr(video, {autoplay: !isTouchDevice, controls});. It should be possible to loads content of mixed sources and use the ended event to detect when you need to load the new source. Due to the browser autoplay restrictions you mention (which is worse by now) you probably want to avoid autoplay or mute the audio. There is no other feasible way around it. I think you should then be able to run the code that handles the whole \"queue\" of videos, but you may need to create your own click handler or something.\nThis has everything to do with html5 media and browsers. Plyr is just a layer on top and doesn't set these restrictions, so I'm closing the issue. If you have further questions please go to the slack channel: https://bit.ly/plyr-chat. Does this still happen in v3?\nThe source method doesn't exist any more. It's a setter now. Also think the second comment regarding autoplay is a red herring or at least not the same issue, since it wouldn't trigger a TypeError.. Closing since no-one has responded. If it's still happening, please create a new issue for it.. I think there's been some confusion about this. Would recommend #1090 over #383 for further discussion.. Reopened, since I think this is either \"bigger\" or lower level than YouTube caption support, and that it needs it's own space in order not to be forgotten. It's possible to fix this without adding YouTube support for captions, and supporting this may help to add support for YouTube captions (#1090).\nPlyr could potentially handle captions for any provider (live streams not included) by providing some way to support VTT files with iframes. Perhaps this could also be used to override HTML5 media textTracks, which would solve an issue currently solved by introducing the captions.update argument.\nThis could be achieved by parsing vtt files and triggering events similar to cuechange. Alternatively I'm sure a hidden html5 media element could be used somehow, but this would be a bit of a hack.\nParsing VTT (and SRT) is relatively easy, but would add some complexity to the code. The more formats supported, the more complexity added, so I don't think this should be a goal to support them all.\nWhy:\n Some providers may not support captions or getting captions using their SDK, or their Plyr plugins may not support it (like YouTube).\n Vimeo captions aren't currently safe to use #877\n* Shaka Player create textTracks that don't work well with either Plyr or native HTML5 controls, and hls.js still may has issues with their captions making it unsafe captions.update is intended for these cases, but it could be deprecated in the next version if this is implemented, which additionally would enable loading the streaming library before Plyr (not a supported use case when leaving captions.update to false in order to avoid getting the textTracks generated by the library).. @rubenswieringa \nNormal HTML5 video implements captions. Plyr uses this API to listen to events to show and hide cues (lines of text), while the actual HTML5 captions remain hidden (but not disabled, since we need the events).\nVimeo and YouTube may also be using this API for their implementations. Plyr can access approximately the same information via Vimeo's wrapper APIs, but not the raw original text track nodes, the original events or the original video elements.\nIn order to add support for external subtitles you would probably have to fetch the caption, and parse it (since there's no HTML5 video to add it to as a track). Then you would need to listen to timeupdate and trigger the show/hide events when the cues should be shown.\nI don't expect that to be very hard. The parsing logic for VTT is very simple. Plyr doesn't have an API for adding captions that works for non-html-elements though.. There's no rush though. Even if you did this super quickly, Sam doesn't have the time to keep up with the PR's and issues as they happen. You may want to ask him about this specifically before spending much time on it.. Enabling to store things based on the URL rather than per Plyr instance could make sense. For example when storing quality, captions (language or index) and even more so for currentTime (not currently stored).\nCombined with the suggestion in https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/pull/1053#issuecomment-398839047 this could then become: \njs\nconst player = new Plyr(element, {\n  storage: ['captions', 'language', 'speed', 'volume'],\n  urlStorage: ['currentTime', 'quality']\n});. I still get this behavior by following @kraf's instructions on https://plyr.io/. Duplicate of #497. I tested with https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xNN-bJQ4vI\nThe controls are shown, but you can't click them. You can fix this with custom css:\n.plyr--full-ui .plyr__video-embed iframe { pointer-events: auto; }\nSince this is experimental and untested it may result in other issues.\nI think we should support this.. v3.3.19 fixed this, but v3.3.20 / https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/commit/ac64350a5fb658f0c9d96063a3cdb8871669cd55 broke it again.\nNow you need to set .plyr__poster { pointer-events: none } to make this work. It doesn't seem to create any problem with the controls not showing?\nhttps://codepen.io/fullkornslimpa/pen/NBdvKv. ~~Seems to work now in v3 (including for youtube) with new Plyr(video, {captions: {active: false}});~~\nEdit: Nope ^. Thanks @Igcorreia \nI think what actually happened is that I tried it with a YouTube link with generated captions, which seem to be off by default. YouTube also support importing captions using VTT files and other options, which seem to be default on.\nThe option I suggested using has no effect for YouTube.\nReproduced here: https://codepen.io/fullkornslimpa/pen/OEKmpK. Why do you need Plyr to do this? How do you want Plyr to do this? Should it be a button or just API? and what should it do with the image? Download it to your computer? Set as your desktop background image? ;)\nIt's super easy to do, so I don't see why Plyr should handle it.\nHere's an example that overrides the poster image (assumes your player is named \"player\", like on on plyr.io):\njs\n(() => {\n  const width = player.media.videoWidth;\n  const height = player.media.videoHeight;\n  const canvas = Object.assign(document.createElement('canvas'), {width, height});\n  canvas.getContext('2d').drawImage(player.media, 0, 0, width, height);\n  // Set as poster (will show if you run `player.stop()` for example)\n  player.elements.poster.style.backgroundImage = `url(${canvas.toDataURL()})`;\n})();\nVimeo/youtube support is likely not possible.. The current answer should be working for html5 video and audio. It also doesn't load the metadata (including duration) so you have to use the duration option or use preload=\"metadata\" instead (not recommended since browsers load much more than the metadata with this option). For hls see #957. For other streaming libraries look at their API docs.\n\nBy now plyr is setting up all videos when i click on one thumbnail.\n\nThis shouldn't be the case with v3, but comment if it is and I'll reopen the issue.. Closing, since this is an intended limitation of some browsers with scripted play as well as autoplay. See Ferdi's comment: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/589#issuecomment-310333452\nMuting the audio should work, as well as triggering play() from an event listener for certain events such as touch events.. @brianberneker The only outdated links should be the codepen examples for streaming. Plyr used that syntax before v3. I agree they should be updated to avoid confusion.. This should be possible using separate videos (loading the second one after the first has ended), but not with the same video (I don't think this is something worth supporting).\nSee the docs: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#the-source-setter\nAlso, if playlists (#3) are added, this would make it even easier.. Closing since this should answer the question ^\nMessing with the progress positioning is probably not a good idea at all since it's also used for seeking (displaying tooltips with time and then seeking to the time based on the relative position of the cursor).. For html5 video, you simply add it to the css for the video element and override the size of it's parent. It's pretty well supported by now.\nIt won't work in IE11 however, and in Edge it only works for the image element.\nIt also won't work if your video element is in an iframe (youtube or vimeo).. background-size works for the poster element, but not the video. The video is not a background-image and hence you need to use object-fit, which doesn't work in IE (or Edge yet for video), and only for html5 video.\nIf you know the original aspect ratio and the grid aspect ratio you can use css transform: scale() to emulate this on the video/iframe-element as well.. Duplicate of #144. autoplay is a boolean property, so in order to disable it you must leave it out.. If the controls are hidden before playing, that could hinder the possibility to start playing. If you don't enable clickToPlay, the big play button or autoplay (which isn't supported by many browsers) there wouldn't be any way.\nConsidering you can either disable controls completely (pass an empty array as the controls argument) and implement your own controls, or hide them with .toggleControls(false) once #883 is fixed you should be able to accomplish what you want without it being directly supported in plyr.\n(You probably want to disable autoHide too). Duplicate of #1115 (which is newer, but has more info). You can use MutationObserver for that. You can't currently. I suggest we add support for this via events so developers can trigger events to update the quality options and catch user changes to it.. I haven't touched this for a while, but from memory I think what you need to add on the plyr side is mostly a method (event listener) that adds \"qualities\" to the current controls, and a method to trigger events (though it's possible to trigger them externally on the html element). There's already an event for quality changes, that you can listen to and override with hls.js code.\nIn the end I felt blocked by other problems, but it's possible to add this functionality without solving them.\nThis is what I wrote in the slack #development-channel about this issue:\n\nI started looking at the quality selector. We don't need to do much to support streaming libs. I actually have it working, but not working well, locally for hls.js.\nSome of the problems has to do with the logic and assumptions for the labels and badges.\n1. Like captions, it's possible that a video source don't represent a \"quality\", but rather an option, like hardcoded captions, audio description and such (like philipgiuliani already stated and worked to improve). Hls and dash also has support for audio tracks, which might cover some of the. Mp4 probably does too, but native HTML5 video has no way to switch them afaik.\n2. For streaming it's also likely that there are duplicate resolutions, with different bitrates.\n3. In addition, there could be duplicate resolutions with different frame rates.\n4. \"720p\" or \"1080p\" is often used for wider formats, as if they were padded to 16:9. I think this is unofficial, but useful.\n5. \"2K\", \"4K\", \"5K\" and \"8K\" are mostly correlating with the width (not height), where 2K is near 2000px wide and 8K is near 8000px wide regardless of the aspect ratio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8K_resolution#Resolutions). It's sort of a marketing thing and doesn't fully make sense.\nI think the most reasonable thing to do is to avoid handling this at all.\nInstead of the size property (non-standard), we could use label, and badge directly. Or data-label and data-badge.\nIt leaves more control to users and less for us to handle for HTML5.\nProviders (like YouTube) have their own API's and video formats, so we can't \"make\" them provide us with labels and badges, but since YouTube doesn't actually support switching the quality any more, and Vimeo never did, perhaps this is a problem that can be addressed later? If we make them plugins as planned we could handle it in that level.\nFor streaming, I have implemented an event that can be triggered, and Plyr will handle it and get the options. It's not something I'm ready to push yet (needs more discussion), but providing both labels and optional badges via this logic is not a problem.\nThe changes wouldn't be possible with the current quality getter/setter API (ex: player.quality = 720). > Unlike player.language I don't think player.quality is as useful of an abstraction and I wouldn't miss it if replaced with player.level = 1 for example. This would be breaking compatibility of course, just like changing the size attribute for something else.\nAlternatively, we could keep the current API and not break anything by using size and the aspect ratio (the ratio setting or player.media.videoHeight / player.media.videoWidth, or the equivalent for the container element) to get the width, or add an attribute for width. In addition adding an optional attribute label for bitrate, fps and such if users want to be have control of the label.\nThe sample HLS stream I've been using on Codepen for HLS has these levels: 422x180 (258k), 638x272 (520k), 638x272 (831k), 958x408 (1144k), 1277x554 (1558k), 1921x818 (4149k), 1921x818 (6214k), 4096x1744 (10285k)\nWhen I round the width and use the method in 4. they turn into the more familiar 360p, 540p, 720p, 1080p etc (point being it's useful to have the control to do this outside of Plyr).. Looks good! If you want to be added on the Used by section, shout out to Sam of twitter, or better yet: add a PR (not my call to make).. No worries. These were small and easy fixes, and I'm glad to help anyway :)\n\nI think v3 is working really well for my purposes so it will end up in production soon for a small online video editing service (I know it's not complete, but I really only need the ability to switch captions for now). I'm about to switch from html5 video to using HLS.js though, so maybe I'll revise that statement ;)\nI'm a little bit confused about the css. While I can \"fix\" things easily, maybe I better let you handle this since it's \"work in progress\" and I can't know your intentions (see font, settings-icon and options line-height in picture).\n(Could create an issue for this too if you want)\n\n. I'm closing this, since this is a support question for what's now an outdated version. The error you got looks like one that has been fixed. If you still need help, please upgrade to the latest version, simplify the code example to make it easier for us to understand it and go to our slack channel.\nI will try to help there if no one else does it first.. Sounds like you were looking for HTML5 media fragments. Hope you found it. https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-video-fragments-captions-dynamic-thumbnails/. The Chrome-bug was fixed. This is happening due to race-conditions and/or invalid states. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36803176/how-to-prevent-the-play-request-was-interrupted-by-a-call-to-pause-error for how to really avoid the rejection. You don't need to handle The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause() though. You can just ignore the promise. Uncaught promise rejections are not errors/exceptions, though I agree they can be annoying.\nA better solution imo would be to return the original play() event (the promise) in plyr's play method so users who would want to handle it could.. You need to provide more details or we won't be able to help you (as instructed in the issue template). Create a codepen/jsfiddle or something with the latest Plyr version and minimal code to reproduce your problem and I will try to help you.\nI'm closing the issue, but you are welcome to comment further here or ask at our slack. Fixed in 3.3.8. You could call plyr.setup() multiple times with different selectors and store in different variables, or call getMedia() to get the element from a plyr instance (and use that to get the classname or id).. :). @bleepsandblops: That's a plyr control. Vimeo doesn't have any middle button. Disabling specific controls is documented (see \"options\").\nEdit: See danaburgers response\u02c7 My bad!. Confirmed: https://jsfiddle.net/v0u5e4us/1/\nDoesn't seem to happen without invertTime: false, or in vanilla html5 or vimeo. Youtube has a related but not identical issue which is fixed but not released.. Fixed in v3.3.10. Spencer's comment is irrelevant to this feature suggestion.\nPlyr already supports soundcloud that you can use for audio (though I haven't tried it myself).\nI think audio only via youtube is a bad idea. It would require more network resources than necessary for just the audio (by a factor of something like 50-100% assuming it's using very low res video) and in addition to that use a lot more cpu. It might be convenient for content creators, but suboptimal for consumption. And what about for example youtube ads? They're audiovisual, and removing just the video is likely to lead to confusion. Click to skip also wouldn't work.\nYou can hack this yourselves though. Add a wrapper .plyr--audio, then hide .plyr__video-wrapper, make sure .plyr__controls are positioned relative or static and disable fullscreen and auto-hiding the controls (more will be needed in v3) via the optional parameter.. I'm closing this since the implementation is really custom and hard to debug, or even establish it's a bug in plyr/unhandled vimeo quirk. If you still need help with this, upgrade the code for the latest version of Plyr, simplify it so it only contains the necessary code to replicate the issue/problem, and go to our slack.\nv3.3.0 added poster support btw, so you wouldn't have to add the custom elements.. Neither of the links start playing in my tests (with you code). Rather, the loading animation is showing in a constant loop. This makes sense since the data hasn't loaded. I don't consider this to be a bug, but perhaps I misunderstood?\nTo load the current time you can play, then pause, like this:\nhttps://jsbin.com/dujonufasa/edit?js,output\nYou may also want hide/black out the container until it's loaded (and likely mute/unmute).\nAlso see #426 for a feature suggestion related to this issue.. That's strange. Can confirm that this is happening to the top video if opening the file directly in Chrome (but not Firefox). Perhaps some sort of race-condition involved.\nSeems to be very edge-case. I would try to avoid opening html files like that. Self-hosting isn't hard. At least for devs (try pythons SimpleHTTPServer or Caddy). Due to security reasons, opening html files in your browser isn't the same experience as if they were hosted. Still strange though.\nIn case that doesn't work for you, this worked for me opening directly in Chrome\njs\nplyr.setup('.vid').forEach(plr => {\n  plr.pause(); // Pausing here _shouldn't_ be necessary, but is\n  plr.on('ready', () => {\n    plr.toggleMute(true);\n    plr.seek(10);\n    plr.play();\n  });\n  plr.on('playing', () => {\n    if (!plr.seekDone) {\n      plr.pause();\n      plr.toggleMute(false);\n      plr.seekDone = true;\n    }\n  });\n});. That's because many mobile browsers don't permit autoplay or triggering play via javascript unless it's in an event listener. In particular with audio, as it's seen as intrusive. It has nothing to do with plyr, and it's not possible to circumvent unless you remove or mute the audio. The behavior is being adopted by desktop browsers too.\nRelated links:\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/07/autoplay\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/safari-11-released-macos-sierra-os-x-el-capitan/\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2017/09/14/chrome-will-no-longer-autoplay-content-with-sound-in-january-2018/. The only possible thing would be to document this if you haven't already.. Closing since this is a browser feature/bug we can't do anything about.. @Inhakki: Use version 2 (plyr.setup()) and follow the documentation for version 2, or use the v3 beta (new Plyr()) and follow the docs for v3 beta. They're separate branches here. Nothing suddenly disappeared.. @Inhakki Those look like valid plyr errors (except the third one). If you want to report them you should do so individually. Make sure that you are using the most recent plyr release (npm is recommended, but if you download from github use the \"releases\" tab and expand to show tags), search for existing issues to avoid creating a duplicate, and then follow the instructions in the issue template (specifying plyr version, browser, html5/vimeo/youtube etc).\nThe second one (503 error) is harmless I think. I've been getting it too but thought it was fixed in the latest beta releases. It is unrelated to the other errors.\nThe third on is due to vimeo limiting the free accounts I believe.\nHowever: I would recommend v2 for everyone who can't fix, report or circumvent the type of errors that you've been getting until a stable v3 is released.. @Inhakki: I commented about the [object%20Object] or in your case also \"503\" error here: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/766#issuecomment-366432238. @fietstouring See #968. I think that will remove the controls completely, while you only meant to remove the background?\nYou need the gradient in order to see the controls on white or very light backgrounds. If you remove the background you'll get this:\n\nUnless you know this won't happen, try to make the background lighter instead. Ex \ncss\n.plyr--video .plyr__controls {\n    background: linear-gradient(transparent, rgba(0, 0, 0, .15))\n}\n. There is no API or GUI for switching between captions in Plyr v2. This is being worked on for v3 (see https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/218#issuecomment-289609976) which will be alpha-released pretty soon.. .plyr__controls is the controls. If you don't want your logo to hide as the controls hide, you should add it to another element.\nBtw, github issues are not for coding help/support. It's for posting about bugs, flaws, feature requests etc that benefits the community.. If you're referring to using https://github.com/TjWallas/YouTube-Lite-Embed, that's not a good candidate for plyr (very old, not updated in 4 years and requires jQuery). The performance benefit claim is also referencing the load time for youtube using flash, which modern browsers (IE9+) don't do. The same benefits wouldn't apply today. Even besides flash, lots of things has changed since, such as browser performance optimizations and HTTP2.\nIt's also an implementation detail rather than a feature suggestion, so if some of the performance benefits would still apply there are better ways to implement the optimizations without getting the downsides of the library.. I've been thinking about this too. It's a legit concern since it's possible, and not likely something they approve of. No one is forcing you to put ads on YouTube videos though.. Plyr supports HTML5 video, which can be used for both streaming and embedding a single file depending on the source element(s) or attribute being a video file or streaming manifest.\nI don't see why it wouldn't work with wowza as long as you can get the manifest from wowza. If they're hosting the player that might not be the case. . See https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#streaming for using Plyr with streaming. The examples are outdated but it's pretty easy to update them for Plyr v3.. I'm heavily using captions and haven't seen this in any browser.\nWhich Plyr version are you using?\nIf you inspect the caption element, does it not exist, or exists but is hidden, invisible, or off screen?. Plyr doesn't use the original track element for captions as its html representation is terribly ugly and can't be styled properly.\nThis is what you should be looking for:\n\n(note: this is from the unreleased v3, but the caption css is unchanged, and this used to work for me in v2 too)\nYour plyr__captions element is empty, which it should only be if there aren't any caption at the time. I don't think this is the problem though. I think the problem is related to css or localStorage.\nAlso, I'm assuming captions would work with your html code if you removed plyr.. I don't think the vtt or html is wrong if it this works in Brackets. I think you've probably disabled it (stored in localStorage) or used css somewhere that hides it.\nCould you grab a screenshot from Brackets?\nAlso: Could you set up an example online (for example jsbin.com) with a minimal code to implement the captions.. That's not actually what I was referring to, so I guess I wasn't on to something after all ;)\nPerhaps it's a typo then, or misconfigured server. If it's really a 404 error it shouldn't be mime-type related I think, but then it also shouldn't work in Brackets (or does Brackets use it's own server?)\nIf it's mime-type related, try setting mimetype to \"text/vtt\" for .vtt files (this should be done in the server conf).. Closing since this I can't reproduce this and it hasn't been reported by anyone else.. It's impossible to tell the problem by this description, but it seems like a duplicate of #503. Please rephrase and complete the description with relevant information or close it and go to #503 if it's the same problem.. Please try setting the size on a wrapper to the video element instead of directly to the video or to the wrapper created by plyr.. The CDN didn't allow the resource to be embedded (no CORS header), but I think the poster just fixed this as I was testing.\nNothing to do with plyr.. This doesn't seem like an issue with plyr, but an issue with your phone or phones in general and how they handle video playback.\nThere used to be a special youtube app just to listen to yt while the screen was off, but it stopped working after a while.\nPlease complete the bug report by checking the checkboxes that applies. See https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/#creating-task-lists for how. You can use HTML5 <track> elements if you have subtitles in the WebVTT format. If this isn't the case you may want to handle the conversion server side.\nShaka doesn't quite play by the standard rules, so you we can't handle it like the other libraries. See #994. Thanks for the update!\nI'm not sure what that does though? Does it make Shaka Player use multiple tracks (one per language) like the other libraries (see #994). I'm guessing not?. Thanks! I'll leave this open until there's a full example of how to use Plyr with Shaka Player and captions, or if I write one myself. I prefer not to have to dig into the Shaka Player api again.. Are you sure it isn't IOS/Safari doing that? Have you tried to disable plyr (just use html5 video)?. It seem it is:\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2016/06/15/ios-10-inline-video-playback-safari/\nAnd you can override it:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/43617296/633921. There are plenty of answers to this if you just spend a short time searching. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/3ej5ua/err_spdy_protocol_error/. At this time you also have to set iconUrl to get the updated svg icon sprite containing for the settings. Ex:\njs\nnew Plyr(video, {iconUrl: 'https://cdn.plyr.io/3.0.0-beta.8/plyr.svg'});. @dacostafilipe, @sampotts, @aolko\nI've been thinking about this as well. For example, fetch was added as a plyr dependency after I initially started using it. I'm not using fetch due to the lack of some features XHR handles. It also isn't part of any of the es6/7/8-sets on polyfill.io. So when I updated it broke IE support.\nIt's beta, so these things should be expected. But it would be nice to ensure that future stable releases don't require additional undocumented polyfills. ~~If I understand it correctly eslint-plugin-compat can be used to make the build fail if the additional polyfills aren't explicitly listed in a whitelist. In that case this could be used to make the dev aware of any additional polyfill requirements introduced since last release~~ (tried it now, but the plugin is based on a limited blacklist and can't be trusted to report all or even most browser incompatibilities)\n~~This could in turn be used to document additional requirements in the changelog, release notes and main page.~~ But also possibly to maintain an always updated set of polyfills needed at polyfill.io. Blissfuljs for example does this. I think this makes it much easier for devs.\nAlternatively, building with polyfills included as suggested by @dacostafilipe makes sense too. This should be less complicated with babel, but adds more of an overhead. I'm not sure how well babel and rollup actually handles pruning unused polyfills.. @gehaktmolen: Fetch isn't used anymore.. Glad I could help :)\nForgot to mention, if someone has gotten a [object%20Object] network request error (trying to get the icon svg), then this could be due to uglifyjs. It's not really a plyr bug since the error is introduced later. It has only happened to me using uglifyjs with mangle enabled (the default) and using the minified plyr build as a source. Either using the non-minified build which is now available in v3.0.0-beta.14 as dist/plyr.js, disabling mangle or switching to uglify-es (although it's significantly slower) seems to work.. Small issue: The progress bar is growing and shrinking as the time changes. This is seemingly because the new font isn't monospace and hence digits 1 and 7 are not as wide as 0 and 8, causing noticeable jumps.\nSwitching back to the old font fixes it, but obviously doesn't look quite the same:\ncss\n.plyr--video .plyr__time {\n  font: 600 13px 'avenir';\n}\nYou can also force the new font to be \"monospace\" for modern browsers it seems (this was news to me). If I understand it correctly this can also use different glyphs within the same font (and does):\ncss\n.plyr--video .plyr__time {\n  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;\n}\nhttps://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-variant-numeric/. Nice! You've been working hard lately :) I think you have fixed all known v3 issues now? and obviously some that were present in v2 before.. Duplicate of #716 most likely. This is how HTML video behaves in mobile browsers.  https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/716#issuecomment-345351316. Fullscreen has been rewritten for the next release (v3). Not sure this in particular has been fixed, but perhaps you could try on https://plyr.io/beta/ (also see announcement and info at #766). playsinline can be added as a boolean attribute to the html5 video (in case that's what fixed it), but not youtube and vimeo I believe, and it seems like you're using youtube.\nIf this is urgent for you I would use v3 or fork v2 and try to hack it in.. BTW I've used v3 in production since september (before beta). That's not to say it's stable, but it's a viable option if you can't wait.. Looking at the css and js it appears you have modifying the default behavior and appearance quite a bit.\nWith plyr.io/demo fullscreen works on my Android (though there aren't any youtube or vimeo examples).\nYour codepen looks very broken when in fullscreen on my android. ~~I can't tell if this is plyr or implementation, but I'm guessing it's because you've hidden the plyr element~~ It's not happening in in my fork of your pen with no custom css and js: https://codepen.io/fullkornslimpa/pen/mXdQqq (if you press the fullscreen button) so I do think your implementation is causing this.\n\nAlso seems like fullscreen for ios isn't supported: https://caniuse.com/#feat=fullscreen (this is linked to from the v3 docs). I think setting both width and height to 100% !important for the video element while in fullscreen would fix these issues for reasonable browsers (except if devs add custom css to plyr-elements as well, in which case I think it's their problem). Not sure about ios/safari though.\nCurrently it seems only height is set to 100% while in fullscreen, and not using !important, so it won't overspecify inline css.. On the video element (not a wrapper)?\nTry this (you might need to add or tweak it):\ncss\n.plyr--fullscreen-active video {\n  position: initial !important;\n  width: initial !important;\n  height: initial !important;\n}\nAnd if that doesn't do it, moving any custom styling from the video element to a custom wrapper (created by you, not plyr) might.. You can get around this by importing with a subdirectory in the meanwhile. ex require('plyr/dist/plyr.js'). I will try to fix this myself, but not right now. If someone beats me to it you're welcome to ;). ~~Additional info: document.querySelector('video').textTracks[0].cues.length should be 7 for https://plyr.io/beta. It is in other browsers, but it's 0 in IE11. So this is the root cause it seems. Possibly format/mime-type related.~~\nActually according to the network tab in the \"F12\" dev tools it seems that it's not loading the vtt files at all.. Yes, VTT does work in IE11. I've also managed to get it to work now. Not sure exactly how. I'm pretty sure the only thing I did was upgrade to the latest beta version and remove some workarounds I had to use for the earlier beta. But it still doesn't work on https://plyr.io/beta which is the latest version. Nothing about the demo code looks wrong.\nI'll keep the issue open until we understand what's causing it.. If it helps, this page (uses beta 12 with #780 applied) works with IE11: https://workflow.studiotogo.com/view/59db9312345a8234c27c809b (beware the bad speech recognition). Nice detective work! Could never have guessed this was the cause.\nI think you're right that it shouldn't be Plyr's responsibility to fix IE11-specific bugs. In particular when it can be avoided by setting up a proxy.\nI still tried to \"fix\" this for the general video element outside of plyr, mainly because I could borrow code from the subtitle editor I've been working on and \"it shouldn't be that hard\". I also don't think this will have any noticeable effect on how long this specific turd browser stays around.\nCaveats:\n Must run before initializing Plyr or after player.destroy(); in the demo\n Only works in IE (also only needed in IE) and will possibly break things otherwise (or at the very least make unnecessary requests).\n Doesn't add any \"default\" caption.\n There is no event to listen for when the captions have been added (this could be added of course, but I mainly wanted to see if this could be done).\n```js\nfunction timeStringToSeconds (timeString) {\n    return (timeString || '')\n        .split(':')\n        .map(Number)\n        .reverse()\n        .reduce(function(sum, curr, index) {return sum + (curr * Math.pow(60, index))}, 0);\n}\nif (window.TextTrackCue) {\n    var videoSelector = \"video\";\n    var video = document.querySelector(videoSelector);\n    var tracks = Array.prototype.filter.call(video.children, function (child) { return child.nodeName === \"TRACK\"});\n    tracks.forEach(function (track, trackIndex) {\n        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xhr.track = track;\n        xhr.addEventListener('load', function() {\n            var track = video.addTextTrack(xhr.track.kind, xhr.track.label, xhr.track.srclang);\n        var cues = xhr.responseText\n            .split(/[\\r?\\n]{2}\\s*/)\n            .filter(function(line) { return line.indexOf('-->') !== -1})\n            .map(function(line){ return line.match(/([\\d\\:\\.]*)\\s*-->\\s*([\\d\\:\\.]*)\\s*(.+)/)})\n            .map(function(cueData){ return new TextTrackCue(timeStringToSeconds(cueData[1]), timeStringToSeconds(cueData[2]), cueData[3])});\n\n        cues.forEach(function(cue) { track.addCue(cue); });\n    });\n    xhr.open('GET', track.src);\n    xhr.send();\n    // You have to actually remove the element since it's hard linked to the empty track and otherwise you get duplicates\n    video.removeChild(track);\n});\n\n}\n```. I remember I used to have to fight IE6 for many years just not to break the layout completely, then IE7, then 9 and now 11. I get more surprised when things actually work in IE than the opposite.\nWith the plethora of useful features supported by all the other major browsers that can't be properly polyfilled like proxy, async/await, css variables and webassembly I think IE11 will be dead soon after the coming-generation web libraries/framework start taking advantage of these.. Nice!. Closing as this was fixed/released and now working also for https://plyr.io/beta \ud83d\udc4d . There is a \"hack\". Change your doctype to <!DOCTYPE html> and you'd be using HTML5. XHTML has been dead for almost 10 years now so it's about time.. This is the output I get when opening the console at https://plyr.io/beta/ then pressing play, pause and play again:\nplyr.js:271 event: play\nplyr.js:271 event: playing\nplyr.js:271 event: controlshidden\n5 plyr.js:271 event: timeupdate\nplyr.js:271 event: timeupdate\nplyr.js:271 event: controlsshown\nplyr.js:271 event: pause\nplyr.js:271 event: play\nplyr.js:271 event: playing\nplyr.js:271 event: controlshidden\n2 plyr.js:271 event: timeupdate\nplyr.js:271 event: timeupdate\nplyr.js:271 event: controlsshown\nplyr.js:271 event: pause\nSeems to work fine (Chrome 63). Also see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Media_events for documentation. I don't think it's possible that Plyr or the browser is getting this wrong, so most likely the issue is invalid.. Seems legit. I can duplicate this. https://plyr.io/beta doesn't get the \"play\" event after pausing when switching source to youtube, but https://plyr.io/#youtube does.. I'm sure summernote has a plugin api this can be added to, but it really shouldn't be added to the plyr codebase.. @volkirik Please read our guidelines (makes it easier for us to help): https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues. I think this should be a discussion, rather than suggestion/idea.\nIt's very hard to design APIs for this type of extensibility, because different users want to add different things, with various degrees of complexity, yet still want the API to be simple. Settling for one type of implementation excludes others.\nMeanwhile: You can add it by manipulating the dom after loading plyr. . Closing in favor of #1047 (which is more specific). If you have ideas / feedback, please comment there. \ud83d\udc4d . Make sure you are using Plyr v2, or use the new syntax for plyr v3-beta #766. If you need it you are welcome to PR this.\n\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#4-whats-the-status-on--\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#requesting-features-and-improvements. If your videos aren't working with browsers that you want to support, it's your own responsibility to find out what codecs and format that does. Plyr doesn't handle any of this.\n\nIt's like blaming the pen for writing a typo (not a perfect comparison).. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility. Unless you're using youtube or vimeo as sources (which you then should have specified), Plyr is just wrapping the html5 video player. Use MDN documentation (https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video#Seeking_through_media + the next section) and stack overflow for programming related questions. The top two anwsers here both work well imo: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5981427/start-html5-video-at-a-particular-position-when-loading (although the first one is incomplete, it seems you already know about the timeupdate event that can be used in order to stop).\nBtw neither of them are good for stopping at very precise moments.. I just tried it when logged in to youtube and couldn't reproduce.\nAre you behind some kind for proxy/centralized browser cache? They sometimes could mess things up by ignoring query parameters. I thought this was a problem of the past though.. Yeah, it's a different issue but at least easy to replicate.. I can't find any case when the quality change request is met. Same problem here though: https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube_player_demo Changing quality with the built in controls work, but using the api controls below doesn't.. I created a separate issue for the quality issue (#965), so please keep this to the titlebar issue (showinfo parameter being ignored). Closing as a duplicate of #976 (this issue is older but has derailed a bit).. Seems like a duplicate of #754. You should notice the actual error thrown is a big clue: Unrecognized feature: 'autoplay'\nThis error is thrown by youtube, not Plyr.\nPhones rarely support autoplay with audio unless you mute it. This is being implemented for desktop browsers as well (Chrome 64 removed support for autoplay with audio unless you visited the domain and played media before). I would never use it, and haven't gotten this issue either.\nRelated links:\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/07/autoplay\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/safari-11-released-macos-sierra-os-x-el-capitan/\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2017/09/14/chrome-will-no-longer-autoplay-content-with-sound-in-january-2018/. I can reproduce this for v2, but not v3 (https://plyr.io/beta/)\nSo I'd say it's been fixed already but not released as stable.. @mhluska It's not happening when I test at https://plyr.io/, so it may be fixed (3.3.23 isn't the latest version) or related to your browser or setup. If you get this with the latest version (currently 3.4.3) please create a new bug report and follow the instructions in the template :+1: . Fixed timeouts doesn't guarantee solving race conditions, just reduces their odds, and may break again in the next browser upgrade or even other current browsers.\n@r3oath's solution is better imo. But the API is less nice.\nAlternatively on could perhaps check isReady() before actually adding the ready listener event and instead trigger instantly when this is the case. Since js is single threaded I believe this is safe as long as the event listener is added in the same \"tick\".. \ud83d\udc4d I'm not sure my terminology is correct, but setTimeout with 0 duration will run the method on the next \"tick\" (next iteration in the eventloop), so yes. I probably over thought it by assuming ready should work retroactively, like jquery etc.\nIn retrospect I think your solution is better (less code & more consistent).. And sorry @gehaktmolen. If you would have made that timeout 0 it would been the same solution.. I think it looks good, but removing the gulp build would make the PR and git history a lot less noisy and less likely to conflict.\nMy opinions are not official though.. See: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/766. You shouldn't upgrade to major software releases and expect them to not break the API.\nChangelog etc here: #766 \nThis in particular should be of interest to you: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/beta/readme.md#javascript-1. From the documentation section I linked to:\n\"A NodeList or Array of HTMLElement - the first element will be used\"\nThis does what you want:\njs\nconst players = Array.prototype.map.call(document.querySelectorAll('.js-player'), el => new Plyr(el));. Then don't use NodeList.... #804 should fix this (throws a more specific error).. Duplicate of #628. Closing since this should be working now. See @gurupras helpful comments in #755 and #832\nIf not, comment and I will reopen it.. Please keep it in English (you seem to know enough English to use online translation and verify later).. I can't reproduce this (IE11 on Windows 10).. It works with or without fullscreen in my setup.. Closing, since this cannot be reproduced with the given instructions. Both the tooltip time (since #958) and position works in IE11, with or without fullscreen.. You probably meant to use timeupdate https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/timeupdate\nAlso, adding event listeners with a generic event listener method such as on is pretty much the gold standard of event listening, and a lot more efficient than adding specific ones per event (edit: I may have misunderstood the comment above).. The docs:\n\n\ntimeupdate\nThe time indicated by the element's currentTime attribute has changed.\n\n\nprogress\nSent periodically to inform interested parties of progress downloading the media. Information about the current amount of the media that has been downloaded is available in the media element's buffered attribute.\n\n. It happens to the best of us!. Seems more like it's failing to initialize (javascript). Please read the Plyr 3 documentation for how to use Plyr 3. The api has changed.\nIf you still won't get it to work, check the console for errors. It could be that polyfills are missing or you have encountered a bug.\nIf the javascript works but not the css the result would look very broken with large unstyled icons and not at all browser default.. Update: I read this too fast, so ignore my previous comment. The PR submitted is a fix for this.. @thetre97 Make sure you are using the latest Plyr version. If it still happens, please create a new issue with a code example how to reproduce it (since it's not been known to happen to anyone else).. Does this happen on the plyr demo? I haven't seen this error myself and I have tested with IE11.\nYou've done a great job finding and describing issues btw. Perhaps you could create pull requests for this and #821? You have pretty much done the work already.\n(I'm not the maintainer, just an opinionated contributor trying to help). You don't have to think of PR's as definite, but more of a dialogue. @sampotts and contributors can review and comment, and you can address feedback by pushing new commits to your branch or rebase it. In addition, having those commits in the repo means you are credited for your work (boosting your github profile is useful for job applications for example).\nIf you decide to do PR's, try to change as little as possible (like your comments), and don't include the gulp build.\nThanks either way! :). @MBWebTechMariusz. Could you check if this still happens? I think Sam fixed it in https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/commit/05b8e8a6e0ed260801a4fe21f10656e86a47f8fd (v3.0.3).. Alright. Thanks for the quick update!. Are you sure though? I just tried using the demo with Ie11/Win10 (player.currentTime = player.currentTime) and this didn't throw any error.. Yeah, I'm getting a couple of non-critical errors in IE11 as well.. I think this should be fixed by now (v3.3.9). I can't reproduce the issue on the demo, which has clickToPlay. Your use case example makes sense, and should be fairly easy to support. But it's very likely people have relied on the current behavior (at least if this wasn't introduced recently), which would make this a breaking change.\nnew Plyr(video, {controls: []}) should take you most of the way once #868 has been merged or fixed in some other way. You might also want to disable clickToPlay.\nSince running without controls hasn't been well tested I wouldn't be surprised to see more issues.. I'm not getting this on the demo, and have never seen it. And I'm using El Capitan and the same Chrome version.\nIf you haven't, please try the demo in an incognito tab. That disables most extensions.. Strange. The issue is marked as fixed, but I guess it's something similar at least. Thanks!. This is a browser feature. Nothing Plyr or Vimeo can do. Disabling or muting audio should make it work. For more details see https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/716#issuecomment-345351316. I'm surprised your pseudo-autoplay works. This makes it not quite the same issue since it wasn't initiated by a gesture, and in turn perhaps there is something either Plyr or Vimeo could do to avoid this.. BTW: https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17150870/google-chrome-autoplay-videos-sound-mute-update\nUpdate: Found a better link. Yeah. I'm not really a fan of MEI. It's a \"but it works for me\" blindspot that devs will not get issues with, but end users will. Also, it isn't really the issue you are having of course, but I thought you should know.. Closing this as the creator hasn't elaborated on the question. In case one of the option parameters passed to new Plyr() fails during some specific conditions, please create a new issue for this with the details to replicate it.\nIf you have questions or need help, ask them in our slack.. You haven't provided any relevant information to help you (plyr version, media source, when and how you are initiating plyr vs fancybox). Create a minimal jsbin/codepen-example to replicate the issue, or at least I won't bother to help you.. You're not using Plyr though. You're creating a function players that would initiate Plyr if you executed it, but this is never done.\nThe actual issue might be some fancybox feature. Running players() seems to \"fix\" it.. There really isn't any api for this. You can't list the quality options or set the quality after load. The only thing they support is setting the quality on load for pro members, but not switching it later. There is a css hack you can use for tricking the iframe that its viewport size is actually bigger than it is (see #965) but it's a hack and may not produce good quality. It would be extra risky for vimeo since it could reveal their own captions element.. I renamed this to clarify it's only for vimeo. Will change it back in case I got that wrong?\nAlso, the default behavior should probably be pad, not stretch (which is how I interpret the suggestion).. Should be fixed by 333435a if not sooner. Comment if not and I'll reopen it. Reduced test case:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/ERJKmM?editors=0011. I also like adding delegated (\"ajax safe\") event listeners and think this should be working.\nI tried understanding why this is happening but couldn't quite follow the logic in stack traces and listeners.js, which is actually quite complex.\nWith play, it's happening in these two places:\n```js\n        // Run default and custom handlers\n        const proxy = (event, defaultHandler, customHandlerKey) => {\n            const customHandler = this.player.config.listeners[customHandlerKey];\n            const hasCustomHandler = utils.is.function(customHandler);\n            let returned = true;\n        // Execute custom handler\n        if (hasCustomHandler) {\n            returned = customHandler.call(this.player, event);\n        }\n\n        // Only call default handler if not prevented in custom handler\n        if (returned && utils.is.function(defaultHandler)) {\n            defaultHandler.call(this.player, event);\n        }\n    };\n\n```\n```js\n        // Proxy events to container\n        // Bubble up key events for Edge\n        utils.on(this.player.media, this.player.config.events.concat([\n            'keyup',\n            'keydown',\n        ]).join(' '), event => {\n            let detail = {};\n        // Get error details from media\n        if (event.type === 'error') {\n            detail = this.player.media.error;\n        }\n\n        utils.dispatchEvent.call(this.player, this.player.elements.container, event.type, true, detail);\n    });\n\n```\nAccording to stack traces pause (which is also duplicated) doesn't go through the proxy.\nkeyup and keydown doesn't bubble at all in my tests, which isn't what this particular part of the code reads like to me.. I see. So I guess this in turn means useCapture won't behave as expected, but also that it isn't needed to catch the the events from the root element. I don't like it either, but I can certainly live with it. :/. Prefixing would break current listeners. I think the easiest thing that could be done without breaking or introducing a new setting (and the added complexity, maintenance and testing that comes with it) is to flag the CustomEvent so you could filter them out (if needed).\nFor example event.syntheticBubble = true.\nSince this is primarily in your interest, perhaps you could create a PR?\n(Sam is the maintainer and calls the shots. I just like to keep the ball rolling). I'm pretty sure namespaces were added by jquery's event handling, but not how.\nIf I understand it correctly useCapture isn't affected by whether or not events \"bubbles\". Since capture goes in the opposite direction this is considered a different thing.. I suggest you go with that then. At least for now people have this issue to help them in case others run into the same problem, but since it's not been brought up before it's probably not a common use case.\nI think this should make the v4 wishlist/candidate roadmap however (though there probably isn't any).. No, Thank you! It's a valid concern imo (again, my opinions are not official).. #866 fixes this for html5, but not vimeo. Youtube presently only supports speed I believe, so it can't be tested.. Great! It does work as expected for my current use case now anyway :). No, you're right. It doesn't!. I managed to get it working for vimeo, but not youtube (as you foresaw). I'm also not sure the initial change to put it in the main constructor was  good idea as opposed to putting it somewhere in the html5 helper, vimeo and youtube respectively.\nIn addition to this, the demo doesn't like it when I toggle from one the other options to html5 video (settings icon disappears), which indicates it's not the right place.\nDon't be afraid to close the issue, since I may not be on the right track. Perhaps checkMenu should be split up in initiate (before all data is available) and verify (once it is)?. Moved it to ui.build and fixed another symptom (typeerror) of the same unsupported use case. It now works perfectly for html5 video/audio, but the behavior is unchanged for vimeo and unknown for youtube (unless I'm mistaken, youtube settings only support speed currently so it can't be tested).\nTo replicate the vimeo issue, settings must contain captions, but not speed. Then the settings icon doesn't show up (like before).\nFor vimeo, this is the same as the current behavior (without the error), so it's not a regression. I haven't had the time to dig deeper so I think it's better to merge this (if you approve) and leave the issue open.. Or inside toggleTab perhaps. I thought about that but forgot about it.. Is that an error or a warning? It's only used for sliders in Safari, and it's set with JS once needed.. If it fails completely, I think you should be able to change this for postcss customProperties by disabling strict. I'm not sure though, and I understand if you don't want to.. I added a PR since this seems trivial to fix. If merged I believe it will close the issue. In case it doesn't really fix it for you please reopen the issue.. I'm not going to attempt to fix this until it's been discussed, since I'm not clear on how to fix it or if it should be fixed at all.\nOne possibly strategy could be to initiate HLS.js in an event listener for the load event (which may also require triggering it depending on race conditions). I didn't actually test this.. video.src / video.currentSrc is a blob URL\nEx: \"blob:https://example.com/5039ad07-9adc-471a-8e04-713331a8e350\"\nThere are probably other ways, but this works without having access the the hls instance, and I guess if your url is a blob media.load() would have the same destructive effect even if you're not using hls.js.. Awaiting an official solution, this could be used as an alternate css hack for showPosterOnEnd without changing any Plyr code directly:\nCSS\ncss\n.plyr__video-wrapper .poster {\n  display: none;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  background-color: black;\n  background-size: contain;\n}\n.plyr--stopped .plyr__video-wrapper .poster {\n  display: block;\n}\nThen run something like this after initiating Plyr\njs\nArray.from(document.querySelectorAll('.plyr video[poster]')).forEach(video => {\n  video.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', `<div class=\"poster\" style=\"background-image:url(${video.poster})\"></div>`);\n})\nPlyr could use something similar imo. Perhaps toggling on/off should be strictly js though, ~~and I guess it would be the usual issues with youtube and vimeo requiring separate solutions from html5~~ (it's HTML5 only). In addition to this, keeping the poster in sync with the poster property would require some MutationObserver work, but I think this might be overkill.. Nice! I updated the codepen to 3.3.0 and resetOnEnd (and actually added a poster). It worked perfectly. player.stop() still has the same effect tough. Perhaps the reason stop does media.load() (at least it did) is to show the poster as well?. Works great!\nI'll close this then :) As I remember it media.load() is still used in a couple of other places (like changing the source), but none that can be avoided. Nothing you would expect to work with hls.js anyway.. It seem to me like this isn't really in the Plyr domain (the array you're looping through contains html element, not Plyr instances). Could you try to simplify this to focus more on the issue (if any) and less on your implementation?\nAlso: Autoplay with unmuted audio is a bad idea. Next major Chrome version won't support it, and mobile browsers doesn't support it now.. playing isn't an html5 video property. Replace player.playing with !player.paused\nAlso, you could simplify the toggling:\njs\nif (!player.paused) {\n  player.muted = !player.muted;\n} else {\n  console.log('no conditions satisfied');\n}. Oh, you're right. I thought I used the button, but mush have pressed esc subconsciously. Both methods are in the code, but it seems the wrong one is triggered when not using prefixes.. @cloudratha It's in master, so it's going to be in the next version (3.1.1), probably due very soon.. I couldn't reproduce this with currentTime and html5 video (but can with your codepen). I also don't think your second comment is quite correct. currentTime shouldn't change state. If it does, it's likely because of an event listener kicking in.. Youtube seems to set the state to video cued (5) by default until you play. If you play and pause, it will become paused (2), but it doesn't seem like you can pause it directly from video cued (5). It should, but unless I read it wrong the actual behavior doesn't seem to follow the documentation.\nThe reason this matters is youtube's seekTo() starts playing unless the state is paused (2). Reopening since it seems like I reintroduced this in #1021, but only when ads are enabled (like on the demo).\nToo many moving parts for my sanity... \ud83d\ude1e. I think that size combined with multi-line cues is more than the css hack can handle, but maybe Sam has some tricks up his sleeves.\nIf you meant the actual size, it is ok imo. I wouldn't want it much smaller anyway. If you do you can change it with css. Perhaps it could be positioned closer to the bottom with small iframes/viewports.. It's not possible to get cues via the Vimeo API unless you enable captions and use the change event. If you enable them it's not possible to hide them safely. The css hack which is currently used doesn't work for all resolutions.\nSo I would say no, it's not something that can be fixed.\nYou can disable captions, not use Vimeo, or use their own player.. To me this seems like a complicated way to end up not knowing what the type is anyway. Would rather have it switching the type consistently to string, or not enforcing a type. Then instead adapting getBadge() and any other places relying on quality being a number.\nPS: I'm not the maintainer, so you may want to wait for Sam's opinions. @jacoz126 Learn how to solve your own problems instead of being our problem.. That's because that way doesn't work with named modules I think.\nhtml\n<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.3.5/require.js'></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.plyr.io/3.1.0/plyr.js\"></script>\n<script>\nrequire([\"Plyr\"], function () {\n  console.log('3.1.0', arguments);\n});\n</script>. I'm also not that well acquainted with requirejs. I tried searching for \"requirejs external named modules\" for example, but with no luck. This strikes me as a pretty basic use case, but still nothing. If requirejs still has a decent number of users out there, you could probably find help on stackoverflow and similar places.\nThis should work too:\njs\nrequire([\"https://cdn.plyr.io/3.1.0/plyr.js\"], function () {\n  require([\"Plyr\"], function () {\n    console.log('3.1.0', arguments);\n  });\n});\nFeels like a hack rather than a solution though.. Yes, It's ridiculous. I'm using a third party library \"screenful\" only to avoid handling this myself.. It's still happening I'm afraid (can be replicated at https://plyr.io/)\nI can't reopen though.. That's really strange. I'm using Chrome v65.0.3325.181 on os x El capitan, and have force-reloaded Plyr (disabling cache).\n\n. I didn't notice until your screenshots that the icon is wrong as well, so not just the tooltip.. I can probably look at it though. If I'm in a minority of users getting this it shouldn't be critical (even more so at these tooltips are disabled by default).\nI'm stuck since I have customized my keyboard conf and Sierra broke support for the app, so you have a free tester for El Capitan ;)\nIf I change aria-pressed to true it works btw, but I guess you figured that wasn't the problem.. Karabiner indeed! I have a complete custom layout (general letter key layout, special chars, combinations, dual role keys, etc). It started off as this \"I like vim, but I want to tweak it some, and be able to use the layout everywhere\"-idea but It's hard to justify the time I spent on tweaking it, learning it or things like this. I know about Karabiner Elements, but haven't been able to use it. \nSeems like I've missed out on some updates recently though, so hopefully I'm wrong and can actually make the switch.. Yes, it's still happening to me (force-reloaded with cache and adblockers turned off and it's still happening in both Firefox and Chrome). It was reported in slack #general by someone else and my response was basically \"Are you sure?\" until he made me test it.\nIt doesn't break playback at least.. Assuming you mean \"controls are not showing\". If this is the case I've submitted another issue and PR that relates to this.. Sorry. I should have been more clear. The other issue relates to this, but I never actually tested toggleControls() with my commit. I had a look at it now, and it didn't fix things. The logic in toggleControls needs to be rewritten to be used externally. Many conditions and things don't add up.. This should works in the meanwhile (also takes a boolean as a second argument if your browser isn't IE):\njs\nplayer.elements.container.classList.toggle('plyr--hide-controls');. It does work (try it on plyr.io). If not, try make sure player is the plyr instance and perhaps try some alternative options.\nplayer.elements.container is the plyr container element which you can get in other ways though.\nEx:\njs\ndocument.querySelector('.plyr').classList.toggle('plyr--hide-controls');. Fixed in v3.3.8. I just tested with that video, and it's working fine. Didn't need to specify any mimetype either since the server does.\nReplicate the issue online using something like jsfiddle or codepen, or we won't be able to help you. Also minimize the code and remove anything unrelated to the issue when you're doing this.. The error (cors) is not a Plyr error and is printed in the dev console. If it's the same you're getting normally that is (check the console for your original environment).\nYou can test it with browser extension such as CORS Toggle. I've never heard of or seen any \"Detach\"-button. The word \"Detach\" doesn't exist in the Plyr codebase. Probably some native browser feature or addon that you have installed?. For future reference, the feature is called \"video popout\". Opera users can disable it. Devs can't.. This is likely an implementation issue. Plyr 3.1.0 works great in IE11.\nMake sure you are using the polyfilled version (https://cdn.plyr.io/3.1.0/plyr.polyfilled.js) or are using polyfill.io as documented.. Yes indeed. It was mentioned in the changelog upgrade instructions :). @MichaGue Please read and follow the guidelines and, then use the templates to get started. They should work in IE.. @MichaGue This is not the place for support questions. Please follow the instructions in the document I linked to.. Very helpful report!\nThis line is the issue (rounding, not flooring):\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/ffd265d0ae5fc146cb56aa1f99026fd2f98ff529/src/js/plyr.js#L449\nIt's happening after:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/ffd265d0ae5fc146cb56aa1f99026fd2f98ff529/src/js/plyr.js#L444-L446\nSo it's really easy to fix.\nI don't understand why we need .toFixed(4) there at all, but I guess we could move the order of these or replace toFixed with something that only rounds down.. Briefly looked at the code and think everything is working as it should. Looks like your code is initiating Plyr multiple times per element, not Plyr.. Looks solid. I don't have any IE10 testing setup any longer, but MDN confirms it. Maybe you could make this a PR?. Only maintainers can create new branches. To create a PR as a non-maintainer you fork the repo, push your changes to a new branch and press \"New pull request\" from your branches list next to the branch you want to PR.\nYou can also just browse to the correct file and make the changes in the github text editor, which will fork Plyr and create a PR for you, but this way is probably best to only use for documentation changes since you can't test before.. Seems like relatively many have been experiencing this. Are all those factors (Angular, iPhone and YouTube) needed to replicate this? @yuriykuzin said he can't offer a minimal example to reproduce this, but maybe someone else have additional info?. Added the invalid tag until this has a minimal replication link. We have enough work fixing and improving Plyr, so we prefer not to put our efforts into replicating issues in environments, devices or other conditions we don't use. See the contributing document for more info.\nWill keep it open though.\nAs for the code posted, I'm not sure it fixes the issue or just silences the error. If this is for the native fallback with no Plyr controls then I think adding a condition for this.supported.ui will fix the problem.\nThanks for understanding, and reporting the issue :). I'm not Sam, but have you tried going to plyr.io and running player.fullscreen.enter() in your developer console? If it works (which it should), then the issue you are having is not likely with plyr.. That workaround would only work in some browsers, and you also wouldn't get any of the controls even when it does work.. > How can I specify the \"Progressive Enhancements\" in the HTML without specifying a video at startup \nIt's the same thing, so you can't. . No. You need a user interaction to get it to start playing https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes. I don't see why not. I would try running setInterval from the user interaction event and listen for right evens (focus and blur on window I think, but not sure) to trigger pause and play.\nIn general I don't think this is desirable or a good idea, but your use case might warrant for it.. I'm closing this since you're asking about browser behavior you can simply test to find out and learn. There's nothing inherent in Plyr causing it.. This is most likely an implementation (custom css) issue. Since it's not happening on plyr.io. I also haven't ever seen it happen (working with many aspect ratios). You need to put up a code playground (like jsfiddle, codepen etc) for this to be considered \"replicated\".\nI'm closing the issue, but you can still comment. I will reopen if you do that and it turns out to be a Plyr issue.. Nice write-up!\nI'm guessing you're in a better position than anyone to make these changes and have them reviewed. The elements are being created in controls.js using methods in utils.js. See for example createRange, createProgress. It seems to be mostly about adding properties, which is really not that hard. At least compared to creating your own alternative to plyr.. This is a duplicate of #876. Fixed in 3.3.8. That's Plyr v1.6.20. The latest version is 3.2.0. There's also an undocumented build with the polyfills bundled (this is arguably worse for performance as it downloads them for everyone, not just for old browsers).\nIf you're using the cdn the url is https://cdn.plyr.io/3.2.1/plyr.polyfilled.js. If you're using npm it's plyr/dist/plyr.polyfilled.js. You want to merge plyr v3 into v2?. Related to #883 (possibly the same issue). Doesn't seem like a problem on https://plyr.io/ though?. Please verify that you're using the latest plyr version, and if so, could you replicate the non-working state with an online snippet editor such as jsfiddle/codepen/jsbin etc? :). Neither worked in my tests. Anyway, this isn't related to npm or node.js. Your bundler (parcel.js) converts your import/require statements into bundled code, so if there is an issue there, it should be because of parcel.js, codesandbox or their dependencies. However, it would be very strange if this somehow caused an error just to this part of the code, rather than crashing things completely.\nSo I think the cause is likely something else or a combination of factors.. Yes, in Chrome 65 everything worked apart from event.detail.plyr for me.\nBabel seems more likely to be the culprit imo. In particular if the CustomEvent polyfill differs in some significant way. I'm not getting this in my local setup with the normal non-minified build with buble, brunch and polyfills.io.\nThanks for the info so far!. No need to close though (sorry if I scared you into it with technicalities). It's a valid issue and very well described now. :)\nThe utils.is.plyr-method uses  window.Plyr internally, which breaks event.detail.plyr when using loading Plyr as a module rather than global.\nIt's not as straightforward to solve as it might seem unfortunately, as the plyr class isn't available in that scope. Might have to resort to duck typing, or using es6-symbols (overkill imo). Either way I'll leave it for @sampotts to decide.. Have you checked that the response mimetype is the same with your local server as the cdn?. I had a related (perhaps a variant of the same) issue just now in Firefox, missing some of the SVG icons on one specific domain.\nI had 11/14 icons. One of the missing ones was the settings icon. Not sure about the other 2.\nTested with:\njs\ndocument.querySelectorAll('#sprite-plyr svg symbol').length\nIt turned out to be because I had an outdated svg cache in localStorage. Clearing localStorage fixed it, so it wasn't really a Firefox issue. I just got it in Firefox since I hadn't been using Firefox with that server for a while I guess.\nPersonally I'd rather avoid using localStorage like this since it never expires. The regular browser cache should handle xhr requests as well, unless I'm missing something? Alternatively we could also store the Plyr version and invalidate the cache when the version doesn't match. Otherwise this would happen every time we add or rename an icon (which isn't very often though).\nI used Plyr v3 pre-beta though, so this might be an issue more patient user wouldn't have gotten.. I see. That makes a lot more sense than just using it for caching. But in that case the invalidator must not work in Firefox, as reloading the page should have solved it?. Seems like the Storage object works like that, but utils.loadSprite() is using localStorage directly to get and set. localStorage.setItem('cache-sprite-plyr', '{}') (deliberate attempt to break the cache) will remove all icons until you remove cache-sprite-plyr. This could be the issue the author is having. Not {} obviously, but perhaps the localStorage key matches but the svg names doesn't, the build was cached before gulp had completed or something like that.. I'll try to fix the localStorage issue soon, if no one beats me to it. Will then consider this issue fixed, unless someone shows the opposite.. This should be fixed by now. If not, let us know.. Thank you for the report!\nI don't have the device to test this, but answering these question might help you (or the next person):\n\nDoes your video have the playsinline attribute?\nDoes it only happen to Chrome ios, not Safari?\nDoes any of the suggestions in the other ios fullscreen issues seem to fix your issue?\nCould you try to replicate this in an online code playground like codepen or jsfiddle?\nCan you attach a screen shot of the result?. > I need help with progressive enhancement. I'm trying to get a sense of what this is right now, but currently, I have no idea on what it is or how it's implemented in the code.\n\nProgressive enhancement is similar to a \"fallback\", but instead of checking if the fallback is needed and applying it, you start with the fallback and add the improved behavior later when possible.\nFor Plyr, this means you add the provider's own embed code inside your custom element.. Looks like it initialized perfectly. But you probably don't want to use Plyr without the css.... I'm not sure what \"Be able to use plyr with server-side rendering\" means. Isn't it the opposite behavior you want? Plyr detecting that the environment isn't client and returning some kind of dummy object with noop methods in order not to break the build?\nIt's likely that whichever framework/library you're using exposes the environment so you could conditionally opt out of initializing Plyr in the SSR phase.\nIf you're using React this should help you: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate Also in this case https://github.com/xDae/react-plyr seems to handle this already (https://github.com/xDae/react-plyr/issues/1).. Thanks for the clarification! I didn't realize that.\nPlyr wasn't built to be modular to begin with, but rather converted. Wrapping defaults in a function should solve the module import issue (although it might be needed in more places).\nWould that suffice for both of your needs, or  do you also need to be able to initialize it? . I'd say go for it, but @sampotts is the judge of that.. The PR was just released in v3.3.8. This is documented on the github page.. I tried to replicate the issue by copying the settings argument from the demo to my testing server, but it's still not happening there (possibly because I can't actually use Sams publisherId for the ads).\nSo this doesn't seem to be happening in IE11 in general, but rather with the demo configuration.. I've done some testing:\nSince 3.1.0:\n Issue running multiple plyr instances\n The controls don't show on hover (for html5 video with source elements)\nSince 3.2.0\n Big play button isn't hidden (for html5 video with source elements)\n Click to play doesn't work (for html5 video with source elements)\nMost of the issues happen only if you use the <source> element rather than src property on the video element. So only for vanilla html5 video (no streaming).\nReplication\nhttp://jsbin.com/fibowawaju/1/edit?html,js,output shows all these issues.\n Change the plyr version in the cdn links to v3.0.6 for both the js and css to make both videos work or 3.1.0 to make some of it work again.\n Remove the first video to make the second work for 3.1.0+. Plyr should be fully working in IE11 again in v3.3.9 (just released). Make sure you have added the URL polyfill, like in the link above ^ if you are still getting issue.. So, you're not getting this \"radio input\" style?\n\n. Please don't lump together separate suggestions or issues. If you want them done, create separate issues for separate issues/suggestions, and if not just don't bring them up.\nAs for the main issue, you seem to be on the case yourself so I'll leave you to it. \ud83d\udc4d . By the sound of it, wouldn't that also toggle the class on if you pause it, and move the progress slider to 0:00?. Something that would benefit a lot from testing is the different events and states. I've been working to improve this in a recent PR, but haven't got a full picture other than that it's still lacking (not consistent and/or following the standards). HTML5 obviously is pretty spot on (except the progress event since the w3c spec pretty much leaves it up to interpretation). YouTube and Vimeo aren't though. The Plyr progress \"slider\" doesn't pause when you seek like native browsers do http://jsbin.com/jutiveyefa/edit?console,output, and also doesn't set currentTime before the seeking event for youtube and vimeo.\nIt's also super easy to get it wrong, and hard to \"proof read\" the entire debug log. And it may still come off as \"working\" unless you test very thoroughly.\nI think the tests could also be reused, since the same should apply regardless of provider (html5, vimeo, youtube), and in the future with plugin support it should be really helpful to plugin developers too.. > Could you expand on this perhaps? What standards?\nHTML5 media events (since we're mainly using the same events now) \n\nhttps://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/media-elements.html#mediaevents\nhttps://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/media-elements.html#seeking (there is a 14 bullet list for seeking).\n\nThe w3c specs are quite detailed with the order of the events and states etc. The MDN docs only covers the basics.\nI mainly noticed the order being wrong for the play/pause events and the paused state, and seeking and currentTime. There might not be that much more, an I'm sorry to come off as critical to your work. The main point is without tests I wouldn't consider to \"know\" this or \"have a complete picture\". I think adding tests for this will reveal some blindspots, like when you first started using static code analysis (linting). And I think it's also super easy to accidentally break the events without tests.\n\nPersonally I think is the naming is a little strange and trips people up but it's consistent with XHR. Other than the name it works fine IMO. It's fired periodically as data is downloaded. How would it be improved?\n\nOur current event handler for the buffer progress (which also handles some other ui update) is listening for playing and progress. If progress was triggered consistently as the media is buffered this wouldn't be needed, and these could be separated. For vimeo progress is also triggered  falsely (as mentioned in that thread).\n\nIt's not something we have control over anyway and getting the browser devs to fix even minor bugs is painful at best. I've been trying to get Safari to fix a bug where custom styled  elements are constantly redrawn after interaction and getting no where. You'd think wasted CPU/GPU cycles would be an issue?!\n\nNo, I mean we should \"fix\" the inconsistencies on the event level in our provider objects. In the worst case scenario we can use setInterval and trigger event on changes for example (like for youtube).\nAnd I do think wasted CPU/GPU cycles is something they care about. I couldn't comprehend the insane amount of work they have to deal with.\n\nIn this case though, would this be pause on mousedown/touchstart and then set currentTime and play on mouseup/touchend?\n\nYes. That way the handle won't get pulled away as you're dragging it and you won't get the clippy audio sounds.. @mhluska Your fix will be included in the next plyr release. In the meanwhile you have to keep that in your css \ud83d\udc4d . ~~If that really is the error it seems like the app runtime doesn't have the global window object, but strangely still has navigator. Same culprit (utils.is.plyr()) as #926~~ Ignore that, read the error as get while it was set.. Also, there have been many bug fixes since 3.0.0 so use the latest version when checking and reporting issues.. Updated answer:\nPlyr is only referenced twice by name in the Plyr code. Once when the module is created and once for checking if the instance passed in a plyr instance. Neither should cause this error. If the first fails you wouldn't be able to use Plyr at all, and the second is getting Plyr, not setting. The error is almost certainly in your implementation.. plyr.setup() is for v2. It doesn't exist any more. Read the updated docs andthe changelog for v3 breaking changes. Closing this until it's been established there is an issue in v3 with a code example to go with it.. Does this happen on the plyr demo https://plyr.io/? Didn't get this myself but there is a similar error logged recently https://sentry.io/plyr-js/demo/issues/550854898/?referrer=slack (which only Sam can see).\nI'm getting a different error \"Unable to request ads from server due to network error\".. Don't take it personal. The ads called me that as well. It's a minified error so it means pretty much nothing. If you expand it it will say \"The ad response was not understood and cannot be parsed\" or \"Unable to request ads from server due to network error\" or something.. > Using contain won\u2019t stretch a smaller image \nIt does actually. You can try it yourself.\nFrom the MDN docs:\n\nIf the background-size is contain or cover:\nWhile preserving its intrinsic proportions, the image is rendered at the largest size contained within, or covering, the background positioning area. If the image has no intrinsic proportions, then it's rendered at the size of the background positioning area.\n\nYou may be confusing it with auto, which works similar to contain but doesn't scale up.. If you by \"stretch\" mean scale up that is. Otherwise I'm not sure how to interpret the comment.. Should be fixed in 765c01e (credit to Sam). To fix before this task: #883 #937. ~~I'm not getting this with the plyr demo (https://plyr.io/#youtube) with Chrome 66 on a Mac. Are you getting the issue on the demo?~~. Correction: It's happening on the demo as well.. You can click the time (after pressing play or seeking) in order to show the current time instead of the remaining time. Anyway, you're right, and It's happening on the demo too. My head was just too deep into another task in order to test this properly.\nThanks \ud83d\udc4d . I think it's a rounding error. The diff gets bigger the further to the right you click, and it's happening for html5 and vimeo too.. Fixed in v3.3.8. This is a feature in Chrome that we can do nothing about. You could try muting it or setting the volume to 0.\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes. Now you just have to tell all you users to do that ;). Could be your event is triggered too soon. Why DOMContentLoaded? Codepen already handles that for you.\nIt doesn't happen on https://plyr.io/ right?. > I don't think it's related. Most of the time, you have to wait for the DOM to be ready before running scripts.\n~~It may not be, but I wanted to exclude a race condition (since DOMContentLoaded is only triggered once). If the event isn't triggered you would get the result you describe.~~\nNo, wait. I thought you got the original iframes, but since you didn't include them it can't be that, meaning Plyr is initiated.. Our FAQ now addresses autoplay: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#5-autoplay-and-scripted-play-doesnt-work-in-some-browsers, but when it fails, the play button should still be showing, so if this still happens it's still an issue.. You're on the right track, but you need to load the source in the play event iirc. I'm not at home right now, but I can answer later. . This should work (also falls back on native hls if hls.js isn't supported and regular video fallbackUrl if neither are):\n```js\nvar hlsUrl = 'https://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/vM7nH0Kl.m3u8';\nvar video = document.querySelector('video');\nif (Hls.isSupported()) {\n    var hls = new Hls({autoStartLoad: false});\n    hls.loadSource(hlsUrl);\n    hls.attachMedia(video);\n} else {\n    var nativeHLS = video.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl');\n    video.src = nativeHLS ? hlsUrl : fallbackUrl;\n}\nvideo.addEventListener('play', function() {\n    hls.startLoad();\n}, {once: true});\nnew Plyr(video);\n```\nI never needed Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED since this takes milliseconds, and has already happened before users can press play, but if you want to be strict about it you should check this before hls.startLoad();.. You're welcome :) This is less than obvious imo. Had some trouble with it myself.. Haven't seen that myself. Will try it out later. The code I pasted is slightly simplified from what I actually use. . Just tested, and it works great for me testing in Safari and no errors in Chrome with exactly that code.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/Larer8ad/\nIf you need help debugging your code this is not the place.. I appreciate your attitude, but it's ultimately very time consuming to debug someone elses website, so maybe you can fork https://jsfiddle.net/Larer8ad/ and replicate your issue on jsfiddle. If it turns out to be a Plyr issue I'll reopen this.. And of course if you try to remove the new Plyr() part and the problem persists it's not a Plyr issue.. Good luck!. An alternative could be to add a hidden slider with the same size and trigger click with coordinates when hovering the visible slider. I never tried this, but from what I could read it should be possible.. You are right. I did some testing and dragging the handle is \"laggier\" or even breaks. Clicking works. \nClearly I didn't test this enough.. I changed it so the place it would previously prevent the default action, instead it sets a new property seekNext, which when present is used instead of value for the next input or change event.. > Should we update on both seeking and seeked? Otherwise the scrubber would indicate a different time to the actual time displayed?\nI really don't understand the reason for the separate update events and methods to begin with (as opposed to all the update methods listening to currentTime and update accordingly), so I primarily changed the parts I needed to make youtube work, but I may have broken the scrubber. I don't know what a scrubber is, but just noticed the initial time is shown as 0:00 for youtube now (introduced by my changes I think). Is that it?\nEdit: No, apparently that happens before my changes with invertTime: false. Yes, timeupdate of course, not currentTime. \ud83d\udc4d \nYou may have good reasons for it, but it was a bit confusing to see the intention behind it, at least for me. If you test the events you'll see some are triggered three times per change in vimeo and timeupdate isn't triggered for youtube. I only noticed after changing seeking to seeked which made timeupdate internally redundant (and then actually forgot about it).\nI see why you wouldn't want circular logic or updates that interferes with user interactions though.\n\nI'll merge this and see but really the time should update to the intended seek time. It may still do this but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nIt doesn't (only for html5 media). You'd need to set currentTime in the player.currentTime setter synchronously first and then again in the async API calls (for youtube and vimeo). I think this is a good idea too. And then 143c821 wouldn't be needed for youtube seeking, so you can revert/skip it.\n\nOtherwise the scrubber would indicate a different time to the actual time displayed? i.e. you'd seek to an unbuffered part of the video and the time wouldn't update until that part could be played. Unless I'm mistaken.\n\nYes, I'm pretty sure this is what happens. It's how it works now for html5 and vimeo (at least for seeking while paused - seeking while playing is hard to test).. > Should we update on both seeking and seeked?\nForgot to communicate that I changed this. It now does that. Except only the seeked event actually works since the time doesn't update in seeking.. > With the cloneDeep, is that faster than just doing Object.assign({}, object)? Using Object.assign seems cleaner at least.\nObject.assign({}, object) creates a shallow clone of the object: A new object with the properties of the old object copied to it. JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))\nserializes the object as a JSON string and then deserializes it, effectively creating a deep copy, which is what is needed here.\nFor example:\n```js\nconst defaults = {\n    clickToPlay: true,\n    tooltips: {\n        controls: false,\n        seek: true\n    }\n}\nconst clonedDefaults = Object.assign({}, defaults);\nclonedDefaults.clickToPlay = false;\nclonedDefaults.tooltips.controls = true;\n```\nThis will not work as intended. The original defaults will change into {clickToPlay: true, tooltips: {controls: true, seek: true}} since tooltips is an object, and objects are copied by reference in javascript.\nThis is the reason libraries like immutable.js exists.\n\nAlso, can Plyr.defaults = utils.cloneDeep(defaults); not be within the class itself? As a getter/setter or static perhaps?\n\nIt needs to be shared between Plyr instances. If it's set in the instances, you would have to create the instance first. In effect this is the same thing as the current way of passing options to Plyr. And I don't think es5 (getter/setter) would add anything.\nStatic properties unfortunately doesn't exists in javascript classes (at least yet). The functional equivalent to static methods for properties is what I just did.. > Actually they do. That article seems to be about public vs private. We already use static classes:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plyr.js#L1235\nThe static keyword is only for methods. For other properties. you have to add them to the class later.\nThe class field declarations-proposal is for both static and private \"fields\". So you could avoid declarations in constructors (this.x = false;) as well as having to set static properties to the class after it's declared (what we're currently talking about).\nAlso see https://github.com/amiller-gh/es2015-default-class-properties. > The private class properties will definitely be useful when they get introduced. It's a bit of a mess currently.\nYeah, in particular when it's the only thing you need the constructor for. I always hated that.. Good idea. I forgot about that. Will add that and rebase the last commit.. Had to make some more changes to setPoster, mainly to prevent race conditions with setting and resetting background-size. The promise also returns the poster url now, not the image created by utils.loadImage.. Great initiative to include the gif :) However, if it's not happening on the https://plyr.io/ demo (which it isn't for me in Safari) or you can replicate it on a code playground like jsfiddle or codepen, then there is nothing that says this is a Plyr issue. It could be, but it could just be your own css.\nI would use the inspector to try and figure out if an element is not getting full width, which element and why.. It doesn't mean any css is invalid. Judging by the gif I think it looks more like a browser render bug. But I would start with the inspector either way. Maybe some combination of things in fully valid css causes that, and can be avoided. @sampotts may know something since he has fixed a similar issue in the past and generally knows more about these pesky Apple quirks than I do. Native fullscreen, playsinline and whatnot.. I think you need permission to reopen it, but you can comment either way and I can reopen it if it turns out to be a Plyr issue.\nGood luck!. I have experimented with css and have been able to \"trick\" YouTube into thinking the device viewport size has changed, making it change the quality. The hack itself may blur the quality improvements gained by the higher quality though (hard to test this since YouTube tries to give you the optimal quality for your device pixel ratio to begin with). It also affects the youtube controls size, and I don't think we can use this, at least without further changes.\n\nGo to https://plyr.io/#youtube\nStart playing\nOpen developer tools \"console\"\nRun player.embed.getPlaybackQuality() (says large on my laptop, but might differ if you have a larger screen)\nRun this:\njs\nObject.assign(document.querySelector('.plyr__video-wrapper iframe').style, {\n    width: '400%',\n    height: '400%',\n    transform: 'scale(0.25)',\n    transformOrigin: 'top left'\n});\n\nIf you run player.embed.getPlaybackQuality() again, (wait a couple of seconds for the auto quality selector to pick up the change first) the output should be something different from before. In my case I got hd1440.. Probably never. A workaround with side effects is worse than no workaround imo. Also probably violates their terms.. Thanks! Actually have a PR for that already ^, but it's not updating on the right event.. This was fixed by aa8fc31. Seems like this issue was reintroduced in 3.4. It can be replicated on the demo.\nI'm no longer actively contributing to Plyr since I no longer use in in my job, so someone who does use Plyr may want to have a look at this. I doubt it's hard to fix.\n(Accidentally closed the issue - sorry for the noise). You can test a PR locally without merging. I use git-extras (recommended since it's very easy to switch and not much to learn) which has an alias git pr for it or this way without git extras.\nI can still put them in a branch though if you want.\n\nThe error stuff was WIP but I guess I can come back to this PR to grab that again.\n\nIt's a separate commit, so yes. You can simply revert that commit to get it back (as long as it's kept as a separate commit anyway). If there is a relevant issue for the error handling you may want to post the commit hash as a future reference.\nI'm still working on the youtube/vimeo one since the events still aren't triggered in the right order with that PR as it is now. The paused property should always be set before the play and pause events are triggered for example. Now it's set after. Should be done tonight though.. Does it happen on https://plyr.io/?. I think that's how it's intended to work with touch-devices. Tapping to stop is problematic since tap means \"show the controls\" when autoHide is enabled.\nAssigning Sam since it's his design.. Mouse and touch events are not 1:1. You can't hold/hover your mouse over the video with a touch device, so in order to show the controls when autoHide is enabled you need to reserve the tap event for that. It makes sense if you think about it.\nCould possibly make this an option or \"tap to pause\" when both the video is playing and the controls showing. You should be able to add this event too, which I think is reasonable since you're doing custom stuff.\nEdit: Seems this used to be the behavior before autoHide. @0cool-f \nEdit: Seems like I read that too fast (if mouse clicks are treated as touch interactions). That could be a separate issue.. I'm not able to reproduce this with Chrome 66.0.3359.139 OSX El Capitan. Does it happen while playing only, or also while paused?\nI'm asking since I've seen the button focus cause something similar. This would only happen while playing and if autoHide is true (which it is by default).. You failed to set up working environment (the easiest part), assumed the problem couldn't possibly be in your code, so it must be in ours, didn't provide any link or snippet so the issue could be replicated, and additionally skipped the question regarding if it's happened at https://plyr.io/ page\nIf \"the codes\" are not working for you, why would they be working for us?\nIt's just too rude and ignorant.. You can add vtt captions as html5 tracks (which hls.js ignores) for Plyr. That's your only option for now. . Plyr v3.3.10 solves most of this.\nHls.js still has some issues on their side. We can avoid some of the worst now since we no longer have to trust their events.\n(I removed my other posts since the information isn't valuable any more since fixing the main problems).. Closing in favor of #994. Seems like all of their caption files (among others) currently result in \"404 Not Found\" server errors. It happens without Plyr too. https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871. I reported it to them and the issue was just fixed/closed on their side now. The link you posted @matoni555 works fine now too :). Can't reproduce (Chrome 66 on osx). Might be a memory things?\nDoes it happen if you remove Plyr and only use html5 video?. Yeah. Plyr doesn't handle the actual low level playback (as in parsing the video, drawing each frame etc). That's all HTML5.\nNot really, but you could try restarting chrome fresh (no tabs open) open an \"Incognito Window\" (since that disables addons unless you specifically set them up for incognito too) and open the page.\nClosing since it's not really something we can fix or avoid. Good luck!. If using your own embed code you mean? Does it happen if you skip it and use only the plyr element (no progressive enhancement)?\nIt doesn't seem to happen at https://plyr.io/#youtube. Can you try what happens if you open in an incognito window?\nThere is already an issue for the titlebar showing when a user is logged in on youtube, which strangely doesn't happen to me.. Unfortunately there doesn't seem like there is much to do to avoid this. It seems to be a recent change. Googling doesn't turn up much either, except an unanswered stack overflow question.\nPerhaps dig around in your youtube settings to see if you somehow opted in for this. It seems to happen to a minority of users who are logged in.. I'll keep it open since there's useful information in here that may help others.. Yes. I'm no longer working on it. I had to do some changes and more testing, but it is very solid now in my tests. :) The only issues are on the hls.js-side.. The demo in the release download is the same as https://plyr.io/#audio, which is working great. I can also run it locally with for example python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 and then going to http://localhost:8080/demo/. If it doesn't work for you locally it's probably your server. You need the right mimetypes etc. See your console for errors.. A server is a computer (or software depending on the context). You can run server software on your PC. Anyway, it's not a bug, has nothing to do with the functionality of Plyr, and you have to figure this out on your own.. In the future, please use slack https://bit.ly/plyr-chat for questions or issues, if they're not happening on https://plyr.io, and answer the questions in the issue template if you want to create an issue here (at least when they apply).. I see.\nNo, it's not important imo. I just tried to help this user, but I actually prefer to say \"we don't support that\" and then not having to test this case either.. The poster element should only be shown when the poster image can be loaded. Are you sure the first frame isn't just black or that you didn't disabled preload for the video?. Please post a link to a code playground (like jsfiddle, jsbin, codepen etc) where this is happening. Closing until then.. I changed the base branch to develop (which is the branch for submitting PR's), but since you branched off from master it contains some of Sam's commits now. You should be able to fix this by rebasing from develop git rebase develop and pushing with force or \"force with lease.\". > It actually returns undefined when there is no match. Because object[\"unknownKey\"] will return undefined. The || {} is to prevent it from crashing when the key does not exist.\nThat's the problem though. And very easy to fix:\n```js\nfunction getDeep1(path, object) {\n    return path.split('.').reduce((obj, key) => obj[key] || {}, object);\n}\nfunction getDeep2(path, object) {\n    return path.split('.').reduce((obj, key) => (obj && obj[key]), object);\n}\nconsole.log('Test 1', getDeep1('a.b.c', {a: {b: {c: 'd'}}})); // 'd'\nconsole.log('Test 2', getDeep2('a.b.c', {a: {b: {c: 'd'}}})); // also 'd'\nconsole.log('Test 3', getDeep1('a.b.c', {})); // {}\nconsole.log('Test 4', getDeep2('a.b.c', {})); // undefined\n``. You can remove commits, combine etc with an interactive rebase (exgit rebase -i HEAD~9`), but do read up on the topic if you haven't used this before. I'm not sure it's a problem per se. It depends on Sam's merging strategy.. Yeah. Have seen that in HLS too occasionally. Like the German track in the demo ^. Not sure what's happening there.. Updated the hls.js demo to use the hls.js canary version (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@canary) since that seems to fix all the issues I had in the demo (the German captions not working and some captions not showing the first time).. This should work:\njs\nnew Plyr(video, {captions: {update: true}});\nconst track = video.addTextTrack('subtitles', 'Volap\u00fck', 'vo');\ntrack.addCue(new VTTCue(0, 3, 'Your first cue'));\nNot sure why you're doing it via the dom. It should work too, but you'll need more code to achieve this. I haven't tried for this issue, but I'm pretty sure I have done this before and it created the textTracks objects. Both plyr.media.textTracks.length and plyr.media.children.length is 0 in your demo, so something isn't working.. I see. If you have URLs rather than creating them as blobs I can see the benefit to using the dom. Either way. make sure you actually get this working without Ply first, and that video.textTracks.length and video.children.length isn't 0. Otherwise it has nothing to do with Plyr.. Neither the video nor the caption loads. You have probably installed a browser plugin like \"Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *\" or \"Cors toggle\" to override cors. \nAlso, you need to enable the textTrack:\njs\ndocument.querySelector('#video').textTracks[0].mode = 'showing'; // use 'hidden' instead of 'showing' for Plyr\nNot sure how to do that with the dom, but probably the default property.. I forked your pen, changed the sources, set default to true, and used srcLang (not language). It works: https://codepen.io/fullkornslimpa/pen/ZRBYrR?editors=1011. Plyr 3.3.12 was just released, with support for currentTrack getter/setter for the track index, in addition to still supporting the previous language getter/setter. I think that's about what we can do from our side for support with hls.js and dash.js. Shaka Player needs more, but it's outside of the scope of what I think we need to support/handle, and not a priority for me since they don't support changing tracks via the native HTML5 video controls and/or proper textTracks (#750). This may come to change if I need to switch from hls.js to Shaka Player myself, since the latter seems more stable.\nIn addition to this, I noticed dash.js didn't need to handle the languagechange event at all. I just assumed it did, coming from hls.js.\nThe Plyr documentation has been updated with the same codepen links as in here.\nWe could still use some kind of compatibility table in the wiki or main docs I think. Different providers or libraries support for captions, handling quality and other features.. Seems like it's going to 0 while buffering, then back, with Chrome desktop. Probably related.. I think this might be related to https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/\nand https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21189958/javascript-onloadedmetadata-event-not-firing-on-ios-devices (outdate)\nCan someone try this with the video being muted or preload specifically being set to metadata vs something more generous? I can't test for ios currently.. I think this is a different symptom of #857. It's happening on the Plyr side. I've known about this for a while.. If I understand this correctly the problem is that the menu is closed when you tap the Quality option instead of showing the options. Then if you tap the settings icon after that, the quality options are shown. Is that a correct description?. I'm working on multiple caption issues including this now and will push to a new PR once ready.. Youtube and Vimeo events are async.\ndestroy() restores the element to how it was before Plyr transformed it (removes event listeners and Plyr elements). It also stops the media playback. With youtube you may not have any original element (see the part about \"progressive enhancement\": https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/#youtube-embed), in which case the error may happen (not sure), or like in your case, Vue may be removing the element before stopVideo is executed in which case this may also happen.\nI'd say it's a bug on our side. We should either not stop from destroy, add an optional argument to control it, or handle errors in stop due to being called from destroy.\nYou may not need destroy though, if you're going to remove the plyr container element, and have no other references to Plyr. Event listeners and such gets destroyed along with their elements, and garbage collection kicks in when there are no more references to something.. I renamed the issue, since it's not unique to Vue.js.. It's not the same culprit, but at least both are caused by destroy().. @julmot How is that related to this issue? This is not a place for support anyway. See https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ (last question). @julmot \nYou've been told three time now that you're being off topic:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1001#issuecomment-394711506\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1001#issuecomment-394770938\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1001#issuecomment-395360193\nIn addition to that you're now being rude.\nFor other than background context, it doesn't matter for Plyr which type of frameworks and libraries you are using, unless the issue is happening specifically with one of those frameworks or libraries, and can't be reproduced without it. We already know why this issue is happening, and it was there to read before your first comment.\nPlease don't comment on this issue again. It's disrespectful to the author and subscribers who are here because they are interested in the issue.. This is not a conversion about your hurt feelings.\nTemporary locking the conversation from further comments. Sorry everyone else for the inconvenience.. @qikkeronline This type of comment is discouraged in the FAQ and contribution guidelines. Anyone has the right to fork Plyr, fix this issue and submit a PR. No one has, and afaik no one is working on it.\nI think (at least hope) my previous comment is helpful if someone wants to have a try. Speaking of \"try\", the simples solution is probably adding a try/catch somewhere in the code or wrapping your destroy() calls.\nI'm no longer helping out with Plyr development so I'm going to unsubscribe (so @mention me if you need to reach me).\nUpdate: You can dislike this all you want. Doesn't change anything.. Proposed solution:\nAdd a more specific selector for captions (or strip the html, but it's perhaps better as an option).. That should work fine too.. I'll fix this after #1000. Already have some other related changes locally.. If you find out more, please comment and or/ submit a pull request so others with the same issue can get help. Since we don't officially support WebView, or have the time or resources to support and tests every framework and environment we really appreciate community efforts for debugging and fixing these issues.. The polyfill build was fixed in Plyr 3.3.8 https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/commit/41f9a87e0ec01146fe870fa2412ef6d4004221c1 The latest version of Plyr is 3.3.10.\nMore info on polyfills and this issue:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/#javascript\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/#polyfills\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/937#issuecomment-389041306\n953 . This happens because IE11 doesn't support new URL(), so you need to polyfill URL. The polyfill build does this since 3.3.8. The normal build doesn't pollyfill anything. You need to do that yourself. See the links above.. I think this could be another symptom of the same issue described in #1001. Changing the source calls destroy(), which calls stop(). Calling stop() from destroy() is the problem in both cases as I see it. I haven't tried this though. I just read the code.. Alright! I could be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time.. Added the label \"Help wanted\". If this issue is important to you, then please help us out. We have a lot of users, but few contributors.. Thanks for clarifying that I mentioned that this is not related to #1001 and linking to my comment. I'm sure that others will find that information very helpful.\n1001 happens for YouTube (and probably Vimeo) since destroy() makes a call to stop(), which those libraries treat as an async event. There's nothing we can do about that. It's probably required since those libraries proxies an iframe with a different origin. The only thing we can do is avoid callingstop(),  or handle / avoid the error with conditions or try/catch in stop(). Since that's not the error you are having, it was better that you created a new issue. \ud83d\udc4d\nAs was pointed out in #1001, the problem looks like a duplicate of #853, which is related but not caused by or happening for the same reason.. What's chapters navigation?. I see. It sounds similar to #278, but perhaps not with the UI. I know chapters are supported by some container formats, but I haven't seen anything like it in the html5 media specs, so I don't think we can access the metadata from the video. This leaves the option to pass the chapter data as arguments to Plyr.\nI'm not sure I like the suggestion myself, as opposed to using playlists (#3), which would make it possible to provide a similar user experience. It would be useful to know why / how you need this to work or if playlists would solve it.\nAlso, I do think it's pretty easy to add this as a custom feature if you only want a button to show a list of titles and times, then when clicking a title you just set player.currentTime = time.\nEdit:\nSeems like I missed that chapters can be added as tracks: http://html5index.org/Media%20-%20TextTrackKind.html. Dom manipulation. Ex: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore. Many other people are having issues with destroy(). We should probably try to make destroy work with their usage, rather than adding a new method. There isn't any other way to enable/disable plyr, and I don't think we need it.\nSetting values in config after creating your Plyr instance isn't supported or an intended use case. It may work for some cases, but generally config isn't respected once your instance is ready.. You did read this right? https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/994\nDoes the video's textTracks property contain the tracks that you see in the language settings or is it empty?. With the #994 setup, the tracks should update when the textTracks changes, so it'd be good to know if they did. There's too much else to do right now though, like the other captions and destroy() issues, so it has to wait anyway. Maybe fixing them will fix this.\nJust added guidelines for reporting issues. The minimal replication part in particular would help if you applied to this issue.. Added the invalid tag until this has a minimal replication link (we have a too much to do, so we can't put the effort into replicating).\nHope you understand! :)\nWill keep it open though.. #1015 might fix this, but shouldn't make any difference if you did set captions.update to true.. > it updates captions in controls but the previous caption remains on screen\nAha. That should be fixed in #1015 too (which will be released soon as ~3.3.11~ 3.3.12). I changed it so it triggers the event that resets the currently showing captions, as well as the language options. In the current release it only updates the menu. Sounds like what you describe, but since I haven't gotten your issue specifically I can't be sure.. Please let me know when ~3.3.11~ 3.3.12 is out and you have tested this \ud83d\udc4d . 3.3.12 is out with the PR now. Let me know if this fixes it.. Cool! Thank you for the update \ud83d\udc4d . Rebased to remove a couple of previous commit as it turns out we didn't need (dash.js workaround) one and the other (moving the Vimeo event handling to the plugin) was causing trouble with source(). Also melded some commits.\nShould be done now. Have tested thoroughly with Vimeo, streaming libraries and some different settings, but I don't think it's possible to cover all angles.. Added the label \"Help wanted\". If this issue is important to you, then please help us out. We have a lot of users, but few contributors.. Possibly related: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/956#issuecomment-388381268. Thank you!\nI haven't looked deeply into either issue, so they may not be related, but in both cases the css \"state\" is wrong. The play and pause buttons are shown/hidden conditionally based on the existence of a class \"plyr--paused\" on the container element.\nThe fact that this is failing with autoplay, although in different ways, may be relevant to finding the issue (or it may not).. Actually just started looking at this. Since we can't fix the browser restrictions, we should make sure that this doesn't break the UI so it appears paused or playing when it's the opposite.\nAlso found a fix for this. It must never have been implemented, or Vimeo changed their events.. Or if we can use different classes (there's actually a 4000ms delay too) with animation-delay. Not sure if this is possible, but I think this is better in the css.. I don't necessarily think adding custom css is hard, or that we should add things to the config API because it's easier unless it's a common request (which this hasn't been so far).\nI don't have a strong opinion on the matter though. Your suggestion is reasonable and more straight forward to implement given what we have. Maybe PR it? I would try to find good names for all 3 delays in that case ex interactionDelays: {mouse: 2000, touch: 3000,  keyboard: 4000} (not sure this is exactly how they're being used).. That's Chrome's native player. Chrome just changed it.\nAlso, this is the Plyr repo, not Hls.js. Thanks @sampotts! I think individual functions is an even better idea :), but I didn't look at the bigger picture.. This doesn't have anything to do with client side logic. Embedding audio links in RSS is server side logic. It's basically the podcast format I think.\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#1-does-plyr-work-with-- \nhttps://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/How_to_publish_a_Podcast. Kudos for rebasing, and changing all those util.on calls \ud83d\udc4d \nI had a couple more suggestions, but since I just missed the window I think I'll submit them as another PR. It might have ben for the better anyway :). \"youtube-nocookie.com\" has no working API, which we need for our buttons and events to work.. It's normal.\nIt's usually normal for us not to support features that aren't supported by native HTML5 media, and that hasn't been documented as a feature we support. \ud83d\ude09 \nThere's no the data-teaser or data-preview btw. data-attributes are used for custom developer data. Browsers don't care about them other than giving developers access to read and set.\nYou can implement this yourself by listening for mouseover and mouseout.. Closing this since it's not something we have documented to support, and the user is now a ghost. If someone else wants it there's a similar PR already. I think there's also a feature suggestion somewhere.. With the destructuring you mean? I'm using it constantly so you're probably going to have to get used to it ;). It's saved to localStorage. Use these options to disable it {storage: {enabled: false}}. If you do it in JSON you have to quote enabled. Also, you can find out by debugging the player's config.storage value.. Closing this since it's really a support question. It's not a bad question, but please use Slack for support as per our guidelines (or preferably stack overflow or google if it doesn't directly concern Plyr). Please don't make me repeat this again.. I think this is preventable. Have fixed it locally, but I just have to make sure it's safe.. Thanks for the report. This has been mentioned before but I couldn't replicate it. I think I know how this got introduced.. Thanks for the suggestions / feedback!\nSome comments:\n\nYou should be able to do it yourself with media queries, depending on exactly what you mean. You have to be more specific\nI think this is a good suggestion. Create a separate issue for the ideas in 2-3 if you want it\nSee 2 ^\nSee #193. Not sure plyr-credits is a realistic thing devs want to add.\nI'm not sure I like adding a separate option for arranging buttons as opposed extending the current ones (which can be made to be backward compatible). See #1047 (just created)\nI think this is a good suggestion. Title can already be set, but isn't shown afaik. Create a separate issue for this if you want it.\nNo need for Plyr to do this #506. In addition there could be legal issues with putting a logo on top of YouTube or Vimeo.\n\nI think 2-3 and 6 are good suggestions, but it's really not helpful to us to get \"here's a list of everything I want\" type of issues. We (developers and users watching issues) need to focus on one thing at a time and thread. In fact our contributions guidelines says this:\n\nCreate one issue per problem or request (i.e. don't combine multiple problems to one git issue).\n\n(It is in the \"Reporting issues\" section, so maybe this should be copied to the feature request section too)\nI'm closing this, but feel free to open new issues with individual features unless they already exist. \ud83d\udc4d \nSorry for the hard moderation. We still have a lot of bugs and improvements to fix for v3 before we can even get to features (which we have plenty of). So I prefer to keep the threshold high to keep things more productive.. I think the current default button selection and order is very good and intuitive. I typically only want to make small changes to is regardless of use case, and our app uses Plyr in a video grid, modals, subtitle editor and a sharable link for the result, so it's quite versatile.\nWe're not everyone though, so more input is appreciated.. Yeah, it was actually a fix for another issue which I think is non-fatal https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/commit/ea4d91d2a011cdfc835619cb90a25074c039e777#diff-21a888c55f507a76f2a82a75d300d6f7 Stay on  3.3.14 for now or 3.3.12 if you want to avoid the non-fatal issue (only happens when changing source or specifically for YouTube and Vimeo I think).\nThanks for reporting!. This has nothing to do with Plyr. You should be able to find the answer on google or stack overflow.\nAlso: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md. I guess that means it was the right solution \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4d . You forgot to press one button, so I took the liberty :). I think that's a good separate suggestion.\nStorage could be both an object or boolean, where true is translated to {volume: true, muted: true, quality: true, speed: true, captions: true, language: true} (and false to the opposite obviously).. > Should we make this consist with the others though like quality, volume, muted, speed? They all seem to have similar behaviour (fall back to storage or config).\nYeah, I do think so. Setters shouldn't have fallbacks imo.. Dash.js, hls.js and Shaka player probably supports it, but we don't support switching quality for those libraries yet (I'm working on it).. If you remove Plyr from your code and use native html5 video instead it should still happen. Then use Google or Stack Overflow to find your solution. Seems like it's a problem with your server. Please read our contributions document if you want to keep commenting or open new issues.. This should work:\njs\nnew Plyr(element, {controls: []}\nYou may get an error (maybe only if you have enable captions), but it should be fixed soon (#1061). Which Plyr version are you using? . There are no other ways to rearrange the controls yet #1047\nI'll copy that png and paste it into my code so I can test it ;). No sorry, that was a joke (you can't copy a png image into your code). I was hoping you'd paste the actual code. ~~Please read our guidelines about replication: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#replication~~ (these are now in the issue temaplate)\nMy guess is that your code was copied from Plyr before v3.3.13, and that the controls have changed since (they have in #1041, but I'm not sure exactly what changed), so try downgrading Plyr to 3.3.12 or upgrading your buttons by copying from the default button output of a newer Plyr version (or however you did it originally) before changing the order.\nI'm not sure this fixes the problem.. @ndimatteo That's not very helpful. Please create a new issue and follow the template.. This could be a race condition. Does it happen if you defer setting the source via   setTimeout()?. Plyr needs it's methods (like play()), and the Plyr controls using them to be able to trigger the iframe's method. Otherwise we could just use the iframe embed url without any SDK.\nYou can't pass a url to new YT.Player(). new YT.Player() creates the URL, so unless there is some magic way it's just not possible.. Sure. I still claim it's not possible, but would be happy to be proven wrong.\nAddition: Seem like I was wrong :+1: . Just to clarify:\n968 is about not being able to pause by touching a playing video on touch-devices. The reason for this is detailed in the issue (no \"hover\" / \"mouseover\"), but the situation could be improved.\nThis issues is about click-interactions being treated as touch-interactions if your device has both capacities and you are using a click-device.\nFor people with only click-devices, this can be replicated by loading https://plyr.io/ with Chrome devtools device mode enabled. Then if you disable it without reloading the page you won't be able to pause by clicking the playing video.\nIt should only happen for HTML5 video.. So basically toggling a class with something like this?\ncss\n.pseudo-fullscreen {\n  position: fixed !important;\n  margin: 0 !important;\n  top: 0 !important;\n  right: 0 !important;\n  bottom: 0 !important;\n  left: 0 !important;\n  z-index: 99999 !important;\n}\nI've been thinking about something like that for ios support, but don't personally see much utility in having multiple options for desktop.. Alright. I'm not sure I fully get it or that you two want exactly the same solution, but I'll watch this space :). This is a question (which you shouldn't ask here) and is also the first question in our FAQ\nThe answer is no, but you can use a streaming library like dash.js, hls.js or Shaka Player to extend the capabilities of native HTML5. I don't know a lot about their support for DRM. See our examples and their documentations.. clickToPlay isn't a setter. It's an option, soplyr.clickToPlay = false; won't do anything.\nYou need to pass it as to Plyr when creating the instance:\njs\nnew Plyr(element, {clickToPlay: false});\nYou can also change the default via Plyr.defaults.clickToPlay = false; before creating the instance (this is undocumented).. Thanks @gurupras!\nI'll close the issue.. This is more a question about hls.js than Plyr. It should happen without Plyr too. Enable hls debugging an check the dev console. No one here is a hls.js expert\nAlso, please read: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues. Thanks for this! I'll take a look at it soon. Can also check if it's breaking then. Can you fix the linting errors apart from the no-cycle ones (they were already there before)? They should be easy.. It could be related to this:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plugins/vimeo.js#L93\nBut I'm guessing more likely to this: \nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plugins/vimeo.js#L194-L204.\nIf it's the latter, it shouldn't be hard to fix. Adding an extra condition to line 201 to check !player.muted should do it.\nI have to focus on other things right now so help is wanted.. Would be great to get the Plyr line number.. Would be fixed by #1053. Additions:\n Depending on exactly when you're setting player.speed this could be a race condition, which #1053 doesn't fix.\n storage is end-user options, and are supposed to take precedence over the options specified by devs, but only when creating the instance. Not when setting speed.. It's called \"media fragments\" and is a native HTML5 feature, so we support it by proxy.. Still seems to work though: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/eKaBLP. Closing the issue as invalid. Comply with the issue reporting guidelines to have it reopened if it's actually a Plyr issue: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues. Reopened with a new title that explains the problem.\nI'm still not sure it's valid though. I don't think it quite make sense to support it with <source> elements. But perhaps we could add an option for currentTime or something?. I don't doubt it, and in a way breaking the native API is a breaking change too, but this is not something we have documented support for.. Thanks for the report. I can't replicate it since I don't have any working i-device or means of simulating it, and Sam is super busy with family, work and the accessibility issue.\nSo any help is welcome.. That's a not a good suggestion. Any UA specific code should only run on the browsers they were intended for. If you make your browser violate this by UA spoofing you should expect it to break. \"Fixing\" this will just break things even more on the real browser.. Also thought about adding a fallback to en, but would like to know if this works first.. The build will fail since #1083 isn't in master yet.. Not really. It might be possible to override the current behavior with css, but this would require changing in a lot of places to get the arrow right too, and you'd likely need js to figure out how much to offset with (not sure about this). And ultimately it wouldn't really solve the problem imo.\nAs long as your page can be scrolled there's no telling which way is better until the menu is actually shown. Stuff like dynamic sorting and \"infinite scroll\" (tumblr scroll) makes it even harder. Changing the direction for all players may work for you if you know your player is always at the top on all devices, but even in that case it may overflow. It can happen for video too.\n\nThere's a whole library for handling this (https://popper.js.org/), but obviously adding that would increase the build size.. Use hls.js for streaming hls video. See the example codepen in the documentation. . \"doesn't work\" is not a valid description of a problem.\nPlease read the contributions guidelines and use the issue template or don't bother at all.\nAlso, it's not supposed to. It's for \"embedded players\" (YouTube and Vimeo).. Use a container outside the video element or set the width to the outer container .plyr created by Plyr. Don't set height unless you want to pad the video.. This place isn't for support, as stated in our community guidelines.\nSince Plyr is wrapping the video element and needs to do so to add custom controls, captions and poster, the outer container determines the size and the other element adapt. Setting only the video size would only affect the video, not the other elements, and end up looking broken when the video doesnt stretch the whole way. In addition, if the video element has a fixed size, it would stay that way when you fullscreen it.\nIf anything, style the container (created by Plyr) and make sure it doesn't break fullscreen mode. It's not impossible.\nAlso. This is CSS. If you want to change how it works by overriding the behavior, nothing is stopping you.. https://plyr.io is using html5 video\nhttps://plyr.io/#vimeo is using Vimeo\nhttps://plyr.io/#youtube is using YouTube. Thanks for following our replication instructions :)\nWith your example player.fullscreen.enter(); is called just after creating Plyr, and the fullscreen button isn't created in time. This triggers an error, and the fullscreen button doesn't get the right icon and tooltip.\nWith other methods it's possible to delay until the ui is ready using the ready-event, but for fullscreen this isn't possible. Fullscreen must be triggered with a \"gesture\", so you can't use that event listener.\nI agree with you that this shouldn't happen. The UI should not be required in order to change the state. Optimally I think it should be a function of the state (like react components).\nThe issue as it's replicated could be avoided by pre-rendering Plyr hidden, then showing it when you press the button.. Does it happen in \"incognito mode\" (if that exists in iOS)?\nThe svgs are being cached, so if it works in incognito but not regular mode, that's likely the culprit.. I don't know much about the Vi ads and probably can't help you, but in your position I would verify that I hadn't disabled ads via an ad blocker extension or built in browser ad blocker, and also checked the error console for anything that may help to detect the problem.. > I tried adding crossorigin to the video element, adding Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"*\" headers to all plyr files, and crossorigin=\"anonymous\" to the script tag to no avail.\n\nIt looks like CORB is a separate consideration to CORS\n\nCorrect. These changes won't affect the CORB-warnings. I haven't read up on CORB, but I don't think the warning are critical. They're also happening to the google ads demo  http://googleads.github.io/googleads-ima-html5/simple/. @reevester Please make sure to @mention the right people. If not, this will send unwanted confusing notifications to people outside of this conversation. Sam Potts is @sampotts.. This isn't really the right place, but good luck!. Not yet.. I'm guessing onReady is being called twice for some reason. Pretty sure this is in no way connected to posters.. If someone getting this issue could help out debugging, that would be appreciated. I would try to find out why / if onReady is being called twice. There may be some issue with the setup method, or this is an actual YouTube issue.. I wasn't able to replicate it, but have submitted a PR anyway.\nAbout your footnotes\n\nAlso noticed, that not all Youtube videos have thumbnail images, but Plyr always tries to load them, and it causes Cannot redefine property: playbackRate error and GET https://img.youtube.com/vi/2tOMS4OdO4c/maxresdefault.jpg 404 () Failed to load resource: the server responded with status of 404 (Not Found)\n\nAll Youtube videos have thumbnail images, but they don't all have the largest resolution. The only way to find out which resolutions are supported is trying. Trying means you get 404's in the console. These aren't Javascript errors. It's just the console trying to be helpful.\nSee https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/pull/963\n\nAlso noticed this error together with `Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided ('https://www.youtube.com') does not match the recipient window's origin ('http://...').\nh.B @ www-widgetapi.js:99\n\nThat's in their code, and can't be avoided. You'd get that if you used YouTube embeds without Plyr as well.. @Scrity1976: This should now by in Plyr 3.3.23, but since you're having the issue and I never did you may want to verify this.. Seems similar and possibly related to #1101. @MBWebTechMariusz Anyone is welcome to help out. There's no reason to expect us to fix everything, or giving us orders. I don't even have an iPad btw.\nThere's a handful of known serious issues right now. We're aware of it, but we're just unpaid private persons helping out in our spare time.. It's because YouTube removed this feature.\nThe current behavior is a bug imo. We should remove the controls imo, since it's not working. From the link (it's the same as mine btw):\n\nMuted autoplay is always allowed. Hadn't heard about Netlify before. The preview (https://5b555c6dc6aed624aea5e52e--plyr.netlify.com/) doesn't seem to work, but cool :). Are you sure you are using the latest Plyr version and not adding anything custom to the build? The word controller doesn't exist anywhere is the current Plyr source code or build (except as a comment), and the word match is only used as a property for YouTube and Vimeo (and your example is for HTML5).. Closing since this information doesn't add up. Comment with more info to have it reopened.. You need to disable hideControls (auto hiding) too, and then add your own events for auto hiding if you want that.\n\nhttps://codepen.io/fullkornslimpa/pen/EpmKga?editors=1010\nI don't think this behaviour has to be supported directly, if it can be with a workaround. But perhaps this workaround isn't good enough, since it requires auto hiding to be disabled?. At the request from Slack:\nIf you want the same behavior with hideControls enabled:\nhttps://codepen.io/fullkornslimpa/pen/oMomEm\nNote that this won't show the controls when you start playing. You have to trigger some event for that I guess. . Plyr doesn't handle streams. You can handle streams with Plyr and other libraries which have events for these things.\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#1-does-plyr-work-with--. jwplayer probably handles this aspect better. Plyr works with captions for dash.js and hls.js (not Shaka Player). Quality switching isn't implemented yet. Plyr is also not well tested, and doesn't have the same resources, so I would expect jwplayer to be more stable if the price and licence works for you.. I think you need to add a protocol (like https) making the link https://user:pwd@example.com/video.mp4. If this doesn't work, find out what does.\nEither way, this has nothing to do with Plyr. You'd get it with native HTML5 video too, and password protecting a file in order to use the password in the code later isn't really secure. You may want to look at streaming libraries and DRM.\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues. Switching quality with the Plyr settings and streaming libraries is not yet supported. There are blockers keeping us from fixing this quickly.\nIt's a shame, since it makes more sense with these libraries than plain video files.\nDash on ios is not a question for Plyr https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#1-does-plyr-work-with--. What's the output of player.touch? This happens when I use the \"device\" emulator in Chrome, but otherwise not.. Yes. It's likely the same issue as #999 (but this one is described better so if anything we should close that one).\nNeither Sam or me have much time right now, so help would be welcome.. Also related: #1067. Haven't played it for an hour, but it's easy enough to see where it's headed by your codepen. For some reason it reports the duration as 6 hours, and currentTime starts 5 hours in. I'm assuming the ended-handling (setting the stopped state and showing the poster) kicks in once currentTime >= duration, causing this. Since duration doesn't apply to live streams this logic would have to be conditional cancelled out.. It's not supported in HTML5 video, but the streaming libraries can do it. https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#1-does-plyr-work-with--. Changed to a feature since it would be nice with a control for it in cases where it's supported. This is not a high prio however, and it's a long way to go.. Thanks, but this type of change isn't open to drive-by contributions. The people who answer issues should govern the rules and templates.. Sorry! Since our stance is pretty clear on support questions, accepting this PR doesn't make any sense imo, but it's your call. I don't oppose making improvements using ideas from here though.. Sorry @jaydrogers! I didn't know you knew each other or had talked about this. I'm a collaborator and answer many of these questions. Your support question template is quite nice and would have been helpful if we wanted them here, and we could of course improve my PR with checklists and emojis for example.. Are you using the Plyr Wordpress plugin? We're not the developers ~~and don't have access to it~~. It's using an outdated Plyr version as well.\n~~Ping @drrobotnik~~. Plyr is a relatively lightweight abstraction over HTML5 media or YouTube or Vimeo iframes. It shouldn't be doing anything CPU-intensive, but I can confirm this behaviour is happening for me as well.. It requires logging in with an apple-id, but the embedded picture is readable.\nTo replicate, go to https://sampotts.github.io/webkit-lowerfill/\n Enable the dev tools\n The range tracks are red. This is how Safari devtools show elements being redrawn. When elements are constantly or blinking red like this, there's an infinte redraw-loop.\n Drag one of the handles. The input-element will start blinking red (for the same reason).\n Drag the other handles.\n Do some MDMA\n Have a rave party\nIf I disable JS in Safari the tracks won't be red initially, and the CPU usage won't be crazy. The infinite blinking effect is still there after dragging however.. It's not a problem with range inputs. It may be something in the css and possibly the MutationObserver (although it seems to happen without JS).\nThis pen doesn't have any problem in Safari. It's in many ways similar to Plyr's progress bars (range inputs using css variables)\nI made that by styling the whole range input as a track however (avoiding some prefixes), which may not work with Plyr's thin tracks (small devices + fat fingers). That's what I already said in Slack ^\nIt doesn't seem like there is any such option (expectedly since they don't seem to want you to disable this): https://github.com/vimeo/player.js#embed-options\nIf someone finds a way to do this (preferably not a hack) feel welcome to comment or open a new issue, but otherwise not.. I can't test this (no i-device).\nSince you have the issue, maybe you can have a look at troubleshooting why it's happening?\nThe way I see it, svgxuse is breaking our valid working code, rather than the opposite. But maybe there's something simple we can do to avoid it.. Thanks!\nI've also been confused about that line. Could you test that removing the condition works, even when going into fullscreen before playing the first time (I imagine this could have been the initial problem)? If so you're certainly welcome to make a PR :). Travis unfortunately doesn't understand when you change the base branch, so the script still fails although it's fixed https://travis-ci.org/sampotts/plyr/jobs/409611204#L460. Pushed a commit that changes the lower controls to be injected before the captions + expanded on your existing change to override the positioning.\nShould do the trick, and since the lower controls are positioned absolutely it doesn't seem to create any issues.\nIf someone is confused about what this PR, this demonstrates the problem: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/YjEbrM (start playing and hover in/out of the video). > I think it needs to be set to transform: translateY(-15px); instead of transform: translateY(0px);.\nIn order to override the hover effect and cancel out translateY 0 is the correct value. The 20px padding below the captions is actually padding, so I think that should be negated by overriding padding in this case. I think removing 15px padding could be too much, but maybe 10px?.\nSince the codepen-link uses the latest Plyr version, you can now test the fixed behaviour with it. But here is before/after removing 10px padding:\n\n\n. Why do you want the captions to float 35px above the bottom when there are no controls?. Awesome! :). Thanks! This actually shows three separate problems.\n\nThe first and second video position captions differently.\nThe third example shows a similar bug with null added to the output that was fixed in #868.\nThe third example has no controls element at all. The css we added is applied for captions after empty controls, but not after \"no controls\". So the css should be changed.\n\n1139 should fix 2-3 (not verified with your example though).\nThis can be used to fix 1:\ncss\n.plyr--hide-controls .plyr__captions {\n  transform: translateY(0);\n}\nIt's applied to the right here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EpoMyO\nThis seems to remove an intended smooth effect. I think it's better, but I'm not sure it's something Sam wants.\nIf not, you can use the css to override at least.. This is fixed now (but not released yet). I made a temporary build to test with your pen. If you want, you can verify it by changing the external references in your pen's settings to:\nhttps://rawgit.com/friday/plyr/1137-build/dist/plyr.min.js\nhttps://rawgit.com/friday/plyr/1137-build/dist/plyr.css. Thanks!\nHowever I'm not sure the behaviour is something we want in Plyr. Even if we do, I can't accept this code, since it breaks our guidelines, it doesn't lint, and seems very bloated. It's also made to the wrong branch. Also, maybe you have a keyword for _this, but Plyr doesn't, so I don't think it can work?\nPlease create an issue explaining the problem clearly and we can take the discussion from there.\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/contributing.md#contributing-features-and-documentation. Would be real helpful with a codepen showing this\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/Writing-helpful-issue-descriptions. Your controls need the plyr__controls-class (or something else if you've change selectors.controls.wrapper) in order for Plyr to understand that they are the controls and not just some random element.\nSo changing the first line to this fixes it:\njs\nconst controls = `<div class=\"plyr__controls\"><button>Play</button></div>`;\nThe controls documentation mentions \"The classes and data attributes used in your template should match the selectors option if you change any\", but could perhaps be more clear about this still.\nIt would be possible to create the wrapper for the string so users wouldn't have to deal with it, but this would be a breaking change.. @akshatbhargava123 Please read https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/contributing.md#support and https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/controls.md. js\nconst player = new Plyr(element, {fullscreen: {enabled: false}});\nPlease read the documentation and issue templates next time.. The reason for this is that the media is being paused while you're dragging it (like most players). Otherwise you sort of have to fight against the playback, particularly with short media durations. \nThe play button is shown conditionally based on the player being paused or not (the presence of a class on the outer container). It shouldn't be too hard to add an new class while it's seeking that cancels this behaviour.\nIt's happening with all providers (not just YouTube). > I\u2019m thinking about removing the quality support for YouTube completely to be honest, given it\u2019s uselessness.\n+1 on this since the code is not serving any function now, and the UI just confuses users that they have options.\nWould probably be a good idea to follow that by documenting provider support for various features, like captions and quality selection in the docs and FAQ, then close the related issues (#851, #965, #1110 and this issue).. Plyr needs to control the playback of the iframe in order to work. For that to be possible the provider must have an SDK (ex: https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference or https://github.com/vimeo/player.js). Ted Talks doesn't have this.. Also: Their talks seems to be on YouTube anyway? They put them up there: https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector/videos. Thanks! This one is on me. I thought Array.from() worked differently.. Thanks!\nThe reason unpkg.com is used in the codepen templates is that it supports version ranges, so we don't have to update them with every release. Using fixed releases shouldn't differ. v3.4.0 is released now so the latest cdn version is https://cdn.plyr.io/3.4.0/plyr.js (which still doesn't work).\nIts seems the code assumes all buttons in the array exists, but with your setup some are null.\nShould be easy to fix by adding .filter(Boolean) after Object.values(this.elements.buttons)\nI'll leave this to Sam though since he know this better.. Plyr (uppercase P) is a class. You need to create an instance of it to use it. In the documentation and examples player with lowercase P refers to the instance. You cannot call methods of Plyr directly on the class.\nconst player = new Plyr('#player', options); is an example of how to do this. It does not matter if you use const, let or var, the instance doesn't need to be accessible in the global scope and it doesn't have to be named player.\nIn your case it sounds like you are are creating the instance and assigning it to a property. This is not a problem, but then you should not be using player.play(). You should be using module.player.play() (assuming your module is named module and your property is named player).\nTry the codepen templates if you need help getting started, and follow this guide if you still have this problem and want to report it. This issue description doesn't have the details needed to understand the problem.. See #296. > You think I should not worry about the W3C validator?\n~~That's a strawman argument. You know he didn't say that, and he also didn't close the issue.~~ I realize now that there is a language barrier and probably no bad intent.\nSince you do care (which is great), maybe if you can get the builds working on your machine (#1173), you could submit a PR changing it to data-res while still supporting the current non-standard property as a fallback? There is actually already an open PR which does this among other changes (the other ones are the problematic ones). It uses a different name data-height but your suggestion is better imo.\nThe source-setter which currently works with size also would need to be backwards compatible.\nOptimally that PR would also change the documentation and the demo to use the new name as possibly comment about the fallback being needed for compatibility.. Added to the v4 milestone. Mainly because I think it's a good reminder and this is easier to fix in a major version change. It can be done sooner (like in the closed PR). This will add more overhead, but probably not a huge difference.. This error should not happen in Node v8+\nhttps://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original\nI'm not getting this in the environment you specified (just switched to Arch days ago). Are you sure you haven't downgraded to an older version via nvm or something similar?. > Why not data-size?\nSorry. I encouraged data-res in the issue. size is ambiguous imo (could just as well mean file size or bit rate).. I restarted it, but the current error is not your fault.. This was likely caused by #959. I'm not very involved any more, but if someone wants to have a look at it, the issue was that YouTube and Vimeo autoplays the first time you seek, and I had to add a workaround to make this consistent with HTML5.\nHTML5 autoplay shouldn't be affected.. HTML5 works: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gZKZbo, so anyone who finds this issue critical can self-host the video (or try to fix the issue).\nNot going to get a ton of upvotes for this comment I suspect :smiley: . That's probably a red herring. \"Start autoplay!\" isn't logged by Plyr or YouTube, so I'm guessing you added it in your fork or event listener? The order of the events logged doesn't mean they happen strictly in that order anyway.\nIf you send the autoplay param to YouTube it should set the HTML5 autoplay param accordingly. Once that param is enabled and the browser supports it, autoplay will start when it has enough data. It won't try until then. It's all handled by your browser with no JS involved.\nAs your earlier comment suggests, triggering .play() outside of user interaction events is not as well supported as the autoplay param, so I doubt YouTube does that.\nThis is also why it's not optimal to fix this way, even if it mostly works.\nI would instead try to figure out which of the commits broke this (for examle f8c89e3e95cb01a621f59d66c60f0fa2d76c4d58), and try to work it from there. Perhaps unmute is triggered too soon or something.\nNice try anyway. Might be better than no fix at all for users, although from a maintenance perspective quickfixes that doesn't follow the original intention may not be better than no fix at all.. I think you're right that L393 is the problem. L231 is just the initial setter before there's an event. It should be kept. paused has to be the current state, not the next state, and updated via the events and assurePlaybackState() as now. player.config.autoplay just means you want it to autoplay. It can't be trusted to happen.\nL393 is meant for stopping YouTube's automatic play when seeking, not autoplay generally, but it looks like it does both.\nMaybe try this:\njs\nif (player.media.paused && !player.embed.hasPlayed && !player.config.autoplay) {. I've actually stepped down from Plyr development, but I still answer questions. @sampotts is the one who should decide the direction here. \nIf autoplay fails (which is something to expect imo) with your solution, you'd end up with no play buttons though, since there is no event for autoplay failing (can't listen to YouTube's exceptions either).\nThe poster can be hidden with css at least, or perhaps a different fix could take care of this. For example adding a css class for autoplay that disables the poster.. You have duplicate id's breaking the selector method. Remove id=\"player\" from the wrapper.. So this fork of your codepen which does just that doesn't work?. I see a pattern here :wink: (and also, I agree on all of them). Software architecture concerns. Extensibility, compartmentalization and minimalism.. You can't. It violates YouTube's and Vimeo's terms, so this is intentionally unsupported. If you want to earn money from video content, you can self-host it.. > ..and this media element contains the original preload=\"none\" attribute (which is now lost)\nI agree with this being a big problem. State should be stored properly so it isn't lost. In a different place where this pattern was used I copied the original attribute and reapplied it to the new element.\nNot sure this issue is something Plyr should be concerned with. Plyr doesn't manage network connections. It's really a browser/OS thing, but #1201 looks like a legit issue.. https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/wiki/FAQ#1-does-plyr-work-with--\nHls.js or Shaka Player may support this.. Duplicate of #877 \nUnfortunately not such an odd bug.. > This is what I see\nThat's because you don't have the css. Completely unrelated to the console warning.. You can add a custom event for the play button and toggle fullscreen (see the docs). That's how the fullscreen button works to begin with. It has to be a real user interaction though.\nIt shouldn't matter if it's YouTube or HTML5 since fullscreen works on the main container element.. Not my call, but I think documenting the JS API is outside of the scope of this project.. You can set controls to an array. Ex:\njs\nconst player = new Plyr('video', {controls: ['play-large', 'play', 'progress', 'current-time', 'mute', 'volume', 'captions', 'settings', 'download', 'pip', 'airplay', 'fullscreen']});\nHow you adapt that to your template language is your concern.\n~~Seems like download is missing from the controls documentation and not expained, so please leave this open.~~. My bad. It was only missing from the main page. It's documented here.. ~~As mentioned in #1066, the URL to the iframe is what matters, and it's generated by the JS SDK. Changing the link to the JS SDK has no effect. You still get the normal youtube URL.~~\n~~You should be able to see that yourself with your browser dev tools. The YouTube iframe link and the requests are the same right?~~\nEdit: Should have read the diffs more carefully :+1: . Looks good then! :+1: I only shimmed the diffs, and thought this was doing something else. The host parameter is new to me (also undocumented it seems).\nI'm going to leave this for @sampotts to test and review. It's his call to make, and I've reduced my involvement so I don't even have the plyr repo on my computer any more.\nAlso: Please make PR's to the develop branch in the future.. There is/was a similar older issue. Vimeos SDK link doesn't work with our SDK loader when requirejs is used. Hard to fix on our side, but we could perhaps overload module.exports.\nAnd yeah, Sam is the creator and maintainer of Plyr. I helped out for a while but I have stepped back for now (but still answer issues).. I think returning here is a problem. I just wrote a comment about this line at the commit it was introduced: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/commit/ebf53d14b12c025b6c2f37a887a55e2bf7ab3b7d#r27998183\nI don't know if this PR is the right place, since it's a different issue, but you could be the judges of that @gehaktmolen  @sampotts :). Looks nice :) I'm only commenting because I had the typeerror issue as mentioned earlier and I'm not up to speed with plyr ads. However, I believe the intention is for the plyr play method is to return the result of the video element's play() (which may or may not be a promimes depending on the browser). For this you would need to return this.ads.managerPromise.then... on line 314, or the play result on line 317 goes into the void.. Yes, but you still need to return this.media.play() on line 317 or you break the promise chain. If this.ads.play() also returns a promise that is resolved after the ads when the media starts playing for example, you would need to return there as well. Again I didn't look too deep into this so I'm not sure of the intentions.. This should work I think (at least if this.media.play doesn't need binding/wrapping):\njs\nreturn this.ads.managerPromise\n    .then(() => this.ads.play())\n    .catch(this.media.play);. () => resolve() and () => reject() are redundant wrappers. You can use resolve and reject directly :). Wrapping a function like() => someMethod() is really only needed if it's a class member and needs this or if you want to change the arguments.. Sure thing!\n. It's needed to overspecify .plyr--full-ui input[type='range'] (sliders.scss), but it's not the only way.\nChanging the selector on line 5 to .plyr--full-ui .plyr__progress (actually did this first but changed it since it was less self-explanatory) works too for example, and changing the order of the imports might work as well.. I have actually already done that :), but that was for the SSR issue, and I ended up pushing a different solution. I agree this is better.. Haha.. my bad! I caught this and edited right after posting it, but you were faster.. 1. cue => utils.is.cue(cue) is the same as just utils.is.cue since utils is just a set of methods without any this, so when you use Array.filter, there shouldn't be any need to wrap the method.\n\n\nYou shouldn't need array filter at all. track.activeCues will contain cues or no cues, but never anything else, or am I missing something?\n\n\nWhy check if activeCues.length > 0? captions.setText.call(this, activeCues.map(cue => cue.getCueAsHTML())); should work either way. Since setText now takes an array passing an empty array is should work as well as null.. Have you verified that this condition is needed, or did you add it because it was in the code previously?. 1. The caption element has css white-space: pre-wrap;, so you can use '\\n' rather than '<br>'\n\nInstead of forEach, needing the array index and this condition you could just do captions.join('\\n') which will also add the line break in between all cues.\nDom updates are slow, so it's generally a very bad idea to do something like element.innerHTML += ... in a loop. You should get the full value first, then update the dom once. While it won't matter much here since it's probably just one or two cues, the code would look a lot cleaner too.. I'm not fully sure I understand the question, but it was intentionally replaced with array destructuring (the brackets surrounding language).\n\nYou probably know this, but this is how it works:\njs\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3]\nconst [first] = arr;\nconst alsoFirst = arr[0];\nconsole.log({ first, alsoFirst }); // {first: 1, alsoFirst: 1}\nSo, like before it only gets the en part of en-GB. I see. I thought that was unintended, but it makes sense now that you say it. I rebased that so it should work like before now (but with an object literal).. Destructuring is when you do this:\njs\nconst {label} = input;\nInstead of this:\njs\nconst label = input.label;\nSince it's already declared here you need to wrap with parenthesis:\njs\n({label} = input);. dedupe doesn't work on objects. It doesn't do \"deep equals\".. If you set the badge here the i18n won't work, right? With the fallback you don't need to anyway right?. There are multiple problems here.\n1. Not really a problem per se, but as Sam pointed out there's no need for the intermediate variable sizes. You can just add to the existing function chain.\n2. The label will be 720 not 720p as I'm sure you intended it to be (since otherwise the template literals doesn't really make sense).\n3. However I don't think you should set the label at all since later on in the code you need to be able to distinguish between data that was specified by developers and fallback data in order to respect the data specified by developers. I would use a class for the entries in this.options.qualities in order to solve this via getters and setters (moving the logic from getLabel and getBadge) \n3. It wouldn't be possible to set the badge and label via the source element.\n4. filter(Boolean) removes all falsy values. I think with the other changes in this PR this isn't something we want. Especially not before grabbing the array index, like now. Rather, we should do that when creating the menu.\nI suggest you change it to something like this:\n```js\n// I haven't tested this code, and the comments are meant for you, not to stay in the code\nreturn html5.getSources.call(this)\n    .map((source, index) => {\n        // Get data from the dataset (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset)\n        const {\n            // For backward-compatibility, fallback on the old size-attribute (which I think we should deprecate)\n            height = source.getAttribute('size'),\n            label,\n            badge,\n        } = source.dataset;\n    return {\n        index, // Really don't think we need index here at all, as mentioned\n        badge,\n        label,\n        height,\n    };\n});\n\n``. The old quality setter code was already too complex and hard to understand, so I think this is a step in the wrong direction. I think you should restore the old setter and the getter in the html5/youtube plugins and add a new getter/setter that sets only by index.videoTrackorlevelperhaps?. 1. This can be done a lot simpler with destructuring and default parameters.\n2. Shouldn't it bequality.height. Notquality.label`?\nSuggestion (not tested):\n``js\nconst getBadge = quality => {\n    const {\n        height,\n        badge = i18n.get(qualityBadge.${height}`, this.config);\n    } = quality;\nreturn badge ? controls.createBadge.call(this, label) : null;\n\n};\n``. I thinklabelshould be used for sorting. After all that's what's shown. In case there are multiple levels with the same height (like with that Sintel hls manifest) and the dev provides a label \"818p (4149k)\" for one and \"818 (6214k)\" for the other. It shouldn't break backward compatibility since with the previous options the sort result would be the same.. The index is a better identifier forvalue(instead of adding the additionalindexproperty).. Optimally you shouldn't need to add index here. You can usevaluefor index (like captions do). This of course means you need to create the arguments forcreateMenuItem` before any sorting/dedupe/filtering.. Does index need to be a property. Can't we use the array index?. I think we should respect the label and its formatting as it was specified by the developers, and only call getLabel if they didn't pass a label.\nThis includes i18n and changing the casing. In most languages I know of title case is incorrect formatting, and it make no sense to give developers the option to translate their own input. They should specify it in the language they want it.. I think you should restore getLabel (see above). Not sure why you removed ${value}p?. This should be height, not label. This should be height, not label. This should be height, not label. No that was K As in 2K or 4K video etc (used for badges). 408p basically means its height is 408px (although the \"p\" does mean something else entirely).. Yes! :). (Sam might disagree but at least it won't look like it's doing something and then it doesn't work). I'm not sure what comment by Sam you're referring to, but you don't have to fix that. In fact, since it's a separate problem it's better not to imo. You can do that in a separate pr in that case. . Alright. I did read that, but too quickly I guess. I still think this should be a separate PR optimally. Solving it with closest also means 719p would count as HD, which it by definition isn't. I would expect it work like breakpoints, if anything. Sorry I'm making this hard for you btw! . The previous implementation had only one argument (quality/height), so it was the only thing that could be used for sorting. Using the label for sorting wouldn't have added anything since it's either the same with an extra \"p\", or translated. Either way it always meant \"quality\" and it it couldn't really mean anything else. With these changes however it's no longer clear this is the case.\nHowever you're probably right that fixing the sort method could be too much work, at least for now.\nThe best solution might be not to sort at all, but that would be breaking, so yeah. Leave it as is \ud83d\udc4d . Sorry! I forgot which repo I was in it seems ;). Fixed!. ",

    "jamesoflol": "I started work on this today.) Just FYI in case of a freak overlap of someone else also thinking to finally do this.) Should be done some time this week https://github.com/jamesoflol/plyr/commit/5bd00abd656aa987ab69d8cd0ebac4f592d414e5. Thanks doublex! Have implemented fixes for both 'a' and 'b'. I've also fixed a minor issue with images loading out of order. https://github.com/jamesoflol/plyr/commits/preview-thumbs\n@sampotts should I put in a new PR?. I know this issue is old as hell, but I want to pipe up to say that I've also been having the same seek issue on the latest version, but it's very sporadic. Could it also be related to the dual touch/click events?. Hey @sampotts . I'm really keen on this feature. Want me to implement and PR? Did you already source an SVG asset? Otherwise I can find a CC one, or bug a designer for a favour.. Great! Yep, if you can find the icon, the rest should be easy enough :) Thanks Sam.. Hey Sam, as long as you're going to be editing CSS for controls, could you please take a look at the spacing between volume and settings button? It seems that only the CC button has enough left margin. See example:\n\n. Thanks!. Purely for my own knowledge, can I please ask for some background on why this is desirable / what is the use case? Is there a particular feature of Plyr that's not in Wistia?. I found that my polyfilling setup, which was working for IE11, wasn't working for android v4. I was using Babel in my build-time scripts. I found that adding polyfill.io in the runtime page load fixed it in  android v4. An awful solution, obviously. I haven't found a better solution, and I have absolutely no idea how to (or time to) debug that abomination.. Yep, and the reason other players do it is because you have to touch it to get to settings/seek (no hover). I've been investigating this issue. It is present on phone and on Chrome dev tools mobile emulator.\nThere's also a directly related issue: Tapping on the video to show controls intermittently does nothing. Always works on the second tap\nA simple fix for both of these is to remove the event handler for focusin and focusout at listeners.js:705.\nThe blocks at both listeners.js:272 (on container mousemove, touchmove etc) and listeners.js:705 (on focusin focusout) seem to implement the same functionality of trying to show/hide controls as needed. But line 705 has the added functionality of adding a noTransition class. I can't figure out why this noTransition class is required. After removing the entire block at 705, the issues described here are fixed, and I also seem to have no issues with scrolling of parent element.. Great insight and advice, thanks. I'll get on this before the end of the week.. There's already a PR: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/pull/1253\nI was hoping for a little testing/feedback from anyone before putting the finishing touches on it\nIn answer to your questions:\n- Thumb file naming: I've gone with the VTT spec for thumbs, same as a few other implementations out there, so that people can use any interval + naming convention that they want\n- Granularity: One every n seconds. Different intervals depending on video length. My personal preference is:\n  - 1hr+: 10 second interval\n  - 20m+: 5 second interval\n  - 5m+: 2 second interval\n  - 0-5m: 1 second interval. Thanks for that. I've actually implemented jpeg sprites today, will commit new code soon. It's much more ideal with sprites. Better with high latency, safer with http1-only browsers, etc.\nSprites shouldn't hurt load time in any significant way? No images are downloaded until the user hovers seek bar. It means that implementers will want to choose a tile size that keeps each sprite down to under a few hundred KB. (There's also a CPU performance ramification in going too large with a sprite sheet, as the browser has to print the entire thing, not just the individual frame.). How do you propose putting more than one quality source into a single VTT file?. Oh I see. Yeah, one single thumb quality is fine, and I guess may actually be the most common use - somewhere between 80 and 160px.\nI'm not writing this to work with Youtube or Vimeo. They don't provide a supported interface that I know of, and as such I expect that their image infrastructure/locations/specifications will change without notice. Heck, even their support interface (video embed) seems to change enough. I imagine that you could have Youtube hosting your video, and host the thumbnails yourself. Though I guess that kinda defeats the purpose of using youtube.... Probably good that you haven't had time yet! The changes for jpeg sprites were a bit more destructive than I thought... Just adding neighbouring-image preloading now.. OK, preloading is implemented, demo updated. It seems to be working very nicely now, very fast. Think I'm happy with it, just need a few more hands testing now.. Good catch! Right you are. I'll look into that. Ergh debugging Edge is awful :)\nThanks!. I have confidence in their ability to screw up even a re-skin ;). That's fixed. Seems Edge didn't like me using the array spread operator to convert an array. Replaced with Array.from(). The issue is that video play() is bound to both click and touchstart (listeners.js:375). Naturally, the video starts playing on touchstart, and then a couple hundred milliseconds later the click event fires and pauses it.\nSo obviously we don't want both, but can someone with more experience please enlighten me to why we might want to involve the touchstart event at all? It's the equiv of firing on mousedown. Click is so nice and universal. Obviously click has a delay because it fires on mouseup.. but I consider this to be minor. touchstart also has a host of other issues. Primarily that someone who tries to scroll the page by swiping on the video itself will cause it to start playing (well, it would if the bug didn't cause it to immediately pause again afterwards! :p). Swiping over video is a pretty likely scenario on mobile of course, because video takes up most of the page.\nSo, obvious solution (and I have tested this) is to simply remove touchstart as an event trigger for play().\nA side effect of fixing this, however, is that \"First touch on touch devices will just show controls\" (listeners.js:383) is no longer true. But was it ever true/working?? The reason for this appears to be two-fold. One, is that toggleControls() is fired by the touchstart event at line 291, and as such the controls are always showing again by the time our click event is fired. The fix here would seemingly be to also remove touchstart as an event trigger for this function. But I tried that, and found that there appears to be a race condition whereby which the container() elements.container listener fires immediately before the media() elements.container listener. To try to reorder those would put me way out of my depth with this codebase.\nI'm putting in a PR to simply drop touchstart as an event trigger for the media play() event, as it's currently breaking things pretty badly.. Duplicate issue: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/193\nI'm still planning to do this when I've got time.. I put this on the wrong branch. I've changed it, but can't trigger test to run again.. Any idea why the travis lint is doing that? On my machine \"npm run lint\" doesn't pick it up.\nOr can we override the block? Multiple other people have commented on the same issue e.g., https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1190. Hi sparktv. Please post a link to a codepen (or similar) of the issue. The issue being that the fullscreen button doesn't work when using the iosNative option with a youtube video.\nAs for the pause button not working, that's already an issue, with an open PR https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/pull/1184. I think Sam is on holidays or something. If you want to run a previous version, last known good for the pause issue is v3.3.23. The reason I ask for a Codepen (or similar) example is largely because it will help determine if the issues is with your own code, or a bug with Plyr itself. It's the process itself, of re-producing the issue in Codepen, that provides you a huge amount of insight into the issue - whether it's with your own code, at Youtube's end, or in Plyr. Please give it a shot, reproduce the issue in the simplest way possible.. Well done, you've reproduced the issue \ud83d\udc4f\nI can confirm, the issue exists on my phone.\n@sampotts iOS fullscreen for embedded players looks.. impossible? By my understanding: iOS only allows fullscreening of native html5 video elements (hence the need for plyr's iosNative option), but the youtube html5 video element is inside a cross-origin iFrame, which means plyr JS code can't touch it. That pen is using a very old version: https://cdn.plyr.io/3.2.4/plyr.js\nThat said, I think I know the issue you were having, and it was fixed in 3.4.4. To provide another data point, I've got this issue too. I have been meaning to look into it, but struggling with time ATM.. @sampotts if you could please confirm you don't already have this one in-progress or figured out, I can do my best to make some time?. My bad, it looks like adding rangetouch does fix this for me.\nThough the stock plyr range slider seems to be significantly more broken than a stock standard range slider in iOS. Normal sliders are a bit fiddly, but the plyr one is completely unusable for me without rangetouch.\nWould be nice to fix, but not a priority for me. I'm happy with rangetouch - great little util!. OK, right you are. Sorry, I only tested on my own. Same problem for me on iphone ios12 with your example.. RE: Tap to pause: I agree with Sam on the appropriate functionality. Though one way to make it a little more friendly would be to pop up a big pause button in the centre of the video after the first tap.\nRE: Black box flicker: I'm going to be doing a minor mobile controls PR soon, and can look at this while I'm at it. Thanks @BReyell for the pointer-events tip.. IMO this is too niche. Could be hacked about with additional JS.. Right you are. I didnt even know about forward/back buttons. Should be logical and a small matter to update lastSeekTime during those events too?. Have updated the code to use jpeg sprites, and have generated jpeg sprites for the blue moon demo video, and updated my demo page accordingly. It is much snappier now.. - Fixed bug: Edge seek errors: Replaced array spread with Array.from()\n- Fixed IE11 bug: seek time was offset to the left. Required an extra container div to facilitate this. ",

Don't use ARIA if you don't have to.\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/#first-rule-of-aria-use \n. Thx for looking into this. I hope I can recommend the player as fully accessible in the near future. \n. - Works with NVDA 2015.2 in Firefox \n- Works with Jaws 16 and 15 in IE11. \n- Unfortunately VoiceOver still ignores the <label>'s for toggle mute and captions. (OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 with Safari 8.0.7). You're hiding them with opacity: 0, that shouldn't impact VoiceOver. I can't explain this behaviour. \n. Hi, looks like all controls are read by most screenreader-browser-combinations now. Good job. \nUnfortunately \"aria-pressed\" is not well supported. Using toggle buttons like the play-pauze button would be better. \"Mute - unmute\", \"captions on - captions off\". That 'll work for every screenreader in any context. Again, if you can do it without ARIA, that's always better.\nRegarding captions with live regions. This is more of a problem then an enhancement. You're using aria-live=\"assertive\" and captions are on by default. The \"assertive\" property interrupts screenreaders, regardless of what they're doing. Therefore you're forcing screenreader users to listen to the captions. Captions are primarily meant for people with hearing problems, not visually impaired users. I would recommend undoing this.\n. @MichielBijl , our own tests. VoiceOver ignored it. Jaws and NVDA have support. My colleague tested with Supernova, popular in Belgium and the Netherlands. To my surprise, even Supernova supports it. So only VoiceOver (with Safari) is a problem. So I humbly take back my statement, support is better then I thought. We didn't test with older browser versions or mobile.\n. Any chance this gets fixed? I can no longer recommend Plyr as a good alternative in our accessibility audits until this gets solved. Sorry I can't help out personally. Limited experience with JS.\n.

Not sure how I didn't notice this earlier, but the current implementation has some unintended consequences/bugs.\nFor example, Using the early listener and preventDefault()/stopImmediatePropagation(), I should ideally be able to prevent the defaultListener from executing. However, the current implementation only ensures that the userListener runs before defaultListener.\nAn example of this can be found in this fiddle\nI'll try and quickly come up with a PR for this.. Currently, this just appends track elements. This should allow dynamic loading of track elements.\nMy reasoning for not handling delete is this:\nWhen the video changes (_updateSource() called), it makes no sense to preserve track elements. So I would think that this is the right place to get rid of existing track elements. I also can't think of any (other) cases where one may want to get rid of loaded track elements.\nIn terms of full control, it makes sense to give them an API call to delete track elements, but I'm not sure how often it will be used.\nGiven my lack of knowledge on this, I will leave the decision up to you. Let me know if you want me to make changes and I will gladly get them done.\nPerhaps it is best to leave(close?) this issue as is until #143 is completed. #143 is in some ways a super-set of this. Also, It makes no sense to add new track elements if _setupCaptions() still only picks the first one.\n. closing since it's probably irrelevant now.\n. Would you like something like this?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gurupras/7oy55wuy/. Would you like something like this\nLet me know what you guys think and I'll create a PR accordingly. I've never had issues with multiple plyr objects on the same page.\nCould you throw up some code on jsfiddle or something and share it? Might be able to better help you that way.\n. Not quite.\nChrome still plays captions natively whereas plyr goes down a code path\nthat thinks it cannot play them natively.\nI'm not sure if that's okay or if it makes more sense to have it render\nnatively.. (Perhaps there are some performance implications?)\nI'll leave that decision to you.\nOn Feb 20, 2016 8:30 PM, \"Sam Potts\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for your fix, can we close this one now?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/162#issuecomment-186716490.\n.

I'm confused..Isn't yourplayermodalobject _inside_ the anonymous function that is bound to.episode .video-link'sclick` event? This would mean that the scope of this variable is only within this anonymous function.\nIn that case, if you defined $('.close, .overlay').bind('click', function(e) {...} outside of this anonymous function, the browser is expected to complain about not finding playermodal.\nIf instead, your code looked like the following:\n```\nvar playermodal;        // new line\njQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n    $('.episode .video-link').bind('click', function(e) {\n        ...\n        ...\n        playermodal = plyr.setup('.modal.video')[0];        // no 'var'..forcing global scope\n        ...\n    });\n$('.close, .overlay').bind('click', function(e) {\n    ...\n    playermodal.destroy();        // Should not fail\n    console.log(\"DESTROYED!\");\n});\n\n});\n```\n. Check out this example: https://jsfiddle.net/gurupras/0wx9e754/\nAs you will see, the player variable in that example is never undefined after the initial video load.\n. Let me know if you want me to squash these commits. There is at least one unused file that made it into git history.\n. There's supposedly a big update in the works. I could make progress on this, but it would just mean massive merge conflicts once that update hits. Hence, I've sort of paused work on this till the big update is up. As it is, this PR changes a lot of code since it tries to re-use a lot of the helper functions that Plyr uses.. Closing this and opening a new PR #706. Sorry, try this..\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gurupras/99420bsv/\nedit:\nI fixed the link in the original post.. Interesting. Yeah, it works after I get rid of the CSS hacks. Thanks, I probably messed up the CSS in some way. Feel free to close the issue.. Done and done. I'll keep working on implementing the remaining functionality. You should be able to merge my branch into master without issues. The stuff that's checked in the OP works AFAIK.. It is incomplete. I need to spend some time and get the captions done and support the streaming options. That said, it does work for simple HTML5 videos loaded via <video src='...'> \nI'll work on hosting a page with the google-cast version of it built-in so that people can use it to get a sense of what works.\n. Alright, in that case it's ready to be merged and put up for a basic demo.\nI'll work on getting the captions done and try to get a version of HLS/Shaka/DASH working.\n. You should just be able to run gulp and then have it work. The branch modifies the default set of controls to include the google-cast button.. Ah crap. This is probably due to the fact that the google-cast plugin crashes during initialization when window.chrome is not defined (which wouldn't be defined on browsers other than Chrome). This in turn probably breaks the remaining plyr initialization logic. \nI don't know how to add a button on some browsers and not on others in plyr, but I can certainly prevent it from breaking everything else. Let me do that right now.. Yeah, the problem is, I don't know if I should do something like that inside the plyr source.\nI'll wait for @sampotts to comment on this and then figure out how to move forward.. \u200bAt this point, I've sort of stopped working on this since there's a couple of directions to go down and I'm not sure which is the right one.\nOne is to write a custom receiver so that the styling of the player on your TV matches Plyr, or, at the very least, is superior to the default one. The other is to leave that to the applications (that make use of Plyr) and just give them a bare-bones implementation that uses the default receiver.\nThere is obviously work required to get live streaming videos to work, but, I'm sort of trying to help test Plyr and come up with bugfixes where I can.. This feature works. You're welcome to merge it and have a working\nrudimentary cast support. I just haven't found the time to design it better\nand decide whether to support the new CAF player.\nOn Tue, Aug 28, 2018 at 10:13 PM, Mitch notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAny updates on this?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/pull/706#issuecomment-416800016, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACzB18rP_TZyicKlMRcK2BPNK2paRr_iks5uVfisgaJpZM4QSg7w\n.\n. I'll update the PR to be mergeable with the master branch.\n\nLast I checked, the PR works for HTML5 videos like mp4 and webm. The biggest outstanding issue with this PR is that I don't know how to get things like HLS/DASH to work. \nThere is also the question of whether attempts to play content from YouTube, etc should use plyr or the YouTube (cast) app.\nI'll try and spend some time this week to see if I can improve the PR.. You should be able to do this with the existing listeners functionality. I needed similar functionality and have successfully overridden the play/pause behavior of plyr.\nHere's the bare minimum you need to get started.\nvar plyr = new Plyr('#video', {\n    listeners: {\n        seek: function (e) {\n            e.preventDefault() // required on v2\n            // Your code here\n            return false    // required on v3\n        }\n    }\n})\nThis works because all functions specified in listeners are bound before the default handlers. By using event.preventDefault() / return false, you are able to override the default plyr behavior. This is documented in the Options part of the Readme.\n. This should already work to some extent. I recall using this feature as far back as the US presidential debates. Here's a sample. Your requested feature can probably be accomplished once Issue #832 is resolved.\nHere's a pen showing how to accomplish it. If you issue player.forward(20) once you start playing the video, it works as expected. Are you trying to start playing the video from 20 seconds in?. It works as expected. The problem is that you're not waiting for ready before trying to forward\nTry the following:\nconst player = new Plyr('#player');\nplayer.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log('currentTime:', player.currentTime);\n  player.forward(20);  // This seems to trigger play as well\n  console.log('forward currentTime:', player.currentTime);\n})\nHere's your fiddle modified. Cool! Your solution definitely works.\nIIRC, the way plyr sets up handlers doesn't lend itself to having return false work. \n```\n        const proxy = (event, handlerKey, defaultHandler) => {\n            const customHandler = this.player.config.listeners[handlerKey];\n        // Execute custom handler\n        if (utils.is.function(customHandler)) {\n            customHandler.call(this.player, event);\n        }\n\n\n        // Only call default handler if not prevented in custom handler\n        if (!event.defaultPrevented && utils.is.function(defaultHandler)) {\n            defaultHandler.call(this.player, event);\n        }\n    };\n\n```\nLeaving issue open since I feel this should be included in the library rather than have me implement it manually. But I'll defer to @sampotts. . Doesn't seem to be working for me.. Works perfectly \ud83d\udc4d . I missed this while out of town. This issue is still present as of v3.3.21. Here's a pen\nA slightly related issue that I will point out (while attempting to fix this) is that although the documentation lists pause as a valid event that we can bind an early-listener to, it seems impossible for me to get the code to trigger this in the current implementation.. Ah yes, this is because there is no pause event. Not sure if this change was documented (or intended).\nThe relevant code is shown below, and as you can see, the only event that is triggered is the play event.\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/ad72ebd4bbf487e56884d264a4bb13119fb687b5/src/js/listeners.js#L496-L501\nRegardless, you can handle it like this now:  \n``\nplyr = new Plyr(el, {\n  listeners: {\n    play (e) {\n      if (plyr.playing) {\n        ...\n      } else {\n        ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}). Sorry, you're right. I meant to say that there is no _listener_ for thepauseevent anymore. Theplaylistener can however be multiplexed to handle pauses as shown above.\n. ~~This does seem to be the default HTML5 video behavior. Unfortunately, attempting to pause onseeked` doesn't seem to work~~\n. Yeah, you're right. I think it may have been some listener I had active without realizing. I tried reproducing this on the w3org-mediaevents page and was unsuccessful.\nThe core problem pointed out in this issue still holds though.\nShould I just handle this manually rather than expect plyr to do it for me? I need to seek to a specific part of the video while also ensuring that the video state is respected. To do this, I'm currently having to do the following:\nplyr.on('canplay', function () {\n  if (startTime !== 0) {\n    // Changing currentTime seems to implicitly trigger play\n    plyr.on('seeked', function _once () {\n      plyr.off('seeked', _once)\n      if (expectedState === 'paused') {\n        // Directly calling plyr.pause() does not work for some reason\n        setTimeout(() => { plyr.pause() }, 10)\n      }\n      plyr.currentTime = startTime\n    }\n  })\n}). I thought I did follow the issue template, but yes, I should've made it a lot more clearer that the issue was with youtube/vimeo and not native HTML videos. The fact that I had an unreproducible follow-up comment  only made it worse. Sorry about that.. I'm able to reproduce the issue reported here. I have also confirmed that it only occurs on YouTube. Here's a pen to reproduce this issue.\n. I need help with progressive enhancement. I'm trying to get a sense of what this is right now, but currently, I have no idea on what it is or how it's implemented in the code.. I have reasonably good experience with puppeteer if we do end up going that way. I'm not very good at writing stuff from scratch, but if someone can come up with a basic framework for doing this, I'm sure I can help quite a bit.\n. Is there any way we can we get to work in the general case? I'd like to dynamically add textTracks to HTML5 videos. How can I achieve this? Here's an example\n. > Not sure why you're doing it via the dom.\nI was checking if my code works for the native HMTL5 player (it does) and was hence doing it via the DOM. Why is it that I'm able to add a TextTrack and have it work via the native player but not through Plyr?\nIn my usecase, ideally, I'd like to set it up to use src rather than go through each cue and add it manually.. It does work without Plyr: Here's the same example with the native player.. right, sorry, I do have that enabled.

I feel like this issue should be closed. There are two resolved issues that are very related to this. Please look at #755 and #806.. The other PR still attempts to look up the height of videos by the size attribute, so in that regard, yes. However, I don't know if the right step forward is to use a custom attribute like label and badge.. @friday @philipgiuliani: Kindly take a look at this and provide feedback. Ah, my bad. Updated.. I don't know how to be a 100% whether this is/isn't a breaking change.\n\nCurrently, on plyr.io, plyr.quality returns a Number, this implementation returns a String.  In other words, this implementation returns the current quality label. This may count as a breaking change..\nAlso, at the moment, I just noticed that there seems to be a bug with the setter plyr.quality = '1080', I'll fix this ASAP.. No worries at all.

I've incorporated most of the code-related feedback and made some fixes. Inviting more comments/feedback.\n\nIf required, I can add the default badge logic in this PR as well. I'm currently hesitant to make a separate PR for it as it would lead to some annoying merge conflicts if this PR were to be approved.. Does the video load and play? I've had issues where the vimeo video has refused to load accompanied by the same error you're having.. 100% doable. I think we've tackled this a couple of times before in #806 and #755.\nHere's a pen for you.. There are no rounded corners. Something in your CSS is causing this. Possibly styling on the container element. Here's a pen that proves this.. I tested this out extensively and it works. Using this.value throws an error stating TypeError: 'this' is undefined. Also, I'm probably wrong, but I believe plyr.volume is the input?\n. Ah crap. I didn't check for this. Sorry.\n. Don't know how to fix this linting error.. Is 272p or 408p legitimate? My understanding from your post on Slack was that the 'p' represents widescreen resolutions. Formally it's progressive scanning rather than interlaced.. Shall I replace this with just \nif (is.array(options) {\n  this.options.quality = options\n}\n. Removing badge in favor of default logic. The template literal is to ensure that label conforms to the laid down rule (by me) that label is a String.\nUpdated with your suggestion. This is neat. I like being able to specify label, badge via data- attributes.. Although badge should be based on height in theory, piggy-backing on the existing i18n requires the height to be 480. A value of 482 (if it were the case) would generate no badge despite being the real height of the video. I think I will update this to implement the closest solution Sam was mentioning.. It's referenced here. I don't think that's the order you want.\n[\"576\", \"1080\", \"720\"].sort()\n[\"1080\", \"576\", \"720\"]\nThe previous implementation was actually doing it by height. At least on plyr.io.. Okay, replacing with the old logic for now.. Part of your comment, I think, is referring to the fact that this setter is trying to account for number/string/object all-in-one.\nThe number version was added just now to be backwards compatible. At least with plyr.io. It wasn't meant to handle index.\nThe string version is to cater to users wanting to set it by label.\nThe object version is mainly to handle the internal implementation wherein:\nuser clicks quality option --> translate event.target.value into quality somehow. This was where the object came into play.\nNow, with the suggestion to remove index attribute and use it as the value while creating radio button, we can update the quality setter to receive, for example, either [\"0\", 0, { index: 0 }]. I opted for the object implementation to allow sufficient differentiation.. You're right. Fixed and pushed. Sorry, could you elaborate? I don't quite understand what I should do about that line.\nShould the 'play' become 'togglePlay'?. ",

If I understand the question correctly, you want to have one Video autoplaying, and onclick, you want another Video played?\nIf so, hav'a look at this:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        player1 = $('#bg-video');\n        player2 = plyr.setup('#fg-plyr')[0];</p>\n<pre><code>    player1.on('click', function() {\n        document.getElementById(\"bg-video\").pause();\n        document.getElementById(\"fg-plyr\").style.display = \"block\";\n        document.getElementById(\"bg-video\").style.display = \"none\";\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n```\nSo all you would need to do, is change the first \"src\", to the video, you want to play in the background, and then change the \"data-video-id\" to the yt-video-id, you want to play, when you click the BG-Video.\nAnd, you also need to import plyr, so here's'a link to the complete thingy on codepen: http://codepen.io/anthyG/pen/WwJojB\nHere are the links, to the Sources I used:\n1. https://github.com/Selz/plyr\n2. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp\n3. http://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/\nYou could add something like a hoverelement, that the user can see over the BG-Video.\nAnd you may could also add a Poster for the Video e.g. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_video_poster\nBut in Plyr it is (from the docs):\nposter(...)    String   Set the poster url. This is supported for the video element only.\nI tried my best, but if I misunderstood, just tell :)\n. This may be off-topic, but it would be nice, if you would mark my answer on stackoverflow as the solution, or whatever it's called, because it actually is my first on there :+1: \nGreat I could help!! :smiley: \n. Tell me if I'm wrong, but I think that's illegal\n. @zulhfreelancer, Well, by illegal, I mean, that YouTube at it's base, does not allow to download \"Files\".\n(I actually have to say, that I download Videos sometimes)\nBUT, that \"download-button\" would require a Serverside Script I bet, and that means, that the Serverhoster (or whatever), is responsible for all the Videos, the user downloads. And the user can, if he has enough knowledge of using Plyr in the Console etc., change the source too!\nThis in the end, is pretty risky, not only in terms of copyright etc., but also in terms of Serverload!\n. @SamPotts Maybe the user could choose, which format to download?\nAnd if the source is a YouTube or Vimeo video, then there could be a \"go-to\"-link, meaning a redirection to the Video on YouTube or Vimeo.\nMaybe :D\n. If I am right, that with \"custom cover overlay\", you mean like a thumbnail, then have a look at this:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        pic1 = $('#bg-pic');\n        player1 = plyr.setup('#fg-plyr')[0];</p>\n<pre><code>    pic1.on('click', function() {\n        document.getElementById(\"fg-plyr\").style.display = \"block\";\n        document.getElementById(\"bg-pic\").style.display = \"none\";\n        player1.play();\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n```\nYou just need to change the src of #bg-pic to your wanted image, and then change the \"data-video-id\" to the yt-video-id, you want to play, when you click #bg-pic.\nYou can also change the data-type from \"youtube\" to \"vimeo\", and then use the vimeo-video-id in data-video-id\nAnd, of course, you need to import plyr, just check the complete thingy out here:\nhttp://codepen.io/anthyG/pen/reEKWg\nHere are the links, to the Sources I used:\n1. https://github.com/Selz/plyr\n2. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp\n3. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp\nYou could add something like a hoverelement, that the user can see over the #bg-pic.\nAnd you may could also add a Poster for the Video e.g. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_video_poster\nBut in Plyr it is (from the docs):\nposter(...)

Well, I don't have an iPhone neither I am like \"the best\" programmer, so I may won't be able to help with that, but anyways..\nWhat do you mean with \"it doesn't stop\"?\nDo you mean that it just loads forever, or do you mean that you can't stop playback?\n. Hmm, if you tested this on Codepen, it could may even be a bug on Codepen..\n..but that is just a speculation\nAnd I believe that it is pretty weird that the play() method is not working with youtube videos on the iPhone 6.\n. I just checked the Pen, and recognized that the Plyr version was 1.5.21, so I just updated to 1.6.16.. Maybe that was the problem?\n. Well this isn't a Issue,.. or is it? :thought_balloon: \n. Short answer: No.\nThe reason here is that Plyr does actually just uses the HTML5-Video-Tag (As far as I know). And that only supports MP4, WebM and Ogg.\nJust use an online converter or so, to convert your .avi file(s) to MP4 or one of the other two, or both :wink: \nHere'sa link to a good website explaining the Video Tag:\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp\n. But actually the youtube video loads, if it is in a playlist..\nSo maybe there could be a way to bypass that :thought_balloon: \n. Not that I know of, but anyways, it was just a though :)\n. ",

Hi Sam,\nI don't really know the changes required here but what I know is that I passed last couple of days to implement requirejs with node.js and the way the files are optimized and required is just a pain in... so I checked and it seems that webpack is the new robust method for that. So I'll change my implementation of plyr and will come back to you if I got better knowledge on AMD modules.\n. To add more info on this.

Hmm... Actually, does that imply the media object is \"reset\" with every call to source()? This would destroy any custom uses on the orginal object, for example if you have audio effects set up on it, they will be gone.\n. I can confirm the issue above. In my app, I have a 10-band equalizer connected to an <audio> element. If I set the audio source with player.source(), the bands are disconnected (since the audio element is reset) and thus the effects are gone. If I manually set the source URL directly on player.media.src instead, the effects are well kept.\n. Just curious, and sorry for my ignorance, but why does the element need to be changed? I have a feeling doing so is prone to even more problems than what I've just mentioned.\n. I'd sugges then to add something like a plyr-unavailable (for the lack of a better name) class instead of hiding/removing it entirely, so that users can style as they deem fit.\n. Which can, by default, hide the bar away of course.\n. You're the man!\n. May I suggest https://github.com/andreruffert/rangeslider.js? I'm using it in the same project with very good result.\n.

    "alejandroiglesias": "@SamPotts so is it affecting YouTube or not? I see that the current Plyr code disables controls on iOS for YouTube besides Vimeo.. We found this issue today on an Android device with the latest Chrome version. The YouTube video stays frozen on 0:00 and displays an \"If playback doesn't start shortly, try restarting your device\" message. Doesn't happen embedding in a different way by using YouTube Iframe API directly.\n\n\"If playback doesn't start shortly, try restarting your device.\". I fixed that issue by disabling autoplay on mobile devices. Sadly, had to implement that by user agent sniffing, but found a way to check for autoplay on mobile that I hadn't implemented yet.. I would like to reopen this because the aforementioned Chrome issue says the error is fixed for when calling HTMLMediaElement.pause before HTMLMediaElement.play, but calling HTMLMediaElement.play and then HTMLMediaElement.pause while the media is loading still throws the error.\n```\n// fixed\nmedia.pause();\nmedia.play();\n// won't fix; still shows the issue.\nmedia.play();\nmedia.pause();\n```\nHTMLMediaElement.play is async and returns a promise. The error complains about having called HTMLMediaElement.pause before the playback started.\nI would like to quote to the Chromium issue owner:\n\nThis has been resolved a long time ago. If you are seeing an error but that your website otherwise behave exactly the same, this is not a bug in Chrome but in your website. If you are seeing an error in the console and your website stopped behaving properly, please file another bug with a test page.\n\nIn this case, everything behaves exactly the same and it won't get fixed by the Chromium team because the call to HTMLMediaElement.play returns a promise that gets resolved when the media element is ready to play. At that point, the call to HTMLMediaElement.pause can be made. Since we rely on Plyr to handle HTMLMediaElement, it should either know about the promise returned by HTMLMediaElement.play and smartly call HTMLMediaElement.pause when it's resolved, or at least provide a way to interact with the promise by returning it when calling plyr.play. I tried to look at plyr.isPaused() and plyr.getMedia().paused in order to work around it myself, but they're false even though they didn't start playing yet because of buffering. I also tried to use plyr.getMedia().play() instead of plyr.play() in order to get the promise and then always call pause/stop when the promise resolves, but eventually, I get the error again, so maybe I'm missing something. I think that Plyr could keep a track of this promise internally so that users don't need to worry about this issue.. @SamPotts congratulations! I'm also to have a little boy in about 12 weeks. \nDo you need any help with this feature? Can you walk me a bit through the code in order to attempt it? Thanks and best wishes.. @samhibberd great! \ud83d\ude03 . Hey @samhibberd @SamPotts, any progress on this?. @SamPotts @samhibberd I opened a PR (#570) for Wistia support. Even though it looks code-complete, I can only hear the audio from the video, but no image (black image). Do you have any hints? Is it possible for you to take a look/test it so that we can debug that and complete the PR?\nThanks.. @samhibberd thanks for chiming in. I looked at your commit and copied a couple of lines for the JS file, but overall it's hard to tell what is related to Wistia and what is related to upgrading Plyr from 2.0.10 to 2.0.11. Can you please point specifically something for me to look into?. @dswitzer see this.. @nam-co you should be able to autoplay HTML5 videos on all major mobile browsers if they're also muted (ie, have the muted attribute).\nhttps://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/\nhttps://www.chromestatus.com/features/4864052794753024. I stumbled upon this today and is an issue at the moment.\n@sampotts I see that there's an _off function in the code that's commented out. Is there any chance to get this?. @frazerf are you getting an instance on players? Is the other log appearing on your console? Can you listen to the ready event and see if it gets triggered?. You could achieve more or less the same with the following set of options:\n{\n  autoplay: true, \n  clickToPlay: false,  // so clicking doesn't pause it\n  controls: [],  // no controls\n  keyboardShorcuts: {focused: false, global: false},  // no keyboard interaction\n  loop: true, \n  volume: 0\n}\nStill:\n Loop for YouTube videos doesn't seem to work (see #560). You could still try to use an event listener on the ended event to restart playback by calling restart() (the ended event doesn't seem to fire on Vimeo if loop is enabled according to the docs, so it would be used just for fixing YouTube).\n Even though you set no controls, there's still a gradient on the bottom of the video (where the controls should be) if you mouse over it. This could be easily fixed with CSS by forcing display: none !important; on .plyr__controls.\nI agree it would be handy to have one single background option but I would propose to have it for all types of videos, not just Vimeo.. I'm also experiencing that the loop option doesn't work for a YouTube video. I think the YouTube API loop parameter works only for playlists (not sure though). It worked for me recently (not using Plyr, just YT.Player directly) by making a playlist with only one video:\njavascript\nyoutubePlayer.loadPlaylist(videoId);\nThe downside is that it reloads the video each time. Another possibility that I haven't explored, is to seek to position 0 (zero) and replay.\n@SamPotts how is YouTube looping implemented on Plyr? Can you confirm it works?\n(PS: here is a very short video to test this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPEE9ZwTmy0). I'm trying to workaround this by doing:\njavascript\nplyr.on('ended', () => plyr.restart());\nThe event handler is executed but the video doesn't restart. This is the debug log:\n[Plyr] event: ended\n[Plyr] event: timeupdate \n[Plyr] event: seeking \n[Plyr] Seeking to 0.0000 seconds\n[Plyr] event: statechange\nI'm also trying to restart the playback manually by calling plyr.restart() as well as plyr.rewind() && plyr.play() on the browser console but nothing seems to make it play again.\n[Plyr] event: ended\n[Plyr] event: statechange\n$0.plyr.restart()\n[Plyr] event: timeupdate\n[Plyr] event: seeking\n[Plyr] Seeking to 0.0000 seconds\n(Notice that $0.plyr refers to a Plyr instance in my browser console.). I found that in order for YouTube to replay, it needs a call to youtubePlayer.stopVideo() first. After that, calling plyr.play() works. So this is the workaround I implemented so far to get YouTube video looping:\njavascript\nplyr.on('ended', () => {\n  // Workaround for looping YouTube videos since that is not working on Plyr.\n  if (plyr.getType() !== 'youtube') return;\n  // YouTube needs a call to the `stopVideo` in order to be able to replay.\n  plyr.getEmbed().stopVideo();\n  plyr.play();\n});. I've opened a PR that you can test which implements loop functionality on YouTube. Beware that since it was made against the develop branch, it uses the new loop config structure (config.loop.active).. @SamPotts I would suggest as an advice keeping the develop branch\nproduction ready and all in-progress work to happen on a feature branch. In\nthat way, the latest features can be tested before they are released (as I\nthink @CudaCores intended).\nCheers!\nEl El mi\u00e9, 10 de may. de 2017 a las 22:34, Sam Potts \nnotifications@github.com escribi\u00f3:\n\nDevelop is not production ready otherwise it'd be in the master branch.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/560#issuecomment-300657867, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAdVgH06VCOqOEmOoI2TBXR2i9P14NI-ks5r4mW5gaJpZM4M-hjL\n.\n.

I asked for help but didn't receive much support. Given that this was made for Plyr 2.x and current version is 3.x and a major refactor seems to have been done, I don't see any chances of this being merged as is. You may want to look at the diff and try to re-implement with the latest master version. I don't have any time to attempt it since the project I needed this for discarded the idea of supporting Wistia and I don't have any spare time at the moment, especially if I stumble upon issues and get no help/support from maintainers that know the code better than me.. @victerryso yes, that's a typo indeed.. @burakozturk16 the typo is in the source code, not in the docs. The correct word is \"shortcut\".. \ud83d\ude04 . @sampotts I am having an issue in which the play is interrupted when I use the plyrInstance.source method while playing a file.

    "prock13": "@SamPotts: I also would like to deliver pre-rolls with your player.  So I took your player and attempted to add pre-rolls using Google's IMA HTML SDK (https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/).\nSo far I have a working prototype that delivers the prerolls in an adContainer absolutely positioned above the player and once the ad ends, it hides the container and plays the video.   \nHere is my example: https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/\nThe issues I am facing are the following:\n- I'm not sure how to make the YT and Vimeo videos play after the ad ends.  My code is looking for a video element and obviously they use iframes.\n- I'd like to dynamically pass the video source and not have to include links to .mp4's in the html.  With your player the  tags seem to be required in the html?  or is it just in this example?\n- I'm still trying to determine how to make the ads responsive (the Google SDK requires a size in order to select the appropriate creative).  For now I am forcing the player size.\nI know you have other items in your list to attend to, but given that I'm so close would you be willing to help finish this?\n. Thanks for the reply.  So I setup a much simpler example using only Vimeo in this case (because we have a Vimeo Pro account and that's what I need to get working).  \nIn regards to my points, after correcting how I was getting the instance of the player, I was able to use the API to play the Vimeo video after the ad completes.  The other issue I had is that I was trying to create a listener for when the video finished playing, in case we wanted to show a post-roll, but I'm still working through how do to do that correctly in the Google SDK.\nIt does in fact seem that I can't add the source dynamically without having an original element.  That's not a huge issue, but it would be best to load the video source after the ad finishes instead of taking the hit when the player originally loads.  I'll keep looking into this.\nI'm also going to spend some more time on responsive and the ad size issue.\nFinally, as for making this part of the core or an add-on, I think it would work best as an add-on given that I have not touched the core code at all as of now.  Now, once we start looking to do mid-roll ads, then we will need the ability to tell when the player is half way through the video so we can pause it, show the ad and then start the video back up.  It's possible the API may already have this but I haven't checked yet.\nHere's the simple Vimeo example that I setup:\nhttp://dev.salvogroup.co/plyr-master/examples/vimeo/\n. This does not work for me:\nvar player = document.querySelector('.js-media-player').plyr;\nplayer.addEventListener('ready', function() {\n    var player = event.target.plyr;\n});\nI get a type error.  Any ideas why?\n. That works but I'm still not sure how to set an eventListener for when the video ends (in this case Vimeo if it's different that YT or regular video).  Mind modifying the event example above to listen for \"ended\"?\n. Also, as you can see here: http://dev.salvogroup.co/plyr-master/examples/vimeo/\nIt's working now.

I think you're 90% there, I don't think there's any need to support HLS directly because if the browser supports it then it's already there, if it doesn't then it's definitely preferable to look at the more modern DASH.\nDASH on the other hand is a pretty complex standard, I definitely think you can lean on Google's work on Shaka (barring any licensing issues).\nhttps://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/Meeting-Minutes suggests\n\nShaka also supports a subset of DASH (no emsg support, no multi-period).\n\nwhich I'm unfamiliar with but something that could determine a switch to the dashif library.\nThe plyr.io API would let the client specify a list of sources and feature requirements, and determine what is required from that.\nFor example the player initializer might specify an mp4 URL, a m3u8 HLS URL, and an mpd URL, and on iOS this would result in the m3u8 being set as the video src, while on an MSE-enabled browser would result in loading Shaka and initializing it with the mpd.\nFrankly a lot of the additional features supported by DASH seem very specific (https://bitmovin.com/mpeg-dash-vs-apple-hls-vs-microsoft-smooth-streaming-vs-adobe-hds/ has a comparison table), so the above might be a good start.\n.

I've got something that does that using the custom controls html: http://codepen.io/jwjcmw/pen/pedQRL . perhaps the controls could follow the order that they are in the controls array.  I do like being able to include some non-standard stuff in the custom html, though.. +1 to tree-shaking and custom controls!. I actually came across this in another project which is webpack based...I just was trying to use codesandbox as a demonstration...did you view it in chrome?  It is just that part of the code which doesn't work...everything else seems to, which is very strange.  I'm guessing this is something with babel.. OK, so I figured this out...what you don't want to do is set a variable like this:\nconst Plyr = require(\"plyr\");\nbecause then when plyr is checking the type of the plyr object when returning the event (lines 605 and 14 of utils.js) using \"window.Plyr\", it returns null.\nIt actually fails with both the import or the require...the key was the variable name.  It looks like that is the only place that type check (is.plyr) is used, so that was the only thing that was failing.  I don't see any other references to window.Plyr in the plyr code.\nAlso...this is fine:\nconst plyr = require(\"plyr\");. Edited title and first post to reflect actual issue...closing now.. works for me...thanks!. This looks like the same thing as #1062 . I'm just here to +1 this issue.  I've got a pen showing the issue with 3.3.23 here\nhttps://codepen.io/jwjcmw/pen/mjzWRQ\nas with @wizedesign above, I just copied in the controls example verbatim..

    "frumbert": "I see the same except without full screen. when the body is at a ratio wider than 16:9, the player controls and video both slip off the bottom of my viewable surface. In my code the plyr is in a div as a child of the body, like so\n<body>\n    <div data-video-id=\"12345\" data-type=\"vimeo\"></div>\n</body>\nand I've styled body, html to be full view height:\nhtml, body { height: 100vh; overflow:hidden; }\nIn my case I had to add a height hack\n.plyr, .plyr .plyr__video-embed iframe { max-height: 100vh; }\nso that neither the player controls nor the underlying natural embed can grow higher than this. I'm still also trying to figure out a suitable workaround for the undocumented soundcloud player\n. plyr v2.0.17, Youtube full screen, Windows 7\n\n. Crap, I'm such an idiot.\n. I'd been following somebody's notes where the user had used the markup <div data-track-id=\"GguF5lui57U\" data-type=\"youtube\">, but of course the actual data attribute name is <div data-video-id=\"GguF5lui57U\" data-type=\"youtube\">. Having a data-type but no proper source attribute was confusing the code.\n. On 1.8.12 I still have to destroy the actual plyr instance in order to make the video dissapear. If I then create a new instance, I get an uncaught typeerror - cannot set property 'embed' of undefined.\nExample:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/6okm62pf/4/\n1. Just run it and click destroy - the video temporarily goes away then comes back (Vimeo video seems to be calling back and recreating itself).\n2. Click Destroy & RemoveChild - everything looks fine, no errors\n3. Now click Create - you get the set property error, and plyr ins't properly set up, even though it should technically be setup up on a new dom node. \nI realise that if i'm changing source then I should be using player.source and giving it its new sources - but I can't make that work once/if the existing player is destroyed - https://jsfiddle.net/6okm62pf/7/ (clicking Create without first destroying the player still works).\nthe destroy method still doesn't return the DOM object to its original state - the setup is destructive to the data-video-id and data-type attributes, if set.\n. can you not seek then play, to put the player into a playable state?\n_instance.on(\"ready\", function (event) {\n        event.detail.plyr.seek(0);\n        event.detail.plyr.play();\n});\n. dupe??\n. I found that if the player is initialised on a dom node and then that dom node is moved (say, to a modal overlay), the player still works but listeners for the play/pause/ended functions no longer fire, and it's the fact that the node has moved away from where it was initialised that causes the plyr--stopped and plyr--playing to stop getting applied to the container.\nI found this out by first initialising the playing the player, then moving it to a different node when the user began a navigation event that re-pulled content to the page - I had wanted to keep the video playing whilst that navigation loaded and the elements around the video changed.\nThat seems to be what is going on in this pen as well - the plyr is initialised THEN the modal is created and the video element is put into it. When it's html5, it doesn't seem to be a problem since I guess the way it initialises and holds reference to those events/nodes (e.g. the  node is already inside the container?) . I also stumbled apon this in 2.0.17 in Firefox when destroying then recreating the same original item after it has changed position in the DOM...\nIt would be good if you could simply pass an instance.off('eventname') to unbind each event, since I often bind to anonymous functions rather than function names (yes yes, I know). Or if I could assign the event to a variable then dispose the variable - https://stackoverflow.com/a/45086170 is a neat example of this.. IN my case the player is being used within an iframe in a cms. That iframe has a fixed height by design, but a dynamic width (98%, for some ungodly reason). I can control my vimeo player code, but not the cms it's included onto. I'm trying to prevent cropping.. I'm happy enough with a hack for my case, which is to first set the container width to the 16:9 ratio of its height after initialisation, then when the video resizes, calculate the height of the player based on the width of the internal video, so that the controls / captions appear in the correct spot. (assuming there's only one instance as well). I also set .plyr{margin:0 auto} in styles.\n// ensure 16:9 on resize\n(function() {\n  window.addEventListener(\"resize\", resizeThrottler, false);\n  var resizeTimeout;\n  function resizeThrottler() {\n    if ( !resizeTimeout ) {\n      resizeTimeout = setTimeout(function() {\n        resizeTimeout = null;\n        actualResizeHandler();\n       }, 66);\n    }\n  }\n  function actualResizeHandler() {\n    var e = document.querySelector(\".plyr__video-wrapper\"); // the video INSIDE plyr div\n    if (!e) return;\n    var h = e.offsetHeight;\n    var w = (h * 16) / 9;\n    document.querySelector(\"div.plyr\").style.width = w + \"px\";\n    document.querySelector(\"div.plyr\").style.height = h + \"px\";\n  }\n}());\n\ndomReady(function () {\nvar _player =plyr.setup({\n    keyboardShortcuts: {\n        global: true\n    }\n})[0];\ndocument.querySelector(\".plyr\").style.width = ((Math.max(document.documentElement.clientHeight, window.innerHeight || 0) * 16) / 9) + \"px\";\n_player.on(\"ready\", function (event) {\n        ... etc\n\nobviously needs some tidying up, but for my case it's \"good enough\". @aftereffectsmagic the code above is on the page that hosts the div that has the video id on it. That's all that's on the document body though - I've intended mine to be the only element within that page and it to (probably) be an iframe.\nAs I typed this, I remembered something else that I should (have yet to) try: Object Fit & its Polyfill. The fitjs plugin is just what I wanted:\nhttps://github.com/soulwire/fit.js\n. Glad it's fixed. Vimeo support is the primary reason I'm using this library - business users prefer Vimeo because it's back end is much better about ads and privacy and replacing content - (that and it's been easy enough for me to otherwise modify). Vimeo regularly breaks though, I hope this fix sticks for a while!. ",

I created a plyr.d.ts here: https://github.com/tdaines/plyr/blob/296-typescript-definitions/plyr.d.ts\nI'm not a typescript expert, but I think it should be sufficient.\n. Nice work @wagich. You should contribute this to https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped. Can you link me to this suggestion?  My understanding is that text tracks are for timed data, triggered by the position of the player, whereas thumbnails are triggered by the user and the onmouseover event.\n. It's your call.  I don't have a file of thumbnail URLs for my assets though, so pulling URLs from a file doesn't help me much.  Maybe I'm in the minority on that though.  I'm happy to help implement whatever.\n. @gehaktmolen I figured getting thumbnails can be fairly specific to each individual, so I left out the actual displaying of them from the PR.  You can see my test code for displaying the thumbnails here.  I just set the src and dimensions of the image and let the browser download the image.\n@gpapin While I agree an image sprite would be ideal, I don't have access to any videos with thumbnail sprites nor does my company create them for our videos.  If demand is there, I can work on a new PR to support thumbnail sprites once the new version of plyr comes out.. If I get some free time soon, I'll work on a v3 version of this PR.  Maybe as a plugin or something..

    "qikkeronline": "For other people who are looking to achieve this behaviour: I've worked around it atm like this:\nJS:\n```\n$('.plyr').on('ready', function(event) {\n$(this).addClass('plyr--init-hide-controls');\n\n}).on('play', function(event) {\n$(this).removeClass('plyr--init-hide-controls');\n\n});\n```\nand CSS:\n.plyr--init-hide-controls .plyr__controls {\n    opacity: 0;\n}\n. Actually; this is a far better solution (CSS only):\n```\n    .plyr--stopped .plyr__controls {\n    opacity: 0;\n\n}\n\n```\n. Worked around it like this:\n```\n    plyr.setup({\n    iconUrl: '#icon-' // see https://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/251\n\n});\n\n```\nChanged line 676 of plyr.js:\niconPath    = (!iconUrl.external ? iconUrl.url : '');\nAnd then I included the original SVG files in our own build but removed the plyr- prefix in the filenames.\n. Ah, i totally overlooked that option, thanks :-) \nRegarding the viewBox; do you see any possiblities there? I guess it could be difficult as each icon requires their own. But as far as my understanding goes; the inline viewBox attribute on the  element is required for older browsers (e.g. IE10 and 11..) to display the svgs in their correct proportions.\n. perhaps it is an idea to be able to pass a templates array so people can hook their  elements into the svg controls of the player. e.g.:\n```\nplyr.setup({\ntemplates: {\n\n    playLarge: '<use>... </use>',\n\n}\n\n});\n```\nWhere each seperate control ui element would have their own value in the array or so.\nThanks again for considering \ud83d\udc4d \n. For the time being; I guess the best tactic would be to write a bit of JS that goes through all of the <use> elements inside the player after it's finished loading; and then simlpy grab the viewBox values based on their ID and insert them \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yup, the viewBox attributes are set inside the SVG sprite (that is also the case for my own custom sprites). I might be wrong here; but at the time I built this system it was still required for IE in certain situations to also have the viewBox attribute on the <use> element itself. (I believe when using display: inline-block or so from the top of my head). For now I'll hook into the ready event and loop through it myself as it seems it might be specific to my situation. Let me know if you'd appreciate some more info on this; I'll then make sure I look into it at the end of this project and report back here.\n. I'll check it out when I'm done with the bulk of the work and report back here then (expect in +- 2 weeks). Thanks for the fast replies!\n. sorry totally forgot about this @SamPotts :) during our testing we didnt find any inconsistencies on IE :)\n. Any idea when this will be published?

I'm assuming this is for v2 because of the date. In v2 when plyr is not fully supported the interface isn't completely setup. iPhone is one of the cases where plyr is not fully supported. \nHere you can see that _setupInterface bails before the media events are bound: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plyr.js#L3539.\nAnd here: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/plyr.js#L3733, you can see that isIphone only has basic support. \nThere are a bunch of other issues with plyr and iOS so the dev just let iOS handle its own controls in v2. You can tell if plyr is fully supported by calling plyr.supported() and then only add the listeners you need directly on the media element or embed API. More work for us, but I think the dev did that to keep plyr reliable and maintainable.. @friday \nI'm getting the Unrecognized feature: 'autoplay' as a warning from the YouTube code on Chrome on my Mac, as well but plyr is, correctly, not treating that as an error. \nAlso, switching to Vimeo embed also causes plyr to throw an error but there's no Unrecognized feature: 'autoplay' warning happening there..

Otherwise it will trip people up, for instance as part of a deployment script you may automatically update you NPM dependencies, and if everyone followed semver that could be done with reasonable confidence you're not going to hose your release.\n. Awesome \ud83d\udc4d \nJust keep in mind it'll still trip people up who automatically get bumped to 1.9 though.\n. Completely agree! - Hence this issue thread, which started as a result of tests failing.\n. Yeah it's a bit annoying, I've made the mistake in the past of pushing an unwanted tag and they just force you to live with it. These days I just triple check everything before a npm publish.\n. Is it perhaps worth making the ready event a listener, similar to the listeners available for the controls? That way we can define our callback as part of the supplied options and this race condition might be avoided.. ",

But I'd like to migrate to using autoprefixer in the future.  I'm not sure what I'll do in the meantime though--I may just have to go through and switch the pertinent declarations to Compass versions so that I'll get prefixes where needed. \nIt might be good to put a brief comment in the variables SASS file letting folks know that prefixing is expected to be handled by them using autoprefixer, as I only caught this because I was getting wonky results in Chrome.\n. Yeah, no. I wouldn't want you to be adding them in manually--that'll drive you bonkers. :)\nAnd thanks for the PostCSS mention--I've got to do some research on what route forward makes sense for me.

But I think not everybody would be happy to have the readme not in English anymore\u2026. Have you tested your video without the plyr? Because plyr is just a wrapper for the <video> element.

Instead of started a separate topic \"my videos height is getting cropped\", I think it's related to this topic as well to this closed one https://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/438, I followed your suggestion about this articles\nbut it does not seem work yet.\nhttps://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php\nHere is the current CSS\n// 20170318\n// https://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/438\n// https://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php\n.PlyrvideoWrapper {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */\n    padding-top: 0px;\n    height: 0;\n}\n.PlyrvideoWrapper iframe {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\nhere is the extra div suggested in above article\n<div class=\"PlyrvideoWrapper\">\n<section id=\"js-plyr\">\n        <!--data-video-id=\"LKKO3yLErqg\"-->\n        <div data-type=\"youtube\"></div>\n</section>\n</div>\nHere is what I am seeing in Chrome when I shrink the height (simulating landscape on a phone) without necessarily going full-screen.  I guess the solution is that I would like to see more black border such that the full height of the movie is visible.\n\nI am way behind on learning CSS and how things get precedence.  I think I see plyr.css taking over and has similar setting to above.\n\nmy CSS above is compiled into main.css by ionic2\nlet me know if I post more info\n\nI put together a 4:3 movie with some guides, it might be helpful https://youtu.be/HWc8-HS1njE for anyone debugging.\n\nI will take any CSS suggestions that would get me closer to the goal.\nThanks\n. Ok Sam, good to know, I will undo that wrapper then.  Like I said I don't know enough about CSS regarding how classes (re)declarations take precedence, I will probably hit 6 foot under before I cross-out that TODO.  When I saw that post https://github.com/Selz/plyr/issues/339 I thought I hit jackpot :) \nPer your comment above PLYR handles 16:9 ratio fine.  Most of my vids start as 4:3 PowerPoint documents, however I reference lots and any types of videos on YouTube (nothing on Vimeo at this time).\n  So, I will wait for this issue to get resolved for 4:3 ratio, in the meantime could you suggest perhaps a work-around/kludge to force the PLYR controls to stay visible?  Is there any tricks with setting the width to 100vmin or such?\nThanks for a great component, I will work on other issues not related to plyr in the meantime.\n. I hacked a bit more at this issue and here are my finding (far from final)\nIn the following prototype code I am checking if we are in Landscape and we can fit a 16:9 video than use of styling class  PlyrVideoWrapper169 otherwise class PlyrVideoWrapper169.\nIf we are in Portrait W < H than assume we can always fit a 16:9\n\nHere is the current rendering cases in landscape and portrait, the way I understand them.\nCase 1: LANDSCAPE: player can occupy the whole width without cropping height\n\nCase 2: LANDSCAPE: player should NOT occupy the whole width otherwise it will crop its height\n\nCase 3: PORTRAIT: player should always be able to occupy 100% of the width without cropping its height.\n\nThe HTML template with the conditional class assignments follows\n\nIn the following CSS I need to make the hard-coded width : 80% take on the value of  Height / 9 * 16 \n\nCan the above logic be incorporated into PLYR or am I missing other cases?\nI still need to resolve how to hook into viewport size changes and react to it for a \"Responsive\" layout.\nBut again you must be doing that already, there is no point for to re-invent the wheel, if it something that could be handled in PLYR.\nThanks again!\nPS. my logic might be similar to the JS code shared above but I had a hard understand it nor do I know how to incorporate into my typescript/javascript/Angular2/Ionic2 zoo :)\n. Any fix for this? I have rewrote my CSS with a single div wrapper with the following CSS (your guidance is much appreciated)\n```\n// https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/371\n// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35176745/i-think-google-chrome-for-android-has-a-bizarre-viewport-height-error-and-it-sh\n// 20180413\n.PlyrVideo_Container {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    //\n    width: 90vw;\n    height: 100vh !important; // this is getting ignored ???\n    // display: flex;\n    // align-items: stretch;\n    // justify-content: space-around;  \n        @media all and (orientation:portrait) {\n            top: 10vh;\n            width: 100vw;\n        }\n\n}\nmy HTML template looks exactly like this:\n 20180413 \n\n v3.1.0 suggested using this div as the \"progressive enhancement\" \n\n        <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/?origin=https://plyr.io&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&enablejsapi=1\"\n        allowfullscreen\n        allowtransparency\n        allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n```\nI don't have an issue with portrait because I do set the container's width.  In landscape I would like to set the height. However, the player does not seem respond to the above height: 100vh setting no response either if I set the container to 80vh.  Why is that?\nThe problem is very visible when I am running in chrome on the Android device.\nIt appears it's not just the address bar height but the whole screen height is being mapped to 100vh.\nHere is a snapshot\n\nOn Windows chrome it's not reproducible, here are the rendering for a Galaxy S5 for example:\n\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/35176745/i-think-google-chrome-for-android-has-a-bizarre-viewport-height-error-and-it-sh\nI stumbled on this older issue of chrome on Android and its viewport which apparently was release many revision back (M56 in 2016) my Android Chrome version is 65.xxxx\nI don't know what to do next.\nI was able to integrate with 3.1.0 just yesterday after being stuck on 1.8.12 for too long.\nThe issue with setting the height being ignored remains.\nThanks for a great player.\n. I have made some edits to the plunker above since the original post (oops) and the behavior is better.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/RtwseYFzBl77IVK3qtTv?p=preview\nI now call plyr.setup() upon the plyrView.ts onPageLoaded() \nAlso I have introduced a boolean \"attached\" in PlyrService.ts in order to avoid registering plyr events multiple times (without having to use jQuery there is no elegant way in JS to do this apparently).\nGood/Bad news: The plyr is now loading OK every time we navigated to the page it is hosted in PlyrView.html, however the video is not playing upon event \"ready\" firing.  It think there is something going in the plunker like a race condition because it is basically identical to my development code which does not exhibit this last issue.\nIf a JS guru/native out there would like to help me, please look at PlyrView.ts and PlyrService.ts\nThank you.. I have forked the original plunker into http://plnkr.co/edit/2vChA10IchkL53DWDV0v?p=preview  for v2.0.11\nBasically, I adjusted \n\n\nindex.html to reference v2.0.11\n\n\nPlyrService.ts  to pick the 1st player from the returned array of players and using Player.on() to register the desired events once.\n\n\n```\nSetup() {\n    console.log(\"PlyrService.Setup...\");\n    // register all plyr events only once (without jQuery, a boolean is one way)\n    if (!attached) {\n      // -- Notify me when this plyr player is setup, so I can wire the needed plyr events\n      document.addEventListener('setup', () => {\n        console.log(\"video SETUP\");\n        PlayerElement = document.querySelectorAll('#js-plyr')[0];\n        // this.Player = plyr.setup()[0].plyr;\n        // -- wire needed events\n        this.WireDesiredEvents();\n      });\n    }\n    attached = true;\n    // plyr API expect us to call .setup() on the player HTML element\n    // plyr.setup(PlayerElement)[0];  // NOTE: on a single instance, .plyr returns false ???\n// this.Player = plyr.setup()[0].plyr; // v1.8.12\nthis.Player = plyr.setup('#js-plyr')[0]; // v2.0.11 (pick 1st and only player)\nPlayer_GlobalInstance = this.Player;\n\n}\n```\nDoes the above Setup() flow make sense ? :)\nI am not seeing the 'match' exception in this plunker unlike from vscode IDE, however it seems plyr.setup fails and returns \"undefined\",  I don't see it return an indication of this on the console, it would be nice if did.\nI think even though the edits above to move from v1.8.12 to v2.0.11 are not much the element hosting plyr is perhaps ?now? not getting loaded in time for plyr.setup.\nI will keep hacking, no other choice :(. I am moving away from the idea of navigating to a page containing the plyr player because, navigating out of the page destroys the page and thus plyr (at least that's my current understanding, unless you can keep a plyr HTML element in the ether and moving into another page at a later point).\nHosting all my players (plyr and custom) inside a single ionic tab and managing their exclusive visibility is my next approach to keep them all around.  If you think there is a better way, let me know\nI will be closing this for now.\nA note to the awesome author(s) of plyr, Hi Sam!, I wish you could maintain a simplified sample of plyr which demonstrate via \"simple JS code\" some of the major functionality and code patterns you would like to follow.\nI find the main sample you point to  https://plyr.io way too complex to wrap my head around it.\nI was thinking something (ugly) like this:\nhttps://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html \nI did use this to verify that volume is now expressed from 0 to 1 both in reading and setting it (the doc for your setVolume I think is behind and confused me saying 0 to 10).   Also I am not sure if the \"HTML5 video events\" are the exact same thing as your plyr?\nA plyr TESTER one page app, could perform the following behind dedicated buttons:\n1) setup of plyr\n2) destruction of plyr (I personally don't plan on this rather I need to load the next media explicitly when the previous one ends, this allows me to control the sequencing, perhaps in between media prompts,  implement end-of-playlist in order to jump to a different one, ...)\n3) how to properly register events  once (setup, ready, play, ended, ...)  are they guarantied to happen?\n4) what does the \"event\" argument provide for each of the events, (where to look up this information)\nCan event arg provide access to volume property or I have to use GetVolume? (which I am now).\n5) how to un-register events \nthe following would be extra\n6) provide various media list of (short) test media eg. A) YouTube only, B) Vimeo ony, C) audio?, D) a mix\n7) Let's stop here\nYou can use for-each but keep the instances of plyr to one for simplicity.\nSuch a sample of active code page would assist you as well as us developer, \n1) verify and confirm the behavior of plyr with each revision.\n2) gain understanding of the sequence of events\nI do keep a rudimentary sample as I am a poor JS coder :(, (too late to fix), ideally I would want the console output to be integrated but the browser console is fine to see the events, property values, etc... log.\nLet me know if you would like me to email it to you, it will certainly provide a good chuckle :)\nThank you.. Hello, regarding the \"cannot read property match\", here is some output from the console.\nI tried latest 2.0.11 and I get the same thing.\nLet me know what else I could capture for you.  In the mean time, I too have to roll back to plyr \"1.8.12\"

My video is 640px wide and 480px high, but it's setting the iframe as 480px wide and 360px high.\n. No, that'd be the same aspect ratio, which would seem right, but somehow it is cropping things off. Especially top and bottom.\n. Still testing browsers, but here's a workaround (using jQuery b/c reasons). Note the custom .video-play-container element, which is active in CSS and JS.\nHTML/CSS\nhtml\n<div class=\"video-play-container\" style=\"max-width: 640px; max-height: 480px;\">\n    <div data-type=\"vimeo\" data-video-id=\"XXXXXXXX\"></div>\n</div>\ncss\n.video-play-container {\n    display: block;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\nJS\n``` javascript\nvar vids = plyr.setup();\n\n$(document).ready(function(){\n\n    $(\".plyr__video-embed\").each(function(){\n\n        var $t = $(this),\n            $cont = $t.closest(\".video-play-container\"),\n            h = parseInt( $cont.css(\"max-height\") ),\n            w = parseInt( $cont.css(\"max-width\") ),\n            ratio = h / w,\n            percent = ratio * 100,\n            origH = $t.innerHeight(),\n            origW = $t.innerWidth(),\n            oldRatio = origH / origW,\n            oldPercent = oldRatio * 100,\n            diff = ( percent - oldPercent ) / 2;\n\n        $t\n            .css(\"padding-bottom\", function(){\n                return ( percent - diff ) + \"%\";\n            })\n            .css(\"padding-top\", function(){\n                return diff + \"%\";\n            });\n\n    });\n\n});\n\n```\nObviously this is better if it's baked in, in whichever way makes sense.\n. Note that the above fix still leaves videos cropped to the original ratio when full-screened.\n. Should say: I didn't really expect IE9 to work, at least like the others. The docs say it'll use the native player, but I'm not sure what that'd mean in this case.\n. Oh, and I tried using 1.8.12, but it was still there.\n.

I haven't found a way to do that with plyr. The \"ratio\" option seems to be ignored.. The red-dashed container has fixed size of 320x180px for this test.\nVideo size is 202x360px.\nFirst image shows how browser renders html5 video tag without initialising plyr.

I'm binding plyr.setup into the click event for the video thumbnails, and passing the video id via data attributes. Then when the video is finished playing - a custom overlay is added on top of the video. What would be ideal is that when the modal is closed, the plyr object is destroyed.  This only works if the destroy() is called within the same function as the setup(). It would be more natural if the variable \"player\" was accessible globally.\nShould I try setting the variable outside of my document.ready function? This is a simple version of what it looks like:\n``` javascript\njQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n$('.episode .video-link').bind('click', function(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n    var vid = $(this).data('vid');\n    var vlink = $(this).data('link');\n\n    $('.modal.video').addClass('visible').find('.player-container .vimeo-player').attr(\"data-video-id\", vid);\n    $('.modal.video').find('.btn-primary').attr(\"href\", vlink);\n\n    var playermodal = plyr.setup('.modal.video')[0];\n\n    playermodal.on('ready playing pause ended', function(event) { \n        switch(event.type) {\n            case 'ready':\n                break;\n            case 'playing':\n                console.log(playermodal.getDuration());\n                break;\n            case 'pause':\n\n                break;\n            case 'ended':\n\n                $('.modal.video .next-episode').fadeIn();\n\n                break;\n        }\n    });\n\n    $('.close, .overlay').bind('click', function(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        $('.modal').find('.player-container .vimeo-player').attr(\"data-video-id\", \"\");\n        $('.modal').find('.btn-primary').attr(\"href\", \"\");\n        $('.modal.video .next-episode').hide();\n        playermodal.destroy();\n        console.log(\"DESTROYED!\");\n    });\n\n});\n\n});\n```\nThis is working. However, if the click function on the close/overlay is OUTSIDE of the episode/video-link click function, it returns a \"Playermodal is undefined\" error.\n. The undefined variable occurs either way. Maybe I'm not understanding how variables are declared, but it should be available to be accessed regardless of whether it's called within a function. \nI did attempt to declare the variable outside of the function, with no success. When the destroy() is called it returns an \"undefined variable\". No matter where playermodal is declared. \n. ",

I think the only solution is to simply create all thumbnails during the upload process of the video, combine them within a sprite and then use this sprite for displaying the thumbnails.\n. Nice work, take note though that skippable ads are provided by doubleclick for example. Simply set the ads to be served as overlay ads.

I noticed a few user experience problems, which i have a hard time to fix as i am not that familiar with Plyr itself or I am not sure what the correct way to solve it when taking the Plyr code style in consideration. \nProblems: \n1. The video doesn't play, when the advertisement is done playing, but the video is not ready yet. Sort of makes sense, but this flow sort of breaks the user experience i would say.\n2. The video starts, but the advertisement is not yet ready; you would get like 1-2 seconds of video and then suddenly an advertisement. Also a user experience issue.. I did some removals or \"big\" changes. I tried to keep them within separate commits, so its easier to see. Hope you like the changes.. Added mid-roll cue markings within the progress bar: http://prntscr.com/i1pvks  similar to the youtube video player. Hope you like it.

Here is one:\ntagUrl: 'https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480' +\n            '&iu=/124319096/external/ad_rule_samples&ciu_szs=300x250&ad_rul' +\n            'e=1&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vmap&unviewed_position_sta' +\n            'rt=1&cust_params=deployment%3Ddevsite%26sample_ar%3Dpremidpost' +\n            '&cmsid=496&vid=short_onecue&correlator=',\n. Hope the re-formatting is what you expect it to be. I'm having trouble setting up the correct linting within phpstorm. Within my own projects I use google formatting, as its default within my IDE (lazy :P). It doesn't have an airbnb config unfortunately so I had to set some settings manually.\nI usually have eslint as part of my Grunt build tasks, so when i make a mistake it simply won't build the project. I assumed this was the case with Plyr as well, as when i do a pull request there is a task (checkbox) within the description text-area to successfully run the \"build\". My train of thought was: successful build === good formatting :P. following polyfills could fix the fetch and promise problems:\nnpm install whatwg-fetch --save-dev\nnpm install es6-promise --save-dev\n. I fixed this problem by changing the following in ui.js on line 87:\n// Ready event at end of execution stack\nutils.dispatchEvent.call(this, this.media, 'ready');\nWith the following:\n// Ready event at end of execution stack\n// Set a small delay or out on ready event attached to the plyr instance is not triggered\nsetTimeout(() => {\n      utils.dispatchEvent.call(this, this.media, 'ready');\n}, 50);\nSo basically listening for the ready right after creating the plyr instance will fail, as the ready event can fire sooner, so definitely a disconnect as you were saying. Not sure how to make a more a more elegant solution to fit with the plyr codebase.. Thanks. As a quick solution I simply did this:\nhideControls: (!/Android/.test(navigator.userAgent))\nThat way I can take advantage of pausing and showing controls on android devices when tapping on the video. And \"fallback\" to the \"hover\"-like behaviour for ios and desktop. I know agent sniffing sucks, but its just to give a quick user experience improvement. Nothing critical.\nBest solution imo would be to always be able to pause/ resume video by clicking on the video itself,  while also showing/hiding controls. Along with the hover behaviour for mouse controlled devices.. Michel ouwe baas! :D <- Arthur. . From what i remember only native clicks on Youtube play buttons would register a \"view\". Probably due to revenue allocation based on view count and the possibilities to just abuse the view count with your own solutions. \nI miss the sudden guitar jams and fuss-ball sessions! :D Anyway gl.. Based on this document we could already assume that they would not allow it due to possible abuse:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2991785?hl=en\nThen there is this old post:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/13456288/does-youtube-api-play-function-trigger-a-view-count/13459944#13459944\nAlso in the API documentation:\nhttp://prntscr.com/me677f - \"Note: A playback only counts toward a video's official view count if it is initiated via a native play button in the player.\" - https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference\nIt has been a while since that post of course, but i can't find anything about Youtube enabling it. I even assume they have some captcha solution on their own play button :D If not, then i am going to quit my job and setup a bot to spam click Pewdiepie his youtube videos and ask money for it. . Yeah no problem. I just figured it would be confusing if someone were to call: player.ads.resume(); instead of player.ads.contentResume(); as you don't resume the ad, but the actual video.. Done. I think i understand what you mean. Hope my recent change has resolved this.. Done. Removed this.currentAd. Noticed it was not being used. That ok>?. You sure you want to remove this? Without hiding the container initially you won't have access to the player controls as the container will lay on top of the video element.. From what i know and see is that when you hide an element using display: none, then the offsetWidth and offsetHeight of an element is 0. So when the ad container is hidden and you resize the video itself (for example you resize the browser or portrait to landscape or whatever), then the ad container is 0. Now this is fine, as you can set the width when displaying the ad. The problem though is that we send the ad container dimensions to the ads load instance of the IMA SDK. What happens is that the IMA SDK refuses to display the advertisement as the dimensions of the to be loaded creative won't align with the available space in the ad container. \nAll in all it would cause a lot of missed impressions depending on the context of the plyr video.\nAnyway, using z-index for displaying the ad container will allow the correct dimensions to be set for the container itself and the adsloader instance.. Something like this?\n// Return the promise (for HTML5)\n        if (this.ads.enabled && !this.ads.initialized && !this.ads.blocked) {\n            this.ads.managerPromise.then(() => {\n                this.ads.play();\n            }).catch(() => {\n                return this.media.play();\n            });\n        } else {\n            return this.media.play();\n        }\nWould be a bit ugly though as you won't have a consistent return value for this method. Suppose the ads.play method should also return a promise then?. np. Only setting visibility or opacity without zindex wont, as then the ad container would stay on top of the video. Using z-index to show and hide the container will allow css transition animation with opacity and what not, but i would advise to not do that, as some advertisers don't like it when a second gets cut off their video ad due to a \"cool\" transition :P. While working on a quick fix concerning your remark I also found out that the ad blocking detection would get the player stuck when player.play() is called right after creating the player instance itself. Simply because the ad blocking value is set async. So now i removed the return from the constructor. Also moved all the instance properties into the constructor. And made sure the adsManager promise - within the actual play() - method always resolves or rejects, even when there is an adblocker enabled.. Done, although i dont see the pull request updated yet at the time of writing this comment.. Ah could you check again? This is what you mean right? Makes sense, cause i already got an alert from my IDE that the play() method was not consistently returning a value.. ",

    "joshuapease": "Howdy! Just coming by to confirm that I'm hitting the same issue too whenever I dynamically create & destroy youtube videos. Trying to integrate Plyr with a custom modal I'm building for a site. \nThe video is dynamically created when a modal is opened and then destroyed when it is closed. \nI've put together a reduced test of the issue. This is roughly how I'm going about creating & destroying. I've tested with Vimeo videos and this isn't an issue.\nhttp://codepen.io/joshuapease/pen/qaYdLR\nNotice the console error after you've toggled the video twice. Seems to be coming from youtube's JS. \n\nPS. This is \"by far\" the best JS video player I've used, so great. \n. Hey @SamPotts & @MHenley! I think I may have figured out what my issue was. \nI was calling plyr.setup() before I'd actually appended the DOM element to the body. So while the element did exist, it wasn't part of the actual document tree. \nMust be that Youtube and/or Plyr don't like that. I did notice that Plyr controls weren't showing up on the old demo. \nHere's a new codepen that seems to show everything working. Simply involved swapping the order of a single line of code. \nhttp://codepen.io/joshuapease/pen/LRALqQ\n. Yeah! Seems to be working well for me.\nAlthough I'm curious if the route I took is a good way to dynamically\ncreate Plyr instances. Is there a better way to do that programmatically?\nOn Sat, Oct 22, 2016 at 6:35 PM, Sam Potts notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHey @joshuapease https://github.com/joshuapease,\nThanks for reporting back.

For example an english translation and an english translation with sound effects for deaf people? \nOr what if people do not pay attention to the srclang attribute?\n. I've looked this up and I still think that using the index is the best way to do it internally.\nBut you are right that the setCaptionIndex may not be clear enough for everybody.\nHow about adding a \"getCaptionTracks\" that would help the users choose the right track?\nThe output could be something like this :\n[\n    {\n        track   : <Element>\n        index   : 0,\n        kind    : 'captions',\n        src     : '...',\n        lang    : \"en\",\n        label   : \"English\"\n    }\n]\nAlso, how about adding an event for caption selection/change?\n.

Still getting used with github, sry :/\n. This is a helpful feature.\nAny plans on adding it to develop?. Great work! I integrated this in one of our sites and seems to work fine.. This new version does not seem to work on Internet Explorer without the polyfills.\nMaybe this should be added to the documentation?. @sampotts Yeah, makes sense, but I use your lib on computers that don't have access to the internet. Would it make sense to add a \"build with polyfills\" option to your build process?\n. After @sampotts post regarding polyfills, I did some tests of my own. \nI saw a 75% overhead when using babel-polyfill, obviously, this is not usable in production. (think about the idea of all libs/frameworks including polyfills ... scary)\nFor now, we will keep v2 for our \"offline\" sites and use v3 + polyfill.io on our online sites.\nThat said, I would add an build option for v3+polyfills for those special cases. I could create a PR if needed.\n. I have a similar scaling issue with Vimeo and Youtube videos (HTML5 is okay) when on my 21:9 screen:\n\n. We have the same issue.\n@ShaunLWM 's solution works in IE11/Firefox and Chrome, but does not in Safari Mac and on iOS it makes the player not work at all. Not usable for us at the moment.\n. I've done some debugging, and it seems that the issue is that the media is played before it's ready:\n\nIf I add the following to the onReady method of youtube.js, it seems to solve the issue:\nif(player.config.autoplay === true ) {\n    player.media.play();\n}\n. Just had a look at the seeking code in youtube.js\nAt line L231 you define paused as true. So, in L393 you will always pause the video.\nEven in the case where autoplay was added to the youtube iframe, you will still pause.\nWe could change L231 to something like:\nplayer.media.paused = !player.config.autoplay;. Just tested it on chrome and it works.\nWill do more testing on multiple browsers and create a PR for you.\n. With your solution, the poster flickers when autoplay is enabled: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTW1Ntb6cCY\nIf paused is set accordingly to the autoplay configuration, there's no flicker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTiPxhzxX6E\nI understand why you want to have a \"clean\" state at the start, but if it's not the expected state, I would maybe rethink that idea.\n. I understand. \nIMO, adding CSS classes for that case does not sound clean.\nAnyway, both solutions are \"okay\" with me, at least the autoplay works. Let's wait for @sampotts feedback and I'll create a PR if needed. \n. @tttmack123 Was waiting for feedback from @sampotts, so I did not.\nI could make one with my first solution if you are interested in testing.. I have the two solutions in my fork.\nThe solution @friday suggested (see issue above): https://github.com/dacostafilipe/plyr/tree/fix-yt-autoplay\nMy solution that changes the starting state: https://github.com/dacostafilipe/plyr/tree/fix-yt-autoplay-v2\nIf you can confirm that the \"v2\" works, I would open a PR.\n. If I add \nsass\n&.plyr--youtube .plyr__video-wrapper{\n        padding-bottom: 0 !important;\n    }\nto the plyr-fullscreen-active mixin, it solves the issue for youtube. \n\n.

I'm on iOS 10 using Youtube. Full Screen doesn't work with any custom player, I know that for a fact as so far Plyr is the only one that works full screen because it uses the YT player on iOS. But the watermark is covering the buttons to control the volume & full screen. And I'm having the same issue as the thread starter, the controls keep disappearing and when you click it pauses the video.\nI should add this is only on iPad. iPhone automatically goes into full screen when play is clicked...\n. Works perfect now, thank you so much.... \nI was able to add the logo perfectly. I like the customization-ability of the player.\n. @lepusmorris Custom CSS. The custom CSS has to be on the controls though and then move it into position. Anywhere else and the logo hides behind the player, likely due to z-index.. I have not seen this issue on iOS 11 yet myself. It works fine using Youtube & Vimeo, only issue I've seen is on iPad it won't go full screen, only fill up size of browser or app being used in. I've been using iOS 11 since Beta 1. [div class=\"plyr__video-embed\" id=\"player\"]\n[iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sx2ssZLpAk\"][/iframe]\n[/div]\nI replaced the < with [ for the code on here because it wouldn't show properly... Nothing appears at all when I use that code.I ended up redoing all our pages with the non-iframe method which works but I opened another ticket for the Vi ads because that code makes everything disappear also.... It's the vi ads code. I removed the code from script part and it fixed the issue instantly. So something Apple did in iOS 11.4 and iOS 12 is causing the vi ads code to crash Plyr from loading in WebView.. This is the code I'm using. I have never used Codepen so I just thought I'd post the code here, The Fullscreen button just doesn't work on iOS 12 with the iosNative on true. If you turn off the iosNative it works but again it's the first problem of the video not going into fullscreen fully and being able to scroll around it.\nAfter Head <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.plyr.io/3.4.3/plyr.css\">\nBefore Body <script src=\"https://cdn.plyr.io/3.4.3/plyr.js\"></script>\n<script>const player = new Plyr('#player', {\ncontrols:[\"play-large\",\"play\",\"progress\",\"current-time\",\"mute\",\"volume\",\"captions\",\"settings\",\"fullscreen\",\"pip\",\"airplay\"],tooltips:{controls:!0},fullscreen{iosNative:true},quailty:{ default: 'default', options: ['hd2160', 'hd1440', 'hd1080', 'hd720', 'large', 'medium', 'small', 'tiny', 'default'] }\n});</script>\nEmbed <div id=\"player\" data-plyr-provider=\"youtube\" data-plyr-embed-id=\"bTqVqk7FSmY\"></div>. https://www.sparkktv.com/bts-on-the-road/episodes/s2-e16-snee-farm-cc-2\nJust use that link on iOS. On both iPad Pro & iPhone Xs Max, the fullscreen button doesn't work at all. I have iosNative turned to true for right now, as soon as you check the link I'll turn it back off so my users can atleast have semi-fullscreen until I can fix this issue.\nAlso I'm using the old style embed code still. <div id=\"player\" data-plyr-provider=\"youtube\" data-plyr-embed-id=\"bTqVqk7FSmY\"></div>\nAlso could it be a Youtube issue?. https://codepen.io/sparkktv/pen/YJzqRr/\nI can't figure it out though on how to get it to run. I've never used Codeine before. But It put everything in there but it won't run at all, if someone can fix it... It's the JS I can't figure out, I put it exactly how I have it on my site. But I guess Codepen doesn't work that way.. https://codepen.io/sparkktv/pen/YJzqRr/\nStill does not work on iOS. Fullscreen button does nothing, so it's not my website because it happens on Codepen also.\nAnd thank you budevor for that, I totally missed that : . It's also showing open tabs in the browser such as Safari, on your demo page when you go to full screen. Hopefully these issues can be fixed soon. \nIf it helps any, I noticed Afterglow Player when using Youtube, they fixed some of the issues by going to the native iOS player when hitting the fullscreen button. . I noticed it no longer shows the Youtube branding with this new issue also, but it may not be an issue because I'm noticing other sites that have Youtube embedded players from Youtube have that new look and the title is interactive to the channel. You can click on it and go straight to the channel the video is from, like a shortcut. As you can see here https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube_player_demo\nThey have taken the option to hide the titles away from the options.. From their Iframe Player API Page...\nAugust 23, 2018\nNote: This is a deprecation announcement for the showinfo parameter. In addition, the behavior for the rel parameter is changing. Titles, channel information, and related videos are an important part of YouTube\u2019s core user experience, and these changes help to make the YouTube viewing experience consistent across different platforms.\nThe behavior for the rel parameter is changing on or after September 25, 2018. The effect of the change is that you will not be able to disable related videos. However, you will have the option of specifying that the related videos shown in the player should be from the same channel as the video that was just played.\nTo be more specific:\nPrior to the change, if the parameter's value is set to 0, then the player does not show related videos.\nAfter the change, if the rel parameter is set to 0, the player will show related videos that are from the same channel as the video that was just played.\nThe showinfo parameter, which indicates whether the player should display information like the video title and uploader before the video starts playing, is also being deprecated. Following the change, the channel avatar and video title will always display before playback begins, when playback is paused, and when playback ends. The avatar being displayed is new behavior that will be consistent across all embedded players.\nThese changes will become effective on or after September 25, 2018. After that time, the showinfo parameter will be ignored. The behavior following the changes is consistent with the current default behavior for embedded players with the exception of the channel avatar changes mentioned above.. In my tests, no Youtube videos using Plyr or any embedded player have counted towards my views on Youtube. Youtube claims embedded videos will counts towards views but I have never seen it or had success.. ",

The mute attribute isn't respected for me on native <video> tags too.. @sampotts This is what I meant, and it doesn't work for me.. Thanks @sampotts. And what would be the intermediate solution?. Thanks @sampotts, I'll read the player.js docs of Vimeo to get started. However, I'd love to have plyr options for default HTML5 options, as I'm not sure how to define them that they also work for Vimeo (see #632).. Does playsinline affect the player UI? From my point of view this currently only controls autoplay and whether or not iOS goes in fullscreen when initially viewing a video. . I'm very confused currently. I can't find answers to my questions in the docs:\n\nWhere will the custom player UI be visible and where not?\nHow to autoplay videos in all browsers with all supported formats \u2013 HTML5, Youtube and Vimeo?\nHow to set default HTML5 options to other formats \u2013 Youtube and Vimeo \u2013 too (#632)? Answer for now: Manually use the API for each format. There's no API for all options targeting all formats.\n\nWhat I need is a custom player UI for all recent browsers and devices, with autoplay support, especially with Vimeo support, as it's the only way to have a video cdn without branding (e.g. Youtube logo).\nSo, what's the current status for autoplaying and custom player UI?\nI've just added playsinline to a HTML5 video, but this still shows the native iOS player UI.. > That's when the custom UI will be supported on iOS.\nBut I've just tested it by manually adding playinline to a <video> and this didn't cause the plyr UI to appear.\nHowever, how should playsinline solve the autoplay mechanism for Vimeo and Youtube, where it's just an iframe? And why does playsinline affect the UI of Vimeo videos, where it's embedded within an iframe too. Sorry for asking this, but it's really not clear for me.\n\nI'm working on getting V3 out as quick as I can but I've had a son since starting on it and time is scarce. It's getting closer though.\n\nNo problem, I'd just like to clear my confusion.. It seems that I have the same issue.\nIn a React app inside componentDidMount I'm initializing Plyr successfully. However, upon page change I need to destroy it. Therefore I'm calling .destroy() in componentWillUnmount. Even though I'm getting an error after destroy was called by React:\n\nSeems like Plyr is still executing something after I have called destroy. I'm using a normal HTML5 video, no Vimeo/YouTube. In the source could I could figure out that there's an option to pass a callback, this doesn't seem to be documented. So I'm assuming that something async is going on? That's a problem for me since I can not have any async code in componentWillUnmount. It just has to be synchronously that React can remove elements without problems.\n. @friday @FlipgridMartin Maybe it's also related to all of them, I don't know. However, do you know a workaround for integrating Plyr into a Next.js/react app with client-side routing? Currently for example when Plyr is initialized and Next.js does hot reloading then I'm getting an error by React that he can't remove elements.. @friday ??? Seriously. \n\nHow is that related to this issue?\n\nLook at the second sentence in this ticket:\n\nUsing Plyr.js destroy method in Vue.js component lifecycle hooks should destroy Plyr instance before component is destroyed.\n\nReplace \"Vue.js\" with \"React\" and there you go. That's my problem.\n\nThis is not a place for support anyway.\n\nThis is not support. This is a bug report. Player .destroy() doesn't seem to be synchronously, that's why I think we're experiencing issues whenever client-side routing (and therefore replacement of existing elements) is the case. We're destroying Plyr and afterwards the framework (Vue.js/React) replaces old children with new children. But since Plyr still seems to depend on them, some error happens.\n. @friday \n\nYou've been told three time now that you're being off topic:\n\nActually, as my comment above shows, this is not off topic. Rather I think it is directly related. And even if I don't think it would have been necessary, I've already created follow-up issue #1010.\n\nyou're now being rude.\n\nI'm annoyed, that's all. Instead of helping or answering with helpful information or trying to understand the issue or the relationship to the original issue, you're saying me that it's off topic, even if it isn't.\n\nFor other than background context, it doesn't matter for Plyr which type of frameworks and libraries you are using, unless the issue is happening specifically with one of those frameworks or libraries, and can't be reproduced without it. \n\nWhich is the case.\n\nWe already know why this issue is happening, and it was there to read before your first comment.\n\nNot in the context of Next.js/React, and I wanted to make sure that a fix also applies for these.\n\nPlease don't comment on this issue again. It's disrespectful to the author and subscribers who are here because they are interested in the issue.\n\nI'm here to get a solution for this bug. If you're not interested in offering solutions / fixing bugs or getting feedback from users, then close the issue functionality (you can do so by going into the repository settings => Options => Uncheck \"Issues\") or let others reply to issues.

Also I saw that there is currently no way to extend the api before \"setup\" is fired.\nKeep in mind this is a work in progress and I really would like to hear what you think about the current setup. And what you think is the best way to move forward with the plugin.. Thanks for getting back to me.\nWell the ad is actually skippable. By default it is set to show the ad skip button at 10 seconds.

I will rich the start of the stream ( 1 hour in the past) in the middle of Plyr's seekbar, NOT on the start (left side) of Plyr's seekbar. If I seek to the fist half of plyr's seekbar, than it jumps to the live position.\nOf course if I watch only 6 mins in a 1 hour long playlist, then I will reach the actual start of playlist at 10% of plyr's seekbar\nThis is reproducable in the Hls.js only version too. But I think that Hls.js behaves like this by design. I think that the player ( in our case Plyr ) should render seekbar correctly.\nAm I right?\nThx!. Now I started testing Clappr, which uses Hls.js too and it does not have this problem.\nThe \"in action\" url changed from http://madarles.hu to http://infocam.hu/players/madarles-last-pryl.php. ",

I believe there's a lot of opportunities if the player could change the settings by breakpoint.\nFor example you could autoplay the video on desktop, hide some buttons on tablet, and have different settings for mobile.. Maybe it's related to adding the rotation directly to the inline svg element. I'll try to test in a codepen.. When this style is commented out the rotation works fine. With this style the rotation acts funny, as on the screencast gif.\n```\n.plyr--video .plyr__controls .plyr__control svg {\n    -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .15));\n    filter: drop-shadow(0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .15));\n}. I made a codepen: https://codepen.io/artifex404/pen/xWpWQN?editors=1100\nAnd it acts similarly with the drop-shadow enabled:\n\n. Yep. In Firefox 59.0.2 (64-bit), the rotation is fine, but the whole Plyr video player gets black for a fraction of second. In Safari 11.0.3 all works without issue.. Strange it is! Seems the bug is on El Capitan on latest Chrome, same Chrome version on High Sierra and Sierra works fine. If you have access to browserstack.com I got it reproduced there on latest Chrome on El Capitan.. Disabled all extensions and tested in incognito - same thing. I got it reproduced also on browserstack virtual machine, so it's not only on my machine. If it's only on El Capitan with specific chrome versions that might be not a big issue.. This Chrome bug might be related. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=701075 I guess applying transformation directly on SVG causes it. If the button SVG icon could be wrapped in a \"div\" and the transformations applied to that wrapper, it could fix that issue.. Yep, sorry, that was an old issue. There's still a lot of SVG issues opened with Chromium...\nWrapping the SVG and applying the transformation to it fixes the issue for me. Here's a codepen of working rotation: https://codepen.io/artifex404/pen/KoQpKj?editors=1100\nBut of course you'll need to reproduce the bug itself on your machine.

In case when I try to open video which was deleted, I see the different behavior for youtube and vimeo:\nyoutube: player.on('error', ...) is fired\nvimeo: player.on('error', ...) is NOT fired, but exception in promise is thrown\nExpected behavior: \nFired error event with the same error code for youtube and vimeo, if video is unavailable. No error exception is thrown\nBrowser and OS:\nChrome 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit), macOS SIerra 10.12.6 (16G29). Hi @sampotts! The reason why I requested this PR is to enable working with speed through native youtube/vimeo api, which I already use in production. As a temporary solution, I'm placing non-transparent plyr control over vimeo's one. And only in case of non-fullscreen, because in fullscreen the is no such problem for now.\nAlso, had to add defaultDelay to my fork of plyr to show plyr controls longer than vimeo's one.\n\n. Sounds great! Thank you @sampotts!\nOne question, how are you grabbing original video dimensions for vimeo?. cool, thank you!. It could be. But there is no such error when I turn Plyr off and use only player.js, as I mentioned above.. @sampotts Can you please do a hotfix?\nFile: \nsrc/js/plugins/vimeo.js\nChange this:\nplayer.embed.getVideoUrl().then(value => {\n            currentSrc = value;\n        });\nTo this:\nplayer.embed.getVideoUrl()\n    .then(value => {\n        currentSrc = value;\n    })\n    .catch(() => {\n        // Do nothing\n    });\nExplanation:\nOn a private video vimeo throws an error on calling getVideoUrl. And even with this catch, you will be still able to catch an error using .on('error'..., so it is quite safe. Thanks! I appreciate your fast responses! :). As a source of inspiration, here is some my old code I used in our project to add speed changing to Plyr v2.

I'm willing to spend some time digging into it and put up a PR.. It seems the main issue is that there isn't any null checking when accessing things like this.player and this.elements in the ui.js part of the app. This seems to be aggravated by the fact that the .destroy() method isn't clearing all event listeners properly. I'm seeing these errors even after the destroyed callback is called.. Any updates on this one? . Would definitely contribute as well. Thank you so much Sam. THANK YOU. ",

Can I use loadSprite: false to completely disable plyr's sprite loading functionality? So it does not load crossdomain sprites?. Actually, I can't recall what my intention was on this issue. Either I totally missed loadSprite in the first place or I actually wanted to propose the removal of the sprite-loading code (in favor of polyfills) in general, to reduce file size and basically shift sprite-loading responsibility from plyr to actual SVG loading polyfills, which are meant to do that job..

Ok, understood. \nI see v3.2.4 fixes a bug with older iOS/Safari not working at all (a bug I also think affected the google indexing renderer). Very good!\n. Whoops... I did search, but I missed it since I found a \u2713 after IE11 support, with no footnote, and therefore wrongly concluded I had searched properly before posting.\nI see the polyfill section mentions the demo\n\nThe easiest method I've found is to use polyfill.io which provides polyfills based on user agent. This is the method the demo uses.\n\nThe demo is actually not working properly on IE11. The video cannot be paused, and the \"play\" symbol in the middle of the video doesn't go away after starting the video. I don't have a play symbol on the video, but play and pause works fine for me.\n. I originally posted this under the wrong issue. I deleted it, but post it here instead, since it seems more related to this.\nI have the same (or very similar) problem testing on an iOS 9.3.5 iPad and latest (v3.3.7) Plyr, using Safari.\nMore specific, I get \"Unhandled promise rejection - Error: The viewer must initiate playback first.\"\nThe error message seems to come from Vimeo itself, and seems to be an issue with iOS. From what I can gather on the net, iOS doesn't allow a video being started through an API before the user has actively activated it.\nMy guess is that Plyr catches the touch event before it gets to iOS, preventing it from activating the player, and thus preventing the video from being started through the API.\nPlyr also disables (hides) most of the controls, only leaving the progress bar. One solution might be to disable controls altogether, and fall back to native controls, as it does for older (at least on one of our test devices) iPhones.\nI have not found where this disabling of the controls, partly or fully, happens in the Plyr code.

And the good news is Plyr can get rid of that Vimeo hack to hide controls now, since it's no longer of any use.. I'm afraid it's something people have to do themselves. People can use an embed preset that turns controls off, and then assign it to every one of their videos, which does the trick (that's what I did for 100+ videos), but there's no way for Plyr to control anything.\nPerhaps the best option is to disable the custom controls by default (like you already do in iOS), but allow people to use them with a custom config option, so those of us who are OK with the settings workaround I described earlier can keep making use of the custom controls bar (which of course, would have to be documented).\nEither way, what a pain supporting Vimeo must be! Thank you so much for all the effort you put into Plyr.. Yes, they are, sadly, which is why I suggested it not be a default workaround. They're there for those of us who use Vimeo/Plyr for business.. @danaburger Wow, great find! @jonnitto's commit does seem to resolve the problem, but for some reason the play/pause indicators then stop working. Trying to figure out why.\nEdit: Also, when it first loads, the controls bar is still there, so it might be useful to hide the video's iframe until it has loaded properly (when using custom controls, to avoid the flash of Vimeo's control bar).. That issue can be resolved by customising Vimeo's own embed JS file to include the &transparent=0 when first creating the embed. It means that we'd have to maintain a fork of Vimeo's player JS, but it resolves the issue flawlessly \u2014 it goes back to exactly the way it was before.\nI'm sure someone might be able to come up with a better way to do it without customising Vimeo's player, but if not, this is the most straightforward. The change is a single line; it'd be easy to keep the fork updated until support for the \"transparent\" option was added to their oEmbed API. Combined with unpkg, it'd be easy to serve the custom player JS, and resolve the issue for everyone using Vimeo with Plyr.. ",

Vimeo did make some changes, but you can override that change by adding ?transparent=0 to the end of the player URL in the embed code.

Here is a StackOverflow on the subject.\nI have a centered div that uses 50% left and top with a -50% transform to center it on the screen. \nPlyr's fallback on iPad makes the plyr wrapper position: fixed.

The reason why I'm not on the V3 beta already was because when I used import plyr from 'plyr I received a message saying that plyr wasn't found, and when using it in a Vue component it told me that setup() was not a function.. Ah ok.\nWould you say that v3 is ready for a plugin yet?

If this isn't solved within the next couple of days I might have some time to work on it.. @dappiu  Yeah that probably sounds about right - webpack and not nuxt. When I get some time I can probably do some testing to see if this works better by settings the css variable --value to 0%.. I just installed nuxt (both v2.2.0 & v1.4.4) and I didn't get any errors. I used the latest version of vue-plyr (which automatically includes the latest version of plyr). Is there something I'm missing? I used the boilerplate project for nuxt v2 (with vue-plyr added) and just changed the version number of nuxt to use v1.4.4. I got zero errors, and everything worked fine.

Will further investigate tomorrow and come back here if I find what's causing it.. @sampotts yes i see the video on your homepage. \nThis is what I use to initialise the players:\njs\nvar player = new Plyr(this, { autoplay: false, controls: ['play', 'progress', 'mute', 'volume', 'fullscreen', 'settings'], settings: ['captions', 'quality'], fullscreen: { enabled: true, fallback: true, iosNative: true }, clickToPlay: true });\nAnd this is the html:\nhtml\n<div id=\"player-454\" class=\"video-player plyr__video-embed\">\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/222486164?loop=false&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byline=false&amp;portrait=false&amp;title=false&amp;speed=true&amp;transparent=0&amp;gesture=media\" allowfullscreen allowtransparency allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe>\n</div>\nLike I said before, youtube and video work fine.. @sampotts tested last night on Android Chrome and it's fine there, on iOS it doesn't work in Chrome either. It seems like there's definitely a bug there.. @sampotts I've done some debugging today and have found what the problem is.\nFor Vimeo, this condition on line 6653 truthy.includes(params.playsinline) is not met and as a result  this.config.inline = true; isn't set.\nThis in turn causes var playsInline = browser.isIPhone && inline && support.inline to be false and as a result ui = support.rangeInput && (!browser.isIPhone || playsInline) is undefined.\nAs a result the controls don't get added for Vimeo on iOS.. @sampotts yes, seems to be working, thanks!. @friday I'm not sure the two issues are related, as in this case the video does play and the pause icon is not displayed, so it's the exact opposite. I will try to have a look.. @friday further looking into this, it seems youtube doesn't actually autoplay the video. Furthermore, I had only tested in Chrome so far, in Safari neither Vimeo nor Youtube autoplay. So this seems related to the new autoplay policies, not sure if it can be \"fixed\", I might need to rethink my use of a custom placeholder image and have the player initialised from the get-to. . This might be related to #460.. @sampotts thanks for the update, much appreciated. I tried to do some debugging myself but couldn't get it to work. . ",

If that was not the case, then Plyr would always show the Plyr UI, even when playsinline was not set on <video> element, since iPads are excluded from isIPhone. In other words, it's all good.. If we want to support event.preventDefault() no matter what, we can patch the event object before passing it to customHandler (only if such handler is present). For example with the following code:\nObject.defineProperty(event, 'defaultPrevented', {\n    value: event.defaultPrevented,\n    writable: true\n});\nevent.preventDefault = () => {\n    event.defaultPrevented = true;\n};\n\nHowever, the better solution would be to have the custom handler return false to prevent the default handler from running.\n. I was able to get the fullscreen button working by passing listeners.fullscreen click handler that calls the Fullscreen API. But since the listener is added as passive, calling event.preventDefault() has no effect, and the error still occurs.. Wanted to follow up on this one.

Hi @friday , \non https://plyr.io/, I think it has something to do with YouTube/Vimeo Videos, because I can't change to them in IE11; it throws the same error, so I am assuming that it is the same problem, but I am not sure.\nI'm a little bit concerned about pull requests from my site, as I am unsure if my fix is really working for all the different browsers and scenarios, so I'm raiseing the issue here. But I can create the pull requests nevertheless, you are right :). Unfortunately no, because in IE11 you can't set the this.media.currentTime to the same time. It needs an if before that:\nif(this.media.currentTime.toFixed(4) !== targetTime.toFixed(4)) {. Me too, but as long as people have Win 8.1 they can't upgrade to edge. Bit of a bummer.. @friday you are right, It seem's to play now - I get another error in IE11, but the video plays. So I think this is fixed for now.. Couldn't fix the issue in the code. Needed to change the autoplay mechanism:\n```\n        var player = new Plyr(videoPlayer, {\n            autoplay: false\n        });\n    // Fix for autoplay\n    player.on('ready', event => {\n        if (videoModel[\"autoplay\"]) {\n            player.play();\n        }\n    });\n\n. Maybe this has something to do with this pull request: https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/pull/805/files.

Let's hope it's just a temporary issue on their site.\nThank you so much for your effort!!. @sampotts I don't think we will find a solution for this, as this is the intended behaviour from now on.

So maybe this has something to do with a special video setting/whitelisting for a specific url?. I will test this now in the embedded iFrame.. Mh, If I add the exact same URL in plyr, the related videos are still being shown. Weird.. A similar approach is (or was) in the vimeo implementation, and besides some control-css-issues this worked pretty fine. Nonetheless with this approach, we are violating the TOS from youtube, so a \"real\" solution would be better (Like before, setting this via parameters).\nI've used this approach before with vimeo, until I sticked to their TOS because of violation concerns..

It seems this is in place to allow setting a plyr property without messing with the original event, which the developer can later use to retrieve a reference to the Plyr player that the element is associated with.\nI'd propose that Plyr not create the synthetic event and instead let the constructor act as a getter (or create a getter method). YouTube's API behaves in this manner. Then the user could use the target of the Event to retrieve the Plyr reference. I'm certain I don't have all the facts, so if this doesn't make sense I will close this issue, but I'm happy to put together a PR if this is a good idea.. Alternatively, namespacing the event would also solve the issue in my mind - 'plyr:play' instead of 'play'. That, or those who are using the bubbling event could simply add an event listener to the audio or video element directly.\nI'm clearly short on details on a lot of the internals here, so apologies if these are truly awful suggestions; hard to know from the outside looking in \ud83d\ude04 . Yes, it would be a breaking change, which would mean a version bump, but those listeners could then fix themselves.\nMedia events don't bubble, but they do capture; Plyr events do both. That's how I'm catching two - the original event, which captures down, then the Plyr event, which captures and then bubbles.\n. Oh, also, there's an easy fix to check the event - Event.isTrusted will be false if the Event is not natively triggered.

    "joshcawthorne": "Just to clarify, I understand you need prior interaction to start it upon page load. Can I confirm that there's no way to continue playback with a second video after a user has initiated when starting the first video, and then navigated away to another tab whilst the video plays?. Ah, thanks for your response, however, I think I may have over-complicated my question. Essentially, I'm trying to build a music player that utilizes YouTube and a custom playlist system. At the moment I simply replace each instance of plyr on song end with a new one, and playback continues. However, if a user has tabbed out to another tab (as one does when listening to music!) the next track doesn't begin until a user returns to the tab. The track is buffered, so I know the code itself runs in the background, but it seems the Media Engagement algorithm introduced in Chrome 66 is stopping plyr from restarting itself in the background. \nI understand why this would be the case, and was simply wondering if there was a way to replace the current instance of plyr's src ID with an updated one and begin playing that video while the tab is still in the background if that makes sense? I don't believe this would be breaking any policy in Chrome, as the user has to initiate the playback on page load the first time, I just want it to continue automatically.\nThanks for the responses thus far..

    "Saiuke": "Sorry. HTML5 video. MP4 format. I used the template, just forgot to post some information.. In your page https://plyr.io everything runs okay. But as I said, using that video aspect I have no problem. But, as you can see in the prints I took, it only occurs when not using fullscreen.. If I resize the window properly I get the usual two black stripes...\n\n. ",
    "fleps": "Hi @sampotts , great to know that you are giving accessibility this importance.\nIn the meantime I will also ask to the Accessibility Consultant to do a second pass on the player to see if there's any other issue they didn't get, and update here if anything new is found.\nThanks!. Hi @sampotts \nI think what the team meant with \"a button to turn it off\" is to have a button that removes / stop updating the  element all together, maybe even deleting it from the DOM.\nI'm not sure the aria-hidden will completely overwrite the screen readers behavior, if I'm not mistaken I saw an issue with some screen readers for this specific element in the past.\nI'll check with the team for a confirmation.. Hi @sampotts \nSorry for the delay on this. I'm still waiting approval from the client to extend the accessibility consultant contract for this, as it appears is out of the original scope. Business, you know.\nIt will happen, I'm just not sure yet when, but I'll let you know as soon we have the analysis.. Hi @sampotts \nSorry for the delay but I took a different approach with the team review, and we actually asked them to evaluate the player on your demo page as it's the last version.\nThis turned out to be a more detailed issue report from accessibility stand point, but also more complex than I was expecting as he listed 10 issues on the current version of the player.\nDo you prefer that I update the initial post on this topic, add the issues on a new comment, or close this and open a new one?\nLet me know.. Hi @sampotts \nAs mentioned our consultant team did an extensive testing on the player and here are the issues found and the recommendations.\n1) Frames\nThe imasdk.googleapis.com iframe is used as a shim, or to capture events, or for data transport, but it is not ignored by screen readers. Screen reader users may be confused by information that should be hidden.\nRecommended Modification\nHide the iframe as follows:\nUse CSS display:none or visibility:hidden on the iframe element.\n--- OR ---\nAdd role=\"presentation\" and tabindex=\"-1\" to the iframe element. Use the attribute title=\"empty\" to indicate the iframe contains no user information.\n2) Buttons definitions\nThe Play/Pause, Mute/Unmute, Disable/Enable Captions, and Enter/Exit Full Screen buttons are defined as toggle buttons but they do not indicate the state correctly because the name of the buttons changes when activated.  Screen reader users will not understand the current state of the controls.\nRecommended Modification\nThe aria-pressed attribute should not be used on buttons where the button name changes to indicate the state. This causes incorrect information to be communicated to screen reader users.\nFor example, the Play button is announced as \"Play toggle button not pressed\" which is correct, but when the button is activated it is announced as \"Pause toggle button pressed\" which communicates that the video is paused, but it is not.\n\nEither remove the aria-pressed attributes from the buttons OR keep aria-pressed and do not change the name of the button to reflect its current state.\nAlso remove role=\"tooltip\" from the <span> elements used for the button names, this role is not appropriate for this content.\n\nNote:  The full screen button is not displayed in IE.\n3) Sliders\nThe Seek and Volume sliders are semantically defined but use multiple methods to label the control.  There is a label element with a for attribute and aria-labelledby referencing the label element.  This may complicate screen reader interaction with these controls.  In addition, the slider values are not properly communicated to screen readers.\nRecommended Modification\n- Remove the for attribute from the label elements and keep aria-labelledby attribute.\n- The seek slider value should be communicated as the time shown visually.  Currently aria-valuemax=\"100\" and the current time (aria-valuenow) is a percentage and not the actual time.\n    - Set aria-valuemax=\"183\" (total minutes) and use aria-valuetext to communicate the actual time (e.g. aria-valuetext=\"00:23 of 03:03\").\n    - The aria-valuetext attribute should be used when alphanumeric values should be indicated to screen reader users\n- The volume slider current value is not communicated properly. When the volume is at 100 the value is communicated as 1.\n    - Use aria-valuetext to communicate the volume percent (e.g. aria-valuetext=\"100%\").\nNote: In IE, the PageUp and PageDown keys do not work on the sliders as they do in Firefox and Chrome.  While this interaction is optional, it allows keyboard users the ability to move the slide in larger increments which increases the usability.\n4) Menus Definition\nThe Settings menu uses dropdown menus that do not define the proper role or state information for the expanded menus. The expanded menus are instead defined as a tab control with incorrect roles and properties defined on the tablist child elements.  Screen reader users will not understand this menu and will have difficulty interacting with it.\nRecommended Modification\n- Remove role=\"tooltip\" from the <span> with the button name for the Settings button.\n- Remove all of the tablist, tabpanel, and tab roles.\n- Remove all instances of aria-labelled-by (the attribute is also misspelled, but this is not required on these elements).\n- Define the menu using WAI-ARIA:\n    - Use role=\"menu\" on the <ul> elements and add role=\"presentation\" on the <li> elements for the lists in the expanded menus.\n    - Use role=\"menuitem\" on the buttons in the expanded menus. \n    - Userole=\"menuitemradio\" and the aria-checked attribute for the submenus with radio buttons (remove the radio input and label elements).\n    - In the submenus, the buttons at the top (Captions, Quality, Speed) are defined as menu buttons but they do not open a menu, they navigate back to the previous menu.  Remove aria-haspopup and aria-expanded from the buttons and add visually-hidden text \"go back to previous menu\" so screen readers understand the action of these elements.\nSee http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menubutton for more information and examples.\n5) Settings Keyboard Access\nThe expanded Settings menus do not have the keyboard interaction users expect.  Screen reader users are told to use the arrow keys to navigate the menus but this does not work properly.\nIn addition, when navigating the radio submenu items, a selection is automatically made and the menu is collapsed. Keyboard and screen reader users will have difficulty with the menus.\nRecommended Modification\n - When keyboard focus is on the Settings menu button, pressing space or enter opens or closes the menu.\n- When the menu is opened, keyboard focus should be moved to the first element in the expanded menu.\n- From within the expanded menus:\n    - Space/Enter opens a submenu if present and keyboard focus should be moved to the first item or activates the menu item and closes the menu.\n    - Up-arrow should move keyboard focus to the previous menu item or wraps to the last.\n    - Down-arrow should move keyboard focus to the next menu item or wraps to the first.\n    - Left-arrow should move keyboard focus back to the previous menu.\n    - Right-arrow should open the submenu and keyboard focus should be moved to the first item, if no submenu moves to the next menu item.\nSee http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menu for details.\n6) Buttons Keyboard Access\nThe buttons elements cannot be used with the keyboard consistently across different browsers and Assistive Technology/browser combinations. Content is not accessible to screen reader or keyboard users when mouse actions are required.\nRecommended Modification\n- Do not auto-hide the control bar when a control is activated.  Before triggering the auto-hide, wait for a period of inactivity.\n- Keyboard only:\n    - In FF, The Play/Pause button cannot be activated with the keyboard, it changes briefly but then switches back to the previous state.  For the other buttons, the button with focus activates that button but also activates the Play/Pause button and hides the control bar.\n    - In IE, once the video starts, the Play/Pause button cannot be activated with the keyboard or mouse.\n    - In Chrome, the spacebar only activates the Play/Pause button regardless of which button has focus.\n- With a screen reader running:\n    - The buttons cannot be activated using NVDA/Firefox.\n    - The Play/Pause button cannot be activated using JAWS/IE.\n7 ) Focus visibility\na) (IE Only) The video controls, including the menus, have no visible focus indicators in IE. Mouse users get visible cues that a page element is actionable (mouse pointer change, rollover color change, etc.) that are not available to keyboard-only users.\nRecommended Modification\nMake sure that there is a clear visual indicator when an object receives focus and when the mouse pointer moves over the object. For example, you could add an outline or change of background color.\nb) Keyboard focus indicators are used in Firefox and Chrome but are difficult to distinguish against the colors used for the buttons and background for the large Play button overlaid on the video and for the seek and volume sliders. Keyboard-only users and low-vision users may not be able to see where they are on the page.\nRecommended Modification\nChange the focus indicator to be more visible. If a custom focus indicator is used, it should have at least a 3:1 color contrast ratio between the color used for the focus indicator and the background it is used on.\n8) Tab Order\nThe non-interactive video container is in the tab order. Screen reader and keyboard-only users expect only interactive elements to be in the tab order.  In some browsers/screen readers, this will be announced as \"clickable\" which will be confusing to screen reader users.\nRecommended Modification\n- Remove the tabindex=\"0\" from all non-interactive elements. \n- In addition, remove the aria-label attribute, its use is not valid in this context:\n<div class=\"plyr plyr--full-ui plyr--video plyr--html5 plyr--captions-enabled plyr--fullscreen-enabled plyr--captions-active plyr--paused\">\n9) Contrast on focus\nImage icons used for the video controls have insufficient contrast (less than 3:1) when they have keyboard focus. Users who are color blind or cannot perceive color may not perceive the content.\nRecommended Modification\nIncrease color contrast to have 3:1 color contrast ratio when the buttons have focus.  \nNote: This issue is has low priority because it is not currently a requirement under WCAG 2.0 however, it will be a requirement in the upcoming WCAG 2.1.\n10) Valid Markup\nThe video player contains coding errors that may prevent assistive technologies (AT) from interpreting content correctly. AT users may be unable to perceive or interact with page content and forms.\nRecommended Modification\nFix the validation errors.\n\n\n\nThat's it Sam. \nAs I mentioned, this became more complex than I was expecting, so let me know what are you thoughts on this, and also if you need clarifications on any of the issues reported.\nIf you decide to fix this, when everything is completed I'll ask the consultant to verify the player again and see if everything is ok.\nHope it helps!. Hi @sampotts \nMy time to ask hehe, do you have any update on this?\nThanks!. Hey @sampotts \nNp, thanks for replying.\nWhenever you have an ETA please let me know if possible.\nThanks!. Hi @sampotts \nJust checking in if you have any updated on this or need any additional help / support.\nThanks!. Hey @sampotts, how it's going with these fixes? I saw there's some commits so I imagine some are already fixed?\nIs there any particular issue that is harder and I may help?. Hey @sampotts \nAbout the focus on iE11, I didn't take a look on the code but maybe check what CSS properties you are using to write the outline. I know that iE doesn't support outline-offset for example so in some elements we had to add a 1 or 2px transparent border so the outline is correctly visible.\nOr if the element already use borders with colors, then we add a 2px padding on the element parent/container, so the outline has enough space and doesn't get cut by the parent element.\nHope that helps.\nEdit: sorry about the close/open, misclicked the button -_-. Hey @sampotts , how it's going with this? Any ETA?\nThanks. Hi @sampotts \nGreat job done on the plugin guys!\nI've tested the beta version here and I found some issues considering the report:\n3) Sliders\n\nI noted that the volume slider aria-valuetext could receive values like 55.00000000001%, so this get's announced on screen readers which is a really big number. Better to make sure this is always rounded numbers, don't need to use decimal points.\n\n4) Menu Definitions\n\nThe settings container still has a wrongly added aria-labelled-by attribute, which is misspelled by the way. Should be removed.\n\n5) Settings Keyboard Access\n\n\nSettings menu open with space as expected, but ENTER is not working correctly, only opens for a second and then closes automatically.\n\n\nWhen inside a settings submenu, for example Captions, space works correctly (select the item and go back to previous menu with the new selection focused), but ENTER doesn't, it goes back but no item has focus indicator.\n\n\nIn iE 11, the settings menu cannot be navigated with UP/DOWN arrows as other browsers, only TAB.\n\n\nWhen NVDA is runing, the settings menu will not work at all, neither with Space or Enter key, regardless the browser. NVDA is free so you can install to test. To disable / enable speech mode use the modification key (in my case I set to capslock) + S.\n\n\nExtra:  Also noted there's a debugging console enabled, is this intended / to be configurable?\nI'll still do some more testing here but that's what I got so far.\n. Great @sampotts \nI'll wait for these last issues to do a full review then.\nThanks!. @sampotts it's been quite some time since the last changes, any updates on the remaining issues?. Hi @sampotts \nI believe the article is more concerned about the overusing of the aria menus when not necessary, like a simple website menu that can be entirely solved with simple html semantics using ul > li > ul. \nThe player settings menu is pretty complex and I imagine that for this solution they believed that the aria menu was the way to go, as the consultant team take in consideration the structure that was already on the player and also to the specific user case they are testing for.\n. @sampotts any updates on this? It's been quite some time with basically the iE11 and NVDA issues open as far I remember.. ",
    "brennanyoung": "Really excellent work guys! We chose plyr because of a11y, and because it is light and elegant. We've been disappointed with other tech chosen on the basis of a11y promises that didn't deliver. \nVery impressed with keyboard operation on this thing. Superb. You made my life easier and gave us something I can solidly recommend to colleagues and peers.\nAs mentioned by fleps, still some issues with the settings menu. I can't seem to focus on (and thereby select) the lang radiobuttons with keyboard, apart from the one that's already selected. \n(I agree with fleps, the up/down arrow keys should move the focus between items when the settings menu is open. This behavior is recommended by the W3C ARIA patterns document. They operate the volume control atm.)\nHope your cold is better @sampotts  :). Interesting article. But my takeaway is not \"don't do it\", but rather \"don't just add the role and imagine that it is enough\".\nIn other words, if you use the aria menu roles, you should go the whole hog, and ensure all the associated behaviour is in place. If not, don't use those roles.\nI've asked on the web-a11y slack for their comments about the article.. ",

This manages to get a few of the appropriate class names applied to the '#player' element but still no styling. . @sampotts The functionality seems to be working appropriately now. I modified my code to check for the url source of the video(youtube/vimeo OR S3) - and then return the appropriate code accordingly(in React.js)\nYoutube/Vimeo \n<div className='video-widget'>\n                   <div className=\"plyr__video-embed\" id={this.props.elementId} onClick={() => this.handleClick ()} onMouseOver={() => this.handleMouseOver ()} onMouseOut={() => this.handleMouseOut ()}>\n                       <iframe src={this.props.videoPlayerData.src}></iframe>\n                   </div>\n                </div>\ns3\n<div className='video-widget'>\n                    <video className=\"plyr__video-embed\" id={this.props.elementId} playsinline onClick={() => this.handleClick ()} onMouseOver={() => this.handleMouseOver ()} onMouseOut={() => this.handleMouseOut ()}>\n                        <source src={this.props.videoPlayerData.src} type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n                    </video>\n                </div>\nAnd now it seems to work.

    "ManBearTM": "@friday The issue referenced is still open and does not seem to solve the problem. Wrapping it in a no-ssr component will not help since this error does not occur when plyr is initialized, but instead as soon as the module is imported.\nThe error @mimse got is from this line in defaults.js. The problem is that the defaults object is created as soon as the plyr module is imported (which also happens server-side). There is also multiple cases in the support.js file, fx. here it creates DOM elements when imported. And the user agent is sniffed in multiple files as soon as they are imported (for example here in controls.js).\nAs I see it the issue is that Plyr is not a pure module. It should not cause functions to be executed on external dependencies (such as navigator and document) when importing and it certainly shouldn't create DOM elements just by importing the module.\nJust to clarify on how to reproduce the issue, you don't need to create a react app or use any other framework. All you need to do is install plyr to node_modules, then run the following code in Node:\njs\nconst Plyr = require('plyr')\nThe issue can be worked around by conditionally importing plyr using require (in componentDidMount for React), but this means we are missing out on the advantages of ES6 import syntax.. Yes, I think wrapping it in a function should do the trick, at least for the defaults. Not sure if that is possible for the other cases, but I\u2019d be happy to take a stab at it in a PR?. ",

The menu closes on mouseout from the player, when the whole control bar is hidden. It also does when the video is loaded but the mouse is not over the menu. But when the mouse is still over the quality menu when the video is loaded, the menu stays open. Tested in both FF, Chrome and Chromium, with both windows and linux (mint)\nAlso, after being closed/hidden, the menu will not reset its current state to the main menu but rather stay on the quality menu (not sure it's intended). My bad, the radio-like span shows on Plyr website as well as on the codepen demo.\nIt must be related to my use case. I load my sources from HTML (Blaze frontend) if it helps to spot the issue. \nThe behaviour is the same when the sources are completely loaded using JS.\n. ",

Except not even the play button appears for me.\n\n@mostafaznv did you do anything else to get it to work? I tried pointing the iconUrl to the local plyr.svg but no luck.\n\nno. I just addressed svg locally.. ",
    "danjaywing": "@mostafaznv Can you confirm exactly what you did to get this working? I too am pointing the code to the local svg - it works everywhere BUT IOS.\nThis is very frustrating.. @sampotts The icons are also missing on plyr.io, this isn't a cache issue, or a local implementation issue.. Correct, iOS9, which accounts for 19.5% of all iPads according to the stats here: https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/. I believe this is the same issue as reported here #1191, only I've tried the version that the fix is supposedly applied to and I'm having no luck.\nI'm not convinced it's the loading of the sprite, rather it's the handling of the sprite.. Confirmed, issue present in Safari 9.1. @sampotts I checked in safari 9.1 and the SVGs are still using href as opposed to xlink:href, this in spite of the line of code you added to resolve it\n. Yet this article suggests it's the caching mentioned in other tickets:\nhttps://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/safari-svg-sprite-bug/\nI'm at a loss, I need this resolving as iOS9 is very much still a thing, and it's a shame as plyr is generally a great solution.\n. Well with the latter link I'm not convinced you'll get it working with svg sprites, the reason OP's big play button loads is because it's loading the sprite in once and then locking it away in cache preventing the others from loading.\nSeems the only way around it is to inline the svgs.\nYou're using svg4everybody right? Might there be a way of tricking it into thinking SVG isn't supported in iOS9 so that it renders the fallback images?\nOr could you detect and render fallbacks yourself?. ",

Then, if this config \"preload\" is set, it would be easily inherited when calling the source setter (see below). This option could also be used to overload any original options set in the HTML audio element:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/de4707125638dc1b04da0b4cf690fb2259fefd63/src/js/source.js#L78-L98\nThen when media load() is being called, preload would be properly set:\nhttps://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/de4707125638dc1b04da0b4cf690fb2259fefd63/src/js/source.js#L122\n. > > ..and this media element contains the original preload=\"none\" attribute (which is now lost)\n\nI agree with this being a big problem. State should be stored properly so it isn't lost. In a different place where this pattern was used I copied the original attribute and reapplied it to the new element.\nNot sure this issue is something Plyr should be concerned with. Plyr doesn't manage network connections. It's really a browser/OS thing, but #1201 looks like a legit issue.\n\nYeah that's what I thought so. I don't event know if it's possible to control the socket management layer of audio/media handling on the browser side. It seems indeed a browser issue, but fixing #1201 would be a nice compromise/workaround to avoid this issue.. ",

Also if you want I can place here a translation for pt-PT.. > @HybridSolutions You currently have to pass your translation manually to i18n object in Plyr. See README for details. But my PR #1269 would add support for just specifying languages because translation would be bundled directly in Plyr.\nWell if the author adopts your #1269 , I can provide translation for Portuguese.. The instructions are not very clear for multiple instances. \nYou have  const player = new Plyr(document.querySelectorAll('.js-player')); but this will not apply the player to all the instances, and i believe that's why there's some confusion.\nIf Plyr accepts that line of code, then this\njavascript\n Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('video')).forEach(video => {\n    players[video.id] = new Plyr(video, { ...options });\n});\ncould be done internally.\nAlso, you don't show how to specify options when using const players = Plyr.setup('.js-player'); in the instructions.\nI assume the correct way is:\nconst players = Plyr.setup('.mediaplayer', {\n                captions: {active: true}, \n                tooltips: {controls: true, seek: true}\n});\nThese issues could be improved in the documentation for clear understanting on how the player works..\nKeep up the great work!\n. you should use that because for isntance pt-PT is different from pt-BR.. I think so. . ",
