    "jhnns": "Version bump and publish please :wink: :+1: \n. :dancers: \n. Does node-sass provide an api to intercept the compilation process? @sokra is using the Less-Parser in the less-loader\n. I've made some investigation and it seems like libsass (which node-sass is based on) is not providing a way to intercept the loading of files. This means that we can't resolve files by webpack's algorithm.\nAt least libsass is exposing an array of all imported files which can be marked as dependency. Unfortunately node-sass isn't exposing this yet.\n. > @import will not use webpack's pipeline (unless it is a CSS import that gets passed to css-loader).\nExactly. You can raise your voice here, maybe they'll implement it.\n\nWhat else?\n\nThe watch-mode won't work for sass-modules since webpack doesn't know about the dependencies. If node-sass exposed the array of all imported files, at least this could be fixed. Until then a third-party watcher which simply watches all scss-files can be used.\n\nIt would probably be nice to add a caveat to the documentation for this loader\n\nYep :+1: . Creating a pull-request of the readme is very easy on GitHub. Just click the edit-button :smile: \n. Cool!\n. Btw: I'm currently working on this at node-sass. You can watch the progress there.\n. includedFiles landed in node-sass today, so marking dependencies is now possible.\n. It seems like there is an issue on macs...\n. Have you initialized the submodule libsass? It seems like it can't find the header files:\n../sass_context_wrapper.h:1:36: fatal error: libsass/sass_interface.h: No such file or directory\n. Yup!\n. Nice! :+1: \n. @sokra ?\n@lukebrooker This is completely handled by node-sass, but I assume that it is imported twice as this is sass' default behavior. However, there are hacks to avoid it.\n. @ryanseddon This kind of modularity is currently not possible with any CSS preprocessor (LESS and SASS), because each compilation is self-contained and doesn't know about previous compilations. That's why every require() of a SASS or LESS file creates a complete standalone CSS file with all the duplicates.\nHowever, LESS provides a way to import other LESS files without including the source which works quite well.\n. Yep https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/22 :grinning:\n. Ok thx :+1: \n. Cool, thx.\n. We should check if this is possible with the current beta version of node-sass.\nThe current master branch is already using node-sass 2.0, so we can start playing with it now.\n. Has been published as v0.4.1. I've added instructions to the README.\n. inline-source-map is the best option for development, because it requires no setup to retrieve the original source. However, it's not suitable for production, that's why we leave it up to the user to configure.\n. But a segmentation fault is not an issue of the sass-loader?\n. It's a tricky question. There are pro and cons for both sides. The less-loader decided to move it to peerDependencies...\n. I think we should move it to the peerDependencies. There is a greater benefit for most developers to specify the sass version directly (see recent pull-requests and issues regarding node-sass v2).\nNow that peerDependencies will not be deprecated.\n. done()\n. node-sass just implemented the api (sass/node-sass#530). Now we need to wait for v2 to be released.\n. > Is this now working?\nNope, we need to adjust the sass-loader for this. But I guess it's ready to be implemented :grimacing: \n. @akiran ok to merge?\n. I could do it. But currently I don't have a sass-project either, it's just personal interest :grinning:. Maybe both @akiran and me? \n. Most of the time I publish under the name of peerigon.\n. :+1: \n. Looks good to me!\n. Published as 0.3.1\n. Mhmmm guessing from the comments it is an issue related to node 0.11. When I run npm i sass-loader on node 0.10.33 there are no errors.\nSince node 0.11 is not a stable release I don't think we need to lock the version number...\n. Damn!\n. Starting with 1.0.0, node-sass is now a peerDependency\n. Fixed with https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/113\n. This is more likely an issue with npm or your setup. I can't find any clue why this should be a problem with sass-loader itself.\n. Cool, thx! :+1: Could you also add some tests?\n. Synchronous compilation has been implemented, but there is no flag yet...\n. I don't know what the correct settings are, but you probably need to adjust the $icon-font-path-variable. Bootstrap provides the possibility to configure the path to the icon fonts. Make sure that the url() is pointing from the imported file (probably /assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss in your case) to the font-files.\n. You need to think from the css-loader's perspective. It gets a css-file with url() statements referencing files. Now you need to start from the css-file's location and walk the relative url to the file and look if the path is correct.\n. Related discussions: sass/sass#1015 sass/libsass#532\nYou could also try this sass mixin to achieve relative urls.\n. :+1: \n. $bootstrap-sass-asset-helper might also work. However, setting $icon-font-path relative to the scss entry file does also work. I'm using this setting in my projects.\n. There is a test for bootstrap. It must be related to your local config.\n. There's a note about this problem at https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#problems-with-url. Why was this not helpful? We have a test for bootstrap: https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/blob/master/test/scss/bootstrap-sass.scss\n. First of all, thank you for your pull-request. I'm glad you noticed the new includedFiles-feature, I've implemented it in node-sass :grinning:\nWe've discussed about marking dependencies. The problem is, that libsass is ignoring the whole module when there's a syntax error. Thus webpack's file watcher will not fire, even after you've fixed the error. This has probably been fixed with a new version of libsass (I recall a discussion about this at libsass). But before we're removing sass-graph we need to assert that all dependencies are marked (even those with a syntax error).\nHowever, I'm willing to publish a beta of the sass-loader which will use the new node-sass version. There will also be custom importers which will integrate nicely with webpack's custom resolving engine.\n. That would be great :+1: \n. I'm getting an error on node 0.11.14\nmodule.js:355\n  Module._extensions[extension](this, filename);\n                               ^\nError: Module did not self-register.\n    at Error (native)\n    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)\n    at Module.require (module.js:365:17)\n    at require (module.js:384:17)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/jhnns/dev/jtangelder/sass-loader/node_modules/node-sass/lib/index.js:211:15)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:460:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:478:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)\nThis is probably related to a recent fix at node-sass. I don't think that we can publish the current state because it would break all projects using node 0.11.x.\n. We should probably also bump our major version, because according to node-sass it is a breaking change.\n. node-sass 2.0.0 has been released... sass/node-sass#157\n. Has been published as 0.4.0\n. #41\n. Has been published as 0.4.0.\n. Thx\n. LESS is handling these issues way more elegantly...\n. Afaik libsass doesn't touch urls(). This error is probably caused by the css-loader. \nThe webpack-way of doing this is to configure the file-loader or url-loader for these binary files.\nIf you're really sure that webpack shouldn't manage these assets, you can use root urls (= urls starting with a /) to signalize the css-loader, that it shouldn't touch them.\n. Mhmm I'm not quite sure ... could be an issue with sass-graph. Could you remove the calls of markDependencies() in your local installation of the sass-loader and check, if the problem still exists?\n. Fixed?\n. We don't depend on sass-graph anymore.\n. Donnu ... if our tests are passing, we should publish it. If our tests are passing while we know that it doesn't work in actual projects, we should fix our tests :grin: \n. You mean because of https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/41#issuecomment-70372228?\n. Yep, I've published it.\nWe should consider using a major version bump and following semver...\n. Could you show an example how you'd expect things to work?\nI'm afraid that this is currently not possible (if I got it right). But with custom importers #31 it's probably possible. Then you can write a special loader, which generates scss code to import your dynamic vars.\n. Mhmmm your solution would probably work too.\nAnd when you need to access the variables also via client-side JavaScript:\njavascript\nwebpack.DefinePlugin(require(\"./styles/variables.js\"));\n. Oh, there are use-cases where this is required... :)\nI'll check that!\n. @Kasu haha, nice!\n@nwhite89 no I don't think so. I don't want to extend the language itself...\n. Is @EdwardIrby 's solution working for you? I'd like to link the loader in our README, but I'm not sure about how safe that string replaces are :grin: ...\nDo you have any experience on this?\n. Thx @nightgrey \nThis issue can now also be solved with the data-option. Just define any Sass code which will be prepended to the actual entry file.\n. > It's a bit confusing where to options, query params or sassLoader\nI know... this will be simpler with webpack 2 where there is a dedicated way to set the options (query params didn't work so well with more complex use-cases).\n. Nope, looks good. There must be a different error in your setup.\n. @nagarajay Does this work for you?\n. When they're using !default, yes. Otherwise, no.\n. While this is true for webpack 1, this has been changed with webpack 2. See current README.. You're right, but this will probably be fixed as soon as node-sass 2.0 is ready-to-use.\n. @akiran Should we publish it without beta?\n. #51\n. Sorry for not answering this.\nFirst of all: Thank you for work. I appreciate every contribution. Unfortunately this PR looks a bit over-complicated to me. Imho you're using too much internal stuff which can then break easily when @sokra changes something.\nWe can take the less-loader as blueprint since it already has this feature for quite some time. The important code is here. We can let webpack/enhanced-resolve do the resolving by calling\njavascript\n// loaderContext is `this` inside the loader\nloaderContext.resolve(context, moduleRequest, cb)\nTake also a look at the loader api.\nI'll publish a branch which contains the refactoring for node-sass@2.0.0\n. Oh, ok... didn't know that you already tried the less-loader approach.\n@izaakschroeder what do you mean by \"module urls\"? Inlined loaders?\n@sokra is that true? Does loaderContext.resolve not apply inline loaders?\nI don't know what you mean by \"root directory\", but the described behavior should be done with loaderUtils.urlToRequest(url)\n. Check out this chapter of loader-utils.\nThe ~-prefix points to module directories. This should be consistent across all loaders where the import/require syntax doesn't differentiate between local and module directories. The css-loader and less-loader are already using it.\n. I've implemented the custom importer with the less-loader approach.\nAnyway, thanks for your suggestions :+1: \n. Running npm install sass-loader and inspecting the package.json outputs:\njavascript\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"loader-utils\": \"^0.2.5\",\n    \"node-sass\": \"^2.0.1\",\n    \"sass-graph\": \"^1.0.3\"\n  },\n. Try to run it in an empty folder. You've probably specified another version in your package.json.\n. No problem\n. The sass-loader just returns a string containing css so you should be free to do whatever you want. However, I do recommend that you use the css-loader, so that all referenced images are written to the output folder as well.\nI don't know anything about the css-loader returning arrays or something. I thought it would also just return a string (but I also haven't used the output directly yet).\n. Thx\n. Starting with 1.0.0, we don't depend on sass-graph anymore.\n. Thx.\nPublished as 0.4.2\n. I'll take a look\n. Could you create a small test-case? I need to know more about your actual project structure, because source maps are working as expected in our repo.\n. No problem. :grinning: \n. #31 \n. > Just wanted to confirm my understanding after reading through the issues that a solution to this is still being worked on?\nYes\n. Thank you for your PR! But I'll favor #61, if that's ok for you :)\n. Published as 0.5.0.\nJust wanted to point out that node-sass will be listed as peerDependency with sass-loader 1.0.0\n. Thx :+1: \n. Not yet. You could switch isSync to true in your local installation to test it. I heard that sync compilation is awful slow in sufficient complex projects so this has no priority for me.\n. Stuck processes should be no issue with 2.0.0 anymore. So this flag is not necessary.\n. Yep, I was also getting these. You need to stick with sass-loader 0.x until this is fixed. :unamused: \n. I've managed to write a version of sass-loader that provides the same features while depending on node-sass 2.1.1. It's on a separate branch and can be installed via npm i sass-loader@0.6.x. Please note, that sass-loader 0.6.0 is listing node-sass as peerDependency as well.\n. I didn't expect node-sass 3.0.0-beta to be so unstable, but \u2013 well \u2013 it is a beta. @alexhawkins you can use old versions of sass-loader until the current ones are stable.\n. Afaik sass-loader@0.4.2 is the last version that does not bother you with errors\n. @raphaelsaunier I've updated the README\n. @haustraliaer that are good news. Please let me know if everything works as expected. I'll remove the note in the README then.\n. @alexduan this does not happen in our tests, so please try to narrow it down and open a separate issue.\n. With sass-loader 1.0.0 node-sass should now be a dependency of your project.\n. node-sass@3.0.0-alpha.0 is \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 not stable :wink:. Probably the same issues as #65 \n. The files are now resolved by webpack, and webpack doesn't care about the _ mechanism. However, since Sass users are expecting this feature to work (although it has nothing to with the language itself and should imho not be part of the specification, but that's another topic :wink:), I'm willing to implement this feature.\nIf you don't want to replace all your import statements, I recommend to stick with sass-loader 0.x for now. There are also some issues on OSX afaik #65. \n. Should be fixed with 1.0.1\n. Is that a wildcard or do you have a file called *.scss? Wildcards are not supported.\n. #151 \nAre globs supported by Rubysass? Why are people expecting this to work?\n. node-sass 3.0.0 is causing some trouble :cry:\n71\n. I've managed to write a version of sass-loader that provides the same features while depending on node-sass 2.1.1. It's on a separate branch and can be installed via npm i sass-loader@0.6.x. Please note, that sass-loader 0.6.0 is listing node-sass as peerDependency as well.\n. I suppose, this is a problem with node-sass/libsass itself, because sass-loader is just passing the input on.\n. Mhmm damn ... we can't just decrement the node-sass dependency because sass-loader 1.0.0 builds on the new API introduced with 3.0.0.\nMaybe I can publish a stable sass-loader version without the new features introduced with 1.0.0...\n. @am11 thx for the support! 3.0.0-beta.4 is working pretty reliable in our tests.\n. It's in node-sass: https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/713\n. I've managed to write a version of sass-loader that provides the same features while depending on node-sass 2.1.1. It's on a separate branch and can be installed via npm i sass-loader@0.6.x. Please note, that sass-loader 0.6.0 is listing node-sass as peerDependency as well.\n. Yeah, we've realized that too :disappointed:. It's a problem inside the custom importer code.\n. Awesome!\n. With sass-loader 2.0.0, you should have no problems with it anymore.\n. Thx for the feedback, but this error does not seem to be related to sass-loader...\n. Would it be possible if we didn't set the option? How is node-sass supposed to know, which syntax is used?\n. Shipped with v1.0.2.\nImporting a file with the other language style requires the extension to be set explicitly.\n. I don't think that this is a sass-loader issue, because we're just passing the input to node-sass which passes it on to libsass. \nYou could make a PR to sass-spec to demonstrate the problem. Maybe @mgreter can help you.\n. There are actually tests for error reporting, so I don't expect this issue to be a problem of sass-loader. Could you provide a minimal example of your project where the error occurs?\n. Thx, I'll take a look\n. Is this still an issue?\n. I'm glad to hear that :+1: \n. Thx for the report. Could you check if that is a node-sass or libsass issue? The sass-loader just passes the input on.\n. There is an working example with bootstrap-sass in our test-folder: https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/tree/master/test/bootstrapSass\n. Is notsass a css file?\n. So is this a duplicate of #73?\n. Yep, that problem is vice versa, because the feature doesn't exist :grin: \n. Probably caused by #73\n. Does v1.0.2 fix this issue?\n. I'm glad I could help :grinning: \n. Yep. We need to track that issue, it's not a sass-loader thing.\n. Is the URL wrong or is the map file just not generated?\n. You're right. It looks like this has changed in webpack somehow... need to investigate.\n. Thx for investigating this.... so maybe we just need to remove all the sourceMappingURL references added by libsass?\n. > Maybe there should be an option for libsass to generate a source map without adding a reference\nWell, that option doesn't make sense from libsass' point of view ^^\n. I'll try that out, thanks!\n. Yep. See #123 \n. No problem, that's a legitimate question :grin: \nWe had the experience that most of the time it's more useful when the app author is able to specify the exact module version. sass-loader is basically just calling render(), the actual language features are used by you, the app author.\nOtherwise we had to publish a new version for each node-sass version, which is a maintenance nightmare.\nIt's the same problem with the less-loader btw.\n. No problem. 0.6.0 is actually the latest version that has been published. But that was a compatibility fix for an older version.\n. That's node-sass or libsass afaik. There is no console.log() in sass-loader.\n. Have you tried using https:// urls?\nBtw: Could you please format your question decently. You're expecting us to help you, so please help us understanding you.\n. Ah interesting... thx.\n. 0.6.0 is the last published version, because it contains a fix for the 0 major release. However, the current version you should install is v1.0.1\n. How do you configure the sass-loader in your webpack.config?\n. @sokra How do the paths need to be escaped?\n. Is this still an issue?\n. Yes, honestly, using encodeURIComponent is counter-intuitive. On the other hand, the configuration writer is the only person who can escape it properly because they know where the characters belong to. Is & part of the config or is it used to distinguish different parameters?\n. That PR looks good! I'm definitely willing to merge that. :+1:\nJust add some tests :)\n. Shipped with v1.0.2\n. All url()s must be relative to the sass main entry file, because the css-loader resolves the url()s based on this location.\nLess has an option which rewrites the urls accordingly, but Sass has not afaik. Have you tried overriding the $icon-font-path instead?\n. Oops, that's probably a bug introduced with 1.0.2. We have to take care of .css file extensions\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. I know that issue, but afaik it is not restricted to the sass-loader, it's a webpack-dev-server issue. I've experienced this with javascript code as well @sokra\n. I'll investigate this as soon as I've found some time.\n. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/104#issuecomment-108525870\n. Fixed with 1.0.4\n. Remove the sass-loader entry in your package.json and run npm i sass-loader@1.x --save. This should (currently) pull node-sass@3.1.1 \n. That's strange. The sass-loader doesn't modify any paths. Webpack should also be possible to work with these paths. Could you find out how these paths are messed up? What is actually wrong?\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. ^3.0.0-beta.4 should pull all versions up to 4.0.0 afaik.\n. Is it 5 times D or 6 times D? ^^ #DDDDD is no valid CSS color, #DDDDDD is.\n. Mhmm nope. That's a node-sass error so it should probably be reported in their repo. Can you isolate the error in a single file and compile that without webpack, just with node-sass?\nYou could try to not use protocol-relative URIs.\n. Is this still an issue with 2.0.0?\n. Since sass-loader 1.0.0 you don't need to set the includePaths manually. It should be resolved like a webpack module.\nThe error about not finding _foundation.scss is misleading, I have to admit. But the sass-loader always tries to resolve the module without a preceding underscore first, then with underscore. So that's not the error (I probably have to rework the error messages).\nCould you post your webpack.config.js?\n. Mhmm it could be that includePaths is broken since 1.0.0 because webpack is responsible for resolving paths (I still need to confirm that in a test though). However, it should work if you do it the webpack-way: Add ./src/main/resources/vendor/ to resolve.root and then write @import \"~foundation/scss/foundation\"\n. > I would prefer to write the scss (and really, all my code) webpack-agnostically\nThat's a valid argument...\nI'll have a look as soon as I found some time. Unfortunately I'm loaded with work... :unamused:. In the meantime, you can also take a look for yourself. The code is not complicated, but it requires some understanding about how to write loaders for webpack.\n. Should be fixed with 1.0.3\n. Probably also related to #100?\n. That's strange, thx for reporting this. Could you set up a small gist that reproduces the error?\n. @haustraliaer 's example shows the hangs.\n. I would be happy to provide a temporary fix, but #109 seems a bit risky to me...\n. If someone can publish a project that makes this reproducible, that would be a big help \ud83d\udc4d . Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. @jsg2021 When you add the .css extension, libsass does not include the file, it just turns it into @import url(..). When this is passed to the css-loader, all urls must be relative to the file which imports them. When you omit .css, libsass includes the file just like it was a .scss file. In this situation, all urls must be relative to the entry sass/scss file which was passed to the sass compiler.\nThis is how libsass handles it, the sass-loader is just imitating it.\n. Mhmm I don't have a working Windows setup to reproduce the error. Would be great if you could give me some insight. The sass-loader is not a huge project, so it should be fairly understandable.\nThis is the line that makes the included file known to webpack.\n. Do you use npm link or bower link?\n. Will be fixed with the next major version. You can already test the master branch.\n. Fixed with 2.0.0\n. Interesting @jeffling :+1: \nI think it's also possible to just do something like\n``` javascript\nmy-namespace {\n@import \"all/that/stuff\";\n\n}\n```\n. Yep. To be honest, I haven't found a way the other way round without code duplication.\n. Thanks for the pull-request, but I'm not sure if I should merge it. It increases the size of the final css considerably and thus is not an option to use in production...\nAs long as your able to set sourceMapContents=true in your app, that's a fair workaround.\n. After fiddling around, I realized that webpack includes the sourceMapContents by default anyway. Thus I've finally merged this manually. Shipped with 1.0.4.\nThx for your effort! :+1: \n. Yep, that's a known problem of preprocessors (both SASS and Less). I haven't found an easy way for SASS, though. Less introduced the import (reference) mechanism for that use-case.\n. We can't solve this because each require() of a SASS file from a JS file will trigger a distinct compilation. This is how loaders work.. That's a confirmed concurrency issue of node-sass 3. See #100 \n. Thx for the sample project. With \"live reload\": Do you mean page reload on file change or do you actually mean Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which replaces the stylesheets on the fly (#37)?\n. There's currently an issue with the style-loader which makes HMR impossible.\n. HMR is not a concern of the sass-loader. Thx for reporting this. I'll have a look as soon as I found some time. Unfortunately I'm loaded with work... :unamused:.\nIn the meantime, you can also take a look for yourself. The code is not complicated, but it requires some understanding about how to write loaders for webpack.\n. Is this still an issue with the recent version of sass-loader?\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. Mhmmm ... do you know how deasync works? I'm a bit afraid to merge this when deasync is messing with node's event loop. It looks like black magic to me :grinning: \nCan more people try this PR locally? If it fixes the current issues (and deasync is \"harmless\"), I am willing to merge it.\n. Issue fixed by #132.\nBut thank you for your effort and your proposal :+1:. Although I did not merge it, I do think that these contributions help to improve the code.\n. @oopschen Thx for investigating this! See PR for discussion.\n. Should be fixed with 1.0.3\n. That's a nice feature I was also already thinking about.\nThis should be doable with node-sass' custom importer. The sass-loader is already using it to plug-in webpack's file resolver. Acoording to node-sass' README, you can also specify an array of functions for importer.\nYou could try to prepend a JSON custom importer, which generates a SASS map if encounters a JSON-file. In all the other cases, it should return sass.NULL (according to node-sass' README). If you're successful, we can change the sass-loader so that anyone can prepend own custom importers (currently, importer would just be overwritten).\n. Thx for the pull-request. Please add tests that demonstrate what kind of bug you were trying to fix, so that future code changes won't regress this feature.\nI'll review the PR as soon as I found some time.\n. That looks good! :+1: I'll merge (and refactor) and publish it in a few days.\nSorry, I was not aware that the tests were not running for people cloning a fresh copy of the repository. It should work for everyone without extra work just by running npm test.\n. Shipped with 1.0.3\n. This probably requires a call of loadModule(). I need to find out if there is a synchronous version of that method.\n. I talked to @sokra and he's planing to deprecate synchronous loaders, which means we could use loadModule(). It was initially introduced to allow synchronous require() in node without compiling. The target: \"node\" config, however, is more practical in most real world use-cases.\nThen I need to clean up the code as it currently contains a lot of duplication and branching because of sync support.\n. Close?\n. That looks good, thx. :+1:\n. Shipped with 1.0.3\n. Didn't know that git supports file modes ^^\n. Thx :+1: \n. Fixed with 2.0.0\n. I've followed these discussions in several repositories.\nI think it's a huge benefit for all these \"plugin modules\" like the sass-loader if you can specify the exact Sass/LESS/grunt/gulp/whatever version. These \"plugin modules\" are just a thin layer between your app and another big library. It does not feel right if they bring this dependency in. And it's very time-consuming to handle all the \"bump version\" PRs :)\nI'm open for further discussion, but we won't change this soon. That's why I'll close this for now.\n. I see, we need to omit the source maps because otherwise webpack's source map comment would be ignored. Without .omitSourceMapUrl it looks like this:\n``` css\nbody {\n  background: lightgrey; }\n/# sourceMappingURL=test/output/sass.map /  <-- from node-sass\n/# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,.../  <-- from webpack\n``\n. Will be published soon. I just need to do some tests and I'll update the docs. Also related to #104.\n. Shipped with1.0.4`\n. Thx for your effort @DawidJanczak. Does https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/113 solve the same thing?\n. Anyway, thx! :+1: \n. Yes, a public example would be helpful. Besides that: Which version of sass-loader do you use? We've fixed some bugs with 1.0.3 concerning the import system.\n. Ok, thx. Then we need a test to reproduce it, so we won't introduce the regression again.\n. A minimal test setup would be more helpful. After 5 minutes I'm still cloning the repo... ^^\n. I've checked it on my virtual machine. Your example passes the sass-loader without error, but the css file is imported with an absolute path. This behavior is not intended (see #138).\nHowever, it should be no problem for the css-loader, but it seems like the css-loader is not able to recognize absolute Windows paths @sokra.\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Thx for the feedback. I've found the problem and I'm working on it...\n. Sorry, I didn't see the PR :(\nIt's already fixed in the master branch: https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/commit/3ae649b05dfbee2ca7d9d56cb8c130c1214d6196\n. Thx @jorrit. :+1: \nI've refactored the whole import stuff and tested it on windows, it works.\n. Does webpack recompile anything if you change a file? It could be that just HMR is not working.\nI don't know about a watcher bug... what is your OS? Are any Symlinks involved (like via npm link or bower link?\n. Is that a duplicate of #102?\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. I have added a chapter to the README about url():\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#problems-with-url\nIt's way more complicated than in LESS which provides a mechanism that rewrites urls...\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. Nice! :+1:\nThx @jorrit \n. This is not an issue specific to the sass-loader so I'll close it. @tappleby thanks for providing an example setup.. Thx for your effort @endaaman. :+1: \nThe current master branch should fix your problem. However, I've used another approach because your PR adds files as dependency that might not exist anymore. This might be no problem, but I don't think that it's good coding style (no offence). But your PR was inspiration for the current solution :grinning:.\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Thx. That's what I wanted to hear :+1: :grinning:.\n. Shipped with 2.0.0\n. Thx for your effort :+1: \nI've added it manually to the master branch because I've refactored it a lot.\n. Could you check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Fixed with 2.0.0\n. There are tests for the indented syntax, so I expect it to work. Please provide a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.\n. Could you give me an example where the problem occurs? The paths are already normalized afaik.\n. Shipped with 2.0.1. Thanks! :+1: \n. Nice :grinning: \n. I did just skim through your source code and it looks good! :+1: You did even use urlToRequest(). Would you mind sending me a PR with the updated README? I would be happy to mention your loader.\nI was just wondering if this behavior could/should be part of the css-loader when source maps are present. In this case we could avoid parsing the CSS twice.\n. This is a problem of Sass in general afaik (see here and here). Could you check if the problem is also present when you're using node-sass directly? If that's the case, this is the probably the wrong repo for that issue.\n. There are helper mixins like sass-import-once which prevents double imports. However, this requires you to wrap your whole code with curly braces and to find a unique id for your module (usually the file path within the project). Personally, I find that too annoying.\nAfter fiddling around with double imports I found out that it's not actually a big problem. Gziping your static assets eliminates code duplication very efficiently. You can try that out for your specific case by creating two versions: one with sass-import-once and a gzipped one. Sure, in the final result, the gzipped version contains duplicated style rules. However, I bet the performance penalty would still not be measurable.\n\nbut I had thought the sass-loader was intercepting @import statements in Sass and could do something clever.\n\nYes, that would be possible and I'm actually planing to do something. However, rubysass is going to ship this with 4.0.0 and libsass will probably also follow. So I was hoping this would already be resolved by now :grin:.\nIf you are open to ditch Sass, I can also recommend LESS. I know, there are endless debates about Sass vs. LESS and in the end they are always pointless. However, there are two things LESS is actually handling better:\n- It's possible to import other files without including the actual CSS via @import (reference)\n- It's possible to rewrite url() statements thus enabling modules to just use the actual file path of an image or font without using some helper variable like $font-path.\nAnd in the end, Sass and LESS are very familiar. Actually, I'm using both in different projects and it's not a big deal.\n. Thx for sharing @kenotron :+1: \n. @MatthewKosloski this issue is not about the ordering of rules, please don't change the topic. I assume that you are using the extract-text-webpack-plugin. In this case, the order of rules dependents on the order of require() calls inside your bundle. Follow-up discussion at: https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues/200#issuecomment-251261145\n. Related performance discussion: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296#issuecomment-288464857. Why do you prepend . before button? Just write @import 'button'  or @import '_button.scss'\n. Mhmm the latest should be fine. Can anyone confirm this?\n. @jcreamer898 you should not need to adjust process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE. The sass-loader is queuing its tasks so that node-sass is not blocking all threads (until node-sass has resolved this).\n. Anyone still having problems?\n. Could you guys check if the branch fix/threadpool-issue fixes this problem while using the default process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE?\n. That's nice :+1: \nCould anyone reading this issue also check out the branch? I would like to pull it on the master, but I don't have a test setup that demonstrates the problem.\n. Yep, I've messed up this release by forgetting to move object-assign from devDependencies to dependencies. Just to test it you need to install object-assign manually.\nThx for trying it out :+1: \n. @lencioni your assumptions are right. Everything starting with ~ should be read from your modulesDirectories, usually node_modules.\nHowever, if you just write\njavascript\n@import '~config';\nwebpack will read config's package.json to get the main entry point which is usually a JS-file. Have you tried importing specific stuff by writing\njavascript\n@import '~config/variables.scss';\n?\nThere are tests for importing modules from paths starting with ~ which TravisCI also executes on Linux @mako-taco.\nCould you come up with a small test repository which demonstrates the actual problem?\n. @ceram1 Yep, I'm sorry. I was wrong. Travis CI is not activated because I'm not the owner of the repo. I use it in all my projects.\nConcerning your feedback:\n'node_modules/react-toolbox/lib/_colors' is another file than '~react-toolbox/lib/commons' :grin:. I'm pretty sure that this error is somehow related to your specific setup.\n. Could you provide an example?\n. resolve.modulesDirectories should only contain folder names, no actual paths. Webpack applies node's resolving algorithm with these folder names. It walks up the directories and tries each folder name:\na/b/node_modules\na/node_modules\nnode_modules\nWhat you probably want is resolve.root (which takes absolute paths!).\nBtw: That's why bower_components should be listed as resolve.root instead of modulesDirectories\nPlease set up a small example repo (using resolve.root) which demonstrates the problem. It makes debugging at lot of easier for me and it may help you pinning down the problem, if it's in your configuration.\n. You're welcome :grin: \n. The weird paths are created by the css-loader. Take a look at my PR for further information.\n. https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/pull/154\n. @jezstephens \n\nIt screws up the line numbers in Webpack's error messages by inserting additional lines into the input.\n\nThis should be reported to the import-glob-loader\n\nWhen used with no file extension it includes all files, so if you have Sass files mixed with other non-CSS files it's necessary to say foo//*.scss. This could be argued as a good thing, but I think it'd be more intuitive if foo//* was equivalent to foo/*/.scss\n\nYes, I think, it is a good thing to add the file extension explicitly.\n\nSo perhaps sass-loader could support Sass-specific globbing a bit better than import-glob-loader.\n\nI think the import-glob-loader is doing a pretty decent job here. I don't want to add this feature to the sass-loader because the import mechanism is already pretty complicated. Once we started to implement it here, we are responsible to maintain that feature.\n. I had this issue several times (webpack/less-loader#40 peerigon/markdown-loader#8). While passing the options via query parameters is cumbersome, I don't think that it would be a good idea to pass-in all options via the webpack config. It seems straight-forward, but the full module path + query string is used as cache id afaik. Hence, two require calls with different loader configs are recognized to be different.\nWhat do you think about it @sokra?\n. @sanniassin anyway, thx for your PR. I'm willing to merge this, but could you also add tests please?\n. Nevermind... I'll do it, because we need a better setup for these kind of tests.\n. @dtothefp It is necessary for options that can not be stringified using JSON.stringify\n. Shipped with 3.1.0. New preferred way for passing options is now via a property on your webpack config. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#sass-options\n. Thank you.\nThe last paragraph is implied by using the extract-text-webpack-plugin, so I'll remove it.\n. Sass is not downloading files afaik. So when you import an http url you won't be able to extend classes that are defined in these remote files. These imports will be resolved on runtime inside the browser.\n. Yep, #152 solves it. I just merged the PR, but we need tests :grinning:.\n. #152 shipped with 3.1.0. New preferred way for passing options is now via a property on your webpack config. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#sass-options\n. @kgwinnup Your webpack.config has a dependency which depends on a scss file.\n@typpo Thanks for pointing that out. Probably a common problem when creating isomorphic/universaljs apps.\n. Makes sense. Thx for pointing it out!\n. Will be shipped with #152, I just need to write tests for it.\n. Webpack puts all required files into one big js file by default. If you want to load code (like styles) on demand, you need to create a code split point by using an async require (will be System.import in Webpack 2).\nThis issue is not a sass-loader thing, though. \n. I'm using node 4.1 on OSX and could not observe these kind of errors. Could you provide a minimal test setup that reproduces the error? Otherwise I doubt that this repository is the right location for this issue.\n. Closing this for now because there is no example and it's probably not the right repository.\n. Do you have node-sass as dependency of your project? Since npm@3, peerDependencies won't be installed automatically anymore.\n. Thx for sharing this!\n. Mhmm you should be \"allowed\" to install that beta... is this a npm issue?\n. @Phoenixmatrix Thx for informing me :+1: \n. It's not a bug, @jsg2021 is mostly right. Though webpack is doing the file resolving, the output is kind of monolithic. That means that once Sass is done, webpack just receives one big blob of CSS without any trace of modules.\nSo, there are basically three ways to structure your styles:\n1. Have one monolithic main.scss\nAll the imports are done inside the main.scss.\nPros:\n\nNo code duplication if done right\nYou have complete control about the order how things are initialized\n\nCons:\n\nCan't be separated into vendor chunks or similiar\nNo incremental rebuilds because the whole stylesheet needs to be rebuild just for a single change\n\n2. Have on main.scss and on vendor.scss\nSimiliar to #1 but with manually separating vendor stuff from your application stuff.\nPros:\n\nTwo different chunks that can be cached separately\nYou have still complete control about the order how things are initialized\n\nCons:\n\nRebuilds are a bit faster, but still take some time\nReferencing/importing stuff from vendor styles into main.scss may duplicate code\n\n3. Truely modular styles\nEvery component has its own, independent Sass build. In order to avoid code duplication, you need to separate your Sass modules between modules which produce CSS code and modules which just provide variables and functionality like mixins. But imho that's best practice anyway.\nPros:\n\nFast rebuilds\nStyles are loaded \"on demand\"\n\nCons:\n\nThe initial build takes much longer because each component spawns its own Sass process\nPotential code duplication (which is usually not problem when using gzip)\nUsing the ExtractTextWebpackPlugin is counterproductive\n. That sounds pretty impossible to me. It's also not clear what problem you're trying to solve. Why should it be faster? What is actually slow?\n. > using a single Sass process could theoretically improve that.\n\nYep, but when using a single Sass process, modules would influence each other, yielding to unexpected output.\n. Thx for informing us.\nBut I don't think that we should merge this. It forces all users, who are not using node 4, to update their peerDependency. On the other hand, node 4 users are able to specify node-sass^3.3.3 as dependency and still use the current sass-loader, aren't they?\n. Shipped as breaking change with sass-loader 3.0.0\n. Sorry, specifying node-sass as peerDependency is far more useful for most users.\nSince node-sass/libsass processes your files, you should be able to specify the exact version you need. The sass-loader is just using an API which is not affected by most changes.\nIn other words: Your API surface to node-sass is much bigger than ours. Otherwise we would have tons of issues and PRs like \"Update node-sass to x.y.z plz\"\n. > I'm using npm3 now and it doesn't install node-sass automatically.\nI know and that's good. node-sass should be the dependency of your project.\n\nI could give you a ton of projects that do it.\n\nIt's true, people are handling this differently. And while there are projects where your suggested approach is very reasonable (like for the phantomjs-package for example), I don't think that it fits here.\nThe sass-loader is a link between webpack and node-sass. Following node-sass versions would ignore the fact that we also have to stay up-to-date with webpack: So, which version number should we follow then? Imho, the most robust solution to this problem is to have an own version number and to specify both as peerDependency.\nBut you're right. I forgot to add webpack as peerDependency. :grin: \n. I would love to hear alternatives from @iarna or @othiym23, but I guess there no new insights than already discussed at npm/npm#5080 npm/npm#6565 npm/npm#7495...\n. Thx for reporting this. This is probably caused by the \"funny\" file resolver.\n. Shipped with 3.1.0\n. Self-solving issues are the best :+1: \n. Thx. Since I've also changed the README, I added the change manually.\n. Thx for your PR :+1: \nI'm definitely planing to merge this, but it would be good if we'd follow the official recommendation for programmable objects in query parameters. The sass-loader should not try to require() the file, but just read it from the webpack config.\nThis is also related to #152 \n. Shipped with 3.1.0. New preferred way for passing options is now via a property on your webpack config. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#sass-options\n. Acccording to the node-sass docs, you should return sass.NULL if your custom importer doesn't want to handle the file. This passes the file request on to the next importer in the array.\n. If you don't return sass.NULL in cases you don't want to resolve the file, all webpack specific resolving won't be applied.\n. Could you please create a minimal example that demonstrates the problem? I'm using these comments all the time and there are no problems.\n. I'd appreciate an example :grin:. Furthermore, it's likely not an issue with sass-loader itself, but with node-sass or libsass.\n. We're using these comments in our tests, so it's not a generic issue. Please provide examples.\n. @djfm thanks for informing me\n@geekingfrog @ajsharp does that solve your issue?\n. In your configuration, the postcss-loader is executed before the sass-loader. Maybe PostCSS isn't able to parse SASS? :grin: \n. Ok, I think we can close this one?\n. Header.scss mixes CSS modules and tries to import stuff from Sass. This is not possible. Every import from a CSS file will not be compiled with the webpack loader pipeline. You can only import CSS files. Please stick to Sass or CSS modules. \n. Just put @import 'common/variables' at the beginning of your main.scss and everything should be fine.\nHowever, I don't get why you would like to have implicit imports/globals. Modular,re-usable code declares its dependencies explicitly.\n. Thx for reporting this.\nCould you come up with a minimal test example that reproduces the error?\n. Just remove stuff step by step until it's working again :grin: \n. It looks like GLOBBY.scss is not consumed by the sass-loader. This error happens when webpack tries to parse the file as JavaScript. And $white: \"white\"; is valid JavaScript :grin:\nHave you excluded the sass-loader for GLOBBY.scss?\n. The sass-loader does not resolve url() statements in your styles. You should chain the css-loader as described in the README.\nAlso take a look at the section about url() in the README.\n. I don't know. Why aren't you allowed to use the css-loader with Angular 2?\n. You could try to use the extract-loader, it evaluates a CommonJS module to generate a string. Chain the loaders like this:\n{\n    test: /\\.scss$/,\n    loaders: ['extract-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader']\n  },\n. That sounds like the sass-loader is not applied. The css-loader should not see any Sass imports.\nAlso, the error would be helpful.\n. Thx for sharing.\n. The build time heavily depends on how your styles are structured. I've described three different ways how to structure your styles.\n\nI suspect that this is because I'm using the ExtractTextPlugin\n\nI don't think so. The ExtractTextPlugin just \"extracts\" the CSS from the bundle (which is stored in a JS string). I don't see why that should take so much time.\n\nCan the sass-loader be configured to pre-fetch all scss and compile them async with node-sass while the rest of the compilation is working\n\nThe sass-loader is async, it does not block webpack. However, the sass-loader does not know your scss files until webpack encounters a require() and invokes the sass-loader.\nYou could modify the sass-loader in your project to track when the sass-loader is actually invoked and how much time it spends on waiting for node-sass to compile. Then you could compare these figures against \"vanilla\" node-sass compilations. If they're almost identical, it's node-sass which takes so much time...\n. Thx @Phoenixmatrix for your insights :+1:\nIf the new css-loader is so much slower, it should probably be addressed as issue. Though CSS modules are a nice feature, it should not degrade the performance of those who don't want to use it.\n\nIf you do not need url resolution (common in development)\n\nI don't get that... For me, url resolution is one of the reasons I would like to compile my styles via Webpack. And why would you like to have url resolution in production when you don't use it in development?\n. Closing this in favor of #296 \nI also did some profiling: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296#issuecomment-288464857. Thx for your PR.\nI understand your motivation, but the style- and css-loader are not essential to use the sass-loader. It depends on what you are trying to achieve. It may be perfectly fine for people to use the sass-loader just with the css-loader or even just with the raw-loader.\nSince most people will use it in conjunction with the style- and the css-loader, they are mentioned just a few lines below your changes.\n. I'm sorry. object-assign was in devDependencies :(. Fixed with 3.1.1\n. Thx. It is already shipped with 3.1.1 :grin: \n. Thx for the pull-request. Have you executed the tests after updating it?\nI get \nError: It's not clear which file to import for '@import \"../node_modules/order/1/module\"'.\nCandidates:\n  ../node_modules/order/1/_module.scss\n  ../node_modules/order/1/_module.sass\n  ../node_modules/order/1/_module.css\n  ../node_modules/order/1/module.scss\n  ../node_modules/order/1/module.sass\n  ../node_modules/order/1/module.css\nPlease delete or rename all but one of these files.\nwhich is a good thing, because it seems like they have finally decided to throw an error in these cases.\n. Haha, that's exactly what I did yesterday evening :grinning:.\nAnyway, thx. I'll pull in your commits. But now I need to remove the \"funny resolving algorithm\".\n. Thx @chicoxyzzy. I'll merge it as soon as I've found some time.\n@ChrisCinelli node-sass is a peerDependency. You should be able to bump the version in your project independently (as long as it is not a major version bump). That's why we've made it a peerDependency\n. Shipped with 3.1.2\n. I don't get the question but I doubt that this is actually a bug of sass-loader.\n. > But I noticed bundle files generated (not source map) are larger than bundle files generated without sourceMap like below. (40 to 50 percent larger, 500 KB becomes 900 KB)\nThat is correct, because the source map contains the original source code (stored in the contents property). This is because then you don't need to map source map paths to your file system in your developer tools. They just work.\nIf you do not want to include the original source code (e.g. because you want to use source maps in production), you should disable the sourceMapContents-flag. In this case, the source map will only contain mapping information.\nWe should mention that in the README, though...\n. Starting with sass-loader 3.2.0, you don't need to set it explicitly. It will derive it from the file name.\n. Do you use the .sass file extension? Can you please provide a small test case that demonstrates the problem?. Thx! Shipped with 3.1.2\n. Thank you for your pull-request.\nCould you add a small paragraph to the README describing the feature (e.g. with a use-case)?\n. We could publish sass-loader's internal functions to the context so that you can use the same functions.\n. Mhmm I'm not sure about this feature anymore. It provides access to an API where things might break easily. I don't want to make a major version bump when I'm refactoring internal functions.\n. Thx for pointing out theo. It looks very interesting (although I'm a little disappointed that it's a gulp plugin \u2013 it could also be just a small module without gulp dependency).\nI totally see the benefit. Maybe we could provide the loaderContext to the custom importer, so that you can write your own logic...\n. @mrfr0g thank you for your pull request and sorry for the response time, I haven't found the time to review it yet.\nWhat problem does this PR actually solve? I think it's a good thing to declare dependencies explicitly. We had global variables in the browser for a long time and I don't want to go back to this anymore. I think that a component should be truly self-contained. It should not expect global variables to be defined.\n. > I believe that I can accomplish the same result using the data option resolved in #216, or as @jsg2021 suggested, the baggage loader.\nAwesome :+1:  :grinning: \n. Why are absolute paths in source maps useful?\n. Thx for your pull-request.\nHowever, I don't understand why this is necessary. We already have a test case which covers this use-case. Why doesn't it work for you?\nCould you add a test that demonstrates the problem?\n. Any progress on this?\n. @jerrysu is module a dependency that is referenced in your package.json? See also https://github.com/nightgrey/web-boilerplate/pull/1\n. What is a pancake in this context? :grin:\n. Since it's unclear what this actually about, I'll close it for now. Could you create a small example project the demonstrates the problem? I assume that this is not related to the sass-loader, so it would be good to start with vanilla CSS.\n. Thx :+1: \n. Seems reasonable, thx :+1: \n. Shipped with v3.2.0\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. Thx for sharing this @timaschew \n. Seems to be a hot topic #215 #195 :grinning: \nAnyway, thx! :+1: \n. Thx for sharing\n. This seems like a limitation of node-sass. We're using node-sass' data option to pass Sass source code to node-sass. In this case, node-sass flags the data as stdin.\nWe would need to create a temporary file which we pass to node-sass. But this seems like an unnecessary detour to me.\n. Yes :grin: \nThat won't work, because the loader's test regex matches only scss-files. Why do you want to include that option in the README anyway? It's described in node-sass's readme.\n. Ok, now I do understand you.\nI used to have a small chapter about .sass-files, but then I read somewhere that it is deprecated (which is actually not true). I will re-add that small chapter.\nHowever, I encourage you to learn more about node-sass and the underlying dependencies of all webpack loaders. Because loaders are often just connectors between webpack and another tool. So it's not sufficient to just understand the loader.\nOne thing, for instance, what people need to know is that node-sass is build on libsass, which is a C-port of the famous ruby library. It is not actually Rubysass. However, it tries to stick to it as close as possible.\n. I think, #196 solves this \"issue\" as well\n. Seems like you have css module inside your node_modules. In this case, you should not use the convenient way of just writing loaders: [\"style\", \"css\", \"sass\"] because in this case, webpack first tries to resolve style, css, sass inside node_modules. After that, it appends the -loader postfix. So in your case, it tries to use the css module as css-loader.\nI think it's best practice to always write the full name, like style-loader, css-loader, sass-loader\n. Sorry, for me it's not clear what you are trying to achieve... why should the sass-loader also output sass code?\n. I think, the multi-loader was the missing piece :)\n. Please provide a small example project to demonstrate the issue. You can just commit the node_modules folder to simulate different packages.\n. @stigmat4j What language is this? Is :local legal in Sass?\n@storrdev @rickhanlonii @bipinshashi Looks like you were trying to import stylesheets in node. Maybe you're writing an isomorphic app? I would recommend to compile your node app with webpack too (using the node target option)\n. There are a lot of features from node-sass/libsass that one should take a look at. We just pipe all the options through, so I only added notes on options that might be webpack specific. If you feel like this is important, please create a PR.\n. > The child partial here would be able to access any variables exposed by the config file, but in sass-loader land, each stylesheet is treated as its own entity, meaning you can't do a global import.\nThis is not true. You can do global imports just like in regular sass. Please provide a minimal test example if you think this is a bug.\n. Yep.\nHowever, I don't recommend this kind of project structure. In my experience, explicit dependencies are always better than implicit ones.\n. > but its also silly to repeat yourself in every file of your project\nI don't think so. We all agreed that it's not good to use globals in JavaScript, why don't we adhere to the same principle in our stylesheets? It's a good thing to be explicit about the dependencies you are using. This way you always only import stuff that you are actual using.\n. > As far as the discussion above about importing variables or mixins into every file, I'm finding that if I import a sass file in three different sass modules, webpack is bundling three copies of that imported file. Importing modules in this manner appears to me to be pretty detrimental.\nThat's how Sass works by design. It's a compiler and every module is a distinct compilation. Usually, I split up my Sass modules in modules that are like libraries (they don't produce CSS code when imported) and modules that are like entry files. These are the Sass files that actually produce CSS code.. Thx for also writing down the solution for your case. I don't think that we should add a note on isomorphic apps since this is not related to the sass-loader at all.\n. The sass-loader works with webpack 2. I've added it to peerDepedencies starting with 3.2.1.\n. Thx :+1: \n. Sounds good :+1:\n@mrfr0g: Is this a solution for #191?\n. Shipped with v3.2.0\n. My advice:\nSeparate your Sass files into library files and application files. This means that you have Sass files that will output CSS (your application files) and you have Sass files that provide variables and mixins for them, but don't produce any output. Then you write your application files in a modular way without implicit dependencies, but explicit ones which means that you can compile any application file and it will work without producing duplicate CSS.. Using webpack 1: If you add the UglifyJsPlugin to your webpack config, it will switch all loaders into minimize mode.\nUsing webpack 2: Now you are able to switch only specific loaders into minimize mode by using the LoaderOptionsPlugin.\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/283\n. @janjon @elektronik2k5 Please don't use the modules_directories option for this. resolve.root is better for this purpose. module_directories will traverse all folders up to / similar like node does with node_modules.\n. This sounds like an issue in node-sass. We just get the complete source map from node-sass.\n. Does this PR fix your problem (install sass-loader 3.2.2)?\n. Should be fixed with #374. I know that the paths inside the source-map may be broken depending on your setup. Haven't found the time to look into it so far.\nHowever, I've merged a PR which resolved some issues with it. Maybe you could try sass-loader 3.2.2 and check if the problem is still there.\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. I think it makes sense to add the node_modules folder to node-sass' includePath option. After that, this code should work.\n. Thx for pointing out :+1: \n. There is no hint that this is related to the sass-loader at all. Try to isolate it and create a small example project. This makes debugging a lot easier. I don't know react-simpletabs so I can't help you here.\n. What about writing a custom importer?\n. Sorry, but we won't implement this as the resolution logic is already complicated and slow enough. See also #307 . Shipped with 3.2.1\n. Thx. Shipped with 3.2.1\n. That looks like a good idea! Can you create a PR + a small test-case for it? Just mention me in my PR and I will merge it asap.\n. Node-sass is a peer dependency. You should be able to specify any version in the range of ^3.4.2, so I don't really see the point in merging this.\nAnyway, I've updated the dev dependencies to the latest node-sass (3.8.0) and everything's working :+1: \n.

Thx! :+1: \nI probably need to change this again because a loader should not access webpack options\n. Shipped as 3.2.2\n. Ok, I'll flag this version as broken, publish a new major release and then we can sort it out. No stress! \ud83d\udc4d \n@bholloway would you be open to make a PR to the sass-loader so that we have tests to check against the resolve-url-loader? Seems like more people are using it, so it would be nice to ensure compatibility. It was not obvious for me that this could be breaking change at all. If you do the PR, please mention me so I can merge it asap.\n. Shipped as 4.0.0\n. I've already published 3.2.3 which is identical to 3.2.1.\n. Thx. Shipped as #233 with 3.2.1\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. Yes, this was an unintentional breaking change with 3.2.2 (see #250). I've deprecated this version and published this change with 4.0.0.\n@bholloway and I will sort it out, but he is currently on vacation, so that may take a while.\n. That's correct, 3.2.2 and 4.0.0 contain the breaking commit. However, 3.2.2 was deprecated so I would expect that npm won't install it when specifying ^3.2.0 (but I don't know that for sure).\n. @judewang thanks for pointing out.\nNow I've published sass-loader@3.2.3 which is identical to 3.2.1. However, when you run npm i sass-loader, you will get 4.0.0 because it's still tagged as latest.\n. npm unpublish does only work if there are no dependent packages. Furthermore, if people happened to install 3.2.2 with --save-dev, it won't be available anymore. So, this was most unobtrusive way imho.\n. I agree, but unpublish would have been too late for you anyway. So I think the current solution is the best in all cases.\n. When using the query syntax, you must stick to regular URL escaping. So the official way would be:\njavascript\n`sass-loader?includePaths[]=${encodeURIComponent(path.resolve(__dirname, './styles'))}`\nSince this is stupid I always recommend to use JSON.stringify()\njavascript\n`sass-loader?${JSON.stringify({\n    compressed: true\n    includePaths: [ ... ]\n})}`\nWe know that configuring loaders is very complicated \ud83d\ude1e . We're currently working on that.\n. scss\n@import \"./other/file.scss\";\n. Please don't file an issue for this kind of questions. Github issues are used to track bugs. If you need advice, please ask a question on stack overflow.\n. You can also take a look at our tests. We have a lot of tests that check if importing files is working correctly.\n. I doubt that this is an issue of the sass-loader. Do you have a stack trace or anything? We also need a minimal example that demonstrates the error.\n. Thx for the PR. I currently have not sufficient rights to activate travis CI for this repo, but I've written @jtangelder a message.\n. I think @jtangelder 's PR is sufficient for us. Thx anyway @amilajack \ud83d\udc4d \n. This sounds very complicated and I don't think that it should be that way. My advice:\n- Don't serve your HTML over file://. There are a lot of cases where things behave differently and you will run in more issues than this. Do yourself a favor and serve your stuff over an HTTP server.\n- If you can't serve your stuff over HTTP by all means, you should not use the webpack-dev-server for development. Your development environment should be as close as possible to the production environment and file:// vs http:// is a huge difference.\n- If you really really need to use the file:// protocol: Why are you using webpack? Just split your stuff and put it somewhere on the disk. Webpack is a bundler and bundler put a lot of stuff into a few files to serve it efficiently over HTTP. If you don't have a roundtrip, I doubt that you need webpack at all.\n- My last advice: Maybe the <base> tag can help you.\n. Please file a question on stack overflow and include some example code. This way other developers may profit from the answer and we're actually able to answer it. There could be hundred of causes for this kind of error.\n. But I'm pretty sure that inside your folder C:\\Users\\che\nnhao\\Desktop\\code\\mean\\src there is no css/master.scss \ud83d\ude09 \n. Funnily, I've dealed with the same problem yesterday and that's how I tackled it. First you need a export-once function:\n``` sass\n$export-once-names: ();\n@function export-once($name) {\n    @if index($export-once-names, $name) {\n        @return false;\n    }\n    $export-once-names: append($export-once-names, $name) !global;\n    @return true;\n}\n```\nYou should use that function for all sass code that actually outputs CSS to ensure that no duplicates are added to the final stylesheet.\nThan you have a mixin to create the font-face declaration. I've removed some code that might be implementation dependent:\n``` sass\n@mixin font-face($family, $weight: regular, $style: normal, $stretch: normal) {\n@if export-once(\"font-face-#{$family}-#{$weight}-#{$style}-#{$stretch}\") {\n    // make sure the declarations will not be nested\n    @at-root {\n        @font-face {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nThen you have a mixin which applies a font-family and all its respective values to an element\n``` sass\n@mixin font-helvetica() {\n    @include font-face(\"Helvetica Neue\");\nfont-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\nfont-weight: regular;\nfont-style: normal;\nfont-stretch: normal;\n\n}\n@mixin font-helvetica-bold() {\n    @include font-face(\"Helvetica Neue\", $weight: bold);\nfont-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\nfont-weight: bold;\nfont-style: normal;\nfont-stretch: normal;\n\n}\n```\nNow everytime you want to use a font, you just have to include the given mixin and it will add the font-face declaration once to the stylesheet. This way you never include fonts that you don't use.\n. Sorry, I don't know. The sass-loader repository is definitely not the right place to discuss these things. But guessing from @xzyfer I think you do need to upgrade to 3.8 (which was never a problem in my projects).\n. It would be very helpful if you could setup a small example project which I can clone and run. Your description is still a bit vague.\n. Please provide a minimal test that demonstrates the problem. I'm using the webpack-dev-server in my setup and everything is working as expected.\n. Thx for your PR. I'm currently on vacation, so please be patient. I'll take a look in the end of August :)\n\nAm 11.08.2016 um 00:13 schrieb Chris Fitzgerald notifications@github.com:\n@jhnns, this should fix custom sass importers by passing resourcePath instead of stdin into the prev argument.\nFixes #234\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/267\nCommit Summary\nUse resoucePath for custom importers\nFile Changes\nM index.js (8)\nM test/tools/customImporter.js (3)\nPatch Links:\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/267.patch\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/267.diff\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

Please provide a minimal test repository that demonstrates the problem so I can check that out. Try to remove as much stuff as possible since it helps tracking down the problem.. Is this problem still present with node-sass 4?. Since I can't reproduce it in our tests and it does not occur in my projects, I'll close it for now.. CSS source maps can only work if every loader in the loader chain passes them through. That's necessary because webpack, only supports JS source maps out of the box.\n\n@woohling Do you experience the same issue when you use this loader chain:\nstyle-loader?sourceMap!css-loader?sourceMap!sass?sourceMap&outputStyle=expanded&sourceMapContents=true'\n? . I can confirm the problem. You can test that with https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/374/commits/ce198d169d4a1066d214d40ba88fb0b5029c0536 and npm run test-source-map.\nUnfortunately, I don't know how to fix this since we don't actually mess with the source maps.. We receive the source maps directly from node-sass. But since the source maps are also processed by the css-loader and other loaders on the way, it's hard to say what's going on. Maybe they are incompatible?\nIt would be good if you could investigate this. Build the smallest project possible that reproduces the error and inspect the source maps in the sass-loader and then in the css-loader. You can use the style-loader to apply the styles to the DOM. The style-loader uses a BLOB url to make the source maps available to the browser. It does not change the source maps anymore, so that should be fine.. Thx for pointing it out. I took the essential parts and created a new PR #281\n. The segmentation fault is because one of the assertions inside the custom importer did not work. Unfortunately, node-sass is not reporting these errors to node.\n. Thx for your contribution.\nThe style-loader was never part of webpack core and is not required to use this library. You could also import the CSS as JS string and do something else with it. Especially when using the sass-loader in conjunction with the extract-text-webpack-plugin, the style-loader must not be in your loader chain.\n. The LoaderOptionsPlugin can be used to override the webpack options that can be accessed inside the loader via this.options. If you do that, you need to provide all the information the loader is reading from this object.\nUsually, you don't need to do that. It is just for compatibility reasons to give you the full control. In all regular cases, you can just use loader options (they are also called loader queries) in your loader configuration. The loader will read these options from this.query (unfortunate naming).. @vteivans as previously pointed out: If you're using the LoaderOptionsPlugin you also need to specify a context:\njs\n    new LoaderOptionsPlugin({\n       context: config.context\n    })\nBut you should not need the LoaderOptionsPlugin.. Sorry, this issue is too vague. There are a lot of tests that demonstrate that imports are handled correctly.. Thanks for the PR, but I'll try to get rid of context entirely. See #313 . When you write\n@import '~@technologyadvice/radiant';\nwebpack will search at ./node_modules/@technologyadvice/radiant for the module \u2013 exactly like dependencies in node are resolved. What were you expecting?\n. What does the main field of the radiant's package.json say?\n. I assume that this is a webpack problem because the sass-loader is not resolving it. Could you create a minimal example that reproduces the error? Just commit a small example node_modules folder with the folder structure. Try to remove as much as possible.. This has nothing to do with the sass-loader\n. Related to: #307 . Based on this discussion, I started profiling an example project yesterday and had some interesting insights. First of all, the sass-loader performance (49.2s) is completely unacceptable compared to fast-sass-loader (5.29s) or even bare node-sass (2.25s) from the command line. All three toolchains compile the same source code and produce similar output. We can expect some overhead coming from webpack since we need to initialize it, set up the loader pipeline, etc., but even the fast-sass-loader is unacceptable slow compared to bare node-sass in my opinion.\nOverview\nSo let's take a look at the flame graphs:\n\nFirst of all, as you can see, node-sass is spending most of the time outside of Node.js which is what we expected, since the hard work is done by Libsass.\nNow, let's take a look at both sass-loaders. The execution can roughly be divided into five phases (indicated as black boxes in the graph) that I will discuss in detail later:\n\nwebpack initialization\nfirst execution sass-loader\nfirst execution css-loader\nsecond execution sass-loader (this block is not visible in the fast-sass-loader graph, reasons below)\nsecond execution css-loader\n\nSo, the first surprise here is that we have two separate compilations going on. This is due to the extract-text-webpack-plugin which initiates a child compilation. Tbh, I'm not sure why this is necessary at all. @sokra can give us more insights here.\nThe second surprise is, that the second compilation doesn't use the cache from the first compilation. In the sass-loader graph, you can clearly see that the second pass takes almost exactly the same amount of time. This could be improved a little bit because the sass-loader is currently not using webpack's fs cache, but that would only reduce the second sass-loader execution time (4.), which is not where most of the time is spent.\nThe most time, however, is spent\u2014and that's the third surprise\u2014inside the css-loader. You can clearly see that in both graphs. It takes up half of the total time in the fast-sass-loader setup, and even more in the sass-loader setup.\nIt might also be surprising that node-sass and webpack + fast-sass-loader take almost the same amount of time to compile. In the flame graphs, you can clearly see that node-sass finishes almost at the same time where the 2. block of the fast-sass-loader graph ends. However, we need to remember that the fast-sass-loader is deduping all files before compilation, so there's far less to compile.\n\nNow, let's take a look at all the phases in detail.\nPhase 1: Webpack initialization & loader execution start\n\nNo big surprise here: The initialization of both setups takes almost the same amount of time. Differences here are probably due to I/O or general OS flakyness because there is no actual difference between both loaders here.\nYou can clearly see that during the first 1000ms, most of the time is spent requiring modules. That's why webpack almost always takes at least 1s to compile\u2014even with the simplest setup. Maybe we could win something here with lazy requiring ala lazy-req.\nPhase 2: Import resolving & sass compilation (1. compilation)\n\nNow that looks different!\nFirst, let's look at the sass-loader: The sass-loader registers a custom importer and kicks off the compilation. Now, we're essentially waiting for Libsass to call back. You can clearly see that there is a lot of back-and-forth going on with recurring breaks (grey bars) where the process is just sitting and waiting for Libsass. This graph led me to the assumption that Libsass might be doing sequential I/O. Concurrent I/O would look different, I suppose. After all the resolving is done, Libsass is performing the actual compilation and we're just waiting for Libsass to call back. Nothing to optimize here.\nNow, let's look at the fast-sass-loader: The fast-sass-loader preparses the source code with regexps for import statements and passes all imports to webpack's resolver. After the import paths have been resolved, the imported files are read from disk via node's fs module and then replaced with their import statements. Duplicated imports are simply omitted, only the first occurence gets included. This is way faster than the sass-loader, which shows that webpack's resolver is not the bottleneck. In fact, it's really fast and almost negligible in the graph.\nThe actual Sass compilation is also a lot faster since a lot of imports have been deduped. It's just that Libsass has less to parse.\nPhase 3: css-loader (1. compilation)\n\nThis phase is the most interesting one because:\n\nit takes up most of the time\nthere is nothing the sass-loader or the fast-sass-loader can do\n\nThe only difference is that the amount of data is very different. The fast-sass-loader produces a string with length 627067, the sass-loader with 6914854. This is 11 times longer. And this translates roughly to the amount of time. The css-loader takes 11 times longer processing the output from the sass-loader.\nThere are two things that I found surprising:\n\n\nWhy does the css-loader take so long? In this case, it is only required to translate the CSS into a CommonJS module while transforming all url() statements and remaining @import into require(). To me, this task seems a lot more trivial than the Sass compilation. The funny thing is: We're spending 9.6s just inside postcss-modules-local-by-default during the first compilation. In total, we're spending 16.29s there \u2013 and we didn't even ask for CSS modules... And that's just the first postcss plugin. The thread is completely busy for 13s in the first compilation while processing postcss plugins without any chance for other tasks. In total: 26s just inside postcss, hogging the CPU.\n\n\nWhy is postcss busy with generating source maps? We didn't ask for source maps... then I took a look at the css-loader: This call applies the map option irregardless of an inputMap. In fact, inputMap is undefined in this case, but we're still telling postcss to generate a map. As an experiment, I set map: false and was able to shave off 10s in total\u2014just by setting one flag. It's still crazy that source maps take up 10s. Switching source maps on and off with node-sass makes a difference of 150ms.\n\n\nPhase 4: sass-loader & css-loader (2. compilation)\n\nThe sass-loader performs exactly the same compilation again. No results from the first compilation are re-used.\nThe fast-sass-loader skips the second Sass compilation because it uses its own cache. That's a nice shortcut, but this should be fixed in webpack.\nI don't understand why we need a second compilation. And if we need the second one, can't we just skip the first one? This seems redundant.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe spend 1s just requiring webpack modules and loaders and initializing the loader pipeline. This could possibly be improved with a tool like lazy-req.\nThe sass-loader could be improved by:\npreparsing and resolving all dependencies. While this might seem like a good idea, there are also problems: 1. The source maps will be incorrect. 2. Errors won't be reported at the correct location. It all boils down to the fact that Libsass doesn't know the original location of the source anymore.\nusing the webpack cache when resolving the file. A custom importer is also allowed to pass the actual source to Libsass. This way, we could use webpack's internal fs caching layer.\ndeduping dependencies. This could be achieved by passing an empty string if the custom importer has resolved a resource for the second time. While this operation is not entirely safe, it will most likely do more good than bad in most cases. I'd say: if the specificity relies on the correct source order, there's a bigger problem.\n\n\nThe css-loader could be improved by:\nusing a simpler pipeline for CSS files that are not CSS modules. This performance penalty is not acceptable.\nonly generating source maps when they are actually requested\n\"somehow\" improving the postcss pipeline. Blocking the process for 13s is not acceptable, even for CSS modules. I don't know how we can improve that. Maybe postcss is applying the plugins in an unfortunate way?\n\n\nThe extract-text-webpack-plugin could be improved by:\ngetting rid of the second compilation\nor using cached loader results where possible\n\n\n\nHere are both CPU profiles. Load them into your Chrome Developer Tools if you want to take a look for yourself.\ncpuprofiles.zip\n\nThis was bothering me for a long time because I think we can do a lot better than that :grin:. As comparison, the sass-loader setup with css-loader@0.14 takes 10.1s and looks like this:\n\nsass-loader-old-css-loader.cpuprofile.zip\n. As @sokra pointed out: With the allChunks: true option...\njs\n    new ExtractTextPlugin({\n      filename: '[name].css',\n      allChunks: true\n    })\nthe second compilation can be skipped:\n\nthus reducing the built time to 23.9s\n. Run\nbash\nnode --inspect-brk ./node_modules/.bin/webpack\nto start the debugging process. The process will halt at the first line and print a debugger URL. Copy the debugger URL into the Chrome Browser and the developers tools will initialize.\nThen go to the JavaScript profiler tab and start profiling :)\nAfter you've pressed stop, the flame graph will be generated.\nIf you don't want to copy debugger URLs around, you can also use the NIM chrome extension. It discovers debuggable node processes automatically.. Not directly related to this thread, but also interesting: Looks like the most recent v8 version (with their new optimizing compiler TurboFan) gives a startup performance boost of 160% (1150ms vs 720ms).\nUsing v8/node, phase 1 looks like this:\n\nThe overall build time decreased from 49.2s to 41.35s (~119% faster).\nTurboFan doesn't bail out on try/catch which will probably improve the startup performance of all node applications because node is using try/catch to initialize the modules.. Afaik python is still a dependency of Node.js' gyp. Why should we get rid of it?\nYou could create a PR for that and make some performance tests.\n. You don't need the LoaderOptionsPlugin with sass-loader 5.0.0 anymore. All options can be passed as object with the options property (see README).\nWe still do access the webpack options object to read the context. This will not be possible with webpack 3 anymore. But since there isn't a good alternative yet, we still need to do that. This is an ongoing discussion but shouldn't concern you. :). js\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    module: {\n        rules: [{\n            test: /\\.scss$/,\n            use: [{\n                loader: \"style-loader\"\n            }, {\n                loader: \"css-loader\"\n            }, {\n                loader: \"sass-loader\",\n                options: { // <--- these options\n                    includePaths: [\"absolute/path/a\", \"absolute/path/b\"]\n                }\n            }]\n        }]\n    }\n};. No. LoaderOptionsPlugincan be used to mock/replace the webpack options that can be accessed inside the loader via this.options. With sass-loader, you don't need to do that. This was designed to be compatible with webpack 1 loaders.\nJust pass your options where you configure your loader (like in the example above). LoaderOptionsPlugin.output.path is the output.path from the webpack options. It has nothing to do with the sass-loader.. Sorry, I don't understand this. Why can't people use node > 6.5 with the sass-loader? In fact, I'm using node 7.1.0 and everything is working fine (I've also tested it with node 6.9.0).\nBesides that: Changing the peerDependencies is an unnecessary breaking change imho.\n. Haha, they're not typos. It's German grammar applied on English :)\nAnyway, thx \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for contributing \ud83d\udc4d \nHowever, I won't merge this change because it adds code to our code base that is not useful for every user. This should be provided by separate library. This way, our users are free to add these custom functions \u2013 or not.\nYou could publish this library for useful custom functions, write a good README about it and I can put a link to it in our README. You could also advertise this at the node-sass repository, because these functions are not restricted to webpack at all.. Thx for your feedback @anchann \nI'm considering this change, although I don't think it's right to pull this in. We should rather try to tackle the perf issues.\nUnfortunately, I can confirm that a lot of time can be spend on resolving. I've published a resolve-perf-tests that uses process.hrtime() and console.log()s to get some numbers and it seems like the sass-loader is spending 35% up to 73% of the time just to resolve files. This is unacceptable and should be solved at webpack level. However, I tried to reproduce these numbers in a bigger project and I couldn't. So, that remains a little vague. Maybe it's related to sass' complicated resolving algorithm involving underscore file names (_blahblah)\n240 seconds to 3 seconds are extreme numbers. Can you give me some hints on your directory structure and how you import stuff?. > takes forever, no output to shed light onto what's happening, yet calling tsc on the command line builds the project in seconds. I'd love to be proven wrong, but until then, logging my findings for the next dev is the best I can hope for :)\nWe already heard of builds taking minutes to finish. Unfortunately, we don't have complex example projects to replicate these issues. My projects usually finish after max. 20 seconds in production mode, but they're medium sized.\n\nwebpack's resolution seems to add nothing in terms of functionality, though perhaps it does add something in terms of uniformity (that said, uniform opaqueness is not necessarily a good thing)\n\nSince webpack provides its own resolving algorithm, I felt that it would be consistent for the developer to configure all resolving stuff in your webpack.config. It's true that this uniformity is not acceptable at the current performance cost, so I understand your argument here.\n\nAlso, importers are labelled as experimental in node-sass' documentation. Would it not make sense to make the use of an experimental feature optional, specifically because the upstream library labels it as a \"use with caution\" feature? I would personally go as far as making it disabled by default, and only enabled when a user knows that they explicitly want the feature.\n\nOur importer is well-tested and works without errors, so I don't see the need to declare this as an experimental thing.\n\nI don't think that's the case \u2014 disabling the webpack importer leaves sass' native underscore resolution intact, does it not?\n\nOnce we use our own importer, sass' native importing algorithm is not available. That's why we have to replicate it (and it's unnecessary complex \ud83d\ude22)\n\nOr, if it's easier for you, you can give me a custom version of sass-loader with whatever instrumentation you want, and I'll send you the output data.\n\nCould you use the sass-loader from the resolve-perf-tests branch and tell me the last output (it's accumulating all numbers)?. Could you check if the import is still slow when you change UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE to a big number (like 200)?\nJust set the environment variable before calling webpack.. Thx for your efforts. This helps me a lot! \ud83d\udc4d \n\nTo be honest, I didn't even want to do this test when I saw the variable name, since it sounded like a poor quality sledgehammer approach to the problem.\n\nNo worries! This won't be the final solution. I just wanted to check if it might be a problem that node-sass eats up almost all available threads for file IO. There was a problem in libsass that caused a deadlock (#100 #147) which was the reason why we had to use async's job queue. This way, node-sass still leaves one thread available for node.js \u2013\u00a0which is also the only thread for webpack's file IO. Thus webpack can only resolve files sequentially. And I think your numbers confirm my assumption. For instance, take a look at RaisedButton.scss. In your original setup, it only takes 200ms. But with all the file IO going on it is delayed up to 9000ms.\n\nI still firmly believe that even if resolving the problem internally inside webpack is the philosophically correct thing to do, given that lib-sass has a working solution to accommodate aliasing via import paths, sass-loader should provide its users with an escape hatch in case they want one.\n\nwebpack's resolving engine is more powerful than node-sass' includePaths. For instance, you can also alias paths (you can't do that with node-sass). And hopefully with webpack 2 you will also be able to @import JS files in order to translate JS variables into Sass variables. But I agree that for most use-cases, node-sass' includePaths is totally sufficient.\nMy current approach is:\n\nTry to understand why we are currently slower\nTry to find a simple solution to make webpack almost as fast as node-sass. It will always be a little bit slower because there is more going on behind the scenes. But it should not make a big difference\nIf I can find a simple and fast solution, I will provide a flag to disable webpack's resolving engine. I don't want to add too much options because it makes everything more complicated. But if we can't make sass-loader faster, we should definitely allow that option.. I did some profiling: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296#issuecomment-288464857. includePaths is only working for sass imports. url() statements are left untouched by the sass-loader. The css-loader will try to resolve url() statements, and a statement like url('images/logo.svg'); will be translated to url('./images/logo.svg'); because the CSS syntax does not distinguish between module imports and relative imports.\n\nIf you really want this behavior, you need to write url('/images/logo.svg'); and use the root option of the css-loader like this:\nmodule: {\n    loaders: [{\n      test: /\\.scss$/,\n      loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract([\n        'css-loader?' + JSON.stringify({\n          root: path.join(__dirname, 'images')\n         }),\n        'sass-loader'].join('!'))\n    }]\n  }\nHowever, I don't really recommend this because it defeats the purpose of using webpack for stylesheets. If you need to build it this way, maybe it's not a good idea to use webpack for the stylesheets.. @Nexxado the option is called sourceMap without s. Also for the css-loader.\nSee example. Closing this one since it is not an actual bug description. We know that source maps do work with webpack 2 and sass-loader. However, there can be issues depending on the language features you are using, like #351. @clintonb cool thx.\nPlease also add -loader to sass and I will merge it. Webpack 2 removed this shorthand because it was a source of bugs for newcomers.. Awesome. Yeah, that makes sense. I didn't realize that you need the sass instance to access their types. Would you be open to do a PR? Please also write a small test and a note in the README for that.. Wait ... is this change really necessary? Why couldn't you just require node-sass in your project? It's a peer dependency and should return the exact same object.. I assume that this is somehow related to your setup. When using --watch, webpack will only rebuild the files that had an error. Can you try to provide a minimal example repository that demonstrates the problem?\nPlease note that we can only recompile starting from the entry SASS file. So, if you have one monolithic SASS file with a lot of imports, we need to rebuild that one \u2013\u00a0even when the syntax error was just in a little file that was imported. Unfortunately, that's the way how the SASS language was designed.. Thank you for your PR.\nTBH I don't know why we're overwriting sourceRoot here. Maybe it wasn't set to the time I tried the source maps. However, it seems like there is an sourceMapRoot option in node-sass. We should use that one if its set.\nCould you check the following things:\n\nWhat is the value of sourceRoot when the sourceMapRoot option is not set?\nIs the value of sourceRoot correct when the sourceMapRoot option is set?. I won't add a new option to the sass-loader, because this should passed directly to node-sass as sourceMapRoot option. But I won't override map.sourceRoot anymore when it's defined.. Thanks for the suggestion, but this is clearly related to your setup. Your suggestion won't work with webpack 2.. I'm pretty confident that the sass-loader is not changing the order. We have a lot of tests for that. Please remove every other loader and try to remove as much code as possible while the error still occurs. This will help to track down the problem.. Thx. Shipped with 4.1.0. Nice example of how \"fixing a bug can be a breaking change\".. \"Fixed\" since node-sass 4 was no valid peer dependency.. Sorry. There are tests for nested imports and I use them every day, so I doubt that this is related to the sass-loader.\n\nPlease create a minimal example and instructions on how to reproduce the error. I'll reopen this, if it's a confirmed problem with the sass-loader.\nSince this is an error in the C stack, I assume that you're using a custom importer which throws an error.. There's no entry point. Please take a look at our unit tests and examples to get a working example.. Sorry, this is no WebStorm support forum.\nBesides that, it works in my WebStorm:\n\n. Strange. I do have multiple entry points and I never experienced this Stack level too deep error. Would be nice to reproduce it reliably...\nI'm thinking of moving node-sass into a separate process. Do you think this might solve it?. For background information: node 0.12 maintenance support will end on 2016/12/31. Yes, it's a duplicate.. By prepending the string with exclamation mark, you can disable the loaders configured in the webpack.config.js.\nHowever, it is recommended to use the webpack.config.js anyway. The inline syntax should only be used in certain exceptions. That's why I removed it from the README.. You don't need to add a blob url. Please reference your fonts relatively and use the file-loader.. Sorry, there is not enough information to reproduce this. Please provide a minimal test repository that demonstrates the problem so I can check that out. Try to remove as much stuff as possible since it helps tracking down the problem.. No idea \ud83d\ude01 \nThx for submitting your patch.. Have you tried fiddling around with webpack's resolving options? The sass-loader uses webpack's resolving engine, so that should work (in theory). I haven't tests for that, though.. Please provide a small example repository that demonstrates the error. Could you also check if the error is still there without the sass-loader?. @maggo thanks for the example repo. The processed source map contains a negative column number. I don't know how we can fix that since these column numbers come from node-sass.\nI've tried to compile the index.scss with node-sass itself and it seems to work, so maybe that's an issue with webpack's source map consumer :(\nI think, this is also related to #272 . @albertogasparin awesome! This is a good starting point to locate the error. Unfortunately, I don't have time for that now, but I would be glad if someone of you could tackle it.\nCrazy, I've never seen mixins and & used together:\n```scss\n@mixin FormField {\n  position: relative;\n  display: flex;\n  line-height: $Pollicino-FormField-height;\n&-label {     // <---- that's where the error is coming from\n``\n. @cj if you useurl()in an import statement, node-sass won't touch this import anymore. It will be passed to the css-loader as it is. The css-loader, however, will try to resolve it, thus triggering another sass compilation with thescss/mixin` as entry.\nAs a result, you might end up with a lot of duplicate css code in your bundle.\n@hiroshishu Since there is no stack trace, it seems like this error occurs somewhere between JS and native code. Do you use the importer or the function option?. This is definitely not a sass-loader problem.\nWhy are you using a mixin for the box-shadow anyway? It's supported in all major browsers.. Again, not a sass-loader issue. Check the transition mixin (you don't need a mixin for that too).. That would be awesome. Could you create a PR? \ud83d\udc4d \nJust create a directory called examples (thus it will be ignored by npm as configured in the .npmignore). Please also setup eslint for the examples directory.. I've added a test case for animate.css. It works fine.\nJust remove the includePaths option and use the tilde path to import stuff from node_modules, like this:\n```\n@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-flex';\n@import '~animatewithsass/animate.scss';\n@import '~animate.css/animate.css';\n```. > but with tilde (~) the imported file is not in webpack's chunk\nIt's just another way of referencing it. The CSS will definitely be in webpack's chunk (whatever that is).. The file must have the sass extension if it's written in sass syntax. Try to narrow down the exact file, that is causing the issue and try to compile it with node-sass. Does it work with node-sass?. You don't need to set the option explicitly anymore. The sass-loader derives it automatically for files ending on .sass. The webpack.config.js cannot use webpack features. It is executed in node and can only contain node compatible code.. You're importing a SCSS file in your webpack.config:\njs\nvar sass = require(\"./sass/lifeleveler.scss\");\nNode cannot import SCSS files. It does not support loaders.. Which docs? Which plugin?. This is a loader. Loaders are different than webpack plugins.\n\nI'm using the exact code from the docs...\n\nThere is no part in the docs where a sass file is included into the webpack config. Why would you want to do that anyway? ^^. The LoaderOptionsPlugin should not be necessary, see my comment here.\nWe have a test for includePaths. It should work the way you described it. Could you create a minimal example repo that reproduces the error?. @asolopovas with sass-loader 4.1.1 and webpack 2.2.1, both config examples work.\nWith sass-loader 5.0.1, webpack.config.js does not work because the sass-loader doesn't read the config from the webpack options object anymore. You don't need to use the LoaderOptionsPlugin with sass-loader 5.0.0 anymore. Just specify the loader options directly. Thus, webpack.config.error.js does work.. Also check out our tests.. Ok, now I can reproduce this error on Windows (doesn't happen on macOS):\nERROR in E:/temp/sass-loader-test/~/css-loader?{\"sourceMap\":true}!E:/temp/sass-loader-test/~/sass-loader/lib/loader.js?{\"sourceMap\":true,\"includePaths\":[\"E://temp//sass-loader-test//~//foundation-sites//scss\",\"E://temp//sass-loader-test//~//motion-ui//src\",\"E://temp//sass-loader-test//resources//assets//sass\"]}!../sass/app.scss\nModule build failed: Error: \"../../node_modules/foundation-sites/scss/foundation.scss\" is not in the SourceMap.\n    at BasicSourceMapConsumer.SourceMapConsumer_sourceContentFor [as sourceContentFor] (E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\source-map\\lib\\source-map-consumer.js:704:13)\n    at SourceMapGenerator.<anonymous> (E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\source-map\\lib\\source-map-generator.js:235:40)\n    at Array.forEach (native)\n    at SourceMapGenerator_applySourceMap [as applySourceMap] (E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\source-map\\lib\\source-map-generator.js:234:32)\n    at MapGenerator.applyPrevMaps (E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\postcss\\lib\\map-generator.js:146:22)\n    at MapGenerator.generateMap (E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\postcss\\lib\\map-generator.js:194:46)\n    at MapGenerator.generate (E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\postcss\\lib\\map-generator.js:297:25)\n    at LazyResult.stringify (E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\postcss\\lib\\lazy-result.js:296:24)\n    at E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\\node_modules\\postcss\\lib\\lazy-result.js:233:27\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:103:7)\n @ ../sass/app.scss 4:14-151\n @ ./app.js\n @ multi ./app\nIt seems like node-sass is exporting source maps with forward slashes (which are also valid on Windows). Webpack's source map module, however, stores backslash paths. That's why the source maps can not be resolved.\nI can fix this in sass-loader by applying path.normalize on all source map paths.\nNext time, please always post the actual error message including the stack trace.. @janusch Could you try the latest sass-loader on master branch? If it's still not working, you can try to comment out these lines. Does it work then? How do the paths look like when they come from node-sass?. @asolopovas Running your example repo and --config webpack.config.error.js with sass-loader 6.0.2 does not produce any errors:\n```\nIEUser@IE11Win7 MINGW32 /E/temp/sass-loader-test (master)\n$ webpack --config webpack.config.error.js\n(node:2612) DeprecationWarning: loaderUtils.parseQuery() received a non-string value which can be problematic, see https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/issues/56\nparseQuery() will be replaced with getOptions() in the next major version of loader-utils.\nHash: c868b04bdf3742bebc1b\nVersion: webpack 2.2.1\nTime: 6119ms\n Asset   Size  Chunks             Chunk Names\napp.js  44 kB       0  [emitted]  main\n   [0] ./app.js 43 bytes {0} [built]\n   [1] E:/temp/sass-loader-test/~/css-loader?{\"sourceMap\":true}!E:/temp/sass-loader-test/~/sass-loader/lib/loader.js?{\"sourceMap\":true,\"includePaths\":[\"E://temp//sass-loader-test//~//foundation-sites//scss\",\"E://temp//sass-loader-test//~//motion-ui//src\",\"E://temp//sass-loader-test//resources//assets//sass\"]}!../sass/app.scss 4.01 kB {0} [built]\n   [2] E:/temp/sass-loader-test/~/css-loader/lib/css-base.js 1.51 kB {0} [built]\n   [3] E:/temp/sass-loader-test/~/style-loader/addStyles.js 7.15 kB {0} [built]\n   [4] ../sass/app.scss 1.12 kB {0} [built]\n   [5] multi ./app 28 bytes {0} [built]\nIEUser@IE11Win7 MINGW32 /E/temp/sass-loader-test (master)\n$ npm ls sass-loader\nsass-loader@1.0.0 E:\\temp\\sass-loader-test\n-- sass-loader@6.0.2\n```. I don't know what the vue-loader is doing, but if I remove the sass-loader and just try to compileApp.vue` the same error is still there. So this is not related to the sass-loader.. The sass-loader has its own loader pipeline. This configuration fixed the issue:\n{\n                test: /\\.vue$/,\n                loader: 'vue-loader',\n                options: {\n                    loaders: {\n                        scss: 'vue-style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader?' + JSON.stringify({\n                            includePaths: [\n                                path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/foundation-sites/scss'),\n                            ]\n                        }), // <style lang=\"scss\">\n                        sass: 'vue-style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader?indentedSyntax' // <style lang=\"sass\">\n                    }\n                }\n            }. > A hack solution is definitely better then no solution thanks\nOh, I don't think that this is a hack solution. Since a vue file can host a lot of file types, it makes sense to have a dedicated loader pipeline because webpack's loader test algorithm wouldn't work here.. If you have a .babelrc or a tsconfig.json inside your root folder, they are reading the config from these files.

No problem. You're welcome :)\nI'm willing to help if the other side is providing a test repository. This makes spotting bugs/wrong configurations a lot easier.. Thx, I'll take a look.. Haha, nice one! Seems like you've encountered a bug/unexpected behavior of the loader-utils. Starting with commit e6dc9c1daa02b1c87d9431e77c7ae9771b22f80b, the loader utils will recognize loader options objects and just return them.\nHowever, inside the sass-loader, I expected to always get a new object when calling parseQuery. That's why I modify the received options object. Thus, data will accumulate all sass files if the loader is executed multiple times.. This will bloat a lot of CSS files... working on a quickfix.. A fix should ship with 5.0.1. Are you using the css-loader and the file-loader? In that case, you don't need to configure anything. The file-loader will hash all files automatically.. If you're using the css-loader, have you enabled the url option (default is enabled, but maybe you've disabled it)?. https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/css-bundle. Clone the repo, build the example running build.js and checkout the result in the js directory.\nThe final url will look like this. The referenced image will be copied to the output folder.. Apparently, the sass-loader is not applied to the file. Make sure, your loader configuration is valid. The pasted config looks ok, but maybe you've oversimplified it for this issue?\nPlease, also create a small example repository that demonstrates the problem with the sass-loader.. @wsfuller webpack only understands JavaScript. If there is no rule for a scss file, scss files will be treated as JavaScript.. I totally understand your frustration. I also think that the configuration is too complicated, but it's hard to have big changes without breaking a lot of code. However, we want to improve that, that's why we've started a discussion here.\nWe're also working on webpack-cli which will offer a convenient way to get things up running very quickly. We imagine things like webpack-cli add css-modules or webpack-cli add sass. The webpack configuration itself, however, will always be low-level because we believe that many developers also appreciate the flexibility to adjust things to their requirements.\nRegarding the documentation: If you're not satisfied with our guides, you can simply edit them (click on \"Edit this page\"). This will bring you to Github where you can edit the file and create a PR with one click. We really appreciate every contribution to the webpack.js.org repository. Contributions to our repositories are even refunded from our OpenCollective account (in case you're legally allowed to create invoices).. Sorry, there is not enough information to reproduce this. Please provide a minimal test repository that demonstrates the problem so I can check that out. Try to remove as much stuff as possible since it helps tracking down the problem.. I assume you are using the LoaderOptionsPlugin? Could you paste the configuration of that?\nThis will probably be fixed with the next patch version.. @bholloway this will again be breaking for the resolve-url-loader. I've created a PR for this: https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader/pull/44. These source maps are truly driving me crazy ^^\nCould you review https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/377 and try it with your test setup? I think, now all paths should be correct.. @bholloway I've written a test that checks if all files in the source map can be resolved.. Thx for reviewing it.\n\nI believe that node-sass@>=4 has a problem with the source map. There are negative original mappings. For example:\n\nThat is a known problem. I don't know enough about source maps, whether that is valid. But it seems like the source maps from node-sass itself are interpreted correctly (tested on chrome). I assume that webpack's source-map module has problems with this, but I'm not sure.\n\nWhen content is not embedded then it will need to be served to the browser. So we should avoid ../ paths in the source-map. The shallowest common directory is usually process.cwd() (or close to it) so I think you are safe there.\n\nChrome allows to configure a directory mapping for source maps. Thus, source maps don't need to be served.\nThe problem here is that we don't know anything about the final source map destination inside the loader. That's why I think it's better to use relative paths with a sourceRoot. This way, the browser should be able to locate the actual source file on disk (only exception: The file is on a different hard drive).. You're using webpack 1 and are trying to install the latest sass-loader. We removed Webpack 1 support with sass-loader 5.0.0. You need to run npm i sass-loader@4.\nPlease also read about peer dependencies. The error is quite clear if you know the concept of peer dependencies.. The error looks like the sass-loader is not active on that file. Please check that. If you still think, this is a sass-loader issue, please provide a minimal example that reproduces the error. Try to remove as much as possible.. I'll close it for now. When you're sure, it's a sass-loader problem, I'll re-open it.. That is hell of a stack trace! :). If you prepend ~ to the import statement, it will use webpack's usual module resolving engine: @import \"~@barebone/var-z-index\". Awesome, thx :). Please provide more context. What is AoT? Do you have a code example that demonstrates the error?. This has been addressed with #398 and shipped with 6.0.3.. Looks like you're trying to import a scss file but you've only configured the sass-loader for sass files. That's the only thing I can spot with the given information.\n\nThings you should consider in the future before opening an issue:\n\nPlease format your issue with code blocks ```\nOmit stuff that is probably not relevant\nDon't omit stuff that could be helpful: Error message + stack trace for instance\n\nIf you want to help us to find the problem: Provide a small test repository that demonstrates the bug.\nIn case, you're not sure whether it's a bug or whether there's something wrong with your configuration, ask a question on StackOverflow an tag them with webpack or go to the webpack gitter channel.\nThank you :). The sass syntax is not compatible with css modules. You can escape the colon like this:\nsass\n\\:local(.container)\n  padding-top: 20px\nSee https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2245. Seems like your PR was based on a fork because there a lot of unrelated changes (see diff).\nI'm not sure about this, because our tests run against webpack 2, so we don't know when we introduce anything breaking. We also don't have the manpower to maintain compatibility for a long time. It's safer and less work if we only allow webpack 2.. Thanks for the work. This commit was pulled in with #398 \ud83d\udc4d . See #394 . Sorry. There is no explanation what you're trying to fix. Furthermore, your fix looks actually very broken:\n\n. Thx for creating a detailed report. This has been addressed with #398 and shipped with 6.0.3.. Awesome, that makes sense \ud83d\udc4d Didn't know the design was broken on the docs page.\nCould you do the same for the https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader? \ud83d\ude01 . Why should we support writing code that does not work across platforms? Windows accepts / as valid path separator, OSX and Linux systems do not. Why don't they use regular slashes?. Furthermore: I assume that Sass interprets backslashes as escape character. This means that you need to use double backslashes if you want to have a single backslash (exactly like in JavaScript). Have you read the section about problems with url()? Please also note that the README expects webpack 2.. To be honest, I'm not sure if aliases are supported. It should be supported afaik, but we have no test case for that.\nThx for reporting this. I will take a look.. @wsfuller does your setup have the same problem as @mortocks pointed out? If not, please provide a small test example that makes the error reproducible.\nYour config should probably also look like this:\nwebpack.config\n{\n    test: /\\.(s?)css$/,\n    use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n        fallback: 'style-loader',\n        use: ['css-loader', 'postcss-loader', 'resolve-url-loader', 'sass-loader'],\n    })\n  },\n\nThe postcss-loader can't deal with Sass.\n. You should be able to use the sass-loader 4.x with webpack 1. We dropped official support with sass-loader 5.x which means that it might work, but there is no guarantee. This is the sass-loader 4.x documentation.\nI recommend switching to webpack 2 as soon as possible since we don't have the manpower to maintain multiple versions. Additionally, I think the transition from webpack 1 to webpack 2 isn't as hard as it may seem. There were little breaking changes. Everything you need to know is documented in the migration guide.. Thx \ud83d\udc4d \nI don't know how this could happen.... Good catch! \ud83d\udc4d . > However, this only works for top level files. It appears that @require statements are not resolved by webpack.\n\nI've had a browse through the code base (very readable), but I don't have a full grasp of how this works now. Is it the case that files are piped through webpack when @required, or is this entirely handled by node-sass?\n\nWe register a custom importer which will be invoked by Libsass as soon as an @import statement is encountered.\nThen, we determine a list of file paths that we want to try. This is necessary in order to mimic the original Sass behavior of underscore imports.\nFor instance, this:\nsass\n@require 'variables'\nwill generate this list of possible imports to resolve:\njs\n[\n'/path/to/_variables.scss', '/path/to/_variables.sass', '/path/to/_variables.css',\n'/path/to/variables.scss', '/path/to/variables.sass', '/path/to/variables.css'\n]\nThese paths are then passed to webpack's resolver. In your setup, however, these paths won't be resolvable.\nThis can be fixed in two ways:\n1\nWe could add a check for scss.erb or sass.erb to the sass-loader. In this case, you would need to add the extension to your imports:\nsass\n@require 'variables.scss.erb'\n2\nYou could write a resolver plugin which transforms requests that end on .sass or .scss to sass.erb or scss.erb. You can also limit this to a specific directory.\n\nIf you choose option 1, I would like to learn a little bit about your use-case. What is the erb file extension about? Is it commonly used? What is this @require statement? This is not valid Sass afaik.\nIf you choose option 2, I can help you \ud83d\ude01 . That option looks good. It's not my most favorite solution, because ideally this could be handled by webpack's resolver itself, but since the sass-loader needs to mimic the original Sass' import behavior, we probably have to go this route. Configuring the importExtensions makes sense then.\nWaiting for your PR \ud83d\udc4d . Thx \ud83d\udc4d . Can you set up a small example repository that demonstrates the problem? Just ignoring the file doesn't really solve the issue, because then the watcher will not work at all.\nI want to understand why addNormalizedDependency is receiving a relative path. Is that a bug in Libsass?. Thanks for providing that example. I'll take a look.. @evilebottnawi Sorry for being unresponsive.\nI won't add any additional custom aliasing to the sass-loader since it is already complicated enough. If webpack's module.alias option would be more powerful, this could be solved by anyone.\nHowever, I think your use case should be solvable today by writing a custom importer for this particular file:\n```js\nconst nodeSass = require(\"node-sass\");\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    {\n        loader: \"sass-loader\",\n        options: {\n            importer: [\n                // url will be the string passed to @import\n                // prev is the file where the import was encountered\n                (url, prev) => (\n                    shouldBeAliased(url) ?\n                        { file: require.resolve(\"path/to/alias.sass\") } :\n                        // pass file to the next importer\n                        // the last importer is the webpack importer inserted by the sass-loader\n                        nodeSass.types.Null()\n                )\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\nI haven't tested this, but this should work. Please let me know if it actually did \ud83d\ude01. Or try out the node-sass-magic-importer which may solve this for you already...\nYou can also write a custom resolver for webpack, but this is more complicated:\n```js\nclass ResolverPlugin {\n    constructor(options) {\n        this.options = options;\n    }\n    apply(resolver) {\n        resolver.plugin(\"described-resolve\", (request, callback) => {\n            // request is an object that contains meta information about the resolve request\n            // request.request is a string that has been passed to the resolver, similar to url in the custom importer\n            // request.context.issuer is an absolute path to the file that wants to import the request\n        if (shouldBeAliased(request.request) === false) {\n            callback();\n\n            return;\n        }\n\n        resolver.doResolve(\n            \"resolve\",\n            Object.assign({}, request, {\n                request: require.resolve(\"path/to/alias.sass\")\n            }),\n            \"aliased sass file\",\n            callback\n        );\n    });\n}\n\n}\nmodule.exports = class AliasSassFilePlugin {\n    constructor(options) {\n        this.options = options;\n    }\napply(compiler) {\n    compiler.plugin(\"after-resolvers\", () => {\n        compiler.resolvers.normal.apply(new ResolverPlugin(this.options));\n    });\n}\n\n}\n``. @smrq you're right, the current loader configuration does not insert a module for each sass file into webpack's dependency graph, it just uses webpack's resolver. The less-loader already usesloadModule, but only for non-Less files in order to allow@import` of JS files for instance.\nHowever, I'm not sure if we should insert a module for each Sass file because there is no actual benefit besides the NormalModuleReplacementPlugin. It would just increase the memory usage...\nI think your use case can be solved with a resolver plugin, but unfortunately there is no easy (core-)plugin like the NormalModuleReplacementPlugin. @sokra what do you think? Should we add a resolver plugin to core?. Version bump and publish please :wink: :+1: \n. :dancers: \n. Does node-sass provide an api to intercept the compilation process? @sokra is using the Less-Parser in the less-loader\n. I've made some investigation and it seems like libsass (which node-sass is based on) is not providing a way to intercept the loading of files. This means that we can't resolve files by webpack's algorithm.\nAt least libsass is exposing an array of all imported files which can be marked as dependency. Unfortunately node-sass isn't exposing this yet.\n. > @import will not use webpack's pipeline (unless it is a CSS import that gets passed to css-loader).\nExactly. You can raise your voice here, maybe they'll implement it.\n\nWhat else?\n\nThe watch-mode won't work for sass-modules since webpack doesn't know about the dependencies. If node-sass exposed the array of all imported files, at least this could be fixed. Until then a third-party watcher which simply watches all scss-files can be used.\n\nIt would probably be nice to add a caveat to the documentation for this loader\n\nYep :+1: . Creating a pull-request of the readme is very easy on GitHub. Just click the edit-button :smile: \n. Cool!\n. Btw: I'm currently working on this at node-sass. You can watch the progress there.\n. includedFiles landed in node-sass today, so marking dependencies is now possible.\n. It seems like there is an issue on macs...\n. Have you initialized the submodule libsass? It seems like it can't find the header files:\n../sass_context_wrapper.h:1:36: fatal error: libsass/sass_interface.h: No such file or directory\n. Yup!\n. Nice! :+1: \n. @sokra ?\n@lukebrooker This is completely handled by node-sass, but I assume that it is imported twice as this is sass' default behavior. However, there are hacks to avoid it.\n. @ryanseddon This kind of modularity is currently not possible with any CSS preprocessor (LESS and SASS), because each compilation is self-contained and doesn't know about previous compilations. That's why every require() of a SASS or LESS file creates a complete standalone CSS file with all the duplicates.\nHowever, LESS provides a way to import other LESS files without including the source which works quite well.\n. Yep https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/22 :grinning:\n. Ok thx :+1: \n. Cool, thx.\n. We should check if this is possible with the current beta version of node-sass.\nThe current master branch is already using node-sass 2.0, so we can start playing with it now.\n. Has been published as v0.4.1. I've added instructions to the README.\n. inline-source-map is the best option for development, because it requires no setup to retrieve the original source. However, it's not suitable for production, that's why we leave it up to the user to configure.\n. But a segmentation fault is not an issue of the sass-loader?\n. It's a tricky question. There are pro and cons for both sides. The less-loader decided to move it to peerDependencies...\n. I think we should move it to the peerDependencies. There is a greater benefit for most developers to specify the sass version directly (see recent pull-requests and issues regarding node-sass v2).\nNow that peerDependencies will not be deprecated.\n. done()\n. node-sass just implemented the api (sass/node-sass#530). Now we need to wait for v2 to be released.\n. > Is this now working?\nNope, we need to adjust the sass-loader for this. But I guess it's ready to be implemented :grimacing: \n. @akiran ok to merge?\n. I could do it. But currently I don't have a sass-project either, it's just personal interest :grinning:. Maybe both @akiran and me? \n. Most of the time I publish under the name of peerigon.\n. :+1: \n. Looks good to me!\n. Published as 0.3.1\n. Mhmmm guessing from the comments it is an issue related to node 0.11. When I run npm i sass-loader on node 0.10.33 there are no errors.\nSince node 0.11 is not a stable release I don't think we need to lock the version number...\n. Damn!\n. Starting with 1.0.0, node-sass is now a peerDependency\n. Fixed with https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/113\n. This is more likely an issue with npm or your setup. I can't find any clue why this should be a problem with sass-loader itself.\n. Cool, thx! :+1: Could you also add some tests?\n. Synchronous compilation has been implemented, but there is no flag yet...\n. I don't know what the correct settings are, but you probably need to adjust the $icon-font-path-variable. Bootstrap provides the possibility to configure the path to the icon fonts. Make sure that the url() is pointing from the imported file (probably /assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss in your case) to the font-files.\n. You need to think from the css-loader's perspective. It gets a css-file with url() statements referencing files. Now you need to start from the css-file's location and walk the relative url to the file and look if the path is correct.\n. Related discussions: sass/sass#1015 sass/libsass#532\nYou could also try this sass mixin to achieve relative urls.\n. :+1: \n. $bootstrap-sass-asset-helper might also work. However, setting $icon-font-path relative to the scss entry file does also work. I'm using this setting in my projects.\n. There is a test for bootstrap. It must be related to your local config.\n. There's a note about this problem at https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#problems-with-url. Why was this not helpful? We have a test for bootstrap: https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/blob/master/test/scss/bootstrap-sass.scss\n. First of all, thank you for your pull-request. I'm glad you noticed the new includedFiles-feature, I've implemented it in node-sass :grinning:\nWe've discussed about marking dependencies. The problem is, that libsass is ignoring the whole module when there's a syntax error. Thus webpack's file watcher will not fire, even after you've fixed the error. This has probably been fixed with a new version of libsass (I recall a discussion about this at libsass). But before we're removing sass-graph we need to assert that all dependencies are marked (even those with a syntax error).\nHowever, I'm willing to publish a beta of the sass-loader which will use the new node-sass version. There will also be custom importers which will integrate nicely with webpack's custom resolving engine.\n. That would be great :+1: \n. I'm getting an error on node 0.11.14\nmodule.js:355\n  Module._extensions[extension](this, filename);\n                               ^\nError: Module did not self-register.\n    at Error (native)\n    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)\n    at Module.require (module.js:365:17)\n    at require (module.js:384:17)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/jhnns/dev/jtangelder/sass-loader/node_modules/node-sass/lib/index.js:211:15)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:460:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:478:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)\nThis is probably related to a recent fix at node-sass. I don't think that we can publish the current state because it would break all projects using node 0.11.x.\n. We should probably also bump our major version, because according to node-sass it is a breaking change.\n. node-sass 2.0.0 has been released... sass/node-sass#157\n. Has been published as 0.4.0\n. #41\n. Has been published as 0.4.0.\n. Thx\n. LESS is handling these issues way more elegantly...\n. Afaik libsass doesn't touch urls(). This error is probably caused by the css-loader. \nThe webpack-way of doing this is to configure the file-loader or url-loader for these binary files.\nIf you're really sure that webpack shouldn't manage these assets, you can use root urls (= urls starting with a /) to signalize the css-loader, that it shouldn't touch them.\n. Mhmm I'm not quite sure ... could be an issue with sass-graph. Could you remove the calls of markDependencies() in your local installation of the sass-loader and check, if the problem still exists?\n. Fixed?\n. We don't depend on sass-graph anymore.\n. Donnu ... if our tests are passing, we should publish it. If our tests are passing while we know that it doesn't work in actual projects, we should fix our tests :grin: \n. You mean because of https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/41#issuecomment-70372228?\n. Yep, I've published it.\nWe should consider using a major version bump and following semver...\n. Could you show an example how you'd expect things to work?\nI'm afraid that this is currently not possible (if I got it right). But with custom importers #31 it's probably possible. Then you can write a special loader, which generates scss code to import your dynamic vars.\n. Mhmmm your solution would probably work too.\nAnd when you need to access the variables also via client-side JavaScript:\njavascript\nwebpack.DefinePlugin(require(\"./styles/variables.js\"));\n. Oh, there are use-cases where this is required... :)\nI'll check that!\n. @Kasu haha, nice!\n@nwhite89 no I don't think so. I don't want to extend the language itself...\n. Is @EdwardIrby 's solution working for you? I'd like to link the loader in our README, but I'm not sure about how safe that string replaces are :grin: ...\nDo you have any experience on this?\n. Thx @nightgrey \nThis issue can now also be solved with the data-option. Just define any Sass code which will be prepended to the actual entry file.\n. > It's a bit confusing where to options, query params or sassLoader\nI know... this will be simpler with webpack 2 where there is a dedicated way to set the options (query params didn't work so well with more complex use-cases).\n. Nope, looks good. There must be a different error in your setup.\n. @nagarajay Does this work for you?\n. When they're using !default, yes. Otherwise, no.\n. While this is true for webpack 1, this has been changed with webpack 2. See current README.. You're right, but this will probably be fixed as soon as node-sass 2.0 is ready-to-use.\n. @akiran Should we publish it without beta?\n. #51\n. Sorry for not answering this.\nFirst of all: Thank you for work. I appreciate every contribution. Unfortunately this PR looks a bit over-complicated to me. Imho you're using too much internal stuff which can then break easily when @sokra changes something.\nWe can take the less-loader as blueprint since it already has this feature for quite some time. The important code is here. We can let webpack/enhanced-resolve do the resolving by calling\njavascript\n// loaderContext is `this` inside the loader\nloaderContext.resolve(context, moduleRequest, cb)\nTake also a look at the loader api.\nI'll publish a branch which contains the refactoring for node-sass@2.0.0\n. Oh, ok... didn't know that you already tried the less-loader approach.\n@izaakschroeder what do you mean by \"module urls\"? Inlined loaders?\n@sokra is that true? Does loaderContext.resolve not apply inline loaders?\nI don't know what you mean by \"root directory\", but the described behavior should be done with loaderUtils.urlToRequest(url)\n. Check out this chapter of loader-utils.\nThe ~-prefix points to module directories. This should be consistent across all loaders where the import/require syntax doesn't differentiate between local and module directories. The css-loader and less-loader are already using it.\n. I've implemented the custom importer with the less-loader approach.\nAnyway, thanks for your suggestions :+1: \n. Running npm install sass-loader and inspecting the package.json outputs:\njavascript\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"loader-utils\": \"^0.2.5\",\n    \"node-sass\": \"^2.0.1\",\n    \"sass-graph\": \"^1.0.3\"\n  },\n. Try to run it in an empty folder. You've probably specified another version in your package.json.\n. No problem\n. The sass-loader just returns a string containing css so you should be free to do whatever you want. However, I do recommend that you use the css-loader, so that all referenced images are written to the output folder as well.\nI don't know anything about the css-loader returning arrays or something. I thought it would also just return a string (but I also haven't used the output directly yet).\n. Thx\n. Starting with 1.0.0, we don't depend on sass-graph anymore.\n. Thx.\nPublished as 0.4.2\n. I'll take a look\n. Could you create a small test-case? I need to know more about your actual project structure, because source maps are working as expected in our repo.\n. No problem. :grinning: \n. #31 \n. > Just wanted to confirm my understanding after reading through the issues that a solution to this is still being worked on?\nYes\n. Thank you for your PR! But I'll favor #61, if that's ok for you :)\n. Published as 0.5.0.\nJust wanted to point out that node-sass will be listed as peerDependency with sass-loader 1.0.0\n. Thx :+1: \n. Not yet. You could switch isSync to true in your local installation to test it. I heard that sync compilation is awful slow in sufficient complex projects so this has no priority for me.\n. Stuck processes should be no issue with 2.0.0 anymore. So this flag is not necessary.\n. Yep, I was also getting these. You need to stick with sass-loader 0.x until this is fixed. :unamused: \n. I've managed to write a version of sass-loader that provides the same features while depending on node-sass 2.1.1. It's on a separate branch and can be installed via npm i sass-loader@0.6.x. Please note, that sass-loader 0.6.0 is listing node-sass as peerDependency as well.\n. I didn't expect node-sass 3.0.0-beta to be so unstable, but \u2013 well \u2013 it is a beta. @alexhawkins you can use old versions of sass-loader until the current ones are stable.\n. Afaik sass-loader@0.4.2 is the last version that does not bother you with errors\n. @raphaelsaunier I've updated the README\n. @haustraliaer that are good news. Please let me know if everything works as expected. I'll remove the note in the README then.\n. @alexduan this does not happen in our tests, so please try to narrow it down and open a separate issue.\n. With sass-loader 1.0.0 node-sass should now be a dependency of your project.\n. node-sass@3.0.0-alpha.0 is \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 not stable :wink:. Probably the same issues as #65 \n. The files are now resolved by webpack, and webpack doesn't care about the _ mechanism. However, since Sass users are expecting this feature to work (although it has nothing to with the language itself and should imho not be part of the specification, but that's another topic :wink:), I'm willing to implement this feature.\nIf you don't want to replace all your import statements, I recommend to stick with sass-loader 0.x for now. There are also some issues on OSX afaik #65. \n. Should be fixed with 1.0.1\n. Is that a wildcard or do you have a file called *.scss? Wildcards are not supported.\n. #151 \nAre globs supported by Rubysass? Why are people expecting this to work?\n. node-sass 3.0.0 is causing some trouble :cry:\n71\n. I've managed to write a version of sass-loader that provides the same features while depending on node-sass 2.1.1. It's on a separate branch and can be installed via npm i sass-loader@0.6.x. Please note, that sass-loader 0.6.0 is listing node-sass as peerDependency as well.\n. I suppose, this is a problem with node-sass/libsass itself, because sass-loader is just passing the input on.\n. Mhmm damn ... we can't just decrement the node-sass dependency because sass-loader 1.0.0 builds on the new API introduced with 3.0.0.\nMaybe I can publish a stable sass-loader version without the new features introduced with 1.0.0...\n. @am11 thx for the support! 3.0.0-beta.4 is working pretty reliable in our tests.\n. It's in node-sass: https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/713\n. I've managed to write a version of sass-loader that provides the same features while depending on node-sass 2.1.1. It's on a separate branch and can be installed via npm i sass-loader@0.6.x. Please note, that sass-loader 0.6.0 is listing node-sass as peerDependency as well.\n. Yeah, we've realized that too :disappointed:. It's a problem inside the custom importer code.\n. Awesome!\n. With sass-loader 2.0.0, you should have no problems with it anymore.\n. Thx for the feedback, but this error does not seem to be related to sass-loader...\n. Would it be possible if we didn't set the option? How is node-sass supposed to know, which syntax is used?\n. Shipped with v1.0.2.\nImporting a file with the other language style requires the extension to be set explicitly.\n. I don't think that this is a sass-loader issue, because we're just passing the input to node-sass which passes it on to libsass. \nYou could make a PR to sass-spec to demonstrate the problem. Maybe @mgreter can help you.\n. There are actually tests for error reporting, so I don't expect this issue to be a problem of sass-loader. Could you provide a minimal example of your project where the error occurs?\n. Thx, I'll take a look\n. Is this still an issue?\n. I'm glad to hear that :+1: \n. Thx for the report. Could you check if that is a node-sass or libsass issue? The sass-loader just passes the input on.\n. There is an working example with bootstrap-sass in our test-folder: https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/tree/master/test/bootstrapSass\n. Is notsass a css file?\n. So is this a duplicate of #73?\n. Yep, that problem is vice versa, because the feature doesn't exist :grin: \n. Probably caused by #73\n. Does v1.0.2 fix this issue?\n. I'm glad I could help :grinning: \n. Yep. We need to track that issue, it's not a sass-loader thing.\n. Is the URL wrong or is the map file just not generated?\n. You're right. It looks like this has changed in webpack somehow... need to investigate.\n. Thx for investigating this.... so maybe we just need to remove all the sourceMappingURL references added by libsass?\n. > Maybe there should be an option for libsass to generate a source map without adding a reference\nWell, that option doesn't make sense from libsass' point of view ^^\n. I'll try that out, thanks!\n. Yep. See #123 \n. No problem, that's a legitimate question :grin: \nWe had the experience that most of the time it's more useful when the app author is able to specify the exact module version. sass-loader is basically just calling render(), the actual language features are used by you, the app author.\nOtherwise we had to publish a new version for each node-sass version, which is a maintenance nightmare.\nIt's the same problem with the less-loader btw.\n. No problem. 0.6.0 is actually the latest version that has been published. But that was a compatibility fix for an older version.\n. That's node-sass or libsass afaik. There is no console.log() in sass-loader.\n. Have you tried using https:// urls?\nBtw: Could you please format your question decently. You're expecting us to help you, so please help us understanding you.\n. Ah interesting... thx.\n. 0.6.0 is the last published version, because it contains a fix for the 0 major release. However, the current version you should install is v1.0.1\n. How do you configure the sass-loader in your webpack.config?\n. @sokra How do the paths need to be escaped?\n. Is this still an issue?\n. Yes, honestly, using encodeURIComponent is counter-intuitive. On the other hand, the configuration writer is the only person who can escape it properly because they know where the characters belong to. Is & part of the config or is it used to distinguish different parameters?\n. That PR looks good! I'm definitely willing to merge that. :+1:\nJust add some tests :)\n. Shipped with v1.0.2\n. All url()s must be relative to the sass main entry file, because the css-loader resolves the url()s based on this location.\nLess has an option which rewrites the urls accordingly, but Sass has not afaik. Have you tried overriding the $icon-font-path instead?\n. Oops, that's probably a bug introduced with 1.0.2. We have to take care of .css file extensions\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. I know that issue, but afaik it is not restricted to the sass-loader, it's a webpack-dev-server issue. I've experienced this with javascript code as well @sokra\n. I'll investigate this as soon as I've found some time.\n. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/104#issuecomment-108525870\n. Fixed with 1.0.4\n. Remove the sass-loader entry in your package.json and run npm i sass-loader@1.x --save. This should (currently) pull node-sass@3.1.1 \n. That's strange. The sass-loader doesn't modify any paths. Webpack should also be possible to work with these paths. Could you find out how these paths are messed up? What is actually wrong?\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. ^3.0.0-beta.4 should pull all versions up to 4.0.0 afaik.\n. Is it 5 times D or 6 times D? ^^ #DDDDD is no valid CSS color, #DDDDDD is.\n. Mhmm nope. That's a node-sass error so it should probably be reported in their repo. Can you isolate the error in a single file and compile that without webpack, just with node-sass?\nYou could try to not use protocol-relative URIs.\n. Is this still an issue with 2.0.0?\n. Since sass-loader 1.0.0 you don't need to set the includePaths manually. It should be resolved like a webpack module.\nThe error about not finding _foundation.scss is misleading, I have to admit. But the sass-loader always tries to resolve the module without a preceding underscore first, then with underscore. So that's not the error (I probably have to rework the error messages).\nCould you post your webpack.config.js?\n. Mhmm it could be that includePaths is broken since 1.0.0 because webpack is responsible for resolving paths (I still need to confirm that in a test though). However, it should work if you do it the webpack-way: Add ./src/main/resources/vendor/ to resolve.root and then write @import \"~foundation/scss/foundation\"\n. > I would prefer to write the scss (and really, all my code) webpack-agnostically\nThat's a valid argument...\nI'll have a look as soon as I found some time. Unfortunately I'm loaded with work... :unamused:. In the meantime, you can also take a look for yourself. The code is not complicated, but it requires some understanding about how to write loaders for webpack.\n. Should be fixed with 1.0.3\n. Probably also related to #100?\n. That's strange, thx for reporting this. Could you set up a small gist that reproduces the error?\n. @haustraliaer 's example shows the hangs.\n. I would be happy to provide a temporary fix, but #109 seems a bit risky to me...\n. If someone can publish a project that makes this reproducible, that would be a big help \ud83d\udc4d . Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. @jsg2021 When you add the .css extension, libsass does not include the file, it just turns it into @import url(..). When this is passed to the css-loader, all urls must be relative to the file which imports them. When you omit .css, libsass includes the file just like it was a .scss file. In this situation, all urls must be relative to the entry sass/scss file which was passed to the sass compiler.\nThis is how libsass handles it, the sass-loader is just imitating it.\n. Mhmm I don't have a working Windows setup to reproduce the error. Would be great if you could give me some insight. The sass-loader is not a huge project, so it should be fairly understandable.\nThis is the line that makes the included file known to webpack.\n. Do you use npm link or bower link?\n. Will be fixed with the next major version. You can already test the master branch.\n. Fixed with 2.0.0\n. Interesting @jeffling :+1: \nI think it's also possible to just do something like\n``` javascript\nmy-namespace {\n@import \"all/that/stuff\";\n\n}\n```\n. Yep. To be honest, I haven't found a way the other way round without code duplication.\n. Thanks for the pull-request, but I'm not sure if I should merge it. It increases the size of the final css considerably and thus is not an option to use in production...\nAs long as your able to set sourceMapContents=true in your app, that's a fair workaround.\n. After fiddling around, I realized that webpack includes the sourceMapContents by default anyway. Thus I've finally merged this manually. Shipped with 1.0.4.\nThx for your effort! :+1: \n. Yep, that's a known problem of preprocessors (both SASS and Less). I haven't found an easy way for SASS, though. Less introduced the import (reference) mechanism for that use-case.\n. We can't solve this because each require() of a SASS file from a JS file will trigger a distinct compilation. This is how loaders work.. That's a confirmed concurrency issue of node-sass 3. See #100 \n. Thx for the sample project. With \"live reload\": Do you mean page reload on file change or do you actually mean Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which replaces the stylesheets on the fly (#37)?\n. There's currently an issue with the style-loader which makes HMR impossible.\n. HMR is not a concern of the sass-loader. Thx for reporting this. I'll have a look as soon as I found some time. Unfortunately I'm loaded with work... :unamused:.\nIn the meantime, you can also take a look for yourself. The code is not complicated, but it requires some understanding about how to write loaders for webpack.\n. Is this still an issue with the recent version of sass-loader?\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. Mhmmm ... do you know how deasync works? I'm a bit afraid to merge this when deasync is messing with node's event loop. It looks like black magic to me :grinning: \nCan more people try this PR locally? If it fixes the current issues (and deasync is \"harmless\"), I am willing to merge it.\n. Issue fixed by #132.\nBut thank you for your effort and your proposal :+1:. Although I did not merge it, I do think that these contributions help to improve the code.\n. @oopschen Thx for investigating this! See PR for discussion.\n. Should be fixed with 1.0.3\n. That's a nice feature I was also already thinking about.\nThis should be doable with node-sass' custom importer. The sass-loader is already using it to plug-in webpack's file resolver. Acoording to node-sass' README, you can also specify an array of functions for importer.\nYou could try to prepend a JSON custom importer, which generates a SASS map if encounters a JSON-file. In all the other cases, it should return sass.NULL (according to node-sass' README). If you're successful, we can change the sass-loader so that anyone can prepend own custom importers (currently, importer would just be overwritten).\n. Thx for the pull-request. Please add tests that demonstrate what kind of bug you were trying to fix, so that future code changes won't regress this feature.\nI'll review the PR as soon as I found some time.\n. That looks good! :+1: I'll merge (and refactor) and publish it in a few days.\nSorry, I was not aware that the tests were not running for people cloning a fresh copy of the repository. It should work for everyone without extra work just by running npm test.\n. Shipped with 1.0.3\n. This probably requires a call of loadModule(). I need to find out if there is a synchronous version of that method.\n. I talked to @sokra and he's planing to deprecate synchronous loaders, which means we could use loadModule(). It was initially introduced to allow synchronous require() in node without compiling. The target: \"node\" config, however, is more practical in most real world use-cases.\nThen I need to clean up the code as it currently contains a lot of duplication and branching because of sync support.\n. Close?\n. That looks good, thx. :+1:\n. Shipped with 1.0.3\n. Didn't know that git supports file modes ^^\n. Thx :+1: \n. Fixed with 2.0.0\n. I've followed these discussions in several repositories.\nI think it's a huge benefit for all these \"plugin modules\" like the sass-loader if you can specify the exact Sass/LESS/grunt/gulp/whatever version. These \"plugin modules\" are just a thin layer between your app and another big library. It does not feel right if they bring this dependency in. And it's very time-consuming to handle all the \"bump version\" PRs :)\nI'm open for further discussion, but we won't change this soon. That's why I'll close this for now.\n. I see, we need to omit the source maps because otherwise webpack's source map comment would be ignored. Without .omitSourceMapUrl it looks like this:\n``` css\nbody {\n  background: lightgrey; }\n/# sourceMappingURL=test/output/sass.map /  <-- from node-sass\n/# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,.../  <-- from webpack\n``\n. Will be published soon. I just need to do some tests and I'll update the docs. Also related to #104.\n. Shipped with1.0.4`\n. Thx for your effort @DawidJanczak. Does https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/113 solve the same thing?\n. Anyway, thx! :+1: \n. Yes, a public example would be helpful. Besides that: Which version of sass-loader do you use? We've fixed some bugs with 1.0.3 concerning the import system.\n. Ok, thx. Then we need a test to reproduce it, so we won't introduce the regression again.\n. A minimal test setup would be more helpful. After 5 minutes I'm still cloning the repo... ^^\n. I've checked it on my virtual machine. Your example passes the sass-loader without error, but the css file is imported with an absolute path. This behavior is not intended (see #138).\nHowever, it should be no problem for the css-loader, but it seems like the css-loader is not able to recognize absolute Windows paths @sokra.\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Thx for the feedback. I've found the problem and I'm working on it...\n. Sorry, I didn't see the PR :(\nIt's already fixed in the master branch: https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/commit/3ae649b05dfbee2ca7d9d56cb8c130c1214d6196\n. Thx @jorrit. :+1: \nI've refactored the whole import stuff and tested it on windows, it works.\n. Does webpack recompile anything if you change a file? It could be that just HMR is not working.\nI don't know about a watcher bug... what is your OS? Are any Symlinks involved (like via npm link or bower link?\n. Is that a duplicate of #102?\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. I have added a chapter to the README about url():\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#problems-with-url\nIt's way more complicated than in LESS which provides a mechanism that rewrites urls...\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Should be fixed with 2.0.0\n. Nice! :+1:\nThx @jorrit \n. This is not an issue specific to the sass-loader so I'll close it. @tappleby thanks for providing an example setup.. Thx for your effort @endaaman. :+1: \nThe current master branch should fix your problem. However, I've used another approach because your PR adds files as dependency that might not exist anymore. This might be no problem, but I don't think that it's good coding style (no offence). But your PR was inspiration for the current solution :grinning:.\n. Could you guys check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Thx. That's what I wanted to hear :+1: :grinning:.\n. Shipped with 2.0.0\n. Thx for your effort :+1: \nI've added it manually to the master branch because I've refactored it a lot.\n. Could you check out the current master branch and check if it works for you? I've heavily refactored the import mechanism and need more tests.\n. Fixed with 2.0.0\n. There are tests for the indented syntax, so I expect it to work. Please provide a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.\n. Could you give me an example where the problem occurs? The paths are already normalized afaik.\n. Shipped with 2.0.1. Thanks! :+1: \n. Nice :grinning: \n. I did just skim through your source code and it looks good! :+1: You did even use urlToRequest(). Would you mind sending me a PR with the updated README? I would be happy to mention your loader.\nI was just wondering if this behavior could/should be part of the css-loader when source maps are present. In this case we could avoid parsing the CSS twice.\n. This is a problem of Sass in general afaik (see here and here). Could you check if the problem is also present when you're using node-sass directly? If that's the case, this is the probably the wrong repo for that issue.\n. There are helper mixins like sass-import-once which prevents double imports. However, this requires you to wrap your whole code with curly braces and to find a unique id for your module (usually the file path within the project). Personally, I find that too annoying.\nAfter fiddling around with double imports I found out that it's not actually a big problem. Gziping your static assets eliminates code duplication very efficiently. You can try that out for your specific case by creating two versions: one with sass-import-once and a gzipped one. Sure, in the final result, the gzipped version contains duplicated style rules. However, I bet the performance penalty would still not be measurable.\n\nbut I had thought the sass-loader was intercepting @import statements in Sass and could do something clever.\n\nYes, that would be possible and I'm actually planing to do something. However, rubysass is going to ship this with 4.0.0 and libsass will probably also follow. So I was hoping this would already be resolved by now :grin:.\nIf you are open to ditch Sass, I can also recommend LESS. I know, there are endless debates about Sass vs. LESS and in the end they are always pointless. However, there are two things LESS is actually handling better:\n- It's possible to import other files without including the actual CSS via @import (reference)\n- It's possible to rewrite url() statements thus enabling modules to just use the actual file path of an image or font without using some helper variable like $font-path.\nAnd in the end, Sass and LESS are very familiar. Actually, I'm using both in different projects and it's not a big deal.\n. Thx for sharing @kenotron :+1: \n. @MatthewKosloski this issue is not about the ordering of rules, please don't change the topic. I assume that you are using the extract-text-webpack-plugin. In this case, the order of rules dependents on the order of require() calls inside your bundle. Follow-up discussion at: https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues/200#issuecomment-251261145\n. Related performance discussion: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296#issuecomment-288464857. Why do you prepend . before button? Just write @import 'button'  or @import '_button.scss'\n. Mhmm the latest should be fine. Can anyone confirm this?\n. @jcreamer898 you should not need to adjust process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE. The sass-loader is queuing its tasks so that node-sass is not blocking all threads (until node-sass has resolved this).\n. Anyone still having problems?\n. Could you guys check if the branch fix/threadpool-issue fixes this problem while using the default process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE?\n. That's nice :+1: \nCould anyone reading this issue also check out the branch? I would like to pull it on the master, but I don't have a test setup that demonstrates the problem.\n. Yep, I've messed up this release by forgetting to move object-assign from devDependencies to dependencies. Just to test it you need to install object-assign manually.\nThx for trying it out :+1: \n. @lencioni your assumptions are right. Everything starting with ~ should be read from your modulesDirectories, usually node_modules.\nHowever, if you just write\njavascript\n@import '~config';\nwebpack will read config's package.json to get the main entry point which is usually a JS-file. Have you tried importing specific stuff by writing\njavascript\n@import '~config/variables.scss';\n?\nThere are tests for importing modules from paths starting with ~ which TravisCI also executes on Linux @mako-taco.\nCould you come up with a small test repository which demonstrates the actual problem?\n. @ceram1 Yep, I'm sorry. I was wrong. Travis CI is not activated because I'm not the owner of the repo. I use it in all my projects.\nConcerning your feedback:\n'node_modules/react-toolbox/lib/_colors' is another file than '~react-toolbox/lib/commons' :grin:. I'm pretty sure that this error is somehow related to your specific setup.\n. Could you provide an example?\n. resolve.modulesDirectories should only contain folder names, no actual paths. Webpack applies node's resolving algorithm with these folder names. It walks up the directories and tries each folder name:\na/b/node_modules\na/node_modules\nnode_modules\nWhat you probably want is resolve.root (which takes absolute paths!).\nBtw: That's why bower_components should be listed as resolve.root instead of modulesDirectories\nPlease set up a small example repo (using resolve.root) which demonstrates the problem. It makes debugging at lot of easier for me and it may help you pinning down the problem, if it's in your configuration.\n. You're welcome :grin: \n. The weird paths are created by the css-loader. Take a look at my PR for further information.\n. https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/pull/154\n. @jezstephens \n\nIt screws up the line numbers in Webpack's error messages by inserting additional lines into the input.\n\nThis should be reported to the import-glob-loader\n\nWhen used with no file extension it includes all files, so if you have Sass files mixed with other non-CSS files it's necessary to say foo//*.scss. This could be argued as a good thing, but I think it'd be more intuitive if foo//* was equivalent to foo/*/.scss\n\nYes, I think, it is a good thing to add the file extension explicitly.\n\nSo perhaps sass-loader could support Sass-specific globbing a bit better than import-glob-loader.\n\nI think the import-glob-loader is doing a pretty decent job here. I don't want to add this feature to the sass-loader because the import mechanism is already pretty complicated. Once we started to implement it here, we are responsible to maintain that feature.\n. I had this issue several times (webpack/less-loader#40 peerigon/markdown-loader#8). While passing the options via query parameters is cumbersome, I don't think that it would be a good idea to pass-in all options via the webpack config. It seems straight-forward, but the full module path + query string is used as cache id afaik. Hence, two require calls with different loader configs are recognized to be different.\nWhat do you think about it @sokra?\n. @sanniassin anyway, thx for your PR. I'm willing to merge this, but could you also add tests please?\n. Nevermind... I'll do it, because we need a better setup for these kind of tests.\n. @dtothefp It is necessary for options that can not be stringified using JSON.stringify\n. Shipped with 3.1.0. New preferred way for passing options is now via a property on your webpack config. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#sass-options\n. Thank you.\nThe last paragraph is implied by using the extract-text-webpack-plugin, so I'll remove it.\n. Sass is not downloading files afaik. So when you import an http url you won't be able to extend classes that are defined in these remote files. These imports will be resolved on runtime inside the browser.\n. Yep, #152 solves it. I just merged the PR, but we need tests :grinning:.\n. #152 shipped with 3.1.0. New preferred way for passing options is now via a property on your webpack config. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#sass-options\n. @kgwinnup Your webpack.config has a dependency which depends on a scss file.\n@typpo Thanks for pointing that out. Probably a common problem when creating isomorphic/universaljs apps.\n. Makes sense. Thx for pointing it out!\n. Will be shipped with #152, I just need to write tests for it.\n. Webpack puts all required files into one big js file by default. If you want to load code (like styles) on demand, you need to create a code split point by using an async require (will be System.import in Webpack 2).\nThis issue is not a sass-loader thing, though. \n. I'm using node 4.1 on OSX and could not observe these kind of errors. Could you provide a minimal test setup that reproduces the error? Otherwise I doubt that this repository is the right location for this issue.\n. Closing this for now because there is no example and it's probably not the right repository.\n. Do you have node-sass as dependency of your project? Since npm@3, peerDependencies won't be installed automatically anymore.\n. Thx for sharing this!\n. Mhmm you should be \"allowed\" to install that beta... is this a npm issue?\n. @Phoenixmatrix Thx for informing me :+1: \n. It's not a bug, @jsg2021 is mostly right. Though webpack is doing the file resolving, the output is kind of monolithic. That means that once Sass is done, webpack just receives one big blob of CSS without any trace of modules.\nSo, there are basically three ways to structure your styles:\n1. Have one monolithic main.scss\nAll the imports are done inside the main.scss.\nPros:\n\nNo code duplication if done right\nYou have complete control about the order how things are initialized\n\nCons:\n\nCan't be separated into vendor chunks or similiar\nNo incremental rebuilds because the whole stylesheet needs to be rebuild just for a single change\n\n2. Have on main.scss and on vendor.scss\nSimiliar to #1 but with manually separating vendor stuff from your application stuff.\nPros:\n\nTwo different chunks that can be cached separately\nYou have still complete control about the order how things are initialized\n\nCons:\n\nRebuilds are a bit faster, but still take some time\nReferencing/importing stuff from vendor styles into main.scss may duplicate code\n\n3. Truely modular styles\nEvery component has its own, independent Sass build. In order to avoid code duplication, you need to separate your Sass modules between modules which produce CSS code and modules which just provide variables and functionality like mixins. But imho that's best practice anyway.\nPros:\n\nFast rebuilds\nStyles are loaded \"on demand\"\n\nCons:\n\nThe initial build takes much longer because each component spawns its own Sass process\nPotential code duplication (which is usually not problem when using gzip)\nUsing the ExtractTextWebpackPlugin is counterproductive\n. That sounds pretty impossible to me. It's also not clear what problem you're trying to solve. Why should it be faster? What is actually slow?\n. > using a single Sass process could theoretically improve that.\n\nYep, but when using a single Sass process, modules would influence each other, yielding to unexpected output.\n. Thx for informing us.\nBut I don't think that we should merge this. It forces all users, who are not using node 4, to update their peerDependency. On the other hand, node 4 users are able to specify node-sass^3.3.3 as dependency and still use the current sass-loader, aren't they?\n. Shipped as breaking change with sass-loader 3.0.0\n. Sorry, specifying node-sass as peerDependency is far more useful for most users.\nSince node-sass/libsass processes your files, you should be able to specify the exact version you need. The sass-loader is just using an API which is not affected by most changes.\nIn other words: Your API surface to node-sass is much bigger than ours. Otherwise we would have tons of issues and PRs like \"Update node-sass to x.y.z plz\"\n. > I'm using npm3 now and it doesn't install node-sass automatically.\nI know and that's good. node-sass should be the dependency of your project.\n\nI could give you a ton of projects that do it.\n\nIt's true, people are handling this differently. And while there are projects where your suggested approach is very reasonable (like for the phantomjs-package for example), I don't think that it fits here.\nThe sass-loader is a link between webpack and node-sass. Following node-sass versions would ignore the fact that we also have to stay up-to-date with webpack: So, which version number should we follow then? Imho, the most robust solution to this problem is to have an own version number and to specify both as peerDependency.\nBut you're right. I forgot to add webpack as peerDependency. :grin: \n. I would love to hear alternatives from @iarna or @othiym23, but I guess there no new insights than already discussed at npm/npm#5080 npm/npm#6565 npm/npm#7495...\n. Thx for reporting this. This is probably caused by the \"funny\" file resolver.\n. Shipped with 3.1.0\n. Self-solving issues are the best :+1: \n. Thx. Since I've also changed the README, I added the change manually.\n. Thx for your PR :+1: \nI'm definitely planing to merge this, but it would be good if we'd follow the official recommendation for programmable objects in query parameters. The sass-loader should not try to require() the file, but just read it from the webpack config.\nThis is also related to #152 \n. Shipped with 3.1.0. New preferred way for passing options is now via a property on your webpack config. See https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#sass-options\n. Acccording to the node-sass docs, you should return sass.NULL if your custom importer doesn't want to handle the file. This passes the file request on to the next importer in the array.\n. If you don't return sass.NULL in cases you don't want to resolve the file, all webpack specific resolving won't be applied.\n. Could you please create a minimal example that demonstrates the problem? I'm using these comments all the time and there are no problems.\n. I'd appreciate an example :grin:. Furthermore, it's likely not an issue with sass-loader itself, but with node-sass or libsass.\n. We're using these comments in our tests, so it's not a generic issue. Please provide examples.\n. @djfm thanks for informing me\n@geekingfrog @ajsharp does that solve your issue?\n. In your configuration, the postcss-loader is executed before the sass-loader. Maybe PostCSS isn't able to parse SASS? :grin: \n. Ok, I think we can close this one?\n. Header.scss mixes CSS modules and tries to import stuff from Sass. This is not possible. Every import from a CSS file will not be compiled with the webpack loader pipeline. You can only import CSS files. Please stick to Sass or CSS modules. \n. Just put @import 'common/variables' at the beginning of your main.scss and everything should be fine.\nHowever, I don't get why you would like to have implicit imports/globals. Modular,re-usable code declares its dependencies explicitly.\n. Thx for reporting this.\nCould you come up with a minimal test example that reproduces the error?\n. Just remove stuff step by step until it's working again :grin: \n. It looks like GLOBBY.scss is not consumed by the sass-loader. This error happens when webpack tries to parse the file as JavaScript. And $white: \"white\"; is valid JavaScript :grin:\nHave you excluded the sass-loader for GLOBBY.scss?\n. The sass-loader does not resolve url() statements in your styles. You should chain the css-loader as described in the README.\nAlso take a look at the section about url() in the README.\n. I don't know. Why aren't you allowed to use the css-loader with Angular 2?\n. You could try to use the extract-loader, it evaluates a CommonJS module to generate a string. Chain the loaders like this:\n{\n    test: /\\.scss$/,\n    loaders: ['extract-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader']\n  },\n. That sounds like the sass-loader is not applied. The css-loader should not see any Sass imports.\nAlso, the error would be helpful.\n. Thx for sharing.\n. The build time heavily depends on how your styles are structured. I've described three different ways how to structure your styles.\n\nI suspect that this is because I'm using the ExtractTextPlugin\n\nI don't think so. The ExtractTextPlugin just \"extracts\" the CSS from the bundle (which is stored in a JS string). I don't see why that should take so much time.\n\nCan the sass-loader be configured to pre-fetch all scss and compile them async with node-sass while the rest of the compilation is working\n\nThe sass-loader is async, it does not block webpack. However, the sass-loader does not know your scss files until webpack encounters a require() and invokes the sass-loader.\nYou could modify the sass-loader in your project to track when the sass-loader is actually invoked and how much time it spends on waiting for node-sass to compile. Then you could compare these figures against \"vanilla\" node-sass compilations. If they're almost identical, it's node-sass which takes so much time...\n. Thx @Phoenixmatrix for your insights :+1:\nIf the new css-loader is so much slower, it should probably be addressed as issue. Though CSS modules are a nice feature, it should not degrade the performance of those who don't want to use it.\n\nIf you do not need url resolution (common in development)\n\nI don't get that... For me, url resolution is one of the reasons I would like to compile my styles via Webpack. And why would you like to have url resolution in production when you don't use it in development?\n. Closing this in favor of #296 \nI also did some profiling: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296#issuecomment-288464857. Thx for your PR.\nI understand your motivation, but the style- and css-loader are not essential to use the sass-loader. It depends on what you are trying to achieve. It may be perfectly fine for people to use the sass-loader just with the css-loader or even just with the raw-loader.\nSince most people will use it in conjunction with the style- and the css-loader, they are mentioned just a few lines below your changes.\n. I'm sorry. object-assign was in devDependencies :(. Fixed with 3.1.1\n. Thx. It is already shipped with 3.1.1 :grin: \n. Thx for the pull-request. Have you executed the tests after updating it?\nI get \nError: It's not clear which file to import for '@import \"../node_modules/order/1/module\"'.\nCandidates:\n  ../node_modules/order/1/_module.scss\n  ../node_modules/order/1/_module.sass\n  ../node_modules/order/1/_module.css\n  ../node_modules/order/1/module.scss\n  ../node_modules/order/1/module.sass\n  ../node_modules/order/1/module.css\nPlease delete or rename all but one of these files.\nwhich is a good thing, because it seems like they have finally decided to throw an error in these cases.\n. Haha, that's exactly what I did yesterday evening :grinning:.\nAnyway, thx. I'll pull in your commits. But now I need to remove the \"funny resolving algorithm\".\n. Thx @chicoxyzzy. I'll merge it as soon as I've found some time.\n@ChrisCinelli node-sass is a peerDependency. You should be able to bump the version in your project independently (as long as it is not a major version bump). That's why we've made it a peerDependency\n. Shipped with 3.1.2\n. I don't get the question but I doubt that this is actually a bug of sass-loader.\n. > But I noticed bundle files generated (not source map) are larger than bundle files generated without sourceMap like below. (40 to 50 percent larger, 500 KB becomes 900 KB)\nThat is correct, because the source map contains the original source code (stored in the contents property). This is because then you don't need to map source map paths to your file system in your developer tools. They just work.\nIf you do not want to include the original source code (e.g. because you want to use source maps in production), you should disable the sourceMapContents-flag. In this case, the source map will only contain mapping information.\nWe should mention that in the README, though...\n. Starting with sass-loader 3.2.0, you don't need to set it explicitly. It will derive it from the file name.\n. Do you use the .sass file extension? Can you please provide a small test case that demonstrates the problem?. Thx! Shipped with 3.1.2\n. Thank you for your pull-request.\nCould you add a small paragraph to the README describing the feature (e.g. with a use-case)?\n. We could publish sass-loader's internal functions to the context so that you can use the same functions.\n. Mhmm I'm not sure about this feature anymore. It provides access to an API where things might break easily. I don't want to make a major version bump when I'm refactoring internal functions.\n. Thx for pointing out theo. It looks very interesting (although I'm a little disappointed that it's a gulp plugin \u2013 it could also be just a small module without gulp dependency).\nI totally see the benefit. Maybe we could provide the loaderContext to the custom importer, so that you can write your own logic...\n. @mrfr0g thank you for your pull request and sorry for the response time, I haven't found the time to review it yet.\nWhat problem does this PR actually solve? I think it's a good thing to declare dependencies explicitly. We had global variables in the browser for a long time and I don't want to go back to this anymore. I think that a component should be truly self-contained. It should not expect global variables to be defined.\n. > I believe that I can accomplish the same result using the data option resolved in #216, or as @jsg2021 suggested, the baggage loader.\nAwesome :+1:  :grinning: \n. Why are absolute paths in source maps useful?\n. Thx for your pull-request.\nHowever, I don't understand why this is necessary. We already have a test case which covers this use-case. Why doesn't it work for you?\nCould you add a test that demonstrates the problem?\n. Any progress on this?\n. @jerrysu is module a dependency that is referenced in your package.json? See also https://github.com/nightgrey/web-boilerplate/pull/1\n. What is a pancake in this context? :grin:\n. Since it's unclear what this actually about, I'll close it for now. Could you create a small example project the demonstrates the problem? I assume that this is not related to the sass-loader, so it would be good to start with vanilla CSS.\n. Thx :+1: \n. Seems reasonable, thx :+1: \n. Shipped with v3.2.0\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. Thx for sharing this @timaschew \n. Seems to be a hot topic #215 #195 :grinning: \nAnyway, thx! :+1: \n. Thx for sharing\n. This seems like a limitation of node-sass. We're using node-sass' data option to pass Sass source code to node-sass. In this case, node-sass flags the data as stdin.\nWe would need to create a temporary file which we pass to node-sass. But this seems like an unnecessary detour to me.\n. Yes :grin: \nThat won't work, because the loader's test regex matches only scss-files. Why do you want to include that option in the README anyway? It's described in node-sass's readme.\n. Ok, now I do understand you.\nI used to have a small chapter about .sass-files, but then I read somewhere that it is deprecated (which is actually not true). I will re-add that small chapter.\nHowever, I encourage you to learn more about node-sass and the underlying dependencies of all webpack loaders. Because loaders are often just connectors between webpack and another tool. So it's not sufficient to just understand the loader.\nOne thing, for instance, what people need to know is that node-sass is build on libsass, which is a C-port of the famous ruby library. It is not actually Rubysass. However, it tries to stick to it as close as possible.\n. I think, #196 solves this \"issue\" as well\n. Seems like you have css module inside your node_modules. In this case, you should not use the convenient way of just writing loaders: [\"style\", \"css\", \"sass\"] because in this case, webpack first tries to resolve style, css, sass inside node_modules. After that, it appends the -loader postfix. So in your case, it tries to use the css module as css-loader.\nI think it's best practice to always write the full name, like style-loader, css-loader, sass-loader\n. Sorry, for me it's not clear what you are trying to achieve... why should the sass-loader also output sass code?\n. I think, the multi-loader was the missing piece :)\n. Please provide a small example project to demonstrate the issue. You can just commit the node_modules folder to simulate different packages.\n. @stigmat4j What language is this? Is :local legal in Sass?\n@storrdev @rickhanlonii @bipinshashi Looks like you were trying to import stylesheets in node. Maybe you're writing an isomorphic app? I would recommend to compile your node app with webpack too (using the node target option)\n. There are a lot of features from node-sass/libsass that one should take a look at. We just pipe all the options through, so I only added notes on options that might be webpack specific. If you feel like this is important, please create a PR.\n. > The child partial here would be able to access any variables exposed by the config file, but in sass-loader land, each stylesheet is treated as its own entity, meaning you can't do a global import.\nThis is not true. You can do global imports just like in regular sass. Please provide a minimal test example if you think this is a bug.\n. Yep.\nHowever, I don't recommend this kind of project structure. In my experience, explicit dependencies are always better than implicit ones.\n. > but its also silly to repeat yourself in every file of your project\nI don't think so. We all agreed that it's not good to use globals in JavaScript, why don't we adhere to the same principle in our stylesheets? It's a good thing to be explicit about the dependencies you are using. This way you always only import stuff that you are actual using.\n. > As far as the discussion above about importing variables or mixins into every file, I'm finding that if I import a sass file in three different sass modules, webpack is bundling three copies of that imported file. Importing modules in this manner appears to me to be pretty detrimental.\nThat's how Sass works by design. It's a compiler and every module is a distinct compilation. Usually, I split up my Sass modules in modules that are like libraries (they don't produce CSS code when imported) and modules that are like entry files. These are the Sass files that actually produce CSS code.. Thx for also writing down the solution for your case. I don't think that we should add a note on isomorphic apps since this is not related to the sass-loader at all.\n. The sass-loader works with webpack 2. I've added it to peerDepedencies starting with 3.2.1.\n. Thx :+1: \n. Sounds good :+1:\n@mrfr0g: Is this a solution for #191?\n. Shipped with v3.2.0\n. My advice:\nSeparate your Sass files into library files and application files. This means that you have Sass files that will output CSS (your application files) and you have Sass files that provide variables and mixins for them, but don't produce any output. Then you write your application files in a modular way without implicit dependencies, but explicit ones which means that you can compile any application file and it will work without producing duplicate CSS.. Using webpack 1: If you add the UglifyJsPlugin to your webpack config, it will switch all loaders into minimize mode.\nUsing webpack 2: Now you are able to switch only specific loaders into minimize mode by using the LoaderOptionsPlugin.\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/283\n. @janjon @elektronik2k5 Please don't use the modules_directories option for this. resolve.root is better for this purpose. module_directories will traverse all folders up to / similar like node does with node_modules.\n. This sounds like an issue in node-sass. We just get the complete source map from node-sass.\n. Does this PR fix your problem (install sass-loader 3.2.2)?\n. Should be fixed with #374. I know that the paths inside the source-map may be broken depending on your setup. Haven't found the time to look into it so far.\nHowever, I've merged a PR which resolved some issues with it. Maybe you could try sass-loader 3.2.2 and check if the problem is still there.\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. I think it makes sense to add the node_modules folder to node-sass' includePath option. After that, this code should work.\n. Thx for pointing out :+1: \n. There is no hint that this is related to the sass-loader at all. Try to isolate it and create a small example project. This makes debugging a lot easier. I don't know react-simpletabs so I can't help you here.\n. What about writing a custom importer?\n. Sorry, but we won't implement this as the resolution logic is already complicated and slow enough. See also #307 . Shipped with 3.2.1\n. Thx. Shipped with 3.2.1\n. That looks like a good idea! Can you create a PR + a small test-case for it? Just mention me in my PR and I will merge it asap.\n. Node-sass is a peer dependency. You should be able to specify any version in the range of ^3.4.2, so I don't really see the point in merging this.\nAnyway, I've updated the dev dependencies to the latest node-sass (3.8.0) and everything's working :+1: \n. Starting with npm@3, peerDependencies won't be installed automatically anymore, so it makes sense to list it as dev dependency.\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. What sass-loader folder are you talking about?\n. You can try webpack's resolve.root option. Just set the dist folder as resolve.root and you should be able to just write url(images/foo.jpg).\nI won't add any environment variables because this makes everything even a lot more hackier. The data option is already hacky enough.\n. Close?\n. If this a bug, please provide a small test example. I have too many requests so I won't prioritize this.\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. I've never seen an exclamation mark in a path my whole life ^^\n. If you want to provide an example, go ahead and create a PR\n. We are returning file instead of contents because of current source map file paths if I remember correctly. I'm not sure we can change that so easily.\n. Thx! :+1: \nI probably need to change this again because a loader should not access webpack options\n. Shipped as 3.2.2\n. Ok, I'll flag this version as broken, publish a new major release and then we can sort it out. No stress! \ud83d\udc4d \n@bholloway would you be open to make a PR to the sass-loader so that we have tests to check against the resolve-url-loader? Seems like more people are using it, so it would be nice to ensure compatibility. It was not obvious for me that this could be breaking change at all. If you do the PR, please mention me so I can merge it asap.\n. Shipped as 4.0.0\n. I've already published 3.2.3 which is identical to 3.2.1.\n. Thx. Shipped as #233 with 3.2.1\n. Please use Stackoverflow for questions using the webpack tag. This way, a much larger user-base is able to benefit from the answer and there are more people how actually answer it. If this is a bug report, please provide a small example project.\n. Yes, this was an unintentional breaking change with 3.2.2 (see #250). I've deprecated this version and published this change with 4.0.0.\n@bholloway and I will sort it out, but he is currently on vacation, so that may take a while.\n. That's correct, 3.2.2 and 4.0.0 contain the breaking commit. However, 3.2.2 was deprecated so I would expect that npm won't install it when specifying ^3.2.0 (but I don't know that for sure).\n. @judewang thanks for pointing out.\nNow I've published sass-loader@3.2.3 which is identical to 3.2.1. However, when you run npm i sass-loader, you will get 4.0.0 because it's still tagged as latest.\n. npm unpublish does only work if there are no dependent packages. Furthermore, if people happened to install 3.2.2 with --save-dev, it won't be available anymore. So, this was most unobtrusive way imho.\n. I agree, but unpublish would have been too late for you anyway. So I think the current solution is the best in all cases.\n. When using the query syntax, you must stick to regular URL escaping. So the official way would be:\njavascript\n`sass-loader?includePaths[]=${encodeURIComponent(path.resolve(__dirname, './styles'))}`\nSince this is stupid I always recommend to use JSON.stringify()\njavascript\n`sass-loader?${JSON.stringify({\n    compressed: true\n    includePaths: [ ... ]\n})}`\nWe know that configuring loaders is very complicated \ud83d\ude1e . We're currently working on that.\n. scss\n@import \"./other/file.scss\";\n. Please don't file an issue for this kind of questions. Github issues are used to track bugs. If you need advice, please ask a question on stack overflow.\n. You can also take a look at our tests. We have a lot of tests that check if importing files is working correctly.\n. I doubt that this is an issue of the sass-loader. Do you have a stack trace or anything? We also need a minimal example that demonstrates the error.\n. Thx for the PR. I currently have not sufficient rights to activate travis CI for this repo, but I've written @jtangelder a message.\n. I think @jtangelder 's PR is sufficient for us. Thx anyway @amilajack \ud83d\udc4d \n. This sounds very complicated and I don't think that it should be that way. My advice:\n- Don't serve your HTML over file://. There are a lot of cases where things behave differently and you will run in more issues than this. Do yourself a favor and serve your stuff over an HTTP server.\n- If you can't serve your stuff over HTTP by all means, you should not use the webpack-dev-server for development. Your development environment should be as close as possible to the production environment and file:// vs http:// is a huge difference.\n- If you really really need to use the file:// protocol: Why are you using webpack? Just split your stuff and put it somewhere on the disk. Webpack is a bundler and bundler put a lot of stuff into a few files to serve it efficiently over HTTP. If you don't have a roundtrip, I doubt that you need webpack at all.\n- My last advice: Maybe the <base> tag can help you.\n. Please file a question on stack overflow and include some example code. This way other developers may profit from the answer and we're actually able to answer it. There could be hundred of causes for this kind of error.\n. But I'm pretty sure that inside your folder C:\\Users\\che\nnhao\\Desktop\\code\\mean\\src there is no css/master.scss \ud83d\ude09 \n. Funnily, I've dealed with the same problem yesterday and that's how I tackled it. First you need a export-once function:\n``` sass\n$export-once-names: ();\n@function export-once($name) {\n    @if index($export-once-names, $name) {\n        @return false;\n    }\n    $export-once-names: append($export-once-names, $name) !global;\n    @return true;\n}\n```\nYou should use that function for all sass code that actually outputs CSS to ensure that no duplicates are added to the final stylesheet.\nThan you have a mixin to create the font-face declaration. I've removed some code that might be implementation dependent:\n``` sass\n@mixin font-face($family, $weight: regular, $style: normal, $stretch: normal) {\n@if export-once(\"font-face-#{$family}-#{$weight}-#{$style}-#{$stretch}\") {\n    // make sure the declarations will not be nested\n    @at-root {\n        @font-face {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nThen you have a mixin which applies a font-family and all its respective values to an element\n``` sass\n@mixin font-helvetica() {\n    @include font-face(\"Helvetica Neue\");\nfont-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\nfont-weight: regular;\nfont-style: normal;\nfont-stretch: normal;\n\n}\n@mixin font-helvetica-bold() {\n    @include font-face(\"Helvetica Neue\", $weight: bold);\nfont-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\nfont-weight: bold;\nfont-style: normal;\nfont-stretch: normal;\n\n}\n```\nNow everytime you want to use a font, you just have to include the given mixin and it will add the font-face declaration once to the stylesheet. This way you never include fonts that you don't use.\n. Sorry, I don't know. The sass-loader repository is definitely not the right place to discuss these things. But guessing from @xzyfer I think you do need to upgrade to 3.8 (which was never a problem in my projects).\n. It would be very helpful if you could setup a small example project which I can clone and run. Your description is still a bit vague.\n. Please provide a minimal test that demonstrates the problem. I'm using the webpack-dev-server in my setup and everything is working as expected.\n. Thx for your PR. I'm currently on vacation, so please be patient. I'll take a look in the end of August :)\n\nAm 11.08.2016 um 00:13 schrieb Chris Fitzgerald notifications@github.com:\n@jhnns, this should fix custom sass importers by passing resourcePath instead of stdin into the prev argument.\nFixes #234\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/267\nCommit Summary\nUse resoucePath for custom importers\nFile Changes\nM index.js (8)\nM test/tools/customImporter.js (3)\nPatch Links:\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/267.patch\nhttps://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/267.diff\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Awesome, that looks good. Thanks :)\n. Shipped as 4.0.1\n. Sorry, there is not enough information to reproduce this. Please provide a minimal test repository that demonstrates the problem so I can check that out. Try to remove as much stuff as possible since it helps tracking down the problem.. Is this problem still present with node-sass 4?. Since I can't reproduce it in our tests and it does not occur in my projects, I'll close it for now.. CSS source maps can only work if every loader in the loader chain passes them through. That's necessary because webpack, only supports JS source maps out of the box.\n\n@woohling Do you experience the same issue when you use this loader chain:\nstyle-loader?sourceMap!css-loader?sourceMap!sass?sourceMap&outputStyle=expanded&sourceMapContents=true'\n? . I can confirm the problem. You can test that with https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/374/commits/ce198d169d4a1066d214d40ba88fb0b5029c0536 and npm run test-source-map.\nUnfortunately, I don't know how to fix this since we don't actually mess with the source maps.. We receive the source maps directly from node-sass. But since the source maps are also processed by the css-loader and other loaders on the way, it's hard to say what's going on. Maybe they are incompatible?\nIt would be good if you could investigate this. Build the smallest project possible that reproduces the error and inspect the source maps in the sass-loader and then in the css-loader. You can use the style-loader to apply the styles to the DOM. The style-loader uses a BLOB url to make the source maps available to the browser. It does not change the source maps anymore, so that should be fine.. Thx for pointing it out. I took the essential parts and created a new PR #281\n. The segmentation fault is because one of the assertions inside the custom importer did not work. Unfortunately, node-sass is not reporting these errors to node.\n. Thx for your contribution.\nThe style-loader was never part of webpack core and is not required to use this library. You could also import the CSS as JS string and do something else with it. Especially when using the sass-loader in conjunction with the extract-text-webpack-plugin, the style-loader must not be in your loader chain.\n. The LoaderOptionsPlugin can be used to override the webpack options that can be accessed inside the loader via this.options. If you do that, you need to provide all the information the loader is reading from this object.\nUsually, you don't need to do that. It is just for compatibility reasons to give you the full control. In all regular cases, you can just use loader options (they are also called loader queries) in your loader configuration. The loader will read these options from this.query (unfortunate naming).. @vteivans as previously pointed out: If you're using the LoaderOptionsPlugin you also need to specify a context:\njs\n    new LoaderOptionsPlugin({\n       context: config.context\n    })\nBut you should not need the LoaderOptionsPlugin.. Sorry, this issue is too vague. There are a lot of tests that demonstrate that imports are handled correctly.. Thanks for the PR, but I'll try to get rid of context entirely. See #313 . When you write\n@import '~@technologyadvice/radiant';\nwebpack will search at ./node_modules/@technologyadvice/radiant for the module \u2013 exactly like dependencies in node are resolved. What were you expecting?\n. What does the main field of the radiant's package.json say?\n. I assume that this is a webpack problem because the sass-loader is not resolving it. Could you create a minimal example that reproduces the error? Just commit a small example node_modules folder with the folder structure. Try to remove as much as possible.. This has nothing to do with the sass-loader\n. Related to: #307 . Based on this discussion, I started profiling an example project yesterday and had some interesting insights. First of all, the sass-loader performance (49.2s) is completely unacceptable compared to fast-sass-loader (5.29s) or even bare node-sass (2.25s) from the command line. All three toolchains compile the same source code and produce similar output. We can expect some overhead coming from webpack since we need to initialize it, set up the loader pipeline, etc., but even the fast-sass-loader is unacceptable slow compared to bare node-sass in my opinion.\nOverview\nSo let's take a look at the flame graphs:\n\nFirst of all, as you can see, node-sass is spending most of the time outside of Node.js which is what we expected, since the hard work is done by Libsass.\nNow, let's take a look at both sass-loaders. The execution can roughly be divided into five phases (indicated as black boxes in the graph) that I will discuss in detail later:\n\nwebpack initialization\nfirst execution sass-loader\nfirst execution css-loader\nsecond execution sass-loader (this block is not visible in the fast-sass-loader graph, reasons below)\nsecond execution css-loader\n\nSo, the first surprise here is that we have two separate compilations going on. This is due to the extract-text-webpack-plugin which initiates a child compilation. Tbh, I'm not sure why this is necessary at all. @sokra can give us more insights here.\nThe second surprise is, that the second compilation doesn't use the cache from the first compilation. In the sass-loader graph, you can clearly see that the second pass takes almost exactly the same amount of time. This could be improved a little bit because the sass-loader is currently not using webpack's fs cache, but that would only reduce the second sass-loader execution time (4.), which is not where most of the time is spent.\nThe most time, however, is spent\u2014and that's the third surprise\u2014inside the css-loader. You can clearly see that in both graphs. It takes up half of the total time in the fast-sass-loader setup, and even more in the sass-loader setup.\nIt might also be surprising that node-sass and webpack + fast-sass-loader take almost the same amount of time to compile. In the flame graphs, you can clearly see that node-sass finishes almost at the same time where the 2. block of the fast-sass-loader graph ends. However, we need to remember that the fast-sass-loader is deduping all files before compilation, so there's far less to compile.\n\nNow, let's take a look at all the phases in detail.\nPhase 1: Webpack initialization & loader execution start\n\nNo big surprise here: The initialization of both setups takes almost the same amount of time. Differences here are probably due to I/O or general OS flakyness because there is no actual difference between both loaders here.\nYou can clearly see that during the first 1000ms, most of the time is spent requiring modules. That's why webpack almost always takes at least 1s to compile\u2014even with the simplest setup. Maybe we could win something here with lazy requiring ala lazy-req.\nPhase 2: Import resolving & sass compilation (1. compilation)\n\nNow that looks different!\nFirst, let's look at the sass-loader: The sass-loader registers a custom importer and kicks off the compilation. Now, we're essentially waiting for Libsass to call back. You can clearly see that there is a lot of back-and-forth going on with recurring breaks (grey bars) where the process is just sitting and waiting for Libsass. This graph led me to the assumption that Libsass might be doing sequential I/O. Concurrent I/O would look different, I suppose. After all the resolving is done, Libsass is performing the actual compilation and we're just waiting for Libsass to call back. Nothing to optimize here.\nNow, let's look at the fast-sass-loader: The fast-sass-loader preparses the source code with regexps for import statements and passes all imports to webpack's resolver. After the import paths have been resolved, the imported files are read from disk via node's fs module and then replaced with their import statements. Duplicated imports are simply omitted, only the first occurence gets included. This is way faster than the sass-loader, which shows that webpack's resolver is not the bottleneck. In fact, it's really fast and almost negligible in the graph.\nThe actual Sass compilation is also a lot faster since a lot of imports have been deduped. It's just that Libsass has less to parse.\nPhase 3: css-loader (1. compilation)\n\nThis phase is the most interesting one because:\n\nit takes up most of the time\nthere is nothing the sass-loader or the fast-sass-loader can do\n\nThe only difference is that the amount of data is very different. The fast-sass-loader produces a string with length 627067, the sass-loader with 6914854. This is 11 times longer. And this translates roughly to the amount of time. The css-loader takes 11 times longer processing the output from the sass-loader.\nThere are two things that I found surprising:\n\n\nWhy does the css-loader take so long? In this case, it is only required to translate the CSS into a CommonJS module while transforming all url() statements and remaining @import into require(). To me, this task seems a lot more trivial than the Sass compilation. The funny thing is: We're spending 9.6s just inside postcss-modules-local-by-default during the first compilation. In total, we're spending 16.29s there \u2013 and we didn't even ask for CSS modules... And that's just the first postcss plugin. The thread is completely busy for 13s in the first compilation while processing postcss plugins without any chance for other tasks. In total: 26s just inside postcss, hogging the CPU.\n\n\nWhy is postcss busy with generating source maps? We didn't ask for source maps... then I took a look at the css-loader: This call applies the map option irregardless of an inputMap. In fact, inputMap is undefined in this case, but we're still telling postcss to generate a map. As an experiment, I set map: false and was able to shave off 10s in total\u2014just by setting one flag. It's still crazy that source maps take up 10s. Switching source maps on and off with node-sass makes a difference of 150ms.\n\n\nPhase 4: sass-loader & css-loader (2. compilation)\n\nThe sass-loader performs exactly the same compilation again. No results from the first compilation are re-used.\nThe fast-sass-loader skips the second Sass compilation because it uses its own cache. That's a nice shortcut, but this should be fixed in webpack.\nI don't understand why we need a second compilation. And if we need the second one, can't we just skip the first one? This seems redundant.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe spend 1s just requiring webpack modules and loaders and initializing the loader pipeline. This could possibly be improved with a tool like lazy-req.\nThe sass-loader could be improved by:\npreparsing and resolving all dependencies. While this might seem like a good idea, there are also problems: 1. The source maps will be incorrect. 2. Errors won't be reported at the correct location. It all boils down to the fact that Libsass doesn't know the original location of the source anymore.\nusing the webpack cache when resolving the file. A custom importer is also allowed to pass the actual source to Libsass. This way, we could use webpack's internal fs caching layer.\ndeduping dependencies. This could be achieved by passing an empty string if the custom importer has resolved a resource for the second time. While this operation is not entirely safe, it will most likely do more good than bad in most cases. I'd say: if the specificity relies on the correct source order, there's a bigger problem.\n\n\nThe css-loader could be improved by:\nusing a simpler pipeline for CSS files that are not CSS modules. This performance penalty is not acceptable.\nonly generating source maps when they are actually requested\n\"somehow\" improving the postcss pipeline. Blocking the process for 13s is not acceptable, even for CSS modules. I don't know how we can improve that. Maybe postcss is applying the plugins in an unfortunate way?\n\n\nThe extract-text-webpack-plugin could be improved by:\ngetting rid of the second compilation\nor using cached loader results where possible\n\n\n\nHere are both CPU profiles. Load them into your Chrome Developer Tools if you want to take a look for yourself.\ncpuprofiles.zip\n\nThis was bothering me for a long time because I think we can do a lot better than that :grin:. As comparison, the sass-loader setup with css-loader@0.14 takes 10.1s and looks like this:\n\nsass-loader-old-css-loader.cpuprofile.zip\n. As @sokra pointed out: With the allChunks: true option...\njs\n    new ExtractTextPlugin({\n      filename: '[name].css',\n      allChunks: true\n    })\nthe second compilation can be skipped:\n\nthus reducing the built time to 23.9s\n. Run\nbash\nnode --inspect-brk ./node_modules/.bin/webpack\nto start the debugging process. The process will halt at the first line and print a debugger URL. Copy the debugger URL into the Chrome Browser and the developers tools will initialize.\nThen go to the JavaScript profiler tab and start profiling :)\nAfter you've pressed stop, the flame graph will be generated.\nIf you don't want to copy debugger URLs around, you can also use the NIM chrome extension. It discovers debuggable node processes automatically.. Not directly related to this thread, but also interesting: Looks like the most recent v8 version (with their new optimizing compiler TurboFan) gives a startup performance boost of 160% (1150ms vs 720ms).\nUsing v8/node, phase 1 looks like this:\n\nThe overall build time decreased from 49.2s to 41.35s (~119% faster).\nTurboFan doesn't bail out on try/catch which will probably improve the startup performance of all node applications because node is using try/catch to initialize the modules.. Afaik python is still a dependency of Node.js' gyp. Why should we get rid of it?\nYou could create a PR for that and make some performance tests.\n. You don't need the LoaderOptionsPlugin with sass-loader 5.0.0 anymore. All options can be passed as object with the options property (see README).\nWe still do access the webpack options object to read the context. This will not be possible with webpack 3 anymore. But since there isn't a good alternative yet, we still need to do that. This is an ongoing discussion but shouldn't concern you. :). js\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    module: {\n        rules: [{\n            test: /\\.scss$/,\n            use: [{\n                loader: \"style-loader\"\n            }, {\n                loader: \"css-loader\"\n            }, {\n                loader: \"sass-loader\",\n                options: { // <--- these options\n                    includePaths: [\"absolute/path/a\", \"absolute/path/b\"]\n                }\n            }]\n        }]\n    }\n};. No. LoaderOptionsPlugincan be used to mock/replace the webpack options that can be accessed inside the loader via this.options. With sass-loader, you don't need to do that. This was designed to be compatible with webpack 1 loaders.\nJust pass your options where you configure your loader (like in the example above). LoaderOptionsPlugin.output.path is the output.path from the webpack options. It has nothing to do with the sass-loader.. Sorry, I don't understand this. Why can't people use node > 6.5 with the sass-loader? In fact, I'm using node 7.1.0 and everything is working fine (I've also tested it with node 6.9.0).\nBesides that: Changing the peerDependencies is an unnecessary breaking change imho.\n. Haha, they're not typos. It's German grammar applied on English :)\nAnyway, thx \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for contributing \ud83d\udc4d \nHowever, I won't merge this change because it adds code to our code base that is not useful for every user. This should be provided by separate library. This way, our users are free to add these custom functions \u2013 or not.\nYou could publish this library for useful custom functions, write a good README about it and I can put a link to it in our README. You could also advertise this at the node-sass repository, because these functions are not restricted to webpack at all.. Thx for your feedback @anchann \nI'm considering this change, although I don't think it's right to pull this in. We should rather try to tackle the perf issues.\nUnfortunately, I can confirm that a lot of time can be spend on resolving. I've published a resolve-perf-tests that uses process.hrtime() and console.log()s to get some numbers and it seems like the sass-loader is spending 35% up to 73% of the time just to resolve files. This is unacceptable and should be solved at webpack level. However, I tried to reproduce these numbers in a bigger project and I couldn't. So, that remains a little vague. Maybe it's related to sass' complicated resolving algorithm involving underscore file names (_blahblah)\n240 seconds to 3 seconds are extreme numbers. Can you give me some hints on your directory structure and how you import stuff?. > takes forever, no output to shed light onto what's happening, yet calling tsc on the command line builds the project in seconds. I'd love to be proven wrong, but until then, logging my findings for the next dev is the best I can hope for :)\nWe already heard of builds taking minutes to finish. Unfortunately, we don't have complex example projects to replicate these issues. My projects usually finish after max. 20 seconds in production mode, but they're medium sized.\n\nwebpack's resolution seems to add nothing in terms of functionality, though perhaps it does add something in terms of uniformity (that said, uniform opaqueness is not necessarily a good thing)\n\nSince webpack provides its own resolving algorithm, I felt that it would be consistent for the developer to configure all resolving stuff in your webpack.config. It's true that this uniformity is not acceptable at the current performance cost, so I understand your argument here.\n\nAlso, importers are labelled as experimental in node-sass' documentation. Would it not make sense to make the use of an experimental feature optional, specifically because the upstream library labels it as a \"use with caution\" feature? I would personally go as far as making it disabled by default, and only enabled when a user knows that they explicitly want the feature.\n\nOur importer is well-tested and works without errors, so I don't see the need to declare this as an experimental thing.\n\nI don't think that's the case \u2014 disabling the webpack importer leaves sass' native underscore resolution intact, does it not?\n\nOnce we use our own importer, sass' native importing algorithm is not available. That's why we have to replicate it (and it's unnecessary complex \ud83d\ude22)\n\nOr, if it's easier for you, you can give me a custom version of sass-loader with whatever instrumentation you want, and I'll send you the output data.\n\nCould you use the sass-loader from the resolve-perf-tests branch and tell me the last output (it's accumulating all numbers)?. Could you check if the import is still slow when you change UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE to a big number (like 200)?\nJust set the environment variable before calling webpack.. Thx for your efforts. This helps me a lot! \ud83d\udc4d \n\nTo be honest, I didn't even want to do this test when I saw the variable name, since it sounded like a poor quality sledgehammer approach to the problem.\n\nNo worries! This won't be the final solution. I just wanted to check if it might be a problem that node-sass eats up almost all available threads for file IO. There was a problem in libsass that caused a deadlock (#100 #147) which was the reason why we had to use async's job queue. This way, node-sass still leaves one thread available for node.js \u2013\u00a0which is also the only thread for webpack's file IO. Thus webpack can only resolve files sequentially. And I think your numbers confirm my assumption. For instance, take a look at RaisedButton.scss. In your original setup, it only takes 200ms. But with all the file IO going on it is delayed up to 9000ms.\n\nI still firmly believe that even if resolving the problem internally inside webpack is the philosophically correct thing to do, given that lib-sass has a working solution to accommodate aliasing via import paths, sass-loader should provide its users with an escape hatch in case they want one.\n\nwebpack's resolving engine is more powerful than node-sass' includePaths. For instance, you can also alias paths (you can't do that with node-sass). And hopefully with webpack 2 you will also be able to @import JS files in order to translate JS variables into Sass variables. But I agree that for most use-cases, node-sass' includePaths is totally sufficient.\nMy current approach is:\n\nTry to understand why we are currently slower\nTry to find a simple solution to make webpack almost as fast as node-sass. It will always be a little bit slower because there is more going on behind the scenes. But it should not make a big difference\nIf I can find a simple and fast solution, I will provide a flag to disable webpack's resolving engine. I don't want to add too much options because it makes everything more complicated. But if we can't make sass-loader faster, we should definitely allow that option.. I did some profiling: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296#issuecomment-288464857. includePaths is only working for sass imports. url() statements are left untouched by the sass-loader. The css-loader will try to resolve url() statements, and a statement like url('images/logo.svg'); will be translated to url('./images/logo.svg'); because the CSS syntax does not distinguish between module imports and relative imports.\n\nIf you really want this behavior, you need to write url('/images/logo.svg'); and use the root option of the css-loader like this:\nmodule: {\n    loaders: [{\n      test: /\\.scss$/,\n      loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract([\n        'css-loader?' + JSON.stringify({\n          root: path.join(__dirname, 'images')\n         }),\n        'sass-loader'].join('!'))\n    }]\n  }\nHowever, I don't really recommend this because it defeats the purpose of using webpack for stylesheets. If you need to build it this way, maybe it's not a good idea to use webpack for the stylesheets.. @Nexxado the option is called sourceMap without s. Also for the css-loader.\nSee example. Closing this one since it is not an actual bug description. We know that source maps do work with webpack 2 and sass-loader. However, there can be issues depending on the language features you are using, like #351. @clintonb cool thx.\nPlease also add -loader to sass and I will merge it. Webpack 2 removed this shorthand because it was a source of bugs for newcomers.. Awesome. Yeah, that makes sense. I didn't realize that you need the sass instance to access their types. Would you be open to do a PR? Please also write a small test and a note in the README for that.. Wait ... is this change really necessary? Why couldn't you just require node-sass in your project? It's a peer dependency and should return the exact same object.. I assume that this is somehow related to your setup. When using --watch, webpack will only rebuild the files that had an error. Can you try to provide a minimal example repository that demonstrates the problem?\nPlease note that we can only recompile starting from the entry SASS file. So, if you have one monolithic SASS file with a lot of imports, we need to rebuild that one \u2013\u00a0even when the syntax error was just in a little file that was imported. Unfortunately, that's the way how the SASS language was designed.. Thank you for your PR.\nTBH I don't know why we're overwriting sourceRoot here. Maybe it wasn't set to the time I tried the source maps. However, it seems like there is an sourceMapRoot option in node-sass. We should use that one if its set.\nCould you check the following things:\n\nWhat is the value of sourceRoot when the sourceMapRoot option is not set?\nIs the value of sourceRoot correct when the sourceMapRoot option is set?. I won't add a new option to the sass-loader, because this should passed directly to node-sass as sourceMapRoot option. But I won't override map.sourceRoot anymore when it's defined.. Thanks for the suggestion, but this is clearly related to your setup. Your suggestion won't work with webpack 2.. I'm pretty confident that the sass-loader is not changing the order. We have a lot of tests for that. Please remove every other loader and try to remove as much code as possible while the error still occurs. This will help to track down the problem.. Thx. Shipped with 4.1.0. Nice example of how \"fixing a bug can be a breaking change\".. \"Fixed\" since node-sass 4 was no valid peer dependency.. Sorry. There are tests for nested imports and I use them every day, so I doubt that this is related to the sass-loader.\n\nPlease create a minimal example and instructions on how to reproduce the error. I'll reopen this, if it's a confirmed problem with the sass-loader.\nSince this is an error in the C stack, I assume that you're using a custom importer which throws an error.. There's no entry point. Please take a look at our unit tests and examples to get a working example.. Sorry, this is no WebStorm support forum.\nBesides that, it works in my WebStorm:\n\n. Strange. I do have multiple entry points and I never experienced this Stack level too deep error. Would be nice to reproduce it reliably...\nI'm thinking of moving node-sass into a separate process. Do you think this might solve it?. For background information: node 0.12 maintenance support will end on 2016/12/31. Yes, it's a duplicate.. By prepending the string with exclamation mark, you can disable the loaders configured in the webpack.config.js.\nHowever, it is recommended to use the webpack.config.js anyway. The inline syntax should only be used in certain exceptions. That's why I removed it from the README.. You don't need to add a blob url. Please reference your fonts relatively and use the file-loader.. Sorry, there is not enough information to reproduce this. Please provide a minimal test repository that demonstrates the problem so I can check that out. Try to remove as much stuff as possible since it helps tracking down the problem.. No idea \ud83d\ude01 \nThx for submitting your patch.. Have you tried fiddling around with webpack's resolving options? The sass-loader uses webpack's resolving engine, so that should work (in theory). I haven't tests for that, though.. Please provide a small example repository that demonstrates the error. Could you also check if the error is still there without the sass-loader?. @maggo thanks for the example repo. The processed source map contains a negative column number. I don't know how we can fix that since these column numbers come from node-sass.\nI've tried to compile the index.scss with node-sass itself and it seems to work, so maybe that's an issue with webpack's source map consumer :(\nI think, this is also related to #272 . @albertogasparin awesome! This is a good starting point to locate the error. Unfortunately, I don't have time for that now, but I would be glad if someone of you could tackle it.\nCrazy, I've never seen mixins and & used together:\n```scss\n@mixin FormField {\n  position: relative;\n  display: flex;\n  line-height: $Pollicino-FormField-height;\n&-label {     // <---- that's where the error is coming from\n``\n. @cj if you useurl()in an import statement, node-sass won't touch this import anymore. It will be passed to the css-loader as it is. The css-loader, however, will try to resolve it, thus triggering another sass compilation with thescss/mixin` as entry.\nAs a result, you might end up with a lot of duplicate css code in your bundle.\n@hiroshishu Since there is no stack trace, it seems like this error occurs somewhere between JS and native code. Do you use the importer or the function option?. This is definitely not a sass-loader problem.\nWhy are you using a mixin for the box-shadow anyway? It's supported in all major browsers.. Again, not a sass-loader issue. Check the transition mixin (you don't need a mixin for that too).. That would be awesome. Could you create a PR? \ud83d\udc4d \nJust create a directory called examples (thus it will be ignored by npm as configured in the .npmignore). Please also setup eslint for the examples directory.. I've added a test case for animate.css. It works fine.\nJust remove the includePaths option and use the tilde path to import stuff from node_modules, like this:\n```\n@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-flex';\n@import '~animatewithsass/animate.scss';\n@import '~animate.css/animate.css';\n```. > but with tilde (~) the imported file is not in webpack's chunk\nIt's just another way of referencing it. The CSS will definitely be in webpack's chunk (whatever that is).. The file must have the sass extension if it's written in sass syntax. Try to narrow down the exact file, that is causing the issue and try to compile it with node-sass. Does it work with node-sass?. You don't need to set the option explicitly anymore. The sass-loader derives it automatically for files ending on .sass. The webpack.config.js cannot use webpack features. It is executed in node and can only contain node compatible code.. You're importing a SCSS file in your webpack.config:\njs\nvar sass = require(\"./sass/lifeleveler.scss\");\nNode cannot import SCSS files. It does not support loaders.. Which docs? Which plugin?. This is a loader. Loaders are different than webpack plugins.\n\nI'm using the exact code from the docs...\n\nThere is no part in the docs where a sass file is included into the webpack config. Why would you want to do that anyway? ^^. The LoaderOptionsPlugin should not be necessary, see my comment here.\nWe have a test for includePaths. It should work the way you described it. Could you create a minimal example repo that reproduces the error?. @asolopovas with sass-loader 4.1.1 and webpack 2.2.1, both config examples work.\nWith sass-loader 5.0.1, webpack.config.js does not work because the sass-loader doesn't read the config from the webpack options object anymore. You don't need to use the LoaderOptionsPlugin with sass-loader 5.0.0 anymore. Just specify the loader options directly. Thus, webpack.config.error.js does work.. Also check out our tests..

I don't know what the vue-loader is doing, but if I remove the sass-loader and just try to compileApp.vue` the same error is still there. So this is not related to the sass-loader.. The sass-loader has its own loader pipeline. This configuration fixed the issue:\n{\n                test: /\\.vue$/,\n                loader: 'vue-loader',\n                options: {\n                    loaders: {\n                        scss: 'vue-style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader?' + JSON.stringify({\n                            includePaths: [\n                                path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/foundation-sites/scss'),\n                            ]\n                        }), // <style lang=\"scss\">\n                        sass: 'vue-style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader?indentedSyntax' // <style lang=\"sass\">\n                    }\n                }\n            }. > A hack solution is definitely better then no solution thanks\nOh, I don't think that this is a hack solution. Since a vue file can host a lot of file types, it makes sense to have a dedicated loader pipeline because webpack's loader test algorithm wouldn't work here.. If you have a .babelrc or a tsconfig.json inside your root folder, they are reading the config from these files. But this is loader specific since the tools behind these loaders (babel and typescript) have the same style of configuration. It doesn't apply to all loaders..

No problem. You're welcome :)\nI'm willing to help if the other side is providing a test repository. This makes spotting bugs/wrong configurations a lot easier.. Thx, I'll take a look.. Haha, nice one! Seems like you've encountered a bug/unexpected behavior of the loader-utils. Starting with commit e6dc9c1daa02b1c87d9431e77c7ae9771b22f80b, the loader utils will recognize loader options objects and just return them.\nHowever, inside the sass-loader, I expected to always get a new object when calling parseQuery. That's why I modify the received options object. Thus, data will accumulate all sass files if the loader is executed multiple times.. This will bloat a lot of CSS files... working on a quickfix.. A fix should ship with 5.0.1. Are you using the css-loader and the file-loader? In that case, you don't need to configure anything. The file-loader will hash all files automatically.. If you're using the css-loader, have you enabled the url option (default is enabled, but maybe you've disabled it)?. https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/css-bundle. Clone the repo, build the example running build.js and checkout the result in the js directory.\nThe final url will look like this. The referenced image will be copied to the output folder.. Apparently, the sass-loader is not applied to the file. Make sure, your loader configuration is valid. The pasted config looks ok, but maybe you've oversimplified it for this issue?\nPlease, also create a small example repository that demonstrates the problem with the sass-loader.. @wsfuller webpack only understands JavaScript. If there is no rule for a scss file, scss files will be treated as JavaScript.. I totally understand your frustration. I also think that the configuration is too complicated, but it's hard to have big changes without breaking a lot of code. However, we want to improve that, that's why we've started a discussion here.\nWe're also working on webpack-cli which will offer a convenient way to get things up running very quickly. We imagine things like webpack-cli add css-modules or webpack-cli add sass. The webpack configuration itself, however, will always be low-level because we believe that many developers also appreciate the flexibility to adjust things to their requirements.\nRegarding the documentation: If you're not satisfied with our guides, you can simply edit them (click on \"Edit this page\"). This will bring you to Github where you can edit the file and create a PR with one click. We really appreciate every contribution to the webpack.js.org repository. Contributions to our repositories are even refunded from our OpenCollective account (in case you're legally allowed to create invoices).. Sorry, there is not enough information to reproduce this. Please provide a minimal test repository that demonstrates the problem so I can check that out. Try to remove as much stuff as possible since it helps tracking down the problem.. I assume you are using the LoaderOptionsPlugin? Could you paste the configuration of that?\nThis will probably be fixed with the next patch version.. @bholloway this will again be breaking for the resolve-url-loader. I've created a PR for this: https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader/pull/44. These source maps are truly driving me crazy ^^\nCould you review https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/pull/377 and try it with your test setup? I think, now all paths should be correct.. @bholloway I've written a test that checks if all files in the source map can be resolved.. Thx for reviewing it.\n\nI believe that node-sass@>=4 has a problem with the source map. There are negative original mappings. For example:\n\nThat is a known problem. I don't know enough about source maps, whether that is valid. But it seems like the source maps from node-sass itself are interpreted correctly (tested on chrome). I assume that webpack's source-map module has problems with this, but I'm not sure.\n\nWhen content is not embedded then it will need to be served to the browser. So we should avoid ../ paths in the source-map. The shallowest common directory is usually process.cwd() (or close to it) so I think you are safe there.\n\nChrome allows to configure a directory mapping for source maps. Thus, source maps don't need to be served.\nThe problem here is that we don't know anything about the final source map destination inside the loader. That's why I think it's better to use relative paths with a sourceRoot. This way, the browser should be able to locate the actual source file on disk (only exception: The file is on a different hard drive).. You're using webpack 1 and are trying to install the latest sass-loader. We removed Webpack 1 support with sass-loader 5.0.0. You need to run npm i sass-loader@4.\nPlease also read about peer dependencies. The error is quite clear if you know the concept of peer dependencies.. The error looks like the sass-loader is not active on that file. Please check that. If you still think, this is a sass-loader issue, please provide a minimal example that reproduces the error. Try to remove as much as possible.. I'll close it for now. When you're sure, it's a sass-loader problem, I'll re-open it.. That is hell of a stack trace! :). If you prepend ~ to the import statement, it will use webpack's usual module resolving engine: @import \"~@barebone/var-z-index\". Awesome, thx :). Please provide more context. What is AoT? Do you have a code example that demonstrates the error?. This has been addressed with #398 and shipped with 6.0.3.. Looks like you're trying to import a scss file but you've only configured the sass-loader for sass files. That's the only thing I can spot with the given information.\n\nThings you should consider in the future before opening an issue:\n\nPlease format your issue with code blocks ```\nOmit stuff that is probably not relevant\nDon't omit stuff that could be helpful: Error message + stack trace for instance\n\nIf you want to help us to find the problem: Provide a small test repository that demonstrates the bug.\nIn case, you're not sure whether it's a bug or whether there's something wrong with your configuration, ask a question on StackOverflow an tag them with webpack or go to the webpack gitter channel.\nThank you :). The sass syntax is not compatible with css modules. You can escape the colon like this:\nsass\n\\:local(.container)\n  padding-top: 20px\nSee https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2245. Seems like your PR was based on a fork because there a lot of unrelated changes (see diff).\nI'm not sure about this, because our tests run against webpack 2, so we don't know when we introduce anything breaking. We also don't have the manpower to maintain compatibility for a long time. It's safer and less work if we only allow webpack 2.. Thanks for the work. This commit was pulled in with #398 \ud83d\udc4d . See #394 . Sorry. There is no explanation what you're trying to fix. Furthermore, your fix looks actually very broken:\n\n. Thx for creating a detailed report. This has been addressed with #398 and shipped with 6.0.3.. Awesome, that makes sense \ud83d\udc4d Didn't know the design was broken on the docs page.\nCould you do the same for the https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader? \ud83d\ude01 . Why should we support writing code that does not work across platforms? Windows accepts / as valid path separator, OSX and Linux systems do not. Why don't they use regular slashes?. Furthermore: I assume that Sass interprets backslashes as escape character. This means that you need to use double backslashes if you want to have a single backslash (exactly like in JavaScript). Have you read the section about problems with url()? Please also note that the README expects webpack 2.. To be honest, I'm not sure if aliases are supported. It should be supported afaik, but we have no test case for that.\nThx for reporting this. I will take a look.. @wsfuller does your setup have the same problem as @mortocks pointed out? If not, please provide a small test example that makes the error reproducible.\nYour config should probably also look like this:\nwebpack.config\n{\n    test: /\\.(s?)css$/,\n    use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n        fallback: 'style-loader',\n        use: ['css-loader', 'postcss-loader', 'resolve-url-loader', 'sass-loader'],\n    })\n  },\n\nThe postcss-loader can't deal with Sass.\n. You should be able to use the sass-loader 4.x with webpack 1. We dropped official support with sass-loader 5.x which means that it might work, but there is no guarantee. This is the sass-loader 4.x documentation.\nI recommend switching to webpack 2 as soon as possible since we don't have the manpower to maintain multiple versions. Additionally, I think the transition from webpack 1 to webpack 2 isn't as hard as it may seem. There were little breaking changes. Everything you need to know is documented in the migration guide.. Thx \ud83d\udc4d \nI don't know how this could happen.... Good catch! \ud83d\udc4d . > However, this only works for top level files. It appears that @require statements are not resolved by webpack.\n\nI've had a browse through the code base (very readable), but I don't have a full grasp of how this works now. Is it the case that files are piped through webpack when @required, or is this entirely handled by node-sass?\n\nWe register a custom importer which will be invoked by Libsass as soon as an @import statement is encountered.\nThen, we determine a list of file paths that we want to try. This is necessary in order to mimic the original Sass behavior of underscore imports.\nFor instance, this:\nsass\n@require 'variables'\nwill generate this list of possible imports to resolve:\njs\n[\n'/path/to/_variables.scss', '/path/to/_variables.sass', '/path/to/_variables.css',\n'/path/to/variables.scss', '/path/to/variables.sass', '/path/to/variables.css'\n]\nThese paths are then passed to webpack's resolver. In your setup, however, these paths won't be resolvable.\nThis can be fixed in two ways:\n1\nWe could add a check for scss.erb or sass.erb to the sass-loader. In this case, you would need to add the extension to your imports:\nsass\n@require 'variables.scss.erb'\n2\nYou could write a resolver plugin which transforms requests that end on .sass or .scss to sass.erb or scss.erb. You can also limit this to a specific directory.\n\nIf you choose option 1, I would like to learn a little bit about your use-case. What is the erb file extension about? Is it commonly used? What is this @require statement? This is not valid Sass afaik.\nIf you choose option 2, I can help you \ud83d\ude01 . That option looks good. It's not my most favorite solution, because ideally this could be handled by webpack's resolver itself, but since the sass-loader needs to mimic the original Sass' import behavior, we probably have to go this route. Configuring the importExtensions makes sense then.\nWaiting for your PR \ud83d\udc4d . Thx \ud83d\udc4d . Can you set up a small example repository that demonstrates the problem? Just ignoring the file doesn't really solve the issue, because then the watcher will not work at all.\nI want to understand why addNormalizedDependency is receiving a relative path. Is that a bug in Libsass?. Thanks for providing that example. I'll take a look.. @evilebottnawi Sorry for being unresponsive.\nI won't add any additional custom aliasing to the sass-loader since it is already complicated enough. If webpack's module.alias option would be more powerful, this could be solved by anyone.\nHowever, I think your use case should be solvable today by writing a custom importer for this particular file:\n```js\nconst nodeSass = require(\"node-sass\");\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    {\n        loader: \"sass-loader\",\n        options: {\n            importer: [\n                // url will be the string passed to @import\n                // prev is the file where the import was encountered\n                (url, prev) => (\n                    shouldBeAliased(url) ?\n                        { file: require.resolve(\"path/to/alias.sass\") } :\n                        // pass file to the next importer\n                        // the last importer is the webpack importer inserted by the sass-loader\n                        nodeSass.types.Null()\n                )\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\nI haven't tested this, but this should work. Please let me know if it actually did \ud83d\ude01. Or try out the node-sass-magic-importer which may solve this for you already...\nYou can also write a custom resolver for webpack, but this is more complicated:\n```js\nclass ResolverPlugin {\n    constructor(options) {\n        this.options = options;\n    }\n    apply(resolver) {\n        resolver.plugin(\"described-resolve\", (request, callback) => {\n            // request is an object that contains meta information about the resolve request\n            // request.request is a string that has been passed to the resolver, similar to url in the custom importer\n            // request.context.issuer is an absolute path to the file that wants to import the request\n        if (shouldBeAliased(request.request) === false) {\n            callback();\n\n            return;\n        }\n\n        resolver.doResolve(\n            \"resolve\",\n            Object.assign({}, request, {\n                request: require.resolve(\"path/to/alias.sass\")\n            }),\n            \"aliased sass file\",\n            callback\n        );\n    });\n}\n\n}\nmodule.exports = class AliasSassFilePlugin {\n    constructor(options) {\n        this.options = options;\n    }\napply(compiler) {\n    compiler.plugin(\"after-resolvers\", () => {\n        compiler.resolvers.normal.apply(new ResolverPlugin(this.options));\n    });\n}\n\n}\n``. @smrq you're right, the current loader configuration does not insert a module for each sass file into webpack's dependency graph, it just uses webpack's resolver. The less-loader already usesloadModule, but only for non-Less files in order to allow@import` of JS files for instance.\nHowever, I'm not sure if we should insert a module for each Sass file because there is no actual benefit besides the NormalModuleReplacementPlugin. It would just increase the memory usage...\nI think your use case can be solved with a resolver plugin, but unfortunately there is no easy (core-)plugin like the NormalModuleReplacementPlugin. @sokra what do you think? Should we add a resolver plugin to core?. ",

    "nickdima": "@jeffling are you sure sass source maps are supported?\nFrom looking at the code it doesn't seem so. cc @jtangelder \n. The reason source maps are not supported is that sass-loader passes the actual sass content to libsass and not a file, and it seems that libsass generates source maps only when a file is provided.\nI couldn't find this documented in the libsass wiki but there's a comment by @svnieuw that talks about this.\n\nlibsass currently only supports source maps with sass_file_context. The source file (input path) can only be specified as path and not as data string.\n\nMaybe we should specify this in the readme? cc @akiran @jhnns\n. I was also looking at this approach, I can try to make a PR.\n. OK, a quick update on this. The approach is doable the only barrier being that node-sass needs to support inlined file contents in the source maps. There's a discussion about it here.\n. How are you guys live reloading the css when using ExtractTextPlugin for having source maps support? I'm asking this since HMR doesn't work with ExtractTextPlugin.\n. But on dev you would want both source maps and hot/live reloading. How do you do that?\n. try like this:\njavascript\n{ test: /\\.scss$/, loader: \"style!css!sass?includePaths[]=\" + JSON.stringify(bourbon)},\n. Ah, ok, the error is in your sass files.

I investigated a bit trying various versions of node-sass.\nIt seems that the segmentation fault problem happens on node-sass > 1.1.0. With the previous version, which is 1.0.3 seems to be working fine.\nThe import problem was resolved with an update to foundation, so ignore that.\n. It seems to be fixed with the latest node-sass.\nI'm closing this.\n. @jhnns I'm still seeing this problem even with sass-loader@0.6. and node-sass@2.1.1\nIs there some feature I shouldn't be using or something?\n. @jeffling are you sure sass source maps are supported?\nFrom looking at the code it doesn't seem so. cc @jtangelder \n. The reason source maps are not supported is that sass-loader passes the actual sass content to libsass and not a file, and it seems that libsass generates source maps only when a file is provided.\nI couldn't find this documented in the libsass wiki but there's a comment by @svnieuw that talks about this.\n\nlibsass currently only supports source maps with sass_file_context. The source file (input path) can only be specified as path and not as data string.\n\nMaybe we should specify this in the readme? cc @akiran @jhnns\n. I was also looking at this approach, I can try to make a PR.\n. OK, a quick update on this. The approach is doable the only barrier being that node-sass needs to support inlined file contents in the source maps. There's a discussion about it here.\n. How are you guys live reloading the css when using ExtractTextPlugin for having source maps support? I'm asking this since HMR doesn't work with ExtractTextPlugin.\n. But on dev you would want both source maps and hot/live reloading. How do you do that?\n. try like this:\njavascript\n{ test: /\\.scss$/, loader: \"style!css!sass?includePaths[]=\" + JSON.stringify(bourbon)},\n. Ah, ok, the error is in your sass files. The import line should look like this: @import 'bourbon';\nAnd remove the JSON.stringify, it was ok in the first place, just fix the import. ;) \n.

Probably need to use the source map to determine original path or maybe it would be easier to update path prior to processing so output is correct? \nNow I understand why the relative path doesn't just work. Thanks\n. Setting icon path works, but you need to prefix the path with a ~:\n$icon-font-path: \"~bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/\";\n@import \"bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss\";\nIf you don't add the ~ then it gets translated to ./bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap.\nThanks!\n.

The 4 internal threads are occupied by node-sass and then sass-loader tries to import a file from the filesystem, which stalls until one of the threads becomes available. This never happens.\n. Mostly, yes. But maybe node-sass can work around it, but I am not certain.\n. Please see #132 for a possible fix.\n. Did you take a look at #132 ?\n. And thanks to you for testing!\n. Can you try the changes in PR #116 to see if it is fixed?\n. Does anyone know why there is a difference?\n. Which Windows version do you use @gabrielenosso?\n. I hope this fixes it.\n. It seems that this setup creates too many async operations, exhausting the internal libuv threads. For example, the following works:\nUV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=10 npm start\nNo idea how this can be fixed in sass-loader.\n. Seems the same as sass/node-sass#857.\n. Maybe sass-loader can limit the number of outstanding sass render calls to UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE - 1 via the async module or something (no idea if that makes sense).\nAt least let's write down this UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE workaround somewhere in the README.\n. This is also a duplicate of #100, by the way. Let's close this issue.\nCloses #119\n. Maybe you can add a comment to the line to explain why it is necessary, for future reference.\n.

If you change \"sass-loader\": \"^1.0.3\" to \"sass-loader\": \"jorrit/sass-loader#async\" in your package.json and do npm update, you should get the other version.

This could also be a mismatch when you build node-sass with a different node version than you're running sass-loader with. You should check that too. It seems you're running it with a lower version than the one you're building it with.\n. Are you absolutely sure that your program runs on node 4.0.0 and not some other version using nvm?\n. That could be because you didn't use any modules that must be compiled before sass-loader/node-sass.\n. Is this one fixed?\n. Is this bug still valid?\n. Is this still an issue?\n. The params are formatted like URI's. Have you tried URI encoding? It is just a guess.\n. I think webpack handles translating the input parameters so each plugin doesn't have to do that. It is the responsibility of the configuration writer to use the right syntax. Or maybe I am misunderstanding the thing you want to submit a PR about.\n. You can maybe try:\n{\n  test: /\\.scss$/,\n  loader: 'style!css!sass',\n  query: {\n    outputStyle: 'expanded',\n    includePaths: [\n        path.resolve(process.cwd(), \"node_modules\")\n    ]\n  }\n}\n. Does it work in 1.0.3?\n. Is this still an issue? Can you create a PR with just a test that fails because of this bug?\n. It looks like the maintainers are having a holiday. I hope they can review all PR's soon.\n. Either run your gulp command with UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=100 gulp or execute process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=100 in your gulp file before executing webpack.\n. It is explained by saper in sass/node-sass#857. The 4 internal threads are occupied by node-sass and then sass-loader tries to import a file from the filesystem, which stalls until one of the threads becomes available. This never happens.\n. Mostly, yes. But maybe node-sass can work around it, but I am not certain.\n. Please see #132 for a possible fix.\n. Did you take a look at #132 ?\n. And thanks to you for testing!\n. Can you try the changes in PR #116 to see if it is fixed?\n. Does anyone know why there is a difference?\n. Which Windows version do you use @gabrielenosso?\n. I hope this fixes it.\n. It seems that this setup creates too many async operations, exhausting the internal libuv threads. For example, the following works:\nUV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=10 npm start\nNo idea how this can be fixed in sass-loader.\n. Seems the same as sass/node-sass#857.\n. Maybe sass-loader can limit the number of outstanding sass render calls to UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE - 1 via the async module or something (no idea if that makes sense).\nAt least let's write down this UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE workaround somewhere in the README.\n. This is also a duplicate of #100, by the way. Let's close this issue.\nCloses #119\n. Maybe you can add a comment to the line to explain why it is necessary, for future reference.\n. You can use this guide to dquash your commits into one so it is easier to review http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request\n.

Is there no way to currently do this?\nI'm trying to make a loader that takes an object exported from a javascript file and turn it into a string of Sass variables\njs\n// colors.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  aquamarine: '#62D9B5',\n  turquoise: '#2EB6C9',\n  blastoise: '#3B88CD',\n}\nscss\n// _colors.scss\n@import '!sassify-loader!./colors.js'\n```scss\n// foo.scss\n@import './colors'\n.foo {\n  color: $blastoise;\n}\n```\nThe loader is pretty simple:\n``js\n// sassify-loader\nfunction sassify(obj, { prefix = '' } = {}) {\n  return Object.entries(obj).reduce((str, [key, value]) => {\n    return${str}$${prefix}${key}: ${value};\\n`\n  }, '')\n}\nmodule.exports = function loader(content) {\n  this.cacheable()\n  const options = Object.assign({ prefix: '' }, loaderUtils.getOptions(this))\n  const obj = this.exec(content, this.resourcePath)\n  const res = sassify(obj, options)\n  console.log(res)\n  return res\n}\n```\nI'm currently getting this error: File to import not found or unreadable: !sassify-loader!./colors.js., and it doesn't look like the loader function is ever being run.\nIf I do the import in a JS file, like \njs\nimport colors from '!sassify-loader!./colors.js'\nThe loader runs, I see the printout of console.log(res), but then the build fails with Module parse failed... Unexpected character '#'... You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type., which is probably because the file is just a string, not a JS file\nIf I alter the loader to be return `module.exports = ${JSON.stringify(res)}`, then I can import the file as a string into JS without a problem, but still get the same error when @importing in Sass.. From my understanding so far, it looks like the importer would have to detect if inline loaders are being used, have the specified loaders process the file, then give the result back to the node-sass importer done callback as { contents: result }..

Sorry for the long time we don't answer :smile: . @SleepWalker css-loader account all url, Can your describe or provide repo where not happening?. Apparently there is no for this universal and good solution. If someone has an idea how we can to implementing this, i will be glad to see this here https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296.. @rw3iss original node-sass works absolutely identical, to avoid double content use minificator. @bensampaio @adjavaherian Is there a problem so far?. @bensampaio where your can have process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE and why 100? :smile:  . @adjavaherian now v6.0.3 sass-loader :smile: .

Fell free to reopen issue if your problem not solved.. @thathurtabit yep, your should import variables/mixin/etc staff in each module, because it is module. To make it easier, you can create shared.scss (with variales, mixins, placeholders and etc) and include only one shared.scss file.. Two ways:\n1. Use common variables.scss file and include in every required file.\n2. Use https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader\nClose. If these solutions do not suit your, please write here about this and explain why.. @wzup use options property in loader. @cwagner22 can your create minimal reproducible test repo? Seems something is wrong in style-loader (or in webpack config)\n. /cc @donaldallen @cwagner22 friendly ping. I just tested this feature, it works fine. Closing due to inactivity. Please test with latest version and have correctly configuration. Thanks!. /cc @jhnns To be honest, I do not even represent a better solution than own importer for these projects, but maybe your have idea about this.

Please refactor your webpack config.\nAlso var sassOptions = getLoaderConfig(this); console.log(sassOptions); inside sass-loader output:\nincludePaths: [ '/paht/to/todomvc-angular-4/src/scss']\nWhich mean all options are respected inside sass-loader, your can have invalid @import 'something' in your styles.\n. Sorry but not related to sass-loader, also we have tests on includePaths option. Also you can notice below config is not right way, just use options property for each loader in your rules.. @zabojad \nloaders: [ \"style-loader\", \"css-loader?sourceMap\", 'sass-loader?{\"sourceMap\":true,\"includePaths\":[\"app/styles\"]}' ],\n            }\n        ],\nRefactor to\n{\n  test: /\\.s[ac]ss$/,\n  use: [\n    {\n        loader: \"style-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    },\n    {\n        loader: \"css-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    },\n    {\n        // Your also can avoid this loader if your don't need\n        loader: \"postcss-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    },\n    {\n        loader: \"sass-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    }\n  ]\n}. @dovidweisz already testing, just wait. @dovidweisz yep, I just wanted to write about this, just avoid to use `LoaderOptionsPlugin`, they still buggy and incompatibility with many thing.. @katiasmet please create new issue for this, don't write your problem(s) inside other problem(s), thanks!. @wsfuller in theory should work `['css-loader', 'postcss-loader', 'resolve-url-loader', 'sass-loader']`, if your provide minimal reproducible repo it give an opportunity to answer this question accurately (maybe something should be docs to avoid this issue).

Please test with latest version and feel free to reopen if still regressions.. @wsfuller Not entirely true, with this logic we must put this information in each `loader`, it is overloading docs, more right place information about this in https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/#loader-features (where you indicated). Btw thanks for using `webpack` :1st_place_medal: . @wsfuller Then you should create `migration-from-gulp-and-grunt.md` and move this docs in `webpack-docs`, not here. @wsfuller your can do PR and if docs will be good we can merge this :+1: . @maffelbaffel About `-p`shell\n  -p           shortcut for --optimize-minimize --define\n               process.env.NODE_ENV=\"production\"                       [boolean]\n``\nSeems your havecss-loaderand otherpostcss-pluginfor minification css (-penable their) and one of them does not work correctly. Can you provide minimal reproducible test repo?. Using only--optimize-minimize\u0441auses this problem, I investigate this. Problem innode-sass/libsass, just try to setupoutputStyletocompressed`.\nhttps://gist.github.com/evilebottnawi/c56515c6b4ef5238a714afaba9d626c7. @michael-ciniawsky I also think so, but the problem should be reported in any case. @michael-ciniawsky One good question:\nminimize === compressed or not. @michael-ciniawsky \n\n:compressed\nCompressed style takes up the minimum amount of space possible, having no whitespace except that necessary to separate selectors and a newline at the end of the file. It also includes some other minor compressions, such as choosing the smallest representation for colors. It\u2019s not meant to be human-readable.. @michael-ciniawsky seems yes. @michael-ciniawsky yep, cssnano handle colors, but maybe some people don't use cssnano and use only compressed style. @michael-ciniawsky yep, they can setup outputStyle directly using loader options.. Thanks all who helped clarify this problem. Close here because not related to sass-loader.. @rhys-vdw what status is now? It is worth waiting for pr or not?. @rhys-vdw great! btw i have same module for extract variables, just for information https://github.com/itgalaxy/get-sass-vars-sync. @rhys-vdw your can rewrite on async, it is repo for my internal use, feel free to rewrite or we can write common repo based on my work :smile: . @nsams friendly ping, what is status?. @gkohen your can use https://github.com/sass/node-sass#functions--v300---experimental as option in loader. Thanks for using webpack and sass-loader :+1: \n\nClosing this out, please feel free to reopen if this doesn't resolve your issue. Thanks!. @vanesyan In your example (https://github.com/vanesyan/webpack-npm-scope-css-import-issue), \"~@foo/bar.scss\" don't exists use \"~@foo/bar/index\". If your want to support main field in package.json please create separately issue.. @vanesyan webpack by default support main field in package.json.. @vanesyan your right bug in this line https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/importsToResolve.js#L33 for @import ~@foo/bar it is false, but should be true. @vanesyan I'll try to find the time to fix it today, but first I need to scrape the issues not related to sass-loader :tired_face: . @asolopovas wip. @asolopovas hm, works fine for me, can your explain more information? Whatbrowser your are use?If your can create screenshots this bug?. @asolopovas oh really, tomorrow try to found solution \ud83d\udc4d . i hate windows, i spend about 4 hours just to build start to work :sob: . @asolopovas i don't use mac :smile: . Confirmed, start to searching solution. Seems related to https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/91. Not related to style-loader, feel free to reopen if after merge https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/pull/532 error still exists. @rascio your can use https://github.com/sass/node-sass#importer--v200---experimental for this. THis is not related to sass-loader, some libraries add variable to define here search dependencies package or assets (your can create issue about this and do pr in patternfly). Sorry but seems won't fix in sass-loader.. @rascio seems duplicate https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/227.\nClosing this out, please feel free to reopen if this doesn't related to your issue. Thanks!. @BHouwens seems your use postcss after sass-loader with postcss-scss or have invalid config, can you provide your config? See similar issue https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/295. @BHouwens use right syntax for webpack 2\nshell\nuse: [\n       {\n           loader: 'css-loader',\n           options: { modules: true, importLoaders: 1, localIdentName: \"[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]\" }\n       },\n       'postcss-loader',\n       {\n              loader: 'sass-loader',\n       }\n ]. @BHouwens good, I will bring this issue to the discussion. @r1005410078 i think it is not related to sass-loader, just sass syntax error, if your think your code should be works, but you still get an error maybe best create issue in node-sass (https://github.com/sass/node-sass) with example your code. @mooror Interesting! Why don't use devtool:source-map` always (poor performance)? Also your can to try https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcecomments, https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcecomments and other option related tosource maps`. Also some notes about options in source code https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/normalizeOptions.js#L34. \nIf nothing to help with this or something does not work properly let us know about it :+1: . @mooror friendly ping. @vifird Where did you find relativeUrls option for sass-loader?. /cc @vifird friendly ping. @vifird sass-loader build on top node-sass (see all options https://github.com/sass/node-sass#options), also original sass don't have this option too. Seems you are confused with less (http://lesscss.org/usage/).\nClosing this out, please feel free to reopen if this doesn't resolve your issue. Thanks!\n. @danieladonna all works fine, just variables, functions and mixins in https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/blob/develop/scss/foundation.scss, what do you want see after import?. @alexanderknapstein all right, first use include all variables, mixins and etc (foundation-sites/scss/foundation.scss) then you use included mixin, just see examples http://foundation.zurb.com/building-blocks/\n/cc @michael-ciniawsky we can close this issue, because it is not related to sass-loader. @throoze A few wrong things :smile:\nWrong sass syntax.\n```sass\n$small: 480px\n$medium: 786px\n$large: 1140px\n@media only screen and (min-width: $small)\n    font-size: 14px; // Should don't be empty\n@media only screen and (min-width: $medium)\n    .some-selector\n        border: 1px solid #dedede\n        border-radius: 6px\n        bottom: 10px\n        box-shadow: 0px 0px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)\n        height: 500px\n        position: absolute\n        right: 10px\n        width: 320px\n```\nSome note about indented syntax http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html.\nClosing this out, please feel free to reopen if this doesn't resolve your issue. Thanks!. @jethrolarson 'dart-sass' is cool project, but there are a lot of bugs with sass original compatibility :sob: . @lukepolo seems more related to node-sass, we should have dart-sass port on nodejs. Now we don't have this port and it is impossible.. @graingert can you explain why dart-sass is better (or not) than node-sass? Faster, better compatibility with orginal sass implementation or other feature. But main problem is dart-sass don't support custom importer, without this feature, it is impossibly to implement support dart-sass in sass-loader.. @gitsupersmecher can your provide use case for this and why your need this?. @gitsupersmecher what concretely sass-loader should logs, give example :smile: . Another loader don't have logs, seems it is not required.\nAlso we are gradually integrating validation options (example https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader/blob/master/lib/options.json).. @michael-ciniawsky can you help with integrate validation option as in https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin/tree/master/schema ? :smile: . Close. No feedback. Feel free to reopen and explain why we need log?. /cc @michael-ciniawsky friendly ping, let's finish it :smile: . @aprilandjan Thanks for feedback. Duplicate: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/410\nClosing this out, please feel free to reopen if your think what your issue doesn't related above issue. Thanks!. @zhengxkq do your use postcss plugins like cssnano? also provide you webpack config. @dudesweet100 try var myCss = require('css-loader!sass-loader!./index.scss');console.log(myCss) for exporting styles\nor require('style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader!./index.scss') for including styles in dom immediately.. @vanesyan thanks :+1: . /cc @jhnns friendly ping. @jarindr sass-loader don't resolve :global and :local it is do css-loader. https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader. @jarindr please create minimal reproducable test repo, we will not help you if you do not provide information, good issue - issue with detailed information, not empty :+1: . @jarindr and seems sass syntax don't allow using :global and :local. @jarindr seems works good in https://www.sassmeister.com/ and support. weird, all sass files should be indentedSyntax set to true https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/normalizeOptions.js#L61, seems in your case indentedSyntax is false, try to set indentedSyntax in option. @jarindr Great! :+1: . @michael-ciniawsky just typo, node-sass -> sass-loader. node-sass is now only 4.5.2 :smile: . @DBosley close this issue, seems duplicate https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/425, also WIP.. @strarsis i am not familiar with eyeglass, best answer on this question is try to integrate this and if your got error put stack trace here. Btw, for question use stackoverflow, thanks!. @tangshuang using separate entries. Create vendor entry and include all vendor sass and create app entry and include all app sass. In front-end load first vendor entry then app entry.. @tangshuang your can create entry with bootstrap and place here only sass/scss files. After include this file before other css files. If you want real modularity your should use css-modules. Please study https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules. @tangshuang also your can do this automatically using CommonsChunkPlugin https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/ https://webpack.github.io/docs/stylesheets.html#styles-in-commons-chunk. Closing due to inactivity, code splitting not related to sass-loader. Please read for webpack v2 https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-css/. @lukaswelinder please provide more information (better minimum reproducible test repo) about what do you want and what do you get, thanks!. @luchillo17 yep, latest node-sass and libsass not supporting >>>. \nUsing for testing - https://www.sassmeister.com/ \nInput:\nul >>> li {\n  background: lightblue;\n}\nOutput:\nul > > > li {\n  background: lightblue;\n}\nAlso original sass (written on ruby) also not supporting >>>. Sad, but we can not do anything. Your can create issue https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues about this.. @alxtz I advise using first point from https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#problems-with-url. sass-loader don't handle url and seems it is related to resolve-url-loader (he using rework, it is bad because rework is deprecated). Closed, not related to sass-loader, feel free to reopen if your think problem in sass-loader.. @wzup yep, it is valid css and it should be valid as scss (working on original sass compiler v4).\nProblems in libsass (https://github.com/sass/libsass). We can not do anything here. Please create issue in libsass.\nhttps://www.sassmeister.com/\nInput:\na {\n    font: normal normal 400 16px/calc(16px * 1.4) Roboto;\n}\nOutput:\n16px/calc isn't a valid CSS value. on line 2 at column 29\nThanks for helping us to do webpack better!. Fixed: https://github.com/sass/libsass/pull/2392, let's  wait new version node-sass with new version libsass. Thanks!. @katzz0 no, seems your configuration invalid, can your show configuration?. @katzz0 seems resolve-url-loader not works as expected. I don't recommendation usage this loader.\nWhy?\n1. He seems abandoned.\n2. He use rework (abandoned).. @katzz0 At the time of writing it was not abandoned, now there is no alternative, so he stayed in README. I don't use resolve-url-loader loader in my projects and all works fine.. @idangozlan seems your use old version sass-loader, try to use rm -r node_modules, then npm cache clear (yarn cache clean) and npm i (yarn install). @idangozlan https://david-dm.org/webpack-contrib/sass-loader our deps status. It looks like you're using something other together sass-loader. Close. Feel free to reopen if your again get this warning. . @gizm0bill thanks in near future i investigate this. @gizm0bill using @import '~@styles/main'; mean what sass-loader try to search file by node_modules/@style/main path. Alias should be working only if your use @import '~@styles'.\n@import '~@styles/main'; - importing file from package.\n@import '~@styles'; - importing module (respect browser field in package.json and etc).. @gizm0bill seems alias don't work now for all packages https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/410, it is related to this problem, right?. @solidevolution aliases works only with modules: @import \"~something\", if your want own logic for loading please use custom importer (https://github.com/sass/node-sass#importer--v200---experimental), thanks!. @solidevolution sass-loader build on importer function, without importer sass-loader doesn't works, so it does not make sense not to support experimental importer function(s). No i don't have postcss solution, thanks!. @katiasmet \nshell\n{\n  loader: \"sass-loader\",\n  options: {\n    includePaths: ['src/_scss']\n  }\n}\nIf this don't help, please create minimum reproducible test repo, thanks!. @Guobacai can your show stack trace of error?. @Guobacai be good if your can create minimal test reproducible repo :+1: This will help us understand why it happens. @thescientist13 seems not related to sass-loader. Problems in webpack/lib/Compilation.js:219:10, maybe something wrong with ts-loader loader?. @marekpw @Yizhachok @borela can your provide minimal reproducible test repo?. @borela @marekpw bad solution, using includePaths option reduces performance.. @borela seems it is regression bug after https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/450 or https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/447. @borela I will try to solve this problem today or tomorrow, thanks!. Seems problems in node-sass (they don't support scoped import https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1596).\nBut it is possibly to solve throw imported, working on this.. /cc @michael-ciniawsky what do your think about problems? It's hard for me to imagine a solution for her, we can't add ~ in vendor sass styles :disappointed: . @michael-ciniawsky yep, this is known, the question is whether we at the level sass-loader fix it or not. @michael-ciniawsky no new loader or something other stuff (options), just change logic in sass-loader which allow loading scoped importing in vendor sass/scss styles. @ddobson workaround, but it is increase build time, no solution for this right now, but PR welcome. @mischkl old and known issue, solutions https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/479#issuecomment-314701628. @mischkl it is not hack, it is correct solution.  I agree we need search build-in solution for this, but it is not easy. Any ideas? PR welcome :+1: . @mischkl it is breaking changes and can lead to a problem with performance and incompatibility, before think about this we should look how working less/stylus/etc loader with this problem (if they working with scoped packages). If I'm not mistaken node-sass don't work with scoped packages by default.\n. @mischkl maybe this solution is right, it is really not easy to fix and i don't have ideas about this, but i am glad to hear any opinion and solution. Maybe we can fix this in node-sass and all packages which use this can handle scoped packages. @mischkl in theory any @package/style import which located in node_modules files should be resolve node-sass from node_modules directory, on the other hand node-sass just port sass on nodejs platform and don't care about this. I don't known who should this do :disappointed: . @heikkimu sass-loader does't not have config option, see options in README.md.\nExample\njs\n{\n    loader: \"sass-loader\",\n    options: {\n        includePaths: [\"absolute/path/a\", \"absolute/path/b\"]\n    }\n}. @heikkimu Also your question on stackoverflow related to webpack v1, please update to webpack v1. @heikkimu current version of sass-loader doesn't support webpack v1 (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/package.json#L36), your can update to v2 ( Recomended https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/) or use old version sass-loader (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/tree/v4.1.1, can contains errors and unexpected behavior).. @silverbackdan please provide more detailed webpack configuration. @silverbackdan feel free to reopen if issue will be related to sass-loader. @michael-ciniawsky can we merge and release patch, no access :smile: . This will done be in https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/429\nAll works fine, your got just a warning for an unmet peerDependency, it's not a critical.\n. @SirCameron sass-loader don't parse url. @SirCameron handling url do css-loader https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader#options. @SirCameron maybe your should setup file-loader https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader using Filename template placeholders where specify where your want save files.. @SirCameron Can i close issue here? Feel free to reopen if it is not solve your problem. Thanks!. @d3viant0ne Can we release path version today, after merge this?. @VaskaDogana can your provide more information what actually and what expected, better will be create minimal reproducible test repo. Closing due to inactivity. Thanks!. @SirCameron please, provide your minimal reproducible test repo. @SirCameron sass-loader don't related to Atom and Atom plugin. Can your provide example where your have unexpected behavior?. @SirCameron just close. Someone can use the search and find it. Thanks!. @marcinant already updated https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/package.json#L57\nJust update to 6.0.6 version (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/package.json#L3). @michael-ciniawsky more fix, than feature, webpack by default support aliases, need sombody who know wepback and sass to be sure that all good. @jhnns big bad problem with aliases is nonsupporting this inside node_modules, because we can't add ~ inside other libraries/frameworks. To be honest, I do not know how to solve this, in theory we can add option where developers will add own aliases, anywhere here https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/importsToResolve.js#L16. Example:\nshell\n{\n                loader: \"sass-loader\",\n                options: {\n                    includePaths: [\"absolute/path/a\", \"absolute/path/b\"],\n                    aliases: { /regex/: 'path/to/something' } // as in webpack\n                }\n            }\nI agree this look strange, but we can explain in README why we use this solution. I can rewrite this here if we will accept this. Thanks!. /cc @jhnns friendly ping, what do your think about options.alias?. @mischkl Be great if your do PR, @jhnns now is very busy and only do review PR, i am not familiar with eyeglass and for me difficult understand what need to add\n . @yogeshgadge can your create minimal reproducible test repo? I am use font-awesome in my projects with sass-loader and all works fine. @yogeshgadge aliases not working now for sass-loader, PR fixes this https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/479. @yogeshgadge hm, should be work with modules, can your provide minimum test repo?. Duplicate https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/410. @yantakus your can use https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#environment-variables to setup own variables. @yantakus your can add @import \"app/styles/settings/_settings.scss\" to each file where your need variables or use sass variables directly in webpack config. @yantakus seems there is no solution for this purpose, your can create own loader for this (css-loader -> postcss-loader -> sass-loader -> inject-sass-variables-loader), but recommendation way is including variables.scss in each file. \nWhy? Because each file is module and if your module contain some data (in your case it is variables) which contain in other module, your can import this module (your are doing this for js modules).\nAlso your can use other way: use https://github.com/niksy/get-sass-vars or https://github.com/itgalaxy/get-sass-vars-sync/ for reading variables in JSON format and use\noptions: {\n    data: JSON.stringify(variables)\n}. @baunegaard your can set sourceMapRoot to <Project root>/Assets. If your provide minimal test repo it is help to solve problem.. @baunegaard\n\nWith a minimal test repo do you mean just an empty repo with a webpack.config to reproduce. @baunegaard Did not understand what expected behavior? webpack always story source maps in webpack://. Your want change this? If yes, why?. @baunegaard thanks for clarify, try to found solution in near future. We can fix it change result.map.sources = result.map.sources.map(path.normalize) to result.map.sources = result.map.sources.map((source) => path.normalize(path.resolve(source)));, but I'm not completely sure, I'm still looking for a solution.\n\nBut it is should be work with relative path, seems problems not in sass-loader, we return correct sources:\nshell\n[ 'css/bundles/bundle.scss', 'css/modules/module.scss' ]\n[ 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' ]. Using (here https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/loader.js#L73): \njs\nconsole.log(result.map.sourceRoot)\nconsole.log(result.map.sources)\nOutput:\nshell\n/home/evilebottnawi/IdeaProjects/sass-loader-sourcemap-test\n[ 'css/bundles/bundle.scss', 'css/modules/module.scss' ]\n/home/evilebottnawi/IdeaProjects/sass-loader-sourcemap-test\n[ 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' ]\nAll fine, seems issue related to css-loader, i will try to found what is wrong and why it is happens in css-loader. @baunegaard related to css-loader, because from for postcss set as /css-loader!/path/to/css/bundles/bundle.scss (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/blob/master/lib/processCss.js#L198) and all sources interpreted (when postcss build source maps) as relative to this path, but in your case module.css not relative. Close here because not related to sass-loader, thanks all!. @serheyShmyg can your provide link on documentation about this, but need tests for this anyway\n. @serheyShmyg we use programmatic api, not CLI, your can just use require('path/to/importer') without changed sass-loader code.. @serheyShmyg what query string? Please provide full example (case), it is difficult to understand. @julmot thanks for issue, known limitation for compressed style (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/416#issuecomment-311931867), Sorry, but we can't fix this.\nBut your can use this example (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/416#issuecomment-311932206) if your want to using colors as part of selector.. @sshmyg please provide minimum reproducible test repo and more information about your steps which output this, thanks!. @sshmyg friendly ping. @sshmyg with minimum test repo we can investigate this. @narthollis only @import '~your_module' should be works with NormalModuleReplacementPlugin, @import's without ~ don't interpreted as module so NormalModuleReplacementPlugin doesn't works as expected (known limitation). But your can do this using own importer (https://github.com/sass/node-sass#importer--v200---experimental), it should be very easy implement. This solution suits you?. @henrahmagix tomorrow i investigate this.

Use common variables.scss file and include in every required file.\n2. Use https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader\n3. Implement own loader for this purpose\n4. Use `data` option with multiple variables (module for variables https://github.com/itgalaxy/get-sass-vars-sync)\n5. https://github.com/Updater/node-sass-json-importer\n. @jhnns friendly ping. @catamphetamine thank for issue, `node-sass` doing this?. @catamphetamine very strange in my projects all work fine, investigate. 1. Finecss\n@media (max-width: 720px) {\n  a {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n2. Finecss\n@media (max-width: 720px) {\n  @import \"nested\";\n}\n**_nested.scss**css\na {\n  color: yellow;\n}\n3. Not fine (module empty `exports.push([module.i, \"\", \"\"]);`)css\n@media (max-width: 720px) {\n  @import \"~react-responsive-ui/small-screen.css\";\n}\nI continue the investigation. @catamphetamine don't use `.css` extension.\nWorks fine.css\n@media all and (max-width: 720px) {\n  @import \"~react-responsive-ui/small-screen\";\n}\n. @catamphetamine http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_import__import\n@import \"foo.css\";\n@import \"foo\" screen;\n@import \"http://foo.com/bar\";\n@import url(foo);\nto\n@import \"foo.css\";\n@import \"foo\" screen;\n@import \"http://foo.com/bar\";\n@import url(foo);\n. @jhnns What do you think about this:\nShould we `@import \"~react-responsive-ui/small-screen.css\";` don't touch and output in result:css\n@import \"~react-responsive-ui/small-screen.css\";\n``\nOr we should throw error about not resolved? Because resolvemodules(~) is out of scopenode-sass.\nNow we output empty content on this structure, i think it is misleading.. @catamphetamine agree, but need @jhnns answer, btw thank you for issue.. @megamindbrian problem still exists?. @spiral2k you manually installnode-sass, which part need upgrade?. @spiral2k we use^4.0.0which mean also4.5.3. @spiral2k it isdevDependenciesonly for tests, you should addnode-sassmanually in yourpackage.json.. @pedrotainha please create **minimum** reproducible test repo, thank you. @pedrotainha no thanks. Btw seems something wrong withhappypacksetup. @kirbyfan64 Duplicate, please read https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/435#issuecomment-333260284. @wzup seems node-sass doesn't support long color, need investigation, thank for issue. @wzuplibsassversion3.5.0.beta.2don't support #rrggbbaa hex color notation, you can try this in https://www.sassmeister.com/. Please create issue inlibsassabout this, Thank you!. @artvader can you provide scss scripts, seems problem in you scss script, not in sass-loader. @joshuaaron why you use~for images? Alsosass` don't have url rewriting (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#problems-with-url). \nimportLoaders: 2 => importLoaders: 1. @joshuaaron importLoaders means:\n``scss\n@import \"test.css\";\n// if you useimportLoaders: 2:scss-loader=>postcss-loaderrun on this import\n// if you useimportLoaders: 1:postcss-loader` run on this import\n// Other scss code\n``\nAbout url, usefullrelative url -../../img/my-img.png(relativeroot.scss). @johnjacobkenny problem still exists? Can you create minimum reproducible test repo?. @joshuaaron in near future i investigate you problems, sorry for delay, many work :disappointed: . @chacbumbum can you provide config or minimum reproducible test repo?. @chacbumbum can you try escape\\:global?

Sorry for the long time we don't answer :smile: . @SleepWalkercss-loaderaccount allurl, Can your describe or provide repo where not happening?. Apparently there is no for this universal and good solution. If someone has an idea how we can to implementing this, i will be glad to see this here https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/296.. @rw3iss originalnode-sassworks absolutely identical, to avoid double content useminificator. @bensampaio @adjavaherian Is there a problem so far?. @bensampaio where your can haveprocess.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZEand why100? :smile:  . @adjavaherian nowv6.0.3sass-loader:smile: .

Thanks!. @SeeThruHead friendly ping, problems now exists?. Fell free to reopen issue if your problem not solved.. @thathurtabit yep, your should import variables/mixin/etc staff in each module, because it is module. To make it easier, you can create shared.scss (with variales, mixins, placeholders and etc) and include only one shared.scss file.. Two ways:\n1. Use common variables.scss file and include in every required file.\n2. Use https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader\nClose. If these solutions do not suit your, please write here about this and explain why.. @wzup use options property in loader. @cwagner22 can your create minimal reproducible test repo? Seems something is wrong in style-loader (or in webpack config)\n. /cc @donaldallen @cwagner22 friendly ping. I just tested this feature, it works fine. Closing due to inactivity. Please test with latest version and have correctly configuration. Thanks!. /cc @jhnns To be honest, I do not even represent a better solution than own importer for these projects, but maybe your have idea about this. Or we can just add example of such simple importer to README.. Seems duplicate https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/466. Feel free to reopen if it is different problem. Fast solution as said jhnns https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/227#issuecomment-228594718. @mikeifomin is problem actual?.

Please refactor your webpack config.\nAlso var sassOptions = getLoaderConfig(this); console.log(sassOptions); inside sass-loader output:\nincludePaths: [ '/paht/to/todomvc-angular-4/src/scss']\nWhich mean all options are respected inside sass-loader, your can have invalid @import 'something' in your styles.\n. Sorry but not related to sass-loader, also we have tests on includePaths option. Also you can notice below config is not right way, just use options property for each loader in your rules.. @zabojad \nloaders: [ \"style-loader\", \"css-loader?sourceMap\", 'sass-loader?{\"sourceMap\":true,\"includePaths\":[\"app/styles\"]}' ],\n            }\n        ],\nRefactor to\n{\n  test: /\\.s[ac]ss$/,\n  use: [\n    {\n        loader: \"style-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    },\n    {\n        loader: \"css-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    },\n    {\n        // Your also can avoid this loader if your don't need\n        loader: \"postcss-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    },\n    {\n        loader: \"sass-loader\",\n        options: {} // your can avoid `options` if your don't have these\n    }\n  ]\n}. @dovidweisz already testing, just wait. @dovidweisz yep, I just wanted to write about this, just avoid to use `LoaderOptionsPlugin`, they still buggy and incompatibility with many thing.. @katiasmet please create new issue for this, don't write your problem(s) inside other problem(s), thanks!. @wsfuller in theory should work `['css-loader', 'postcss-loader', 'resolve-url-loader', 'sass-loader']`, if your provide minimal reproducible repo it give an opportunity to answer this question accurately (maybe something should be docs to avoid this issue). Closing due to inactivity. Please test with latest version and feel free to reopen if still regressions.. @wsfuller Not entirely true, with this logic we must put this information in each `loader`, it is overloading docs, more right place information about this in https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/#loader-features (where you indicated). Btw thanks for using `webpack` :1st_place_medal: . @wsfuller Then you should create `migration-from-gulp-and-grunt.md` and move this docs in `webpack-docs`, not here. @wsfuller your can do PR and if docs will be good we can merge this :+1: . @maffelbaffel About `-p`shell\n  -p           shortcut for --optimize-minimize --define\n               process.env.NODE_ENV=\"production\"                       [boolean]\n``\nSeems your havecss-loaderand otherpostcss-pluginfor minification css (-penable their) and one of them does not work correctly.

Problem innode-sass/libsass, just try to setupoutputStyletocompressed`.\nhttps://gist.github.com/evilebottnawi/c56515c6b4ef5238a714afaba9d626c7. @michael-ciniawsky I also think so, but the problem should be reported in any case. @michael-ciniawsky One good question:\nminimize === compressed or not. @michael-ciniawsky \n\n:compressed\nCompressed style takes up the minimum amount of space possible, having no whitespace except that necessary to separate selectors and a newline at the end of the file. It also includes some other minor compressions, such as choosing the smallest representation for colors. It\u2019s not meant to be human-readable.. @michael-ciniawsky seems yes. @michael-ciniawsky yep, cssnano handle colors, but maybe some people don't use cssnano and use only compressed style. @michael-ciniawsky yep, they can setup outputStyle directly using loader options.. Thanks all who helped clarify this problem. Close here because not related to sass-loader.. @rhys-vdw what status is now? It is worth waiting for pr or not?. @rhys-vdw great! btw i have same module for extract variables, just for information https://github.com/itgalaxy/get-sass-vars-sync. @rhys-vdw your can rewrite on async, it is repo for my internal use, feel free to rewrite or we can write common repo based on my work :smile: . @nsams friendly ping, what is status?. @gkohen your can use https://github.com/sass/node-sass#functions--v300---experimental as option in loader.

Thanks!. @BHouwens seems your use postcss after sass-loader with postcss-scss or have invalid config, can you provide your config? See similar issue https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/295. @BHouwens use right syntax for webpack 2\nshell\nuse: [\n       {\n           loader: 'css-loader',\n           options: { modules: true, importLoaders: 1, localIdentName: \"[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]\" }\n       },\n       'postcss-loader',\n       {\n              loader: 'sass-loader',\n       }\n ]. @BHouwens good, I will bring this issue to the discussion. @r1005410078 i think it is not related to sass-loader, just sass syntax error, if your think your code should be works, but you still get an error maybe best create issue in node-sass (https://github.com/sass/node-sass) with example your code. @mooror Interesting! Why don't use devtool:source-map` always (poor performance)? Also your can to try https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcecomments, https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcecomments and other option related tosource maps`.

Thanks!. @jethrolarson 'dart-sass' is cool project, but there are a lot of bugs with sass original compatibility :sob: . @lukepolo seems more related to node-sass, we should have dart-sass port on nodejs. Now we don't have this port and it is impossible.. @graingert can you explain why dart-sass is better (or not) than node-sass? Faster, better compatibility with orginal sass implementation or other feature. But main problem is dart-sass don't support custom importer, without this feature, it is impossibly to implement support dart-sass in sass-loader.. @gitsupersmecher can your provide use case for this and why your need this?. @gitsupersmecher what concretely sass-loader should logs, give example :smile: . Another loader don't have logs, seems it is not required.\nAlso we are gradually integrating validation options (example https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader/blob/master/lib/options.json).. @michael-ciniawsky can you help with integrate validation option as in https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin/tree/master/schema ? :smile: .

Btw, for question use stackoverflow, thanks!. @tangshuang using separate entries. Create vendor entry and include all vendor sass and create app entry and include all app sass. In front-end load first vendor entry then app entry.. @tangshuang your can create entry with bootstrap and place here only sass/scss files. After include this file before other css files. If you want real modularity your should use css-modules. Please study https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules. @tangshuang also your can do this automatically using CommonsChunkPlugin https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/ https://webpack.github.io/docs/stylesheets.html#styles-in-commons-chunk.

He seems abandoned.\n2. He use rework (abandoned).. @katzz0 At the time of writing it was not abandoned, now there is no alternative, so he stayed in README. I don't use resolve-url-loader loader in my projects and all works fine.. @idangozlan seems your use old version sass-loader, try to use rm -r node_modules, then npm cache clear (yarn cache clean) and npm i (yarn install). @idangozlan https://david-dm.org/webpack-contrib/sass-loader our deps status. It looks like you're using something other together sass-loader. Close.

Seems problems in node-sass (they don't support scoped import https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1596).\nBut it is possibly to solve throw imported, working on this.. /cc @michael-ciniawsky what do your think about problems? It's hard for me to imagine a solution for her, we can't add ~ in vendor sass styles :disappointed: . @michael-ciniawsky yep, this is known, the question is whether we at the level sass-loader fix it or not. @michael-ciniawsky no new loader or something other stuff (options), just change logic in sass-loader which allow loading scoped importing in vendor sass/scss styles. @ddobson workaround, but it is increase build time, no solution for this right now, but PR welcome. @mischkl old and known issue, solutions https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/479#issuecomment-314701628. @mischkl it is not hack, it is correct solution.  I agree we need search build-in solution for this, but it is not easy. Any ideas? PR welcome :+1: . @mischkl it is breaking changes and can lead to a problem with performance and incompatibility, before think about this we should look how working less/stylus/etc loader with this problem (if they working with scoped packages). If I'm not mistaken node-sass don't work with scoped packages by default.\n. @mischkl maybe this solution is right, it is really not easy to fix and i don't have ideas about this, but i am glad to hear any opinion and solution. Maybe we can fix this in node-sass and all packages which use this can handle scoped packages. @mischkl in theory any @package/style import which located in node_modules files should be resolve node-sass from node_modules directory, on the other hand node-sass just port sass on nodejs platform and don't care about this. I don't known who should this do :disappointed: . @heikkimu sass-loader does't not have config option, see options in README.md.\nExample\njs\n{\n    loader: \"sass-loader\",\n    options: {\n        includePaths: [\"absolute/path/a\", \"absolute/path/b\"]\n    }\n}. @heikkimu Also your question on stackoverflow related to webpack v1, please update to webpack v1. @heikkimu current version of sass-loader doesn't support webpack v1 (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/package.json#L36), your can update to v2 ( Recomended https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/) or use old version sass-loader (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/tree/v4.1.1, can contains errors and unexpected behavior).. @silverbackdan please provide more detailed webpack configuration. @silverbackdan feel free to reopen if issue will be related to sass-loader. @michael-ciniawsky can we merge and release patch, no access :smile: . This will done be in https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/429\nAll works fine, your got just a warning for an unmet peerDependency, it's not a critical.\n. @SirCameron sass-loader don't parse url. @SirCameron handling url do css-loader https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader#options. @SirCameron maybe your should setup file-loader https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader using Filename template placeholders where specify where your want save files.. @SirCameron Can i close issue here? Feel free to reopen if it is not solve your problem. Thanks!. @d3viant0ne Can we release path version today, after merge this?. @VaskaDogana can your provide more information what actually and what expected, better will be create minimal reproducible test repo. Closing due to inactivity. Thanks!. @SirCameron please, provide your minimal reproducible test repo. @SirCameron sass-loader don't related to Atom and Atom plugin. Can your provide example where your have unexpected behavior?. @SirCameron just close. Someone can use the search and find it. Thanks!. @marcinant already updated https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/package.json#L57\nJust update to 6.0.6 version (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/package.json#L3). @michael-ciniawsky more fix, than feature, webpack by default support aliases, need sombody who know wepback and sass to be sure that all good. @jhnns big bad problem with aliases is nonsupporting this inside node_modules, because we can't add ~ inside other libraries/frameworks. To be honest, I do not know how to solve this, in theory we can add option where developers will add own aliases, anywhere here https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/importsToResolve.js#L16. Example:\nshell\n{\n                loader: \"sass-loader\",\n                options: {\n                    includePaths: [\"absolute/path/a\", \"absolute/path/b\"],\n                    aliases: { /regex/: 'path/to/something' } // as in webpack\n                }\n            }\nI agree this look strange, but we can explain in README why we use this solution. I can rewrite this here if we will accept this. Thanks!. /cc @jhnns friendly ping, what do your think about options.alias?. @mischkl Be great if your do PR, @jhnns now is very busy and only do review PR, i am not familiar with eyeglass and for me difficult understand what need to add\n . @yogeshgadge can your create minimal reproducible test repo? I am use font-awesome in my projects with sass-loader and all works fine. @yogeshgadge aliases not working now for sass-loader, PR fixes this https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/479. @yogeshgadge hm, should be work with modules, can your provide minimum test repo?. Duplicate https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/410. @yantakus your can use https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#environment-variables to setup own variables. @yantakus your can add @import \"app/styles/settings/_settings.scss\" to each file where your need variables or use sass variables directly in webpack config. @yantakus seems there is no solution for this purpose, your can create own loader for this (css-loader -> postcss-loader -> sass-loader -> inject-sass-variables-loader), but recommendation way is including variables.scss in each file. \nWhy? Because each file is module and if your module contain some data (in your case it is variables) which contain in other module, your can import this module (your are doing this for js modules).\nAlso your can use other way: use https://github.com/niksy/get-sass-vars or https://github.com/itgalaxy/get-sass-vars-sync/ for reading variables in JSON format and use\noptions: {\n    data: JSON.stringify(variables)\n}. @baunegaard your can set sourceMapRoot to <Project root>/Assets. If your provide minimal test repo it is help to solve problem.. @baunegaard\n\nWith a minimal test repo do you mean just an empty repo with a webpack.config to reproduce. @baunegaard Did not understand what expected behavior? webpack always story source maps in webpack://. Your want change this? If yes, why?. @baunegaard thanks for clarify, try to found solution in near future. We can fix it change result.map.sources = result.map.sources.map(path.normalize) to result.map.sources = result.map.sources.map((source) => path.normalize(path.resolve(source)));, but I'm not completely sure, I'm still looking for a solution.\n\nBut it is should be work with relative path, seems problems not in sass-loader, we return correct sources:\nshell\n[ 'css/bundles/bundle.scss', 'css/modules/module.scss' ]\n[ 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' ]. Using (here https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/loader.js#L73): \njs\nconsole.log(result.map.sourceRoot)\nconsole.log(result.map.sources)\nOutput:\nshell\n/home/evilebottnawi/IdeaProjects/sass-loader-sourcemap-test\n[ 'css/bundles/bundle.scss', 'css/modules/module.scss' ]\n/home/evilebottnawi/IdeaProjects/sass-loader-sourcemap-test\n[ 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' ]\nAll fine, seems issue related to css-loader, i will try to found what is wrong and why it is happens in css-loader. @baunegaard related to css-loader, because from for postcss set as /css-loader!/path/to/css/bundles/bundle.scss (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/blob/master/lib/processCss.js#L198) and all sources interpreted (when postcss build source maps) as relative to this path, but in your case module.css not relative. Close here because not related to sass-loader, thanks all!. @serheyShmyg can your provide link on documentation about this, but need tests for this anyway\n. @serheyShmyg we use programmatic api, not CLI, your can just use require('path/to/importer') without changed sass-loader code.. @serheyShmyg what query string? Please provide full example (case), it is difficult to understand. @julmot thanks for issue, known limitation for compressed style (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/416#issuecomment-311931867), Sorry, but we can't fix this.\nBut your can use this example (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/416#issuecomment-311932206) if your want to using colors as part of selector.. @sshmyg please provide minimum reproducible test repo and more information about your steps which output this, thanks!. @sshmyg friendly ping. @sshmyg with minimum test repo we can investigate this. @narthollis only @import '~your_module' should be works with NormalModuleReplacementPlugin, @import's without ~ don't interpreted as module so NormalModuleReplacementPlugin doesn't works as expected (known limitation). But your can do this using own importer (https://github.com/sass/node-sass#importer--v200---experimental), it should be very easy implement. This solution suits you?. @henrahmagix tomorrow i investigate this. Thanks for issue!. @henrahmagix thanks for issue, seems problem not in sass-loader, because using require('fs').writeFileSync('test.css', result.css.toString()) before https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/loader.js#L79 , output:\n```css\n/ --- Copied from Mavo _defs.scss --- /\n/ Without inline-svg function /\n.rubbish-bin-copied-without-inline-svg-function::before, .rubbish-bin-copied-with-copied-inline-svg-function::before {\n  content: inline-svg('\\a             \\a             \\a         ');\n  width: 1em;\n  height: 1em; }\n/ With inline-svg function /\n.rubbish-bin-copied-without-inline-svg-function::before, .rubbish-bin-copied-with-copied-inline-svg-function::before {\n  content: url(\"data:image/svg+xml,url-encode('\\a             \\a             \\a         ')\");\n  width: 1em;\n  height: 1em; }\n/ --- Direct from Mavo --- /\n/ Imported via sass-loader ~ import resolver /\n.via-import-resolver::before, .via-node-modules-path::before {\n  content: url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w33.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20version%3D%221.1%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20100%20125%22%20fill%3D%22rgb%28200%2C0%2C0%29%22%3E\\a          %3Cpath%20d%3D%22M65%2C15.437V8c0-3.86-3.141-7-7-7H42c-3.86%2C0-7%2C3.14-7%2C7v7.437C14.017%2C16.816%2C14%2C21%2C14%2C21v10h72V21%20C86%2C21%2C85.982%2C16.816%2C65%2C15.437z%20M43%2C9h14v6.086C54.828%2C15.032%2C52.51%2C15%2C50%2C15c-2.51%2C0-4.828%2C0.032-7%2C0.086V9z%22%2F%3E\\a             %3Cpath%20d%3D%22M19%2C37l6%2C62h50l6-62H19z%20M35.167%2C88.995C35.11%2C88.998%2C35.053%2C89%2C34.998%2C89c-1.581%2C0-2.904-1.236-2.993-2.834l-2-36%20%20c-0.092-1.654%2C1.175-3.07%2C2.829-3.162c1.663-0.089%2C3.07%2C1.175%2C3.162%2C2.829l2%2C36C38.087%2C87.488%2C36.821%2C88.903%2C35.167%2C88.995z%20M53%2C86\\a                   %20c0%2C1.657-1.343%2C3-3%2C3c-1.657%2C0-3-1.343-3-3V50c0-1.657%2C1.343-3%2C3-3c1.657%2C0%2C3%2C1.343%2C3%2C3V86z%20M67.995%2C86.166%20%20C67.906%2C87.764%2C66.583%2C89%2C65.003%2C89c-0.057%2C0-0.112-0.002-0.169-0.005c-1.654-0.092-2.921-1.507-2.829-3.161l2-36\\a                   %20c0.093-1.655%2C1.533-2.906%2C3.161-2.829c1.654%2C0.092%2C2.921%2C1.508%2C2.829%2C3.162L67.995%2C86.166z%22%2F%3E\\a       %3C%2Fsvg%3E\");\n  width: 1em;\n  height: 1em; }\n/ Imported directly via full node_modules path /\n.via-import-resolver::before, .via-node-modules-path::before {\n  content: url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w33.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20version%3D%221.1%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20100%20125%22%20fill%3D%22rgb%28200%2C0%2C0%29%22%3E\\a          %3Cpath%20d%3D%22M65%2C15.437V8c0-3.86-3.141-7-7-7H42c-3.86%2C0-7%2C3.14-7%2C7v7.437C14.017%2C16.816%2C14%2C21%2C14%2C21v10h72V21%20C86%2C21%2C85.982%2C16.816%2C65%2C15.437z%20M43%2C9h14v6.086C54.828%2C15.032%2C52.51%2C15%2C50%2C15c-2.51%2C0-4.828%2C0.032-7%2C0.086V9z%22%2F%3E\\a             %3Cpath%20d%3D%22M19%2C37l6%2C62h50l6-62H19z%20M35.167%2C88.995C35.11%2C88.998%2C35.053%2C89%2C34.998%2C89c-1.581%2C0-2.904-1.236-2.993-2.834l-2-36%20%20c-0.092-1.654%2C1.175-3.07%2C2.829-3.162c1.663-0.089%2C3.07%2C1.175%2C3.162%2C2.829l2%2C36C38.087%2C87.488%2C36.821%2C88.903%2C35.167%2C88.995z%20M53%2C86\\a                   %20c0%2C1.657-1.343%2C3-3%2C3c-1.657%2C0-3-1.343-3-3V50c0-1.657%2C1.343-3%2C3-3c1.657%2C0%2C3%2C1.343%2C3%2C3V86z%20M67.995%2C86.166%20%20C67.906%2C87.764%2C66.583%2C89%2C65.003%2C89c-0.057%2C0-0.112-0.002-0.169-0.005c-1.654-0.092-2.921-1.507-2.829-3.161l2-36\\a                   %20c0.093-1.655%2C1.533-2.906%2C3.161-2.829c1.654%2C0.092%2C2.921%2C1.508%2C2.829%2C3.162L67.995%2C86.166z%22%2F%3E\\a       %3C%2Fsvg%3E\");\n  width: 1em;\n  height: 1em; }\nIt is valid css and all work fine.

Thank you, it works perfectly for me!\n. @evilebottnawi thanks, I saw this in the README. This is exactly what I was using before. Do you mean I should use all my sass variables directly in webpack config, without importing them with@import` from another file?. @evilebottnawi Thanks for the answers.\nAdding import to each file is not a desired way to do it as we already have dozens of components. And I suppose webpack will be bundling much longer if it has to import a file dozens of times instead of a single time as it was in my previous config.\nPlacing variables into webpack config is also not an ideal solution as we loose syntax highlighting and the config gets too long (we have 900+ lines of variables).\nIs there any way to import this file into webpack config? Of course we can't do it just as const Variables = require('../blah/blah.scss) as interpreter tries to evaluate the code and it's not javascript.

Mine only shows win32-x64-46.\n. In my devDependencies, I have:\njavascript\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"gulp\": \"^3.9.0\",\n    \"gulp-sass\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"node-sass\": \"^3.4.1\"\n  }\n. I resolved by issue with Visual Studio by moving the PATH variable higher in priority as found here.\n. @dontbesorry80,\nWhen you updated the path variable, did you sign out and back in? If not, try that. I'll send a screenshot of my setup when I can.\n. Awesome, Glad to hear!\n. ",

You can't even force it really (without manually modifying sass-loader's package.json.\ncarret notations (or really, any of the wildcard versioning for NPM) will only work with numeric X.Y.Z versions. To allow betas, you have to specifically do something such as \"^3.2.0 || 3.4.0-beta1\" as the version.\nAnyhow, this no longer matters, so Ill close :)\n. First, make sure to upgrade to node-sass 3.4. The 3.X line had a major performance regression that was fixed. The actual time spent in node-sass will pretty much be cut by 80% by using node-sass 3.4, which was released recently.\nSecond, if you're using css-loader and not using CSS modules, -downgrade- to css-loader 0.14.5, which is about 4x faster. The introduction of css modules and postcss and whatsnot slowed css-loader like crazy. 0.14.5 works fine and is the version right before the regression. If you do not need url resolution (common in development), pass css-loader the url=false argument. That speeds things up too. \nIf you do not need url and do not use CSS sourcemaps (you can use node-sass'  sourceComments flag instead during development), you'll get another huge boost by using the raw-loader instead of css-loader.\nFinally, since the ExtractTextPlugin needs to find your CSS in the huge amount of javascript to extract it, you can gain a 5-15% performance boost by making the file smaller: if you're simply requiring your CSS from your javascript entry point (and no requiring CSS from all over your JS modules), create a second webpack configuration (webpack.config can be an array of configs), with the CSS as entry points, so extracting the CSS will be super quick as there won't be any JS. I think the css loader gets invoked in a different way with ExtractTextPlugin which makes things worse, too. The latest webpack seems to handle this better, so upgrade that too.\nDoing all of the above (especially the node-sass 3.4 upgrade, webpack 1.12.2, and not using css-loader > 0.14.5, brought our CSS compile time from 10-20s to <2s!!!.\nNote that for SASS, incremental compile only makes a difference if you have a lot of chunks (unlike JS, where it can incrementally compile a single file inside a chunk), so if you have 1 big sass file with @import, you gain almost nothing with incremental.\n. Yes, it should be fixed IMO. See https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/124\nI also feel it breaks the philosophy behind webpack loaders. You should chain very task specific loaders...having a huge feature like CSS module be part of a basic loader like css-loader seems wrong. There should be a css-module-loader or something. css-loader should be about url resolution, sourcemaps, and thats about it.\nFor url resolution, maybe its because we migrated from rails and then gulp, but all our file paths work without url resolution for images, and for css files, we just use includePaths.\nWe use url resolution for hashed filenames for cache busting, rewriting to point to our CDN, as well as inlining small files as base64 urls. None of that matters anywhere except in production. Your millage may vary :) Webpack's sourcemaps support is fantastic (\"It just works\"), but our devs prefered seeing the compiled output with sourceComments, so we just ended up using raw-loader in dev, and css-loader for prod.\n.

The PR solved this (poorly) by having a configuration option to include files like variables.scss automatically within components.scss. \nI believe that I can accomplish the same result using the data option resolved in #216, or as @jsg2021 suggested, the baggage loader.\n.

    "anchann": "Thanks for taking a look, Johannes.\n\nwe should rather try to tackle the perf issues\n\nFair enough. The only thing I wanted was that if somebody faces this problem, my findings are shared and indexed in google. The last few weeks of working on converting a large project from a three-year-old grunt-based toolchain to a webpack one has taught me one thing \u2014\u00a0none of this stuff works like magic out of the box, at the end of the day, you have to dig inside node_modules to get it working. It was the same story with the typescript part of the toolchain \u2014 takes forever, no output to shed light onto what's happening, yet calling tsc on the command line builds the project in seconds. I'd love to be proven wrong, but until then, logging my findings for the next dev is the best I can hope for :)\n\nshould be resolved at the webpack level\n\nMy personal opinion (which, I realize, is worth little) is that too much magic is a bad thing. Sass has since inception supported an includePaths configuration option specifically to make imports more readable and flexible. From this perspective, webpack's resolution seems to add nothing in terms of functionality, though perhaps it does add something in terms of uniformity (that said, uniform opaqueness is not necessarily a good thing). I'm actually using importPaths specifically to be able to import scss files from other node_modules, having it set to [\"src/styles\", \"node_modules\", \"node_modules/compass-mixins/lib\"]\nAlso, importers are labelled as experimental in node-sass' documentation. Would it not make sense to make the use of an experimental feature optional, specifically because the upstream library labels it as a \"use with caution\" feature? I would personally go as far as making it disabled by default, and only enabled when a user knows that they explicitly want the feature.\n\nmaybe it's related to sass' complicated resolving algorithm involving underscore file names\n\nI don't think that's the case \u2014 disabling the webpack importer leaves sass' native underscore resolution intact, does it not?\n\ndirectory structure\n\nWhen debugging, I had a single .scss file that was importing 130 or so individual components' .scss files (since then I've switched back to require'ing .scss files at the top of each react component's .ts file). Each of these would in turn import a common_definitions.scss file, which in turn imported 4 leaf files with a bunch of variable or mixin declarations, along with a my-lib/styles/export_definitions.scss file, which imports 3 leaf files, along with\ncompass\ncompass/css3\ncompass/css3/images\nThese are provided by the compass-mixins npm module, as a replacement for the original ruby-based compass library that I was originally using before starting the migration to webpack.\nThe compass directory has on the order of 50 files in it. So all in we're looking at around 60 imports per file, which presumably means 60 resolve calls for 130 files, or around 8000 calls. That would make it something like 300 ms per call, which I'm pretty sure isn't what's happening. Yesterday when debugging I was dumping timings for resolution calls, and most were in the low tens of milliseconds, though about one in twenty clocked in at low hundreds.\nLet me know if this is enough information for you to go off of. If not, and you think it's worth the time, I'll hack the loader to add some timers to give a more concrete picture. Or, if it's easier for you, you can give me a custom version of sass-loader with whatever instrumentation you want, and I'll send you the output data.. Apologies for the silence: after I finally finished the conversion work on my project, the pressure to work on user-facing features out-prioritized my feeble attempts at community involvement.\nTo be honest, I didn't even want to do this test when I saw the variable name, since it sounded like a poor quality sledgehammer approach to the problem. I still firmly believe that even if resolving the problem internally inside webpack is the philosophically correct thing to do, given that lib-sass has a working solution to accommodate aliasing via import paths, sass-loader should provide its users with an escape hatch in case they want one.\nEither way, I refactored my project a bit to get back to a setup about which I originally posted, one with a top level scss file that imports 133 component-specific scss files. There were some library-specific files that I didn't bother with, so they'll show up stand-alone in the output. I do not know why webpack builds the whole thing twice \u2014 I didn't even know that it does before I put the instrumentation in. Instrumentation is basically the following timer:\n269     var startTime = new Date().getTime();\n270     asyncSassJobQueue.push(sassOptions, function onRender(err, result) {\n271         console.log(\"Took \" + (new Date().getTime() - startTime) + \" ms for \" + resourcePath);\nHere's what the numbers look like (resourcePath stripped for ease of reading/privacy).\nFirst, with the importer disabled (which is how I run it normally).\nTook 466 ms for lib/components/ImageOrPlaceholder/ImageOrPlaceholder.scss\nTook 257 ms for lib/components/RaisedButton/RaisedButton.scss\nTook 638 ms for lib/components/CircularProgress/CircularProgress.scss\nTook 867 ms for lib/components/IconButton/IconButton.scss\nTook 1187 ms for lib/components/TapCapture/TapCapture.scss\nTook 1210 ms for lib/components/FlatButton/FlatButton.scss\nTook 1355 ms for lib/components/Spinner/Spinner.scss\nTook 1439 ms for lib/components/TextField/TextField.scss\nTook 1586 ms for lib/components/ListItem/ListItem.scss\nTook 4532 ms for app/src/styles/top-level-everything-sass-loader-test.scss\nTook 3095 ms for lib/components/Photos/Photos.scss\nTook 71 ms for lib/components/ImageOrPlaceholder/ImageOrPlaceholder.scss\nTook 125 ms for lib/components/CircularProgress/CircularProgress.scss\nTook 146 ms for lib/components/RaisedButton/RaisedButton.scss\nTook 188 ms for lib/components/IconButton/IconButton.scss\nTook 221 ms for lib/components/Spinner/Spinner.scss\nTook 263 ms for lib/components/TapCapture/TapCapture.scss\nTook 288 ms for lib/components/FlatButton/FlatButton.scss\nTook 339 ms for lib/components/TextField/TextField.scss\nTook 379 ms for lib/components/Photos/Photos.scss\nTook 411 ms for lib/components/ListItem/ListItem.scss\nTook 1518 ms for app/src/styles/top-level-everything-sass-loader-test.scss\nNext, with the latest sass-loader from npm.

For instance, you can also alias paths\nYou can make an aliases directory, symlink whatever you need into there, and add it to includePaths. Works great.\nThere is also another good reason to use each technology's native features, rather than something like webpack's resolver, that I recently ran into with TypeScript. There are various text editors that support things like code completion, display errors as you edit, let you jump to definition, etc. These tools typically don't know how to read webpack's config and tease out alias information, so as far as they are concerned, the import/require statements are broken and point to non-existing files. Much like sass, TypeScript happens to have its own system for managing aliases/includes, through a tsconf.json file, which most editors understand. So while webpack's goal of providing a resolving engine that works across the whole stack is admirable, it breaks other tooling.\nI think your argument would convince me in the case if webpack just worked, out of the box. But if for advanced use cases you need to dig into the code to get things working, it doesn't matter whether webpack provides advanced functionality, or whether you hack it yourself with symlinks or something \u2014\u00a0you spend the same amount of time. Now, I understand that your efforts are actually geared specifically at getting webpack to the point where everything just works out of the box. But I personally believe that this goal is impossible to achieve, because new versions of various technologies come out at about the same speed as it takes to polish off an out-of-the-box-working toolchain to support them. So by the time everything works great with webpack, there will be some new kid on the block, also as cool and must-switch-over-to, and as not-working-out-of-the-box for advanced use cases. This probably sounds cynical, but I've seen it happen enough times now to see a pattern. Though who knows, maybe we'll reach some kind of equilibrium point once a toolchain that satisfies most common use cases emerges.\nAnyway, sorry for rambling. It's a month since I finished the stack transition, and I got my momentum back, so now I can afford a few cycles here and there to at least give you metrics if you need them. So let me know if you need to test anything against my setup, whether the artificial one-big-file-with-many-imports, or the actual one that I use, where each components' .scss file is require'd at the top of the .ts file.. @evilebottnawi Is something blocked on me?

Apologies for the silence: after I finally finished the conversion work on my project, the pressure to work on user-facing features out-prioritized my feeble attempts at community involvement.\nTo be honest, I didn't even want to do this test when I saw the variable name, since it sounded like a poor quality sledgehammer approach to the problem. I still firmly believe that even if resolving the problem internally inside webpack is the philosophically correct thing to do, given that lib-sass has a working solution to accommodate aliasing via import paths, sass-loader should provide its users with an escape hatch in case they want one.\nEither way, I refactored my project a bit to get back to a setup about which I originally posted, one with a top level scss file that imports 133 component-specific scss files. There were some library-specific files that I didn't bother with, so they'll show up stand-alone in the output. I do not know why webpack builds the whole thing twice \u2014 I didn't even know that it does before I put the instrumentation in. Instrumentation is basically the following timer:\n269     var startTime = new Date().getTime();\n270     asyncSassJobQueue.push(sassOptions, function onRender(err, result) {\n271         console.log(\"Took \" + (new Date().getTime() - startTime) + \" ms for \" + resourcePath);\nHere's what the numbers look like (resourcePath stripped for ease of reading/privacy).\nFirst, with the importer disabled (which is how I run it normally).\nTook 466 ms for lib/components/ImageOrPlaceholder/ImageOrPlaceholder.scss\nTook 257 ms for lib/components/RaisedButton/RaisedButton.scss\nTook 638 ms for lib/components/CircularProgress/CircularProgress.scss\nTook 867 ms for lib/components/IconButton/IconButton.scss\nTook 1187 ms for lib/components/TapCapture/TapCapture.scss\nTook 1210 ms for lib/components/FlatButton/FlatButton.scss\nTook 1355 ms for lib/components/Spinner/Spinner.scss\nTook 1439 ms for lib/components/TextField/TextField.scss\nTook 1586 ms for lib/components/ListItem/ListItem.scss\nTook 4532 ms for app/src/styles/top-level-everything-sass-loader-test.scss\nTook 3095 ms for lib/components/Photos/Photos.scss\nTook 71 ms for lib/components/ImageOrPlaceholder/ImageOrPlaceholder.scss\nTook 125 ms for lib/components/CircularProgress/CircularProgress.scss\nTook 146 ms for lib/components/RaisedButton/RaisedButton.scss\nTook 188 ms for lib/components/IconButton/IconButton.scss\nTook 221 ms for lib/components/Spinner/Spinner.scss\nTook 263 ms for lib/components/TapCapture/TapCapture.scss\nTook 288 ms for lib/components/FlatButton/FlatButton.scss\nTook 339 ms for lib/components/TextField/TextField.scss\nTook 379 ms for lib/components/Photos/Photos.scss\nTook 411 ms for lib/components/ListItem/ListItem.scss\nTook 1518 ms for app/src/styles/top-level-everything-sass-loader-test.scss\nNext, with the latest sass-loader from npm.

For instance, you can also alias paths\nYou can make an aliases directory, symlink whatever you need into there, and add it to includePaths. Works great.\nThere is also another good reason to use each technology's native features, rather than something like webpack's resolver, that I recently ran into with TypeScript. There are various text editors that support things like code completion, display errors as you edit, let you jump to definition, etc. These tools typically don't know how to read webpack's config and tease out alias information, so as far as they are concerned, the import/require statements are broken and point to non-existing files. Much like sass, TypeScript happens to have its own system for managing aliases/includes, through a tsconf.json file, which most editors understand. So while webpack's goal of providing a resolving engine that works across the whole stack is admirable, it breaks other tooling.\nI think your argument would convince me in the case if webpack just worked, out of the box. But if for advanced use cases you need to dig into the code to get things working, it doesn't matter whether webpack provides advanced functionality, or whether you hack it yourself with symlinks or something \u2014\u00a0you spend the same amount of time. Now, I understand that your efforts are actually geared specifically at getting webpack to the point where everything just works out of the box. But I personally believe that this goal is impossible to achieve, because new versions of various technologies come out at about the same speed as it takes to polish off an out-of-the-box-working toolchain to support them. So by the time everything works great with webpack, there will be some new kid on the block, also as cool and must-switch-over-to, and as not-working-out-of-the-box for advanced use cases. This probably sounds cynical, but I've seen it happen enough times now to see a pattern. Though who knows, maybe we'll reach some kind of equilibrium point once a toolchain that satisfies most common use cases emerges.\nAnyway, sorry for rambling. It's a month since I finished the stack transition, and I got my momentum back, so now I can afford a few cycles here and there to at least give you metrics if you need them. So let me know if you need to test anything against my setup, whether the artificial one-big-file-with-many-imports, or the actual one that I use, where each components' .scss file is require'd at the top of the .ts file.. @evilebottnawi Is something blocked on me?

I wonder why this is actually needed at all,  since minimize  in css-loader will minify the CSS anyways :). \ud83d\ude06 I wanted to post exactly this link right now :). Hmm... doesn't cssnano (css-loader) handle colors aswell (not sure) ? . If webpack -p || webpack --optimize-minimize is used css-loader's loaderContext.minimize will run cssnano :), sass-loader can't be used standalone atm.

Thus you are able to control the versions accurately.\n@flimshaw If it isn't referenced as a peerDependency in package.json please add  it as such instead . Since node-sass (libsass) is a Node Native Module, it's better to leave it as a peerDependency for now (reconsider maybe, when N-API is a thing) so everyone can specify the version he/she needs/works. Thx \ud83d\ude1b . Agreeing with @evilebottnawi here, dart-sass is still under 'heavy' development and doesn't cover the whole SASS spec yet. @bebraw @d3viant0ne Does one of you have acces here? \ud83d\ude1b  It's seems @jhnns is busy atm. @avivshafir Can you please provide a bit more context, the fix here is a semver patch && node-sass is should normally be a peerDependency you as the user control the version. But I'm not \ud83d\udcaf sure I understood the node-sass part correctly \ud83d\ude1b . We have npm access problems atm (no one reachable) \ud83d\ude05 , but maybe we need another fix anyways \ud83d\ude1b . @avivshafir Does v6.0.5 pulled from master npm i -D webpack-contrib/sass-loader fix the issue for you, could/did you test it ? \ud83d\ude43 . @avivshafir Thx appreciated. #450 . @someok @Maxouhell v6.0.5.

If it still doesn't work please open an issue in angular/angular-cli. See https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/issues/239. This seems to be resolved, closing for now, but feel free to reopen if still regressions related to sass-loader :). Besides the includePaths workaround there is no (clean) way to fix that atm, it would require node-sass to expose a hook to rewrite the @import paths before importing the contents\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-graph\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-module-importer\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-package-importer\nOr writing our own :)\n. https://github.com/sass/node-sass#importer--v200---experimental. It will require changes to sass-loader I would say, for the webpack glue (pre-resolving). What do you exactly mean by fix ? \ud83d\ude1b . If possible we should do it :), I'm not too familiar with sass-loader internals and need to take a look myself first, if you have something in mind just propose it \ud83d\ude1b . It doesn't work at all or does it just displays a warning for an unmet peerDependency?. fix or better feature ? :). https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#examples. @baunegaard Your issue is that webpack.config.js isn't in <Project Root> so  process.cwd() will resolve to <Project Root>/Assets/path/to/webpack.config.js which is appended internally by webpack, could you try by temporarily moving webpack.config.js in <Project Root> to verify please? I think your fix is correct, it should resolve to an absolute path and using __dirname instead of process.cwd(), but not \ud83d\udcaf tbh. webpack.config.resolve = { extensions: [ '.js' '.scss' ... ] } resolve.extensions or import 'scss/modules.container.scss' :warning: Note the file extension in the import path. Please reopen this at node-sass (libsass) instead this looks like a bug in the sass itself without being affected by the way webpack integrates with sass . Not directly for SASS, but you could consider using postcss-custom-properties and enhance the PostCSS AST with the variables as long as browser support for CSS Custom Properties isn't mature enough. The plugin has a fallback option doing exactly what you're tying to achieve via a mixin atm. Otherwise your approach works just fine since it's nearly using the same logic. Closing as there is nothing we can do to fix this in the scope of sass-loader itself. @chacbumbum Please show the incorrect styles (output), nesting inside :global might be a problem. Yep sure, but sass-loader (nesting) runs before css-loader (CSS Modules), so maybe the sass compiler messes up on :global (unknown in sass) + nesting (producing incorrect styles). I need the actual output to verify that assumption :). @jainshravan123 Are you sure this warning comes from sass-loader (maybe invalid npm cache)? The loader is updated to use the new method for options parsing for a while now. Where did you add them could you search for loaderUtils.parseQueryin node_modules/sass-loader ?  Did you delete node_modules && your  lockfile (maybe npm cache clean --force) and a tried a fresh install ?  . @crazyx13th Is data for e.g passing custom variables ? If so feel free to tackle this and send a PR I will assist if needed or do it when I have time. This is also needed to implement watching these . @markbrown4 Feel free to reopen if still any problems. https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/lib/normalizeOptions.js#L27-L29\nMaybe ditch loaderContext.minimize . Does compress anything special in terms of SASS 'minification'?  I wonder why this is actually needed at all,  since minimize  in css-loader will minify the CSS anyways :). \ud83d\ude06 I wanted to post exactly this link right now :). Hmm... doesn't cssnano (css-loader) handle colors aswell (not sure) ? . If webpack -p || webpack --optimize-minimize is used css-loader's loaderContext.minimize will run cssnano :), sass-loader can't be used standalone atm. If folks want to use compressed mode, set options.outputStyle explicitly ?. @rhys-vdw Should be https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack instead, mind spinning up a quick PR ? \ud83d\ude1b . https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/pull/532. > The sass-loader requires node-sass and webpack as peerDependency. Thus you are able to control the versions accurately.\n@flimshaw If it isn't referenced as a peerDependency in package.json please add  it as such instead . Since node-sass (libsass) is a Node Native Module, it's better to leave it as a peerDependency for now (reconsider maybe, when N-API is a thing) so everyone can specify the version he/she needs/works. Thx \ud83d\ude1b . Agreeing with @evilebottnawi here, dart-sass is still under 'heavy' development and doesn't cover the whole SASS spec yet. @bebraw @d3viant0ne Does one of you have acces here? \ud83d\ude1b  It's seems @jhnns is busy atm. @avivshafir Can you please provide a bit more context, the fix here is a semver patch && node-sass is should normally be a peerDependency you as the user control the version. But I'm not \ud83d\udcaf sure I understood the node-sass part correctly \ud83d\ude1b . We have npm access problems atm (no one reachable) \ud83d\ude05 , but maybe we need another fix anyways \ud83d\ude1b . @avivshafir Does v6.0.5 pulled from master npm i -D webpack-contrib/sass-loader fix the issue for you, could/did you test it ? \ud83d\ude43 . @avivshafir Thx appreciated. #450 . @someok @Maxouhell v6.0.5. Sry that's the responsibility of one of the core members, I will try to ping one in slack, tbh I thought it's up already with a release tagged \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. cc @jtangelder @akiran . @dwjft sass-loader version (@latest) ?. @Stephen2 https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/pull/532 \n\u26a0\ufe0f If you use { loader: 'postcss-loader', options: { sourceMap: 'inline' } } the source map is inlined in the CSS as an annotation comment by postcss-loader, therefore css-loader doesn't have any effect on the map anymore. { loader: 'style-loader', options: { sourceMap: true } } \nIt's on master (css-loader) now and a release should be underway, yes it's a known issue if you have a few minutes, you could try if it works for you by npm i -D webpack-contrib/css-loader\nFeedback would be appreciated \ud83d\ude1b . > remove postcss loader = paths good!\nJust to clearify, you mean with sass-loader applied? (style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader) \ud83d\ude1b \n\nDon't know if that helps or has just confused everything...\n\nNo no the opposite \ud83d\ude43 , it's appreciated, could you post some info on what is off, when postcss-loader is used, so I can fix it there :).

    "borela": "@DanielRamosAcosta \nhttps://github.com/ctrine/webpack-settings/blob/master/packages/shared/src/rules/sass-module.js. I do on webpack but when I use the @import './someDir/someFile command from sass with relative paths, it doesn't use webpack's resolver so I can't omit the extension mscss. Is there any setting to allow this?. Yeah, I'been using this config and at the time of this issue, it wasn't adding the extensions from webpack's config but I see that there changes made to the repo.\nI'll check if the error still exists :D.. The current behaviour is actually a bug as mentioned here.. It's how CSS modules work they are local by default, in your example you could also write as:\n```SASS\n.el1 {\n  // :global is a switch, everything after it becomes global.\n  :global .sub1 {\n  }\n}\n.el1 {\n  :global {\n    .sub1 {\n    }\n    .sub2 {\n    }\n  }\n}\n````\nPersonally I use different extensions, .mscss for files that contain modules and  .scss for files without modules, that way I can write global css without enveloping them in the :global switch.. I believe you need to add the directories to the includePaths to help resolve the files like so https://github.com/ctrine/webpack-settings/blob/master/packages/shared/src/rules/sass-module.js. @import \"~@material/button/mdc-button/mdc-button.scss\";\nOr ask the owner of the package to add a main field in the package.json. @marekpw got it, you need to add includePaths like so:\n```js\nconst { dirname, join, resolve } = require('path');\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\nmodule.exports = {\n    context: resolve('src'),\n    entry: {\n        app: './main.scss'\n    },\n    output: {\n        filename: '[name].[hash].js',\n        path: resolve('dist')\n    },\nresolve: {\n    extensions: ['.js', '.scss']\n},\n\nmodule: {\n    rules: [\n        {\n            test: /\\.scss$/,\n            use: [{\n                loader: \"style-loader\" // creates style nodes from JS strings\n            }, {\n                loader: \"css-loader\" // translates CSS into CommonJS\n            }, {\n                loader: \"sass-loader\", // compiles Sass to CSS\n                options: {\n                  includePaths: [\n                    join(dirname(module.filename), 'node_modules')\n                  ]\n                }\n            }]\n        }\n    ],\n}\n\n};\n```\nHere's a full package for compiling websites in you case you need hot reloading too.. @evilebottnawi What's the other option?. @evilebottnawi I believe this bug was introduced before then, I had been using the includePath even for non scoped packages for a long time because the loader isn't using webpack's resolver, which is why I suggested custom extensions here. \nIt did seam counter intuitive to me to have to duplicate the paths from webpack's resolve.modules.. @evilebottnawi Thank you, I wish I could offer better help but I am still learning how webpack loaders work. . @DanielRamosAcosta \nhttps://github.com/ctrine/webpack-settings/blob/master/packages/shared/src/rules/sass-module.js. I do on webpack but when I use the @import './someDir/someFile command from sass with relative paths, it doesn't use webpack's resolver so I can't omit the extension mscss. Is there any setting to allow this?. Yeah, I'been using this config and at the time of this issue, it wasn't adding the extensions from webpack's config but I see that there changes made to the repo.\nI'll check if the error still exists :D..

be with vue-loader or sass-loader as they don't seem to work together. If I import 'foundation' via app.js file things work fine, if I do import foundation from withing vue component things begin to break down. But most recent vue-loader still works fine with sass-loader@4.1.1 and LoaderOptionsPlugin with the same setup where I @import 'foundation' from within component. . A hack solution is definitely better then no solution thanks. Do you think it is the problem with vue-loader?. \nWell vue references the file format in style section and utilises sass-loader, so I do not see the reason why it can't read setting from inside sass-loader options, it's successfully does that from babel and typescript loaders. So it's either some adjustments could be done to sass-loader or to vue-loader and as I have noticed mac users do not complain about this issue. I might be wrong anyhow. It just feels wierd to concentrate includePaths inside vue loader pipeline. \nOn 28 Feb 2017, 12:55, at 12:55, Johannes Ewald notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n\nA hack solution is definitely better then no solution thanks\n\nOh, I don't think that this is a hack solution. Since a vue file can\nhost a lot of file types, it makes sense to have a dedicated loader\npipeline because webpack's loader test algorithm wouldn't work here.\n-- \nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/366#issuecomment-283031636\n. @jhnns Thank you a lot for this library, and your support. I understand your point, I think that vue-loader with their custom pipeline could added a feature that if no additional setting provided into the pipeline, vue-loader could use default options from sass loader config, that would be definitely convenient. . @jhnns disregard my previous comment, I did a mistake on my end so I deleted that comment everything works as you said. . I have updated my sass-loader-test repo https://github.com/asolopovas/sass-loader-test, to reflect the problem if you start index.html in public folder and inspect p.animate tag in inspect section the path will be shown as D:/path/sass-loader-test/resources/assets/sass/D:\\path\\sass-loader-test/resources\\assets\\sass\\app.scss. Tested it on windows ubuntu bash and sourcemaps path was fine.. Same happens if you do run npm run test-source-map on the package itself so clearly is something wrong about it. . Please respond someone its been a month since I created an issue. I have spent some time playing around and found that if I changeline 74 of loader.js,  to result.map.sourceRoot = ''; problem goes away. @jhnns it may be related to https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/366 . @evilebottnawi Hi thanks for responding, here is the screenshots, I have tested it on different machines and few various projects everywhere I get the same problem, I eventually gave up and used gulp sass to generate my stylesheets along with browser-sync to inject them on fly it actually does it a bit faster. If you look at the repository provided above and generate it by simply running npm install + composer install + webpack, it will generate js script with source code in it and then if you open index.html you will see the error that I provided screenshots for. \n\n\n\n. @evilebottnawi I love windows, I hate their filesystem, they should have adopted it long time ago and nobody would be using mac right now. But if you fiddle a bit you can figure thing oit. @pamtbaau  solution works on 4.1.1,  I am not suggesting  that it does on 5.  But version 4.1.1 does not work with options.includePaths either. . @pamtbaau if you read through  documentation you will see that it should be working without LoaderOptionsPlugin,  that's the point I am trying to make. . I will tomorrow . @jhnns here you go I have created two webpack configs one that works second one that fails\nhttps://github.com/asolopovas/sass-loader-test. @jhnns I have tried webpack 2.2.1 with both sass-loader@5.0.0 and sass-loader@5.0.1 both throw an error if I place includePaths into options of sass loader like that: \n{\n                        loader: 'sass-loader',\n                        options: {\n                            includePaths: [\n                                path.resolve(__dirname, 'vendor/zurb/foundation/scss'),\n                                path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/motion-ui/src'),\n                                path.resolve(__dirname, 'resources/assets/sass')\n                            ],\n                            sourceMap: true\n                        }\n                    }\nWhich has not worked in the repository provided in webpack.config.error.js, I tested it on windows 10 x64 machine so clearly something fails. . @jhnns next time I will. Thanks for reopening . Still does not work on my machine. \n```\nts-loader: Using typescript@2.2.1 and C:\\vhosts\\3oakdb\\tsconfig.json\nwebpack built 60ee2be6571715396cd7 in 13194ms\nHash: 60ee2be6571715396cd7\nVersion:

be with vue-loader or sass-loader as they don't seem to work together. If I import 'foundation' via app.js file things work fine, if I do import foundation from withing vue component things begin to break down. But most recent vue-loader still works fine with sass-loader@4.1.1 and LoaderOptionsPlugin with the same setup where I @import 'foundation' from within component. . A hack solution is definitely better then no solution thanks. Do you think it is the problem with vue-loader?. \nWell vue references the file format in style section and utilises sass-loader, so I do not see the reason why it can't read setting from inside sass-loader options, it's successfully does that from babel and typescript loaders. So it's either some adjustments could be done to sass-loader or to vue-loader and as I have noticed mac users do not complain about this issue. I might be wrong anyhow. It just feels wierd to concentrate includePaths inside vue loader pipeline. \nOn 28 Feb 2017, 12:55, at 12:55, Johannes Ewald notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n\nA hack solution is definitely better then no solution thanks\n\nOh, I don't think that this is a hack solution. Since a vue file can\nhost a lot of file types, it makes sense to have a dedicated loader\npipeline because webpack's loader test algorithm wouldn't work here.\n-- \nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/366#issuecomment-283031636\n. @jhnns Thank you a lot for this library, and your support. I understand your point, I think that vue-loader with their custom pipeline could added a feature that if no additional setting provided into the pipeline, vue-loader could use default options from sass loader config, that would be definitely convenient. . @jhnns disregard my previous comment, I did a mistake on my end so I deleted that comment everything works as you said. . I have updated my sass-loader-test repo https://github.com/asolopovas/sass-loader-test, to reflect the problem if you start index.html in public folder and inspect p.animate tag in inspect section the path will be shown as D:/path/sass-loader-test/resources/assets/sass/D:\\path\\sass-loader-test/resources\\assets\\sass\\app.scss. Tested it on windows ubuntu bash and sourcemaps path was fine.. Same happens if you do run npm run test-source-map on the package itself so clearly is something wrong about it. . Please respond someone its been a month since I created an issue. I have spent some time playing around and found that if I changeline 74 of loader.js,  to result.map.sourceRoot = ''; problem goes away. @jhnns it may be related to https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/366 . @evilebottnawi Hi thanks for responding, here is the screenshots, I have tested it on different machines and few various projects everywhere I get the same problem, I eventually gave up and used gulp sass to generate my stylesheets along with browser-sync to inject them on fly it actually does it a bit faster. If you look at the repository provided above and generate it by simply running npm install + composer install + webpack, it will generate js script with source code in it and then if you open index.html you will see the error that I provided screenshots for. \n\n\n\n. @evilebottnawi I love windows, I hate their filesystem, they should have adopted it long time ago and nobody would be using mac right now. But if you fiddle a bit you can figure thing oit. ",

Most of the day was spent configuring and trying to get a development process in order as well jumping from Guides, Documentation, and Plugin pages working on piece by piece setup instead of some hand holding guide to get a new person up and running and then say \"ok here's a ton of advanced options to setup your specific environment for you specific needs\". I feel like a lot of people after reviewing my issues I was having yesterday may be feeling the same way. \nIMO having a Guide to the tune of something like: \n\nWebpack Installation \nCSS loader installation \nOptional Sass/Less loader installation + ExtractTextPlugin\nJSX/Babel loader installation \nHtmlWebpackPlugin installation\nHMR replacement installation\nWebpack Dev Server\nSet your npm start script\nRun your server have fun\n\nthat builds on itself, for me, that is all I need to get going just like using Grunt/Gulp from a starting standpoint. From there environment topics can be brought in and a myriad of other options can be opened up after having a working config. Again imo might make everything much more approachable and new people are following set standards in those Guides and getting everyone on the same page before opening the flood gates.\n. @jhnns Thanks for the response. I'm going to hop over to that other conversation you sent and read through the discussion. \nI totally agree keep Webpack low level but adding in some type of command to add the desired modules so you can get going quickly. Would not like to see another Grunt Gulp battle ensue with Code over Configuration and everyone arguing back and forth. But, rather if you need to customize deeper you can, or from a very high level you can get your development environment running. \nI'll make a PR for the Extract Text Plugin so users hopefully aren't running into the same issue I was. . @xXanth0s \nTo fix this I did the following:\n\nCreated Font Loader Variable (before module.exports={...})\nvar fontLocal = 'file-loader?name=[name].[ext]\nvar fontBundle = 'file-loader?name=assets/fonts/[name].[ext]\n\n\nCreated ternary operator (before module.exports={...})\nvar fontConfig = isBundle ? fontBundle : fontLocal;\n\n\nUpdate loader to use fontConfig (inside module.exports={...})\ntest: /\\.(eot|ttf|woff|woff2)$/, loader: fontConfig\n\n\n\nFor clarification, I use \"Local\" for \"Development\" or \"Dev\" and \"Bundle\"  for \"Production\" or \"Prod\" or \"Build\". There're specific reasons for this, just so that's clear. \nThe other possibility (and this was another issue I had) was loader ordering. So in the documentation I never found where it said the order in which to place your loaders. Common sense would be left to right for first to last in a Western English speaking world. In UNIX it's the opposite for whatever reason there is for that (would love to know more about this). There's a SO article that I was trying to find discussing this but unable to turn it up, where I was able to get some high level answers. \nSo my new, working, ordering for my CSS loaders is use: ['css-loader','resolve-url-loader','postcss-loader','sass-loader']\nHopefully this answers the issue you were having as well or at least helps. . @jhnns So I've updated the config to what you suggested.\nHowever you're suggestion use: ['css-loader', 'postcss-loader', 'resolve-url-loader', 'sass-loader'], broke the resolve-url-loader for custom fonts that were needed (if only everything could be a Google Font).\nSo I updated to: use: ['css-loader','resolve-url-loader','postcss-loader','sass-loader'],. \nNow comments are working as expected and fonts are loading in. My question now is this ordering doesn't make any sense. \nTo reconfirm the loaders are reading right to left? Trying to find a mention in the docs but not having any luck. .

Making more verbose docs (with clear examples) can alleviate a lot of simply questions and  understanding of concepts.. I'm going to put together some documentation so there's a more 1:1 comparison make things a bit easier. . I was having a similar issue, with Sass-Loader not working with a .scss file.\n.scss file\na{display: flex;}\nMy solution was found here: Webpack 2: How to extract Sass and convert to css file #263 \nJust added a new rule for .scss files and is working as expected so far\n...\nmodule: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n          fallback: \"style-loader\",\n          use: \"css-loader\"\n        })\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.scss$/,\n        loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n          fallback: \"style-loader\",\n          use: \"css-loader!sass-loader\",\n        }),\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n.... @jhnns I understand fully that Webpack only understand JavaScript as well there needs to be a rule for Sass `.scss` files after going through a much better put together Introduction for v2.2.\n\nThe issue here is that on the Extract Text Webpack Plugin documentation following that guide only produced errors in Sass compilation explicitly at use: ['css-loader', 'sass-loader']\nTo understand more of the issue you can look at the exact setup I was working with Unable to parse Sass (.scss) #424\nThe solution was to replace use: ['css-loader', 'sass-loader'] (that's written in the documentation) to use: \"css-loader!sass-loader\" that was found in the reference issue above.\nIn the end it feels like the Webpack documentation is still very confusing on getting setup. Most of the day was spent configuring and trying to get a development process in order as well jumping from Guides, Documentation, and Plugin pages working on piece by piece setup instead of some hand holding guide to get a new person up and running and then say \"ok here's a ton of advanced options to setup your specific environment for you specific needs\". I feel like a lot of people after reviewing my issues I was having yesterday may be feeling the same way. \nIMO having a Guide to the tune of something like: \n\nWebpack Installation \nCSS loader installation \nOptional Sass/Less loader installation + ExtractTextPlugin\nJSX/Babel loader installation \nHtmlWebpackPlugin installation\nHMR replacement installation\nWebpack Dev Server\nSet your npm start script\nRun your server have fun\n\nthat builds on itself, for me, that is all I need to get going just like using Grunt/Gulp from a starting standpoint. From there environment topics can be brought in and a myriad of other options can be opened up after having a working config. Again imo might make everything much more approachable and new people are following set standards in those Guides and getting everyone on the same page before opening the flood gates.\n. @jhnns Thanks for the response. I'm going to hop over to that other conversation you sent and read through the discussion. \nI totally agree keep Webpack low level but adding in some type of command to add the desired modules so you can get going quickly. Would not like to see another Grunt Gulp battle ensue with Code over Configuration and everyone arguing back and forth. But, rather if you need to customize deeper you can, or from a very high level you can get your development environment running. \nI'll make a PR for the Extract Text Plugin so users hopefully aren't running into the same issue I was. . @xXanth0s \nTo fix this I did the following:\n\nCreated Font Loader Variable (before module.exports={...})\nvar fontLocal = 'file-loader?name=[name].[ext]\nvar fontBundle = 'file-loader?name=assets/fonts/[name].[ext]\n\n\nCreated ternary operator (before module.exports={...})\nvar fontConfig = isBundle ? fontBundle : fontLocal;\n\n\nUpdate loader to use fontConfig (inside module.exports={...})\ntest: /\\.(eot|ttf|woff|woff2)$/, loader: fontConfig\n\n\n\nFor clarification, I use \"Local\" for \"Development\" or \"Dev\" and \"Bundle\"  for \"Production\" or \"Prod\" or \"Build\". There're specific reasons for this, just so that's clear. \nThe other possibility (and this was another issue I had) was loader ordering. So in the documentation I never found where it said the order in which to place your loaders. Common sense would be left to right for first to last in a Western English speaking world. In UNIX it's the opposite for whatever reason there is for that (would love to know more about this). There's a SO article that I was trying to find discussing this but unable to turn it up, where I was able to get some high level answers. \nSo my new, working, ordering for my CSS loaders is use: ['css-loader','resolve-url-loader','postcss-loader','sass-loader']\nHopefully this answers the issue you were having as well or at least helps. . @jhnns So I've updated the config to what you suggested.\nHowever you're suggestion use: ['css-loader', 'postcss-loader', 'resolve-url-loader', 'sass-loader'], broke the resolve-url-loader for custom fonts that were needed (if only everything could be a Google Font).\nSo I updated to: use: ['css-loader','resolve-url-loader','postcss-loader','sass-loader'],. \nNow comments are working as expected and fonts are loading in. My question now is this ordering doesn't make any sense. \nTo reconfirm the loaders are reading right to left? Trying to find a mention in the docs but not having any luck. .

For now, I'm just keeping ^3.0.0 from node-sass, but its not a solution as I always get an UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY from sass-loader when I npm install my project.\nindex.sass\n:local(.container)\n  padding-top: 20px\nnode-sass ^3.0.0\njavascript\nimport sass from 'node-sass';\nconst result = sass.renderSync({ file: './index.sass' });\nconsole.log(result);\n/*\n{\n  stats: \n  {\n    entry: './index.sass',\n    start: 1488802011040,\n    includedFiles: [ './index.sass' ],\n    end: 1488802011047,\n    duration: 7,\n  },\n  css: <Buffer 3a 6c 6f 63 61 6c 28 2e ... >\n}\n*/\nnode-sass ^4.0.0\njavascript\nimport sass from 'node-sass';\nconst result = sass.renderSync({ file: './index.sass' });\n/*\nError: Invalid CSS after \"l\": expected 1 selector or at-rule, was \"local(.container): \"\n    at Object.module.exports.renderSync (./node_modules/node-sass/lib/index.js:439:16)\n    at repl:1:19\n    at ContextifyScript.Script.runInThisContext (vm.js:23:33)\n    at REPLServer.defaultEval (repl.js:336:29)\n    at bound (domain.js:280:14)\n    at REPLServer.runBound [as eval] (domain.js:293:12)\n    at REPLServer.onLine (repl.js:533:10)\n    at emitOne (events.js:101:20)\n    at REPLServer.emit (events.js:191:7)\n    at REPLServer.Interface._onLine (readline.js:238:10)\n*/.
