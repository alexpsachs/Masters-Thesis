    "soffes": "Converting to something like EGO's gradient view using the CALayer instead of CG might be better.\n. Since it has been reimplemented, this is no longer an issue.\n. Raise an exception if the collection view data source doesn't return an item like UITableView does. Closed by 2a6faca7400fc9243ee5b8c7394b47c3828b4d32\n. Updated SSLabel defaults and fixed SSCollectionView demo. Closed by 95079fbf31cb59415d2280ea42b7495e56344295\n. That would be sweet. I was thinking it would probably be best and re-implement it. The only thing that sucks is that you would have to tell it which view to add itself to. Maybe there is some UIWindow hackery that we can do (which is how UIAlertView works).\n. Ture, but how would you guarantee that it says on top?\n. Awesome! Totally didn't realize that UIView had a window method.\n. Finished!\n. It would also be great if it handled being drawn vertically as well.\n. Added shadowOffset to SSLoadingView. Closed by 4baf0153b927d7eaab12047f5f1894a6599f3f40\n. Turns out I'm dumb and this was already there.\n. Re-layout when properties change. Closed by 499831d59f47b5a398cac3ab0d8f922c451d225d\n. There are a lot of parameters in drawing a radial gradient. That should be another class.\n. This has been implemented.\n. You should probably be using one of the following:\n``` objective-c\n/**\n @brief Sets the selected state of the item, optionally animating the transition between states.\n@param selected YES to set the item as selected, NO to set it as unselected.\n The default is NO.\n@param animated YES to animate the transition between selected states, NO to\n make the transition immediate.\nThe selection affects the appearance of labels, image, and background.

Closing this issue. If it's still an issue, please reopen.\n. Fixed in 676d7697731adc2814a73b636de0470f40b91329\n. SSViewController has been removed. The only reason this class existed was to provide a convenient subclass to match UITableViewController.\n. SSViewController has been removed.\n. Won't fix since you can do this with system stuff in iOS 5.\n. After further investigation, it appears that Doxyclean isn't carrying these across. I've been meaning to make my own. Probably my next project after I finish documenting the rest of SSToolkit.\n. All protocols have been documented! (except forSSModalViewController, which is deprecated)\n. Added in 26b6544c522a3a137bca8517c7010d71b409e4ce\n. Good catch. Fixed in abea88a2f3d6c417ea73c721f1aac6967bd2f667\n. This class has been removed from SSToolkit.\n. Turns out that this is so trivial, it's not even worth making. Yay?\n. This has been implemented. Forgot to close the issue.\n. Thanks!\n. Just noticed, ON appears to be shifted to the right.\n. Looks great! Merged!\n. Exactly. You can see a bit of blue or orange on the top right and bottom right corners. I was thinking that the on background should resize like the off background. It could just go to the middle of the handle instead of always to the right edge.\n. Oh, you're right. All four corners. Wanna tackle it? :)\n. @monoceroi thanks for the effort, but I'd like to avoid usingCALayerto do the clipping since that will have a big performance hit if the switch was in aUIScrollView.\n. I doubt many people would use it on its own. It's mainly for a cell accessory. I figured SSCatalog would just haveSSBadgeTableViewCell.\n. I cloned the one from Mail.app for the most part. They use images, but I useddrawRect:` so I could draw faster. Also drew the text instead of using a label for the same reason.\n. No worries man. Love it!\n. Leaving this issue open since the views still need documentation.\n. Thanks for documenting this!\n. Also, a demo in SSCatalog would be good.\n. Documented SSBadgeTableViewCell. Closed by 4d0fd296955893f6e94e1c33a33fef46a90d1c3d.\nFixed bug in SSCollectionViewItem.\n. That's the desired result. If you need to import both headers or:\n```\nimport \n```\nOnly including the minimum number of headers in header files and using @class when possible makes for faster compile times.\nGlad you got it figured out though :)\n. Good call. I was on the fence about adding that feature. I'll add it.\n. Haha just saw it. It totally looks like a chili :)\n. Automatically hide SSBadgeView if its text property is nil or empty. Closed by 9910ce548992170e403cf01bbb183200cab63a69\n. Thanks for you work, but I won't be merging this in. Promoting yourself a ton and asking for money in my framework isn't cool. Also, your DeviceHelper library already exists. If people need that functionality, the should just use your library.\n. I fixed the insetColor leak in 1ef2b7bacf4772d36ccbd69b1f18d1820f84ef92.\nInteresting about the colorWithWhite:alpha: leak. I'll have to check that out.\n. This has been implemented.\n. Documented new SSCollectionView methods. Closed by a68c5caeac6feac32f3bfeeecbd538fe0b0ae1ea.\nUpdated documentation style\n. Can you explain what you're doing where it makes sense to have a nil delegate? If you don't provide a delegate, the collection view can't draw anything since it doesn't know what size to draw things.\nI admit, this might not be the best design, but for now it will do.\n. Closing and going with your other solution. Thanks so much for you work!\n. Added to the SSToolkit website.\n. Looks great! Thanks so much. I'll merge it in shortly.\n. @stevebrewer there are timezones that aren't an hour off and this method doesn't make the test pass.\n. Got it. This is not an Apple thing by the way. If you look at the current code, its just using a function from time.h.\n. Thanks @Jilouc! I'm getting an error though.

Got it compiling, but the tests are failing. Any chance you could figure that out? There are 2 tests for this. The one that was failing is commented out. It would be amazing if both of them passed.\nThanks again for your help!\n. EPIC! Thanks so much @Jilouc!!! If you want to email me your address, I will send you a box of cookies as promised :)\n. @Jilouc by the way, using MIN was giving me a \"use of GNU statement expression extension\" warning. I just changed to fmin instead and it went away. I know that it doesn't need to be fmin since they are size_ts. Do you have a better solution?\n. Good call. I'm no C programmer. Stupid question: do you not have to free stuff that you do with strncpy?\n. That's what I was guessing. Thanks for the clarification!\n. There's a tests folder. Put it in the strings test file. Pull the latest if you don't see them.\n. I recently added tests in master and not stable. Not that the default branch is stable and not master. That way people don't pull stuff in progress.\n. You'll be listed here https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit/contributors once it refreshes.\n. Ya, I've wanted to do this from the beginning. It's pretty difficult and there is also some complexities that Springboard doesn't have with scrolling and such.\nFor example, if you have a grid of 100 things with 3 on a row and want to move the last one to the first position. That would be pretty difficult to make it not feel cumbersome.\nAnyway, I definitely want to do this, but probably won't get to it any time soon. Feel free to fork and implement it though :)\n. Definitely want to do this. I'll add this to the top of my list.\n. Oh awesome, I hadn't thought of the centered uncomplete row (To Governor Becomes Law). I'd definitely want to add this soonish.\n. I'm going to have time to work on this anytime soon. Feel free to fork and implement :)\n. Definitely. I hate IB so much. Did you see how ugly that commit made things? sigh\n. This has been fixed. Forgot to close the issue.\n. I fixed this recently. Are you sure you're using the latest?\n. It was fixed on the 14th. Please pull the latest and try again.\n. I've experienced this as well. It's an issue with the internal cache that gets cleared by the system when the application goes into the background. I'm working on fixing this today.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Fixed in c4982ee583084ef1ada6485e82533f635912af53\n. There isn't. There is already an issue for documenting this.\n. Try using a different style. Some styles don't implement those views.\n. I'll investigate.\n. I'll work on implementing these soon. You're right, they totally don't do anything :)\n. Known issue. Fixing once it GMs since it has been broken different in each beta.\n. Sweet. I'll probably switch to that for my demo.\n. This has been fixed in b36fa467d3049b94e441d8ed2df3b63541b1c310.\n. Good call. Thanks Evan!\n. Thanks for your work fixing this! I'd prefer to add this functionality in the class itself instead of inheriting from UIControl since a badge is not actually a control. I do something similar in SSCollectionViewItem.\nI can add this, or if you want to and send me a pull request, I'd gladly merge. Thanks again.\n. Thanks so much :)\n. Ha. Easy enough :) Thanks again!\n. Good catch!\n. I was unable to reproduce this.\nIn a541bc731b1cda09e493fcd772de8b7d1f34deb1 I made some minor tweaks SCImageCollectionViewItem that I think will solve your problem. My guess is that some of the images aren't loading or haven't loaded yet and are reusing previously loaded ones. That commit will solve this.\nIf you are still experiencing after trying my new changes, please open a new issue and post a sample project that demonstrates this bug.\nThanks!\n. Are you using the latest version? I believe I recently fixed this.\n. Looks good. Do you want to go ahead and add those methods? Until I finish my everything I have planned for 1.0, I'm not too concerned about breaking stuff :)\nAlso, don't forget to run the tests :)\n. Bump.\nAny interest in finishing this up @johnezang?\n. Invalid post v2.0.0. Feel free to make a PR in the corresponding library.\n. If you noticed, the graph doesn't go down when you enter or leave any view controller. I'm not really sure why that is... I'll investigate further.\n. I ended moving SSCatalog to its own repo. Thanks so much for this though. I think keeping it in its own repo is a lot cleaner.\n. Ha. This is cool. Not going to merge since there are so many changes and since Xcode will start adding it back anyway. Definitely very cool. Thanks WhitespaceBot :)\n. I tried adding two SSTextViews to a view controller's view and could not reproduce this. Can you provide some sample code so I can debug this a bit?\n. This is an issue with UIViewController and (to my knowledge) is unrelated to SSCollectionView.\n. Thanks!\n. Interesting. I'm sorry you're having trouble with it. I am using this functionality in a few of my apps and it's working fine. I wonder if it's something Core Data related specific to your situation. Here's the code I use in my delegate:\n``` objective-c\n- (void)controllerWillChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller {\n    [self.collectionView beginUpdates];\n}\n\n\n(void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller didChangeSection:(id )sectionInfo\n           atIndex:(NSUInteger)sectionIndex forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type {\nswitch(type) {\n    case NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert: {\n        [self.collectionView insertSections:[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:sectionIndex]\n                          withItemAnimation:SSCollectionViewItemAnimationFade];\n        break;\n}\ncase NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete: {\n    [self.collectionView deleteSections:[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:sectionIndex]\n                      withItemAnimation:SSCollectionViewItemAnimationFade];\n    break;\n    }\n}\n}\n\n\n(void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController )controller didChangeObject:(id)anObject\n       atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath )indexPath forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type\n      newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)newIndexPath {\nSSCollectionView *collectionView = self.collectionView;\nswitch(type) {\n    case NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert: {\n        [collectionView insertItemsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:newIndexPath]\n                              withItemAnimation:SSCollectionViewItemAnimationFade];\n        break;\n    }\ncase NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete: {\n    [collectionView deleteItemsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath]\n                          withItemAnimation:SSCollectionViewItemAnimationFade];\n    break;\n}\n\ncase NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate: {\n    [self _configureItem:[collectionView itemForIndexPath:indexPath] atIndexPath:indexPath];\n    break;\n}\n\ncase NSFetchedResultsChangeMove: {\n    [collectionView deleteItemsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath]\n                          withItemAnimation:SSCollectionViewItemAnimationFade];\n    [collectionView insertItemsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:newIndexPath]\n                          withItemAnimation:SSCollectionViewItemAnimationFade];\n    break;\n}\n\n}\n}\n\n\n(void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller {\n    [self.collectionView endUpdates];\n}\n``\n. You should simply set thecontentInsetof the collection view instead.\n. I believe this has been fixed. If this is still a problem, please reopen this issue.\n. Good call. Thanks!\n. Amazing. Thanks so much!\n. Looks good to me. Thanks!\n. Great idea! Send me a pull request with that implemented and tests, and I'll gladly merge it.\n. I'm not sure what you're suggesting.Always Search User Paths` is correct by default. Are you needing to change it to make SSToolkit work?\n. I'm hesitant to start adding stuff like this. There are tons of build options. I'm sure if you start changing many of them from the default, it would cause problems. Also, if you're adding header search paths and then disable then with another option, it's kind of common sense in my opinion that you should enabled them.\n\n\nSorry for all of the resistance on this. Hopefully that StackOverflow post is googleable enough :)\n. I haven't experienced this. Are you using a custom font? Can you provide a sample application that demonstrates this?\n. A sample project that reproduces this issue would be excellent.\nI have used SSCollectionView with NSFetchedResultsController in a number of applications. It is definitely possible there is an issue somewhere in SSCollectionView, but in my experience these messages usually a mismatch of the datasource and NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate are returning.\n. Thanks. I'll definitely add this in the future. I just spent the last hour fighting with appledoc. It keeps failing to create docsets. I'll have to hold off for now.\n. That would be excellent. If you can make the rake docs:publish work, that would be amazing.\n. Totally love everything here except the plural stuff. TTTLocalizedPluralString by @mattt is a much more complete solution. I'd let people use his fantastic library instead of starting to add support in SSToolkit since it is such a large problem.\nCan you send me a pull request without the plural stuff?\n. Thanks so much! Really great additions!\n.

Invalid post v2.0.0.\n. Best. Commit. Ever.\n. Not a fan of this. The whole point of SSLineView is to draw an inset easily. With a vertical line, you can't really guess which way the inset goes. If you want a vertical line without an inset, it's easiest to just use a UIView with a background color.\n\nI would consider merging this there was an inset direction. Something like SSLineViewInsetDirectionBefore and SSLineViewInsetDirectionAfter.\nIt just feels so silly investing time into such a silly class :)\n. Thanks for the patch. I'll review this as soon as I get a chance.\n. Can you merge master into your branch so it merges cleanly\n. Invalid post v2.0.0. Feel free to make a PR in the corresponding library.\n. @nayefc this is a table view thing. Table view sets the background of each row to its background color. To avoid this, use @webdevotion's suggestion:\nobjc\nUIView *backgroundView = [[UIView alloc] init];\nbackgroundView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:yourImage];\nself.collectionView.backgroundView = backgroundView;\nIt may be necessary to add this line. I can't remember off hand if it's needed or not.\nobjc\nself.collectionView.scrollView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];\n. Good call!\n. Looks great! Thanks!\n. Sorry about that.

Please attach a test project that reproduces this issue using the latest version of SSToolkit\n. No. It is forbidden to call [super dealloc] when using ARC since it is called automatically for you.\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed. My bad.\n. I feel like this used to be here and I removed it for some reason. Can't remember why though. It makes sense to me.\nBy the way, you should really switch to PSTCollectionView if you're on < iOS 6.0 or UICollectionView if you're on iOS 6.0.\n. Thanks!\n. Not sure what I think about this. Since my categories aren't namespaced, I don't want to pollute. Ideally, we should namespace and add the import, but that would break a lot of apps.\n. Thanks!\n. SSCollectionView is deprecated. Please use UICollectionView or PSTCollectionView.\n. Wow, whoever wrote this is code did a great job... :trollface:\nI would love to improve the iPad version sometime. I know we don't really have a need for that right now. Anyway, great work man. Thanks for copying this over!\n. Thanks!\n. Updated the website and released a new version with this. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome!\nSo day, week, month, and year are interesting. It depends on the specific day, etc. If you changed those to instance methods, I'd be for it. You'd have to do something like:\nobjc\n[[NSDate date] secondsInDay];\nThoughts?\n. There is a different amount of time in this month than there is next month. I'm not sure how stuff like day light savings time effects weeks and days.\nAnyway, for month and year, it should definitely require a date.

Can you remove SSHUDWindow since that is a private class? Also, can you remove all of the collection view components and make one collection view sub spec?\nThe SSToolkit sub spec seems to be a bit redundant :)\n. Ya. If you look in the SSToolkit Xcode project, there are several private classes. Those should just be combined with their owner.\n.

So, for example, git will show each commit as not being merged into the other branch. And, if we ever try to merge branches or whatever, it should work cause their won't be any merge conflicts (since it's the same exact code), but there will be a merge commit and two commits for the trimming methods.\nI'm not sure if this would work, but perhaps it'd be better to also keep the test code in the stable branch, but only merge in the master branch into the stable branch when the master is stable?

Now I am interested on what you want to achieve :eyes:\n. I've changed the \"secondsInPeriod\" methods to made them dependent on a given date. I'm not sure if tests are 100% accurate, because dealing with leap years, daylight saving times, etc. is complicated.\n. By the way, I think these methods can be refactored somehow. I'll see what I can do\n. I have finally refactored all those methods into a private method called secondsInPeriod:. I made it private because only a few date periods are supported and can't think of more reasonable date periods to get seconds for.\n. Would you mind if I open a new pull request with this stuff in a separate branch? I'd like to keep adding features to my fork and I'm kinda stuck in the master branch\n. That's why I changed the implementation. Now it's using NSCalendar and NSDateComponents to calculate the actual seconds on a given date:\nobjc\n[[NSDate date] secondsInMonth];\nshould now give you the seconds on May 2013 (the date of this post). The method returns the difference between the first second and the last second on current month. At least that's the intended behavior.\nI honestly don't know something more accurate in Foundation than NSCalendar for date calculations, but I'm open to suggestions :pensive:\n. I've added a category with a method to know the row where a UIView object has been added. Very useful when adding buttons to UITableViewCell objects, because you could do:\nobjective-c\n- (void)cellButtonTapped:(id)sender {\n  NSIndexPath *pathForButton = [self.tableView indexPathForRowContainingView:sender];\n}\nCredits to iOS Recipes's book as well.\n.
