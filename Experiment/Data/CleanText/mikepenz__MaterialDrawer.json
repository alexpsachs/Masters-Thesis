    "mikepenz": "@Rainer-Lang is theoretically already possible. \nGet the ListView from the Drawer.Result and pass a HeaderView to the list\nWill simplify this :D\n. @Rainer-Lang in :D Or at least a sample in the sample app. \n. @Rainer-Lang won't be that much work :D \nRight now you can pass your own adapter, or even your own listview. you con't have to use a list at all. so the sample just showcases the \"normal\" behavior. \nWith a small update i will allow custom IDrawerItem implementations. but more today :D\n. @Rainer-Lang the README is just about the minimalist setup. I'll add more sample to the sample app as soon as the project gets stable.\n. @Rainer-Lang so it's in :D See the sample / libs for details.\nIn fact a custom item for the drawer is defined by creating the item.xml and an class which implements the IDrawerItem interface. \n. @Rainer-Lang the drawer item itself is automatically selected. onClick. \nThe function that the first item is selected onStart will be added. \nAn API to select drawerItems trough the Drawer.Result object will be added too\n. @Rainer-Lang the included separator is default right now. I'll add more options to it. Also it should be possible to use custom DrawerItem implementations without much extra work.\n. @Rainer-Lang no bigger separator but you can now create your own DrawerItems :D I'll add the docu as soon as the whole thing is stable. All elements for a default Drawer following the guidelines are now included. See the Sample project to get some insights :)\n. Can you give a more detailed info about this?\n. makes sense :D \ni'll add an option to auto-create a drawer without toolbar. \nI'll also add a method to get the drawerToggle itself back :D. so you should be able to set a listener on it. and i'll remove the withOnActionBarDrawerToggle method.\n. @yoavst oh sorry. just saw the ActionBarDrawerToggle requires the view of the DrawerLayout\nThe Drawer class also allows you to set the drawerLayout view\nif you got the view you can also create the drawertoggle.\n. thanks :D\n. Just implemented this. will be up with v0.9.1\n. @Bene8493 that's a great question. \nright now the only option would be to define it by code. definitely need to changes this. \nI'll add a custom dimen definition so you can easily change it.\nxml\n<!-- Definition for the Drawer Slider margin right -->\n<dimen name=\"material_drawer_margin\">0dp</dimen>\n. currently i'm working with margin. so you can set the margin of the slider:\njava\nresult.getSlider()\nat the moment i'm thinking if it's better to be able to define a margin. or a width\n. yeah because on smaller devices google states to use 56dp margin. EDIT: ok not really\nThe width of the side nav is equal to the width of the screen minus the height of the action bar, or in this case 56dp from the right edge of the screen. The maximum width of the nav drawer is 5 times the standard increment (56dp on mobile and 64dp on tablet).\n5x56 = 280dp\n5x64 = 320dp\n. v0.9.2 includes a method to set the drawerWidth\nand/or you can overwrite a custom margin value ;)\nThanks for the report.\n. @Bene8493 as soon as maven central is synced you can use v0.9.2 or you can use v0.9.3-SNAPSHOT right now ;). \n. @tral you should implement it in your code. with the next version there'll be a onDrawerListener which notifies you onDrawerOpened or onDraewrClosed.\n. @intrications yes you are right. thanks. i'll work over the whole readme as soon as we reach v1.0.0\n. Hi. \nYeah you are right, there is no direct method call to check this. \nYou can do following:\njava\nresult.getDrawerLayout().isDrawerOpen(Gravity.START)\nwith the next version you can do it like this:\njava\nresult.isDrawerOpen()\n.

Here it is:\nhttp://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.mikepenz.materialdrawer%22\nDo you have a wrong setup of your build.gradle?\ndo you refer to mavenCentral() within the build.gradle or just to jCenter? probably jCenter hasn't synced the lib yet.\n. @aldefy ok great.\n. Oh sorry. that's an issue of the description. to get the colors working you also have to use the theme. \nAs an alternative you can also set the following values. (note the materialDrawer is used normally with an AppCompat theme)\n``` xml\n        @color/material_drawer_primary\n@color/material_drawer_primary_dark\n@color/material_drawer_accent\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@color/material_drawer_background</item>\n\n```\n.

Just check out the sample app how it's done. \nThe thing is the issues you face right now are not caused by the MaterialDrawer lib, it's just general Android design stuff :D\nHave you checked the sample app? Or do you need any infos regarding definitions or stuff set within the sample app?\n. @tral i'll close this issue, because it's not caused by the MaterialDrawer. \nyou can still write here, and i'll try to help you with the design. \nCheers.\n. If you use the theme provided by the lib, just overwrite the colors within the colors.xml as shown in the README.md\n. Workaround for what? the transparent toolbar? If you don't like it use your own style.\nbut then it has to set the primary, accent, ... colors. \nthe material_drawer colors and so on are used for elements within the library itself. so it makes sense.\n. You are right. \nThanks\n. You are right. \nThanks\n. Great that you were able to solve your issue :). \n. Great that you were able to solve your issue :). \n. The icons are created with the color set within the material_drawer_* colors. These are the colors mentioned within the google material docs (a direct grey value and not black with alpha)\nThe icons are generated as drawable, and i think this will ignore alpha values.\nYou can pass the icon as drawable if you need an alpha value. Just create it with the Android-Iconics library (which is a dependency of the MaterialDrawer) like this:\njava\nnew IconicsDrawable(this, FontAwesome.Icon.faw_adjust).alpha(50);\n. @h6ah4i that was also really fast ;). what have you done to solve it for you?\n. @h6ah4i the items use the default background, just with the StateListDrawable to show the selected list item. \nThere are 2 possible solutions:\n1. create your own DrawerItem implementation changing the way the background is set (just look at the source of the PrimaryDrawerItem)\n2. i will add another method for the drawerItem allowing you to overwrite the background\nI will look at it later today. It's probably a good idea to have the method to set the background per item. \n. @h6ah4i awesome :)\n. @Rainer-Lang you want the drawerToggle without animation? Not sure if this is possible.\nJust use the lib without the useActionBarDrawerToggle and handle the open and closeDrawer on your own ;). \nYou have to define your own drawable in the ActionBar/Toolbar and implement it as you would without the ActionBarDrawerToggle\n. @intrications as far as i can tell the AnimationDrawerToggle is meant to be animated. I would give you the advice to do it custom and open and close the drawer on its own. \n. Fixed in v0.9.8\n. @yoavst done ;)\n. @yoavst do you have screenshots or something?!\nI'm not really sure if and how this should be implemented\n. There are some RTL things included in the layout. So i use Gravity.END in many spaces \nhave you tried it already somewhere?\n. hmmm i've set gravity.START and gravity.Left to the default drawer\ntry to manually set the gravity with the withDrawerGravity method. \nFor the items themself. \n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n<ImageView\n    android:id=\"@+id/icon\"\n    android:layout_width=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary\"\n    android:layout_height=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary\"\n    android:paddingTop=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary_icon_padding\"\n    android:paddingBottom=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary_icon_padding\"\n    android:paddingRight=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary_icon_padding_right\"\n    android:paddingEnd=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary_icon_padding_right\"\n    android:layout_marginRight=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_padding\"\n    android:layout_marginEnd=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_padding\"\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center_vertical\"/>\n\n<TextView\n    android:id=\"@+id/badge\"\n    android:fontFamily=\"sans-serif\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:textSize=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary_text\"\n    android:gravity=\"center_vertical|end\"\n    android:textColor=\"@color/material_drawer_primary_text\"\n    android:layout_alignParentEnd=\"true\"\n    android:layout_alignParentRight=\"true\"/>\n\n<TextView\n    android:id=\"@+id/name\"\n    android:fontFamily=\"sans-serif\"\n    android:layout_toRightOf=\"@id/icon\"\n    android:layout_toEndOf=\"@id/icon\"\n    android:layout_alignRight=\"@id/badge\"\n    android:layout_alignEnd=\"@id/badge\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:textSize=\"@dimen/material_drawer_item_primary_text\"\n    android:gravity=\"center_vertical\"\n    android:textColor=\"@color/material_drawer_primary_text\"/>\n\n\n```\ni always set rightOf and endOf\n. yeah i know. but as mentioned above i already set the alignEnd params. \nCan you probably create a custom item (by copying the PrimaryItem) and change the layout to work in a RTL device. can't test on my side\n. @yoavst the easiest solution is to extend the PrimaryDrawerItem and override the convertView method. else just copy the whole class.\nif you come up with a layout which supports both let me know. thanks.\n. @yoavst i've made some changes to the source. can you try it?\n. @Fshamri you can create your own custom DrawerItem implementation if you need this only for rtl. Else you can also create custom layouts which will be used for RTL. See StackOverflow for specific information about the RTL support in android\n. @yoavst thanks.\nhave you tried to add those layouts in the layout-ldrtl folder? so both variants should work? If this works i can add the rtl layouts to the project too\n. @yoavst ah i see :D. \n. It will be in the final documentation. And the call to disable the selection will be in v1.0.0\nit's really easy. just do the following:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/9f7095b06ceaddd5090171b5cc3f06b0c22110df\n. @spongebobrf nice feature. I think it makes sense to add a Tagable interface like the other interfaces used for the items right now ;) \nI will take a detailed look at it later today.\nThank you so much!\n. @spongebobrf merged. will add the interface now ;)\nthanks for your help\n. @gaara87 thanks.\nYeah i accept pull request ;). I'm always open for external input and improvements.\nI've thought about this feature already, and i think it would make most sense to create a separate Header class (probably also with a builder) which will handle all the profile switching etc, and can then be passed to the drawer. \n. @gaara87 yeah i haven't started yet. just made a few notes yesterday after searching for all details. I've found that it seems no lib solves it like it's done within Google Play or Google Plus yet. I would try to implement such a behavior including changing the list if you click the select-box.\n;)\n. @appmath, @gaara87  so i have the basic layout. and a basic builde. now i just need to implement the special drawerItems for the accounts and the functionality\nPlease see this branch: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/accountswitcher for the current implementation\n\n. @appmath, @gaara87  so i have the basic layout. and a basic builde. now i just need to implement the special drawerItems for the accounts and the functionality\nPlease see this branch: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/accountswitcher for the current implementation\n\n. @appmath, @gaara87 some more updates to this branch and the source. basic switching with the images is possible now. next is the list for all profiles.\n. @appmath, @gaara87 some more updates to this branch and the source. basic switching with the images is possible now. next is the list for all profiles.\n.

I'm not quite sure about the real issue here? The header itself is not clickable only the images and the selection.\n@gaara87 thanks\n. @tarikyurtlu you want to show the profile images as normal but without the possibility to switch profiles with this function. the selection should also be disabled. i see. \nyeah i think with the next things i've planned this will also be possible :D \n. @khammami thanks ;)\n- you mean a compact header? or what do you mean?\n  - this one is planned :D\n  - EDIT: ok you did not mean a compact header, if there were no profiles the selection was at the bottom. this one is fixed now too\n- method added in next preview\n- elevation functionality added to circularImageView is in for Lollipop devices\n- will start to write changelogs starting with the final release of this version ;)\n. @appmath @gaara87 @jiechu @sohayb @fdorssers @khammami, @tarikyurtlu \nand another PREVIEW version. thank you all for helping and for testing. \nfixed a few issues and added new stuff.\n(just as a reminder :D) you can get it by following the above description: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/36#issuecomment-76599969\nbut using the following as dependency\njavascript\ncompile('com.mikepenz.materialdrawer:library:1.5.0.PREVIEW.3-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n        transitive = true\n}\nA small changelog within this (rather dirty) commit :D\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/c49b823a0c12757471e297a99530cf1b0e78517d\n- Open Issues\n  - if i click really fast on the items the list stays blank.

Beside this i added the method descriptions to the wiki, and made a few more tiny fixes. \nI hope you like it ;)\nIf there are any features left or something missing, please create a new issue.\n. @blennerSilva you can set an url, drawable, bitmap as profile pic. so if you get the image as bitmap or drawable from the gallery you can set this. i assume you will have to load the image in an asyncTask and as soon as you got it you can set it\n. @blennerSilva sorry i can't give support for versions different than the most current one.\n. @easycheese those items extend an interface called Nameable\nSo just check if the drawerItem is `instanceOf Nameable``\njava\nif (drawerItem instanceof Nameable) {\n   Toast.makeText(SimpleDrawerActivity.this, SimpleDrawerActivity.this.getString(((Nameable) drawerItem).getNameRes()), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n}\n. @chenleicpp that's true the header-element is clickable. \nin fact the onClick method can be fired without a DrawerItem, this has many different reasons.\nIt's always safer to check the drawerItem to be not null. \nProbably it would make sense to add a additional callback for onClick calls without a drawerItem? \n. @chenleicpp yeah i just took a look at the sample code. You are right i missed it there. Will update the sample with a fix for this. \nPreventing the click on a header isn't in, but definitely a good idea. Will add it to one of the next versions\n. It's really easy:\njava\nDrawer.Result result = new Drawer().withActivity(this).build();\n//now you can use the result and do some stuff with it\nresult.addItem(..);\nresult.removeItem(..);\n. It is ;) and it should be :D\njava\nDrawer.Result result = new Drawer().withActivity(this).build();\nis just the most simple configuration for the drawer. see the README.md for advanced usage :)\n. @appmath seems it must have to do something with the theme.

Do you have an RTL language?\n. @seba123neo can you retry with a clean install on your s3? do you have a custom rom or something? \nreally strange that it works on all devices but yours\n. @seba123neo no you don't have to download the icons. those are included within the library itself. \nhave you added the library with the transient statement?\n. Ok was able to reproduce it. Will be fixed in the next public version. I hope i can release it today or tomorrow. \n. @wildfatduck @khammami this one is fixed in the newest PREVIEW version. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/36#issuecomment-77248361\nif there are no new issues i'll probably release it to the public tomorrow.\n. @fdorssers thanks a lot. and thank you for the detailed description. you are right this is the cause of this issue. \nsometimes the issues are really \"easy\" :D \nThanks again!\n. @Rainer-Lang thanks for the report but this should be handled by the dev itself.\nHere i have a detailed answer for this decision:\nIf you want the back arrow you just have to set the following in your application\njava\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);\nThis will work for an ActionBar or Toolbar. \nSo now there is one thing. This won't show the back arrow if we use an ActionBarDrawerToggle because this overwrites this behavior. So we have to disable this for our drawer by setting the following\njava\n.withActionBarDrawerToggle(false)\nFor the functionality to go back you need the default implementation like this:\n``` java\n@Override\n    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {\n        switch (item.getItemId()) {\n            case android.R.id.home:\n                onBackPressed();\n                return true;\n        default:\n            return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nDeciding if i want the ActionBarDrawerToggle or the BackArrow? \nYeah it is a really simple decision because the Material Design Guidelines (or some other google android guidelines :D) state that a Drawer is just for the Main (the first) activity within your application. \nSo one more thing. The Drawer itself overlaps the toolbar so it will also overlap the ActionBarDrawerToggle so it won't show the arrow. So why do we have the ActionBarDrawerToggle in this case. Because it's easier for me to implement the callbacks for the Hamburger click. And for the really rare usecase that someone does not have a fullscreen (full-height) drawer which will show the ActionBarDrawerToggle (and if this dev also enables the animation)\n. @FabianTerhorst if you keep the default behavior you can change between arrow and normal hamburger icon with https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java#L174\n. @FabianTerhorst cool :D thanks\n. @FabianTerhorst to be fair i really don't know. i keep default behavior in my apps as far as possible. \n. @gpulido thanks for the information. will take a closer look at this later today. \n. @alex-soft-r you need an identifier equal to 0?\nPlease be so kind and add the line or .java class for this one\n. @alex-soft-r can you please be a bit more specific what this one should do?\n. @alex-soft-r thanks for help. i've added a note about this to the README.md\n. @fdorssers will be released with the next version\n. @lukaville you run the sample program without any modifications?\nIf you made modifications to the style read this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#important which refers to this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/#style-the-drawer\n. @lukaville you run the sample program without any modifications?\nIf you made modifications to the style read this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#important which refers to this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/#style-the-drawer\n.

That is why I thought about the possibility of \"check if the\" drawertoggle is enabled.\"\nas a fact. if you implement the drawer as it's meant in the Material Design Guidelines it will never show the back arrow. There's only the burger which shows or hides the drawer. That's it. I think this behavior is in and working. \nIn your case it's a special case and a very complex case. I hope you are still able to get it working for you.\n. @gpulido yeah if you refer to this behavior you are right. sorry that i forgot this point. \nI probably have to set up a sample activity to see how you have to use the toolbar / drawer to get it working the way it is done within gmail. \nI spent about 2 hours on the problem getting the ActionBarDrawerToggle and/or NavigationListener and/or Hamburger icon working. i have not found a real guide what's the perfect case for the whole thing, especially because a different dev had a problem if i set the listener to the drawer by default. \n. @gpulido sounds interesting :)\n. @gpulido oh i see. \nBut then i would prefer to give you a boolean within the listener method which states if it's enabled or not. so your case will work. and users also get a callback each time. \nSomehow i'm currently not sure if i should remove all of the ActionBarDrawerToggle & NavigationListener code out of the MaterialDrawer. Sometimes it's really difficult. Not sure. \nDo you feel the current implementation of the listener and ActionBarDrawerToggle helps you?\n. @gpulido with the latest release of the appcompat library you have to set the mToolbar for the ActionBarDrawerToggle else the Toggle won't show up. \nSo we have to set the NavigationListener on the ActionBarDrawerToggle (i think there's a method allowing this)\n. @gpulido i read the official documentation, this does not state the issue. \nI'm in a developer group (which is not public) where they discussed this issue and the only solution was to set the toolbar with the ActionBarDrawerToggle. \n\"figured it out. We were calling setSupportActionBar and passing in an instance of ToolBar in the activity. A few lines later we create an instance of ActionBarDrawerToggle which we weren't passing the instance of the ToolBar to. It seems that ActionBarDrawerToggle no longer automatically picks up on the ToolBar and you have to pass it in now.\" \nYou can test it if you check out the project and try running it without the toolbar set to ActionBarDrawerToggle\n. @gpulido tried it on my Nexus 5 with Android 5.1 Ill try it again this evening. seems strange that it is working on your phone. :D\nSorry for recreating this issue. Will have a detailed look later today.\n. @gpulido i'm glad that adding the listener to the ActionBarDrawerToggle worked :)\nThanks for the note about showing the BackArrow or HamurgerIcon. Will add this to the REAME.md\nYou are welcome. Thanks for your time and help :).\n. @gpulido ~~ok i tried it but it seems i'm not able to get it working with this code snippet.-\nCan you create a gist with a bit more code so i can check what's different?~~\nEDIT: nevermind. Fixed it ;). This is now in the README.md and as sample, including how to use the navigationListener, in the ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java\nThanks again for your help. \n.

You can't get the identifier of a string value you set :D. \neither you set the values as String \"sometext\", or as resource R.string.somtext.\nIf you want to get the identifier that's something different. The Items allow you to set an identifier with withIdentifier() and you can get this one again with getIdentifier()\n. @korrio do you talk about the AccountHeader? If yes have you implemented it yet?

I'll see how i can improve this with the style. \n. @abuzuhri .withTranslucentStatusBar(true) will only work if you use it in addition of a theme supporting a translucent statusbar. \n. @abuzuhri can't really reproduce it on any of my phones (Nexus 7, Nexus 5, Nexus 6). So it seems it is a samsung bug. \nYou should be able to change this by doing the following:\nxml\n<RelativeLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/toolbar_container\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:background=\"?attr/colorPrimaryDark\"\n        android:paddingTop=\"@dimen/tool_bar_top_padding\">\n        <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n            android:id=\"@+id/toolbar\"\n            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n            android:layout_height=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n            android:background=\"?attr/colorPrimary\"\n            android:elevation=\"4dp\"\n            android:transitionName=\"actionBar\"/>\n    </RelativeLayout>\nSee the colorPrimaryDark as background of the RelativeLayout\n. @patelakshay13890 running the application without any modifications?\n. @patelakshay13890 you've checked out the latest source, running it without modifications on which phone? \nI just did a clean checkout of the master (just in case i had any local differences) and started it within an emulator. no issues here. \n. @patelakshay13890  Have tried it on some additional pc's everywhere working. I have no clue why it shouldn't work for you. \nPlease try to check everything out again, and try to run it without any modifications.\n. I used the template by sebastian carawe. You can find more about it here: http://www.sebastiancarewe.com/#mystuff\n. @RustamG thank you so much for the pull request, but sorry there is already a DividerDrawerItem i've added it to the sample so it does not get missed ;). \n@fdorssers thanks for helping ;)\n. @gpulido thank you so much. had to change it a bit because this code could potentially allow a nullpointer exception\n. @crysan \nIf you create the Drawerwith the .build() method it will return a Drawer.Result object. This object contains helper methods to update the badge for a specific item (identified by it's identifier) \n. @crysan do you need a listener to get notified as soon as the drawer gets opened?\nLook here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java#L51\nIf you want to trigger the opening of the drawer just do this:\nDrawer.Result result = ...build()\nresult.openDrawer()\n. Fixed in v2.0.6\nSee following line:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L103\nyou have to enable this behavior. I hope you like it.\n. @y2kshane oh i think i found the issue already. Was a mistake on my side. just implemented this for the case the user sets the drawable as drawable, and not from resource. \nSorry for this. will be in the next version. \n. For normal icons you have to enable it with this method . withTintSelectedIcon(true)\n. @drinfernoo @marc-84 seems strange. i just tried it again within the sample application if i do following:\njava\nnew SecondaryDrawerItem().withName(R.string.drawer_item_contact).withSelectedIconColor(Color.RED).withTintSelectedIcon(true).withIcon(new IconicsDrawable(this, GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_add).actionBarSize().paddingDp(5).colorRes(R.color.material_drawer_dark_primary_text)).withTag(\"Bullhorn\")\nthe \"plus\" sign is red if the item is the current selected item.\n. @drinfernoo in the above case i create a drawable with it so it should make no difference. But yeah have not tried a different created drawable.\n. @drinfernoo ok just tried it with a different drawable. it get's colored. the drawable should be white i think. \n. @drinfernoo those are the GoogleMaterialDesign icons. these are also included with the Android-Iconics project :D See the sample with GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_add so you can use them too :D\nBut i've tried a icon before and it is colored. but it had white parts so i don't think it can color icons in other colors.\n. @swolford some hours later i have still no real answer to fix your issue. \nAs far as i've found this is a real issue but it is working as intended: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5497\nSo either you use no translucent statusbar. or you try to get the functionality working with adjustPan or with an alternative layout or something like this.\n. Here's a description how you can test the latest v2.5.0 with the ScrimInsetsLayout. Perhaps you are able to find a configuration which will work. :/\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/103#issuecomment-79558279\n. @swolford no problem. it's a problem and somehow we should be able to solve it :D.\nProbably let the drawer manage the keyboard behavior too, and disabling enabling fullscreen would work. hmmmm. it is at least an idea. \nGoogle Keep. Hmmm i think decompiling won't help with googles apps :D\nthanks you so much\n. @swolford within google keep (notes) i found out an interesting behavior. If you have a long input and open the keyboard the view will add the space at the bottom to the view. so this area stays scrollable after the keyboard was closed. (if you scroll up it won't be scrollable anymore) \nso it seems they react on the keyboard open and add a spacing at the bottom of the list.\n. @swolford you won't believe it but i found a hack which fixes this issue. I'll update the sample from the MaterialDrawer later ;)\n. @swolford source is up and you can check it here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleFragmentDrawerActivity.java\nSo as a detailed description what it does, or how i came to this solution. I tried a lot of different things, disabling the fullscreen or changing ui flags if the drawer is not shown or many additional things, but nothing changed. just a few things made the ui look ugly. so i checked some google apps as you did, and as i wrote above i checked the google keep app. \nEverytime the keyboard showed up it changed the height of the containing view (adding enough padding/margin at the bottom) so i checked how i can do the same for our app. \nI wrote a listener which reacts on the layout height change and calculates if it could be a keyboard. at the moment it reacts starting with 100dp (SwiftKey with the smallest setting takes 240dp) i then use the difference to the main height change and add the padding to the containing view. not to the root of the application but to the container for the fragments. So here's the code which does the magic:\nWhole source can be found here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/aa9136fb4f5b3a80460fe5f47213985026d20c88/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/util/KeyboardUtil.java\n``` java\nprivate View decorView;\n    private View contentView;\npublic KeyboardUtil(Activity act, View contentView) {\n    this.decorView = act.getWindow().getDecorView();\n    this.contentView = contentView;\n\n    //only required on newer android versions. it was working on API level 19\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 19) {\n        decorView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(onGlobalLayoutListener);\n    }\n}\n\npublic void enable() {\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 19) {\n        decorView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(onGlobalLayoutListener);\n    }\n}\n\npublic void disable() {\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 19) {\n        decorView.getViewTreeObserver().removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(onGlobalLayoutListener);\n    }\n}\n\n\n//a small helper to allow showing the editText focus\nViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener onGlobalLayoutListener = new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onGlobalLayout() {\n        Rect r = new Rect();\n        //r will be populated with the coordinates of your view that area still visible.\n        decorView.getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(r);\n\n        //get screen height and calculate the difference with the useable area from the r\n        int height = decorView.getContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics().heightPixels;\n        int diff = height - r.bottom;\n\n        //if it could be a keyboard add the padding to the view\n        if (diff != 0) {\n            // if the use-able screen height differs from the total screen height we assume that it shows a keyboard now\n            //check if the padding is 0 (if yes set the padding for the keyboard)\n            if (contentView.getPaddingBottom() != diff) {\n                //set the padding of the contentView for the keyboard\n                contentView.setPadding(0, 0, 0, diff);\n            }\n        } else {\n            //check if the padding is != 0 (if yes reset the padding)\n            if (contentView.getPaddingBottom() != 0) {\n                //reset the padding of the contentView\n                contentView.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n```\nIt took a lot of time to hint everything down and get something working. but yeah i like it ;)\n. @swolford sounds good :) let me know. For api level 10 i've disabled this within the util because there the adjustResize is still working normal :D\n. @swolford Oh you have used the SNAPSHOT for 2.5.0 already so it's in your cache sorry. I'll just push a new snapshot with v2.5.0-1-SNAPSHOT to the repo.\nI will release this version tomorrow. first i want to make sure the thing i've changed work the way everyone expects them.\n. @swolford the new SNAPSHOT is up. \njavascript\ncompile('com.mikepenz.materialdrawer:library:2.5.0-1-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n        transitive = true\n    }\n. So i will need to change this in the util :D\nWhich api version is your \"Optimus Showtime\"?\nEDIT: ah sorry just saw you wrote it on the top :D API 15\n. No no no. It has probably nothing to do with the resolution. \nIf you check the source. i already disable it vor API 10 because i found that adjustResize is still working at this api level. perhaps it's the same for API 15. The emulator of API16 does not show a keyboard ^^\n. Why not just manage it via the Identifier and update the list in the onProfileChanged listener?\n. @Grozny then i would recommend just keep track inside your activity with it. shouldn't be so much extra work\n. @Grozny can you please post a screenshot?\n. @Grozny thanks. this is perhaps fixed in the next version. not sure yet can't test it :/\n. @Grozny isn't it working with v2.5.0? I extended the space and it was even working with large font on my phone?\n. @Grozny oh sorry you mean the DrawerItem. Have you set a badge or an icon or anything special? What is the android version of your nexus 9?\n. I've changed it to match_parent did not realize i had a wrap_content there. We'll see if it is fixed in the next release ;)\n. @tilal6991 thanks for the pull request.

But still including additional dependencies is a really bad idea.\n. @dsdebastiani loading and setting the profile pictures is already possible with the current implementation. \nYou just create the profiles. Create the drawer and it's accountHeader. Then show the ui. in the background the profile images are loaded and as soon as you get them you just update the profile. There's a method for updating a profile identified by its identifier. It's that simple. \nIf we are able to find an implementation which wouldn't require the lib included within the MaterialDrawer perhaps with a callback or something so it can be used with any image loading library this would be far better. \n. @drinfernoo you can use the v2.5.0-SNAPSHOT version which will be out (hopefully) on sunday.

You use a toolbar with your activity? If yes do you pass it to the Drawer?\n. @easycheese thanks :)\n. @egisxxx seems to be an issue with API Level 10 (the default list-item selector must overlap the item. strange) this can't be changed by code. Only if you would create your custom drawerItem implementation. Will have to take a closer look at it :/\nAPI level 10 was not yet able to show the selected state. this is an issue i know, but i have not found a solution for this issue. I have the feeling this won't come to the MaterialDrawer because this would require a lot of additional stuff just to get it working with API Level 10\n. if you find an easy solution for the second issue let me know or create a pull request. thanks.\n. @egisxxx i just found out a easy solution how you can change the listitem selector. just get the ListView from the Drawer.Result and overwrite the selector there.\nAlso i've fixed the overlapping on click feedback with the next version\n. @danielgomezrico seems to be a Android bug in the main android source code:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=58183\nNo logs which are triggered on my side. Do you have any lag or something?\n. @danielgomezrico which version are you using. This was fixed in v2.5.0\n(@Rainer-Lang 7 seconds difference :D)\n. The latest SNAPSHOT of the v4.0.0 of the MaterialDrawer which can be found here (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/feature/refactoring) contains a proof of concept of such an element. \nYou can try it inside the sample app in the EmbeddedDrawerActivity (Embedded Drawer 2-pane)\nSample app:\nhttp://weew.ee/QeA9q\n. For more infos to the pre release see here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/487\n. can be tested in the latest beta of v4.0.0 #487\n. can be tested in the latest beta of v4.0.0 #487\n. @Spiderbezno the .withHeader does not take a drawable. It only takes a layout which can contain a drawable. \nAs alternative you can create an empty AccountHeader with only an image without any profiles. This will also do the job.\n. @ivangag you can create any drawerItems you want :) The interface of the MaterialDrawer will allow you to create any list item you need or you prefer. \nSo if you use the layout of the ProfileDrawerItem you will be able to create a PrimaryDrawerItemWithDescription ;). (I think the ProfileDrawerItem is only different to the normal items because it has a different height)\nJust take a look at any of the pre-defined items. If you need help let me know.\n. @ivangag the new item is called PrimaryDescriptionDrawerItem ;)\n. @ivangag yeah it's in the newest version ;) v2.5.4\n. The font has a different type in the second line. \nSo does it work with the above line?\n. @alorma @wildfatduck yeah you can set the selection at the init with -1. This will deselect all items.\n. @wildfatduck ok will take a look. sorry that this causes a fc\n. @wildfatduck ok just saw you use the method setSelecitonByIdentifier. Try using the method \n.withSelectedItem(-1) on the builder.\n. @wildfatduck no problem ;)\n. I think yes. Setting something with -1 to disable it is a common pattern. So i would also give you the advice to do following: .withSelectedItem(-1)\n. @alorma yes will add it to the README. So many functions :D Still a few are missing within the sample or the README but i try to improve it all the time. \nThank you.\n. @Grozny in gmail the active profile is not listed right. I think it makes more sense if the active profile is visible but selected. But should not be to much work to get both working.\n. @Grozny oh sorry. It worked on my phone. Will check it again. \n. Haha that was a stupid one. Tested it on my device was working. after that i built the if to do it :D Bad that i mixed up a continue with a return :D\nFixed in v2.5.5\n. @TurKurT656 right now the default set color is wrong that's true. you can overwrite it via code already :)\nSo 54% black would be: #8A000000\nThis post contains all ARGB values \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/25170174/325479\n. @TurKurT656 do you talk about the SectionDrawerItem or all DrawerItems?\n. Oh i see :D. Just checked will take a while to add the methods but yeah will be in one of the next versions ;)\n. @alex-soft-r with the setting setNameShown() you can hide the name of those items and then the e-mail will be centered. Can't try it right now if i'm correct but yeah. only adding center_vertical won't change how the items are displayed because with empty text the textView itself is still displayed just without content.\n. @alex-soft-r oh i see your point. totally missed this with yesterdays update. sorry. will be fixed in v2.5.5\n. @seba123neo @simonckenyon thank you so much for the nice words :) something special to just hear someone say thanks ;). \nBut now i have an issue :D how can i fix this? ...\nJust kidding ;). Thanks.\n. @Rainer-Lang @khammami thanks for helping ;)\n@TurKurT656 i think you search for a default option to get such pinned drawer items at the bottom. at the moment you can do this be creating your layout as sticky footer. for the future i will see if there's an easier method how to provide this.\n. Just take a look at any of the provided drawerItems they all implement the same IDrawerItem interface\n. @mseroczynski this is a duplicate :D i close this one. further discussion in the ticket #133\n. @createS0ftware thanks ;)\nWhat was your issue?\n. @AngleV can you please also provide the exception?\n. @AngleV is your headerResult null? \n. :D @AngleV I think you just miss to set it to your headerResult variable or so :D\n. @TurKurT656 i see #132 fixed already ;)\nabou the drawer items. i've set this in the layouts to support rtl. but it seems as the current one causes some issues. i will remove it from the layouts. so the text will show on the left. for proper rtl layouts you have to provide a own RTL layout within the rtl layout folder. i would love to add working rtl layouts but i have no phone and nothing to test :(\nnot sure if it is enough if someone provides an RTL strings.xml?\n. @TurKurT656 is it working as expected in v2.5.6?\n. Can you help testing with rtl? how should it look like? text on the left side?\n. @TurKurT656 i think the rtl display of the text is happening because the text is rtl. \nPerhaps you try to add this layout to your app:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml\nand change the gravity from start to left android:gravity=\"center_vertical|start\"\n. @TurKurT656 i think the rtl display of the text is happening because the text is rtl. \nPerhaps you try to add this layout to your app:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml\nand change the gravity from start to left android:gravity=\"center_vertical|start\"\n. @TurKurT656 ok i will change this. so the layouts we have are ltr only. \nfor rtl we have to define separat layouts. will look at it for the future ;)\n. @TurKurT656 ok i will change this. so the layouts we have are ltr only. \nfor rtl we have to define separat layouts. will look at it for the future ;)\n. @talklittle thans\n. @crysan remember your DrawerItem and call following method:\njava\nPrimaryDrawerItem item = new PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(R.string.drawer_autors_name).withIcon(FontAwesome.Icon.faw_home).withBadge(String.valueOf(db_count_all_author)).withIdentifier(10);\n....\nitem.setBadge(newbadge);\n....\nresult.updateItem();\n. @appmath i see the the confusion here. but it's correct :D\nthe thing is the position returned by the onItemClick method and other methods is the position in the list. the list's position includes the header. this means with header the index is higher. a better solution for the whole thing is to add methods like updateBadge(String badge, int identifier) :D\nI'm not sure if i should ignore and exclude the header everywhere?\n. @TurKurT656 see the answer of @raghunandankavi2010 \nabout the .withIcon without calling getResources. i think this is not necessary. in 95% of all usecases you would load the profile header images by code so you don't have them as resource\n. @Rainer-Lang i'm afraid this is not as easy at it seems. Not sure if i like the idea of adding an ExpandableListView here.\n. @jasonborja you can still implement the logic that if you click on a DrawerItem it adds new items to the list, and you remove them on a second click. This will work. \n. @Rainer-Lang the RecyclerView allows to interact as any RecyclerView you used. You can provide and define everything you need. The BaseAdapter also uses the correct notify methods\n. @kaushald it seems that there's still a misconfiguration with the new library. Can't tell what should be wrong. updated wall:splash internally and it's working. \nHave you tried running it without the test? Got it working already?\n. @kaushald i assume that it has some issues with the styles or something like this. if you can debug into it and let me know where it fails it will help :)\n. Yeah. As i said perhaps we can hunt it down with a more detailed error description\n. @kaushald doesn't seem that i'm not able to get the same exception as you. But reading the log output. Can you please try to remove the .withToolbar() of your drawer for the test. The above exception fails with the .syncState method of the ActionBarDrawertoggle\n. @kaushald @wKovacs64 i really assume that it has to be a combination of the new support library and the not yet really supporting espresso for it. Or something like that. \n@wKovacs64 you found the problem? Sounds bad :/\n. @kaushald @wKovacs64 i really assume that it has to be a combination of the new support library and the not yet really supporting espresso for it.

If you really want to have different font sizes. you can either overwrite the dimensions within your dimens.xml (you can find all set dimensions here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/library/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml)\nor you create your own DrawerItem implementation.\n. @sonovice you don't use a toolbar right? there is no option to draw the drawer on top of a normal old school ActionBar. please use .withActionBarCompatiblity (or something like this :D)\n. @sonovice you don't use a toolbar right? there is no option to draw the drawer on top of a normal old school ActionBar. please use .withActionBarCompatiblity (or something like this :D)\n. @sonovice using the Toolbar is no workaround :P it should be used :D\nNever have seen those Oo any custom styles or any custom layouts? \nWhat phone are you using?\n. @sonovice using the Toolbar is no workaround :P it should be used :D\nNever have seen those Oo any custom styles or any custom layouts? \nWhat phone are you using?\n.

(or they search for 4+ hours) \ni was afraid adding it as default because i did not know if it will cause any troubles. but for now it seems really stable.\nso adding it with the mentioned methods makes sense ;). i will add them in the next version. \ni see something like.\njava\nDrawer.Result result = ...\nresult.enableKeyboardSupport(activity)\nresult.disableKeyboardSupport(activity)\n. @raguirre with the next version there will be a method called\njava\nresult.keyboardSupportEnabled(activity, true);\nyou can disable it again with this:\njava\nresult.keyboardSupportEnabled(activity, false);\n. @raguirre with the next version there will be a method called\njava\nresult.keyboardSupportEnabled(activity, true);\nyou can disable it again with this:\njava\nresult.keyboardSupportEnabled(activity, false);\n. @mehdinewdesign there is the sample app available showing how the lib is used, you also can see how the MaterialDrawer needs to be setup in the README. \nNo step by step guidance possible. \n. @mehdinewdesign not sure why you ask this inside an issue which has nothing to do with your question. Here you can find the sample app: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app including a sample for MiniDrawer\n. @TaherZaki please see the readme or the sample application. You have to use one of the provided themes and override those colors. or you just set those colors with the same name inside your colors.xml. both things are shown in the README. thanks\n. @TaherZaki can you be a bit more specific. this is shown in the sample app\n. @TaherZaki @ishell you can navigate through your activities as you need it :)\nYou have many options. decide which item was clicked by identifier, by it's position...\nHow it's done with identifiers is shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L125\nPlease look at the sample code. as addition this sample activity also deactivates the selected state for the items which start an activity.\n. @Imangazaliev the ripple effect is only enabled vor devices starting with api level 21. it is enabled by default. the ripple effect won't be included on earlier android devices. google hasn't included it in the support library.\nchanging the background is really easy. you can overwrite the color via the color.xml or via a theme overriding one of my themes. or you use one of the methods provided by the Drawer... withSliderBackgroundColor\n. @Reza-Rg as mentioned above there won't be any 3rd party lib mimicking the ripple effect. Google has specified in the guidelines that there should not be a ripple effect on pre 21 api level devices. It also has not included it into the support library because it's performance is not good enough.\nIf you really need it. Just implement your custom DrawerItem. \n. @Reza-Rg as mentioned above there won't be any 3rd party lib mimicking the ripple effect.

You have missed the implementation how images are loaded. This has to be provided because the MaterialDrawer does not include a image loader library. \nI will add a new section to the readme about this. \n. @PutraJuke you don't have to call init the DrawerImageLoader is just required that the MaterialDrawer has the logic in place how images are loaded. Everything is then handled behind the curtains. You just have to provide the logic, (and a library like picasso or glide) after this you just have to set a url for a profile ( not available on DrawerItems )  and it will load the image\n. @PutraJuke you don't have to call init the DrawerImageLoader is just required that the MaterialDrawer has the logic in place how images are loaded.

That's what is also done in the sample app:\nIn my CustomApplication I define my DrawerImageLoader and define that I want to use Glide\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L42\n(In case you have not used your own Application class: https://www.mobomo.com/2011/5/how-to-use-application-object-of-android/)\nAnd then I just provide the url for the image.

You can implement as many as you need. And they can do whatever you need. Just take a look at any of the provided DrawerItems ;). It's really easy to add your own.\n. @Remie-l you just need to implement it\ncreate a new class implementing the IDrawerItem interface and you can simply user it as any other drawer item. See at any of the already available drawerItems \n. @Remie-l you just need to implement it\ncreate a new class implementing the IDrawerItem interface and you can simply user it as any other drawer item. See at any of the already available drawerItems \n. @Kadrei you can use the buildView method which will only build the view. you can then use it with result.getSlider()\nYou can see how it's done here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/EmbeddedDrawerActivity.java\nthis is an embedded version of the drawer. but youc an also use it to inflate the contents to a normal DrawerLayout ;)\n. @Kadrei the sample now includes an activity showing how this can be done ;)\n. @Kadrei thanks\n. What'S the parent of the theme you use?\nDo you set the theme before initializing the drawer?\n. you can choose between the compact header and the normal header.\nThe compact header will only show the profile image of the active profile and the selection box with name and e-mail. \nthere are no other implementations. The normal header is designed as described in the Material Design Guidelines so this one should be used.\n. @sonovice i think you mix up different tags. :D\nas seen in the onCheckedChanged method you get the Tag of the View. The view of the CompoundButton does not contain the tag. \nYou set the tag on the DrawerItem which is not returned by the onCheckedChanged listener. \nYou should set the listener for the specific ToggleDrawerItem. I will see if i can improve this implementation. \n. @Remie-l the Primary Item has a different height and the icon is smaller. \nYou can see it. just see the sample application.\nabout the color. you are right. the current version has a small bug. will be fixed in the next version\n. @NamingException yeah this is a known behavior of this FLAG. So i've implemented a util which will enable support for keyboards and this behavior. It lowers the layout size and adds enough padding to the bottom. \nYou can enable this by calling .keyboardSupportEnabled(activity, enabled) on the Drawer.Result.\nThe sample application also contains a sample with this in use\n. @GreenSkinMonster to get it working i've created the keyboardSupport function. It is in the sample app. The thing is that in fact this is no issue of the MaterialDrawer. It's Android functionality, and people don't know about this. There were other issues regarding this. If you have FullScreen the adjustResize won't work anymore. \nSo to \"fix\" it i will resize the layout. as far as i can, i can't fix the display. the blue is your background color so you can change this.\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/95, https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/183\n. added the info here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/README.md#i-have-problems-with-the-softkeyboard-how-can-i-fix-this\n. @GreenSkinMonster no problem. \nThanks ;)\n. @monakhv the checkable method is used to disable the checked state of the items. (if you click it and it's the current view)\nThis is used for items like in the SimpleHeaderDrawerActivity:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L101\nIf you require a logic that if one button disables the selection of the other you have to use the method. withChecked\n. @monakhv ok as far as i can tell the current SwitchDrawerItem or ToggleDrawerItem does not provide an api to disable the selection change of the toggle.\nSo i will have to add an api to deactivate the toggle button as it can be done with the real standalone controll\n. @cmonfortep if something not default is required i recommend to implement a custom DrawerItem or changing the values via the dimens.xml\n. @jayrambhia would be great. somehow there must be some strange combination which causes this issue\n. @jayrambhia still the case? i'll close this for now. please report back\n. @vuz the thing is this. the MaterialDrawer manages the shadow above the StatusBar. This is added by the MaterialDrawer. If you also want this shadow for your custom drawer content you also have to add this shadow on your own. \nAnd about opening and closing the second drawer. just remember the result of the second drawer and use the Drawer.Result result2 to open close the drawer ;)\n. @KlassenKonstantin great :)\n. @dimsuz yeah if it will be reused then it's bad :D\nStill you have the option to add the method and do a pull-request. remember old default functionality should not be altered\n. @DavyHubrecht the margin is exactly 8dp. should be the correct value as far as i can see in the Material Design Guidelines.\n. @dennes544 you create the drawer and will receive a Drawer.Result object. Then you can use this one for all fragments where you have to update stuff. \n. @dennes544 there are other ways how to interact with ui components from the activity to fragments. There are a lot of thread about this topic on stackoverflow. :) You should be able to get a good answer ;)\n. @dennes544 you don't want the switch functionality? Or what do you need?\nThere's a listener to listen for profile switches\n. Just add a withOnAccountHeaderListener this will also return a boolean defining if its the current profile\n. @i906 any custom dpi or something? it seems the statusBar height isn't the 25dp height as it's defined by android\n. @i906 yes. could be. \nat the moment the statusbar height is fetched through the dimens.xml. i'll try to find a programmatically approach for this\n. @DavyHubrecht thanks for the pull request and the detailed information. Yes you are right. It's not possible to remove that shadow from Pre Lollipop Devices. \nI think it will be better if we implement this configurable. So the developer can disable the shadow. \nAlso just changing the default values for api == 19.\nThe changes you added hard code this behavior. \nAbout the shadow i add on top. I would recommend that we don't add it instead of setting it's color to transparent. \nI will take a detailed look at it. later today. \n. @danhawkes in 99% of all cases you can use the root layout. Also the MaterialDrawer library depends on inflating and changing the users layout. this makes everything easier for most use cases. \nIf you can't use the default inflating. You can still use the .buildView method and let the drawer handle the view instead of the complete layout and style. You will then have to create the DrawerLayout on your own. \nEasiest solution for you. Create a really flat layout which you set. This won't add such an overhead for the system and you can still use the drawers default generation \n. @danhawkes in 99% of all cases you can use the root layout.

You try to set the selection to an element with an identifier -1. you can't have items with an identifier lower than 0. \nalso if you want to deselect you should not call setSelectionByIdentifier but setSelection instead.\n. @OlegWock i really recommend not using identifiers lower then 0. \nIn the listener it just gives you the value of the drawerItem no other methods are called\n. @ashraful29 because you do not have a drawerItem with identifier 1.\nNegative identifiers are not supported either. \n. @maxkrass do you use the PrimaryDrawerItem?\nThe ImageView of the PrimaryDrawerItem has a size of 24x24dp. Following the Android Guidelines the Images are 24dp in total but if you just create the images itself they are 22dp of the image + 1dp of padding. So probably the images have the wrong size?\nHere's the imageView:\n\n. @maxkrass so then this is the issue. The IconSize of the SeconaryDrawerItems is lower then the 24dp of the PrimaryDrawerItem\nNope :D You have to take a second look at the code above ;)\nit states RIGHT and END (This is the same :D just RTL stuff) (48-24 = 24)\nand TOP and Bottom  (48-12-12=24)\nSo the icon is 24x24dp\n. @maxkrass yeah is a bit of a uncommon definition and position. but it's the specification of the Google Material Design Guidelines\n. @wKovacs64 yes you are right. thanks for the pull request\n. @IlyaMyasoedov you can modify the width of the drawer already if this is the thing you want. \nif the fab is in front of the drawer. i assume it has an higher translationZ or elevation than the drawer. You can either add an higher elevation to the drawer or a lower one to the fab.\n. @IlyaMyasoedov is the fab above the drawer on lower api versions?\n. @IlyaMyasoedov so i asked if it's above the drawer on lower api versions too :D\ni know that elevation won't be used below 21. \ni just want to know how it displays the fab. to see how it's possible to overlap the drawer\n. @IlyaMyasoedov i'll report back as soon as i have any news. thanks\n. @IlyaMyasoedov ok the issue is quite easy to solve and quite easy to understand\nEach activity contains of an root layout identified by 'android.R.id.content' this will host the complete layout of your activity. So if you use my library i will take all layouts hosted within this content layout and will inflate it within a drawer. so i do the DrawerLayout by code for you and will manage everything. nothing to handle from your side. Now you come and add the FAB to your activity. \nThe fab also contains some similar code as the drawer. if you don't provide the layout which will host this fab it will inflate it within 'android.R.id.content' layout so it will be in a layout which is the parent of the drawer (because we added the drawer earlier). So there are two solutions. you can either inflate the FAB before the drawer. I don't recommend this because it will create another layer within your view hierarchy and this is not needed. \nThe cleanest solution is to add the view which will host the fab, and that's the content of the DrawerLayout. You can do this like this:\njava\n//look at the part with .in(...)\nmFloatingAction = FloatingAction.from(this)\n                .listenTo(mListView)\n                .in(drawerResult.getContent())\n                .colorResId(R.color.windowBackground)\n                .icon(R.drawable.plus)\n                .listener(this)\n                .build();\nAfter this the drawer will be above the fab. \nI also saw an additional issue. Your activity_main.xml contains a DrawerLayout which is really unnecessary. It won't be used it will just add another view which hosts the rest of the layout. I recommend to remove it, because the MaterialDrawer handles this for you ;) Keep it simple :D\nHere's the updated layout:\nxml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<RelativeLayout\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n    <include\n        android:id=\"@+id/relative_actionbar\"\n        layout=\"@layout/toolbar_default\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"/>\n    <FrameLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/container\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:clickable=\"true\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_below=\"@+id/relative_actionbar\">\n        <ru.logomotiv.android.whattobuy.floatingaction.ChattyListView\n            xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n            xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n            android:id=\"@android:id/list\"\n            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n            android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n            android:divider=\"@null\"\n            tools:context=\"ru.logomotiv.android.whattobuy.MainActivity\"\n            android:drawSelectorOnTop=\"true\"/>\n    </FrameLayout>\n</RelativeLayout>\nOh and one more thing. The drawer includes an util called 'KeyboardUtil'. Perhaps you like the method called .hideKeyboard(),\n. @yolapop has to be an issue on your side. please check for this error on stackOverFlow or somewhere, but it's working for everyone else here.\n. @yolapop have you found the issue?\n. @yolapop have you found the issue?\n. @danhawkes yeah that's true that it is a bit of a problem if you mix up both methods. a reset of the other value would be a good start. \nthe trouble continues with the getter methods in the callback. the getName will just return a value of the drawerItem if you set it via string, and the getNameRes if you set it via resource. This is the case because i don't have access to the context at the moment of setting those values. the strings are then fetched during the item creation.\n. @danhawkes yeah that's true that it is a bit of a problem if you mix up both methods. a reset of the other value would be a good start. \nthe trouble continues with the getter methods in the callback. the getName will just return a value of the drawerItem if you set it via string, and the getNameRes if you set it via resource.

I'll try something later today. probably i can improve the styles.\n. @raghunandankavi2010 i've made the step with android:... obsolete. should work now by simply overriting colorPrimary and those fields\n. @raghunandankavi2010 i've made the step with android:... obsolete. should work now by simply overriting colorPrimary and those fields\n.

Not sure if this can be controlled via the DrawerLayout or somewhere else. (if at all)\n. @MFlisar shouldn't be blocked all the things are managed by the system via the fitsSystemWindows flag, and the normal DrawerLayout\n. @Reza-Rg your issue is that you use an actionBar. An ActionBar does not allow the drawer to overlap it. You have to use the toolbar. \nAnd the dark shadow is created by the drawerLayout no way to just remove it from the top. you can generally deactivate it but that's it\nand no the screenshot of Google Play Music does NOT follow the Android Design Guidelines. Update to the latest version which now also has a fullscreen drawer\n. @ido567 the images are broken. can you please update them\n. @ido567 from the provided code i can't say that there's anything wrong. \ni only see that you have methods to create the drawer and the AccountHeader you can use the result objects to modify everything in it. recommend pattern is to just create the drawer once and reuse the result after this\n. @ido567 from the provided code i can't say that there's anything wrong. \ni only see that you have methods to create the drawer and the AccountHeader you can use the result objects to modify everything in it. recommend pattern is to just create the drawer once and reuse the result after this\n. please provide a real sample which i can run. the code you provided are just snippets\n. please provide a real sample which i can run. the code you provided are just snippets\n. @ido567 i can't see any issue with the layout or how you create the drawer.

Fixed with v2.9.5. See the upgrade notes\n. @andhie you are right:\njava\nint selectedIconColor = UIUtils.decideColor(ctx, getSelectedIconColor(), getSelectedColorRes(), R.attr.material_drawer_selected_text, R.color.material_drawer_selected_text);\nmissed the getSelectedColorRes() there. will fix it in the next release. hopefully out later today.\n. @simonckenyon wrong issue but i answer here :D\nin fact it makes sense that the color is different. if you just give me the icon i am able to handle the whole icon creation in the drawer. if you create a custom drawable i can't do this. \nhow different is the icon color? can you post screenshtos?\n. @MarkOSullivan94 yeah it's exactly the same, i just renamed the method as the new name makes more sense. I have not yet planned to remove the old variant so it should be fine ;)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDrawerItem.java#L187\n. @akshayt23 i will take a closer look at this. but there's a second issue open which probably should be referred to this one #234 .\noh and no you misread the library dependency :D you 'com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries:library:4.5.8@aar' is a different lib\n. oh about your toolbar:\njava\n    toolbar.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLACK);\n    toolbar.getBackground().setAlpha(90);\ni assume this overwrites the color\n. @akshayt23 yeah but why don't you remove the toolbar color overwrite? you make it grey with the those lines:\njava\ntoolbar.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLACK);\ntoolbar.getBackground().setAlpha(90);\n. if you use the toolbar see at the sample :D\njust a hint you set it to the arrow right now:\njava\n    //set the back arrow in the toolbar\n    getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);\n    getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(false);\n. @akshayt23 no problem man :D \n. @raghunandankavi2010 thanks.\n@KChernenko see @raghunandankavi2010 s comment. you have to style the overlay and set it for the toolbar. can't do this in the MaterialDrawer theme\n. @MassiveZergInc @jahirfiquitiva @raghunandankavi2010 i assume this is now a problem with all my libraries and i have to update them step by step. \nFor the moment i recommend to use the old support libraries til i've updated everything\n. @raghunandankavi2010 thanks\n. @MassiveZergInc @jahirfiquitiva @raghunandankavi2010\nI (think) found a temporary solution until i update the lib itself too. You can use the newest support libs if you exclude the old ones from the libs you use. Here's how i did it for wallsplash\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz.materialdrawer:library:2.7.9@aar') {\n        transitive = true\n        exclude group: 'com.android.support'\n}\ncompile('com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries:library:4.6.0@aar') {\n        transitive = true\n        exclude group: 'com.android.support'\n}\n. @raghunandankavi2010 i added the exclude of the support group to the libs and now it works. have you tried it?\n. @raghunandankavi2010 ah i see. this is an additional theme issue. i had an additional issue that it had conflicts with the old version and it locked up my app\n. @raghunandankavi2010 yeah saw it already. will do this, this week. i try to get it out today, but i will move to a new apartment so i'm really busy :D\nEDIT:\nat least i've updated the source, i hope i did not miss anything to get it working with the newest appcompat. Please check the commit: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/c30a9bb38155f0ac54fbcc5103795e231efd02f5 if it looks goot i'll prepare a new release\n. Fixed in v2.8.0\n. @raghunandankavi2010 great ;)\n. @mutindaz yes. \nbut why would you need this?\nit also has a downside -> the shadow which is created by the DrawerLayout is above the toolbar. \nonly solution would be to handle the DrawerLayout on your own and let the MaterialDrawer only generate the Drawer content\n. @mutindaz in the next update there will be a new method which will allow the correct behavior.\ni'm preparing something at the moment\n. @IgorGanapolsky solved? Please reopen if still not solved\n. yeah this will be fixed in the next version. it will also be required to set a theme for the toolbar then\n. @gpulido there will be an update with an updated theme soon. this will then require you to set the theme for the toolbar too (as advised from the android team)\n. @gpulido have you details about the changelog of 22.1.1 (not 22.1.0)\nthere will be an update soon :D. will be v2.9.0 because there will be a little bit work. (defining the toolbar style on yourown)\n. @gpulido awesome ;)\n. @IgorGanapolsky oh sorry. i found the issue :D you have the gradle dependency for the AboutLibraries library but not for the MaterialDrawer :D \n. @IgorGanapolsky depends. if you just want to use the MaterialDrawer you just need this one. if you also want the AboutLibraries library you need the second. not sure what's confusing here?\n. this can't be handled by the drawer. you have to handle it on your own. but the api should be flexible enough\n. what? perhaps screenshots?\n. should be somehow possible. the MaterialDrawer is a normal DrawerLayout so everything should be possible as with a normal DrawerLayout\n. @artemkutukov if it'S possible with a DrawerLayout it's also possible here. haven't had the need for this yet.\nnothing the lib can handle (i think) (or can be handled)\n. @artemkutukov no problem :) great that i was able to help you :)\noh and the next version will have the .DarkToolbar theme which will then require the android:theme on your toolbar + app:popupTheme ;) \nwill have to add this to the FAQ\n. @buraktamturk i think this should work for you:\nxml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n    <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n        android:id=\"@+id/my_awesome_toolbar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n        android:background=\"@color/green\"\n        app:theme=\"@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar\"\n        app:popupTheme=\"@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Light\"/>\nno the theme itself is correct. but yeah the new appcompat style is handled different and it seems it is not possible anymore to set the theme for the actionBar only like it was done before... :/\n. @buraktamturk no you change it to MaterialDrawerTheme.Light.TranslucentStatus and then you add the styles with app:theme=\"@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar\" to your toolbar\n. @buraktamturk that's ture ^^ :/ it's annoying :D \n. @buraktamturk haha yes. but i think i can create the theme to fix this. but devs will have to add the theme to their toolbar which is (or should be done) \nI just see those why is the text black questions :D\n. @buraktamturk no problem. great that i was able to help you. \n(i think github had just a big issue :D)\nthe next version will feature the .DarkToolbar theme fixed which will allow you to use it. but will require the android:theme and app:popupTheme. \nSo devs should follow the guidelines and should implement stuff as they were designed :D\n. @Shajeel-Afzal what theme? what version?\n. @Shajeel-Afzal you can set the theme for the text by code. it uses the correct color but your image is \"wrong\" for the theme. :D just use the api methods\n. yeah. is the best idea :) \nyou could also overwrite following in your theme: material_drawer_header_selection_text\nor the color with the same name material_drawer_header_selection_text\n(there can only be one default color :P and white is standard :D )\n. @Shajeel-Afzal for non MaterialDrawer activities you should use a theme which has no Translucent Statusbar\nThe theme is working as designed. it makes the statusbar translucent. if you don't handle this with a scrimInsetsLayout or anything it will move like this\n. @easycheese i use the normal toggleButton i think this one can't be colored. Just implement a Custom DrawerItem. It's really really easy\n. @nambv you want it to stay always on bottom?\nthen try to set it as stickyFooter\n. @Noezis I assume you haven't tried the sample application. There is only one activity which is the parent of all other activities, and this one (the first one) will show the hamburger icon. all other activities show the back arrow because they are second level\nEdit: this one is the first activity: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleHeaderDrawerActivity.java\n. use . withOnAccountHeaderListener()\n. @alorma there is a different method which makes a DrawerItem checkable. (the selectionstate) see the sample app this shows how it can be used. \nwithCheckable(false)\n. @alorma making it selected by default? so it's the first selected item?\nor you mean it should have the selected state? then set it checked ( or selected ) not sure at the moment\n. yeah but if the specific draweritem can't have a select state why don't you use .withChecked(false) ?\n. there are 2 different method\none that sets it selected and one that prevents it from being automatically checked after click\n. haha :D \ni was sure that it's just something strange :D \nthe thing is that i have no better method names for those functions :/\n. @localhostEU never tried it. but you should be able to easily check this with the sample project. will take about 5 mins\n. @localhostEU can you report back if you tried it? Perhaps adding it to the sample app?\n. @localhostEU awesome ;) thanks\n. @w821881341 this is not the complete exception. please post more details.\nalso this is not a MaterialDrawer specific issue ;D\n. @localhostEU you closed it?\n. @localhostEU oh i see :D new pull request. thanks.\n. @localhostEU oh i see :D new pull request. thanks.\n. @guilhermearaujo Calligraphy also has some more side effects. i think it will prevent you from using the Android-Iconics functionality. (haven't tested it yet but yeah i am afraid this can cause issues)\nabout the font not changed. so it will stay on the default android font? \n. @guilhermearaujo Calligraphy also has some more side effects. i think it will prevent you from using the Android-Iconics functionality.

And the third to be as flexible as possible to allow everything (or at least a lot of stuff :D)\nAbout the sticky thing :D everything built in ;) Just check out the ComplexHeaderActivity -> https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L115\nYou add the stickyFooterItems as normal drawerItems with an extra call and everything is working as the other stuff :D \njava\n.addStickyDrawerItems(\n                        new SecondaryDrawerItem().withName(R.string.drawer_item_settings).withIcon(FontAwesome.Icon.faw_cog).withIdentifier(10),\n                        new SecondaryDrawerItem().withName(R.string.drawer_item_open_source).withIcon(FontAwesome.Icon.faw_github)\n                )\nthe selected items will be kept in sync and the events are triggered as normal onDrawerItemClick events ;)\nIt works with all DrawerItems (default or custom ones) which impelement the IDrawerItem interface ;)\n. @kazisrabon as of now the ProfileDrawerItem just supports drawables. you will have to get a drawable from the bitmap. i think it makes sense to add this feature in a future release\n. @kazisrabon as of now the ProfileDrawerItem just supports drawables. you will have to get a drawable from the bitmap. i think it makes sense to add this feature in a future release\n. @T0h6BY not sure what you are doing but i assume that you have setted withCheckable(false) this will prevent the auto selection of this item\n. @T0h6BY not sure what you are doing but i assume that you have setted withCheckable(false) this will prevent the auto selection of this item\n. @raghunandankavi2010 i have changed something with the newest release. i hope this fixes your issue\n. @raghunandankavi2010 great ;)\n. @Java-Help first send me the link to the review ;)\n. @Java-Help first send me the link to the review ;)\n. @Java-Help very detailed ;). \n. @Java-Help added ;)\n. @Java-Help no problem ;). \n. @ianrumac i assume the issue happens because the header is inserted as headerView inside the List. as of the behavior of the list it will ignore the height of the root layout which is inflated so it will require the child of the root view you inflate to have a own height. \n(i'm not 100% sure but that's the behavior i have seen in the past)\n. @ianrumac i assume the issue happens because the header is inserted as headerView inside the List. as of the behavior of the list it will ignore the height of the root layout which is inflated so it will require the child of the root view you inflate to have a own height. \n(i'm not 100% sure but that's the behavior i have seen in the past)\n. @alorma you can. just get the imageView which contains the background and change it.\njava\n        headerResult.getHeaderBackgroundView()\n. @alorma you can. just get the imageView which contains the background and change it.\njava\n        headerResult.getHeaderBackgroundView()\n. @EpsilonOrionis please more details. which xml, which color value, which icons?\nicons as drawable or icons via the Android-Iconics library?\n. @EpsilonOrionis please more details. which xml, which color value, which icons?\nicons as drawable or icons via the Android-Iconics library?\n. @EpsilonOrionis i have changed the behavior of this in the newest release perhaps it's working now?\n. @RubyDerBoss please more details. i'm sure you have set a wrong height of the toolbar. (in fact this is no issue of the MaterialDrawer)\n. @RubyDerBoss please more details. i'm sure you have set a wrong height of the toolbar. (in fact this is no issue of the MaterialDrawer)\n. @RubyDerBoss yeah that's exactly the thing i thought will cause the issue. i had this in use in the past too, but the wrap_content seems to don't work properly here. \nif you do it like this:\njava\n<android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n        android:id=\"@+id/toolbar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n        android:background=\"?attr/colorPrimary\"\n        android:elevation=\"4dp\"/>\nit will work.

Perhaps you find hints how to create your layout with additional content in the google docs. \n. @Radzhab this question is nothing specific to the MaterialDrawer library. if you create a new activity with an intent it's a new activity and so it will have a new ui. it seems you are new to android development. please read some tutorials to get used to the basic stuff\n. the blue of the selector is system default\nthe blue of the text of an selected item is the apps primary color as defined in the Google Material design guidelines\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#custom-style---stylesxml\n. @Sinokos as mentioned this is default selector color. As far as i know this is system default. Correct me if i'm wrong.\nStarting with API Level 21 the selector uses the correct color but on pre 21 devices it won'T\n. @halipso you have closed it already but you are right this is an issue. it will be fixed in the next version. thanks\n. actionBar is nothing MaterialDrawer specific. \nthe MaterialDrawer can have it's gravity. Set it to right. If you need to change the layouts to support rtl, just add the layout of let's say the PrimaryDrawerItem to your project, and modify it to be RTL. \nI can't test it so i can't add it as default. \n. @alexander159 this value is not used anymore. The background of the app is not handled by the MaterialDrawer. \nI'll remove this attribute in a future release. Thanks.\n. @NorbertSzydlowski please add some more information? What are you referring to?\n. @seba123neo this is not yet possible. as an alternative i would recommend that you move the code outside the listener into a own method and you can trigger this once after start and in the event method then.\n. @seba123neo great ;)\n. @mutindaz nice idea, but in my opinion this should stay up to the dev. it is really easy to do this inside your code so i really suggest you do this.\ni want to keep this library as light as possible to allow future updates and changes and flexibility. \n. @mutindaz thanks ;)\n. @Java-Help not sure what you want to do, but please take a look at the sample application. It shows how you can nest the DrawerLayout inside your layout (this is the only solution to have the darkening only in this area) \n. The MaterialDrawer will create a DrawerLayout as you would to. As we use Toolbars now and those are in the layout and the DrawerLayout is above the whole layout so it can be under the statusbar the shadow is drawn above the whole layout (this is done by the DrawerLayout nothing to change by me) \nIf you want only the right area to have the shadow oyu have to nest the DrawerLayout inside your view hirachie. See the sample app for a sample implementation for this. \nNo idea why you want such an behavior, but it's possible\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\nThis is the last sample activity if you start the sample app. Please note this will include the drawer inside your view. not as root. Look at the layout it uses. You will realize that the layout is under the drawer --> so only the area on the right of the drawer is darkened.\n. @guilhermearaujo why you need them to deselect? Just disable the selection on those items?\nbut if you really want to deselect try drawer.setSelection(-1)\n. try to set the selection to -1 on the result object. \nyes they are still clickable but they wont feature a selected state\n. You use this method:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L2108 ?\n. @guilhermearaujo please try\njava\nsetSelection(-1, false);\n. @guilhermearaujo great. i will fix the issue for the call without the false in a future release. Thanks\n. @guilhermearaujo oh sorry. just saw the thrown exception was not by the library. Please make sure that you check if the DrawerItem in the onDrawerClickListener is not null. Because this one can be null. (If the user clicks on a header, or if you set the selection to an non existing item..)\n. @guilhermearaujo but still there was a nullPointerException. setSelection(-1); should not throw a nullPointer. As far as i found everything is checked in my code. So are you sure the NullPointer was not in your code?\n. @guilhermearaujo can you please post the whole stacktrace?\nBecause as it was the MaterialDrawer there have to be more MaterialDrawer specific lines.\n. @sdeff for sure. but as far as i can tell from the log it's nothing caused by the MaterialDrawer. The online line which contains the materialdrawer package is this one:\ncom.mikepenz.materialdrawer.view.ScrimInsetsFrameLayout.draw(SourceFile:85)\nbut this is not the issue here. As far as i can tell you have done something with tinting the widgets and somewhere a drawable which is missing. (just to prove that this is no issue by the MaterialDrawer, it only includes one single drawable and this is: circle_mask.xml)\n. @Dimorinny you mean the icon of a user?\nJust update the ProfileDrawerItem?\nupdateProfileByIdentifier()\nThe profile which will be updated must have an identifier which is set to the ProfileDrawerItem with withIdentifier() this one has to be unique!\n. @DavidHR96 what'S the appcompat library version you use?\n. @DavidHR96 https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#-v290\n. @patelakshay13890 do you ad the Android-Iconics project seperately to your build.gradle? If yes, i assume you have a different version than the version included in the MaterialDrawer. If you want to add it on your own you can remove the transitive from the MaterialDrawer dependency, but then you have to make sure to add the all the dependencies yourself\n. @patelakshay13890 the MaterialDrawer comes automatically with the Android-Iconics library so normally nothing to add here on your side ;)\nGot it working?\n. @patelakshay13890 you have 2 drawers? or just one?\nJust use the Drawer.Result object which is returned by \u00b4.build()\u00b4 or \u00b4.append()\u00b4 and use the result.openDrawer() or result.closeDrawer() methods\n. @patnisonal @abuzuhri as shown in the sample application your app must init the DrawerImageLoader. As this library does not contain an ImageLoading library (because everyone uses different ones, Picasso, Glice, ...) \nA detailed instruction is shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L22\nThis should be done before loading the first image (i prefer the implementation in the Application)\n``` java\n        //initialize and create the image loader logic\n        DrawerImageLoader.init(new DrawerImageLoader.IDrawerImageLoader() {\n            @Override\n            public void set(ImageView imageView, Uri uri, Drawable placeholder) {\n                Picasso.with(imageView.getContext()).load(uri).placeholder(placeholder).into(imageView);\n            }\n        @Override\n        public void cancel(ImageView imageView) {\n            Picasso.with(imageView.getContext()).cancelRequest(imageView);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Drawable placeholder(Context ctx) {\n            return null;\n        }\n    });\n\n``\n. @matthew2402 you are right. I'll add it in the next release. It makes sense for changing the section name :P Thanks.\n. @YuvPrime i assume you've missed the transitive in yourbuild.gradle`?\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz.materialdrawer:library:2.9.2@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. @YuvPrime that's interesting. Is your gradle in offline mode?\n. the first line says .materialdrawer and the second one aboutlibraries two different libs ;)\nEverything seems correct. What's AS version are you using? or which build tools?\n. The sample app should work out of the box, so the question is what's happening for you. Can you add more information about the development environment you have?\nThe MaterialDrawer is this project. The AboutLibraries can be found here: https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries\n. Android Studio 1.2? Perhaps this causes some troubles. Haven't updated yet because i've read about some issues. \nIt would be interesting if someone else already uses the latest Android Studio and sees similar issues\n. @YuvPrime so i assume you made a small mistake during importing the sample project. But good that it is working ;)\nYou can also jump over to gitter and we can chat there.\n. @SuperiorJT i have decided to not mimic any visual stuff which is not provided by google and is not specified. Google states to display stuff on pre Lollipop devices as it was default there. It is already wrong that i use a translucent StatusBar for the Drawer on Pre Lollipop devices, but i think this one is ok :D\nIf you really need the ripple effect just implement your own DrawerItem or extend the PrimaryDrawerItem ;). Is a task of a few minutes and will work with the lib ;)\nThe same if you don't want a click feedback. Just implement your own Custom DrawerItem ;). Extend an existing DrawerItem or implement your own by implementing the IDrawerItem\n. @RubyDerBoss and how do you create those icons? what's the color of the original icons?\n. @RubyDerBoss so the behavior is working correct. If you tint the icon it will have the correct color for the Drawer as of the Material Design Guidlines\n. @RubyDerBoss so the behavior is working correct.

The \"problem\" is that the header won't move under the statusBar. so the pixels which would be under the statusBar are shown below it and the header seems higher. \n. As far as i can tell this is no real issue. i have not found a word about this in the google material design guidelines. If you find something let me know ;)\n. @rebus007 ok they cut it. so even if it is not documented. let us assume google's apps are correct ;)\n. @RubenGees you can do everything with the Drawer generated by the lib as with a normal DrawerLayout. If it is not possible with a DrawerLayout it is not possible here either. \nAbout the show on first use. Not sure if this is still the cases with the new Material Design Guidelines. I can for sure add it to the MaterialDrawer but it is also a very easy task for you to implement in your application\n. @RubenGees the peak thing is working on my phone. i think this is default DrawerLayout functionality.\nabout the open on first launch. i'll add this. because it's handy. for some special usecases :D\n. @RubenGees in fact i just checked the source of this drawer lib. it does not include the logic to store if it was shown on first launch? how do you did it?\n. @RubenGees if you can send the sample implementation i will include that name. (or that code, have written it already)\n. @RubenGees thanks. is in the next version\n. How do you init the Drawer?\n. @NodensN i would recommend to create it in the onCreate method so it won't be created again if it is not necessary. \nhmmm else looks everything fine. Haven't had such an issue with my apps live in the playstore either. \n. @NodensN normally you should only create the drawer in the onCreate once, as long as the current view exists. If the view is recreated the drawer also needs to be recreated. No need to do it inside onResume(). \n. @NodensN i will close this. Just report back if you still see this issue.\n. withSelectedIconColorRes() is currently broken. an update is on it's way ;)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/238\n. @danielgomezrico see this section:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#custom-style---stylesxml\nadd this to your style:\nxml\n        <item name=\"material_drawer_primary_icon\">@color/pickup_primary</item>\n. Please read the upgrade notes:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#-v290\nIt is required to set the theme for the toolbar, as it is no longer possible to handle this via theme.\n. @dizelmotor wrong namespace. with appcompat v22.1.0 you have to use android:theme\nxml\n android:theme=\"@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar\"\n. @VINChe1990 the DrawerItem. you can set the name as test or from resource, but you will only be able to get it back with the same method. The sample app also uses those methods and it works. :/\nPerhaps you can post a bit more of your source, so it's easier to hunt down the issue\n. @VINChe1990 right ;)\n. @fnk0 the MaterialDrawer library will create a DrawerLayout as you would to. If you set the gravity it is just the DrawerLayout. This has nothing to do with the ActionBarDrawerToggle or the Toolbar. (It has just a method to simplify the ActionBarDrawerToggle usage)\nThe screenshot just shows a normal MenuItem on the right, so just handle the open and close of the drawer manually if you click this menu item. result.openDrawer()\nAbout the exception you get. Can you post a Stacktrace please?\n. Ok i found your FC. It is because the ActionBarDrawerToggle (which is created by Android and included in the support libs) won't handle a different Drawer than a LEFT sided Drawer. This means you have to handle the ActionBarDrawerToggle, or to be more specific the icon and the navigation up there, on your own. To do this just don't pass the Toolbar to the MaterialDrawer and handle it as you would with any other DrawerLayout.\nHere the FC. You can see the message on the top.\nNo drawer view found with gravity LEFT\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No drawer view found with gravity LEFT\n            at android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout.openDrawer(DrawerLayout.java:1322)\n            at android.support.v7.app.ActionBarDrawerToggle.toggle(ActionBarDrawerToggle.java:289)\n            at android.support.v7.app.ActionBarDrawerToggle.access$100(ActionBarDrawerToggle.java:65)\n            at android.support.v7.app.ActionBarDrawerToggle$1.onClick(ActionBarDrawerToggle.java:201)\n            at android.view.View.performClick(View.java:4780)\n            at android.view.View$PerformClick.run(View.java:19866)\n            at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:739)\n            at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95)\n            at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:135)\n            at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5254)\n            at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n            at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:372)\n            at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:903)\n            at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:698)\n. @fnk0 no problem\n. @dzungpv i think i know what's going on. one part has to be fixed by me. \n(You have to make sure on your side to store the specific state too :D so it is restored on the next launch)\n. yeah i know. and i think i know why. let me check this later today.\n. @patelakshay13890 perhaps you can add screenshots. I don'T understand which vectors you mean. and what you want to achieve.\n. @FriesischScott thanks for this additional check\n. @danielgomezrico you can also use the built in Android-Iconics library to use Material Design Icons. All the Google Material Design Icons are already in ;) via Font so they scale for all devices. No drawables required\n. You can generate normal Drawables with the Android-Iconics lib. \nOr what do you mean? \n. @danielgomezrico yeah ok. so you will have to keep your forms via drawables if you want to set them via styles. but you can use the Android-Iconics for the Drawer and MenuItems and everywhere else ;)\n. @danielgomezrico you can update items inside the drawer or header with the update methods. \nalso make sure the items have identifiers so i can map the correct ones together.\n. You can generally disable closing with this:\nwithCloseOnClick(false)\nand then just close the drawer on your own with result.closeDrawer() if you need to close it\n. @stepanov-standy seems an issue for this device. there is a logic inside the drawer calculating the correct width for all devices (tablest, landscape, etc...) i will take a look at it, and why it is wrong for a Nexus One.\n. Just in case this is the code:\njava\npublic static int getOptimalDrawerWidth(Context context) {\n        int possibleMinDrawerWidth = UIUtils.getScreenWidth(context) - UIUtils.getThemeAttributeDimensionSize(context, android.R.attr.actionBarSize);\n        int maxDrawerWidth = context.getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.material_drawer_width);\n        return Math.min(possibleMinDrawerWidth, maxDrawerWidth);\n    }\nI assume on API Level 10 the actionBarSize resource return 0\n. @destil this is no real issue with the newest AppCompat library there should be a toolbar which is passed to the ActionBarDrawerToggle. You get a NullPointerException by default or if you try to call result.getActionBarDrawerToggle()?\n. @MassiveZergInc theoretically it is possible to animate the ListView items. As of the Material Design Guidelines this is not specified. If you really need this look for animating ListView items. You can get the reference to the ListView from the Result object. \nAs of animating the switch of the normal drawer item list to the account list. This is not possible because the header or footer is also part of the ListView (footerView, headerView) and so they will also animate. \nI hope this helps\n. @wKovacs64 thanks.\n@somghosh the color of the Hamburger icon is defined in the correct color for the correct theme. If you need a different color you can follow the info in #176 , but in general this is a default Android thing. Nothing MaterialDrawer specific ;)\n. how do you set the bitmap to the ImageView?\n. @rabyunghwa then the DrawerImageLoader is obsolete because you don't use it. \nYou set the bitmap to your profile and then it's wrong? do you change it at a later time or what's happening?\n. @rabyunghwa i have found the issue with bitmaps. will be fixed in the next version\n. @RubenGees that's true. because the stickyItems do not have a position like the items in the drawer. so i can't remember the exact positioning. \n. This issue is a bit of a bigger thing as the footer is managed separately..\nwill have to see how i can get this in without adding a lot of unnecessary logics and checks..\n. In fact i assume that the difference for the few items is not noticeable.\nAny real noticeable difference?\n. As of the stackoverflow answer no advantage for short lists.\nWhy do I still like ArrayLists is probably that I normally work as backend\nengineer with plain java only.\nRui Oliveira notifications@github.com schrieb am Mi., 20.

Should do the same.\n. @ChainsDD thanks for the Pull Request, but the next version as mentioned in the issue already contains this feature. it will be released soon.\n. @danielgomezrico i already use the system palette from the compat lib. and have my own cache ;). \n. @jdzuri set selection is valid because it allows you to pass an boolean with the info if it should fire the event ;). \n\nsetSelection(int position, boolean fireOnClick)\n. No problem :D\n. @phanghos if you use the good old ActionBar it is not possible to Display the drawer on top of it. This is a limitation of the Android System. \nIf you want a drawer with the full height and a translucent StatusBar you have to use a Toolbar. \nAs a sidefact. You should switch to the Toolbar. It will give you so much new possibilities. The switch is done very easily. Just take a look at the sample app\n. @phanghos as far as i know (and i hope i am not wrong :D) it is not possible. i found no \"hack\" or any api to do this. \nIf someone has an idea let me know ;)\n. @phanghos yeah i found out the same. \n. @gearlles please check out the sample app. Yes this is possible.  \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L115\n. @NogerbekNurzhan \n1. the library uses the system default selection drawable. this is different in pre lollipop devices. as far as i know those are not changeable by theme or the default does not change with the primaryColor. The only solution would be to provide a custom drawable to do so. Until now i had decided to don't do so. \n   With my tests the text should be still readable..\n2. you can set any header you like. withHeader. You can't change the height of the AccountHeader as this is defined in the guidelines and there is no other size you should use\n. @NogerbekNurzhan drawing the selector below the text will probably improve it again. \nI talk about this line:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L1407\nIf i change it to > API 21 it will show the Ripple on Top and the normal selector in the Background. \nTheoretically it's possible to get the ListView from the result object and change the ListViews selector\n. @NogerbekNurzhan yeah will change it to draw the selector below. \nAbout the header. you can set any custom layout as header so the height is defined by you then.\n. @ruinpsilva if you want to set it use this withDescription()\nif you want to update an existing item, define an identifier for the item and just change the description of it at a later time. there a method on the result object which allows you to update a DrawerItem\n. @ruinpsilva great. just let me know if there are more questions. Or head over to gitter\n. @swain84 this is a separate project: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics\nWhat are you going to try?\n. Thanks for the info . I've added ShowCaseView to the header so people will find it if they search ;)\n. @bbetter if which activity finishes? if the activity with the drawer is gone there is no more drawer to show. you can disable the close if you click on a item with result.withCloseOnClick(false)\n. @bbetter yes. having this indicator per DrawerItem would be so much overhead that it makes no sense. \n. This is no valid navigation pattern. The drawer should only be available in the root activity. if there are different views in the root you should use fragments. if you jump to other activites those should not have a drawer. \nstill you can do this with the drawer. but i highly recommend to do it like it should be done. \n. @ammar786-1 i know ;). it was just a hint to follow the guidelines (and we all know google itself doesn't do this :P)\nabout the main issue. I think the BaseActivity he has written must be wrong, there is no thing in the Drawer which should prevent this. \nIn fact it should work exactly as in any other default activity. as seen in the sample app. \n. @ToonvanStrijp You have a different badge there. Can you share the DrawerItem or badge logic you have? It looks really good?\n. @ToonvanStrijp did the .withTranslucentStatusBar(false) work?\ni will look at it. but thanks for the code snippets ;)\n. @ToonvanStrijp I really like the style. perhaps i will add this to the default badge ;) let me see :P\n. @RubenGees i have a nexus 5 with Android 5.1 and i see the ripple. \n\n. @RubenGees ah i have found what you mean. the list plays the ripple with a touch. but the sticky don't.\nI am not sure yet which one of both is correct. \n. @RubenGees ok the ripple is working as it should but only if this item is not checkable. this makes sense because the drawable is replaced as soon as your select it. so if you want the ripple to play. this item should not switch in a selected state afterwards.\n. @RubenGees it is \"working\" there because it has another layer. i really suggest that this stays just for the list, because i do not want to add another layout layer to the footer. the list draws the selector on top of the item. and the selected image is in the background. this is not the case for the footer. \nthe user will directly see that he has selected something as the icon get's the selected state. if you have an issue with this you can also set the drawerClose delay to 0. this will be a bit sluggish in some cases if you switch fragments, but the user won't actually see that the ripple would have been showed. \n. @RubenGees i'm also an perfectionist. but in this case performance is a bit more important ;)\nthanks for all your input. i do my best to keep it perfect :P \n. @ToonvanStrijp look here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#code-1\nOr look at the sample. \nThe Drawer object you get after building it has the required methdos\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L171\n. position is != identifier. don't mix position and identifier up!\n. ok then you can do this. just make sure they will match. or you make sure to define them. \n. @bbetter can you be a bit more specific? the sample app uses a toolbar and everything works as it should. \nIf you do some custom stuff you will have to handle the DrawerToggle on your own. The Drawer provides the required APIs\n. @Chesteer89 there is a easy method do show the name as addition to the email: withNameShown(true) (on the ProfileDrawerItem)\n. @Chesteer89 else this will require a CustomProfileDrawerItem ;). In fact you can just use the source of the ProfileDrawerItem and only write out the name. ;)\n. @Anatidae-Project i was referring to the following commit:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/45926c8147aa1cbf35fa56b8bf4238db452d9572\nI use the setTag() method and getTag() methods for the header to get the reference of the profile set in the circle images on the top. as these are ImageViews and users have the option to provide any image loading library on their own the imageViews are used directly. With Picasso it does not make any problems, but if you choose to use Glide it will break if a tag was set on an ImageView. It is just because of their implementation and i did not know about any other library doing the same. (in fact glide does no work yet because somehow it runs into a circular operation....) \nyou should be save doing so. (as long as you don't set the tag on an ImageView in combination with Glide ;)\n. @patelakshay13890 i assume you do something in the Main Thread which blocks the UI. This is not MaterialDrawer specific. \nRipple effect only on devices with API Level > 21\n. @patelakshay13890 i use the drawer in all of my apps. have tested it on many different devices + emulators. (HTC Desire S, which is really slow). \nNo delays or hangs. So it has to be specific to your application.\n. If you can proof the opposite i will try to fix it. but no other reports yet and i can't reproduce any screen hangs for 2 seconds\n. @aminezghidi without knowing your code i just assume you return true inside the onDrawerItemClick listener. \ntrue means that the event was consumed and no further action is required from the drawer. As you want the drawer to finish everything and close itself you should return false, which states the event was not consumed and all things after this should continue to run.\n. I assume it's the same as this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/363\n.

I have checked out the source of the new NavigationView and as far as i've found it has no support for custom DrawerItems so it won't allow me to do the AccountSwitcher, or anything else.

You can check out the current source yourself too, if you find information on how this would be possible let me know. \n. @grote the header is the smallest problem. The main issue is that the NavigationView only has 3 different types of Items in it's list. As far as i understand the code there is no function to add additional or different items, which would be required. \n\nI totally understand that the new NavigationView works great for a very very simple Drawer. just with a simple header. just with one type of drawer item and with sections. \nno profiles, no custom drawer items, no sticky footer, no sticky header. no normal footer, ...\n. @joxad sorry this is not possible the AccountHeader will only work with a normal drawer, and when the list of items is there. What you theoretically could do is just create a CustomDrawerItem which is full height and contains the fragment you want to display.

That the item does not stay selected is a known issue and won't be fixed. The required api calls are missing in this release. and as it already is recommend to develop for 14+ or even 16+ it just makes no sense to spend a few hours on fixing this. \nAbout the scrolling, i'll check it\n. @Trojaner25 thanks. but pull requests please on the develop branch\n. @Spiderbezno there is no attribute rippleColor inside the MaterialDrawer library. Neither in the Android-Iconics library. \n. @Anatidae-Project in fact i already updated for the appcompat v22.2.0\ni am pretty sure this issue is something completely different, but as i got a new notebook it will take a while until everything is set up again \n.

I have seen the short video @alorma sent to me according this issue and i will fix this issue.\n. @ianholing just tested this with the .withSelectedItem(-1) and opening and closing the Accountslist, and i can't reproduce your issue. Do you do anything else inside your onProfileChanged listener?\nI also tried it with setting the selection via the result.setSelection(-1) method.

This is correct. But if you take a closer look at the specifications you can see that those drawables are in fact only 24dp with 1dp padding. And this is done inside the Drawer too. \nSo the provided DrawerItems use the correct size according to the Google Material Design Guideliens. If you need different icon sizes i recommend you to just implement a CustomDrawerItem. \nThere's also an example in the source of the app how to extend an existing DrawerItem if you want to simplify this process.\n. @str4d but as the drawer also allows you to provide a drawable you can create the IconicsDrawable with the correct size + padding?\n. @str4d there is no original padding. in fact this uses a font to have the vector icons. So i am afraid there is no such thing like padding by icon. (and i also assume that nobody will make such an list) Also if someone does it is enough if there's a wiki page describing the paddings per icon.\n. @str4d there is no original padding. in fact this uses a font to have the vector icons.

There are enough resources on StackOverFlow available ;). \nOn a side note. You shouldn't do this. The Drawer should be the full height. Only in some special samples it is ok if it was done different\n. But in fact i assume you are looking for this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/library/src/main/res/values/styles.xml#L152\n. @mingqlin no default RTL support in this launcher as i can't test. there were a few issues already regarding this. please search for them in the github issues section\n. @mingqlin thanks a lot for the above info. the next update will include a fix for this issue. there is still a different problem with RTL and the Iconics Drawable.

I keep it as default from the DrawerLayout\n. @thanhsontube just get the DrawerLayout from the Drawer and lock it.\n. @sanuggko it depends what you are doing. and what is probably causing the lag. I can't tell what happens as this is no problem with my apps or the sample app. \nAny code?\n. @artemkutukov if you use a custom header .you will have to manually overlay it. you can look at the logic how i create this overlay for the normal header.

You will have to create a custom view for your header add it and perhaps inflate the AccountHeader\n. @korrio can you be a bit more specific? which header? From AccountHeader? Just use the method getView() method of the accountHeader. \nIf you set your own view. You can use the getHeader() method\n. @korrio can you be a bit more specific? which header? From AccountHeader? Just use the method getView() method of the accountHeader. \nIf you set your own view. You can use the getHeader() method\n. @RubenGees for me this seems as a random crash. as the free RAM does not mean anything. I am also pretty sure the materialDrawer reference here is just random as it loaded the drawable, and this could happen everywhere. it was just bad luck that it states materialdrawer\n. @RubenGees for me this seems as a random crash. as the free RAM does not mean anything. I am also pretty sure the materialDrawer reference here is just random as it loaded the drawable, and this could happen everywhere. it was just bad luck that it states materialdrawer\n. @RubenGees there are some cases a OutOfMemory will happen and you can't do much about it. I don't know what the rest of your application does? My application wallsplash shows a lot of images and never had an OutOfMemory with the drawer, but with loading the images and other stuff. I was able to optimaze it and to minimize it, but i'm not able to totally remove them. If it happens all the time you have probably done something wrong. But if it happens once in a week or so with 1000 daily users you should be fine.\n. @RubenGees what icons do you set for the drawer?\n. @RubenGees ok should be fine. as long as the correct sizes are used.\n. @agungsijawir what do you mean with no surface reaction?\nActionBarDrawerToggle is only working if you set the toolbar for the Drawer.\n. @agungsijawir what do you mean with no surface reaction?\nActionBarDrawerToggle is only working if you set the toolbar for the Drawer.\n. @agungsijawir still not sure what you mean because there is a ripple effect on click with API 21+\nperhaps you use the wrong theme? \n. @agungsijawir still not sure what you mean because there is a ripple effect on click with API 21+\nperhaps you use the wrong theme? \n. @agungsijawir :) the problem is that the wrong theme has a differen ripple color and this color is not visible then :D\n. @agungsijawir :) the problem is that the wrong theme has a differen ripple color and this color is not visible then :D\n. @WhiteStarUA there are enough articles about this on StackOverFlow. I don't see this to be anything MaterialDrawer specific. This is just about setting a Fragment on click. \n. @badoualy have you found out something new?\n. @badoualy i have added the functionality to Android-Iconics to create drawables with a text. So can you try to use this, and report if it also creates the same troubles for you?\n(The latest version of Android-Iconics is included in the latest MaterialDrawer ;) )\n. @badoualy yeah i just want to make sure it is not caused by the MaterialDrawer\n. @cami7ord if you have an ActionBar you will have to handle the hamburger icon on your own. \nI really suggest you to update to a Toolbar this is done within 3 minutes and allows you to have a Drawer which goes below the StatusBar and follows the Google Material Design Guidelines\n. xml\nandroid:gravity=\"center_vertical|start\"\nshould also do the job\n. @Aeefire yeah because if you use the default implementation the drawer is FULLSCREEN .This can't be changed. If you want the drawer to be only below the toolbar you will have to look at the CustomContainerActivity https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java \n. @Aeefire if you have a left and a right drawer you will have to create a normal Drawer. And then another CustomContainerActivity. Those are more complex things and require a bit more work on your side.\n. @tommytcchan I don't see a thing why it should not be compatible. This library will just inflate a DrawerLayout inside a FrameInsetsLayout in the root and so the content should be as in any other application. If this is not the thing you need there you can do a more advanced setup. Most cases are shown in the sample app. \n. @saeedsh92 this is available on devices with API Level 21 +\n. @Grozny when you switch the profile through which method? \nIt is possible for the header, and the small profile icons. But not though the profiles in the list. This is caused by the following:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/accountswitcher/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L1185\nBecause i have to reset the drawer through a handler to keep it smooth, but i will have to return the state if the event was consumed directly. \n. @Grozny with the OnAccountHeaderListener you can just pass true which states that the event was consumed, and nothing else will happen.\n. @taimur97 just check out the sample app, and take a closer look at the ComplexHeader Drawer \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java\nit contains everything you need. \n\nAbout your NullPointerException -> You have not added a Toolbar to the Drawer, so it can't handle it for you\n. @sharikovvladislav you develop an android app? why not use maven? The thing here is that you need to have the Google Repository on your pc. This can be installed through the Android Studio Settings -> Android SDK --> Google Support Repository\n\n. @sharikovvladislav oh i wanted to ask why you do not use gradle? which is the main android build system. and which handles importing files from maven. \nalso it will handle the fact that all google specific libs are not on maven, only on a local maven repository which gets installed through the SDK tools. \nI know how maven works. But as mentioned in my previous answer. Google's dependencies are not on maven central, nor jCenter. They are only in a local maven repo which gets installed through the Android SDK\n\nAnother point, that I am not understanding something is you couldn't miss that fact, that dependency of your project is not found.\n\nPlease keep friendly. I spend my free time for creating open source, and i spend my free time to answer issues, even if they are not caused by my library like this. If you use any other library which also has an dependency to a google library you will have the same issue. \nAnd to be fair. Your screenshot even shows that it can't find the appcompat dependency, but mine. \nabout the error you get if you include it manually. as mentioned you should use gradle for the whole project, as this is the main build system of Android. This library was set up with Android Studio and with gradle and so it is correct. \nYou can find more information about Android Studio here: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\n. @sharikovvladislav ok it's fine. ;)\nHow you can fix it. I would highly suggest you use the official tools and the official Android Studio. IT has far better support and you can be sure that it's supported. If you are new to Android development it's even better if you start of with the correct toolset. \nAbout the Android SDK Tools. They are different than the thing you need. The tools for Android Studio come with the SDK Manager. And through the SDK Manager you can install the tools, the apis, and also the extras, --> Google Support repository. \nUsing gradle. If you start with the project and with everything. I really suggest it!. Most people will only give support if you use the correct tools. And you can be sure that there are updates in the future and that it's supported in the future\n. @taimur97 you also have to pass the toolbar to the drawer with withToolbar()\nAlso you do not mention what is not working with the onClick?\n. You can define an identifier per drawerItem and check for that identifier in the onClick method. It's the best method. \nJust take a close look at how it'S done in the sample app. It does everything you need ;)\n. @taimur97 why do you need to go the way over the imageView? picasso and other image loading libs still allow you to fetch it as bitmap or drawable?\n. @taimur97 you can also get the ImageView of the header by calling header.getHeaderBackgroundView() ?\n. @korrio the header background is accessible via it's view? see previous answer. also you can easily extend the PrimaryDrawerItem if you need extended functionality\n. @danielgomezrico this is normal. This is caused because this specific option is only available on API > 21\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/view/BezelImageView.java#L134\n. you init the drawer without modifications? or have you any special setup?\n. @danielgomezrico i assume it has to do something with the map because if you take a close close look on the map you will see that the drawer is visible a bit in the area of the locate button\n. @danielgomezrico i think you should not refer to a library in an official android bug report. have you tried it with a normal DrawerLayout with the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout without any library code? \nAlso do you use the latest version? updated to the latest appcompat libs?\n. @danielgomezrico i mean refer to the MaterialDrawer library. the android team can only care if it's just their apis. and if this is reproduceable with just the DrawerLayout and nothing more\n. great that you found your answer\n. @shic were you able to figure it out?\n. @shic it is the only correct solution ;). +1\n. i should. but implementing new things or bugfixing is of a higher prio for me :D you can add it if you like ;)\n. @shic ;) https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#-v298\n. @AngleV yes you can just pass one profile and use the withSelectionListEnabledForSingleProfile(false)  method\n. @paulgavrikov this can be done via the DrawerLayout functions. Just get the DrawerLayout and lock it.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#can-i-lock-the-drawer\n. @jbarr21 just tried it and it's working for me. i also have a Nexus 5 with Android 5.1. \nAny special setup?\n. @jbarr21 why you return true inside your onClick listener?\ndoes the my_own_custom_layout.xml contain all the ids of the original layout? the thing is that the selection listener is different for devices with api >= 21. then it's set over the whole view, not only the selection area as before\n. @jbarr21 correct ;)\nyes it fires the event when i set the breakpoint inside the listener. something has to be different with the layout. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/444\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/424\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/402\n--> https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=lock\nAbout showing back arrow\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L159\n. @patelakshay13890 you can try the sample app. and open the ComplexHeader Drawer activity. And try it. It will work as expected and close the current activtiy with the arrow.\n. @gparigibini please check the code of the sample application. it showcases how this is working. you can even download the sample via google play and try it out. (You should open the Complex Header Drawer activity)\nHere's the code of the specific activity to try: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L159\n. @gparigibini you tried the implementation like it'S done in the ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity? Because if you test the sample app you can switch to the back arrow and then it will close the activity. \n. @gparigibini I can only check with more source code. if you did everything like in the sample app it should work\n. @gparigibini you should only create the drawer by default. pass the toolbar to it and you are fine. now as you need the back arrow call the following code:\nresult.getActionBarDrawerToggle().setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(false);\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);\nsample reference 1\nIf you want back the burger icon do the following:\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(false);\nresult.getActionBarDrawerToggle().setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(true);\nsample reference 2\nNow you know how to switch between both states. Now you also need a listener to react if the user clicks on the back arrow. so you add the following:\n```\n.withOnDrawerNavigationListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerNavigationListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public boolean onNavigationClickListener(View clickedView) {\n                        //Do whatever you need in the complex header example i do the following:\n                    //this method is only called if the Arrow icon is shown. The hamburger is automatically managed by the MaterialDrawer\n                    //if the back arrow is shown. close the activity\n                    ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.this.finish();\n                    //return true if we have consumed the event\n                    return true;\n                }\n            })\n\n```\nsample reference 3\n. @gparigibini no paypal link as i don't do this for money :D I am happy that the MaterialDrawer helps so many devs out there, and i try to keep it the best drawer lib as far as possible. \nHelping devs out there is great, as i use other libs in my projects too. So i just give something back :D. And i also hope that helping others, will probably help me sometime if i need the help ;)\nSo thank you so much, and i'm glad that we fixed it ;)\n. @pedrox-3w it was renamed: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java\n. @deinok will be fixed in the next version\n. - i should push always :D fixed it already. still thanks ;)\n. @MichaelEvans can you be a bit more specific? where do you want to use it?\nSetting it for a default DrawerItem is not possible, you will have to extend or implement your own CustomDrawerItem and just set the drawable. \nAlso why do you need it? Is the normal tinting not enough?\n. @samy-baili https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java\n. it's in v3.1.1\n. @tom91136 you can provide your custom view for the stickyFooter or the stickyHeader. You can also provide a custom view for the header itself. You can also provide custom views for the drawer. \nWhich use case is still required?\n. @tom91136 there are the javadocs uploaded to maven central. what do you mean with bundling them?\nabout the withHeader. it adds the view as headerView inside the ListView but i also have the option of a StickyHeader. At the moment i stayed with a ListView because of the included selected state handling, and the automatically provideded Header but i also know how to build custom views for a RecyclerView which interact like headers. In fact i'm quite comfortable with both. But i did not see a real advantage of the RecyclerView for the Drawer.\nLast years Google IO app went even with an ScrollView\n. @tom91136 if you let me know what you want to do. I mean why do you need a RecyclerView?\n. ok in this case this is not yet possible. I think you got one of the only cases where it is a bad idea to use this lib. (for now. :D) \nI mean it will be easier that you handle the content on your own. \nyou can even use the provided views, and the drawer itself. but you will have to go with your own logic for the content. so you can go with a customView. let me check if it is possible to get rid of the whole ListView for your special case\n. @tom91136 yeah but you have a very complex use case. so you will have a bad time with all available drawers :D haha\n. @tom91136 at the moment the only thing you can do is to have a completely customView within the Drawer, but this will also require you to manage everything on your own. as a RecyclerView works completely different in terms of header, footer, items, keeping track of selection, ..\nI'm afraid you can only use the stuff which happens around like managing the statusbar, toggle, etc for you. \n. Sorry. If you can't go with the MaterialDrawer. feel free to ask for Drawer specific stuff and how things should be like described in the Material Design Guidelines\n. @wKovacs64 oh i see :/ broke it with this commit https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/7c2385f21e9db55654a623f89b79f0bfde43781a\n. You can provide your own logic to download the ProfileImages from the web. As an example via picasso. You can check this out in the sample. You can then simply provide the url for the profile.\nYou have to provide the ImageLoader logic here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L22\nAnd then just use the url of the image when you create the profile\n. @stratbasher but as you see it gives you an imageView and the url and you can do your own logic... \n. no it isn't you have to do it. \nyou have to set the url for the profiles\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L57\n. Probably you should do this:\nDrawerImageLoader.init(new CustomIDrawerImageLoader(this.employee, MainActivity.this));\nbefore creating the header?\n. yeah the cancel function will get called often as the views are switched and so on. it will require a good logic to handle this. so i use picasso for loading the image. \nif all this is not working i would suggest that you create the profile with a placeholder image. and you download the bitmap on your own. and as soon as you get it, you update the drawerItem with the image\n. because you should not do this. \nYou should keep an reference to your ProfileDrawerItem and just udpate this one with the image as soon as you get it. and then you can update the header with the udpated profileDrawerItem as soon as you got it\n. @stratbasher it's bad that your image is as base64 else you would be able to use any image loader. \nfor the second one you will have to set an identifier for your profile to identify it for the update and then you can do the following: accountHeader.updateProfileByIdentifier\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/454\n. @saadqbal i think not the nameRes is null but the drawerItem as the Header is no drawerItem. you should always do an null check or at least an instanceOf check for the item you use\n. @macmos i am not sure where you got the screenshot from, but the latest Google Music App also has the drawer from the top of the screen, same for the Google Play store and Google Inbox. \nIf you really want to achieve this, just check out the sample app it also shows how you can do this. \nScrolling is not as smooth? I really can't follow this one as it is very very smooth on my side too. how many items do you have in your drawer? \nthe MaterialDrawer uses an ListView including a ViewHolder and i also checked for everything to be smooth. The Google IO app from last year uses a ScrollView.\n. @macmos i never had any troubles with scroll performance in my apps using the MaterialDrawer. So perhaps you can give some insight how many items you have and what you are doing. If they have any special handling or anything else? What phone are you using?\nThanks\n. @marinica94 correct. this is solved in the latest version\n. @alorma awesome! :D\n. @A-N-D-R-E you should do this differently if you really want it below the toolbar (you should not do this!) any special need for this?\nSee the CustomContainer activity from the sample app it shows how to do this. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\nYou can see how it looks like if you try out the sample app\n. @EpsilonOrionis no api for this. if you need special handling you will have to create your own custom draweritem which allows you to do this. the easiest thing is that you just copy and paste the SwitchDrawerItem to your project and then modify it to work as expected for your needs.\n. you can use this method because you have the view. the view has a context. and the context has this method\n. @EpsilonOrionis then there must be a different issue. as this is now a class within your project. but view.getContext().getResources() is available. I even have the reference to the context:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/SwitchDrawerItem.java#L127\n. @EpsilonOrionis the class is part of your project it will also have access to R of your project. but if you have problems with your resources then you have to sort them out first. \n. @sanuggko the drawer has by default an delay of 200ms to prevent lag when switching fragments. you can add more delay or remove it if you want\n. withDelayOnDrawerClose\n. #476 \n. @MrThiago as far as i can see you just want to update the text of the item with the identifier 2. \nThe easiest thing is that you just remember this drawerItem\njava\nIDrawerItem actionDrawerItem = new PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(R.string.drawer_item_logout).withIdentifier(2).withCheckable(false);\nAnd then you can just add it.\njava\n.addDrawerItems(\n new PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(R.string.drawer_item_home).withIcon(FontAwesome.Icon.faw_home).withIdentifier(R.id.action_home).withCheckable(false),\nactionDrawerItem\n)\nAnd afterwards you can update it anytime with:\njava\nactionDrawerItem.withName(\"logout\"); //or login depending what you need\ndrawer.updateItem(actionDrawerItem);\n. @danielgomezrico the identifier you set is not a view.setId(). It is an identifier used for the DrawerItem objects so i can match them later for updates and so on...\nAs of now it is not possible to define identifiers for the views which are shown in the drawer\n. @danielgomezrico let me check if it somewhere conflicts with ids i set for those views. if not i will just set the identifier to the view too\n. @danielgomezrico should be fine. the change was done in the refactoring branch and will be available in a big update which won't be here in the next 1-2 weeks. i hope you can wait for it\n. @danielgomezrico have you tried with Gravity.LEFT?\n. @danielgomezrico strange. you try it on the correct layout and view as i can see. \n. @MrThiago not sue if you reach the method limit or there is a different issue. \nSomething which should be modified is the appcompat version as the Drawer uses 22.2.0\ncompile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.2.0'\nIf it's the method limit you should also probably just use the Google Play Service dependencies you really need. Not the complete package as you do right now\ncompile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.5.0'\n. @manuelernesto is your gradle in offline mode? any other issues if you run gradle in debug? \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L107\nSee the .withCheckable() attribute.\n. @MFlisar you can update a drawerItem at a later time. \n- So you keep the reference to your DrawerItem  (You also have to set an identifier to it)\n- Then you create the drawer with that one.\n- Then you can modify the DrawerItem and set it to the Drawer again via the update method.\n. @anticafe no the DrawerItem does not know about it's drawer. It can be used everywhere and you can modify it as you need it. you can even create a new object with the same identifier. also the drawer needs to get informed about the fact that it got changed\nyou also have to do this if you have an adapter somewhere including items you manage. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#activity-with-toolbar\nThere are even more options to modify the drawer after creation.\n. @alorma this one is just a demo sample. it should somehow preview how such an effect as seen in the screenshot can be created. It's likely to be used for tablets. \n\n\n. @simonckenyon @brunano21  added changes to the description\n. @saeedDarvish as soon as everything is tested and working.\n. @brunano21 javadoc is on maven. (will be improved)\nREADME.md is already updated for the branch\nSAMPLE app is also updated already\n. @FabianTerhorst not really as the MiniDrawer is something the dev should decide on it's own and manage on it's own. I will improve the api to make it easier to include it. but the fact if it should be used or displayed should be handled by the corresponding app dev. (i also do not want to mimic gmail in the whole behavior)\n@anticafe yes makes sense\n. @wKovacs64 it's ok :smile: \n. @wKovacs64 the position will now return the real position inside the RecyclerView. If you have one header it will be +1. This change was done as i would like people to use the identifier to check what should be done. \nOk this one is interesting. I tested everything with API 10, 17, 19, 21 :D\n. @wKovacs64 ok happens now also with 17. Thanks\n. I really don't know why it forgets about the padding on 4.1.1 & 4.2.2. The same for the MiniDrawer view. Got anyone ideas?\n. @wKovacs64 both should be fixed in the new source. here's a new sample app http://weew.ee/k781A\n. @wKovacs64 new build at the SNAPSHOT repo as: \ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.0.0.b2-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. @wKovacs64 haha :D ok that's now a problem. as i moved to set the marginLeft for the icon as padding does not work. no idea why. and no answers found about similar issues...\nok so i just fixed the coloring :D but not the tinting. thanks :P \n. @wKovacs64 ok seems the RelativeLayout i used for the items is causing the problems. will change\n. New build at the SNAPSHOT repo as: \ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.0.0.b3-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n@wKovacs64 this time those bugs should be fixed :D\n. @wKovacs64 ok thanks for this testing. was this already the case for v3.x?\nThe best would be to define your own item to select for creating. position will be inconsistent again. i will also probably remove or minimize the methods which allow you to define stuff via position. as it is just not transparent enough\n. New build at the SNAPSHOT repo as: \n- Includes fixes for tinting\n- Support annotations\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.0.0.b4-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n@wKovacs64 now tinting should be really fine\n. @wKovacs64 great. so now i removed the byIdentifier from the methods, and added byPosition to the old methods\n. @wKovacs64 sounds good but there is one problem. adding a DrawerItem at a position and so on. I will just not for those methods that the dev should know himself if he uses a header or not\n. @wKovacs64 yes i think you are right. \n. If someone has ideas to cleanup more methods or remove some methods let me know. \n. - updated google support library\n- improve MiniDrawer\n- some more fixes\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.0.0.b5-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. - more refactoring for the MiniDrawer\n- use new Crossfader library\n- some api improvements\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.0.0.b6-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. @wKovacs64 @FabianTerhorst @saeedDarvish @brunano21 @raghunandankavi2010 @alorma @simonckenyon @korrio @Rainer-Lang \nNew beta coming in ;).

I think it should be easy if you just also store the information. The thing is that i assume, that you already have to do any action if a profile gets selected, so you can store that information. \nA thing which just came in my mind. Perhaps i should switch the withIdentifier() to work with String so it will be possible to use a hash or anything as identifier for the DrawerItems. This will have the great side effect that you can even use an e-mail as identifier, so it would be possible to get track which profiles where selected the most and which one is currently active, so a automatic ordering for usage cound would be possible\n. @adamgrieger can you also try this with the latest RC: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/487#issuecomment-127687495\nIf you just use the SNAPSHOT you won't have the latest beta version yet. There were a lot of fixes in the latest RCs\n. @adamgrieger found the issue. will be fixed in the final release ;) Thanks for the report\n. @FabianTerhorst I never had animated items, but doing something like you do should still work, as i did not modify something in the main logic. If it is really a problem now i suggest that you create a CustomDrawerItem which allows you to have a special handling for AnimatedIcons so you can move the logic for the animation into the item ;)\n.withCloseOnClick(false) as of the current state there is no option to disable or modify the basic crossfade handling. What will you need?\nCan you be a bit more specific about the .withTranslucentStatusBar(true) you have with the miniDrawer? The thing here is that the layout hirachy is completely different than with a normal drawerLayout. The layout itself is embedded with the normal content, and this sample showcases this. this implementation is best for tablets, and as far as i know the MiniDrawer is more a Tablet thing than a phone specific element. \nJust tried withEnabled(false) in combination with the MiniDrawer. Seems fine. What's the issue here?\n. @deinok i already use the correct ViewHolder pattern, which should already be enough performance win. I have not used the data-binding api yet but i assume that it won't offer enough flexibility to implement all the features and extra behaviors which are required in this lib. \nThanks for the suggestion\n. @Dokuzov yes you are right this was an issue, will be possible in the final v4.0.0\n.

But you can somehow get this behavior if you cat cht eonClick on the parent DrawerItem and update the Drawer with the Additional Items (or remove them on the second click)\n. @ipragmatechadmin the v4.0.0 will base upon a RecyclerView but i still don't see an easy clean solution on implementing an Exandable DrawerItem or adding some real hirachy to it.\n. @SimonMayerhofer this works in the Sample app. Have you set something about configChanges in your manifest? or don't you store the saved instance?\n. @SimonMayerhofer interesting. you can try the sample application and there it works. this is managed by the DrawerLayout itself so nothing by the lib. \nI only store the last selected position in the bundle\n. @gpulido there is nothing like hidding you should delete / add those items on demand. so you can switch out all drawerItems if you like and add them back and so on. \nthanks ;)\n. @GYberkeley pass the Toolbar to the DrawerBuilder\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ComplexHeaderDrawerActivity.java shows everything you need \n. @anticafe can you show me the page inside the Google Material Design Guidelines where this is stated?\nYou can have the whole view but the non-rounded imageview with the current AccountHeader.

You need somewhere the implementation of this interface and keep the reference to the implementation. the implementation is then called from inside the activity with the onBackPressedListener.onBackPressed() with the onBackPressedListener being the implementation of the current active fragment. (in this case the fragment)\nPlease use Google search / Stackoverflow to find the information how to implement Listeners in Java.

Why don't you just use a MaterialDraewr theme? it is based on the appcompat theme and is compatible with all api levels down to 10?\n. Everything stated in the README ;) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#androidmanifestxml\nhere are all themes listed. those are part of the library. \n. I am sure you mix up light, and normal style\n. @macaronlover there is already a theme without an ActionBar just use MaterialdrawerTheme :D\nYou also don't overwrite any color values in your xml's?\n. If you don'T have an header jsut don'T create it and pass it to the drawer?\n. Then just check in an if? \nIf you are on a phone do not add it. if you are on a tablet add it?\n. if you want the header add it to the drawer if not don't add it. i do not get your question? if you have trouble with java things, please try to search via Google\n. but the drawer should be created in the activity (as shown in the samples) and in the activity you can decide what to do\n. you have many possibilities, but i do not see this as MaterialDrawer issue as the functionality works and everything is fine. \n. i repeat it again. if you don't need a header don't add it. if you need it add it. you can theoretically remove the header view from the drawer, but this is normally not done. \nthere is a method called removeHeader()\n. the removeHeader method only exists on the result of the drawer\n. on the result\n. the variable called result in your code?\n. why you remove it in both cases?\n. @macaronlover why do you try to getHeader from the result when you aren't going to use it?\n. @macaronlover why do you try to getHeader from the result when you aren't going to use it?\n. either you add the header and show it, or you remove it. i don't see what you are trying? if you removed it, it won't be shown. if you don't it will be shown. \n. either you add the header and show it, or you remove it. i don't see what you are trying? if you removed it, it won't be shown. if you don't it will be shown. \n.

(or i haven't found a solution for this)\nin case you will get it to work with an actionbar. to get your layout below the actionBar you can use the UIUtils class to get the ActionBar height and the StatusBar height and add it as margin\n. @macaronlover the MaterialDrawer does not change the behavior of the ActionBar / Toolbar. please use google to find answers to this problem.\nMy assumption is that this is default and can't be altered easily. --> Switch to a Toolbar which will allow you to manage this on your own\n. @macaronlover the MaterialDrawer does not change the behavior of the ActionBar / Toolbar. please use google to find answers to this problem.\nMy assumption is that this is default and can't be altered easily. --> Switch to a Toolbar which will allow you to manage this on your own\n. Shown in this example: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\n. But it's not Material Design Guideline conform \n. The Google Material Design Guidelines state that the drawer should be full height\n. https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/navigation-drawer.html#\n. I am from Austria :P\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/527\n. @engividal you mean the selected state does not work? have you set withCheckable(false)? remove this\n. Great :). What was the issue?\n. Just use it \n. It is correct. If you have modified it correctly it will just work. \n. @Aabidi09 if you need a different text you will have to create your own CustomDrawerItem with the modified behavior. (Copy the ToggleDrawerItem and modify it ;))\n. @githubbucah you can have the variable AccountHeaderBuilder and split the builder thing up in multiple parts. But this is normal java stuff ;). You can find enough information about this on Google or StackOverFlow\n. @githubbucah please use Google or Stackoverflow to find out basic programming questions. \nJust as a hint. .build() will return an AccountHeader, before build its an AccountHeaderBuilder. you can split it up. \n. @christiandennis yes if you have set an identifier for the profile this will work\n. @christiandennis i will take a look later.\nif you pass true with the setActiveProfile it should trigger .setActiveProfile(profile1, true).\nIt will trigger the mOnAccountHeaderListener.onProfileChanged\n. @christiandennis did you try it with the boolean? for me it's working\n. @christiandennis yes that's true as long as you are switched to the profiles view you can't change the selection fro the other view. \nwhy the accountheader opens is strange. should not happen. but yeah there's the option to toggle the header drop down: toggleSelectionList()\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/SimpleCompactHeaderDrawerActivity.java\n. @rpalsaxena no support for eclipse\n. You can look at the PrimaryDrawerItem. (For a custom drawerItem you can use it's source as base)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/PrimaryDrawerItem.java\nand at it's layout\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml\nJust create a layout and the item in your project and use it ;)\n. @vanza you can't update the ui from a thread. just from the ui/main thread\n. as long as you update the ui via the main thread it is ok. \n. @macaronlover as @deinok already noted yes it is possible to have the drawer in a fragment, it is also possible to have the drawer in the activity (which is recommended) and you manage it via the fragment. \nThere are enough resources available, how you can access stuff from the activtiy, on stackoverflow as this is a basic question for beginners.\nJust search for it. you will find enough answers, as this is not a MaterialDrawer specific issue. \nthanks\n. What was the issue?\n. @marinica94 ah ok. so it was a problem with the methods count and incompatible support libs\n. No problem\n. @bachhuberdesign this issue is fixed (as far as i remember) on v4.0.0 which will be available soon. Thanks for the error report\n. @artemkutukov thank you so much ;)\n. @markdwags you have to notify the drawer that the item was updated, so it can handle the changes:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L443\nnote that this require an identifier on the items\n. @Mikhail-dev my library does not overwrite any attributes from other libs. the attributes are prefixed\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml#L22\n. @patelakshay13890 this is not a MaterialDrawer specific question. Please use Google / StackOverflow to find the answer. \nI think there is some method on the toolbar to enable the icon to be shown.\n. @gpulido great that you try to go with the second solution as it would be bad to have many fragments containing the drawer. it's just not efficient. \nJust looked at the code, and i think it's possible to add this method ;). Expect it in v4.0.0\n. @gpulido you can pre test the latest v4.0.0 here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/487\nit is a heavy refactor too ;)\nIt already contains the method you need\n. Changing the hamburger to arrow and back is shown in the ComplexHeaderActivity\n. @gpulido with v4.0.0 rc2 i switched to the updated Android-Iconics which split up into core and main package. You just have to provide the main android-iconics dependency which include the GoogleMaterial font ;).\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/tree/develop#include-in-your-project\nThis has a great advantage as it will minimize the size of the MaterialDrawer by 250kb as i was able to remove all unused icons and just provide an Custom MaterialDrawer font with only the 3 icons i use ;)\n. @mdalikazi the main issue here is that it is not recommend to access activity methods or fields statically, because this could lead to context leaks. \nOtherwise the part with setting the toolbar is fine \n. @mdalikazi the main issue here is that it is not recommend to access activity methods or fields statically, because this could lead to context leaks. \nOtherwise the part with setting the toolbar is fine \n. @mychaelgo there will be a huge update v4.0.0 which will fix this. \n. For v4.0.0 it works. And i remember that it also worked vor v3.1.2. not sure what goes wrong for you. the same code runs on api 21?\n\n. @Reidy1994 then the problem is that your header takes all the space. i would recommend that you define a fixed height for it\n. There were already a few questions about it. see the previous answers: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=expandable\nThere was also some discussion over at gitter about this. and inside some issues. I think you can get a similar behavior by listening for a click, if it happens the first time add the items after this item. else remove them again\n. @Watsonibm facebook has nothing to do with this project. Here is the information what you have to do to load an image from a url into the AccountHeader's profile:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\n. @dominicsavb you have set a sectionDrawerItem as first element which has a padding on top of the divider. you can either deactivate the divider for it. But the recommended solution is to remove this sectionDrawerItem as it is obsolete and the user already sees that he is within a menu\n. you can open the drawer with. drawer.openDrawer() and close it with drawer.closeDrawer() and check if it is open with drawer.isDrawerOpen() (probably a bit different named, i just write it without looking at the code)\nthe whole thing is nothing MaterialDrawer specific. Just normal Android + DrawerLayout ;) \n. @aeroperf from which version did you update? to v3.1.2?\n. withCustomView is not working for you?\nYou use the DrawerBuilder to create the drawer?\n. @aeroperf just as a quick info. if you are currently updating. you probably should wait for v4.0.0 which will land today. \n. @aeroperf i think this method is not shown in the docs as it is a really advanced usage. Always hoping for devs to check the source ;). But great that i was able to help. \nv4.0.0 will come with a RecyclerView, just in case you use this method for this. \nabout .append() this is only used now to add a second slider on the other side\n. @aeroperf thank you so much ;)\n. @EpsilonOrionis v4.0.0 uses the latest v23 of the support libs. If you use older support libs or any libs which target older version you should update (or exclude the older dependencies)\n. @EpsilonOrionis ah i think i know what's the problem. The latest support libs 23 also require the newest build tools 23 and target 23. And i'm not sure if it also requires the gradle build tools 1.3\n. ``` gradle\ncompileSdkVersion 23\nbuildToolsVersion \"23\"\n//not sure if this one is required too\ntargetSdkVersion 23\n//and i'm also not sure about the gradle build tools\nclasspath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.0'\n```\n. Please read the Readme. There is an information about selection an item. Also look at the sample app. \n. Because I implemented this behavior. You can implement any other behavior. No limitations. \nThe is a section on the Readme how you can select an item programmatically \n. Can you try to add mavenCentral() as dependency repository? \n. And you updated to the latest v23 build tools and target sdk version and 1.3 gradle build tools? \n. @bzkdjc can you please zip and send me the small sample app you've created. i hope it will also fail with the same exception on my system. \n. @bzkdjc do you want to know something. it showed the same issue for me. \nafter that i added \ngradle\n    compile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:1.2.0.1@aar'\nin addition to \ngradle\n    compile 'com.mikepenz:fontawesome-typeface:4.4.0.1@aar'\nand it worked. \nSo i removed \ngradle\n    compile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:1.2.0.1@aar'\nagain. but it still works. do not ask my what gradle does here, or why it has troubles first and then it doesn't but yeah. \n. @alejandroluengo you also haven mavenCentral()?\n. @hectorggp but your gradle output shows that it is not searching online\n. @hectorggp ok great\n. @vasiledoe no not at the moment https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/372\n. @Dokuzov theoretically it is possible, but has big disadvantages. You would not be able to use a switch to handle the listeners and so on. also it is really hard to change the logic now, as everything (also the apps of others) depend on the identifier being an int \nWhat would be possible in your case is, give those items an identifier you can use to modify them later and define a Tag. You can choose any object as Tag and you can check this Tag in the callbacks then?\nSee the Tagable Interface (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/interfaces/Tagable.java) which the ProfileDrawerItem implements via the AbstractDrawerItem\n. @Dokuzov great :+1: \n. @Dokuzov great :+1: \n. @echthard thanks for answering. \n. @echthard thanks for answering. \n. @AngleV does your header layout have a defined height?\nThe MultiDrawerActivity also has a Header like yours and it's working in that example\n. @AngleV does your header layout have a defined height?\nThe MultiDrawerActivity also has a Header like yours and it's working in that example\n. @AngleV can you wrap it inside another layout (LinearLayout this can be match_parent, wrap_content). seems like the RecyclerView breaks the height\nthe StickyHeader and StickyFooter work different.

Else you have to use a version prior v4. \n. @simonckenyon it will work with previous versions but you have to explicitly exclude the v23 support dependencies of the MaterialDrawer (and the sub libs) \n. gradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.0.1@aar') {\n        transitive = true\n        exclude group: 'com.android.support'\n}\ni think something like this should do the job\n. @jansallads at the moment it has a fixed size. you will be only able to make it slimmer by overwriting the dimens attributes i have set\n. @jansallads you can define the dimen attributes in your project inside a dimens.xml and overwrite those values. (you can do the same for the layouts of the lib)\n. @jansallads you will also have to modify the material_drawer_item_mini.xml and material_drawer_item_mini_profile.xml as those are also have the defined width\n. @jansallads correct ;). Also do not miss this one: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MiniDrawerActivity.java#L149\n. :+1: i try my best\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/579\n. @FWest98 thank you. looks good\n. @livotov seems to be an exception. will take a look at it later today. I assume that i try to use the Context which is available during the build process, but not after it was builded. \n. withOnDrawerListener\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1185\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1229\n- defines the callbacks for open/close/slide of the drawer (if you implement it the listener should speak by itself :D)\nwithOnDrawerItemClickListener\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1522\n- Gets called when an item is clicked\nwithOnDrawerItemSelectedListener\nis not used anymore. and i will delete it. totally forgot that one during the refactoring\n. @Grozny no. just if you force it  https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#selecting-an-item\n. @mdhrchi you can theoretically modify a items view via the PostOnBindViewListener\nset it with withPostOnBindViewListener\nThere is no direct way to set the typeface, and i won't add it. as the default font is correct (as of the Android-GuideLines)\nAn alternative solution would be that you create your own CustomDrawerItems\n. @ProgrammerBassam what do you want to achieve?\n. @ProgrammerBassam i just published an update to the Crossfader library which is used to do the animation from mini to the normal drawer. it currently syncs to mavencentral so it will be available in the next 30 minutes. This update will improve the RTL feature. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/releases\n. @ProgrammerBassam as i understood your screenshorts correctly you use the MiniDrawer as shown in the MiniDrawerActivity (of the sample) this one uses the Crossfader library to do the crossfade effect. \n. @fernandodeveloper someone else already had the same issue. but i was not able to find out what's failing :/. It started working without any changes\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/574\n. @fernandodeveloper exact the same output. \nwould it build with the GoogleMaterial dependency alone?\n. @fernandodeveloper found the issues. and now i know why it only happens for some people.\nThe difference between my gradle and dependencies and yours is that i always add @aar for Android libs. This (i believe) tells gradle to handle the dependency a bit different. (if i'm correct it sets transitive: false in the background) (so it is working for most people as it is also written with @aar in the readme)\nSo you now have to options. either you add @aar add the end of the typeface dependencies like this:\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:1.2.0.1@aar')\ncompile('com.mikepenz:fontawesome-typeface:4.4.0.1@aar')\nor you add transitive: false like in this sample:\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:1.2.0.1') {\n        transitive = false\n}\ncompile('com.mikepenz:fontawesome-typeface:4.4.0.1') {\n        transitive = false\n}\n. @AngleV if you really need this you can either implement your own CustomDrawerItem which supports this. Or you overwrite the layout of the PrimaryDrawerItem and define a font for your badge (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml#L67)\n. copy and paste the layout and modify it to your needs (keep the name the same)\n(if you do this, make sure to update it on your side if there are changes in the future)\n. @AngleV you still have access to the soruce via github. \nthe build will then just use the layout of your project as it has the same ID\n. @ProgrammerBassam no shadow :P \n. @ProgrammerBassam there is now a new API on the MiniDrawer to enable RTL mode. (for the shadow to be on the other side)\n. @singhdd93 yeah it needs it because of the latest appcompat libs from google. Will add it\n. Added to the migration guide\n. what should be closed and restarted? \ni have activities in the sample?\n. @rajazeeshanahmed this is nothing MaterialDrawer specific then. This is normal android activity / navigation handling\n. @bohoffi this can be done by the dev who's implementing it. the MiniDrawer and normal Drawer are not linked together very deep. Their connection happens via the public useable APIs and listeners. So if you would love this, use the RecyclerView of the MiniDrawer and the one from the Drawer and listen to the scroll. Make also sure that the height is different as the MiniDrawer just shows PrimaryDrawerItems and also has a different header. \n. you use the newest build tools, newest gradle plugin, compile sdk 23? You cleaned the project?\n. Clean / Resync / Rebuild did not help?\n. @mychaelgo oops the\nexclude group: 'com.mikepenz'\nis the problem. as it also removes a dependency which is required. (https://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize)\nIf you add:\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialize:0.2.0@aar')\nit will work. \nElse you can modify the exclude to just exclude the Android-Iconics Dependency\n. @singhdd93 oops. thanks ;)\n. @NorbertSzydlowski you can also just copy and paste the original xml (with the same name) into your project and it will use this one then (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml)\nOr you implement a complete CustomDrawerItem \nThe method is the same (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/PrimaryDrawerItem.java#L103)\n. ah i hate this api level. it simply breaks the padding somehow. will look at it\n. @mychaelgo the layout was completely redone with v4.0.0 and yeah this is probably the root cause for this\n. @mychaelgo fixed in v4.0.3\n. This is the layout for the header: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml\nIf you want a different layout it requires to have the same elements. so not all can be changed. if you want a completely different layout you will have to create your own header \n. @ersen-osman no this is not possible. \nThis means you will have to create a completely own headerview. etc... this will require you to redo the whole logic done in the AccountHeader i assume that's not what you want.\n. Sorry that this can't easily be done.\nYou can hide the material_drawer_account_header_text_switcher but you can't change to a different circleImageView \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/579\n. @AngleV how does the image you set look like?\n. @AngleV how does the image you set look like?\n. i assume that happens because you share the same drawable for all your badges. and if one is transformed wrong the others will too. i am sorry, but this isn't MaterialDrawer specific. i think this does not happen with the original Badge. which will also allow you to have it completely round. \n. i assume that happens because you share the same drawable for all your badges. and if one is transformed wrong the others will too. i am sorry, but this isn't MaterialDrawer specific. i think this does not happen with the original Badge. which will also allow you to have it completely round. \n.

This will overwrite the circle effect for all images. \nfor rectangle:\nxml\n<shape xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:shape=\"rectangle\">\n    <solid android:color=\"#000\" />\n</shape>\n. @Namolem as of the Material Design Guidelines they should be circle. \nYou can overwrite the material_drawer_circle_mask.xml with a rectangle mask.

(copy and paste this into your application: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml keep the name as the build will automatically overwrite the same named layout from the lib)\nthen modify this one to your needs and add this button. just make sure that you don't remove any views. you should also be carefully if you have to change the type of a view. if you have added the button you can then use the normal drawer build the header. \nthen you just get the reference to the container view of the drawer from the AccountHeader and you search for the view you have added. So you can add an onClickListener\n. @rams23 what is not working. what do you expect?\n. @rams23 you can already define a delay how long the drawer should stay open before it closes when you do expensive stuff. no need for custom handling. \nabout your code. i'm not really sure if this could actually work with the runnable below. :/ \nRegarding the listener. It should work. I also use it inside the MultiDrawerActivity and it shows up there. (you can try it in the sample app) https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java#L54\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L568\n. @MedoElkamaly there is the implementation to delay the closing of the drawer. you can also define the delay. \nIf you want it the other way around you should set the delay to 0 and then handle the delay on your own. with a handler or in a similar way\n. @FWest98 it requires the Crossfader\n- Only on tablets that's up to you, no limitation from my side.\n- you can use the Crossfader and just crossfade\n- Normal drawer still as overlay will require some custom code from your. it's possible but no default behavior\n- working with ActionbarDrawerToggle is not required from my side as you can just hook in the methods via the normal Drawer by providing a custom listener. \n. @Ne1c have you defined an identifier for the Profile? Just keep a reference to the object you pass to the AccountHeader and then change the name. and then update it via the identifier\n. First you should define an identifier for the profile. and then you can set the profile as active profile. but you can't just set a new profile as active one. see the sample app for this.\n. @simonckenyon i know. and i see that the basic documentation only contains features/stuff which i would describe as \"basic\" functionality.\nThe bad thing about this is that i spend a lot of time already implementing and fixing and answering this library, creating and keeping a documentation up 2 date would require an additional huge amount of work. \nThe main issue i do not understand is that people do not read code. I already provide a sample application which contains 70% of all features (or similar features which only differ by position or so) and people still do not try the sample app or do not read the sample app.\nAdditionally i tried to provide method names which describe what the method will do. So why don't devs just look for methods which are available? I always do this if i'm searching something. \nAs a third thing. This is open source. People can just check the source itself. Which is never a bad thing. \nYeah i know those things are no excuse that it would be easier to provide a complete documentation. But i prefer to provide a great library :D\nand sorry. i know this is no real answer to the main suggestion :D and i'm really thankful that you would help with that.\n. I've set up a new site which will host some FAQs and other resources. this can be managed and improved by all of you just by creating pull requests\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ.md\n. Colors: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#custom-colors---colorsxml\nSize: overwrite the dimension, or create a custom DrawerItem \n. @Berlon there is also a method to change the color of the description: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L37\n. @Berlon the description color should only the description text. or what do you mean? can you add a screenshot?\n. @Berlon image not working\n. @Berlon i think you should answer via github not via e-mail\n. @Berlon \njava\n.withDescriptionTextColor(Color.RED)\nwill only change the description color. \n\n. @justjanne at the moment the only solution is the following:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L186\nDynamically add and remove the sub items. \nI am working on v5.0.0 right now which will switch to the FastAdapter (https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter) as new Adapter which will provide expandable items by default. (the current beta doesn't include it yet).\n. @justjanne the first solution is performant. as the adapter will care about properly animating the new items. the v5.0.0 will more or less do the same. Telling the adapter that he has to animate the new items, which are the sub-level. The big advantage of this is that we depend on Android core apis which allow us to animate, cache items, ...\nSo v5.0.0 without the expandable items is already now in a workable state. (still in beta). My plan would be that i bring out a pretty stable version sometimes later this weekend. and a final version by the end of next week. Thats just an estimate though and i can't promise, if i can deliver if there are any problems i do not know about yet. \n. @justjanne the latest snapshot of the v5.0.0 now contains the collapsible functionality\nyou can test it here https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/920 \n. @justjanne why whould you need to use your adapter? many features only work because of the used adapter inside the Drawer\n. @justjanne could you please provide the code snippet which \"copies\" the last item of the subitems n times? \n. Perhaps related to this issue. There is a service which allows you to automatically fetch the latest javadoc from the released library versions: http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.mikepenz/materialdrawer/4.6.4 (just replace the later with the latest versoin)\n. Close as this is an always relevant topic. \n. In this repo :D in the folder app \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app\nI don't think there is a link needed :D. In this repo :D in the folder app \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app\nI don't think there is a link needed :D. @bmelnychuk have you enabled fullscreen view like shown in the fullscreen activity?\n. @bmelnychuk there is now a new method to handle this\nwithSystemUIHidden(true)\n. there will be a new v4.0.8 with a new api method to remove the shadow\n. @jacobhub you can do this. But you will have to handle the logic for the ActionBarDrawerToggle on your side. \n. You will have to add the ActionBarDrawerToggle to the toolbar and hook to it with listeners. I do not know exactly if this works because this is out of scope of this library. \n. @jacobhub makes sense that the result.getDrawerLayout() returns null as there is no DrawerLayout in this case. we only create the view and display it with the Crossfader \nI assume you have to go with something like this: https://github.com/balysv/material-menu\nYou are right ActionBarDrawerToggle is just used with a DrawerLayout \n. Ah i see the issue only happens if you rotate the screen but you had opened the account list\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#add-profiles-and-an-accountheader\nThis will be triggered when a new profile is selected\njava\n.withOnAccountHeaderListener(new AccountHeader.OnAccountHeaderListener() {\n        @Override\n        public boolean onProfileChanged(View view, IProfile profile, boolean currentProfile) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    })\n. no problem ;)\n. @fernandodeveloper the version of the example is never outdated :D as the sample app is kept in sync with the newest MaterialDrawer version.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MiniDrawerActivity.java\n. @fernandodeveloper v23.0.1 is already on the stable version\n. ok great\n. @RubenGees which version do you use?\n. @RubenGees ok can't support versions prior to the most up 2 date version. :)\n. haha you update my own library in my library :D seems wrong \n. @zed13 yes you are right. this happens because i do not set the Visibility to visible back. thanks for the report\n. @danielgomezrico you add a list of new items to the drawer after it was created. i assume this is the default behavior of a RecyclerView when you are at the bottom and add new items. makes somehow sense :D \nI recommend you that you get the  RecyclerView from the result object and just scroll to top. \n. @Saime1942 what do you mean with fade out? if you want drawables to be tinted you have to activate this with withIconTintingEnabled(true) or you provide a colored icon\n. @mooncafes you also have to provide the height to the header, otherwise it will calculate the correct height for a normal header.\nyou can use this method withHeightDp\n. @biokys you must not call .build() more than once in an activity. just one time during creation of the view. afterwards you should modify the items of the Drawer object you retrieve from the .build() method. please see the README for more details\n. @seba123neo i know that this does not work, but the states which i use to keep the selection does not exist with API 10. As i am thinking of moving up to API 14+ it was fine for me ignoring this case as 10+ isn't as popular anymore. everything else is working. \nIf you have an easy fix without breaking all the great things for 14+ let me know ;)\n. @AngleV do you have any big ressources in your drawer or images?\n. @AngleV no seems small enough\n. @AngleV yeah as mentiond the images is small enough. i will have to do some tests what could cause this on your side. You use Iconics Drawables or normal drawables as icons?\n. With some more debugging the only cause i've found for this is, when using many different types of DrawerItems so it can't use the ViewHolder pattern very effectively. The longer the list, the more different items the slower it will get on the first scroll as it has to create all different types of views. after this it can reuse those. \nSo i can't do anything about this. the only thing i found which (perhaps) somehow improves is to call invalidate after creating the AccountHeader, but this won't resolve everything. \nWhat's your usecase? How many different (in terms of type (Primary, Secondary, Divider, ...) DrawerItems to you have? \n. Thanks ;). \n. @AngleV i just updated to v4.1.1 please also update to this version.\nthe \njava\nsetHasStableIds(true)\ni added to the adapter is causing some troubles. i removed it again. the lag is still fixed with the cache.\n. @nalmada what's the size (resolution) of that image? where do you load it from?\n. @nalmada try to change to a .jpg. Loaded from res should be fine\n. I can't give support for the ActionBarDrawerToggle as this is android specific and not MaterialDrawer specific. but i think you should be able to find everything you need in the sample applicaitons -> CustomContainerActivity \n. http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html\n. @zatziky you mean the drawer below the ActionBar / Toolbar?\nSee the sample application. There is the CustomContainerActivity\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\n. it will produce the following:\n\n. @alorma you mean withEnable should also disable the switch? \n. @TheLoyalCruel either you create your own custom DrawerItem, or you overwrite the xml layout (if it's just about the style) or you hook in an OnPostBindView listener to modify the created view via the withPostOnBindViewListener method. \n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32402939/error-in-resolving-dependecies-while-using-mikepenz-materialdrawer-library\n. @AngleV thanks for helping. \n@davix10 this is only handled when using a Toolbar, if you do not use one please look up google for a general description on how you can achieve this with a DrawerLayout. \nas far as i have found the ActionBarDrawerToggle can only be used with Toolbars\n. @davix10 you can as mentioned. but not via the ActionBarDrawerToggle\nTake a closer look in the ActionBarActvitiy of the sample app. i think you can modify this by changing one of those two lines\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ActionBarDrawerActivity.java#L57\nBut i highly recommend that you switch to a Toolbar it's better and allows you so much more flexibility, and it is implemented within 5 minutes\n. No toolbar is compatible down to API 7. The MaterialDrawer just down to API 10\n. Just look at the sample application. It's really easy \n. @VectorSmS your question does not fit into this thread. You can theoretically provide a custom layout for the header. there were already similar questions\n. Thanks for the detailed report and description. The MaterialDrawer does not overwrite the DrawerLayout so it seems to be a DrawerLayout specific issue. \nTheoretically it's possible to pass your own DrawerLayout implementation to the DrawerBuilder and use this one. Note the provided layout must follow the same structure as the MaterialDrawer intern one. \n. You can have your custom behavior for opening closing too. So no limitations to modify this. \n. @ray1984 ok good that it's working for you now. \n. @softweng http://stackoverflow.com/a/31053201/325479\n. @deviltsw you can either overwrite the colors via xml or you define the selected color of the DrawerItem\nuse withTextColor in addition to withSelectedTextColor internally it handles the color via an ColorStateList \n. ah you mean if you press on it. not when you select it. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=expandable\n. @yodeski yes it is possible. and i think someone already did such a heavy modification. but it will require you to hook in a bit more deeply into the MaterialDrawer as this is not as defined by the Material Design Guidlines\n. @schaal it is possible to use CustomDrawerItems. The suggested implementation is to create a CustomMiniDrawer which will overwrite generateMiniDrawerItem and getMiniDrawerType \nAs shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/8deedf8470f19c74ed6b826fd5aadc4eaed506da\nYou can then provide any CustomMiniDrawerItem for any other CustomDrawerItem \n. @schaal it requires you to write a few lines yes. but not to many ;).\nThere's even a sample which showcases this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerItems/CustomUrlBasePrimaryDrawerItem.java\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerItems/CustomUrlPrimaryDrawerItem.java\n. great ;)\n. ;) no problem. \n. @Fuzzyma what do you want to do with a different adapter?\n. @Fuzzyma no this is not possible. You can have a method which reads in the array and fills the drawer with items. no custom adapter is required for this. there are many tutorials on the web which show how to read in an string array ressource. then iterate over it and create DrawerItems afterwards you can simply  add them to the drawer. \n. no problem ;) great that you got it working\n. @KeizerDev you should use the identifier to then detect which item was used. \nsee the sample code how this is done:\nan item with identifier: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L114\ndepending on the identifier it launches an activity\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L149\n. ;) no problem\n. @lectricas you have defined an identifier for the ProfileDrawerItem?\nThen you can just use the reference of your ProfileDrawerItem to update it with the updateProfile method\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L188\n. @lectricas you can build the header and drawer as shown here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CompactHeaderDrawerActivity.java\nAnd then you can use the result object you get from the AccountHeaderBuilder and update items at a later time. \nheaderResult: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CompactHeaderDrawerActivity.java#L55 \nat a later time you can use a profile you have set:\njava\nprofile.withName(\"newName\");\nheaderResult.updateProfile(profile);\n(make sure your profile defines an identifier)\n. This one also shows how it's done: http://codeshare.io/Nc6rK (line 166)\n. @zatziky you want to change an icon of a DrawerItem? \nOnly your MainFragment has the drawer? \nThe code how you update the item is correct. Your item also has an identifier set?\n. Take a look at the AdvancedActivity of the sample app. This one allows you to programmatically switch between hamburger and arrow icon. When the arrow is shown it will navigate back from this activity. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java\n. @ovestoerholt yeah but the sample also navigates up (you could overwrite this) with the back arrow. Have you tried the sample on your device?\n. No problem;) I hope it helps\n. @outlying if specific items are not selectable just set them as withSelectable(false)\nShown in the sample app:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L114\n. Great ;)\n. @ArcanusEternal you can either do it as shown in the following sample activity:\nThis uses a different container, but is the preferred implementation for this use-case (normally this should not be done)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\n(not sure why you don't want this?)\nYou can also go with an old ActionBar as this does not allow you to have the drawer on top of it:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ActionBarActivity.java\nYou can also look at the sample which implements the drawer inside of fragments. This sample also has the drawer below the toolbar. (but it would also allow it to have it on top of it...)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/FragmentActivity.java\n. @TomasValenta not out of the box. you would have to implement a CustomDrawerItem providing this element. \nYou can use an existing DrawerItem as base. \nHere's an info how you can do this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31030595/how-to-customize-the-draweritem-using-the-lib-mikepenz-materialdrawer\n. I assume you are searching for the withSelectable() method you can set on an DrawerItem it is used in the sample application ;)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L114\nBest,\nMike\n. @chteuchteu it's shown in the sample application, but yeah you can also add it to the documentation ;)\n. thanks\n. @suleymanccelik a CollapsingToolbar sample is also in the sample application.\n. @suleymanccelik you sent me an e-mail with the source right? i will take a look later today / or this week. \n. @RWiggers can you be a bit more specific. You have a SecondaryDrawerItem with an Drawable icon? This will not tint? You have to enable tinting for those: withIconTintingEnabled(true)\n. @RWiggers there's nothing like material_drawer_secondary_icon as google's guidelines state the same color for them. you can overwrite the color for a specific DrawerItem with \njava\nwithIconColor()\n. @dmitrykolesnikovich you do not use the maven dependency?\ndo you compile with sdk 23?\nlatest build tools?\n. @dmitrykolesnikovich the latest project is always only compileable with the latest sdk version. \nincluded the latest support libs.\nand you really should use them via their gradle dependency\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#-v400\n. the whole repo can be imported into Android Studio and it will work. Probably you have set it up wrong and so it misses the sub dependencies like:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize\n. @leijdekkers the withSelectedIconColor will change the color of the selected icon as for all other drawer items. There is no method to do so via code. I think you can in general change the color of the switch via theme, else you can create a customDrawerItem, or you hook in with a onPostBindView listener and change it then. \n. @leijdekkers you can add it on your own. Just create your own CustomDrawerItem (CustomSwitchDrawerItem) and add this method. \nYou can see a similar example here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerItems/CustomPrimaryDrawerItem.java\n. @leijdekkers once again. the above is just a sample how you can create a CustomDrawerItem you will have to write 4 lines of code on your own for your purpose\n. java\nSwitchCompat switch = (SwitchCompat) holder.itemView.findViewById(R.id.material_drawer_switch)\n. @adennie no sorry this is not in. you can do a pull request if you like to add it ;)\n. @timrae i will remove the selected background completely as shown in the following screenshot by google:\nhttps://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bx4BSt6jniD7ZVZzVEhrbF9YWk0/patterns_navdrawer_behavior_persistent4.png\n. I think you miss the sub dependencies. Have you set up everything as described in the readme:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#1-provide-the-gradle-dependency\n. @timrae setFullscreen won't bring the app in immersive mode. It will just remove the paddings and the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout functionality from the drawer. \nYou can see what happens in the FullscreenActivity\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/FullscreenDrawerActivity.java\n. @timrae ah ok i see. providing the correct theme in addition is no option in your case?\n. ah sorry\nnow i get your issue\n. Not all functions work exact the same after building the drawer. especially if you try to switch from normal to fullscreen or so. those things should be done during the view creation and not at a later time. \n. Can you recreate the activity so relaunch the activity if you switch that preference?\n. @timrae if the drawer builder has the fullscreen flag set it won't add the insets and so the toolbar will be on top. if you now get the toolbar to show the insets do not change because the drawer was set to ignore those. \nAs i moved the ui stuff to the Materialize lib. Here's the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout, which will have the insets set to 0 if the SystemUI is not visible. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialize/view/ScrimInsetsFrameLayout.java#L96\nThere is no listener which changes this. probably this is the issue?\n. @timrae you can get a reference to the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout from the drawer. and this will allow you to do this:\njava\ndrawer.getScrimInsetsFrameLayout()\n. this has a method to enable/disable the flag that the systemUI is hidden. \n. @timrae then the insets probably don't change. sorry.\n. @timrae you can use the normal drawer and add it somewhere in your layout like done here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/EmbeddedDrawerActivity.java\nor you use the same mechanism shown with the MiniDrawer sample. this also does not move over the content. \n. @timrae i just published a new version of the Crossfader library which now allows you to disable the slide functionality, and which allows you to resize the content panel instead of moving it out of the screen.\nThe function of the ActionBarDrawerToggle can be managed by you, this is not limited or hardcoded by the drawer.\nv1.1.0 of the Crossfader was just published to maven central it can take about 30 minutes to sync\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader\n. @timrae i hope you like the new added persistent drawer sample: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/PersistentDrawerActivity.java\nit showcases how to create a drawer like the one shown in the MaterialDesignGuidelines by using all the APIs the MaterialDrawer offers. It can even be used in RTL layout. \nAt the moment there are two bugs (but as this is not part of the lib but custom behavior you can achieve with the drawer it is possible to fix them without depending on the library itself):\n- on API 17 the header has a different height than the Toolbar (it is correct on API 10)\n- on API 10 the arrow to close the extended drawer is directly on the right without the padding (which is applied on higher api levels) \n. @timrae i hope you like the new added persistent drawer sample: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/PersistentDrawerActivity.java\nit showcases how to create a drawer like the one shown in the MaterialDesignGuidelines by using all the APIs the MaterialDrawer offers.

How do you check if this e-mail has a gravatar? \n. @livotov i think it is a better idea to make a separat module or addon, or probably util class instead of chaining it deeply into the MaterialDrawer as this is a really special use-case. So people can choose to have it, and it will only require a bit more code to write if they choose to. \nI don't think it's good to have it deeply integrated, but the idea of having a util which generates Gravatar urls for you is great\n. @livotov but i still think this is a really great idea. It's up to you if you want to provide it as util and add a pull request or if you create a standalone library which can then be used for any project out there ;)\n. @nasser-souti the SecondaryDrawerItem has a different height, and a smaller icon. \nTo be exact here are the dimensions of the PrimaryDrawerItem:\nheight: 48dp, icon 24dp\nThe dimensions of the SecondaryDrawerItem\nheight: 42dp, icon 18dp\nBest, \nMike\n. @nasser-souti no problem ;)\n. @TroniPM thanks for the report. This is a bug and will be fixed in v4.3.3\n. I think you miss this step:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\nOr shown here in the sample app:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L18\n. @toyongbanatero no problem ;)\n. @ray1984 ok if the KeyboardUtil does not help in your case, it seems the only solution is that you disable fullscreen (so translucent statusbar) at all. theme etc. and have a drawer which is below the StatusBar as the fullscreen flag causes this problem.\n. @ray1984 it would be great if you could provide a sample showcasing this issue. perhaps i can improve the KeyboardUtil\n. @ray1984 the demonstration project would help me best. so i can reproduce it and test a few things why this could happen\n. @ray1984 i don't think those two things are the same. i will take a look later\n. @ray1984 I am not really sure what you want to show with your sample. why do you provide the DrawerLayout including the slide container and the drawer content for tablet, and not for the phone. what's the purpose of this?\n. @ray1984 but the MaterialDrawer already manages the DrawerLayout for you, so no need to add it to the xml?\nThe latest screenshot also looks like that you will need 2 different DrawerLayouts as the right drawer is fullscreen and the left one is below the Toolbar\n. @ray1984 yeah there are so many combinations on how to setup the drawer. :D it is very flexible and i can't prevent wrong usage in all areas :D\nGreat that you got it working ;)\n. @roshu10 yes makes sense. \nYou add the drawer within the FrameLayout with id main .withRootView(R.id.main). \nBut then you replace the content of the FrameLayout with id main (including the drawer which is also within this layout) fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main, new FirstFragment()); \nSo you remove the DrawerLayout again and replace it with your fragment. \nI think your FragmentManager should replace the contents of the FrameLayout with the id frame_container fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id. frame_container, new FirstFragment());\n.  https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries\n. @lalkrishna i don't think the theme manager is a good reference on how it will look on the device as there happens enough stuff programmatically which can't be shown with the Design section in Android Studio. \nHow have you set up your drawer? \nYou can check and see a simple usage of the Drawer here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java\nYou can also install the demo app which is available via the releases section:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/releases\n. @lalkrishna do you have an ActionBar or Toolbar? \nTheme for Toolbar has to be applied separately as shown in the sample:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_dark_toolbar.xml#L12\n. Your actionBar uses the android:background=\"?attr/colorPrimary\" color\n. @lalkrishna as the Toolbar is nothing MaterialDrawer specific it's up to you. But with this line you set the color to the colorPrimary not to colorPrimaryDark\n. State save is shown in the sample app \n. see here:\nwithSavedInstance\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L190\nonSaveInstance\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L224\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java#L161\n. ok use this one\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L188\n. java\ndrawerBuilder.withHasStableIds(true)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L111\nThe animation will be shown trough the DefaultItemAnimator which is automatically set on the RecyclerView when the RecyclerView has the setHasStableIds(true) set. which can be done when you build the MaterialDrawer with .withHasStableIds(true) \n. :stuck_out_tongue: \n. @dominicsavb set it to null\n. can't you use withBadge((String)null)\n. @dominicsavb you will have to implement a CustomDrawerItem (or you hook in with a onPostBindView listener and modify the view)\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/32542999/325479\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/32543209/325479\n. The source of the ToggleDrawerItem can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ToggleDrawerItem.java\nthe easiest solution for you is to copy this. add it to your project and modify it to your needs\n. @dominicsavb this method changes the badge with the identifier 5 not the badge at position 5. You have to define identifiers for your drawerItems and then you can use those methods.\n. I will close this for now. Please get in touch again with more details. And probably a demo app which showcases your above issue so i can debug and fix it\n. @zaclimon thanks for adding your solution here\n. @zaclimon and what is against doing the ActionBarDrawerToggle on your own? Just don't provide the Toolbar create your ActionBarDrawerToggle get the DrawerLayout from the Drawer and you can have your custom behavior as you need it?\n. @zaclimon ah ok. :D \nNo problem. I tried to do my best to make default behavior as easy to use as possible, and if custom behavior is required to make it really flexible so everything is possible. \nNo problem ;)\n. @patelakshay13890 in fact those two methods are the most important for switching the drawer content:\n``` java\n/*\n     * onSelectionClickListener to notify the onClick on the checkbox\n     /\n    private View.OnClickListener onSelectionClickListener = new View.OnClickListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View v) {\n            boolean consumed = false;\n            if (mOnAccountHeaderSelectionViewClickListener != null) {\n                consumed = mOnAccountHeaderSelectionViewClickListener.onClick(v, (IProfile) v.getTag(R.id.material_drawer_profile_header));\n            }\n        if (mAccountSwitcherArrow.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE && !consumed) {\n            toggleSelectionList(v.getContext());\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n/**\n * helper method to toggle the collection\n *\n * @param ctx\n */\nprotected void toggleSelectionList(Context ctx) {\n    if (mDrawer != null) {\n        //if we already show the list. reset everything instead\n        if (mDrawer.switchedDrawerContent()) {\n            resetDrawerContent(ctx);\n            mSelectionListShown = false;\n        } else {\n            //build and set the drawer selection list\n            buildDrawerSelectionList();\n\n            // update the arrow image within the drawer\n            mAccountSwitcherArrow.setImageDrawable(new IconicsDrawable(ctx, MaterialDrawerFont.Icon.mdf_arrow_drop_up).sizeRes(R.dimen.material_drawer_account_header_dropdown).paddingRes(R.dimen.material_drawer_account_header_dropdown_padding).color(ColorHolder.color(mTextColor, ctx, R.attr.material_drawer_header_selection_text, R.color.material_drawer_header_selection_text)));\n            mSelectionListShown = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L1163\n. @patelakshay13890 if you need more help let me know ;)\n. @patelakshay13890 custom layout for sliding content?\nPerhaps you should add designs or images what you want to achieve\n. @patelakshay13890 custom layout for sliding content?\nPerhaps you should add designs or images what you want to achieve\n. @patelakshay13890 please provide a screenshot or anything. \nUsing a custom layout is shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/PersistentDrawerActivity.java#L69\nIt also has a custom action on a view which is inside this layout and not handled by the drawer:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/PersistentDrawerActivity.java#L125\n. @patelakshay13890 please provide a screenshot or anything. \nUsing a custom layout is shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/PersistentDrawerActivity.java#L69\nIt also has a custom action on a view which is inside this layout and not handled by the drawer:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/PersistentDrawerActivity.java#L125\n. @patelakshay13890 your description is not clear enough. please post a wireframe or screenshot or design or anything which showcases what you want to achieve. \n. @patelakshay13890 your description is not clear enough. please post a wireframe or screenshot or design or anything which showcases what you want to achieve. \n. @patelakshay13890 i think your answer went wrong. no content\n. @patelakshay13890 i think your answer went wrong. no content\n. @patelakshay13890 i have to repeat it one last time.

Or you want no content in the accountheader at all?\n. @TYZRPVX then just provide your own header? no need to use the AccountHeader\n. @localhostEU you mean to the view of a specific DrawerItem? \nNo as the items and views are within a RecyclerView and the views are re-used. That means you there is no guarantee that a specific view is currently available, and not reused for a different DrawerItem\nWhat do you need it for?\n. @localhostEU haha :D\nyou still talk about DrawerItems right?\nYou can theoretically get the reference to the RecyclerView and then iterate over the child views of this RecyclerView. If the DrawerItems were already added and are visible you will then get a few childs. Those have a Tag or Identifier set on their view. \nThe code which sets the Id, and Tag on the itemView of the DrawerItem \nviewHolder.itemView.setId(getIdentifier());\nviewHolder.itemView.setTag(this);\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L64\nI just want to repeat it once again. It is a RecyclerView and this will recycle views ;). So if you scroll and the item you want to highlight moves out of focus it will be recycled and you will not be able to find it via the child view logic. And so there is no secure solution to always get the view via the RecyclerView  (also make sure that the items were initialized and are visible already)\nThe whole thing will probably work for a Drawer as this does not contain many items, and in most cases it is also not scrollable, but just keep the above in mind ;)\n. @localhostEU ok great ;)\n. @Axxium i see that you use the position to select the active profile. Is it also your identifier of those items?\nthe setActiveProfile method takes an identifier as argument. not the position:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L151\nThere is no method to define those things via position\n. @Axxium yes it should.\nwhen selecting that item. is the account selection opened? \n. yeah the drawer and the account selection. (so it shows the accounts in the drawer instead of the normal draweritems?)\n. yeah the screenshot does only show the problem :D but it can not show how it came to the problem. \nI will test and debug later. i think i just do not set the selection in the drawer. should be a quick fix. I'll comment here later\n. a quick solution (until i have released the new version) for you would be something like this:\njava\nif (mMenuHeader.isSelectionListShown()) {\n   mDrawer.setSelection(profile.getIdentifier(), false);\n}\n. a quick solution (until i have released the new version) for you would be something like this:\njava\nif (mMenuHeader.isSelectionListShown()) {\n   mDrawer.setSelection(profile.getIdentifier(), false);\n}\n. @grote let me assume you have not notified the drawer about the updated item.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. @grote let me assume you have not notified the drawer about the updated item.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. @grote great :). thank you so much\n. @grote great :). thank you so much\n. @GreenSkinMonster will test later today.

I've added a new simple method for this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L89\n. @androideveloper ah i see. i will allow you to define a completely custom onClick behavior in the next version\n. @androideveloper https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L150\n. @angelpinheiro if you want disable the managed padding on top and be able to manage this on your own look at this sample:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/FullscreenDrawerActivity.java\nShould allow you what you try to achieve\n. @angelpinheiro great ;)\n. This can be done by setting a BadgeStyle as done in the DrawerActivity\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L117\n. @EpsilonOrionis you also have to notify the MiniDrawer that the specific item was updated.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L262\nI know that those calls could be eliminated if i would integrate the MiniDrawer into the Drawer itself, but i made the decision to keep both standalone without any links to the other, so both can be used without the other (the MiniDrawer only uses the Drawer as data source) \n. So the above solved your problem? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \n. Haha. Just to make sure :D I remember that i had false answers already too :D\nHave a nice evening. \nBest,\nMike\n. @androideveloper this is no MaterialDrawer issue. It is the behavior of the SlidingPaneLayout which is used inside the CrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/crossfader/view/CrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout.java\nPlease open the issue over there. Not yet sure if this can be easily achieved. as the touch event is consumed by the SlidingPaneLayout already\n. As of the Google Material Design Guidelines which are my book for everything :stuck_out_tongue: this line is defined there:\nhttps://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/navigation-drawer.html#navigation-drawer-specs\nInteresting enough (as i've just checked) the line only is used for solid headers and not in addition to an image. \nwill take a second look later today\n. @timrae you can disable this line with withDividerBelowHeader(false) on the header. will change the default to false, so people who use images (which is the most common) have the right design by default. \nthanks\n. @timrae oh sorry. i was not on my pc when answering. you are right this method is used to remove the padding. sorry. will add a new method so you can control both. padding and divider. \n. it's in v4.4.3 ;)\n. @timrae right\n. @timrae you can do the following and exclude appcompat dependency from my lib:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/587#issuecomment-135148406\n. @afeozzz nothing i can fix. If you provide a custom header only the view you provide is used. \nIf you set a layout as header it will be wrapped into a ContainerDrawerItem and added to the list on the first position so it will work as any list item. \nThe layout which will contain yours is a normal LinearLayout with width MATCH_PARENT and height WRAP_CONTENT\n. @couchcrew-thomas as mentioned in the previous answer. That's the way the RecyclerView from Android handles the items. If you wrap the whole thing in a LinearLayout with a specific height it should work\n. @patelakshay13890 this is nothing which is handled or specific to the MaterialDrawer ;). \n. @Grountex the shadow is as defined in the Google Material Design Guidelines. \nIf you really want to remove it you will have to overwrite the layout. The easiest is to copy the layout over to your project (with the same name) and just remove the elevation from the headers. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml\n. @mrneiverth what prevents you from updating to the latest version? i can help with migrating the code?\nas of the \"bug\". i think back in this version there was already some method which contained withFullscreen or withTranslucentStatusbar disable those. or search for a similar method and set it to false, the shadow is added to mimic the statusbar shadow when using fullscreen. and as your drawer is not used in fullscreen this does not have to be set\noh and thanks ;)\n. @mrneiverth great :D haha funny enough that i remember the methods back then :D\nthanks ;)\n. thank you so much for the pull request. \n. @yuri4031 the sample of the MiniDrawer does not use the ActionBarDrawerToggle as it does not use a DrawerLayout so those properties won't change anything in your case. \nThis behavior is not defined within the Drawer and i have kept it open to be defined by devs who use this pattern. I think you will have to go with a third party lib which allows you to have the animated NavigationIcon without a DrawerLayout\n. @yuri4031 great ;)\n. @lalkrishna there are no sets of items. If you have a section then just add a SectionDrawerItem\nAll default items are shown in the sample:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java\n. @Fifoxy thank you.\nI'm sorry but menu inflating or in general the Toolbar is nothing specific to the MaterialDrawer, so this issue is not caused by the drawer. \nI can only answer MaterialDrawer specific questions here\n. @Fifoxy great ;)\nthank you so much\n. @dmelechow  you can use the CompactHeader and set the first and second line of it (it does not allow you to have multiple lines of the second smaller text) and then you can listend to the whole header for a click event\n. shown in the sample: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CompactHeaderDrawerActivity.java\n. closed as this is no real issue. you can continue asking questions here. \n. @Gilb007 \n1.) You will have to create a CustomDrawerItem you can use an existing item as reference or base. \n2.) the SubHeader is called SectionDrawerItem as shown in the sample: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L129\n3.) I do not see a footer there, i just see that there are no more items and that the list background is shown\n. @Gilb007 will close as it is no issue. \nwe can continue the discussion here and i try to help ;)\n. @Gilb007 you have to implement it on your own. \n1.) There is no such element made yet as it does not follow the Material Design Guidelines. The MaterialDrawer allows you to use custom elements. \nSo you can use an existing item as base and extend it and implement the things you need, or create a new one. \n2.) No background property on this one as it does not follow the Material Design Guidelines you would have to modify this one to and add the background functionality or hard code it for your case. \nA few custom DrawerItems are here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerItems\nThe default ones are here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model\nAnd i also posted a description here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31030595/how-to-customize-the-draweritem-using-the-lib-mikepenz-materialdrawer/32542999#32542999\n. @danielgomezrico i'm just a bit confused about this. What should the DrawerImageLoader leak? \nThere is no context nor anything else it keeps. Just the implemention of the interface\nI can add the clear() method. but i do not really see what is leaked. \nProbably it is solved if you create your own DrawerImageLoaderImpl as separate class. And have no inner implementation? \n. @vd92 create a helper class and pass the activity to this method?\njava\npublic Drawer createDrawer(Activity act) {\n    ....\n}\n. @vd92 you have to pass the activity else you can't provide it to the drawer builder :P\n.

Great that you found it. ;)\n. @MFlisar if you want you can manage the ActionBarDrawerToggle completely on your own without any interaction of the MaterialDrawer just do not provide the Toolbar via the builder and create the ActionBarDrawerToggle with the DrawerLayout which you can get via the getter of the Drawer object (which is created with .build())\n. You also have synced the state\njava\nthis.mActionBarDrawerToggle.syncState();\nand set the listeners:\njava\nmActionBarDrawerToggle.setToolbarNavigationClickListener(toolbarNavigationListener);\nmDrawerLayout.setDrawerListener(mActionBarDrawerToggle);\nthe MaterialDrawer does not do so much more for you:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1319\n. @MFlisar strange enough. As mentioned if you keep the default behavior the drawer only handles this internally to simplify everything. And if you don't provide a Toolbar i will keep this open to the dev. \nYour drawer is already built at this time. So this can't be the cause\nPerhaps something from here can help as it seems to be a Toolbar + ActionBarDrawerToggle issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26863230/android-support-toolbar-actionbardrawertoggle-not-changing-to-arrow\n. @MFlisar great ;)\n. @alirezaaa if you click a profile image this won't call the withOnAccountHeaderSelectionViewClickListener() method, but the withOnAccountHeaderListener\n.

Perhaps you can provide more information so it is easier to understand why it should be a problem that it is still allowed to programmatically force a selection?\n. @EpsilonOrionis yeah and why does withSelectable(false) not work? this will then forward the click tho the Switch?\nWe can still discuss here. just close it as i do not think this is a general issue. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/CrossfadeDrawerLayout/issues/5\n. @fliespl where do you expect the two different types to show up?\n. @fliespl if you set the header as url it should load via glide yes. perhaps this is an issue\n. @fliespl you can get the reference to the header view and set it via glide then :D \n. @sinystr sorry there is no multi selection possible. \nIf you really would need something like this i would suggest that you change the background for the selected item. \n. @psamim great ;)\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/658\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/552\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/372\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/141\n. @MFlisar why do you remember the selection manually? this is already done by the drawer? \nFor the above thing. Do you have a header? the position will be +1 if there is a header\n. @MFlisar but why don't you just save the already remembered position from the drawer?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L230\nHere's the logic which saves the savedInstance:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L923\nAnd here it's loaded again:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1699\n. @MFlisar the above was only reference how it's done internally. \nAnd you are sure your item's identifier stay the same? If you do not set the identifier the drawer provides a own unique identifier (which will may be different on a new launch)\nThe code itself seems ok\n\nAs a side note you should not update an item like this:\njava\n    mDrawer.getDrawerItem(ID_PROFILES).withSelectable(true);\n    mDrawer.getAdapter().notifyItemChanged(mDrawer.getPosition(ID_PROFILES));\nthere is the following method:\njava\n   mDrawer.updateItem(mDrawer.getDrawerItem(ID_PROFILES))\n. @MFlisar strange enough. I really do not see a point why it should mess up the selection somewhere. \n. yeah but as far as you posted the code above you use the identifier. and set it again via identifier\n. @MFlisar setSelection get's the position from an identifier. So it is also identifier based, which should be fine then :/ \nProbably i can reproduce this :O and look what really happens :o\n. @Amenocy That's up to you. Nothing MaterialDrawer specific. \nSomewhere you have to keep track of the changes and in the onResume of the activities you update the drawer with the new details\nPerhaps you could change your content areas to be fragments and not different activities. \n. @alirezaaa please read the following\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/basics/activity-lifecycle/recreating.html\n. @alirezaaa i am sure that has nothing to do with the singleTop :D\nJust an assumption. You return true in the listener. \n. @somghosh not by default, but it's easy to add. \nI have added something like this to the sample app: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L186\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/830e72733f75f620fbd6efe5cb24821fbe774b6f\nFor the arrow just create a customDrawerItem which has an arrow instead of the badge on the right. \n. Take a look at the sample activity. \nThere is the FullScreenDrawerActivtiy\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/FullscreenDrawerActivity.java\nand the CollapsingToolbarActivity both show content behind the satusbar\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java\n. @AkshayChordiya if your view needs to go up completely you will have to do the things mentioned above. for the Toolbar you have to provide the padding of the StatusBar as this is the only element which moves not below the statusbar\n. @AndrazP because this is the default as of the Material Design Guidelines. \nA quick solution would be that you get the reference to the view of the Sticky Header and change the color to any color which fits your needs. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader\n. @androideveloper no it's no issue. it is simply a separat project. so if you want the Crossfader you just include the Crossfader dependency. and done. \nI have done this so i can update both separately \n. @androideveloper no this is not possible. Both libraries do not depend on each other, so this has to stay without the other. If you want it you just implement the CrossfadeWrapper and done. \n. have you defined GravityCompat.START as gravity for RTL support?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1533\n. please follow the instructions in the readme:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#1-provide-the-gradle-dependency\nif you do not add the sub dependencies it won't work\n. as you would for a normal item, just for the header. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L236\n. @royjavelosa the error is not MaterialDrawer specific. Seems like you probably use old versions of the appcompat lib in your project, or that there are other issues inside your build.gradle \n. @AlexBrechmann i tested this on even smaller devices / emulators on my pc and this issue did not happen. this only occurs when you have custom dp setting, which seems to break some internal spacings. \nYour fix checks for the screen height, but the issue happens because of the width. \nJust tried the following. If the header height is < 160dp then it changes to 160dp, but this breaks the drawer for small devices. \nThe main issue about custom dpi's is that this breaks a lot of layouts (in general)\n. @AlexBrechmann interesting. i tested all the android versions + resolutions with genymotion. perhaps the android emulators are a bit different. have to try\n. @AlexBrechmann i added an additional check and algorithm for this behavior. If the height of the header is to low to fit all the components like current selection profile view, and the text selection, it will then change the height to the min required height. this will make those items in a different ratio than 16/9 but it will fit all elements. a different solution would be to change the size of the primary selected account, so we can stay with the 16/9 ratio of the header. \nboth behaviours are not defined in the Material Design Guideliens\n. @emilhamep you do not have to call the CustomApplication. After you created the ImageLoader implementation you can simply start setting the icon via URL on the DrawerItems\n. This requires a custom drawer item. \nAn example can be found in the sample app or i also described it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31030595/how-to-customize-the-draweritem-using-the-lib-mikepenz-materialdrawer/32542999#32542999\n. @beta the color of the StatusBar gets set from the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout which comes with the drawer. there is a method which allows you to change the color: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L160\n. @beta yes. but this is required as the content moves below the StatusBar to allow the drawer to be full height. \n. @outoftrun you want a left and right drawer? and the right drawer changes depending on the current selected fragment. \nyou can just keep the reference to the right drawer and delete and re-add the items when you switch fragments\n. @deepakSP within wallsplash i do the same. depending on the profile someone selects i update the drawerItem list. \nYou can set a list of new items with this method:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L713\n. @viettanbkdn this log does not even contain the the package name of the MaterialDrawer :D Seems like a DrawerLayout issue. \nI haven't experienced something like this. Perhaps stackoverflow tells your more regarding this issue\n. @viettanbkdn yes that's true the lib adds the DrawerLayout but i can't change things of the support lib. The DrawerLayout is provided by Google. Does this issue happen each time? Or was it a one time crash?\n. @viettanbkdn you just use the DrawerLayout from the MaterialDrawer as shown in the sample app. your layout does not contain a DrawerLayout nor do you use any custom behavior?\n. @viettanbkdn ok please try it again and if it still happens post some more information .\n. @feenixspz seems like you try to do something after the activity was destroyed. make sure that you don't call any functions after the activity was destroyed\n. @drinfernoo the statusBar is managed by the drawer. you should use:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L160\n. @drinfernoo the statusBar is managed by the drawer. you should use:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L160\n. @drinfernoo for activities without the drawer you can use a theme which does not make the statusbar translucent\nxml\nMaterialDrawerTheme.Light\n. @drinfernoo for activities without the drawer you can use a theme which does not make the statusbar translucent\nxml\nMaterialDrawerTheme.Light\n. haha :trophy: \n. haha :trophy: \n. @sanalelevenstar11 can you please provide some code? \nthe sample application showcases some collapsing functionality:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L184\n. @sanalelevenstar11 can you please provide some code? \nthe sample application showcases some collapsing functionality:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L184\n. @sanalelevenstar11 you should have different variables to remember the opened state :D\n. @sanalelevenstar11 you should have different variables to remember the opened state :D\n. @sanalelevenstar11 sorry i can't provide programming tips ;).

Hi. \nThanks.\nWhat do you want to achieve? Or what is the desired result?\nBest,\nMike\n. withSliderBackgroundDrawableRes takes a resource :D no drawable\nyou solved your issue?\n. @PsyGik what do you need the tagClass for? wouldn't it be enough if the Tag equals the item.getTag()?\n. then it's in v4.5.7\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/113b922a8efb31ed5f63459e990a98e3ea770a95\n. @cryo75 if you have an ActionBar you can't use the ActionBarDrawerToggle from the Drawer you have to manage the Hamburger icon manually as you would with a normal DrawerLayout\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ActionBarActivity.java#L50\n. @cryo75 you can define a Typeface for your items. If this is not enough you will have to implement a CustomDrawerItem which allows you to modify the text appearance.\n. @fmeneuhe great ;) thanks again\n. @MohMah you should not remove a drawer. If it is deactivated for the current activity you can LOCK it. Else use the methods to update the drawers content.s\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. @MohMah what do you want to change?\nAfter you created the AccountHeader you have the AccountHeader object which allows you to add / remove / modify profiles\n. @MohMah yes you can do this. Or you update the existing one. depending what fits your needs. \nThe AccountHeader objects offers you all necessary methods to do this. \n. @bingjiang you have to remove the header from the Drawer https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L317\n. @Florent1510 thanks for the links. \nPlease open a pull request and add it at the end of the list ;)\nBest,\nMike\n. @dmelechow you will have to implement a CustomDrawerItem which allows you to set a StateListDrawable as background. This will have the default state without the yellow line, and a selected state with a drawable which contains that yellow line. \nHere's the line of code which sets a color for the normal PrimaryDrawerItem\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L82\n. There are Custom draweritems in the sample app:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems\nAnd there are also answers on stackoverflow regarding custom drawer items:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/32066618/materialdrawer-customdraweritem\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31030595/how-to-customize-the-draweritem-using-the-lib-mikepenz-materialdrawer/32542999#32542999\nAs your requirement is not a default case it needs a little bit of coding on your side. \n. @MatteCarra the problem is that we require the FULLSCREEN flag, so we can display the Drawer under the StatusBar. The Android system handles the keyboard different when the full screen flag is set \nThere were long discussions about this here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/95\nand here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/183\n. @MatteCarra yeah it is no perfect solution. It may needs adjustments in landscape mode. \nThe only really solution is that you go with a non full height drawer. which is below the statusbar\n. @MatteCarra i'm really sorry for this. I still hope someone comes up with a better solution. \nTranslucentStatusbar false, and TranslucentNavigationbar false, (yes Fullscreen false should do the job) and a normal non translucent statusbar theme\n. @MatteCarra you also disabled the keyboardutil?\n. perhaps you can open/close the keyboard when rotating?\n. The sample app includes the KeyboardUtil Drawer, try if it also occurs there. Just tried the keyboard is closed after rotation\n. @MatteCarra i will check. But the KeyboardUtil shouldn't be the problem as it is recreated after the screen is rotated. \nI am really not sure how it reacts when the keyboard keeps shown after rotation, as in landscape the editText is shown in fullscreen with the keyboard (normally)\n. So you do not recreate the activity as it is recommended? I assume you have the configChanges set in the Manifest. \nI highly recommend you to recreate the activity and remember the previous state via the savedInstanceState, as it is recommended. \n. @MatteCarra i have modified some things of the KeyboardUtil would you love to test it?\nI hope it improves the behavior on your side too\n``` java\n/\n * Copyright 2015 Mike Penz All rights reserved.\n \n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n \n *      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n \n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\npackage com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.util;\nimport android.app.Activity;\nimport android.graphics.Rect;\nimport android.os.Build;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.view.ViewTreeObserver;\nimport android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager;\n/*\n * Created by mikepenz on 14.03.15.\n * This class implements a hack to change the layout padding on bottom if the keyboard is shown\n * to allow long lists with editTextViews\n * Basic idea for this solution found here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9108219/325479\n /\npublic class KeyboardUtil {\n    private View decorView;\n    private View contentView;\npublic KeyboardUtil(Activity act, View contentView) {\n    this.decorView = act.getWindow().getDecorView();\n    this.contentView = contentView;\n\n    //only required on newer android versions. it was working on API level 19\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 19) {\n        decorView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(onGlobalLayoutListener);\n    }\n}\n\npublic void enable() {\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 19) {\n        decorView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(onGlobalLayoutListener);\n    }\n}\n\npublic void disable() {\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 19) {\n        decorView.getViewTreeObserver().removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(onGlobalLayoutListener);\n    }\n}\n\n\n//a small helper to allow showing the editText focus\nViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener onGlobalLayoutListener = new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onGlobalLayout() {\n        Rect r = new Rect();\n        //r will be populated with the coordinates of your view that area still visible.\n        decorView.getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(r);\n\n        int height = decorView.getContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics().heightPixels;\n        int bottom = r.bottom;\n\n        //if it could be a keyboard add the padding to the view\n        if (bottom - height != 0) {\n            // if the use-able screen height differs from the total screen height we assume that it shows a keyboard now\n            //check if the padding is 0 (if yes set the padding for the keyboard)\n            if (contentView.getPaddingBottom() == 0) {\n                //set the padding of the contentView for the keyboard\n                contentView.setPadding(0, 0, 0, height - bottom);\n            }\n        } else {\n            //check if the padding is != 0 (if yes reset the padding)\n            if (contentView.getPaddingBottom() != 0) {\n                //reset the padding of the contentView\n                contentView.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Helper to hide the keyboard\n *\n * @param act\n */\npublic static void hideKeyboard(Activity act) {\n    if (act != null && act.getCurrentFocus() != null) {\n        InputMethodManager inputMethodManager = (InputMethodManager) act.getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);\n        inputMethodManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow(act.getCurrentFocus().getWindowToken(), 0);\n    }\n}\n\n}\n``\n. @MatteCarra thanks i will check again. \nIn general the== 0check is made that it does not reset the padding over and over again which has a huge performance impact.

You have to handle this on your own, because anActionBarDrawerTogglerequires aDrawerLayoutbut the implementation with theMiniDrawerto normalDrawerdoesn't use aDrawerLayout` \nThere are libs out which provide a custom implementation to allow a custom NavigationIcon in the toolbar, with listeners, and animation. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDrawerItem.java#L123\nDrawerItems allow you to set the color programmatically\n. @MFlisar no problem ;)\nSmall description:\nthe DrawerBuilder just knows about the IDrawerItem interface which defines a basic drawerItem. So the DrawerBuilder does not know about the different features of the drawerItems. Everything is really really flexible and can be easily extended for custom requirements ;) \n. @viettanbkdn your application has internet permission?\n- hide smal avatars:\n  There is a property to just show the primary account\njava\nwithOnlyMainProfileImageVisible()\n- show other image in header:\n  No this is not possible\n- also show name in account list \njava\n.withNameShown(true) //on the profile\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L92\n. @viettanbkdn .withSelectable(false) just makes the RecyclerView to not show the selected background. it will still fire the event. \n. @viettanbkdn by default it selects the first item. you can remove the default selection via: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#how-can-i-create-a-drawer-without-a-default-selection\nYes you can. There is already javaDocs inside the lib. Do you want to extend the README?\n. @viettanbkdn i always add everything to the sample app, or answer questions inside the issues section here @github and mark them as good to know\nYou solved your issue?\n. Thanks\n. @DemonStars just create a method which adds the DrawerItems to the drawer. On color update you just update all the added drawerItems with the new color, and notify the drawer that those items where updated.  \nthe Drawer has methods to add / remove / update items at a later time\n. @TheLoyalCruel yes you can do this by adding / removing items when on click. I implemented such a thing inside the sample acitvity. \nInside the onDrawerItemClickListener do the following:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L184\n\nInside the listener do the following for the item which should expand / hide items.\njava\n(opened) {\n    //remove the items which are hidden\n    result.removeItems(2000, 2001);\n} else {\n    int curPos = result.getPosition(drawerItem);\n    result.addItemsAtPosition(\n            curPos,\n            new SecondaryDrawerItem().withName(\"CollapsableItem\").withLevel(2).withIcon(GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_8tracks).withIdentifier(2000),\n            new SecondaryDrawerItem().withName(\"CollapsableItem 2\").withLevel(2).withIcon(GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_8tracks).withIdentifier(2001)\n    );\n}\nopened = !opened;\n. @MBehtemam should work. For testing i also always added the following line:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L55\n. yes. RTL support was added in API 17 :D\n. @MBehtemam \nYou have to create DrawerItems for your Categories. Probably iterate over those items and create your DrawerItems. after that you add those items to the drawer. \nThe onClick depends. If you have an id for your items you should use this one and set it as identifier. If not you can set the object as tag on your drawerItem and get that tag in the onClick. \nIf you only need the name of such an object you can just get the name inside the onClick and do whatever you need. \nSo in the onClick you react on the static items, and if it is none of those you can do the logic for the dynamic items.\n. @rubengees which version did you update from?\nDo you use the MiniDrawer in your app?\n. @rubengees which version did you update from?\nDo you use the MiniDrawer in your app?\n. @rubengees oh i think what could cause this ... \nthe problem is here. i missed to check the boolean ^^ stupid me \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1490\nI can fix it later today. \n. @rubengees oh i think what could cause this ... \nthe problem is here. i missed to check the boolean ^^ stupid me \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1490\nI can fix it later today. \n.

I will close this as i think it is no MaterialDrawer issue, but probably some configuration or setup issue. \nYou can still answer here, and i will help you solving your problem\n. I will close this as i think it is no MaterialDrawer issue, but probably some configuration or setup issue. \nYou can still answer here, and i will help you solving your problem\n. @vytautasm first thanks for your detailed issue report. \nI know that it seems that the behavior is may inconsistent, but it works as designed. If you use the AccountHeader everything is managed for you, and everything will be set up as it should look like, as of the Material Design Guidelines. \nIf you now use the normal Header, it will be shown as normal DrawerItem on top. So it will also do not move below the StatusBar as this is not like DrawerItems should be displayed. \n. @sammyrocz there is no ripple effect on devices pre API 21.\nIf you tap on an item it has the ripple effect. If you longpress it will have the transition from light grey to dark grey. There is also no ripple effect on the current selected element. \nThis is the same as in the google apps, and also like defined in the Material Design Guidelines\n. @outoftrun just checked. It get's assigned, and it's also used ;)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java#L30\nused here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java#L52\nand here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java#L59\n. @technovadors from which version to which version did you update?\nhave you enabled icon tinting?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/73b3a198bb7d7c9c3f464ce58fdcb1d63ba80d58/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDrawerItem.java#L180\nWhat do you mean across an item? You can add a badge to an item. \nThis item has a custom BadgeStyle\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/73b3a198bb7d7c9c3f464ce58fdcb1d63ba80d58/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L118\nYou can either directly apply an badge to an item.

You can still do it programmatically.\nDoes your items have an identifier? the setSelection method selects by identifier not position\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/73b3a198bb7d7c9c3f464ce58fdcb1d63ba80d58/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L444\n. @iLexiconn there is no method to have no active profile. Do you want to remove all profiles or what is the use case?\n. @iLexiconn if you set all profiles to .withSelectable(false) they won't be selected and won't show up in the header profile images list.\n. @iLexiconn this method exists on the ProfileDrawerItems\n. @iLexiconn that's interesting. if i set all ProfileDrawerItems to withSelectable(false) none is selected and no icons are shown in the header. (As it doesn't make sense to show those icons in the header if no account can be selected) Also as no Profile can be selected it won't show the name of the profile for the dropdown (You can set this text manually) \n. @iLexiconn but making them withSelectable(false) will still trigger the event, but won't allow them to be selected. \nThe profiles use the same logic as normal items. but this is managed by the AccountHeader, so the things work as required in most projects\n. @iLexiconn will your Drawer still show one selected account on top? So with the big profile image, and with the firstname and e-mail in the dropdown? If yes and the only thing you want to change is the selected background you could create your own CustomProfileDrawerItem by overwriting the existing one (or copying the code of this item to your project) and remove the selected background, so everything will be the same but there will be no selected item in the list\n. @iLexiconn i added a new method for you which allows you to only show the small images. \nas an addition i created a branch for you with a commit showcasing the changes required to get the result you have shown above. (as you also want no selected state in the list)\nHere's the commit https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/e3f41eff15406b20516348fadce544eab73cd66a\n. @iLexiconn v4.6.2 will take a while to sync to maven central. i hope it is exactly as you expect it\n. @iLexiconn v4.6.2 will take a while to sync to maven central. i hope it is exactly as you expect it\n. Great :)\n. Great :)\n. @jahirfiquitiva \nYou have two possible solutions:\n- Create the view as separat layout and provide as header to the Drawer\n- Create a CustomDrawerItem and set it as first element \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. @Mithrandir21 hmmm this is not really possible, as not only the header has a different height, but also the width (and padding to the left) of the items is a bit different. \nWhat theoretically can be done is to optimize it, and animate the height of the profile in the MiniDrawer to the height of the full drawer this would at least minimize the difference of the icons. \n. @Mithrandir21 hmmm this is not really possible, as not only the header has a different height, but also the width (and padding to the left) of the items is a bit different. \nWhat theoretically can be done is to optimize it, and animate the height of the profile in the MiniDrawer to the height of the full drawer this would at least minimize the difference of the icons. \n. @Mithrandir21 ok just tried my idea. there are more than issues.\n- You have to make sure both lists scrolling is in sync\n- You have to animate the MiniProfile height to the one from the AccountHeader\n- You have to animate the height of the MiniDrawerItems to the height of the normal drawer\nI have added a small animation to the latest sample, but not sure if you mean something similar\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CrossfadeDrawerLayoutActvitiy.java#L142\n. @MBehtemam that's no MaterialDrawer specific issue. That's default android behavior that LTR text is displayed LTR. Please you StackOverflow or Google to find a possibility to solve this issue. If this requires a Layout modification (perhaps text gravity right) then you can either create a CustomDrawerItem or you overwrite the layout of the PrimaryDrawerItem or you hook in via the onPostBindView hook and modify the TextView\nOne dev had the opposite once: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/812#issuecomment-156514494\n. @uzegonemad yes you are right. will be in the next version. thanks\n. @uzegonemad no problem :)\nThank you so much :)\n. @PedroBarbosaPT you have to use a Toolbar as the Actionbar does not allow to be overlapped by other views. \nRegarding your swipe question. I do not understand it. Perhaps check out the sample application. It showcases the MiniDrawer\n. @PedroBarbosaPT that's the CrossfadeDrawerLayout the sample application contains a sample activity with this.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CrossfadeDrawerLayoutActvitiy.java\nThis uses the CrossfadeDrawerLayout https://github.com/mikepenz/CrossfadeDrawerLayout\n. @MarsVard the MaterialDrawer has no custom fonts be default. Font style is defined via the normal Android methods. Perhaps your provided font does not have a bold variant?\n. @MarsVard great that you were able to solve it\n. @iLexiconn it is not in all google apps. Just in some.\nI am open for pull requests if you want this feature addded ;)\n. @prilling you have to notify the MiniDrawer that there is a new item:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L345\n. @FabianTerhorst can you please add a screenshot?\n. @mradzinski can you please try and run the sample app. is it also wrong for you?\nAny modifications on your side?\nWhat android version? Which device?\n. @mradzinski and you do not overwrite the items layout? \nWhat'S strange is the code you posed just defines the description for the item but not a name?\n. @Titannet normally i do not give advice how to use old versions of the drawer, but in this case. \nThe README tells you to include the drawer like this:\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.6.3@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\nthe transitive will take care to include all sub dependencies, including the support libs. If you want to define those sub dependencies on your own you have to remove the transitive and add the sub dependencies manually, which will allow you to define the support lib version:\n``` greadle\n    compile \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}\"\n    compile \"com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}\"\n    compile \"com.android.support:support-annotations:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}\"\n// the drawer itself\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.6.3@aar'\n\n// used to base on some backwards compatible themes\n// contains util classes to support various android versions, and clean up code\n// comes with the awesome \"Holder\"-Pattern\n// https://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:materialize:0.5.1@aar'\n\n// used to provide out of the box icon font support. simplifies development,\n// and provides scalable icons. the core is very very light\n// https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:iconics-core:2.5.3@aar'\n\n``\n. @roshu10 which style to you set on the toolbar?\n. new snapshot5.0.0.fastAdapter.b8-SNAPSHOT. - new SNAPSHOT with the latestFastAdapter` v0.6.0 which switches from ICollapsible to IExpandable.

Ok i just pushed a new beta for the MaterialDrawer. This one contains huge changes how the drawer is drawn behind the StatusBar. In previous versions this was done via a ScrimInsetsFrameLayout and a lot of handling of the paddings. With this release i now use fitsSystemWindows wherever i can. \nThis brings two changes:\n- The ScrimInsetsFrameLayout is no longer needed\n- There will be no more colored StatusBar for API 19-20 as this is not system default (if you need / want this. v4.6.4 will be the last version for you)\nUse the system, don\u2019t fight it\nI made this descision after reading the following article, which is may interesting for you too:\nhttps://medium.com/google-developers/why-would-i-want-to-fitssystemwindows-4e26d9ce1eec?linkId=19685562#.xuh9a3bfq\nI already updated the sample containing all necessary changes\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b21-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. @justjanne b21 starts to use the fitsSystemWindows property from android, so it now also follows all rules (and propably limitations) of this. \nb21 should no longer have the keyboard issues as the fullscreen flag is no longer set. \nShowing below the the StatusBar is showcased here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/feature/fitsSystemWindows/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/NonTranslucentDrawerActivity.java\nIf you meant behind the StatusBar this is no longer supported on API < 21. This follows the guideliens and also the platform rules. (The same is also not done in the cheesesquare sample)\n. @justjanne your theme?\n. @justjanne you either use a theme which has the translucentStatus MaterialDrawerTheme.TranslucentStatus or you also set withTranslucentStatusBarProgrammatically(true)\n. @justjanne no problem ;)\n. @justjanne Material-Dialogs is from aiden not me :D \n. - b23 released which uses the latest version of the FastAdapter and fixes a tiny issues which causes the wrong color to be used for the description text.\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b23-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. - b23 released which uses the latest version of the FastAdapter and fixes a tiny issues which causes the wrong color to be used for the description text.\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b23-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. - some new improvements to the styling\n- remove obsolete methods\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b24-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. - some new improvements to the styling\n- remove obsolete methods\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b24-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. v5.0.0 has many internal changes, uses a new adapter internally, provides expandable item functionality, .... \nI will prepare a whole changelog as soon as i release. \nIt now also do not add the FULLSCREEN flag anymore, it will now use the system internal mechanisms as far as possible. depending on fitsSystemWindows\nno more colored statusbar on API < 21\n. v5.0.0 has many internal changes, uses a new adapter internally, provides expandable item functionality, .... \nI will prepare a whole changelog as soon as i release. \nIt now also do not add the FULLSCREEN flag anymore, it will now use the system internal mechanisms as far as possible. depending on fitsSystemWindows\nno more colored statusbar on API < 21\n. - update dependencies\n- many fixes in the dependencies\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b25-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. @rubengees just tried it in the sample. The drawer opens and it stays opened. Perhaps somehting on your side triggers this?\n. - update FastAdapter to v1.0.4\n- only set fitsSystemWindows on API >= 21\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b26-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. - updated to latest Materialize library v0.8.2 with the following change:\n  - only set the FLAG_DRAWS_SYSTEM_BAR_BACKGROUNDS on API >= 21\n  - this fixes a Samsung bug on Android 4.3. Thanks @fabianterhorst for reporting and debugging it\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.0.0.b27-SNAPSHOT@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. v5.0.1 is realeased. This issue is now \"solved\"\n. @Floriansimmer you have to take care of the offset of the AccountHeader the position returned inside the listener is the global position. So if you have an AccountHeader or Header you have to add the offset of 1, without the header you have to remove this count of 1. \nJust a note. I haven't looked into the smaple app you have added yet.\nI am currently working on a big update v5.0.0 of the Drawer which should bring out of the box collapsing features. \n. @aeroperf yeah the ProfileDrawerItem has no method to set a different  color for the text in selection state. It only has the single text color. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L183\nAnd the PrimaryDrawerItem has also the option to provide a different selected text color. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L89\nWill add it for the next version\n. @aeroperf this will be in v5.0.0. currently available as snapshot ;)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/920\n. get the view of the header and set the image :D\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/418\n. @androideveloper just tried it. works as planned\njava\n.withDelayDrawerClickEvent(250)\n.withDelayOnDrawerClose(0)\nCloses the drawer instantly, and after 250ms calls the listener\n. @androideveloper you didn't mention that you use the MiniDrawer that's a completely different case :P\n. @androideveloper with the MiniDrawer you can't use this method as the MiniDrawer is hooked together with the Drawer via the click listener. So when you click on the item it will wait the time until the event is triggerend which will resize the Drawer. \nPlease keep the code you posted in the question as is basically the same i do for the normal event. \nRegarding the fact that both are from the same lib. yes that's true. but theoretically the MiniDrawer is not bound to the Drawer (just a few methods to minimize code). \n. @androideveloper as mentioned. just set the delays to 0ms and add the handler as you posted in the question above in your code. \nThere is not much i can do about the behavior, as the \"toggle\" is done after event is called.\n. @justjanne could you please add the code how you generate those items? \n. just tried it. can't reproduce it with the following items\njava\nArrayList<IDrawerItem> LIST = new ArrayList<IDrawerItem>(Arrays.asList(\n            new Parent(\"1. Freenode\", Arrays.<IDrawerItem>asList(\n                    new Child(\"1.2.1. ##political_chat\"),\n                    new Child(\"1.2.2. ##politics\"),\n                    new Child(\"1.2.3. #amarok\"),\n                    new Child(\"1.2.4. #android-dev\"),\n                    new Child(\"1.2.5. #kde\"),\n                    new Child(\"1.2.6. #quassel\")\n            )),\n            new Parent(\"2. HackInt\", Arrays.<IDrawerItem>asList(\n                    new Child(\"2.2.1. #32c3\"),\n                    new Child(\"2.2.2. #33c3\"),\n                    new Child(\"2.2.3. #ffki\"),\n                    new Child(\"2.2.4. #toppoint\"),\n                    new Child(\"2.2.5. #voc-lounge\")\n            )),\n            new Parent(\"3. QuakeNet\", Arrays.<IDrawerItem>asList(\n                    new Child(\"3.2.1. #frozen\"),\n                    new Child(\"3.2.2. #yepityha\"),\n                    new Child(\"3.2.3. gal\"),\n                    new Child(\"3.2.4.

Sapphi\"),\n                    new Child(\"3.2.6. staffehn\"),\n                    new Child(\"3.2.7. voluhy\")\n            ))\n    ));\nadd numbers so i can directly see when there are duplicates \ncould it probably happend that there are issues with the code updating the items?\n. Just had one thought. it may also can happens because the subItems do not have an identifier and for those the IdDistributor does not provide automatically genereted id's. and this may cause display errors or update errors\n. you don't update them. what else do you do. do you click anything special. i can't reproduce it with the above items. \n. @justjanne thanks. i will test it now\n. @justjanne yes. i can replicate the issue. and i just commit and push the solution ;)\n. new snapshot 5.0.0.fastAdapter.b5-SNAPSHOT\nThanks for you help tracking down this bug ;)\n. @7ShaYaN7 which icon font addon are you using?\n. @7ShaYaN7 may it is related to this issue:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/90\nwhich is realted to this Icon font addon:\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.1.0.1.original@aar'\nA good alternative is this icon font:\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:material-design-iconic-typeface:2.2.0.1@aar'\nor this one:\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:community-material-typeface:1.3.41.1@aar'\n. @7ShaYaN7 does this also happen if you generate a IconicsDrawable and set it as Drawable? May the Android system somehow alters the unicode values for your language :O\n. @7ShaYaN7 any other lib which alter the font for the whole application? or something similar?\n. @7ShaYaN7 hmmm in the code samples i can't see a issue. Perhaps it's possible that you send me a sample app showcasing this issue? or the whole project (if possible). you can send it via e-mail so it stays private. and i will take a look what could cause this issue.\n. I try my best to give the best support possible. As mentioned. With the given information everythign seems fine, to solve or track down this issue i would need a sample or the project itself. \nAs soon as you can provide some more i can try to solve it ;)\ni will close the issue as i assume it may be a weird issue, as noone else had something similar, but that doesn't mean we can't continue to work on this issue here ;)\n. @MecDuino what does not work?\n. @MecDuino the MiniDrawer sample already shows the whole code which is necessary to get it working. It is also commented to state what's happening where.\nRegarding your screenshot. The default MiniDrawer (for which i can give support)  has the icons with the size defined in the Material Design Guidelines. If you need custom style it is possible, but will require more advanced android coding knowledge. Which might be a bit to complicated for a beginner. \n. @rsd-raul you try to add a second drawer. That means 2 drawer in one activity?\nYou have an activity with a collapsing toolbar and want the drawer to be below the toolbar?\nRegarding only allow to open the drawer via mRightDrawer.openDrawer(); --> \"LOCK\" the drawer (this can be done via the DrawerLayout) \n. @rsd-raul can you probably just have one DrawerLayout which will have both drawers? As the MultiDrawer sample showcases? There is one limitation with this that you can't have one drawer below the toolbar and the other under the toolbar. You may be able to add a padding to the right drawer so it looks that it starts below the toolbar but this will add a dark layer above the non drawer areas (this is DrawerLayout and i can't change this) \n. @rsd-raul you can also define the LOCK for a specific gravity\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html#setDrawerLockMode(int, int)\nRegarding how expensive. That's not too much for the right drawer, as it is basically just a RecyclerView which will be filled with items. And defining the correct paddings.\n. @rsd-raul i'm not quite sure what you mean that you miss the possibility to add an OnDrawerListener to the drawer after creation. \nThe code you padded mixes up the DrawerListener and the OnDrawerItemClickListener. \nYou can provide a different OnDrawerItemClickListener for each of the two drawers. The left (main) one, and the right (appended) one. \nYou are right that there is only one OnDrawerListener which you set via .withOnDrawerListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerListener() { on the left (main) drawer via it's builder. \nBut this will provide a View with the event, which you can check if it is the left or right drawer. \n``` java\n.withOnDrawerListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onDrawerOpened(View drawerView) {\n                        if (drawerView == result.getSlider()) {\n                            Log.e(\"sample\", \"left opened\");\n                        } else if (drawerView == resultAppended.getSlider()) {\n                            Log.e(\"sample\", \"right opened\");\n                        }\n                    }\n                @Override\n                public void onDrawerClosed(View drawerView) {\n                    if (drawerView == result.getSlider()) {\n                        Log.e(\"sample\", \"left closed\");\n                    } else if (drawerView == resultAppended.getSlider()) {\n                        Log.e(\"sample\", \"right closed\");\n                    }\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void onDrawerSlide(View drawerView, float slideOffset) {\n\n                }\n            })\n\n```\nThis should do the thing you want to achieve. \nOk great :) thanks a lot for this :)\nJust let me know. I may be faster answering them, or hinting you into the correct direction then you can search for them :P \n. @rsd-raul regarding the first part. yes the OnDrawerListener is only set via  the main DrawerBuilder as this one manages the DrawerLayout and can be seen as the master. As many functions are the same i have kept the appended drawer in the same object, which may cause confusion as not all methods will do what they do when used via the master DrawerBuilder. \nYeah :D \nRegarding Multi-Selection :D that will come in v5.0.0 where already a first beta is out. MultiSelect not yet enabled. (But is theoretically already in via the FastAdapter https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter)\nwithWidthDp doesn't do the job?\n. @rsd-raul great :). have a nice evening\n. @rsd-raul i just enabled multiSelection within the latest beta of the MaterialDrawer you can get it here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/920#issuecomment-171478069\nI would really love to get some feedback, because MultiSelection within the drawer is a complicated topic, as it does not really follow normal multiSelection rules which are common in lists\n. you can get the position of an item. you may be able to scroll to this position via the RecyclerView then. I assume you will find enough resources on StackOverflow to scroll to a position if you know the index.\n. just pass the view which you want to lock to the method: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html#setDrawerLockMode(int, android.view.View) \n. @troy21688 this drawer does not define this. You can choose what you prefer and what fits best in your application. \nJust implement the listener and react if the user clicks a drawer item\njava\n.withOnDrawerItemClickListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerItemClickListener() {\n        @Override\n        public boolean onItemClick(View view, int position, IDrawerItem drawerItem) {\n            // do something with the clicked item :D\n        }\n    })\n. @troy21688 you have 2 drawers in your activity?\nremove this line\njava\nnew DrawerBuilder().withActivity(this).build();\n. because you do not add the drawer anymore if the savedInstanceState is != null\n``` java\n    // Check that the activity is using the layout version with\n    // the fragment_container FrameLayout\n    if (findViewById(R.id.fragment_container) != null) {\n    // However, if we're being restored from a previous state,\n    // then we don't need to do anything and should return or else\n    // we could end up with overlapping fragments.\n    if (savedInstanceState != null) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n```\n. @Krashband image loading is not part of the library. I just offer the api to do so. \nIf you have you update any item of the drawer (profile, drawerItem, ...) you always have to notify the drawer or accountHeader about that change. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L235\nIf you define a profile image via url, and have defined the ImageLoader it will work automatically. If you change that profile image you also have to notify the accountHeader about that change.\n. @Krashband you use the DrawerImageLoader as shown in the sample application? \n. @Krashband just tried the following in the sample:\nwithin the onDrawerItemClickListener (just to do this at a later point than starting the activity) i call the following:\njava\nprofile.withIcon(\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/634243?v=3&s=96\");\nheaderResult.updateProfile(profile);\nwhich will update the profile with identifier 100 (.withIdentifier(100))\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L63\nand the image loading is done via glide. but should work the same with picasso\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L40\n. @LiuDeng there are release notes for all updates\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/releases\n. @Thorsten1976 this seems to be a DrawerLayout issue, as the closing is not handling on my side for this. Perhaps you can try it with a plain DrawerLayout without a library. If it happens too you should open an issue for this on the official bug tracker:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/list\nI can't reproduce this on my phone with the sample app. \n. @tachang by default the DrawerLayout is inflatet directly in the root. (android.R.id.content) which is around your layout you provide. As it is in the root it will by default be full height. If you do not want this you have to inflate the drawer somewhere else, in this example inside the frame_container. Which is below the toolbar because it defines android:layout_below=\"@id/toolbar\"\n. @TurKurT656 but that's how Android and RTL works. You can prevent to show this on text when you do the following:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/812#issuecomment-156514494\notherwise you could disable it by overwriting the original layout\n. @TurKurT656 define a custom dimension for material_drawer_account_header_text\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1119\n. @jurrick hmmm the MiniDrawer with the Crossfader can't do this as the layout which holds the Crossfader is on the same \"level\" as the other content and we just resize the panels. \nThere is one possible solutions for this use case. \nYou implement a FrameLayout which hosts the Crossfader (including MiniDrawer and normal Drawer on top of the other views) and which adds the shadow. \nOne other solution (not sure how the above implementation works in real live) is that you have a normal Drawer including the normal DrawerLayout in your application, and also add the MiniDrawer to the app (without the Crossfader) so the user sees the MiniDrawer which syncs with the Drawer if the user now swipes from the left edge the normal Drawer will overlap the MiniDrawer and the rest of the ui. (it will also be full height, which would look better)\n. @MFlisar take a look at the FullScreenDrawer example:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/FullscreenDrawerActivity.java\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_fullscreen_dark_toolbar.xml#L29\nThe thing is that the drawer manages the insets of the screen by default so the drawer is full height but the application isn't \n. @TurKurT656 the items are selected automatically. Or what do you mean?\nIf you want to react on the click you should identify them via their identifier:\njava\ndrawerItem.getIdentifier()\nStickyDrawerItems will always return position = -1 as those are not part of the list and are managed independent of the rest of the items\n. @danielgomezrico what do you try? \nAs of the source code withIcon is not defined as @Nullable where do you read this?\n. @danielgomezrico interesting enough. It seems that is added automatically\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L71\nTo fix this FC i would recommend to simply don't set the icon if the url is null\n. @Debjyotinath you have to provide the Toolbar to the DrawerBuilder otherwise  it is not possible to create the ActionBarDrawerToggle\n. @Debjyotinath the Drawer can't / won't manage the ActionBarDrawerToggle for you if you just build the view with .buildView(). Do you want to include the Drawer manually somewhere? Or do you want default behavior?\n. @Debjyotinath the ActionBarDrawerToggle which will be managed by the drawer if you have a normal setup can't be created when you implement the MiniDrawer as the ActionBarDrawerToggle requires an DrawerLayout which does not exist in the MiniDrawer \nYou may use a library to get the animated hamburger to arrow icon. If you just want the hamburger icon you may use a library which allows you to do so without a DrawerLayout\nThe following one is used most and is a good recommendation\nhttps://github.com/balysv/material-menu\n. @Debjyotinath i can't reproduce this. Which version are you using? \nThis one is also obsolete as soon as i release v5.0.0 which switches to the FastAdapter. the FastAdapter will be responsible for taking care of the selections afterwards\n. @Debjyotinath ok that's weird. i can't reproduce it with the steps you mentioned. Tried it on my Nexus 5 and Nexus 6P :/ \nv5.0.0 is already available as SNAPSHOT in beta state. (really stable) \nCan't name a date for the stable release though\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/920\n. @EpsilonOrionis they are on the same level yes. you can enable the inner shadow for the Crossfader?\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/crossfader/app/SimpleActivity.java#L137\n. @wimbervoets thanks\n. @knezmilos13 will be available in v5.0.0. You can already try out the SNAPSHOT:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/920\n. @elod91 you can check out the sample app it doesn't include this space either. can you provide your layout and the code how you configure the drawer in your activity?\n. with the provided code everything is fine. so this does not cause the issue.\nYou are sure there is no margin or padding in any other part of your code or in the content layout?\nWhat's the used theme? \nIt seems you have exactly the height of the statusbar at the bottom. \n. if you use this theme MaterialDrawerTheme.TranslucentStatus? \n. do you have a fitsSystemWindows somewhere in your layout?\n. Never experienced it in any apps i did, nor someone else mentioned it. I really would love to debug it. could you provide a sample app which showcases the issue. with everything app related non public, non relevant removed?\n. thanks. the provided snippets seem fine so yeah. :/\n. @elod91 oh you had two builders? ok you are only allowed to build a Drawer once per activity.\nIf you have to add the header at a later time. you could do this if you create your AccountHeader build it. then you can get the view of the header and set it to the Drawer\ndrawer.withHeader(accountHeader. getView()) and you set the Drawer for the AccountHeader so it can toggle the items.. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L47\n. @mdtuyen have you defiend a DrawerImageLoader?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L40\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ.md\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_show_drawer_under_toolbar.md\n. @EnduroXPro if you just set the fragment without using any listeners or similiar of the drawer? willl it work? \n--> just move the fragment setting to the end of the onCreate method. \nIf it does not work the issue is not materialDrawer related\n. android:windowSoftInputMode=\"adjustResize\" does not work as soon as the activity has the FULLSCREEN flag which is required to draw the drawer below the Toolbar\nNormally the KeyboardUtil helps a bit to fix the behavior, or get a similar behavior similar to the one \"adjustResize\" would create. \nHave you tried the KeyboardUtil Drawer sample?\n. @vanniktech yeah that's the thing like android treats it internally. there are pretty long issues regarding this topic. \nDoes it work in the sample app for you? Any special keyboard you use?\n. hmmm no the theme doesn't play a role here :/ \nIf you look at the source of the KeyboardUtil you will see it does nothing else than detecting when the keyboard is shown, and will then resize your contentView which should cause the EditText to move into focus. But this only works if your view is something like a ScrollView or a RecyclerView or ListView\nOtherwise it will have problems scrolling to the position of the EditText\n. may there is not enough space that the EditText get's moved up far enough?\n. oh ok\n. @vanniktech it is automatically done for you :)\nShould no longer be necessary as adjustResize should work now as expected\n. @vanniktech your profile defines an identifier? \nJust tried it in the sample and it works without any problems\n. @vanniktech you have an identifier set for your profile? As mentioned I tried it in the sample, with the same code and it worked\n. @vanniktech will re-add the auto identifier applying in v5.0.1\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/81d9a48a8b773fa8cf243282829a655b863982f6\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L15\njust use a theme which makes the statusBar translucent\n. @EpsilonOrionis you use the correct theme?\nThen could you please add some more details? Which library version? \n. @EpsilonOrionis could you please add some more details?\n. @EpsilonOrionis how do you build the drawer?\n. @EpsilonOrionis how do you build the drawer? do you use .build() or .buildView() \n. @EpsilonOrionis seems fine too. Can you double check again with the sample app?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CrossfadeDrawerLayoutActvitiy.java\nOn which android version do you test it?\nIf you do not find anything it would be great if you can provide a small sample app to showcase the issue.\n. @EpsilonOrionis i don't know. the sample doesn't show this behavior. So i only can assume that the layout may be different or that any other part of your code causes this\n. but the original layout also does not define a background: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_dark_toolbar.xml\n. @EpsilonOrionis sorry this is a MiniDrawer specific limitation: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/925#issuecomment-170608570\n. @DavidMont the short answer yes. \nThe long answer. As this drawerItem is no default item you will have to create your own CustomDrawerItem which looks like the one in the image. \nIn the sample app source code there are a few CustomDrawerItems \nOr there's also a description here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31030595/how-to-customize-the-draweritem-using-the-lib-mikepenz-materialdrawer/32542999#32542999\nOr you may check already asked questions:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=CustomDrawerItem\n. @ChoHyun-myung seems to be a DrawerLayout and MapView issue. Have you googled if other people also have this issue? \nPerhaps you can move the MapView to the background?\n. @ChoHyun-myung this has nothing to do with the MaterialDrawer but with the DrawerLayout which is from Android. \nThat were just ideas. I know that a FrameLayout has a method .bringToFront() which may could help. \n. @ChoHyun-myung ok cool thanks. \nHave a nice evening ;). \n. Good morning @DavidMont \nIf you just want to have events from the RecyclerView you can get the reference to this view via: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L262\nBest,\nMike\n. @grishko188 as the MiniDrawer is just a view yes\n. @midhunQburst i am not really sure what you mean. \nInside the click listener you can set the fragment. You can activate that as soon as the Activity is created the click event is fired once, so the event get's called with the fragment to select. \n. @midhunQburst as the drawer does not manage fragments this has to be handled on your side. \nBy default the onDrawerItemClick event is not fired upon launch. (You can enable this if you want to have your complete logic for switching fragments inside the listener). \nSo you can just write the \"fix\" inside the click listener or whereever you have your fragment transaction logic.\n. @midhunQburst as the drawer does not manage fragments this has to be handled on your side. \nBy default the onDrawerItemClick event is not fired upon launch.

You have to set a background which has a selected state\n. @Mediator21 to have the background with a selected state you can use this:\njava\n//set the background for the item\nUIUtils.setBackground(viewHolder.view, UIUtils.getSelectableBackground(ctx, selectedColor, true));\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/988\n. it happens on the 0th position if you have added a header, which is not a bug as the header takes the 0th position. \nwill it happen if you added it on any position between 1 - last item?\n. it also happens with the FastAdapters add method? with position 0 :O ok that shouldn't be the case then\n. @justjanne ok sorry for the confusion. I took a second look and have a properly description for you now. \nTo make it more transparent for devs, the FastAdapter only works with the global position. In an earlier version i worked with the relative position (depending on the adapter used) but this was to confusing. So i switched to global positions only. So that means if ther eis a header, the first position of your items is 1 if no header is there the first position is 0.\nSo you may ask now why does it fail with position 0 if there is a header. To get the global position i substract the number of items which are in the prior adapter. So HeaderAdapter with 1 item, ItemAdapter with X items. To get the global position here, i substract position provided by 1 (where 1 is the cound of items inside the HeaderAdapter)\n. If you want to work with the Relative position (which is the position specific to one adapter) you can do the following:\njava\nmItemAdapter.getGlobalPosition(int relativePosition);\n. @justjanne ok i can't reproduce this one. Just tried it, and it adds the item at the position. \njava\nresult.addItemAtPosition(new DividerDrawerItem(), 1);\nno crash\n. This worked on my side:\nAdding a subItem:\njava\n((SecondaryDrawerItem) result.getDrawerItem(19)).getSubItems().add(new SecondaryDrawerItem().withName(\"CollapsableItem 2\").withLevel(3).withIcon(GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_airline_seat_recline_normal).withIdentifier(2002));\nresult.getAdapter().notifyAdapterSubItemsChanged(result.getPosition(19));\nRemoving a subItem:\njava\n((SecondaryDrawerItem) result.getDrawerItem(19)).getSubItems().remove(0);\nresult.getAdapter().notifyAdapterSubItemsChanged(result.getPosition(19));\nI assume the additional \"call itemchanged\" was causing your issue. Or you might used the wrong position to notify that the subItems changed.\n. @FranciscoMSM the easiest way will be that you copy over the material_drawer_header.xml (you can overwrite the original if you keep the name else set it via .withAccountHeader()) \nThen you modify this layout and add your button. Make sure you don't remove any of the included views as otherwhise the AccountHeader will break. \nIf you added your Logout-Button view. You create the Drawer and AccountHeader as you would normally do. After you created the header you can get the view of the AccountHeader and get the reference to your Logout-Button view.\njava\nheaderResult.getView().findViewById(R.id.your_logout_button)\n//and your additional logic here...\n. what do you want do achieve?\nIf you want to get a header which has nothing to do with the AccountHeader then just don't use the AccountHeader and simply add a normal header layout to the Drawer alone.\nThe AccountHeader has a very specific use case and as such a very specific layout and design (as of the guidelines). If you want to totally customize it then simply don't use the AccountHeader define your layout you want to show, pass it as header to the drawer, and then handle actions manually. you can modify the layout as long as the main elements stay the same. but if you need something completely else which is not as defined in the guidelines then you might be better served by implementing your complete own drawer just by using the DrawerLayout, and not go with a library.\nno they are not. only the AccountHeader's profiles will show up in the miniDraewr. \n. @Fiks33 on the item.\nShown here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. Thanks ;)\n. @dstd because of the way the layout is set up, and the RTL support it features, i can't change this for the included layout. \nIf you do not need the arrow in your application you could modify the layout for your case and overwrite the original one. \nCopy the original layout into your application, change the layout to your needs (keep the name) and afterwards it will automatically use your modified version (keep in mind you can not delete the view as it is still called inside the code)\nThanks\n(Sorry for the late answer, I was very busy the previous week)\n. @dstd because of the way the layout is set up, and the RTL support it features, i can't change this for the included layout. \nIf you do not need the arrow in your application you could modify the layout for your case and overwrite the original one. \nCopy the original layout into your application, change the layout to your needs (keep the name) and afterwards it will automatically use your modified version (keep in mind you can not delete the view as it is still called inside the code)\nThanks\n(Sorry for the late answer, I was very busy the previous week)\n. @dj9975 I expect you do not provide your Toolbar to the DrawerBuilder without the Toolbar it can not initialize the ActionBarDrawerToggle for you\n. @dj9975 then you will have to handle this on your own, as the ActionBarDrawerToggle can't be used with an ActionBar. I highly recommend switching to the Toolbar\n. @PeterPhyo please do not depend on the position for selection. Please use identifiers as shown in the sample.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L168\n. @PeterPhyo the fact that you defined it to be non selectable\nremove\njava\n.withSelectable(false)\n. @PeterPhyo won't it trigger the onItemClick listener or do you mean something else?\n. @eirinaios how does your layout look like?\n. @eirinaios with v5.0.0 those issues directly come from the fitsSystemWindows=true and from the insets as the drawer no longer handles or manages the paddings, and shadow etc. \nYou may also want to check the CollapsingToolbarActivity as reference: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java#L50\nThere I have the StatusBar as normal etc. \n. v4.6.4 is really stable. So you are save if you stay with that version. \nOne of the biggest change is in fact the thing with the fitsSystemWindows and it caused a lot of headaches before I decided to go this way, but it will be more \"future\"-save as the official Google drawer also depends on this, and all new layouts also work with them. And I expect this to play a bigger role in future android releases too. \nIf you find some time once, or find your issue it would be great if you could add your findings here.\n. @CeJienAJPC adding a ExpandableDrawerItem including an arrow + animation is already planned, and will come in the next update. \nThe divider line can be added via the DividerDrawerItem if you want?\n. @CeJienAJPC I will look of adding an ExpandableItem with the correct animation.

(just for debugging) \nSeems like I do not fire the item's listener anymore. Have to test it\n. @alessandrotorres yes you understood me correctly. Thanks for this quick test.\nI might not be able to check this until next week. But expect a new version at least on Monday. \nBest,\nMike\n. @mtrakal what you are doing is you set a new header, which will then play the normal item animation. What I suggest (for just updating the background) that you get the View from the Header via:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L268 \nand you change the background. so no itemChange is triggered on the RecyclerView \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L227\nNo highlighting at all? :/\nNever had this case, but I think withSelectable(false) could also work here.\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L227\nNo highlighting at all? :/\nNever had this case, but I think withSelectable(false) could also work here.\n.

It is meant that it keeps the color even when selected. \nWhat do you need? Don't you just want the default PrimaryDrawerItem-behavior?\n. @bignadad instead of the ColorHolder I suggest that you just remember the Drawable for your background, and for the selected background. And inside the bindView you will then just define a StateListDrawable for the itemView\nCreating a StateListDrawable which will automatically change depending on the state is as easy as this:\njava\nStateListDrawable stateListDrawable = new StateListDrawable();\nstateListDrawable.addState(new int[]{android.R.attr.state_selected}, selectedBackground);\nstateListDrawable.addState(new int[]{}, background);\n. @bignadad 2 things. \nFirst you define the same drawable for the selected, and for the general state. \nSecond you set the background as Drawable for the itemView not the stateListDrawable\nHere's a simplified variant:\n``` java\npublic class CustomPrimaryDrawerItemPro extends PrimaryDrawerItem {\n    @Override\n    public void bindView(ViewHolder holder) {\n        super.bindView(holder);\n    StateListDrawable stateListDrawable = new StateListDrawable();\n    //define the color we want to use for the selected state (this is the default one defined via theme and is defined via the material design guidelines)\n    stateListDrawable.addState(new int[]{android.R.attr.state_selected}, new ColorDrawable(getSelectedColor(holder.itemView.getContext())));\n    //define the color which is used for the general state\n    stateListDrawable.addState(new int[]{}, new ColorDrawable(Color.RED));\n    //set the color for the view\n    holder.itemView.setBackgroundDrawable(stateListDrawable);\n}\n\n}\n``\n. @couchcrew-thomas you can even use the same API I use for theAccountHeaderYou can check out the source of the AccountHeader here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L1338\nand the second spot here\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L1380\n. @couchcrew-thomas hmmm it is the expected behavior that theswitchDrawerContent` also removes the sticky footer items. You may just simply readd them for the changed content too\n. @westman2000 at the moment the code is required yes. I plan to improve this in an update soon. \nRegarding the insertion of new items. If you expand an item with sub-items it will add the items to the list. so the positions will also move. I have to check how the performance will be, and how much sense it will make if the count of sub items is removed when adding new items, as the \"subitems\" should be not \"visible\" for the dev\n. @westman2000 ok I took a deeper look at this issue. It is not possible to ignore the subitems by default, but I have added a new method to the FastAdapter which allows to get the count of subitems items before a specific position. So you can easily calculate the correct position you want to update. \nYou can use this method via:\njava\nresult.getItemAdapter().getExpandedItemsCount(0, the position of your item)\n. @JasonHezz you have already checked out the CollapsingToolbar sample? \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java\nThe MaterialDrawer will just add a DrawerLayout to the root of your activity. So I don't see why this should not work.\nYou can build the Drawer and afterwards you can add / remove items as you want\n. @JasonHezz may you could send a sample showcasing the working solution via the NavigationView and the one via the MaterialDrawer\n. @JasonHezz thanks will have a look this evening\n. @JasonHezz just set android:fitsSystemWindows=\"false\" (false) for the CoordinatorLayout\n. @androideveloper can't reproduce this with the MiniDrawer of the sample app\n. @androideveloper can you reproduce this in the sample?\n. @alirezaaa what do you need it for?\n. @alirezaaa my question was, why you used it. Because with v5.0.0 this method had no use anymore, and I think it is not necessary. The header view you can provide is clickable by the default, and as far as I remember it never resulted in a callback of the onItemClickListener\n. @vanniktech yes that is true as the item won't be notified and updated via the click listener. \nWill have a closer look at it\n. @vanniktech ok just checked this. It is not possible to handle this within the FastAdapter as the collapse, and expande methods are used in general for this operation. If I would notify the adapter about the change within this method it will crash if you click on a ExpandableItem as the same item will be notified about its change twice, causing a inconsistent state for the animator. \nIn this case it is recomended that you just call,\njava\nmDrawer.getAdapter().notifyItemChanged(pos);\n(oh and the collapse method takes the position not the ID)\n. @Aeefire you are searching for StickyFooterItems?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java#L101\n. @Strayer thanks for your detailed issue. \nThe behavior of this has changed starting with v5.0.0. The root cause for this is the switch from built in adapter to the FastAdapter. So you may ask why I have decided to go with this. \nThe main point is that I wanted consistency between the position you get from the listeners and the positions you have to pass if you want to modify something. \nSo why will the first item be at position 1 if there is a header, and 0 if there is none? Yeah that comes because the Header is also just an item within the RecyclerView \nThe internal structure looks like this. \nHeaderAdapter\nItemAdapter\nFooterAdapter\nStickyFooterArea (completely out of scope of the RV)\nSo the count of items of the header will count up the positions in the normal ItemAdapter and also in the FooterAdapter \nAs you already correctly foudn the getGlobalPosition() method. It basically checks the position of the adapter you are calling it on (Theoretically there could be more as 3 (as it is the case for the drawer)) and will then add the number of items before the current adapter, so you can work with relative positions. \nI hope this clears up your confusion a bit :)\n. @marinica94 the issue here is, that you add all your items again. So the already existing items will duplicate.\nYou can either result.removeAllItems(); from the drawer before you readd everything. \nOr you just add the new items.\n. @danielgomezrico in the onProfileClick listener you get the View https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L89 \nThis will allow you to set the transitionName on the ImageView\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_profile.xml#L22\n. @CombatEvolved just tried it, and it works in the sample. \nYou have inserted this SwitchDrawerItem via the DrawerBuilder?\nDoes this SwitchDrawerItem define an identifier via withIdentifier()? (Should not be necessary as it also works without an identifier in the sample)\nWhich version do you use?\n. @CombatEvolved oh ok. Updating and notifiying the adapter from a non-ui thread is always fatal :D (and updateItem() just calls notifyItemChanged in the background)\n. @waninkoko hi\nSorry I can't reproduce this issue. When i add an item it is added without any issues. \nAs the MaterialDrawer now uses the FastAdapter in the background and it properly calls notifyItemInserted on the adapter, this should not happen. \nIn general such issues appear when you change items inside an Adapter and notify the Adapter from a NON UI-Thread. So I assume you try to add the item from a wrong thread?\n. @waninkoko what I tried to reproduce this. \n- created the Drawer within the onCreate\n- opened the Drawer to make sure I see when items are added\n- with a handler (new Handler().postDelayed()) after 2 seconds (so I am on the UI Thread) I added a new Item at the end\nIt properly animates and adds the item without touching the view. I tried this on my Nexus 6P and on a Emulator\n. @HamedGh if your app is in RTL mode this will happen automatically.

I don't know what you mean\n. @drduan you must not have a DrawerLayout inside your layout. This is handled on library side. \nYour activities layout should just consist of the activities content nothing else. Drawer + DrawerLayout is handled by the lib. \nPlease see one of the sample's layouts:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample.xml\n. Please check out the sample application. It showcases a proper layout and also how to use the Drawer\n. Please check out the sample application. It showcases a proper layout and also how to use the Drawer\n. @p4tric do you have only one profile? If yes see here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/798\n. @dstd this decision was made, because on API <21 there is no ripple, and it does not look good if the whole header gets a solid color set, as the selection area does. \n. @CeJienAJPC in the sample it is still working with v23.2.0. You may try the sample on your device and check if it also works. If yes you may post some more details on how you implemented it?\n. @CeJienAJPC oh ok that makes sense. I expect you still have the logic for toggling the Expandable item in your code. This was removed and is now done automatically by the library. \nSee the updated DrawerActivity.\nthe cahnges is also seen in this diff: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/88e9bdf8cccaac5aaf567ac6ffe682aeccba4f29\n. Oh ok. so it seems this will be fixed in v23.2.1 of the support lib. Will close this now as I can not prevent this.\nA solution for your would be to exclude the support lib dependencies of my library and just define your own version within the build.gradle\n. @Heri14 you want to select a different item?\nJust use the setSeleciton method\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L216\n. @Heri14 so use the method on top, which sets the selection. \nHandling back press is nothing MaterialDrawer specific. \n. @cinemidia more details please\n. @cypressious just remove it from the list, and add it again later. the Drawer has the methods to do so\n. @ohpoloha no sub items are not resolved via identifier, as they may not be part of the list when you try to get them. (Sub items are added when expanded, and removed again when closed)\nYou should just get the parent item and search for the identifier in its subitems. \n. @ohpoloha the best approach here is that you either keep the DrawerItem already global in your class and you alter the object when you want to change the badge. Or you get the DrawerItem from the parent DrawerItem \njava\nList list = ((ExpandableDrawerItem)drawer.getDrawerItem(1)).getSubItems();\nPrimaryDrawerItem pdi = //get the item\n//update the badge\nNow as you update the item you have to notify the drawer about the changed element\njava\ndrawer.getAdapter(). notifyAdapterSubItemsChanged(result.getPosition(1));\n. @ohpoloha updateBadge() is wrong. with change the badge I meant just set the badge like\njava\n//set new badge value\nitem.withBadge(\"newvalue\");\n//notify about the changed subitems\ndrawer.getAdapter(). notifyAdapterSubItemsChanged(result.getPosition(1));\n. @soheilserver no it is not possible, as it would not know which width to use. A drawer needs an exact width. You can modify the width programmatically if you need to\n. @rafakob you define a custom OnClickListener direct on the view, but there is already the listener provided by the library:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L533\n. @Debjyotinath there are 2 different modes of sliding for the MiniDrawer the default one, and the \"gmail-like\" one. The default one allows to slide left by draging the right content view too, the second mode allows just to slide if you touch the MiniDrawer itself. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/crossfader/Crossfader.java#L52\n. @kayvannj you might mix up things here. \nThe OnAccountHeaderSelectionViewClickListener is used to notify you about the click on the toggle. If you return true here you can prevent the toggling to the profile list. This event is not meant to close the drawer. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L1323\nThis just happens when you select a profile itself. \n(you can still do mDrawer.closeDrawer() in here if you need to)\n. @jhmacdon the MaterialDrawer creates a normal DrawerLayout with the fitsSystemWindows flag set to true. So this is done with the system default behavior. \nYou might want to check out the FullScreenActivity of the sample showing how you can get to use the area below the StatusBar too\nOr you might also want to check out the CollapsingToolbarSample which also has content below the StatusBar\n. @darienalvarez what do you  mean? You have created the drawer via .build() and when you call drawer.openDrawer() nothing happens?\nPlease report back. Will close this for now (as it is working in the sample) until additional information was added. \n. @darienalvarez what do you  mean?

Pushed a new version fixing this. v5.1.1 \n. @mrneiverth if you want a custom font you may also want it everywhere else in your app. So you might check https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy \nMost elements of the drawer also allow you to pass a Typeface so this might be what you are searching for\n. @ateodor1 you must not .build a Drawer more than once per activity. \nAfter the drawer was built you just should update it afterwards via the methods the Drawer offers\n.

Nothing I can do regarding this. For the time beeing you could exclude the support libs from the MaterialDrawer and provide your own version for them. \nExcluding is described here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/20016971/325479\n. @sdeff I already start to update the libs ;)\n. @mrneiverth that's because it is still possible to define a selection programatically, which is done by for the first position by default. \nSee the following to disable this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#how-can-i-create-a-drawer-without-a-default-selection\n. @mrneiverth not really sure. you already set the items to withSelectable(false) which means they do not get the selected background state\n. @mrneiverth I am still a bit confused. withSelectable(false) will just remove the real selected state of a DraewrItem there is still a touch feedback shown. \nSo you should make all your items withSelectable(false) and disable the default selection on startup. \nYou can still force a selection programatically then or reset the selection via -1\n. @mrneiverth withSelectable(false) will still fire the event and it will launch the activity. The only thing different is that it won't draw the selected background for this item, and will stay with the previous one. \nThis won't also disable the ripple and click highlight if you touch the item.\nThat's can also be seen in the sample app, the items which launch an activity are withSelectable(false) and the others not. So the other items can be selected as they do not launch an activity. Normaly this is done for items which switch fragments. \n. @mrneiverth maybe I just do not get the correct thing :D So probably a few images will help here ;)\n. @mrneiverth and you should prevent the default selection of the first element with:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#how-can-i-create-a-drawer-without-a-default-selection\nHmmm looks correct. \nYou might also considering to have the delay not for the drawer closing event but for the click listener to be fired. \nAs an addition if you still mean the touch highlight. You may use a wrong theme combination so the ripple is not visible?\n. @mrneiverth to be honest. I do not know this DesignDemo theme. I would highly recommend that you base your theme on one of the provided themes from the MaterialDrawer alternative you should add all material_drawer_* attributes to your theme\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/values/styles.xml#L230\n. @mneckoee I assume this happens because of this: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1542\nYou should use START and END as gravity so the RTL support works\n. @mneckoee have you tried my suggestion?\n. @mneckoee in this case I highly recommend to directly use the API of the underlaying FastAdapter \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter\nYou can get it by calling leftDrawer.getAdapter(). This allows you to deselect, select, ...\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L797\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L762\n. @mneckoee you can create your own CustomDrawerItems but that's up to you.

Showing the Keyboard when selection an EditText is Android specific, nothing the MaterialDrawer could alter. \nPlease report back. Close. We can still discuss and try to solve this in here\n. @grishko188 hi.\nAs the MaterialDrawer nor the FastAdapter calls methods on any other thread, than the thread you call these methods the issue is somewhere in your application. Make sure you set the selection on the correct thread. \nAs an additional note. The FastAdapter does not even call notifyItemChanged by default as: https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/4d33dc516c668f875d2f15e8fb9d6657c0d9cdaf/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L45 is false.  (if called from the onClick listener) \nYou might want to add more details like, does it happen via onClick or do you manually set the selection? When manually setting what else do you set? Is this method called on the UI thead\nThe withAdapter method can only be used before the Drawer was built, and before items were added. You should call this method directly after you provided the activity like:\njava\nnew DrawerBuilder().withActivity(this).withAdapter(...)...\n. I also want to add, that it is not necessary to send 3 e-mails just to get an anser on an issue. I really understand that some bugs are \"critical\" in some special circumstances and need a fast repsone. But you also have to remember that this is an Open Source project which is supported and done all in my free time. Today is saturday, so it's weekend. I have a normal day time job where I work between 38,5 - 50 hours a week. I spent about 10-20 hours a week answering questions, and supporting my libs. Everything for free. I assume that the app you want to release is paid or you get money for it. I do not get money for the library (I do not do open source for money, but just to clarify this). I am not sure how bugs or issues are handled in your company. But I have many years experience in a global successful agency and I know how support tickets are handled in big companies. Most companies have contracts which state that a support ticket has about 5 days to be solved and first response within the same working day. And that's for companies which call for 150\u20ac or more for a single hour. Please keep this in mind when sending 3 mails to an open source dev the next time. You might ask via one e-mail after a day (if you got no response) but don't expect an answer and solution within a few minutes. \n(And in your case. I answered in less than 3 hours which is a better service than most companies will offer...)\n. @grishko188 don't take me wrong. I really love to support my libs, and I always try to give best support as possible. But people need to understand that everything I do happens in my freetime and I really spend a lot of freetime for this. \n1.) Yeah you are right the deselect still needs the notifyItemUpdated because I do not have the view available anymore. But once again the onClick itself always happens on the UI-Thread. so everything in there happens on the UI-Thread. \nIf this really blocks the release of the app you should really consider of using a previous version of the support libraries. I can't change any issues / behaviors of the RecyclerView. You might want to open a platform bug on http://b.android.com/ if it seems to be an support library issue. \n2.) Yeah I see your point. Will adjust this in an update. Missed this when checking from my phone. \nJust for curiosity, what have you changed for your FastAdapter? \nI know, I work a lot with clients\n. 1.) select is not called by default from the onClick (https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/4d33dc516c668f875d2f15e8fb9d6657c0d9cdaf/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L709) just the deselect() \n2.) I just built 5.1.4-SNAPSHOT for you which contains the following commit https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/8acc78a24cebb8717f602cbd4dafa2c0f078b078 and uploaded it to the SNAPSHOT maven repo You need to add this to your root build.gradle (maven { url \"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\" })\nWhich issue have you found?\nYeah they are really new and changed a huge amount of things, so they are still a bit unstable. \n. Ok great. \n. @beaters you can either set the StatusBarColor via theme. Or later programatically via the DrawerLayout\njava\ndrawer.getDrawerLayout().setStatusBarBackgroundColor(color);\n. @utkarshns can you please add a screenshot? Or a photo describing your requirement a bit more? \nIf you want to modify paddings, etc from the MiniDrawerItem and MiniProfileDrawerItem you can do the following\nExtend the two items, or create them new (you can also copy paste them and alter their code):\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/MiniDrawerItem.java\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/MiniProfileDrawerItem.java\n(You want to take a closer look at this here too, required for compatiblity https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/MiniDrawerItem.java#L161)\nThen you also alter the layouts so the paddings fit your needs: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_mini.xml\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_mini_profile.xml\nAnd afterwards you have to extend the MiniDrawer and overwrite the following two methods to allow you custom MiniDrawerItem and MiniProfileDrawerItem to be used:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L240\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L259\nEDIT as noted in an other issue it might be also good to know that you can manually create the MiniDrawer as shown here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/fba4d8e2fa44eef392195573630c83f1f73c52ca/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MiniDrawerActivity.java\n. @utkarshns yes this will require the steps as written above. It is a bit more complicated (but possible) because the MaterialDrawer and all of its components focus to follow the Material Design Guidelines. \n. @utkarshns to exactly stick to the guideliens. You should consider using the MiniDrawer only on tablets, and not on phones. \n. @utkarshns who knows :D \nOh well then its fine :). If its on phones with huge screens it might work. Always be careful with such concepts. But as you will also make it a bit smaller (might consider just doing this on phones and not on tablets) it doesn't consume to much space from the content area\n. @utkarshns just for curiosity did this problem occur on Android N? Or just on API <= 23?\n. @utkarshns just had the chance to test the Android N preview on a Nexus 6 and the settings application from Google had exactly the same issue. Always jumped to top when an item was updated. Seems like the recyclerview of the support libraries has an issue here. \n. @utkarshns if you have improvements. I am always open for a pull request\n. @utkarshns the highlighted item is connected with the normal selection. Just select a different item. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#selecting-an-item\n. @utkarshns yeah because result is null before buildView() was called.\nYour app freezes? Just tried this does not happen in the sample app. \nBut I was wrong, you have to set the selection for the MiniDrawer and normal Drawer\njava\nresult.setSelection(identifier);\nminiResult.setSelection(identifier);\n. @jaycho19 the latest version of the MaterialDrawer requires the latest support libraries, and has to be compiled with compileSdk 23\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/build.gradle#L21\n. @EpsilonOrionis the question it what do you expect this method will do?\n. @EpsilonOrionis just tried it with the sample app. withSelectable(false) works. It prevents the item of having a selected state. Which does not mean that you can toggle the Switch, this can be handled with withSwitchEnabled(false) or withEnabled(false)\n. @kazisrabon sorry your questions are really confusing. \nYes you can open the drawer and close it via the Drawer object\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L123\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. @ibrahim132 do you recreate the activity on screen rotation? \n. @ibrahim132 perhaps your image is just to big, and the system can't probably recycle it upon a screen orientation change. Nothing the MaterialDrawer can prevent or handle\n. Close as it seems related to the size of the used resource. Can't reproduce it with the sample app. \nWe can still have a discussion here and try to fix it for you\n. @ibrahim132 can't reproduce this on any of my devices. \nAs mentioned the library can't change any logic which happens inside the setImageResource() as this is done by the support library. \nThe MaterialDrawer does not keep the drawable, nor does it leak the context.\nYou are sure nothing else on your side causes the OOM. \nYou might also check out the sample application and try to reproduce. \nThis might be related to: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1142\n. @ibrahim132 can't reproduce this on any of my devices. \nAs mentioned the library can't change any logic which happens inside the setImageResource() as this is done by the support library. \nThe MaterialDrawer does not keep the drawable, nor does it leak the context.\nYou are sure nothing else on your side causes the OOM. \nYou might also check out the sample application and try to reproduce. \nThis might be related to: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1142\n. @EpsilonOrionis as the avatar icon is loaded via the DrawerImageLoader this is already possible. And as the Header background can be set directly on the ImageView this is also possible ;)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L56\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L40\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\nFor the ImageView I think no example is required. \n. @EpsilonOrionis as you mentioned that glide provides the .error() function. I do not force any image loading behavior here. I just offer the listeners and you can implement any image loading lib you want. \nFor the header you can directly do it on the ImageView \n. @EpsilonOrionis sorry I can't give support for external libraries. \nSeems to be something glide specific. As mentioned the MaterialDrawer does not force any logic here. Everything is up to the dev.\nas of the documentation:\njava\nGlide  \n    .with( context )\n    .load(UsageExampleListViewAdapter.eatFoodyImages[0])\n    .listener( requestListener )\n    .error( R.drawable.cupcake )\n    .into( imageViewPlaceholder );\n. Starting with v5.1.4 the padding is removed when the arrow is hidden\n. @dejarno oh well you are right. Totally missed that the compact header has a slightly different layout here. \n. @jehad-suliman sorry this is nothing MaterialDrawer specific. the ActionBarDrawerToggle comes from google via the support libraries\n. @taimur97 just get the already existing ImageView of the background and alter the image\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L56\n. @or-dvir on which device do you test? which android version? which support libraries?\n.

I updated the interface of the IItemAdapter in version v1.2.5 of the FastAdapter. \nBoth the AboutLibraries and the MaterialDrawer use the FastAdapter as of the interface update, both need to be the latest version. \nMaterialDrawer at least v5.1.4\nAboutLibraries at least v5.5.9\n. @kakai248 as of v5.0.0 and upwards the MaterialDrawer depends on the fitsSystemWindows flag to manage the paddings and shadow behind the StatusBar everything is now handled by the system. \nIf this is possible with a normal DrawerLayout and the flags it is also possible with the MaterialDrawer. \nMore or less this was a good side effect of the previous implementation as paddings were managed manually (it required the fullscreen flag which had other side effects).\nI think the only way how you could get this working is to use 2 DrawerLayouts where one is fitsSystemWindows=true and the other one fitsSystemWindows=false (which will prevent any CollapsingToolbar behaviors etc. Content won't be possible to go behind the StatusBar)\nI highly recommend that you don't do this because this will add another view layer, and might cause lower performance. \n@christianguevara thanks. ;)\n. @RafaG just tried your sample for a while, but saw that it is just a module. Can you provide a whole project so I can open it with Android Studio?\n. @RafaG ok I checked it. In general the AccountHeader or all Headers go below the StatusBar this comes from the fitsSystemWindows flag. (And also forced here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerUtils.java#L239) \nIn general this is fine 99% because people have headers which can be behind the StatusBar \nSo as this is not the case in your application you have the easy option to just call:\njava\ndrawer.getRecyclerView().setPadding(drawer.getRecyclerView().getPaddingLeft(), activity.getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.materialize_statusbar), drawer.getRecyclerView().getPaddingRight(), drawer.getRecyclerView().getPaddingBottom());\nat the end of your MiDrawer ctor. This will add the needed padding at the top of the RecyclerView. Please also make sure that you wrap it in a if to just be apply it for devices starting with Android 6.0.0\n. @Gheoo the logcat does not show enough information. \nWhere does it close?

What do they do? Any click path they do until it crashes? \nI am sure it is no problem of the library, as many people use it without this issue, and if the class would be missing in the source it won't build with gradle and AndroidStudio\n. @carmas123 this should not be necessary. \nHave you checked out the sample app?

You might also provide a small sample showcasing the issue so I can debug it\n. @carmas123 yeah just send a project showcasing the above issue you have.

This is automatically handled by the DrawerLayout and the fitsSystemWindows flag. \nRemove the materializeNow() method. You do not need this any longer. \nSo you can also remove the getStatusBarHeight() method. \nFor the second issue. \nTook around 100 hundred years to get an ARM emulator with API 16 running :D, but i can't reproduce the issue you show in your screenshot. \n. @carmas123 ok after a closer look at your application.

With more research into this issue, I still was not able to get a OOM on my side. I only see normal memory usage. When switching to the profile list the first time it will need some more memory because the image loading library downloads the images and caches them in the ram. If I remove the images which are loaded from the web, there is just a tiny usage of memory for the switching of the list, but nothing which could result in an OOM\n.

Or just Drawer and left Drawer without a MiniDrawer \n. @juanagu do you need additional info regarding your issue? \nPlease let me know. I will close the issue for the time being ;)\n. @orcchg starting with v5.x.x the MaterialDrawer no longer manages paddings or sets any UI flags to do so. Everything is now handled and managed from the Android built in flag fitsSystemWindows and is so forwarded to the different layouts. \nFor a CollapsingToolbar there is also a sample activity:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java\nShowcasing how the CollapsingToolbar is handled. \n. @orcchg can't you just build the drawer in the activity and fill it's items from within the fragment? \n. @orcchg any update?\n. will be fixed in the next version \n. @denebchorny creating a custom ProfileDrawerItem  is as simple, as creating a normal custom DrawerItem \nFor your usecase I would recommend that you extend ProfileDrawerItem and just add the additional line which is required for your usecase. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java\nSo you will extend ProfileDrawerItem\nThen you Override getType()\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L185\nThen you Override getLayoutRes()\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L191\nThen you Override bindView() \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L196\nMake sure you call super.bindView() here. So you can keep the already existing logic, and you just add the binding for the additinal TextView you have.\nWe also have to Override getFactory() \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L252\nAnd provide a different ViewHolder with support for the additional field\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L262\nAnd last also a new ItemFactory which will create the ViewHolder for the Drawer\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L256\n(In case the above steps seem to confusing, just copy and paste the ProfileDrawerItem and just add the additional TextView you have, and the additional property. And change the Type and LayoutRes)\n. @ofirmiron nothing the MaterialDrawer can change. The DrawerLayout from the supportlib (which is used from the MaterialDrawer) adds the fading. You might find an issue regarding this on StackOverFlow. \nEDIT:  a quick search did not really result in any useful results. \nOne strange thing. Your Toolbar is also not fading. This happens in the sample app. The content area fades?\nThe scrim is painted here by the  DrawerLayout https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/master/v4/java/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.java#1292\n. @pokerazor a quick answer regarding 3.\nYou sadly can't use the Android-Iconics directly via the menu.xml as I have not yet found a way how to hook into the SupportMenuInflator (if someone has suggestions, it would be really awesome). \nThe only (and also preferred) solution is to set the  Android-Iconics icons via code to the Menu\nI will answer the other questions later today, as they might need a bit more time to answer. \n. Ok here's the answer regarding your fist 2 points.\n1.) The MiniDrawer is transparent by default. And takes the activity background. \nIf you want to alter this you can set the background color on the View of the MiniDrawer\njava\nView miniView = miniResult.build(this);\nminiView.setBackgroundColor(Color.RED);\nIn general the MiniDrawer and its items is built exactly to fit the Google Material Design Guidelines and it is not recommended to change it. If you really need this you will have to implement CustomMiniDrawerItems and alter the default values. Which is more complicated (but possible) I have written detailed instructions regarding this here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1090#issuecomment-195913322\nSomething else I tried a while ago was to alter the margins dynamically when the drawer was opened or closed but this might not the most performant solution. See more here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/8dd57feeeaa5190b13b9a203329a48510d0c07b3\n2.) Not really related to the MaterialDrawer. You might also just want to use a different theme which does not make the activity translucent and has a normal colored StatusBar or if you want it translucent and colored you may want to check out other libs doing this for you. \nNot sure if this helps: https://github.com/niorgai/StatusBarCompat (just found this after a quick google search)\n3.) Yeah I know. I also tried for quite a long time to get it working. But the only solution (as far as I have found) would be to copy and paste the whole SupportMenuInflater to the project, and I really do not want to do this, as it will cause problems accross support lib updates. For this feature to be possible I still wait for a possibility (like for the normal LayoutInflater) to hook into a custom MenuInflater.\nAs an additional information. Creating the items via Java comes with a lot of additional flexibility, as you will also be able to add a lot more different items, and properties, which are not possible via the XML\n. @smtrz I am not quite sure what you try to do? You want to programmatically set the selection on a subItem? \n. @smtrz you can set the selection via the Drawer object. Just use the identifier of the element you want to select: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L471\n. you define it via withIdentifier() when you create the item. It is automatically defined if you don't and you can get it via getIdentifier() from your item\n. each item can have an identifier. And you can then set the selection to an item with an identifier. \nEverything shown in the sample:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L216\n. @smtrz I just tried it in the sample. \nFirst I expand the ExpandableItem (you can only select sub items if they are visible)\njava\nresult.getAdapter().expand(result.getPosition(19));\nand then I set the selection:\njava\nresult.setSelection(2000, false);\nand it selects the sub item\n. @rubengees looking into it. \nYou are always one of the fastest updater :D\n. @rubengees yeah was missing my own upgrade notes of the FastAdapter. :/\nI think it's now the correct color as of the android material design guidelines. with prior versions it was not possible to have the icons properly colored on android devices pre API 21.\n. Which device do you have? On my device it is still the same color as on the screenshots in the README\n. I tested it on a Nexus 6P with Android 6.0.1. \nHave you done a clean build?\n. @NateShoffner thanks for answering\n. @robertmathew not reproduceable in the sample app. Has to be related to your implementation. \nWhat are you trying to do?\n. @vasiledoe sorry I only can give support for the latest version. It may be the case that this was not yet working in the prior version\n. @rubengees for the first you should be able to improve it by defining\njava\nresult.getAdapter().withSelectWithItemUpdate(true)\nthis will trigger an notifyItemChanged upon select. Normaly I will just setActiviated() and trust on the Android API to forward this state to the view. Seems like this does not happen in your case. \nThe later might be related to something else, as the  StickyFooter falls out from the FastAdapter and is just a normal LinearLayout\n. @rubengees I also can't reproduce the first one on my Nexus 6P with Android 6.0.1. \nWhere do you set the selection? And what happened before?\n. @rubengees sorry I am overdue with the second issue. I do not forget about it :D\n. @rubengees your first issue I can't reproduce. :/\n. Hmmm you have overwritten a color or something like this? \nWill close this now. You can reopen if you find out why this might be an issue in your app\n. I might have a deeper look probably I can catch this inside the drawer so it at least prevents the app from crashing if devs provide to large images\n. @dominicsavb that requires a lot of custom behavior. And I am not sure if it makes sense for you to use the MaterialDrawer for this\nIf you would want to do it with the MaterialDrawer you would have to remove all items from the MaterialDrawer (if you have a header, and normal items in) and when a click happens fill the drawer with the new items. \nAs the items above all are custom ones you have to create CustomDrawerItems with the style seen above, and depending on the clicks you have to fill / clear the drawer with the changed items\n. @yousofkakhki what do you mean with \"properly\" if you application is in RTL mode everything will automatically be correct\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=RTL\n. @vish30 ok thanks. I just tried it. First problem. I do not have the login data to login. \nSo I just had a closer look at your source code. And I have the feeling you use the MaterialDrawer wrong. \nYour DashboardActivity already hosts a DrawerLayout but this acitvity also hosts the Fragment which will then have the MaterialDrawer if you do it like this it will break in many ways, and the MaterialDrawer is not meant like this. You should really have the MaterialDrawer in the Activity and fill it with the items, depending on the scope you are. You can even lock the drawer, so it can't be opened, if you switch to a fragment which should not have a Drawer\n. @vish30 ok thanks. \nYeah still you can update the items of the MaterialDrawer at any time later, you can clear the current items, add new ones, update existing ones and so on. I remember a issue from the DrawerLayout and the use inside a Fragment which exactly sounds like the issue you have currently. But I can't find it right now. \nI still highly recommend that you do not have 2 DrawerLayouts in your application. (It might seems to work, but it has weird side effects)\n. @vish30 the MaterialDrawer allows you to have a slider on the right and on the left. \nSee the MultiDrawerActivity \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java\n. @vish30 the MaterialDrawer allows you to have a slider on the right and on the left. \nSee the MultiDrawerActivity \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java\n. @vish30 you can use it. as you can LOCK a specific side of the drawer, so it is not accessible at the other states. It will also make your view hirachy more flat\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html#setDrawerLockMode(int, int)\nEDIT: will answer the second part later\n. @vish30 you can use it. as you can LOCK a specific side of the drawer, so it is not accessible at the other states.

You might have to search android specific how a scrollvie will work within a RecyclerView and how both work together. I do not know this. And I also do not recommend to have a structure like this. It's really no good UX\n. http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=scrollview+inside+recyclerview\n. @power-alex why do you need this padding?\nThe Drawer does not alter the padding of the root view\n. Just tried it inside the DrawerActivity of the sample and it is working fine\n\n. @power-alex we can see as the padding is above the Toolbar \nAll the source code is available in the sample app repo. As said I just added paddingTop=40dp to the root view inside the layout used in the DrawerActivity sample\n. @power-alex ok great you solved it. but weird enough that it had a different behavior on your side\n. @power-alex ok great you solved it. but weird enough that it had a different behavior on your side\n. thx\n. thx\n. @mrudult you want it RTL or just a drawer with gravity right?\n. @mrudult you want it RTL or just a drawer with gravity right?\n. as soon as your application is API > 17 and is in RTL mode everything will automatically be on the right side. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=RTL\n. as soon as your application is API > 17 and is in RTL mode everything will automatically be on the right side. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=RTL\n. @DJafari If you do not depend on a MaterialDrawer theme you will have to provide the correct attributes for the day theme and the night theme.

Interesting behavior. \nYou might want to provide a small sample which allows me to try this out and provide a working solution for you\n. @rafakob the MaterialDrawer des not handle the insets of the view, nor does it handle any paddings. This is all handled by the Android system. So as you do not want the android system to handle this in your case, as we are already below the Toolbar just add the following to your builder\njava\n.withDrawerLayout(R.layout.material_drawer_fits_not)\n. Have you check out the CollapsingToolbarActivity https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java ?\n.

But I am not 100% sure anymore what the exact cause was\n. @henorek as of another issue (I don't find it right now) it is not really possible to host the DrawerLayout within a Fragment as it will somehow prevent the translucent statusbar. But I am not 100% sure anymore what the exact cause was\n. @henorek @mseroczynski I think this is related to the fact that your FrameLayout which is the fragment container does not pass the fitsSystemWindows forward. You need a layout which passes the insets forward so this will work. A fast google resulted into this:\nhttps://gist.github.com/cbeyls/ab6903e103475bd4d51b\nYou might also want to try the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout the Materialize library (which i have as dependency) contains. \nBeside the above, this is not a MaterialDrawer issue, but more a general handling of the fitsSystemWindows flag inside fragmetns\n. @Rexee oh yes you are right. \nThank you\n. @cardovaeric sorry this is not related to the MaterialDrawer. The ActionBarDrawerToggle is part from the support libraries of Android. You should google if there is a possibility to have a badge on the ActionBarDrawerToggle or if you need a custom component for this\n. @troy21688 no this issue is not related to the MaterialDrawer the warniing you get here:\n04-19 12:46:57.615 1316-1316/com.sourcey.materialloginexample W/dalvikvm: Unable to resolve superclass of Lcom/mikepenz/materialdrawer/view/BezelImageView$CustomOutline; (2232)\n04-19 12:46:57.615 1316-1316/com.sourcey.materialloginexample W/dalvikvm: Link of class 'Lcom/mikepenz/materialdrawer/view/BezelImageView$CustomOutline;' failed\n04-19 12:46:57.615 1316-1316/com.sourcey.materialloginexample E/dalvikvm: Could not find class 'com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.view.BezelImageView$CustomOutline', referenced from method com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.view.BezelImageView.onSizeChanged\n04-19 12:46:57.615 1316-1316/com.sourcey.materialloginexample W/dalvikvm: VFY: unable to resolve new-instance 5293 (Lcom/mikepenz/materialdrawer/view/BezelImageView$CustomOutline;) in Lcom/mikepenz/materialdrawer/view/BezelImageView;\n04-19 12:46:57.615 1316-1316/com.sourcey.materialloginexample D/dalvikvm: VFY: replacing opcode 0x22 at 0x000a\n0\nis no issue.

You can even try the sample app on Android 6.0.1 and it will work without any issues. There must be something else causing your issue. \nYour provided code sample looks fine. Can't tell from this one what possibly could go wrong\n. I temporary close this until new details were added\n. @troy21688 I have seen it. And I would really love to investigate it. As already mentioned the MaterialDrawer always runs with the latest version of the support libraries. And is tested on API 10 - API 23 (Android N also works -> preview 2 has tiny issues with andorid iconics, but does not impact the drawer) \nYour described issues are really new and were not reported so I assume some other combination must somehow result in this\n. @danielgomezrico thank you.

Thank you so much\n. @fliespl yeah that something you have to handle on your side, as it is a really special use case. The drawer can't detect if items, and positions, and possible even identifier change. \nDepending on how complex your behavior is I would recommend that you remember the current position (with position I might mean the current section which is selected) and you just select the correct item after orientation change. \nFor the expanded items you also have to do the same, but it is a bit more complex depending on how many expandable sectiosn you have\n. @vasiledoe how fast do you do your remove / recreate iterations?

Make sure you return false for normal items, and true for ProfileDrawerItems \njava\nresult.getAdapter().withOnPreClickListener(new FastAdapter.OnClickListener<IDrawerItem>() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onClick(View v, IAdapter<IDrawerItem> adapter, IDrawerItem item, int position) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        });\nEDIT forgot about the onProfileImageClick listener. \nProvide one for the AccountHeaderBuilder and return true to state that you consumed the event. \n``` java\n.withOnAccountHeaderProfileImageListener(new AccountHeader.OnAccountHeaderProfileImageListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public boolean onProfileImageClick(View view, IProfile profile, boolean current) {\n                        return false;\n                    }\n                @Override\n                public boolean onProfileImageLongClick(View view, IProfile profile, boolean current) {\n                    return false;\n                }\n            })\n\n```\nthis will then allow you to show the dialog. if he is allowed you can then select the profile programmatically\n. @yalis great :)\nYour changes also look good ;) Thanks\n. @toastking42 I will have to reproduce it first in the sample, and then I will implement a fix. I should have some time for this tomorrow evening.\n. I can't reproduce the overdrawing, but i have fixed the issue that the profile is shown even if disabled\nwill be in the next release\n. @toastking42 the new version is already released. \nweird I tried exactly your steps, but didn't see it. might forcing the recreation of the items of the MiniDrawer will help?\n. probably an instant run exception?\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. @meNESS you want the StickyFooter ;)\n. @swapnilsaha2010 https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L989\n. which version of the drawer do you use?\n. @swapnilsaha2010 probably you are doing it on the Drawer instead the DrawerBuilder?\n. @toastking42 if you just set the enabled state this will not really work. you should always use the methods from the drawer to select an item. result.setSelection() ( and fire the event so everything is passed to the MiniDrawer)\nyou create everthing as shown in the sample? it should correctly forward the events to the MiniDrawer and in the opposite way\n. @toastking42 and if you set the selection and trigger the event:\njava\ndrawer.setSelection(1L, true)\nIt may seem a bit weird, but the thing is that the MiniDrawer is not depply wired into the Drawer and both more or less work independent from each other. They just communicate with each other via the events which are triggered. \nYou can disable it in the Drawer. Notify the drawer about the changed item, and then you just recreate the items in the `MiniDrawer``\njava\nminiDrawer.createItems()\n. @toastking42 and if you set the selection and trigger the event:\njava\ndrawer.setSelection(1L, true)\nIt may seem a bit weird, but the thing is that the MiniDrawer is not depply wired into the Drawer and both more or less work independent from each other.

You can then just get the reference to the view from the AccountHeader object and set your listener on it or whatever you need. \nYou will then just need to define a profile, notify the header about the change and it will show the infos.

But the Material Design Guidelines do not suggest this, and I also highly recommend that you stay with those guidelines. \nIt uses the DrawerLayout but the MaterilaDrawer also just uses the DrawerLayout. If you keep the default behavior the DrawerLayout will be in the root (as in the SO question) with fitsSystemWindows=true\n. I assume this is no issue related to the MaterialDrawer but more to the hirachy how it's set up and the default behavior of the DrawerLayout from google\n. @jhmacdon yeah those changed slightly but in general it's the same.

Weird. :/\nAlso with a layout like this one: https://github.com/lh123/volunteer/blob/cad083101a698489e0cb92299888c7f35243db4f/app/src/main/res/layout/navigation_foot.xml ?\n. @Fiks33 the BezelImageView requires you to provide a square image. And I think you do not provide one as of your screenshot\n. @Fiks33 you might also be able to overwrite the header layout and define a different scaly type?\n. It might help if you copy this layout over to your project, and modify the scaleType \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml#L9 (for all 4 BezelImageViews)\nIf this does not work you will have to make your image as square, proably via an Picasso or Glide transformator :D or how those post processors are called\n. @Fiks33 the easiest would be if you copy over the material_drawer_header.xml to your project in layouts and add android:scaleType=\"matrix\" to the BezelImageViews. So it will look like:\n``` xml\n\n<ImageView\n    android:id=\"@+id/material_drawer_account_header_background\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n

ProfileDrawerItem layout to get the same for this item too. Its layout is: material_drawer_item_profile.xml\n. @shimika you have created a custom DrawerItem or do you provide a xml resource, or view to the StickyFooter?\n. @shimika yes there is a method in the MaterialDrawer setting the padding for drawerItems in the footer because Material Design Guidelines state 8dp. This method is required as API 17 has a bug and looses the padding otherwise. \nthe only solution here is that you do not provide your item as DrawerItem but just the layout, or view.\nEDIT it works for the addDrawerItems as there this is not explicitely set in general but through the item itself, for the StickyDrawerItem this is called at a differnet position as those items are not displayed in an RV but rather in a LL\n. Oh great :) Good point. Thanks\n. @rubengees it might come because you have not defined a size for the Icon you should always define an explicit size for the IconicsDrawable\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L423\nOtherwhise it might not be able to measure the correct size and it will result in displaying bad.\n(Just to be sure, you did not test it on Android N Preview 2? There is a known issue with Preview 2, but I will only check it if it persists in Preview 3 as it was not in Preview 1)\n. Oh ok :D just was in the progress of answering. \nNo problem ;)\n. @yunarta oh thank you so much. You are right. This is related to the fact that the SecondaryDrawerItem is now subclassed as it is exakt the same as the PrimaryDrawerItem just with a different layout. I might should also point this out in the MIGRATION.md. Thanks you!\n. @yunarta you just use default items? \nFor 4. are the PrimaryDrawerItems showing or not? I am a bit confused because of the 'but' in 5.\n. @yunarta just tried this in the sample app and is reproduceable. Will debug this one tomorrow.\nEDIT: What's really interesting. I do not call setEnabled on the PrimaryDrawerItem :O https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=setEnabled\nAnd no call inside the FastAdapter either:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=setEnabled&type=Code\nWill fix this tomorrow then\n. @yunarta I found the reason for this issue. It comes from here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/crossfader/view/CrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout.java#L69 \nWere I will disable all views of the normal drawer as content area of the Crossfader would otherwhise pass trough the click events, and trigger actions on the drawer. \nI also found a good solution for this and will include it in the next update\n. @soheilserver you can disable it for all. Otherwhise you just return true inside the click listener to consume the event.\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1042\n. @RezaOruji no. The icon will only be in the right in true RTL mode. If you want the icon on the right you will have to implement your own CustomDrawerItem \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=CustomDrawerItem\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/32066618/materialdrawer-customdraweritem/32543209#32543209\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31030595/how-to-customize-the-draweritem-using-the-lib-mikepenz-materialdrawer/32542999#32542999\n(Note the stackoverflow questions have the old interface of the IDrawerItem. You will also see a few custom ones in the sample app: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems)\n. @MrThiago you also have to notify the MiniDrawer about the updated item: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L384\n. @moderateepheezy please provide a bit more information. Or the full crash log. With the above I can't really say anything\n. @moderateepheezy you can either define an url for the ProfileDrawerItem or a drawable, there is no possibility for both. You can define the placeholder in a differnet location. \nPlease see here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\n. @rmunk there is the setSelectedProfile method on the AccountHeader\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L181\nJust select the correct profile after building:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L216\n. @soheilserver the type should be a fixed value. So \"RADIO\" was fine. \nI am not quite sure what you do with removeAllItems() and so on. \nYou might provide some details about your implementation. (code :D)\nWhat you always have to keep in mind. Items are reused by the Adapter so you have to make sure in the bindView() method everything is done to get the item you need, you can not depend on the view you get. because it may has data set from the previous item which used this items view. \n--> That's how a RecyclerView works. It reuses views based on the type we define. (The drawer works a bit more generic thanks to the FastAdapter so you don't have to write the Adapter logic you normally would have to write if you go the normal route via a RV)\n. @soheilserver there are 2 possibilities how the FastAdapter can be configured. Either it will use the normal setActivated() method on the view and will Android allow to handle everything via the view states, or the setting which will cause a notifyItemChanged on the Adapter\nBy default it uses the setActivated() way: \nhttps://github.com/sathishmscict/FastAdapter/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L45\nSo the only thing I could think of here is that you changed this configuration on the FastAdapter (Drawer.getAdapter().withSelectWithItemUpdate(true))\nOtherwise it may be related to your layout or something like this which I can not prevent or change on the side of the FastAdapter\n. @danielgomezrico because you have an Header right? The header counts as position 0 and everything works with the absolut position\n. @Arathus you want to search a SecondaryDrawerItem by it's id or you have the SecondaryDrawerItem and want to get the id?\nBecause there is the method getIdentifier()\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/AbstractDrawerItem.java#L47\n. @Arathus ah I see your issue. You missuse the Identifier of the  DrawerItems as the views identifier which is a different one. \nThe issue is that there is no unique identifier which you can use, as there may be more than one SecondaryDrawerItems in your current drawer, so the identifier can't be used. The view also can't be used as this one is not known by the item, as views are reused inside the RecyclerView which is used inside the Drawer \nThe only thing which might work is that you get the RecyclerView from the Drawer and get the View from a specific position within the RecyclerView but note that this might also fail if the user was to fast and scrolled before the intro screen was shown. \nBut retrieving a view from a position in a RecyclerView is then not related to this library\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L214\n. As mentioned this is a complex behavior as the items are in a RecyclerView so no static content as it would normally be for a intro activity\n. @Arathus things changed a lot since the version where the drawer used a ListView \nI switched to RecyclerView  starting with v4.0.0 \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md\n. @Mahmudul531 because the library depends on v23.3.0 of the support libraries. \nIf you want to use previous versions I do not give support if bugs occur. And you should also check Stackoverflow on how to exclude a specific dependency of a library..\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/20016971/325479\n. @sarvajeet294 the issue is in the MiniDrawer? Or does the normal drawer show wrong items? \nIf it's the MiniDrawer you just need to call the following method:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L401\nThis will recreate the MiniDrawer with the new items from the main Drawer\n. @sarvajeet294 sorry this is not related to this library. You have the listeners and then you can do whatever action is needed  in your app. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/build.gradle#L70\nIt's an external library. Which is used here. \n. @auchri the SecondaryDrawerItem() extends from the PrimaryDrawerItem() and has the same methods. Will it crash or fail on your side?\n. @ruifeng2357 you can implement CustomMiniDrawerItems which look like the one in your screenshot. \nI think this answer: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1150#issuecomment-205445293 and the answer linked in this one will help you \n. @rezawm you also have to overwrite getType() as you can see here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems/CustomCenteredPrimaryDrawerItem.java\n. @rezawm hi. \nJust get your parent item, add / remove / change the sub items, and then you can call the notify method on the adapter. \nThe adapter can be retrieved via Drawer.getAdapter()\nHere's the method you should call: notifyAdapterSubItemsChanged(int globalPosition)\nhttps://github.com/sathishmscict/FastAdapter/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L1231\n. @rezawm that's weird. You are sure the event is not fired by something else? \nThe code correctly sets the StringHolder no matter if you provide it via String or int-res\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDrawerItem.java#L99\n. @rezawm to be honest. I do not know how this can be possible. because a ctor can't return null. it has to be set. do you overwrite it somewhere?\n. Haha I know probably know why you are confused. \nThe getName() returns the StringHolder and it's toString() method returns \"null\" in this case, as it can't resolve the string without a Context \nIf you do the following:\njava\n((PrimaryDrawerItem) drawerItem).getName().getText(view.getContext())\nYou get the correct name\n. Set this to false to disable the account selection with only one profile:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L547\n. @brunochichava you will have to implement 2 different logics in your code. For phones you keep the normal. and for tablets you for example implement it like the CrossfadeDrawer sample. Or you just call .buildView() and just add the drawers content wherever you want it \n. The drawer adds this padding because it is default for all items inside the Material Design Guidelines. As there is an issue with API 17 I have to set this programatically in this line:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L104\nYou might also want to post the DrawerItems you use, as the screenshot does not look like you use the default items. \nIf you already create your own CustomDrawerItem you just want to set the padding to 0px again (If you extend from the BasePrimaryDrawerItem) If you do not extend from it you should be fine. \nThe drawer does not set this padding on the items anywhere else than here. \n. Your item still extends from the BaseSecondaryDrawerItem which will in the end also extend from the BasePrimaryDrawerItem which defines the padding at the end:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L104\nYou have to set the padding to 0dp after the bindViewHelper(viewHolder); \njava\nviewHolder.view.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);\n. withEnabled(false). If you do not want it to be greyed out, you can also set it withSelectable(false) and return false inside the clicklistener when it is called\n. Please follow the instructions ins the README:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#1-provide-the-gradle-dependency\nYour issue happens when you don'T have the transitive=ture because it won't resolve this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize\n. @roughboy what's the thame you are using?\n. @roughboy you do not want the drawer to go below the StatusBar right?\nshould be fine. in the sample app it's done exactly like this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/NonTranslucentDrawerActivity.java\n. so just remove this: .withTranslucentStatusBar(false)\nYou can not have a non translucent drawer but the header below/behinid the statusbar\n. @roughboy with v5.0.0 there was a huge change in most behaviors as the MaterialDrawer no longer manages those paddings. This is done via the fitsSystemWindows flag which is handled by the system...\n. Hi @roughboy I just checked your code. It might work for your application, but this is not the proper solution for the MaterialDrawer. \nFor the StickyHeader you explicitely set the padding of the RecyclerView also for the header which is not good, as the StickyHeaderView is completely independent from the RecyclerView and those paddings are not tight together. \nFor the second padding you changed. Your line of code is unnecessary as you just set the padding of the RecyclerView back to the same values. The other thing is that it is correct to have 0dp padding for a normal header as the header should go up to the top of the RecyclerView the RecyclerView shouldn't go beyond the StatusBar if the fitsSystemWindows flags are set correctly\n. Close as you solved it for your case. In general the behavior shouldn't be such a problem\n. that sounds really strange. you just use normal DrawerItems?\n. Hmmm shouldn't necessarily. Can you provide some code to showcase your issue or provide a sample application?\n. @shalevmo close until new details are provided. \n. @roshakorost you might want to do a pull request for this change\n. Ok great. Thank you. I will merge as soon as I'm back from IO\n. @crestf you are searching for the DrawerLayout feature called LockMode you can set a LockMode for a Slider-View or Gravity on the DrawerLayout which then blocks the user from opening it.\nHere's the documentation for it:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html#setDrawerLockMode(int, int)\nOk just read that you already came along with the LockMode for the Back-Arrow to still toggle the NavigationDrawer how do you switch it to the BackArrow? You might want to check out the AdvancedSample which also switches from Hamburger to Arrow and the Arrow will close the activity in this case. \n. @treejames what were you trying?\n. @HamedGh for your question you can achieve this with the following setting:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L216\nWhat else do you want to adjust?\n. @HamedGh hmmm to get a Divider inside the Profiles section the easiest would be to create an item similar to the DividerDrawerItem but it should also implement IProfile  so you can add it to the accounts too, and you just need to make it not selectable so it won't show up in the header and can't be selected\n. @HamedGh it is nearly correct. Just 2 things. First your item should also have the proper generic type defined for the AbstractDrawerItem which i have fixed for you here:\n``` java\npublic class AccountDividerDrawerItem extends AbstractDrawerItem implements IProfile {\n    @Override\n    public int getType() {\n        return com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.id.material_drawer_profile_item_divider;\n    }\n@Override\n@LayoutRes\npublic int getLayoutRes() {\n    return com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.layout.material_drawer_item_divider;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void bindView(ViewHolder viewHolder) {\n    Context ctx = viewHolder.itemView.getContext();\n\n    //set the identifier from the drawerItem here. It can be used to run tests\n    viewHolder.itemView.setId(hashCode());\n\n    //define how the divider should look like\n    viewHolder.view.setClickable(false);\n    viewHolder.view.setEnabled(false);\n    viewHolder.view.setMinimumHeight(1);\n    ViewCompat.setImportantForAccessibility(viewHolder.view,\n            ViewCompat.IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_NO);\n\n    //set the color for the divider\n    viewHolder.divider.setBackgroundColor(UIUtils.getThemeColorFromAttrOrRes(ctx, com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.attr.material_drawer_divider, com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.color.material_drawer_divider));\n\n    //call the onPostBindView method to trigger post bind view actions (like the listener to modify the item if required)\n    onPostBindView(this, viewHolder.itemView);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic ViewHolderFactory<ViewHolder> getFactory() {\n    return new ItemFactory();\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withName(String name) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic StringHolder getName() {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withEmail(String email) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic StringHolder getEmail() {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withIcon(Drawable icon) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withIcon(Bitmap bitmap) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withIcon(@DrawableRes int iconRes) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withIcon(String url) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withIcon(Uri uri) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic AccountDividerDrawerItem withIcon(IIcon icon) {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic ImageHolder getIcon() {\n    return null;\n}\n\npublic static class ItemFactory implements ViewHolderFactory<ViewHolder> {\n    public ViewHolder create(View v) {\n        return new ViewHolder(v);\n    }\n}\n\nprotected static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n    private View view;\n    private View divider;\n\n    private ViewHolder(View view) {\n        super(view);\n        this.view = view;\n        this.divider = view.findViewById(com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.id.material_drawer_divider);\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nAnd a second thing you might notice. I have chagned the identifier within the getType() method, because this has to be unique and can't be reused accross items. (Internal cache handling of the RecyclerView) Afterwards it works fine ;)\n. @meddd sure. You want to have the \"add\" in the header? . you can set static values for the lines in the header, and just add no profiles at all to the account list. \n. @iToxicDeveloper please check out the sample application. Your code is correct but misses a small bit. You also have to provide the Activity to the DrawerBuilder\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L105\n. @Shajeel-Afzal \nYes you can have a left and you can have a right Drawer. See the MultiDrawerActivity Sample for this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java\nYes you can also have a custom view on one of those drawers, obtain it and commit a fragment on it.\n. Thank you\n. @ArunPandiyan there is a different mode inside the Crossfader which can exactly do what you are searching for. Just enable it via: https://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/crossfader/Crossfader.java#L52\n. @manabreak do you use the latest version of the drawer? \n. Can you provide a sample showcasing your issue? I really can't reproduce it when using your code (sligthly modified it to add 10 items with 50 sub items)\n``` java\nprivate void createDrawerItems() {\n        result.removeAllItems();\n    List<IDrawerItem> subItems = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    for (int ii = 0; ii < 10; ii++) {\n        // Create all the sub-items for the expandable list\n        for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n            subItems.add(new SecondaryDrawerItem()\n                    .withName(i + \"\")\n                    .withLevel(2));\n        }\n\n        // Create the expandable drawer item\n        result.addItem(new ExpandableDrawerItem()\n                .withName(\"subsubs\")\n                .withSelectable(false)\n                .withSubItems(subItems));\n    }\n\n    result.setSelectionAtPosition(0, false);\n}\n\n``\n. @manabreak close until new details are provided\n. @Abo-Hani great that you solved your issue\n. @Abo-Hani in general you should just have 1 drawer in your fist activity (only in some cases it makes sense to have drawers in sub activities) So in general your drawer should switch betweenFragments` if you want to keep everything in the upper hierarchy. If this shouldn't be the case in your application you can launch activities. \nSo for the general \"un-smooth\" animation when opening activity and closing the drawer, you have to options to delay one of the two things. Either you can delay the drawer close so it is not visible at all, or you delay the activity open to only happen after the drawer finished closing. \nYou can do those things via:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1085\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1102\n. @Abo-Hani having Fragments is nothing MaterialDrawer specific, you just have to set / \"commit\" your fragment as soon as the event is called. There are a few open source projects available which do this using the MaterialDrawer I also think this was already asked / answered a while back\n@ismail-s thanks for adding yours here too ;)\n. @grote the exception is thrown from the underlying architecture and the mikepenz package name just shows up because it passes the issue through. I'm afraid I can't do anything against this. It might need to be opened on the Xposed thread or so. Seems they break the VectorDrawable in a really weird way.\nSorry that I can't help here\n. @ApotheoKing you can provide any custom DrawerItems you want. Just search for \"CustomDrawerItem\" in the issues here in GitHub or on Stackoverflow this was asked already a few times ;)\nNo I don't think the DrawerLayout will allow you to have \"wrap_content\" as it needs an exact width to calculate all the things. You can set the width dynamically via code though. \n. @digital-prime sorry for the late answer. I was at the Google IO so I was a bit limited to GitHub. \nI see a few problems with your issue / solution. \nThe first issue is. You do not use the default behavior when creating the Drawer you use the .buildView() method which won't inflate and add the DrawerLayout for you. So the Drawer does not know about the DrawerLayout and it won't handle it for you. \nIf you want a DrawerLayout in the root of your activity I suggest to use the .build() method which will then result in everything being handled for you automatically. You will also be able to call Drawer.getDrawerLayout() then to retrieve the managed DrawerLayout \nas of openDrawer() and closeDrawer() those methods are meant to open and close it. Not to lock it. \nAfter that you will be able to LOCK /  UNLOCK the Slider of the Drawer using the platform methods. You may need to use the GravityCompat.START to get the correct view locked. \nYou may want to check the different lock modes here:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html#LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED\n. Ah ok I see. Great that you solved it\n. @danielgomezrico you can provide Drawables and there is a VectorDrawableCompat which should do the job:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/graphics/drawable/VectorDrawableCompat.html?utm_campaign=android_launch_supportlibrary23.2_022216&utm_source=anddev&utm_medium=blog\n. Great ;)\n. @Shajeel-Afzal if you provide the Toolbar to the MaterialDrawer it will automatically use the ActionBarDrawerToggle from Google which can't be changed. You will have to remove the withToolbar() part and handle opening / closing etc on your own. You may then also be able to define different icons, behaviors etc. \n@ismail-s thanks for answering here ;)\n. @or-dvir not he MaterialDrawer does no network calls or do not have any dependencies which may would do a network call. (None of my libraries does network calls nor has any dependencies doing network calls). Some sample projects contain a image loading library, but the libraries themself don't\nIf you have an image loader or anything used in your project it may be related to this one. \n. @gmltA you can provide any RecyclerView you want with withRecyclerView(). This will then be picked. \nSee what's done automatically otherwhise:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1576\n. @gmltA you can also just retrieve the RecyclerView from the built drawer and alter the padding afterwards\n. @manojkumarmeerut I am not sure what's your problem.\nIf you want to use it as library just follow the README:\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.2.7@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\nDone. \n. @Aeefire no not really. the latest support libs are already used in this lib. \nwhat repository have you in your root build.gradle?\n. if you have mavenCentral first?\n. @Aeefire normally this sounds like you miss the transitive part?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#1-provide-the-gradle-dependency\nBut as you posted above you have it in your project. \nPerhaps you can send me a zip with the project and I try it?\n. @Aeefire great that it's working now\n. @initru yes the right shadow is automatically set and can't be removed as it is an essential part of the Material Design Guidelines \nWhat may could work (I have not tested it) if you add a drawable which is transparent only to your project and name it like this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/drawable/material_drawer_shadow_right.9.png\nOtherwhise this needs a change in the drawer itself. \n. @vanniktech if you really need such a custom behavior which is not in the design guidelines you still have the option to overwrite the xml used for the AccountHeader add this view, and build everything as normal. You then just have to get the view of the AccountHeader search for the Icon set it and place an onClickListener on it (which still has the issue that the touch target of this icon is far to small) \n. @vanniktech yeah you can alter nearly everything. I have planned to keep the library features as far as possible to the material design guideliens\n. The events of the ProfileSettingDrawerItem in the account section are also triggered via the onProfileChanged event:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L89\n. @HamedGh creating a CustomDrawerItem which has an additional TextView beside the normal one. (perhaps replacing the badge view)\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=CustomDrawerItem\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/32066618/materialdrawer-customdraweritem\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31030595/how-to-customize-the-draweritem-using-the-lib-mikepenz-materialdrawer/32542999#32542999\nThere are also a few in the sample app code\n. Can you clean your project and install it again? \nSeems like some resources may be mixed up in your project. \nHave you modified any images or anything else? \n. @DearDhruv your issue looks really weird and I am not sure if this is related to the MaterialDrawer at all. It seems like the default android system selector drawables are somehow broken. (those do not come from the the MaterialDrawer) \nThe selected drawable of an item and the selected drawable for the ActionBarDrawerToggle are both the normal selectedItemBackground which is an Android ressource / appcompat ressource and nothing handled from me\n. When you run the sample app do you have any issues?\nDearDhruv notifications@github.com schrieb am Do., 26. Mai 2016, 14:34:\n\nI've tried many things but no success for now.\nI'll try creating new project with same lib and import all the project\nthere if things go ok.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1297#issuecomment-221858255\n\nMike Penz\n\nMike Penz\nAndroid | Backend | Open Source | Web Developer\nmikepenz.com\nlanora.io\n. Might be related to this lib?\n\ngradle\ncompile 'com.github.rey5137:material:1.2.2'\n. @JesseBlackman what do you mean with it doesn't get updated. Will it stay the old profile, or doesn't it get the selection? The identifier is correct for sure?\n. I am not sure why it should not work. But if you check the following of the sample app: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java#L169\nThis works. (updateProfile does the same as updateProfileByIdentifier) \n. @rohithn you can overwrite the default values if you need. But I do not recommend this as those are the correct ones defined in the Material Design Guidelines. And It may make it look worse. \nJust set the following value in your dimen.xml\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml#L25\n. You can set a Drawable as background. You should find on StackOverflow how to create a https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/GradientDrawable.html in Android\n. @vuminhkhang1995 ah yeah you are right. Sorry I missed that this is part of the default behavior as the default items are created to fit the Material Design Guidelines \nYou would need to create a CustomDrawerItem which allows you to set any background you want. \nIt does not have to be as complicated as the default items are, but just in case here's where I set the background:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L81\nHere are some samples of CustomDrawerItems\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems\n. @alexf1 you do not consume the event, and you enable it on the builder. \n. return false; to not consume the click event:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/64876f50843165d90b29accfd2031f5c6e6720c9/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L1041\nenabling the close on click here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/64876f50843165d90b29accfd2031f5c6e6720c9/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1042\nThen it should be fine. If not, you may have some other configuration or so which blocks this\n. @alexf1 oh I think in your case it's the fact that you use the CrossfadeDrawerLayout and the miniDrawer. \nI assume you want it to close when the MiniDrawer is clicked?\n. @alexf1 ok for the MiniDrawer to close the DrawerLayout you have to do the following:\njava\n        miniResult.withOnMiniDrawerItemClickListener(new FastAdapter.OnClickListener<IDrawerItem>() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onClick(View v, IAdapter<IDrawerItem> adapter, IDrawerItem item, int position) {\n                result.closeDrawer();\n                return false;\n            }\n        });\n. @alexf1 I added this code to the CrossfadeDrawerActivity of the sample application and it worked. Anything else you have defined?\n. @alexf1 where did you define the listener from above? You can compare it with the CrossfadeDrawerLayout sample from here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CrossfadeDrawerLayoutActvitiy.java#L108\nI just added the above code in line 108 as linked above:\njava\n        miniResult.withOnMiniDrawerItemClickListener(new FastAdapter.OnClickListener<IDrawerItem>() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onClick(View v, IAdapter<IDrawerItem> adapter, IDrawerItem item, int position) {\n                result.closeDrawer();\n                return false;\n            }\n        });\n. @alexf1 hmmm I am not sure, as mentioned I tested it in the sample application and there it worked. \nYou may can send me the part of the project so I can debug it what may differes on your side\n. @jahirfiquitiva that's quite weird. Do you set your own font or typeface anywhere?\n. Which makes it even weird, as those are all the same items. \nWhich device are you on? Which android version?\n. @jahirfiquitiva if you do a clean install (without instant run)?\n. @jahirfiquitiva will this look like this instantly upon launch or only after clicking and selecting some items?\n. @jahirfiquitiva can you please send an apk of the app so I can test it on my device?\nThe weird thing is I do not set any typeface or anything depending on the state of the item. So the font is just defined within the material_drawer_item_primary.xml \nI have no clue why it happens in your app, can't reproduce it in any of mine. \n. @jahirfiquitiva yes you can also send it via hangouts\n. @jahirfiquitiva on a Nexus 6P with Android N this is not noticeable at all :/\n. @jahirfiquitiva it's weird. As mentioned no font style or something is defined programatically all comes from the xml. So perhaps they have some wrong binaries and render text wrong? \nI also have seen that your icon template still uses the old version of Android-Iconics please update to the latest to fix the Android N Preview 2 & Preview 3 alignment issue. \n. well it is the default. you can modify the layouts or create a CustomDrawerItem if you need custom look and feel. well it is the default. you can modify the layouts or create a CustomDrawerItem if you need custom look and feel. @xsorifc28 does this also happen in the SampleApp?\n. @xsorifc28 the sample app uses the latest AppCompat libraries so it should be fine. Have you done a clean run (clean build)? \nAny other libraries which may alter the styles of a Switch? \n. @xsorifc28 yeah I assume that something alters with the general Switch so I expect that your issue is not related to this lib. Just try to place a android.support.v7.widget.SwitchCompat somewhere else in the app and look how it behaves. \n. hmmm if you just change the build tools? would this make a difference?\nIf this does not help I am also quite unsure what could break the images. sorry :/\n. so you may should report this or look if this was already reported in the android bugtracker\n. @s-p-a-r-k you can implement any CustomDrawerItem that you want. You can have a look at the source code of both, and just combine their functionality. (remember the default items are very very flexible so they have many features in which you may not need for you application) \nThe sample application also contains some sample CustomDrawerItems. \nJust search the issues section for CustomDrawerItem and you will find enough results. \n. There is this guide how to properly use the AppCompatDelegate with normal activites;\nThe DrawerBuilder itself should not require anything AppCompatActivity specific\nhttps://medium.com/google-developer-experts/how-to-add-toolbar-to-an-activity-which-doesn-t-extend-appcompatactivity-a07c026717b3#.t28mgccfy\n. @misoza I don't see why it wouldn't work. AppCompat dependency is required for the DrawerLayout but should work with the AppCompatDelegate as shown in the link description. Which will also allow the toolbar ;). \nI hope it helps.\nIf it does not work. You still can just decide to only change this Activity, and switch to a normal AppCompatActivity and move all the \"list\" behavior of the ListActivity to a normal ListView (just for this activity)\n. @roher-roher I do not recommend to change the text size as it is correct as of the Google Material Design Guidelines. It will adjust to the phones settings as it is defined in sp \nIf you really want to change the size (breaking the guidelines) you can do this by overwriting the text size values via your dimens.xml file.\nHere's the text size defined for the PrimaryDrawerItem \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml#L37\n. @olmur could you please add a screenshot to describe a bit more what you want to achieve?\n. @olmur there is no default item included in the library doing this. But there is already a CustomDrawerItem (source code provided via the sample) available: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/b1d0e37254d18a908b2a6a75be8a005924fffd4a\nJust add it to your project, name it as you need it and use it as normal. ;). \nFunny enough this came up only past week :D First time after a few years xD\nSee the following question :D https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1274\n. @jahirfiquitiva what do you mean? Where do you want to use this icon? \n. @jahirfiquitiva that is not possible and can't be added to the MaterialDrawer \nThe MaterialDrawer uses the ActionBarDrawerToggle provided from the Appcompat library. This one has a fixed style and can't be modified. There are open source projects which offer you a separate icon or style like the following:\nhttps://github.com/balysv/material-menu\nBut using this or any custom icons you define as the NavigationIcon will require that you will have to handle the open / close events on your own. \nSo you won't provide the toolbar and then you will hook on the general navigation listeners and if the users click you can then open / close the Drawer\n. Ok ;)\n. @mtrakal on which device did you test?\n. @mtrakal which android device? and which library version?\nWorking in Android N \n\n. Ok it is only on API17\n. @zeeshan4971 that is not related to the MaterialDrawer. Please search on google how to set menu items.\n(In your case you are lucky that I have another lib doing exactly this :D) \nFollow here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-ActionItemBadge\n(Android-Iconics (which is also a dependency of the ActionItemBadge) is already included in the MaterialDrawer so no need to add this dependency again) \nFor icons provided by Android-Iconics follow here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics\n. @zeeshan4971 is the item in the menu? or is it behind the overflow button?\n. @BartRongen you are right this behavior changed in the meantime. \nYou have 2 possibilities. \n1. you just set the text for the first and second line manually via the \n   https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L272\n   and \n   https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L284\n   So those two lines will have the defined text, and you can interact on the action when the user clicks (perhaps directly showing a dialog or whatever) \n2. you make the ProfileDrawerItem selectable (This is possible starting in v5.2.9 again) so it will be shown in the list. (Don't forget to set withSelectable(false) again as soon as there are profiles)\n. @leisim the shadows normally come from the fitsSystemWindows flag. Have you checked the FullscreenActivity of the sample app? \n. @leisim this partly solves your issue: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/3e04973b196f4a2ec2ab7b52c95220ae54ef352c\nbut I am not sure why I can't remove the shadow from the Slider somewhere there is still the fitsSystemWindows kicking in, in some layout... :/\n. yeah that's why it only solves it partially. I have no idea where the fitsSystemWindows comes in too. It is really hard. The problem which also occurs is that changing fitsSystemWindows programmatically results in different things than doing it via XML. \nIn my opinion the fitsSystemWindows flag is really hard to control. :/\nToday I might try it again to find a 100% working solution. \nthe MaterialDrawer itself does no longer set the shadows or margins or paddings which was done on versions prior 4.x.y. As it now depends 100% on the system built in functionality. \n. @homedevs I know that the StatusBar overlaps the Toolbar as the initial reporter stated he wants to have the drawer below the Toolbar in Fulllscreen mode (I didn't activate immersive mode in the test)\nIf you don't need fullscreen just check out the CustomContainerActivity of the sample. \n. @leisim oh ok great. ;) So it's fine for you now?\n. I think I can close this as this behavior only happens if you want to have the drawer below the Toolbar and in Fullscreen. And this is something I can't control in the drawer as the paddings / shadows are added by the fitsSystemWindows flag. \nIf I can help with something let me know?\n. @stultusstudio looks like you have some fitsSystemWindows flags to much or to less somewhere\n. @jahirfiquitiva I do not know the code of your CustomDrawerItem the default ones allow you to enable tinting. It depends if you kept this functionality?\nWhy do you need drawables? \n. by using the withIconTintingEnabled. I also use this in the AdvancedActivity\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/355f1dd99484192c7fbdb228ea94fb3cef585b1f/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java#L88\n. @riten7 how do you handle hamburger and arrow state of the ActionBarDrawerToggle? \n. Switching between arrow and hamburger can be done as shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/AdvancedActivity.java#L173\nAll the things the library does for you is it will link together an ActionBarDrawerToggle with the DrawerLayout so everything is as it would be done from you\n. Not really sure why this is in a merge conflict?\n. I merged it now (manually)\nSeems like your develp branch you used is very very very very old ;D\n. @harishvishwakarma you made any update? \n. @harishvishwakarma no no no. There should not be anything in an try catch. Can you debug? Does it happen in your debug application or in the live application in the store?\nYou used instant run? Perhaps a clean install helps?\n. @harishvishwakarma that'S weird. any line where that happens? or a full stacktrace?\n. Oh great ;). \n. @TheLoyalCruel \n.withTextColor should work. I just looked at the code and it is used correctly. You have to provide it as resolved color. \nfor the below issue. Must be somehow related to the support libraries, no ressource changes on my side.\n. @TheLoyalCruel I meant that you should have the latest support libraries with the latest version of the materialdrawer, also using the latest build tools etc. I have no problems with drawables or anything. \nyou can change profileItems and drawerItems at any time. you just need to notify the AccountHeader or Drawer about the udpated item\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer \nsimilar for the AccountHeader\nhmmm weird. I use the latest version on my own in some apps with many users and there are no issues. I also test the library itself on all the versions all the time and there are no issues. \nthere may be some issues with any other lib you use\n. @toastking42 if you have an OnAccountHeaderListener you can just return true to tell the AccountHeader that the event was consumed and no further action should be done. So also not switching the profile:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L385\n. @toastking42 oh sorry you are totally right. In the AccountHeader the profile is already switched when this event is fired. I totally missed this part. \nWith true you consume the event and prevent the drawer from being closed.\nso what else you could do is to disable the profiles from being selectable (withSelectable(false)) or you disable the possibility that the user opens the AccountSelection so he can't change the profile.\n. @toastking42 yeah in some rare cases a preChangeListener would be helpful here\n. @engi not automatically. You will have to call the collapse function if a sub item is selected. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1248#issuecomment-217662651\n. @engi not automatically.

So if you scroll it will reuse the view and use it for the next element in the list. So what will happen:\nOur list with some elements\nElemA_1 (view 1) (in your case this element a gets now view 1 set) \nElemA_2 (view 2) (in your case this element a gets now view 2 set) \nElemB_1 (view 3)\nElemC_1 (view 4)\nElemA_3 (view 5) (in your case this element a gets now view 5 set) \n----- outside the current window\nElemA_4 (no view applied at all at the moment)\nElemA_5 (no view applied at all at the moment)\nFine in the above scenario it will work, every element has it's own view applied, if you run your code above everything works as expected. But now the user scrolls down:\nElemA_1 (in your case this element has still view 1 set) \nElemA_2 (in your case this element has still view 2 set) \n----- outside the current window\nElemB_1 (view 3)\nElemC_1 (view 4)\nElemA_3 (view 5) (in your case this element a gets now view 5 set) \nElemA_4 (view 1) (in your case this element gets now also view 1 applied)\nElemA_5 (view 2) (in your case this element gets now also view 2 applied)\nSo when you run your code again. Suddenly ElemA_1 and ElemA_4 will share the same view, and the same for 2 and 5. \nSo as a result of this, you can not get the view from an item.

You will also notice that I do no longer allow this behavior in the library (and have disabled it in the themes) as it requires a lot of custom handling. This was possible prior to v5 which handled paddings etc manually. \n- You either can also remove the translucent statusbar for API 19, \n- keep the issue with API 19\n- or go back to a v4 drawer with no support and losing some functionality\n. @mockitoo I am sorry for this. I also had many troubles when doing the choice to go with fitsSystemWindows for v5 as I had to remove the translucentStatusbar feature for API 19. \nbut fitsSystemWindows is the way to go as we should try to use as much from the system as possible.\nthank you\n. @dieze seems like an issue from Robolectric to me as it does not correctly set up the android attributes. \nI could add a normal \"fallback\" into the getSelectableBackgroundRes to return a full color, but your proposed solution above is not possible as it will provide a completely different resource than the one provided by the system.\nfor the styles with ActionBar where you have no solution, shouldn't it be enough if you just remove the NoActionBar from the style?\n. @javalnanda which image loading library do you use?\n. @javalnanda the sample uses glide so you might want to try it with glide too. \nThe first time it's ok because it has to resize the icon, but afterwards there should be no \"loading\" visible anymore\n. @javalnanda seems like picasso does not really cache the image performant enough\n. @BenoitDuffez you are talking about the DrawerItem icon on Android N?

Which is not handled by the MaterialDrawer. \nIt's the ActionBarDrawerToggle directly from the appcompat libs. \nFor the items in the drawer itself, they have a normal OnClickListener set on the itemView nothing which can be changed there. So if the listener is not called, it's an OS issue. So maybe a issue from Samsung, or yeah. perhaps also the device screen or the touch is broken?\n. @codeAbode thank you for the comments you made, and for the effort you put into providing all the comments. \nBut I am afraid I have to give you an answer you do not really want to hear. \nI assume that your issue is a device (or OS (samsung)) related one, as you have the same issue for the drawer icon. Which is not handled by the MaterialDrawer. \nIt's the ActionBarDrawerToggle directly from the appcompat libs. \nFor the items in the drawer itself, they have a normal OnClickListener set on the itemView nothing which can be changed there. So if the listener is not called, it's an OS issue. So maybe a issue from Samsung, or yeah. perhaps also the device screen or the touch is broken?\n. @codeAbode seems like your assumption with the CrossfadeDrawerLayout is right. Weird enough is that I have not modified the original closeDrawers function and just call this one, after the item was clicked. Which should theoretically do the same as the drawer does internally. \nOne thing could be really true, that you may slide a bit so it is not detected as click. But it is really hard to reproduce this one. \nIts a lot easier to reproduce the ActionBarDrawerToggle not fireing issue, just select an item in the normal drawer, and it won't work. but it works if the mini drawer is clicked. \n. @codeAbode seems like your assumption with the CrossfadeDrawerLayout is right.

To be honest I have no idea why it reacts like this.

This issue was moved to mikepenz/CrossfadeDrawerLayout#15\n. @jahirfiquitiva I am not sure what this has to do with the MaterialDrawer. Where do you set the XML VectorDrawable? \n. @jahirfiquitiva I am not sure what this has to do with the MaterialDrawer. Where do you set the XML VectorDrawable? \n. @jahirfiquitiva yes the above makes sense, as I can't fine out if an icon is a normal drawable or a VectorDrawable\n. @jahirfiquitiva yes the above makes sense, as I can't fine out if an icon is a normal drawable or a VectorDrawable\n. @jahirfiquitiva you can just get the reference to the TextView and apply whatever you want. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L47\nThis will return the view. \nAnd here's the layout so you know the identifiers of the different views:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml\n. @jahirfiquitiva you can just get the reference to the TextView and apply whatever you want. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L47\nThis will return the view. \nAnd here's the layout so you know the identifiers of the different views:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml\n. @samruston could you please add the code how you have created the drawer?\n. @samruston could you please add the code how you have created the drawer?\n. @samruston please add more details so I can react to this issue. Will close until then.\n. @skmlcd I don't think this needs to be mentioned in the README as the whole project has javadoc, and the javadoc states that the updateBadge method asks for the identifier\nhttp://static.javadoc.io/com.mikepenz/materialdrawer/5.3.1/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.html#updateBadge-long-com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.holder.StringHolder-\n. @skmlcd I don't think this needs to be mentioned in the README as the whole project has javadoc, and the javadoc states that the updateBadge method asks for the identifier\nhttp://static.javadoc.io/com.mikepenz/materialdrawer/5.3.1/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.html#updateBadge-long-com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.holder.StringHolder-\n. @multivoltage can you please add some screenshot?\n. @multivoltage sounds like it may be an issue with the original system behavior. the drawer does not set any paddings or so, everything comes from the system via the fitsSystemWindows flags\nIt also does not happen in the sample application (the CollapsingToolbar sample)\n. @multivoltage oh that's the problem. you must not do UI manipulation on a non UI thread\n. If you have to do this in a thread you can move your code to a handler. \nYou can read some information about this here:\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/multiple-threads/communicate-ui.html\n. @multivoltage I also answered your issue here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/37931254/325479\nYou say it works if you create the Drawer in the onCreate so just create it there, and fill in the items after your countdown timer has finished\n. @SamSalman thank you. \nDo you just want the MiniDrawer and no normal full size drawer? \n. @SamSalman have you already tried the CrossfadeDrawerLayout if that's not a behavior you want, it will require a bit more work from your side to get the MiniDrawer as single behavior. \nYou will have to create the DrawerLayout on your own, handle it on your own, and then just add the MiniDrawer view into it after creation\n. @SamSalman It will get hard to get exactly the above view as you also have a StickyButton there. \nBut see this answer for CustomMiniDrawerItems;\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1258\nIn your case you might simply just use a normal DrawerLayout add it on your own and create your own layouts, don't think it is necessary to use the MaterialDrawer here\n. @SamSalman there is nothing like a Blur effect in the DrawerLayout you will have to implement something like this on your own. Not sure if there are already libraries which apply such a blur on a view. \nYou want to change the width of the MiniDrawer in general? \nSo you might want to provide a small sample app where I can try out this behavior you have at the moment\n. @SamSalman \nnot that I know. That comes from the original DrawerLayout \nyou might be able to just have a different view in the background somewhere which you use for this but that's not related to the MaterialDrawer\nOk I will have a look.\n. @SamSalman you also have to define the minWidth of the CrossfadeDrawerLayout like this:\njava\ncrossfadeDrawerLayout.setMinWidthPx((int) UIUtils.convertDpToPixel(100, this));\n. @SamSalman \njava\nminiResult.withOnMiniDrawerItemClickListener(new MiniDrawer.OnMiniDrawerItemClickListener() {\n     @Override\n     public boolean onItemClick(View view, int position, IDrawerItem drawerItem, int type) {\n         System.out.println(\"profile ++\"); => This one never fires\n         return false;\n     }\n });\nis correct. You just have to remove the previous listener:\nPlease see the Javadoc for the description why the first one does not fire when the second one is defined: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/7e069530ed7d3f62245b93e4b21d1d5edbdce6d2#diff-55bb5b525aaae9074580e302b40a9f07R177\n. what do you mean with nothing happens. you have to open the dialog or whatever you need there. You can even return true to prevent any default behavior\n. @mrz https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/615\nThis will hide the toggle arrow and disables the siwtcher\n. Use this method:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L101\n. @ParhamAhmadi which version of Android do you use? Which build tools? Which Android Studio? Which Java API level?\n. @ParhamAhmadi which libs do you have in your gradle? have you done a clean build? \n. @ParhamAhmadi It somehow must be related to your setup. You can download the repository open the sample app in Android Studio and it will run. \n. Can you please just create a small sample project showcasing this issue, I am sure this is not related and comes from some missconfiguration\n. Sorry without a sample application showcasing this issue I can not solve it. \nI am also pretty sure that it is not related to the library itself. As it works in the sample app\n. @zolbayars if you swipe from the left edge to right the empty drawer will open. You still have to fill it with items and you might want to pass the Toolbar but it will work already\n. @zolbayars that will show up as soon as you provide the Toolbar\n. @kkokate the MiniDrawer itself has no background color. It just uses the background of the DrawerLayout as the normal drawer does. \nHow do you set the color at the moment? and what do you mean it only works in expanded mode?\n. @kkokate to set the background when using the Crossfader I recommend to set it on the first and the second view separately:\njava\ncrossFader.getFirst().setBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE);\ncrossFader.getSecond().setBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE);\n. @HouLeiGD what do you mean?\n. you want to collapse the element again programmatically.\nYou get the Adapter from the Drawer and call collapse(int position) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L1167\nalso mentioned here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1248#issuecomment-217662651\n. @MhzDev that's the correct behavior as you catch the click event via the ClickListener on the View \nRemove the ClickListener on menu1.getView().setOnClickListener. Also make sure your item is clickable, and does not prevent clicks. Also check if it is enabled. \n. I would also need the view you provide to the ContainerDrawerItem as I think that this causes the problem. \nJust for curiosity, why do you use the ContainerDrawerItem, instead of implementing your own CustomDrawerItem\n. Also one more thing about your implementation. You can't just get the veiw and set the OnClickListener on it, as this will not work properly when you scroll and the view is recycled. \nPlease head over here on how to implement a proper CustomDrawerItem:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/32543209/325479\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/32542999/325479\nYou might also find some answers here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=CustomDrawerItem\nOr you check out custom drawer item implementations here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems\n. @gmikhail if you provide the Toolbar to the DrawerBuilder it will add an ActionbarDrawerToggle for you which will open / close the drawer. \nFor the ActionBarDrawerToggle you might can check this:\nhttp://iamtechnologist.blogspot.co.at/2015/03/how-to-completely-disable-android.html\n. @iHandy the sample app was not intended to do this, but yeah nice idea. Changed it to work properly\n. @shimika the animation is automatically played by the DrawerLayout when it is closed. \nGetting rid of the animation is not easy: http://levibostian.com/android-navigation-drawer-animation-duration/\nWhat you can do is that you modify the behavior when the drawer closes. You have 2 options. You can delay the click event of the listener. or you can delay the close of the drawer:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1118\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1101\nsetting one of both to about 150ms should make the animations good\n. @frmz no issue with this approach as I go the same approach with wallsplash (a wallpaper app I have created) There I have created a settings activity based on the MaterialDrawer for muzei. \n. @frmz if it is just about filling a list with items you may also look at the underlaying FastAdapter which is the base for the MaterialDrawer (https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter)\nHaving the MaterialDrawer fullscreen is in the sample application. Creating CustomDrawerItems can also be easily done and is also showcased in the sample\n. @frmz yes. makes sense\n. @frmz yes. makes sense\n. @acosti if you can not use one activity with fragments (which is definitely the correct implementation) you will have to go a different approach. \nThere is definitely NO chance to have the drawer static. \nWhat you can do is to have a helper class which creates the drawer for you (with the same logic) and you just call this helper in all your activities. But the drawer .build() has to be called in each of those activities otherwise the drawer is not added. \n. @acosti yes that's possible. You can keep the DrawerBuilder global once. And call the build() per activity then, as this will initiate the inflating of the layouts into your app in the end. \n. @acosti oh I forgot about this behavior as I had to prevent people calling .build() multiple times (which would result in them having multiple drawers in the same activity) \nThe easiest solution would be that you just keep the \"expensive\" information global and just rebuild the drawer as normal. I assume getting the items is expensive for you so just keep those items globally or so?\n. @acosti oh I forgot about this behavior as I had to prevent people calling .build() multiple times (which would result in them having multiple drawers in the same activity) \nThe easiest solution would be that you just keep the \"expensive\" information global and just rebuild the drawer as normal. I assume getting the items is expensive for you so just keep those items globally or so?\n. @acosti you could do a pull request and add a method reset to the DrawerBuilder which sets the mUsed field back to false. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L71\nthis would then allow you to do this.

It's quite complex the above. Perhaps posting a \"zip\" containing the simple sample code would be easier\n. @caralin3 if you have one activity with fragments. Just use the listener and change out the fragments if the user selects a new one\n. @caralin3 the official android documentation shows how to comit fragments to a container view\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html\njust use the listener to detect selections of the user, and switch out the fragment\n. @acosti I remember there was a library which did exactly this. Keeping one activity but filling it up with different views depending on the context. \nI am not quite sure if this is a good or the best approach. Android comes with a pretty good and feature rich concept of Fragments which will exactly do what you need. \nIt is also rather simple to split things up into fragments, and to handle fragments and doing the switching with the Drawer as you just need to commit the correct fragment when an item is selected. You can even move the whole fragment commiting logic into the Listener of the drawer, as you can trigger it after start, and also when the onCreate is called with onSavedInstanceState setting the correct fragment again. \n. Ok to finally close this issue. After some more digging and debugging and trying. It is not really possible to reuse the same DrawerBuilder, as it turns out that the RecyclerView is not happy if the Adapter is reused. \nThe optimal solution for this usecase is to remember the complex data you have to fetch, and then just build the drawer with the items, based on the already loaded data.\n. @murassq where did you get the reference to this method?\nIt is deleted as of last year:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/592#issuecomment-134931310\n. @harso121 oh cool :D but I generally keep conversations in english so other people can also use the answers :D\nRegarding your issue. I really recommend that you don't handle those things in your theme\nxml\n <item name=\"android:windowActionBar\">false</item>\n<item name=\"android:windowNoTitle\">true</item>\n<item name=\"windowActionBar\">false</item>\n<item name=\"windowNoTitle\">true</item>\nAnd that you follow the instructions noted here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#androidmanifestxml to use one of the MaterialDrawer themes as base (those already set the above params correctly for all android versions and also depend on the appcompat theme)\n. @harso121 because you set your windowBackground to white \nxml\n<item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@color/white</item>\nIf you have \"darkToolbar\" the proper way is to set the theme as shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_dark_toolbar.xml#L13\nI assume that you still have your own theme so you should follow this here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#custom-style---stylesxml especially the first three lines are important for apps\n. @harso121 I sent you the exact line what you need to add:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_dark_toolbar.xml#L13\n. also if you define the colors for primary etc in your theme? as linked above? So that at least the statusbar color is right?\nYou always have to differ which themes to use. You can check in the sample app which theme fits yours. \nYou can also check out the different things I have done in the sample apps of my libs. Android-Iconics has white text as you want it to be.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L10\nand define this to get the white hamburger icon:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml#L7\nand set the colors to get the correct styling:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml#L5\nand as already mentioned for the text.

Great that you solved it :) \n. @kamilj I don't see the point why this needs an example. There are the details about the listener, which is called when you click an item.

The BasePrimaryDrawerItem sets the ripple backgroudn here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L81\nIf you extend from the BasePrimaryDrawerItem like the PrimaryDrawerItem (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/PrimaryDrawerItem.java) just set your own background after the bindViewHelper\n. @AccessTlt you can look at the implementatoin of the PrimaryDrawerItem You just have to provide a line like the following as addition: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L81 and set your own background which has no touch effect. Might just a drawable with a selected state and a non selecteds tate\n. @AccessTlt in your code. you do not have to use the UIUtils to set your drawable then. \nI would recommend that you create a drawable with all states, including enabled, pressed, disabled, selected etc. then it should work. \nthis should also directly work without notifying the adapter about an item update. all other solutions via code will require the item to be updated via the notify method which would trigger the animation (also flashing) to be done via the itemanimator. \nso there are multiple solutions. In general these things work like they do in a normal adapter / recyclerView setup and are not really specific to the FastAdapter\n. @mwshubham which version of the drawer are you using. This can't really happen with the compactHeader as it uses a LinearLayout and the arrow is to the right of the lines for the text?\nYou might add a sample project showcasing these issues, as I can't really test with normal german texts and phones \n. @mwshubham I may have identified a problem with the normal AccountHeader but none for the compact header\n. oh ok great :) \n. Both items have the same fontFamily set (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml#L35) \nand also get the typeface applied:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BasePrimaryDrawerItem.java#L93\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/SectionDrawerItem.java#L123\nIt might be related to the different font size?\n. @shaikansaar sorry no support for older versions than the latest.\nYou might can create a CustomDrawerItem which fixes it for you.\n. @marbat87 there is a different \"behavior\" available for the MiniDrawer which might does the job for you: https://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/crossfader/Crossfader.java#L52 \njust add withGmailStyleSwiping to your Crossfader\n. @AngleV nothing for the default behavior, but you can do this easily be extending the PrimaryDrawerItem and create your custom DrawerItem which also changes text when disabled. But in general the easiest would already be that you just set the text when you disable the item, as you have to do this anyway\n. Haha. Nice try :D But I can't add everything :P\n. @AngleV might wanna add an FAQ entry? https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ.md\nA new section \"CustomDrawerItem's\" and adding a yours as first item?\n. thank you :) \n. Thanks :) awesome. \nWe might also should create a separate instruction file in the FAQ folder and link this one, because if you delete your gist the item is lost :D \n. @acosti I can't really give support for general android layouts, or for such a custom behavior. \nThe drawer allows you to do so, but it's still custom behavior. \nYou have to remember that you can't positioning the LinearLayout itself as its inside a RelativeLayout which already defines its position. I think it's much easier if you directly change the TextViews or might add an additional layout inbetwean\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/38450730/325479\n. @aprzybylo that's a very custom behavior. I think adding this to the MiniDrawer will require some work, as it is not built to include custom views on top. You might be able to add it as first element inside the MiniDrawer above the header. \nYou can obtain the root container view of the MiniDrawer by doing the following:\n((LinearLayout)miniDrawer.getRecyclerView().getParent())\nyou can add there a new view at the position, which will be your hamburger. \nFor the normal  MaterialDrawer I suggest that you overwrite the layout of the header, add the hamburger button, and add a listener to it after the drawer was built by getting the header from the Drawer object and searching for the view which is your button.\nThe normal header layout for the AccountHeader is the following:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml\n(copy paste this to your project and modify it (don't remove any views or it will crash), it will automatically overwrite the layout from the lib)\n. @sashatinkoff because you return true in the listener which means you consume the event\n. @marbat87 you can change the StatusBar color programmatically via the DrawerLayout as this one controlls the insets.\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1247#issuecomment-217641415\n. @caralin3 not possible above an ActionBar. That's just possible with a Toolbar.\n. @caralin3 please rever to one of the samples using a Toolbar it's really simple and the change can be done within a few minutes\n. @socialvanana LockMode comes from DrawerLayout and is not implemented nor modified by the MaterialDrawer please search on Google / StackOverFlow for answers. \n. @ashwinbhaskar you have to take a closer look on how a DrawerLayout works. It contains 2 basic views (or more) first the slider and second the content area. \nIn the above case you have just defined the content which is the center. as it seems you want to define a overlay for the slider. \nYou can get a reference to the Slider via the Drawer object. Which is a ScrimInsetsRelativeLayout and you can just add a childview programatically in there.\n. @jidesoft there is no real listener for this. You may can use one of the  DrawerListeners which gives you the callback when the drawer is moving (opening / closing) \n--> https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L1071\nin general the best way is to update the item when the value changes. as it will trigger the notify of the item, which shouldn'T yet cause a drawing as the drawer is not visible.\n. @gauravzuse sorry I can't give general android support. \nHere you can find the required steps to add the library to your project:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#1-provide-the-gradle-dependency\nAnd then you can use the later parts of the readme to find out what you can do, or you head over to the sample project and check out it's source\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java\n. @mackagy1 which theme are you using? can you also please add a screenshot how it looks right now and what you want to achieve?\n. You can also check out the sample app on how it's done there. It is also always important to use the correct theme\n. @sebastianmacarescu yes. Just get the View from the AccountHeader after the Drawer was built.\njava\nAccountHeader.getHeaderBackgroundView()\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L65\n. @Polyterative I am quite sure that comes by Android getting confused of animating and drawing 2 different things. First the item, with the changed badge, and second the closing animation. \nNothing I can do about those. Animation from the closing is done by the  DrawerLayout and redrawing the item by the RecyclerView.\nThank you .\n. @bbetter not over the ActionbarDrawerToggle. There may be other projects or possibilities to achieve this, but it's not related to the MaterialDrawer, and will require custom handling of the open / closing etc. \n. @JJSarrasin if you update items you have to notify the drawer about the changes. Normally you do this via:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L594\nor\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L652\n. @olmur how do you set the icons?\n. @olmur I used your code, and modified the sample to use it, and was not able to repoduce this issue, neither with a phone or an emulator. could you please provide a sample app to showcase the issue, so I might be able to reproduce it=\n. Great ;). \n. @oleynikd you can change it by defining a different placeholder inside the DrawerImageLoader\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/util/DrawerImageLoader.java#L82\nThis is how you define the ImageLoader\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\nAnd that's where the placeholder icon is coming from by default:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/769cbfdc233c4835f8403a4c94002166d4e7f8c0/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/util/DrawerUIUtils.java#L93\n. @506605454 no it can't. You still can add items to the Drawer via the provided methods. \nYou can even provide your own items if you need some custom items.\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. Oh sorry misunderstood it. For the profiles it's exactly the same but with the AccountHeader object.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L244\n. @oleynikd you can also find this in the sample app ;)\n. Close until further details are provided. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\n. @roher-roher ok thanks. please report back afterwards. (if it only occurs with the MaterialDrawer please provide a small sample app so I can debug this issue)\nI close this for the time being and wait for further feedback.\n. @roher-roher interesting enough it is related to the:\njava\n        if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {\n            drawer.getDrawerLayout().setFitsSystemWindows(false);\n        }\nIf you remove it it works properly, but you get the blue bar on top. \nI also tested the normal DrawerLayout but it has some worse behavior than the MaterialDrawer with crosswalk. It shows up, but it also does not take up the whole screen, and it has some terrible lag.\nI am sure it is a general DrawerLayout + fitsSystemWindows + WebView problem, which I can't solve :/ \n. @roher-roher it seems so. There might be other possibilities to achieve this. Probably wrapping everything into a ScrimInsetsFrameLayout and preventing the default fitsSystemWindows behavior.\n. @roher-roher I had quite a lot of lag, and ui issues with the DrawerLayout variant. \n. Hmm it's weird, as it will work for me with the MaterialDrawer and I can't reproduce the behavior of it being behind the WebView \nwhich android version are you on?\ndrawer.zip\n. have you tried the projects I sent to you? I can't reproduce it with them. \n. @roher-roher me neither. Hmmm so it is a combination of the fitsSystemWindows flag, und the Android version in addition... :/ \nPerhaps the latest support libs version changes something? \n. @roher-roher I have another idea which might work, and may end your troubles. \nCreating the DrawerLayout as you do in the normal sample. And just using the view of the MaterialDrawer. Maybe the inflating is causing troubles in combination with the WebView (in comparison to the default which already has the DrawerLayout in the xml)\nSo you will have something like this (to simplify I just removed everything which is not really necessary to share the code :D):\n``` java\npublic class MainActivity extends XWalkActivity {\nprivate LinearLayout lvDrawer;\nprivate XWalkView webView;\nprivate Drawer drawer;\n\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    lvDrawer = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.lvDrawer);\n    webView = (XWalkView) findViewById(R.id.xwvMain);\n\n    setupDrawer();\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void onXWalkReady() {\n    webView.load(\"file:///android_asset/index.html\", null);\n}\n\nprivate void setupDrawer() {\n    drawer = new DrawerBuilder()\n            .withActivity(this)\n            //remove this if it should go velow the statusBar\n            .withDisplayBelowStatusBar(false)\n            .withSelectedItem(0)\n            .addDrawerItems(/*your items*/)\n            .buildView();\n\n    lvDrawer.addView(drawer.getSlider());\n}\n\n}\n```\nand change the ListView in the layout to:\nxml\n<LinearLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/lvDrawer\"\n        android:layout_width=\"240dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_gravity=\"start\"\n        android:background=\"#aaa\"/>\n. then I am really out of ideas. Because with the above it uses a normal DrawerLayout coming from the xml and just the content is filled with a RecyclerView containing the Items\n. @roher-roher seems like the setAdapter somehow causes a redraw of the slider which brings it to the frong. \nPerhaps the difference from ListView and RecyclerView make some additional differen :/\nI am really out of ideas. As the whole slider is still managed by the DrawerLayout which is from Google\n. @homer-jay thank you for the info. Then there's nothing this library will change about it :(. @farhadsaberi this is the correct space as of the Material Design Guidelines you are be able to change this space by overwriting the layout for the items (or overwriting the dimens values)\nHere's the layout which you have to overwrite for the PrimaryDrawerItem\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml\n. @Jspascal there is the OnDrawerItemClickListener\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L148\n. @mahdimortazavi  seems as it does not load the sub dependencies.\nCould it be that you have the jcenter repository before the mavenCentral one?\nAnyway, it will work when you provide the sup dependencies too:\n``` java\n // used to base on some backwards compatible themes\n    // contains util classes to support various android versions, and clean up code\n    // comes with the awesome \"Holder\"-Pattern\n    // https://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize\n    compile 'com.mikepenz:materialize:0.9.0@aar'\n// used to provide out of the box icon font support. simplifies development,\n// and provides scalable icons. the core is very very light\n// https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:iconics-core:2.7.2@aar'\n\n// used to fill the RecyclerView with the DrawerItems\n// and provides single and multi selection, expandable items\n// https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:fastadapter:1.6.1@aar'\n\n```\n. Should work already. mavenCentral will serve it correctly\n. @Mygod the dependencies are just the minimum. just follow the instructions in the readme. @Mygod the dependencies are just the minimum. just follow the instructions in the readme. @mahdimortazavi as @amorenew already correctly mentioned. RTL support is included but as Android only supports it starting with API 17 I can't do anything to bring it prior to API 17.\nYou still have the option to overwrite all layouts and alter them to look RTL, and to put the drawer on the right side, but this won't change the Hamburger icon to the right side, and it's rather hacky. \n. @mahdimortazavi as @amorenew already correctly mentioned.

Either look on mavenCentral which verison is currently the newest, or you head over here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics\n. @ProfPh no it's not because the onBackPressed event is not forwarded to the drawer. In general you need those lines just once per app :D \n. @iqbalprabu14 you have to use the latest appcompat version when using the latest version of the MaterialDrawer you should also compile with the latest sdk version. \nWhich versions do you use?\n. @marcodebarbosa does your item have an identifier? Do you call the above code on the main thread? \n. Please provide additional details\n. @n1schal the default items do not allow you to set a drawable as background. \nYou will have to implement a CustomDrawerItem which allows you to do this. \nIn the sample app I have already implemented an item which does quite a similar thing. \nCheck it out here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems/CustomPrimaryDrawerItem.java \n. @Shruti6293 I remember there was an issue about having some custom MiniDrawerItems it is possible yes. But will require some custom handling, if you do not want to go with the default selected background\n. @kadhim-alawi you can't remove an item from the list using the identifier as it does only exist in the sub hirachy, which is linked to the specific item. You will have to know the sub items list of this item, and remove it there (maybe via position?)\n. Please read this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1260#issuecomment-218735178\n. The latest version of my libs always come with the latest support libraries. In this case 24.1.1\n(https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/build.gradle#L8) \nIssues or changes required due to updates should always be looked up in the official changelog for those. \nStill thank you for adding the info here, so if someone comes across it, he finds it using the search function\n. @gtgray no this is not possible. You can only have flexible items there. With some custom handling it might be possible but not out of the box.\n. So you can get the RecyclerView of the MiniDrawer and from that you can get it's parent. Which is a LinearLayout into which you can add the \"sticky\" view as first child. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L207\n. @hharddy the icons are defined in the size as defined in the Material Design Guidelines there are smaller ones possible via the SecondaryDrawerItem. \nIf those does not fit your needs, you may also be able to change the size (when using the IconicsDrawable) by just setting more padding to those. \nOtherwise this will require you to overwrite the default layouts (and dimens.xml) for those items. (or you create a CustomDrawerItem)\n. Regarding CustomDrawerItem \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md\n. @MustafaTaj nothing related to the library.\nI just took a second look. Why do you add the library as defined here:\ncompile project(\":libs:MikepenzMaterialDrawer\")\nplease follow the instructions in the readme.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#1-provide-the-gradle-dependency\n. @azizarc88 you can create any items you want, and add them the the MaterialDrawer . \nRead more here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md\n. You create a CustomDrawerItem which has an EditText. \nYou will create the items layout,\nYou create the CustomDrawerItem as shown above\nYou provide it to the drawer. \n. Sorry I can't help with this. Please refer to normal sites like StackOverflow etc. to get more knowhow in android, or programming. \n. @bapisth just define the text as normal. And if it changes, update the text in the ProfileDrawerItem and notify the AccountHeader about the update. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L244\n. @bamdad01 this is not necessary, as the badge will only be displyed when you set a text. And you can always remove it again by updating this item and setting a null text. (don't forget to notify the Drawer about the changed item\n. @MustafaTaj remove the .withFullscreen(true) it is not needed for your case. \n. @acosti do you also save the InstanceState:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L234 ?\n. @acosti your menuItems have an identifier set? \nIn general it should be fine. You can try it in the sample app, which does not have this problem. \n. As shown in the readme:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#add-items-and-adding-some-functionality\njava\n.withIdentifier(1)\n(has to be unique per item)\n. @acosti your header also gets the instanceState? Just to be sure. You use the latest version too right?\nMaybe you can provide a small sample project to showcase your issue, and I can debug it.\n. @acosti thank you\n. @acosti ah ok :D great that you found the issue. \n. @abumoallim you can set the Gravity for the drawer. As you can do with a normal DrawerLayout too. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L445\n. @postacik if you want to add more subitems. the best is that you retrive the parent item. And then just add the new subItem to the list of subItems. \nDon't forget that you have to notify the Adapter about the additional subitem:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1260#issuecomment-218735178\n. @postacik so it is important that your mAyraclarGroup has an identifier defined. \nThen when you wan to add a new subItem just get the previous list and add the new one:\nmAyraclarGroup.getSubItems().add(newItem)\nAfter this call the method as describe din my first answer https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1260#issuecomment-218735178:\nDrawer.getAdapter().notifyAdapterSubItemsChanged(int globalPosition)\nyou can't use the udateItem function here, as subitems work a bit different\n. @postacik do you have a header? if yes the notify method has to be called on index (1) (global index is needed -> header is counted as 1 )\n. Sorry for the late answer. Overlooked the question. \nGreat that it works now :)\n. @Onwa1kenobi just follow the sample app's implementation. \nFor the CrossfadeDrawer you need the additional libarary:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/CrossfadeDrawerLayout\n. Do you have expandable ProfileDrawerItem?\n. @alorma please check out the following. Should solve your problem. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/feature/%231488/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java\nWhat I do. I change the main items list when a profile is selected. You can see this by the added / updated test items \n. @alorma this is a good idea. I will have a look into it. Even if it may be a breaking change. \n. @alorma I just checked the code. It would be a huge change to bring in this change, as currently all apply calls are done via the ImageHolder from the Materialize library which does not allow this. And then all the current usages have to be touched. \nWould it be already enough if I provide the tag in the set method too. (Similar as in the placeholder method)?\n. the tag will be one of those:  \"profile\", \"profileDrawerItem\", \"accountHeader\"\n. You generate a drawable? Why do you do that at loading time?\n. Sorry closed by commit. \n. I think can be closed as discussed on telegram\n. @abumoallim can you please add some more details. How to you create the DrawerItem any other code which may could prevent this? Do you have tinting enabled. Or anything else?\n. Just tried this another time in the sample app this works\n. @abumoallim but I see that the icon is correclty changed in your screenshot. The color is not changing. This is because you don't have iconTinting enabled. Nor do you define the withSelectedIconColor or the withIconColor. \nSo you should enable\n.withIconTintingEnabled(true)\nand also define the colors you want to have by default or selected\n. @SarkenJ the problem is when you create a new Drawer you will just end up with having 2 DrawerLayouts in your activity. \nYou have to keep in mind that the MaterialDrawer is \"just\" a wrapper around the DrawerLayout and provides you some easy to use APIs which allow you to achieve a Drawer following the material design guidelines. \nSo for your requirement. You just need to keep in mind that everything is a DrawerLayout with all the default behaviors behind. So you only have to get the reference to the Slider view which holds the drawer which you can slide out. \nYou can easily to this by calling Drawer.getSlider() as the DrawerLayout manages the gravity just by this (the sliders) gravity. Just update the gravity for the Slider view and you should be good to go. \n. Drawer.getSlider().setGravity()\n. Oh sorry. Mixed up normal gravity with LayoutGravity please see the following:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/8049860/325479\nThe layoutparams. Note that the Slider has the DrawerLayout.LayoutParams\n. @SarkenJ yeah that makes sense as the internal methods from the Drawer would still use the gravity which was defined during the beginning. \nAs a quick fix you can directly call the methods from the DrawerLayout to open and to close. I will add a method to set the gravity on the Drawer object, so you can also update the gravity in there, which should fix your issue.\n. @Pareshoct7 perhaps today or tomorrow evening (CET)\n. @SarkenJ I was not yet able to publish the new release as I first want to update the FastAdapter.\n. @marbat87 as mentioned in the changelog. You can stay with the previous version. I will no longer support API 10. \nIf updates are really necessary for you, you can always just download the source and add the libraries as modules and modify them to work. \nIt is 2016 it is time for API 14. API 10 is really no longer necessary. \n. @marbat87 the current versions are really stable. and there shouldn't be the need of any changes on my side. you can even go with support lib updates by just excluding those of my libs. So you are still fine for the upcoming months. And by the time you will also end supporting API 10. \nI know a lot of huge apps which go to API 16 already. In most cases you can ignore users for API < 14. (Just some apps may require to support those)\nAs mentioned already before. You can still use the libs. You can also bring back support for API 10 easily if required. I just can't support those anymore. The last phones which are on those API levels broke. And I can't support something which I can't test. And I clearly want to spend time to improve and extend the libraries instead of spending time to test on android versions which are really old and which I can't test anymore on real devices. \nJust as an addition. API 10 - 14 was there in 2010 - 2011. That was support for 5 year old Android versions from my side. \nNot even apple supports devices from 2010 with their latest software updates. And they just got a handful...\n. @marbat87 you can do this similar to this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/app/build.gradle#L71\nJust use the module name of the support libs. And then define the dependency in your build.gradle with the version you want to use it with. \nAs of the stability. If you look at the releases from the past weeks there were no huge changes or no big issues anymore. Just some special cases which you may will never run into. \n. @siavashabdoli https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/releases/tag/v5.5.0\n. du you have any fullscreen flags or so set?\n. @RuiHelderOliveira please also add some code so I can have a closer look\n. @RuiHelderOliveira could you please add some more info, also some code would help. Best would be if you provide a small demo application with to showcase the issue. \n. @RuiHelderOliveira if you remove the following?\njava\n.withFullscreen(true)\n. @RuiHelderOliveira hmmm ok. Which theme do you set on that activity?\n. Sounds also fine. Hmmm I somehow have the bad feeling that it may could be related to the fitsSystemWindows flag somewhere, or it's an Android bug\n.

You want an arrow on the left. instead the small arrow on the right which is already there. \nYou can alter the layout of the header, by overwriting it's layout.

Great. Thank you ;)\n. @adriamt please post what you did already to get a CustomDrawerItem? Theoretically you can just clone the process which was done for the Switch / Toggle draweritems and replace it with a CheckBox\n. @adriamt you use this class:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/AbstractSwitchableDrawerItem.java\nchange the switch with a checkbox. (also the methods which handle the switch)\nYou adjust the layout: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_switch.xml\nyou define a different identifier\nand you change the class to be not abstract but a real class (as you wouln't need an alternative implementation)\n. You can still ask questions here. Closed as it is no real issue ;)\n. @adriamt let me know ;)\n. @adriamt I think you missunderstood me. I meant you should have aclass similar to the AbstractSwitchableDrawerItem but not extending it. So you will copy and paste it. Keep the extending from BaseDescribeableDrawerItem and just implement the things as you need thim. \nThis will also fix the problems that you now have the wrong ViewHolder type, and ViewHolderFactory type. \n. @adriamt wrong improt somewhere?\nWhat do you have here:\njava\npublic void bindView(final AbstractSwitchableDrawerItem.ViewHolder viewHolder, List payloads) {\nWhat does your ViewHolderFactory generate?\n.

I was just to lazy to create an id definition for the quick sample. It will compile and run. (the above is just an annotation) \njust replace it with a real identifier for this item.

There is no custom behavior in. \nI think the only solution to \"prevent\" the longclick is to either have an empty lonclicklistener or to set the listener to null during the event. \n. @SandKierkegaard thanks :)\n. @postacik please open a PR and add it at the end of the list ;)\n. @Thore1954 no this is not really possible. Can you work with views which you set GONE and / or VISIBLE?\n. It is also important to note that a drawer can't be built twice for one activity as it will do some stuff for you. \n. @Thore1954 if you also just want to modify everything around the RecyclerView which hosts the DrawerItems you could also do this like shown in the EmbeddedDrawer sample.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/EmbeddedDrawerActivity.java\nThis will require you to handle all the DrawerLayout stuff on your own though. \n. Great. \nThanks\n. @OneManStudioDotSe  so basically the MaterialDrawer does not do anything with the toolbar. It does not add one, it would just set the ActionBarDrawerToggle if the Toolbar was provided.\nCould it be that there is no Toolbar on top but the legacy ActionBar because of a wrong theme?\n. @OneManStudioDotSe if you have different fragments. You will either always have to provide the Toolbar from the commited fragment to the Activity and then to the MaterialDrawer  or you have to handle it on your own and just forward open / close ot the Drawer \n(The drawer is not searching for an ActionBarDrawerToggle is just creates a new one and sets it to the provided Toolbar)\n. @OneManStudioDotSe as mentioned this is clearly no MaterialDrawer issue \nIf you send a sample application to showcase this issue I may can have a look?\n. @OneManStudioDotSe as mentioned this is clearly no MaterialDrawer issue \nIf you send a sample application to showcase this issue I may can have a look?\n. Please read the Readme. It is like updating a normal item. Just notify the AccountHeader about the changed profile. I'm on my phone. It should be called updateProfile\n. @MostafaEbrahimi the Drawer object can't be reused. But the code can. So you will have a static util class which will host the code which is required to build the drawer, and takes the activity, the toolbar, the current selected item as argument. And you just call this method everywhere, where you need the drawer..\n. @ishaan-khan the MaterialDrawer does not interact with the Toolbar the only thing it does is to set the ActionbarDrawerToggle on the Toolbar (if supplied). \nPerhaps you have to set the title on your own or so?\nDo you have the toolbar within the fragment?\nThis issue is not library related\n. Please check out the FAQ\n. Please check out the FAQ\n. @rubengees yes that could be the cause. Never saw this problem on a real device or on anything else.

You can simply use the method addDrawerItems of the DrawerBuilder https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L980\nSo you will have something like\njava\nDrawerBuilder drawerBuilder = new DrawerBuilder(this);\ndrawerBuilder.with*();\nfor(...) {\n    drawerBuilder.addDrawerItems();\n}\nDrawer drawer = drawerBuilder.build();\n. You can simply use the method addDrawerItems of the DrawerBuilder https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L980\nSo you will have something like\njava\nDrawerBuilder drawerBuilder = new DrawerBuilder(this);\ndrawerBuilder.with*();\nfor(...) {\n    drawerBuilder.addDrawerItems();\n}\nDrawer drawer = drawerBuilder.build();\n. @srpanchal please make sure you use the fitsSystemWindows flag correctly on your views \nPlease also have a look at this sample: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java\nand it's layout:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_collapsing_toolbar.xml\n. @srpanchal please make sure you use the fitsSystemWindows flag correctly on your views \nPlease also have a look at this sample: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java\nand it's layout:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_collapsing_toolbar.xml\n. @srpanchal could you please provide a demo application so I can try this?\n. @srpanchal after some tries. It seems the used library does not correclty handle the insets when using the fitsSystemWindows attribute. \nWrapping the whole MaterialViewPager inside a ScrimInsetsFrameLayout will move it below the StatusBar but ignoring the 24dp. (25dp as of Android 6.x). \n(Also one additional issue. You have 2 Drawers in your activity, causing additional issues, please remove the empty one)\n. Ok after checking their official sample. They definitely handle the fitsSystemWindows flag wrong. They require you to not use it at all. \nSo to fix your sample. Remove the empty drawer (you have it before defining the items) and add .withDrawerLayout(R.layout.material_drawer_fits_not) to your DrawerBuilder. Please also remove the unused unnecessary layout around the MaterialViewPager in the activity_main\n. add \njava\n.withTranslucentStatusBar(false)\n. Thank you :)\nIs it ok if I would use your sample as base for a new sample activity of the drawer? \n. thanks\n. @cpboyd currently there are no plans to adjust this, as you can set a drawable on your own via the APIs. \nTo simplify this you can also just move this code into a helper function for you. \nThanks for the suggestion. \n(I have added the \"good to know\" label so it is easier to be found)\n. @rambod17 you can by either creating CustomDrawerItems (please read the FAQ), or by overwriting the default layouts of the default items. \nI do not recommend changing those as it will be against the material design guidelines\n. @herau as the DrawerLayout's content is just a RecyclerView I would say you can test it the same way as you would test a RecyclerView in common. \nSelections are done via the Drawer object. the DrawerBuilder also allows you to define a listener which is called when the drawer is opened / closed\n. @engi can't be a bug of the MaterialDrawer as it works fine in general. Has to be related to your implementation, or to the implementation of that library. \nYou can add the stacktrace of the crash though, perhaps it is easy to describe / fix\n. @ajithkpistar what do you mean?\nYou can set a BitMap to a ProfileDrawerItem at any time. Just notify the AccountHeader about the updated profile afterwards and you are fine.\n. @Tzontonel sorry closing aAlertDialog is not related to this library\n. @geolyth which divider are you talking about? \n. @geolyth there is no separator between two rows, just if you have a SectionDrawerItem or a DividerDrawerItem and those colors are controlled by the above color. If you want a divider between all items you have to set it via an Decorator\nsee more here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/27037230/325479\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L215\n. @jondallen  so you do not want the default profile icon?\nIn general the best would be to just check for the image you want to change, and all other stuff is handled via the super.placeholder method. so nothing changes. \nused in the header:\nPROFILE\nused in the list for the accounts:\nPROFILE_DRAWER_ITEM,\n. you can define the font size if you overwrite the dimensions set in the dimens.xml just add the entry to your dimens.xml and change the value\n. What exactly does \"didn't work mean\"? which texts to you want to modify?\nhow does it look like?. Cool. Thanks\n. @Shruti6293 just use the CustomContainerActivity of the sample activity it's very imilar\n. @Shruti6293 just use the CustomContainerActivity of the sample activity it's very imilar\n. @Shruti6293 if you just want the MiniDrawer you just have to remove the code for the CrossFadeLayout and add the MiniDrawer-View which you create via miniResult.build(this) to your layout. \n. the headerResult is null in your code\n. @FasdAR I do not understand why removing would fix this. the log shows that headerResult is null. So you might never set it or so. This is clearly not related to the library itself\n. @EduardoHenriquue you might have some wrong proguard rules in your application. Please make sure you include proguard rules. Also perhaps you should post the exception you get?\n. Hi @kiotoze sorry this is not possible, as this would result in many additional troubles, like the problem of showing the items for the header. It would be a big problem for it to implement that it should just remove all items but the account header, and then add the profile items around it. \nIn your case I recommend you to implement a CustomDrawerItem which looks like the AccountHeader or like the things you need from the AccountHeader \nAlso I don't think that this should be in the library as it wouldn't be used in general, and ist just required by your specific case. \n. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md\n. Hi @Kara52deniz \nThe MaterialDrawer provides the listeners and callbacks which will allow you to implement any navigation logic you need. As for fragments. Just look up in the internet how to handle fragments in Android. \nAs the MaterialDrawer uses the latest v25 of the support libraries, which in general should be used with compileSdk 25 and targetSdk 25 it is not recommend to use it with sdk 23. What prevents you from using the latest version?\n. https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html\n. @tajchert the MaterialDrawer does exactly use the same DrawerLayout provided by the support library. there were no modifications made nor was there anything changed regarding this behavior. \nCould it be just a feeling?\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/20016088/325479\nThis should do the trick :D\n. thank you for doing the PR ;)\n. Thank you very much\n. Please see the sample application. There it works without problems:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/header.xml\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/fed00a199196efbc63296a081723e603647b5bc4/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java#L43\n. @vanillazz the custom header allows you to pass any view in which you want. So this is completely independent of the MaterialDrawer itself. \nI assume that the height will change and as the containing RecyclerView item already was calculated the new height would not be respected. So you perhaps have to invalidate the RV or something like this. \nIn general this is the same as if you would do the same in a normal RecyclerView. So please have a look how to nest your Expandable ListView inside a RecyclerView \n. @vit1-irk that's nothing related to the MaterialDrawer as I use a normal DrawerLayout and alos it'S features. \nI assume you can somehow have a TouchListener over your whole view and just check if the user swipes left to then open the drawer. You may also achieve this with a custom implementation of the DrawerLayout (which you can then pass to the MaterialDrawer) \n. @tajchert do you have a screenshot of it? I can't compile it at the moment, as I am limited on time.\n. @Xellsky please make sure you use appcompat and recyclerview 25 when using the latest version of the materialdrawer.\nMaybe there is an appcompat conflict. \nFor the UltimateRecyclerView I cannot give support\n. @VictorBG \njava\npublic void setStatusBarColor(@ColorInt int color) {\n        result.getDrawerLayout().setStatusBarBackgroundColor(color);\n}\nshould work, and also works in the sample activity? Can you provide a sample app showcasing what else you do and that it does not work?\n. So you are not sure how to pass or define the listener itself? \n. @sagits no problem. \nIn general I never use it. So as of my assumption it is unnecessary. set this to false: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L548 . material_drawer_hint_text . @mdtuyen thanks for answering. @davidcesarino thanks for the detailed description. \nThis is shown in the sample activity. It's withSelectable()\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L119. @sunpeijie0 the items are displayed in a RecyclerView. I have no experience with keyboard up / down. Please just look up how this can be achieved with a RV. I might accept a PR if it is not too much or a change. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1625. @rakesh1988 the sample app does just show how to use the drawer. the drawer has the events where you can do whatever you wish. that's up to you. \nhandling the state is nothing the drawer should care about (the same as for the default drawer from the design lib). The interaction is correct. \nIf you would love to add support for the other implementation, please just open a PR. The interaction is correct. \nIf you would love to add support for the other implementation, please just open a PR. @tomdiinur  if you update a sublist of a collapseable item you have to notify the adapter that it's subitems were changed.\nPlease read more here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1260#issuecomment-218735178\n. @ankitbatra11 sorry this is not MaterialDrawer related. \nBut it seems like you are also doing this after the activity was destroyed. @dexion the StickyFooter can't have SubItems . Because the sticky footer is basically a LinearLayout with the flat items in. It is no RecyclerView which may handle all their child views too. . After some time thinking about this. It's currently not on my list of features I will add. \nI would be happy about a PR though. @BRoy98 you will have to handle the ActionBarDrawerToggle logic on your own. Just don't pass the Toolbar to the drawer, and then you can handle it on your own. @Kolobok163rus have you cleaned your project? Do you have a bad proguard config? Do you have older versions of one of my other libs in the project?. @Kolobok163rus so you don't have any of my other libraries as dependency?\nWhat's your support lib version? . @Kolobok163rus so you don't have any of my other libraries as dependency?\nWhat's your support lib version? . @npomfret make sure the support libs do not conflict. you can exclude the (in the lib) defined version if you have a different one.

For this to work you then also need to make sure your items have identifiers\n. @davidesoldan ok after another deep look. The problem is the following. the FastAdapter would not be able to select the item with the identifier as it is currently not in the list. So:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L1051\nwon't return an item if it is not currently shown. \nIf you still want to select it. Keep this one:\njava\ndrawer.getAdapter().withPositionBasedStateManagement(false);\nand then just set the item itself selected. \njava\nyouSubItem.withSetSelected(true). @davidesoldan that's exactly the same for the drawer itself. You will have to know the item which you want to select. don't you know the parent?. @zTrap the best for this approach is if you programatically decide if you are on phone or tablet. \nIf you are on phone you will use the normal .build() \nIf you are on a tablet, you use the .buildView() method and add the returned view to your layout programatically.

Btw. on pre lollipop. Seems the fallback to the normal generated images is faulty from the android sdk. Not much I can do about that. . @amorenew thank you very much. . @Yundin the restore state can only retain the selected position. It can't save elements added by the user. That logic is up to the developer using the drawer. . how does the rest of your item look like? Do you even have the selectable boolean in your item? Or do you use the AbstractDrawerItem? You should also call the super method on the bindView\nBy the way. why don't you use the default functionality of the ColorStateList there should be no necessity to handle this on your own. could it be possibly realted to databinding?. @bbetter sorry for the very very late answer. Yes it is important. \nHave you solved it by then? Please report back and re-open if it'S still an issue. @pharma-vie what do you mean? \nthe logic for the content is up to you. nothing library specific. @bagrusss the header itself just takes an image. it does not use this logic. \nIf you want to load an image via glide or picasso.

If my assumption is correct the space is added through the fitsSystemWindows flag which exists on the drawer content.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_slider.xml#L11\nyou might be able to toggle this programatically if you know that the drawer will now be displayed in fullscreen. . @SupremeProj ok I just checked again. in the FullscreenDrawerActivity this is already done like this and works. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/FullscreenDrawerActivity.java#L81. @SupremeProj oh really? I just tried it on my device and it did not have this space. \nWhat's your phone and android version?\n. Hmmm it might be a KitKat issue. \nIf I am not wrong NavBar in landscape is not transparent. Nothing we can change here. \n. @RedEagle07 you will have to implement a CustomDrawerItem for this.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md\n. @Mygod makes sense as in the persistent drawer scenario there is no DrawerLayout so you can't (and don't ahve to provide the Toolbar) . as a ActionBarDrawerToggle wouldn't be used anyway.\nPlease just don't pass the toolbar in the landscape mode . the CrossFader and the slider is just part of your normal view hierarchy. Theoretically yes. \nBut you can also do it like this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/blob/b92469119c5c23067794db8bc7184de3b42c85dd/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/crossfader/app/SimpleActivity.java#L137. @NovaViper the sample just shows different activities as I have different independent activities showing different drawer behaviors. \nThe reason why setting the fragment in the first place does not work, because you are trying to start an activity. \nThe second exception even exactly writes you what is going wrong. It can't find: com.nova.apps.trinitylocker:id/content_layout \nThe Drawer gives you all the callbacks you need, so it will inform you that the user clicked. all the rest is up to you, what will happen in this case. \nSwitching fragments is nothing library specific. Please just use stackoverflow and google to search for the proper implementation of commiting and changing fragments. @NovaViper the MaterialDrawer itself brings the ui elements you need inside a DrawerLayout to display a drawer as defined in the Google Material Design Guidelines, and a wrapper around these things which will handle DrawerLayout creation, ActionBarDrawerToggle creation etc. And a nice API so you can fill the drawer programatically without any issues. \nIt also gives you all the listeners and callbacks you may need to interact. \nThe part where you than commit a fragment or launch an acitvity is up to you, as also in the google drawer itself, as the library can't handle (and shouldn't) handle this for you. @NovaViper exactly. The MaterialDrawer provides the Drawer nothing else. It's up to you if you want to have a Toolbar how your content will look like, how navigation works. etc. \nThe drawer library will just take care you don't have to care about the drawer, and the items and their design. good luck :). I think as of the moment clicking a non selectable icon won't trigger the click listener. \nYou might need to directly hook in the adapter of the MiniDrawer and add a preClickListener . 1.) There is no method to do this. as it is not in the material design guidelines. You can overwrite the layout of the header though, and then access the view. \n2.) just set the selection, and enable that the first selectionw ill fire a event, so you can handle the committing of this fragment\n3.) just use one of the possible listeners\n4.) you have to adjust the ProfileDrawerItem and then notify the drawer about the updated item. I think the toast is not shown when this activity finishes\n. what do you mean you can't load the image\ndo you have the DrawerImageLoader set up as shown in the readme?\n. Great :D. @PabloDesiderioFlores hi. Have you found a solution already?\nThe MiniDrawer is no DrawerLayout so that code won't work. The MiniDrawer is inside a SlidingPaneLayout which behaves differently. I expect there not to be available pre-recipes for espresso. \nPlease report back if this is still a topic and reopen if yse. what support library version does your project use? Please always use the latest support libraries in combination with this lib. (or exclude them). I meant of the \"support libraries\". it is a reference to the root build.gradle version:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/build.gradle#L8\nyou have to use the smae support lib version for all the libs, otherwise such issues occur. \nAnd I highly recommend you to update yours too to 25.1.0\notherwise you have to exclude the support libs of the MAterialDrawer\nsimilar to this snippet: http://stackoverflow.com/a/27116437/325479. @SupremeProj I remember I had this fixed at some point. Are you using the latest version?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1582. Can you try: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L57. hmmm you would need to set the whole application to LTR mode I think. opening it from the right is automatically handled by the DrawerLayout and from the system.. @ivanstojkovicapps the Toolbar is not handled by the drawer. please make sure you correctly set the theme to the Toolbar (you can see samples in the sample application though). @DasserBasyouni the withOnlyOneExpandedItem was not created to work for deeper hierarchies.\nIf you want to collapse others but allow the single hierachy you will have to handle this manually.. @DasserBasyouni the MaterialDrawer's internals depend on the FastAdapter, so everything which is true for the FastAdapter is true for the MaterialDrawer\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter\nYou can get the FastAdapter via Drawer.getAdapter(). In general you will have to listen for the click event. and collapse items which are not inside the current hierarchy. \nSo you can get the current expanded elements via the FastAdapter. \nAnd the FastAdapter also has the methods which allow you to collapse an item. \nThe general complexity here is that nested collapsable hierarchies are not too easy to handle as many aspects have to be considered. \n. nothing depending to this library. please search for this on stackOverflow or google. @aitbaali thank you. \nYour request is not MaterialDrawer specific but DrawerLayout specific which comes from google. \nHere's a a StackOverflow question which might helps you: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20057084/how-to-move-main-content-with-drawer-layout-left-side. which DrawerItem are you using?.

Close as inactive for too long. Please report back if this is still an issue.. @boswelja you want to set the background or the image of the profile?\nfor the image of the profile. please read the readme and add a DrawerImageLoader to your project\nfor the header, just get the ImageView (the headerBackground) of the AccountHeader and set the image on it. @boswelja because the Drawer does not contain a image loading library. so it does not know what to do with this uri then. As I do not want to force devs into a library, they are able to choose their prefered lib via the DrawerImageLoader. @connectedhealthcaremy sorry I am not quite sure. What fix Id's? \nIf you fill the drawer during the generation with all items those id's won't change anymore. they will stay the same, they will only change if you set new items in addition. where do you fill the drawer? in your onResume? Perhaps you should make sure it is just filled in onCreate or that you define the identifier on your own and give unique id's to your items. @PawelPleskaczynski you can set the selection to -1 and you can also make items withSelectable(false). @derpcoder the DividerDrawerItem extends AbstractDrawerItem and calls it's super of the bindView method which sets the tag:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/AbstractDrawerItem.java#L319. @therealccarter managing the backstack is up to you and is not related to the drawer. The developer decides what to do after he got the event. \nIn addition. the drawer will normally close, only if you disable this or consume the click event it won't close. So make sure that you return false in the click listener. Which version of the drawer / iconics do you use?. @TshineZheng seems like this is not properly supported in the android framework.

So without the line also the drawer is in place and so on? \nSo we can close the issue?. @sutinerr you will have to implement your own CustomDrawerItem which has a EditText in it. \nRemember that the drawer's items are displayed in a RecyclerView so items may be re-used and recycled. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md. @sutinerr the text is on the right side anyways normally. (If the app is in RTL mode it will be in the opposite way). @sutinerr the sample shows how you can create any item CustomDrawerItem using any layout, so also an EditText . Here are a few: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems\nBasically a CustomDrawerItem can be as simpel as this one: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/DividerDrawerItem.java\nprovide a layout, define the viewholder, define the bindView logic, set the type (can be the layout id too, just ignore the warning) That's it. @aliakbar1997 via the available methods of the items? \nFor different size oft the font's you will have to adjust the dimensions. Those are fixed, as the defined values are the ones as defined in the google material design guidelines, and shall not be changed. Just define the sizes in your dimens.xml which you want:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml. @aliakbar1997 you just define such a dimension in your dimens.xml and it will be automatically applied to your items. \nThe default DrawerItems do not allow you to programatically alter the text size (as it is just not needed --> default items look like as defined in the material design guidelines)\nIf you want to change this programatically you will have to write your own CustomDrawerItem see the FAQ for more details. @SatanPandeya the header only allows one line for each text. \nIf you want to adjust the layout for the header, the best would be for you to simply overwrite the header layout, and modify it to your needs (do not remove views with identifier, or change their view type) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml. @aliakbar1997 as already mentioned in your previous issue, either you just define the dimensions in the xml. \nOr you create a CustomDrawerItem with adjustable textsize. \nThe sample already showcases a few custom implementations (based on default items) too. @akabirami by default this is not possible, You can overwrite the used layouts though (copy paste the xml (with the same name) to your project. and add the shown arrow) \nAfter this you can access the AccountHeader's view and set any listener on it you need. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml. @Rushabhs999 make sure the image you use is not too large. \nThis is also independent of the lib, as it is normal android image displaying. @Rushabhs999 perhaps you network is slow, or anything. The whole logic for this is completely independent of the drawer and is handled by your imageloader. @Rushabhs999 no there is not as it is not extending ImageView. You can provide a Drawable, Bitmap, or URL to the drawer. (For the url part, just look at the documentation + sample app, which shows how the drawer can download images for you)\nIf you need something else, you might have to do everything on your own. . @Yanis007 you have to make sure that if you click the back button, that the first item is selected (and the lower one deselected) as it will not fire again if it is already selected. @EpsilonOrionis this are always a bit tricky things :D especially as it comes back to the \"fitsSystemWindows\" flag :D \nIf you have a small demo I can try and debug and test around it would speed up to find a solution :D. @EpsilonOrionis I mean a tiny sample app so I directly can alter the code and tell you what was necessary to fix it. @EpsilonOrionis thank you so much. it really helps me, as I can focus on solving the issue rather than first reproducing :). @EpsilonOrionis remove the build folders, the dist folders, the gradlew folder then it should be down already by a huge amount, zip it :)\nYou can send it also as e-mail if you prefer. exactly. I didn't get it yet. oh :D please upload it simply to google drive and sent a link or so :). Thank you I'll check it out. Ok.

Make sure the drawable is big enough. @OsamaDroidEgypt the MaterialDrawer does not do anything with the toggle. That's all basic Android stuff. \nIf you have an RTL application it will automatically switch if the app is in RTL mode + the app is API 17+. @OsamaDroidEgypt what do you mean? \nYou can implement CustomDrawerItems if you want to. Please just read the FAQ article. Thank you, looks good. @hra1368 if your application is in RTL mode that happens automatically, if not and you don't want RTL mode, just set the gravity for the drawer. it should work the same for the CrossfadeDrawerLayout if your application is in real RTL mode (and API 17+) it will work. it should work the same for the CrossfadeDrawerLayout if your application is in real RTL mode (and API 17+) it will work.

Are your items possibly withSelectable(false)?. @abhay7030 the problem is that you launch a new activity, which will not keep the state for the drawer (normally the drawer is used with fragments) (the sample uses activities as it is only there to showcase all different cases of drawers)\nIn your case you should not only set the selection for the result, but also for the MiniDrawer \njava\nresult.setSelection(5);\nminiResult.setSelection(5);. @akabirami just set no icon? Or an empty transparent icon?\nThat's shown in the sample :D just define the item withSelectable(false) and for set the default selection to -1. new ColorDrawable(Color.TRANSPARENT) or so? . new ColorDrawable(Color.TRANSPARENT) or so? . @roostaamir the getType() method has to return a unique result per item.

It will just set the ActionBarDrawerToggle for you if you provide the Toolbar via the builder (that's the only thing) \nEverything is up to you, and independent of this library.. Close for now as nothing was reported back. @lizhengxian1991 what do you mean with withHeader() does not work?\nThe MultiDrawerActivity sample uses a custom header: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java#L43 and it works as you can see in the sample app. @lizhengxian1991 I know. I chose it to behave like this, as the sample is just there to showcase some different configurations of the drawer.\nStill thanks for pointing out.. @larkKent sorry this can't be fixed by the library. it's default behavior of Google's provided DrawerLayout. @alok96 you mean the scrim color? \nget the DrawerLayout from the Drawer and set the Scrim-Color to transparent. \n(This is against the guidelines though, and touching outside will still close the drawer) \n--> That's DrawerLayout functionality and not related to this library by the way. @carmas123 so you have created the drawer for an activity and then you want to remove it? \nYou can either remove the DrawerLayout from your view hierachy (manually) \nor you lock the Slider of the drawer, or you remove the Slider of the drawer from the view hierachy. \nBut that are cases which is specific to your project, and no convenient methods are available in the drawer for this. \n. Why don't you just switch the content? It is very very very very inefficient if you recreate a whole DrawerLayout over and over again for each fragment. \nInstead you should consider having the Drawer in your activity, and you just define from your fragment if the drawer is visible (if not just lock it and remove the hamburger of the toolbar) and in addition also define what it should show. DrawerLayout.setDrawerLockMode. You're welcome. @sondangpangaribuan this is not an issue for this library. This is defined by the DrawerLayout and not configureable (as far as I know)\n. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html. @Baxtiyor1992 the elements in the Drawer are displayed in a normal RecyclerView you can get the reference to it via the Drawer\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L220\nThen you can simply use the RV scroll methods :). @harshj94 this problem happens because of the Android system wrongly passing through the selected state to the StateListDrawable. \nYou can try to set the following on the MiniDrawer:\njava\nminiResult.getAdapter().withSelectWithItemUpdate(true);. @jeshurun thank you for the PR. but sadly I can't merge this as it contains the whole commit history of the repo. \nPlease use the github online file edition feature to add your app, and auto create the PR via it. \nThank you. @jeshurun thank you :). This time it's fine. Sorry I do not give support for Xamarin. This is only for real Android Studio projects. \n(I know there were some projects which ported the Drawer over to Xamarin, you may be able to find it. Please refer there then if you need help). https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDrawerItem.java#L144. @thaindq yes it is possible. You just have to create a CustomProfileItem. (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java is the default one, you can base on this. extend it. whatever you need) \nThere is a method which allows you to toggle the current state. So you can toggle to show the profile list. (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L101) \nWith that same method. \nYou can. You basically build the header independent of the DrawerBuilder and then set it's view as sticky header. \n. you can overwrite the xml of the header. Just copy the xml used by the drawer to your project (keep it's name) and adjust it. (do not remove any view which has an identifier, or change their type). https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml. As mentioned. you copy that xml to your project and edit the layout. @nam2017 have you enabled tinting?. @RafaHDu the image should be square. ;). So the solution of @abdelhedinizar is nice ;)\notherwise you can adjust the ImageView's image scaletype the same way of editing the header layout\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1804. @aitorvs collapsed items are not selectable, as they are currently not actively displayed in the list. You will have to set the withPositionBasedStateManagement(false) so it will switch to id based system. \nIt might work then already for you.... @aitorvs so the Drawer uses the FastAdapter to fill the RecyclerView with the items. This also provides the `expandable functionality. \nIf an item is not displayed it won't be included directly for selection. \nSo you will have to set the item as selected and then notify the drawer that the subitems were updated. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/FastAdapter.java#L1692\nThis will only work for the first level though.. @aitorvs I meant you have to set on the specific DrawerItem that it is selected. the method setSelection() would not select subitems. \nso you set the subitem selected. and if it is visible you should also call the notifyAdapterSubItemsChagned as you correctly do. \nThere was more focus on filling lists fast, and having for normal lists selection, than for more complex sub/expandable hierachies, which results in this being not as simple as the rest. Sorry.. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url. @AleSpero expandable items are not supported (and there is no plan to do so) in the MiniDrawer. it might be possible to work around this. but the MiniDrawer is meant for quick access for a few items, not many. \nbecause the first item is already selected, I guess. \nwithSelectable(true) will only prevent user input selection, not programatically selection which happens during init. You can set the default selection to  -1 or a different item. \nIf you need the initial event to be fired you can also do this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L781. Yeah. :D Great that you solved it. \nfor the second problem. So the main thing is why I didn't include this in the first place, is that it doesn't make too much sense to overfill this MiniDrawer. If it has only a small amount of elements it's good. It will also just show Primary items by default no SecondaryDrawerItems. \nYour solution would work, but you will have to make sure that both stay in sync and that you do not run into weird states. \nyou could theoretically have a look into the MiniDrawer implementation and overwrite it (listening to the expand from the normal drawer item and then just do the same in the MiniDrawer and visa vers, but do remember that it will require quite some logic to get it right (which is an additional reason why I didn't implement it, I wanted to keep such complex behaviours which are probably needed just in a few special apps)). Let me know if questions come up. @kolorszczak clicking works for none? just not for the first? are the items withSelectable(false) (which would prevent selection)? . what's the return value in your withOnDrawerItemClickListener?. @kolorszczak can you reproduce your issue in the sample code?. Please report back. I'll close for now. @aitorvs with the default position based statemanagment, the FastAdapter is only able to keep selections for items which are visible in the list (so only root elements), non existing elements (so those without a position (including sub items)) can't stay selected. (you can toggle this with here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L879) \nin addition, you can prevent the drawer from auto-closing if you do not want this. \n. @aitorvs ok let me try to produce a sample . @aitorvs can you please update to v25.3.0 and try again with the withPositionBasedStateManagement(false) flag? I found this was not correctly passed to the adapter, resulting it not being used. Thank you for your time, and helping to get this fixed :)\n. @andris95 I am not sure what the screenshot should show. \nYou can alter the layouts used for the drawer, and add overlapping views.. you can overwrite this layout and add another view in it. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_slider.xml\n(do not alter id's or anything, just add your progressbar) \nyou can then get the reference to that view from the drawer, and show / hide your progressbar. make sure it is in front and not overlapped by the list. \n. @meddd not for the default items, as those have their default defined (material design guidelines specific) background\nYou can implement your own CustomDrawerItem which has a different background. (the sample app contains a sample for this). The method is in place: https://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialize/util/UIUtils.java#L335 \nWhich version of Materialize are you using?\nWhich version of MaterialDrawer are you using?. do you have other libraries from me in your project? . if 5.8.2 of the MaterialDrawer works for you. Please stay with this for now. I'll check what might cause the problem with that method. @Pareshoct7 ah you didn't mention that. v5.8.2 is definitely working for people. So something has to be strange about your setup. Do you have proguard enabled? \nAnd can you please make a dependencytree via gradle and send the output: \ngradle\ngradle app:dependencies. Yes. There is just something causing a conflict. \nHave you cleaned your project after setting the different version number?. Can you please first send the output of the dependency tree?\n. gradle app:dependencies. Could you please report back? Close this for now, as it is definitely not a library issue. @waterwheelcreative if you do not want to have RTL aligned content you should disable RTL support for your application at all. \nThe MaterialDrawer does not handle this at all, and only the android system is managing this.  (the MaterialDrawer only made sure that the layouts are compatible to be displayed in RTL). @waterwheelcreative it is not a MaterialDrawer specific topic. It's more or less basic Android question / issue, as the MaterialDrawer simply displays a string within a TextView . Here you can see the layout used for the MaterialDrawer's PrimaryDrawerItem:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml#L32. @akabirami no, but you can simply get the reference to that view from the Drawer object. @saharmohamady it might be possible, but I can't give support for this. \nhaving different levels is also possible in the MaterialDrawer. Nice idea. I have to give it a closer look.. @zunjae thanks for the suggestion, but this is not planned and will not be added to the library. \nIn my opionion removing the item / vs adding this item (2 lines in total) is still shorter than setting the drawerItem to shouldBeShown(true/false) . and then notifying the drawer about the change (in total 4 lines). https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#how-can-i-create-a-drawer-without-a-default-selection. @marijap93 so you want to have a drawer like the normal drawer, but just with the MiniDrawer as content? \nThen I suggest you simply use the DrawerLayout from the support library, and set the MiniDrawer view as it's slider content.. There is a way to do this. but this library does not provide such a way, and I assume you will have to implement this on your own. \nThe library offers the approach via the Crossfader which you are using already I assume. (the one moving the content out of the window)\nAnd the other one which is the CrossfadeDrawerLayout which basically has 3 Stages. \n- nothing shown, minidrawer shown, full drawer shown. \nIn your case you will have to implement your own layout, or framelayout, which will just lay over the other view if swiped. doing basically the similar thing as the DrawerLayout just with a locked first state.. @DenisMakovskyi you can also use this one: \ngradle\nconfigurations.all {\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:cardview-v7:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:design:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:percent:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:preference-v14:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:customtabs:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:support-annotations:${versions.supportLib}\"\n}. Closing this here as it is a FastAdapter topic for v3. Closing until more details are provided as it was not reproduceable. @PetarCeho01 the drawer has the listener which is fired when an item is clicked. \nDo whatever you want in there.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#add-items-and-adding-some-functionality. @PetarCeho01 please be a bit more specific I am not sure what you are trying to do. \nThe Sample application shows how to set up a normal drawer with an AccountHeader:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java. @PetarCeho01 you can't you need a different click listener for the accountheader and also the one for the drawer. \nIf you call the same method from those then it's fine. but still...\nSee the DrawerActivity it adds a ACcountHeaderListener which allows you to react on clicks in the AccountHeader\n```java\n.withOnAccountHeaderListener(new AccountHeader.OnAccountHeaderListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public boolean onProfileChanged(View view, IProfile profile, boolean current) {\n                        //sample usage of the onProfileChanged listener\n                        //if the clicked item has the identifier 1 add a new profile ;)\n                        if (profile instanceof IDrawerItem && profile.getIdentifier() == PROFILE_SETTING) {\n                            int count = 100 + headerResult.getProfiles().size() + 1;\n                            IProfile newProfile = new ProfileDrawerItem().withNameShown(true).withName(\"Batman\" + count).withEmail(\"batman\" + count + \"@gmail.com\").withIcon(R.drawable.profile5).withIdentifier(count);\n                            if (headerResult.getProfiles() != null) {\n                                //we know that there are 2 setting elements. set the new profile above them ;)\n                                headerResult.addProfile(newProfile, headerResult.getProfiles().size() - 2);\n                            } else {\n                                headerResult.addProfiles(newProfile);\n                            }\n                        }\n                    //false if you have not consumed the event and it should close the drawer\n                    return false;\n                }\n            })\n\n```. I am not sure why a sample for this is needed. Launching an activity is one of Android's basics. That's nothing I need to show in the lib. \nJust launch the activity you want to see depnding on the item which was clicked. Stackoverflow will help you how to launch an activity. Your other items are not withSelectable(false) selectable.. so they will never be highlighted. \nOnly calling withSetSelected(..) on the item after the drawer was created won't directly update. You have to notify the drawer about the updated item. (Basically as in a normal RV)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer. @ryannmahajan that's correct just calling withSetSelected() does NOT highlight. in that case you should notify the Drawer about the updated item. \nBut in general I would anyways say that you should use the provided methods from the drawer to set the selection, as this is the only way how it would handle the state upon configuration changes for example. withSelectable(false) will only prevent the user from selecting it. programmatically you can always select it. if you want to have no selection at all (which seems weird :D) you can do that by setting the selection to \"-1\". so you don't want profiles at all? So simply don't define profiles? \nWhat are you using the profiles for?. so you have 2 items in the profiles? the profile itself and the logout item?. @hydroid7 thanks for the PR, but I do not think this should be added as it was just a sample to fix an issue. nothing official. @zsmb13 in terms of \"method-count\" it might be better to just add the possibility to pass in the DimenHolder or StringHolder, ... \n. @zsmb13 it would be really great if you could do the pull request. (Keep the old method available and just add the one providing the possibility to pass in the Holder) \nThanks. @zsmb13 for the StringHolder that makes sense :D. @EpsilonOrionis I guess you will have to apply padding or margin at the bottom of the BottomSheet. Other than this, you might be able to adjust the insets of the ScrimInsetsRelativeLayout when the BottomSheet is shown, but could be tricky. But the margin of the NavigationBar can be retrieved programatically\njava\npublic static int getNavBarHeight(Context context) {\n        Resources resources = context.getResources();\n        int resourceId = resources.getIdentifier(\"navigation_bar_height\", \"dimen\", \"android\");\n        if (resourceId > 0) {\n            return resources.getDimensionPixelSize(resourceId);\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\nAnd you can also check if there is a navBar\n```java\npublic static boolean hasNavBar(Context context) {\n        Resources res = context.getResources();\n        int resourceId = res.getIdentifier(\"config_showNavigationBar\", \"bool\", \"android\");\n    if (resourceId != 0) {\n        return res.getBoolean(resourceId);\n    } else { // fallback\n        return !ViewConfiguration.get(context).hasPermanentMenuKey();\n    }\n}\n\n```. Haha @EpsilonOrionis normally I wait at least 2 weeks without an answer before closing issues :D But I'd re-open if new interaction happens ;). @EpsilonOrionis awesome :) thank you very much. @zsmb13 looks nice :). I'll test and merge. Thanks very much!. @zsmb13 saw your kotlin wrapper :). Nice work. (https://github.com/zsmb13/MaterialDrawerKt) . @PetarCeho01 I do not understand. The ProfileDrawerItem provides already the methods to pass a e-mail and a name and an icon?!. Well as the project is open-source you can look here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L84\nYou can set the name and e-mail. And no why would you pass views into an item?!. I do not understand what the problem is. The Item allows you to define those values. The sample + the readme shows how to add items to the drawer. The AccountHeader has an add method to add profiles. \n. @PetarCeho01 I still do not understand. You want to have a different layout for the ProfileDrawerItem? Why would you want this? The default already allows to set email and name. \nIf you want something completely custom please read the FAQ: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md it's besically the same for ProfileDrawerItem's. @LorenzoZoia you could consume the event in the click listener if it's a subitem. @LorenzoZoia don'T you have a DrawerItemClickListener to do something when the user clicks an item?. Setting an ExpandableItem withSelectable(false) will also prevent the closing, as shown in the DrawerActivity of the sample app: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L138. Setting an ExpandableItem withSelectable(false) will also prevent the closing, as shown in the DrawerActivity of the sample app: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L138. @regiskakashi the drawer provides 2 configuration options, you can postpone the click listener being fired after a specific duration. Or you can postpone the closing after a specific time. \nBasically that's unrelated to the library and will also happen if you only use the DrawerLayout, as replacing a fragment is a \"expensive\" operation. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1103\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1120\n. triggerClickEventAfterMenuCollapsed sorry there will be no such method as you can already control the delay. And the delay might be different on the stuff you do. so there is no general rule which value is correct. @rgocal if you have an url you need to init the DrawerImageLoader as shown in the sample. If you have a drawable pass it to the ProfileDrawerItem if passed during drawer creation it's fine. If at a later time make sure to notify about the item being updated. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L65\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L28. What crashes? Do you have a log?. @rgocal you probably try to set an empty string or null or a non valid url as image. Don't do this and you are good. Wrong project. The Android-Iconics is here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics \nPlease re-open over there. yeah I updated the internal Android-Iconics version ;). Please still open the issue on the correct project so I can keep the overview about the open source projects I manage. @oscargc sorry for the late answer, must have missed the question. \nI checked it and you are right, it's basically a result of the way how the underlaying FastAdapter handle's expandable items, if the parent is updated it will collapse the childs. This will be improved in v3 of the FastAdapter until then please use the following snippet:\njava\n//get the item from our drawerItem\nExpandableBadgeDrawerItem d = (ExpandableBadgeDrawerItem) drawerItem;\n//remove the badge\nd.withBadge((StringHolder) null);\n//notify the adapter that the item was changed\nresult.getAdapter().notifyItemChanged(result.getPosition(18));. @oscargc sorry for the late answer, must have missed the question. \nI checked it and you are right, it's basically a result of the way how the underlaying FastAdapter handle's expandable items, if the parent is updated it will collapse the childs.

Hmmm I am almost 100% sure that this should not be necessary. I'll have to try again in the sample. Just tested again. Changing the icon at a later time works.. Just tested again. Changing the icon at a later time works.. @AleSpero thanks for answering.\n@amrfarid140 as already corretly answered. The Mini + normal Drawer usecase does not use the DrawerLayout so it won't automatically use the ActionBarDrawerToggle, as it requires a DrawerLayout. there are some libs out there which do not have that requirement and basically show the same animation\n. Either you use the MaterialDrawer or the NavigationView you can't use both. The MaterialDrawer simplifies most tasks for you. You do not have to define the DrawerLayout or anything special in the layout just check out the samples ;). @fermatijoe just check out the source code of the sample app. It's very simply java code. \nAlso read the README. \nyes. That's an empty drawer if you do not provide items.. @wistorm sorry only issues in english. @emami7495 simply consume the event if the user clicks on an item. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L105. @brucexia you want to have a Spannable passed in. Good idea. You might want to open a PR allowing this. Will be adjusted in the materialize lib and then updated int he drawer. Will be adjusted in the materialize lib and then updated int he drawer. @brucexia if you want to only update a specific piece, I'd recommend you that you implement a custom drawerItem like you'd normally would do using the fastadapter. And then you just notify the drawer about the updated item + payload. \nas an alternative you can remove the animation while updating, so it won't flash. @vatsa92 the Drawer object already gives you the ability to access one of its views. \nthere is another open issue requesting somethihng similar. --> Keep the sticky drawer items also in the profile selection .Is this similar to your needs?. I sadly haven't had time yet to implement this. But there is another feature request exactly for that scenario: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1819\nI'll close that one and keep the other open as it is a duplicate then :). @sidharthanil  there is no listener pre-defined for that. But you can get a reference to the View from the Drawer object, and set your own listener on whatever view you need to\n. Please open a PR and add it at the end of the list. That's why you have to do a pull request.\nOn Fri, May 19, 2017, 11:05 AM Florent Anders notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI am being told that I have no access to the repo?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1862#issuecomment-302772175,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABaGiJ9111Yx4O38olLgXPT70qdXXtKJks5r7dnwgaJpZM4Ngj9x\n.\n-- \nMike Penz\n\n\nMike Penz\nAndroid | Backend | Open Source | Web Developer\nmikepenz.com\nlanora.io\n.

I forgot to release on maven central, after I did it should be fine. Until then just add the sub dependencies too. Thank you. Thank you. @pdapnz well you can disable via the listener that the drawer is closed via a item click (just consume the event by returning true) and you can set the drawer in the locked state using the DrawerLayout api. \nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html#setDrawerLockMode(int, android.view.View)\nAnd the hamburger icon shouldn't be visible anyways as the drawer should go over it. \n. @jahirfiquitiva you can build as many custom drawerItems as you need :) The drawer's interface allows you to do this. \nBasically look at the source of the Toggle or Switch drawerItem and replace it with the checkbox and the \"tag\" like style on for the TextView \nThat's kinda easy. \nIt's basically the whole idea behind the MaterialDrawer about being open and flexible, and allowing the dev to do whatever he wants to do. Awesome :) You can definitely add it to the sample app's source or to the FAQ just in case if someone wants it :). https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url. The profile items will by default show a placeholder icon. You can change that one using the DrawerImageLoader\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L72. @amanzan no.

Could it be that you call the above method each time a selection was done? and or more frequently? \nSetting the seleciton with .withSetSelected(drawer.getCurrentSelection() == labelCount.getId()) alone won't work. As it does not call the required methods. \nPlease use the methods mentioned in the README: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#selecting-an-item\nin addition. There is an updateItem method, no need to call updateName AND updateBadge. \n. @ankitbatra11 I don't see the mutate() anymore. can you please keep that? If you use a Drawable in multiple places which may have different states, this is required in Android. well then I'd need a sample application which showcases the issue, as it clearly does not happen in the provided sample app code. \nIt's hard to guess around, as I can't check what'S going on for real. @jtv7 can you please try to set a color which already contains the alpha information? (I might have an idea what could cause this). @jtv7 ok great. then I think I know where to fix. you can for the time being use the alpha via the color. v2.8.6 of the Android-Iconics library fixes this issue. @trialsNow your layout defines no height. it has to define a height, otherwise the layout is not able to calculate the proper one\n. @trialsNow your layout defines no height. it has to define a height, otherwise the layout is not able to calculate the proper one\n. can you please try to add:\nxml\n    android:adjustViewBounds=\"true\"\nto your linearLayout of the header?. @trialsNow well true. I just had the chance to look deeper, that's because the LayoutParams which are used to add this view are MATCH_PARENT, WRAP_CONTENT. \nAs I can't change the behaviour of this I'd suggest to simply do the following after creating the drawer:\njava\n        RelativeLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams = (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams) result.getStickyHeader().getLayoutParams();\n        layoutParams.height = Utils.convertDpToPx(this, YOUR_HEIGHT_IN_DP);\n        result.getStickyHeader().setLayoutParams(layoutParams);. @maksimsukalov which item do you use? . @maksimsukalov which item do you use? . If you base on the BaseDescribeAbleDrawerItem (which is base for PrimaryDrawerItem) we add some padding here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDescribeableDrawerItem.java#L105\nOther than that there is no padding as the item should span accross the full width of the drawer. for code formatting on github.. https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/. @maksimsukalov just checked a bit more, so it's either the padding method I linked you too, or something in your layout. \nBasically I set the background of the itemView to red, to make sure it fills the full line, and that worked. \n. https://medium.com/proandroiddev/itemdecoration-in-android-e18a0692d848. @trialsNow normally a NavigationDrawer is used if you have one root activity and then many sub-fragments. In your case you have multiple activities, which means you have to set-up the Drawer in each activity, as it wouldn't be able to do that automatically. \nMany people achieved this by having some kind of BaseActivity and initialising the drawer there, so the code is not duplicated. But that's more related to the structure of your project, and not really an issue related to the MaterialDrawer. @sweetdream0729 can you reproduce this in the sample application? \nDo you have too big images set for the profiles or for the header? . In the sample app?. @AllanWang thanks for answering :) . @trinhvanminh2009 many people have already achieved it by using activities. It's simply more complicated as the Drawer can't properly keep the state through the different activities, and you have to handle the positioning, ... \nMost people who did this created a BaseActivity which had the drawer code and so on. \nAlso remember that you can select a drawer item without calling the listener. (Just see the JavaDoc) \nAnd you can always handle more complex tasks by handling some things with the listener. . @AllanWang thanks for answering.\n@jordyamc well it is more or less related to the MaterialDrawer. It's basically default DrawerLayout behaviour you see here. The DrawerLayout from Android is like a ScrimInsetsLAyout so this one will control the color. \nSo you can directly use the method provided by the DrawerLayout:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1247#issuecomment-217641415\n. @Timodz thanks for answering. \n@DEV-NP yes please look in the sample app. @DEV-NP for this case I'd suggest you to go the good old way of manually implementing it. \nUse a DrawerLayout and add a list or a RecyclerView or a ScrollView with views with these icons to it. \nIt looks completely different as the MaterialDrawer and so I guess you can not take advantage of all its strengths. \n\nIn case you still want to do it with the MiniDrawer init your MiniDrawer get the reference to the view. and then add this view to a DrawerLayout which you defined in your layout. @Timodz as you add the MiniDrawer in the layout, it's up to you to position it. \nBeside that I am not 100% sure if the Crossfader allows to be used on the right side: https://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader\n. @Timodz if it's not yet supported I guess you will have to do a PR on the Crossfader or modify it's source as there are no current plans of adding this. \nBasically it's really up to you as for the MiniDrawer (And normal Drawer) you define where those views are added, and nothing is handled by the MaterialDrawer . @marcogenovese I am not sure if it is clever to change that now, as it possibly changes the behaviour for people who already have it in use. @marcogenovese well in general I gave people the hint to set a square image in the first place. \nBut I assume it isn't too bad. in the end if needed it can still be overwritten.. @SuperThomasLab sorry this is not supported. The Badge is only supported in the item list. @SuperThomasLab sadly there are no plans to do this, at last not right now. \nI will keep it in mind. Perhaps for v6.x, but I can't or won't promise anything :). \nYou might also want to open a PR and add this. \nI think it can be closed as there are no current plans to support this . Sorry that this is currently not part of the futures. @gmoraiz that's not a MaterialDrawer specific issue. \nPlease follow Android / Google's guide on how to get the latest support libraries. \nhttps://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html. @IgorGanapolsky please read the link. it does solve the problem. @jordyamc the MaterialDrawer set's a ActionBarDrawerToggle if the Toolbar is supplied. It's color or it's appearance is not controlled by the MaterialDrawer but rather from the supplied theme. \nYou can remove the Toolbar you pass to the MaterialDrawer and manually handle everything, or you look in the web on how to adjust the ActionBarDrawerToggle. (Normally the color is controlled via the theme you can set on the Toolbar)\nBut it's no MaterialDrawer issue. \n. @DEV-NP exactly the same answer as here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1910#issuecomment-309357884\nThe MiniDrawer is meant to be used with the Crossfader like shown in the sample. If you do only want to have the MiniDrawer you have to do that manually. Create it. Get the View add it to your own DrawerLayout . well as mentioned in the other issue. Your requirement does not look like it needs the MaterialDrawer. It makes no sense to use a library for that case. and it will be better for you to look up a tutorial on how to use the DrawerLayout \nThe MiniDrawer may look similar but it's use case is always meant with a normal Drawer. \n. Close until further information is provided. @uday-mshr could you please be a bit more specific. I am not sure what you are trying to achieve. @uday-mshr you can either have 2 or 3 small thumbs, and 1 big, there is no way to show less than this. \nPlease see the listener functions available:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L520\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L534\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L644. @LoburAlexander sorry for answering that late. Very interesting idea. I currently haven't planned to add this functionality. \nIf you really want or need it, I am more than happy to accept a pull request to add such a functionality. @siddworksinc you can simply disable the accountswitcher if you do not need it. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/accountheader_single_profile_without_dropdown.md. @siddworksinc well disabling this will only show an empty header. \nIn case that's not what you want. copy paste the original layout to your project. Keep the original name, and then modify to your needs. Remember. Do not remove any views which have an ID. Do not alter any parent type of those views. (A TextView has to stay (or extend) a TextView, a BezelImageView has to stay (or extend) a BezelImageView)\nThe gradle build will automatically use your xml of the project, and not the one from the library. @siddworksinc for nr. (1) I'd suggest just add another new FAQ article :) \nfor nr. (2). I do not see this, because the AccountHeader is meant to provide the Google Material Design Guidelines specified style. You do not have to use it, basically the drawer is as open and allows you to write a completely custom header altogether. :) \nAnd to be honest, I do not make (1) as public as I want to prevent unnecessary issues being opened, because devs use the library in a way it is not supposed to be used :D\nSo please do a FAQ article :) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ.md. Great :). @ATumbler as shown in the samples :) . https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1909#issuecomment-309219307. @efi-mk have you already debugged in? is activity the correct currently displayed activity?\nThe event you get from the MaterialDrawer is just a forwarded onClick event on the main thread. nothing special. \nIf you set a delay for the click it will be delayed with a handler but still:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/611adcf84936820c58e12630ca0c1af788662662/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1770\nThere must be some other issue in your code (like the wrong activity), why it does not show up. (or perhaps another code from you hides it too fast again.. @sosite well sticky footer items are just a tiny addition. in general those are mainly used in situation without a selection at all. so that's why setSelection()  does not care about them, and will never care about them :D\nand about the issue, sounds like I miss to add +1 thanks to the additional layout in the LinearLayout holding the sticky items. @EdwardtoGitHub why would you like to have a drawer within a fragment in the first place? \nBut well independent of that, seems your fragment is not reaching up to the top of the screen. You will have to make sure you set the fitsSystemWindows flag's property properly, and in addition you might have to use a ScrimInsetsLayout or so which does not inline your sub-views. \nAlso make sure you correctly init the drawer within the fragment (See the sample) (that's different from an activity). @ATumbler equally to the normal items (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer) , just change the item and then notify the AccountHeader about the updated item... (The AccountHeader has similar methods). @ATumbler no don't do this. This is really bad and will cause many problems. \nMake sure you do the notifying of the update on the UI thread. \nMake sure the profile has an identifier. . @ATumbler drawer.getDrawerLayout().setStatusBarBackgroundColor has nothing to do with the lfag. \nYou apply the flag as you did above, and then you apply the color with the setStatusBarBackgroundColor on the DrawerLayout. Please report back. Close for now. @RITCHIEHuang the crash is not related to that layout or to this library. This line just shows up, because the stack trace contains the whole view hierarchy. (including that layout inbetween). \nAs the top line of your StackTrace tells you, the crash happens because you are using a bitmap which is already recycled.\n. @aitorvs the best would be you set up a listener to be notified when the drawer is closed\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/611adcf84936820c58e12630ca0c1af788662662/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1150\nand then you simply check if the profile selection list is shown: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L110\nIf yes you close it, by toggling it:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L101. yeah the results of the builder for drawer and header should be remembered :). You are welcome :). https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L268 this methods support an array. \nAlternative you do not have to write the builder all at once. You can split it up ;) \nSo You can have:\njava\nAccountHeaderBuilder builder = new ...;\nbuilder. ...;\nfor(Whatever a : whatevers) {\n   builder.addProfile(a);\n}\nAccountHeader ah = builder.build();. @sweetdream0729 well there is no such function within the Drawer \nBut the Drawer object has a method to return it's 'view':\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L199\nYou should be able to use this to add the views you want: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L199\n(if you need to access a specific drawerItem --> remember it's a RecyclerView). everything is shown in the readme and in the sample app. @Boom618 simply do not pass the AccountHeader object to the DrawerBuilder instead build your AccountHeader, and then get it's view AccountHeader.getView(), just set this view as StickyHeader of the MaterialDrawer. @GoltsevEugene please define the preferred header height here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L604\n. @GoltsevEugene can you please try to set your header layout height as match_parent. \nHere's the item which will hold the header view basically: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerUtils.java#L242\nIn the sample it works with the following header layout:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/header.xml. @GoltsevEugene well I guess I have the issue. The LayoutParams are not applied to the header view, but to the divider here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ContainerDrawerItem.java#L117. @kalvian1060 thank you very much. \nHave you already debugged in, how far it goes? \nSo the toast is also not showing? or only the profile missing? \n. @kalvian1060 sorry, but I am a bit confused. So what is the issue now? You can't see the toast, or the drawer is not working?. can you please move the toast showing out of the condition, just to make sure it's not because the condition is never meet. just put it somewhere directly in the onProfileChanged so you see if it would be shown in general. Thank you very much. And did the toast show up?. great. @dhamdani666 which id?\nYou want to get it's view and access sub views?\nThis method returns the view of the header, then you can do whatever you want with it:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L274. @feraguiba well there is no such functionality as in your case there is no real DrawerLayout what you can do is to add a layout in front of your content, and set this visible / hidden depending on the dawer's visibility. and you will also set a color to it which is a little bit translucent. \nThis is definitely no drawer issue, the use case for the Crossfader is not meant to block the content on the right side. . @kkdroidgit the DrawerImageLoader has to be defined before the Drawer is created. \nYour code looks fine. (as shown here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L26)\nYou set the ProfileDrawerItem to the AccountHeader during creation? Did you test if the url is really working?\n. @kkdroidgit  please also see the sample application in which this works. . @trinhvanminh2009 which version of glide do you use?

The problem is you are using the DrawerImageLoader wrong. You should not define a specific url there. just use the url passed in. The idea behind that class is basically to allow any image loading library which is available in your project, I do not want to force anything specific. \nThe best would be to move the DrawerImageLoader definition in your application class as seen in the sample. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L40\nAnd then you just define the url for the user on your ProfileDrawerItem   as seen here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L51\n. @PramUkesh you just set the OnAccountHeaderProfileImageListener to your header...\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L400\nThe Builder provides all necessary methods.

The above code switches it to a single profile. \nIf you want only a header. then just use the withHeader function . Just have a look into the sample application, it already showcases some possibilities. Well I just asked for your requirement. As there is clearly some miscommunication. \nIf you only have one profile and do not want the arrow to show up and so in the header, the sent FAQ will work definitely as it was used by dozens before you the same way. @therealccarter could you please try again to describe what you want to achieve. Or provide a picture to show how it should look like? \nI am afraid that there is some confusion here.. @therealccarter why do you anyways add so many profiles if you don't need them? \nIf you just wan't 1 profile to be shown, and just the icon + the text without the arrow or the fucntion then\njava\n.withSelectionListEnabledForSingleProfile(false)\nwill work. \nBut as the method name already clearly states, this will only change the appearance in case there is only one, and exact only one profile defined. @therealccarter the drawer can't keep the objects, they are not serializeable. \nThe drawer will only keep positions of the selection. \nSomething in your code is adding more and more profiles. \nJust as a reminder. You do not have to use the AccountHeader you can simply also supply your own view. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1150. well looks like ithere are 2 different versions of the materialdrawer somewhere. have you cleaned your project?. Awesome. So it works now?. yes they only support top level items, and they most likely will never automatically handle sub items. \nIf you want to change sub items and so on, you should check the direct api's of the \u00b4FastAdapter\u00b4 project:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter. @GoltsevEugene sounds like some RTL switching issue. I am afraid I can't solve that. \nThe system is switching and handling the RTL switching of the layouts. \nI suppose you can try to provide different layout's for the RTL case and it possibly will handle it different, but that's out of the scope of this project itself. @GoltsevEugene either you copy paste the original xml of those items to your project (with the same name, the android build will take care of the rest) \nor you implement a CustomDrawerItem. @GoltsevEugene thanks for adding this here. \nYou are welcome. @carmas123 no there are no plans to do so. But you can simply achieve this by writing your own CustomDrawerItem for this case\nSee the sample app for other custom drawer items, or read the FAQ. @trinhvanminh2009 most likely you set the wrong url and glide can't load it. \nAs an alternative. If you chnage a profile's url you have to notify the drawer that the profile changed. When and where and how do you create the DrawerImageLoader? \nWhat's the code in it? \nHow do you set profile? \nWhen do you set the profile's image?. @trinhvanminh2009 could you please implement glide with the DrawerImageLoader as shown here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java#L40. @trinhvanminh2009 it does but you have to use the generated API:\nhttp://bumptech.github.io/glide/doc/placeholders.html\nand it also supports clear\nhttp://bumptech.github.io/glide/doc/targets.html.

Awesome :) \nCongratulations. Awesome :) \nCongratulations. @Jaguarhl withDisplayBelowStatusBar you should not need to set this at all. \nCheck out the sample app. I don't use it. With the proper theme everything is working fine. @Jaguarhl but did you try to use a different theme? \nWhat'S your setup? Did you check out the sample app. It does not need anything like this. hmmm one of those might break it though:\nxml\n        <item name=\"android:windowNoTitle\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowTranslucentStatus\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\nHow do you init the Drawer. Do you use the default way or do you add it somewhere else in the view hierachy?. hmmm but you do not use something like:\n.withRootView(R.id.drawer_container)\nand removing \n.withTranslucentStatusBar(true)\nin addition didn't help either?\nDid you check the sample apps drawer. This one is tested and works on all supported android versions. And also goes behind the StatusBar on android versions which are officially supported to do this. Don't use it. I just asked if you have something like this in use (you did not post the whole drawer creation)\nWell it depends on how and what you want to animate. Well the items itself are displayed in an RecyclerView that means all rules which apply to a RecyclerView for animating also applies here. \nBasically the DefaultItemAnimator is set, and if you remove an item It will animate alpha out I guess. \nThe MaterialDrawer uses internal the core of the FastAdapter so you can just call remove on a position and it will automatically notify the adapter.... @Jaguarhl have you had chance to try it? \nPlease report back. closing for now. @Jaguarhl thank you very much for your detailed solution. I am glad you got it working this way.\nI still wonder what causing the problem. But if your solution works for you it's fine ;). @chinkan this will change with the next major release, as I'll update to the FastAdapter v3 which will change things. \nFor now I am sorry that this is not supported. \nYou may be able to add the IDrawerItem interface to your item's and then you can use them in the drawer and in the other lists. And the Drawer also supports different item's themself as long as they implement the IDrawerItem. @henengel great :). @henengel does this one work properly in both cases?. ah ok I understand\nThanks a lot for adding it here. Added the good to know flag. @henengel I think that might be a result from here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L1179. @parmarravi I do not understand. \nPlease us the official android way of including dependencies: \ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.9.2@aar)\n.jar files are not supported as the library contains resources. . @parmarravi ok but why would this require to add a .jar to your project? \nA while ago I created a small sample commit to show how to adjust the MiniDrawer to allow custom items. You can see this herE:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/8deedf8470f19c74ed6b826fd5aadc4eaed506da. @parmarravi my link above shows how to implement a CustomMiniDrawerItem this should do the job. As you can see in the commit this was added. That's what you have to do. As mentioned the commit is showing how you can do it. It's custom behaviour . well the thing is that the with* methods still return the parent type. Extending does not change the return value. \njust keep your miniResult variable as MiniDrawer or do not chain the methods like htis. Sorry I can not give beginners support. \nIt's plain java. there's nothing complicated about...\nvar = new CustomMiniDrawer();\nvar.with...;\nvar.withInnerShadow()..;\nvar....\n. Well you have a conflict of v25.4.0 of the support libraries and the latest 26.x ones I guess. \nLandroid/support/v4/animation/AnimatorCompatHelper\nWhich dependencies do you use in your project?. @RustamIbragimov could it be that your MiniDrawer and normal Drawer are not properly linked together? Have you checked out the sample app. oh do you do the selection via code or manually?. Makes absolutely sense. \nthe false will prevent the listener from being called. The MiniDrawer and the normal Drawer are hooked together via the listener\nSo you will also have to set the selection on the miniDrawer directly (or you set the listener fireing to true, which is possibly not what you want) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/MiniDrawer.java#L410. @Zhelyazko well you don't have to use switchDrawerContent() that one was basically designed for keeping 2 different sets (like the use case for the AccountHeader) Even without that method you can add and remove item's during runtime. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\nThe item (CustomDrawerItem's) have to implement the IDrawerItem interface. Which basically combines model + UI code (which you would normally write in an adapter)\nWell the layout can be replaced, but only while building. and it breaks the purpose of the MaterialDrawer somehow. I'd recommend you to make your element you want to display as CustomDrawerItem (see the samples. they can be quite simple, the default items are more complex as they have to provide many settings and configuration options) \nOtherwise. The Drawer object gives you access to the View's so you can theoretically add your own RecyclerView and display it above the default one (set visibility gone) but I can't really give support for that use-case. Ok great. . no sub-items?\n. Hmmm @atulgoswami21 \nCan you copy paste and try what I had in the sample for a long time: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L120\nthanks. fascinating. is this with proguard or anything which might break it?\nwhich support library version do you use?\nwhich build tools, ...?\n. @atulgoswami21 @Timmmeeeh can you please try the sample app I uploaded of the latest release. I enabled the expandable item again and I can see the arrow. @Timmmeeeh can you please try the latest library version again and see what happens?. @zsmb13 thanks for answering :). @zsmb13 thanks :). @Jspascal it is definitely included. please clean, sync gradle, make sure everything is downloaded and ready. \n(I decompiled the online available library and it is in). \n. @EdwardtoGitHub that's not supported by the DrawerLayout. Which is not by me, but from android support libraries. @freundyotam if you have a Toolbar just pass it to the Drawer and you don't have to care about it. \nIf not. just use the Drawer's open / close methods. @ravigupta9363 the default provided drawer items follow the google material design guidelines. And I highly suggest you stick with it. \nOtherwise you can adjust some values here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml\nAnd if you need total custom behaviour. Have a look on how you can implement a CustomDrawerItem\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md. You might want to look into this sample: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CollapsingToolbarActivity.java\nThe samples show all different cases. Also look in the DrawerActivity which is the default one, which also shows how to use it with a Toolbar without any problems. @AlaaZarifa if you need a different style which is not supported by default. Please implement your own CustomDrawerItem\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md. @AlaaZarifa it definitely does as there are some samples shown how to implement custom drawer items. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems\nIt is possible to modify everything to fit someone's needs. But I can't to tutorials for every ones special requests. @kolorszczak well the libs use support library 26, which also requires compile 26. \nIf you do not use this, you have to either exclude the support libs of my library or you use an older version using older support libraries. well the above is almost definitely a sign that there are some different variants of the support libraries. \nIf you want to force same versions you can do something like this:\njava\nconfigurations.all {\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:support-v4:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:cardview-v7:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:design:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:percent:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:preference-v14:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:customtabs:${versions.supportLib}\"\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:support-annotations:${versions.supportLib}\"\n}. @ubihacks thanks for adding this here too\nClosing as it seems only to be a conflict of some wrong versions. @slymnozdmrc there probably wouldn't be much of an issue adding it, but right now i'd prefer keep the code simple, and adding this functionality is not too complicated especially with the other comments with full working solutions. \nthere might also be a bigger refactor incoming with the next big release which could make it obsolete right now. \n. Close for now. Might be releavant again in the future though. @inteist yes I use the DrawerLayout from the support libraries, nothing custom. \nIf you do not have some weird handling of your drawer, and create it in the oncreate each time it is called you are fine. . well if you have many different activities this is the best approach.. @thiago-tallison could you please create a simple example (open-able in AS) to showcase the issue, would be a lot easier to resolve it. @steam0111 you want to change only the e-mail color. where?. If you want to modify it here, just copy paste that layout to your project and adjust it to your needs:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml#L91\nIf you want to change it in the item. there is a setter for the color: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L125\n. @sandeshsk what do you try to achieve? The DrawerLayout is not assigned to do this. \nIf you really want to have the elements which the MaterialDrawer offers always visible. \nPlease have a look into the EmbeddedDrawerSample\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/EmbeddedDrawerActivity.java\n(And please do not post in other unrelated questions, as it won't speed up getting an answer). @tererecool there are no plans to follow the same API as the NavigationView. . @sajadabasi there is no way to have it in RTL mode without the app being in RTL. There are also no plans to support this. you would have to basically replace all default layouts with RTL adjusted layouts . You can pass a Bitmap in using the ImageHolder\nhttps://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.mikepenz/materialdrawer/5.9.5 \nsee here for more details on the api's. @Yanis007 sorry this is not a library specific thing. Look up the ActionBarDrawerToggle inside Toolbars. @ravigupta9363 the spacing is currently defined correctly as of the Material design guidelines. \nHave you tried if the SecondaryDrawerItem fits closer your needs?\n. @bibubi that's not easily supported. it will require a little bit of \"modification\" on your side. \n1.) copy over the header xml to your project and add the views https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_header.xml\n2.) access the view of the header and find the views \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L48\n3.) everytime the profile is switched you have to manually set the new text values in the view\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L644\n. well you only have to change the layout, which is possible by copy pasting the xml to your project and adjusting it. \n. The font awesome icons are provided via: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics . Please do not post the same stuff again. I already answered here: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/2002#issuecomment-324600875. @xperiafan13-rom no this is not possible with the DrawerLayout. @utsavmadaan1995 please look at the sample application, it shows how to work with actionBar and without. Properly wrong theme. \nRemember that only the ActionBarSample uses an ActionBar everything else uses Toolbars. @BRoy98 well the sticky footer itself has no color. It only uses the item color:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerUtils.java#L362\n. as mentioned. just set the following color: material_drawer_background\neither overwrite the color itself or set the theme attribute.. @NovaViper https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html. @NovaViper please read the support library page a bit more closely ;) \nhttps://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html\n\nMake sure that the repositories section includes a maven section with the \"https://maven.google.com\" endpoint. For example:. please read the documentation very very closely. \n\n\n. so you have the google maven repository in your repositories? for all projects?. @AliKhoshraftar if your application / activity is in RTL mode they will automatically adjust. Otherwise that's not possible and you have to create CustomDrawerItems fitting your needs. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#custom-style---stylesxml. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/accountheader_single_profile_without_dropdown.md\nThanks. Close as duplicate. Is this a duplicate of: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/2016 ?. @ibado the problem is that the way the SlidingPaneLayout works, the view which is crossfaded is not gone. \nIs it possible that you make the content area on the right clickable, so it will catch the touch? It should be in the front of that non visible drawer view. @ibado did you find something related to this issue already?. Closing this now :(. \nNo more comment or progress were made in here. \nPlease let me know if you figured something. or if there is some action we can do to solve this ... . Closing this now :(. \nNo more comment or progress were made in here. \nPlease let me know if you figured something. or if there is some action we can do to solve this ... . @RaMaJ123 which version of the drawer do you use?\nwhich version of the Android Iconics?. Sadly I can not support old versions. Please use the latest and see if the issue persists. you can use the latest stable version \ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.9.5@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n}\n. and the latest iconics is:\n//the core iconcis library (without any widgets)\ncompile \"com.mikepenz:iconics-core:2.9.3@aar\". Closing this as it should be fixed with the newest versions of the libs. If not please report back. @AlexanderIgnacz that's the proper way. It can not be in front of the StatusBar \nthe way as you see it is correct. \n. @AlexanderIgnacz is you activity in fullscreen mode? \nwhich phone, which library version, which android version, what do you do?\ndoes the same happen in the sample application?. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L248. @AlexanderIgnacz you set the flag as linked by me?. yes. did you set withFullscreen true?. if withFullscreen(true) is provided in the DrawerBuilder the padding is not added here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerUtils.java#L312\n. well as you can't do the change directly in the lib. \nI would suggest you get the StickyFooter and set the padding to 0 \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L358. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L130\nwithSelectable(false). @prateek-dhanuka could you please be a bit more specific?\nso you only want to react on the MiniDrawers profile click?. @prateek-dhanuka you want to intercept the MiniDrawer's header click. \nyou might be able to achieve this by listening for the item click listener, and if the current state is == miniDrawer you do your own custom action and consume the event, otherwise you keep the default and do not consume the event\n. That simply depends on your app. \nYou can have the drawer in a BaseActivity and all your activities have it (which is not suggested)\n(and no there is no way to re-use the drawer in many activites. the drawer has to be build in each activity as the view's have to be inflated...)\nOr you have fragments and replace them on the top navigation level. \nRead the guidelines of Google to get a better understanding of a proper navigation flow for your users. @emansih because you set your fragment in front of the drawer:\ngive it a proper framelayout container somewhere in your view hierachy and don'T use android.R.id.content. @MarcelBochtler yes this is the correct behaviour. The header is also just an element in the RecyclerView so the position changes. \nWell why shouldn't you be able to rely on it? Your code decides if there is a header, so you also know which position you have to expect. @funnymobiledev that's not supported. please use the search function of github issues as this was already asked. the sample contains a custom item supporting this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/drawerItems/CustomUrlPrimaryDrawerItem.java. Just use a OnDrawerListener\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L1084\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1150\nthe custom header needs to be updated manually. as it's not under control of the drawer. \nthe update methods do only work for items.. No support here for non Java / Kotlin AS projects. remove \n.withSelectable(false). Provide the Typeface to the item: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDrawerItem.java#L203. Depends when you updated. in the very past the mText field was a String so it would just return null, now it returns the fields content. \nYou are aware that this field is also not set if you initialised the StringHolder with an string identifier?. https://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize/issues/17 . Please update to Materialize v1.1.1 (you can do this by excluding the included version and use the newer version) . Please update to Materialize v1.1.1 (you can do this by excluding the included version and use the newer version) . @codedentwickler I am not sure if you should use the MaterialDrawer library if you want to have a completely different appearance. \nPlease just sue the DrawerLayout instead (from google) \ndoesn't seem as you need anything from this library. @4Face your code does not show anything. \nThe building of the drawer will inflate the DrawerLayout to the view hierarchy. \nPlease refer to the sample apps showing usage. . https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L445. it's the default gravity field . @vasskob create your own CustomDrawerItem . @erikswed for tablet's you should usually not use the DrawerLayout but add the side-bar as part of the view hierachy. look in the sample apps. perhaps the MiniDrawer is interesting for you. or the sample which showcases how you can add the Drawer to your view hierachy. \nthe size and width is correct as of the guidelines though.. @AkshayPathak does this happen in the sample app too?. can you please show some code? \nWhich libs versions do you use? \nWhich support libs version? \nwhich build tools and so on?. Please report back. @yigitserin nothing related to this library. \npossible solutions:\n- use a smaller gif\n- use a lower res gif\n- don't use a gif. @MarcelBochtler your background color should be a ColorStateList which has a selected state. This one is like the BasePrimaryDrawerItem:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/AbstractBadgeableDrawerItem.java\nhow does your whole item look like? do you forget the super call in the bindView?\n. @oscargrgm if you provide your own header you have to make sure you handle the 24dp / 25dp of the statusbar. in addition it would be transparent, it seems you have set a solid color to it. well if you handle the header manually because you have a custom view, then you will need to add and handle the margin for it too. \nOtherwise the AccountHeader does it. well the margin can not be on the root of your header view, you can use padding if you want to have it defined on this headers root. \nthere is no method to get that . Please report back if you need more information. @stevewhite21 not possible with the ActionBar please use a Toolbar. @FajarKhan the drawer is a ui element of that specific activity, if you do launch a new activity you have to add it there again. That's why you usually should use fragments for such a navigation pattern. @Kintaro37 that's not supported by the DrawerLayout as far as I know. It's not related to this project, as the DrawerLayout is provided by google. @Kintaro37 look into the samples I already have a huge collection of different things. \nyou can have a collapsing header and a normal DrawerLayout \nif you use the MiniDrawer or the Drawer in your view hierarchy that won'T work as it is not in a scrolling container and will just cause problems.\nif you want to have only crossfading effect with a drawer then you might want to have a look on the CrossfadeDrawerLayout \nthe Crossfader would not cause the content to move to the right instead of blurring. that's only a thing fro the DrawerLayout you might find one which does this effect instead of the color overlay. @parmarravi why do you recreate everything and create a new minidrawer each time you add an item? don'T do this. you should just add the items to the drawers and then notify the MiniDrawer too about the new items. @erikswed can you reproduce this in the sample?. @MarkOSullivan94 only one item is selected at a time. . well you can hack it into but it is not prepared for this. (you need to adjust the configuration of the adapter). @MarkOSullivan94 the FastAdapter already supports multi select that's not the problem. the MaterialDrawer just do not support it, as it disables it. \n. because it is not a common pattern and might end up causing other issues. \nYou can try the configurations of the FastAdapter and it most likely will work, but it is currently not a official supported thing of the MaterialDrawer. @MarkOSullivan94 if you have further questions please report back. close for the time beeing. @MarkOSullivan94 if you have further questions please report back. close for the time beeing. the latest support libs require the latest sdk version. . if you need something else or lower support libs version you can always exclude those. @NelsonPRSousa please see the sample app it showcases this . well you add the drawer into the fragment_container which also hosts the Fragment you commit the fragment on top of it. \nthe Fragment should be added in the container view / child view of the drawer. @forcemagic plesae use the proper google repository in your project. 26.0.0 exists. there is even a 26.1.0 already available https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html. The following would work in both cases\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.9.5@aar') {\n        transitive = true\n        exclude group: 'com.android.support'\n}. closing this. as the behaviour will change with the implementation / api from the latest v3 AS and build tools. closing this. as the behaviour will change with the implementation / api from the latest v3 AS and build tools. @KhalilTB you can write your own custom drawer items. see the FAQ and the sample. @droidblogger please check out the sample application it showcases this usecase. . @NelsonPRSousa I think the MiniDrawer does not support no selection :/  I am currently super busy so I can't check. @NelsonPRSousa well this method set's the selection by the identifier. A method which set's the item per position would be needed. . because it falls back to setSelecitonAtPosition which supports it. \nSo it would be an enhancement to add this functionality :) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L571. will be in the next version. sorry for the long delay. will be in the next version. sorry for the long delay. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1151. @yoctopus https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html. Please report back if you have more issues. @NorthZuera please use the latest version of the library. The github repository shows all code, has a sample application and everything is documented. @KhalilTB that's not possible, as both lists share the same RecyclerView and it's just replaced. \nIt would require a big change to allow this, and as it is a very specific case this won't be part of this project. \nYou will have to implement this on your own.. @li3p the default one not. but you can create a CustomDraewrItem or modify the original one to allow you this. copy the original layout to your project (keep the name) and modify it to your needs:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_primary.xml#L49. @anshul90 you create a new item when you update it. just remember the item you have at position 4. modify it, and then notify the drawer about the update.\n(recreating it results in it being a new item, ... being de-selected). @fgagneten you have to create a CustomProfileDrawerItem if you don't want to hide the profile icon, passing no url will fallback to the default icon. you can chagne the placeholder icon to be transparent though. \nif you want no icon at all (this is not supported out of the box because it'snot in the material design guidelines) you want to do the above + also modify the xml of the header to hide the icon views (or you use the compact view) . @fgagneten just copy paste the xml over. you don't have to do anything else. it will be automatically replaced by the build setup. \nperhaps you want to make it 0 size, or alpha 0 or anything. I think the visiblity is updated somewhere in the code. \n. @Andoctorey is this happening in the sample application? if not there must be an issue of the way how you create the drawer.\nare you not re-creating the drawer in onCreate?. Please check if the drawer.getDrawerLayout() really contains this child view (access it via the normal way) \nThere would be no reason of butterknife not to work, other than the view not being there at this moment.. Please report back if you have more issues. \nI use butterknife in many of my projects and it does not have conflicts. @mradzinski no long is correct as the RecyclerView.Adapter expects a long id:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html#getItemId(int). If you want to improve this behaviour. You might want to open a PR. @shrpereira thank you very much. @balasaheb143 does this work in the default items?\n. you can lock the drawer. see the official documentation of the DrawerLayout for this please\nand you can remove or consume the event for the hamburger listener. \ndisabling drawerItems can be done by setting it enabled to false, and notify the drawer about this item's update. your drawerItem has an identifier defined?\nYou do the update on the UI thread?. it is working for me in the sample application. can you please provide a sample application showcasing the issue?. Please report back. Will open if further action is required. @a7b thanks. do you use proguard? any more details what you try to do?. Please add the sub dependencies of the lib manually.

(and got removed in v3) \nwith the v3 of the FastAdapter you should use the ExpandableExtension which handles it for you. \nYou can get expand using that by doing this:\njava\nresult.getExpandableExtension().expand(position);\n(the getExpandableExtension convenient method will be added in the next update, right now you can access it by doing drawer.getAdapter().getExtensions())\n. @dafdesig the latest version of the drawer requires the latest support libraries:\nv27.0.0\nolder versions will conflict\nif you want to stick to the old ones you can do this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/build.gradle#L87. @ANPez fixed in v6.0.1. which I released 5 minutes ago :D.

Keep in mind. fireing the event will result in the position being \"-1\" as a collapsed expandable does not show that item. . @FelixMittermeier if you need it before that. It's basically similar to: https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/library-extensions/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter_extensions/utilities/SubItemUtil.java#L212\nIt requires a recursive iterating over all items and all sub hierarchies, to search for the item with the given identifier select it then, and in case it's currently also shown. select it in the ui too. The functionality was added to the FastAdapter no release was made yet.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/commit/a3a4ea64cb0c33fc3d649013c2e2d8fc4520cc3a. A new FastAdapter with the util in the extensions was launched. I have to evaluate if and in case yes, how I want to integrate it in the MaterialDrawer as I don't want to include this extensions by default. Great :)\nSo the SubItemUtil is in the Extensions module of the FastAdapter \nIt provides the selectItem method which you can use to select a item or a subitem via it's identifier. \nI Looked into it, and it currently does not make really sense to directly include  it in the drawer itself.\nSo please us this util class and select tie item accordingly :) (FastAdapter v3.1.1 is required though :D). Did you add the extension to the dependencies?\nAfter that you should be able to use this util to do the selection\nOn Sat, Jan 13, 2018, 7:45 PM FelixMittermeier notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nBad news :/\nI imported the whole project into my own project, modified build.gradle to\nget latest FastAdapter release (3.1.1), but the code is still ignored.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were assigned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/2122#issuecomment-357457074,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABaGiKspMdXTsrzUGvCq5FJ-w2mTLmOzks5tKPm7gaJpZM4QqK2l\n.\n-- \nMike Penz\n\n\nMike Penz\nAndroid | Backend | Open Source | Web Developer\nmikepenz.com\nlanora.io\n.

Thank you very much. Is this reproduceable in the sample app?\n. Will be fixed in the next release. @PokerAsh well you launch a new activity. so you have to select it again in that activity. \nThe drawer only keeps the selection inside one activity. there is absolutely no way for a new drawer instance to guess what to select. @PokerAsh well usually you would use Fragments in a usecase with a Drawer that works totally fine. I use it myself in many apps. \nIf you have different activities, and a new drawer instance in each, you have to tell the drawer which item to select. the README also mentions on how to set the selection to a specific item. \n(the demo app only uses activities, because it is not showing navigation patterns, but different configurations of the drawer) . Great :). The MaterialDrawer has min API level 14. (as noted in the readme) \n2.3.3 is not supported. modern application should be API 16+ \n14+ of this library is already a huge compatiblity\nThis is the last version of this library supporting 10+:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/tree/v5.6.0\nno support from my side for old versions.... @abumoallim did you inform the drawer about the update of the item after setting withIconColorRes again?. In case you modify items at a later time. you have to follow:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer\n. In addition, you can not re-use the drawable for different tint's you have to mutate it (that's general android..). In case an item was already added to the drawer, and is modified at a later point it has to be updated (the drawer needs to be notified about the change) \nSo the tinting, is it the same Drawable for all your items, or a new different one for all?\n. so what do you mean then by dynamic icons can you somehow showcase your issue in the sample application. It seems I am not really sure about what's the real problem.. Is this reproducible in the sample application?. Is this reproducible in the sample application?. Can you please either provide a working and running application which showcases your issue, or reproduce it in the sample application of this github project. Otherwise it is impossible for me to help. @abumoallim yes that would help :). @abumoallim tinting can NOT tint remote icons. it only tints local drawables. if you want to tint icons which are loaded from web, you will have to adjust the DrawerImageLoader and tint the icon after it was loaded from web, before it is set to the view.\nThe item tinting of the icon tints the drawable not the view (as it causes issues and is not so nice supported on some android phones) \nYou might can use ImageView tinting for your usecase, but I can't for the library itself. \nI think with this new information this should be solved. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java \nyou can then adjust the logic for the loading of remote images. . https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomApplication.java \nyou can then adjust the logic for the loading of remote images. . Thanks That will be in a future update. Sadly not in the next. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/commit/32b10ab674ca87cf26ca12e7be30db3e79377a66. Thanks That will be in a future update.

Thanks :) . @thairA2Ajaber the Snackbar  or Toast is not made or handled by the Drawer. The drawer has nothing to do with it. . Remember a orientationChange will cause the activity to be recreated resulting in the drawer being recreated and all your view hierachy, that's default android. \nYou will need to show the Snackbar again in that case. New crossfader release to fix this: https://github.com/mikepenz/Crossfader/releases/tag/v1.5.2. @zoho1381 well the toolbar is unrelated to the library. but as the toolbar is in LTR. It seems you simply do not have your application in RTL mode. If the whole app is in RTL mode everything will be on the right. . If your application is in real RTL mode they are:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L12\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L45. @Antebios well the MaterialDrawer does not define which kind of information is served with the Accounts. the Accounts section is super generic, and is in general set up for profiles, but you can also use it to serve any other type of information. You simply provide a listener: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L400\nTo your AccountHeaderBuilder \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L519. @sbruno-tupaca the NavigationBar  and StatusBar is from the system, not from this drawer. \nThat's why the latest drawer does no longer set any of these flags and works with the system built in fitsSystemWindows flags. @Mygod I know. but I can not update to api as long as the gradle publishing would otherwise miss those in the pom.xml \nI will update as soon as api and implementation are supported by it. Just for completeness I was refering to: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/build.gradle#L2. Thanks for the report though. your profile does not have a identifier?. does it work if you provide an identifier?. This will be fixed in the new udpate. @afarber I think for this purpose there needs to be a specific item provided. It simply can't fit in the default items :D \nYou can implement your own CustomDrawerItems or you provide an additional layout (for the default)  items handling this case. (copy the *.xml of the default item, add it to the proper layout folder for that device, and adjust sizes to your needs :)). @afarber actionbar's are deprecated. (and they do not allow to be overdrawn, that's what you see)\nHaving the Drawer on top of a Toolbar is against the guidelines and not recommended. \nIf you still want it, there is a sample in the Sample app which showcases to have the drawer in a sub view (different location) \nPlease check the sample. \nIn general actionBar's and toolbars do not have much to do with this library, and are general Android topics. @Quacksilber the second item is a SubItem the update methods to not update sub items. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1705#issuecomment-275867012\nThis will perhaps be optimized in the future. . The null was just to reset the badge. :D removing the badge is basically the same update task as setting a new value :) \nOh sorry. the linked line moved to a new file:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/library-extensions-expandable/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/expandable/ExpandableExtension.java#L180\nGet the ExpandableExtension of the adapter and notify that a subitem changed. alternative you can also just call the notify method on the adapter for this items position (it is the same). The only way is using withOnAccountHeaderListener. @masterleclerc there will be some enhancements in the next update (via a new FastAdapter version) to expandables. Please stay tuned ;). Should be solved in the latest release v6.0.3 with the latest FastAdapter 3.2.1. @rudda what you try is create a new drawer. which is NOT supported. A drawer can only be created once in an activity (+ one appended drawer if you want one on both sides) \nYou can though adjust and update the items within. \nAll shown and mentioned in the readme and samples: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer. you can not change the layout after the drawer was created. sorry. this is not supported, and there are no plans to support that any any time.. Well removing the childs and adjusting them is possible, but there is no support for this. So if it causes issues or problems I can not support that approach.. @soenkegissel it is not common practice to have multiple activities with multiple drawers. if you have such a case you will have to handle selections on your own. no sample needed as it is no rocket sience. drawers are meant to be for navigation patterns like one activity with draewr and then fragments, or you jump somewhere which does not have a drawer. \nalso if you replace item 1 with another the usual click listener will then be notified on click for the new item. . @soenkegissel it is not common practice to have multiple activities with multiple drawers. if you have such a case you will have to handle selections on your own. no sample needed as it is no rocket sience. drawers are meant to be for navigation patterns like one activity with draewr and then fragments, or you jump somewhere which does not have a drawer. \nalso if you replace item 1 with another the usual click listener will then be notified on click for the new item. . simply use the provided methods to remove/add/change elements which are in the drawer\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer. simply use the provided methods to remove/add/change elements which are in the drawer\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#modify-items-or-the-drawer. @soenkegissel why would you need to change the listener? \nyou can simply check in the global listener which item was clicked. you get the identifier, or the position.

The MaterialDrawer itself does not define any color like this. \nAlso the DrawerLayout (by Google)  scrim is black and not the accent color. :/ \nDo you have such a color somewhere in your app? \nIs it reproducible in the sample? . @tjmille2 where you able to figure out something new?. Closing this now. Please provide further information like a sample app which allows a investigation. Closing this now. Please provide further information like a sample app which allows a investigation. @afarber it seems the freePlay item misses the identifier?. Usually you should always set an identifier. but the lib will assign automatically one too. In the next update there will be some fixes related to this. (FastAdatper 3.x changed auto defined ids to be < -1, which resulted in issues it seems). @xamo1998 if you want to change the look you can implement your own custom drawerITem. see the FAQ for details. \nThe color of the divider can be defined via: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#custom-style---stylesxml. @afarber please remove the withSelectedItem(-1) if you don't have any items. Thanks. Will need to investigate.

Either you have your app in RTL mode as default by the system.

Thank you very much. There is an event allowing you to check if the user clicks on the toggle:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L420\nYou can also check for it's state here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L110. @grote that sounds really strange. why would a simple preference read be so slow on that phone. \nI would be super happy about a PR to enhance this. For example it could be that the preferences are only read in if the 2 features are activated. \nIn addition perhaps it should not use the default preferences (as they might be super big based on the app). But this might be handled as you mentioned, by allowing to pass in the preferences. . 6.0.7-SNAPSHOT @grote created a snapshot release which will not load the preferences if the 2 features which need them are disabled:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/f6d181e08ff49603a35f25b90f57ac3d8fd7d392\ncan you please test if it makes a difference?. you need to use the SNAPSHOT maven central repo. It's just so we can make sure not loading the shared preferences speeds it up. (you have to disable those 2 functionalities though). https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/build.gradle#L31. @EfremovAV ok in your case it most likely was the logo :D. @grote the commit only solves it if you disable these features, I'd love to check if it solves it before allowing to pass in the shared preferences or have an alternative. \nHad you time to run it once?\n@EfremovAV perhaps the phone was just low on memory or so. there are many factors which could lead to some strange behaviour. Added the option to pass in the shared preferences. released in v6.0.7 \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/4d7b0d41621e42a2b68506ec1b48d2c1bbb2ce56. Added the option to pass in the shared preferences. released in v6.0.7 \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/commit/4d7b0d41621e42a2b68506ec1b48d2c1bbb2ce56. @bsjoker does not really seem to be related to the MaterialDrawer, looks like a general coding question. \nAs if you have the reference to the drawer (which you haven't in the item) then you can call the delete method accordingly. \nYou might also wanna do a quick look in the FastAdapter documentation and sample app as it has helpers to attach a click listener to a view inside an item (without doing this inside the item, which is bad). Close until further details are provided. @EfremovAV can you please elaborate more? Is this related to the linked issue?. Closing this one, as it is most likely a duplicate of #2238. @Philipp97714 well this is open source. allowing you to improve. all source code is available. everything visible. if the sample is not meeting your standards you can always check out the in source code itself. \nI am more than glad if there are PRs to improve javadoc in different areas. \nAs of this code. the DrawerImageLoader just needs to be initialized once before the drawer is used. \nand Glide.clear is specific to glide, not to this library. it should be called if a view is no longer bound and the request should no longer be executed for this view\n. The sample uses glide v3. I think there were already some github issues in the past posting glide v4 sample code. You should be able to find it here in the issue section by searching. Close. Please report back if you have an update.. @Philipp97714 this sample app still uses glide v3. I see no need to update it as glide v3 works great for the sample. \nThe DrawerImageLoader is written in such a generic way so any image loader can be used. \nYou might want to open a PR to add sample code for glide v4 though.\n. Close. Please report back if you have an update.. @Philipp97714 I think this is just a result out of the way a snackbar works. the snackbar is inflated in the view hierarchy. so is the DrawerLayout if you add the DrawerLayout while the snackbar is shown the view hierarchy moves around and will move up. \nThis is somehow acceptable behaviour as this is how the Snackbar functions. Close. Please report back if you have an update.. @parmarravi I think you mix it up with the withSwitchEnabled() call. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/AbstractSwitchableDrawerItem.java\nwithSelectable() will only disable the selection of the item. . @OnlyInAmerica if not really needed (the MaterialDrawer itself does no longer need it) I strongly vote against using this helper, as it might break in fancy ways. \nI am most likely going to remove it from the code soon. \nAs for the stability commit, it's many many many months back, but as far as I remember I had some issues on some phones where it had false results and broke the behaviour. . Added warning to the class that it gets deleted soon. thank you very much for the PR :)\nIf you need it just get it into your projects code. The click listener gives you the child, and the child extends ISubItem which should have a getParent() method. This gives you the parent item. \nThere is now view of the parent accessible, as it is not guaranteed that the parent view is currently bound. If the clicked item has a parent (so is an expandable child) then it should not be null.\nAlso I do not really understand what you do with the new ISubItem() implementation here?. Please completely fill out the required details. Please open a proper issue, and follow the template. You need both:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/MultiDrawerActivity.java#L169. @DesigningKnights I don't think this is related to this library. Managing and handling the information to your profiles is up to the developer. The MaterialDrawer simply provides the plain ui without any further logic assigned. \nIf you want to adjust the Headers background. you can do this via it's ImageView\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L65. @Nishikant-07 then you should not use a DrawerLayout. Look at the Embedded Drawer sample showcasing how to embed the drawer layout view anywhere you like. If you have a dimens.xml file with these values changed it should definitely result in a difference of the item, as these values are used. \nAlternatively you can overwrite the layout itself too (copy it to your project, and modify it to your needs) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer_item_profile.xml. https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L101 \n(after opening the drawer)\nPlease always fill out the pre defined issue template. @eggysudianto I am confused. you create a drawer, and then you provide the logic how to load iamges, and then your create the header, but do not provide it to the drawer?\nIn addition which images is not loaded from url? \nAlso please use the pre defined issue template. . @mytms yes there is. \nSee the sample it has many normal items, and some as expandable:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L122. @mytms yes there is. \nSee the sample it has many normal items, and some as expandable:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L122. @yatindeokar removeItem can only remove an element if it's visible.

You can check out this FastAdapter sample having multiple nested levels: https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fastadapter/app/ExpandableSampleActivity.java. @hamzabinamin the FastAdapter is a adapter simplification implemented by me to streamline usage of it and eliminate boilerplate adapter code... \nYou write an item, and that one can instantly be used in a RecyclerView. \nRecyclerView and their default adapter has no \"logic\" for collapsable items. This is just provided via the FastAdapter by me. \nThe MaterialDrawer uses the FastAdapter internally to allow me providing a super flexible easily enhanceable API.\nItems can be written and provided to the adapter / drawer without any changes in the main code. most likely still an issue with androidX.

Will be in the next release. * if you change elements a recreation of the items in the MiniDrawer is most likely necessary: MiniDrawer.createItems()\nAlternatively you can try to call miniDrawer.getAdapter().notifyAdapterDataSetChanged();. @akhbulatov is thebindView` called again?

Simply re-open if relevant. hmmm can you try to notify the adapter about changes. will it adjust? \n. hmmm do you have a header? is the position off by 1 if you try to notify the single change?. Thanks again for this PR. @or-dvir not really sure the DrawerLayout which gets inflated is MATCH_PARENT, MATCH_PARENT so it should be absolutely fine. you are consuming the click event. \nReturn false if you do not want to consume the event, and want to allow the drawer to do what it is supposed to do: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/DrawerActivity.java#L194. You are welcome. @atul-forbinary please look in the sample activity it showcases this usage. \nalso no support if the issue template is not filled out correctly. @mostafazaghlol if the default items do not work as you want them, you can implement your own customer drawer items as mentioned in the FAQ :). does the same crash happen with the sample app?\nIt seems to crash during binding an item. could it be you use a drawable which is not available on an old android version?. @sajjadjaved01 if you do not use androidX yet please use a version lower than 6.1.0.. @dafi you are absolutely right it won't reach that part. Gonna add it in the next release. @dafi thank you very much you are right. Totally overlooked that. :(\nI have added now the possibility to provide a ColorStateList to the BadgeStyle. @afarber as the Drawer is nothing else than a RecyclerView with elements (thus the items are based on the same approach like the items your create for the FastAdapter (theoretically fastAdapter items can be used by additionally implementing the IDrawerItem interface, and drawer items simply in any list)) \nSo that means whenever you adjust fields of an element, you will need to notify the adapter about the update to the item ;)\nThe MaterialDrawer comes with convenient functions like: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L654\nBut you can also go to the roots of the adapter. Get the adapter: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L654 and then update the item as you know it from the fastAdapter ;)\nAlso the same rules like in the FastAdapter applies. You can use a payload (if you update via the adapter) to optimize adjustments. you don't seem to provide items. without any additional configuration you just get the drawer inflated.\nAdd items and stuff :). you don't seem to provide items. without any additional configuration you just get the drawer inflated.\nAdd items and stuff :). @bios90 it allows you to provide a custom implementation of a DrawerLayout nothing else, it does not allow you to add any ui parts. \nIf you want a drawer with your own views, you do not need this library. . You are welcome. That has nothing to do with this library. TheMaterialDrawer does not manage the toolbar, it only allows to manage the ActionBarDrawerToggle for you. Which you can disable if you don't pass the toolbar over. Close as unrelated to the library. \nPlease check you have the components styled correctly disabled backgrounds and stuff. :). the latest version of this lib requires androidX as stated in the changelog, in the migration guide, and in the readme :)\nYou need proper androidX setup to use it, alternative use one of the older versions with appcompat libraries. @Demonic217 what do you mean with rotating to the side? do you have screenshots or samples?. @Demonic217 oh the 90\u00b0 rotation? well this is not related to this library. The BezelImageView used in here will only apply a mask to round the image. \nThe rotation itself most likely comes from the image loading library, or it might even come theoretically from the embedded EXIF information telling it to be rotated by 90\u00b0 (exif has some orientation logic :D) \nYou might anyways want to crop it to 1:1 (which most likely ignores / or respects the exif information) to full fill the circle. (or if you do not want to crop, you will need to ensure the rotation is not applied and then modify the scale type to fill the circle) . As far as I see you take the picture with the camera. Depending on your camera implementation the camera will add information about the camera and the orientation to the image. \na very important thing to know is, that the camera's on Android devices are (usually) 90\u00b0 rotated build in. (so like your picture shows) \n(side note. some devices like the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P have the camera built in 270\u00b0 rotated)\nThus the exif information will contain the information that the image is 90\u00b0 rotated, and if you look at it in a file browser or on a computer this information is used to correctly rotate the image for you.\nSo I assume the code you used to crop to 1:1 respected the 90\u00b0 info from the exif and resulted in the proper display. the ImageView alone does not do this for you as far as I know.\nThis stackoverflow article might help you :)\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/14066038/why-does-an-image-captured-using-camera-intent-gets-rotated-on-some-devices-on-a\nYou are welcome. See here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ/howto_modify_add_custom_draweritems.md\nAlso the sample app has some custom drawer items :). You will need to implement your own CustomProfileDrawerItem you should be able to use this one as your base: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/ProfileDrawerItem.java#L115\nJust add the possibility to not show the e-mail. Similar to the default items possibility of only showing the e-mail and not the name. \nAlso the FAQ mentions how to create custom items. In your case it's a custom ProfileDrawerItem \n(You could also simply extend the above and hide that view for example :D). No the MaterialDrawer will automatically inflate the DrawerLayout into the xml root for you :) \nCheckout the sample app it shows a few different usecases. \nRegards. @emami7495 you can use his library and use his implementation of the DrawerLayout instead of the default DrawerLayout from google. . Just create an xml like this: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/layout/material_drawer.xml\nbut instead using the drawerlayout from that person. \npass it in using:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L325\nand it should be good. Which version of the library do you use?. It was fixed in this PR: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/pull/2293\nWhich was introduced in this version:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/releases/tag/v6.0.8. at which point do you call navContent?. Your drawerItems are .withSelectable(false). so they can't be selected\n. Well it seems you use the support libraries still. \nPlease see the info under the first step:\nTo use appcompat please use a version smaller than 6.1.0. (See the releases on GitHub). This new release uses androidX, thus your project should use androidX :). Awesome :). \n. What's the android version you run this on? \nThe class missing comes from the android system. and is not included in the library . Also do you re-style the drawerItem in any way? applying a different background or such?. Can you run the sample app on your phone please. \nIt might be due to the upgrade to androidX that android 4.4. support broke. Do you see the same in the sample app?. Please report back. Close until then. @MFlisar I use the bridge theme to have as much compatibility as possible. \nYou do not have to use the provided themes. You can use any theme you prefer and just apply the required fields: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#custom-style---stylesxml. I assume then something in your app does not correctly recreate the UI for this case. . You need to fill the drawer with the items again. the saved instance only stores the selection. \nthe problem is that the items can be anything, dynamically, bitmaps, ... so it is hard to find a general serialization solution to tackle all people's needs. Well when the activity gets destroyed you have to make sure that it's views are built up again correctly during creation. and also you need to provide the items to the drawer which should be displayed. \nThe data in the drawer is added by you dynamically and as the items could be anything it is in your responsibility to correctly fill up the drawer again. . Good point. . The color is retrieved here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/32297f89de3882a0f53365e98f4a5ee56adcf0c5/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/model/BaseDrawerItem.java#L275\nand you can set the color in the theme:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/res/values/styles.xml#L39. @sorous please look at the sample app it also has such a sample.\nThe grey bar comes from the inset which would be needed for the drawer if it was normally implemented in fullscreen.. use a ActionBar theme:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/32297f89de3882a0f53365e98f4a5ee56adcf0c5/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L34\nAnd configure the drawer as shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/ActionBarActivity.java#L22\nIf you use a ActionBar \nIf you just want to have the drawer in a different hiarachry level with a toolbar. Then see here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/app/CustomContainerActivity.java\n. @Dosssik thanks but neither should be necessary as the DrawerLayout already handles the insets correctly. Did you ensure you have the proper theme set? . Closing this. Please report back. I believe this should not be necessary. You can use this here to set a click listener for the selection list area:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L534. @tobybonhof display them in a ImageView somewhere and check how they look there? \nI assume something with the conversion caused issues? . Hmm why not directly use vector drawables? they would always scale perfectly and are a lot smaller? \nThe ImageView for the PrimaryDrawerItem has an effective size for the icon itself of 24x24dp\nwidth = 56dp, paddingRight = 32dp\nheight = 48dp, paddingTop = 12dp, paddingBottom =12dp\nno scaletype set. That should be perfectly fine. as you can see above the imageView has also the 24dp area for the icon. . \non my phone your icon renders without issues. (just added it as XML and used it via .withIcon(R.drawable.ico_test)). Still curious what might cause it. \nCan you try if you can somehow reproduce it in the sample app of this repo? Or create a sample app to showcase the issue, I might be able to have a look too. \nAlso not pixelated using your sample :/. @tobybonhof were you able to figure something out? I still couldn't reproduce it on the phones I have available :/. Could it be the phone? The emulator? Do you have other devices to test this with? \n. @tobybonhof yeah that is my assumption that it uses bitmaps instead of the actual vector. but even in that case it should not result in such a bad pixelated effect. blurry without sharp edges sure, but the way it looks in the screenshot is just weird. \nStill hoping somehow that we can find the root of this problem, as I am super curious :D\nOh awesome! :). Just open a PR and add it at the end of the list with apps using the drawer ;). @tobybonhof yeah that is my assumption that it uses bitmaps instead of the actual vector. but even in that case it should not result in such a bad pixelated effect. blurry without sharp edges sure, but the way it looks in the screenshot is just weird. \nStill hoping somehow that we can find the root of this problem, as I am super curious :D\nOh awesome! :).

Closing this now as it seems it is not happening for anybody else,  nor reproducible for me. \nIf we get some more information or can find a way to reproduce let's reopen then.. could it be that you still have support lib dependencies somewhere? \nalso the part you add to the build script is not required from the materialDrawer, just add the dependency with the version. if you want to move definitions into a different gradle file that's up to you. . Well you have to replace the version placeholder with the version you want to use. but it is not required to move it to a general place. You can always check on maven central which are the latest released binaries :) \nhttps://search.maven.org/artifact/com.mikepenz/materialdrawer/6.1.1/aar\nPlease note that everything newer than 6.1.x uses androidx ;)\n. @sonhvp sorry for the late answer. \nI am not sure how this could be an issue of the library :/. \nThe library uses normal layouts, and accesses the views of the layout via their identifier. as it is supposed to be. \ncould it be some issue with the setup of the instant app? is the drawer not in the right module, and not shipped? \nor your item being in the wrong module missing the layout? or such?. @sonhvp so I believe I figured out what is going on here. \nSo the id's of the materialDrawer are in the com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R class. Wheras your id's are in the com.sonhvp.test class. So when you then use your own xml file, the id's are in your namespace, but the BaseViewHolder tries to find the ids in the materialdrawer namespace. As such it will not be able to find the views and they stay null. \nTo solve the problem just add:\njava\n        init {\n            this.icon = view.findViewById(R.id.material_drawer_icon)\n            this.name = view.findViewById(R.id.material_drawer_name)\n            this.description = view.findViewById(R.id.material_drawer_description)\n        }\nto your ViewHolder in the OverflowMenuDrawerItem (ensure it is the R of your package)\n\nIf I am not wrong it works for the app because the R fields for identifiers are there still merged, and same identifiers are just merged and will be the same id. Whereas for instantapps this does not happen.  (at least this is my assumption) \nIn addition I believe google's plan is to have the same for normal modules at some point in the future too. basically namespacing all identifiers and layouts and prevent them being overwritten from a different module. . @roip890 the error shows that you do not have the androidx RecyclerView in your project. \nPlease ensure you have the required modules in your gradle:\n```\nimplementation \"com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:6.1.1\"\n//required support lib modules\nimplementation \"androidx.appcompat:appcompat:${versions.androidX}\"\nimplementation \"androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:${versions.androidX}\"\nimplementation \"androidx.annotation:annotation:${versions.androidX}\"\nimplementation \"com.google.android.material:material:${versions.androidX}\"\nimplementation \"androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:${versions.constraintLayout}\"\n``. The best and proper way is to have theDrawerLayoutin theActivityand then have 2 sliders. \nWhich you currently do. It is definitely the better approach as theDrawerLayoutis meant that way, you won't have issues withfitsSystemWindows` and wrong insets, and the view hierarchy is kept flatter, in addition there is less risk of issues due to the edge swiping to show the drawerlayouts. \nIt should be possible to have a DrawerLayout in the activity as you already do, and then have a second DrawerLayout with its independent Drawer inside the fragment (see how to show a DrawerLayout in a fragment in the sample. But I highly recommend against doing that.. @afarber by \"slider\" I mean the thing you pull out from the side in a DrawerLayout \nThe DrawerLayout is just the wrapping ViewGroup providing the functionality to have the main view and sliders top, right, bottom, left (which are normally hidden and can be pulled out via a swipe) \nIn your screenshot the slider would be the thing with the profile, and then the items (the drawer content).

Will be in one of the upcoming v7 updates ;). Will be in one of the upcoming v7 updates ;). @itzThiefz-exe that seems to happen if multiple dependencies/modules with kotlin are in an app.\nYou can add:\npackagingOptions {\n    exclude 'META-INF/library_release.kotlin_module'\n}\nto the build.gradle. the same error are you sure? did you also add it to the right build.gradle in the correct module?. and the exact same log appeared or was it a different file? (there might be various of those kotlin files which need to be excluded). @RimonGazi what do you mean? you want to return to the normal list?. You will need to listen for account changes and then update the list. \nThe list can be updated simply by using the Drawer object you retrieve after building the drawer, it provides remove, add, .. methods. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/Drawer.java#L718-L827\nAnd to detect profile switches add a listener:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeaderBuilder.java#L643-L652\nThe interface of this listener.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L377-L386\n. the MaterialDrawer's content is basically a RecyclerView with items in it. you can hold of the RecyclerView and get a reference to the Adapters . \nYou should be in full control and can implement anything you want. \nthis is not a feature which the MaterialDrawer directly offers, but you should be able to achieve it with the exposed getters to retrieve the classes. \nYou might also look into the samples of the FastAdapter which offers drag and drop samples. as it is not an official feature and not planned I can only refer to the official APIs of the RecyclerView which can be used. \nThe MaterialDrawer offers a getter for the RecylerView the Adapter and everything so it should be based on the available APIs possible. . The header uses the following to load images:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\n(this was introduced to have a generic way of allowing any image loader you may use). You are calling the \"update\" method to notify about updated elements in the header?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L244. That sounds like these could actually be something related to v7 :) \nthank you so much for helping to figure this out ;). @rmayayo can you please provide some sample to reproduce this issue? (based on the sample app?). @davcpas1234 thank you very much for this great investigation. \nI'll give it a look and hopefully have it fixed / included in one of the next releases. this will be in the upcoming v7 upgrade of the MaterialDrawer. thanks again for the report.

The problem if I don't pass the toolbar to the drawer (as in the nontranslucentStatusDrawerExample) the toogle button always goes back on click even if you doesn't setDisplayHomeUpAsEnabled. To reproduce just, comment in your nontranslucentStatusDrawerExample the lines 61 and 62\nJava\n//getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);\n//getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(false);\nThen the activity shows the hamburger icon, but when you click on it, it goes back instead of showing the drawer (that can be showed by sliding from the left).\nI know that I can just use my own toggle and reproduce the behavior to open / close the drawer, and checking if I want to show the back button and handle the onBack, but that would put \"drawer code\" outside the drawer module, so it would be better if the drawer itself could handle it.\nAs I said on the previous post, the problem is that in the moment you subscribe the setNavigationOnClickListener it overrides all the functionality even if the toggledrawer is not enabled!\nFrom my pov the cleanest and more \"encapsulated\" one solution is that the drawer itself could know that the toggle is not enabled and in that case \"resume\" normal behavior. That could be accomplish with the if I wrote before, but what I'm missing now is the way to \"resume\" normal behavior in that case.\n. @mikepenz I already have seen your examples.

What I really like of your library approach, is that you comply one of the best practices rules: \"Makes normal behaviors easy, and not-normal feasible\" (sorry for my english).\nSo, from my pov (please tell me if I'm wrong)  a \"normal expected\" behavior of the ToggleDrawer would be that if the hamburger icon is showed, a click on the icon would \"open / close\" the drawer, and if it is showing the back button, a click would call \"back\" (whatever the developer decides to mean \"back\")\nSo, if the MaterialDrawer allows just by configuring it (and not overriding anything) to show an hamburger icon that is not opening / closing the drawer, or a back icon that is not going back, that is confusing for me. That is why I thought about the possibility of \"check if the\" drawertoggle is enabled.\nMaybe the only solution is just to define two drawers for the same activity and change the \"active one\" depending on the Fragment showed (ie, programmatically) so one Fragment would show the drawer with the hamburger icon that shows the drawer, and other shows just the back button. In this case, this should be done by the developer and not the MaterialDrawer, but it still feels a little patchy for me :(\nAbout setting the listener on the toggle, I already test it, and it doesn't work, even worse, as the one defined on the drawer stopped to work.\nWhat I suggested is to add the previous code inside your drawer code, but I still need to find the way to \"resume\" the normal behavior. Maybe throwing a new event with the \"onclick\" and the home item would solve the problem.

Maybe throwing a new event with the \"onclick\" and the home item would solve the problem. What do you think?\n. @mikepenz Thank you for the follow up.\nRegarding not showing the back arrow, if that is right, Google itself is not complying with that rule. For example in the Gmail app: When you open the app the hamburger and drawer are shown, if you select a mail, it navigates to the \"mail thread\" and the back arrow is shown.\nI know I can reproduce that behavior by using different activities one with the drawer and the other without it but my problem is that I'm trying to use the same activity to go through a same \"flow\" and just change the fragments inside. That means to be able to activate / deactivate the drawer that is already defined on the activity.\nI don't think that my use case is very \"strange\" or not common, I can see it on a lot of applications that shows the drawer on a first \"screen\" and anytime you navigate to a \"detail screen\" the back arrow is shown.\nRegarding the Material Drawer implementation, one of my concerns is that I can set it to a way where I'm showing the hamburger and the drawer is not being opened, or also I can see the back button and it opens the drawer instead of going back (or hitting onOptionsItem...) You are right that probably the problem is on the toggledrawer implementation by google, as even when you have disabled the \"togglebutton\" the click on it launches the navigationlistener!  That is the real problem or \"bug\" here.\n. @mikepenz Maybe I have found a solution, using a Interface that gives the posibility to the activity to handle the navigation. I'm going to make a pull request for you to review it.\n. @mikepenz Hello again, I've taken a look to the change you made and I think there is needed a change. The idea is to allow the activity handle the navigation in case the toggledrawer is not enabled, as in that case. However, in case the toggledrawer is enabled I would fall on the behavior that you already had implemented (subscribe the navigationlistener to open / close the drawer).\nSo instead of:\nJava\nif ((mActionBarDrawerToggle != null && !mActionBarDrawerToggle.isDrawerIndicatorEnabled()) || mOnDrawerNavigationListener != null)\nI would rather use this:\nJava\nif (mOnDrawerNavigationListener != null && (mActionBarDrawerToggle != null && !mActionBarDrawerToggle.isDrawerIndicatorEnabled())\n(Note the change of the || to the &&)  This way, the activity doesn't need to manage the logic of the navigation on the cases he doesn't care and are already managed by the drawer. With that change one could relay on the normal behavior, and if the activity sets the toggledrawer to not enabled at any moment (when showing Fragment B for example) then and only then the activity would handle the \"navigation\"\n. @mikepenz \nIt is just a matter of how much of the implementation is let to the drawer and how much is on the dev side.\nWith your implementation in my use case (Activity with drawer that is shown on Fragment A and back on Fragment B) I need to register the listener using the callback we have just defined and ask for the toggle status:\nJava\n .withOnDrawerNavigationListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerNavigationListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public boolean onNavigationClickListener(View view) {\n                        if (!result.getActionBarDrawerToggle.isDrawerIndicatorEnabled())\n                        {\n                           onBackPressed();\n                           return true;\n                        }\n                       else\n                           return false;\n                  }                    \n                })\nSo the Activity needs to know if the drawerToggle is enabled, and decide what to do. With the change I've proposed it is just:\nJava\n                .withOnDrawerNavigationListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerNavigationListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public boolean onNavigationClickListener(View view) {\n                        onBackPressed();\n                        return false;\n                    }\n                })\nBut you are right that in this case, the activity has less control about the navigation, but maybe is the right thing as that is \"handled\" by the drawer.\nI don't know both approach are similar but with slightly differences.\nRegarding your current implementation, I would not remove the code, it is very helpful to have all encapsulated, and with your \"callbacks\" system, the developer could override almost all behaviors if he want to.\n. @mikepenz  Sorry for reopen this issue, but with the last changes you have made, you had changed the way the actionBarDrawerToggle is created in case a toolbar is given. You are using the constructor with the toolbar:\nJava\nactionBarDrawerToggle(mActivity, mDrawerLayout, mToolbar, R.string.drawer_open, R.string.drawer_close)\nThis is a regression from https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/pull/66\nIf the toolbar is used that way, the navigation listeners stop working and the back button doesn't do anything.\n. @mikepenz I think there is something wrong somewhere. I'm reviewing the official doc:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/ActionBarDrawerToggle.html#ActionBarDrawerToggle(android.app.Activity, android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout, android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar, int, int)\nand they are suggesting the same:\n\"Please use ActionBarDrawerToggle(Activity, DrawerLayout, int, int) if you are setting the Toolbar as the ActionBar of your activity.\"\nThis is consistent with the behavior I have found, if you use the toolbar on the constructor the navigationlistener stop working and the backbutton doesn't do anything.\nWould you mind point me to the documentation where the need to set the toolbar is said?\n. @mikepenz I guess that the problem only raises on pre lollipop devices isn't it? Because on my nexus 5 when the toggle is registered without the toolbar the drawer icon is showed without any problem.\nAgain this is a problem as now the backbutton doesn't work anymore( at least on lollipop devices) and the navigationlistener that is registered inside the drawer is also not being called.\n. @mikepenz Thank you for the last changes. I was able to make it work.\nJust to document. If you have defined the drawer with a toolbar, the hambuger icon is shown (and the the drawer opens). \nIn order to show the backbutton the following must be done:\n``` Java\nresult.getActionBarDrawerToggle().setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(false);\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(true);\n```\nIMPORTANT: the order of the previous lines matters. If you disable the drawer after setting the displayhome, it doesn't show\nTo recover the hambuger the oposite must be done:\nJava\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(false);\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(false);\nresult.getActionBarDrawerToggle().setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(true);\n(Again the order matters)\nThank you for your awesome work and patience \n.

I guess that you are refering to an \"material drawer\" update, aren't you?\nIt seems also that there were a bug on the v22 that google solved on the 22.1.1\n. @mikepenz Take a look here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=169760\n. @mikepenz Take a look here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=169760\n. v2.9.0 solved the issue, amazing work as always @mikepenz \n. v2.9.0 solved the issue, amazing work as always @mikepenz \n. That would be awesome!\nFrom my pow, the material design library tries to enforce that approach (to have the toolbar view on the fragments / views) but it also implies not having a God activity that contains all the \"common\" views that the fragment \"would use\", of course it is more efficient, but it also means refactor the entire application visualization logic.\nIn the mean time, I'm \"duplicating\" the creation of the actionbartoogle with this method:\njava\n ActionBarDrawerToggle mActionBarDrawerToggle;\n    public void createActionBarDrawerToggle(Toolbar toolbar) {\n        mActionBarDrawerToggle = new ActionBarDrawerToggle(mActivity, mDrawer.getDrawerLayout(), toolbar, R.string.drawer_open, R.string.drawer_close);\n        mDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerListener(mActionBarDrawerToggle);\n        mActionBarDrawerToggle.syncState();\n    }\nAnd, even if the hamburguer icon is shown and opens the drawer in order to make it work I can't use\njava\nsetSupportActionBar(toolbar);\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);\ngetSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(false);\non the activity\nNow I'm trying to change the hamburguer to an arrow by demand (some fragments shall show the arrow instead of the hamburguer)\n. I'm already using the 4.0.0 but rc1 as the Google icons stopped working, and as I'm involved on the refactor I didn't want to ask before I had more time to be sure that it wasn't my fault.\nI hope that tomorrow I can update to rc7 and let you know if anything is missing. Thanks for the tip on the complexheaderActivity, I will take a look asap :)\nAgain, amazing. Thank you for the support\n. @mikepenz About the iconics, I figure out that had to be something like that :) thank you, I'm upgrading to rc7 now.\nRegarding the Hamburguer and arrow, the code show on the ComplexHeaderActivity is the one to be used one the drawer and the toolbar are both on the activity, so you can use the setSupportActionBar(toolbar) once and pass the same toolbar instance to the drawer and then your can manipulate the icon (if you remember, we were searching for the solution together).\nMy problem now is that each fragment provides its own toolbar, so when the activity switch fragments from a container using the fragmentmanager, the \"toolbar\" used by the activity must change.\nIf I \"setSupportActionBar(toolbar)\" each time I change the fragment my problem is that the toolbar that is associated with the drawer and provided on the \"withToolbar(toolbar)\" has changed, so the drawer doesn't holds the right instance of the toolbar, and it doesn't work.\nIf I just not pass the toolbar, then I need to create my own ActionBarDrawerToggle for each toolbar (or anytime a fragment is changed) and link it manually to the underlying drawer wrapped to the materialdrawer. Also I have to provide the icon for the arrow. This link includes the  listeners, this is the code that I use:\nJava\n   mActionBarDrawerToggle = new ActionBarDrawerToggle(mActivity, mDrawer.getDrawerLayout(), toolbar, R.string.drawer_open, R.string.drawer_close);\n        mDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerListener(mActionBarDrawerToggle);\n        mActionBarDrawerToggle.syncState();\n        mActionBarDrawerToggle.setHomeAsUpIndicator(new IconicsDrawable(mActivity, GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_arrow_back).sizeDp(16).color(Color.WHITE));\n        mActionBarDrawerToggle.setToolbarNavigationClickListener(v -> mActivity.onBackPressed());\nAnd I have to manually activate / deactivate the hamburguer / arrow with:\nJava\n mActionBarDrawerToggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(true);\nI don't know if there is a better approach for the problem\n. @percula \nAt the end I'm just creating a toolbar in each fragment and on each inflate I manage the actionbar home button.\nAs I'm using now kotlin + MVVM + SimpleStack, using some base clases and interface default implementations to show arrow / hamburguer ended being just a flag on the screen for the simplestack.. @percula \nAt the end I'm just creating a toolbar in each fragment and on each inflate I manage the actionbar home button.\nAs I'm using now kotlin + MVVM + SimpleStack, using some base clases and interface default implementations to show arrow / hamburguer ended being just a flag on the screen for the simplestack..

I'm trying to do the same thing. getLayoutRes() should be my custom XML layout located in my layout package directory?\nWhat about getType()? What exactly is this?\nI have left getType() to the default: \njava\n@Override\npublic int getType() {\n    return com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.id.material_drawer_item_secondary;\n}\nAnd even that I put my custom layout, it forces the default one.\nIs there any simple example of really simple custom item?

I will look into it and submit new issue if necessary.\n. yes i want to update the  list of items dispalyed in the AccountHeader selection\n. sorry for the trouble but the problem was that \nThis is where we add account section profile but i was not updating profileDrawerItems.\nmDrawer.switchDrawerContent(mySecondaryOnDrawerItemClickListener, null, profileDrawerItems, 0);\nHow ever it will be very helpful if you share any piece of code you have in which drawer item or account section items update within the application? e.g. some menu are visible in login mode but not in logged out mode. \n. Please close the issue @mikepenz  as the problem is solved for now.\n. @NirujanSuresh  please update your project level build file\n``` gradle\n// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.0'\n        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'\n        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong\n        // in the individual module build.gradle files\n    }\n}\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        mavenCentral()\n        maven { url \"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\" }\n    }\n}\ntask clean(type: Delete) {\n    delete rootProject.buildDir\n}\n```\n. sorry i have done this mistake \n@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin\n@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin\nseems like android studio don't fix transitive errors\n. Yeah, but from that alone I thought that indentifier was auto assigned somehow (by item order), since it is not in the examples. All I'm saying is that it would be a lot easier to simply add something like this to example in README.md:\nadd .withIdentifier(6), so it becomes:\n```\n//modify an item of the drawer\nitem1.withIdentifier(6).(\"A new name for this drawerItem\").withBadge(\"19\").withBadgeStyle(new BadgeStyle().withTextColor(Color.WHITE).withColorRes(R.color.md_red_700));\n//notify the drawer about the updated element. it will take care about everything else\nresult.updateItem(item1);\n//to update only the name, badge, icon you can also use one of the quick methods\nresult.updateName(6, \"A new name\");\n```\nThis example becomes very obvious that the identifier is manually set and it can save some research time for other people.\nI know this is not necessary, but it makes it a lot easier to understand. :)\n. Also I think that link you provided is not in README.md. That would also be convenient. Thanks!\n. Oh sorry, i did not saw you reply an answer. \nYeah I am German. \nIt was a little tricky because I linked two layouts. So I have to change fitsSystemWindows in both to get a fluency surface. \nYour answer helps me very well. Thank you so much.\n. I tried without notify and it doesn't update the header account.\nWhen I execute the below code with \"profile\" having the correct updated name + email info, I get one profile back in the list, and the name and email are not updated.\nheaderResult.updateProfile(profile);\nList<IProfile> ip = headerResult.getProfiles();\n. I just added an identifier and it worked. Thanks a lot.\n. I will change it dynamically because I get the backgroundColor from my API.\n. Yes.. i just saw it before. \nI thought there will be an easier way :). Thank you Mike. \n. It is just for the design. \nWithout the display below status bar the menuitems are too near to the toolbar and with the display it is too far away.\nI thought you can change it if you like. \n. Thank you @mikepenz \n. ",

Hey @mikepenz, with the second preview everything seems ok right now :D \nbut I've some remarks : \n- When you change the header height, the account list selector should stick in the bottom of the header which is not the case in your implementation right now.\n- for the header background, I think it will be good to let the dev to choose the scale type. for example In my case I use square image from instagram, so fit-xy it wouldn't be nice. for that it's better for me to use fit only on x and crop center on y.\n- I think also you need to add some shadow for circular profile picture to follow material design guide, it's ok with simple background but with other it's better to show some depth (z)\n- It would be nice to add a changelog so others  can follow easily the changes.\nthanks :)\n. @mikepenz  now there is some bugs but let me explain what I meant in my last comment with a screenshot:\n\nas you can see, the header's content stay on the top of the layout when someone change header's height.

Meaning that if the user pressed the log in button we could call our own RESTful service and then return for example a new profile with the relevant data that would then be added to the drawer. It would also be nice to have a small log in reminder on the header if no profiles are added. For example simply 'Log in' as the profile name and if you click on it the profile part opens with the log in button. Basically like the profile section in Reddit News' drawer.\n. @mikepenz I see what you're getting it, it wouldn't make sense with only one profile, but it can still be opened with only one profile. So that should probably also be disabled then to make it consistent with the lack of the arrow. \nGmail is an example yes. Although a specific 'manage account' option probably wouldn't be needed. Basically you could for example (1) add a 'log out' button in the profile list for the current account or (2) add X's to the right of the profiles to log out. I edited my question right before you answered to include Reddit News as an example, which includes these options.\n. Awesome idea :) . \nThis album shows how it works in Reddit News.\n- Initially you are not logged in. You get buttons to log out or add an account (log out probably being a bug)\n- Once you have added an account it also logs you in\n- Showing the profiles shows the previous options (log out and add account). If you press log out then it logs you out but the account still exists. If you want you can log back in by clicking the account name\n- Pressing the X completely removes the account from the app and logs you out.\nObviously it's just an example. I can't think of many instances where having accounts but not being logged in is useful. So your log out could for example immediately remove the account too. But that's all up to you :) .\n. @mikepenz I put in a pull request for the previously mentioned bug that occurred when switching profiles quickly.\nThe issue that @khammami has is caused by the fact that the drawer tries to show three profiles in the header even though not all the profile items are actually profiles. In AccountHeader.java the function buildProfiles() builds the little icon previews. However it doesn't check if the item with the profile interface is a ProfileDrawerItem or a ProfileSettingDrawerItem.\nThe following fixes the small icons for example:\nJava\nif (mProfileFirst != null && mProfileFirst instanceof ProfileDrawerItem) {\n    ...\n}\nif (mProfileSecond != null && mProfileSecond instanceof ProfileDrawerItem) {\n    ...\n}\nHowever if you want devs to be able to create their own profile drawer items it might be handy to add a new function that they can override to specify whether or not to show it. Or whatever way would suit you :) . \nThere are still some other exceptions. What happens if the user only has options (example image)? Or what if the user first adds the setting icons and then the profiles (example image)?\n. @mikepenz I put in a pull request for the previously mentioned bug that occurred when switching profiles quickly.\nThe issue that @khammami has is caused by the fact that the drawer tries to show three profiles in the header even though not all the profile items are actually profiles.

Or what if the user first adds the setting icons and then the profiles (example image)?\n. Looking good! But I did find another bug. I took the example app and removed all profiles except for the first one:\nJava\n.addProfiles(\n    profile,\n    // profile2,\n    // profile3,\n    // profile4,\n    // profile5,\n    //don't ask but google uses 14dp for the add account icon in gmail but 20dp for the normal icons (like manage account)\n    new ProfileSettingDrawerItem().withEmail(\"Add Account\").withIcon(new IconicsDrawable(this, GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_add).actionBarSize().paddingDp(5)).withIdentifier(1),\n    new ProfileSettingDrawerItem().withEmail(\"Manage Account\").withIcon(GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_settings)\n)\nAnd created a button to add profile2:\nJava\nfindViewById(R.id.add_profile).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(View v) {\n        headerResult.addProfile(new ProfileDrawerItem().withName(\"Max Muster\").withEmail(\"max.mustermann@gmail.com\").withIcon(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.profile2)), 0);\n    }\n});\nHowever this kinda messes up the icons as can be seen in this and this screenshot.\nIt appears to have to do with the order. Adding it on position 1 instead of 0 works. The same occurs when you already have two items. If you don't add it at the end it goes wrong.\nAnd I have one more stylistic remark: Picking a profile from the profile section shows you that the profiles switch in the header because there's a delay on the closing. However when you click the icons in the header the drawer closes immediately and you can't immediately see whether it has switched. I think it would be nice and consistent if the drawer also had a delay of half a second when using these icons to switch profiles.\n. Looking good! But I did find another bug.

At the moment if there's a single actual profile you can still use the selection list. No issue there as you can always enable/disable it with the following two lines:\nJava\n.withSelectionListEnabled(true)\n.withSelectionListEnabledForSingleProfile(true)\nHowever if my only item is the log in button (from the example of yours) then I can't get the list to show, even using the two options above.\nAnd your previous fixes have created another small issue. If there's only a single option in the selection list, for example 'log in', then it would be nice to have this show up as the 'current profile', to show people where to click to log in. So if they click it the normal selection list could open with the options.\n. @mikepenz I found another small bug.

And good idea on adding the removeProfile option. I'm sure many of us would've encountered that at some point in time.\nI do have one more stylistic / functionality suggestion, but I couldn't find the specifics in the material documents. I think it would be nice and intuitive if the icons at the top would represent the three most recently used profiles in the right order. At the moment if you have profiles 1 2 and 3 and you press 3 then 1 and 3 will switch, putting the icons in the order of 3 2 1. My suggestion would be to then make it 3 1 2. Or if you have the accounts 1 2 3 as icons and another account 4 in the drawer, if you press 4 you get 4 2 3, instead of 4 1 2. If you get what I mean.\n. @mikepenz I had a look at the compact drawer and everything seems to work fine. Other than my current open issue it looks like everything is okay :) .\n. Thank you for taking your time to explain this :) . \n. Ah, that's probably it! I've got the following OnAccountHeaderClickListener on the account header:\nJava\n@Override\npublic void onSelectionClick(IProfile currentProfile) {\n    if (currentProfile instanceof IDrawerItem && ((IDrawerItem) currentProfile).getIdentifier() == LOGIN_ID) {\n        // ...\n    } else if (currentProfile instanceof IDrawerItem && ((IDrawerItem) currentProfile).getIdentifier() == LOGOUT_ID) {\n        // ...\n        resetDrawer();\n    }\n}\nSo the drawer items are changed while the profile items are still shown. Meaning that once the on click is processed the original items, which were copied from the drawer before, are set back. I should now be able to create a simple example application which shows this issue, if you want.\n. Works like a charm now, thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks.\n. Awesome, thanks.\n. There are two ways to solve that:\n1. Use the .TranslucentStatus version of the style: MaterialDrawerTheme.Light.DarkToolbar.TranslucentStatus\n2. Remove the the padding on the Toolbar (RelativeLayout) ViewGroup in your Activity, because I assume you've copied that from the sample app:\nXML\n<RelativeLayout\n    android:id=\"@+id/toolbar_container\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:background=\"?attr/colorPrimary\"\n    android:paddingTop=\"@dimen/tool_bar_top_padding\"\n    android:elevation=\"4dp\">\n    <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n        android:id=\"@+id/toolbar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n        android:background=\"?attr/colorPrimary\"\n        style=\"@style/ToolBarStyle\"\n        android:transitionName=\"actionBar\"/>\n</RelativeLayout>\nThe first one would be the best choice if you want the drawer visible behind the status bar.\n. I guess you're not aware of DividerDrawerItem? This seems to do exactly what you want.\n. I just stumbled upon this blog post http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/01/partial-slidingpanelayout.html. Might help the person who's going to tackle this challenge.\n. Okay, thanks for the answer. I'll figure something out then :) .\n. @MichaelEvans In the end I simply chose to spend a bit more time and change activities to extend ActionBarActivity, use toolbars, et cetera. So unfortunately I can't give any advice on this.\n. ",

If u wish - that my solution ;)\njust add in PrimaryDrawerItem or/and SecondaryDrawerItem\n``` java\nprivate URLLoaderCallback callback = null;\npublic interface URLLoaderCallback {\n    void callbackCall(String iconUrl, ImageView iconView);\n}\npublic PrimaryDrawerItem withIcon(String iconUrl, URLLoaderCallback callback) {\n    assert (callback!=null);\n    this.iconUrl = iconUrl;\n    this.callback = callback;\n    return this;\n}\n\n```\nand in method public View convertView(... make changes\njava\n        if (callback == null && TextUtils.isEmpty(iconUrl)) {\n            Drawable icon = null;\n            Drawable selectedIcon = null;\n...\n        } else {\n            callback.callbackCall(iconUrl, viewHolder.icon);//try load external image\n        }\nIn your primary class add:\njava\n    PrimaryDrawerItem.URLLoaderCallback callback = new PrimaryDrawerItem.URLLoaderCallback(){\n        @Override\n        public void callbackCall(String iconUrl, ImageView iconView) {\n            Constants.uilImageLoader.displayImage(!TextUtils.isEmpty(iconUrl)?iconUrl:\"\",\n                    iconView,\n                    Utils.isWiFiEnabled(MainActivity.this)?Constants.uilUserOptionsWifi:Constants.uilUserOptionsMobile);\n        }\n    };\nand now we can load images like this:\njava\nmDrawerRight.addItem(new PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(friend.getName()).withIcon(url, callback);\n. I specifically used the callback, so as not to tie the MaterialDrawer code to an external library (loader pictures).\nThis will require just add one function. :)\nAnd yours magnificent library will be even better :)\n. have this problem too\n    Process: com.s0l.social, PID: 18037\n    java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.s0l.social/com.s0l.social.MainActivity}:

I found the problem of the alignment !!!\nit is because the text (name and email) is aligned to the left of the \"switcher\" arrow, but the arrow icon did not appear, then the text runs to the left.\ni donwloaded the icons of material design from https://github.com/google/material-design-icons\nbut where do I put them to work the example of the library?\n. no, the rom is the official from samsung, I have never installed a rom on my phone.\n. ok, I've solved the problem of the icons, and the problem of alignment I've solved placing these 2 lines in the xml code of the layout file material_drawer_header.xml\nandroid:layout_marginLeft = \"@dimen/material_drawer_vertical_padding\"\nandroid:layout_marginStart = \"@dimen/material_drawer_vertical_padding\"\nI copied these two lines from the \"account_header_drawer_current\" (the CircularImageView above).\nI do not know why it does not work without it, apparently it's some kind of bug in the version of android, because apparently ignores the padding properties \"start\" and \"left\", it's super weird ...\n\n. but the \"lag\" in the opening persist...and it's noticeable.\nI will try to make a video so you can see, it's the only way.\nthanks mike !!!\n.

Another question\n.withCloseOnClick(false) doesn\u00b4t work when i use it inside the MiniDrawerExample. Is this a bug or is there another way to do it?\n. And last but not least.

Why don't you just set the screen width? You can get the\nscreen width from your Android device.\nThat's no limitation of the MaterialDrawer that's just how the\nDrawerLayout works. A Slider so the thing you can drag in, has to define\nan exact width.\n(You can try to define the Slider width MATCH_PARENT but I don't know\nwhat will happen, just use . withDrawerWidthPx(View.MATCH_PARENT))\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/978#issuecomment-179675518\n.\n. \n",

It is API 15. I would suggest testing on other physical devices with varying screen sizes if you have them (or access to them). This one has a very small (4.3\" / 10,6cm) screen so that might be why the display metrics were off. Maybe there is a middle ground somewhere. As for right now, setting the resize to only L seems to work. :D\n. It is API 15. I would suggest testing on other physical devices with varying screen sizes if you have them (or access to them).

So why do you want to change the text size?. \n. @yoavst It can be implemented.\n\nIn BaseDrawerItem Add\n```\n private int textBadgeColor= 0;\n public T withTextBadgeColor(int textBadgeColor) {\n this.textBadgeColor = textBadgeColor;\n return (T) this;\n}\n\npublic int getTextBadgeColor() {\n    return textBadgeColor;\n   }\n```\nThen in PrimaryDrawerItem\nComment the below\n// viewHolder.badge.setTextColor(UIUtils.getTextColor(color, selected_text));\nAdd\nviewHolder.badge.setTextColor(getTextBadgeColor());\nThen in your activity for the PrimaryDrrawerItem\n.withTextBadgeColor(Color.GREEN).withBadge(\"23\")\nI believe this breaks the material specs. You can do something similar for the background\n\nRegarding the rounded rounded rectangle you can add a custom textview. \n. @yoavst I don't think its necessary in most cases. As when you select a drawer item you apply a primary color to the drawer item. Its according to material specs. Just modify the library and customize the same.\nYou can check the same in app called wallsplash (with badges) by milkepenz which uses the material drawer. \n. @mikepenz yes a custom drawer item would be a  good choice. \n. @nambv I don't think its required cause it does not match the material design guidelines. \nYou can have a header(a custom view) added to the Drawer.

FWIW, I'm running into the same issue (and confirming the removal of .withToolbar() resolves it).\nEdit: I think I found the problem but it kinda sucks. I'll report back.\n. I think I've found a better fix, though. Testing now.\n. This seems to be an issue with the Android support library v4. espresso-contrib:2.0 depends on support-v4 version 21.0.3. MaterialDrawer 2.0.7 (the last released version @kaushald reported as working with Espresso) also depends on support-v4 21.0.3, while subsequent releases (2.5.0+) were upgraded to version 22.0.0 (targeting SDK 22). Having both versions in the dependency tree seems to cause the problem. Reverting the target SDK and support-v4 version in the MaterialDrawer library resolves the issue, but the better solution is probably to exclude the support-v4 module from the espresso-contrib:2.0 dependency in the app as such:\nandroidTestCompile('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-contrib:2.0') {\n    exclude module: 'support-annotations'\n    exclude module: 'support-v4'\n}\nNo changes to MaterialDrawer required. Thoughts, @mikepenz ?\n. @kaushald Thanks, glad I could help. Here's some bonus information:\nI started writing some more elaborate tests and ran into more errors. You may need to exclude recyclerview-v7 as well, if you use any other libraries that depend on recyclerview-v7:22.0.0 (such as @mikepenz 's nifty AboutLibraries). I think that should be the last one we need to worry about, looking at the dependency tree.\nandroidTestCompile ('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-contrib:2.0') {\n    exclude module: 'support-annotations'\n    exclude module: 'support-v4'\n    exclude module: 'recyclerview-v7'\n}\n. You should be able to use .withTextColor() or .withTextColorRes() for color. You can change the typeface using .withTypeface() but I don't see anything for size.\n. You should be able to use .withTextColor() or .withTextColorRes() for color. You can change the typeface using .withTypeface() but I don't see anything for size.\n. That doesn't appear to be possible at this time.

That might be why these options are not supported, but I defer to the author.\n. That doesn't appear to be possible at this time.

That might be why these options are not supported, but I defer to the author.\n. You need to add .withTintSelectedIcon(true) to enable that.\n. @Remie-l Is that logcat from pre-Lollipop? The \"could not find class\" message is normal (and ignorable) if you aren't on Lollipop. See issue #166 for confirmation from Mike.\nThe reason your image isn't loading is because of a different line in the logcat:\nI/MaterialDrawer\ufe55 you have not specified a ImageLoader implementation through the DrawerImageLoader.init(IDrawerImageLoader) method\nYou need to define the ImageLoader logic. See CustomApplication.java in the included sample app for an example. The library itself doesn't know how to handle URIs, it requires that you tell it how to retrieve the image. \n. You can open the drawer with result.openDrawer(); immediately after you've build the drawer and have a Drawer.Result object if you wish.\nAs for handling clicks, you're probably looking for identifiers. You can create each drawer item using .withIdentifier(someNumber) and then in your Drawer.OnDrawerItemClickListener you can just use a switch statement on drawerItem.getIdentifier() to determine which one was clicked. The example app uses inline literal integers but I would probably recommend defining them elsewhere like protected static final int DRAWER_ITEM_SEARCH = 13; for example and comparing the result of getIdentifier() to the constants you defined.\nI don't think you can open a dialog without closing the drawer. I think the only drawer item types that don't close the drawer inherently are switches and toggles. @mikepenz might correct me here, though.\nHope that helps for now.\n. Check out #176 \n. > withCheckable() was finally renamed to withSelectable()\nIs it sad that this is the part which excites me the most? :trollface:\n. Drawer.OnDrawerItemClickListener onItemClick position looks off, this time it's one too high. Is that an intentional change (maybe AccountHeader is always position 0 or something?)? Didn't have time to debug that yet.\nPadding looks off on 4.1.1 as shown here (flush against left edge):\n\nBut it's fine on 4.4.4 and 5.1.0. Will keep testing.\n. @mikepenz OK, position change makes sense then. Identifiers going forward.\nNot sure what's up with the padding.\n. .withIconTintingEnabled(true) isn't working for me either.\n. Cool, I'll test in my app once it's available via gradle. Thanks.\n. @mikepenz Looks like padding was only fixed for drawer items with an icon? My items without icons are still flush.\n.withIconTintingEnabled(true) is tinting the drawer item name but not the icon. Ironic, given the method name. :wink:\n. @mikepenz Icon tinting seems inconsistent. Opening the drawer, selecting different items, closing the drawer, opening again, selecting another item, etc. (monkey testing). Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Behavior is the same on 4.1.1 and 5.1.0.\nAlso, I think prior versions selected the first drawer item by default? This isn't happening anymore (likely due to the positioning change discussed earlier). Considered using DrawerBuilder#withSelectedItem, but it may need to be refactored to take an identity instead of a position?\n. Tinting is fine in 3.x.\nDefault selection is fine, can just use .setSelectionByIdentifier() if savedInstanceState == null or something (assuming .withSelectedItem() doesn't get updated).\n. @mikepenz Tinting looks good now, agreed. Thanks!\n. I'm in favor of leaving everything position-based behind, assuming functional parity exists using identifiers. Deprecate the position methods in 3.x (if there will be another release before 4.x) and remove them completely from 4.0.0.\n. Hmm, I suppose so. Too bad. Unless you could do something like .addItemBefore() and/or .addItemAfter(), but that might be a bit awkward.\n. @mikepenz\nWas the 8dp padding at the top and bottom of the drawer item list removed intentionally?\nAlso noticed (not new to b7) my DividerDrawerItem is invisible. Expected it to be #1F000000 from material_drawer_divider, I think?\n. @mikepenz\nWas the 8dp padding at the top and bottom of the drawer item list removed intentionally?\nAlso noticed (not new to b7) my DividerDrawerItem is invisible.

(PrimaryDescrpitionDrawerItem, PrimaryDescriptionCheckboxDrawerItem, PrimarySchie\u00dfMichTot etc.)\n. @mikepenz Please don't punch me in the face, but could you maybe add another DrawerItem with an actual CheckBox?

However, the problem is, before the quoted portion of the code, the mSelectedItem value is correct, and after that check/assign, it goes to 1.

I've an Activity with several fragments each of which sets up it's own drawer in onShow which doesn't count as 'special stuff' in my opinion. \nThe activity layout is pretty simple. It includes a toolbar and a layout to which the different fragments of the activity get added via fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.main, fragment, ...);\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n              xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n              android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n              android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n              android:padding=\"0dp\"\n              android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n>\n\n<include layout=\"@layout/toolbar\"/>\n\n<LinearLayout\n              android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n              android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"\n              android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n              android:padding=\"0dp\"\n              android:id=\"@+id/main\"\n              tools:context=\".ActivityMain\">\n</LinearLayout>\n\n\n```\n. It uses a new one. \nIn the Fragment onShow I'm using \nDrawerFactory.buildDrawer(getActivity(), ((ActivityMain) getActivity()).toolbar, drawerListener, 0);\nThe buildDrawer returns a new drawer result object (see https://github.com/owntracks/android/blob/master/src/main/java/org/owntracks/android/support/DrawerFactory.java)\n. Ah, good catch. Thanks for clearing that up. \nWhy I'm doing this: \nThe activity has two fragments, a list and a map fragment between which the user can transition. Both fragments have a dedicated toolbar that acts as the actionbar. I'm currently inflating the drawer for each one as each toolbar should provide access to the drawer. \nMaybe it would be better to just inflate the drawer for the primary fragment and add back navigation to the root.\n.

It doesnt work on Lollipop onwards.\nI've filed an AOSP bug report related to that, https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=172067\n. Upgraded to 2.9.5, the default state is now tinted, but it breaks the selected state color.\nIt is now always tinted with blue.\nPreviously on 2.9.2 it was correctly tinted according to withSelectedIconColorRes.\nNote: I did not inherit from MaterialDrawer Themes nor override any material_* attrs\njava\nnew PrimaryDrawerItem()\n    .withName(NAVDRAWER_TITLE_RES_ID[i])\n    .withIcon(NAVDRAWER_ICON_RES_ID[i])\n    .withTextColorRes(R.color.navdrawer_text_color) // black\n    .withIconColorRes(R.color.navdrawer_icon_tint) // grey\n    .withSelectedTextColorRes(R.color.navdrawer_text_color_selected) // red\n    .withSelectedIconColorRes(R.color.navdrawer_icon_tint_selected) // red\n    .withIconTinted(true);\n.

Never knew you had javadoc for the project, nice work!\nApologies for raising this issue, turns out I missed the release section of the repository! :blush: \n. @mikepenz is there a way to override the default behavior? I only ask because I have noticed you can have two items highlighted as if they're selected at one time by doing something similar to what I have described. . I've downloaded the source code and delved in to try and find a solution myself to the problem, it seems that because the MaterialDrawer library uses the FastAdapter library, it seems like if I'm going to have to make a pull request for any potential solution firstly for the FastAdapter and secondly for this library.\nI'm thinking a solution could be implemented within the handleSelection(View view, Item item, int position) method from the FastAdapter library. I notice there is a boolean called mMultiSelect, a similar boolean could be created called mSelectParent so you can enable / disable whether or not you want parents to be selected whenever one of their subItems is selected.\nI know there's a method getParent() within AbstractDrawerItem.java (MaterialDrawer), just wondering if it would be possible to get the parent from the item within the handleSelection method?. Why does it disable it? . ",

I guess we can't simply create your own ActionBarDrawerToggle, because we don't have a reference to the DrawerLayout?\n. @mikepenz \nWell now that I look at updates to this library, it might be possible to just cut out some of my logic - I have a LayerDrawable for badging the icon with a number over it. \nI want the bottom layer of the drawable to have selected / unselected state - so right now I'd need to maintain two LayerDrawables, and pass them in via .withIcon and .withSelectedIcon. I'd like to set the base layer of the LayerDrawable to a StateListDrawable with both states, and then the selected state of the drawer item propagate to the icon?\nIs there a sample that shows the badging that this library provides?

Okay, I think that is/was a very good improvement. It would be great if you could document this and maybe the other Methods of the DrawerItem to prevent Questions like this and make the life for Developers even more easy. \n. Okay, no Prob. :D\n. I think it still makes sense since there are (sadly) some users who don't know that there is the Drawer. I came from this Library: https://github.com/neokree/MaterialNavigationDrawer which had this feature and I missed it here. (I like yours better btw, I'm glad I changed, great job!)\nAbout the peak, are you able to produce this effect with one of your Devices or an emulator? If not, do you know how to get it?\n. Okay It is not shown on my Phone. Weird. \nUhm sorry, you are right I implemented it by myself. :D It is just some Interaction with SharedPreferences and savedInstanceState.\nIf you create a new Project in Android Studio and select \"Activity with Navigation Drawer\" you will get some sample code, containing that feature. It would be great if you could keep the names of the settings, so your lib will recognise if people already used that implementation!\n. Sure, just wait a sec :)\n. https://gist.github.com/RubenGees/0c80196f88b3d2a44b2f\nThis is the code, generated by Android Studio.\nThis is the interesting part:\njava\n    /**\n     * Per the design guidelines, you should show the drawer on launch until the user manually\n     * expands it. This shared preference tracks this.\n     */\n    private static final String PREF_USER_LEARNED_DRAWER = \"navigation_drawer_learned\";\n. :+1: \n. Maybe there is some padding around the button?\n. Maybe there is some padding around the button?\n. Okay, no prop.\nLooking forward to your solution! Thank you for your great work.\n. I'll make a Video later. My Device is nexus 6 \n. Okay, great.\n. I'm not sure if I understand what you want to say. Why shouln't the ripple play if the user selects the item? I thought a ripple shows, that the user pressed something?\nAnd why is it working then in the normal Section? (Above the StickyBottom one)\nI'm sorry if you make an obvious point and I just don't get it :D\n. Okay thank you for the clarification! I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I noticed that, but it's perfectly okay if you don't want to change that. Thank you for your work!\n. Oh yeah, sorry I missed that. I saw materialdrawer and thought it would have to do with the library. But I think it's better to ask them to have a bug nobody knows about.\n. Oh yeah, sorry I missed that.

The user can select which callback methods he wants to override. -> Removes unnecessary empty methods.\n. Hmm, okay you have a point there.

Haha yes, I know what you mean xD\nHmm I don't know. I would really love to see that feature and I think it is always better to make the code \"more perfect\" even if some users might have to google that for like 3 minutes. \nBut of course you have a perfectly valid point here and its your lib after all :)\n.

Okay! I close this then.\n. Hmm, should I ignore it and hope it to never appear again? :D\n. Hmm, okay thanks for the advice. The Memory of my App is mainly used by strings in the RAM (and that should not be much). It was the first crash of this type since release, 3 days ago.\n. Regular drawables. This is one for example: https://github.com/RubenGees/Vocabletrainer/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_list.png\n. Okay, I'll ignore it then. If this happens often and I can't find the issue myself, I'll report back.\n. Great work! But I have noticed one thing: The ripple is gone/replaced.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nIs this intentional? If yes, why?\n. Great work! But I have noticed one thing: The ripple is gone/replaced.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nIs this intentional? If yes, why?\n. Ahh, okay I see.\n. Ahh, okay I see.\n. I may have found a bug:\nI have 2 sections:\nOne with .withDrawerItems() and one with .withStickyDrawerItems().\nAfter an orientation change I build the drawer with .withSavedInstance(savedInstanceState). If the currently selected item is from the first section, the drawer will remind if it was open and will remain open after an orientation change. Just as expected. But if the current item is from the sticky section, it will close after an orientation change, even it was open before. \n. Great! That was fast :+1: \n. Great! That was fast :+1: \n. Yes, looks good to me. Great stability for a beta-version :D\n. Yes, looks good to me. Great stability for a beta-version :D\n. Whoa, the shadow looks really cool! :+1: \n. Use a interface connection between your activity and your fragment. This is how I do it:\nIn Activity:\n@Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n        if (drawer.isDrawerOpen()) {\n            drawer.closeDrawer();\n        } else {\n            return onBackPressedListener.onBackPressed();\n        }\n    }\nThe interface:\n```\n    public interface OnBackPressedListener {\n    /**\n     * Callback, which is called if the Back Button is pressed.\n     * Fragments that extend MainFragment can/should override this Method.\n     *\n     * @return true if the App can be closed, false otherwise\n     */\n    boolean onBackPressed();\n}\n\n```\nIn Fragment:\n/**\n     * {@inheritDoc}\n     */\n    @Override\n    public boolean onBackPressed() {\n        return true;\n    }\nAll my Fragments implement the Listener and each decides on it own, what shuold happen.\n. Interesting. Maybe there is a typo in my code or something. Try to delete the Method and let Android Studio auto-complete it for you. (Alt+Enter)\n. Okay, I'll have a look at it tomorrow.\n. One thing I see is, that the brackets are missing at the call in your Activity. Try onBackPressedListener.onBackPressed();\nDo you implement the interface correctly? Try to use a fully qualified declaration in your Fragment: implements YourActivity.onBackPressedListener\nOn a side note: Classes and interfaces are declared with a upper-case letter. Only if you use them (Declare them as a field) you write them with a lower-case letter.\n. Sorry for the repost... :D\n. Hmm, okay, so I have to manually set a flag or something to prevent the callback from being called twice? I do some loading in the callback, which I want to avoid to do twice and it is not very clean of course...\nI thought savedInstanceStates are exactly for such purposes?\nSorry for the confusion :D\n. Okay, makes sense. Thank you once again for your answer!\n. I would also like to help with this. It is a great library and I think there are many people (like me) who want to contribute something back for the amazing work you did here. \nI agree with @simonckenyon that we need to discuss some table of contents for the things which are not mentioned in the README, add a stubbed topic for them in the wiki and people could start to write Articles for it. \nTopics could be:\nMethods of DrawerBuilder with like 2 lines of text, explaining what the method does, like I did in my Library for example.\nSame for Drawer items. maybe explain the differences between the types of DrawerItems with small images or something.\nWe could also prevent some questions I have seen with topics for them:\nHow to implement the onBackPressedListener?, How to use the identiefier to block double calls on the same DrawerItem, ...\nSo @mikepenz if you could come up with a small table of contents I and others could start to write! :D\n. It is a bug which was reported in my bug-collector tool. It was in the last version I published, which used  the last available release 3.x of the Drawer before 4.x was released I think. So it's propably fixed, didn't thought of that...\n. Yes, sure, as I said it happens almost never so we can safely ignore this I think.\n. The icons on the screenshots, are the icons as they are displayed in the App. They differ in color (might not be clear through the screenshots)\nTinting is enabled for the one thats added to the normal drawer, for the other one (Account) I have set nothing else than the title.\n. Okay, got it, I had to enable withiconTinted(). What me has confused was, that I don't have to set that if I use one of the Icons integrated in Iconics...\n. Okay, not a library issue, happens on a sample project without your lib, too.\n. If anybody is experiencing the same: Set <item name=\"windowActionModeOverlay\">true</item> in your theme.\n. Yes, didn't look into that... :D\n. This happens with the primary items and the account header items, but not with the sticky items.\n.

Just the regular one, which is weird because the MiniDrawer pops up in the log.\n. Okay, great! \n. Okay, great! \n. Works great so far, but I noticed one minor thing:\nIf a user opens the App for the first time, the Drawer is supposed to stay at the screen until used or swiped away. That doens't work with 5.0 for me whereas it does work with 4.6.4. \nWith 5.0 the Drawer shortly shows up and then closes itself at first start.\n. Hmm okay very weird, I will have a look.\n. Use the updateBadge() method of your Drawer object.\njava\ndrawer.updateBadge(drawerItemId, new StringHolder(text));\n.

See this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Materialize/issues/8\nBasically you need to add a method like this:\njava\npublic void setStatusBarColor(@ColorInt int color){\n    drawer.getDrawerLayout().setStatusBarBackgroundColor(color);\n}\n.

In my App if the user presses the back button and is not currently viewing section A I want to show section A before closing the App.\nTo do so I have a method handleBackPressed, which looks like so:\n``` java\npublic boolean handleBackPressed() {\n        if (isDrawerOpen()) {\n            drawer.closeDrawer();\n        return true;\n    } else if (currentDrawerItemId != ID_A) {\n        select(ID_B);\n\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n```\nselect is as simple as\njava\npublic void select(@DrawerItemId int id) {\n    drawer.setSelection(id);\n}\nI think this happens because the framework is handling something incorrect like you mentioned in the other issue with coloring.\n.

Ah okay makes sense. Maybe thats something were the api could be expanded.\nI did create a IconicsDrawable myself because I wanted to customize color. If that is not possible maybe something like withIconColor would be good?\n. Nevermind, did not read your answer correctly.\nThanks for the quick answer as always!\n. Might there be a solution without specifying the dependencies manually? I mean it's Gradles job to resolve those and that are 3 (in my case 2 as I use Iconics at other places) dependencies more the user would have to maintain...\n. Ah you're right. Worked after deleting all Gradle caches and redownloading.\n. I investigated further and this just seems to happen on the x86 variant of the API 16 emulator. It does not happen on arm API 16 nor on a genymotion emulator.\nMaybe a bug of the emluator?\n. I investigated further and this just seems to happen on the x86 variant of the API 16 emulator.

Should we manage state ourself somehow or is this something you could add to the library?.

    "ammar786-1": "Hi Mike, \nAlthough I agree with you that a navigation drawer in any other activity other than the root is kind of not a valid navigation pattern, but Google itself uses this pattern in the Play Store app. Go into the detail activity of an app, then swipe from the left edge to reveal the drawer. There is no indication of a drawer being there, but it's there. \n. ",

    "str4d": "Seen here too. I am using v3.0.5 with this code (loading the real IProfiles once the app is unlocked):\n... new AccountHeaderBuilder()\n        .withActivity(this)\n        .withHeaderBackground(R.drawable.drawer_header_background)\n        .addProfiles(getLockedProfile())\n        .withOnAccountHeaderListener(new AccountHeader.OnAccountHeaderListener() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onProfileChanged(View view, IProfile profile, boolean currentProfile) {\n                if (profile.getIdentifier() == ID_LOCKED)\n                    // Request password...\n                else if (!currentProfile)\n                    identitySelected(profile);\n                return false;\n            }\n        })\n        .withSavedInstance(savedInstanceState)\nHowever, I only get profile = null when clicking on the currently-selected profile's icon (top-left). If I click on the second or third profile icons, or I open the account selector and click any profile (including currently-selected), I get the expected non-null IProfile.\n. You miss my point. If you look at the drawables themselves, some have excess space around them, inside the drawable. This is where the inconsistency creeps in.\nHere are some examples. (All icons below are nominally 24dp, ie. the image in drawable-mdpi is physically 24px x 24px. The physical icon I refer to is the rectangular region within the image that actually contains non-transparent pixels.)\n- ic_inbox_grey600_24dp.png has 3dp of padding; the actual physical icon is 18dp high and 18dp wide.\n- ic_cloud_upload_grey600_24dp.png has no padding; the actual physical icon is 16dp high and 24dp wide.\n- ic_send_grey600_24dp.png has 1dp of padding; the actual physical icon is 18dp high and 21dp wide (with 2dp padding on left and 1dp padding on right).\n- ic_delete_grey600_24dp.png has 3dp of padding; the actual physical icon is 18dp high and 14dp wide.\nThe corresponding IIcons use the same physical icon shapes but don't retain the padding. This means that when actually using the above four icons in a navigation drawer (as I am), ic_inbox and ic_delete appear much larger than they should.\nYes, your drawer is correctly implementing the Material Design Guidelines for navigation drawer icons. But the IIcons themselves are inconsistently sized, which leads to the drawer IIcons being incorrectly sized. So if allowing the IIcons to be resized here is the wrong solution, then the right one is for the IIcons to correctly include the padding that they are supposed to.\n. I can, yes. I have now had a chance to test the padding methods, and it does solve the problem this issue covers. However, I still think it shouldn't be necessary for every single developer to manually measure and apply this padding just to re-instate the right inter-icon ratios.\nThinking about it, this is probably a more general Android-Iconics issue. Perhaps having e.g. a GoogleMaterial.PaddedIcon class that automatically adds the original padding (and then the user can add extra padding with paddingDp() to that as they need) would be the best way to resolve this.\n.

Or alternatively, a new icon namespace could be added - gmdp - that uses all the gmd icons but includes their original padding. This would be far more versatile and useful to developers, and I expect probably easier to implement.\n.

Well, the built-in ListView works but I need some other features with the list such as drag-n-drop/animated item manipulation.

Thanks, I used to implement my own drawer by using google's drawer template but their template is over engineered with fragments and all sorts of stuff that I don't like. One of the tricky part of the nav drawer is the stickydraweritems and interactions with the ToolBar/StatusBar. I choose this lib so I can save some time :)\n. Oh well, I guess that will work.

Now I've switched to a normal badge with a number inside.\n. @mikepenz Glide works perfectly and something strange happened. Every time I click on a drawer item and switch to another fragment, and navigate to another activity and come back (so that drawerAccountHeader.updateProfile(profileDrawerItem) is called), the header image will just get lost (I've never tested this way before).\nSo I traversed up the code and found something in class ImageHolder:\njava\npublic boolean applyTo(ImageView imageView, String tag) {\n    if (mUri != null) {\n        imageView.setImageURI(mUri);\n        /*\n        if (\"http\".equals(mUri.getScheme()) || \"https\".equals(mUri.getScheme())) {\n            DrawerImageLoader.getInstance().setImage(imageView, mUri, tag);\n        } else {\n        }\n        */\n    ...\nThe commented code seems to work with the DrawerImageLoader. Why are these lines commented? And could there be some connections between these lines and the error?\n. But I'm not quite sure why the error will happen only after I perform a fragment switch. drawerAccountHeader.updateProfile(profileDrawerItem) should be called whenever navigated back from another activity. I'll have a look at the fragment switch to find if there's anything wrong with it.\n. Well I think I've solved the problem. As I've mentioned above clicking on drawer items will perform a fragment switch which will make the imageView.getContext() in the DrawerImageLoader's initialization confused. IMHO the detached fragment interferes with the image loader but I'm not sure why. After changing it to getApplicationContext() the header image will never disappear.\nA better solution (which I think is) is to put the initialization process in the activity containing the drawer, e.g. MainActivity, so that MainActivity.this can be used as a context for Glide.\n.

What do you mean by that? It is not recommended?\n. Oh OK, cool. Many thanks Penz. Btw Penz sounds European. Are you multilingual? :-)\n.

You can get the draweritem by a position, like drawer.getDrawerItem(int identifier). Then you should be able to get the StringHolder for the Badge with getBadge().

Sorry I don't understand your question, what do you mean by the \"correct theme\"?\n.

Specifically getting the toolbar to appear when the user exits immersive mode (by dragging open the status bar). We set immersive fullscreen mode like this (as per Google recommendations):\njava\nactivity.getWindow().getDecorView().setSystemUiVisibility(\n                        View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE\n                        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION\n                        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN\n                        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION\n                        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN\n                        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE\n                        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE);\nactivity.getWindow().decorView.setOnSystemUiVisibilityChangeListener\n                (new View.OnSystemUiVisibilityChangeListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onSystemUiVisibilityChange(int flags) {\n                        boolean visible = (flags & View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION) == 0;\n                        if (visible) {\n                            activity.getSupportActionBar().show();\n                        } else {\n                            activity.getSupportActionBar().hide();\n                        }\n                    }\n                });\nbut the action bar gets drawn underneath (overlapping with) the status bar. If I remove the MaterialDrawer build() call then this doesn't happen so presumably it's a missing setFitsSystemWindows() in the library somewhere. I've tried fiddling with a bunch of stuff but can't get it to work.\n. I hacked together an example with the sample app working correctly in immersive mode. I still can't figure out what the problem is in our app though :-/ \n(The above requires android:fitsSystemWindows=\"true\" set in the layout)\nI'll report back when I figure out what the problem is\n. That sounds about right... I finally figured out that in the sample app you have android:layout_marginTop=\"@dimen/tool_bar_top_padding\" set in the toolbar, and if I add this then I can basically get it to work, but it's quite hacky as I have to do it programatically.\nIs it possible for you to provide an interface for us to tell the drawer when the system UI is and is not visible?\n. @mikepenz \nThanks, what do I need to do to the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout? Sorry I'm a bit slow today\n. Hmmm calling mDrawer.getScrimInsetsFrameLayout().setSystemUIVisible(true); when I receive the onSystemUiVisibilityChange listener event doesn't appear to do anything. How do I redraw? I tried mDrawer.getScrimInsetsFrameLayout().getView().invalidate() but that didn't do anything either. Sorry if this is a dumb question\n. > or you use the same mechanism shown with the MiniDrawer sample. this also does not move over the content.\nhmm are you sure about that? I am using the same mechanism as the MiniDrawer example, and I just checked the sample app, which definitely moves the content (you can see that the text \"embedded drawer\" moves to the right and is no longer centered in the view when the drawer is open).\n. also the navigation icon in the action bar changes to a back button when I enable the MiniDrawer whereas in gmail I believe it is a hamburger which expands the MiniDrawer into a proper nav. drawer.\n. The left caret at the top of the drawer which folds it into MiniDrawer (as in pic in first post) would be cool as well if I were to be greedy :)\n. By \"this line is defined there\" do you mean it's visible in the keylines and margins diagram? I couldn't see it defined in the actual content of the spec, so I suspect it's just used in the keylines diagram for demarcation. The line isn't present in any of the Google apps that I looked at, though that's not always a good indication.\n.

    "zaclimon": "@mikepenz Yeah I know about the withActionBarDrawerToggleAnimated(boolean enabled) method, that said even though it animates the arrow when the Drawer is opened/closed, it doesn't animate when I want to transform it.\nSee here a screen record regarding what I meant:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ea1CohUrvM\nUsing the recommended way of showing the back arrow, you can see that the arrow is animated when trying to open/close the Drawer. However, it doesn't animate when accessing the wanted section of the app.\n. I don't know if somebody will have the same situation eventually but I managed to fix this thanks for the link @mikepenz. I used the animation from the StackOverFlow link and I applied also a OnDrawerNavigationListener so I can go a step backwards when pressing the back arrow.\nAs a prerequisite as well, the .withActionBarDrawerToggleAnimated method must be enabled.\nThat said, I had an issue being that the hamburger --> back arrow animation wasn't working but showing perfectly the other way around. \nI fixed it by adding the required methods to show the back arrow into a ValueAnimator listener to wait until the animation is done before changing the actual ActionBarDrawerToggle.\n.

While you said the ActionBarDrawerToggle is independent from the Drawer, the method responsible for it to turn over is not. (onDrawerSlide)\nAt the time, I was looking to keep the toggle not animated while drawing the slider but animate it when necessary. (Simillar to the Play Store) It looks like the Drawer icon should not animate when the Drawer is sliding above it. (I may be wrong)\nBy checking in DrawerBuilder.java here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1368\nif the .withActionBarDrawerToggleAnimated is set to false, no matter what I set to onDrawerSlide, it will always return a value of 0. (And thus the drawer toggle not turning as wanted)\nI tried to create a temporary ActionBarToggle that could replicate the animation. Whilst I was able to create an beginning animation, without access to the Drawer listener, The back arrow can't do anything.\nI understand if you don't see this as important as it is not much of a detail.\n. @mikepenz I do provide a Toolbar when I'm creating the drawer which is why I can get the ActionBarDrawerToggle. If you don't mind, here's the code responsible for turning the arrow:\n```\npublic void showBackToolbarArrow(boolean enabled) {\nfinal ActionBarDrawerToggle toggle = mDrawer.getActionBarDrawerToggle();\nValueAnimator valueAnimator;\n\nif (enabled) {\n    valueAnimator = ValueAnimator.ofFloat(0, 1);\n    mDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED);\n\n    valueAnimator.addListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {\n        @Override\n        public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {\n            super.onAnimationEnd(animation);\n            if (getSupportActionBar() != null) {\n                toggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(false);\n                getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n} else {\n    valueAnimator = ValueAnimator.ofFloat(1, 0);\n    mDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED);\n\n    if (getSupportActionBar() != null) {\n        getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(false);\n        toggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(true);\n    }\n}\n\n// Play the hamburger icon/back arrow animation based on the ValueAnimator.ofFloat.\nvalueAnimator.addUpdateListener(new ValueAnimator.AnimatorUpdateListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onAnimationUpdate(ValueAnimator animation) {\n        float animationOffset = (float) animation.getAnimatedValue();\n        toggle.onDrawerSlide(mDrawer.getDrawerLayout(), animationOffset);\n    }\n});\nvalueAnimator.setDuration(400);\nvalueAnimator.setInterpolator(new AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator());\nvalueAnimator.start();\n\n}\n```\nIf I enable .withActionBarDrawerToggleAnimated, toggle.onDrawerSlide will work since the super call will return the correct offset value. Now as I said earlier, unless I somehow create a temporary ActionBarDrawerToggle, I won't be able to call toggle.onDrawerSlide if .withActionBarDrawerToggleAnimated is disabled. I could use the onDrawerListener but looks like it'll end up like a pretty mess.\nOne solution I have thought up would be perhaps to change the mAnimateActionBarDrawerToggle at will so we can animate the ActionBarDrawerToggle when we want. If it's not possible, I will create an ActionBarDrawerToggle manually and set it at the Drawer creation. That said, it could be more convenient if the option would be directly from within the library.\nThanks for the help!\n. @mikepenz I do provide a Toolbar when I'm creating the drawer which is why I can get the ActionBarDrawerToggle.

    "androideveloper": "And is there a way to disable Profile click in Minidrawer?\n. @mikepenz Awesome work! Super fast! Thanks a lot! I have some suggestions, will write them later. And one other issue with profile click.\nI have set .withSelectionListEnabledForSingleProfile(false) in AccountHeader but clicking on profile in MiniDrawer opens selection list with only 1 profile, but I don't want to show selection list at all ((I want to just crossfade view, not show account selection list, because I have only one account in the list)).\nThere are 2 solutions for this.\n1). Providing custom profile click in MiniDrawer \nNow I have found the way to do it, just setting adapter onclick listener\n// click listener\n        miniResult.getDrawerAdapter().setOnClickListener(new BaseDrawerAdapter.OnClickListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View v, int position, IDrawerItem item) {\n                Drawer mDrawer = miniResult.getDrawer();\n                int type = miniResult.getMiniDrawerType(item);\n                if (type == MiniDrawer.ITEM) {\n                    //fire the onClickListener also if the specific drawerItem is not Selectable\n                    if (item.isSelectable()) {\n                        mDrawer.setSelection(item, true);\n                    } else if (mDrawer.getOnDrawerItemClickListener() != null) {\n                        //get the original `DrawerItem` from the Drawer as this one will contain all information\n                        mDrawer.getOnDrawerItemClickListener().onItemClick(v, position, mDrawer.getDrawerItem(item.getIdentifier()));\n                    }\n                } else if (type == MiniDrawer.PROFILE) {\n                    if (crossFader != null) {\n                        crossFader.crossFade();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        });\nBut this seems to be just a hack, just copied full click listener, but I needed only Profile case.\n2). Fix the issue here\nelse if (type == PROFILE) {\n                    if (mAccountHeader != null && !mAccountHeader.isSelectionListShown()) {\n                        mAccountHeader.toggleSelectionList(v.getContext());\n                    }\n                    if (mCrossFader != null) {\n                        mCrossFader.crossfade();\n                    }\n                }\nConsider the case .withSelectionListEnabledForSingleProfile(false).\nBut providing both solutions will be great! \n. @mikepenz This method just disables click. What I suggested is custom click. I want to just crossfade views on prfile click\n. @mikepenz ok, great!\n. @mikepenz will try after version is released, thanks\n. @mikepenz Ok, I just copied the issue there. Library will be more flexible with this. \nIt seems that changes should be done here\njava\n  @Override\n    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {\n        return mCanSlide && super.onTouchEvent(ev);\n    }\nBased on touch region swipe should be enabled or disabled\n. I have mentioned that I am calling miniResult.createItems().\nNow I have added result.setSelection(0); and it seems that selection now works.\nBut it seems that after selection, minidrawer drops click listener that was set initially?\n. I have set custom click listener on minidrawer this way\nminiResult.getDrawerAdapter().setOnClickListener() //// (NOTE that this is my own solution for custom click,since library api for custom click isn't released yet)\nAnd after calling \nresult.setItems(drawerItems);\nminiResult.createItems();\nresult.setSelection(0);\nminidrawer default click listener called instead of my custom click listener\n. May be this will not happen with custom click provided by you?\n. @mikepenz it works! Thanks ;)\n. @mikepenz it works! Thanks ;)\n. Hi, Mike. Should i create issue there?\n. Yeah, i understand that. But my question is the following: \nmMiniDrawer.withCrossFader(new CrossfadeWrapper(mCrossFader));\nWe have to create and use CrossfadeWrapper. My question is can this class be part of this library? Or can architecture be changed so i can use\nmMiniDrawer.withCrossFader(mCrossFader);\n. Hi @mikepenz . Thanks. This fixed minidrawer selection, but there are 2 issues left now:\n1. When you double click (or fast click) on MiniDrawer item, Minidrawer selection doesn't dissapear (cause you fixed it now), but when you open full drawer with swipe, selection is gone.\n2. I have two pages that use Minidrawer(one with account header and second without header). When I open second page, two rows are selected at the same time! And also some padding in opened state appeared in this case. I will post this case more detailed as a new issue\n. @mikepenz Thanks, these cases are fixed. But before update to 5.0 library was more stable..When I was randomly selecting items in MiniDrawer, it was faster than now (I see some lags now). Also while random selecting items, I meet the case when no item is become selected..\n. @mikepenz I have a question regarding .withDisplayBelowStatusBar(). It seems that you changed the meaning of this function since 5.0 update (Do the right opposite). Is the doc right \"Sets that the slider of this Drawer should be displayed below the statusBar even with a translucentStatusBar\" ? Cause I understand, if the doc is right, I should set this to \"true\" (and padding will not be added). But on the practice \"false\" works for me. Please, provide some details on this\n. @mikepenz ok, thanks. So \"this method will remove the padding on top if set to true\" but in your previous comment you said \".withDisplayBelowStatusBar(false)\".  So which one is right to remove top padding from recyclerview?  (\" false\" works for me)\nOk, I see animation, but it also lags while fast clicking, on my nexus devices( Ok, I will post video from sample\n. Here is video\nhttps://youtu.be/lFOYMlTQWxE?t=6s\n. Ah..Beta version has the drawer..will be public later :)))\n. ",

I tried to find a method to block drawer but the only method that can help me is to put and if statement inside position click listener and notice user (Snask or Toast) he can't user there part of app without login.

Hi, onBtn() is for launching a fragment. In my activity layout, there is a button with id R.id.btn, when click it, this method will be called. (Is this different from how you launching a fragment?)\nThe onBackStackChanged should be called, check if you have called \"addToBackStack\" when launch a fragment, and your Fragment(android.app.Fragment or android.support.v4.Fragment) should fit with its FragmentManager (getFragmentManager() or getSupportFragmentManager())\nCan you give some codes? Maybe I didn't well understand your problem.\n. The drawer icon now is set by OnBackStackChangedListener.onBackStackChanged method.\nMake sure this method is called when your backstack changed.\nBut you use different FragmentManagers in the above codes. You should always use the same FragmentManager.\n. Hi, you can use withSwitchEnabled/withToggleEnabled instead.\n. ",

    "sinystr": "Thank you! But what do you mean by changing background?\n. ",
    "MFlisar": "Sure\n\n. I could see following behaviuor: rotating the device moves the selection down by one... And this is done on every turn.\nI'm remembering it as I save it beyond application lifecycle - whenever the app is restarted I use my manually saved idenetifier to restore the last known position...\nAnd the header should be irrelevant as long as I use the ID functions, shouldn't it? I have on by the way.  But I'm not working with positions, I just use them to notify the recycler view adapter...\n. I add/remove items and I do that asynchronous. Therefore I use the id. I save the last selected id in my preferences as well, as I said, I want to restore the last position on every app start again not only between an activity lifecycle...\n. Yes I am. I just updated an old version from 3.XX to the last version and I always needed IDs for being on the save side... I define all my ids like final static int ID PROFILES = 1; and use these constants then...\nMy workaround is working... Even if the ids would change (what they don't do), they don't change in the function I posted. I don't think it would solve the problem then to read the current selected identifier, delete the menu entry and set the selected identifier...\nAnd I'll use the update method to selectively update menu items in the future, thanks for the hint\n. I just saw that in the builder you save a selected position and a selected identifier... Didn't check that in detail as I'm not at home, but maybe the selected position should be decreased in the delete function if the deleted position is smaller than the currently selected position...\n. I just checked it, I use ID based functions only. But nevertheless, mixing them should not make a problem...\nBut I see following:\n- mDrawer.getCurrentSelection get's the ID based on the selected position\n- mDrawer.setSelection set's the selected position!\nSo I assume, deleting an item should update the drawers selected position accordingly... As whenever I use mDrawer.setSelection internally the position is saved not the position independent id...\n. Correct, that's why my workaround works! If I don't set the old identifier with \nsetSelection again the drawer will internally have saved the OLD position. After calling setSelection it will see \"oh, this id is on a new position, because an item on a smaller index was deleted\" and will correct the internal position.\nBut this should happen in the removeItem function of the RecyclerView...\nExample:\n- setSelection(1) will set index 10 as selected\n- removeItem(2) => drawer will see, item with id 2 is at position 2, so it removes the IDrawerItem at position 2. This should lead to update the selected position to 9, as position 2 is smaller than the selected position, so the selected position should be set to 10 - 1. But this is the missing part...\n- setSelection(1) again, will correct everything, as it will look up the position of id 1, which is now 9\nHope that's explaining it good enough now?\n.

The solution probably explains the problem a little better\n``` java\n    mAccountHeader = new AccountHeaderBuilder()\n        .withActivity(this)\n        .withCompactStyle(true)\n        .withProfileImagesClickable(false)\n        .withSelectionListEnabledForSingleProfile(false)\n        .withHeaderBackground(header)\n        .withOnAccountHeaderListener(new AccountHeader.OnAccountHeaderListener() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onProfileChanged(View view, IProfile profile, boolean current) {\n                L.d(MainActivity.class, \"Profile: \" + profile.getName() + \" | \" + profile.getEmail() + \" | \" + current);\n            // if it was a long press, restore previous selection and ignore click event\n            if (mAccountClickIsLongPress)\n            {\n                mAccountClickIsLongPress = false;\n                mAccountHeader.setActiveProfile(mSelectionBeforeLongPress);\n                return true;\n\n            }\n\n            // handle header click...\n\n            return true;\n        }\n    })\n    .addProfiles(profiles.toArray(new IProfile[profiles.size()]))\n    .withSavedInstance(savedInstanceState)\n    .build();\n\n```\nAnd my create profile function:\n``` java\n    private ProfileDrawerItem createProfileDrawerItem(Pair source, int index)\n    {\n        String name = getString(source.first.getNameRes());\n        String extra = source.second;\n    ProfileDrawerItem item = new ProfileDrawerItem()\n            .withIdentifier(ID_PROFILE_LOCAL + index + 1)\n            .withName(name)\n            .withNameShown(true)\n            .withIcon(source.first.getIconRes());\n    if (extra != null)\n        item.withEmail(extra);\n\n    item.withPostOnBindViewListener(new OnPostBindViewListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onBindView(final IDrawerItem drawerItem, View view) {\n\n            L.d(this, \"onBind: \" + drawerItem.getIdentifier());\n\n            final GestureDetectorCompat mDetector = new GestureDetectorCompat(getApplicationContext(), new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {\n\n                @Override\n                public void onLongPress(MotionEvent e) {\n                    mSelectionBeforeLongPress = mAccountHeader.getActiveProfile().getIdentifier();\n                    mAccountClickIsLongPress = true;\n                    Toast.makeText(getThis(), \"LONG PRESS\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                }\n            });\n            view.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {\n                @Override\n                public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {\n                    return mDetector.onTouchEvent(event);\n                }\n            });\n\n        }\n    });\n\n    return item;\n}\n\n```\nI think, there's probably a better way to do it?\n. Perfect. Library is constantly improved, sometimes I forget to upgrade before posting and recheck for new features.\nThis works without side effects, my solution had some side effects...\n. Even better :-). The fast improvement is probably an austrian bonus, as I'm from there as well ;-)\n. :-)\n. I found an additional problem with that:\nmDrawer.getCurrentSelection() mixes profiles and drawer items (depending on what is currently shown)... Probably by design, but somehow this was really unexpected for me... \nCurrently, I have to do following to add a profile dynamically:\n- show selection list\n- add profile by clicking an entry in it\n- selection list will hide automatically and I'll show a dialog\n- ... I do whatever is necessary to add a profile...\n- call handleProfileChanged which will check mDrawer.getCurrentSelection()\n-  mAccountHeader.toggleSelectionList(this); AFTERWARDS (otherwise mDrawer.getCurrentSelection() in the previous point won't work as expected) to reshow the selection list\n. I show a drawer with accounts in it and an \"add account\" button at the bottom. I want to allow to remove accounts by long pressing an account and to add accounts by pressing the add button. I don't want the drawer to change while adding/removing accounts as it looks better. When adding an account I select it automatically and update the view behind the opened drawer and load the new accounts data, this update will check the current selection of the drawer which only works if the drawer does not show the selection list. Could be solved by remembering the current selection outside of the drawer though but that seems like doing one thing twice.\nI have a working solution now, but the above mentioned problems have to be handled manually...\nBtw, you offer a mAccountHeader.getActiveProfile() getter, so this let's me assume mDrawer.getCurrentSelection() should not change when showing headers.. Still, I understand the problem, maybe it's possible to add a getActiveDrawerItem() or similar to the drawer, that would solve the mDrawer.getCurrentSelection() problem...\n. Thanks. I was looking for that in the DrawerBuilder...\n. For me, I can only get this working if I manually add a padding to my toolbar afterwards... So that it is moved under the statusbar, otherwise the toolbar is overlapped by the statusbar\n. So this is \"by design\"... I thought so anyway, but I did not see where you set the margin for the toolbar until now\n. Maybe you can answer follwing question as well:\nI now use it the way you suggest, but have a small problem:\n- I set the statusbar background to transparent\n- I have following two layouts in my activity\n```\n  \n\n\n  ```\nI theme my activity like this:\nactivity.getSupportActionBar().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(getTranslucentToolbarColor()));\nstatusBarBackground.setBackgroundColor(getTranslucentToolbarColor());\nThe problem is, that the color of the toolbar differs from the color of the status bar. I tried to directly color the ActionBar, but this has the same effect... Directly coloring the Toolbar does not work... I get a visible cut between the status bar and the toolbar, although it's only hard to see, but it's there...\nAny idea why this happens? When I don't use your library and use the fitsSystemWindows flags in the layout and remove the statusBarBackground view, the toolbar stretches and the statusbar does colorise with a slight gradient and no cut...\n. Nevermind... Had the problem the last days and as soon as I ask I saw the problem myself...\nThe elevation is causing this...\nStill, the only solution I see now is setting it to 0dp as setting the elevation of the statusBarBackground to 4dp does not solve the problem...\nOr to remove the background of the toolbar and make the statusBarBackground as big as the toolbar + statusbar and set it's background only... this will work as well\n. Wouldn't it make sense to add a withOnArrowClickListener, withExpandOnArrowClickOnly or similar to the ExpandableDrawerItem? Seems like a valid feature that may be used more often...\n. Thanks\n. I'll check that... But the thing with the padding seems to be wrong, isn't it? We talked about that already once and back then, you said, you set the padding in the recycler view (https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1368).\nI checked the code and the current version still does this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java#L1616\n. .withSystemUIHidden(true) solves it, but then I would have to check, if the device has hardware buttons or software buttons and device rotation myself to set withSystemUIHidden correctly... I thought, the lines (1610 - 1616) in https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/DrawerBuilder.java should handle this check...\nScreenshot with non sticky header:\n\n. Actually, the drawer is fullscreen, my app as well... Removing withFullscreen solves the problem.\nStill, I don't get the reason for withFullscreen then...\n. I'm using the current develop branch.\nI tried withSelectWithItemUpdate because of this issue: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/issues/1180\nI'm calling the themeDrawerItem(IDrawerItem item) before showing anything, this is only called when I setup the drawer builder. The mDrawerLeft.setSelection(selectedId, false); is called from the main thread as well.\nAgain, selection works perfectly fine (everything but the icon tinting => selector and text tinting work fine)\n. Thanks, that's sounds great. I'll try that.. Has a view side effects (things like full screen have to be done manually afterwards), but fulfills my needs. I can't use the MaterializeBuilder for this feature anymore, can I?. The MaterializeBuilder needs a container view though and if I want to avoid the detach/attach actions, I can't use it. But it's no problem though. Could you provide a setup method for this? Something like\n.withBezelMask(int||drawable)\n.withBezelShadow(boolean)\n\nIn the past I often used the place to show a single pseudo profile with my app icon and there I always removed the mask and shadow.

The problem is not this!\nAll work fine if I do not use \"withRootView\" (also without CoordinatorLayout)...\nThis problem is with margin.\n. I think that the rootView will need to design a tablet and smartphone layouts. Or not?\n. If I addandroid:layout_marginTop=\"32dp\"`\nin FrameLayout (that make as rootView), all work :)\n. This is the result:\nWITH MARGIN TOP:\n\nWITHOUT:\n\n. The best value are 31dp in Portrait and 22dp in landscape\n. Ok now it work but with this I cannot use CoordinatorLayout...however it's ok :) thanks\n. Ok, you are the best, all work.\nBut can I have the hamburger to arrow animation or not?\n. I solved the first problem (API 21) with this:\n```\npublic int getStatusBarHeight() {\n    int result = 0;\n    int resourceId = getResources().getIdentifier(\"status_bar_height\", \"dimen\", \"android\");\n    if (resourceId > 0) {\n        result = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(resourceId);\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\n```\nby setting the Support Toolbar padding by code like this:\nmToolbar.setPadding(0, getStatusBarHeight(), 0, 0);\n. I've see it but I try all combination for 2 days :( \nthis is my code:\n```\n        mDrawer = new DrawerBuilder()\n                .withActivity(this)\n                .withRootView(R.id.left_drawer)\n                .withToolbar(mToolbar)\n                .withDisplayBelowStatusBar(false)\n                .withActionBarDrawerToggle(true)\n                .withActionBarDrawerToggleAnimated(true)\n                .withSavedInstance(savedInstanceState)\n                .withOnDrawerNavigationListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerNavigationListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public boolean onNavigationClickListener(View clickedView) {\n                        // Gestione onBack\n                        onBackPressed();\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                })\n                .withOnDrawerListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onDrawerOpened(View drawerView) {\n                        isDrawerOpened = true;\n                    }\n                @Override\n                public void onDrawerClosed(View drawerView) {\n                    isDrawerOpened = false;\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void onDrawerSlide(View drawerView, float slideOffset) {\n\n                }\n            })\n            .addDrawerItems(\n                    new PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(\"CIAO\").withIdentifier(1)\n            )\n            .build();\n\n``\n.

I get your point, but that casting should be internally handled by the library then. Like I wrote above, you'll be assigning the item on the RecyclerView the id of the loaded menu item resource. If the loaded resource is of type Integer then there's no problem (the casting is done automatically) but to evaluate if a certain item has been tapped you'll be providing a Long as the identifier when the implementer actually provided the library with an Integer (the id of the menu resource item). It's kind of like providing apples and getting pears.. ",

Yes, two drawers, one activity.\nThe main drawer on the left, controlled by the ActionBar and gesture, and the one on the right, toggled only by a button.\nAnd indeed the Toolbar collapses only to leave TabLayout at sight :S\nPs: Locked with DrawerLayout :+1: \n. I'm sorry to hear that, but to be fair... It's way to specific, is normal that DrawerLayout doesn't contemplate the option. I think having the second one under the Status Bar will do more than fine :D \nI will consider to switch .build() to .append(result), I'm gessing having both in the same DrawerLayout its much more efficient, the problem is I would have to remove the LOCK on the DrawerLayout in order to be able to open the main with a gesture...\n...Which right now doesn't  seem so bad, but it also generates some random behavior:\nI set my LeftDrawer at my onCreate method, but my RightDrawer only if the user selects the option on the ActionBar, which results in:\n\nAnd can be corrected by the user by opening the Main Drawer (left) and making click on any Icon.\n\nOr programmatically, by not initializing the Second Drawer (right) on a button, but onCreate. Which might be computationally costly depending on what you are doing there :S\nI think I'll try to make the setup as light as posible and then use .append and onCreate for both Drawers.\n. Perfect, now I'm using:\nmFilterDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED, GravityCompat.END);`\nTo block the right one...  Though, I'm missing the possibility to add an OnDrawerListener to the Drawer after the creation in order to activate the gestures once opened and disable them at.\nI tried with almost successfully with:\nmFilterDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerItemClickListener() {\n    ...\n}\nBut as they are now sharing a common DrawerLayout things get messy... So I would just leave it like it is, maybe in the future you have time to add that as a feature (if it's even posible).\nI don't think it's necessary, as it's not a common \"use case\", but well... If you do I'll be using it :D\nMany thanks again for an outstanding library, everything is incredibly well thought.\nPs: I have a couple of extra questions, but I'm gonna do some research first in order to save you the extra hazle. And as they are not related to this one, it's probably better to isolate them for people to find in the future.\n. The problem with the onDrawerListener in my case it's the content, as I'm calling a function of the object I'm creating...\n...Wait, I just realise that might actually work, the drawer will be initialized but not opened, so the mFilterDrawer will be null at creation but not short after in response to a button click.\nMmmmmm still nothing, probably sleep deprivation kicking in, I'm using this code for the Right Drawer:\n```\nmFilterDrawer = new DrawerBuilder()\n                .withActivity(this)\n                .withDisplayBelowStatusBar(true)\n                .withCloseOnClick(false)\n                .addDrawerItems(\n                        mainSection,\n                        item1, item2, item3\n                        listSection,\n                        list1, list2, list3\n                )\n                .withOnDrawerListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onDrawerOpened(View drawerView) {\n                        Log.d(\"myApp\", \"testOpened\");\n                        mFilterDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(\n                                DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED);\n                    }\n                @Override\n                public void onDrawerClosed(View drawerView) {\n                    Log.d(\"myApp\", \"testClosed\");\n                    mFilterDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(\n                            DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED, GravityCompat.END);\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void onDrawerSlide(View drawerView, float slideOffset) { }\n            })\n            .withDrawerGravity(Gravity.END)\n            .append(mDrawer);\n\n// Locked after creation\nmFilterDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(\n                DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED, GravityCompat.END);\n```\nCuriously it never enters onDrawerOpened or onDrawerClosed, I though it will detect only gestures and then I tried to unlocked it onClick:\n```\nif(mFilterDrawer == null)\n                    setupFilterDrawer();\n            mFilterDrawer.openDrawer();\n\n            mFilterDrawer.getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(\n                    DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED);\n\n```\nBut still never reaches onDrawerClosed... Which is odd, as it should Log no mather what drawer is being opened/closed.\nSOLUTION: Being append instead of built seems to discard the OnDrawerListener of the appended one, as setting the same method on mDrawer does the job wonderfully. :+1: \nPs: I did mixed OnDrawerListener with OnDrawerItemClickListener... That explains a lot xD\nAbout the questions, the multi-selection of values... Which I have read already it's not supported. So as recommended changing color/background/etc will do.\nAnd well, I would like to change the right drawer width, but my tries were unsuccesful and it wasn't really necesary, I just though it would be cool xD\n. You sure know your code... It does, I don't know how I missed that.\nWell, probably because sometimes I mix \"height\" and \"width\" while programming, to many things to do at the same time, you should see half the code code commented in Spanish and half in English xD\nOnce again, thanks for everything, I guess I'll wait for v5.0.0 and in the meantime, close this Issue :D\n. Perfect, as soon as I start the filter development I'll make sure to check it out :+1: \nBy the way Mike, is there a way to scroll the drawer to a certain Item/Identifier??\nI'm using 3 expandable items which will contain X items each, and currently after expanding a list (depending on the position) the user have to scroll to see the content.. Which is not ideal :S\n. Great, thanks Mike.\nThat position I'm assuming corresponds with the item in the RecyclerView??\nBecause I have 3 expandable items in one of the drawers, the second expandable one might be the \"position 7\" if the first expandable is closed but the \"position 18\" if it's opened. I can calculate that position based on the items on the first item and so on, but well, it's not that fun xD\n.

Cool thanx. I also found another bug, probably, with mini drawer. I will post it as a separate issue. \n. i have downloaded it from the playstore.\nSo when we expecting the 5.0.0 version?\n. Can i use the SNAPSHOT? if yes, then can you provide me the gradle dependancy for the SNAPSHOT build(v5.0.0)?\n. cool!!\nthanx\n. The above case is working fine with the SNAPSHOT build.Thank you again.\n. Thanks a lot.It worked!!!!\n. ",

Found the cause of our little problem. I think. I needed to query the logged in user from the phones DB to get its name and email. This took a very short time, but it seems like it matters. Because if I don't query the users and automatically set up the drawer with dummy data, it works. So at the moment I set up the drawer 2 times. First time with dummy data, second time with real data.

i would gladly provide more information if you need it. @mikepenz i changed the last line from \"drawer.openDrawer();\" to \"crossfader.crossfade()\" but it's still not working - im still seeing the mini drawer and not the \"big drawer\".\ni also tried \"miniDrawer.getCrossFader().crossfade();\" - not working.\nmaybe i need to write this line somewhere else in the code?\n. @mikepenz not working :(\nit's definitely being called though (i added a log entry) but the \"big drawer\" remains closed\n. i (almost) found a solution!\nif i use \"crossFader.getCrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout().openPane()\", the drawer is opened.\nhowever, it is empty! only if i start dragging the drawer, the views inside it become visible.\nif after this line i add \"crossfader.crossfade\" it doesn't work at all - the drawer remains closed.\ni thought i could try to invoke a method like \"on touch event\" or \"on drag event\" but i cant get it to work...\nany thoughts?\n. > @or-dvir if you really need it, you could theoretically do it with the following code:\n\nSlidingPaneLayout.LayoutParams lp = (SlidingPaneLayout.LayoutParams) crossFader.getCrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout().getChildAt(0).getLayoutParams();\nlp.width = 0;\ncrossFader.getCrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout().getChildAt(0).setLayoutParams(lp);\nlp = (SlidingPaneLayout.LayoutParams) crossFader.getCrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout().getChildAt(1).getLayoutParams();\nlp.rightMargin = 0;\nlp.leftMargin = 0;\ncrossFader.getCrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout().getChildAt(1).setLayoutParams(lp);\n\nTHIS WORKS!\nTHANK YOU!\n. well... if its constraint layout it doesnt work.

noticed that the statusBar appears as it was supposed to, when I remove android:fitsSystemWindows=\"true\" from AppBarLayout. Nevertheless, even after this change in my layout code, the scrolling view behavior appears to be problematic as well, on a couple of fragments I use, based on RecyclerView. When I scroll upwards, I want to hide the Toolbar, as well as the statusBar, but since the upgrade to v5, the statusBar is always drawn onTop of the Toolbar, which almost disappears as we scroll upwards, except from the statusBar inset which is now taken into account. The problem resembles this stackoverflow question.\n. Seems impossible to figure out what's going on. There might be a problem in my styles definition as well... I do remember that managing the scrolling view behavior correctly with the new coordinator layout gave me quite a number of headaches back then, and I'd rather not have them back at this time during my project development... Probably I'll stick to v 4.6.4, until I find some time to deal with it again. Thanks anyway!\n. ",

And even if try to do runOnUiThread he still jumps. And only in deselect. select use notifyItemChanged too, but bug not reproduce for this method.\n2) I would like to override all the methods select and deselect , and call them directly in the UI thread. That was bad idea) But i found the issue))) \nsupport library release 23.2.0 and 23.2.1 its a real nightmare(( \n. Many many thanks for your help!

I expressed myself incorrectly, I only want some guidance.\n@mikepenz I was trying to follow this, where the right nav is under the status bar. How would Google go about doing that with a single DrawerLayout? It's merely a design issue, for which I don't want to overcomplicate. So you're saying it's not worth it?\n. Regarding the icon on the secondary items, great solution, it works perfectly!\nDoing what you said I managed to get the arrow in my custom ExpandableDrawerItem working. It now expands on click of the arrow and has animation. However, I can't make the item itself not expand on click. Even overriding the click listener, it still expands and collapses on click. Upon searching, this is something the FastAdapter does by itself (here). So there's no chance of overriding this behavior without changing the adapter?\n. Okay I managed to do it. But I'm not really sure if this solution brings any disadvantages despite working.

Hm... thanks for the tip. Managed to do it by passing the drawer to the item instead of the adapter. And then used the tag, like you said, to get the item in the ViewHolder.\nThank you very much!\n. I had to change that. I build the drawer without items and add them later.\n```\nleftDrawer = new DrawerBuilder()\n            .withActivity(this)\n            .withAccountHeader(accountHeader)\n            .withCloseOnClick(true)\n            .withSelectedItem(-1)\n            .build();\nleftDrawer.addItems(...);\n```\n. You can either make an abstract activity that implements the drawer and then make the other activities extend from that one or have one activity and use fragments.\n. You can either make an abstract activity that implements the drawer and then make the other activities extend from that one or have one activity and use fragments.\n. For extending you could do something like this:\n```\npublic abstract class BaseActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    protected Drawer drawer;\n@Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n    drawer = new DrawerBuilder()\n            .withActivity(this)\n            .addItems(...)\n            .build();\n}\n\n}\n```\nAnd then each activity extends the base activity:\n```\npublic class MainActivity extends BaseActivity {\n    @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    // you can access the drawer here because it was initialized in super\n}\n\n}\n```\nFor fragments you have one activity that uses the drawer and then the actual content is displayed on a fragment. For this option you better go check the Android documentation.\n. ",

As you can see from the screen, it seems the drawer starts from the beginning of the screen (now that there is no header it was clearer to me)\n\njava\n Drawer result = new DrawerBuilder()\n                .withActivity(this)\n                .withToolbar(toolbar)\n                .withSavedInstance(savedInstanceState)\n                .withDisplayBelowStatusBar(false)\n                .withTranslucentStatusBar(false)\n                .addDrawerItems(\n                        item1,\n                        new DividerDrawerItem(),\n                        item2,\n                        new SecondaryDrawerItem().withName(\"secondary item\")\n                )\n                .withOnDrawerItemClickListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerItemClickListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public boolean onItemClick(View view, int position, IDrawerItem drawerItem) {\n                        // do something with the clicked item :D\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                })\n                .build();\n. Ok, now it's a little bit better, but it's not fixed yet. In fact, the toolbar is still under the status bar while the drawer is ok:\n\n. the one you suggest in the README: com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:5.1.6@aar\n. I found that, if i use a custom layout for the drawer identical to yours, in which the flag fitsSystemWindows is set to false the problem is fixed but there is another one with the color of the status bar, as you can see from the screen. The code of the layout is the following (just edited the last line of file material_drawer.xml ):\nxml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:id=\"@+id/custom_drawer_layout\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:fitsSystemWindows=\"false\" />\n\n. Hurrah! Fixed it! I set the flag witTranslucentStatusBar(false) when creating the navigation drawer object. Well, it now works fine, but i can't understand why i have to use my custom drawer layout only to change that fitsSystemWindows line...Isn't there a way to set it manually at execution time? \nI'll try to provide you a small app, i don't have so much time right now, sorry...By the way, thanks for your help and availability :+1: :) ! Hope it will be useful for further releases\n. ",

At least in our current setup this is what we had to do. \n\n\nWe did not try that since it is not very easily reproducible - we have to go through the whole release cycle and run it through pre-release. It definitely crossed my mind but then we realized that we may not re\u2013initialize the drawer so much and the issue \"disappeared\".\n\n\nThe general problem is - there is probably a memory leak somewhere. People have complained about it before #1097, #1142. Maybe the memory leak happens with certain usages only. Again these it is hard to reproduce these crashes. We can only see then on the pre-release testing. In our own testing we could not reproduce it. Maybe someone here with a much older device would have better luck?\nDid you check/monitor for memory leaks? \nThanks.\n. @mikepenz, \n\n\nif you want the drawer to appear in other activities then you must to re-initialize it, no?

Glide AFAIU is for loading images from network. It is an overkill and perhaps even not the right tool for that. \nIf there are such issues with relatively not too big of resolutions, IMO it would make sense for the library to handle bitmap caching. I hope you'd consider implementing it. In the meantime, we will try caching the bitmap ourselves and see if that resolves this issue.\n. Glide AFAIU is for loading images from network.

Thanks!. I just tested\nIntent i = getIntent();\n            this.finish();\n            startActivity(i);\nwhich leads to exactly the same behavior. I did not check the recreate() source code but it is must be little different because when doing shared animations the recreate() works while the manual restart doesn't. In this case both methods to restart activity fail however.. Yes, that is what I was using but I also tested the\nIntent i = getIntent();\n            this.finish();\n            startActivity(i);\njust in case with exact same result. \nall the methods within the DrawerLayout require parameters passed and I am not sure what exactly would be the right ones.\nCan you give me a little more guidance with a snippet to check whether the layout is open and also to directly call the layout to open.\n. I did some more debugging and analyzing and it looks like the drawer is not displayed.

    "orcchg": "@mikepenz Thank You. I'm using 5.1.6 and checked MD works with cheesessquare application. I'm actually using fitsSystemWindows=\"true\" on Coordinator and AppBarLayout, and this works well in case MD is absent. Something in MD forces such top margin on my layout.\nOne can remove fitsSystemWindows=\"true\" from AppBarLayout still leaving it on CoordinatorLayout enabled, and this entails AppBarLayout to have top offset (24dp). One can scroll it vertically to collapse as usual and notice AppBarLayout's top border moves behind the translucent status bar. The CoordinatorLayout is in charge here.\nOn the other hand, omitting fitsSystemWindows=\"true\" in CoodinatorLayout itself makes statusbar completely opaque and static, AppBarLayout does no longer move behind it and has a top margin (24dp) at beginning.\nSo, when I try to add MD to my environment, I've exactly the same behaviour as described above - when CoordinatorLayout has no fitsSystemWindows=\"true\" attribute set. I guess something in MD implementation may intercept such CoodrinatorLayout's responsibilities ?\n. I've figured out that the issue is caused with the following conditions. I have a the following XML layout for my Activity:\n```\nDrawerLayout>\n<CoordinatorLayout> ... content of Activity ... </CoordinatorLayout>\n\n<FrameLayout /> - container for fragment\n\n/DrawerLayout>\n```\nNote the FrameLayout which serves as a container for a fragment I add programmatically. In onCreate() of this fragment I actually build the Material Drawer (here I invoke withActivity(getActivity()). This actually causes the issue. When I create MD directly in the hosting Activity, everything is OK.\nThis is similar to StackOverflow discussion.\nCould You please advice something? Could we use MD within a programmatically added fragments? Thank You!\n. @mikepenz The issue is caused with a FrameLayout which acts as a root of the rest layout of the Activity. I have a BaseActivity class with overriden setContentView() method, which sets pre-defined layout which looks like:\n\"<_FrameLayout>\n```\n Activity-specific layout is passed here \n\n```\n<_/FrameLayout>\"\nMy Activity has standard layout (with Coordinator + AppBar + CollapsingToolbar etc, as usual), but then it's view hierarchy is entirely added into wrapping root FrameLayout, which also has some component common to all Activities inheriting BaseActivity. But such 'wrapping' causes the issue with status bar transparency. When I do not wrap - everything is okay. But I have to provide common components to each Activity. I'm investigating the solution.\nThank You. No issue with your MD.\n. ",

    "toastking42": "Hi Mike,\nthanks for the swift reply!\nI've cloned your repository and added \n.withProfileImagesVisible(false)\nafter line 78 of your MiniDrawerActivity.java.\nIn this case, the setting seems to be ignored right from the beginning, because in the MiniDrawer, the profile image is shown at the top. In the expanded drawer, no profile pictures are visible. That doesn't seem right either?\nThe overdrawing of DrawerItems like I described in my previous post seems to be happening because when I initially add the drawer and MiniDrawer, no accounts are associated with them, they are only added after an asynchronous task has finished.\nYou can reproduce my exact problem by first adding the abovementioned code after line 78, then commenting out lines 80 to 90 (where the profiles are added) and moving these lines to the end of the onCreate() method, i.e. inserting it after:\njava\ncrossFader.getCrossFadeSlidingPaneLayout().setShadowResourceLeft(R.drawable.material_drawer_shadow_left);\nThen start the Activity and choose another account in your drawer's device chooser. The first item will be hidden by a profile image.\n. Thanks Mike.\nSince ideally I'd need the drawer to function correctly now, is there any quick fix in my code that I could use until the new version is released? For example, reinitializing the drawer in some way.\nPS: The overdrawing issue can be reproduced by following (all of) the steps I described in the post above. It's definitely there.\nPPS: I 'fixed' the overdrawing issue by adding an empty profile while initially creating the AccountHeader. The problem seems to occur only when no accounts are given to the AccountHeader upon creation (as described above, I added the profiles later on). This 'fix' now makes the first MiniDrawer item have a large marginTop (where the icon would normally be). That looks kind of weird since I would expect it to be at the top of the drawer when .withProfileImagesVisible(false) has been set. But still, it's better than not being able to see the first item at all after switching the account.\n. It doesn't. If the user selects an item in the full expanded drawer in the UI, the MiniDrawer ignores that event. At the moment I'm not disabling any items, it's just regular usage of the Drawer/MiniDrawer like in the example.\nI also just realized that the MiniDrawer is ignoring drawer.setSelection(); completely. It's only visible in the full drawer.\n. My mistake :) I didn't realize that I have to set the selection for both of the drawer, it works when I write it like this:\njava\n        miniDrawer.setSelection(1L);\n        drawer.setSelection(1L, false);\nThat's perfectly fine for me (although it's a bit weird to be honest).\nIs there any way for me to disable both the expanded as well as the mini drawer (i.e. all items in them) for a period of time? I don't want the user to click menu items while an asynchronous request is runnning.\nThanks for your help by the way :)\n.

Hi @mikepenz , unfortunately, it doesn't work. It doesn't matter if I return true or false in onProfileChanged, the header will always switch to the account the user has selected. Is this a bug?\nJust in case there has been a fix for that, I'm currently using v5.2.6.\nYour code seems to ignore what onProfileChanged returns:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/materialdrawer/AccountHeader.java#L198\n.

After that top paddings should also be updated from 0  = > status bar height, but they were not.\nThe correct method should look like this:\n``` java\n        public static void handleHeaderView(DrawerBuilder drawer) {\n        //use the AccountHeader if set\n        if (drawer.mAccountHeader != null) {\n            if (drawer.mAccountHeaderSticky) {\n                drawer.mStickyHeaderView = drawer.mAccountHeader.getView();\n            } else {\n                drawer.mHeaderView = drawer.mAccountHeader.getView();\n                drawer.mHeaderDivider = drawer.mAccountHeader.mAccountHeaderBuilder.mDividerBelowHeader;\n                drawer.mHeaderPadding = drawer.mAccountHeader.mAccountHeaderBuilder.mPaddingBelowHeader;\n            }\n        }\n    //sticky header view\n    if (drawer.mStickyHeaderView != null) {\n        //add the sticky footer view and align it to the bottom\n        RelativeLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n        layoutParams.addRule(RelativeLayout.ALIGN_PARENT_TOP, 1);\n        drawer.mStickyHeaderView.setId(R.id.material_drawer_sticky_header);\n        drawer.mSliderLayout.addView(drawer.mStickyHeaderView, 0, layoutParams);\n\n        //now align the recyclerView below the stickyFooterView ;)\n        RelativeLayout.LayoutParams layoutParamsListView = (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams) drawer.mRecyclerView.getLayoutParams();\n        layoutParamsListView.addRule(RelativeLayout.BELOW, R.id.material_drawer_sticky_header);\n        drawer.mRecyclerView.setLayoutParams(layoutParamsListView);\n\n        //set a background color or the elevation will not work\n        drawer.mStickyHeaderView.setBackgroundColor(UIUtils.getThemeColorFromAttrOrRes(drawer.mActivity, R.attr.material_drawer_background, R.color.material_drawer_background));\n\n        // ==================FIXED===========================\n        // ==================================================\n        // top padding of sticky header should be set to the current padding of recycler view\n        drawer.mStickyHeaderView.setPadding(0, drawer.mRecyclerView.getPaddingTop(), 0, 0);\n\n        if (drawer.mStickyHeaderShadow) {\n            //add a shadow\n            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 21) {\n                drawer.mStickyHeaderView.setElevation(UIUtils.convertDpToPixel(4, drawer.mActivity));\n            } else {\n                View view = new View(drawer.mActivity);\n                view.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.material_drawer_shadow_bottom);\n                drawer.mSliderLayout.addView(view, RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, (int) UIUtils.convertDpToPixel(4, drawer.mActivity));\n                //now align the shadow below the stickyHeader ;)\n                RelativeLayout.LayoutParams lps = (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams) view.getLayoutParams();\n                lps.addRule(RelativeLayout.BELOW, R.id.material_drawer_sticky_header);\n                view.setLayoutParams(lps);\n            }\n        }\n\n        //remove the padding of the recyclerView again we have the header on top of it\n        drawer.mRecyclerView.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);\n    }\n\n    // set the header (do this before the setAdapter because some devices will crash else\n    if (drawer.mHeaderView != null) {\n        if (drawer.mRecyclerView == null) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"can't use a headerView without a recyclerView\");\n        }\n\n        if (drawer.mHeaderPadding) {\n            drawer.getHeaderAdapter().add(new ContainerDrawerItem().withView(drawer.mHeaderView).withHeight(drawer.mHeiderHeight).withDivider(drawer.mHeaderDivider).withViewPosition(ContainerDrawerItem.Position.TOP));\n        } else {\n            drawer.getHeaderAdapter().add(new ContainerDrawerItem().withView(drawer.mHeaderView).withHeight(drawer.mHeiderHeight).withDivider(drawer.mHeaderDivider).withViewPosition(ContainerDrawerItem.Position.NONE));\n        }\n        //set the padding on the top to 0\n        // ==================FIXED===========================\n        // ==================================================\n        // changed top padding from 0 to drawer.mRecyclerView.getPaddingTop(), basicaly below line should be all removed\n        drawer.mRecyclerView.setPadding(drawer.mRecyclerView.getPaddingLeft(), drawer.mRecyclerView.getPaddingTop(), drawer.mRecyclerView.getPaddingRight(), drawer.mRecyclerView.getPaddingBottom());\n    }\n}\n\n```\n.

    "roher-roher": "Thanks!\n. Well, that's bad news. The point is that I can't find anything about this issue in Google, so looks like I'm the only one experiencing this (together with the users of my app of course).\nAnyway, thanks for the answer.\n. Yes, I will try. If it will be the same, I will post an issue to Crosswalk.\n. Hi!\nSurprisingly, but the issue occurs only with MaterialDrawer.\nAttached archives with 2 apks and Android Studio projects - one using DrawerLayout, the other using MaterialDrawer:\nDrawerLayout.zip\nMaterialDrawer.zip\nTestcases are the following:\nTC1:\n1. Kill the app from the System Settings if it was running before;\n2. Launch the app;\n3. Try opening navigation drawer by swiping from the left immediately, before splash screen is gone and \"Hello world!\" text is displayed.\nER: Navigation drawer has opened and visible.\nAR for DrawerLayout: = ER, drawer has opened successfully and visible.\nAR for MaterialDrawer: = ER, drawer has opened successfully and visible.\nTC2:\n1. Launch the app;\n2. Wait till the splash screen is gone and \"Hello world!\" text is displayed;\n3. Try opening navigation drawer by swiping from the left.\nER: Navigation drawer has opened and visible.\nAR for DrawerLayout: = ER, drawer has opened successfully and visible.\nAR for MaterialDrawer: drawer has opened invisibly and is shown only if you click on the area where it should be.\nSo, as you can see, before CrossWalk WebView is initialized and shown (splash screen is displayed during initializing), both implementations work correct. But as soon as WebView is shown, only DrawerLayout works.\n. Thanks!\nSo, it looks like there is no way to make my app truly fullscreen if I use Drawer + Crosswalk?\n. Hmm, but I've just noticed that I don't use this code:\njava\nif (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {\n   drawerLayout.setFitsSystemWindows(false);\n}\nin the DrawerLayout variant. And it works well together with full-screen mode.\nI've also tried ScrimInsetsFrameLayout with MaterialDrawer and without that code, and it has exactly the same behaviour :-(\n. @mikepenz, even when I completely remove all fullscreen-related stuff, the drawer is still drawn behind the webview:\nMainActivity.txt\n\n. Done the same with DrawerLayout - everything works like a charm:\nMainActivity.txt\n\n. I'm using Android 6.0.1, the device is Samsung Galaxy Note 4.\n. Hi @mikepenz!\nAny thoughts?\n. Your code and mine are absolutely the same (if not taking comments into account). I don't believe in miracles, but I've tried your code, and of course the issue has reproduced.\n. But why does it work good with the standard DrawerLayout? :)\nAnd we don't touch fitsSystemWindow in this last version.\n. I am ready to provide any help if I can. Maybe try to download source code of MaterialDrawer and debug? But I don't know what to search :(\n. @mikepenz, thanks for the idea but it didn't help - the drawer is still drawn behind the webview, the only change is that it's top edge is now below the notification bar.\n. Me too :/ Maybe you set some specific flags during inflating the RecyclerView?\nJFI: I also tried drawer.getDrawerLayout().bringToFront() and it didn't help.\n. Hi @mikepenz! I found out a very interesting thing - this is the line of code that makes everything work as needed in the classic DrawerLayout example:\nlvDrawer.setAdapter(new ArrayAdapter<String>(this,\n                android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, new String[]{\"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\"}));\nHow did I come up to it:\nI wanted to find out what exactly in your library makes the drawer be drawn behind the WebView and started removing lines one by one from the setupDrawer() method, and finally ended up with removing the whole method completely. The drawer still opened behind the WebView...\nThen I though:\n\nIf your library is not forcing the drawer to be behind the WebView, as I removed setup of MaterialDrawer completely, then something in the classic DrawerLayout code is forcing it to be in front of the WebView.\n\nSo I began, again line by line, transforming the code to the classic example.

Note this is only the case when the draw is fully expanded. When it is a mini drawer all the clicks work all the time\n. This also happens when the drawer icon is clicked. Sometimes it doesn't register and it must be clicked twice.\n. Sorry for all the comments. \nAs for reproducing it use your demo Material Drawer app. It has the same issues with the CrossFadeDrawerLayout.\n. @mikepenz \nThis may be an issue I should have posted in the CrossfadeDrawerLayout. I have not looked a lot into your code but I think its an issue with the drawer closing. \nIf the crossfade drawer is expanded it registers a touch event as if you were sliding the drawer so the OnItemClick is never triggered. You have to play with it a bit but basically whatever is capturing the drawer to slide back to a compact state is taking control over an OnItemClick event.\n. I'll dive into your code and trying playing with it over the next week\n. ",

    "BobOtike": "Okay, seems that I have misinterpreted the reason for the closing. Updating the parent causes it, even if using notifyAdapterItemChanged() since that calls through to notifyAdapterItemRangeChange(), which always closes the item if it is expanded. Is there any way to prevent that? \n. Thanks for your response. The thing is, I want to both update the parent and one of its subItems at the same time. \nI see that the expanded state is properly being restored since my isExpanded() will still return true after the update, but because of the ItemAnimator this leads to a consecutive fading out and in of the subItem, which is not really desirable as it looks like the item is blinking. One way to prevent that is of course to set the animator to null, but than I lose all the fancy animations which is also not desirable. Everything I've tried to prevent that blinking like setting the animator to null before the update and reinstating it afterwards also failed. Any idea how to overcome this? \n. Activating stableIds, which is was providing before anyways, seems to have fixed the blinking issue. \nThanks a lot for your quick responses, cheers mate! \n. It appears so. While the blinking of the subItem was gone just because of stableIds, I still had some blinking of the parent's name/description when only switching its icon. In this case I now use the approach suggested in your last link and update the view myself without involving the adapter, and at first glance it works like a charme. \n. ",

I don't know why I can't figure it out, it's like shooting blanks, I change a setting that's supposed to change the text color or the background, but nothing changes(example, although it's the case here as well).\nAnother example: \nXML\n<android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n        android:id=\"@+id/toolbar\"\n        android:minHeight=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n        android:background=\"#1ab394\"\n        android:textColor=\"@color/white\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\">\n    </android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar>\ntextColor is White, but the text is still black\n. Tried that, but it's just as in the first picture, only that now, the 3 lines are in black instead of white.\nEven with  one of the MaterialDrawer themes as base. -> @style/MaterialDrawerTheme.Light\n@style/MaterialDrawerTheme.Light.TranslucentStatus produces the second picture (with https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sample_dark_toolbar.xml#L13 now just that the 3 lines are black and the text is white)\n. Even if I change everything to EXACTLY as it is in the Android-Ionics project, the toolbar still overlaps with the statusbar, although:\nThe Text(+ the three lines) are in white, but now the options menu is in the dark style.\nBUT:\nI noticed, that when I interact with the drawer in any way, that isn't opening it with the three lines, by swiping left to right or clicking on the profile image, but by something like clicking on an item or opening the account arrow, the status bar goes to where it should be, when I restart the app or the activity it merges with the statusbar again.\nI'm on a Galaxy S3 running Android 6.0.1\n.

    "adriamt": "Yes is what I supose but I'm not able to find where :S\nThanks btw for all your help.\nEDIT:\nOn the activity where I create the Drawer I'm doing this:\nCheckboxDrawerItem tmpSecondaryItem = new CheckboxDrawerItem(){\n                            @Override\n                            public void onPostBindView (IDrawerItem drawerItem, View view) {\nCould be this the cause ?\n. Looking at what you pushed, Ii complaints about this:\n@Override\n    public int getType() {\n        return R.layout.material_drawer_item_checkbox;\n    }\nBecause it expects an id resource, not a layout.\n. Yes, I thought you just missed it ;)\nFinally I got it working.\nThanks you verymuch !!!\n. ",
    "OneManStudioDotSe": "My setup is very simple: One activity inside which I load all the fragments by using a FrameLayout as a container. To test things, I use two fragments, one with a simple toolbar (FragmentA) and another fragment with a CollapsingToolbarLayout and a Toolbar inside it (FragmentB).\nWhat should happen is that the drawer is accessible and update-able from both fragments when we switch from one to the other, right?\nWhen I first try to load FragmentB, there are 2 toolbars, one simple one and another within a CollapsingToolbarLayout underneath. \nThis is the code for the fragment:\n```\npublic class BiosGeneralFragment extends Fragment implements BiosGeneralView {\n    @BindView(R.id.toolbar) Toolbar

I will try withPositionBasedStateManagement(false) then. I guess with that the sub-item(s) should remain selected even when the parent menu item is collapsed and re-expanded.\nThe drawer auto-closing behavior is ok.. withPositionBasedStateManagement(false) has no effect. Sub-items get de-selected when the root element is collapsed and re-expanded.. @mikepenz thanks, let me know.. @mikepenz I updated to 8.5.3 and fixed the issue. Thanks!. Thank You for the awesome lib and the quick fix ;). Thanks a lot @mikepenz. I guess I need to keep a reference to either the header or the drawer as I see that the OnDrawerListener methods return a View.. That's fair enough. It works like a charm. Thanks a lot. ",

Doesn't help!\nlong id = labelCount.getId();\n                IDrawerItem existingItem = drawer.getDrawerItem(id);\n                IDrawerItem newItem = new PrimaryDrawerItem()\n                        .withIcon(iconLabel.mutate())\n                        .withIconTintingEnabled(true)\n                        .withIdentifier(labelCount.getId())\n                        .withName(labelCount.getLabel())\n                        .withBadge(String.valueOf(labelCount.getCount()));.

    "AllanWang": "Is drawer.getAdapter().withPositionBasedStateManagement(false); still the only fix if we programmatically select drawer items with tinting? If so, is there any reason not to include that by default since no drawer will have an enormous number of items?. For others looking at this question, ProfileSettingDrawerItem contains withTextColor. How did you add the items to your drawer?. Is there anything you've done with the drawer setup or item setup that is different from the sample app? Or maybe you should specify your device info. I've personally never had that issue before.. When the secondary text is visible, it is vertically aligned with the arrow. When it is just the first line, I expected that to be brought down and align with the arrow. I think it would look nicer too. @mikepenz As a note since I've just gotten to changing this, going from\nxml\nandroid:layout_marginBottom=\"@dimen/material_drawer_padding\"\nandroid:gravity=\"center_vertical\"\nto \nxml\nandroid:layout_marginBottom=\"@dimen/material_drawer_account_header_dropdown_margin_bottom\"\nandroid:gravity=\"center_vertical|bottom\"\nin the material_drawer_account_header_text_section LinearLayout is enough to address the issue. The padding is changed to match that of the arrow and the alignment is to the bottom.\nScreenshot for original:\n\nScreenshot for updated:\n\nScreenshot for updated with both lines:\n\nDoesn't seem to look different from your current implementation but things are properly aligned if either line is hidden.\nI think this may be preferred to the current center implementation, but it's up to you whether you want to make this change.. You may be setting the drawer to open position 0 on launch, which is triggering the listener. If you need more help maybe post how you've added the drawer.. Is that your actual implementation? You have a few instance where you've built the drawer and didn't use it, and you won't need to open then close the drawer immediately.\nOn the top of your formatted code portion, you can see result.setSelection(1, true);, which sets the selection and has true which will emit a click event. @trinhvanminh2009  Typically, the drawer is attached to the activity and the inner contents are managed by fragments. Perhaps you should look at that rather than launching a new activity every time. If you do choose to stick with the activity, maybe pass the position index into the next activity and then set the drawer position to that value when it loads. Look up intent extras for that.\nEdit: I now see that a lot of the code you posted matches that of the sample app. Keep in mind that the purpose of that app is to showcase many drawer styles, which is why it launches the activities. Your app likely has a different purpose.. @trinhvanminh2009 I suggest you look into fragments. That way you only have one drawer and you don't have to worry about the selection. Have a look at how to switch fragments, which you will do so when you receive a drawer click. I believe the drawer has a translucent status bar by default. Try disabling that and setting the status bar color directly as you would in any activity:\ngetWindow().setStatusBarColor(Color.BLUE);\nThis is for lollipop and up and you may need to add other flags depending on your setup..

I have to use Collections.swap(getDrawerItems(), oldPosition-1, newPosition-1); to get no OutOfBoundsException.. Sorry one more question: I tried to implement draging for only a few items. For this I implemented OnLongClickListener and call touchHelper.startDrag(...) from it. But here is my problem.\nstartDrag needs a ViewHolder as parameter. I tried to use item.getViewHolder(ViewGroup) but if I pass the RecyclerView as ViewGroup parameter I get:\n\nStart drag has been called with a view holder which is not a child of the RecyclerView which is controlled by this ItemTouchHelper.\n\nSo which ViewGroup should I use for this?. Wow thank you great work!. Is it also possible to add a reorder icon to the right side / end of a menu item to indicate the user that the items are dragable? Do I have to use a custom layout for this? If so which is the default layout?. Here is the code I used to create reorderable items ins the drawer. In fact I created a subclass of com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.Drawer and ...DrawerBuilder but it shouldn't be more then below:\nFastAdapter<IDrawerItem> adapter = new FastAdapter<>();\nadapter.withAllowDeselection(false);\nadapter.withSelectable(true);\n\ndrawer.withAdapter(adapter);\n\nSimpleDragCallback touchCallback = new SimpleDragCallback(this);\nItemTouchHelper touchHelper = new ItemTouchHelper(touchCallback);\ntouchHelper.attachToRecyclerView(drawer.getRecyclerView());\n\nFor my items I used following subclass:\n```\npublic class TextMenuItem extends PrimaryDrawerItem implements IDraggable {\nprotected boolean dragable;\n\npublic TextMenuItem() {\n    dragable = true;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean isDraggable() {\n    return dragable;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic TextMenuItem withIsDraggable(boolean b) {\n    dragable = b;\n    return this;\n}\n\n}\n```\nI think it should be no problem to create the same subclass for your SecondSecondaryDrawerItem.

Sorry to waste your time if it's something in my app. . @mikepenz Here's what I've found. It looks like the switchProfiles procedure is getting called by firebase on the removal of the listeners / launching of the new activity even though the new activity doesn't extend the firebase auth abstract activity. So here's what happens:\n- First activity (extended of abstract BaseAuthenticationActivity) launches with the correct account.\n- Start new activity (extended of abstract AppCompatActivity)\n- OnCreate called in new activity.\n- Firebase fires onAuthenticationChange.\n- Causes the authentication handler to fire and get user, setting up header\n- Header setup calls setProfiles. \n- setProfile calls switchProfiles thinks that mCurrentProfile is the incorrect account. The response of the switchable accounts is ordered by the JavaEE response from my server response in SQL.\nI'm blaming firebase for right now. I'm rebuilding the authentication provider implementation to improve the flow and reduce possible duplicate callbacks that would fire after the oncreate on the new activity. Thanks for your help, I'll update this tonight once I find the actual problem and getting a working example.\n. @mikepenz So it TOTALLY was Firebase. Here's the problem for anyone finding this:\n- I had followed the Firebase Auth tutorial that showed to register the OnAuthenticationChangeListener during OnStart and release during OnStop.\n- In my OnAuthenticationChangeListener I had a call to my own remote server API for user interaction. The result of this API would update the account header. \n- The registered activity's registration causes OnAuthenticationChangeListener to fire during OnPause of the original activity.\nMy solutiuon: I used the Firebase-UI library to handle the firebase account selection options: https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/master/auth/README.md\nI removed the listener from the activity and only had it fire during OnCreate of that activity only. This prevents the half-loading, random fire of the auth-chain that was messing everything up. This is described in the link above. Here's the onCreate that handles the firebase user checking. @mikepenz Thanks for your help, I think it's safe to close this now (thanks firebase...).  I'll create a demo if anyone thinks it'll help??? \n     @Override\nprotected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    if (FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser() == null)\n        needsLogin();\n    else\n        Firebase.getCurrentInstance()\n                .getCurrentUser()\n                .getToken(true)\n                .addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<GetTokenResult>() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onSuccess(GetTokenResult getTokenResult) {\n                        confirmFirebaseAisUser(\"Null\", getTokenResult.getToken());\n                    }\n                })\n                .addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception e) {\n                        onAuthenticationError(e);\n                    }\n                });\n}\n\n. @mikepenz I think I may do that here soon as I get over the initial build stage of my current project. After the rebuild, moved on to other things, but noticed that only as certain users would the issue happen. \nIs there a limit on the number of accounts that I can put into the account header? I'm getting the same issue, only when my account has more than 3 accounts to select from. Firebase was causing the problem at first because it was firing after the drawer was gone (possibly creating multiple \"accounts\" in error). But now there is no Firebase event fire on that activity, so I started playing. Noticed that if my account had 3 or less \"switchable\" accounts, the problem wouldn't happen. as soon as I add additional \"switchable accounts\", the problem comes back. . ",

I return true or return false always have a problem. After startActivity(intent) it always choose selection(item1). I'm using this class is abstract and others  class extends from this class. I can't use \n result.setSelection(item1) after startActivity. How I can fix it.\n Thank you.. I know when I startActivity(Intent) then new class will refresh this. That why it always selection(item1). Can you give me an idea to fix it ?. So , I should use fragment or use intent.putExtra. I have 2 options ? . Yeah . I used fragment for google maps and dialog fragment. But this way I never try before. Thank you so much . I'll try that right now .. @mikepenz Thanks for support. I'm using the Drawer in BaseActivity. But it's not working perfect like me think. Maybe my code have some problem. I think using Fragment is better idea. Using BaseActivity also good , but how to change activity not using intent or how to set Selection in onDrawerItemClickListener ? .   Glide.with(imageView.getContext()).load(uri).placeholder(placeholder).into(imageView);\n//placeholder(placeholder) not found. Can't resovle this method.\n.

    "Jaguarhl": "For a few days I tryed to solve this problem and succesfully solved it with 3 different layouts. Each depends on API level: from 16 till 18 - standard. To 19 API level with margin and padding:\n<android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n        android:id=\"@+id/toolbar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:background=\"?attr/colorPrimary\"\n        android:minHeight=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n        android:theme=\"?attr/actionBarTheme\"\n        android:layout_marginTop=\"@dimen/ab_padding_top\"\n        android:paddingTop=\"@dimen/ab_padding_top\"/>\nand greater then 19 standart again. But, from API 20 I added to custom menu header layout this View:\n<View\n        android:layout_height=\"15dp\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:id=\"@+id/marginFromTop\" />\nI know that it is not the best solution, because later I will need to add layout for hi-def screens. But this solution works for me. Maybe I will experiment with theme, but it is strange.\nAnd another question: could you point me to right direction - how to add animation to materialdrawer menu? For example - to hide some menu items except selected, and resume it later.. My theme is:\n<!-- Base application theme. -->\n    <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n        <item name=\"colorPrimary\">@color/colorPrimary</item>\n        <item name=\"colorPrimaryDark\">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>\n        <item name=\"colorAccent\">@color/colorAccent</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowNoTitle\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowTranslucentStatus\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <item name=\"material_drawer_divider\">@color/divider</item>\n        <item name=\"material_drawer_primary_text\">@color/colorPrimaryText</item>\n        <item name=\"material_drawer_secondary_text\">@color/colorPrimaryText</item>\n    </style>\nI depends on design, and there not too much freedom ). This was added in search of solution ) \nI init drawer by calling initDrawer() method in onCreate(). In method:\n```LayoutInflater mInflater = LayoutInflater.from(this.getBaseContext());\nView mCustomView = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.ls_menu_header, null);\n... init UI elements in mCustomView ...\nlsMenuDrawer = new DrawerBuilder().withActivity(this)\n                .withTranslucentStatusBar(true)\n                .withDrawerWidthRes(R.dimen.ls_mnu_width)\n                .withSliderBackgroundColorRes(R.color.colorLeftSideMenu)\n                .withHeader(mCustomView)\n                .withHeaderDivider(false)\n                .withPositionBasedStateManagement(false)\n                .addDrawerItems(... and adding menu items...\nThis is current version. I had removed  .withDisplayBelowStatusBar(true) already. And some things have been added while experiments ) Like .withPositionBasedStateManagement(false). Oh, .withRootView(R.id.drawer_container) ``` \nwill check tomorrow. Thank you.\nI sow sample apps, but a few month ago.\nAnd what can you advice me on animation question? ). For example - to hide some menu items except selected, and resume it later.. Thank you. Will try it ). I've tryed some things we talk about, but no changes. So, app works now in the needed way, and it's a time for next tasks. No time for searching root of problems with MateriaDrawer on different API versions.

(If on LTR locale displays ltr, and on RTL locale displays rtl).\nIn my case I don't need everything in RTL regardless of the local hence didn't test that use case...\nAlso, the item row also doesn't adjust accordingly to the local... the icon is aligned properly but the text isn't... working on that now.... @mikepenz \nHi Mike,\nSo I have been working on the header layout to fully support RTL based on the layout direction and not locale.\nWhile doing so I encountered an issue that I hope maybe you would know why it accrues, or maybe point me in a direction to solve it.\n\n\nWhen the layout direction is LTR, the profile image, user name and email, and row icons all have the proper left layout margin of 16dp, and everything works as expected.\nNow, when the layout direction is RTL the profile image and row icon have the proper layout margin on the right(also View.start), but the profile name and email are indented more than what is specified in XML.\nEven when I completely remove the margins in this layout direction, there is still a layout margin on the right, that I can't figure out where it is coming from.\nNo matter what I do to eliminate the margin, I can't seem to get rid of it.\nAny clue?\nLTR:\n\nRTL:\n\n. @mikepenz ?.

Yes I would like to add the logo above the user's profile picture. (I mention that I have disabled the option to have multiple accounts .... the sidebar is static from this point of view, having only one user at all times...so above its profile picture I want to display the apps logo...I thought I could find an option for that, like that withStickyFooter or something). Thank you for your suggestion @mikepenz. I have created a custom header and everything is fine now. But I have one more question: Can I use the fontawesome icons somewhere else in my app. For example I want to display the same icons I am using for the drawerItems in the activity toolbar. For example:\ngetSupportActionBar().setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(true);\n        getSupportActionBar().setIcon(FontAwesome.Icon.faw_tachometer);\nBut the setIcon does not recognize it as an icon. Any idea? . ",

Solved the issue..went back to original code where i was having problem that their was empty space in place of actionBar and than figured out where was the problem and realized that it was a inherent issue with fitsSystemWindow applied to MaterialDrawer layout causing it...so finally went on to use Toolbar theme but without toolbar in the layout(since was not required) and made changes in my style.xml to support theming to both type of activities(with ActionBar & without Action/Toolbar). .

It helped me a lot.\nI thought it was inconsistent because the first time I called drawer.setSelectionAtPosition(myPos) I did set myPos to the first element of my list which is 0 (this was called in on resume).\nSo calling it from onResume meant pos = 0, clicking it manually meant pos = 1.\nSo it was a programming error..

    "aakarnik": "@mikepenz Hi, thanks for the quick reply :) I used the .withIconTintingEnabled(true) but it changed the color of the icon permanently. Is there a method I should combine with it?. Yes, I was changing the code quite frequently, that's why the method is not in the above code. I used it like this:\njava\nnew PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(R.string.menu_home).withIcon(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.home)).withTextColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.textColorPrimary)).withIconTintingEnabled(true);. I compared with the sample app, I don't know it is not working for ours. Currently we are using two arrays - drawable and blueDrawable - of xmls to change the color of the items in the drawer. The function looks like this: \njava\npublic PrimaryDrawerItem changeUX(int iconText, Drawable drawable, int blueDrawable) {\n        return new PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(iconText).withIcon(drawable).withTextColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.textColorPrimary)).withSelectedIcon(blueDrawable);\n    }. The original xml file for the icon is white - so it is not manually colored in the Java class.\nThe requirement is to have the icon of the selected item to have the color/similar color of the background. For that, an xml of the same icon with different color is used with the method withSelectedIcon()\nHere is a screenshot for a better idea:\n\nI will try to use the methods in your comment and let you know. I really appreciate the help :)\n. Finally, this code worked:\njava\nreturn new PrimaryDrawerItem().withName(iconText)\n                .withIcon(drawable)\n                .withIconColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.textColorPrimary))\n                .withTextColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.textColorPrimary))\n                .withSelectedIconColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.primary))\n                .withIconTintingEnabled(true);\nI had to set the color of the icon in method regardless of the original color of the drawable to use the .withSelectedIconColor() and .withIconTintingEnabled() method. \nThanks a lot for your help and guidance :) :).

    "shripal17": "Setting theme in AndroidManifest.xml is not an option for me, because the user can change the app's theme (dark/light) at runtime from app settings.\nI did try to use the attributes in styles.xml with values like ?android:attr/colorBackground and ?andorid:attr/textColorPrimary, colorBackground was fetched perfectly but textColorPrimary was still black in both light and dark themes. I even tried textColorSecondary and textColorPrimaryInverse but everytime ended up with black as text color for items in the navigation drawer\nI have used ?android:attr/textColorPrimary in other places in my app (for e.g. layouts) it works fine there, but seems to be a problem only in MaterialDrawer. Alright I will try adding the dependency.\nAny additional steps? Or just adding the dependency will work?. Okay got it. Will try and respond in some time\n. ",

I am daily user of Fast Adapter too but i mean with \"Drag and Drop\" functionality to be able to give the users a option to drag the items and arrange in runtime.

    "Schwartzalexander": "\nThe header uses the following to load images:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer#load-images-via-url\n(this was introduced to have a generic way of allowing any image loader you may use)\n\nThank you @mikepenz. I am going to try that. But what about the name and email? These don't get updated in the header, either. See example.. I was not. But I just tried it. Calling updateProfile(@NonNull IProfile) seems to solve that problem, but it introduces some other problems, I never had before.\n\nSome times, the profile list can no longer be expended propperly: When I click on the little arrow, nothing happens. Only when I swipe the menu up or down, the default menu items disappear and the profiles are shown instead.\nSome times, the menu breaks completely, meaning that the menu items get selected on click, but the appopriate actions (attaching fragments) are not executed. When this happens, the other profile icons and the active profile name/email disappear, too.\n\nI will have to investigate this more deeply.\nThank you for the help :). ",

I did try the demo but not go deep into other activities other than MainActivity, sorry for the bother.
