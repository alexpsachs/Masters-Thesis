I wanted to sanitize app names as ubuntu does not allow seem to allow spaces in app names for the dock, and I seemed to have overlooked that.\nSure, done: https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/103\n. @jiahaog you're probably already aware of it, but I saw Electron v0.36.6 just learned a new trick that might help your OSX icon code:\n\n\nAdd app.dock.setIcon API.\n. @hobbs --tray was recently added, see nativefier --help or https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/master/docs/api.md#tray. @hobbs if passing a --icon /path/to/icon.png, you should have it used in the tray. Are you?. @jiahaog hi! I see two problems with the current auto-detection:\nI explicitly don't want flash, could the --flash argument support a false value? Or could nativefier default to not bundling flash?\nSupposing I want it, auto-detection fails for users of the non-release Chrome channel, here is what I see due to using Chrome Beta, which for me on Ubuntu Linux in installed in /opt/google/chrome-beta:\n\n\nA JavaScript error occurred in the main process\nUncaught Exception:\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir '/opt/google/chrome'\n    at Error (native)\n    at Object.fs.readdirSync (fs.js:856:18)\n    at Object.fs.readdirSync (ATOM_SHELL_ASAR.js:497:28)\n    at findSyncRecurse (/opt/hipchat-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/app/src/helpers/inferFlash.js:33\n:29)\n    at findSync (/opt/hipchat-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/app/src/helpers/inferFlash.js:32:5)\n    at linuxMatch (/opt/hipchat-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/app/src/helpers/inferFlash.js:61:12)\n    at inferFlash (/opt/hipchat-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/app/src/helpers/inferFlash.js:17:16)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/opt/hipchat-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/app/src/main.js:21:23)\n    at __webpack_require__ (/opt/hipchat-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/webpack/bootstrap 1aa06e4205\ne3e37da886:19:1)\n    at /opt/hipchat-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/webpack/bootstrap 1aa06e4205e3e37da886:39:1\n. @jiahaog fantastic, thanks! :)\n.

Sorry for the noise.\n. > \"Yes, this is because the new windows created have dimensions that are not defined. I don't think this is a problem, because more often than not the new windows are for logins.\"\nThis, and the fact that browsers now default to opening window.open()-ed windows in tabs, which we don't have :-/ . I'm afraid there isn't much we can do at this point, but maybe we don't have to, as the trend in single-page apps is certainly not to pop tons of new windows (contradictions welcome). Figma, for example, stopped doing this and works just fine now. Closing this issue, feel free to re-open if new elements deserve consideration.. @joeytwiddle @revengel is this bug still valid? Here under Linux (Arch/GNOME) the menubar behaves well: Alt+Shift doesn't reveal it, Alt+Tab doesn't either, only pressing only Alt reveals it.

(I just tried nativefier -e 1.6.6 \"https://google.com\").\nClosing, please come back if the bug is still present!. @joeytwiddle this option exists, and defaults to hiding the menu bar:\n~ nativefier --help | grep menu-bar\n    -m, --show-menu-bar             set menu bar visible, defaults to false\nCan you try fiddling with it on the latest nativefier?

If that still doesn't help, please chime in (debug information welcome :) and we'll re-open this.. Closing this as electron \"don't have any plan to support Chrome extension APIs\". Workarounds don't seem very satisfactory :-/ , but as @eladnava mentioned, system-wide blocking via hosts file (e.g. Dan Pollock's hosts file) can be a workaround. \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.

So, a user who does not want launchers (e.g. if packaging for another machine), would have to remove the launchers after nativefying.\n\nIs everyone okay with such an {automatic, not disableable} creation, or does anyone have a good reason to require a flag?\nIf you're all good, vote this comment with a \ud83d\udc4d.

Duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/304 , which was submitted later but has a bit more discussion. Closing this issue, feel free to subscribe to the other issue :). Hey @leovarmak. The Help menu provides helpful (!) information about the version used (which may be useful for troubleshooting), as well as a link to the GitHub issue tracker. Both seem very relevant so no, there's not plan to remove them. Note that without menu bar (which is the default) they're not visible, so that's a way to do that. Closing.. > \"The \"build with ...\" is fine but the \"Report issue\" might be a problem as people may think it is for the app content itself :-)\"\n@gitmh good point, and that's feedback I saw here several times. Re-opening.. @Fragoel2 thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude03 . I understand you'd like deeper access to patching nativefier internals before bundling an app, but it's still fuzzy to me:\n\nYour use case is not clear to me: what kind of modifications do you bring?\n\"Get[ting] the [nativefier] source files, alter[ing] them and then compil[ing] them on my own\" is entirely feasible, be sure to check the developer docs\nDid you consider contributing your changes as a PR?\n\nClosing for now, feel free to chime in and re-open if I'm missing something.. @BTooLs I think --inject is what you need, yes (saying \"I think\" because I've never used the feature, and have only been helping maintaining Nativefier for little time). Note it's not just for injecting JS, it supports CSS too.\nBack to the issue: to anyone wanting to fix this, the Electron online/offline events doc is a nice place to start.. Hey @jstrachan, in Nativefier, that behavior is bound to Shift + Left-click. Hmmm but looking at browsers behaviors, Ctrl+Click also feels more logical to me. @jiahaog, any reason for Shift rather than Ctrl?\n@eladnava https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/212#issuecomment-292689727 might be a workable (albeit a bit arcane for now, going through a regex) option equivalent to your workaround.. > For me with version 7.1.0 it seems like Shift or Cmd and left click does open in new window then Ctrl + left click popups the choice between open in default browser and open in new window. \n\nI've tried every permutation I can think of between Shift, Ctrl, fn, cmd/splat and a left click and I can't get Open in default browser to trigger.  Has anyone else figured out a way to do it?\n\n@jstrachan nah you're right, the behavior you are describing is correct, I must have been hallucinating after hours of the big issue triage this answer was part of \ud83d\ude04. So, yeah, it's a feature request, but in the meantime see #212 and the --internal-urls option, maybe it will be useful to your use case.. @BardiaKh we just released Nativefier 7.2.0, which upgrades all our dependencies, and I think I saw a commit mentioning electron-packager does a better job at this wine/rcedit thing. Could you please try this new version and report back if the problem persists or is solved? Thanks!. Can't reproduce the issue on 7.2.0, but @BardiaKh note your usage also triggers bug #233 \"Nativefier fails when using options --conceal plus --icon\".

If you need bash-specific behavior, try out the {shell: 'path/to/bash'} option.\n\n\u2192 ... but we're not passing this option. What's going on? If shelljs ran this through POSIX sh, it should fail.

There's no automatic update: yes a nativefied app is locked to a specific version of Chrome/Electron, which you can specify at build time using the --electron-version option (see nativefier --help for the full list of options, and go to the electron/releases page to pick your favorite stable/beta flavor of Electron poison :) ). There's no plan to change that, as all the machinery for this is part of the nativefier builder and not the nativefied app.\nHowever, you can upgrade an app by just re-running nativefier at the same place with a newer --electron-version.\n@jlecour re-bundling the same app at the same place shouldn't \"lose history, cookies, identification\u2026.\", I just tried it on my Feedly app and was still (cookie) logged-in after re-bundling.

Closing after two weeks as need info and successful tests under macOS Sierra. @kyroskoh feel free to chime in and re-open the discussion anytime.. @humphd thanks for the report \ud83d\udc4d, good catch! We're resuming maintenance of nativefier and we have lots to do. So if you have the time for that, a PR will be most welcome.. Hey @kcampion @nansthomas, https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/256 was recently released as part of Nativefier 7.1.0, could you try it and see if --counter works now? Thanks :). @Jamesking56 thanks for the feedback! There's no automatic update: yes a nativefied app is locked to a specific version of Chrome/Electron, which you can specify at build time using the --electron-version option (see nativefier --help for the full list of options, and go to the electron/releases page to pick your favorite stable/beta flavor of Electron poison :) ). There's no plan to change that, as all the machinery for this is part of the nativefier builder and not the nativefied app.\nHowever,\n\nYou can upgrade an app by just re-running nativefier at the same place with a newer --electron-version\nSince you mention it's for enterprise deployment, what would make sense is that administrators periodically do this re-bundling (to benefit from Electron/Chrome security & perf improvements) and deploy the newly-bundled app to the fleet of machines, using Active Directory or whatever they use for that.\n\n\nDuplicate of #291 . > \"Any ETA as to when can this be added ?\"\n@leovarmak none! We (maintainers) are resuming maintenance since the original maintainer no longer has time for that. There's lots to do and we're far away from new features, as currently focusing on issue triaging, doing a big round of deps updates & testing, existing PRs, simplifying the build process, and bugfixes.\nBut the feature is clear and APIs are here, so anyone with the will and time for that can try giving it a stab, PRs will be much welcome and we'll be here to help along the way :). @imagins thanks for the feedback! I'm not sure I understand your problem correctly, let me reformulate: you bundled a site that lets you download files, but downloading under Nativefier doesn't work. Right?\nIf I'm understanding correctly, your version of Nativefier should handle downloading of files right into your OS Downloads folder; this was implemented after https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/185 . Can you check into your Downloads folder?\n\nIf you confirm downloading works, I agree the downloading should be more visible and created issue https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/335 for that.\n\nIf downloading actually fails for you, can you give more debug information? (site used, steps to download a file). Closing after two weeks as need info. @imagins feel free to chime in and re-open the discussion anytime.. Hi @denegny, thanks for the bug report! Sadly I cannot reproduce the issue on my machine :-/ .\n\n\nCan you try with the latest Nativefier 7.1.0 and a recent electron? Use nativefier's --electron-version (full help available at nativefier --help)\n\nDo videos play fine in Chrome?\nIf still not working, can you precise the issue scenario a bit more? Was the app youtube.com, or was the video frame an iframe embed? Any more details welcome!. Closing as issue wasn't reproducible and didn't get feedback. @denegny feel free to chime in (we just released Nativefier 7.2.0 with an upgraded default Electron, which may be helpful in your case) and re-open the discussion anytime \ud83d\ude03!. @stackfull thanks for the report; I didn't know such a thing exists. One question: is Chrome happy with this and able to open the URL?. > \"I can only vouch for browsers on Macs. But, yes, chrome can run the app with that URL. They are how \"bonjour\" addresses appear. I believe \"avahi\" on linux boxes resolve the addresses. In my case, there is a raspberry pi music player on my network using musicbox.local.\"\n\n@stackfull alright, thanks for the fast feedback \ud83d\udc4d, un-marking as needinfo. However, I have no mDNS service to test a fix, could you test one for me? The fix would simply be to enable an option exposed by the validator library we use to validate URLs:\n\nOpen the normalizeUrl.js file reported by the error message and go to the line where current nativefier throws an error. Then, replace:\n\njs\n    if (!validator.isURL(normalized, {require_protocol: true, require_tld: false})) {\nwith\njs\n    if (!validator.isURL(normalized, {require_protocol: true, require_tld: false, allow_trailing_dot: true})) {\n\nRe-run nativefier on your mDNS address (also, please ask for a recent Electron/Chrome): nativefier --electron-version 1.6.6 \"http://mything.local.:8080/app\"\nRun the nativefied app.\n\n\u2192 Does building work and does the nativefied app work as expected? If yes to both and if you have the time for that, go ahead and submit a PR!. @stackfull --ding--, this is your friendly reminder: when you get a few minutes for that, could you try the patch above on your side? Thanks! \ud83d\ude03 . > Works perfectly!\n@stackfull thanks for the test \ud83d\udc4d, pushing the fix.. Hi @pando85, thanks for the report. I cannot reproduce the issue, can you be more precise and/or try with a recent nativefier + electron? Here's what I tried:\n\nRun nativefier -e 1.6.6 --name \"feedly\" --icon \"/opt/feedly.png\" \"https://feedly.com/i/latest\"\nRun ./feedly-linux-x64/feedly and verify icon is visible in the GNOME Shell alt-tab switcher; it is.\nRun mv ./feedly-linux-x64 ./foo && ./foo/feedly and verify icon is visible in the GNOME Shell alt-tab switcher; it still is for me.. Closing as issue wasn't reproducible and didn't get feedback. @pando85  feel free to chime in and re-open the discussion anytime \ud83d\ude03!. @e110s thanks for the suggestion \ud83d\udc4d, noted as feature request.\n\nI also encounter the situation, as a workaround and seeing you run Linux, maybe try autokey to associate a hot-abbreviation to your full email. For example you could type e@g and have it expanded to ellos@gmail.com.. Hi @toschneck, thanks for the PR! There are a few unaddressed review comments, are you still interested in pushing this forwards?. > Hi @ronjouch, unfortunately I had in past weeks no time for that because of my vacation. But yes, I'm still interested, I will take a look at this, hopefully this or next week. Is this ok for you guys?\n@toschneck sure! Was asking as part of a big issues/pulls triage. Thanks for your contribution \ud83d\udc4d. This PR was inadvertently closed due to us getting rid of the old development branch (we came back to merging on good'ol master). Changing base branch to master and reopening.\n@toschneck when you find the time to work on that, a rebase will be welcome :). Cooooooo. @toschneck thanks for initiative, and thanks for keeping up with the PR :) \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d for the research, @maxdec. We won't do any better than Chrome, then.\n@momosby @maxdec closing this for now, if the situation gets better in Chrome feel free to chime in and we'll see what's within Electron reach by then. Thanks to both of you!. @lockerdevs thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d . We did a big dependencies upgrade as part of Nativefier 7.2.0, and I vaguely remember one of them fixed a bug along those lines. Could you try this new version and report if the problem persists? Thanks!. Closing as issue wasn't reproducible and didn't get feedback. @lockerdevs feel free to chime in and re-open the discussion anytime \ud83d\ude03!. @ChrisKendallVA thanks for the bug report! To sum up the base problem, notifications crash/freeze your nativefied app. We'll need more debug information, could you:\n\nTry re-packaging your app with the latest Nativefier 7.1.0 and a recent Electron (e.g. 1.6.6) using option --electron-version \nPrecise the nativefied URL\nPrecise your OS. > crashing upon notify no longer (or at the moment) exists\n\n@ChrisKendallVA \ud83d\udc4d, thanks for the feedback! Closing, as we're about to release a new version defaulting to a recent electron.\n\nAlso the JS Errors when downloading a file no longer exist either but do display a blank popup box with no download indicator :)\n\n@ChrisKendallVA yeah the download experience sucks (downloading isn't explicit enough, and neither is the path to downloaded file), this is tracked in issue https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/335.. Hey @ProLoser, thanks for the feedback. I think Nativefier already has what you need, but am unsure:\n\nTo hide the window controls, use option --hide-window-frame (try nativefier --help for a full list). \nAt this point, if you end up wondering \"how then do I move this controls-less macOS window\", try this stackoverflow discussion or Alt-Drag.\n\n\nThen there may be some piece of behavior present in Fluid menubar apps that's not here in nativefier, but I'd need precisions: which menubar-specific behavior are you missing in a hide-window-frame-d nativefied app?\n\nClosing this issue as I think 1. will do the trick for you, and if I missed something about point 2, please chime with details.. @jamiewilson thanks for the details\ud83d\udc4d.\n\n\"Happy to move this to a new issue if that's helpful. Let me know if I can clarify anything.\"\n\nYes, please do. I don't know if it's the original use case asked for by @ProLoser, but yours is certainly legit, and I can imagine using this myself. Have been wanting something similar for an emoji picker using whatever web emoji service provides the best UI. When creating your new issue,\n\nPlease avoid macOS-specific terminology. Thus, menubar \u2192 system tray, which makes it clear it's the OS \"background running apps spot\", and avoid confusion with our menubar options.\nPlease enumerate the full list of options Fluid supports in the app options screenshot you posted:\nWhen window loses focus,:  Hide, what else? Do nothing?\nApplication icon is in: Menubar, what else? Dock, I guess? Something else?\n\n\nGiven these options, the Hide+Menubar combo is for a drawer-like behavior, and the Do nothing + Dock is akin to a regular nativefied app.\nAre there other combinations you would use?\nWould you agree the other ones make less sense? (I'm trying to reduce this options matrix to a single workflow-meaningful case, if possible.)\n\n\n\nMy current os-neutral formulation of your feature request would become something like \"Support --tray-drawer flag to enable easily-accessible apps with one click on tray icon\". Feel free to steal/reformulate/improve it for your issue.. Nativefier option --disable-context-menu is here for you :) . See nativefier --help for the full list of options.. @danimalweb looks like it's possible, yeah, but I have no experience with it :-/ , try looking at https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/295 . If you end up with something working we'll be happy to accept documentation/guidelines to do that \ud83d\ude03.. Hi @solepixel @rcherny @idf @AdrianTP, and thanks for the feedback. I couldn't reproduce the issue, though; could you all try the newly released nativefier 7.2.0 and report back if the problem persists? If it does, please include as much debug information as possible, like @solepixel did: version of Node, OS, potential error log, website nativefied, anything :). Closing as  non-reproducible, feel free to chime in with more info and reproduction steps. Thanks @zbicin! \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udcaf . @ivo1981 thanks for the feedback! It makes sense that if nativefier has --width and --height flags, it could have --x and --y ones too.\nGlad you found a workaround; alternatively, you could have moved the window even without a window bar (I assume you used --hide-window-frame):\n\nUnder Linux, just Alt+click/drag the window.\nUnder macOS, see this stackoverflow discussion or Alt-Drag.\nUnder Windows, use AltDrag.\n\nFinally, if you found your way through the main.js of the generated app, maybe with some more effort you'd be able to add the option and propose a Pull Request? If you give it a try and need help, feel free to ask here :). @ivo1981 welcome, glad it's appreciated \ud83d\ude38! Cool, go ahead and try a fix; feel free to ask for help and don't hesitate to submit a PR early, we'll discuss your code there.. Project seems dead. I contacted @jiahaog by email in January and February, asking the same and proposing help, (starting with cutting a release, reviewing PRs, triaging issues). Didn't get an answer, I hope s/he's fine; is probably just busy, his/her GitHub activity shows recent activity in private repos.\n@darrenhaken I'm pinging them once more, let's wait for a few days, then I'd be glad to help with a fork and maintenance. Thoughts?\n\nEDIT 2017-04-04 to passersby: we are in touch with @jiahaog and are working on a release :)\nEDIT 2017 04-04 wheee, train picking up steam. Closing :). > \"is it going to be upgraded anytime soon?\"\n@ambonium the original maintainer (Jia), as well as two new maintainers including me, are trying to get the train running again. Jia produced a new release 7.1.0 incorporating unmerged PRs, and releasing a new version with updated dependencies is high on our list up next. Hang on, and use @maxdec's suggestion to pick your Electron until then :) . Cheers!. > \"I bumped many of the dependencies in my local version. No major issues so far.\"\n@danimalweb AWESOME \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\udcaf, and thanks for the fast feedback. I'm currently starting helping maintenance with a big issue triage and haven't look at deps yet. If you have the time for that, a PR would be super awesome! If you're going ahead with this, maybe by the way incorporate the deps deletions proposed at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/337 !\ncc @jiahaog @darrenhaken. Duplicate of #275, closing this one.. Hi @codingmatty, thanks for the feedback!\nCould you precise what you'd expect from this feature and provide use case(s) you have in mind? What would you use it for? What would the hotkey do?\nIn the meantime, if we are talking about simply focusing/unfocusing a nativefied app, I suggest looking at AutoHotkey under Windows, and my own marathon for Linux.. Closing after two weeks as need info. @codingmatty feel free to chime in and re-open the discussion anytime.. \ud83d\udc4d, thanks!. Closing as Ubuntu moved from Unity to GNOME Shell. PR still welcome to satisfy remaining Unity users \ud83d\ude42.. > \"Is there any way to keep the same storage, or to move it into the build folder?\nRelated #147 #144 #42 #149 those tickets are marked as Solved but I can't see the option/feature/flag.\"\nHola @BTooLs, thanks for the report! There's no option, since https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/149 the storage location changed from being random to deterministic based on the app URL. So as long as you re-run nativefier with the same URL, the same appdata folder should be used.\nThis is a feature, not a bug, it means for example it's possible to upgrade to a newer electron/chrome by simply re-running nativefier at the same place and with the same URL.\nThen you are mentioning renaming the build folder changes the appdata folder?! I just tested that but couldn't reproduce the issue, are you sure about it / can you provide more details?. > By the way, where are files downloaded? I created draw.io with Nativefier and when I export something (for example, pdf, png) nothing seems to happen.\n@bartier files are downloaded straight to your OS-defined Downloads folder. Typically, that would be:\n\nWindows: C:\\Users\\bartier\\Downloads\nmacOS/Linux: ~/Downloads. O hai everyone interested in this bug: @githubbob42 just contributed PR https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/526 , which means a slew of electron-dl options are now available to customize the download experience. So #499 is closed, but the present #335 \"Better UX\" bug remains open and welcoming contributions. \n\nFeel free to mention here how you use the new --file-download-options flag (that may give ideas to others, and we can include interesting use cases to the documentation), and thanks again to @githubbob42 !. > \"I think it's a little obvious to tell the user to check nativefier --help, but it's definitely a good idea to print the latest electron version there! Also, it would be great if we could print something telling them that they are using a outdated version of nativefier, or other useful things that they might want to know!\"\n@jiahaog good point for the outdated nativefier, I'll consider it.\nAnd regarding telling/encouraging to check nativefier --help, it's an idea I got after my big issue triage, which led me to think it's not so obvious for many users. Will keep it short when I work on it, and will submit output examples that we can discuss.. Indeed, thanks @rohmanhm \ud83d\udc4d. > \"in most users, Open with more popular and familiar rather than Open in\"\nTrue, merging. Thanks!. EDIT see message below, I did my breaking-change hunting homework in our deps, everything seems okay :)  ~Aaaalright, that being said: this is the fastest, laziest, YOLOest, shoot-from-the-hip-est npm mass-update ever, I didn't even read release notes for major versions of new deps. That being said, IT WORKS FOR ME \\o/ under Linux, so I figured I'd do the homework later and would start by getting feedback from interested people \ud83d\ude03.~\nSo, @jiahaog @darrenhaken and (as you showed interest in https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/327) @ambonium @maxdec @danimalweb: could you try this branch?\n\nFollow our developer documentation.\nCheckout the PR: git fetch --all && git checkout deps\nThen, all feedback welcome about npm test and, of course, re-nativefying your apps and running for a few days with them :) . Please indicate your OS/Node for all positive/negative feedback.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\nIssues I noticed so far:\n\n\nEDIT fixed in updated commit, I had broken this when changing options version to electronVersion. ~Useragent detection from Electron is broken: my Gmail app bundled with a fresh Electron 1.6.6 (bundling Chrome 56) complains that \"This version of Chrome is no longer supported\", which is justified as navigator.userAgent reports\nMozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.73 Safari/537.36.~. @jiahaog @darrenhaken update compatibility checking homework done. I think everything is \ud83d\udc9a green, and adjusted a few minor knobs. If anything, the electron-packager changes (linked below) deserve a look, only to know about new features we might be interested in. I pushed an updated commit, tests welcome :) (especially windows and OSX, which I couldn't test yet), and here are my deps update notes with link to each project changelog:\n\n\nApp\n\nelectron-window-state 3.0.3 \u2192 4.1.0\nNothing: single breaking change happened in 4.0.0, which \"drops support for electron versions < 1.0.0\") and nativefier already ships 1.1.3.\n\n\n\n\nDeps\nasync 1.5.2 \u2192 2.3.0\nUsage: async.waterfall in src/build/buildMain.js, src/options/optionsMain.js, and async.eachSeries in test/module/index-spec.js.\nOnly change I see about those was in 2.0.0 for Waterfall multiple callback defense, but I don't see such usage in our code.\n\n\naxios 0.11.1 \u2192 0.16.1\nUsage: .get in src/infer/inferUserAgent.js and src/helpers/helpers.js, not impacted by breaking changes.\n\n\ncheerio 0.20.0 \u2192 0.22.0\nUsage: .load in src/infer/inferTitle.js, not impacted.\n\n\nelectron-packager 7.0.1 \u2192 8.6.0\nUsage: .packager() in src/build/buildMain.js, with options passed from src/options/optionsMain.js.\n7.6.0 enforced minimum Node version, which we should too; updated our package.json with \">= 4.0\".\n8.5.0 renamed option version into electronVersion; updated our options factory.\n\n\nprogress 1.1.8 \u2192 2.0.0\nUsage: ProgressBar in src/helpers/dishonestProgress.js, nada.\n\n\ntmp 0.0.28 \u2192 0.0.31\nUsage: .setGracefulCleanup, .dirSync, all clear.\n\n\nvalidator 5.2.0 \u2192 7.0.0\nUsage: .isURL in src/options/normalizeUrl.js, nada.\n\n\n\n\n\ndevDeps\n\ngulp-istanbul 0.10.3 \u2192 1.1.1, gulp-mocha 2.2.0 \u2192 4.3.0, gulp-sourcemaps 1.6.0 \u2192 2.5.1\nEh, if something's broken, tests will fail \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.\n\n\ngulp-sourcemaps  2.5.0 \u2192 2.6.0\nUsage: .init(), .write() in gulp/helpers/gulp-helpers.js, unaffected by deprecated options.. Status for smoke tests:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc9a for Arch and Ubuntu Linux on Node 7.\n\n\ud83d\udc9a for Windows10 on Node 6 LTS.\n\n\u2753 for macOS, @darrenhaken / @jiahaog on it.. Alright let's merge this and cut a release soon!. Thanks for the feedback @xd1936 it would be awesome, yeah. But I'll close this for now, it's three levels of needs-upstream-fix away :-/\n\n\nIt would be upstream's (electron-packager) job, who closed https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/issues/243 \"How can I create self-contained executables in Windows and GNU/Linux?\", passing the ball to their upstream electron...\n\n... and electron closed their https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/914 \"Atom & App in one executable\"...\n... with these words about their own upstream (Chromium):\n\n\n\"The structure of Chromium is not designed for putting everything into an executable, and it would take too much effort to do that. So unless that situation in Chromium changed atom-shell won't support this.\"\n\nSo, maaaaybe someday, but I wouldn't hold my breath. If you want to go the extra mile, lobbying the Electron/Chromium projects for this feature is probably what would help mosts.. Hi @rohinkumar, thanks for the feedback! No, currently there's no way to nativefy local files. Closing this duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/45, feel free to subscribe to it.. Hi @oliverandrich, thanks for the feedback. I can't reproduce the problem, though:\n\n\u2192 Can you precise from/to which URL fails to trigger your script? From the nativefied app, open the Devtools with Cmd+Shift+I, select the console, then type window.location.href. Perform the action you'd expect to trigger your script, and re-get window.location.href.. @smensak thanks for the feedback; I first thought of HiDPI trouble, but given your resolution that's not the case.\n\nCould you attach a screenshot?\nIs the issue specific to Plank? In other terms, is the icon looking good in the KDE/Plasma switcher?. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/204. Addressed @jiahaog's feedback and pushed updated patch. Ready to merge.. @Phe0nix thanks for the feedback :)\n\nThere's no back/forward/reload/url bar and buttons in Nativefier apps, no. The goal is to package web applications and let the webapps themselves be the way users navigate inside them, with minimal interface around.\nAlso, note that back/forward are already available from the View menu. Would it work for you?\nI'll close that for now, but feel free to add more comments, with enough understanding (please provide use cases, perceived benefits, examples where the lack is particularily painful, etc.) we can reconsider this into a feature request.. @danhawkes weird, using nativefier 7.2.0 and node 7.9.0 under Arch Linux, I get a PNG, visible in Alt+Tab and as Gnome Shell appicon, see below. Not the first time we get unreproducible reports about icon extraction; we'll have a look at the logic, thanks for the report \ud83d\udc4d.\nIn the meantime, please try to work around the bug by manually extracting/finding a good PNG icon, then passing it at build time using the --icon flag (see nativefier --help for the full list of options). Does that work for you?\n```bash\n/opt/n nativefier web.whatsapp.com\nPackaging app for platform linux x64 using electron v1.6.6\nApp built to /opt/n/whats-app-web-linux-x64\n/opt/n sudo strace -o whatsapp.log ./whats-app-web-linux-x64/whats-app-web\n/opt/n grep 'icon.' whatsapp.log\nopen(\"/opt/n/whats-app-web-linux-x64/resources/app/icon.png\", O_RDONLY) = 64\n/opt/n la /opt/n/whats-app-web-linux-x64/resources/app/icon*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ronj ronj 47K Apr 26 07:43 /opt/n/whats-app-web-linux-x64/resources/app/icon.png\n```\nAppicon:\n\n\nNote to self / whoever wants to work on this: look at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/321 by the way.\n. @bergatron thanks for the feedback! Two things:\n\nIt's going to be tough for us to reproduce the issue give this is an internal development URL. Can you share here the result of curl -i \"http://127.0.0.1:61099/device/10.0.1.74:5555/screenshot.jpg\"\nInferring of icon may be the culprit. In the meantime, can you manually pass it with the --icon flag? nativefier --name \"AndroidScreenshots\" --icon /path/to/downloaded-icon.png \"http://127.0.0.1:61099/device/10.0.1.74:5555/screenshot.jpg\". @bergatron good to know my workaround, well, works around \ud83c\udfba.\n\nRegarding the icon not being applied, yeah we have a few like-minded open bugs: https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/321 https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/239 https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/351 , and I'm not sure yet how duplicate/interleaved these issues are, and they're not all reproducible. So, any feedback / intuition / additional information welcome. Renaming and leaving the bug open.\n\nNote to self or whoever works on this: add a timeout?. Merged #583 thanks to @bacongravy . Closing, feel free to reopen if the problem persists.. Bug reproduced; to anyone working on this see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/231 for initial implementation and electron / crashreport api docs, which state that companyName is optional, but apparently it's not.\n~ nativefier --name \"nddg\" --crash-reporter \"http://somecrashreporturl.com\" \"https://start.duckduckgo.com/\" && ./nddg-linux-x64/nddg\nPackaging app for platform linux x64 using electron v1.6.6\nApp built to /home/ronj/nddg-linux-x64\nA JavaScript error occurred in the main process\nUncaught Exception:\nError: companyName is a required option to crashReporter.start\n    at CrashReporter.start (/home/ronj/nddg-linux-x64/resources/electron.asar/common/api/crash-reporter.js:43:13)\n    at App.<anonymous> (/home/ronj/nddg-linux-x64/resources/app/lib/webpack:/app/src/main.js:68:19)\n    at emitOne (events.js:96:13)\n    at App.emit (events.js:188:7. Should be fixed, thanks @githubbob42.. > \"Please tell me what do I need to provide you with, to solve this problem.\"\n@danieldogeanu thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude03. First try running the same nativefier command, but using the --verbose flag. If that doesn't yield anything, it would be awesome if you tried spelunking for some kind of error clue, using Microsoft Process Monitor. Using the built-in filters, try to isolate the process as much as possible, then look for errors in the application trace.\n@RigleyC can you precise your OS, Node, Nativefier command?\n\n\"I have older generated apps, that I had saved before reinstalling my Windows 10, and they all work just fine. The new generated apps however, don't work at all. I've also tried multiple versions of electron and that didn't work either.\"\n\nThanks for already trying other Electron versions. @danieldogeanu @RigleyC are you sure this is specific to Windows 10, or could it be a regression in Nativefier? Could you try older versions of nativefier (especially: 7.0.1 and 6.14.0)? Using npm it's easy to do so using the @ version specifier, for example npm install -g nativefier@7.0.1. > \"The problem was with Electron not downloading completely when you run the command. Of course it wouldn't run, it had an incomplete Electron installation.\"\n@danieldogeanu thanks for getting back to us \ud83d\ude42, will keep in mind. Ideally, hashes for Electron versions should be verified (by us or electron-packager).. Closing, as electron-packager \u2192 electron-download now verifies electron downloads.. Hi @zucher, thanks for the feedback :) . Could you precise your use case? In other words, what have you tried to do with --inject and where did it prove insufficient?. \ud83d\udc4d, thanks for the fix @ialexryan :). Hi @Blueblau, thanks for the feedback. Opening links in the user's default browser is doable via the \"Open with default browser\" context (right-click) menu :). > I would like [...] all external links [...] opened in the users default browser\n@Blueblau that's clearer, thanks. Could --internal-urls <regex> work for you? See discussion at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/212#issuecomment-292689727 .. @Blueblau should be, yes! And things should work equally well from the CLI vs. programmatically, if they don't it's a bug, and then please share your triggering code for easy reproducing on my side :) .\nBy the way, I have the same request on your bug https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/359 \"Build to folder\", which is also about programmatic usage (this time of the out option): please share your problematic code on #359 (as minimal as possible, better if it's just a few lines of js reproducing the problem), it makes things easier for anyone to test and work on a fix.\nThanks.. @Blueblau can you share a ready-to-run js containing the code triggering the bug, pls? Thanks!. Closing as needing feedback. @Blueblau feel free to chime in with a minimal reproduction script, we'll re-open the discussion \ud83d\ude03.. > \"Would you please guide me! I'd like to work on [proxy support].\"\n@sameersingh7 cool! I honestly have no idea what a proxy feature entails for Nativefier. I can only recommend common sense first development steps: Google for \"electron proxy\" to understand what the proxy story is for Electron, then get a proof of concept working. Note that things may be missing upstream in Electron, you may have to patch stuff up there, too.\nHere's our development.md to get you started with nativefier development.\nGood luck!\n/cc @jiahaog (project initiator): Jia, your additions/tips are welcome \ud83d\ude42. @the4ndy thanks for the feedback! Couldn't reproduce the issue, though, under Windows 10, Node 6.10.2, Nativefier 7.3.1.\nWe do a bad job at showing to users what the current task is, and \"at 80%\" doesn't help isolate what's borked. I suspect the icon/name inferring is failing, can you try the --icon and --name options and report back? For example, save an icon for file.pizza as filepizza.png in the current terminal folder and run:\nnativefier --name filepizza --icon filepizza.png \"https://file.pizza\". Closing as issue wasn't reproducible and didn't get feedback. @the4ndy feel free to chime in and re-open the discussion anytime \ud83d\ude42!. @kevinschaich thanks for the feedback!\nThere's a mismatch between what your title and issue say. Looking at the title, I think I understand you want to force Electron to use the integrated (Intel, power-efficient) GPU rather than your AMD/NVIDIA chip, but Electron/Chrome has no such feature as far as I know (or has it? Correct me if I'm wrong).\nThe request for a --disable-gpu flag remains valid (could be useful e.g. to work around crashy GPU drivers), so renaming the issue and leaving open as feature request. If you insist on the other behavior, I suggest you lobby Chrome for a --force-integrated-gpu / --forbid-discrete-gpu flag.. @kevinschaich thanks for the fast reponse \ud83d\udc4d, that's clearer: you're asking for a --force-integrated-gpu / --forbid-discrete-gpu flag. Would be super neat, agreed, but that doesn't seem likely for now:\n\nReading Electron docs / app.disableHardwareAcceleration(), I think your reading is incorrect. The doc states it \"disables hardware acceleration for current app\", which to me reads any kind of HW acceleration, including your Intel chip. Said differently, it looks like the programmatic equivalent to Chromium flag --disable-gpu, which will force all computation to your CPU, ignoring your Intel chip. Tests/contradictions welcome, though!\nReading https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4380 , it still looks like no such switching feature is exposed by Electron. Commenters seem to be pointing towards helper tools such as gfxCardStatus, mentioned in the Messenger-for-Desktop issue.. @kevinschaich yup, leaving the issue open as is, asking for a --disable-gpu flag that disables acceleration altogether \ud83d\udc4d.. Hi @FinnFrotscher, thanks for the feedback.\n\nBundling Chrome extensions is not supported now (see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/207), but try saving locally the custom CSS and injecting it with option --inject /path/to/your/custom-dropbox-theme.css.. @haris4063 thanks for the feedback, but I cannot reproduce the issue. I just tried nativefier --name \"n-localstorage\" \"http://html5demos.com/storage\" under Nativefier 7.4.0 / electron 1.6.6, both Windows and Linux, and confirm localstorage is persisted across app restart.\nPlease come back with more information (nativefier command, OS, reproduction steps) and we'll reopen the discussion \ud83d\ude42. Hi @lsmith77, thanks for the feedback!\n\nNativefied apps running on macOS already support using a dock icon badge to indicate count of in-app notifications/messages, as long as you pass the --count flag (see nativefier --help for the full list of options). This depends on the page updating the title with digits surrounded by parentheses, for example Facebook (8). Code here, give it a try and please do report back if it's broken \ud83d\ude03.\nRegarding updating the whole dock icon with a favicon, I'm not sure that's a good idea, because the high-quality dock icon you end up with (passed via --icon or inferred via nativefier-icons) might end up being overwritten with a crappy 64x64 favicon, which will look horrible in the dock. Feel free to contradict and we'll re-open the discussion.. Hey @zucher, thanks for the feedback. Would you mind elaborating and providing a test scenario describing the problem? What do you mean by \"release context\"?. @zucher again, sincere thanks for the feedback, but there's little I can do with so little information.\n\nYou must realize no one is paid to maintain this piece of software and there's no customer support to help you do the clarifying job. Your best chance to get what you want is by making the effort of laying out the problem as clearly as possible, to convince us something is wrong, as painfully obviously as possible. So, all these will be very, very welcome: \n\nIssue reproduction scenario\nProblematic nativefier command used\nIntuitions\nProposals\n(And of course, code fixing the problem, but I don't like the typical \"Patch welcome\" response, it's disrespectful as the user may not have the interest/time/knowledge to fix the problem.)\n\nClosing in the meantime, will re-open if you come back with more info.. Hi @arres2k, thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. I just tested Nativefier 7.3.1 and the just-released 7.4.0 under Windows, downloading works. The problem is that download status, completion, and path to downloaded files are completely invisible. We are aware of the problem, it's file as https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/335 . In the meantime, check your OS Downloads folder, your file should be here.\nClosing the issue. Feel free to chime in again if I'm missing anything or with more info (website, command used to build nativefied app) if you're certain there's an actual problem with downloading.. @zucher do you still want to merge this? If yup, please:\n\nfix the lint errors (check for errors with npm run lint)\nrebase (note that https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/417 worked on companyName, you might have conflicts)\nand re-push.. > Is usage of Promise possible ?, in that case, can I move the project to be ES6 compliant ?\n\n@zucher the more ES6, the merrier, as long as our CI passes on Node 4.x (our minimal requirement). @zerosimms thanks for the feedback!\n\nTo recapitulate: the profile icon of your site works fine in Chrome, but doesn't appear in Nativefier. Right?\nYou mentioned already looked at the devtools Console and say that \" it's like that javascript isn't even being called\". What makes you say that? Any JS errors?\nCould you also take a look at the devtools Network tab and see if there are failed requests here?\n\nIf still stuck after confirming the three points above, please share the full nativefier command used, with options. That will help me try to reproduce the problem.. Hey @dipenpatel235, thanks for the feedback! That's a duplicate of known issue https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/353 , closing. In the meantime, you'll have to avoid the --crash-reporter option.. Hey @dipenpatel235, thanks for the feedback! I haven't tried on centos, but that looks clear and reproducible. As a workaround, nativefying for windows under windows should work (if you have a windows machine, of course), and maybe the issue isn't here with other Linux distributions (that's a maybe, I didn't look into it, if you do please share your learnings).\nNote to self or whoever works on this: look at https://github.com/electron/node-rcedit/issues/22 and https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1062 .. > use wine32 in your 64 bit system and it will work. I did that and it worked fine.\n@dipenpatel235 great! Can you be a little more precise about how you were able to \"use wine32 in your 64bit system\"?. Quoting some discussion with @Fmstrat at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/487,\n\n\"When building Windows EXEs on Linux hosts, icons are not supported\" is slightly incorrect. Here's what I just tested with Nativefier 6fb3b92eb82bec77ff96075b28e5e93987e32b9f, Ubuntu 16.04.3, Wine 2.21:\n\nnativefier --arch 'x64' --platform \"windows\" --name \"googwin\" \"https://www.google.ca/\"\n\u2192 Worked, produced an app that worked under Windows 10 with the inferred Google icon.\nnativefier --arch 'x64' --platform \"windows\" --name \"googwin\" --icon /opt/icon-someicon.png \"https://www.google.ca/\"\n\u2192 Worked, produced an app that worked under Windows 10 with my custom icon.\n\nThe remaining, reproduced problem is that rcedit indeed fails under some Linuxes, as documented in #375. Until we properly fix the issue, and given nobody reads READMEs \u2013and it's alright\u2013, the best \"documentation\" for that would be to catch the Bad EXE format exception currently thrown, and instead cleanly abort with a mention of your workaround. Using your example, it could look like this (proposal after the blank line):\n```\nDownloading tmp-1-0-electron-v1.6.6-win32-x64.zip\n[========================>] 100.0% of 52.42 MB (9.53 MB/s)\nPackaging app for platform win32 x64 using electron v1.6.6\nwine: configuration in '/home/node/.wine' has been updated.\nwine: Bad EXE format\nError: setting Windows icon failed due to format incompatibility between wine and rcedit.\nThis is a known issue, see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/375\nWorkaround 1: install the 32bit version of Wine.\nWorkaround 2: grab the latest compiled rcedit from https://github.com/electron/rcedit/releases\nand, on a Windows host, run: rcedit-x64.exe YourExe.exe --set-icon icon.ico\nSorry for the inconvenience, help welcome on the known issue :)\n```\n~And regarding Docker: yeah, given we do control the full stack in our Dockerfile, we c/should do a better job especially in this version, it's just the current Dockerfile was probably never tested on this use case. We should use a distribution/wine/rcedit that we know will work. Help welcome here~ EDIT: done, see PR below.\nPR much welcome for something along those lines \ud83d\ude42.\n. https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/488 should address this in Docker. Still not resolved out of Docker, PR welcome maybe around something like https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/375#issuecomment-344993335. Hey @sameerkumar18, thanks for the feedback! Nativefier has no such \"Save as\" feature for now, sorry. More generally, the current download experience totally sucks, we know about it and track it in https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/335 . I'm enriching the issue with your proposal of a \"Save As\" context menu feature enabling selection of destination folder \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nClosing this bug, do subscribe to https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/335 if you want to follow the discussion.. > Discord has a dynamic favicon that indicates unread status, could there be some way to pull that for the system tray icon?\n@Aidoboy the --counter option already does kind-of-that on macOS in the Dock; yes, would be nice to have similar behavior in this hypothetical tray feature. Regarding updating the whole icon using the app's favicon, that might mean horrible-looking tray icons (favicons are often smaaaall!). Not as ugly as in the (bigger) dock (see discussion at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/367#issuecomment-302695787 ), but staying with --counter's behavior of overlaying a count on the icon (based on a detected number in the page title) might yield better results.\n@jamiewilson @Aidoboy just a note to manage expectations: as long as no one does feature requests, they remain requests. There are lots to do and we're only a few maintainers; if you want to give a stab at implementing this feature, the developer guide awaits you \ud83d\ude42.. Closing this as https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/457 added a --tray flag. I don't think the new flag covers everything discussed in this issue, but it's a start. Please try it, then once familiar it, feel free to discuss missing stuff and we can re-open with a list of incremental improvements. All props go to @omouren for the work on #457.. Seems legit, thanks for the report @gsantner \ud83d\udc4d. As a workaround, non-keypad Ctrl++/-/0 do work, and Zoom In/Out actions (in the View menu) do too.. @Aidoboy thx for the feedback.\nQuestions:\n\nCould you detail what use case / problem led you to this?\nPut differently: what would this feature solve that simply creating a second nativefied app wouldn't?\n\n\nWhat do you mean by \"get another windows that's still part of the same application\"?\nWhat kind of associated behavior would you expect?\n\n\u2192 Given some thought to these questions, would https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/348 - \"Support \"shared runtime\" mode, bundling apps as pure configuration\" be what you're looking for too? Is this fair to consider your bug a duplicate?\nComments:\n\nYou can override the (sometimes weird or incorrect) title inferring it with option --name.. > In the meantime, do you think I could have multiple nativefier executables in the same directory with modified path names but the same --name names? Or maybe soft link cookie directories?\n\n@Aidoboy try it, but \u26a0\ufe0f I wouldn't be surprised to see the separate chrome instances at best stepping on each other toes, at worst corrupting the shared user profile / cookies.. Hi @david-pacheco, thanks for the feedback.\n\nCould this be a duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/25 ?\nWhen this happens, please open the DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I). Any errors in Console? Any failing requests in Network?\n\nAt any rate, please come back with any information that may help understand the problem.. @david-pacheco whoopsie, indeed, I meant https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/252 , not 25.. Closing as I can't reproduce the issue and there isn't much I can do. Feel free to chime in with more info, especially a reproduction scenario on a public website would help.. Duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/28 , closing. @itziks00 thanks for the feedback, pls subscribe to the other bug \ud83d\ude42.. Thanks for the feedback, @petrk94 ! Copy/paste/cut are available from the Edit menu, if you prefer a mouse access to keyboard shortcuts. Regarding adding these to the context menu, I admit I'm not fond of the idea, I'd rather keep the menu uncluttered.\nDisapproval / use cases demonstrating the importance of context menu entries / attempts to convince us to re-open the issue welcome \ud83d\ude42.. @petrk94 no problem, there's nothing angry about your good feedback \ud83d\udc4d. Alright, reopening for the \"it's the expected usability from other browsers\".\nTo anyone working on this: to avoid extra clutter, please no constant cut/copy/paste entries, only what's appropriate to the context (like Firefox/Chrome do).

Otherwise keep your fix expectations low, there's no guarantee someone will work it anytime \ud83d\ude42.. > Is there something like a good documented tutorial where to begin?\n@petrk94 try looking for node.js tutorials/videos, and play with the Electron API.. Fixed by https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/588. @LutzPS yes, you need to ask for Flash manually, see nativefier --help. So,\n\nTry --flash, which will let the builder try to find it on its own...\n... and if it doesn't work, find it yourself (using your favorite filesystem search tool, see inferFlash.js for the filenames to search) and pass it manually.\n\nThis worked for me for my linux machine on Chrome unstable (yours will certainly be different!): nativefier --name \"speedtest\" --disable-dev-tools --show-menu-bar --maximize --disable-context-menu --flash-path \"/home/ronj/.config/google-chrome-unstable/PepperFlash/26.0.0.123/libpepflashplayer.so\" \"http://www.speedtest.net\". Hey @hadifarnoud, thanks for the feedback.\n\nInstall from source, following our development guide, then feel free to fiddle with the template used to build electron app, it lives in the app folder.\nI don't understand your question \"is there a way to cache some files locally\", please precise.. @hadifarnoud \n\n\nthere are some assets like built js files that I'd like to pack inside the application itself.\n\nSee nativefier --help, would the --inject flag do the trick for you?\n\nwould be great to add auto-update stuff in there too\n\nSee https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/291: There's no automatic update: yes a nativefied app is locked to a specific version of Chrome/Electron, which you can specify at build time using the --electron-version option (see nativefier --help for the full list of options, and go to the electron/releases page to pick your favorite stable/beta flavor of Electron poison :) ). There's no plan to change that, as all the machinery for this is part of the nativefier builder and not the nativefied app.. @hadifarnoud that's not supported for now, see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/192. @skoshy thanks for the feedback! Closing, as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/28. @realyze thanks for the feedback! That should be fixed with merged-yesterday-but-yet-to-be-released https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/389 . Try running a development version to get it now, or wait for a release. At any rate, feedback welcome if it's still broken \ud83d\ude42.. @realyze hm okay, reopening. Thanks for the fast feedback \ud83d\udc4d.. Fantasbulous, no worry, take your time to in/confirm things are okay now, and we'll re-open as needed \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\nHey skoshy, since you fixed #28 with #389, do you confirm realyze's bug above? (task manager app name correct but `Launch with` entry still `Electron`). Given your familiarity with what you fixed, any idea if this can be fixed too through `win32metadat`? Patch welcome \ud83d\ude42.\n\n. > I guess #226 maybe?\nYeah, looks like, and #226 was fixed by PR https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/244 but ended up remaining unmerged and needing rebase. If you have the time/knowledge for that and since you can reproduce the current problem and confirm the fix, a rebase of #244 in a new PR would be \ud83d\udcaf  most welcome.. @dipenpatel235 thanks for the feedback! But please be more precise: you say you see \"bad files or viruses messages when used on another pc\".\n\nWhat are these virus messages when used on another PC? Can you share some of them? Maybe logs showing explicitly which file part of nativefier is considered a virus?\nWhich application emits them? An antivirus/antimalware? The OS? Are antivirus/OS and their signatures databases up-to-date?\nWhen are these messages emitted? At install time by your installer, or at run time?\nIf at install time, since you say you are \"creating one exe using Setup Factory / Inno Setup\", are you sure your installer isn't the culprit?. @dipenpatel235 InnoSetup is good. Try NSIS too, or go the Windows native way by creating a MSI.\n\nIn your case, because installers resort to special tricks to minimize file size while remaining executable, your best bet to avoid this kind of false positive is certainly the MSI way. Careful, MSIs are (or at least used to be) complicated, don't try to build one blindly following the documentation, find a good tutorial / tool that helps you. Good luck \ud83d\ude42.. Hi @SinvalMAO, thanks for the feedback! Unfortunately there isn't much we can do with this little information. As requested by the issue template, please provide:\n\nOS, node version, nativefier version.\nFull nativefier command-line used.\nAs much details as possible, every detail you provide is data to help understand faster what's wrong... @febinjoy thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d. Closing, as I'm not sure we as {electron, electron-packager} downstream can do much about it :-/ . Googling a little bit, the error message seems common, so I encourage you to research which of {electron, electron-packager} is the culprit, and report the problem up there. Soooorry; if I'm missing the point, arguments welcome and we can re-open the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, the obvious workaround is to build your app on a Windows 7 machine.. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/335. @nomorechickenstrips thanks for the feedback, closing until you provide more details:\n\nYou mean you'd want all requests to include a specific HTTP header?\nCan you precise a little bit your use case?\nCan you provide examples of how you'd do that in a regular Chrome? Through an extension?\n\nHow are these headers defined? Global? Per domain?. WSL is not supported, but Nativefier runs fine under Windows.. @hanselke thanks for the feedback! Closing, thouth, as that's opposite of the direction followed by nativefier (isolated apps, single window, no tabs, etc). Yes, use your browser \ud83d\ude42. And to achieve \"it would be the one app that i run when i start my daily workflow instead of having to restart all the chrome tabs (which would be used for other stuff as well)\", maybe look at a combination of these to fit your workflow:\n\n\nChrome Extensions\n\nChrome command-line arguments: chrome http://site1.com http://site2.com http://site3.com\nChrome user profiles. > This fork has parameters when building the app to allow signing it: https://github.com/rispig/Nativefier.

I can't reproduce the issue, though, for me nativefier --full-screen \"youtube.com\" successfully remembers full-screen state between restarts. Could you precise your original broken use case? (is it really just the youtube example you're describing? No options other than just --full-screen? If so, maybe it's an OS problem, can test on my side under Windows). Leaving your PR unmerged for now.. > Any hopes of getting this PR fix into the next publish?\n@brianblakely 7.4.1 \ud83c\udfba . Not merging now, see comments at #402.. Hi @dsemaya, thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d. Not sure I want to file this as feature request though, such a feature would be precisely opposed to Nativefier's main goal, which is precisely to bundle applications.\n\nYou have to open a one-time URL?\n\u2192 Use your browser \ud83d\ude42.\nIt's a one-time URL but you want it to be isolated?\n\u2192 Open it in an incognito window in your browser.\nIt's not a one-time URL but a frequently-used app?\n\u2192 Well, nativefy it.\n\nClosing, but feel free to argue if I'm missing your point, and we can re-open.. @dsemaya thanks for the clarification \ud83d\udc4d. Makes sense, now that I know your use case is opening URLs \"for the same app\". Your first-time description sounded like dragging youtube.com on a facebook app, which made no sense.\nRe-opening (which only means the issue is open, no guarantee anyone will work on that).. This issue was mixing two concerns; claryfing them based on feedback from @jancbeck on #604. The two concerns are:\n\nDispatch opening URLs to different browser/apps depending on the URL (matching the domain or a regex/wildcard pattern).\nLinux: I do it with a custom xdg-open script.\nmacOS: use Choosy.\nWindows: I don't know, feedback welcome.\n\n\nLet Nativefied apps accept and open a site passed as parameter. This is what this issud is about and I renamed the issue to make that clear. PR still welcome \ud83d\ude42.. Hi @maheshprabhu2010, check the --single-instance flag \ud83d\ude42.. Hm, indeed, verified. To future self or anyone working on this, --internal-urls isn't even needed, bug is reproducible with nativefier --name gmail mail.google.com\n\nEDIT 2017-11-16 same problem in Hangouts, see original report at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/489 : in nativefier https://hangouts.google.com/ , open a chat and try to pop the chat out by pressing on the arrow as shown below. A blank popup will open.\n. Bug reproduced, thanks for the feedback @dsemaya \ud83d\udc4d.. @JMarteF thanks for noticing \ud83d\ude42, closing the issue then. Regarding...\n\n\"Do you know of any other issues that might be already resolved but still not closed? I'm trying to target some issues but some of them seem to be resolved already.\"\n\n, well I (occasional maintainer for a few years) lost interest in Nativefier since Firefox Containers, so I've been slacking on issue triaging during the last months. Feel free to mention other issues that seem resolved and I'll close them. And go ahead and target anything, all help welcome \ud83d\ude42.\nAnd @bacongravy, your past contributions were of excellent quality, if anything tickles you in Nativefier or if you want to get more involved in some other part of the project, don't hesitate to reach out.. > thanks. do you know when the next release will be published?\n@david-pacheco 7.4.1 \ud83c\udfba . Duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/283 , closing.. @hanselke if electron supports it, yes it might be possible. Out of curiosity, can you precise your use case? What do you want to use this for?. @ajspalma thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d. Two questions:\n\nPlease provide the full nativefier used to build your app, including the address you're nativefying.\nWhat do you mean by \"pdf button where not visible unlike in chrome\"?\nCould your problem be related to #335 ?. @ajspalma I meant full nativefier command, sorry. But that answers the main question, this is a non-public site. Please provide a test scenario failing on a public website. Thanks for the screenshot \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nAlso, check #335, the download should work (it's just not visible) and files should be written to your OS Downloads directory.\nEDIT found https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/123 , if Electron still doesn't support Printing then we're out of luck. Feel free to investigate and come back to us if as of today you find possibilities for printing in an Electron app.. Thanks for sharing this, @iTheCode \ud83d\udc4d. If you have the time to contribute your electron-pdf-viewer-based code as an optional flag, PR very welcome.. @ajspalma thanks for the feedback, but we cannot work without a reproducible test case on a public website. Please provide a minimal reproduction scenario and I'll re-open the ticket.. Closing as duplicate of #283 . @githubbob42 and one last thing in addition to removing package-lock.json: merge of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/244 caused conflicts, can you rebase? Thanks again!. > Hi @ronjouch, rebase it done.  However, should I change the kebab-case of app-version, etc (from #244) to camelCase?  It looks like that was done for the other parameters at some point.  Thanks.\n@githubbob42 nicely observed \ud83d\udc4d. Yas, please.. Fantasbulous @githubbob42, thanks for the last fixes \ud83d\udc4d.. @vegbrasil thanks for the feedback. I doubt --internal-urls is the culprit, it only governs what opens in a tab of your default browser vs. as a nativefier window. Could you dig a little bit more using the bundled DevTools?

(what's your pwd and its permissions?). Closing as issue wasn't reproducible and didn't get feedback. feel free to chime in and re-open the discussion anytime \ud83d\ude42!. @yishn awesome, thanks for the precise report and reproduction scenario \ud83d\udc4d. @tarunbatta yes, we have two flags that control the userAgent:\n\n--honest, which \"prevents the nativefied app from changing the user agent string to masquerade as a regular chrome browser\"\n--user-agent, which does what you expect.\n\nBoth intentionally err on the side of mimicking Chrome by default (because the contrary would cause breakage for websites doing sleazy useragent sniffing), but if you're the one controlling the build and distributing your Windows app, then yes you can set at build time the useragent to something recognizable by your angular webapp. Check nativefier --help for more options.\nOut of curiosity, why do you want to differentiate between a nativefier client vs. a regular browser client?. Thanks @usrbowe ! Merging.. @usrbowe thanks! Merged.. > Will 7.4.1 be pushed to npm soon?\n@jiahaog ? But wait, if it's not done, please don't do it before doing a smoketest.

Does manually passing an icon with --icon /path/to/linkedin-icon.png work around the issue?. Hey @Anthony-K, thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. I think https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/212#issuecomment-292689727 may do the trick for you. If not, chime in and I'll re-open your issue.. @CraigZych thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. We can't do much with this little information, though, please come back with a reproducible scenario on a public site.. @alvarezval thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. We'll need more information to troubleshoot, though.

So, PR welcome, for both this bug and #335 \ud83d\ude42.. @kidoman thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d. Not sure I understand the feature request, though, can you reformulate it, and give an example use case?. @kidoman I think I understand you want nativefier apps to get an \"Always on top\" window flag. To me that sounds like a Window Manager's responsibility, and not the job of Nativefier.\n\nWindows: Google lists several solutions.\nLinux: it's just one wmctrl -r \"window title\" -b add,above away\nmacOS: seems to be more involved, but \"afloat\" seems to do the job. > \"the solution which you linked will only work for certain apps which support SIMBL\"\n\n@kidoman does that include the current version of nativefier? (Put differently, is the afloat solution applicable to a nativefied app?) But I get your point, the straightforwardness of a build-time --always-on-top flag makes sense. So, PR welcome \ud83d\ude42.. @AlanDu50 thanks for the feedback; closing as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/342#issuecomment-293705472. Quoting:\n\nIt would be awesome, yeah. But I'll close this for now, it's three levels of needs-upstream-fix away :-/\n\nIt would be upstream's (electron-packager) job, who closed https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/issues/243 \"How can I create self-contained executables in Windows and GNU/Linux?\", passing the ball to their upstream electron...\n... and electron closed their https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/914 \"Atom & App in one executable\"...\n... with these words about their own upstream (Chromium):\n\n\n\"The structure of Chromium is not designed for putting everything into an executable, and it would take too much effort to do that.

Thanks for the feedback @netconstructor. I understand your use case; a nativefied app with built-in JRE support would be neat to support this old app. But no, we have no JRE support, and with the direction taken by the web (as you mention: even Chrome itself, which Nativefier depends on, it actively going against it), we don't plan to add any.\nIf I was in your shoes, I'd try packaging a specially configured Firefox (forcing a home page to the your website, blocking updates in about:config, activating Java, hiding urlbar and other browser widgets with userChrome.css). Good luck.. Closing as duplicate of #440. @mikhoul, yes, the pull request you linked to seems to add Widevine support, it may be part of the next release.. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/375. @ChrisKendallVA thanks for the feedback! But there's little we can do with little of your help :-/ . Please provide a reproducible test scenario and we'll re-open:\n\nWhat cache are we talking about?\nWhich website?

I don't see this feature in 7.4.1.\"\n\nCorrect. Just wait for 7.4.2 (may come soon, I just asked the project owner for a release), or build your nativefier from master (it's not that hard/long!), following the development setup guide.. @GitGeoCoder thanks for the feedback. Yup, as you said you just need a few Electron files (named something like electron-v1.6.6-win32-x64.zip and SHASUMS256.txt-1.6.6) cached to build Nativefier apps without internet (I just checked, it works). \nOn my Linux machine, these files live at ~/.cache/electron, on your Windows machine they should be somewhere around C:\\Users\\youruser\\AppData\\Local(maybeLocalLow?)\\electron (but maybe I'm wrong, in that case look for them \u2013I recommend Everything for fast NTFS search\u2013, and look for electron-v).\nSo: build from a machine with internet access, find and note the electron cache path, copy the files, and dump them to your offline build machine. Should work. I'm renaming this issue to suggest properly handling lack of connectivity (exiting rather than hanging, and mentioning the electron cache path). Thanks for the suggestion \ud83d\udc4d.. @GitGeoCoder \n\nThanks for the quick response. Problem solved.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d, thanks too for confirming. Hey by the way, what was the path for Electron cached files in Windows?\n\nBTW, which version of Electron should be downloaded? Latest or depend on the version of Nativefier?\n\nFor my apps (feedly, gmail) I always roll with the latest/beta Electron release. I feel that upgrades become tricky for developers building big apps on top of the Electron platform (e.g. VS Code, Atom, Slack, Skype). But nativefier apps are much more modest, we're just packaging a web view and don't use a ton of platform APIs, which means small breakage potential.\nSo, we default to a stable Electron (currently 1.6.6, which we should upgrade to the latest 1.6.x one of these days), but it shouldn't be dangerous for you to try 1.7.x or even 1.8.x to get the latest fixes and Chrome engine. Pick your stability/hotness mix; if you get adventurous and see broken stuff, please report it!. > Is there is configuration for nativefier to download/use a specific version of electron?\n@GitGeoCoder you're looking for flag --electron-version. Without it, nativefier defaults to a hardcoded known-to-work stable version of Electron (currently, as you said, 1.6.6). Check nativefier --help for the full list of supported flags.. @frlinw thanks for the feedback. Looking at your partial screenshot, it looks like the website you're nativefying does this. Nativefier has no control over what websites do (or maybe look at --inject, you might be able to manually hide this square for your website). If I'm wrong and this behavior exists on all your nativefied apps, then please come back with the minimum details requested by the issue template.\nWith that, closing, but will re-open if you find the time to bring details. Cheers!\n. @frlinw can't reproduce here:\n\n\u2192 I need your help to isolate the problem:\n\nCan you try on another machine?\nOn another OS?\nOn another Electron version (e.g. try --electron-version 1.8.0)\n\"If it's related to my app, I should see the square in my browser too, no ?\" \u2192 Yup. But does it happen if you nativefy other websites (e.g. try nativefying google.com, same?). @frlinw hm, thanks for the prompt feedback. That leaves us with a machine/configuration or OS-specific bug. Leaving this closed as it's tough to dig much deeper, but feel free to add anything you think worth mentioning. \u00af\\(\u30c4)/\u00af\n\nOther suggestions: got up-to-date drivers? Could anything (malware / anti-malware) be injecting stuff?. @GitGeoCoder thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d, but an app you can use to navigate by pointing at an URL sounds a lot like a browser to me \ud83d\ude42. Say you build an app you call \"gmail\", with an associated url and icon and name, which then the user points at hotmail. Confusion ensues. Or else the \"rewriting\" should enable the user to change all the metadata in addition to the URL (app name, path, icon), which at this point means the app should basically be able to rebuild itself, which sounds like a big invasive change we don't want.\nNativefier's whole purpose is precisely to package and fixate an app to an URL. Closing as wontfix, but feel free to argue and detail use cases you have in mind.. > Is is possible Nativefier cached the package somewhere, my change to the menu wasn't taken when packaging again?\n@GitGeoCoder nope there's no local state apart from what's in ~/.config/<yourappname>-nativefier-<someid> (cookies, cache, window state). You probably omitted to rebuild nativefier itself before re-building your app. See our developer docs.\n\nThere could be multiple instances of the same server in a private LAN. In case one server instance is not functioning, the user would like to switch to another.\n\nTo me, that's the problem deserving fixing, via your IT (some routing / reverse proxy solution dispatching requests to whatever instance is available). I stand by the feeling that supporting what you're asking for goes against Nativefier core promise. You're asking for genericity to an app whose first selling point is simplicity/fixed-ness: \"Make any web page a desktop application\". It's not a generic browser, it's made to not be a generic browser, so if you need generic, well, use a browser \ud83d\ude42.. > I have tried if move the Nativefier directory into the node_modules directory of nodejs installation, then no error message when building.  Is it required to be in the nodemodules directory?\n@GitGeoCoder nope, not sure what's going on with your setup :-/ . I just tested a build on a Windows 10 machine and Node 8.5.0, all smooth.. > Where the lib directory come from?\nIt is created at CLI build time; https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/master/gulp/helpers/src-paths.js#L7. > Otherwise, developer will be misleaded by thinking Node >4.0 should work. Actually, it's not.\nREADME states we support Node 4.x, and we have continuous integration that tests all builds under 4.x (example build). You must be stumbling on a more specific bug (maybe the Windows + Node 4.x combo? I'll try it). Thanks for the report \ud83d\udc4d.. @GitGeoCoder failing build on Windows + Node 6.11.3 reproduced, thanks. It fails on a parsing issue with mime-db\\db.json, and when googling at it, it looks like the culprit is npm. For me, upgrading npm with npm install -g --upgrade npm got me npm 5.4.2, which correctly installed our deps, and npm run build was successful. Could you give it a try (please scrap the node_modules, app/node_modules folders before) and confirm?\n@jiahaog looks like old npms suck at handling modules in the dependency tree have the same dependency (just repeating stuff I read in one of the issues found at the aforementioned Google search, I haven't investigated it further). Given the build does work even for old npms under Linux, it would suck to force a recent npm, and I like the fact that we only require a node version. Any ideas apart from adding a warning to README.md and development.md?\nTangentially, I love package-lock.json for the locking, but I hate it for making pull requests management more painful (inevitable conflicts, have to rework the lock file them before merging). \n\nWould we consider going back to non-locked dependencies (but at least with strict direct deps, i.e. 1.2.3 and no ^1.2.3) ? (Real question, not a suggestion, it's probably a Bad Idea \u00a9)\n\nAlternatively, do you have convenience tips to handle package-lock.json in projects like ours?\n\nIf we stick with them, having a master push bit would ease up the job for me, as I could \"accept\" lock-changing PRs by closing them, cloning them locally, adding the package-lock.json babysitting commit and merging that.. @GitGeoCoder sure! Awesome you found a solution \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude42.. @princejosuah sadly, can't reproduce the issue here. Can you:\n\n\n\nTry with a recent Electron, e.g,. --electron-version 1.8.0\n\nOpen the DevTools (Cmd+Shift+I) and paste here any error in the Console + any failing Network requests?. > I've opened the dev tools (Cmd + Opt + I finally) but in the browser (Opera 46), right ? There's no such thing in the nativefied app.\n\n@princejosuah no, I need you to open the DevTools in the Nativefied app. Devtools should work here with the same Command+Option+I, and should look similar to the ones in Opera. Can you retry? You won't put anything upside down, and if you do, it's only transient (your modifications won't survive an app restart).. @princejosuah any aborted (red) requests in the Network tab?. > No request in the Network tab, totally empty.\n@princejosuah hmmm, certainly because you opened the DevTools after page finished loading \ud83d\ude42. With the devtools open, refresh the page with Cmd+R. Still no requests?. >Name : www.youtube.com, Status : (failed), Type : document, Initiator : Other, Size : 0B, Time : 5ms.\n\nI don't know if it helps...\n\n@princejosuah it does, and having this first row show Status: (failed) and Size : 0B is 101% anormal. Can you click that failed line and report/screenshot the full details (headers, response) of the request/response panel that will display on the right?. Closing as I can't reproduce the issue (tried multiple configs and multiple OSes), there isn't much I can do. May be something specific to your machine :-/ . Feel free to chime in with more info..

Hi and thanks for the feedback, but there isn't much we can do with this little information. This project is a hobby with few maintainers at the wheel, helping during spare time. Do not expect \"customer support\"-style interaction; we need you to investigate as much as possible before opening an issue: try to narrow it as much as possible, provide the minimum details requested by the issue template, intuitions, a reproducible scenario, etc: help us help you \ud83d\ude42, maintainers are not wizards and do not read your mind. Of course, the best you can provide is code, PR very welcome.\nWith that, closing, but will re-open if you find the time to bring details. Cheers!\nText inspired by uBlock's CONTRIBUTING.md. @jplot merci du retour \ud83d\udc4d. Before I give a try at reproducing the issue, one wording nit: when you say \"deteriorated\", are you saying Nativefier regressed? (Said differently, did it use to work? If yes, when and any idea when it started mangling data?) Thanks.. > No it does not work, from the second file inject it corrupts inject.js\n@jplot I get that, but my question is: has it already worked in an earlier version of Nativefier?. Still not clear, please make a complete sentence.. @Null-Senpai use the --internal-urls flag. Quoting https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/212#issuecomment-292689727 ,\n\n--internal-urls <value>:  regular expression of URLs to consider \"internal\"; \n                          all other URLs will be opened in an external browser.\n                          (default: URLs on same second-level domain as app)\n\nSet it to a gibberish regex that will never match, and no link will be considered 'internal', forcing opening in browser\nSet it to a match-all regex like .*, and all links should be considered 'internal', forcing in-app navigation.. @Null-Senpai ah sorry, I triaged your issue quickly based solely on the title, which I misunderstood.

PR welcome.. @filippobuletto thank you for the report. Smells like npm barfing like another user noticed at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/451#issuecomment-331230913 . Could you try one of those:\n\nEither adding a RUN npm install -g --upgrade npm to the dockerfile\nOr simply using node 8 with FROM node:8-alpine, which uses and unbarfed npm 5.x. @Gregory-K seems legit, and feasible (just check Electron based Skype and Slack, they both do what you are describing).. @parkerlreed I don't understand, please clarify/reformulate..

Glad it works for you!. > I found that it's possible to inject own js/css file. But I have a poor knowledge of javascript. Can you help me to write script to scale page on mouse scroll?\n@AndreWin client-side JS (either page or nativefier user-injected js) won't let you zoom the page, that's browser responsibility and should be patched at Nativefier level. Try to patch nativefier then \ud83d\ude42, bootstrap a development environment following the dev docs, then maybe start looking at how the context menu is set up to a right click, and try to set up a similar handler for Ctrl+Mousewheel. The Electron docs will help.. @nlevin yeah we have trouble with OAuth logins, sorry about that :-/ .

There isn't much we can do with this little information. Help us help you; please detail what you need in a precise and reproducible way.. @sogen yeah, confirmed, I've experienced similar weirdness too. Here I'm working around the problem by never touching the in-app zoom controls, and only relying on build-time --zoom flag.. Hi @cwensel, thanks for the feedback.\n--show-menu-bar has no effect on macOS, no, as under this OS the menu bar is always visible, at the top of the screen. Under Windows and Linux, though, the menu bar will appear at the top of the window (constantly with the --show-menu-bar flag, and without it the bar remains invisible but accessible when the Alt key is pressed).\nRegarding the request for an address bar and tabs, minimal UI is a goal for nativefier; navigation should be done in-app, using the app features. Nativefier's goal is not to re-build a web browser, web browsers are good at that. Its goal is precisely to cut down on browser UI to focus the experience to one app, and let the app do its best at letting the user navigate.. @cwensel \n\nfor an single page app like Gmail, the current model works quite well. for Google Drive, having tabs is very helpful as the root page is a list of artifact that one wants to edit. editing multiple artifacts simultaneously is helpful (think Pages or Word docs, one app, multiple windows).\n\nTrue! I myself use Nativefier principally for Gmail and Feedly, and I wouldn't want to use Gdocs or GitHub or JIRA in Nativefier. But (to me!) that's fine: Nativefier is good for some apps that fit well a single-screen model (Gmail, Feedly, Whatsapp, Spotify, etc). Web apps not fitting that model and centered on individual documents deserving tabs can stay in the browser and it's alright \ud83d\ude42. Starting adding an URL bar and tabs feels like a teeming bag of worms leading to (badly) re-implementing a browser. I don't want that, and I'm only a maintainer here but I strongly feel it breaks core qualities (simplicity, minimalism) of Nativefied apps.\n\nthe address bar makes it easy to copy/paste an url (outof/into) the app [...] and having an url to copy (paste) is useful when sharing links\n\nNote that:\n\nTo copy the current URL: Menu \u2192 Edit \u2192 Copy Current URL (or its Cmd+L keyboard shortcut).\nTo copy a link's URL: right-click the link, and \"Copy link location\"\n\n\nthanks for all the work. I love the tool.\n\nAppreciated! Thanks for the nice words \ud83d\ude42.. Hey ho @chrisgross, thanks for the interest and feedback \ud83d\ude42.\nWould be neat yes, but closing, as depending on upstream https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/869 who acknowledge the issue/request \"since there are lots of requests of it, but it doesn't not indicate we are going to work it.\". @desimaniac thanks for the feedback.

It's been a long time since 7.4.1, could you cut a new release? Here's a readymade summary for the release notes and to update changelog.md \ud83d\ude42:\n- Add `--tray` flag to let app running in background on window close. Supports in-title counter. (Issue #304, PR #457)\n- Add HTTP `--basic-auth-{username,password}` flags (Issue #275, PR #444)\n- Add offline build detection and advice (Issue #448, PR #452)\n- Add 'Paste and Match Style' to Edit menu (Issue #404, PR #447)\n- Add setting environment variables (PR #419)\n- Add `app-copyright`, `app-version`, `build-version`, `version-string` and `win32metadata` flags (Issue #226, PR #244)\n- Fix: Make title counter regex match '+' after number, used by certain sites (PR #424). @lerayne thanks for the feedback. Not a bug, the --tray flag is simply super recent and not released yet to npm \ud83d\ude42. Check nativefier --help in your 7.4.1, you'll see it's not here.\nSo just wait for 7.4.2 (should come soon, I asked yesterday the project owner for a release), or build your nativefier from master (it's not that hard/long!), following the development setup guide.. @BirkhoffLee eeeeeh I don't know. It would be great for nativefier to support spitting finer logging when an environment variable is set. Without that it's difficult to troubleshoot.\nIn your case, I don't understand who makes a request to localhost (127.0.0.1) on HTTPS (port 443),  and why.

As discussed above, pinging a few Nativefier contributors having shown interest in the past with issue reports or pull requests.\nHello everybody and sorry for the noise \ud83d\ude42. This PR I just merged as 6fb3b92 updates all Nativefier deps, including Electron. If you still use Nativefier and have a few spare cycles to contribute, could you build master, re-package your apps, and report regressions here? If you do, please report the usual debug info (OS, URL, errors, flags used, etc). Thanks!\n@desimaniac @GitGeoCoder @princejosuah @cbess @brianblakely @omouren @mdh34 @githubbob42 @xldrx @onedr0p @usrbowe @david-pacheco @romo-dw @skoshy @darrenhaken @toschneck @zbicin. Of course, do tell me if you no longer have interest/time in nativefier and don't want to hear from me again.. @AABatteries thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. You're confusing http basic auth with cookie-based web authentication, which is what this site (and most of websites) uses. Here's an example of a site using HTTP basic auth: https://www.httpwatch.com/httpgallery/authentication/ , and here is what an http-basic-auth login prompt currently looks like in Nativefier:\n\nIn your case, no need for --basic-auth-{username,password} flags; just login normally in the nativefied app, then if OnShape responds with a cookie following login, it will be stored by Nativefier/Electron, and you'll be logged in when you re-run the nativefied app. I'm using Gmail and Feedly this way, it's working fine in 7.5.1.. > \"I am unable to get the login to persist through closing and opening the app again. I am brought to the login screen again with blank fields, does that mean that Electron is not storing the cookie? How can I debug/troubleshoot?\"\n@AABatteries first,\n\nDoes Chrome remember the login?\n\nAre you able to get known-to-remember-login (e.g. gmail) websites work as expected in Nativefier?. @AABatteries then it's OnShape's job to implement that (or maybe they intentionally didn't for some reason, maybe regulatory); maybe try to contact them. As for autofill, Nativefier doesn't have that feature, sorry.. @Noedel-Man --tray is new in nativefier 7.5.1, please upgrade your 7.4.0 \ud83d\ude42.. Bug reproduced in nativefier 7.5.1 under Windows 10 / node 8.9.1, with minimal nativefier --name allo --tray --electron-version 1.7.9 \"https://allo.google.com/web\", thanks @apersonnamedmike \ud83d\udc4d. It's Windows-specific, no problem under Linux or macOS.. Pinging original feature author (from PR https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/457). @omouren, if you have the time/will to look at this Windows-specific failure of --tray, help welcome \ud83d\ude42.. @Fmstrat thanks for the feedback. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/375, feel free to look at discussion there.. @Fmstrat thanks for the followup! To be clear, your claim \"When building Windows EXEs on Linux hosts, icons are not supported\" is slightly incorrect. Here's what I just tested with Nativefier 6fb3b92eb82bec77ff96075b28e5e93987e32b9f, Ubuntu 16.04.3, Wine 2.21:\n\n\nnativefier --arch 'x64' --platform \"windows\" --name \"googwin\" \"https://www.google.ca/\"\n\u2192 Worked, produced an app that worked under Windows 10 with the inferred Google icon.\n\nnativefier --arch 'x64' --platform \"windows\" --name \"googwin\" --icon /opt/icon-someicon.png \"https://www.google.ca/\"\n\u2192 Worked, produced an app that worked under Windows 10 with my custom icon.\n\nThe remaining, reproduced problem is that rcedit indeed fails under some Linuxes, as documented in #375. Until we properly fix the issue, and given nobody reads READMEs \u2013and it's alright\u2013, the best \"documentation\" for that would be to catch the Bad EXE format exception currently thrown, and instead cleanly abort with a mention of your workaround. Using your example, it could look like this (proposal after the blank line):\n```\nDownloading tmp-1-0-electron-v1.6.6-win32-x64.zip\n[========================>] 100.0% of 52.42 MB (9.53 MB/s)\nPackaging app for platform win32 x64 using electron v1.6.6\nwine: configuration in '/home/node/.wine' has been updated.\nwine: Bad EXE format\nError: setting Windows icon failed due to format incompatibility between wine and rcedit.\nThis is a known issue, see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/375\nWorkaround 1: install the 32bit version of Wine.\nWorkaround 2: grab the latest compiled rcedit from https://github.com/electron/rcedit/releases\nand, on a Windows host, run: rcedit-x64.exe YourExe.exe --set-icon icon.ico\nSorry for the inconvenience, help welcome on the known issue :)\n```\nPR much welcome for something along those lines \ud83d\ude42, and I quoted our discussion over at @375, feel free to keep the discussion going there.\n\nRegarding Docker: ~yeah, given we do control the full stack in our Dockerfile, we c/should do a better job especially in this version, it's just the current Dockerfile was probably never tested on this use case. We should use a distribution/wine/rcedit that we know will work. Help welcome here also, and other users mention Docker over at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/375#issuecomment-304279114.~ EDIT: done, see PR below.. @Fmstrat \ud83d\ude42.

As far I I know, Alpine doesn't have multiarch, preventing us from fixing #375 by installing a 32bit Wine package under a 64bit OS. So I went with Debian, which supports this..

Cheers.. Hi @pixelass, thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d. Can you globally yarn-uninstall nativefier and test installing it with npm instead?. @pixelass nativefier should definitely be available through npm. npm5 < 5.5.1 is seriously barfed in many ways, can you first npm install -g npm@5.5.1 ? (That doesn't change it looks like installing through yarn is broken, but just first checking with you a normal install works).. @mdking117 hi.

Are you behind a proxy/VPN?. @jingle0927 looks like a duplicate of #479 to me, please follow discussion there. In the meantime, here's a workaround that could work: download your desired electron version, and place it where our packager will look for it.

When I run it on my VM, it works fine, but only creates a package for linux\"\n@rkorebrits it is, you'll need WINE, and we also have rcedit trouble there ( https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/375 ), but give it a try. You'll want to use flag --platform windows to enforce a target that is not the same as the build host.. @rkorebrits yeah that's exactly #375. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af and patches welcome.. @hrdwdmrbl can you retry with a recent version of Nativefier / electron?

Two thoughts:\n\nMaybe you can implement your desired functionality using our script/css injection features. See our documentation for --inject.\nOr maybe the behavior you're expecting ought to be implemented in the webapp itself. The recent and awesome ServiceWorker API comes to mind, it lets webapp developers intercept / play with / replace http requests.\n\nClosing, but feel free to chime in if I'm missing something that you feel is still missing from Nativefier, and I'll reopen the issue. If you do so, please bring as much detail as possible to explain what you're expecting. Thanks :). Thanks for the feedback, @ekimia. No, for now we don't support bundling Chrome extension, and it's unlikely to come soon, given upstream (electron) position on this, see discussion at #207 . @mdh34 cool, thanks! Merging.. @khaninejad thanks for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d, but I couldn't reproduce the problem here with the \"Print thread\" feature of Gmail, nativefied on Linux / Node 9.3.0 / Nativefier 7.5.4. Please provide the problematic website and steps to issue reproduction.. @jingle0927 if the nativefied app runs but no longer does after being packaged by electron-installer-debian, then you should ask electron-installer-debian people, not Nativefier. When you do so, providing the text contents of the .desktop file will certainly help.. @JLIT0 not now, no, but contributions welcome \ud83d\ude42.. @shootsoft thanks for the feedback.\n\nIf I understand correctly your \"plugins loaded before loading the web site\", we have this, see docs for --inject.\nAnd if you're asking about packaging Chrome extensions, see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/207. @smnetres thanks for the feedback.

Tweak the options parsing so that your modified tray option contains your start-in-tray value.\nAt this point, when building an app, your app/nativefier.json should contain a \"tray\": \"start-in-tray\" key/value pair.\nThen, update the runtime code app/src/main.js to start minimized when adequate. Look at main.js, lines 105-108. See how currently we mainWindow = createMainWindow(appArgs, app.quit, setDockBadge); ? I guess we should do something a little different here, research the Electron API to make it start minimized.\n\nHope that helps!

Can you try to isolate the problem by comparing to another machine?. > \"I can't run the binary under my Ubuntu 17.10 VM\".\n@TGotwig nothing wrong with that. Dynamically-linked Linux binaries are not upwards-compatible (and that's why if you distribute them, you usually compile on the oldest CentOS VM that can run your software). Just re-build your app from the VM.. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/422. > \"I think this is due to web.telegram.org not showing a counter in the title bar which is required for the counter to work.\"\nYup, the current mechanism is simply looking for something like (18) in the page title (which is a common convention).\nSo, @frapporti you could --inject a script that fetches that counter from wherever else it lives, and updates the page title.. Glad you like it! Chrome extensions aren't supported (yet?), see #506 .. @sgroh thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42.

I was asking because, from your comment https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/549#issuecomment-370585859 I had understood you planned to rely on some electron-modal third-party module, so it seemed fishy to not see it as new dependency.

Two questions for you:\n\nPlease post the full nativefier command you used to build your app.\nCan you open C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\nativefier\\lib\\cli.js in Notepad (or any other editor) and paste here the contents of lines 10 to 30?\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude42.\n. @basu90 hm, your command works for me.\nCan you edit C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\nativefier\\lib\\cli.js and, in the parseJson function, below if (!val) return {};, add this: console.log('========== trying to JSON.parse', val);\nThe updated function will look like:\njs\nfunction parseJson(val) {\n  if (!val) return {};\n  console.log('========== trying to JSON.parse \"', val, '\"');\n  return JSON.parse(val);\n}\nThen re-run your nativefier command: on which value did JSON.parse choke on?. Alright. Maybe you passed a single quote in here, making it invalid JSON. Closing, feel free to chime in if the problem comes back, and I'll re-open \ud83d\ude42.. @basu90 yup \ud83d\ude42. Or you can have double quotes in single quotes: --file-download-options '{\"saveAs\": true}'. @mattdrose awesome \ud83d\ude42! Thanks for the addition, merging.\nUsual merge reminder: your new code won't be be immediately usable by regular npm users until we release a new version, which we do every few months. Until then, you can keep using your development build that you hopefully npm linked.. Fixed with loglevel 1.5.0, which we use as we specify ^1.6.1. @LeoIannacone what do you mean?. @LeoIannacone ah, spellchecking. It's not supported, unfortunately. Feel free to follow discussion at #283 . @crimsoncrust does passing a --name \"ranchhand\"  option work around your issue? See https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/567 . Also, in which folder are you doing the building, and does passing the output directory help? (so, for example, nativefier --name \"ranchhand\" https://www.ranchhand.com /tmp/ranchhand). @crimsoncrust can you then try passing explicitly a PNG icon as --icon ? Say you downloaded an icon (png format) as /Users/crimsoncrust/ranchhand.png, then try nativefier --name \"ranchhand\" --icon \"/Users/crimsoncrust/ranchhand.png\" https://www.ranchhand.com /tmp/ranchhand. @crimsoncrust thanks for confirming! I don't have a Mac for testing and got a few similar reports. Good to know where the issue is, and have a workaround. Cheers!. Re-opening. Recent changes thanks to @bacongravy might help with that (thanks!). @pixelass please try running the latest dev build, or wait for the next release \ud83d\ude42.. True, duplicate of #405. Closing that one.. @edirpedro nativefier is made to bundle a url, and it (sometimes) does it well. We don't aim at replicating a browser. If you need browser features, use a browser and, yes, your OS shortcut capabilities \ud83d\ude42.. @wiryonolau thanks for the feedback. Could you be having the same problem as https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/545 ?. > \"I don't need to fill any form, it just cannot exit after open\"\n@wiryonolau a form doesn't have to be visible. Dirty forms are the de-facto mechanism to block exiting an app, and we don't handle it properly. I'm pretty sure that's the problem, so, closing, please follow #545 and feel free to re-open if I'm wrong and you find some other bug is causing the issue.\n\n\"Check on other app like Portainer, it's work normally.\"\n\nI know, I use myself Gmail in Nativefier, and have the problem once in a while, and other apps like Feedly never exhibit it.. @austin-guevara yup, totally possible using Electron options. Passersby, that's an easy thing to add, check the Electron doc and see that PR for an example of adding a similar flag.. Ah, forgot it was already requested in https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/35 . @austin-guevara please follow discussion there. Closing.. @bacongravy I have a few issues with this. By order of priority,\n\nThat would be a huge feature making nativefier \"behave more like a browser\". I get a lot of requests nudging us to go in that direction, and my response is often that what makes Nativefier great (to me at least) is that it's not like a browser, it's simpler and with less UI in the way. To put it bluntly: if you need the bells and whistles of a browser, use a browser \ud83d\ude42. With that in mind,\nI'm only a maintainter doing issue triage and PR reviews. I'll defer acceptance of that major feature to @jiahaog. Jia, what do you think?\nI think tabs should be invisible when only one is open (so that user that don't want them don't see them). Is that the case?\nI don't have a Mac to test its current shape. Screenshots, please.\n\n\nI don't think we'll want such a major feature only on one platform (macOS). If we add tabs, they have to work on mac, windows, linux.\nFeel free to separate work on native tabs from context-menu work, which seems to have value on its own. I'll merge fast your context-menu stuff and you'll be able to rebase on it and keep iterating on tabs. \u2665 to small, contained pull requests.\nSince this is Electron 1.8.x only, we'll want guards to error and exit early if nativeTabs && electronVersion < 1.8. Also, that would justify a new major release.\n\n@bacongravy is my message 101% clear? What do you think? Thanks again for your recent PRs, and let's take our time on that one.. @bacongravy that's a totally shitty unreasonable heuristic \ud83d\ude04. Some 25 lines functions deserve to be, and splitting them to two 13 lines functions won't help. Ignore it (that won't prevent me from merging), I'll tweak codeclimate.yml later.. @jiahaog \ud83d\udc4d, and \ud83d\udc4d to trying to avoid additional options. Regarding behavior, @bacongravy what's the default/current state? If you have the time for that, a GIF would be awesome, and I'll spin a macOS VM to test your PR.\nFinally, I maintain that's a big feature that we'd want supported across all our supported platforms. I get tabs come for free with Electron's recent support macOS native tabs, and making it cross-platform means more work and 3rd-party libraries, but I wouldn't want to alienate half the userbase with a big feature inaccessible to them.. @bacongravy thanks for the screenshots!\n\n\"As implemented in the current PR, the default behavior is that the feature is not enabled. When it is enabled, a new context menu item is added, and new menu items are added to the View and Window menus for managing the tab bar, navigating between tabs, and collecting all open windows into a single tabbed window. The tab bar itself does not appear until after either a tab is created for the first time, or the user chooses to display it using the Show Tab Bar menu item.\"\n\n@bacongravy that looks neat and unintrusive, \ud83d\udc4d.\n\n\"I personally don't see a downside to making this feature always enabled for darwin and would happily remove the --enable-native-tabs option from this PR if that's the desired direction.\"\n\n\ud83d\udc4d to that too.. @bacongravy tested and merged! Thanks for the initiative and effort \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. I changed my mind regarding Windows/Linux: better have macOS users enjoying the feature, and maybe Windows/Linux will get it someday if/when Electron adds support for them, or if a contributor adds support using a good enough 3rd-party package \ud83d\ude42.. @poliva thanks for the feedback. We intentionally did not add a flag, because that seemed to us desirable behavior for everyone, and because Nativefier already has a looooooot of flags. Can you explicit why you ask for a flag, or what workflow of yours we broke :wink: ? Thanks.. @kingok you should be able to disable developer tools and context menu using the flags for that, yes. Can you precise where you are stuck and what do you mean by \"obfuscate\" and \"that users can't edit them\" ?. Nativefier has no support for that.. @bacongravy can you elaborate a bit on that one? What are the contents of that folder? Could granting read+execute to everyone let an attacker read something s\u00b7he shouldn't? Any other solution?. @bacongravy makes sense, was asking just to be sure as I'm not familiar with this. Thanks for the fast response, merging  \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\ude42 :100: .. @bacongravy, thanks for the multiple contributions! I'm reviewing them, more feedback to come on the other ones.\nUsual merge reminder: your new code won't be be immediately usable by regular npm users until we release a new version, which we do every few months. Until then, you can keep using your development build that you hopefully npm linked.. @bacongravy I changed the scripts shebangs to use bash. Do you still have things to do (asking because of the [WIP] PR title) or can I merge?. Merged! Thanks @bacongravy, grrreat work \ud83d\udc4d.. @mhingston yup \ud83d\udc4d, our download experience totally sucks. Help/code on #335 welcome if you have the time for that \ud83d\ude42.. @bacongravy thanks for the breaking changes review \ud83d\ude42! BTW I'm also using 2.0.0-beta.7, so far so good.\n\n\"We may also want to update the other project dependencies at the same time we update to Electron 2.0.\"\n\n\u2192 Yup. Currently there isn't much that is outdated, only electron-packager, which should be bumped to 12.0.1. Upgrades are usually smooth, just look at the breaking changes in electron-packager/releases.. 2.0.0 is out! @bacongravy I'll push a last 1.8.x release soon including your recent fixes, and then let's roll with this. In the meantime let's keep testing 2.x with -e 2.0.0.. @bacongravy awesome, merging \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c.. Hi @vhkpanjani . This is Nativefier, the software IBM Verse is based on. We Nativefier have no control on fixing IBM Verse. Please contact the support for IBM Verse with your problem, and please also tell them we'll welcome a patch to customize the \"Help \u2192 Report an issue\" link. Thanks \ud83d\ude42.. @bacongravy would https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/408 be due to that?. @bacongravy \n\nChildren window no longer close on closing parent window, that fixes https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/439 . Awesome \ud83d\ude42.\nI got a crash opening a GoogleCal window from Gmail. Never had one before. Have you ever had crashes?\nI checked how Gmail's \"Open in new window\" feature works with this. Like before ( https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/408 ), it opens a blank window, but in addition to that it opens a dialog saying \"Grrr! A popup blocker may be preventing the application from opening the page. If you have a popup blocker, try disabling it to open the window\". Ideas?\nRegarding Travis builds failing, yeah it's freshly-out-of-the-oven npm@6.0.0 having dropped support for Node 4 and 7: \"BREAKING SUPPORTED NODE VERSIONS: Per our supported Node.js policy, we're dropping support for both Node 4 and Node 7, which are no longer supported by the Node.js project\". I tamed travis to stay on 5.8, your next builds should pass!. > \"I have not seen crashes from secondary windows (but I've only tested on macOS). Do you have steps to reproduce?\"\n\n@bacongravy Clicking on the \"More details\" link of the Google Calendar sidebar gadget for Gmail. But ignore that, I only saw it once. Was just checking with you if that rang a bell.\n. Merged! One more :+1: , @bacongravy \ud83d\ude42. Hi @danielyli, thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. Does Chrome do something similar?. > \"Does that prevent Nativefier from doing it?\"\n@danielyli nope, just asking as a point of reference for behavior.. Thanks @skylundy ! Looks like https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1518 , we'll probably have more of such reports, I guess Debian/Ubuntu are stopping installing libgconf by default due to dconf. Renaming the issue.. @maicss thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. We use electron-packager, which in turn depends on electron-download, which fetches electron releases from https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/...\n\nCan you try downloading https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.8.6/electron-v1.8.6-win32-x64.zip from your browser?\nThen, from your command-line, e.g. using cURL?\n\n\nAre you using a proxy?\nVPN?\nChina Great Firewall?. > \"But still should not be 127.0.0.1:443, right?\"\n\nYeah that confusing, and must be internal electron-dl mumbo-jumbo.. @basu90 no, we only have --disable-context-menu, which is global. What's the use case?. @basu90 Nativefier's context menu doesn't prevent apps to have a custom context menu. Here are two screenshots of me right-clicking in my nativefied Gmail with Nativefier's context menu enabled (no --disable-context-menu):\n\nClicking on an entry of the list of emails invokes Gmail custom contextmenu:\n\nClicking on a link invokes Nativefiers link handler:\n\n. Yup. Thanks for stepping in, @tjkohli \ud83d\ude42. Closing.. @shadowdao can you try downloading a PNG somewhere (e.g. C:\\Users\\shadowdao\\Downloads\\medium.png) and passing it explicitly to Nativefier:\nnativefier --conceal --name medium --icon C:\\Users\\shadowdao\\Downloads\\medium.png \"http://medium.com\"\n\nAlso, are you sure the problem is tied to --conceal? So if you don't --conceal the build works?. Thanks. Probably related to #501, please have a look there.. @JohannesDeml I see quite a few electron bug reports for that, I suspect it's fixed in recent Electrons. Your Nativefier is old, and defaults to an old Electron. Please:\n\nUpgrade Nativefier and rebuild (7.6.2 will default to last stable Electron 1.8.6).\nIf still problematic, try with super-recent Electron 2.0.0 (passing flag -e 2.0.0).\nIf still problematic, please come back with the full command-line used to build and we'll re-open the issue \ud83d\ude42.. @Swalkyn thanks for the feedback. Never seen this error from Nativefier users; if you have the time, could you look at what thee omniscient Googles suggest? First, could you try with an older/stabler Node+npm couple?. @Swalkyn no worry! Thanks for confirming!. Hi @ujwalmahule . This is Nativefier, the software IBM Verse is based on.

Thanks \ud83d\ude42.. can you try?. @bacongravy thanks!. > \"Ok, this is likely a duplicate of #405 and can be closed\"\n\nYup. By the way, renaming #405 to your clearer formulation: \"Support opening URLs passed as parameter to Nativefied application\".\nAlso, to potential passersby: here's a neat Linux solution to do the per-domain dispatching that @jancbeck does here in macOS with Choosy. > \"it ran fine but the app didn't save to my desktop\"\n@dyspop check nativefier --help, it says Usage: nativefier [options] <targetUrl> [dest].

So,\nbash\nnativefier --name \"asana\" \"app.asana.com\" /Users/dyspop/Desktop. @danielyli thanks for the feedback.

Patch welcome.. Hi @glappen. Yes everything is necessary, welcome to the wonderful world of Electron apps \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.. @bacongravy \ud83d\udc4d, PR welcome. Both regexes may work, I trust your judgement to use what makes sense and doesn't cause false positives.. @bacongravy I was following you until you wrote \"and then closing them entirely once they finish loading\". What are those links and what do they do, if they're opened then quickly closed?. Hi @Tanutk. This is Nativefier, the software IBM Verse is based on. We Nativefier have no control on fixing IBM Verse. Please contact the support for IBM Verse with your problem, and please also tell them we'll welcome a patch to customize the \"Help \u2192 Report an issue\" link. Thanks \ud83d\ude42.. What do we do with previous PR #611 ? Can you close it or rename it to [WIP] if it's become unnecessary / not ready ? EDIT okay, same commits except one more here, closing 611. @bacongravy\n\nCan you describe a GCal test scenario where I can reproduce the issue?\nI like the opening external stuff externally using will-navigate. It's a behavior change, but the previous behavior seems clearly undesirable, and I remember a few user complaints that --internal-urls only works on target=_blank links. \ud83d\udc4d.\nAll this feels easy to break again in later commits. Can you try adding a few tests? I know we're doing a shitty job at testing and your stuff feels difficult to test. Don't over-do it and get lost in mocking hell, just see if extracting+testing pure 'decision' functions can add some robustness.. Yup, known issue. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/422 / #545. Patch welcome.. @briancordanyoung thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude42. Yup, supposing a fix for #405 and combining with --internal-urls you could do that. Closing, feel free to follow #405.. @bhagyashri-sawkar thanks for the feedback, reproducible scenario, and precise narrowing down to a 7.6.1 ... 7.6.2 regression \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude42.\n\n@bacongravy probably a side-effect of https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/591; can you have a look?. @bacongravy ah, true. I'll release 7.6.3 soon, then; it will have 7.6.2....master: your fix, Electron 2.0.2 by default, macOS tabs.\n@bhagyashri-sawkar I'll ping you here when 7.6.3 is on npm. In the meantime, if you have the time for that, a test confirming the problem is fixed on master (see our dev build guide) is welcome.. @bacongravy afaik, Electron 2.0.0 doesn't change anything to the eyes of a user (and we took care of the deprecations), so semver says it doesn't mandate a major bump. You're right that I could have bumped to 7.7.0 for tabs, though. Whatever, 7.6.3 is released and is on npm.\n@bhagyashri-sawkar tests welcome \ud83d\ude42.. > \"I tested on master as well as on 7.6.3, it still doesn't seem to be working.\"\n@bacongravy .

Thanks!. @khaister yeah it's fixed in gulp 4, which we need to migrate to (or maybe I'd get rid of gulp for plain npm scripts, actually).\n\nPackage lock is disabled because so far we haven't needed it (i.e. we haven't had yet any problem of bug in a sub-dependency or semver-breaking change), so we're okay not to have its benefits but we're also happy not to have the added friction it brings.. @akash86167 thanks for the feedback. Nativefier does store cookies. If login is not remembered, something else is not working. Please report the information requested by the Issue template.. @akash86167 \n\n\"when I tried to open a website through google search like \"Youtube\" or \"bing\" it just redirects to my default browser\"\n\u2192 Expected behavior; see --internal-urls flag.\n\"it is using an older version of chrome\"\n\u2192 No, the latest Nativefier uses the latest Electron which uses the latest Chrome stable. Feel free to use flag -e to specify the Electron release you want. Note that once a Nativefier app is built, it won't update, unlike Chrome, and you have to re-build. The \"having to rebuild\" part is intended, but we should do a better job at warning users, see #556.. @fuzzy76 thanks for the feedback. Do other Electron apps behave as you'd expect?

Hi @damithruwan1234 and thanks for the feedback.

And feel free to submit a PR if you think your changes can interest other users! \ud83d\ude42. @ronakg thanks for the feedback. Can you try checking what the reported User Agent is (pop up the DevTools, then evaluate navigator.userAgent) and spoof it to a regular browser one via the --user-agent flag?. @marclipovsky hmmmm yeah, totally, thanks for the feedback. I guess no one complained about that yet because commonly nativefied app are Single-Page Apps that you don't reload.\nTo you or interested passersby: PR welcome.

Closing, please come back with more information (running from console for logs, logs for a nativefier --verbose run, trying with Node 8.x, other ideas welcome) \ud83d\ude42.. @ilovezfs thanks for the ping. No it's not intentional. I pushed 7.6.6, let's see if npm catches that one.. @ilovezfs 7.6.6 is now on npm. Thanks again for telling!. @ilovezfs fixed with 0c9ef088a534f15e916f5cde38fbdd37b71f92ce and Nativefier 7.6.7, which should be on npm in a few minutes/hours.. @airbenich hi!

No one is paid to receive your aggressiveness, and Nativefier is now just one person (me) doing minimal maintenance and accepting PRs, so bugs happen.\nBack to the issue: you say \"Even if I force this one to use the older electron, the bug is still there\"; are you sure about that? There was one single code change between Nativefier 7.6.7 and 7.6.8 but it's super unrelated, so I'd guess the culprit is our move from Electron 2.x to 3.x; either there's a regression in Electron itself, or we missed a deprecation / breaking API change.\n@StefanRied if you have the time for two more tests, can you try forcing more recent electrons and report here? Thanks.\n\nWith currently latest 3.x: nativefier -e 3.0.8 --name \"W3\" --inject site.css \"w3schools.com\"\nWith currently latest 4.x beta: nativefier -e 4.0.0-beta.7 --name \"W3\" --inject site.css \"w3schools.com\".

And glad you appreciate Nativefier! (Which by the way isn't exactly \"mine\", the original author is Jia, I'm only a maintainer).. Fix released in v7.6.9. Thanks @luccasclezar !. @luccasclezar thanks for jumping in. Looking at the 7.6.8 \u2192 7.6.9 diff, the problem must come from Bump default Electron to 3.0.10; I don't see how any of the other changes might have caused the regression.\n@luccasclezar @ron-casey can you try 7.6.9 untouched, but asking for the old electron used in 7.6.8? Just include -e 3.0.3 in your nativefier command..

So don't count on this (or any other open bug) being fixed anytime, but contributions welcome.. @lmssrinivas sure, but two things:\n\nAgain, please explain why. What does this bundleId do? In https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/712#issuecomment-442176356 you say \"appBundleID is the key/AppID for the build we are creating for the store\"; what does that mean? Who uses this id and to do what?\nDocumentation and command-line flag, please. See https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/627/files for inspiration.. @coolboi567 just update Nativefier and re-package the app. Yes we know we should do a better job at communicating this to users, see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/556; contributions welcome.. @bitlab-code Nativefier 7.6.8 ships with a default Electron version of 3.0.3, based on Chrome 66. Are you sure you did re-package your app with it, by re-running the nativefier command used to package it? If yes, then inside your nativefied app can you pop open the inspector (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I) and in the console type navigator.userAgent . What does it output?. @bitlab-code thanks, your setup looks good indeed.\n\nWhatsApp must be doing some kind of new userAgent sniffing / feature detection that results in blocking Nativefier.

AFAIK you're the first to ask. If the only reason is to install a specific version from a github commit, I'd argue the confusion cost brought by this additional checked-in lib folder exceeds your specific developers convenience benefits. Would our dev docs help?. > @ronjouch For example when forking the project for a PR. There is a timespan between a submitted PR and a new NPM package version.\nIndeed. Use a local build if you want to user master locally, following the dev docs.. You want nativefier to create a Start Menu shortcut automatically.

Sometimes I'm in the mood to offer to unresearched/off-topic issues a relax & helpful answer, and sometimes I'm the mood to close with a sarcastic GIF \ud83d\ude42. Good day to you!. @gatsbimantico hi and thanks for the contribution \ud83d\ude42.\n\nA little context, please. Why this? What does it do? What does it fixes? What does it enable?\nWhy make it an option? Nativefier already has totally waaaaaaaay too many options. Can/should we make this default instead?\n\nIf you confirm an option is the right thing to do, docs (md & CLI) docs please. Here's a recent simple PR that you can use as example: https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/747/files. @nikvdp mmmmmh, unless I'm missing something (I've been helping maintenance for very little time), please revert adding these dependencies. They are necessary only for in-app purposes, so we depend on them through separate app/package.json, and installing them for development is documented in the dev guide.. @jiahaog will do, forgot we have that in this project \ud83d\udc4d. @jiahaog I put it this way to have \"Zoom things\" (In, Out, Reset) visually together, but after all they're already together given the menu position and grouping. Will change.. @mdh34 so, the command-line flag is armv7l, but here os.arch() returns just arm? (Just checking, if yes it's alright).. @mdh34 \ud83d\udc4d, great then. Merging, thanks again for the contribution! Out of curiosity, on what kind of device do you use Nativefier? Raspberry pi?. @githubbob42 why is eslint shouting at you on this line? process? If yes, I think specifying the node environment, should make it happy.. @githubbob42 I was about to say .eslintrc, but our project runs under two environments: both node (the builder), and browser (the app folder). So, yeah, for now your file-global eslint-env looks \ud83d\udc4d. Thanks!. @zucher alright to bump this dep if you need it, and thanks for adding eslint-plugin-promise. But if you modify package.json you need to regenerate, commit, and push package-lock.json too. If you're not familiar with it, the TL;DR is: rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install && git add package-lock.json && git commit -m \"Regenerate package-lock.json\". @zucher ah, you must be on an old version of npm. Don't worry about it, then, I'll do it. Keep me posted about the documentation, then I will get your branch, add a single commit for the package-lock thingie, and merge.. @mdh34 with my long-view mirror I can see privacy-sensitive users marching silently but firmly upon us, and shooting us for contacting THE GOOGLES without user consent. What about replacing the lookup to npmjs.com instead? To me that's what makes the most sense, since it's needed anyway to install nativefier. Better ideas welcome.. @mdh34 but process.exit()-ing here defeats the purpose, as it would make building offline altogether impossible, with or without cached files \ud83d\ude42. You should\n\n\nEither do your checkInternet work later, when you determined user is offline AND Electron cached files are absent. Only when both of these conditions are met, exit(1) is the thing to do.\n\nOr leave the check where it is now (meaning it will always be done, which doesn't seem bad), but do not exit(), meaning packaging offline will be attempted (and maybe fail), but at least we'll have warned the user.\n\nYour choice.. For clarity: basic http(s) auth, please. @cbess awwwesome, thanks for noticing this missing piece \ud83d\udc4d. Users taught us --internal-urls has several interesting use cases, could you document them too using my comment at https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/212#issuecomment-292689727 ? Feel free to clarify / reformulate as needed \ud83d\ude42.. Please remove now-unnecessary eslint-disable. @mdh34 thanks for the surprise-PR \ud83d\ude42! So, what happens if I don't pass --x/--y here? x gets undefined, right? Have you confirmed the new BrowserWindow({ later call in mainWindow.js is later on happy with that?. @mdh34 yeah, I was not thinking of setting a default, I was thinking of only adding x/y to options when we have them from inpOptions. Else let's not set it, it's more explicit that we're letting Electron BrowserWindow do its thing with default values:\njavascript\nif (inpOptions.x) {options.x = inpOptions.x;}\nif (inpOptions.y) {options.y = inpOptions.y;}. Unnecessary comment, and \"modal\" means something different than \"always on top\", pls remove. @bacongravy identify is part of ImageMagick. If you wish to improve #199, what about having us keeping depending on ImageMagick and fail better if it's absent (detect its absence, offer guidance to install it, etc.). Also,\n\nYou're on your own on this one, I don't have a Mac to test it. Are you confident about it? If not, please ask someone (maybe running a macOS version different from yours) to run it.\nCan you review the references to imagemagick around the codebase and kill those that become unnecessary?\n\nPlease shellcheck your scripts.\n\nSuper bonus: add shellcheck to our CI run \ud83d\ude42.. @bacongravy we're here trading-off between:\n\n\n\nKilling the imagemagick dep for the \"simple path of building on darwin for darwin\".\n\nThe simplicity of depending on imagemagick for everything.\n\nI'm being careful here to signal I'm wary of a codepaths explosion. By hard-depending on ImageMagick even for tasks handled correctly on macOS by sips, we stay simple. But I get the appeal of not needing anything for the (probably >90% of uses) common darwin\u2192darwin.\nGo ahead, I'll merge once you have addressed the points of the other comment, and yes, additional error handling in case of missing deps always welcome. Thanks again!. @bacongravy good point, yes let's make it clear we're using bash in the scripts with a saner hashbang; we were using non-sh syntax anyway. Please make the scripts start with #!/usr/bin/env bash . If unfamiliar, see this SO page for details.. Can you rework this part to ensure your feature works on non-macOS systems?. Let's avoid the binary GIF; it's heavy and could be licensed.\nWhat about using an emoji?\n\n\u274c\n\ud83d\udcf6\n\u26a0. Hmmmmm how does the the experience feel? Isn't it a lot of movement / jumping windows? Rather than a separate BrowserWindow, did you experiment with using the current one if offline, then replacing the contents with the nativefied website once offline?. Here and below: missing semicolon. \ud83d\udc4d. @tribut but you need to use the value at line 237: .parse(process.argv); should become .parse(sanitizedArgs);\n\nThat suggests you didn't test these last changes. Can you do a quick check and validate that all three options work as expected? Thanks \ud83d\ude42.. Yeah you're right to do what ESLint asks for.\nThe weird thing is that CodeClimate report this as an ESLint error.\nDunno what's going on. Disabling the eslint CodeClimate plugin, we have it in the regular ci npm task.. Okay, I pushed a fix in your branch, CodeClimate and Travis are both happy now. Waiting for your last fix and test.. Not sure either, you should check the docs for the package and/or file an issue there. Also, does that mean it will run on each ready at startup?! . typo: exten_s_ion. ",
    "jiahaog": "Hmm I think that could work! I'll look into it this weekend. Thanks for the link!\n. #4 That makes sense, thanks! \n. Hi, is it your intension for the application to not quit when you close the window, and for the window to reopen when you click the icon in the dock?\n. Thanks!\n. Hi, sorry for the late reply, I was really busy with school. I believe the app data is stored in ~/Library/Application Support/<app-name>, as specified in the docs\nIn any case, I've realised that all the packaged apps share the same app data directory, because they all share the same app name. I've fixed this in 0897432062304525c5d0d61559ba710d82fc41a0 so that apps are uniquely identified by the app-name parameter and have their own individual resource directory.\n. Sorry for the delay, I've been really busy with school and didn't have time until now. I've changed the implementation of how the app is packaged and added in your changes in 48345eceb5260b62ee1bda1f5c21f586fdfe29b9, but there seems to be some issue with how the user agent is changed. \nWhen I change the user agent and visit sites like http://whatsmyuseragent.com/, the change does not appear to take effect. However, when I run navigator.userAgent in the developer console, it returns the correct modified user agent. Did you get this problem on your side when you implemented the fix, or is this a bug with the later version (v0.36.4) of electron? \n. I realised that it's not an issue with electron. Setting the user agent in \njavascript\nmainWindow.loadUrl('...', {userAgent: USER_AGENT});\nsets the user agent for the entire window that appears, and hence when we enter navigator.userAgent, in the developer tools (which is in the context of the main window), we receive a valid navigator.userAgent. However, what we want is to set the user agent of the webview container which shows the target url, and this can be done by doing the following in index.js\njavascript\nwebView.addEventListener('did-start-loading', function() {\n    webView.setUserAgent(appArgs.userAgent);\n});\n. Hi, sorry for the late reply. I don't have convenient access to a linux machine, does this problem persist? atom/electron#3910 seems to suggest that it has been fixed.\n. Sorry for the late reply, do you still have this problem?\n. @somebody1234 Alright, the cli usage was recently changed with big under the hood changes so that would have probably fixed your error. Could you try again after updating the tool? I've made some changes that should support authentication.\n. It's fixed in 6.6.2!\n. This can be implemented in the near future, I believe @zweicoder is working on it!\n. @MattiSG this has already been implemented since 6.10.0!\n. Yup, sorry about the confusion!\n. Oh, I must have forgotten to update the documentation after I made it automatically fill in http if a protocol is not detected. Thanks for the heads up!\n. Hi, I initially had this idea as well, as having to manually convert an icon file for the app simply goes against the simple nature of the command, and it would be extremely cool if the icon is packaged for you. The issue I'm having is converting the favicon or whatever image to the .icns format as required by the library I'm using to package the app, I'm not really sure if there are node.js libraries to do that, and I'm not familiar with how to do so with other libraries. \nAlso, I think it would be great if some sort of string matching is implemented for the app name and high resolution icons could be sourced from something like gilbarbara/logos instead, so that the native experience for the user is seamless.\n. Nativefier will now automatically infer the app icon for the target url, as of v6.8.0, yay!\n. @FanaHOVA I'm going to create a repo with a server so that nativefier can easily retrieve popular app icons, and it would be easier for me to manage the naming conventions as such, thanks for the idea!\n. Hmm, I think this is possible by setting a keyboard listener to the window webframe, I'll look into it!\n. It appears that Electron supports this since atom/electron#3250, I'll look into implementing this with a small window, thanks for the feedback!\n. You can now use the right click context menu to force certain authentication links to open in the same Electron process, and hence login will work for most OAuth sites. \n@mdamjanic7 Asana seems to be an exception and I have no idea how to get it to work there though :(\n. If anyone can figure out how to get certain OAuth sites like Asana to work please voice out, closing this issue for now.\n. I've created #164 which consolidates all problems with logging in!\n. Thanks for this! \n. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Are you saying that say if an app is packaged for http://github.com, links that are outside the github domain should automatically open in the default browser? I do agree that it would add to the \"app-like\" experience.\n. After implementing the OAuth support, this is the current behaviour for links:\n- no target: Navigates to that url\n- target=_blank: \n  - Link is external: Open link in default browser\n  - Link is internal: Open another nativefier window\nWhat is proposed is changing the links with no target to:\n- Link is external: Open link in default browser\n- Link is internal: Navigate to that url\nIt's a pretty easy addition for me to make, are there any side effects to doing so that we may have overlooked?\n. Sorry for the late reply, I was kinda focusing on something else. \nThe default behaviour for external links is that they will be opened in the default browser, and this can be overridden with a right click context menu.\nSince 6.6.2, there is a right click context menu implemented that allows links to be opened in a new electron window for the user to log in, or for the links to be opened in the default browser, this should help with authentication issues such as #19. \nYou guys are right in the issue of identifying subdomains to determine if a link is an external link, the command line flag proposed by @revxx14 seems like a good idea. I'll get around to working on this soon.\n. @englishextra Actually, there are no source html files, the packaged app merely points the browser window at the intended url and injects some javascript to prepare certain callbacks.\nI'm not really sure why you mentioned phonegap and cordova, its not intended to be wrapped into a mobile app.\n. Thanks for the quick fix!\n. Oops, thanks for this!\n. Thanks for this!\n. I'm not really sure how to fix this, I kinda think ~it's something to do with the version string at https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/commit/189fd022d715c840944ac6b6401388565bb56ee8 but changing it does not seem to work~\nEDIT 2017-04-17 from @ronjouch: it's now win32metadata in recent versions of Electron. See Pull Requests https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/244 and https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/228 which started work on this a while ago.. Electron does not support this, but it's possible with window.find(). \n. I think you can use webContents.findInPageText()!\n. Thanks for this. Do you think the shortened version of height (and other flags) are necessary? Usually I would enter the full --height as it's a lot clearer.\n. You're right, I'll get on this in a bit, just need to familiarise myself with creating a homebrew formula.\n. Hey there, I'm really confused with the homebrew formula syntax, do you know of any formulas of npm global modules that I can follow?\n. Yeap, this seems like a simple fix, I'll look into it. What do you mean by the following though:\n\nIf a URL is in the clipboard and it matches the app's domain, provide an option to use it.\n. Hi there. I've made some changes to how the app is structured, and there is no longer any dependency on <webview>. Give me a while and I'll try to integrate your changes, it makes alot of sense to have this option.\n. @featdd Nope, no plans at the moment. I do agree with what @jkatzer said, I don't think this is an important issue if you're wrapping web apps. Though it would be cool to have a --no-ads cli option to disable ads on pages like Facebook, you're more than welcome to submit a pull request if you can find a way to do this.\n. @featdd I've modified the placeholder app to no longer use <webview>, could you see if you're still having the problem?\n. I do agree that the window json is a good idea, will get around to it soon.\n. @gavinengel I don't believe the caching would be supported by Electron, as it points the entire browser to the target url directly. \n\nInjection of JS and CSS is planned, as referenced in #135 \n. @jdsimcoe Yup, that is allowed but it obstructs UI elements of certain pages.\n. I think it might be possible to use JS to dynamically insert some invisible and floating html elements at the top of the window that implement the -webkit-app-region: drag CSS to allow the dragging near the top of the window\n. I'm pretty busy at the moment to implement this, please feel free to look into it and submit a pull request if you are successful!\n. Thanks for this, but what would the use case of this be? I think by exposing all the BrowserWindow options via the cli as suggested in #35 would actually be a better solution. \n. Actually I wanted to do so, but I'm not familiar with how to do so. Perhaps you would like to have a go at it?\n. @contra I'm done with #33! I think all that needs to be done is to put the listener in app/assets/js/index.js under DOMContentLoaded\n. Could you update nativefier and see if this is still a problem? There are a number of under the hood changes that might have fixed this.\n. Could you give me a series of steps to reproduce this bug?\n. This seems really great for the retrieval of the app configuration, but I've looked through just a few popular web apps and they don't implement this standard. Unless I'm wrong, if there are not many web pages which use the web manifest it might not be worth implementing support for it. \n. I'll take note of that and implement this in the future!\n. I think this can be coupled together with #35 as a command line integration by setting the autoHideMenuBar option of browserWindow\n. Hmm, you mean to suggest that the app data path is set to a folder within the created app itself?\n. This has been resolved in #149!\n. Could you elaborate more on this?\n. I don't have a force touch trackpad available, but when I turn on Look up & data detectors with Tap With three fingers, under System Preferences > Trackpad, it works for me. \nIs this problem only limited to force touch?\n. Somehow it appears that the wurl library I'm using isn't installed, I'm looking into it now.\n. Alright it should be fixed now. I'm not sure why even though I committed the wurl in the /app/node_module, it doesn't get pulled down when we do npm install -g nativefier. I'm actually not very happy with how modules have to be committed, and a cleaner build system would be better in the long run.\n. Somework seems to have goine into this in #48, but I'm not sure why the PR was closed\n. @debopamsengupta But feel free to go ahead!\n. It's actually just the validator package, if we are able to disable it, using file:// should work. \nInsecure just causes the chromium backend to ignore the browser mixed content errors https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/da637ebf73b10241a67b766fbfc5ea84839f02b3/docs/api.md#insecure \ud83d\ude04 . What website is it?\n. I found a bug for this and it should be fixed in 2f67eaf99dfe538129c9b558e2b8ab41b8c45f53, I'll merge it soon.\n. KIV the script loader and the custom css for future.\n. What's the issue with this fix for #45?\n. I've tried it out with http://html5demos.com/dnd-upload and facebook messenger and the drag and drop appears to work with nativefier 6.9.1 on OSX 10.11.2. Do you have an example website where this does not work? \n. Oh, I've updated it to fake a user agent string by default.\n\n--honest\nBy default, nativefier uses a preset user agent string for your OS and masquerades as a regular Google Chrome browser, so that sites like WhatsApp Web will not say that the current browser is unsupported. If this flag is passed, it will not override the user agent.\n\nYou don't have to pass in any flags for WhatsApp to work now\n. Yeah I've tested it. Sorry about that, I completely forgot to publish my commit ><, it should be up already in v6.5.4\n. It should be working now with >v6.5.4, feel free to reopen this if you have issues.\n. You have to enter in a user agent string after the -u flag. For example:\nbash\n$ nativefier google.com -u \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36\" ~/Desktop\nYou can google around to find example user agent strings, I simply copied it from http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/Chrome/\n. I've just tried it out and it seems like I'm able to search for them on Spotlight and Alfred without making any changes. Perhaps you have certain filters turned on that prevents your packaged apps from showing up?\n. Hi, I believe this issue is because the .icns file you provided is missing certain assets. Could you try to provide a .png instead, after installing the dependencies specified in the readme for v6.7.0\n. Thanks for the heads up!\n. I believe it's working now in the latest version (v6.8.0)!\n. I've implemented navigating backward and forward via the application menu in e0de7bf463f7611e10fcb6ed5d10b2c830d3952d , let me know if that works for you.\n. What version of nativefier are you using?\n. Sorry about that, I overlooked the issue with windows mkdir -p, and it's fixed in v6.5.6. Do let me know if the problem persists!\n. Give me a while to test this out on a windows computer!\n. This is great, I'll just add a note in the README to inform windows users about pressing alt to show the application menu.\n. Awesome, I've tested it on http://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html and it appears to work, thanks!\n. As of now, the executable that is built is permanent and will not update. To update your executable to the latest version that can be built with nativefier, you have to update nativefier (by calling $ npm update -g nativefier and repackage a new executable. \nPerhaps some sort of autoupdate system could be implemented in the future.\n. Oh, perhaps I misunderstood you there. I believe this functions like a regular chrome browser. Have you tried it out on your webapp yet?\n. It's better if npm link is kept separately from gulp build so that gulp watch does not make npm link run repeatedly.\n. If you access this page from your default chrome browser, does it require flash?\n. I don't have a netflix account, are there any other websites that I can test this on? It should work if it uses the HTML5 video player though :(\n. Consolidating discussion under #113\n. Hi, is there a website or something that I can test this on? It might be possible to pass an argument to chromium as per https://discuss.atom.io/t/trusting-a-self-signed-certificate/12332\n. This should be fixed in the next release of nativefier, I've tested it on https://lacoloc.fr and it seems to work fine.\n. This is a duplicate of #68\n. I'll look into it soon!\n. Thanks for the suggession, this could be a future addition!\n. Thank you!!\n. @momosby Does right clicking and selecting open in new window work for the login now?\n. Are you sure the cookies are not persistent. I can sign in to Facebook, quit the app, and when I return I will still be signed in. \n. Thanks!\n. Give me a moment, I'm looking into it now\n. Sorry, are you on node.js v0.5.4? I've never actually tested it with that version of node, and my CI tests are from v0.12 onwards. \n. Right, just give me a moment\n. Okay this should have been fixed now in v6.6.1, I seem to have misunderstood how webpack externals work and it broke everything ><\n. What version of nativefier and node are you using? I've just fixed it in 6.6.1.\n. Sorry about that, glad its working!\n. Thank you! Mobile functionality is not planned, but @samkho10 was working on https://github.com/samkho10/appify which is what you want!\n. Hi there, if I'm not wrong you linked the parent directory of the app for the flash plugin, with this line:\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('ppapi-flash-path', path.join(__dirname, '../plugins', 'libpepflashplayer.so'));\nI haven't actually got around to testing it, but shouldn't the directory reference the exact path to the plugin within the chrome app on the user's computer?\n. Sorry for the late reply, I've done a test on OSX on https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html and it does not appear to work. Perhaps you have to reference the chrome pepper flash path directly?\nThis is what it says for me in my chrome://plugins for Flash\n```\nAdobe Flash Player - Version: 20.0.0.286\nShockwave Flash 20.0 r0\nName:   Shockwave Flash\nDescription:    Shockwave Flash 20.0 r0\nVersion:    20.0.0.286\nLocation:   /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/48.0.2564.97/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Internet Plug-Ins/PepperFlash/PepperFlashPlayer.plugin\nType:   PPAPI (out-of-process)\n    Disable\nMIME types: \nMIME type   Description File extensions\napplication/x-shockwave-flash   Shockwave Flash \n.swf\napplication/futuresplash    FutureSplash Player \n.spl\n``\n. Would it be possible to add a script to automatically find the path of the flash plugin from chrome for the user, so that he does not have to specify it directly?\n. Hi, this is quite a specific use case and I don't really have plans for this. I believe the app remembers the state of the window when it is closed, could you work with that instead?\n. @MacWorks You're right, that could be an enhancement to save the state of the window. I've created a #139 to reference this.\n. @MacWorks  Are you sure it does not remember its full screen state? It seems to work for me. I'm on nativefier 6.9.1 on OSX 10.11.2\n. Hi, I'm working on a fix for this right now, there seems to be some issues with the library I'm using, and I have a workaround in mind for this.\n. This has been fixed since 5475c6e9685d459509d856f6b4457eeec57ab47a and is released inv6.7.0, the--iconcommand line flag should work now.\n. @ronjouch Ah, that is not intentional, could you open a new issue for this? I wanted to sanitize app names as ubuntu does not allow seem to allow spaces in app names for the dock, and I seemed to have overlooked that.\n. Hi, I don't have any plans for this. What would be the use case for such a feature?\n. @AdrianoCahete Oh, are you saying that you wish to prevent users from resizing the window till it messes up the layout?\n. @dtmunir Are you referring to a way to create an installer.exeor.dmgfor the target page instead of the current app which is already in an 'installed' form? This was actually brought up somewhere and it would be cool to use https://github.com/loopline-systems/electron-builder to create the installers as an alternative.\n. Hi there, I can't seem to replicate this problem. Could you try leaving out the--icon` flag and see if the error persists?\n. I'm not really sure how to replicate this, as it's not happening on my end. Any ideas?\n. Hi, sorry for the late reply, I was busy with school and working on another feature. Could you please try again with the latest version of nativefier (v6.8.0)? I've tried but I can't seem to replicate the issue.\n. Hi, what is the specific issue you're having with the notification? I believe clicking the notification will bring you back to the app if it is minimised?\n. Electron just supports them out of the box! If you're using facebook messenger you have to go into the messenger settings to turn on the desktop notifications. \nCould you provide me with the following:\n\nVersion of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version)\nVersion of Node.js (run $ node --version)\nCommand line parameters\nOS and architecture you are running Nativefier from\nStack trace from the error message (if any)\nInstructions to reproduce the issue\n. Are you sure you have the latest version of nativefier? I've tried to nativefy http://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html, whatsapp web, facebook messenger and it appears to work. Could you check to see if this is specific to the site you are using?\n. @felipead Could you try it on http://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html\n\nIt appears to work for me on windows 10 and OSX11.2 as well...\n. @tseven I don't really use Hangouts, does it send a notification if we access it from chrome directly? Or are there certain settings you have to turn on for the desktop notifications, I believe this is the case for messenger.com\n. Thank you for this!\n. Hi! Forgive me if I misunderstand you, but it is not planned, as the intention is for you to create apps for your own distribution or to share with friends. It's not really intended for users to put the apps you have created up on the app store. \n. This has been fixed since 5475c6e9685d459509d856f6b4457eeec57ab47a and is released in v6.7.0, the --icon command line flag should work now.\n. @koorb Could you please include the following:\n\n\nVersion of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version)\nVersion of Node.js (run $ node --version)\nCommand line parameters\nOS and architecture you are running Nativefier from\n. @koorb Hi, please update to the latest version of nativefier, this has been implemented since v6.6.0!\n. Just to clarify, you're trying to package your app from windows?\n. I meant linux, you mentioned that you are using Ubuntu, so I assume you tried to package the app on Ubuntu for all the platforms mentioned?\n. Could you try building the app on the mac mini itself and see if it works?\n. Hi, I can't seem to replicate this error. Could you please provide me with the following:\n\nVersion of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version)\nVersion of Node.js (run $ node --version)\nCommand line parameters\nOS and architecture you are running Nativefier from\nStack trace from the error message (if any)\nInstructions to reproduce the issue\n. I've tried to replicate this on my Ubuntu 14.04  and OSX on 10.11.4 and I can't seem to get the same errors. Any ideas?\n. Hi, that feature is not implemented and it's kind of low priority for me, as users can use the application menu to do so. \n. @sindresorhus Thank you for this, I'll look into implementing it!\n. @englishextra Personally, I intended it to be a niffy little tool for people to run browser tabs, kinda like @momosby's screenshot with minimal setup. I also believe that you can use it to package certain single page apps for distribution, instead of having just a hyperlink to your app that users can maybe bookmark, your app is now sitting on the desktop/launcher of your user. Such an app would have much more visibility to the user as compared to being just another tab on my browser.\n\nPerhaps you're right in that I should specify the focus of this tool and it would certainly help in scoping further development and feature requests, I'll get around to clarifying soon. That being said, I'm open to feedback on other use cases that I might have overlooked, it's always interesting to hear ideas from the community. I'm actually kind of busy with school, so development might be a little slower until the weekend.\n. Yeap, this could be a future enhancement for the packaged app.\n. It is possible to do this, it is the webSecurity options for the BrowserWindow.\n. I'll be great if someone could add a command line flag --disable-web-security that sets webSecurity of the BrowserWindow to false\n. Are you sure you have to log in every time? On my side I can just log in once into WhatsApp / Facebook Messenger and when I quit and return to the app, I am still logged in.\n. Hi, do you have an example web page that I can test this on?\n. Thanks for this, I'll look into it in the future!\n. Yeap, I do agree that it'll be great, would someone like to give this a go?\n. This is an underlying feature for electron, which will be automatically added once they have implemented it.\n. Hey there, I'm afraid I don't really understand what are you requesting for. Could you provide me with the following:\n\nVersion of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version)\nVersion of Node.js (run $ node --version)\nCommand line parameters\nOS and architecture you are running Nativefier from\nStack trace from the error message (if any)\nInstructions to reproduce the issue\n\nI'll also look into why npm run dev-up is not working, it seems to be working fine for me.\n. Windows is the problem here in building for development. Please do the following instead of npm run dev-up as a temporary workaround.\ngit clone https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier.git\ncd nativefier\nnpm install\ncd app\nnpm install\ncd ..\nnpm run build\nApparently the issue is this line which defines npm run dev-up in the package.json scripts which not supported on windows. Sigh.\n\"dev-up\": \"npm install && (cd app && npm install) && npm run build\",\n. Hi, what version of nativefier are you using? I believe that in the later versions I have disabled the preset loading spinner completely due to a change in how the target page is loaded.\n. Thanks!\n. I believe documentation has been added here: atom/electron#3961, it'll be great if you could implement this in and make a pull request!\nAlso referenced in #68 \n. The current version of electron (0.36.x) runs on chrome 47, while the public release of electron is chrome 48. I am unable to simply reference the plugin file directly because the plugin needs to be built for the same version of chrome, and I don't really want to bundle the plugin binary directly in nativefier as an npm module.\nThat being said, I also don't have access to the widevine plugin for chrome 47, it'll be nice if someone could provide this (for windows, mac and linux) so that some progress can be made to determine if there is even a solution if the plugin is bundled.\n. It's not working but I've left the future tag for anyone who wishes to work on it!\n. Thanks!\n. This is referenced in #23, there has been some discussion there about it!\n. @markazie Hi there, you have to run npm install nativefier -g while you are in your command prompt, and not when you are in the node.js REPL. This means that you open a command prompt (as per the instructions here) and Node.js installed, you type npm install nativefier -g into the prompt that appears. Hope that helps!\n. You're not doing it correctly! You're running the command in the node.js command prompt instead of your windows command prompt. What you want to do is follow these steps exactly\n1. Press windows key + r on your keyboard\n2. Type npm install nativefier -g\n3. Press enter\nNativefier should be installed now\n. This is a problem with npm itself. Some googling has led to https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10897 but I'm not entirely sure how to resolve it.\n. I've fixed this bug in 6.10.1, please update and try again!\n. You can't, nativefier is for osx, windows and linux only.\n. It's not supported now, this was proposed in #83 as well\n. Yeap, this is expected behaviour. It's because I'm running the bestIcon service on my Digital Ocean droplet, and the icons are retrieved from this API. Naturally the droplet would be unable to access your intranet. I plan to port the icon retrieval so that it is self-contained in the near future (when I have more time), could you try to manually add the icons with the --icon flag instead?\n. Sorry about the late reply, I've been quite busy with school nowadays. Could you try the following:\n`` javascript\n// note thedefault`\nvar nativefier = require('nativefier').default;\nnativefier({}, function(error) {\n    console.log(error);\n});\n```\nI believe the problem is due to the way I've exported the modules (written in ES6 and compiled to ES5 before being pushed to npm with Babel) which breaks compatibility with require. I need to read up more about this, could you try this workaround first?\n. This is related to https://phabricator.babeljs.io/T2212, I might add a babel plugin or something to fix the ugly .default syntax. Not sure what the rationale for why they killed it is though :/\n. Yup! I'll just update the docs now to use the .default\n. Please check if you are on the latest version of Nativefier, this has been added since 6.9.0!\n. Yay awesome!\n. Hi! I suppose a menu checkbox option would be a possible solution to allow the user disable the right click menu on-demand\n. Perhaps a menu bar toggle would be better for this, so you do not need to rebuild the app to change the behaviour of the right click menu?\n. Electron does not support this, and hence I have no plans to implement it myself\n. Hi, I believe this is a known bug where the app icon provided is actually a .ico file from the current API I'm using to retrieve the icons. What website are you trying to nativefy?\n. I've made quite a lot of fixes to the way icons are handled, this should be up in the next release!\n. Hi! It should be possible to save the state of the zoom when the app is exited\n. @brunoqueiros This does not appear to work on OSX 10.11, I've tried it on https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html and it indicates that flash is not installed, could you check to see if this issue is merely on my side?\n. I also overlooked the fact that the original PR bundles the plugin together with nativefier, and I'd rather nativefier tries to find the local chrome plugin and reference it.\n. Yup, some work has gone into the tray minimization but is not complete yet. What do you mean by hiding the window border?\n. Nope, it isn't working. It's abit complicated to get to to work cross-platform, and because there are some bugs in the way the icon is set I wish to fix that before adding the tray feature.\n. Hi there! Some work has already gone into the dock in #110 but I've unmerged it because of some issues with the icon not being done properly, and that fix has a few bugs for OSX and Windows.\nI can't really remember the specifics, but off the top of my head, I know that there are some logical bugs on Windows; the icon for the .exe is not set, problems with .ico files, etc. I want to make sure that such logical errors are fixed before I add in the dock function, and I'll probably have time to work on this next week during my break.\n. This should have been fixed in f48ad3790b678a6cec516754600bc2052ad9657a!\n. Hi, I have no plans for this. If this feature is merged into Electron it might be possible to expose it, but it is not planned.\n. Electron does not support alerts, though it might be possible to implement a custom alert shim that overrides the default behaviour, as done in the http login support\n. Ah I'm not really sure, I am unable to test on this distro. Could you provide the details \nVersion of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version)\nVersion of Node.js (run $ node --version)\nCommand line parameters\nOS and architecture you are running Nativefier from\nStack trace from the error message (if any)\nInstructions to reproduce the issue\n. Sure, it'll be great to have this!\n. Thank you so much for the PR!\n. Yup, this is a duplicate of #99\n. Yup, there was some work on this in #47 and is mentioned in #108 as well, I plan to expose something like this via the command line\n. This has been implemented since 166aa8962e791a2dbf734deaac3fcaecaab6fbf6\n. See #139 for this!\n. @Bobeta Are you sure it does not remember its full screen state? It seems to work for me. I'm on nativefier 6.9.1 on OSX 10.11.2\n. Ah, I'm not really sure. Could you open the developer tools and see if there is anything strange going on inside?\n. Hi! Does chrome support this by default?\n. Hi, could you please provide the following: \n- Version of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version)\n- Version of Node.js (run $ node --version)\n- Command line parameters\n- OS and architecture you are running Nativefier from\n- Stack trace from the error message (if any)\n- Instructions to reproduce the issue\n. What's the error/stack trace you get?\n. Oh, the reason why this fails is because the url you used is invalid. You left out the second slash after the url https:/xxx.at/kanboard/ :D\n. I don't really understand why it doesn't work for you... \nCould you try \nbash\n$ nativefier google.com ~/Desktop\n. Hi! This is a duplicate of #135 \n. I'm actually working on it right now!\n. @thegrubbsian this has been added since 166aa8962e791a2dbf734deaac3fcaecaab6fbf6\n. I'm actually in the process of adding it! Just gonna take a bit of time because I want it to be able to automatically determine your chrome flash plugin location without you specifying int\n. Preliminary flash support has been implemented since dab9a067748d56ccb002e255ff8ea4f7d6f38723 in v6.9.1, please see #152 for any issues with flash!\n. Hi there! Yup, I agree with you and it's annoying when the state of the app is not kept when they are recreated. \nActually, I was thinking the data directory should be include a hash of the target url, as such \n<app-name>-<target-url-hash>-nativefier\nCurrently it's simply generating a random hash whenever an app is created, and this makes every packaged app unique. \nIn addition, there should be a menu option to clear the cache if desired. It seems to be too much if you ask the user to specify the data directory, as I'm trying to keep the configuration for creating apps minimal. \n. Oh, a PR would be cool! Actually its just a simple fix in src/build/buildApp.js from line 58. \nI don't know if deleting the cache while the app is running will cause any problems, that will actually take some testing. Ideally, if the deletion works without a restart, it should immediately trigger a refresh of the target url. If it fails, I think the app should restart itself automatically or something.\n. I think the fix here would be to change the postFixHash in line 62 return${normalized}-nativefier-${postFixHash}; to a hash of the target url, and that'll be it!\nYeah, the cache clearing should be another issue, but it should be completed together with this change before I can release the next version\n. @garymoon Hi, may I know how's it coming along? If you're working on it I'll wait a bit for you to be done first!\n. Oh, what options are you referring to?\n. Yup! I think the fix here is simply to change the postFixHash to a hash of the target url, and that'll be enough!\n. Oh, appArgs in line 19 is an object which contains the targetUrl. \nSo maybe one way would be to add another parameter to changeAppPackageJsonName and normalizeAppName to pass the targetUrl in?\n. No problem!\n. I think that problem is because you did not set up the development environment properly, see here.\nI think it'll be alright to simply truncate the hash to 6 characters?\n. Fixed with #149\n. Thanks for the feedback! However, this is an issue with Electron itself, please see atom/electron#3189.\n. Oops, thanks for this!\n. @MAJDA55 What are you trying to do?\n. Hi! I believe this is related to #144 and #7. Currently, it is stored in your appData directory, and its in the following format\n<app-name>-<nativefier>-<random-hash>\n. Thanks! Is there a website serving insecure content that I can test this on?\n. Also, could you merge in changes from development into your branch so that I can merge this PR automatically?\n. Actually I'll just merge and fix the conflicts for you since I have the time now!\n. Thank you so much!!\n. You're welcome! Thank you for your contribution as well!\n. Looks good! Would you like to have a go at implementing a menu bar option to clear the cache or shall I look into it myself?\n. Sure! I believe it might be possible to get the session from the browser window, as per the docs, and then possibly call one (or more) of the listed Session functions, like clearCache or clearStorageData. I've never worked with Session before so this might take a bit of testing.\n. Thanks! Is there a use case for the user when he wishes to clear the cache and clear the storage data separately? I was thinking we should simply have one button that clears both of them.\n. I also don't think it's necessary to check for a focused window, it should be alright to clear the data even if it is not focused.\nOh, it might be better to redirect the user back to the original targetUrl instead of reloading their current page after the data is cleared as well!\n. Yeah, I think we can just clear both together in one command.\nCould you try to pass the session instance into the menu from the mainWindow.js line 58 to add an additional parameter into the function to create a menu?\n. Everything looks good except for the options!\n. Oops, I didn't notice that it was called in the function to reload the window. Everything looks good! I'll merge it in and then clean it up a little. Thank you so much for your help!!\n. Please edit your issue to follow the issue template!\n. Nope, this is not possible. It might be possible with electron https://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps/tree/master/client-certificate though\n. Yeah, I'll look into 1 in a bit. Actually nativefier does not bundle the flash binary but merely tries to find it and point electron to it.\nI've also added a just added a hotfix in 6.10.1 0ed5bd8c7bb599252f4e3a8aad6f21ffe6931abb which will fix the error in 2 if the directory is not found\n. Ah yeap, I have not pushed the new fix to npm yet, give me a bit of time to get some other fixes done\n. Yeap, it's been added in 6.10.0\n. Are you sure neither js file is included? I've tested it and it includes at least one of them. One solution for multiple js files would be to concatenate them yourself or browserify them into one file\n. Nope, you are doing it wrong. You have to do something like \nnativefier http://apple.com --inject SOME_JS.js --inject SOME_CSS.css ~/Desktop --overwrite\nIt only supports using one js file so you will have to somehow concatenate multiple files on your own.\n. Hmm, I've just tested it on my side and it appears to work. Are you sure you didn't set yourself to login privately or something? \n. Could you show me the exact command you used to build gmail?\n. Could you try just regular Gmail without the firewall? I've tried it out on a few web pages and the session cookies seem to work; I'm on OSX 10.11.2 as well\n. Yeah, this is related to #19, there are some websites with a different implementation of OAuth that prevents the redirection from working. Could you try reloading the page after you have logged in with twitter?\n. I've created #164 which consolidates all problems with logging in!\n. Yes, this is because the new windows created have dimensions that are not defined. I don't think this is a problem, because more often than not the new windows are for logins. \n. Is there another web site that I can use to test this? I don't have access to figma. \n. Duplicate of #127, WIP!\n. Yeah this is probably because I loaded it in the following chunk of app/src/components/mainWindow/mainWindow.js.\njavascript\n    mainWindow.webContents.on('did-finish-load', () => {\n        mainWindow.webContents.send('params', JSON.stringify(options));\n        mainWindow.webContents.insertCSS(getCssToInject());\n    });\nI think it might be possible to change the event and use another that does not cause the FOUC.\n. @iammarkoradak I had to revert your pr #162 because did-get-response-details fires multiple times in certain apps and leads to #191 and #172. I'm not really sure how else to avoid the FOUC, I've tried the did-start-loading and dom-ready events, but the fouc still appears...\n. @joeytwiddle I can't believe it didn't cross my mind > <. It's a little more complicated already but I've managed to fix it!\n. What's this?\n. Did you try refreshing the original page via the menu bar, or closing and opening the app and repeating the process again?\n. I've created #164 which consolidates all problems with logging in! \n. Thanks! Give me a bit and I'll try it out tomorrow!\n. I've tried it out and it appears to work, thanks for this!\n. Try to use a fake user agent. I believe it's because it requires the latest version of Chrome, but the default user agent I've set up nativefier to use is not the latest.\nbash\n$ nativefier \"https://web.skype.com\" --user-agent \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.116 Safari/537.36\"\nThis works for me. However, it requires me to install a chrome extension to make voice or video calls, which is not supported on nativefier :(\n. Oh, the reason why I didn't implement this is because of the fact that it makes the window undraggable, and creates a whole bunch of additional issues. It might be possible to play with the draggable region and experiment if theres a suitable default though.\n. @priezz I've never really used a window manager before, that actually sounds like a good idea just for people using window managers\n. This seems to be an issue with node.js v6, v6.2 seems to solve the problem\n. This looks really good, thank you so much for this. It's a really good idea because so far the user agent used is outdated.\nCould you just write a few tests for this in ./test, I'm trying to include tests for any new functionalities.\n. I must have messed up the merge because my commits don't appear here, but I've added in the test myself and contained the error catching within inferUserAgent.js entirely. Thank you so much!\n. Sorry for the late reply! Could you try updating and using the latest version of nativefier?\n. You have to replace them again if you want them to be built with the latest version of nativefier. However, you can test if the same issue occurs by creating an app just to test it out\n. This looks good, thank you so much!\n. Hmm I've never encountered this before. Could it be due to the current working directory? Try cd-ing into desktop or something?\n. Yeah I get this as well on certain webpages. Is it only for YouTube or do you get the same logs for other web pages?\n. Hmm, are the events not fired when the app is closed?\n. Hi there, yeap this is possible. Would you like to work on a pull request?\n. Do you mean version 6.13.0 or 5.13.0 of nativefier?\n. This might be possible with an injected script, as mentioned in #3. Would you like to work on a pull request?\n. Sorry for the late reply! Sure, that'll be great!\n. Would it be possible to inject some sort of javascript adblocker prior to loading the page? How about trying to first using --inject to test the adblock functionality prior to integrating it to the app itself?\n. @eladnava You're right, it's probably going to involve porting the chrome extension to electron, and will take alot of work.\nApparently it is possible to add chrome dev extensions to electron. I'm not too sure, but would that be a solution for this?\n. Hi, thanks for the pull request! Is this really necessary though? The default behaviour for OSX apps is to simply hide the window and not quit the app when the window is closed, and I'm inclined to keep the same behaviour \n. Sorry, I'm just a little busy with school and all. Yup, I wouldn't mind the flag but I would rather it hide the app by default. On a side note, do you think it would be better to have this as a menu bar option instead of a command line flag?\n. Thank you, it works great!\n. Yeah, some work needs to go into adding more options into the right click menu. I find myself missing some of the basic options that I have with the right click menu from chrome at times\n. Yup! @gesquive please see the duplicate issue!\n. Hi! I think it conversion of pngs to icon input has already been implemented a few versions back, see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/development/docs/api.md#icon\n. You're welcome!\n. Agreed, this looks good!\n. Actually, I'm not really sure how this works on Linux. How are other downloaded apps executed on linux?\n. I can't seem to reproduce this, could you be more specific in the sites that have the blink effect, and the previous version which it does not occur?\n. Right, you mean this is like a global config file where you can run something like nativefier install in a new computer to install all the apps you have specified in the config file?\n. Hey this looks great man! I'm kinda busy at the moment but let me know if you need any help with it!\n. You're right, this is a good suggestion and sometimes I want to download files as well.\n. @sindresorhus Thank you! This is amazingly awesome, just what I needed!\n. Hmm, I've never encountered this before. Are there docs anywhere that explain what the & prefix does?\n. Thanks!\n. Ah, sometimes it fails on CI but I restarted it and it's good. Could you pull in the upstream changes into your branch so that I can merge it automatically? Sorry about that, I've just merged in a few changes from another branch.\n. Thank you for this!\n. Actually, the dependencies which are specified in ./package.json are for the cli tool. For the packaged app itself, the package.json is specified in ./app/package.json, which includes those dependencies the app uses\n. Oh yeah. Actually, the reason why I have to run npm install from the ./app directory, is because I need the modules used by electron to be saved within ./app/node_modules, and not ./node_modules. This is why to setup the development environment, I made the npm script npm run dev-up which is basically npm install and cd app && npm install. It's really just a workaround, but do let me know if you have any ideas how to streamline this.\n. @rosolko Sorry for the late reply! I'm not sure if electron supports webrtc, I've looked through their docs but there's not much mention about that\n. Yup, thank you @lexelby for the fix!\n. Sorry for the delay in checking this out! I've realised that the injection of css triggers after every ajax response, which really slows down performance of the page. I've added #214 which appears to fix the issue, please check out the commit and let me know if it persists, or I'll merge it in soon if all is well!\n. @denisbr @eladnava Hmm, are you all building the app with the --inject flag?\n. I can't seem to reproduce this with inbox or youtube on the new branch... I believe the problem could be due to the CSS being repeatedly injected, but I've coded it such that if the --inject flag is not passed, the necessary callbacks which seem to cause the performance issues are not set. Could you try and see if there are any differences with and without setting the --inject flag to some random css file?\n. Hmm, the performance issues are not showing up for me on youtube when I play a video on #214. Could @denisbr @eladnava could you provide me with the following:\nSpecifications\nVersion of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version): \nVersion of Node.js (run $ node --version): \nOS: \nI've also updated #214 with some debug statements. Could you also try building a page for a problematic website and providing me with the output in the developer console? (accessible from the app menu)\n. Alright awesome, thanks!\n. I've pushed the fix in 7.0.1!\n. @lexelby You're absolutely right, the current implementation is a simply a sufficient (if mediocre) workaround to deal with the FOUC. \nHaving said that, the FOUC only occurs for less than a second, and is more noticeable when you apply styles that change the layout of the content. Could you try something like \n* {\n    font-size: 50px\n}\nand see if this implementation of adding the css to the head prevents the FOUC? Thank you so much!\n. Currently there is no way to do so, but it would certainly be possible to specify a directory to be copied into the app. Would you like to work on a pull request?\n. Hi, I'm kind of working on this in the latest development branch. However, what's stopping me from releasing it is that there seems to be issues moving directories created by electron packager v7, when I'm on OSX 10.11.4. I'm able to remove these directories from the command line with rm -rf with no problem, but when I try to delete them finder prompts me for an admin password, but still does nothing after I input it. I'm not too sure what's wrong with this, but I'll have to look into it a little more.\n. I've found a workaround for this since 60823a21bb2425fd4e745c5029b88b767784113b and it'll be in the next release!\n. 1. It's always enabled, for easy debugging. It would be possible to set a command line flag to prevent it from showing up though.\n2. I believe this has been brought up before, but this is not supported :(\n3. You can right click on certain links to open them in a new window, but the purpose of nativefier is for single page apps like twitter, whatsapp etc.!\n. @ddofborg Hmm, I don't think supporting multiple windows is a good idea, it requires a lot of functionality (such as address bar, back button) for each window that makes it too similar to a browser, and you might as well use chrome instead?\n. Sorry for the late reply! I understand your use case, and it makes alot of sense to have all my email accounts on one app, and social accounts on another app. It is definitely possible to do so, by specifying different configurations to the MainWindow when it is instantiated. It is going to take some work to do so, to generalise the CLI to allow multiple urls as well as to restructure the app to be linked to multiple windows, which I currently do not have time to do so :( Would you like to work on a pull request for this?\n. I'll add it to future, thanks so much!\n. It's because electron works by packaging the chrome binary within the app itself so it is a standalone app when packaged.\n. Hey, could you try specifying the architecture version with either --arch ia32 or --arch x64? I have not tested this on x87 before\n. You're right, thanks man. This can definitely be implemented to remove the dependency!\n. Hey I can't seem to replicate this error. Could you try building an app with a later version of node.js?\n. Thank you so much for the help! I did not realise did-get-response-details would be called multiple times. I was wondering what the cause of the polluted console was for some time now. This fixes #172 as well!\n. Hey, I believe subdomains will open in the same window, and only external links should open in the default browser. Is this not the behaviour you are experiencing?\n. I'm just building a small hobby project to do the same thing as well!\n. I've updated the electron version to 1.1.3 in the latest release!\n. Hi, there are no plans to extend the app to support chrome plugins on a high leel, but you can use the --inject flag to run your own javascript\n. @priezz Are you referring to dev extensions or regular chrome extensions?\nI think it might be possible to add chrome dev extensions to an electron app, as indicated here. Would someone like to look into it?\n. Yup, you can use the --inject flag to do so.\n. Let's consolidate this issue under #191!\n. Sorry for the delay! I'm good with the changes, but as mentioned in #116, it would be better if we could specify a flag that indicates if we want to consider the subdomain for better control?\n. Yup! The current behaviour is for the context menu to always displayed, you can use the --disable-context-menu flag to override this.\n. It would be possible to spawn a new BrowserWindow, for another url. Currently, nativefier only creates a single window for the target url. Implementing multiple windows could take quite some work though. It would be cool if we could have a flag for this!\n. Let's consolidate this issue under #191!\n. @CodeBrauer You need node.js >=4 to run Nativefier due to the limitations of electron packager\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Thanks so much! Could you update the documentation as well to specify this new flag?\n. Looks good, thank you!!\n. You could use nativefier to build the app, right click on the packaged app > show package contents and change the generated javascript files from there as well. (Though they are compiled and bundled together)\n. Please use nativefier v7.0.1, this was reported in #191 and has been fixed since!\n. You're right, this is an handy UX improvement to the app. I'm not sure if electron supports this though, the documentation seems to suggest that everything is handled by the os...\n. Hmm, I've looked into this and you're importing the module correctly!\nThis problem seems to because of the unzip module dependency used by simple-spellchecker, with something to do with how the require function is used and preventing webpack from being able to recursively bundle all the app dependencies. This is somewhat mentioned in dcodeIO/protobuf.js#339, and I believe one of the dependencies of simple-spellchecker is the source of this problem.\nWithout going into too much detail, webpack is not exactly necessary when building the app, but the reason why I used it was as a workaround because there are issues when I try to publish nativefier to npm with nested node_modules directories when I want to maintain the same folder structure, as follows. \nnode_modules # <- contains dependencies required by the cli\napp/node_modules # <- contains dependencies required for the placeholder app\nFrom what I remember, npm consolidates all of these modules in the root node_modules directory, and hence I bundled the dependencies required by the app when publishing to npm as a pretty ugly workaround.\nHaving said that, it would probably be possible to use the same module you require, with some tweaking of the gulpfile to not use webpack to bundle the app. I could go into more detail regarding this if you wish though.\n. Actually is electron/electron#942 relevant to implementing spell check? I believe the support is documented here. It'll be great if we could use the native electron api for the spell check! If this works, you won't have to mess around with the gulp files and all the building :D\n. I've also encountered the problem where it is difficult to debug the main electron process when the app is packaged. There's a helper function you can use here, which directs the output to the chromium inspector \n. Right... Haha I'm sorry, it's not exactly documented. If you have https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-prebuilt installed, you can run $ npm start and anything from the main process will appear in the terminal while the app is running (though it is not packaged). I'll have to add this into the dev documentation\n. Hmm, I've never encountered this problem while using it for development. Sure, I'll be open to a pull request!\n. Hmm, are you referencing the correct window? I believe the window here refers to the electron BrowserWindow, and not the global window object of the page.\n. This is a duplicate of #113! It's not supported now, but feel free to submit a pull request!\n. Hi, I'm open to a pull request if you could do so! \nYeah, I don't think you can do that in commander. Another solution would be to pass in a json object for the version string with the relevant keys and values. I'm not too sure, but what's the convention for specifying an object as a command line flag in unix command line tools?\n. Really sorry for the delay. I've added some comments regarding the object keys, and could you add some documentation as well? Thanks!\n. I think you mistakenly opened a pull request instead of an issue. Please see #113\n. Really sorry for the delay! Could you fix the linting error and we should be good to go!\n. Great, thanks!\n. Really sorry for the delay! Could you add some documentation here as well?\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Thanks for this, I'll update the readme! . Done in 1658db53a6bc04409ba5100c0bbda868ee5253b8. Really sorry for the delay, I'm overseas at the moment and I can't look into the issue without a computer. \nHmm, npm run dev-up works for me on OS X, I'll have to look into it when I get back in two weeks, sorry \ud83d\ude14\n. Sorry for the delay, thank you so much for the fix \ud83d\ude04 \n. Sorry for the delay, thank you for this!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks but I'm trying to work on adding more tests, and it's not a good idea to update all the dependencies like this. Thanks!\n. I'm not sure if this is a complete solution to having a frameless window. Wouldn't it cause problems for users who set this flag and realise that they are unable to drag the window?. The reason why imagemagick was used was because it is supported on linux as well, but not sips and tiff2icns (if I'm not wrong?) Would it be possible to use this change for OSX only then?. Thanks, I didn't know that was causing problems :/. Left some comments on the dockerfile, could you also remove the line regarding the maintainer?. I'll add it to dockerhub after this is merged! @toschneck . @toschneck Awesome, tried it out and it works great. Thanks so much! :1st_place_medal: . @ronjouch I think it's a little obvious to tell the user to check nativefier --help, but it's definitely a good idea to print the latest electron version there! Also, it would be great if we could print something telling them that they are using a outdated version of nativefier, or other useful things that they might want to know!. @ronjouch Thanks, really awesome job! Let me do some testing on my side, and go through the changes with electron packager. Works fine on my mac @ronjouch, thanks alot!. @smensak Could you elaborate more about the .desktop file as a workaround?. @bergatron It probably should be more obvious in the documentation, but could you try to run the same command with the --verbose flag again? Sorry about that >< \n@ronjouch Yeah, the current progress bar is kinda buggy when there are errors, I'll look into it. @danieldogeanu could it be related to this? https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/windows-10-creators-update-can-block-win32-apps-if-theyre-not-from-the-store. I've made some changes and added it already, thanks!. @zucher sorry about the hound errors, I've got to fix that. I might be wrong, but isn't throwing an error in a promise the same as returning a Promise.reject?. @zucher Sorry about that! I misunderstood your PR when you changed the throw to Promise.reject, I didn't realise that your PR was actually trying to fix a bug pointed out by @ronjouch in f91b2ba43d67a744202d6d38641d7ecc8bf2ca0b and I went ahead with a fix myself \ud83d\ude1e \nI don't think it's necessary to use Promise.reject though, as I'm not calling other async functions like the example you posted in the link. Thanks for the fix! Apologies for the delay, been really busy \ud83d\ude1e . @ronjouch Thanks a lot!. Ah, seems like the CI build on travis has failed. Let me look into it. I've manually published 7.4.1 to npm. It seems to be a dependency issue, I've fixed it using npm pacakge-lock.json in 33fe71a85557a8be204e7d2b3867793c5719fc77. I've just glanced through the source code for webcatalog/electron-widevinecdm briefly. I could be wrong, but it seems like it is downloading a prepackaged widevine binary and we are dependent on the upstream for versioning. Would it be easier to instead assume that the user has Chrome installed, and hence read from that directory?\nSomething like https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/commit/6ca4e794cdbc5b4884cd2c05b9a56f1c4e139cd1 (for flash but the same idea)? Sorry if I'm a little out of touch with things, feel free to correct me if it should/should not work \ud83d\ude04 . @xdgc @brianblakely Ah yes, you're right about the incompatibility issue between the chrome version drift and Electron Chrome version. \nCould we then have some form of pop up to inform the user when the plugin has completed the download?. @ronjouch Yeah, I'm not too certain what the exact problem is requiring us to use a package lock, my guess is one of the upstream dependencies were updated but is not backward compatible \ud83d\ude05 that I've added the package lock to workaround in 33fe71a85557a8be204e7d2b3867793c5719fc77.\n\nAlternatively, do you have convenience tips to handle package-lock.json in projects like ours?\n\nHmm, I'm not really keeping up with the current PRs, could you refer me to some of them which have this problem? \n\nWould we consider going back to non-locked dependencies (but at least with strict direct deps, i.e. 1.2.3 and no ^1.2.3) ? (Real question, not a suggestion, it's probably a Bad Idea \u00a9)\n\nWe could try this solution and see if things still work on an older version of NPM before making a call on how we should do this. Definitely do agree with you that requiring a Node version should be sufficient, and forcing a NPM upgrade is not desired. Yeah I'm not really sure what is going on, I'll have to dig a little more . Hmm seems like even though we use travis to release with https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/master/.travis.yml#L30-L38, when I download the tar bundle directly from npm view nativefier@7.5.0 https://registry.npmjs.org/nativefier/-/nativefier-7.5.0.tgz, only the lib and bin directories are present in the package. I've just manually released 7.5.1 now via my local machine, I'll have to look into why the autorelease didn't work properly.. Ah, I've just fixed it :). Personally I'm in favor of having the tabbed support as well, it allows us to better separate our workflows into different \"contexts\", especially when web applications support it (as you've mentioned, JIRA, and more). I think it's very good work, many thanks goes out to you for your contributions!!\n@ronjouch @bacongravy What about making the option in the context menu enabled by default if it is supported, without needing a configuration option? (We already have too many to begin with \ud83d\ude02) After all, it is up to the user to choose to \"open in a new tab\", or \"open in a new window\". What do you guys think?. I'm not really sure what's going on here \ud83d\ude02 , it seems like ESlint failed on 147a027 even though I didn't touch this file, and I essentially had to do a revert of your change. Can you check to see if it's still faling on your local?\n``\n0b47999 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Fix lint error - PASSED\n147a027 Add jest --watch helper for npm scripts  - FAILED\n04e2f64 Add Unix/Mac-conventional-v` version flag (PR#628) - PASSED\n...\nfe6fd9d Fix prettier lint error (#625) PASSED\nbde4ea6 Force all external links to be opened externally (#624) PASSED\n``. What's theoptionshere passed in for?\n. Sorry, I'm not really sure why do we have to \"do nothing\", wouldn't the/gflag be sufficient for removing the ascii characters?\n. Hi, really sorry for the late reply. The reason why we don't want to keep non ascii characters in the filename is because it causes errors with building for windows while on macOS. What about using theDEFAULT_APP_NAME` declared in line 19 of the same file as the default value instead?\n. I believe you can camel case the object keys here, like inpOptions.appCopyright as commander does that for you.\nCould you make the keys: \nconst options = {\n        appCopyright: inpOptions.appCopyright,\n        //..\n}\n. Is this necessary? Would we be able to just run node lib/cli.js?. Would prefer to copy over the package.json, then do the npm install, then copying over the rest of the files, to maintain the cache. This is specified but the option is unused, did you intend to use this as well?. Can use ES6 string interpolation here to avoid the string concatenation here . Is it just me, or does Reset Zoom sounds a little better haha. Do we need this? I thought it's already in the package.json?. Do we have to import this file? I can't really remember if it's needed for all files. Can't really remember how gulp works >< Is this related to the tdd gulp task above?. Is this change needed?. Typo here. I think it's better practice to use COPY instead of ADD https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy. Not sure if imagemagick is included within the base image, might have to add it here because we try to convert images to png. ",

Could be a new option added to the build process, something like \"if links aren't on these domains, open in new tab\" where you provide a list of domains.\n. Exactly. For example, if you have GitHub as an applciation, and you where to click on a link to npmjs.org, that link would open in your default browser.\n. The only problem I can think of is that there could be instances where a site has two domains but is in fact the same site. For example, something like gist..github.com and github.com. Should the gist subdomain count as an external site, or should it be considered an internal link?\nI think the best way around that kind of situation is to assume that they're external by default, but allow a flag when generating the app to specific additional urls. Something like --urls \"github.com, gist.github.com\".\n. Good points, opening in-app by default is probably best. I'd still like a flag to make them open externally, even if it's all or none. Something like --external-subdomains would probably work well.\nAn example use-case for this would be sites like webs.com, where users can set up their own sites but end up with a subdomain of webs.com (i.e. example.webs.com). In this case, all (or most) subdomains for webs.com would be unrelated, and therefore it would make sense that they'd open externally.\nAnother example would be for my own internal development process. Whenever we're working on a website, we set it up as a subdomain on one of our domains (i.e. clientname.example.com) before it goes live, and each of these sites is completely unrelated. Of course, I probably wouldn't want to generate apps for these sites, I'm just giving examples :)\n. @rdcvnh any plans to submit a pull request to the main repository?.

    "xdgc": "PR #440 looks promising, but it didn't work for me. It's possible that my whole nativefier installation is tainted because I installed using Homebrew first, then tried to install from git.\nBut still, I have a working Netflix app. The basic guidelines on how to enable widevine cdm are accurate, but the hitch is that you have to point it to a widevine binary that's valid for not only for your platform, but also for the Chrome runtime in the electron app. That means you can't simply point it at your \"real\" Chrome browser.\nTo start, I built a Netflix app that didn't work. I opened developer tools to get a JS console, so I could obtain the exact Chrome runtime version.\nnavigator.userAgent\nIn my nativefier/electron combo, that gives 56.0.2924.87. So the trick is to get a Widevine bin from that release of Chrome. I went to https://google-chrome.en.uptodown.com/ to find that. The nearest match was 56.0.2924.76, which is fine. I unpacked that to a temporary location.\nI created a new folder, /Applications/Google Chrome Electron Support/56.0.2924.76. Then I copied my temporary Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/56.0.2924.76/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Libraries/WidevineCdm/_platform_specific/mac_x64/* to that folder. This obviously is for a Mac but the procedure for anything else should be similar.\nFinally I went to my nativefied Netflix.app and edited Netflix.app/Contents/Resources/app/lib/main.js. Right before the bits about setDockBadge I added these lines:\n/// add widevine DRM support\n    _electron.app.commandLine.appendSwitch('widevine-cdm-path', '/Applications/Google Chrome Electron Support/56.0.2924.76/widevinecdmadapter.plugin');\n    _electron.app.commandLine.appendSwitch('widevine-cdm-version', '1.4.8.962');\nI got the widevine version from running `strings widevinecdmadapter.plugin | grep '1.'.  This way I don't have to worry about an older Chrome runtime messing anything up in my user profile.\nYou can make those changes in nativefier's main.js file to effect the support for any new app.\nAgain I think the new PR shows some promise \u2014\u00a0I'm going to scrub down as much as I can and give it another go \u2014\u00a0but I wanted to get this report out here while it's fresh in mind.. I'm not sure how to determine what failed. If I understand the PR it's trying to download the plugin in runtime, which sounds wise, but I can't see that it's happening. And I don't know enough about electron to find why. But if someone can give me guidance I can look into it.. I think relying on upstream for version is exactly what's attractive. There can be a substantial gap between the Chrome runtime version used by Electron and that in the user's local Chrome installation (if any). If the widevine plugin is not compatible (as between nativefier's Chrome 56 and my Chrome 61) then the plugin just appears unavailable \u2014\u00a0no diagnostics to help.

This was likely resolved with PR #588.. I did the same a few months ago, I'm surprised I missed this one.  Thanks for verifying that it no longer needs to be fixed.  I don't know of any other already-resolved issues.. Is this issue a duplicate of #549, and therefore resolved by #551?. The behavior of secondary windows is improved with PR #579, and may resolve the issue mentioned in duplicate #497.. I reviewed the breaking changes and the only relevant thing I found was that a crashReporter option that nativefier uses is being deprecated; but I don't think it is scheduled for removal until 3.0. In any case, I will put up a PR to address that issue.\n\nI briefly tested nativefier with -e v2.0.0-beta.7 on darwin and found no functional issues.. I experience this issue if I do not have imagemagick installed and the icon does not exist in the icon cache.  The changes in #583 will make this issue less likely to occur, as natievefier will fallback on sips when imagemagick is not present, but this may still be useful if icon conversion can fail for other reasons.. This seems related to #405.  I'm planning on creating a PR to address these two issues.. The symptom you are experiencing is due to the ./Contents/Resources/app folder inside of the packaged application having it permissions set to deny all access to everyone but the owner (0700).\nOnly the owner can see the contents of the app folder, so only the owner can launch the application.\nYou can fix the permissions on an installed application Electron.app like this:\nsudo chmod a+rx /Applications/Electron.app/Contents/Resources/app\n\n. The fix for #405 (#574) might give you the tools you need to make this work; I think adding a custom URL handler to a nativefier app to support deep linking would let you save shortcuts that open the nativefier app and navigate to a specific sub-site.. Thank you for taking the time to review this PR.\nTo answer your points one-by-one:\n\n\nI want to wrap tickets.puppet.com (a JIRA instance) with nativefier.  My normal JIRA workflow (in Chrome) when running scrum meetings and sharing my screen is make the window full-screen, and open lots of tabs, one for each ticket we need to triage.  We then move through each tab one by one. I want to replicate that behavior with nativefier.  I don't want to make the app more like a browser; I just want tabs.  Finder, Terminal, and even TextEdit on macOS have support for native tabs; adding native tabs to a macOS app doesn't make it \"browser-like\" -- it makes it more \"Mac-like\".\n\nThe tab bar is hidden by default; it doesn't appear until you open a (second) tab.\nI will provide screenshots.\n\n\n\nThis feature is using an electron API.  If electron figures out how to make tabs work on more platforms, nativefier will get that support automatically.  I intentionally did not gate the feature behind darwin checks.  Another option would be to try to integrate electron-tabs, but that looked like significantly more work, and is not currently something that I would be interested in doing.\n\n\nI'd be happy to split out the context-menu work.\n\n\nI can add a check that raises an error when --enable-native-tabs is used with an older version of electron.\n\n\nI have split out the context-menu work into #588. If you can confirm that this feature will be accepted even though it is a macOS-only feature then I will proceed with generating screenshots and adding the version check.. The codeclimate failure is:\nFunction initContextMenu has 28 lines of code (exceeds 25 allowed). Consider refactoring.\n\nThis didn't come up before, because the function was already more than 25 lines long, but as a result of #588 getting merged, the function length was reduced to be under 25 lines, and this PR is now increasing the length again.. The check for enabling tab support could be moved to a function, one which is initially hard-coded to check if platform === 'darwin'. I don't know of a way to determine at runtime via electron API whether the tab APIs will have any effect; I think the function would need to be kept up to date if electron's built-in support expanded to more platforms in the future.\nI understand the concern over adding a significant new feature (one which requires maintenance as the menu and window creation code changes over time) that is not actually testable on all platforms. I can only hope that the fact that the electron maintainers themselves were willing to add this API, despite its limitations, is compelling evidence that it should be at least be allowed as an opt-in configuration option.\nAs implemented in the current PR, the default behavior is that the feature is not enabled. When it is enabled, a new context menu item is added, and new menu items are added to the View and Window menus for managing the tab bar, navigating between tabs, and collecting all open windows into a single tabbed window. The tab bar itself does not appear until after either a tab is created for the first time, or the user chooses to display it using the 'Show Tab Bar' menu item.\nScreenshots\nTabs not enabled (default)\nWindow\n\nMenu: View\n\nMenu: Window\n\nTabs enabled (--enable-native-tabs)\nWindow, with tab bar shown\n\nMenu: View\n\nMenu: Window\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to change any of that, and I'll update the PR accordingly.. I personally don't see a downside to making this feature always enabled for darwin and would happily remove the --enable-native-tabs option from this PR if that's the desired direction.. The latest commit removes the --enable-native-tabs option and instead uses a nativeTabsSupported() function to decide whether to add the \"New Tab\" context menu item.. I believe this is ready for merge.. The issue with external links being opened in tabs is resolved by https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/pull/613/commits/61507cd21b02bed13e770177ce8dd6cd303cbbc4, but that hasn't been merged yet.. The code in question creates a temporary directory, and then copies app into that temporary directory.  This copy is happening as part of preparing the electron application for packaging.  As a seemingly-unintended side effect of the library being used to do the copy, the app folder is given the 0700 permissions of the enclosing destination folder, even though it does not have those permissions originally.\nI doubt that nativefier was written to depend on this behavior.  If nativefier intended for the app folder to have specific permissions, there would be code setting it explicitly, or a comment indicating what has happening.\nGranting read/execute of all directories in an application bundle is totally normal.  An application cannot be run if it cannot be read, so it doesn't make sense for an application to be installed in a system location like /Applications but contain files/folders that some users cannot read.  If the user's intention is to prevent other people from seeing their application, they simply can choose to keep it in an appropriately-permissioned folder in their home directory.\nAll that is to say, I don't think this behavior is intentional, and even if it was, it would still be a bad idea and should be changed. It definitely shouldn't be the default behavior.. I have tested on the following systems:\n\n10.11.6 (15G31)\n10.13.4 (17E199)\n\nI tested by running nativefier https://tickets.puppet.com/ and looking at the resulting product in the Finder.\nWith branch master I see the following behavior:\n\nwithout imagemagick: no custom icon\nwith imagemagick: custom icon\n\nWith branch issue199 I see the following behavior:\n\nwithout imagemagick: custom icon\nwith imagemagick: custom icon\n\nI'm satisfied with this PR and am removing the [WIP].. I haven't checked, but it seems likely. The \"New Window\" feature has probably only ever been useful for doing simple things like opening images or text files in new windows.. This supports the work towards tab support in #579.. Node 4 and node 5 are failing with:\nThe command \"npm run dev-up\" failed and exited\n\nIt looks like maybe the version of npm being used isn't compatible with the version of node?. * (fixes 439) \ud83d\udc4d\n I have not seen crashes from secondary windows (but I've only tested on macOS). Do you have steps to reproduce?\n I have seen the \"Grrr!\" message in my nativefier-built Gmail app for as long as I've been using it (>1 year) so I don't attribute that behavior to these changes.\n* (tamed travis) \ud83d\udc4d . These features (open new window in app, open new window in $BROWSER, and open new tab in app) are available from the contextual menu, but not the menu bar, and they don't have keyboard shortcuts.. Note that this does not fix the issue of the opened popup window being blank.. This works properly for me in the case where the redirect is to an external link, but I'm not sure what it would do if the redirect is not to an external link. I could make the window.close() conditional on something, but I'm not sure what. In any case, the current behavior is that clicking the link does absolutely nothing, so even if this PR isn't perfect, it seems to be significantly better than nothing.. Sorry, this was part of a bigger change I\u2019m working on and I tried to cherrypick just this fix but it is nonsense in its current form.  I\u2019ll re-push something later that actually makes sense. Sorry for the confusion.. I've updated the branch.\nWithout this change, the links in Google Calendar do nothing when clicked, because 'about:blank' is passed to shell.openExternal(), which does nothing with it.\nThis change consists of three commits.\nIn the first, the linkIsInternal() function has been updated to treat 'about:blank' links as internal so that the redirect technique can work at all. However, while this works, the redirect itself causes another window to be opened (in the external browser, or in a new tab if tabs are enabled), leaving behind a blank, useless window in the nativefier app.\nThe second commit ensures that the subsequent redirect opens an external window even if tabs are enabled. External links should always be opened externally.\nThe third commit implements logic to hide the 'about:blank' window until the redirect occurs, at which point it closes the window, thereby avoiding the problem of the blank, useless window being left behind.. I'm open to putting this behind an option --strict-internal if you don't think it should be the default behavior.. I put up #611 so there would be the option of taking just the about:blank redirect fix without the strict-internal feature.  But I'm happy to use this one PR for all of it if that's easier.\nThe test this in Google Calendar, create an event with with an (external) link in the description.  Then view the event's details by clicking on the event in the calendar view, and then click the link.  Notice that clicking the link does nothing if you are using current master.  (A workaround is to use the context menu to open the link.)\nI'll look into adding some tests.. This PR been rebased onto the changes for #620 and #622 and should be merged after those.. @ronjouch Please take a look at the tests I added and let me know if they provide the coverage you were looking for.  Also let me know if/how you would like me to address the codeclimate issues.. Actually, I think its best to split the 'about:blank' handling into a separate PR from the external link navigation handling.  I'm going to close this PR and open two new ones.. If this is a side-effect of #591 then it is probably fixed with https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/commit/69a5b2cbbe356876b767993358a1806ac6c5695f, which hasn't been released yet.  Might be worth cutting a 7.6.3 release with just that fix (along with a bump to Electron 1.8.7).. Might be worth branching from the 7.6.2 tag and backporting the .newGuest fix to put out a 7.6.3.  I had sort of been assuming you'd bump the version to 7.7 or 8.0 to account for the electron 2 dependency update and the new tabs feature.\nAdditionally, I thought you might want to wait to include #613 before bumping to 8.0 as it might be considered a breaking change.. That\u2019s disappointing.  I suspect we\u2019ll have to decide between disabling node integration, and having this use case work.  I can try testing that tonight.. I wasn't able to review this last night but expect to do so today.. I've put up a fix in #620. I have verified that it fixes the issue with the Dropbox chooser.. @LWFlouisa JSON files are not executables, I suspect you are not invoking the command correctly.. @ronjouch Rebased.. @ronjouch Please take a look at the tests I added and let me know if they provide the coverage you were looking for. Also let me know if/how you would like me to address the codeclimate issues.. This will need to be rebased after #622 is merged.. @ronjouch I believe this is ready to be merged.. @ronjouch A couple of things to note:\n1. Linting doesn't fail when I run it locally (yarn run lint)\n2. The failure reported by Travis is in inferUserAgent.test.js, which I did not modify with this PR.\nSince I can't reproduce this issue locally and it is not happening in code that I wrote I don't think I'm the right person to resolve this CI issue.  (I already do use the eslint plug-in in Atom, and I did see and resolve prettier-generated errors in the code I wrote for this PR.). Actually, after deleting my local yarn.lock files and rebuilding I do see eslint failing on the command-line, but it does not report the error in my editor.\nIf I modify the code to make eslint . stop complaining, then my editor starts complaining:\nReplace `\u23ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.keys(TEST_RESULT)\u23ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.map((platform)\u00b7=>\u00b7testPlatform(platform)` with `.keys(TEST_RESULT).map((platform)\u00b7=>\u23ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7testPlatform(platform),\u23ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7` (prettier/prettier)\n\nIt seems that my editor is using different rules than eslint . is using.  Restarting my editor (Atom) resolved the issue; I now see the same errors on the CLI as in my editor.. I put up #625 with the fix.. @ronjouch I believe this PR is ready to go.. That's so strange.  I wasn't seeing the lint error originally, but it was happening in Travis; see the discussion in #623. After I deleted my yarn.lock files and re-built dependencies, and restarted by editor, I started getting the same lint error locally as was showing up in Travis, so I was able to fix it.  I don't know why the behavior would have reverted again for you.. @ronjouch This fixes #610.. I can reproduce this issue, too.  I think may have introduced this regression with the refactoring I did to support tabs.  I'll take a closer look later tonight.. I don't see anything new that has been deprecated in 3.0, and we already stopped using the things being deprecated in 2.0, which have been removed in 3.0, with the merge of PR #587.. The nativefier support for tabs comes from electron; support for native tabs in electron for macOS was added here: https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/9052\nIf electron gets updated to support tabs on more platforms then it should be relatively simple to add support for them to nativefier.\nIt would be possible to change how middle-click and ctrl-click behave in nativefier, to open external links in an external browser when native tabs are unavailable, but I'm not convinced such a change would provide value, since external links already open in an external browser when you left-click on them.  Being able to use middle-click to override the default \"open externally\" behavior seems useful to me.. @hbridge thank you for the bug report!\nThis looks like a duplicate of issue #633, which is fixed by PR #634.  Unfortunately, there hasn't been a release of nativefier since those changes were merged.  The next release of nativefier should include the fix.. This may be a case of google redirecting to a login URL that is considered an external URL.  If this is a regression, it may have been introduced by #622, and if so, it may be possible to work around with the --internal-urls option.. This may be tough/impossible to fix in nativefier without reverting #620 and reintroducing #616.  I suspect that this issue will need to be addressed in electron or Chromium, to make new windows inherit the user-agent of the window from which they were created.. It might be helpful if you could tell us what version you were using previously.\nThe code that opens the external links uses the shell.openExternal function from electron, here:\nhttps://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/master/app/src/components/mainWindow/mainWindow.js#L204\nand here:\nhttps://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/master/app/src/components/contextMenu/contextMenu.js#L12\nThe shell.openExternal function is documented here:\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/shell.md\nIf it is not opening links in your default browser then perhaps this is a bug in electron?  . I started a personal project along those lines: https://github.com/bacongravy/nativefier-apps\nIt\u2019s very specific to how I wanted to build the apps; not everyone is going to be using okta for login, for instance.  But it could be forked and made more generic.\nThe app-specific settings are in here: https://github.com/bacongravy/nativefier-apps/blob/master/apps.json\n. Another approach would be to change the default regex for internal urls to be something more like /.*/.  In terms of trade-offs, it seems to me to be better to live with external urls opening in Nativefier by default than it does to be unable to log-in to some sites by default.. Or, we could back out #624, I think that's the change that started trigging this problem for some people.  What if we put that behavior behind a --strict-internal flag that wasn't enabled by default?. This article explains what app ids are for: https://cocoacasts.com/what-are-app-ids-and-bundle-identifiers/\nBasically, they are required to be set to specific values for Mac App Store submissions.. This is the spot to do it:\nhttps://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/07faeb1881594b442a8b6c2d6fc9e74fc840e8e6/app/src/components/mainWindow/mainWindow.js#L92-L105\nThe feature is documented here:\nhttps://electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option\nand some follow-on functionality was documented here:\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/pull/14999\nI think I experimented with the sandbox option before and determined that it broke the behavior of some websites that show popups.  I suspect that it has to do with window.open reverting to standard Chromium behavior (instead of Electron behavior), as described in the above-linked docs.  But, maybe I'm misremembering, or perhaps that behavior has changed since I tried it (it was electron v3).. I didn't modify the convertToPng or convertToIco scripts to use sips, because they aren't used in the simple path of building on darwin for darwin.\nThe convertToPng script is used on darwin when building for linux; the convertToIco script is used on darwin when building for win32. Those scripts still require ImageMagick, as you point out.\nI can see a couple of options:\n\nUpdate those scripts to work on darwin without requiring ImageMagick\nUpdate nativefier to check for ImageMagick and provide a helpful error message when asked to perform a conversion for which it has a missing dependency.\n\nI can understand wanting to keep #199 open until option (1) is implemented, but do you have any objections to merging this PR as-is in the meantime?\nIt seems like option (2) is a new enhancement request that should be tracked with a new issue.. To answer your other points:\n I will have a friend validate these changes on a different Mac before marking this PR as ready for merge.\n I will review the mentions of ImageMagick around the project and update them as appropriate.\n* I will shellcheck the scripts.. I've run the script through shellcheck (as a bash script, not a sh script) and updated the PR based on the feedback I got.. ",

I'm not sure what to do about the \"flash of unstyled content\" that the above commit supposedly fixed, but I don't see it.\n. Yay! \n. @jiahaog \nThis still injects the CSS many times.  If there are any Ajax calls before did-finish-load, then each one results in a new copy of the CSS being injected.  Lots of CSS piling up is what caused the performance degradation since each copy of the rule has to be evaluated on every DOM change.  In my test, the current version injects the CSS 38 times before Slack loads.\nHere's a way that seems to successfully inject CSS (using injected JS) once without performance issues:\n`` javascript\nvar injectedCSS =\nhtml {\n    font-size: 22px !important;\n}\n.channels_list_holder ul li a {\n    padding: 0 0.25rem 0 0.2rem !important;\n}\na.channel_name, a.im_name {\n    font-size: 19px !important;\n}\nquick_switcher_label {\nfont-size: 18px !important;\n\n}\n`;\n$(\"\").appendTo(\"head\").html(injectedCSS);\n```\nI don't see a FOUC with this, but then again I've never seen the FOUC, so someone else will have to test.\nCredit to this page for the injection JS: http://blog.lacour.me/making-slack-night-mode\n. As far as I can tell, I think the FOUC is avoided.  I ended up using your test but with !important to override any styles of the page under test.\nI modified my JS to look like this, because otherwise it won't work on pages without jquery loaded:\njavascript\nvar style = document.createElement(\"STYLE\");\nstyle.innerHTML = injectedCSS;\ndocument.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(style);\nWith that, I don't get a FOUC at all.\nI guess we'd probably need to make this a bit more robust by adding a head tag if one doesn't already exist.\n.

But it didn't work for me.\nWhat did work:\n- After the app is built, edit [app_folder]/resources/app/lib/main.js\n- Search for the line function createMenu(_ref) {\n- Add return; on the line below it.\n```\n  function createMenu(_ref) {\n      return;\n  var nativefierVersion = _ref.nativefierVersion;\n  ...\n\n```\nNote however that doing this will disable some keybinds, such as Ctrl + / - for zooming.\n. My issue with Alt and Alt-Tab and Ctrl-Alt-Arrow (switch desktops) toggling the menubar has gone away. \nNow I have a constant menu bar which doesn't toggle. That removes the annoyance. :+1:\nI see there is also a compile-time option: --disable-context-menu\nIt might be nice in future to have another one: --disable-menubar for those who don't want it..

After some research, here is what happening:\nTL;DR\nWith electron, window.opener object is not passed to the popup window\nBy default, electron is opening every new window in a new electron instance. For security reasons, the new instance is not inheriting his parent (his opener) objects and therefor, don't hold the window.opener object which is usually necessary for completing OAuth sign-in.\nThere are some work-arounds for this problem if you are the site content owner. The problem is that it is usually not the case with nativefier.\nAnother option is to use the sand-box option which should exposes the regular window.open behaviour (same as any browser) but unfortunately, due to a bug in electron (#https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8100), it won't work if the OAuth is from a different domain.\nAnother possible solution might be #https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8963 which is looks like is going to be resolved soon.\nBTW, also if the above issue will be resolved, the problem with nativefier current behaviour (opening pop-up window in the default browser), is that OAuth sign-in still won't work unless the OAuth sign-in will be open as an electron window.\n. You can easily implement it by yourself.\njust edit the app/src/components/mainWindow/mainWindow.js script so close event will minimize the app instead of closing it:\nmainWindow.webContents.minimize(). you are right, my mistake, it is mainWindow.minimize().\nif you want to minimize to tray (next to windows clock) here is an example:\nhttps://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps/blob/master/tray/main.js.

    "eladnava": "@jiahaog I'd love to give it a try if that's okay with you. =)\n. @jiahaog Do you have any pointers on how this should work? It doesn't look like Electron supports adding non-DevTools extensions (such as Adblock).\n. I looked all over the interwebs for a JavaScript AdBlocker that can be embedded - I couldn't find such a beast. They only exist as extensions, because what site is going to include an AdBlocker for its own ads?\nIt appears the only available course of action is to port one of the extensions for use with Electron because they all heavily rely on the chrome.* extension APIs. They need to be able to block web requests based on filter patterns and other stuff that might not be possible to achieve with plain old browser JS.\nIt appears Electron implements some of the functionality offered to Chrome extensions, but via a slightly different API interface.\nAdBlock Plus for Chrome is open source and seems like a good candidate for porting:\nhttps://github.com/adblockplus/adblockpluschrome\nI'm not sure I'll have the time to work on it, though -- it's a pretty big project, actually. Anyone else willing to give it a shot?\n. @jiahaog Unfortunately, that won't be enough, because Adblock relies on the chrome.* extension APIs, which are simply not implemented in Electron (yet):\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1498#issuecomment-96995155\nChrome Dev Extensions work because they might not rely on those APIs. For example, AdBlock needs to intercept all requests and run rule-checking logic on them to see if they're ad-related. That isn't possible in Electron, at least not via the APIs that AdBlock expects.\n. @matthewdias unfortunately that script needs to be configured with each advertisement's URL in order to work. It's for websites that want to reward the user for clicking a specific ad by hiding it in the future.\n. A manageable workaround is to just block ad networks using the /etc/hosts file. \nSince a nativefied website will typically serve ads from the same ad network(s), it shouldn't be too hard to detect and add their hostnames to the hosts file.\nAnd if that isn't enough, you can always inject JavaScript into the page using webContents.executeJavascript to block or prevent ads on the page from displaying by deleting their DOM elements / intercepting their XHR requests.. Just tried generating a YouTube app using the fix/performance-issues branch but unfortunately the performance issues are still there, mostly when scrolling the page down / hovering over the seek bar of the currently-playing YouTube video.\n. @jiahaog Nope, what am I supposed to be injecting? I'm simply trying to use Nativefier with YouTube and experiencing performance issues:\nnativefier www.youtube.com\n. @jiahaog I hadn't passed the --inject flag at all and still got the performance issues (4 days ago). Performance issues are noticeable after the app runs for a long time (e.g. a few hours or a day).\n. @jiahaog Excellent news!\nMaybe I built nativefier incorrectly last time I checked, but I just tried again and it appears that all performance issues are gone for me!\nTested on YouTube, Google Keep, Inbox, Google Photos, and WhatsApp Web. No more janky scrolling / bad FPS!\nThese are the commands I ran this time to build an app using the fix/performance-issues branch:\n``` shell\nDelete old versions\nnpm uninstall -g nativefier\nClone and build\ngit clone https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier.git\ncd nativefier\ngit checkout fix/performance-issues \nnpm run dev-up\nnpm link\nGenerate the app\nnativefier www.youtube.com\n```\nCan anyone else who experienced performance issues run these commands and check whether they're fixed for them as well?\nHere are my system specs, in case that helps in any way:\n- Version of Nativefier (run $ nativefier --version): v7.0.0\n- Version of Node.js (run $ node --version): v4.4.5\n- OS: OS X El Capitan\n- Architecture x64\nThanks again for solving this @jiahaog!\n. Just wanted to report that after 15 hours of using the apps, I can confirm that the performance issues have definitely been fixed (at least for me) \ud83d\ude04 \n. You rock! \ud83d\ude0e\n. Seems like a manifestation of #191.\n. Same here, getting bad fps and janky scrolling on Google Photos / Google Keep / YouTube.\n. If anyone wants to completely override the external link behavior, so all external links are automatically opened in the default browser and not a new nativefier window, you can temporarily patch app/lib/main.js within the compiled binary's source files until a PR is submitted.\nFind:\nmainWindow.webContents.on('new-window', function (event, urlToGo) {\nAdd Below:\nevent.preventDefault();\n_electron.shell.openExternal(urlToGo);\nreturn;\n.

    "matthewdias": "could do something like this maybe http://www.javascriptsource.com/cookies/remove-ads.html \n. @jiahaog its also very common for OSX apps to quit after you've closed the last window. It's up to the discretion of the developer. In my experience, the apps that do have this behavior, are ones that don't expect to be used over a long period of time. For example, your to do list might stay running since you access it many times throughout the day, however, photo and video editors help you achieve one task, and then aren't useful anymore until you happen to need them again. I think webapps in particular would benefit from this functionality, because many of them are things you would bring up to do something, and then would quit them when you're done. Doing it automatically on window close just makes it easier, and in the end, its up to the user if they want to use it.\n. would it make more sense if the default was true instead of false? I don't really mind if you think this shouldn't be merged at all. it's just a feature I wanted for myself.\n. Alright I can reverse the behavior when I get time. Busy with school too xD. I don't think its really necessary as a menu bar option, as you'd probably want the same functionality every time for a given app (At least I would). That made me think, though, it might be cool to have a preferences pane where you could change the values that you initially set using the command.\n. I updated with the changes on development and reversed the default behavior.\n. ^ if that's the case you could just keep a shell script with nativefier commands for all your apps\n. This already works by shift-clicking a link. Could be enhanced tho by adding a menu item so you could open a new window with the base URL.\nedit: i forgot this already exists.\n. you don't need to type the $ when running the command\n. ",
    "deksden": "For small utility apps on OSX its common to make app close on window close. Its per-app setting, so command line option for app packager will be ok\n. Interesting idea. Here is my 50 cents:\nActually, a nativefier app is a URL + some options + some injected scripts (all that stuff that we specified to the CLI when packaging the app). So we can have only one instance of nativefier app as runner, and use it to launch multiple apps. OSX app folder can have reference to proper app, not actual app (or maybe small cocoa launcher with icon). \n. @CaptainQuirk : the idea is simple. Any Electron app is BIG - because it includes the whole chrome runtime and all that stuff. But a Nativefired app is only a small pack of settings, so we can have some optimization: build some generic \"runner\" app and use it to run \"installed\" apps. Only one problem: we need some \"app\" in app's folder. But this can be solved same way as Steam do - small \"launcher\" app to execute actual \"runner\" with proper params. \nHere is Dota2 \"app\" from steam that is actually a shell script to run Steam as a launcher for Dota2.\nDota 2.zip\n.

Why the final &? I don\u2019t see a point to it. If you remove that character you can remove the next three lines: the two comments and the while.. Instead of 2>&1 > /dev/null, do &> /dev/null. Same thing.. --setProperty should be set instead of -s. Similarly, -z should be --resampleHeightWidth. Short flags are great when typing a command, but are less useful in a script, where comprehension is more important than speed.\nWhen you can understand what a command is doing without having to open the man page and check every flag because they consist of a single letter, you have a better experience, and might be more inclined to fix bugs if an outsider to the code.. Also, why 128? 512 (the max tiff2icns can use) should be used.. Although on a similar note, I just confirmed that since tiff2icns\u2019s limit is 512, it makes fewer icns sizes than the sips+iconutil solution, which means tiff2icns does not take into account the @2x screens, which are only getting more common.. Finally, it\u2019s probably a bad idea to redirect output to /dev/null, here. tiff2icns has no output when it succeeds, so errors should likely not be ignored.. ",

    "alxlg": "Hi, I started Nativefier Freedesktop here on GitHub to provide the best integration on Linux desktop. Feel free to look at it for inspiration or helping to finish it.. @quanglam2807 I think you are exaggerating: you suggested your tool as an alternative to Nativefier to a lot of issues. I tried your app, it's cool but it has different purposes than Nativefier.\nYou can use Nativefier to every URL you want, also very personal favorites. Yours instead is a store of web apps you decide.. @quanglam2807 Nativefier does everything I need thanks. Installation should be by design out of scope for Nativefier. That's why I started Nativefier Freedesktop that is a tool to automate the installation of Nativefier apps on Linux desktops.\nAll in one tools don't follow the Unix philosophy. Do one thing but do it well. I hope it's clear what I mean.. @quanglam2807 but I have to see your spam in a lot of Nativefier issues. Doesn't WebCatalog has its own UI? My Nativefier Freedesktop will be very easy to use and totally follow Freedesktop spec for Linux desktop, there is no need to compile anything since it's a bash script.\nFor example: does WebCatalog support creating a Web App of a custom URL injecting CSS and JS? That wouldn't for noobs, no? That's why you need to define an input that is more complete than a URL. I defined .webapp files for the purpuse of being easily installable by users and I wrote a wizard to create .webapp. Everything for non-geek users. I tried your WebCatalog, next time before replying trying my Nativefier Freedesktop and objectively judge which one is better for this issue.. @quanglam2807 once installed the user can click on .webapp files and install them as Freedesktop apps. And .webapp files can include custom CSS and JS. Is it enough short as explanation?. @quanglam2807 no, they just need to click on a .webapp file that contains everything. They will be able to uninstall webapp from their menu and they will be able to update them from there.\nMy project is explicitly for this issue: managing Nativefier apps on Linux. Yours is a new Nativefier with apps choosen by you, or am I wrong?\nSo are you going to add Linux desktops support without knowing what Freedesktops are? Good luck. MacOS and Windows? Are you kidding me? I said from the first moment I did a script for Nativefier+Linux and I said \"do one thing and do it well\". On the other side there is you with your all-in-one solution that don't know what Freedesktop is. And notice that I just said in the first comment: take a look at my script for inspiration, I don't say \"try my all-in-one solution\" without an exaplanation as you are used to do in Nativefier issues.. @quanglam2807 I already said that your WebCatalog has nothing to do with this issue. I specifically wrote a solution for this issue and I commented only here suggesting to take inspiration from it. You commented on a big amount of Nativefier issues just saying \"try WebCatalog\". Though yours is a very cool app, stop suggesting a totally different app to people that are commenting an issue of Nativefier. If your WebCatalog solves that issue is OK, but your WebCatalog doesn't use Freedesktop specifications so it has nothing to do with this issue.\nProbably you have no idea what this issue is about and you are trying to promote your app without really know if it solve this issue or not.\nPlease before replying again search what Freedesktop is so you will be able to understand why Nativefier Freedesktop tries to solve this issue while WebCatalog not.. @darrenhaken did you notice that @quanglam2807 commented on an enormous amount of Nativefier issues saying to try WebCatalog that is a totally different thing and often has nothing to do with the issues he comment? Isn't it spam?. @quanglam2807 it doesn't use Nativefier. It's like spamming Firefox bug tracking system with suggestions to use Chrome. Yes both Chrome and Firefox are used to browse the Web, but issue tracking systems shouldn't be used to promote totally different software.\nIf I can build an app from a URL I choose with Nativefier and then your tool add that to app menu I will recognize that your tool is a solution to this issue.. @quanglam2807 if this is the last time I see you promoting WebCatalog in Nativefier issues tracker..

I was able to get something working. Now, I highlight words based on a dictionary (no suggestions yet). So, if a word isn't in the dictionary, it's marked as incorrect.\nBut I was unsuccessful in loading an actual dictionary. I removed unzip and tried to load an actual .dic file instead of a zip. inside a node.js script I was able to load the dictionary that way and everything worked.\nBut inside of nativefier, something went wrong and the dictionary wasn't loaded. I think it's because the code is being compiled and the relative path to the dictionary file should change. But that is just a guess.\nDo you think it's a reasonable assumption? Any hints on why the file isn't found? I'm not sure I understand the gulp build script yet.\n\n. Cool! Thx for the hints :-)\nI am using the function you send. It's the provider in that function that needs a dictionary file to check. But maybe the library they recommended works in a way that will allow that.

Couldn't find a gulp command for that :-)\n. I'm still working on it.

Also, you can use ctrl+R \\ cmd+R to refresh\n. I'm not sure what the problem is. Can you write down the actual command you used? did you just wrap facebook.com? did you try to add some command line arguments? which ones? did you get any execution errors?\nIf you executed something inside a node.js code, can you share that part of your code?\nEverything looks good to me when I run nativefier \"http://www.facebook.com\" --name \"Facebook\" on Windows and OS X\nThis is my folder structure:\n\n.

    "githubbob42": "I do not understand why the tests are failing.  They pass on my local dev env (of course, I also have wine installed) but I thought that's what the maybeNoIconOption method was for in buildMain.js.  I added similar methods for the other options as well with no avail but that seemed unnecessary as the original PR (#228) didn't add them and his tests passed.  \nAny help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.\n. Interestingly enough, if I rename my wine to hide it, the tests fail the same as the ci tests.  Then I changed my branch back to development (i.e. no changes at all) and the test still fails.  \nEven more interestingly, I just pulled the latest from https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier.git and ran through all of the steps on the Development page and I still get the same error. \nHas something changed recently that would cause this behavior?\n(BTW, npm run dev-up doesn't work on OSX - it fails because it can't cd in the app folder.  I just run through those steps manually and it works fine)\n. Hi @ronjouch, I believe it does supersede it, as #228 only adds app-copyright and app-version, whereas this PR adds those as well as build-version, version-string and win32metadata.  That's why I made this PR because #228 didn't do enough.  Thanks!. I believe on Windows, the tab in the task bar shows progress/activity while it's downloading (not sure about the other platforms).  Also, there is an openFolderWhenDone option in electron-dl that \"reveals the downloaded file in the system file manager, and if possible, selects the file\" when the file has finished downloading.  While this isn't as nice as a progress overlay it's a workaround for the other requested features.\nAs for how I use the --file-download-options, #499 gives a detailed (albeit complicated) example of why I needed the option, but any site/app that has/wants links for downloading files (<a download=\"myFile.txt\" href=\"...\">Download Me</a>) files would definitely benefit from setting the option.\nIf you're not familiar with the HTML5 download attribute, see: \n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a\n- https://davidwalsh.name/download-attribute. Hi @ronjouch, rebase it done.  However, should I change the kebab-case of app-version, etc (from #244) to camelCase?  It looks like that was done for the other parameters at some point.  Thanks.. I have the same issue where I need to detect if my app is a Nativefier app.  In my case, I am unable to view a PDF file within the Nativefier app (regular desktop Chrome works just fine). \n It appears the desktop/regular browser Chrome has a builtin extension that allows viewing of PDF's in the browser.  This extension is not available in the Android version of Chrome, so our web app has special code to handle that.  I need to run the Nativefier app through the same code path as for Android in order to view PDF's in our app.\nIn order to accomplish this, I have modified the userAgent string to append Nativefier at the end and I test for it in our app (in addition to Android).  This seems to work, but I wasn't sure if there was another (more appropriate) way to do this without monkeying with the userAgent string.\n. I have to agree with @ronjouch's comment (https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/438#issuecomment-325687693) about the camelCase names (but I thought that commander would still pass any kebab-case options though as camelCase).  \nHowever, I did not bump the version for nativefier in those changes (still at v.7.4.1).  Maybe trying running npm update?  Should we bump the version?\n. Hmmm, when I install nativefier globally, and look in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/nativefier, I don't see any of my changes in lib/options/optionsMain.js.  Was something missed when either building and/or deploying?  Were the changes actually deployed to npm?\nWhen I build and run everything locally, it works fine.  Of course, it looks like the CLI only looks for kabab-base parameter names but that seems to be to pattern (kabab-case for cli and camelCase for programatic).  Again, if I run everything locally, it works fine.\n. @ronjouch Sorry for the delay - all looks good.  Thanks for updating this!. Thanks for the input @ronjouch.  I certainly understand the bias towards maximum backwards compatibility.\nHowever, having only a --prompt-download-folder option seems limited since the electron-dl module supports additional options (some of which were requested in #335).   And providing a separate parameter/flag for each option seems a bit cumbersome and a maintenance headache if electron-dl adds a new or removes an option in a later release (we'd have to modify Nativefier again).\nThat is why I suggested passing an object to the electronDownload constructor/initializer.  This way, you can pass any option that electron-dl supports (or adds in the future). \nPerhaps instead of naming the parameter fileDownloadOptions, it should be called electronDownloadOptions (or electron-dl-options) to be more semantically correct.  I considered these names initially but wasn't sure if it would be meaningful or confusing to the end user/developer (e.g. is this for downloading files or downloading electron itself).  In my case, the end user would be able to specify/override the settings in the nativefier.json file, so fileDownloadOptions (or file-download-options) seemed the obvious name but I'm open to suggestions.  Plus the api.md documentation would direct them to the electron-dl page for the available options.\n@jiahaog @ronjouch thoughts?. Perhaps I'm not understanding your issue, but Nativefier doesn't \"download and install an app\" of the website you specify.  Nativefier builds an Electron executable that simply displays the website you pointed to (look in the build folder that gets created).  I think you may be confusing App downloads and installs without errors with the app built an Electron executable (again - look in the build folder where you ran the nativefier command).\nIf you want the resulting electron executable to be \"installable\", you'll need to take the executable (and associated files) and build an installation package with an install builder tool (e.g. WIX Toolset, etc).  \nBasically, Nativefier only creates a wrapper application around a chromium browser, pointing to the website you defined at build time.. @jebeld17 It's been almost a year since I last rebuilt my application so forgive me I sound confused (perhaps new features have added that I'm not aware of)... \nSo after you run nativefier --name \"Azure Portal\" \"http://portal.azure.com\", what do you expect to happen or the result to be?. Thanks.  Assuming we are still on the same page (the output of running the nativefier command), I'm not familiar with /downloads being the default save location.  \nMy experience is that nativefier builds the executable in a folder, inside the ./build folder, where you ran nativefier.  \nSo if you ran nativefier --name \"Azure Portal\" \"http://portal.azure.com\" from the command-line here:\n/Users/you/projects/azurePortal \nI would expect it to build the executable here:\n /Users/you/projects/azurePortal/build/Azure_Portal-win32-x64 (or something similar to that; depending on your platform and options specified). Should I put it in the .eslintrc.yml file or just inline it (/* eslint-env node */)?. ",

Each document is a unique URL.  I want to create a Docs app, a Slides app, and a Sheets app.  I want to edit documents in windows, each within their own app, like a native office suite (Office/iWork).  In order to do this I need my Nativefier apps to receive URLs.  \nIf someone sends me a link to a doc in Gmail, I want my Gmail Nativefier app to open the document in my Docs app, not a browser tab.  There's no way to do that if the Docs app can't receive URLs.\nThis use case is very similar to iOS.  There are native apps for Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. When you tap on a link to a doc the OS intelligently opens the Docs app, not a web page in Safari.  I want to create the same thing. \nIf Nativefier could just receive HTTPS URLs to start with, Choosy or Browser Fairy can handle which app should launch for each URL domain.  Long term it would be great if apps could register their own URL helper scheme.\nFrom an outsider's perspective this initial functionality doesn't seem particularly difficult.  Just open whatever HTTP URL is passed through, as long as it matches the internal-urls regex.  It's very similar to Gmail spawning secondary windows except the URLs are coming from outside the app, not inside.  \nIt also seems to fit perfectly within Nativefier's goal of taking popular web apps and making them feel native.

I can set the app to only show the icon in the menubar.\n\nAnd to hide the window when it loses focus. So now, if I want to pull up the window, I just click the menu bar icon. Also, if I move the window, it remembers it's location as well, so I can place it right underneath the icon like so.\n\nSo, I suppose something like a --menubar-only option would be nice. Then the default behavior could be to show/hide the window when the icon is clicked.\nHappy to move this to a new issue if that's helpful.

What processes should I watch for exactly?\nBy the way, I have a strong suspicion that this might be a Windows Defender problem. The generated apps are not signed with a trusted certificate, so my Avast antivirus puts them into sandbox and scans them when they first open, but it usually says it's fine and allows me to open them. But in Creators Update version of Windows 10, they changed how Windows Defender works and I can't freaking disable it for the life of me! It says that it's disabled but when I go to the settings, Real-time protection and Cloud-based protection is on. No matter what I do, I can't turn them off. I even tried it from registry and Group Policy, nothing happens. If you have any tips on that, tell me.\nAlso, I should mention that when I run the nativefier command, the progress bar jumps from 30ish % to 60ish % instantly. The antivirus scan also stops abruptly, like there was something wrong with the files (maybe corrupted). And it's funny, because the old apps have 124MB, the new ones have 127MB.\nAnyway, I'll come back later with the Process Monitor results.. @jiahaog No, I don't think so. Mine is set to Allow apps from anywhere. In Windows 10 S you're locked with Windows Store only apps, I have Windows 10 Pro. I think this is a Windows Defender problem, but we'll see.. @ronjouch OK, so I made a capture with Process Monitor and it appears that there are a lot of errors: NAME NOT FOUND, FILE LOCKED WITH ONLY READERS, PATH NOT FOUND and BUFFER OVERFLOW (among others). It seems that my Avast antivirus is freaking out over this. I think it's because of the BUFFER OVERFLOW thing. But I don't know if the antivirus closes the app, or not. At some point, the app just shuts down itself for no reason (or maybe for a lot of reasons, lol). I'll try to uninstall my Avast antivirus and I'll try again.\nI've attached the raw capture (unfiltered), so you can see what happens before and after and what other processes might interfere with it. Here are some details, so you can find where it begins:\nSTART TIME: 07:06:06.8301245 (about half way through the file)\nAPP NAME: FB Emoticons.exe\nAPP LOCATION: D:\\TEMPORARY\\Test\nPS: This is what happens when I launch the generated app, not when I generate it with Nativefier. I'll also try that when the time allows.\nI hope this is useful.\nUPDATE: Yeah, maybe I also don't forget to attach the file. Here it is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ZHZNtFYG1GUDJlZm5PelU1aGc/view?usp=sharing. So I've figured out what was going on. The problem was with Electron not downloading completely when you run the command. Of course it wouldn't run, it had an incomplete Electron installation.\nI have no idea why that happened, but I suspect it's a Windows problem of some sort. It was the first release of Creators Update and even the guys at Microsoft told people not to install it. It was buggy as hell.\nNow I've reinstalled Windows with the latest version and it works like a charm. I've also installed the latest versions of Node and Nativefier. I would suggest you to do the same if you're having these issues.\nI guess you can now close this issue.\n\n\nVersion of Nativefier: v7.4.0\nVersion of Node.js: v8.0.0\nOS: Windows 10 Pro Creators Update v1703 build15063.332\nArchitecture: x64\n. \n",

The user would have to change this to\n~~~\nnativefier --tray true https://foobar.example\n~~~\nIs that what you want?. I've now added your workaround and rebased. I've also added a function to make sure --tray false works (\"true\" == true, so that worked without explicit conversion) - not sure if that is needed, but given you had true and false in your workaround I figured.\nNote that codeclimate and travis seem to disagree whether the parenthesis around arg in https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/cd07d9e0145e3847ac80ee706587b58af6a60b6f/src/cli.js#L51 are needed.

    "luccasclezar": "I was having the same issue so I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be a pretty simple correction :)\nAs I said in the PR's description, I tested with the same command of this issue and everything is fine, now I will start to test it more thoroughly with the other apps that I have in my Mac.. Now I have tested with my nativefied YouTube and Azure DevOps apps and both worked very well, the CSS got reloaded when the page updated and had minimal time (if not no time at all) displaying the overridden styles.\nThe only problem that I could not circumvent is that when the page already sets a property that you want to change, you have to add !important to its value. I tried to use all possible Electron's events to add the CSS after the page's style, but I didn't manage to do it.\nHaving that said, I don't think it's that much of a problem, as my modified version of YouTube app has only one !important property.\n```\ndiv#container.style-scope.ytd-masthead {\n    padding: 22px 16px 0 16px !important;\n    -webkit-app-region: drag;\n}\nguide-spacer {\nheight: 22px;\n\n}\nsearch {\nheight: 32px;\n\n}\n::-webkit-scrollbar { \n    background: rgb(19,19,19); \n    width: 10px; \n}\n::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { \n    background: #3d3d3d; \n}\n```\nThe command that I used to create this YouTube app is nativefier \"youtube.com\" --name \"YouTube\" --title-bar-style hiddenInset --inject 'pathToCSS', if someone wants to check out that it's working correctly. :). Yeah @ron-casey, me too.\nI downloaded the source code to check if it's correct and it is. I don't know what broke my patch, but it was working when I made the PR.. Yeah, I thought that was the only thing that could change something too, but I tried it with -e 3.0.3 and the issue persists. \ud83d\ude15. You have to add the Google SignIn url to the internal urls of the app. Use this command:\nnativefier music.youtube.com --internal-urls \"(.*?)(accounts\\.google\\.com/ServiceLogin|music\\.youtube\\.com)(.*?)\"\nWith this command you are basically saying that if the url contains \"accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin\" or \"music.youtube.com\", it should open inside the app. If you want to add another one, just add the 'other' symbol (|) after \"music.youtube.com\" and add the wanted url (without \"https://\", as the other ones) after it. But remember to escape the dots with a backslash as they mean 'any character' in Regex.\nHope it helps :). You're welcome @ronjouch! \ud83d\ude42\nAbout the fix, wouldn't it be better to add a default list of authentication domains that every nativefied app uses as internal urls? Like Google, Microsoft, Github, etc.\nCause I was thinking about this list of domain / internal-urls pairs and it seems to me that it would be too hard-coded. If all auth domains' urls are internalized, it should be a broader alternative as the list would not be that long and would work with every site that uses these auth providers without the need to hard-code each domain individually.\nThe only problem with this method that I can think of is the performance of the Regex search (and only because I don't have enough experience with it to know how long the domain list would need to be to slow down the search considerably).\nWhat do you think of this implementation?. @ronjouch I don't quite get it how there could be false positives. If the auth urls shared their domain with other sites (like Google SignIn having the same domain as another Google site) I would agree with you, but everytime someone access accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin it is to Login with Google. I can't think of any false positives in this situation.\nBut even if there are some false positives, we could simply have a parameter to remove the default auth domains, like nativefier youtube.com --no-default-auth-urls. This way if someone had a false positive (which I think it would be rare), it's possible to workaround it.\nMy main concern about having a list of pairs is that there will always have some sites that won't be in the list and will have to be manually set. In my opinion, the number of people that would have false positives with my suggestion would be far less than the number of people that would have to manually set an auth domain to a random site they want nativefied.\nWhat do you think?. I liked @allo-'s idea. And perhaps it would be nice if there was a site or a repository of already compiled binaries of common sites with custom styling (like MacOS's appbar blended with the page's styling, etc).. Ok @ronjouch, I'll give it a look and see what I can do in my spare time \ud83d\ude01\nBut just to remind you, you didn't answer my question regarding the auth domains issue.. @bacongravy In my opinion, the best outcome would be to stay the way it is but to open the auth providers internally by default. I know that would mean we would have to manually add every auth provider we know and possibly add more if someone requested or we discovered a new one, but I don't think that opening all urls internally would be a better choice as a nativefied app should be the closest possible to what a native app would be..
