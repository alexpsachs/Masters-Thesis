    "jhollingworth": "ta :)\n. it astonishes me you get paid to code... :)\n. Good point, I will look into it ASAP\n. Merged in @buzzedword's fix :)\n. Added (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/blob/master/LICENCE) :)\n. Merged in @buzzedword's pull request. Closing :)\n. Merged in patches. closing\n. Should be fixed now :)\n. Great thanks!\n. Which version of firefox? The rich text editing interface is only supported in IE8+, FF 3.5+, Safari 4+, Opera 11+ and Chrome (See https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5). \n. Hmm odd, are there any js errors in the console?\nOn 20 Mar 2012, at 17:49, javajack\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nok, FF 7.0.1 / Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/issues/9#issuecomment-4601304\n. Fantastic! Thank you :)\n. @buzzedword  thanks for looking - looks like I shall have to dust off my photoshop skills!\n. Bugger. Have you any suggestions of any compatible licences which aren't GPL? I hate GPL. There's an issue raised on the wysihtml5 project to change the licence https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/issues/22\n. Updated it (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/commit/e4c99a28e73ec95538faf00cd492577596b3d044). That's put a dampener on my day :(\n. It's a known issue with wysihtml5. Ticket has been raised https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/issues/20\n. that sir is awesome! :D\n. This is a bug in wysihtml5 not bootstrap-wysihtml5 so closing.\n. Sorry, HTML only unfortunately. I think this project is probably what you are looking for https://github.com/samwillis/pagedown-bootstrap :)\n. @hinrik's change has been merged in which should fix this\n. I have implemented the UI on my side but waiting on the latest rc of wysihtml5 which has support for it \n. Underline functionality has been added. Pull the latest version (you will need wysihtml5 rc3 as well).\n\nThanks,\nJames\n. I'm a bit confused. why not just do $('#textarea').val()?\n. The previous version of wysihtml5 had a bug which meant multiple editors wasn't supported. That's fixed now so this should all be a bit easier :)\nI will be adding to the wiki today as well. Thanks for the feedback\n. This should be fixed in the latest code (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/blob/master/src/bootstrap-wysihtml5.js)\n. Great, thank you!\n. Hi, that's next on the list :)\n. Hi, You can now insert images into the page (see http://jhollingworth.github.com/bootstrap-wysihtml5/). At the moment only insert image url's works (that's whats supported by wysihtml5) - doing proper image uploads will get a little more tricky.\nI hope this helps\nThanks,\nJames\n. It's on the list of things to do :)\n. There is now an insert link button which is shown by default. wysihtml5 currently doesn't allow you to specify the link text, I will see if I can add that functionality\n. Awesome! Thank you :)\n. Yeah - makes complete sense. I'd like to expose everything that wysihtml5 does via the options object. Just gotta find the time :)\n. Hmm, odd. could you provide me with some more info? browser, os, etc.\nThanks!\n. hmm annoying - I've got it open in chrome on osx right now and everything is fine. \nit might be a script ordering or something. any chance you could send me more of the html? \n. ah ok, no problem :) my fault for not responding sooner! \nI will close for now, if you find the time to get me some more info I will re-open.\nThanks!\n. I have added support to edit the html. It's not on by default, to use you need to do:\njavascript\n$('#textarea').wysihtml5({\n    \"html\": true\n});\nLet me know if there are any issues\n. that's a bug - I will fix asap. thanks :)\n. Agreed. Updated.\n. Sorry, haven't tried it as of yet. If I get a chance over the next few days I will have a play\nThanks!\n. I think this is more of a wysihtml5 question, it's probably worth asking on their issues list https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/issues\nThanks!\n. It's currently not supported by wysihtml5 but I really want it as well so I will see if I can implement it at some point \n. Plan for today: improve documentation :) \n. Hi, I've improved the readme with more info (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5), added a download which has all the required files (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/downloads) and also mentioned the bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails gem on the readme file for any rails devs. \nI hope that helps! \nThanks,\nJames\n. Updated readme file with exact files that need to be referenced (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5).\nThe zip file in the downloads section (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/downloads) contains everything you need to get started with it.\nThanks for the feedback :) \n. That should be fixed now :) Thanks!\n. Agreed and added in :)\nYou can add events like so:\njavascript\n$('#textarea').wysihtml5({\n    events: {\n        \"load\": function() { \n            console.log('loaded!');\n        }\n    }\n});\nThanks!\n. The functionality isn't currently exposed via the wysihtml5 API. I'm happy to implement it but just checking with them first to see if they are happy to include it (https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/issues/42)\n. My pull request has been accepted (https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/pull/45). I will add the needed functionality asap\n. Hi, good suggestions. I will add it to my backlog :)\nThanks,\nJames\n. Hi, wysihtlm5 requires the textarea to have an id. \nthis modification should work:\njavascript\nvar textarea = $(\"<textarea id=\\\"\" + new Date().getTime() + \"\\\"></textarea>\");\nHope this helps!\nThanks,\nJames\n. Fix should be in there now. Thanks\n. Can you please give me some more info?\n. Great, thanks!\n. That's been fixed now. You can use any jQuery selector you want. \nSorry for the delay in getting back to you on this one\nThanks,\nJames\n. awesome! thanks :)\n. awesome! thanks :)\n. awesome! thanks :)\n. Awesome! Thanks :)\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. OW\n. @serialseb sounds like a sensible addition. I will try and have a look at some point unless you want to send a pull request? :) Also, any chance you could do a French translation?\n. Hi, the code has changed a bit since the pull request (due to locales) but I have added the change in (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/commit/fa3053fc3a2096371d855e8656393432a491f62e)\nthanks!\n. I'd prefer to not have a global object since there might be multiple editors on a page which each require their own templates. @robashton has just submitted something similar (#80) which allows you to configure the templates for each template individually\nThanks for the pull request though :) \n. @edslocomb fixed this in #95, thanks!\n. Graet, thanks!\n. Great thanks!\n. this is awesome! thank you :)\n. Awesome, thankyou!\n. thanks!\n. Hi, \nWhen passing in the options, set image to false, e.g.\njavascript\n$('#some-textarea').wysihtml5({\n    \"font-styles\": true, \n    \"emphasis\": true, \n    \"lists\": true,\n    \"html\": false,\n    \"link\": true, \n    \"image\": false\n});\n. Thanks for the comments. With regards to changes to code, I would prefer them in the form of a pull request. Much easier to discuss at that point\nThanks,\nJames\n. Awesome! thank you for all these commits :)\n. Great, thanks! \n. :grin: \n. Thanks :smile: \n. brought in (8d94af57f5d49efe3f62381ea5bc3ef4f93384b0), thanks! \n. ",

Not much can be done until that's patched up. I'll dig around on their side.\n. Huh! That's interesting. I'll send a pull in with the changes after testing it out. Nice find, @allochi!\n. Submitted a patch for this in #8 and #10-- should be out of your hair if they're cleared.\n. :( boo. Confirmed this is an issue. Just tried using onPaste/onAfterPaste events with designmode activation-- usually works for me with contentEditable blobs, but not this time.\nLooks like @jhollingworth has to suss this one out alone. Sorry bud.\n. Keep posted to the main xing/wysihtml5 branch-- once it gets sussed out there, it should be merged down here. That's definitely an issue with their editor.\n. Funny you just commented on it, they added more documentation for the events they publish which clears up some of the issues here. Looking into the composer events to monitor copy/paste actions.\nedit or I'm an idiot and didn't see the needle in the haystack there-- composer docs have just been chilling in the middle. My bad. Looking into it either way.\n. No problem. Just put another one in fixing up pages. Drives me insane to clone a repo with .DS_Store's in them, plays havoc on some of my automators. Figured I'd contribute back.\n. Just included the dropdown fix with this pull request.\n. Sweet! Don't forget to close out #3-- the updated pull request fixed that too.\n. Looks like this is coming from bootstrap's provided \"glyphicons-halflings\" icon set. Doesn't appear to have a numeric list icon anywhere in it. That's unfortunate.

This should put a lighter step in your day-- wysihtml5 has been updated to the MIT license. https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/issues/22#issuecomment-4612193\n. @Nerian, are you setting the options for the editor? Also if you have a gist, gh-pages, or repo to reference that'd be super helpful to build a test case.\n. Well that settles that.\n. That project has a pretty neat ordered list icon (ref #12) in case you're interested.\n. I'm wondering if an i18n language schema would be a bit overkill, or if this should be a user specific option set. Cool idea though, definitely worth looking into.\n. ",

Ah, it looks like you're trying to do something different, instantiating the editor within an iframe you've set up yourself.\nI'm referring to the simple case, where the only iframe in the application is the one wysihtml5 itself creates to house its contenteditable document; capybara doesn't seem to be able to get ahold of anything within that iframe.\n.

Where did you download version 0.3.1?\nwysihtml5 is currently at version 0.3.0, and bootstrap-wysihtml is at version 0.0.2\n. Are you using a recent download?  There was a bug with multiple editors per page that was fixed not too long ago.\nIf that doesn't do it for you, could you be a little more specific about \"doesn't work\"?

Ah, I spoke too soon. The JSON sample file had an error in it. I've corrected it and pushed - the index.html sample page now works fine for me.\n. Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding, but those seem like issues outside the scope of this pull request. Are they specific to the images listing?\n. I've made some more changes that I think will be pretty useful. The most notable is that now there's an ajax file upload field right in the image insert modal, making it much easier to add images on the fly.\nI do have a couple problems I'm encountering, if anyone has any suggestions I'd be very appreciative:\n- The initImageUpload(); function is currently whenever the image modal is clicked. This doesn't really work since that means the function is initiated several times. However, when I add it elsewhere, it seems to get called before the modal is ready, so it never is able to get the DOM object.\n- the imagesUrl default value isn't getting overridden by the instantiation options.\n- I'm getting the Uncaught Error: INVALID_NODE_TYPE_ERR: DOM Range Exception 2 sporadically. I'm not able to make it appear consistently.\nI'm afraid I'm a bit stumped by these problems, so if anyone has ideas, that'd be great. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I'll try that out this evening.\nThe callback for image uploading sounds like a good idea, as well as the tab menu enabling.\nFor the callback, how much do you think should be set up in advance in the template? It needs an iframe in there to do the \"ajax\" upload, so that could either be in the template, or created on the fly with jquery in the callback.\nI'll also work on removing the ID's, and replacing with $.find() methods. One thing is that the iFrame is targeted by the form using the iframe's name attribute, so if people are instantiating multiple wysiwigs on a page using one jquery selector, it might be difficult to make that work.\nLooking forward to seeing what you come up with re: thumbnails and delete links.\n. I've worked in @sams edits and suggestions. I've also included what I think is likely to be the most common upload callback function into the sample html.\nI'm still getting the Uncaught Error: INVALID_NODE_TYPE_ERR: DOM Range Exception 2 error, but that seems to be related to issue #138, so I don't think it's a function of the additions.\n.

    "tmaiaroto": "Yea, this is missing a lot of functionality of wysihtml5. It seems to hide it or cut it off in some manner. I'm going to have to rip through this but would rather not. I'm hoping there's a way to extend things... I'd love to add a speech button for starters (tried appending it to the toolbar with the load event but I imagine it's too late at that point). Then I'd love to start building plugins. Which I see how to change up the template for things, but will need greater control.\nAlso tried with custom templates key, but it didn't seem to work either. I could change existing ones but couldn't add new buttons.\nA code button would be a big +1 from me.\n. Yay, figured it out.\n$('#your-textarea').wysihtml5({\n    toolbar: { speech: '<li><a data-wysihtml5-command=\"insertSpeech\">speech</a></li>' }\n});\nI imagine custom commands will need to be built using the functionality of https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5 and then referenced here...\n. As far as your code concerns, you can keep the code tag by doing:\nparserRules: {\n    tags: {\n        code: {}\n        }\n}\nIn the options you pass to wysihtml5() but you're going to still need a button that runs a command to wrap the code in a <code> block unless you wanted to just set html: true and manually do it. If you also set stylesheets: ['bootstrap.min.css']  (whatever your bootstrap css path is) then you'll see that code block in the editor turn red and have a gray background.\n. You can add  blocks with:\n$('#your-textarea').wysihtml5({ toolbar: {\n   code:  function(locale, options) {\n    return '<li><a class=\"btn\" data-wysihtml5-command=\"formatInline\" data-wysihtml5-command-value=\"code\" href=\"javascript:;\" unselectable=\"on\"><i class=\"icon-beer\"></i></li>'\n   }\n});\nNow you're all set for the  blocks...I'm trying to figure out how to do even more though.\n. Ok, it's a little hacky, but I pasted it all out for everyone. If you want a really bad ass editor, use this:\n$('.wysihtml5').wysihtml5('deepExtend', {\n                stylesheets: ['/li3b_core/css/bootstrap.min.css'],\n                toolbar: {\n                    speech: '<li>' +\n                            '<a class=\"btn\" data-wysihtml5-command=\"insertSpeech\" title=\"Voice input\" href=\"javascript:;\" unselectable=\"on\"><i class=\"icon-volume-up\"></i></a>' +\n                        '</li>',\n                    code:  function(locale, options) {\n                        return '<li><a class=\"btn\" data-wysihtml5-command=\"formatInline\" data-wysihtml5-command-value=\"code\" href=\"javascript:;\" unselectable=\"on\"><i class=\"icon-th-large\"></i></li>'\n                    },\n                    insertAnything:  function(locale, options) {\n                            return '<li>' +\n                                '<a class=\"btn\" data-wysihtml5-command=\"insertHTML\" href=\"javascript:;\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#insertAnythingModal\" unselectable=\"on\"><i class=\"icon-asterisk\"></i></a>' +\n                                '<div id=\"insertAnythingModal\" data-wysihtml5-dialog=\"insertHTML\" class=\"modal hide fade\">' +\n                                    '<div class=\"modal-header\">' +\n                                        '<a class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">&times;</a>' +\n                                        '<h3>Insert Some Stuff</h3>' +\n                                    '</div>' +\n                                    '<div class=\"modal-body\">' +\n                                        '<textarea id=\"myJazz\"></textarea>' +\n                                    '</div>' +\n                                    '<div class=\"modal-footer\">' +\n                                        '<a class=\"btn\" href=\"javascript:;\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Cancel</a>' +\n                                        '<a class=\"btn btn-primary\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" data-wysihtml5-command=\"insertHTML\" onClick=\"$(this).attr(\\'data-wysihtml5-command-value\\', $(\\'#myJazz\\').val()); $(\\'#myJazz\\').val(\\'\\')\" data-wysihtml5-command-value=\"jazz\" href=\"javascript:;\" unselectable=\"on\">Insert</a>' +\n                                    '</div>' +\n                                '</div>' +\n                            '</li>';\n                    },\n                },\n                html: true,\n                parserRules: {\n                    classes: {\n                      \"middle\": 1,\n                      \"icon-beer\": 1,\n                      \"prettyprint\": 1\n                    },\n                    tags: {\n                        code: {},\n                        pre: {},\n                        strong: {},\n                        em: {},\n                        i: {}\n                    }\n                }\n            });\nBasically... You're using the \"insertHTML\" command that exists in wysihtml5. The first anchor doesn't really do what \"insertHTML\" normally does, it just brings up the modal. The link within the modal then sets the data attribute.\nAlternatively, you can insert any text with \"insertHTML\" in a static manner like so:\ninsertThis: function(locale, options) {\n                        return '<li><a class=\"btn\" data-wysihtml5-command=\"insertHTML\" data-wysihtml5-command-value=\"I got inserted.\" href=\"javascript:;\"><i class=\"icon-ok\"></i></a></li>';\n                    }\nNote: You can not do both because you can only have one of each command.\nSo it's a bit hacky, but works. I suppose you could make that modal do a bunch of stuff and then send back the final HTML value, combining the command into a big multi-function button. It kinda stinks you can't add multiple of the same command because it could get confusing and leave you in a situation of being limited.\n. You can also look at this guy's solution: http://itsnot.freehostia.com/wysihtml5/wysihtml5-new.htm ... But you have to have focus and I think have something typed in order for the insert to work. You may be able to fix it up so it works a little nicer though.\n. As it turns out, after all this hard work...The thing submits an empty string for me. So wysihtml5 is dead to me. Moved to CKEditor. So glad to have wasted an entire day. Hopefully this helps someone though.\n. Well, now that my frustrations have gone away =) I may give it another shot haha.\n. ",

Plz check out my repo, which Supports bs3. \n. Oh, you don't have to use handlebars in your project. It's only using handlebars internally for the templates and only the runtime version (about 3k).\n. As mentioned here: https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/issues/497\nThis repo is not maintained. I suggest switching over to https://github.com/Waxolunist/bootstrap3-wysihtml5-bower\n. Sorry, I can't. Because this was fixed in the fork by edicy/wysihtml5. \nYou are using a not maintained component based on a not maintained editor.\nThe changes from bs2 to bs3 haven't been big, just some classes have changed.\nWhat you could do is to fork my repo and change the templates. Shouldn't be a big deal.\nMaybe you can add an option for bs2, which adds the correct classes instead of the bs3 classes.\n. This Repo is not maintained anymore. I would ask here: https://github.com/Nerian/bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails \n. This repo is not maintained any more. Feature Request to one of the named sibling projects in the readme.\n. This repo is not maintained anymore.\nMaybe you can use my fork which should be able to achieve what you want.\nSee here: https://github.com/Waxolunist/bootstrap3-wysihtml5-bower#custom-templates-for-toolbar-buttons\n.
