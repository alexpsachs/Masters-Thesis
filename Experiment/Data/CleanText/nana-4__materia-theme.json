    "MichaelTiebesl": "I have installed Arch with Gnome 3.18. For me it looks very nice the dashed line. I like the details. Also the top-bar height looks good to me. \n\n. I saw that https://github.com/tista500/Adapta has forked from Flat-Plat.\nI already tested it. I can see the progress bar is with Adapta working how it should be. Maybe you can take a look at that to fix it with your theme?\n. @nana-4 Thanks for the update.\n. @cthbleachbit thanks for your reply. Asking myself now if there is a problem with locale, why is it with the default Adwaita, the Gnome Shell correct?\n. After the re-install from the theme, the text was back to normal.\n. ",
    "alim0x": "top-bar height absolutely have no problem, I just think if it can be more slim, maybe will be more friendly to laptop user, because the laptop's screen size is not big enough, slim top-bar looks good when you maximize window\n. ",
    "nana-4": "I admit that 2px width dash sometimes looks noisy. However, 1px is a bit hard to find at a glance.\nI think around 26px is a bit too slim on desktop. (I was tested on 28px.) This theme widgets are designed slightly bigger to be good for high-resolution.\nSo, unfortunately I do not change them at the moment.\n. @sevachka \n\nIs there an easy way to remover these \"stiches\" (dash)?\n\nYes. \n1. Open gtk-3.0/gtk.css and gtk-3.0/gtk-dark.css with text editor.\n2. Find .undershoot.* around 2338 lines.\n3. Edit code like this:\n\n.undershoot.top {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 50%);\n  padding-top: 1px;\n  background-size:  10px 1px;\n  background-repeat: repeat-x;\n  background-origin: content-box;\n  background-position: center top; }\n- Bold = changes\n. Thanks :)\n\nYeah, I have a plan to make complete dark theme. But to complete this work, we need some important tasks. Therefore, it becomes a little later to be released.(a few weeks after, maybe?)\n. I apologize that it didn't go as planned.\nBecause it doesn't go very well to make the images for dark theme, I was frustrated it. \nHowever, I'll get down to this work again. So please wait a little while.\n. @pms1969 Thank you for your information. However, this material design guideline does not suggest using light weight fonts for normal body (Body 1), so I hesitate to change Roboto to Roboto Light with this repo. In addition, there is no way to change fonts only for HiDPI version. Therefore, I think it is better for each user to change the fonts by oneself. :). @mbacou Thank you, but aren't you enabling \"Large Text\"?\n\nI don't have a HiDPI display, so I don't know if it is correct, but at least from your screenshot it doesn't look like HiDPI. In any case, as far as I know, there is no way to use the user's system font size for gnome-shell. I also hope so the upstream devs support it.. @mbacou I see... Your information was helpful. Thanks.. I'm so sorry that the correspondence was very delayed.\nFinally, global dark theme was supported!\nFor transparency top bar, which had some requests, I'd like to implement it if this is supported by upstream.\nAlternatively, using Dynamic Panel Transparency is also good solution for now.. Please suggest me what kind of wallpaper is better, everyone :+1: \nYou can also change background image by yourself:\n1. Download and extract source code archive from here.\n2. Replace noise-texture.png in extracted gnome-shell directory with same name.\n3. In terminal, move to gnome-shell directory.\n$ cd ~/Downloads/Flat-Plat/gnome-shell\n4. Make new binary file.\n$ ./gnome-shell-theme.gresource.sh\n5. Replace an existing file with a generated file.\n$ cp gnome-shell-theme.gresource /usr/share/gnome-shell\n6. Restart GNOME Shell. (press Alt+F2, then type r)\n\nThe referring page:\n https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GDM\n\nPS: I'll consider about donations, thanks. :smiley: \n. I am terribly sorry about responding so late...\nNow, I changed GDM wallpaper based on Material Design color pallet with slight radial gradient.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it OK? You guys comments became very helpful resource. :smile: \n. Oh, sorry for your crashes, but this git master branch is made for GNOME 3.18.\nPlease try the following command to choose 3.16 branch, and check whether it work.\ngit checkout 3.16\nBy the way, it is usually safer to get the archives from here:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/releases\n. Thank you for bug report.\nI'm going to fix it.\n. @MichaelTiebesl I just changed a image(ProgressBar/trough.png) from semi-transparent to opaque to fix it.\n. @MichaelTiebesl No problem!\n. Overlay scrollbar is semi-transparent right now.\nUsability decreases if it is transparent.\n. In checkbuttons/radiobuttons, GTK3 is currently not support CSS transition/animation...\nBecause there is technical limitation, I changed their design.\n. It was supported in GTK+ 3.20.\n. Thank you for your bug report.\nI'm going to fix it.\n. My apologies for the late reply...\nHonestly, I don't want to support so old versions because I don't have much time for development.\nHowever, I would like to re-support the Metacity for compatibility. ;)\n. It was supported with 1b44bf7a575a735b61820ee6774ec6f05ef8f09a.\n. \nI don't really like the window's edge becomes ambiguous by the outer and inner shadows.\nSorry, but I can't merge this for my taste.\n. Sorry, but I cannot imagine well what you mean.\nWhy margins? When some margins is inserted, becomes meaningless to be shadows, I think...\n. I'd like to support Unity.\nHowever, I have many other stuffs to do before that.\nTherefore, please do not expect it immediately. ;)\n. Added Unity support for now :)\n. Hmm, maybe you're using the wrong version of the theme. Flat-Plat currently supports only Ubuntu 16.04 and it uses GTK+ 3.18.x. So you should get this theme from 3.18 branch or here.\n. @rahilwazir That's weird. Will it be white even if you reboot your system?\n. @rahilwazir I'm sorry for the late reply. I changed color scheme of the theme 2cd76e49eb9c4719d76143bd78fc8a572333b43f, so I believe that it was fixed...\n. I'm not working yet, but I'm going to support GNOME/GTK 3.20 in the near future.\n. It supported (some time ago :smiley:).\n. It seems to be fixed by upstream changes. So I close this issue.. I like the new accent color personally.\nThe pink color is used for accents in many Material Design samples, and it looks nice with various primary color, imo. Try this: https://www.getmdl.io/customize/index.html\nP.S. I'll reconsider about the problem of GDM wallpaper... Thanks for your bug report.\n. Sorry for my late reply.\nWell, I've tried a variety of color schemes (including \"teal\" and \"deep-orange\"), which also did not match for me.\nI'll change it if there is something better color scheme, but I don't want to return to the old color scheme because Flat UI Colors is not Material Design color palette. :sweat_smile:\n. @DarthWound Indeed. It would be more appropriate to write in HACKING.md than README.md. I'ill write about the change_color.sh script.. I wrote about the script with caa354b2177673fe5bddfe586c8f7707477b87c1. (Sorry for being late.)\n@DarthWound \nThank you for your kind words and thoughtfulness. :)\nUnfortunately, some influential websites introduce folk themes without mentioning it's a derivative of Materia. Not only that, they often tell Materia's ideas as if they were ideas from the fork theme itself. So, that's a shame but this theme may not be well-known to people.. The big difference from Debian/Ubuntu is that Materia (or Flat-Plat) is not mentioned even 1/5 times. Everyone knows that Ubuntu is based on Debian, but Materia and its forks are not. I often see such wording:\n\nFlat-Plat is very similar to Adapta.\nFlat-Plat looks like Adapta.\nAdapta has compact variant for low-resolution. That's a good idea.\n\nWhen I see such words, I feel pretty complicated. It sounds like Flat-Plat mimicked Adapta. I think such a misunderstanding is what the media induced. Until recently I ignored it, but as I thought that misunderstanding will spread more and more as I leave it out, I started protesting against such a media that is the primary cause. \ud83d\ude03 . Okay, in v20180321, this theme got a big color scheme change and changed the accent color from Pink A200 #FF4081 to Teal 500 #009688 (thanks to your opinions). Now the color scheme is much close to the original one!\nI think this issue is now outdated, so I opened new issue and would like to close this. If you have any opinions about (new) color scheme, please put it here: #220 \nThank you all for your valuable suggestion. :smile: . I grasped it. Thanks!\n. It is by design. It shows the focus state.\n. Sorry for the late reply and the inconvenience.\nMaybe this problem should have been fixed with the added commit, but could you please test it just in case?\n. @zagortenay333 \nPreviously, there was a problem that gnome-shell has been clashed when 3.18 theme apply to 3.16.\nAt that time, I've noticed that the bloated(?) process-working is due.\nTherefore, I've imagined that it's also the culprit this time.\nno-events and no-notifications are just because they are not displayed when they aren't in parent directory.\nSee lines 1040-1041: https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell/blob/master/js/ui/calendar.js\n(Sorry for my bad English.)\n. Sorry for the late reply. I'll fix it.\n@tista500 Perfect! This was very helpful for me! Thanks for your advice. :)\n. It looks wrong position. However, all of the themes that disable popup's arrow seems to become like this.\nI think this is the gnome-shell's issue.\n. It has become late, but I just fixed it to make sure.\n. ???\nI think that its behavior does not differ with adwaita.\n\n. Hmm, it seems to set the sizes in the app side.\nIf we adopt this method, it will be affected to the other apps' size.\nI think this is Lollypop's issue, not mine. :(\n. It seems to be fixed by upstream changes. So I close this issue.. I'm sorry for the delayed response, but I can't reproduce it.\nWhat version of Gnome Boxes are you using?\n. There is no response so I'll close the issue.\nBut if you have any questions, please feel free to ask again.\n. I'm sorry for late reply.\nI was added a smaller size version for a small-resolution screen. So please try gtk_laptop.css and gtk-dark_laptop.css after rename them.\n. I daringly turned off the fading because it is annoyed for me. :/\n. Why is it necessary to do this?\nAre there any apps that is not displayed correctly if we don't do this?\n. Sorry for the neglect. I couldn\u2019t understand the necessity of this. This might convenient indeed, but there is a problem. That's because GNOME Shell doesn't support multiple versioned themes at the moment. It may lead to confusion or danger for GNOME Shell users. Also it will increase the maintenance burden. Therefore, I cannot accept this at least until GNOME Shell supports multiple versioned themes.\n. I am so sorry for the late response.\nI was fixed the phenomenon in which buttons turns white.\nBut it is hard to resolve the weird status of the radiobuttons at the moment. (unless it sacrifice animations...)\n. @sharifzadesina It seems that the size of checkboxes is fixed to 15px on LibreOffice of the GTK2 version.\nOn LibreOffice of the GTK3 version (5.2 or higher), it was solved, so I would like you to wait it.\n. @nathaneltitane Hmm, okay, I'll reconsider about check/radiobuttons sizing. Thanks. \ud83d\udc4d\n. Now radiobuttons issues on Firefox is almost gone (except with dark variant).\nThis problem still remains in LibreOffice, but I'd like to clarify the (duplicate) issues, so I opened a new issue as #122 and #123.\nSo I'd like to close this now, but thank you for your report. :). I'm really sorry for the reply late. I just fixed it for now. But if there is still any problems, please report :smiley: \n. @ivandotv \nI couldn't reproduce the problem on Fedora 26.\n\nWould you tell me which version you are using?\n- Synapse\n- Distribution\n- Flat-Plat. @ivandotv \nAha, Ubuntu 16.04... I got it.\nI just thought that older version (gtk+ 3.18.x) would work properly.... I'm really sorry for the late reply, but I don\u2019t know that where are you pointing about \"log screen\".\nI might be able to help you if you show screenshots or something...\n. There is no response so I'll close the issue.\nBut if you have any questions, please feel free to ask again.\n. Please accept my apologies for my long silence. But I dare to do this way because I thought Blue Grey is easy on the eyes than Grey. So, I can't merge it.\n. Thanks :smiley: \n. Sorry for the late reply.\nI think that this is an upstream bug and it was solved in the newer versions.\n. I'm so sorry for my late reply.\nUnfortunately, there is no plan to add a non transparent version, but some widgets in newer master repo has become opaque.\n. My apologies for the late reply. What version of Nautilus are you using?\n. @mbirth For now I'm waiting for @isaagar to finish his work (#164)... The package for Debian would work on Ubuntu as well.\n@actionless Thanks for your work.. @igor-dyatlov Great! Thank you very much!! I've added your PPA/commands to the README. (Please let me know if you have any issues.)\nBTW, I'm not very sure but if the debian package (#164) becomes available, I may replace it from the README. :). @igor-dyatlov I agree with you. Thanks for your support, btw.. I'm sorry for the late reply.\nAre you talking about GTK2 theming? If you so, unfortunately, there is no way to achieve it, AFAIK.\n. There is no response so I'll close the issue.\nBut if you have any questions, please feel free to ask again.\n. Thanks for your help! :sweat_smile:\n. It was supported with 1b44bf7a575a735b61820ee6774ec6f05ef8f09a.\n. I'm sorry, but it will be displayed without any problems in my environment:\n\n. There is some truth, but I can\u2019t come to like the Inverted tooltips color.\nI will pass on that this time, sorry.\n. Exactly, the current GTK2 theme had various problems. Therefore, I just rebuilt it from scratch. Please try the latest one from repo.\n. @jayarc Ok, thanks!\n. The new color scheme version is still in development.\nI'm going to update screenshots when the theme is stable.\n. It has been supported with 6edb24d6750b4adafcc6c61e421331d2844e19d9.\n. I'm sorry for late reply.\nIt is by design. Those rings show the focus state.\nBut you can remove it by editing the gtkrc file in the gtk-2.0 directory:\n```\n # Focuslines\nimage \n {\n     function                    = FOCUS\n     file   = \"Others/focus.svg\"\n     border   = { 2, 2, 2, 2 }\n     stretch   = TRUE\n        }\n```\nto\n```\n # Focuslines\nimage \n {\n     function                    = FOCUS\n }\n```\nIf you using master branch, edit around \"assets/focus.png\" in the main.rc file.\n. Okay, I will flatten buttons on the part of toolbars (e.g. Rhythmbox).\n. @metarmask \nI almost agree. However,\n\nIt also says that buttons should be uppercase.\n\nGNOME/GTK buttons might contain a proper noun. (e.g. font name, file name, etc.)\nI think they shouldn't be uppercase, so I'm reluctant to implement it.\n. @metarmask Hmm, unfortunately, it is not technically easy IMHO.\n. Maybe its switchs width are hard-coded. But I've added a slight modification.\n\n. Hmm, I might be available the light title bars version again.\n@El-Zipo Theme is under GPL, so you can fork it, of course!\n. @sharifzadesina \nSorry for the late reply.\nThere is some reason, but biggest reason is that I wanted to be more Material Design to this theme.\nIn Material design guidelines, most apps have dark (or colored) title bar.\nBtw, I'm going to release a version with light title bars. :)\n. Finally, light title bar version is now available. You can get it from the top page.\nAnd I apologize for the release being delayed.\n. @curvi Sorry for the delay. It is now available.\n. Thank you for your bug report. I just fixed the text color.\nHowever, the second issue is reproduced in other themes, so I think that it is upstream issue.\n. It was supported with 2cd76e49eb9c4719d76143bd78fc8a572333b43f.\n. I know what you mean. BUT this is GTK theme, not Android theme. GNOME guidelines and components are not same with MD. I think that it is more important to bridge the gap between GNOME and MD than to follow MD guidelines perfectly. So I don't dare follow them in order to reduce the discomfort.\nP.S.\nEven in MD guidelines, entries on complex screen that have shadows.\nCheck here: https://material.google.com/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-behavior\n. Flat-Plat is currently not supported Xfce, but I will support it if I have time.\n. I added initial implementation for Xfce theming (GTK3), although it's not yet perfect. (Supporting for GTK2 version is also not yet.)\nTested on Xfce 4.13 (Ubuntu 18.10). TODO:\n- [ ] GTK3: FIx #XfceNotifyWindow styling\n- [ ] GTK3: FIx #xfwm-tabwin styling\n- [x] ~Xfwm4: Change frame width to 2px~\n- [x] ~Xfwm4: Change corner radius to 4px~\n- [ ] GTK2: Support Xfce 4.12 (hopefully). Hi @DarthWound, thanks for your suggestion.\nI agree that Materia should support v4.12 as well. But Materia uses #212121 instead of #383838 for panels by default. So I'd choose that color unless there is any special reason :)\n. I think this is a particular issue of Xfce, so I'd like to close this as a duplicate of #60.. Sorry for the late reply.\nI don\u2019t know why, but it seems to require a Metacity theme.\n. It was supported with a7cc6778b9b0e44708257d7ef1761810e8e4b47b.\n. Thank you for your bug report. :)\n. @rahilwazir I've merged this. :)\n. I can't reproduce this. Does this happen only in Flat-Plat?\n. > original Adapta\nWTF o_O\nBTW, does it happen with other themes like Adwaita, Arc, etc.?\n. Thank you for your screenshots.\nHmm, that's strange.\nThere is no problem on my environment. :/\n\n. That's good. The menubar was just fixed now. See #63\nSo I'll close this. :)\n. @daltones \nHmm, that's very strange.\nBecause I do not give any special styling to Atom.\nI tried installing Atom on the latest Ubuntu and Fedora from the official website, but there was no visual problem.\nAnyway, I'll try to solve the issue if I have time.\nThanks for your information.. @daltones Oh, I see.\nNow I cannot make sure it because I have no Arch environment. But I may have understood the cause.\nThanks for the detailed information. It helped! \ud83d\ude03 . Added a fix for now. Please let me know if there are any problems remaining (except for accelerator on the right of the menuitem, I couldn't find a workaround for that).. I'm already releasing a laptop version for small resolution.\nIs it still large?\n. There is no response, so I'll close the issue.\n. The size of the check/radiobuttons are based on Material design guidelines.\nSee here: https://material.google.com/components/selection-controls.html\nand here of Keyline shapes : https://material.google.com/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons\nAnd I think 16px is a bit too small. :(\n. Well, it's undecided for now.\n. I'm going to release v3.22 before September 21. ;)\n. @atompie Yes, I'm going to release the light title bar version in the near future.\n. Released this.\n. @atompie I'm so sorry for the delay, but light bar version is not yet available (because there are some onerous problems..). However, I will undertake this now, so please wait a moment.\n. Thank you for your bug report. It was fixed with #63. I'll release modified version in the near future. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Thank you for your bug report. \ud83d\udc4d \nI believe it was resolved...\n. @junrrein Thanks! \ud83d\ude03 \n. It was fixed with #63.\n. It related with #34.\n. This issue has been almost solved with recent updates.\nHowever, it still remains with dark variants, so I opened a new issue as #123.\nSo I'd like to close this now, but thank you for your report. :). Thank you for the report. :)\n. Hmm, I think the old style doesn't fit to this theme. Also there is no style like the alternating color rows in Material Design guidelines. So I cannot accept it, sorry.\nHowever, you can restore the style by rewriting gtk-2.0/main.rc.\nRemove the following rows (lines 92-95):\nGtkTreeView::allow-rules          = 0\n  #\u00a0Set this because some apps read it\n  GtkTreeView::odd-row-color        = @base_color\n  GtkTreeView::even-row-color       = @base_color\n. @CreamyCookie According to the GTK+ 3 doc, adding the following code to gtk.css or gtk-dark.css should work:\ncss\n* {\n  -GtkTreeView-allow-rules: 1;\n  -GtkTreeView-even-row-color: #EEEEEE;\n}\nbut strange, it doesn't work in my environment (GTK+ 3.24.1). Probably this is an upstream bug, unfortunately.. Wow, it looks really great! Thank you for your hard work!\nI'd love to incorporate your brilliant work, but it might be better to have a separate repository as MPL. :)\n. @cthbleachbit Hmm, I don't think it's odd to stuff them. Because they are intended to match the appearance of this theme. And also, app specific style are not always only addons. For example, this GTK3 or GTK2 theme also has specific styling for third party apps.\n. Sorry but I was also busy with other stuff, so I could not focus on this.\nBTW, I also noticed that Firefox might remove support for heavyweight themes. So I was experimentally making a theme based on the firefox-gnome-css repo and @Scindix 's great theme. This is still under development, so the code is quite dirty and big bugs are left. (e.g. the close button is not displayed on the top right.) But I will publish it in the hope of being helpful for something. \ud83d\ude0e\nHere: http://pastebin.com/Fz2Sq4Er\nIt is installable via Stylish.\n\nUpdate: I've added previews.\n1. with HTitle\n   \n2. without HTitle\n   \n. @jgato \nSorry for the late reply.\nIt seems that you are setting devtools.theme to dark.\nTo display the theme correctly, please reset the value or change the value to light.\n\n. @Baemir \nI'm not the author of  flat-plat.xpi, but you should be able to install it using this:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/checkcompatibility/. Hi, I'm sorry for the late response.\nWell, I investigated a bit about the future trend of Firefox themes and found some good materials.\n- https://www.ghacks.net/2017/01/16/firefox-new-default-theme-theme-api-makes-an-appearance/\n- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ebB02HHc5Ni_ZyUwA41vJ9OlZsTEAMFOpXCaCqvuGTE/edit\n- https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-themes/tree/master/notes\n- http://browser-config.herokuapp.com/\nIf my understanding is not wrong, it seems that the new \"Firefox theme\" will be like the Chrome theme, and detailed customization by CSS is likely to be impossible as @Scindix pointed out. ~I didn't assume this, haha...~\nI don't know what will happen in the future, but even if I continue to develop the CSS-based theme, it is likely that efforts will be in vain, so I'd like to stop this work once and see how it goes.\nP.S.1. Either way I also would like to see the stylish script adjusted by @Scindix. :D\nP.S.2. Although it is true that some functions are restricted by migrating to WebExtensions, I think it is reasonable from the viewpoint of maintainability, standardization, etc.. I think userChrome.css is no longer available as well as many extensions (because XUL is no longer used in Firefox). I agree with approaching GNOMEy as much as possible, but now let's await for next-gen themes ability to be announced. :)\np.s. The check box issue has now been fixed now.. @The-King-of-Toasters Oh, I seem to have jumped to the conclusion. Thanks for teaching me!. I'm sorry for my neglect and the confusion. This was reported when the current -compact variant was named -laptop variant. That means, he required a more compact variant than the current -compact variant.\nI thought I can make the -compact variant more compact, but it was not as easy as I thought for several reasons. So I couldn't answer \"yes\" or \"no\" immediately to his request.\nI'm still seeking the possibility of making the -compact variant more compact, so I'd like to keep this issue open. :). I believe this is a font problem. In GNOME Shell, we must specify font families to gnome-shell.css.\nIn order to work around this problem, you need to specify any font. Try to edit as following:\n1. Open gnome-shell.css in Flat-Plat/gnome-shell/ and move to line 26.\n2. Add your any font in the beginning of the value as following.\n\nfont-family: your-font, \"M+ 1c\", Roboto, Cantarell, Sans-Serif;\n3. Reload the gnome-shell theme.\n. I'm sorry for being so late in reply...but your report information is too little, so I can't help you. Did you see the issue template? Anyway, it seems you have installed the wrong version of the theme.\n. There's no response, so I close this issue.. Sorry for the late response. I had a hard time fixing it..\n. @wimstefan \nOn my system (Fedora 24 and 25) the menus render correctly.\nSo I don't have any good ideas at this point. :worried:\nBut there seems to be sometimes fixed by reinstalling apps like this.\n. > Thanks for taking the time to reply!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nWhat I also notice btw is that Thunderbird has a dark background in the menus with a dark font\n\nReally? It should have already been fixed. Maybe you are using an older Flat-Plat version? The latest stable version is released on November 9th.\n\nWhich other apps do you recommend to re-install?\n\nSorry I don't know the details, but only Libreoffice should be okay...\n. @wimstefan \nHmm. I've never used awesome, but in order to properly render them for awesome, it may be necessary to have its specific styling. I'll investigate if there is time. Sorry I couldn't help this time.\nThe image is an example of display in the GNOME shell 3.20.\n\n. @sbsbs15 Thank you for your help.\nI tackled a little to solve those problems (e.g. referred to Adapta's code or tried other methods) and I understood somewhat of workarounds. However, unfortunately, applying specific styles to Libreoffice seems much more difficult than for other apps.\nSo I need more time and contemplation to solve those problems. But I will work on it in the near future. Thanks. :). I fixed the hover effect issue in recent updates.. I'm sorry for the late reply, and thanks for your polite report. :)\nI tried to reproduce this issue, but I couldn't.\nI don't know whether it will resolve, but could you please test by adding the following code to the gtk-3.0/gtk.css? It's okay in any line:\n.nautilus-window paned {\n  background: #FFFFFF; }\nIf it seems to be fixed, I'll commit this. ;)\nP.S. The light titlebar version is now available. Sorry for the delay.\n. I tried another way to reproduce the bug, but unfortunately I failed.\nHowever, I came up with another workaround.\nSo could you please test this again?\n. Thank you for the report!\n. I'm sorry for the late reply.\nThe color scheme which is too dark is hard to produce material texture and it is not easy on the eyes for many people, \uff29\uff2d\uff28\uff2f. Therefore it is difficult to officially provide a color scheme close to black.\nHowever I'd like to make the current dark theme somewhat darker.\n. I'm so sorry that the correspondence was very delayed.\nI don\u2019t know if you like it, but I darkened the dark theme somewhat with 8602f26151d8b25925ced4cb6d75048ae527aeb4.\nSo I'd like to close this.\nP.S. I also wrote how to change the accent (pink) color with 27205e37a8e8420583d4679f74a418a7903c8b30.\nPlease refer HACKING.md if you are interested in changing it.\n. Yeah, this was a duplicate. But thank you for the report. :)\n. Sorry but this has not been fixed yet, except for invisible checkbox/radio.\nUnfortunately, it seems to be difficult to change style only for Libreoffice without affecting other apps.\nI'd like to clarify the (duplicate) issues, so I opened a new issue as #122.\nSo I'd like to close this now, but thank you for your report. :). I can't see it in my environment. (tested gnome 3.20 on Xorg and gnome 3.22 on Wayland)\n\nWhat version are you using?\nDid you see the issue template?\n. Oops, I misunderstood your comment.\nIt should be realized by rounding the decoration.\ndecoration {\n  border-radius: 4px 4px 0 0;\n}. Thanks but, your script has not properly renamed files or directories.\nFor example, to properly install the Flat-Plat-light, we must rename gtk-light.css to gtk.css currently.\nI am not familiar with programming or packaging, so I don't know if the current method is good.\nI tried to challenge the Makefile, but I was shamefully frustrated. \ud83d\ude15\nI would be glad if someone suggests a better way or sends a PR.... I tried rewriting the script to properly install themes while referring to your script. (thanks again!) How is this?. > how you \"build\" the css out of scss.\nBasically it is as written in HACKING.\nAfter installing rubygems, move to Flat-Plat repo directory on terminal and run gem install bundle && bundle install. If you edit .scss files and run ./parse-sass.sh, it will automatically load the subdirectories and generate CSSs.\nBy the way, I don't think it would be better to exclude CSS out of repository. To reduce the burden on users, I think it is better to bundle them from the beginning. It will also save installation time. For example, default Adwaita also includes the generated CSS.. I think this is also a particular issue of Xfce, so I'd like to close this as a duplicate of #60.. There seem to be the invisible icons (image) in that text fields.\nThis is really an upstream bug, but I'll try to add a workaround.\n. @dayfuaim \nThanks for your report.\nThe fields also seems to have invisible icons on the left and right. :confused:. > first of all I want to say is that this is a very nice theme!\nThanks. :)\n\nHow can I change the color of the location bar?\n\nIf you are customizing with Sass, just change the value of $titlebar_indicator_color in _colors.scss.\nIf you are editing CSS directly, move around line 847 and replace the two currentColor with your color.\ncss\n  .titlebar:not(headerbar) button:not(.suggested-action):not(.destructive-action),\n  headerbar button:not(.suggested-action):not(.destructive-action) {\n    border-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at center calc(100% - 1px), #AABBCC 0%, transparent 0%) 0 0 0/0 0 0px; }\n    .titlebar:not(headerbar) button:not(.suggested-action):not(.destructive-action):checked,\n    headerbar button:not(.suggested-action):not(.destructive-action):checked {\n      border-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at center calc(100% - 1px), #AABBCC 100%, transparent 0%) 0 0 2/0 0 2px; }\n\nAnd I have no transparency in this theme. Is there a possibilty to create some transparency?\n\nSorry but I have no idea what are you talking about.\nDo you mean that you want to make the headerbar translucent? If so, I don't know how to change it and I have no plan to make it translucent. Please refer to other themes.\n. Oops.\nIn v3.22.20161109, it was actually $topbar_indicator_color, not $titlebar_indicator_color.\nSorry.. I am not sure because it is not concrete...\nBut I think it's probably difficult because adding *:backdrop { opacity: 0.9; } does not work well.. Um, since there is no response, I close this.. Solus and Ubuntu Budgie officially support Adapta forked from this theme and ignore this original theme. It sounds to me like that those devs say it\u2019s not necessary to support Budgie in this theme. That's all.\nThose devs are trying to make Adapta the de facto standard. I know I have no talent as a developer (or a designer), but their attitude disappointed me. So (honestly I was worried quite a bit, but) I decided to drop supporting Budgie with this theme.. P.S. Adapta is better. So you don't need to do anything. Thank you.. OK, first apologize for some misunderstanding.\nBecause I am not good at English, the phrase \"de facto standard\" was not an appropriate expression. I thought that nuance will transmit, but that was my mistake.\nPreviously \"Ubuntu Budgie\" was a confusing name \"Budgie Remix\" on the GitHub, so I misunderstood that the Budgie team is clearly involved it. e.g. this site seems to introduce that Budgie Remix is created by the amazing team of developers from the Solus Project.\nThe \"healthy choice\" is established on healthy fairness. But the \"Budgie Remix\" team abandoned it. And they robbed my motivation and energy to keep supporting Budgie. (It was my misunderstanding but) I understood that the Budgie team officially backed up the Adapta; just a fork. That is why I discontinued support Budgie on the theme.\nI apologize for criticizing Solus/Budgie from my misunderstanding. And I updated the release page.\n\nP.S. Please forgive my poor English. I couldn't express a tenth of what I want to say because I don't have English proficiency.. @fossfreedom I'm sorry for the very late reply. To be honest, I am not good at English, so I did not have the energy to write an objection in English. And it doesn't matter if you ignore this reply. Please think that this is like a soliloquy thing. Additionally, please forgive my poor English.\n\nI think you don't seem to understand why I boycotted Ubuntu Budgie. I don't mean that I want Ubuntu Budgie to cover Flat-Plat.\nI just want to say,\nWhy did you describe Adapta as \"material design theme\"? Are you kidding me???\nI assert as the author of Flat-Plat, Adapta is obviously strongly influenced from Flat-Plat's code, design and ideas. So I think that recommending such a theme as the only \"material design theme\" is equivalent to saying like; Adapta is the only \"material design theme\" can be used regularly, and Flat-Plat is inferior theme worthless to try.\nEg, if you chose and expressed Paper as \"material design theme\", I would not feel anything uncomfortable. Because Flat-Plat and Paper have no particular relationship. But I cannot accept explaining Adapta, a fork, as the ONLY \"material design theme\".\nIf you treated Flat-Plat as inferior as an individual, I would not do anything. But if you do it as Ubuntu Budgie, I cannot help boycotting Ubuntu Budgie.\nMaybe you didn't intend to disparage Flat-Plat. But it was a shame that an influential team like Ubuntu Budgie did something like that without consideration.\n. @fossfreedom At least, until this commit it seems to have been introduced as \"Material Design\", not \"Material Design (Adapta)\". And it was before that that I decided to boycott.\n\nThe quote is from the author himself. I cannot and will not adjudicate in anyway which theme is material or not.\n\nSo why did not you call it  \"Adapta\" or \"adapta-gtk-theme\"? Despite being officially recommended as \"Material Design\", is there anyone install Flat-Plat instead? That way of calling was not fair, I think. Therefore, supporting Budgie's theme became no longer make sense to me. It doesn't matter whether there is a PPA, imo.\nAnyway, I didn't like being misunderstood, so I just wrote the objection. It's not because I'd like to make a detailed discussion. But thank you for inviting me.\n. @TechnoSparks Firstly, I apologise for the delay in replying to you. And I appreciate your polite and kind reply.\nLet me tell you the result first, I would like to support Budgie again in response to your request.\nOriginally, half of the reason why I stopped supporting Budgie was from my misunderstanding. And what you are saying makes sense.\nTo be honest, I suspected that Budgie's Flat-Plat users would be close to zero, and (not only Budgie but) it is hard to maintain many DEs, so I was hesitating to support it again.\nBy the way, one thing I would like to say to avoid misunderstandings is that \"Creating a barrier\" is by them, not by me. Boycotting Ubuntu Budgie by me was just a result. It is a response to unfair and not-free practices.\nFinally, sorry for the rambling sentence and my terrible English.\nKind regards.. @TechnoSparks \nI appreciate your thoughtfulness.\n\nI also may try to contribute in the future given enough knowledge of SCSS.\n\nOf course the contribution of the code will be helpful, but I also would be happy even if you just try to fix documents written in my poor English. (e.g. README.md) \ud83d\ude04 \nAnyway, Thank you for your understanding and the suggestion!. Sorry for the fix to be late.\nIt took time to identify the cause.\nThank you for the report!. More information is needed to solve this issue. Could you attach error messages or log?\nOr is there gnome-shell-theme.gresource file in /usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat/gnome-shell directory?. @sebastianlacuesta \nIf every pink part (accent color) are made to have the similar color as primary color, it will be indistinguishable the appearance when the background is selected.\n\nOf course it is possible to change the color of foreground widgets only when the background is selected, but I want to keep consistency and simplicity of the appearance, so colors are classified. Anyway, thanks. :). @bil-elmoussaoui Thanks for replying instead of me. :)\nIf just to replace the colors of the png assets, Gimp or something else are no needed. (but Inkscape needs to be installed. see for details: render-assets.sh)\nSteps:\n\n\nOpen src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg and src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/assets.svg with a text editor and move to line 31 and line 76.\n\n\nReplace those stop-color values (#FF4081) with any color.\n\n\nDelete all png assets. (Or it may be good only for specific pink assets.)\n\n\nrm -v Flat-Plat/src/{gtk-2.0,gtk-3.0/gtk-common}/assets/*.png\n\nRender assets with ./render-assets.sh.\n\ncd Flat-Plat/src/gtk-2.0 && ./render-assets.sh\n  cd Flat-Plat/src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common && ./render-assets.sh\n\nThese svg images need to replace colors of fill individually.\n- toggle-on.svg\n- more-results.svg\n- checkbox.svg\nAnd yeah, of course I would like to see your implementation if possible. :D. Sorry for the delay in my response. Thanks for your report!. My apologies for the late reply...\nPreviously I confirmed this issue, but now it seems to be almost solved in the upstream current version.\nI think that it would be better to visually have a gap between the panel and the popup, so I won't make changes this time. Sorry.\nAnyway, thanks for the report!. Today, version identification is need only for gnome-shell, so I think it's not necessary to do this. Also, the next minor version of gnome-shell is 3.24, but gtk3 won't bump from 3.22. So in my opinion, we cannot use libgtk-3  for this.\nSee: https://blog.gtk.org/2016/09/01/versioning-and-long-term-stability-promise-in-gtk/\n\n3.22 will be the last minor release of the 3.x series,\n\nTherefore I close this, but thanks for your contribution. :D. Aha, looks good. :)\nI'll implement that code. Thank you!. Hi, thank you for your bug reporting \ud83d\ude03\nI expect you did something like this article, but I had not tried it, so I didn't notice this bug. \ud83d\ude05 \nI applied a patch, but I currently don't have Ubuntu 16.04. So could you please check if the problem is resolved?\nYou can try latest one like this:\ncd /tmp\ncurl -sL https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xz\ncd Flat-Plat-master && sudo ./install.sh. @alexive Thanks for your report. \ud83d\ude03 \nIt seems to be fixed, so I close this issue.. That's OK. ;)\nIt just change v20161227 to master as with this page.\nsh\ncd /tmp\ncurl -sL https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xz\ncd Flat-Plat-master && sudo ./install.sh\n. It is also OK to download and unzip the archive then run sudo ./install.sh.\n. > Would it be doable to fork a theme and make all the elements compact?\nYes, of course. As written here, this theme is licensed under the GPL, so you can fork it freely.\n\nAm I missing the point around the big UI elements?\n\nI'm not an expert of UI design, but what I can say are:\n\n\nAs pointed out by Fitts's law, the bigger elements are easier to click than the small elements.\n\n\nAlso, in material design or flat design, too small spaces often make it look poor.\n\n\n\nBy the way, the big margins of the menu separators in that screenshot is a bug of gnome-shell. Ideally the spaces should be close to the menu of GTK3 theme, but unfortunately it has not been achieved due to the bug.\nP.S. The theme of your screenshot doesn't look like -compact version. Have you tried Flat-Plat-compact or Flat-Plat-light-compact yet?. Thank you for your clear report. \ud83d\ude03\nI'll tackle on this issue sometime soon.... Looks good. \ud83d\ude03 \nMany thanks!. I could not reproduce it. Please try to uninstall the theme then install it again.. Thanks for your report.\nI confirmed this issue by installing from the Copr repository.\n But I'm not its maintainer. So @LaurentTreguier, could you fix this bug?. @LaurentTreguier Thanks for your support!. Hi,\nUnfortunately, we cannot use the GDM theme to LightDM. It's technically impossible.\nBut if you are using GTK+ 3.20 or higher, LightDM should look like the screenshot below.\n\n\nI tried applying the theme to the lightdm-gtk-greeter, but it only colored the login box.\n\nI suppose you're using GTK+ 3.18.x. Because Flat-Plat for GTK+ 3.18 does not properly support LightDM theme for now. However, if you have a request, I would like to support it for GTK+ 3.18. :). Since there's no response, I'd like to close this.. In order to change the icons on the lock screen, just change the icon theme. However, note that the icon theme is necessary to be located under /usr/share/icons/.\nChanging the background image requires somewhat complicated work. After changed the background image, you need to generate a binary file with glib-compile-resources and replace it. The following is the simplest method:\n\n\nDownload the source files.\n\n\nGo src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets/ or src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets-dark/ and replace the noise-texture.svg with your asset.\n\n\nReplace the noise-texture.svg string in the gnome-shell*.css and gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml, according to your asset name.\n\n\nRun sudo ./install.sh from the Flat-Plat/ directory on the terminal.\n\n\nReinstall the re-generated gnome-shell-theme.gresource according to the README.md.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: As written in the README.md, this work might be dangerous, so please do it carefully and at your own risk. ;). This ArchWiki may also help you.. Since there's no response, I'd like to close this.. Are you talking about the icon on the top right? Or not?\n\n. Hmm, then it should work with putting the icon theme into /usr/share/icons. If it's still not work, the following reasons are conceivable.\n\nThe directory structure of the icon theme is incorrect.\nThe permission of the icon theme is incorrect.\nYou have been putting the icon theme with the same name into ~/.icons, ~/.local/icons or ~/.local/share/icons.\netc.. In any case, it's not a problem of this theme.\n\nSo even if you can't change the icons, I will not be able to help you anymore, sorry. Because I'm not an expert of this. So please question it elsewhere.\nI'd like to close this issue.. I confirmed this on Ubuntu GNOME with Wayland, but it seems not to be a theme-related bug.\nDid you carefully check the contents of ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md? This bug also occurs with the default Adwaita.\nHowever, since this did not occur on Fedora 25 and Arch Linux, I suppose it is a Ubuntu specific bug. Therefore it is better to report this bug in Ubuntu's issue tracker.. It seems that this bug has already been reported here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/+bug/1650395. Yes, this was intentional. Because I felt that 2px trough (and 12px slider) is too thin/small compared to other widgets (e.g. 36px buttons). For non-compact variants, the switch is also getting bigger for the same reason.\nThis is one of the reasons that I call this theme is a Material Design-like theme.\nHowever, this design decision is not permanent. Perhaps it may require more feedback or discussion.. Here's quick way:\n\n\nOpen /usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat<-variant>/gtk-3.22/gtk.css with a text editor.\n\n\nGo to line 2484 and edit to margin: -11px;.\n\n\ncss\n  scale slider {\n    min-height: 24px;\n    min-width: 24px;\n    margin: -11px;\n  }\n\nGo to line 2516 and edit to background-size: calc(100% - 12px);.\n\ncss\n  scale slider {\n    transition: all 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: center;\n    background-size: calc(100% - 12px);\n  }\n\nGo to line 2528 and edit to background-size: calc(100% - 10px);.\n\ncss\n  scale slider:hover {\n    background-size: calc(100% - 10px);\n  }\n\nGo to line 2532 and edit to background-size: calc(100% - 6px);.\n\ncss\n  scale slider:active {\n    background-size: calc(100% - 6px);\n  }\n\nReload the theme! ;)\n. Okay, if you know how to handle Sass, you can do the following:\n\nAround 2166 lines of _common.scss:\ncss\n  $slider_margin: -($slider_size - 2px) / 2;\n  $marks_slider_margin: -($marks_slider_size - 2px) - $slider_margin;\nAround 2224 lines:\n```css\n    background-size: calc(100% - 12px);\n&:hover { background-size: calc(100% - 10px); }\n\n&:active { background-size: calc(100% - 6px); }\n\n```\nAnd on line 2291 and below also like this:\n```css\n          background-position: center calc(100% - 6px);\n\n          &:hover { background-position: center calc(100% - 5px); }\n\n          &:active { background-position: center calc(100% - 3px); }\n\n```. Okay, I will. \ud83d\ude03 . After reconsidering, I changed the size of slider troughs to 2px.\nJust for your information, thanks. :). I'm going to give the top bar transparency when the upstream gnome-shell resolves this bug.\nSee also: https://material.io/guidelines/layout/structure.html#structure-system-bars\n\nBy default, the color of the status or window bar is a darker shade of the app bar color.\n\nAs in material design guidelines, I want to use a darker shade of the title bar color to the top bar, so I'm not using a translucent color for now (except light variants).\nHowever, since the light variant has both light and dark title bars, I'm using a neutral translucent black instead of an opaque color to the top bar.. You can also use the Dynamic Panel Transparency until the upstream bug is resolved.. I made the top bar translucent (when the window is not maximized) for gnome-shell 3.26.\nSo I'd like to close this issue.. Thank you for the report.\nPerhaps you updated or installed the theme before updating gnome to 3.24, so your gnome-shell theme of Flat-Plat is still for 3.22. So please try to re-install the theme. \ud83d\ude03 . Thank you for your report.\nI confirmed this issue. :). Thank you for your report. \ud83d\ude04 \nI confirmed this issue.\nI will fix it when my current work finishes. \ud83d\ude03 . That makes sense! Many thanks!. Thank you for your report. Certainly we should consider the development versions of GNOME. :)\n\nwhich btw it works fine, apart that commit that breaks opacity a bit\n\nExactly. I'm also going to work on that someday, as I mentioned in #114. :D. @Skehmatics Frankly speaking, I'm not sure, but it's probably not enough... (Sorry but I'm very amateur about shell script. :P). Fixed.\nPlease let me know if any problems remain. I'd reopen this.. Thank you for the clear report.\nThis problem is because Pinta and Atom are GTK2 based apps.\nTerminal is a GTK3 app, so it can be changed the colors via SCSS/CSS. However, in order to change the colors of the GTK2 apps, you need to edit inside src/gtk-2.0/ directory.\nFor example, to change the GTK2 menu bar color, simply open src/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change the #455A64 string. \ud83d\ude03 . @TechnoSparks It\u2019s all right :). @nioncode Hmm, that's strange. Could you tell me the following?\n\nWhat is the version of Firefox?\n(If you know) what is the version of Materia?\nHow did you get Materia?\nHave you customized Materia by yourself?\nWhat is your distro and version?. Thanks!\n\nI couldn't reproduce it on Fedora 27, Firefox v58.0.2 and latest Materia.\nI don't know any details about the nix packaging system or NixOS, but there is a possibility that it's due to a wrong file permission. Please check: #182. @nioncode Now I've fixed it for Firefox. :)\n\n(This problem still remains in Epiphany, etc.). Since I got many dissatisfied opinions from users about Pink accent color, I changed it to Teal.\n\nWould you mind providing different color schemes upstream\n\nI'm not considering it for now because it is hard to maintain many variants. I hope that getting used to the color will change your mind, but anyway, please, post your opinion to #220 for future decision making. :). You can change the accent color by the following procedure. Also please refer to HACKING.md for details.\n\n\nClone or download source files.\n\n\nOpen src/gtk-3.0/3.22/sass/_colors.scss and src/gnome-shell/3.18/sass/_colors.scss then change the $pink_A200 string to your favorite color.\n\n\nRun ./parse-sass.sh on the repo directory.\n\n\nChange the assets color with reference to HACKING.md#how-to-change-the-assets-color.\n\n\nFinally, run sudo ./install.sh.. You can also use Flat-Plat-Blue which is the forked theme, btw. :). No response, so I'd like to close this.. Thank you for the notice.\n\n\nI'll update README soon.. I'm sorry for the late reply.\nPreviously Flat-Plat supported 3.14 and 3.16 but now dropped because keep supporting many versions is so hard.\nGTK+ 3.14 has been released three years ago and has many different specifications from the current stable version 3.22. Therefore it is not easy to support 3.14 again, and honestly I do not want to devote much effort there. Sorry.\nHowever, the last version for 3.14 is available. Here:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/releases/download/v3.14.20160921/Flat-Plat-3.14.20160921.tar.gz. I'm sorry for the late reply.\nUnfortunately, I also couldn't reproduce this on Fedora 26 with GNOME Shell 3.24.3. :-(\nUntil gnome-shell 3.24, the upstream theme also included -gradient-start and-gradient-end properties, so the warning message sounds odd...\nSee: https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell/blob/gnome-3-24/data/theme/gnome-shell.css#L1134. In any case, third-party gnome-shell themes must always overwrite the upstream Adwaita theme. This means, even if we remove the properties in Flat-Plat, it is meaningless because the upstream includes them.\nThis issue might be better to report to the upstream gnome-shell.. Thanks. Before deciding, I would like to talk a bit with oomox author.. @actionless \nHi, I'm sorry for starting to talk late. I was late for urgent business.\nAnd thank you for your introduction! That is such a wonderful idea. \ud83d\ude03\nBy the way, I have a question I'd like to ask you. You mentioned that bitmap images should be replaced to SVG. However, can we not use ./render-assets.sh (and inkscape) without doing that?\nIn Flat-Plat, like the upstream Adwaita, PNG assets are generated from the source SVG by using ./render-assets.sh script. (For detailed generation method, please refer to here of point 3 and 4.)\nNot only that, in this theme, those SVG codes are organized and use linearGradient as color variables. See:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/blob/5deebe69f1255dbac804f6e975c8925065d60b86/src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg#L9-L59\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/blob/5deebe69f1255dbac804f6e975c8925065d60b86/src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg#L9-L59\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/blob/5deebe69f1255dbac804f6e975c8925065d60b86/src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/assets.svg#L13-L75\nSo in this case, I think it is easier to choose this way than replacing them with hundreds of SVG, for you and me. What do you think? Am I missing something?\nWarm Regards,. @actionless \nI'm glad to hear that. :)\nSo, if oomox will support Flat-Plat, what else should I do?\n(p.s. I'm sorry for the late reply again...). @actionless \nOkay, but I'm not very familiar with bash script and/or oomox, and currently I don't have much time to tackle ./change-color.sh. So I won't be able to provide something like ./change-color.sh in the near future, sorry.. @actionless \nThanks, that would be great! The basic things about how to hack the theme is written in HACKING.md, so please also refer to that.\nHere is the overall flow to change the theme colors:\n\nEdit the following files that defined theme colors\n./src/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n./src/gtk-2.0/gtkrc-dark (for Flat-Plat-dark, but maybe no need this for oomox?)\n./src/gtk-2.0/gtkrc-light (for Flat-Plat-light, and same as above)\n./src/gtk-3.0/3.22/sass/_colors.scss\n\n./src/gnome-shell/3.18/sass/_colors.scss\n\n\nRun ./parse-sass.sh to regenerate CSS of GTK3 and GNOME Shell\n\n\nEdit the following SVG linearGradient parts\n\n./src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg\n./src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg (for Flat-Plat-dark, and also no need this for oomox?)\n\n./src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/assets.svg\n\n\nDelete existing png assets then run ./render-assets.sh (and ./render-assets-dark.sh) to generate PNG assets\n  ```sh\n  rm ./src/gtk-2.0/assets/.png\n  rm ./src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark/.png\n  rm ./src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/assets/*.png\n\n\n# for GTK2\n  cd ./src/gtk-2.0\n  ./render-assets.sh\n  ./render-assets-dark.sh\n# for GTK3\n  cd ../gtk-3.0/gtk-common\n  ./render-assets.sh\n  ```\n\n\nEdit svg fill of gnome-shell and unity\n\n\nFinally, run sudo ./install.sh\n\n\nOther notes\n\nYou do not need to edit svg of metacity-1 to change the colors. Those colors are controlled with xml.\nassets in ./src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/assets/scalable are also no need to edit.\nxfwm4 exists, but Xfce is not yet fully supported...\nchrome extensions are also able to change the colors, but I don't know how to create .crx files with CUI...\n\nAnd I hope this will help !!. @actionless \nWell, I thought you would fork this repo and use it as submodule like oomox-gtk-theme...\nI am wondering if the implementation will break this current vanilla theme. How do you think?. @actionless \nI understand. If you do it without changing the sources, your PRs will be much appreciated!\nThanks in advance. :). I mentioned about oomox in README with 5555152c40787739b00ef364a11185d549c3b5bb. Thanks guys. I'd like to close this issue. :). No need any special settings for Dash to Dock. Just install the theme is okay.\nWe just added specific styling for Dash to Dock to suit this theme. That includes:\n- Space adjustments\n- Indicators for fitting this theme\n- Recolorable background color between desktop and overview\n- Other minor styling for Dash to Dock's abilities\nAnd this screenshot shows how Dash to Dock appears in Flat-Plat. Do you think this is still not enough?. Thanks!. Great. Thanks!. render-assets.sh scripts just picked up from the upstream Adwaita. And I did not change anything. see:\n- https://github.com/GNOME/gtk/blob/master/gtk/theme/Adwaita/render-assets.sh\n- https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-themes-standard/blob/master/themes/Adwaita/gtk-2.0/render-assets.sh. indeed. So let's enable optipng for gtk3.. THANK YOU!. @actionless \nI'm sorry for the late reply... And thank you for your hard work! So fantastic! It looks VERY good more than I expected. I'm going to write about oomox on the README later. :)\nbtw, I noticed a small issue with oomox.\n| vanilla Flat-Plat | Flat-Plat with Numix color scheme |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\nAs the material design guideline recommends, Flat-Plat has two accent colors, primary color and secondary color.\nHowever, since oomox currently uses them as one color, checkbox, swith, slider, etc are almost invisible when the background is selected. So I propose to make both primary color and secondary color configurable. But if it is difficult for some reasons please do not hesitate to discard this proposal. \ud83d\ude03 . @actionless \noops. I'm sorry for my mistake! I didn't check it properly. :/\n\nbtw feel free to submit some colorschemes to oomox/colors\n\nThanks! I'd like to send you a PR If I have some time and find nice color schemes. :). All merged. You're awesome. Many thanks!. Guys, thanks for your feedback! (and sorry for my late response.)\nI think that the new name would be better to have a (preferably) simple name with a single word. :). @OriginalFannibal \nExactly! I was also thinking to express \"Material\" in Latin. (e.g. Materia, Materialis, Materiae)\nHowever, this issue is that the naming is quite simple, so the name will overlap with other projects:\n- https://github.com/search?q=materia&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93\n- https://github.com/search?q=materialis&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93\n- https://github.com/search?q=materiae&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93. @OriginalFannibal Thank you for your opinion! Surely you are right. Your opinion was very helpful. :). So, as @OriginalFannibal suggests, I currently regard Materia is the most suitable name for this Material Design theme as a new name.\nHowever, if you have other opinions, I'd love to hear that.\nIf there are no other suggestions, I'd like to change the theme name to Materia (and the repository name to materia-theme) in a few weeks. :). @coler706 \nThank you for your opinion. It's nice to have a simple and unique name.\nAlthough I'm always trying to write the code as simple as possible, I think this theme is not necessarily simple because it is based on Material Design guidlines.... I would like to adopt a more natural and appropriate name for many people. I'm not good at English. Therefore I opened this issue and seeking opinions from people. :)\nThe reason why I currently think Materia is most suitable name is because it can be understand at a glance that it is the Material Design theme.. @USBA \nThird-party gnome-shell themes must always overwrite the default (Adwaita) theme style. Otherwise the default theme style will be reflected in your theme. And your theme seems not to follow the changes of gnome-shell 3.26.\nYou can find the gnome-shell changes from here:\nhttps://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell/commits/master/data/theme\nFor sass: https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell-sass/commits/master\nPanel text/icon shadows ware added with this commit: https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell/commit/447bf55e45b00426ed908b1b1035f472c2466956\nSo, to remove the shadows, you need to add text-shadow: none; and icon-shadow: none; like this commit of Flat-Plat: https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/commit/ecdf6bb68c3323b32db8e6e1943f0d7aa36ec8b0\nGood luck. And thanks for suggesting of names. :). Hi everyone,\nAs planned I now changed the theme name to Materia.\nYour opinions were very helpful. I would like to THANK everyone who gave me advice and suggestions. \ud83d\ude04 \nI close this now.. @actionless Thanks!. Sorry for the delay in dealing.. It has now been fixed now.\nThanks for your reports. \ud83d\udc4d . LGTM. Thanks!. Looks really good! Thank you very much!. > Is it feasible?\nYap. But to be honest, I'm not an active user of KDE. Also I have many tasks (these and others) to do. Therefore, even if we support KDE, it may be quite later. :). Yes, Adapta should be based on Materia (ex-Flat-Plat). I might refer to it when supporting KDE.. @Warmuser \nI appreciate you are trying to help to this project. :)\nAs you say, it is quite difficult to find theme guides unfortunately. In my experience, I think the best guide is the upstream code of the theme. Its commit history and comments would also be helpful.\nFor GNOME/GTK+, I linked the upstream Adwaita code to HACKING.md#upstream-theme-sources.\nIn order to address each GTK3 app and gnome-shell extension, it is good to look for .css files on each repository. Please note that some are hard-coded and some are not.\nFor GTK3, gtk3-widget-factory, gtk3-demo and the GTK+ Inspector are also VERY useful.\nThis official document would also help you: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/theming.html\n\nIn the case of KDE, I found the good official documentation:\n- https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Plasma4/Theme\n- https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Plasma4/ThemeDetails\n- https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Plasma5/ThemeDetails. @varlesh Looks sooo good! Thank you :heart: \nAlso thank you @ArchangeGabriel for your suggestion. :). I've just mentioned PapirusDevelopmentTeam/materia-kde in the README.md with 614d27b588f5accfc193706c610772ef09b6a2a0.\n(Sorry for being late.)\nSince I don't have much time and it's beyond my capacity (I'm not a KDE user, btw), I will leave it to @PapirusDevelopmentTeam and would like to close this issue.\nThanks again @varlesh and @PapirusDevelopmentTeam :D. Thanks for the suggestion. but I personally like the dropdown arrows. Also, as far as I know, we cannot remove the arrows by the themes.. Aha, you are right.\nBut even if we can do that by the themes, honesty I do not like to remove it. I think it would be better for users to freely add or remove it with the extention. So I won't remove it. Sorry.. Have you seen the HACKING.md?\nFor Sass, used in gtk3 and gnome-shell, just edit the _colors.scss files.\nFor example, in order to apply base16 to the gtk3 theme, try replacing the code in src/gtk-3.0/3.22/sass/_colors.scss as follows (then run ./parse-sass.sh and sudo ./install.sh. Note that this is a quick hack and this color scheme is not tested very much):\n```scss// When color definition differs for dark and light variant,\n// it gets @if ed depending on $variant\n@import 'color-palette';\n$base00: #181818;\n$base01: #282828;\n$base02: #383838;\n$base03: #585858;\n$base04: #b8b8b8;\n$base05: #d8d8d8;\n$base06: #e8e8e8;\n$base07: #f8f8f8;\n$base08: #ab4642;\n$base09: #dc9656;\n$base0A: #f7ca88;\n$base0B: #a1b56c;\n$base0C: #86c1b9;\n$base0D: #7cafc2;\n$base0E: #ba8baf;\n$base0F: #a16946;\n@function gtkalpha($c, $a) {\n  @return unquote(\"alpha(#{$c}, #{$a})\");\n}\n// Foreground colors\n$dark_fg_color:   $base02;\n$light_fg_color:  $base05;\n$button_fg_color: if($variant == 'light', $base02, $base05); // extra fg color for raised buttons\n$fg_color:                    if($variant == 'light', $base02, $base05);\n$secondary_fg_color:          rgba($fg_color, 0.7);\n$hint_fg_color:               rgba($fg_color, 0.5);\n$disabled_fg_color:           rgba($fg_color, 0.5);\n$disabled_secondary_fg_color: rgba($fg_color, 0.3);\n$track_color:                 rgba($fg_color, 0.3);\n$divider_color:               rgba($fg_color, 0.12);\n$titlebar_fg_color:                    if($titlebar == 'light', $base02, $base05);\n$titlebar_secondary_fg_color:          rgba($titlebar_fg_color, 0.7);\n$titlebar_hint_fg_color:               rgba($titlebar_fg_color, 0.5);\n$titlebar_disabled_fg_color:           rgba($titlebar_fg_color, 0.5);\n$titlebar_disabled_secondary_fg_color: rgba($titlebar_fg_color, 0.3);\n$titlebar_track_color:                 rgba($titlebar_fg_color, 0.3);\n$titlebar_divider_color:               rgba($titlebar_fg_color, 0.12);\n$inverse_fg_color:                    $base05;\n$inverse_secondary_fg_color:          rgba($inverse_fg_color, 0.7);\n$inverse_hint_fg_color:               rgba($inverse_fg_color, 0.5);\n$inverse_disabled_fg_color:           rgba($inverse_fg_color, 0.5);\n$inverse_disabled_secondary_fg_color: rgba($inverse_fg_color, 0.3);\n$inverse_track_color:                 rgba($inverse_fg_color, 0.3);\n$inverse_divider_color:               rgba($inverse_fg_color, 0.12);\n// Background colors\n$bg_color:         if($variant == 'light', $base06, $base00);\n$base_color:       if($variant == 'light', $base07, $base01);\n$alt_base_color:   mix($base_color, $bg_color, 50%);\n$lighter_bg_color: $base_color;\n$darker_bg_color:  $bg_color;\n$titlebar_bg_color:     if($titlebar == 'dark', $base01, $base05);\n$alt_titlebar_bg_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', $base01, $base05);\n$panel_bg_color:        if($titlebar == 'dark', $base00, rgba($black, $middle_opacity));\n$unity_panel_bg_color:  if($titlebar == 'dark', $base00, $base04); // translucent colors cannot be used for Unity and MATE panels\n$alt_panel_bg_color:    rgba($black, $lower_opacity);\n$fill_color:      gtkalpha(currentColor, $lower_opacity);\n$semi_fill_color: gtkalpha(currentColor, $lower_opacity / 2);\n$row_fill_color:  gtkalpha(currentColor, 0.05);\n// Misc colors\n$primary_color:         $base02;\n$alt_primary_color:     $base03;\n$accent_color:          $base08;\n$disabled_accent_color: rgba($accent_color, 0.5);\n$link_color:         $base0D;\n$visited_link_color: $base0E;\n$warning_color: $base09;\n$error_color:   $base08;\n$success_color: $base0B;\n$suggested_color:   $accent_color;\n$destructive_color: $base08;\n$info_bg_color:     $base0E;\n$question_bg_color: $base0D;\n$warning_bg_color:  $base09;\n$error_bg_color:    $base08;\n$border_color:             if($variant == 'light', rgba($black, 0.12), rgba($black, 0.3));\n$highlight_color:          if($variant == 'light', rgba($white, 0.4),  rgba($white, 0.1));\n$titlebar_highlight_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', rgba($white, 0.1),  rgba($white, 0.4));\n$unity_highlight_color:    if($titlebar == 'dark', rgba($white, 0.1),  rgba($white, 0.2));\n$alt_highlight_color:      rgba($white, 0.2); // for selection-mode headerbar which colored with primary color\n$titlebar_indicator_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', currentColor, $primary_color);\n// FIXME: gtk's @placeholder_text_color API really should use $secondary_fg_color,\n// but it doesn't work with translucent colors.

JFYI, there's already a fork of Flat-Plat based on base16:\nhttps://github.com/asmolero/Flat-Plat-base16. You can also refer to this comment to change the color scheme:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/issues/128#issuecomment-325116620. Oh, I completely misunderstood... Sorry. \ud83d\ude05 . Thank you for the report. But,\n\nActual behavior should resemble Adapta, where window buttons have a separate .svg for mouseover and pressed.\n\nAdapta is a fork of Flat-Plat, so that's obvious why it resemble.... Thanks for the additional info. Fixed.. Yeah, I disabled the transition because when -st-background-image-shadow property is animated, the button seems to distort. (I believe this is a bug of the upstream gnome-shell, rather than a bug of this theme.). Yes. The shadow still change without animation. See:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/blob/master/src/gnome-shell/3.26/gnome-shell.css#L1593-L1604. Thank you for the report.\nPreviously, I attempted to fix this bug, but it seemed not easy.\nI suppose this is due to something upstream GTK+ bug.\nIn any case, we need a workaround for this bug.. @actionless I'm thinking about a workaround close to that. But I have to do many testing for that. \ud83d\ude16. Thanks. :). I think these are bugs of each application. It should appear similarly in other dark themes.\nExample of gedit with Adwaita-dark:\n\nI don't think these bugs can be fixed by themes. These bugs should be reported to the bug tracker of each application, I guess.. Hmm, I don't know how about pgAdmin III, but for gedit (actually GtkSourceView) it may be possible to deal with this theme.. Yeah, I'm considering support GtkSourceView theme(s) like oblivion for gedit.. Thank you for the report. It's now fixed.. I can't reproduce this. And the theme shown in your screenshot doesn't look like a vanilla Flat-Plat-compact. Didn't you install the theme customized by yourself?. \nI think you deleted the assets/ directory or its *.png & scalable/*.svg files.\nPlease check if /usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat-compact/gtk-common/assets directory exists.. I'm glad it was solved anyway. :)\nClosing.. Thank you for your report.\nIndeed it looks quite buggy, but I'm not sure I can deal this issue with the theme.\nAnyway, I'll investigate whether this can be handled.. I would like to close this - since I think it's hard to address the bug with this theme, and even upstream Adwaita has this problem.\nIf this bug is still a problem for you, please report it to the upstream Veracrypt.. Thanks!. I am considering a design that is quite different from the Paper cursor theme. It is planned to have a light background color and dark shadow without border (like Material Design).\nHowever, I don't have time to work on it for now and the design plan may be unsuccessful (for rendering).\nAnyway, thanks for opening the issue. :)\np.s.\n\nIf you think it is fine the way it is then maybe you could add it as a recommendation in the README.\n\nI personally like the Paper icon theme very much,\nbut I want to be fair, so I won't recommend third-party themes that are not directly related to this theme in the document. :). Seems base16-materia (and also base16-material) are not using the Material Design color palette for all colors.\nI'd like to use the color palette for all colors.\nAlso @actionless said it can address with oomox, so I'd like to wait and see that. (Sorry I didn't mention it to TODO.). @actionless Oh, sorry. I didn't know that. \ud83d\ude05 . @actionless Thanks for more info! I'll consider implementing it based on your information and oomox.. @lokesh-krishna Sorry I haven't decided the color scheme completely yet because I don't have sufficient knowledge of terminal color scheme. But I'm basically going to use A200, A400, A700 or 500 (in some cases 400 or 600?) from the Material Design color palette.. @DarthWound Thank a lot for your great work and guide! It looks really nice and helpful!\nI will definitely refer to your work when I start implementing terminal color scheme. :). Thanks for the report.\nI think the drop-shadow issue is due to the bug of the upstream gtk+.\nIn any case this cannot be fixed by this theme.\nTherefore I'd like to close the issue, sorry.\np.s.\nPantheon (elementary OS) and its apps are not officially supported yet, so please see the progress with #69.. The window corners already have 2px border-radius.\n2px is the recommended radius for many components in the Material Design guidelines, so I don't want to change it.\nSorry but I won't fix it.. Hey @gregor160300 & @actionless, thanks for your suggestions. :)\nI had already noticed the roundness change in the guidelines and tried adapting it to Materia. However, frankly speaking I'm quite hesitating about it because the 4px roundness may look too pop/soft:\n\n(I made a test branch so you can easily try it:)\ncd /tmp && wget -qO - https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/archive/4px-roundness.tar.gz | tar xz\ncd materia-theme-4px-roundness\n./install.sh -d ~/.themes -n Materia-4px-roundness -c standard -s standard\nWhat do you think? I'm currently thinking I want to wait and see for now while watching the trends of other Material Design products (like material-components-web and demos). :wink: . > it seems what for \"main\" windows it stay with square corners\nI forgot about it. Thanks!\nHowever, personally I'd much prefer the rounded top corners for main windows. To me the square corners (with headerbar) looks out of place. Even on Android P, windows are rounded in the overview, so I would like to keep the rounded corners for main windows. :). Now, converting the corner radius to 4px is almost done.\nI'm closing this. Thanks for your feedback!\n\npersonally I feel like 8px would be more in line with the new design Google uses\n\nAt least the guidelines do not recommend 8px corner radius to cards by default, so I will pass on that this time. :). I'm sorry but I don't want to increase theme variants any more.\nI think a pure black version will not go well. Because Materia uses black shadows as borders for many widgets (e.g. button, entry, etc.), if the theme has pure black backgrounds it wolud be hard to see the boundaries. That's not good for UI/UX.\nExactly there is a great tool oomox that can change the color scheme. Please try to use oomox, or you can fork and change the color scheme directly.. LGTM. Thanks @AlexWayfer.\nAlso thank you @cthbleachbit and @LaurentTreguier for addressing the renaming. \ud83d\ude03 . I'm not a maintainer of the AUR package (its maintainer is @cthbleachbit) but, the package name flatplat-theme seems to be invalid because it was changed to materia-theme. A little while ago the package name was fixed with README. So then I'll remove sudo. Thanks for your info. :). @cthbleachbit No need to apologize. Thanks for your quick response. :). I'm sorry for the late reply.\nSorry but i'm not exactly sure what you are pointing at.\nAre you talking about the top panel of GNOME Shell?\nIf so, you can use this extension to control the transparency:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/885/dynamic-top-bar/\nIf you have CSS knowledge, you can also edit gnome-shell.css directly to change the color and transparency.. BTW, I don't intend to give transparency to the menu of gnome-shell. Because this is a Material Design theme, not a Mac-like theme. :). If you want to edit and change the CSS by yourself, I can advise if you indicate where and how you want to change specifically.\nIf not, would you close this issue?. I don't know yet where you want to change.\nPlease specify exactly where you want to change.\n(For example, \"I want to make the menu of gnome-shell translucent.\")\nIt would be better if you attach the screenshot(s) to make it clear.. No response for a long time... I close this now.. Sorry for the late reply. I understand. (It's a panel (or known as top bar), not menu, though...)\nYou can customize it by editing the source file as follows:\n1.

See HACKING.md for details.. Hi, sorry for the late reply.\nI had previously planned to make packages for various distributions (including debian) using Open Build Service, but for several reasons the plan has suffered a setback.\nI still don't have enough knowledge of packaging, so I would like to ask for your help if possible. \ud83d\ude03 . Hi, @isaagar \nI see you are kindly trying to tackle this issue with https://github.com/isaagar/materia-theme.\nIs there any news about this?\nIf there is anything I can cooperate for, please tell me.\nThanks.. @isaagar No need to be sorry! Thanks for your working. :). Thank you so much for your hard work!\nI tested it with Ubuntu 17.10 and it was successfully (un)installed!\n\n. @isaagar Thank you so much!!!\nLooks very fine. :). @isaagar Thanks a lot! \ud83c\udf89 I'm so happy and can't wait it be available \ud83d\ude03 \nBTW, what do you think about sending your isaagar/materia-theme to this repo as a PR?  I thought it would make it easier to maintain the package, isn't it?. @isaagar Thanks for your information. I'll try to provide DEB files in github release itself.\nSorry, but honestly I don't know what license information is missing. Yes, I licensed materia-theme with GPLv2+ only, and if my understanding is correct it should be fine. :/\n\nUPDATE:\nI got it. Maybe it is necessary to mention about these?\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/_sass/gnome-shell/_common-3.18.scss#L7-L10\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/_sass/gnome-shell/_common-3.24.scss#L7-L10\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/_sass/gnome-shell/_common-3.26.scss#L7-L10\nI might be wrong, but do we also need to mention ScionicSpectre and GNOME?\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/gtk-2.0/gtkrc#L1\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/gtk-2.0/gtkrc-dark#L1\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/gtk-2.0/gtkrc-light#L1\nThose mentioning are basically just copied from the upstream, though.\nhttps://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell-sass/blob/master/_common.scss#L9-L12\nhttps://github.com/GNOME/gnome-themes-extra/blob/master/themes/Adwaita/gtk-2.0/gtkrc#L1. @isaagar Thanks a lot!!. @isaagar Awesome! Thanks \ud83c\udf89. @isaagar Exactly! So I'll update the README. Thanks!. Yes, we should. I appreciate your cooperation to package in Debian. Thank you very much!. I can't reproduce this.\nIs this really a issue of the theme?\nDoes not occur even with the default Adwaita?. So, as written in the template;\n\nBefore reporting a bug, please check whether it also occurs with other themes.\n\nI suppose this is due to the extension(s) you installed.\nAnyway I close this issue.. Sorry for the late reply, but I couldn't reproduce it.\nThis may be a problem specific to your environment:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/872572/when-i-try-to-start-chrome-i-get-a-message-that-says-failed-to-load-extension-f\nCould you please test whether you can install other themes that are non-hosted on Chrome Web Store?\ne.g. arc-theme.crx: https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme/tree/master/extra/Chrome. @archqob So sorry for the late response. Now I've fixed it. Thanks for your report!. Hi, thank you for your report!\nI finally confirmed this issue with Firefox 59.0a1 (and with the current stable version it doesn't happen).\nI'll fix this. :). @nermolov I should have fixed this bug already. Do you still have this bug?. @nermolov Please. It should be fixed in the latest release (v20171112).. Sorry but I don't think this will go well. The design of transparent or slightly dark overlay top bar is not bad. However, with GNOME desktop, it has some problems.\nWe always need enough contrast, even if wallpaper is bright or complex.\nCompared with Android, the desktop screen is wide, so we'll easily lose sight of the panel buttons if the contrast is weak.\nAlso, I personally use Dash to Dock with panel mode enabled. If we change the top bar to transparent, it \nwould look bad when combined with extended Dash to Dock. This is another reason why I'm not positive about your proposal.\nHere is an example of the top bar which has slightly dark overlay with complex wallpaper and extended Dash to Dock:\n\n\ntransparent elements are something Material Design avoids.\n\nI don't think so. In Material Design guidelines, there are a lot of translucent elements. For example:\nhttps://material.io/guidelines/style/imagery.html\nhttps://material.io/guidelines/layout/structure.html#structure-system-bars\n\nI am not sure if the dark overlay in case of light wallpapers can be implemented\n\nAFAIK, gnome-shell doesn't have such a feature (for now). \ud83d\ude15 \n\nIt would be nice to see this change also reflected in the theming for Dash to Dock if it is something you can do.\n\nAFAIK, Ubuntu Dock (a fork of Dash to Dock) has dynamic transparency (as well as GNOME Shell 3.26), but the upstream Dash to Dock has not implemented it yet.\nBTW, I'm not trying to make Materia look like Android. Because things going well with the mobile interface will not always go well with the desktop interface.. OK! So, I'd like to close this issue. :). @n3oxmind Thank you! I appreciate your help!\n@isaagar Sorry but I'm not sure what do you mean. paper-gtk-theme also has duplicate _colors.scss in each Paper/gtk-3.* directory.... Thanks! I have not tested it, but this might be a problem only for Ubuntu 17.10 (or later).. Wow, I'm glad that Materia has been used as default theme of Condres OS.\nThanks for the announcement!. First of all, thank you for your good work! I confirmed both issues.\nHowever, I prefer $inverse_fg_color than $accent_color for the notification icon. So I decided to simply add fill=\"#FFFFFF\" to the svg and won't change the css. (see the above commit)\nTherefore I would like to close this, but thanks again for the PR. :). It would be great if Materia will support Flatpak, but I'm not sure how it works for now...\n~By the way, it also seems to work by just placing themes in ~./themes, even without providing the theme as an extension:~\nln -s /usr/share/themes/Materia* ~/.themes\n~I'm not sure which is a better solution, but the latter (placing themes in ~./themes) seems more flexible to me. \ud83d\ude09~\nEDIT: My bad... I had some misunderstanding. It doesn't seem to work.. @Raytar Sorry for the late reply. And thank you so much for your work! It looks very nice!!\nWell, may I submit those files to Flathub (based on the Submission Guidelines) after adding some minor changes? (e.g. correct metadata_license, see https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/181#discussion_r155929308)\n. @Raytar Thanks! I've submitted a pull request with https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/186. Cheers!.

I don't have permission to add the repos in flathub. So could you request those repos  in that thread?. Sorry but I'm not sure where you are talking about. What is \"dropdown box\"? Are you talking about the notification box of GNOME Shell? Can you provide a screenshot?. Merged. Thanks!. Hi, thank you for your report.\nCurrently Materia does not support Xfce, so I don't know the cause exactly. But I'll investigate this issue.. Hi,\nThis chrome theme has a common appearance in normal windows and incognito windows. It is intentional.. Could you please attach a screenshot?. Thanks for the screenshots. It seems you have not installed (or not enabled for some reason?) the Chrome theme.\nHere are my screenshots of Chromium 62.0.3202.89 with Materia-dark.\nWithout Chrome theme extension:\n\nWith Chrome theme extension:\n\nDid you certainly install the Chrome theme as described in this section?:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme#chrome-theme. OK, I guess you dragged and dropped both extensions (Materia-dark Theme.crx and Materia-dark Scrollbars.crx) at the same time. You need to drag and drop .crx one by one.\nBy the way, any Chrome theme extensions never appear in extension list. Instead you can uninstall the Chrome theme from chrome://settings. Well, have you resolved the Chrome theme problem?\nSure. It should work:\nsudo cp -v --backup {~/.themes/$GTK_THEME,/usr/share}/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource\nThis is equivalent to:\nsudo cp -v --backup ~/.themes/$GTK_THEME/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource. You can uninstall chrome theme from \"Use GTK+\" button. (sorry for non-English screenshot)\n\n. Neat. So I close this.. Oh, I didn't know this, but it's very useful. \ud83d\ude04 \nI've just updated the wiki page.\nThanks for teaching me this!. > which, in my taste and opinion, is not matching\nCompletely agree with you. But unfortunately, when using the Chrome theme extensions, those colors will be hard-coded and cannot be changed.\nI need to consider a way to improve the appearance without using the Chrome theme extension (for the dark variant).. Oops, I overlooked this. Sorry! (When I tried to see this page before, it was 404 not found...)\nBTW, I really appreciate your great work!!!\nFor details, I'll review later, but roughly speaking;\n\n\nI still need test.sh or similar functionality for the theme development. test.sh makes it possible to check the changes quickly by using symlink (ln -s) instead of copy (cp).\n\n\nparse-sass.sh and render-assets.sh scripts are also needed to contain the compiled css/png in the repository. I want to keep them in the repo to reduce the user's burden (for installation time and less dependency).\n\n\nassets and render-assets options seem to recolor only *.png assets, but not *.css and gtk-2.0/gtkrc*. Also, such function is already realized with change_color.sh. So I'm not sure those options are really necessary. (Or, it needs to support *.css and gtkrc (and also ideally other *.svg) to enhance the function.). In addition, I personally feel it is better to divide the recolor functions (around asset & render-assets) into the another script (e.g. named recolor). The reasons are current materia.sh code is a bit too long, and the recolor feature would work as optional.\n\n\nI assume that it will be like this:\nrecolor:\nbash\nxxx_assets_color() {\n...\n}\nrender_assets() {\n...\n}\n...\nmateria.sh:\nbash\nsource ./recolor\n~If we adopt this, it may be better to revert the name from materia.sh to install.sh.~\nUPD: Sorry, I'm not sure this yet.. Also I'd like to talk my thoughts about changing the color/opacity. Maybe they are quite hard to realize (especially No.3) but please forgive me to say this. :)\n\n\n./install.sh --primary #0000FF --accent #FF0000 --bg #EEEEEE should be better to change only the specified colors, shouldn't change the unspecified colors.\n\n\nBackground colors (including primary and accent) with transparency has some technical problems. (e.g. GTK2 (gtkrc) doesn't support transparency colors except for assets.) Therefore, I think opacity should not be controllable for the background colors.\n\n\nFor text and similar colors, the best way is that ./install.sh --fg #FF0000 will change color-fg and similar colors based on the Material Design color theory as follows:\n\n\n| color vars | new color | new opacity |\n  |-|-|-|\n  | color-fg | #FF0000 | 1 |\n  | color-fg-secondary | #FF0000 | 0.7 |\n  | color-fg-hint | #FF0000 | 0.5 |\n  | color-fg-disabled | #FF0000 | 0.5 |\n  | color-fg-secondary-disabled | #FF0000 | 0.3 |\n  | color-track | #FF0000 | 0.3 |\n  | color-divider | #FF0000 | 0.12 |\n(These opacities are same as the -dark values.). Hi, @n3oxmind \nFirst of all, thank you for your hard work! I'm happy to see your elaborate install script. \ud83d\ude03 \nHowever I have some basic questions:\n\n\nCurrently 228 files have been changed. Even .gitignore and HACKING.md have been deleted. Is it intentional? If not, could you revert the files that are no-needed to change?\n\n\nThis is a repetition/paraphrase of my previous comment; When installing vanilla Materia, IMHO it is better to just copy pre-compiled .css files without using sassc command in order to reduce installation time and dependency. What do you think about this? (FYI, Adwaita, Arc, etc. also have pre-compiled .css files in their own repository and do not request sassc, etc. on installation.). > but by using sassc you don't need all of the gtk-color-size.css,gtk-color-size.scss , gnome-shell-color-size.css and gnome-shell-color-size.scss the script will generate the proper files whenever needed.\n\n\nyeah, but I need all of the compiled gtk${color}${size}.css and gnome-shell${color}${size}.css for easier testing (theme development) by using ln -s. (Please check test.sh.)\n\nbring back all of the .css & .scss files will not break the script at all. I'll make the script do the following (if you want):\n\nSounds/looks great. Thanks!. Hello @n3oxmind,\nI really hate to say this because it might mess up your kind hard work so far, but...\nAfter reconsideration, I thought there are several (bigger) issues to be solved.\n\n\nThe materia.sh code is too complicated for me to maintain.\nActually, I'm not as familiar with shell script as you. Also for people who fork this theme, I think the installation script should be as simple as possible. (To be honest, I was trying to make a simplified version of install.sh before this PR. Please see the link below.)\nThe best solution I think is to separate the recolor feature from the installation script (like install.sh and change_color.sh). This would also be helpful if we migrate to make or meson in the future.\n\n\nThe following files are still necessary for quick testing using ./test.sh.\n\nparse-sass.sh (This is also necessary to contain the pre-compiled CSSs in the repo.)\nrender-assets.sh (Although these render-assets scripts can/should be simplified...)\nsrc/gtk-2.0/render-asset.sh\nsrc/gtk-2.0/render-assets-dark.sh\nsrc/gtk-2.0/render-assets.sh\nsrc/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/render-asset.sh\nsrc/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/render-assets.sh\n\n\nsrc/index*.theme (Using sed looks interesting, but it breaks my workflow using symlinks.)\n\nCurrent materia.sh recolor feature needs to specify colors separately for assets (svg/png) and others (scss/css/gtkrc).\nIMO it would be better for users to be able to specify colors at the same time like ./change_color.sh.\nAlso, ./materia.sh assets can preview the color strings before generating the assets, but I wonder a bit if the feature is really necessary... Because users can use the (GUI) oomox instead of the (CUI) script.\n\n\nThere are many conflicting files. (This is not big issue than the above, though.)\n\n\n\nBased on these issues, I propose the following plan.\n\nClose this PR for now (because big changes are needed to solve the above issues).\nMerge the simplified version of install.sh I made into master branch.\nThis is based on test.sh and your work. :)\nThis is still incomplete and needs some bug fixes. (Please see the commit massage for details.)\nIn the meantime, I may improve the directory structure (#170) and update the script accordingly.\nIf you still could help us, please improve/fix the (updated) scripts!!\nFor installation scripts, please do not include the recolor functions (if you could agree with my opinion).\nFor the recolor feature, you can simply improve change_color.sh or create a new script.\nWhen sending PRs, I suggest that you create a branch (not master) from the next time, btw. :)\n\n\nWhat do you think about these issues/plan?\nPlease do not hesitate to tell me your opinions (and/or objections).\nOf course, opinions from other than @n3oxmind are also very welcomed.. I can't reproduce it.\n- Aren't you using customized Materia by yourself?\n- What is the distribution you are using?\n- Can you attach a screenshot?. Thanks. Then please let me know the following too:\n\nWhether librsvg is installed:\nsudo apt-get install librsvg2-2 librsvg2-common\nWhether these .png and .svg files exist in your\n  /usr/share/themes/Materia/gtk-common/assets/scalable directory\n\nI think it is the cause that either one is missing.. Aha, permission error? I got it. Anyway it was good to solve this. :). @nioncode \n\nAre you maybe accessing resources from that location instead of the installed one?\n\nNo, I'm not. (i think)\nadapta, arc, numix use PNG assets that hard-code colors, but Materia uses recolorable SVG assets as Adwaita does. Could you please check if this problem occurs in Adwaita as well?\nAlso, please, run ll /nix/store/*-materia-theme-*/usr/share/themes{,/Materia{/gtk-3.22,/gtk-assets/scalable}} and paste the log.. @nioncode Thanks! I'll check the permissions later.\nSo could you try my Adwaita-expt? This uses almost the same technique as Adwaita (and Materia) to render the checkboxes.. @nioncode Does the red box appear only in Firefox?\nIn other words, is it displayed properly in the GTK3 apps (e.g. gtk3-widget-factory, Nautilus' \"Preferences\" window, etc)?. Hmm, I'm quite confused.\nI tried changing the permissions based on your log, but I couldn't reproduce it on Fedora 27.\nIt's also strange that the check boxes are properly displayed in Nautilus. I guess this is a Firefox specific problem on NixOS. At least it looks like a different problem with this original report.\nI'm also confused that why gtk-common/ directory exists in your *-materia-theme-20180311/ directory. In v20180311, gtk-common/assets/ should have been replaced by gtk-assets/.\nSorry, but I have not found out the cause for now. I'll add help wanted tag and investigate it again later.. @nioncode Sorry for the delay in my response.\nNo need to be sorry, thanks for your contribution :)\nClosing.. You are right. I'll move those (and other remaining) color variables to _colors.scss.\nThanks for your report!. Thanks!. Thank you for your report. Now I added more space to the bottom of overview.\nHowever, if this issue also happens with the default gnome-shell theme, it would be better to report it to the BottomPanel's issue tracker.. Thanks!. Merged. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you for your report. Currently, Materia doesn't support Xfce. (see #60) But I receive many bug reports regarding Xfce, so I would like to support it as soon as possible. (If possible, next release?)\nHowever, this duplicates with #60, so I would like to close this as duplicate.. Thank you!. Happy new year!\nThank you very much!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89. Hi, thank you for your report!\nCertainly, it may be better to have a dark background with buttons in the modal dialogs as well.\nSo I will update it when I have time. :). Hi, thank you for your report!\nFor the moment, I cannot reproduce it and I have no idea why they become black...\nCould you tell me the version of Dash to dock you are using?. @bil-elmoussaoui Thank you for answering instead of me!\n@AlexWayfer Exactly.\nI have not confirmed yet, but I think this is a bug of the upstream librsvg (because those SVGs won't become black in web browsers, etc). And we may need a workaround until upstream fixes this bug...\nAnyway I would like to reopen this until the issue is properly handled.. @actionless Thanks!\nI guess the fill attribute no longer inherits to child elements (only when it's in the <svg> element?) on the new version of librsvg.\nI\u2019d report it to the upstream when I confirm it.. Now I reported this issue to the upstream: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/issues/181. I've added a workaround for gnome-shell & metacity. So now it should work well in those environments with librsvg 2.41.2.\nHowever this problem still remains in Unity, so I'd like to rename and keep opening this issue.. Good news. Upstream fixed the bug and will appear in 2.42.1. So I'd like to close this issue.. Hi @n3oxmind,\nI appreciate your understanding and fine work.\nBefore reviewing this, I have one question:\nWas it bad for you to simply improve my revised version? In my opinion, it is better and simpler to lump install items together as an function than to separate them. What do you think?\n\nAbout this script, I've noticed two issues. (In my version both are feasible, btw.)\n\n\nHow can I install all the variants at once with the script? In my opinion, it would be better to install all the variants without any options. (just sudo ./install.sh)\n\n\n./install.sh --color light dark doesn't seem to work. I think it would be nice to be able to specify more than one argument for --color option.. ~~@actionless Exactly.~~\n\n\n~~I guess this can be solved as follows (@n3oxmind, please try this):~~\n```bash\ncd materia-theme\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/master\ngit checkout --ours install.sh\ngit add .\ngit commit\nthen type :wq and hit Enter\ngit push origin master\n```\n~@n3oxmind~\n~~To be honest, I don't quite understand security. In the case of my script, what kind of security risk do we have?~~\n~~> also function will allow you to parse user inputs (command line arguments) and validate them and prevent the other invalid arguments from being processed.~~\n~~Hmm, I'm not very sure, but my script already prevents the other invalid arguments from being processed, doesn't it?~~\n\nOops, Please ignore this comment. (I didn't notice your comments have been updated...). @n3oxmind I'm sorry for my lack of explanation.\nAnyway I'll fix install.sh as you pointed out and push it to master. Thanks.. Hi, thank you for the pull request.\nIn Materia, it seems the overview animates the windows correctly even if the sector is defined.\nI tried investigating the Pop theme code and found out that the cause is border: none, not &:overview.\nTry this:\ndiff\n-  //&:overview, // <- this breaks the overview transition on the primary display. See https://github.com/pop-os/gtk-theme/issues/93\n+  &:overview,\n   &.unlock-screen,\n   &.login-screen,\n   &.lock-screen {\n     background-color: rgba($panel_bg_color, 0.5);\n-    border: none;\n+    border-color: transparent;\n     box-shadow: none;\n   }\nPop's #panel has bottom border with _extensions.scss and changes the border width with #panel:overview { border: none; }. Due to the size change, windows were not animated in Pop theme.. Hi, thank you for the report. :)\nThis bug has already been fixed with 6fe2f0771003a6e4c78b10b962d96d954158d657.\nHowever, as @AlexWayfer mentioned, it seems the AUR package has not been updated yet. (Its maintainer is @cthbleachbit, not me.)\nPlease wait for the package update, or you can also manually install this theme following the README.\n. Merged. Thanks!\nAbout _colors.scss.template, I would be pleased if you could send a PR. :). It's by design.\nUsers can lower the window with middle-clicking the titlebar, but cannot with the menubar. So I've separated the colors. But in Materia dark and light, since menubars are already too dark, I used the same colors for the titlebars.. Yes. It is intentional. :). These are the actual problems:\n1. Too much spaces with rotated (transform=\"rotate()\") assets.\nwith inkscape:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/gtk/assets/scale-vert-marks-after-slider-dark.png\nwith rsvg-convert:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/wip/rsvg/src/gtk/assets/scale-vert-marks-after-slider-dark.png\n2. Unclipped spaces (with clip-path=\"url()\").\nwith inkscape:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark/combo-ltr-button.png\nwith rsvg-convert:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/wip/rsvg/src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark/combo-ltr-button.png\n3. Not very good drop shadow rendering. (Carefully compare the button's drop shadows.)\nwith inkscape:\n\nwith rsvg-convert:\n. wip/rsvg is a test branch using rsvg-convert.. Hi,\nI tried to run ./materia-opensuse.sh in v20180110 then I got these error logs:\n```\n$ ./materia-opensuse.sh\n== Generating the CSS...\nError: Undefined variable: \"$gdm-bg-color\".\n        on line 2124 of src/gnome-shell/3.18/sass/_common.scss\n\n\nbackground: $gdm_bg_color;\n   --------------^\n```\n\n\n```\n$ ./materia-opensuse.sh\n== Generating the CSS...\nError: Undefined variable: \"$grey-900\".\n        on line 1515 of src/gnome-shell/3.26/sass/_common.scss\n\n\nbackground-color: $grey_900;\n\n----------------------^\n```\n\n\nSeems your script doesn't define $gdm_bg_color and $grey_900, so ./parse-sass.sh stopped and didn't change the CSS files properly.\nAdding these color variables to the SCSS files with your script should solve this issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/v20180110/src/gnome-shell/3.18/sass/_colors.scss#L47\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/v20180110/src/gnome-shell/3.18/sass/_color-palette.scss#L282\n\np.s.\nYour script looks very fine though, but I will update HACKING.md and describe how to change all the color schemes manually. :). @DarthWound So sorry for the late reply... I was busy and didn't have much time. :(\nI could reproduce the strange issue in your GTK2 theme, and it seems to happen with all the buttons.\n\nI don't know the exact cause, but I guess it's probably a rendering bug of the \"pixmap engine\" or GTK2 itself.\nBut I found a workaround to render them properly by using #FEFEFE instead of #FFFFFF for the button background color. It should work, I guess. :)\ndiff\n- sed -i 's/#FAFAFA/#FFFFFF/g' src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg\n+ sed -i 's/#FAFAFA/#FEFEFE/g' src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg. @DarthWound Great. You\u2019re welcome!. Hi, thanks for your feedback, again. :)\n\nThe white border seems to be a bug.\nSo I'll fix that. :)\nProbably it's a same issue as #194. I'm going to add buttons to the dialogs.. Fixed. Please let me know if issues still remain in this window manager (Metacity/Marco).. Hi, thanks for reporting the bug.\n\nI think it's not a Materia-dark/Equilux specific problem, but the problem of the entire dark themes. I believe this occurs in Adwaita-dark too. Although This should really be fixed by upstream Firefox, I'll investigate whether there is a workaround. ;). I didn't have that plan, but it would be nice to have Plank theme for Materia.\nThanks for the suggestion!. LGTM :+1: \nThanks a lot!. Hi @ppisarcik, thanks for your report! I confirmed this issue with Ubuntu 16.04. And this is a PPA issue.\n@igor-dyatlov, could you please remove the version restriction of libgtk-3-common (>= 3.22.15) from your PPA? Although Materia supports GTK+ >=3.18, I think it's okay to just remove the version restriction.. @ppisarcik You're welcome :)\n@igor-dyatlov Great! Thanks a lot! \ud83c\udf89. @USBA It's okay to ask for help, but this is not an appropriate place (as you know).\nHow about opening an issue in your ASHES-theme repository and talk together there? Or, the best practice I think is to create your new theme repository, open the issue, and tag me (@nana-4). Then I get notifications and I may help you if I can. :). I confirmed this bug. Thanks for the clear report!. Hi! Thanks for letting me know!\nSo I will wait until you submit the PR. :smile:\nThank you in advance for your work!. I was just thinking about it, but sorry, I don't have any good ideas yet.\nConsidering maintainability, the current method may be better than adding templates to metacity/gtk2/svg like scss.. That will definitely be helpful !!\nSo can I start migrating the color scheme and close this now?. Excuse me, but to be sure, what's \"replacement palette\"? Is it _colors.scss.template, right?. I understand. Of cause I'll update these lines too!. I'm so sorry for the delay in my response... I've fixed it now.. Wow, you are so fast! \ud83d\ude06\nThanks!. LGTM :+1: \nThanks a lot!. > I am not sure how to modify the PNG's\nDid you run ./render-assets.sh in the materia-theme directory after editing src/gtk/assets.svg, src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg and src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg? You also need to run ./install.sh or ./test.sh to see the changes on the theme.\n\nwith a Adwaita's window controls (but slimmer and flatter)\n\nI'm not sure what \"Adwaita's window controls\" is. Arc has special window control buttons (by PNG assets e.g. this), but Adwaita and Materia have normal (flat) window control buttons. Can you clarify it with mockup etc?. > Yes, I did, and assets.svg was updated accordingly.\nAnd yes, I used install.sh.\nSo, are your PNG assets in /usr/share/themes/Materia/gtk-assets properly changed to Arc's blue? If so, I guess you have installed Materia to both ~/.themes and /usr/share/themes. You need to delete Materia* dirs from either one (pink one).\n\nI did not edit gtk-2.0/assets.svg, nor gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg, I'll fix that (although I do not use dark themes, so I did not think of editing the dark variant while testing).\n\nBut if you don't need dark variant, you don't need to edit gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg :)\n\nI was hoping to use the normal window control buttons, however arc-icon-theme apparently modifies it to show a flat version of arc-gtk-theme's window controls\n\nI see. So I think you'll have to change the window-*-symbolic.svg icons in arc-icon-theme.. Hmm, possibly you are misunderstanding about check boxes and radio buttons. In Materia, checkbox-checked.png etc. are used only for GTK+ 3.18. For GTK+ 3.20 or later, checkbox-checked-symbolic.svg etc. are used and recolored by CSS. So if you want to change the pink colors of check, switch, etc. for GTK+ 3.20 or later, you have to edit $accent_color to your color and run ./parse-sass.sh.. > the PNGs remain pink.\nStrange. Do your PNG assets in materia-theme/src/gtk/assets also remain pink?\n\nHow should I go about it?\n\nI'm not an icon theme maker or arc-icon-theme user, so I don't know exactly. But I think it'll be okay if you download the source of the icon theme and change the SVGs then install the icon theme according to README.\nAlso can you attach a screenshot of gtk3-widget-factory applying your ongoing theme?. I'm so sorry for the delay in my response, but I didn't know what I should say. Because from your screenshots, nothing seems to have changed as well as assets colors... I can only say that please read HACKING.md carefully and please do trial and error by yourself. I'm busy so I can't support you from A to Z. Sorry.. I don't know if you are still interested in this, but before closing I'll write down the detailed way to modify the PNGs:\n\nFirst, remove installed Materia themes to make sure:\n\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/Materia{,-dark,-light}{,-compact}\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/themes/Materia{,-dark,-light}{,-compact}\nrm -rf ~/.themes/Materia{,-dark,-light}{,-compact}\n\nClone materia-theme and move its directory in the terminal:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme.git\ncd materia-theme\n\nOpen SVG files in text editor, then edit & save colors:\n\ngedit src/gtk/assets.svg src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg\n\nConfirm those SVG colors are changed with image viewer:\n\neog src/gtk/assets.svg src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg\n\nRun ./render-assets.sh to re-render PNG assets:\n\n./render-assets.sh\n\nRun ./install.sh script:\n\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nReload Materia theme.\n\n\nIf you couldn't succeed even with this, sorry but I can't help you anymore :/ Please ask in other community forums.\nClosing.. It's my fault. Sorry for the trouble. I've fixed it now.. Sorry, but I don't understand why you needed to do such a method. If you are using v20180311 or latest git of  materia-theme, you should not need to do more than written in the wiki.\nAre you using an older version of Materia?. > also, the glib-compile-resources binary is part of the glib2-devel install package on fedora. please indicate in wiki?\nIt should already have been written in the Requirements section. :). I would like to close this - since there is no reply from the original reporter and\n\nWould be nice to have an option in the install script to detect the currently installed main version of gnome-shell and have the gdm be replaced on install as well.\n\nwas achieved with #231 :). Hi, thanks for the ticket and PR!\nI intentionally hard-coded $tooltip_bg_color because if both %MENU_BG% and %SEL_FG% are defined with blighter colors, tooltip's text color will be almost invisible. But I decided to merge your PR and add $tooltip_fg_color: %MENU_FG%; to deal with it.\nThanks again for your work!. @svnset Nice spotted! Thanks for your suggestion. :)\nIndeed we should separate SEL_FG from the panel fg colors, but we also can't use FG, BTN_FG or MENU_FG because they are not always light colors.\nMy alternative solution is to extend $dark_fg_color and $light_fg_color then use $light_fg_color (and derivers) for the panel. Also $dark_fg_color and $light_fg_color will be used for $fg_color and derivers. That mean, it should look like this:\n```scss\n$dark_fg_color:           %DARK_FG%;\n$dark_secondary_fg_color: rgba(%DARK_FG%, 0.7);\n$dark_hint_fg_color:      rgba(%DARK_FG%, 0.5);\n...\n$light_fg_color:           %LIGHT_FG%;\n$light_secondary_fg_color: rgba(%LIGHT_FG%, 0.7);\n$light_hint_fg_color:      rgba(%LIGHT_FG%, 0.5);\n...\n$fg_color:           if($variant == 'light', $dark_fg_color, $light_fg_color);\n$secondary_fg_color: if($variant == 'light', $dark_secondary_fg_color, $light_secondary_fg_color);\n$hint_fg_color:      if($variant == 'light', $dark_hint_fg_color, $light_hint_fg_color);\n...\n```\n@actionless Is it possible to add variables like %DARK_FG% and %LIGHT_FG%? Or do you have any other ideas?. > also i am not sure what rgba() thing would work good for all-dark colorschemes -- i think it would be better to use mix() instead\nHmm, I'm still thinking rgba() is a very effective value for most cases. (see the \"Legibility\" section.) In what case do you think mix() is better?. @svnset Nice spotted, too. :)\nSince this is a \"Material Design\" theme, I think the theme should always have light alpha colors for highlight colors and dark alpha colors for border colors regardless of whether light/dark/standard. I'll review those values.. @actionless The reason why I suggested something like DARK_FG/LIGHT_FG is because sometimes themes always need to have light/dark colors, regardless of whether the theme is light, dark or colorful.\nFor example, the background of gnome-shell's overview is always dark (even light themes). Since the background is hard-coded to dark shade, having dark text color is not valid here.\nFor another example, the check mark on white in the color picker must always be darker color, lighter color is not valid here as well.. Hmm, sorry. I'm late for this discussion while writing replies.... Thanks for the report! This issue has already been reported in #148. So I'd like to close this as a duplicate.\n(However I'd like to fix it as soon as possible... \ud83d\udcad). @Slomo17 I understand your opinion about the new titlebar color (thanks for that), but I don't understand why you need to refer to Adapta. It's just one of the downstream themes, there is no necessity to bring it out here.. Hey, thank you everyone. Your opinions are very helpful for future decision making!\nThe current title bar color (#303030) is in line with Material Design guidelines, but I will consider making it a little brighter.. @DarthWound Thanks for sharing your program. That's so cool. :)\nAlso thanks for your suggestion. It looks nice, but my only concern is that Matetia-light also has a dark theme (for gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme). I think the combination of light top bar and dark theme (especially when maximized) probably does not look good.. @eracoon \n\nWould be great is a colour sheme like that would be available\n\nSorry but we can't add any more variants because it's hard to maintain many variants. However, I welcome suggestions for alternative default colors that are acceptable for many people. :). @unfulvio \n\nOut of curiosity what were the reasons prompting for change?\n\nGood question. It's mainly in order to follow the Material Design guidelines more accurately.\nThe neutral Grey colors have been recommended for dark theme in the guidelines. It is easy to handle and matches any accent color. Blue Grey (ish) colors were a bit difficult to control.\nFor accent color, I liked the pink, but it had many discontented opinions. Also I had to admit that Pink A200 was a bit dazzling on dark theme. Tael 500 was good brightness on both light and dark themes and used in many samples of Material Design, so I chose it.. @DarthWound Nope, so far. The current (neutral) translucent black is the only feasible thing I can think of.. # Announcement\nIn the new release, we dropped the teal color (#01A299, which we called secondary color) to precisely follow the Material Design guidelines.\nBackground\nAccording to the refreshed Material Design guidelines, primary color is mainly used for top bars and secondary color is used for other elements. So shipping the (additional) teal color was wrong.\nWhat's changed\nIn the new Materia:\n\nPrimary color is dark gray (#383838) or light gray (#E0E0E0) and used for top bars.\nSecondary color is blue (#4285F4) and used for other elements as highlight.\nAnd we no longer use tertiary accent color.\n\nSee the ChangeLog for detailed changes in this release.. I'm not sure, but I hope this color change is friendly even for color blind people... ;)\nFeedback is welcomed, but before that, please try to get used to it to a certain extent.. Regarding Gray vs. Blue-Gray:\nFrankly, I'm pretty certain that Blue-Gray background color is already quite outdated in 2019. I recognize that Blue-Gray background color is no longer being used in many modern websites and apps. I want to make Materia way modern at all times, so I have no mind to go back the color scheme from Gray to Blue-Gray at the moment.\nIf you (still) not fan of the neutral Gray colors, please,\n\nget used to it,\nor change the color scheme with Oomox,\nor just use other theme.\n\nP.S. If you feel the current Gray colors looks brownish, I'd say it's because you get accustomed to Blue-Gray colors and causing an optical illusion. This could be solved by getting used ;). @ceyhunnabiyev Yeah, that makes sense and is in line with Material Guidelines. (And that is what I've wanted to do since before.) I'm going to make it the next milestone. Thanks for your suggestion :). Hmm, that sounds reasonable.\nThanks a lot! :+1: . Sorry for the late reply again :P\nFirst of all, thanks @svnset  for your good job!\nAlso thanks @actionless for reviewing ;)\nMostly LGTM :+1: \nJust one note: I was thinking GTK3_GENERATE_DARK will be implemented properly in the future for gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme, but I put it aside for now because we will be able to implement it later. :). @actionless I don't have the dropdown problem with this PR. I'm on Fedora 27, gnome-shell, gtk+ 3.22.26, and don't have any custom css. Though I'll investigate that problem.. > We can leave a placeholder for this, but for now this value makes not much sense.\nYou're right. :). Finally I could reproduce the problem on \"awesome\" window manager.\nI will investigate it further.. It seems to be due to $opaque_*fg_color variables in _colors.scss.template was not changed. (awesome wm seems to be using non-csd menu (which is used as a workaround in in Materia) instead of csd one.)\n@svnset Could you fix them as follows?\n$opaque_fg_color:           %FG%;\n$opaque_secondary_fg_color: mix(%FG%, $base_color, percentage(0.7));\n$opaque_disabled_fg_color:  mix(%FG%, $base_color, percentage(0.5));\n$opaque_divider_color:      mix(%FG%, $base_color, percentage(0.12));. > Also i spotted another gtk2 issue, the button colors are still #424242.\nIn Materia GTK2 theme, this one is used for the button text color. Of course BTN_FG can be used for the GTK2 button, but for some reasons I'm thinking that BTN_FG and BTN_BG should be dropped in Materia.\nMaybe I should explain the reasons in #218. :P. @actionless Did you change the $opaque_*fg_color values as per the code above? In my results they are output properly:\n```css\n.popup:not(.csd) menu menuitem {\n  color: #d4d4d4;\n}\n.popup:not(.csd) menu menuitem:hover {\n  background-color: #5c5c5c;\n}\n.popup:not(.csd) menu menuitem:disabled {\n  color: #909090;\n}\n.popup:not(.csd) menu accelerator {\n  color: #ababab;\n}\n```. > @nana-4, is that an intended look?\nYes, Materia originally did not use SEL_BG ($primary_color) for menu hovered bg.\nSo can we merge this PR now?\nSorry for asking. But I'm not sure whether if you are planning to do that with this PR or with another ticket.. OK, thanks guys for this great job! :+1: . @hackel Thanks for reporting this.\nI would like to assign this issue to @igor-dyatlov. Thanks in advance. :smiley: . @igor-dyatlov Sorry for the late reply.\nI'm not familiar with make, but when I learn it more I'd switch the installation script to make (or meson?).\nThanks for your advice.. @igor-dyatlov Sounds great! Thanks. :). We've dropped the so-called secondary color. (See https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/220#issuecomment-460316054 for details.) So this should have been obsolete now.\nI'm gonna close this issue.. Yes, the wiki is written for a newer version (v20180311 or later) of the theme, and the PPA was not working, but now it has been fixed.\nSo I would like to close this now, but please let me know if you notice any problems about changing the GDM theme with the new PPA.\nThanks for your report.. ~IIRC, only sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3 is not enough.~\n~Please try:~\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3\nsudo systemctl stop lightdm.service\nsudo systemctl start gdm.service\n\n~UPDATE: Seems I made a mistake on older GDM theme. You're right. Sorry for the trouble. I'll fix it sooner, so please do not switch to GDM until then.~\nUPDATE 2: Actually it seems to be due to the PPA.. @igor-dyatlov materia-gtk-theme - 20180321-1-0ubuntu1~xenial1 deb file (for Ubuntu 16.04.x / GNOME Shell 3.18.x) seems to have a wrong version of gnome-shell.css. The deb file for xenial should have gnome-shell.css for 3.18, but in fact it has the CSS for 3.28. (And this GDM crash seems to be due to that.)\nCould you please fix the wrong version of gnome-shell.css in your PPA?. @igor-dyatlov \nIt seems materia-gtk-theme - 20180321-1-0ubuntu1~artful1 (for Ubuntu 17.10.x / GNOME Shell 3.26.x) also have gnome-shell.css for 3.28, but should have the CSS for 3.26 as well.\nAlso, just for your information, the official package for bionic is now available, so I think materia-gtk-theme - 20180321-1-0ubuntu1~bionic1 should no longer be necessary. ~I will update the README soon to make it clear.~ -> Updated with bf108c7eb80ec2649abef435eaeebeff2d5bdb4f. @igor-dyatlov Thanks for investigating. It seems bc is required for Build-Depends.\nSorry, but I didn't think it is needed to specify in the requirement.... @igor-dyatlov Thanks a lot!\nI updated the PPA package on Ubuntu 16.04 and confirmed the GDM theme now works fine.\nSo I'd like to close this issue. :wink: . Thanks for telling me your ideas!\n\nThat makes sense. I've just been thinking about such an idea. :) If someone (if possible, you?) sent me a PR to implement that, it would be very helpful to me.\nPersonally I'm not very interested in grub2 theme, so it would be low priority. However I would appreciate if someone help us to make and implement it.\nMaybe, no possibility (at the moment). Creating/supporting a transparency theme has various technical difficulties. (e.g. GTK2 themes can never have transparency. etc.) Also IMO transparency theme conflicts with the concept of Material Design. Therefore I'm not considering supporting it for now.\nI've been planning on forking paper-icon-theme (for personal use) to match with Materia, but I cannot do that for the time being because there are many other important tasks right now. But I really want to do that when other tasks are finished. :)\n. I've changed the title to clarify the issue/task.\n\nRegarding the icon theme, I'll keep it in the back of my head. ;). Thanks to @igor-dyatlov, the PPA has been fixed.\nThanks guys for your report and help. I think I can close this now, but please let me know if any problems remain.. @igor-dyatlov Many thanks! I will update the README of material-ubuntu-theme to add your PPA. :). Thanks for reporting the bug.\nThe drop-shadow problem sometimes occurs not only in that app. But sadly, it cannot be fixed by theme. :(\nIt's actually an upstream issue.. Thank you so much!!. LGTM! Thanks a lot! (And sorry for the late response.)\nJust a small question: \nWhy not simply mv -f /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource{,.bak} ?\nIs there any problem with this? :). Thank you for trying to make the Cinnamon theme! Of course it's a big welcome!\n\nI'm following the design cues of the Gnome Shell theme and were applicable reusing the Gnome Shell assets and code for equivalent elements.\n\nThat's very good idea :+1:\nJust one question (to be sure):\nWhich theme is you planning to use as a base for the Cinnamon theme?\nDefault Cinnamon theme? Oomox? Adapta? Or others?\nIn any case, it needs to be able to ship as GPL version 2 or later.. @smurphos Sounds great! My little concern is gone now. Thanks :D. As @actionless  said, you need quotes in that line, @rudrab.\nWe updated change_color.sh, HACKING.md, etc. to reproduce the previous Flat-Plat's color scheme more accurately with the script, so I'd like to close this.. Thanks for the report!\nI confirmed this. I'll fix it as soon as possible.. Great job! :tada: Thank you very much for your hard work! Overall it looks very nice :)\nWell, I should have said this first when you kindly contacted me (sorry), but my current bigger requests are:\n\nI'd prefer 2 spaces for the SCSS indentation as other .scss files do. Could you change the indentation from 4 to 2? :)\nI'd prefer to unify the section files (src/_sass/cinnamon/sections/*.scss) as src/_sass/cinnamon/_common.scss in order to easily follow the upstream changes. (Please refer to the gnome-shell common file.) To me, it would be hard to compare the original one file and the current split files. Would you mind unifying the split files as _common.scss and sort the classes as with the upstream cinnamon.css?\n\n\nApologies for the additional commits\n\nNo need to apologize. :smile:  I'm also sorry for the late reply. \ud83d\ude1c. Well done! Thanks a lot!! :tada: \n\nwould you like the _extends incorporated into _common as-well or keep them as a separate import?\nI made an executive decision that keeping the extends separate make sense - they are easy to cross-reference particularly when it's only 2 documents.\n\nYeah, I'm also OK with keeping them as a separate import :)\n\nOnly major difference in... \n... If you are comparing directly with the upstream please be aware that the upstream needs some clean up - it has a few never used and/or deprecated circa 6 years ago selectors hanging around.\n\nAlright. I totally agree with you :+1: \nThe main reasons why I didn't support Cinnamon theme was because the upstream cinnamon.css is a bit unmaintained and isn't using SCSS. It would be great if the upstream also converts cinnamon.css to SCSS and clean up the code, though. Perhaps you are the suitable person for that. \ud83d\ude0b\nAnyway, I can merge this now, but if you want to review this again, we can take some time.\nMay I merge this now?. Glad to hear that. Thank you!. Hi, thanks for your report.\nHm, it looks very strange. I couldn't reproduce it in my environment.\nDoes this problem also occur in Adwaita? Or, does it also occur with other icon themes?. > I have a HiDPI screen, perhaps the issue is with the icons not scaling together with the text on HiDPI screens? I didn't have the same problem with Adapta though.\nFrom your screenshots, icons don't seem to be scaled together even in Adwaita and Adapta. \n\nAs you can see, Adwaita seems to have more padding.\n\nCompared to the screenshot of Numix, Adwaita's one looks rather similar to Materia. FYI, Adwaita's rows height in the sidebar is 36px, and Materia's one is 32px in normal scaling.\n\nAdapta:\n\nI don't think Adapta can be comparable because it's not upstream and it's sizing in a quite quirky way (using em instead of px). So please use the upstream Adwaita for comparison. :)\nAnyway, to me it looks like an upstream GTK+ issue. Could you report this issue to the upstream?\n. @hfel So sorry for the late reply. I was pretty busy for other things... Also I was thinking that it's bad timing to report a issue since upstream GNOME was just transitioning from Bugzilla to Gitlab. :)\n\nSure, though I'm not an expert, so not exactly sure where I should report it; to Adwaita or GTK+?\n\nGTK3 Adwaita is part of GTK+, so it's okay to report it to GTK+.\nBy the way, from your screenshots, its scale factor doesn't look like exactly 200%. Perhaps aren't you enabling the experimental fractional scaling?\n\nI think you'll need such exact information when reporting the issue to the upstream.. To clarify this issue, I took two screenshots.\nMateria-light:\n\nAdwaita:\n\nAs shown in the screenshots, places sidebar's row heights are exactly same with your scaled Natuilus and non-scaled one in both Adwaita and Materia. So I can say that this is completely an upstream issue.. I reported this issue to the upstream app, since I thought this is rather an upstream issue.\nAlso this app doesn't have any specific style classes, so it's difficult to control the style by the theme.. Did you also change the ubuntu.css file as written in the wiki?. Yeah, you're right. :+1: I've added \"or later\" to the sentences. Thanks for your advice.\nClosing.. LGTM :+1: Thanks a lot!\nI may make minor changes later, but anyway I marge this :)\n\nI guess the GTK .css hadn't been updated following previous commits to master?\n\nOops, you're right. Thanks ;-). I've fixed it. Thanks for your report!. So sorry for the late review...\nLooks good to me. Thanks! :smile: . Wow, thank you very much for this! :D. I've fixed it. Thanks for your report!. Fixed. Thanks!. Now I've fixed it (except for Inkscape-specific error/warning which even pure Inkscape SVG has).\nThanks for pointing it out!. @AndreasBackx I'm so sorry for the late reply. I was very busy these days...\nIndeed, in the warning box (infobar.warning) the text isn't legible. But I'm not considering adding text-shadow into Materia - since in Material Design elements do not have text-shadow basically. So I'd prefer to change the background or foreground color to make it legible.\nHowever, you can add text-shadow into your own theme. In the case of the warning box, you need to change\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/d74792e8c17fe3ab278db7ad3e8cfeeb628b76bf/src/_sass/gtk/_common-3.20.scss#L3120\nto\nscss\n  &.warning {\n    background-color: $warning_bg_color;\n    text-shadow: $shadow_1;\n    -gtk-icon-shadow: $shadow_1;\n  }\nI'm also considering using Sass function to automatically change the foreground color according to the brightness of the background color. Although it's not easy because we have to consider the compatibility with oomox... :P\n@n3oxmind Thanks for your efforts!. > I'm unsure whether GTK allows opacity in text, but then we could just set it to use the black with an opacity of 87% perhaps according to Material Design specs?\nUnfortunately GTK2 doesn't allow opacity in text, but in GTK3 and GNOME Shell, it's already done!\n\nI've tried to use oomox with this theme to create my own. But in my opinion the integration with oomox is a bit too lackluster currently to be useful. I had a hard time changing the settings to what I wanted them to be. I felt like materia-theme was adapting to oomox when imo it should be the other way around. Omoox should let you change the colors defined in the SASS files instead of having another less configurable layer on top of it.\n\nI can understand the complaint about it. Adaptability with Oomox is not yet perfect. But it is being improved step by step. I'm currently pretty busy so I cannot spare time on it for now, but any contribution to that is very welcomed.\nSo, can we close this now?. Okay, that feature is already mentioned in #218 (not by me though) so I'll use the issue for tracking. :). Hey, thanks for the detailed report ;) I've addressed this issue finally.\nHowever, Chrome's GTK+ theme integration is still not very good, so I'd still recommend using Chrome theme and enabling \"Use system title bar and borders\" so far.... Thanks for the report.\nIt seems this bug happens in any light gnome-shell themes and cannot be fixed by the theme, so I reported it to the upstream.\nhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/issues/323. Thank you for the report! I hope I was able to fix it with the above commit.\nPlease let me know if the problem still exists. Thanks.. Amazing job! I'm very amateur of shell script, so this rework is very helpful for me \ud83d\ude06\nThanks a lot @TiZ-EX1!\nAlso thanks @actionless for your reviewing :). Hi @adalvigi,\nThanks for your kind words. And I'm sorry for the late reply.\nI think this is a duplicate of #79, so I want to close this. But before that, I have a few questions for you.\n\nAre you using GTK+ 3.18.x? If so, what distro and version are you using?\n\n\nNOTE: GTK+ 3.18 is very old and difficult to control the sizes. So Materia doesn't provide compact variants for GTK+ 3.18. (Maybe the compact variants are listed in the Tweak Tool, but they are nothing different from the standard size in GTK+ 3.18.)\n\n\nDo you think the top bar of GNOME Shell is still high even if using the compact variant?\n\n\nI wanted to fix the the top bar height at 28px in compact variant, since I thought it would be ugly if it got even smaller.\n\n\nWhat is the actual resolution of your monitor?. p.s.\n\n\nand I absolutely don't think we're entitled to telling you what to do\n\nAny suggestions are always welcomed to me. :). > But since the compact version of Materia was in my opinion already a very tasteful choice you made, I think it wouldn't be right to completely replace it, and it would be better to just make a Materia-dark-very-compact version or something like that.\nI'm not planning to add any more variants, since supporting so many variants is very hard... I'm only thinking about making the current compact variant more compact so far.\nAnyway, thanks for your nice feedback! Your opinions will be a good reference for the sizing of compact variant. :)\nClosing.. Of course, I will!\nHowever, GTK4 is still under heavy development and there are still many API changes. So it's too early to start developing the theme. :)\nBut I will mention the GTK4 support at TODO.md.. Thanks for the bug report. I'll fix it sooner. :). Hey @arnSky, thanks for your feedback!\nAfter researching, it seems more likely that Unity 7 will be maintained by the community based team.\nSince supporting Unity 7 theme is relatively easy, I decided to continue to support it.\nHowever...\nUbuntu 16.04 is (still) using GTK+ 3.18. I reconsidered once again, but I cannot keep supporting GTK+ 3.18 anymore. Because it requires a lot of hard work.\nSo I made the final adjustments for GTK+ 3.18 and released v20180928. Ubuntu 16.04 users will need to keep using this version. Sorry for that.. @arnSky Thanks for your understanding.\nBy the way, I've made gtk-3-18 branch that left GTK+ 3.18 support. Though I wouldn't add new UI changes or new features on that branch anymore, it may receive hotfix updates if critical bugs occur on GTK+ 3.18.\nSo if you find a serious problem on GTK+ 3.18, feel free to report the issue. (It'll be not necessarily resolved, though.). Yeah, that is definitely not hard. :)\nHowever, I don't know what it's worth to publish for Materia theme. If you are using Materia GTK+ theme then applied Materia FirefoxColor theme, visually almost nothing changes. Who is expected to use it for what? I can't imagine who will use the Materia FirefoxColor theme. :). Okay, in my understanding, FirefoxColor is to change the default color scheme to a fancy color scheme. Cloning Materia color scheme to FirefoxColor would have no meaning.\nSo I would like to close this, but thanks for your suggestion. :). Thanks  for the report! I'll fix this soon.. I forgot this :P I will. Thanks for the suggestion!. Yes, Materia is compatible with GNOME 3.28.x.\n(When opening an issue, please clarify your problems or questions.)\nClosing.... Sorry for the late reply. Well, actually $*panel_bg_color are used for GNOME Shell's top bar.\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/d74792e8c17fe3ab278db7ad3e8cfeeb628b76bf/src/_sass/_colors.scss#L53-L57\nEspecially,\n\n$panel_bg_color for normal top bar (with transparency).\n$solid_panel_bg_color for when windows are maximized or tiled.\n\nRegarding the change_color.sh script, I believe it should work if you feed full palette to the command, as @actionless stated. :). Thanks for reporting the issue. :+1: \n\nThis is on the compact dark variant. Would be good to see these window decorations match the rest of the window color, much like Numix does. I reckon it'd look rather neat.\n\nI agree with you. But for some reasons it was not easy to achieve that... In any case I'll think about how it works well.. I'm SO sorry for the late acceptation.\nAnyway, I appreciate your pull requests. Thanks a lot!. I'm so sorry for the delay in my response.\nCurrently, Materia is not officially supporting Xfce (see #60), but\n\nWhen i use \"materia\" theme, \"appmenu\" use a lot of cpu (about 15-20%)\n\nmaybe it's a duplicate of #177.

But sadly, it seems there is no way to do it so far. So I decided to report it to dash-to-dock.\nThanks for your report anyway.. Thankfully, a feature request I filed against dash-to-dock may be accepted and merged. Then we will be able to hide the white dots when using a custom indicator.\nThe PR #319 will be merged when the new version of dash-to-dock is released (and if the upstream PR is merged).. I'm so sorry for the delay in my response...\nIn my environment, Thunderbird 60.2.1 looks like the screenshots below.

Sorry for the late reply.\nSince our PRs have been accepted in Flathub, compact variants are also now available. :). Looks like @actionless is right. The background color of Omnibox is hard-coded with #F1F3F4 in all themes (including Adwaita, Adwaita-dark).\nUnfortunately, we cannot do anything unless it's addressed by the upstream.. Thanks for the bug report. I confirmed this problem.\nI'll fix it soon. :). Today Materia added support for GNOME 3.30. The visual bugs of slider/level-bar also should be fixed in this cycle.\nThanks guys for your reports. ;). Hi, I guess you're enabling the \"Built-in theme\" option. Please try disabling it.\n\n. @rolurq Yes.\nIf you have knowledge of SCSS, edit this line from 32px to 0 then run ./parse-sass.sh.\nIf you want to change the CSS directly, open the CSS and edit these four 32px to 0.. This is not the theme bug, and I won't (can't) add a workaround for the \"Built-in theme\".\nSo I would like to close this issue.. @FFY00 That margin is an area for Materia to draw Raven's box-shadow. That change only loses the shadow from Raven when you turn off the \"Built-in theme\" option.. Thanks for the info! It looks very nice :+1: :100: \nI'll add your VSCode theme's links to the README :wink: . @m-thorsen I'm sorry for the late reply, and thanks for your info and effort!\nI'll replace the link in the README with new one :). Hi, thanks for your suggestion.\nFor some reasons I basically want to force users to install the themes in /usr/share/themes. Because:\n\n\nSome DEs can read themes from $HOME/.themes, but cannot read from $HOME/.local/share/themes. Some other DEs can read themes from $HOME/.local/share/themes, but cannot read from $HOME/.themes.\n  /usr/share/themes is the only location where all DEs can read themes.\n\n\nForcing the location (by default) makes it easier to write the docs.\n\n\nUsers can specify the destination directory with ./install.sh -d DEST_DIR.\n\n\nIn short, /usr/share/themes is the most trouble-free location, but $HOME/.themes sometimes gets into trouble.\nSo I would like to close this as WONTFIX, but if you have a good idea please let me know.. Thanks for your reports!\nThis bug has been fixed thanks to @NicoVarg99's insight :). @ivzave Oops, you're right. I didn't carefully test the fix commit (because that problem didn't occur on my 1920x1080 screen)...\nThanks for letting me know!. @RussianNeuroMancer Thanks for the tip!\nI've already realized that even Adwaita does not work it perfectly, but I'll try to reduce the bugs as much as Adwaita has :). @RussianNeuroMancer Thanks! I'll address it shortly \ud83d\ude42. Hi @varlesh, thanks for filing this! I'm happy to see the port to KDE and the integration into your great icon theme. :)\n\nMateria Dark used #bdbdbd color for that\n\nNo, actually Materia (dark) is using rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7) for flat buttons, inactive tabs, hint text, etc. It is #FFFFFF with transparency, not an opaque color:\n\nUsing text opacity is based on the Material Guidelines. Also that guideline says \"Avoid using opaque gray text that isn\u2019t legible on colored surfaces\".\nBTW, the value of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7) is based on the (previous) Material Guidelines, so I don't really want to change the color value.\nTherefore, I think there are two options:\n\nChange the opaque #bdbdbd to rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7), if possible.\nIf translucent colors are not available on the Plasma theme, use #C6DAFC when its background color is #4285f4.\n. Hi @SmartFinn  \n\nTo be honest, I'm reluctant to do it. Because: \n\nRegardless of any other gtk/icon theme, I'd like to follow the Material Guidelines first. The guidelines recommended 70% opacity for light secondary text, and Google's material-components-web also has adopted it.\nTo me rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7) works very well as a secondary text color. Materia used rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75) before, but it was sometimes a bit too bright.\n\nHowever, in my honest opinion, I think Papirus' panel icon color and Materia's panel text/icon color are almost matched. It doesn't bother me :). BTW, materia-kde seems to use #4285f4 as the background color when hovering items, but I highly recommend to use rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08) (or similar darker gray) instead, as Materia gtk/gnome-shell theme does:\n\nIt's based on the Material Guidelines as well.. @actionless Thanks for the advice. I will keep it in mind.\n\n(mb that note should be also added to HACKING.md?)\n\nNot sure, but maybe 99% of users do not need that note :). @varlesh OK, thanks for the clarification.\nSo, I'd like to propose this solution for the Plasma Theme:\n\nStay the icon/text color current\nAvoid using #4285f4 for background color as much as possible\n\nIt means changing button.svg and viewitem.svg to the flat button style like the window control buttons. I beliave it will make Materia-KDE look better while keeping compatibility with Materia GTK/Shell. Is it possible?. > I can modify all SVG-elements (icons , buttons opacity). But problem with text. Text not support Alpha Channel.\nI already understand it. And the actual problem of this report should have been this:\n\n... and not good looking with Plasma Theme, because highlight color #4285f4 not good readable with layering #bdbdbd\n\nSo I suggested changing the background color (#4285f4) instead of the text color for Plasma Theme. The combo of #bdbdbd fg-color and dark gray bg-colors looks much better, isn't it?\n\nAm I still misunderstanding something?. P.S. I don't mind even if you set the text brighter in your Plasma Theme as a workaround.\nBut I won't do that in the GNOME/GTK+ themes because they support Alpha Channel for text and symbolic icons. \ud83d\ude42. So sorry for the delay in my response.\nIt's due to Pop OS having its own gnome-shell theme. Even though supporting \"Pop session\" is not impossible, it requires a ton of work. So it's not reasonable (for me).\nInstead, please install gnome-session and select it on the login screen. Then third-party themes including Materia will be shown without such visual problems on Pop OS. (Materia theme won't support \"Pop session\".). Thanks for the report.\nBut all sizing of Firefox are hard-coded. (Chrome is the same as well.) With GTK+ themes, we cannot add padding to the Firefox menus.. Thanks for the bug report. This seems to occur only when the GtkSwitch is in the GtkGrid.\nIndeed it looks pretty bad, but it seems not easy to fix the problem by the theme.\n\nWould it be possible to specify left and right padding for this specific widget in the materia-theme, so the padding stretches to fill available space, instead of the widget itself?\n\nThat is possible with grid > switch { margin-left: 105px; } (you can try it by pasting the code to the GTK+ Inspector), but it will unnecessarily affect other apps (e.g. gnome-notes' performance window).\nThis problem happens even in the upstream Adwaita, so I'd like to close this as an upstream issue.. > (I will also report directly to the maintainers of the above applications).\nI'm not sure, but this may be rather a problem of the upstream GTK+ (actually GtkGrid, because this happens even in the default Adwaita theme).\nCould you also report to the maintainers of GTK+?. @PJSingh5000 Thanks for your reports. :). OMG, I completely forgot to update the template. \ud83d\ude31 \nThanks for the PR!\n. What desktop environment and version are you using?\nI couldn't reproduce it on MATE 1.20.3 or GNOME Shell 3.28.3.\n\n. Thanks for the report.\nI\u2019d say this is an upstream issue. And I've reported this to the upstream:\nhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/issues/674. Now, the upstream developer reopened the above issue and removed the Not GNOME label, but I closed this issue too early. Since this has already landed in Nautilus 3.30.1, I'll add a workaround for it.. Maybe a stupid question, but my only concern is whether we can really silence the citation without paying 1000 EUR.\nAre materia-theme, oomox, or their distro packages really not treated as the \"publication\"?\nI'm not 100% sure because I'm not good at English.\n. > i think by \"publication\" it was meant \"publication of scientific research in magazine\"\nAha, your're right. I ran parallel --citation and it says:\n\nIf you use programs that use GNU Parallel to process data for an article in a\nscientific publication, please cite:\n\nHowever, adding --citation flag in the script was meaningless. It returned\n\nparallel: Warning: --citation ignores all other options and arguments.\n\nand didn't generate the assets. Instead, --will-cite flag is available to silence the citation notice in the script, but man parallel says:\n\n--citation\nPrint the citation notice and BibTeX entry for GNU parallel, silence citation notice for all future runs, and exit. It will not run any commands.\nIf it is impossible for you to run --citation you can instead use --will-cite, which will run commands, but which will only silence the citation notice for this single run.\nIf you use --will-cite in scripts to be run by others you are making it harder for others to see the citation notice. The development of GNU parallel is indirectly financed through citations, so if your users do not know they should cite then you are making it harder to finance development. However, if you pay 10000 EUR, you have done your part to finance future development and should feel free to use --will-cite in scripts.\n\nSo I won't add --will-cite flag in the script. Users will need to run parallel --citation by yourself in order to silence the citation notice.. @elParaguayo No need to apologize. I closed #288 too early. Thanks for your report. :). @actionless For now I've added a workaround only to the Nautilus specific .path-bar-box.background.frame, but\n\nsome other developer could put box.background widget to the headerbar in some other app\n\nI hope it won't happen because it should be avoided, maybe \ud83d\ude25. Good point. I was planning to fix this, but I postponed it because I was busy.\nThanks for your report, anyway.. \n@darcn181 With SCSS, we also need to fix the checked switch as well.\n\nMaybe it would be better to fix it by myself to make sure. But thank you for your help.. I'm sorry for the late reply.\n\nHey @nana-4 what program did you use that showed the switch in a row?\n\nI used gnome-control-center.\nAnd for future reference, I recommend you to use the GTK+ Inspector to find out where a specific widget is contained. (sorry if you already knew this.)\n\nHowever, I'm currently considering another solution for this (while making the theme closer to the current Material Design guidelines). So please wait until the solution is committed.\nAnyway thanks a lot for your help @PJSingh5000 @darcn181 :). > i want to see the new design you have in mind.\n@darcn181 Sorry I'm late. Here you are:\n\nThis is based on the refreshed Material Design guidelines: https://material.io/design/interaction/states.html#selected\n. Yes. Basically all selected items will have the transparency as per Material Design guidelines.. I've fixed this. Now you can try it from latest master branch :)\n(Though it still may need some refining...)\nClosing.. Thanks guys for your kind comments and feedback :)\n\nAnd you should fix the xfce panel, you can use .xfce4-panel or #XfcePanelWindow, buttons just need it's backgroud-color changed to transparent, like this\n\nIt is intentional. Only with the underline I thought it's hard to distinguish which task button is checked (at a glance), so I added the background-color.\n\n(It would be nice to see this treatment in all lists; I don't know if that is possible?)\n\nCode-wise, it's difficult or impossible, sadly :(\n\nI think there may be some unintended side-effects. For example, I selected text in this web page. The selected ext was highlighted in light blue. When I switched to another application, leaving the text highlighted, the highlight color turned black. Is this normal/expected?\n\nYeah, it's unintended behavior. We need some workarounds for web browsers...\n\nlooks weird sometimes though\nThe lower contrast between the text and the lighter highlighted background is a little hard on my eyes. For example, the blue-on-blue in Nautilus below, is hard to distinguish from two feet away; I did notice that it is not as bad in the example at material.io, because of the dark purple text they used. I think I need to use this new design little more to get used to it. :)\n\nYeah, I understand. I'm still not sure whether this is a matter of  getting used to it or color scheme issue. We'd need an observation period or some more feedback.... @darcn181 Ah, I see. I misunderstood. I thought you were talking about the background-color of the checked button, because in my environment xfce4-panel 4.13.3 (Xfce 4.12) looks like these:\nMateria/Materia-dark:\n\nMateria-light:\n\nWhat version of xfce4-panel are you using BTW?\nMateria still doesn't fully support Xfce even its GTK3 version. See #60 for details.. > Materia theme alters the color of the App Grid Icon.\n\nThis makes it impossible to use any icon, except the default \"grid of boxes\" icon.\n\nIt should be an expected behavior. The GNOME's icon doc describes:\n\nSymbolic icons have a simple form, and can be used much like text. The will be recolored according to the context in which they are used. By convention, symbolic icons are named with a -symbolic suffix.\n\nSo *-symbolic.svg can't have custom colors (except for specific warning, error and success classes). We cannot allow the use of such a custom colored symbolic icon, while supporting the regular symbolic icon.\nInstead, by editing your gnome-shell.css you can use the custom colored icon.\n\nMove your custom colored icon to ${THEME_DIR}/gnome-shell/assets directory.\nEdit ${THEME_DIR}/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css as follows:\n\n```diff\n .show-apps .show-apps-icon {\n-  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\n+  color: transparent;\n+  background-image: url(\"assets/view-app-grid-symbolic.svg\");\n+  background-size: contain;\n }\n.show-apps:hover .show-apps-icon,\n .show-apps:active .show-apps-icon,\n .show-apps:checked .show-apps-icon,\n .show-apps:focus .show-apps-icon {\n-  color: white;\n+  color: transparent;\n   transition-duration: 150ms;\n }\n```\n\nReload the theme.\n\nIt should look as you expected.\nAnyway I have no plan to use a custom App Grid Icon in this theme for now, so I'd like to close this as WONTFIX.. What is \"SELENIUM BASIC\"?\nWhat does \"CONTINUE\" mean?\nI can't understand at all what you are talking about.\nAnyway Materia is not supporting \"SELENIUM BASIC\", and won't support apps/projects that unrelated to GNOME/GTK+ theming.. > title-bars of non-CSD windows\nThat's defined with the .default-decoration style class:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/9d95a6112d27c52ca8d48fd8e80400453368c591/src/_sass/gtk/_common-3.20.scss#L1187-L1201\nTo reduce the padding, edit padding: $container_padding; (e.g. to padding: 2px;)\nIf you want to shrink its button as well, edit the two min-height: $small_size; and one min-width: $small_size;\nThen you'll need to reload GNOME Shell (Mutter) for non-CSD titlebars. Press Alt + F2 then type r.. So sorry for my late response. I didn't have time to properly investigate this and reply.\nI'm placing those white dots assets on the dock just for my aesthetic preferences, because I'm currently not satisfied with the custom indicators provided by dash-to-dock. So I personally don't want to remove the assets from the theme.\nThe best solution for me is to hide the Materia's white dots when using a custom indicator. But sadly, it seems there is no way to do it so far. So I decided to report it to dash-to-dock.\n\nThis never affected people who did not use dash-to-dock\n\nThat's right. The white dots are displayed only when using the \"dash-to-dock\" extension with Materia. Without the extension, just simple bottom borders are displayed as running dots, just like the upstream Adwaita.\nBy the way, this issue is actually a duplicate of #270, so please use it for tracking the issue.\nI'm closing this. Thanks for your report anyway.. Good point. :-) I'll fix it later. Thanks for the report.. Thanks for the report. It seems to be an upstream issue and can't be fixed by the theme.\nI've reported to the upstream: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dconf-editor/issues/7\n. Thanks for your report.\nHmm... This is very strange. I can't see any glitches in the Materia theme code at all. This may be rather a bug of GTK+ itself.\nAs a workaround, it is possible to disable transition of menu menuitem, but I don't feel like it because I'm liking the subtle transition of menuitem.\nFor now, I would like to add \"wontfix\" label and leave this issue open.. @ceyhunnabiyev Adapta and many other themes don't have transition (small animation) for menu-items. That's why.. Hi, thanks for your report. And sorry for the late reply.\n\nOk, first problem solved by ... a reboot :/\n\nRight, you need to reload Mutter to see the SSD (server-side decoration) title bar changes.\nFYI, you can reload it by pressing Alt + F2 and then typing r, without rebooting.\n\nStill the second issue remains.\n\nIt's a duplicate of #218:\n\nSEL_BG/SEL_FG not seperated from the panel and gnome shell internal colors, so currently it's not possible to set a bright SEL_BG with a dark SEL_FG\n\nSorry, but I don't have much time to research and fix it, so that problem still remains. So please consider setting a bright SEL_FG for now.\nAnyway I'd like to close this as a duplicate.. @ddnexus Thanks a lot for pointing it out! I've confirmed it and updated the wiki. :). @PJSingh5000 Sounds interesting. But I don't think it'll work well, because we need to replace /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource as well in order to change the GDM theme.\nHowever, if you confirm that it works well, please let me know.. @PJSingh5000 Thank you for your great research!\nWell, I tried your installation method on Ubuntu 18.10 VM, but unfortunately it doesn't work for me. :(\nMaybe I just made some mistake, but both default gnome-shell theme and GDM theme are still Yaru.\n\nHow about something like this?\nI think it is more elegant than overwriting files.\n\nI'm still not sure if I'd agree with it, even if I could successfully change the theme.\nI want to judge it after reviewing your script.\nWhen you refine your script, please note that the /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/gdm3.css is a Ubuntu specific file. Other distros don't have it. (IIRC, it is a file for Ubuntu to have a unique GDM theme.)\nAlso, can you implement a function to uninstall it completely in your script?\nFinally, I have a small concern about renaming /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource for security risks. What do you think about this?. Oh... I just noticed that Arch Linux doesn't provide update-alternatives package. See:\nhttps://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=update-alternatives\nand AUR too:\nhttps://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&SeB=nd&K=update-alternatives&outdated=&SB=n&SO=a&PP=50&do_Search=Go\nSo we shouldn't rely on update-alternatives. It's biased towards Debian/Ubuntu.\nIs it possible to achieve it without using update-alternatives?. > I do install gnome-session, and and then choose Gnome Session on the GDM screen.\nThat may be the part that you were missing when you tested?\nYes, I didn't install gnome-session on the VM. Maybe it is the cause. :)\n\nI'll investigate if there is a nice way to do this without update-alternatives, and I'll share if I come up with something and let you guys judge if it's worthwhile.\n\nThanks a lot!. > I ended up with two scripts. Please let me know what you think?\nIMHO, this seems too complicated to adopt within this repository. (Additional dependencies, complex method/steps, and support for other third-party themes...) And to be honest, it does not look much user-friendly than the current method.\nI think such extensive and complex method/scripts should be managed in another repository. (FYI, there is already a GDM theme manager in GUI called Loginized for similar purposes. Although I have never tried it.)\nEven though I appreciate your efforts and hard work, I can't adopt it. To adopt within this repository, it needs to be simpler and more user-friendly. Sorry.\n. Of course, we can link Loginized and/or your scripts' repository in our doc to introduce alternative methods, though.. @sxnaprkhr If you are talking about the button's foreground color, that's rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7).\n(and on hovering #FFFFFF). Thanks @torqueyy for your report.\nAnd also thanks @ArchangeGabriel for your investigation.\nAs @ArchangeGabriel points out, this Issue is visible with all themes (including Adwaita). So I would like to close this as an upstream Firefox Issue.. @m-thorsen Thanks, screenshots would be helpful.\nI'll reopen this if I could confirm that the issue still remains with Firefox 64+.. @m-thorsen Thanks for your tests & screenshots!\nLooks like the cause is that the drop shadow is not rounded.\nI'll investigate this.. After some tests, I concluded that this is still an upstream problem. It looks like the upstream devs tested only with Adwaita. Even with HighContrast theme, this problem exists:\n\n(HighContrast is one of the official GTK+ theme.)\nSince this problem happens even with the upstream official theme, I would like to close this as an upstream issue.\nP.S. This also happens with other third-party themes such as Arc.. Indeed, it sounds more clear to me. :). LGTM. Thanks a lot! \ud83c\udf89. LGTM. Thanks!. LGTM. Thanks a lot for your work, @smurphos! (And sorry for my late response.). @smurphos I have no objection, of course!\nIf you don't make big design changes from upstream, just \"Materia\" is OK for its name-space.\nI appreciate your help. Thanks in advance!. Thanks for the report. Unfortunately, it is difficult to fix this by the theme.\nI think this is rather a upstream GTK+ issue.. That solution will add ugly margins to all popover entry and popover button. So I can't adopt it.\nInstead, I might make all (or most) popover button flat. Since flat buttons don't have drop shadow, they'd look neat in popover. (Flattening of entry has already been completed in master branch.). Yeah, I know it's possible, but even that will give unwanted margins to unrelated buttons. For example:\n\n\nBut I think, yes, it's better.\n\n:+1: . Thanks for the report. \nUnfortunately, I cannot reproduce this because I have not installed GNOME on the touch devices.\nDoes anyone know how to show the selection widget on non-touch device?. @flipflop97 Wow, thank you so much!! I didn't know the feature despite I use the inspector every debugging the theme \ud83d\ude02. @monday15 Thanks for your help. Now I've addressed this issue :). Thanks for the report.\nThis is by design. In Material design, shadow is one of the most important points, but such panels tend to have no shadow.\nSee the Material Design guideline for example. Both Android status bar and navigation bar have no shadow. Chrome OS panel also has no shadow.\nTherefore, sorry but I won't add the shadow option for the panel, even if other third-party material themes have it.\nInstead, I highly recommend you set the \"Transparency\" option to \"Dynamic\":\n\nThis would look much Material-ish than adding shadows.. Wow, I had no idea what the cause of the bug is, so I really appreciate your PR! \ud83c\udf89\nHowever, CSS files should not be edited directly, as written in HACKING.md:\n\n\nDo not edit the CSS directly, edit the source SCSS files and run ./parse-sass.sh.\nYou'll need to have sassc installed.\n\n\nSo I committed this by myself. In future, please edit the source SCSS files and run ./parse-sass.sh instead :)\nAnyway, thanks a lot for your contribution!. Right, restyling of entry & button.combo is still WIP on master branch.... Thanks guys for your help. I've addressed this issue. Now you can try it out from latest master :) . Thanks for your report.\nI looked at the problem for a while, but it seems to be rather a bug of Electron.\nSee https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/15823.\n(Therefore it also occurs with Atom as well.)\nElectron doesn't seem to read the menubar > menuitem color of GTK+ theme properly, so we can't fix this by the theme, unfortunately.\n. Thanks for reporting the issue. However, this is a duplicate of #291.\nClosing.. Thanks for filing this issue.\nThe top border (highlight color) on headerbar should be a bug. I'll fix that.. > The header-bar and toolbar should have the same style\nI agree. In KDE, GTK+ toolbar, headerbar, and Qt toolbar should have the same style.\nI think you (@ripefig) are thinking something like this:\n\nHowever, in GNOME, the traditional toolbar looks like this with Materia:\n\nFor 3 reasons:\n\nGTK+ traditional toolbars tend to use full-color icons instead of symbolic icons. So the full-color icons may look a bit ugly with dark(er) titlebar background colors.\nIn GTK2 & GTK3 theming, it's impossible to add drop shadows to the traditional toolbar so far.\nIn Material Design guidelines, titlebar background color is never used for such toolbars. See some mockups from Material Design guidelines for example (A, B, C).\n\nSo I believe something like this should look more appropriate and clean in KDE:\n\nWhat do you think?\n/cc @varlesh @SmartFinn @PapirusDevelopmentTeam. > We use aurorae decoration.\nSorry, I don't understand \"aurorae decoration\" as I'm not familiar with KDE theming. Do you mean that the color of titlebar & toolbar are always linked in the aurorae decoration theme?\n\nI'm not understand what you want\n\nIn order to follow the Material Design guidelines as possible, I was thinking about changing the toolbar style like this:\n\nBut in Dolphin, indeed the current style may look better... I'll rethink about the style. Thank you for your response.. @varlesh OK, I understand. Thanks for your clarification!\nAs a side note: As shown in the Google's mockup I presented as an example, drop shadow is not always necessary in toolbar. And I think Materia GTK2 theme already looks like Material Design enough :wink: . Okay, I decided not to change both toolbar & headerbar style for now. The reason is as mentioned above. (Although I'll fix the \"top-border\" in the repo.)\n@ripefig So you'll need to change the style manually, if you want. Try pasting the following code to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css (or bottom line of /usr/share/themes/Materia-light-compact/gtk-3.20/gtk.css):\n```css\ntoolbar:not(.osd) {\n  background-color: #E0E0E0;\n  box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24); / not working /\n}\n.solid-csd headerbar {\n  box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24); / to get rid of highlight /\n}\n```\nNote: As I already mentioned, you wouldn't be able to add drop shadows to toolbar even with the code.. > The second flatted design means that both QT and GTK themes need to be changed.\nYes, I was intending it. (But it was abandoned now.)\n\nIt may also be a good idea to get rid of the double-title issue but making the the title text in the header invisible.\n\nI'm sure it's not theme issue, but upstream issue. Though you can locally get rid of the title text with this:\ncss\n.solid-csd headerbar .title { font-size: 0; }. Good for you :) Then I'm gonna close this.. I cannot reproduce this at all with any DEs (including KDE Plasma 5.14.3 that tested on VM).\nDoes this problem really happen only with Materia?\nWhat about other themes?. \n\nRecommendation: disable animations until they are fixed upstream.\n\nNo. LibreOffice buttons and treeview rows are always non-animatable. So I don't think it makes sense.\nBut you can locally disable GTK+ animations. Try this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false. > It happens with all the themes that highlight something on hover. Now that I recall, I've actually observed this on Gnome as well just under a year ago.\nSo, did you see this annotation when opening the ticket?\n\nBefore reporting a bug, please check whether it also occurs with the upstream default theme.\nIf the bug also occurs with the upstream default theme, it is very likely an upstream issue.\n\nIf it happens with all the themes, it's definitely not the theme issue. (Maybe it's likely your graphics driver issue, I guess.) Such a problem should be reported to the upstream (maybe Kubuntu?), not here...\nClosing.. > Is there any interest in creating telegram themes?\nPersonally, I'm not using the Telegram app.\nSo it would depend on how many people want to use the materia-telegram-theme.\nIf more :+1: are added to OP, of course the priority would be higher :). A note for myself: https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/wiki/Theme-Reference. Oops, I forgot to update it. Thanks for the report :). Oops, I forgot to update this as well :P\n(I was going to recheck it when the ongoing redesign work is done.)\nThanks for the PR!. Hi. How did you get Materia theme itself? Manually? Or from a distro package?\nIt seems you unexpectedly installed the 3.30 version of gnome-shell/gdm theme, even though your GNOME version is 3.28. I don't yet know why it happened.. Or maybe, did you install Materia before installing GNOME Shell? If so, it can be explained.\nIt's because the install.sh script detects your installed gnome-shell version then installs a proper version of gnome-shell theme. Otherwise, if you have not installed gnome-shell, it automatically installs the latest version of gnome-shell theme supported by Materia. Maybe that's the reason why you got the 3.30 version of gnome-shell/gdm theme in Materia.\nIn any case, this problem should be able to fix by re-installing Materia then re-installing its GDM theme.. Thanks for the info. Before telling to the maintainers of the distro, to make sure, please run the following commands and paste the logs:\ngnome-shell --version\ngrep -c barlevel /usr/share/themes/Materia-dark/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css\n\nEDIT: in /usr/share/gnome-shell/ I have two gresource file: gnome-shell-theme.gresource and gnome-shell-osk-layouts.gresource, is this a problem?\n\nIt is normal and should be no problem :) All distros have the two gresource files by default. . Thanks! As expected, 3.30 version seems to be installed which is incompatible with 3.28.\n\nIn the meanwhile, how can I solve this problem? Do I have to uninstall materia offered by the distribution and install from github?\n\nYup, that should solve this problem.. After investigation, I found that materia-gtk-theme*-20181115-7-1-x86_64.eopkg packages contain only 3.30 version of gnome-shell theme. So this problem should be specific to the Solus packages.\nCould you tell to the maintainers of the distro about it?. @babba22 Good news. Thank you for your report! So I'm gonna close this :). Hi. I think you are talking about elementary/Pantheon apps (as most of other GTK+ apps don't have the light/dark toggle).\nIn any case, having light theme variant while using dark theme is technically impossible. Not only Materia-dark, but also all GTK+ dark themes can't have the option.\nThis is why elementaryOS doesn't have a global dark theme and instead its apps have the switch theme option.... P.S.\n\nJust white labels isn't good\n\nIt should be another bug. And Materia doesn't officially support Pantheon at the moment. (See #69). LGTM :+1:  Many thanks for your PR and explanation :D. Thank you @actionless for the PR! And sorry for the late review.\nUnfortunately, I can see some errors with resvg 0.4:\n\nDouble scaling (--dpi 192) doesn't work to me. Only me? (--zoom 2 have worked in my case.)\nIntentional blank space is ignored. For example:\n\nby inkscape (24x24) | by rendersvg (12x14)\n  --- | ---\n   | \n\nGTK2 spinbuttons are broken:\n\nby inkscape | by rendersvg\n  --- | ---\n   | \nExcept for those, resvg 0.4 seems to work perfectly.\n. As an overall script issue, these scripts don't work at all when rendersvg doesn't exist (but inkscape and optipng exist).. Thanks for the fixes!\nBTW, are the resvg rendering errors I pointed out fixed with the resvg-git? (sorry, I have not tested with that.)\nIf they are not fixed, this PR may be a bit premature.... I tried resvg-git in Arch Linux and confirmed the problem with extra spacing has been fixed. And yes, the dpi problem has not been fixed yet.\n\ndpi i haven't tested yet\n\nYou can check it by comparing the sizes of foo.png and foo@2.png in ./src/gtk/assets :)\n\nif dpi not working yet -- i suggest adding a workaround with zoom so far before it will be fixed\n\n+1 :+1: Could you implement that, please?\n\nthe benefits of switching from inkscape are very high: not only generation time more than 5 times faster but also shipping Themix Materia Plugin in Flatpak will became possible\n\nIndeed. Since the remaining rendering problems are relatively small, I'd be happy to merge this (after some additional fixes) :)\nI'm gonna add some additional reviews I forgot to mention. Please also check it. (Sorry for the inconvenience.). Both packages (Debian and Ubuntu PPA) seem to have been updated to the latest version.\nThank you, guys!. LGTM, thank you!. Thanks for the report.\nI could reproduce it only when I increase the font scale.\nAre you using HiDPI display? In your screenshot, the font is pretty huge, but the theme itself seems not to be scaled.. > it's from my laptop, it have about 150 dots per inch, so it's not enough to use hidpi scaling, so gtk scaling is 1.0\nMaybe in such a situation, fractional scaling would be useful (though I'm not sure whether it works properly outside of GNOME).\n\nbtw most of the apps are looking quite fine in that setup, only with some panel buttons there is this oval problem\n\nPerhaps it's because there are text-buttons on the containers. In Materia, most buttons have 24px min-height as well as upstream Adwaita. Therefore, when the font line-height is over 24px, the button height will be changed accordingly. Similarly in Adwaita, the icon buttons would be transformed from square to rectangle.\nThis theme is not designed to be used with huge font size, so please consider using \"fractional scaling\" or smaller font size.. LGTM! Thanks!. Thanks!\nBTW, are you willing to become a \"collaborator\" of materia-theme?\nIf you become a collaborator, you can add such oomox-related commits without PR :)\nIf you don't mind, please become a collaborator from this link: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/invitations. LGTM! Thanks a lot! \ud83c\udf89. Unfortunately, adding the ripple animation to the Lollypop sidebar is impossible.\nNautilus sidebar has row which is animatable.\nOn the other hand, Lollypop sidebar has treeview.view  which is non-animatable.\nSee https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK/StyleClasses\nThis is because the CSS node conversion is not yet completed in GtkTreeView.\nIf the Lollypop sidebar gets to have row instead of treeview.view like Nautilus, it would have the ripple animation.. LGTM. Thanks!. It seems to work by adding the following code at the top of sed:\nbash\n      -e '/color-surface/{n;s/#FFFFFF/%MATERIA_SURFACE%/g}' \\\n      -e '/color-base/{n;s/#FFFFFF/%MATERIA_VIEW%/g}' \\\nMaybe it would be better to apply this to all color vars of assets.svg...\np.s. Just FYI, I'm going to change the design of gtk2 entries like gtk3 one.. I'll submit the fix, thanks :). Thanks for the suggestion. But I'm going to change the entry background in SVG when I properly redesigned the gtk2 entries :). @actionless I've committed the fix. Sorry for being a bit late.\n\nMaybe it would be better to apply this to all color vars of assets.svg\n\nI decided to do this after I review it more.. Since this is a Material Design theme and in order to follow the guidelines more accurately, I've changed the selection style based on the States guidelines on the master branch. Therefore it is intentional that change_colors.sh only supports the SEL_BG tag with no coverage of SEL_FG. Instead, you can change the selection opacity with MATERIA_SELECTION_OPACITY if you feel the default selection opacity (0.32) is too weak.\nSince this is a Material Design theme, can you try getting used to the semi-transparent selection background with no selection foreground change?\nFor better contrast of the selection text, I'd recommend to make FG darker (e.g. 212121):\n./change_color.sh -o Orchis <(echo -e \"BG=EFEFEF\\nFG=212121\\nHDR_BG=555555\\nHDR_FG=FFFFFF\\nMATERIA_VIEW=FFFFFF\\nMATERIA_SURFACE=FFFFFF\\nSEL_BG=A348B1\\nMATERIA_STYLE_COMPACT=False\\n\")\nWhat do you think?\n. Hi, thanks for reporting this.\nMateria is currently undergoing a large redesign based on the refreshed Material Design Guidelines on the master branch. So please note that there are design differences between the latest stable version (v20181125) and git development version, especially in entry, combo, and selection. In the preview of README.md, the stable version is (still) applied.\n\nButtons and other controls have different colors. In Materia all controls (buttons, combo, entry) are the same white color. When generating a theme with customer-colors, the buttons are colored based on the MATERIA_SURFACE color whereas the other controls use the $fill_color\nIn the generated theme the borders around entries and comboboxes are different then the borders around buttons which leads to some visual discrepancies.\n\nOn the master branch, entries and comboboxes have been redesigned based on the latest Text fields Guidelines. So it is intentional.\n\nAdditionally the hover effect over comboboxes looks noticeably worse then the buttons.\n\nI agree with that. I'm going to adjust the hover state style of the combobox to make it more noticeable.\n\nAlso notice the GTK3 widget factory with my generated theme and how a button next to an entry doesn't align with the entry (The fifth control down on the left, the entry with the X):\n\nI'd say it's an optical illusion. Here's x4 scaled screen capture (Please note that the entry has an inner border and the button has a drop shadow):\n\n. LGTM. Thanks a lot!. Hi,\nI think Materia is almost done upgrading to the refreshed Material Design (a.k.a. Material Design 2), especially in master branch.\nYou can try out the latest Materia according to the README.md#manual-installation.. @actionless I think you are rather a co-developer as you also frequently commit improvements in scripts and give various ideas for Materia :) Anyway thanks for your contribution!\n@vstyler96 Thanks! Github issues can be closed with the \"Close issue\" button at the bottom of the page :) Anyway I'm gonna close this.. @tliron Is that only in the terminal apps? Could you attach screenshot(s) to know exactly which/where font you are talking about?\n\nActually, looking closely it is not just Tilix, and it's not exactly bold. I just noticed it most there. It seems that everywhere Materia causes fonts to be heavier. Do you know what causes this?\n\nIf you are talking about buttons or tabs, it is intentional as in Material Design medium font weight (500) is used for them. See:\n\nhttps://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale\nhttps://material.io/design/components/buttons.html\nhttps://material.io/design/components/tabs.html\n\n\nIs there somewhere in the Materia theme CSS that I can change the weight?\n\nPlease search font-weight: 500; and try removing those lines.. Ah, I got it. It seems the terminal screen (VT widget?) don't understand or ignore the text alpha value.\nMateria uses rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87) as primary dark text color, so the text color is supposed to be displayed like #212121 on white background in RGB. However, in reality the text is displayed in #000000 (pure black) on that terminal screen.\nThis problem should really be fixed upstream, but I'll add a workaround for this. Thanks for your report.. @actionless \n\n@nana-4 btw what do you think about generating some terminal themes for Materia users? \n\nI think it's better to talk about it in #157, but I will keep that in mind. Thanks for the suggestion.. So sorry for my delay in responding.\nMy guess was wrong. At first I thought adding this will work:\ncss\nvte-terminal { color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); }\nIn fact, however, VTE's text color is hard-coded with @theme_fg_color. That means, it won't be changed unless we change the color of that variable. But for some reasons I don't want do that in this theme.\nSo, please manually edit the theme color variable (from rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87) to #212121, for example), or report to the upstream that  RGBA text color doesn't work.\nI'm gonna close this as an upstream issue.. Thanks for your suggestion!\nIt seems like a good solution to avoid manually re-applying the GDM theme on Arch Linux. I'll mention it in gnome-shell/README.md and let me use your hook file as an example :). Thanks for your report.\nThis is because elementaryOS Loki 0.4 uses GTK+ 3.18, whereas Materia v20181125 no longer supports GTK+ 3.18. (Materia has dropped support for GTK+ 3.18 after releasing v20180928.)\n@igor-dyatlov Could you please update the only xenial (Ubuntu 16.04) package to v20180928 to fix this? Or maybe, we should no longer introduce and maintain the package for Ubuntu 16.04. What do you think?. @igor-dyatlov Bump. Are you not interested in maintaining the PPA package anymore? If so, I'm going to stop introducing the outdated PPA from the README.. (Sorry for the late reply. I was inactive recently.)\n\nlatest version\ncurrent version\n\nWell, in this case that is the problem. The packages for Ubuntu 16.04 should not be updated to the latest version, because the current version of Materia doesn't support Ubuntu 16.04 and GTK 3.18.x anymore. (As described here, v20180928 is the last version to support GTK 3.18.)\nI mean, 20190201-5-0ubuntu1~xenial1 needs to be downgraded to 20180928-5-0ubuntu1~xenial1.. Thank you for your report. I confirmed this bug.. Thanks for the report.\nIndeed, with that color scheme, the selected text looks less readable. However, to be honest, I'm not very positive in changing the design itself because the design is in line with Material Design Guidelines.\nCould you try to increasing the lightness of the Selection Color and decrease the Selection Opacity with the Oomox GUI and test somehow it looks better?. Thanks for your report.\nThis should be a duplicate of #316.. Thanks for your report.\nThis seems to be caused by Builder shipping a half-broken progress bar. I tried to add a workaround somehow, but it didn\u2019t help.\nIf this is a problem for you, please report it to the upstream Builder. This cannot be fixed by the theme, unfortunately.. Hi,\nThis is intentional design based on the Material Design guidelines. It indicates a focus state, not an  active or hover state.\nFor example, in the screenshot below, it indicate that you can turn on the switch by pressing Enter key.\nFor your reference, Adwaita indicates the focus state with dashed outline, while Materia indicates it with the background-color changes.. Hi @varlesh, thanks for filing this.\nThis design direction is based on Material Design guidelines. To put it simply:\n\nThe \"Selected\" state style (blue translucent background without foreground color changes) is used for most selected items.\nThe \"Activated\" state style (blue translucent background with blue text color) is used for tab-like toggleable widgets.\n\nBut even with GTK3, due to technical limitations, it's hard or impossible to properly use different state style depending on the situation. (Only a few GTK3 apps (including Natuilus) properly use the \"Activated\" style so far.) So I think you can/should use the \"Selected\" state style for Qt apps.. @varlesh Thanks for your suggestion. There are two reasons why I adopted the \"Activated\" style:\n\nMateria's policy is to follow the Material Design guidelines as much as possible.\nOptimistically I hope the Activated style will be able to use more properly in the future with modern toolkits such as GTK & Qt.\n\nBut as you say, indeed using only \"Selected\" style as a workaround for consistency is an option worth considering. However, I want more feedback before doing that. After new release, if the new sidebar style is too unpopular, I'd like to consider removing the \"Activated\" style ;). @varlesh Can we close this now?. Thanks for your excellent work! They look fantastic :)\nHowever, I don't quite know where to use the logo, because this project is just a theme.\nPerhaps the only place where the logo can be used is README at the moment.\nI don't quite know about KDE theme, but at least I think there is no suitable place to insert this logo into GTK/GNOME/Budgie/Cinnamon/MATE/Unity themes.\nDo you have any idea where the logo can be used other than README?. Side note: If we'll use the logo in the README of this repository, it would be better to remove the \"GNOME\" :footprints:  logo because in this repo we also support Budgie/Cinnamon/MATE/Unity/etc as well.. @actionless Thanks for the information. I'm not sure if we can count the theme \"logo\" as an interface \"icon\", but it may be what we should consider.. > for recognition\nI see. That makes sense :bulb::+1: . @varlesh Yeah, GTK logo version would be more neutral than the GNOME logo version :smiley: However, I have some concerns/issues about its logo design:\n\nThe logo shape probably doesn't match any icon keyline shapes in the Material icon guidelines. I'd love to follow the Material icon guidelines as much as possible.\nThe small GTK logo and text (ATERiA) could be squished with smaller sizes (e.g. 48x48, 32x32).\n\nIn Materia, Red is not one of the main colors (though I can understand why you picked the color, from the viewpoint of aesthetic).. For the sake of argument, I made some logos based on the Material icon guidelines:\n\n\nHorizontal rectangle shape (with subtle text?) like the design by @varlesh.\n\n\n\n\nAnother horizontal rectangle shape.\n\n\n\nCircle shape (as @Ghostium suggested \ud83d\ude42).\n\n\nI'm an amateur of icon making, so maybe there is room for improvement on these logos.\nAny thoughts / ideas?. > why you both @varlesh and @nana-4 prefer to use envelope for the theme, which is far away from sending mails?\n\nwhat about trying to portray word \"matter\" but in material design style\n\nI said I'd love to follow the Material icon guidelines as much as possible (because this theme is totally based on Material Design guidelines). According to the icon guidelines:\n\nThe tactile and physical quality of Material is reflected in the design of Material icons. Each icon is cut, folded, and lit as paper would be, but represented by simple graphic elements. The quality of Material is sturdy, with clean folds and crisp edges. Surfaces interact with light through subtle highlights and consistent shadows.\n\nBut I agree that my idea 1. looks too Gmail.\n. > why you both @varlesh and @nana-4 prefer to use envelope for the theme, which is far away from sending mails?\nIt's because Mateira encloses themes for various DEs :)\nHowever, my most favorite so far is my No. 3.. > Because moctly sites used white page and colors merged\nI personally don't think that's a matter, because in Material Design, shadows are used as borders :)\nFor comparison, however, I made dark variations as well.\n\nEDIT: Original source SVG is here.\n. @actionless Personally... disagree. They have different concepts (\"M\" inside circle vs. envelope) and different keyline shapes (circle vs. horizontal rectangle).. @varlesh Looks interesting \ud83e\uddd0 My only concern is that it may slightly deviate from the keyline shape of the guidelines.. @actionless  Logos are symbol, so it is not necessarily needed that the letter M looks natural :)\nFYI, these are the official Material Design logos:\n\n\n. After some testing and reviewing, I decided to go with this logo design because:\n\nIt passes the Material icon guidelines completely.\nIt looks the most modern among the candidates to me.\nIt is somewhat similar (but not exactly the same) to the official Material Design logo.\n\nSo I'm going to close this issue. Thank you all for your participation and feedback!. Thanks for your report.\nI've fixed the ellipse slider and unnecessary on/off icons with the commit above. However,\n\nselection circle and shadow are cut off\n\nSadly we can't fix it by the theme :( It seems to be caused by GTK 3.24.4 breaking theme compatibility.... I've reported it to the upstream: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/1631\nI'm gonna close this as an upstream issue.. Sorry for the late reply.\nCould you attach an screenshot (top bar + any window on your current color scheme) for clarify the issue?\nI need more information to find out what you exactly want, or if it is possible.. Thanks for filling the issue. In dark variant, indeed that contrast isn't very good.\nI'll try to deal with it somehow.. @SmartFinn Wow, I didn't notice that issue. However, in my opinion it is:\n\na relatively minor problem in Materia.\nrather an upstream issue in the old icon view (related bug report).\na resolved problem in the new icon view (try gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences use-experimental-views true):\n\n\n. Hello,\nActually that is a :focus state, not a bug.\nI recommend you read the following Material Design Guidelines:\n\nhttps://material.io/design/interaction/states.html#focus\nhttps://material.io/design/components/selection-controls.html#checkboxes\n\nClosing.. See: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/294#issuecomment-429509138 :). See the original (generated) CSS:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/db26c9915c544121637b97f6a3d90eb07e11fec4/src/gtk/3.0/gtk-dark-compact.css#L1414-L1419\nSince your CSS file is missing the additional .titlebar:not(headerbar) and headerbar, it doesn't override the style of the @import source CSS. So try as follows:\n```css\n@import url(\"/usr/share/themes/Materia-dark-compact/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\");\n.default-decoration.titlebar:not(headerbar),\nheaderbar.default-decoration {\n  min-height: 0px;\n  padding: 0px;\n}\n```\nand don't forget to reload GNOME Shell. SSD title bar is somewhat special :). Thanks for your report.\nWe already had the Firefox-specific styling, but there was a bug in the entry, so I've fixed it.. Thanks for the report! I wasn't aware of the option \ud83d\ude05\nI've fixed this problem by making the panel button always flat.. I can reproduce this even with the upstream Adwaita-dark. Which means it is not a Materia-specific bug.\nBefore reporting a bug, please, read the issue template and check if it also occurs with the upstream theme. (In this case the upstream theme is \"Adwaita-dark\".)\nI believe this is a bug on Chrome side, and I don't think it can be fixed on the theme side. So I'm going to close this as an upstream issue.. Thanks for the report.\nThis is an upstream bug, and unfortunately cannot be fixed on the theme side :(\nCan you report this to the upstream?. @flipflop97 Thanks a lot!. This is by design, not a bug. While the 1px black underline indicates the hover state (button.combo:hover), the 2px blue underline indicates the focus state (entry:focus). (Please note that in GTK3, GtkEntry can't have hover state.)\nBut yeah, I agree the current hover style isn't very good. Also it's a bit outdated, according to the current Material Design Guidelines:\n\nI'll update the hover style of the combo button soon :D. Done with 5d216a75f590948b9c1e5468bbde296c232f27e9.\nIf you still prefer the colored underline when hovering (to me, it doesn't make sense though :P), you can do it by replacing _common-3.20.scss#L951 from\nscss\n&:hover { background-image: image($overlay-hover); }\nto \nscss\n&:hover { @include entry(focus); }. I prefer /usr/share/themes rather than $HOME/.themes for default destination directory.\nFor example, if you install Materia in $HOME/.themes then run sudo nautilus, nautilus doesn't appear with Materia. Instead, nautilus appears with Adwaita.\nAlso I think THEMES_DIR is more preferable for the name.. Maybe --dest is more preferable?. Typo around here: ./materia -> ./materia.sh. \"--primary\" \"Change assets color-primary\" is missing, I guess. (The default color is blue.). This will fail if you try to install the theme with the development version of GNOME. (e.g. 3.25, 3.27, etc.) Because this theme doesn't have such a 3.25 dir. Please see 41195e3e46cbbe1eb8cff79be42269bab3aad00e for details.. Typo? We using sassc command, not sass.. Same as above.. Here is also sassc, not sass.\nAlso, gtk-dark.css needs to be installed, except for -dark variant.. Typo: 0.78 -> 0.87. This will also move scalable/ dir in the assets/ dir. scalable/ dir must to be installed, but the new assets/ dir misses it.. ./materia.sh render-assets seems doesn't work. But ./materia.sh render-assets --gtk2 and ./materia.sh render-assets --gtk3 are working. I guess something like this is needed:\n\"\")\n                 render_assets \"gtk2\"\n                 render_assets \"gtk3\"\n                 shift\n                 ;;. Typo: 90&192 -> 96&192. My English is also not so good. :)\nbut I think with or using is correct (or better) in this case (because oomox is an external tool for materia-theme).\nCan you update this to use with?. @actionless Don't worry, I won't add $material_radius into ./src/_sass/gnome-shell/_variables.scss :smile: But thanks for your review!\n(src/_sass/gnome-shell/_variables.scss is mainly intended to override some variables in ./src/_sass/_variables.scss for unavoidable reasons, so I might have to rename it something like to _overrides.scss...). @2 is missing after $i.. Why is this needed?. Ah, sorry. I was going to tell it to you, but I'm going to drop the (teal) accent/secondary color on the next release (in order to follow the Material Design guidelines more accurately). So the blue check and radio are intentional.\nWould you mind removing ACCENT_BG and the option in Oomox eventually? IIRC, that is only used for Materia-based theme. I think specifying only SEL_BG as an accent color is also good thing for compatibility with other oomox themes.. The DPI option for chrome is not only unnecessary, but also should not have. In other words, 16 size icon should always be 16x16, never be 32x32.\nCould you please remove the DPI option from the chrome script?. > it's used not only in Materia theme\nAh, right, sorry for my misunderstanding.\n\nso, should i remove Accent option from Materia plugin completely?\n\nHmm, yes, please. :pray: \n(Considering the Material Design guidelines, I think it's better. Also since changing the color of specific SVG assets/ID to ACCENT_BG is quite difficult now.). To be honest, I'm not sure if this is OK, because $surface_color is used not only for buttons, but also for menus, popovers, popup dialogs, etc. (Just FYI, I'm also considering consolidating $base_color and $surface_color eventually as per Material Design guidelines.)\nWhat do you think about this? If you are OK, I would not oppose this change.. In Material Design, filled text fields have a translucent background color derived from text color. I think this shouldn't be changed to %TXT_BG%.\n(See https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html for details.)\nCan you undo the changes?. > i've read the article and i think your design decision could be conflicting with the following requirement: Don\u2019t design text fields to look similar to buttons, as they could be mistaken for buttons.\nPersonally I don't have the concern, because buttons never have the 1px grey underline + square bottom corners + fill. In the \"Don\u2019t\" example in the article, underline can not be seen.\n\nand currently both button and inputs are using fill_color\n\nYes, but $fill_color is only used for the disabled raised button, not for other types of button.\n\ni think the best option will be if you define in _colors.scss just names of the elements (button, input, checkbox, whatever) and next just set them as needed, let's say $button_bg = $fill_color and so on, that will allow to override any element without affecting others\n\nI also had that idea, but now I'm wondering if we really need to do that because the baseline Material color theme is composed only in a few colors. For example, there is such a description:\n\nSurface colors affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus.. > (the issue is quite observable since disabled button is often used in UIs, for example in GtkFileChooser unless some file is chosen)\n\nHm... I'd say people never mistake a disabled button for an entry, because disabled button doesn't have the underline and square bottom corners, which entry has.\nEven if this is still an issue, I'd say this is rather an upstream Material Design issue, because entry and disabled button have such styles in that design.\n\ni think such change won't contradict to the guidelines, since the result will be same. It's more about abstraction level:\napart from being recoloring-friendly having widgets colors defined explicitly will make it more clearly defined which widgets have which colors without guessing or grep-ing\n\nI can understand it, but in reality, it requires a larger amount of work, for example:\nscss\nwidgets' scss:\ncard {\n  background: $card_bg;\n  color: $card_fg;\n  :disabled { color: $card_disabled_fg; }\n  .hint-text { color: $card_secondary_fg; }\n  .track { background: $card_track; }\n  .divider { background: $card_divider; }\n  entry, button:disabled { background: $card_fill; }\n}\nsheet {\n  background: $sheet_bg;\n  color: $sheet_fg;\n  :disabled { color: $sheet_disabled_fg; }\n  .hint-text { color: $sheet_secondary_fg; }\n  .track { background: $sheet_track; }\n  .divider { background: $sheet_divider; }\n  entry, button:disabled { background: $sheet_fill; }\n}\nmenu {\n  background: $menu_bg;\n  color: $menu_fg;\n  :disabled { color: $menu_disabled_fg; }\n  .hint-text { color: $menu_secondary_fg; }\n  .track { background: $menu_track; }\n  .divider { background: $menu_divider; }\n  entry, button:disabled { background: $menu_fill; }\n}\nEspecially, gnome-shell CSS and cinnamon CSS are quite complicated, so that refactoring is never easy for me.\nAlso I'm wondering even if oomox users really want to recolor widgets in detail with Materia. As far as I know, most of the people who customize Materia change only basic colors such as accent color, titlebar color, and HSV of whole background colors. (For instance, a person who want to change only the button to \"dark\" and leave the rest \"light\" is pretty rare with Materia-based theme, I guess.) Since people who use Materia-based theme are supposed to be more or less fans of Material Design, can't we bind them to the guidelines to some extent? (i.e. Drop button only recolor option & menu only recolor option from Materia style in Oomox). Just to clarify, I share my idea of all the ideal Oomox recolor options for Materia:\n\nBackground (refer to BG)\nText (refer to FG)\nSurface (e.g. Buttons, Menus, Popovers) (refer to BTN_BG)\nView (refer to TXT_BG)\nTitlebar Background (refer to MENU_BG)\nTitlebar Text (refer to MENU_FG)\n? Error (This may be unnecessary.)\nAccent (refer to SEL_BG)\nSelection Opacity (default value: 0.32)\nTranslucent Panel Opacity (refer to GNOME_SHELL_PANEL_OPACITY). > reverted one of revert commits :) please let me know if it's fine now\n\nLGTM! Thanks a lot!\n\nalso side note, for Error, Warning, Info themix gui using Red, Yellow and Blue terminal colors accordingly, mb to make it clear i will rename \"Red\" into \"Red (error)\" and so on, what do you think?\n\nAs a temporary fix, I think it's fine. Or maybe \"Red/Error color for Theme\" sounds more clear (because users usually don't know the error color option is there. If the description is \"Red (error)\", users are likely to think that \"Red\" means \"error color at Terminal\").\nHowever, what do you think about separating it into Theme \"Error\" option and Terminal \"Red\" option, and so on? Because in the current status:\n\nIn many cases, these options are hidden in the GUI. \nUsers are hard to notice that the \"Theme\" color options are in the \"Terminal\" section.\nSome users may not want \"Theme Error color\" and \"Terminal Red color\" to have the same color.\n\nAs some themix variables have default values, applying the theme's default error/warning/info colors to the default value of those variables may be good for users and for ease of implementation.. > however i am not sure those options are so common to be fine-tuned to extend already big list of theme options (btw in GUI suggestions topic it would be good to discuss how better to split that list into some tabs or expanders to make it easier to navigate)\nIndeed. So let's discuss it later on that topic :)\n\nalso tonight i will change the list of available options in Materia Themix plugin as you suggested in #329 (comment), after that i suggest you playing with it a bit to see if theme preview and generation are happening as you expect them to happen\n\nThanks for accepting my proposal :) Yes, I'd like to try it.. Great job! BTW, are you planning to change the descriptions and reorder the options as https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/pull/329#discussion_r242819290 on the Materia theme style?\nFor example, in Materia, the description \"Menu/toolbar background\" is incorrect. That option only changes headerbar/titlebar/menubar, never changes menu/toolbar.. Also in my opinion, \"Selection Opacity\" and \"Translucent Panel Opacity\" are rather \"Color options\", not \"Other option\". Is it possible to reorder them to the bottom of the \"color section\"?. Why is ./ necessary only for this? shellcheck does not seem to give warning even without it.. I see. I just wondered why this is only in src/chrome but not in src/gtk and src/gtk-2.0 :). ",

Maybe I need to get used to it. :)\n. well, you get used to it. I like it fancy. But this one is maybe a little too much. :) The blue (turquoise) accent color does fit very good. Instead the pinkish one, we could use something from the \"teal\" or \"deep-orange\" palette?

now with implementing your desired terminal colorscheme for Xresources only (xrdb is being used by such popular terminal emulators as xterm and urxvt but also less-known xst)\nlater, then support for more terminals will be implemented in oomox, your terminal theme became available for others, like gnome-terminal. > so far it exports it only in Xresources format\n\nlater on i am planning to

https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/342#issuecomment-454519038\nlet's discuss the next plans. @nana-4 sorry for offtopic but i've read the updated material design guide and it seems what now they have a slightly different buttons design: https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html\non topic: i think for window decorations it's reasonable to stick with chrome os style, which on the screenshots seems to be similar to current materia borders' rounding. also idk if Android-x86 could be referred (since it's not an official google project), but they also have square decorations:\n. also speaking of new material design and rounding -- it seems what for \"main\" windows it stay with square corners however for popups/dialogs they now have big rounding as in buttons. also i was thinking, mb to make overall theme roundness configurable via ./change-color.sh, the same as in Numix-based change-color.sh script?. for that instead of using hardcoded roundness in-place, you could define some kind of roundness multiplier in _colors.sass and use it in every border-radius definition . you can edit the colors with this app:\nhttps://github.com/actionless/oomox\nhowever if you're using ubuntu you need to know what PPA version could be out-of-date. it's breaking functionality of pseudo-hidpi gtk2 generation:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/gtk-2.0/render-asset.sh#L12-L17\nalso ./materia install is seems to be missing the flow of ./change_color.sh -- to install a theme variant with specified colors into a custom location (ie smth like ./materia install --size compact --fg #000 --accent #f00 -o ~/.themes/mytheme). also, to rephrase/append_to my previous comment:\ni would recommend you to try using ./change_color.sh with few different color values to see the expected result of it.\nyou can also use oomox app to get more colorschemes for testing:\nhttps://github.com/actionless/oomox/tree/master/colors\nso, i think that's quite important for your refactored script version to still produce the same resulting gtk theme as the one generated with ./change_color.sh script when running with the same colors\nUPD: also let me know if you'll add more new options like transparency or smth else -- in that case i can also expose those options to the theme-generation GUI. i've fixed it like that: https://github.com/actionless/oomox-archdroid-icon-theme/commit/86ff3f5efab95a3b3f755163a6e36be4e9aa25cf. in 2.42.0 it seems still unfixed. also i see stuff wasn't merged properly, for example diff to change_color.sh is the same as latest commits to master branch but being added as new commits (and the same i see with at least xfce theme and svg assets)\nsh\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\nshould solve that. i think later on instead of using sed to transform current _colors.scss into template it could be better to ship both _colors.scss and _colors.scss.template. ok, i'll do that soon. if rendering became any better when fixing the IDs? https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/246. could you try once again with resvg 0.4?\ni've just tried a test rendering and didn't found any observable issues. have you tried using ./change-color.sh script from the root of materia repo to achieve the same result?. what exactly is not good? mb you can improve it in change-color.sh script instead of creating a new one?\nalso in the near future instead of sed-ing _colors.css i am planning to include _colors.css.template which should be more robust approach. if you're thinking of somehting similar together we can achieve faster and better result. that's to leave some space for future speed-improvements? :-)\nhttps://github.com/DarthWound/erdlowe-theme/blob/cdc5577e3b5c15ce8de1a88c33bc2a4f18e23d85/source/materia-to-erdlowe.sh#L16-L25. you can try sync mb instead of sleep. i am always using a similar workaroung with dark themes as in the last comment so i think the only thing can be done is adding this topic to FAQ. actually i've took a look on it now, it seems to be easier than i 've expected so i can submit it right now\nhowever on metacity/gtk2 themes and all svg assets that replacement will still rely on the colors, so i still thinking how it will be better to address the 'migration' for them. (that was so easy thanks to your recent changes where you made one global scss for all the themes, good work on that!). so, any ideas about migration of non-scss themes and svg assets?. i hope that should help to perform that migration manually:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/pull/212. because now the replacement palette is very small:\necho \"== Converting theme into template...\"\nfor FILEPATH in \"${PATHLIST[@]}\"; do\n    find \"${FILEPATH}\" -type f -exec sed -i'' \\\n        -e 's/#000000/%FG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#212121/%FG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#757575/%INACTIVE_FG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#9E9E9E/%INACTIVE_FG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#c3c8ca/%INACTIVE_FG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#BDBDBD/%MENU_BG2%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#E0E0E0/%SEL_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#F5F5F5/%BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#FAFAFA/%BTN_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#FF4081/%ACCENT_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#42A5F5/%SEL_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#FFFFFF/%TXT_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#333e43/%MENU_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#455A64/%MENU_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#37474F/%MENU_BG%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#3b484e/%MENU_BG2%/g' \\\n        -e 's/#414f56/%MENU_BG3%/g' \\\n        -e 's/Materia/%OUTPUT_THEME_NAME%/g' \\\n        {} \\; ;\ndone\n. could you also update the replacement palette during the migration?. these lines: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/change_color.sh#L140-L156. thanks in advance!. it seems something is not right after the update:\n```\n== Converting theme into template...\n== Filling the template with the new colorscheme...\n== Generating the CSS...\nError: Undefined variable: \"$tooltip-bg-color\".\n        on line 2056 of src/_sass/gtk/_common-3.18.scss\n\n\nbackground-color: rgba($tooltip_bg_color, $higher_opacity);\n\n---------------------------^\n``. thanks a lot! it works again as good as before, there are only minor issues, but i've created a separate ticket for that:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/216. see this thread: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/210. yup, that SEL_FG there is almost a random value\nhowever BTN_FG will be the same random value unless we sure what the underlying surface is using BTN_BG\nalso i am not sure whatrgba()thing would work good for all-dark colorschemes -- i think it would be better to usemix()` instead\n\n\nIf you want to add your colorscheme you can do it here:\nhttps://github.com/actionless/oomox/tree/master/colors. if we are speaking of panel then usually MENU_BG and MENU_FG pair is used instead of BG/FG. > @actionless Is it possible to add variables like %DARK_FG% and %LIGHT_FG%?\nthe point of those variables what they all are paired (like FG/BG, BTN_FG/BTN_BG)\nthat allows to rely on readability of the text over the underlying color\nso, as i mentioned before, we need to investigate which color is used a a background there and take a foreground color from that pair. also when writing an abstract theme definition (ie that _colors.scss.template about which we are talking about) you can't talk about light or dark colors at all, always think of them as of mixed with others/with alpha component (which is actually the same, but just mixing algorhithm appear to be different). > BTW could you explain the meaning of the GTK_GENERATE_DARK_THEME value? \nin oomox-gtk-theme it used to generate two gtk.css and gtk-dark.css and i remember i was trying to make it work in my initial color-changer implementation for Materia. however i don't know if it works as expected now\nin gtk3-widget-factory you can see that dark theme with Use dark theme switch. @nana-4 after your explanation i see the point, in oomox i was solving such problems with a special scss function:\nhttps://github.com/actionless/oomox-gtk-theme/blob/master/src/gtk-3.20/scss/_functions.scss#L112-L118\nthe idea is what you just taking a color pair (let's say BTN_BG and BTN_FG) and probing which of them will be more contrast to some specific color (in this case \u2014 to gnome-shell's shade). re: potential fixes:\n1) i've supplied an scss function for choosing most contrast color above, feel free to use it for implementing this, i recommend to use MENU_BG and MENU_FG to choose from (i am using only gtk2 and gtk3 themes, but not gnome so can't test this)\n2) MATERIA_MENUBAR_STYLE was a hack to hide the problems with inaccurate sed-ing of the theme. it was disabled in the color_changer script after sed expressions were improved and not needed now for sure because of implementing _colors.scss.template. i think you just found some leftovers which i forgot to remove.\n2.1) GTK_GENERATE_DARK_THEME i've already explained before, it not related to how the theme itself look, but it just defines if second gtk-dark.css will be generated or not. however since, as i also mentioned before, there is no such term as 'dark' or 'light' when we are talking about dynamic colorschemes that actually means not 'dark' but 'using colors from the menubar for normal background as well'. >But if you want that the darker themes look as good as the lighter themes, we will provide a variable MATERIA_COLOR_VARIANT which defaults to light but can be set to dark to make darker colored themes prettier\nmb for this we can check $BG color with is_dark function and set it automatically?. yes, you right. btw here is is_dark implementation in bash to use in change_color.sh script:\nhttps://github.com/actionless/oomox-gtk-theme/blob/master/scripts/is_dark.sh. can reproduce the same on Arch GTK 3.22.26-1. @DarthWound is there any reason why it should be preferred over change_color.sh script from the materia repo itself?. @robotmaxtron \n\nI miss the pink\n\nprevious version of materia colors is archived in this palette:\nhttps://github.com/actionless/oomox/blob/master/colors/modern/materia\nyou can apply it with change_color.sh script or with oomox\nlater the palette will be renamed to materia_old and the current one will be added there. i still suggest instead contribute into solving the common problems as part of materia theme development:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/218 instead of spreading effort on doing a similar project wherever you found it competitive or not.\nHaving a stable color-changing 'base' in the materia theme itself will help to reduce the code of your  script into 2 lines of code:\nbash\ntheme=\"SEL_BG=$1\\nACCENT_BG=$1\\n....\" # next are just default materia colors\n./change_color.sh <(echo -e $theme). @Rfvgyhn see here:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/224#issuecomment-377725063\nhttps://github.com/themix-project/oomox/tree/master/colors/modern. In commit history, I guess ;)\nIf you\u2019ll invest time on that, please also post here, so I will include that preset as \u2018materia-old-dark\u2019. The file whose history you need is github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/src/_sass/_colors.scss. looks good! are you going to also implement automatic dark/light detection?. yup, if env var is set \u2014 don't attempt to do any autochoices\ni think while nana-4 is not around to merge it now you can also add that as well to make this feature more complete. thanks!\ni did some testing, light theme looks fine from the first glance but the dark one have problem with dropdowns:\n\n. I've tested on 5cbbd38d1c0b6b0f4ef4fac7728156605c377f63 with this theme https://github.com/actionless/oomox/blob/master/colors/gnome-colors/shiki-noble-dark-materia. like that:\nbash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actionless/oomox/master/colors/gnome-colors/shiki-noble-dark-materia\n./change_color.sh --hidpi True ./shiki-noble-dark-materia\nMb you are using different GTK+3 version? Mine is 3.22.26. also please compare the same theme generated\nwith light MATERIA_COLOR_VARIANT:\n\nand the dark one:\n\nExcept for issue with dropdowns i also see in the dark the problem with StackSwitcher buttons underline color.\nAt the same time the only difference i see is the borders cointrast in Inset/Outset/Groove/Ridge frames and other similar separators.\nMb we can just choose the color of the frame based on background color instead of having 2 theme versions? (also that's subjective but i like more how those borders are looking in the \"light\" variant). also check mb you have some debugging code left in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css. also i think you'll have to test more on gnome themes which have dark MENU_BG but light BG and light MENU_BG but dark BG\ni think to resolve those edge cases you'll have to end up with that scss function for choosing contrast color. i can actually reproduce it on 2 different machines (one with 3.22.26 and other 3.22.28, both Arch). i've double-checked my testcase, that's not a rendering issue, in the resulting css i actually see FG and BG are the same:\n```css\n.popup:not(.csd) menu menuitem {\n  color: #4c4c4c;\n}\n.popup:not(.csd) menu menuitem:hover {\n  background-color: #4c4c4c;\n}\n.popup:not(.csd) menu menuitem:disabled {\n  color: #4c4c4c;\n}\n```. also i was rethinking the combination of the problem which you are trying to solve (to have different border ratios for dark and light themes) and approach you've chosen (to use two base \"sub-templates\"), and i think it can be optimized:\nin _colors.scss.template instead of checking which theme subtemplate we are using (if($variant == 'light',,)) to actually check the color of the underlying surface:\n1) simple example: $my_fg = if(lightness($menu_bg) > 50, $menu_bg, $menu_fg)\n2) more sophisticated example: \nscss\n$light_menu = if(lightness($menu_bg) > 50, $menu_bg, $menu_fg);\n$dark_menu = if(lightness($menu_bg) <= 50, $menu_bg, $menu_fg);\n$my_fg = if(lightness($my_bg) > 50, $dark_menu, $light_menu)\nthat will give us a reliable source of determining the right color combination instead of blindly guessing. @nana-4 nope, i was running the branch without any modifications. is that gtk2? can it be reproduced in some common application, not a settings app from your DE?. i am usually using awf-gtk2. i can see if it can be installed without installing lots of xfce deps, btw have you tried debugging it with gtk2-parasite?. in a lighter theme it doesn't look fine neither, i think just one color is missing to be replaced in change_color.sh\n\n. #F5F5F5 in the light theme and #292929 in the dark one. gtk2 looks fixed now!\nhowever noticed a regression in dropdown highlight color, before it was:\n\nand with your latest changeset it became:\n\n. @nana-4, is that an intended look?\nif so \u2014 i think we done with the first part of the PR\nnext one will be handling the sidecases as described here: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/pull/222#issuecomment-375759454. i think it's fine for this portion of changes :+1: . thank you both!. just noticed a problem with GTK+2, on menu FG is used instead of MENU_FG:\n\n. it was there before your PR but just amended to this discussion not to create a separate ticket for this. @smurphos you can check also the other related conversation, i personally prefer scss function to choose contrast color instead of having 3 theme variants\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/pull/222#issuecomment-375759454\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/218#issuecomment-374981567. for fedora oomox GUI tool is avalaible in COPR to configure the Materia:\nhttps://github.com/actionless/oomox/#centos-fedora-mageia. @n3oxmind that won't change the color of image assets (for example, checkboxes) -- you need to use change_color.sh script to really change the palette of the theme. try to change radiobuttons(A-Z, Z-A, ...) to some different color without rendering assets. to see the difference you need to actually change it with change_color script as suggested above :-). also if you're colorblind you can use compare tool from imagemagick suite to compare images technically (or use something less sophisticated as gpick). https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/224#issuecomment-376370193. @nnnn20430 wo-wo, don't be so intimidating, please :-). Finally added all the Materia theme templates:\n\n\n\n\n\n. in example in readme it's quoted. using oomox gui is even easier and actually no typing since you don't need to enter the command in the terminal ;). i think after few more iterations of improving it you could propose it upstream, since the theme is very configurable so they could shape/color it whatever they want by default. as a side point i would also add what currently on arch both gtk4 AUR packages are indeed building however none of demo apps is starting fine, in such situation it's quite hard doing even any early adopting/research (i was attempting to do it for oomox gtk theme recently). do you have the same behavior with change_color.sh script?. it's most probably MENU_BG, but you need to feed full palette to the command, not only one color\nyou could also try oomox to choose colors in a gui. np, i was actually worried for you, mb you lost your credentials or something worse :D  . @ArchangeGabriel try using font where the difference between regular and bold characters will be more noticeable, it's not something to be fixed in gtk theme (since Thunderbird not using GTK+3 theme directly but doing some magic to get the GTK+3 theme parameters/colors from StyleContext and using few other hacks). is there any theme in which that addressbar is colored differently? i am feeling like its color is hardcoded. @nana-4 , just small sidenote, if you'll be changing any of default colors please also update them here:\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/blob/master/change_color.sh#L181-L220 (mb that note should be also added to HACKING.md?). please file a PR. i think by \"publication\" it was meant \"publication of scientific research in magazine\" but idk for sure. especially since word \"citing\" was used\nbut if you still think what gtk theme could be counted as that kind of publication -- you can \"cite\" parallel authorship in the end of authors section. mb with the time we'll refactor render-assets as a make destination :-) (which implies parallelism by default for processing multiple targets within one destination). > It definitively is Nautilus 3.30.1 that changed that\nin Oomox and Arc it still looks fine in dark colors:\n\n\nso i think there is just some extra style in materia which affecting this. however i found out what nautilus is using for path labels header button fg color instead of headerbar fg color:\n(should be white as window control buttons, but it's black as on normal headerbar buttons)\n\nUPD: seems the latter is because oomox is missing headerbar button.flat style. my bad, the main issue is reproducible only with maximized window. maximized issue could be fixed by adding:\nscss\nheaderbar {\n  .background {\n    background-color: $headerbar_bg;\n  }\n}. because if they will fix it in nautilus, some other developer could put box.background widget to the headerbar in some other app. it's dark gray . why can't you use color picker?. updated. cc @smurphos . i think by material design guidelines bottom panel shouldn't have any shadows (the \"light\" is coming down from the top). dup: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/317. in arch linux test with resvg-git, it's newer than 0.4. > As an overall script issue, these scripts don't work at all when rendersvg doesn't exist (but inkscape and optipng exist).\nthis i also fixed. problems with extra spacing should be fixed, dpi i haven't tested yet. if dpi not working yet -- i suggest adding a workaround with zoom so far before it will be fixed\nthe benefits of switching from inkscape are very high: not only generation time more than 5 times faster but also shipping Themix Materia Plugin in Flatpak will became possible. thanks for checking, i'll address them later today. it's from my laptop, it have about 150 dots per inch, so it's not enough to use hidpi scaling, so gtk scaling is 1.0\nbtw most of the apps are looking quite fine in that setup, only with some panel buttons there is this oval problem. i'll make a PR for SURFACE and VIEW in few minutes. thanks! i remember once in the summer i had to get merged a small fix about some broken quoting or other small theme-generation related thing, so it could be useful in such case :-). (found all those small issues while was trying to run it as a Flatpak). would you submit the fix or should i send a PR for those above?. also i think it could be added smth like this ENTRY_BG=$(mix \"$BG\" \"$FG\" 0.04) to use it in gtk2\n-e '/color-base/{n;s/#FFFFFF/%ENTRY_BG%/g}' \\. good, let's just have at least some temporary solution so gtk2 will look more or less consistent for the users (i mean like you proposed in your first message). please ping me after committing the fix, i'd like to make a new Flatpak release today or tomorrow\nbtw, how do you think should i make some announcements or reddit or so about Materia and Arc finally supported under Flatpak environment?. thanks a lot!. i think your style expectations are contradicting to Material Design guidelines to which Materia theme is trying to adhere (specifically about entries -- their background have to be derived from Text color but with small level of opacity like 5%)\ni could suggest you trying one of other themes supported in oomox app (ie supporting the same color palette format as you pass to ./change_color.sh script). thanks for reviewing!. or install materia-theme-git if you're running Arch. i am not working on materia, but just answering on some common questions on bug tracker sometimes because i am familiar with the theme internals a bit and so on. i am not aware of tilix specifically but gnome-terminal for instance have it in it's own configuration\ni guess you need to contact tilix developers on this. try adding to your ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:\ncss\n* {\n  text-shadow: none;\n  font-weight: normal;\n}\n(Materia is using font-weight 500 instead of 400). you can try doing it in some particular application using GtkInspector's CSS tab. the only difference i see is what on Materia screenshot text is slightly darker. try lighter fg color\nfont rendering indeed could happen slightly different in depend of color. for just testing purpose you can set it globally:\ncss\n* {\ncolor: #999999;\n}. anyway just for testing purpose could you override the foreground color in terminal preferences?. just to clear it up, after changing font color \"font rendering\" problem got fixed?. if not please show the screenshots with the same fg/bg colors but different themes. by \"problem\" you mean what Materia is not using your favorite color as terminal foreground?. > custom theming for Tilix\n@nana-4 btw what do you think about generating some terminal themes for Materia users? now you can just set terminal colors in Modern -> Materia preset and export them via Base16 for tilix, gnome-terminal and others:\n\n(currently Materia* themes there are just using fallback auto-generated terminal palette which looks quite off from the material design). > by \"problem\" you mean what Materia is not using your favorite color as terminal foreground?\n\nwrong \"black\" color.\n\nthat sounds like \"yes\" answer to the question above. do you mean in Materia TextView and Terminal colors are not matching?. @tliron to learn how to use those templates see this tutorial: https://gist.github.com/actionless/f9ad9e5ab9eac414dac8a3392beb3ad5\njust at the last step choose tilix instead of alacritty. yeah, but you mentioned what you prefer light themes, and it's easier to swap light/dark colors from the UI. > ElementaryOS\n\n(theme broken after update)\nI'm using the system in a production environment\n\ni am just wondering what kind of service are you hosting in production from that machine :-). also clementine is bad example -- it's rendering active playlist row with direct drawing commands, compare it with any other Qt app. in GMail Offline :-). going back to serious mood -- at least gnome interface guidelines discouraging using meaningful text on icons, idk about KDE. > :eyes: \nicons doc is diverged in few different documents, see this one, 9.3.2:\nhttps://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/unstable/icons-design.html.en. i provided that point from HIG just as a topic to think, not as a suggestion\nthough i think it could make sense to split up to icon-only and textual logo versions. why you both @varlesh and @nana-4 prefer to use envelope for the theme, which is far away from sending mails?. what about trying to portray word \"matter\" but in material design style:\nfor example, schematic image of \"solid matter\" could be used as idea/inspiration:\n\n\n\n. what about such composition of the elements?\n\n\nmb only change circles to blue color as on initial mockup  and of-course re-draw them normally in material style. later on idea with logo could be extended into having couple of SVG wallpapers which will be recolored by oomox and converted to png with resvg (as part of current change_color.sh script or make even a separate script to quickly generate wallpaper without regenerating the full theme). > None of your propositions follow Material Design rules.\n\nand of-course re-draw them [circles] normally in material style\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not an envelope (even if it indeed looks like one)\n\nno comments :-). still too much gmail (if first one was looking like Gmail Offline, this looking like \"Inbox by Gmail\"):\n. last one more precise, what about choosing the color shades in such way what M letter will be looking like a single stripe bended 3 times?. and also i would change the angle, since 45 degree angle is not looking too much natural for M letter (and could be a reason why it causing those envelope associations:  )\n(ghostium's draft have both this and my previous concern addressed: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/351#issuecomment-459713013). in official logo M shape is natural, exactly like in default github font for example:\nM M M . also it looks like you have \"Global Dark Theme\" somewhere in your GTK+3 settings enabled?. https://askubuntu.com/questions/769417/how-to-change-global-dark-theme-on-and-off-through-terminal. though i can reproduce the issue itself, steps:\n1) open gtk3-widget-factory\n2) in top-right menu switch Dark Theme on and off\nwhen Dark Theme is on -- Oomox colors are not applied. also, not related to your report,\n\nOomox v0.18\n\nconsider, upgrading to a newer version. i''m reopening since it's seems to be something to be fixed regarding Dark Theme and change_color.sh. see https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/issues/350#issuecomment-457539922. is it happens only with Materia or also with other dark themes?\nit is a known fact what new chrome UI have some colors hardcoded (let's say address bar), so i am just wondering if that border could be one of them\n\nalso there is official Materia chrome theme available: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme#chrome-theme. shouldn't it be up to your icon theme, not gtk theme?\nhave you tried switching to another icon theme in order to test? (and/or the opposite, different gtk theme but the same icon theme). good point, sassc much faster and have less dependencies. my english is not so good so i am actually not sure if it should be in, with or using. for FILEPATH in ./src/_sass/*/_variables.scss ; do\n    sed -i -e 's/^$material_radius: .px/$material_radius: '\"$ROUNDNESS\"'px/g' \"${FILEPATH}\"\ndone. see commit message :-)\nthis stopped working after some recent Materia changes. i'll update it now. because the use of -gtk-recolor() it stopped working, to be precise (before the color was set in asset itself but now in css). it's used not only in Materia theme, but it's possible to remove it only for Materia theme[1] and make it use some other color instead[2]\n[1] https://github.com/themix-project/oomox/blob/master/plugins/theme_materia/oomox_plugin.py#L44\n[2] https://github.com/themix-project/oomox/blob/master/plugins/theme_materia/oomox_plugin.py#L80-L87\n. so, should i remove Accent option from Materia plugin completely?. i've read the article and i think your design decision could be conflicting with the following requirement: Don\u2019t design text fields to look similar to buttons, as they could be mistaken for buttons.\nand currently both button and inputs are using fill_color\ni think the best option will be if you define in _colors.scss just names of the elements (button, input, checkbox, whatever) and next just set them as needed, let's say $button_bg = $fill_color and so on, that will allow to override any element without affecting others. yeah, sorry for being unclear, i exactly meant disabled style (the issue is quite observable since disabled button is often used in UIs, for example in GtkFileChooser unless some file is chosen)\n\nbut now I'm wondering if we really need to do that because the baseline Material color theme is composed only in a few colors. For example, there is such a description:\nSurface colors affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus.\n\ni think such change won't contradict to the guidelines, since the result will be same. It's more about abstraction level: \n1) currently what you have \n```scss\ncolors.scss:\n$surface = #ff0000;\nwidgets' scss:\ncard {\n  background: $surface;\n}\nsheet {\n  background: $surface;\n}\nmenu {\n  background: $surface;\n}\n```\n2) what i propose:\n```scss\ncolors.scss:\n$surface = #ff0000;\n$card_bg = $surface;\n$sheet_bg = $surface;\n$menu_bg = $surface;\nwidgets' scss:\ncard {\n  background: $card_bg;\n}\nsheet {\n  background: $sheet_bg;\n}\nmenu {\n  background: $menu_bg;\n}\n```\napart from being recoloring-friendly having widgets colors defined explicitly will make it more clearly defined which widgets have which colors without guessing or grep-ing. i think the problem above could be fixed with mixins and/or functions (for example in numix/oomox border for different widgets is generated by function dependent on widget state), but i am agree it could be too big volume of refactoring need to be done from your side to implement those\nso better let's stick to the list of options which you are proposing in the next message. also side note, for Error, Warning, Info themix gui using Red, Yellow and Blue terminal colors accordingly, mb to make it clear i will rename \"Red\" into \"Red (error)\" and so on, what do you think?. btw i did reverted all scss changes\nand with the current _colors.scss buttons receiving TXT_BG color, not BTN_BG. reverted one of revert commits :) please let me know if it's fine now. > In many cases, these options are hidden in the GUI.\n\nUsers are hard to notice that the \"Theme\" color options are in the \"Terminal\" section.\n\nthose i think could be solved by duplicating the values so it will be presented twice, in theme and terminal sections. however i am not sure those options are so common to be fine-tuned to extend already big list of theme options (btw in GUI suggestions topic it would be good to discuss how better to split that list into some tabs or expanders to make it easier to navigate)\n\nSome users may not want \"Theme Error color\" and \"Terminal Red color\" to have the same color.\n\nthat easily could be managed by generating different themes for GTK and terminal (since their output is not connected anyway). also tonight i will change the list of available options in Materia Themix plugin as you suggested in https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/pull/329#discussion_r242819290, after that i suggest you playing with it a bit to see if theme preview and generation are happening as you expect them to happen. done, gonna clean-up the code a bit and push in few minutes:\n\n. you can test now with oomox-git AUR package (however some of Materia-related stuff is not merged yet, so those two options won't be applied in generated theme til then):\nhttps://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/pull/331/files. so far reordering not possible because the theme keys used there are also used in other themes\nsolution could be to define new theme vars for those materia-specific options, like View or Surface\nand in plugin config to use TXT_BG as fallback value for VIEW_BG and so on (for that i suggesting creating new issue please). i was thinking it could be more readable but it's indeed not important.

    "DarthWound": "Hello, by the way some instructions in readme about change_color.sh would be welcomed.. Thank you :)\nBy the way, I see you on several forums/websites, and it looks like that when some people talk about a fork of Materia, it's kinda \"hurting\" you. Be proud because behind every Materia fork it's YOUR work that is promoted/congratulated. Yesterday I talked about Equilux on Reddit but I know that without Materia there won't be any Equilux and I credited Materia in a comment :D We love what you've done so far don't worry about that, keep up the good work because Materia is one of the best themes and without a doubt the best base for others.. Yeah I know, I often see that myself. Look at how medias talk about Ubuntu without mentioning Debian 4/5 times :D But that's how they work. I won't mention any website specifically because I'm not here to start a war or a rant, but vast majority of them is just \"talk about this popular thing to make some clicks without searching further\", even the most popular and most appreciated ones. I'm usually quite disappointed when I'm looking for news around GNU/Linux, and that's everyday. Sometimes we discover nice stuff, but let's face it the best comes from community itself (Reddit, forums...).\nThanks for the script instructions in HACKING.md.. Hello @nana-4 \nFor xfce4-panel (v4.12 GTK2) on standard Materia, I suggest you to use bits from Materia-dark and set panel background to #383838.\nHere's what it looks like (I'm using dark variant + #383838 panel bg), don't care about the green colors I customized theme to fit the distro:\n\nedit: didn't see it before uploading, white bottom border is from my VM window, so don't worry about it.\nCurrently, standard variant panel (with panel bg using theme defaults) is like this:\n\nBTW, light variant is the same except that dark grey parts are black.\nKeep up the good work, Xfce full support would be great. Of course GTK3 will probably come this year, but a lot of distros will be on <4.14 for quite a long time (Ubuntu LTS, Debian, other slow point releases...).\nEDIT2: I see that Materia doesn't have a dedicated panel.rc file (which is used by Xfce and iirc MATE).\nEDIT3: I tried to make a dedicated panel.rc but menu and some tray icons still have a dark background, with other themes having a good Xfce support, it doesn't happen, I think there's something conflicting in gtkrc or other rc files.. Thanks, didn't see the \"panel\" line in colors.scss :)\nEDIT:\nWell, with the right color (#212121), my panel.rc (based on zukitwo) is ok (for standard and dark, I didn't tweak light gtkrc yet). It's basic, but should do the job for now.\n\nadd in gtkrc:\n\n```\nPanel\ngtk-color-scheme = \"panel_bg_color:#212121\\panel_fg_color:#F2F2F2\"\n```\nand\ninclude \"panel.rc\"\n\n\npanel.rc available here (exp in 1 month).\n\n\nScreenshot (again, don't mind the green colors):\n\n. If it helps, this is what I set in GNOME Terminal when I use Materia. Of course it's just what I like and probably not what @nana-4 would like to have but it follows Material Design palette.\n\n\nOpen images in new tab to enlarge them.\n\nEDIT: oops, forgot to add \"1\" and \"2\" for \"light-grey\" at the bottom\n\n\nBased on my recent scripts that you can find in my repos, I've made one to apply light variant and one to apply dark variant. But be aware that they replace default profile, so edit them if you want to create a new profile instead of losing your current settings. Using these scripts isn't mandatory it's only a faster way and you can just use GNOME Terminal settings GUI.\nDark: https://gist.github.com/DarthWound/5874eee894f7e39a950dc09a3a800169\nLight: https://gist.github.com/DarthWound/6431945dec4ba249a71cfa14c592fe67\n. No problem I'm glad to help you when I can \ud83d\ude04 \nBy the way my theme kinda preserve what the default themes do, except Solarized.\nI mean that the patterns are very similar while using Material tints so it doesn't \"shock\" users.\nSome color schemes that we can find change (or even replace) colors too much, not this one:\n-> screenshot\n. I agree, for the exact same reasons.. Thank you, yeah I'll define missing colors, and try again (in v20180110).\nIf it works I'll try to convert my script for new current structure.\nWorking at night 6/7 + being very ill since three days = heavy brainfarts \ud83d\ude06 \nI'll look at your HACKING.md update when it's online.\nThank you, it's nice to help people tweaking your theme.. Yeah but it doesn't work as intended, some colors are not in right place and it's not flexible enough.\nTried Oomox too ;) I need more control on changes that are made, it's why I'm tweaking manually.\nBut Oomox is a great piece of software and a wonderful tool for people wanting to make some custom stuff. You did great with this and I can't wait to see future improvements/possibilities on it.. The problem that I met with current change-color.sh is that it tries to parse only a few colors within the same template on all the files. Depending of colors selected by the user, it can make a light panel with white fonts and a dark menu with black fonts and some other issues. And GTK2 is totally messed up the same way. For example when I tried to use my openSUSE scheme with Oomox, I had wrong colors on GNOME panel, and GTK2 was totally different.\nHowever don't think that I'm making a script because I want to reinvent the wheel, it's just a tool for me to build my custom theme in one click while being sure that all the changes that I need are made.\nI'b be glad to help but I'm not a bash expert, not a theming expert either, I made my own distro years ago but I almost forgot everything and a lot of stuff changed :p but when I have a 100% working script feel free to adapt it for Oomox, as I'll release it with my theme once it's done.\nBy the way it would be great to know how exactly @nana-4 built his \"material-ubuntu\" variant, maybe it could give us more ideas.. Ok I modified my script and now it works flawlessly with master version. Still, my custom theme is far from being ready because GTK3 styling is new for me so my variant is a bit broken for the moment lol.. I close this issue as I'm done with my theme and don't want to pollute your issues page. Thank you again for your help and feel free to take a look at my script (in source folder), but it's very basic (maybe too basic lol, but it works).. The sleep 3s thing? I know it's a bit slow maybe I'll change it later, but I prefer to be sure that changes are correctly made, sometimes when I sed or cat something and do another command just after that then it doesn't take changes in account. But you're right it may be annoying.. Thank you for the tip :). @nana-4 I've a weird graphical issue on \"list buttons\" (don't know their name) in GTK2 with my custom theme but not with Materia, any clue on that? Thanks :-)\n. Don't be sorry, as I said it's already very nice to help me :) I'm very busy too so I understand.\nThank your for the tip, I'll build a new version with #FEFEFE when I've got some spare time.. Just to say thank you again, it worked well and I built a new version of my theme with this fix.. Following issue #19:\nCongrats @nana-4 this new color scheme is better IMO. And I'm working on something... ;) . ...and I'm done :)\n@nana-4 -> https://github.com/DarthWound/materia-kolorizer. @actionless it's different and complementary. No competition here. And change_color.sh has (had?) some issues like not rendering variants simultaneously or weird elements in GNOME Shell.\nFrom my readme.md:\n\nPS: I know that there is a script provided by Materia (and Oomox utility) to create custom themes, the difference here is that we only change primary/accent colors and keep Materia theme (+variants) intact.. @nana-4 just a suggestion, wouldn't it be better if gnome-shell \"light\" variant was really \"light\"?\n\nscreenshot (don't pay attention to the blue color)\nFor example:\n```\n\"TOP BAR\" section\n- normal becomes transparent white\n- solid becomes very light grey instead of same as normal\n212121 -> #DEDEDE\nFFFFFF -> #000000\nrgba(0, 0, 0, 0.x) -> rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.x)\n```. @nana-4 \n\nAlso thanks for your suggestion. It looks nice, but my only concern is that Matetia-light also has a dark theme (for gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme). I think the combination of light top bar and dark theme (especially when maximized) probably does not look good.\n\nYou're right. Do you think it's something potentially feasible though?. @nana-4 no problem, thank you :). Regarding icons, IMO Papirus would be better, Paper is kinda abandoned while Papirus is hyperactive and devs work fast on requests. And it's easily customizable, check their \"papirus-folders\" repo and my \"papirus-kolorizer\" repo.. The one from https://www.box-look.org/p/1236946/ could be used (Equilux is a dark grayscale mod of Materia).. ",

Be prepared for some bugs.\n. @jgato I'm pretty busy with other stuff right now. But I haven't forgotten it.\nThe only progress I made so far is that I designed and integrated some plain white icons for common add-ons like AdBlockPlus.\nThe tab bar and the navigation appear in reversed order for me and not in normal order like for you. I'm using flex-box properties for this. Maybe you are using an older version of Firefox that doesn't support flex-boxes yet or some Add-on or Stylish script that conflicts with the theme? It would be helpful for me to figure out the problen if you could tell me your FF version, your installed Add-ons and your Stylish scripts (if you have any).\n@bil-elmoussaoui\nI will consider that. I used a similar design concept than gnome browser (epiphany) which I personally really like on a \"looks\" point of view.\nHowever working with it I discovered some really great disadvantages especially for small screens. So I will probably remove the focus animation.\n. @Baemir  I have stopped development on the xpi extension since nana-4 started developing the Stylish script. As complete themes definitely will be shut down by Firefox I think that makes sense.\nI recently checked it and my theme is incompatible with current versions of Firefox. Disabling the \"Check compatibility\" feature as nana-4 suggested will successfully force Firefox to use the theme, but some menus will be unusable.\n@jgato I made some adjustments in the stylish script from nana-4. E.g. making the navigation bar draggable, adding flat icons for browser functions and common plugins or correction the scope of the CSS rules. I will post them here when I'm back home.\nHowever I doubt that this development will lead to something because Mozilla now also announced that they want to shut down their plugin engine altogether by November. (See https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/ )\nInstead they're replacing it with the all new WebExtensions API which has far less capabilities. I'm still reading through Mozilla's API and thus I still need to confirm this, but it doesn't seem to provide any method of injecting CSS into the browser UI. The developers of Stylish have announced that they will switch to the Chrome WebExtension and make it available for Firefox. However there is currently no support for modifying the browser UI (See https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/47242/the-future-of-stylish-for-firefox ). They say it's one of their goals to preserve that functionality, but I highly doubt that Mozilla will add necessary API functions as they are shutting down XUL as well. And XUL was the whole basis of being able to style the browser UI via CSS.\nIt seems that Mozilla's approach of \"Make Firefox Great Again\" will lead us into a dark future in terms of the freedom that Firefox always provided compared to other browsers. My only hope is that Mozilla puts an unexpected big effort into the WebExtensions API and make it much more potent than anticipated (and much more potent than Chrome's engine). But for the moment it doesn't look like that.. I can confirm this issue. I have the same nautilus and theme version. Also on Arch Linux.\nDoesn't look like an upstream issue to me as it looks perfectly fine in Adwaita.. ",

Now:\n\nAs you said, now I have the tabs bar below the navigation bar. I would prefer the other way around, with the tabs bar in the top. I dont know, it looks more modern in my opinion. Other issues I have found : \n- I cannot see minimize, maximize buttons.\n- When I start typing in the navigation bar, the pull down options width is the maximum horizontal of the window. It looks strange and with tinny fonts.\nFinally, did you consider that firefox themes will be soon no longer suported? here more info and here the firefox gnome-theme team talking about it and moving to Firefox User Styles.\nIn any case, this will be my theme nowadays ;) \n. @nana-4 I dont know why with your version my tabs looks so dark :(\n\n. It worked, thanks.... we are excited for new versions guys :D :D. good overview @Scindix I have been a supporter of Firefox from years ago, even before of changing the name to Firefox. I have read other articles about complains with this changes and the WebExtensions API, that I dont know how they work. \nI remember once programming an addon with XUL and JavaScript but even having to link it with other internal libraries in C. XUL seemed to me like a nightmare, you could modify the XUL of any place powerful, funny, but... it opens the possibility of making a big mess. Specially when you start mixing lots of add-ons. In the other hand, nowadays... at least for me, I use less and less addons, so maybe we dont need so much flexibility in the framework for addons.\nIs Webextensions API related to the new [testpilot](https://testpilot.firefox.com/]?

Hey all, Mozilla just enabled Client-Side Decorations in the ff59 nightly, here's a screenshot showing how it looks. Other than a official theme I think this is as good as it gets.

Any news on this one? . >Are you using GTK+ 3.18.x? If so, what distro and version are you using?\nUbuntu Gnome 16.04 LTS. I don't want to migrate to newer versions of Gnome and GTK as this is my \"stable\" system I use for everything and reinstalling it all/migrating files and settings would be a mess. It sucks that most themes work poorly here but I would like to use it until the end of support at least since I have few time... and I think this version is still quite popular as 16.04 was the latest LTS and a lot of people (expecially those interested in customization/ricing) tended to prefer Gnome 3 over Unity.\n\nDo you think the top bar of GNOME Shell is still high even if using the compact variant?\n\nI did some tests and it seems the only things that change when I set GTK+ and Shell theme to the compact version is the top bar (window titlebars remain the same). While it was mostly the title-bar on the windows that I felt I would've preferred a bit smaller, themes like Adapta Eta have a slightly smaller Top Bar than the compact version of Materia and it doesn't look bad (you could check that out as a reference to see what I mean). But since the compact version of Materia was in my opinion already a very tasteful choice you made, I think it wouldn't be right to completely replace it, and it would be better to just make a Materia-dark-very-compact version or something like that.\n\nWhat is the actual resolution of your monitor?\n\n1366*768. The eternal resolution, dare I call it! \nIf it's not possible for you to properly work on the titlebar size, don't worry, we won't ask you the impossible, sir. The theme is already great enough, and with the option for a smaller top bar it will be even more versatile! . ",

    "ikeydoherty": "P.S. if its something that I can fix - then please just let me know. I've no issue in making life a bit easier for people :). I think you got this one a bit twisted. The only theme that Solus officially supports is Arc, as it is our default theme. If you're talking about themes available in our repos, then that's a completely different story. We only provide what has been requested by users.\nHowever, there are quite a number of Solus/Budgie users of Flat-Plat, who install it locally and haven't requested it. I know this because I was told by one of them yesterday on IRC that you'd removed support for Budgie, and they were very shocked that you'd done this.\nBack to the topic of \"those devs\". I'm the Budgie developer, and the Solus founder. There is only one person you listen to when it comes to matters of anything \"official\" in the context of Budgie, and that's me. So \"those devs\" you don't listen to, because it has nothing to do with Budgie itself.\n\nThose devs are trying to make Adapta the de facto standard\nbut their attitude disappointed me\n\nLad, you need to look at the full picture. I hate material design. So I've no interest in making anything the \"de facto standard\". The only interest I have is in keeping my views of MD out of the way, and ensuring that Budgie users have a large and healthy choice for theming. To imply I would restrict that, is absurd.. I had a suspicion this might be the case. No apologies needed, you crack on and keep providing variety for people :D . ",
    "fossfreedom": "@nana-4 as project lead of Ubuntu Budgie (budgie-remix) I'm more than a little surprised and disturb what I have read here.\nSimilar to Ikey - it is our users that have been requesting more theme support.  We similarly only officially support Arc. \nIt is important to note that we have been looking at ways to make it easy for our users to install and most importantly keep up-to-date with upstream changes.\nThat is our only thoughts here - themes that have been chosen to be linked to by our \"welcome application\" are simply because they have PPA's which we can link to.  We constantly look out for more themes support and when they become available we intend to add those themes so that our users can choose and install via one click of a button.\nWe note you have an open issue about maintaining a ubuntu PPA (#44) - we sincerely hope one of your users of flat-plat will do this on your behalf.  Please let us know when a PPA becomes available and we will definitely and eagerly update our welcome application as soon as possible.\nI hope that clarifies the position - we have not intentionally or otherwise said \"support this theme ... but not that theme\".  We are just linking to themes that are both easily installed and are easily maintained via Ubuntu's normal packaging mechanism.. @nana-4 please have a look here: https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/budgie-welcome/blob/master/data/default.html\n\"Material Design (Adapta)\" and \"Material Design (Vimix)\"\nThe author of Adapta describes Adapta as following a material design.  I'm not asserting his or any theme as the definitive material theme.  The quote is from the author himself.  I cannot and will not adjudicate in anyway which theme is material or not.\nThese are listed simply because they have PPAs associated with them and most importantly, those PPA's have a 17.04 archive.  We could not include \"Material Design (Paper)\" because the PPA does not have a 17.04 archive.\nI really do not understand your assertion that Ubuntu Budgie treats Flat-Plat as inferior.  We cannot include the option \"Material Design (Flat-Plat)\" simply because there is no 17.04 PPA.  There is no slight here, no disparagement.  I cannot offer users Flat-Plat because there is no debian package for them to install.\nI would like to reiterate again - we have only included links to themes that have 17.04 PPAs.\nIf you wish to talk to myself drop into our community chatroom.  More than happy to discuss further. https://gitter.im/ubuntubudgie/community. ",
    "TechnoSparks": "I feel the need to hop in the conversation of this \"closed\" issue.\nDear nana-4, I understand your frustrations and the disappointment that you have regarding the issue. I have been in the same situation, although my final actions are different. \nI need to tell you something, as a user of your gorgeous theme, I for one finds your theme more pleasing and is well suited for making Linux beautiful.. In fact, as a personal stance, I find it better than the fork. Before your theme, I always used Arc, it is nice, but it's too flat. Your theme is a hero when I found it, like a blessing, as it is based on Material Design, whereas elevation plays quite a role. I absolutely love Flat-Plat.\nI was scrolling through this repo's closed issues to see how committed you are with your work. I really love seeing committed developers.. It somewhat serves as an inspiration for me to keep developing, although I know I am just an amateur programmer. So, I stumbled upon this thread mentioning Budgie. I had disappointment when reading through it.\nBudgie has been a desktop that is pulling my interest since the birth of Solus. It has a configurable Panel, it is based on GTK, and it does not focus on tablet-interface paradigm like Gnome. However, I don't want to use Solus, because of that it is a new OS, and it is not derived from Ubuntu. Since I have been using Ubuntu-based distro for a long time, I need the familiarity and would like to not go through another Distro's technicality again, especially package management.\nSo I have been keeping quite an eye to any possible Ubuntu-based distro making use of the Budgie desktop. This thread reveals that there is such a distro! But I am saddened, I cannot make the change of Distro because your theme cannot be used there. Its like, I am offered a huge dream, but something that I depend on forbids me from grasping that chance.\nI know, I could just use Adapta, but nana-4, again, I emphasize, your theme is better in all ways.\nAs one of your faithful users, I would like to humbly request for you to enable support for Budgie again. Think of your users. They use your theme not for the sake of using, but because they like it. Creating a barrier like this will limit them from using what they love, and also ultimately making Linux distros less customisable and has less appearance options like people advertise them do. This is also the reason why I like Linux better than Windows. Your theme deserves to be recognised and used by people, and Material Design lovers like me and you.\nI may have misunderstood the actual reason why you boycott Ubuntu Budgie, but the action you took, which is to drop support, does prove an effect on behalf of your Budgie users, including me.. Budgie is a desktop environment, and effectively not only Ubuntu Budgie users suffering from this, but includes the original Solus OS and any other Distros whose users' desktop environment is Budgie.\nHowever, if you disagree and insist, I understand and will never ask again.\nSorry if this is offensive, and badly written. I do not intend for it to be like so. Like you, I don't speak English as a first language. My choice of words or tone selection could be wrong for some. I would like to stress that you are not obliged to accept my request, although I would be very, very happy if you do. :)\nWarm regards.. @nana-4 \nI don't mind of any late replies. It is perfectly fine\nNothing can describe my excitement for the re-enabled support. I truly and immensely appreciate the action you took! You really made my morning when I read an email of your reply. Thank you so so much! I was anxious thinking that the email I received was going to be about you declining my request. It was a huge relief to read something different than expected.\nI understand the difficulties of maintaining many DEs. You as a lone maintainer, I suggest for you to work on this wonderful theme at a comfortable pace with no pressure. This could ease down the difficulty you would normally have. This is, just a suggestion. I also may try to contribute in the future given enough knowledge of SCSS. \n\nBy the way, one thing I would like to say to avoid misunderstandings is that \"Creating a barrier\" is by them, not by me. Boycotting Ubuntu Budgie by me was just a result. It is a response to unfair and not-free practices.\n\nYou made it crystal clear. I understand, thanks for the clarification!\nAgain, I would like to thank you so much. \ud83d\ude04\nWarm regards.. If I understand the poster correctly, you may edit /src/gnome-shell/3.18/sass/_colors.scss to change the dark variant to have that translucent look by a simple line change.\nOn line 46, change\n$panel_bg_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', $blue_grey_900, $bg_color);\nto\n$panel_bg_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', $bg_color, $bg_color);\nor for logical code\n$panel_bg_color: $bg_color; // this makes all shell themes to have the translucency\nThis relies on the previous declaration of bg_color on line 43. If you wish to fine tune the translucency, you can actually do that as well. Eg\n$panel_bg_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', rgba($red_900, 0.7), $bg_color);\n// or $panel_bg_color: rgba($red_900, 0.7); to apply to all shell themes\nRe-parse SCSS and then reinstall the theme. Thank you! Fixed this on the spot, and learnt something new \ud83d\ude07 Sorry for the report - I thought it was a bug . One word: You are awesome! \ud83d\ude01.

I'll check this function again and see what its missing other than --primary color. about opacity I haven't included yet in the script. . 1- I don't mind using pre-compiled .css files. but by using sassc you don't need all of the gtk-color-size.css,gtk-color-size.scss , gnome-shell-color-size.css and gnome-shell-color-size.scss the script will generate the proper files whenever needed. \n2- bring back all of the .css & .scss files will not break the script at all. I'll make the script do the following (if you want):\n         1- For normal installation (without modifying the original theme) use copy.\n         2- For custom installation (modifying the original theme) use sassc.\n3- About .gitignore and HACKING.md I'll put them back.. Hello @nana-4 \nI already reviewed your ./install.sh script, and I don't mind to help you improve it but we will end up having the same ./install.sh I've already wrote. \nusing functions will allow you to control the flow of the script and help you develop each part of your script much easier and without effecting the  rest of the code.\nalso function will allow you to parse user inputs (command line arguments) and validate them and prevent the other invalid arguments from being processed. \nTHE most important thing is to make sure your script is safe to use (and you should consider every possibility that could break the script). In your script I don't see anything that will validate the user input.\n . @nana-4 \n\nWas it bad for you to simply improve my revised version? In my opinion, it is better and simpler to lump install items together as an function than to separate them\nThere is a reason about separating them, most of it about control, validate, secure and parsing ....etc. @nana-4,\nI'm gonna review your code again, and comment on it. .

So I think you'll have to change the window-*-symbolic.svg icons in arc-icon-theme.\n\nI'll try doing so in the evening, currently I am at work.\nHow should I go about it?\n\nSo if you want to change the pink colors of check, switch, etc. for GTK+ 3.20 or later, you have to edit $accent_color to your color and run ./parse-sass.sh.\nActually, I did not check very deep into what I was changing, I just changed what was pink to blue (both in the SVG and in the SCSS).. > Strange. Do your PNG assets in materia-theme/src/gtk/assets also remain pink?\n\nAffirmative.\n\nI'm not an icon theme maker or arc-icon-theme user, so I don't know exactly. But I think it'll be okay if you download the source of the icon theme and change the SVGs then install the icon theme according to README.\n\nI'll try that when I'll be on my laptop.\n\nAlso can you attach a screenshot of gtk3-widget-factory applying your ongoing theme?\n\nI'll be glad to, I'll just need to install it first.. Sorry, I had fallen asleep last night.\nIn the end I did not have time to edit arc-icon-theme, however here are screenshots of `gtk3-widget-factory:\n\n\n\n. It's fine, don't worry about it.\nActually, I am sorry for taking so much of your time.\nIf I'll be able to continue, I'll notify you.. Thanks, I'll try this when I have the time.\nI'm sorry about my late reply.. ",
    "svnset": "Hey,\nI'll add it once I am satisfied with the result (will be available in the nord repos too). So what I want to achieve is that  the nord palette users have the option to either build the materia theme with the script directly or to use oomox. :)\nBTT. So why do we not just use FG instead? The FG color should be white in the dark theme, and black in the light theme right?. Ok after doing some more tests it seems that what I want to achieve is not as easy as I thought and without @nana-4 's help maybe not possible at all.\nTo sum up:\nIt would be nice to have a possiblity to use bright selection bg with dark selection fg. Atm this is not possible, because the inverted values are used in other places as well. This means if I choose a dark selection fg, other elements like the panel fg or gnome-shell fg get changed as well. A solution would be to seperate the SEL_FG from the panel and other stuff by adding a new value for SEL_FG. The inverse fg colors could then depend on MENU_FG. This way the main theme would remain untouched (correct me if I'm wrong sry).\nExample with bright SEL_BG and dark SEL_FG: https://ptpb.pw/z96W\n. Sounds like a nice solution. \nI would stick to the rgba() instead of mix(). If you have complex colors like eg. blue-purple-greyish ones (nord palette) using mix() with black or white is not as good as using the alpha value to brighten/darken. The resulting colors are better.\nI spotted another flaw for dark themes yesterday. Is there any specific reason we do not use the light/dark/standard switches in the change_color script? For most of the colors this is fine, since we declare only one value. But not for the border colors.\nIf we compare\n~~~\n_colors.scss.template\nline 90-94\n$border_color:             if($variant == 'light', rgba(%FG%, 0.12), rgba(%FG%, 0.26));\n...\n$highlight_color:          if($variant == 'light', rgba(%TXT_BG%, 0.4),  rgba(%TXT_BG%, 0.1));\n$titlebar_highlight_color: %MENU_BG%;\n...\n$alt_highlight_color:      rgba(%TXT_BG%, 0.2);\n~~~\nto\n~~~\n_colors.scss\nline 88-92\n$border_color:             if($variant == 'light', rgba($black, 0.12), rgba($black, 0.26));\n...\n$highlight_color:          if($variant == 'light', rgba($white, 0.4),  rgba($white, 0.1));\n$titlebar_highlight_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', rgba($white, 0.1),  rgba($white, 0.4));\n...\n$alt_highlight_color:      rgba($white, 0.2);\n~~~\nWe might notice that the value for FG changes and is only black for light themes. Here the dark switch is necessary.\nEg. better would be:\n~~~\n_colors.scss.template\n$border_color:             if($variant == 'light', rgba(%FG%, 0.12), rgba(%BG%, 0.26));\n...\n$highlight_color:          if($variant == 'light', rgba(%TXT_BG%, 0.4),  rgba(%TXT_FG%, 0.1));\n$titlebar_highlight_color: if($titlebar == 'dark', rgba(%MENU_BG%, 0.1),  rgba(%MENU_FG%, 0.4));\n...\n$alt_highlight_color:      if($variant =='light', rgba(%TXT_BG%, 0.2), rgba(%TXT_F\n      G%, 0.2));\n~~~\nThat's the only case I found where the values are not in the contrary (eg. black/white) but the same with different rgba() (eg. black/black). \nA solution would be to just change the colors in the template like in the example above and to use the dark variant switch . When I simply do that however, the bg and fg values in gtk2 are turned around and it looks horrible. So a few more changes would be necessary. I could create a pull request if you want to.\nEDIT: It seems there is only this one proper way to use the rgba() values like intended by @nana-4. Otherwise the light themes look alot better than the dark themes.\n. @nana-4 \n\nIndeed we should separate SEL_FG from the panel fg colors, but we also can't use FG, BTN_FG or MENU_FG because they are not always light colors.\n\nThat doesn't matter. If we use MENU_FG, MENU_BG has to be set to the opposite color. So when MENU_FG is dark, MENU_BG should be light etc. The panel fg should just not have anything to do with the selection fg. If we declare new values it should be PANEL_FG\\PANEL_BG but I don't know if that's necessary.\n@actionless \n\nso, as i mentioned before, we need to investigate which color is used a a background there and take a foreground color from that pair\n\nMENU_BG is used. So we should use MENU_FG as you have already mentioned before.\n\nyou can't talk about light or dark colors at all, always think of them as of mixed with others/with alpha component...\n\nYou are right.\nWe cannot:\n~~~\n$some color:    if($variant =='light', %light_color%, %dark_color%);\n~~~\nrather:\n~~~\n $some_color:    if($variant =='light', rgba(%COLOR%, #value), rgba(%COLOR%, #value));\n~~~\n@actionless BTW could you explain the meaning of the GTK_GENERATE_DARK_THEME value? Because it does not set the $variant to dark. How to access the dark values then? To deliver good looking dark themes which come close to the materia dark theme (or the light theme which looks already good except for SEL_FG/SEL_BG), the template has to make use of its if statements. I would be willing to contribute to improve the dark themes for this script and oomox. (If the border colors are changed and if statements are used whenever there are rgba()'s it looks almost perfect, except for gtk2 for now). I solved the second issue and am very happy with the result. I'll create a pull request this evening. (I was also able to improve the gtk2 lookfor dark themes a bit, found a few bugs there as well) \n@actionless you can review the code then so that oomox compatibility does not break. But don't worry I made sure the defaults remain the same. For oomox dark and light do not matter I know that. That's why we stick to the always compile \"light\" theme approach, and the theme is dark when the user sets dark colors and light when the user sets light colors. But if you want that the darker themes look as good as the lighter themes, we will provide a variable MATERIA_COLOR_VARIANT which defaults to light but can be set to dark to make darker colored themes prettier. You'll see what I mean and if it breaks stuff on oomox's side, we find a solution or do not use my pr no worries :)\nThis way I can express better what i mean. Because posting here large code blocks is tiresome. :P. We can think about setting it automatically too. I think it's a nice idea, but we should also provide the option to set it manual, for advanced users like us.\nLet us do this step by step, first manual with a sane default set to \"light\", so that for oomox users which have this variable not set, nothing changes at all. Also you have to check the incoming pr first if it even makes sense to go furter here or if there are any deal-breakers.. Nice we'll try to use it later on.. Pr is there. If you have time you can take a look :P . I moved the  \"issues/fixes/planned features\" overview to the top post :) . The new color scheme is very nice. But once the best ever customizing script is done with the new template, everyone will run their own color version :P. > I dont know if it has been asked before but I would like to see an\nanthracite / yellow theme.\nrecently I startd changed all our desktop machine in the makerspace to an\nubuntu with Materia theme.\nour colours are yellow ( ffdd0e ) and very dark grey\nWould be great is a colour sheme like that would be available :)\nJust use our change_color.sh script (or oomox). It improved alot this year and produces beautiful materia themes based on your own colorscheme. You could automate the building and recoloring of materia for all machines in a very simple script.. Thx for reviewing :) Yeah I can do that. I would first like to get this through though. \nI could think of checking if MATERIA_COLOR_VARIANT is explicitly set, and if not we can test the colors (which colors just BG?) with is_dark and set the value then accordingly.. Done. :). Hmm i cannot reproduce this sry: https://ptpb.pw/PpjQ \nAre you sure you use the pr?  Because this dropdown text HAS to be a fg color like in my screenshot.\nCan you post the related color config? . Hmm, works fine for me: https://ptpb.pw/hNXF\nI compile with change_color.sh directly, did you use oomox?. My Gtk version is 3.22.28-1. I'll do more tests and report back.. I cannot reproduce sry. Everything works as expected no matter if dark or light. I did alot of tests yesterday too (especially on gnome). Edge cases can happen because of is_dark but the normal cases should work properly.\nTested on 2 machines both Arch Gtk 3.22.28 here.\n\nJust one note: I was thinking GTK3_GENERATE_DARK will be implemented properly in the future for gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme, but I put it aside for now because we will be able to implement it later. :)\n\nWe can leave a placeholder for this, but for now this value makes not much sense.\n. > also i think you'll have to test more on gnome themes which have dark MENU_BG but light BG and light MENU_BG but dark BG\n@actionless Well this pr is no solution for all cases. For light themes e.g. this pr does not change anything at all. Once this pr is through we can work step by step on improvement :P \nThis is by the way the reason I wanted to implement this functionality of autodetecting step by step. Because the first commit is save and does not change anything on the user side if you do not set the value. \n. We'll get to it and are in no hurry. :)\n@nana-4 thx for joining :P would be nice if you can test too the new variable and how it affects your experience. It should not make things worse. But if that's the case somehow I would roll back to commit 1 where the default is set to light again. It would be a softer pr then :) \nEDIT: sry you replied while I typed. > Finally I could reproduce the problem on \"awesome\" window manager.\n\nI will investigate it further.\n\nNice job. If that's the case it could be the dropdown bug which some tiling wm's have.. So i was able to reproduce this bug in i3 finally too. So it's related to gtk3 wihtout gnome-shell. Also i spotted another gtk2 issue, the button colors are still #424242. \n. yep I'll do.. Hey guys, I'm finally home and can start fixing stuff now. I keep you updated.. > also i was rethinking the combination of the problem which you are trying to solve (to have different border ratios for dark and light themes) and approach you've chosen (to use two base \"sub-templates\")\nI think we have different expectations. I just want to improve the opt in approach and leave the rest to the maintainer. This means I try to bring the template closer to it's source in colors.scss and make use of what is already there. To deliver the same look with complex gtk3 styling for both dark colored and light colored themes is not possible without issues, that's why all themes use those if statements in the first place. All I want is to make use of at least all the functionality which is already there without too much fiddling. But I see that for oomox there are different goals like having as many different color combos as possible. So we'll have to see how we satisfy all stakeholders but we get there no worries :D . Should work now, tested in i3.\nSo 2 issues fixed and one new found :/ https://ptpb.pw/hx0p\nIt's #292929, don't know where set.. It's not my DE, but I test on different ones. This is xfce-settings with compton. So gtk2.. It's in awf too. https://ptpb.pw/yGUI. No don't install it :D, it's just where I found it by incident and made screen.\nSo it's the deactivated color in gtk2. It's no value we can access with our gtkrc.. Thx I took care of it. I used your INACTIVE_TXT_BG.. Nope it looks just like materia dark:\n\nSo this look is actually intended and was wrong before. If you remember @nana-4 posted this fix for dropdowns for i3/awesome etc:\n~~~\n$opaque_fg_color:           %FG%;\n$opaque_secondary_fg_color: mix(%FG%, $base_color, percentage(0.7));\n$opaque_disabled_fg_color:  mix(%FG%, $base_color, percentage(0.5));\n$opaque_divider_color:      mix(%FG%, $base_color, percentage(0.12));\n~~~\nAnd I simply implemented it. If you like the appearance from before more we can propably change the colors to something else again. But I would be ok with this and stick to the orignal look. Also note that the gnome-shell dropdowns looked before like now. Those values seem to be workarounds and effect only non-csd-menus (And somehow wm's like i3). \nHere is the old snippet you can see the difference:\n~~~\n-$opaque_fg_color:           if($variant == 'light', %FG%, %TXT_BG%);\n-$opaque_secondary_fg_color: if($variant == 'light', %FG%, mix(%TXT_BG%, $base_color, percentage(0.7)));\n-$opaque_disabled_fg_color:  if($variant == 'light', %INACTIVE_FG%, mix(%TXT_BG%, $base_color, percentage(0.5)));\n-$opaque_divider_color:      if($variant == 'light', %SEL_BG%, mix(%TXT_BG%, $base_color, percentage(0.12)));\n~~~ . @actionless yep once this goes through we will improve cases.\nThx for reviewing I think we're getting here somewhere. :P . Yep pls merge. I am not a fan of too bloated pr's.\nWe will then continue in a new one.. @nnnn20430 why would you advertise another theme here? Stop doing this pls and move on to whatever you desire. (Even so we provide a script to choose whatever color you like...?!). @nnnn20430 just like I said, use whatever you like. If you put it like in your last post, it's totally fine. My only point is that upstream issues are the wrong places to share information which are not related to the specific project. There are forums or other platforms to share this information. So the part about beeing unhappy with the new colorscheme is ok, the part about posting another project not :P . related to #223 #228 \nSince the repository is empty atm, you cannot update your theme. So either install from github or use https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/materia-gtk-theme.. What are you talking about? This is how scss files work.

    "smurphos": "Hi all,\nA bit late to this discussion. I had a chance to check some Oomox created variants in gnome shell today and the autodetection of color variant results in themes autodetected as dark not having any contrast between colors used in the panel foreground and the panel background. \nI came across the same issue in making the cinnamon theme #235 and the workaround used was to have $titlebar set to dark in all variants and use titlebar_fg colors paired with panel_bg colors in the body of the theme.\nI've just checked through the Gnome Shell scss and other than $solid_panel_bg_color it doesn't look like anything else used is affected by the value of $titlebar. Even that is a choice between transparent black and a dark solid grey. \nSo I think a similar workaround could work for gnome shell - use titlebar_fg colors paired with panel_bg colors and always set $titlebar to dark when building gnome shell. \nThe only bugbear is $solid_panel_bg_color.\nNot sure what people's thoughts are?. https://launchpad.net/~dyatlov-igor/+archive/ubuntu/materia-theme\nThe PPA is empty right now.. Thanks, it's the Oomox cinnamon theme I'm using as a base which is under GPLv3. The Oomox theme is a SCSS conversion of a CSS theme I made based on the Cinnamon default which is CSS only aswell. That ships under GPLv2.. Apologies for the additional commits - a few usability issues highlighted with a couple of days of use of the theme - if you want them squashed please let me know.. Will do - would you like the _extends incorporated into _common as-well or keep them as a separate import?\nEdit  - It's done - I made an executive decision that keeping the extends separate make sense - they are easy to cross-reference particularly when it's only 2 documents.\nOnly major difference in layout between this and the upstream is that I've kept all of the panel-orientation specific theming in one place rather than scattered around the stylesheet. When I first started theming cinnamon I found that working on this aspect was quite painful (do I pad the launcher or the applet box or both??) and it's just a lot easier to get this right having all of the relevant selectors in one place.\nIf you are comparing directly with the upstream please be aware that the upstream needs some clean up - it has a few never used and/or deprecated circa 6 years ago selectors hanging around. \nFor compatability it should be noted that the theme requires cinnamon v3.2 or higher.\nI've tested the build - all OK, no xsession-errors and nothing unexpected from https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator.. Thank-you. All good to merge from my point of view.\nHopefully the mint team will convert the default theme at some point. The newish Mint-Y theme is built with sass so they should be open to it.

Maybe the gnome-shell-theme.gresource file is corrupt now? Have I forgotten anything? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n. @nana-4 Thank you for figuring all this out. For now, I replaced the gnome-shell.css with the correct version manually and it works like a charm.\nI just switched from Windows to Ubuntu and, as a huge Material Design fan, couldn't be happier now. Thank you so much and keep up the great work! :+1: . > Did you also change the ubuntu.css file as written in the wiki?\nI did that now and everything is back to normal :+1: Thank you!\nI would suggest to change the following line in the wiki\n\nFor Ubuntu 17.10, you also need to back up the following file:\n\nso that it is clear that Ubuntu 18 users have to do this too.\n.

Adding 2 attributes everywhere will take quite a while because I'll have to figure out where I need to add it.\n\nin Material Design elements do not have text-shadow basically. So I'd prefer to change the background or foreground color to make it legible.\n\nThat would also be great. I'm unsure whether GTK allows opacity in text, but then we could just set it to use the black with an opacity of 87% perhaps according to Material Design specs?\n\nAlthough it's not easy because we have to consider the compatibility with oomox... :P\n\nI've tried to use oomox with this theme to create my own. But in my opinion the integration with oomox is a bit too lackluster currently to be useful. I had a hard time changing the settings to what I wanted them to be. I felt like materia-theme was adapting to oomox when imo it should be the other way around. Omoox should let you change the colors defined in the SASS files instead of having another less configurable layer on top of it.\nI'll only be able to try the changes you mentioned next month as I'm currently studying for my finals till the end of June.. > So, can we close this now?\nFeel free to, but I feel like this issue should perhaps be used to track the feature you described (or make a new issue):\n\nI'm also considering using Sass function to automatically change the foreground color according to the brightness of the background color.

    "PJSingh5000": "@Whnr,\nWhy do you say that the dot is extra?\nWithout the dot, how would you identify which icon represents the app that currently has focus?\n(Note, in your image, the Firefox icon is highlighted because you are hovering over it. But if you move your mouse pointer away from it, it will only have dot(s) on the left side, and will look like all the other apps that are currently running).\nIf nana-4 wants to change this then there must be a different way to visually distinguish the currently focused application from other running applications in the Dock. I see two options:\n1. One option is to highlight the currently focused application's icon in the same background color as the hover highlight. (The currently running app would be visually indistinguishable from a hovered app, but the user would know that something is highlighted due to hover, because the mouse pointer would be directly on that icon when hovering).\n2. Another option may to be to highlight the currently running app with a background that uses the theme's primary color, but with transparency. This will make it look different than a hovered app icon which has a whitish transparent background.\nOn a side note, I noticed in your screenshot that the colored dots on the left are superimposed on top of white \"running\" dots. Do you have the Dash-to-Dock extension, and have you (on the Appearance tab in the settings dialog) selected something other than \"Default\" for the \"Customize windows counter indicators\" option? For some reason Materia (and other themes) don't seem to play well with this option. Dash-to-Dock and the Theme BOTH try to draw these dots. The colored dots on the left are from Dash-to-Dock, and the white dots (hidden on the left, visible on the right) are from Materia.\n. Good news!. > Could you also report to the maintainers of GTK+?\nThat's a good idea.\nI will do that.\n(Thanks for looking into this!). Here is the upstream bug report:\nhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/1387\n. FYI...\nThe developer of the Printers extension has fixed this issue and is currently awaiting approval for the extension to be published. See: https://github.com/linux-man/gnome-shell-extension-printers/issues/9#issuecomment-427508951\nNo response for the Clipboard Indicator extension, but I have posted a fix here, in case anyone wants to fix this on their own system: https://github.com/Tudmotu/gnome-shell-extension-clipboard-indicator/issues/141#issuecomment-427615665. Here is additional information.\nOther themes seem to address this issue to varying degrees of success.\nArc theme does an excellent job.\nWould it be possible to mimic the Arc theme solution for the Materia theme?...\n- Outline the checkbox in white, and fill the entire inside of the checkbox with white.\n- The check mark is colored using the theme's primary or secondary color.\n- If a checkbox is inactive, then the outline and fill color are shaded/duller/opaque.\nHere is a comparison between Adapta and Arc...\n\n\nAdapta Theme (Active Checked Check-box)\nDoes a good job of handling active check-boxes.\n\n\n\nAdapta Theme (Inctive Checked Check-box)\nBUT... Does a bad job of handling inactive check-boxes.\nNotice that the inactive checked check-box in the second column is not visible at all.\n\n\n\nArc-Darker Theme (Active Checked Check-box)\nDoes a good job of handling active check-boxes.\n\n\n\nArc-Darker Theme (Inctive Checked Check-box)\nALSO... Does a good job of handling inactive check-boxes.\nNotice that BOTH the active/checked and the inactive/checked check-boxes are visible when the row is selected.\n\n\n\n. I appreciate you looking into this.\nThere are four different scenarios that need to be tested for check-boxes.\n1. Active, checked check-box with hover selection\n2. Active, unchecked check-box with hover selection\n3. Inactive, checked check-box with hover selection\n4. Inactive, unchecked check-box with hover selection\nThese same four scenarios need to be tested for radio-buttons, as well.\nSince gtk3-widget-factory doesn't show all four scenarios, here is a little test program written in Python. The program allows you to hover over each row in order to see what the check-boxes look like.\n(To keep the program short, it only shows check-boxes, not radio-buttons, and you can't actually check or un-check the check-boxes).\n\nCopy and save both files as test_291.py and test_291.ui, respectively, in the same directory. \nOpen a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the files.\nInstall Python if you don't have it (sudo apt install python3.6).\nMake sure test_291.py is executable (chmod +x ./test_291.py).\nThen launch by typing ./test_291.py.\n\n\n\n\ntest_291.py\n```\n!/usr/bin/python3\nimport gi\ngi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nclass MainWindowHandlers(Gtk.Window):\n    def on_destroy(self, *args):\n        Gtk.main_quit()\nbuilder = Gtk.Builder()\nbuilder.add_from_file(\"test_291.ui\")\nhandlers = MainWindowHandlers()\nbuilder.connect_signals(handlers)\nwindow = builder.get_object('window')\nlist_store = builder.get_object('list_store')\nlist_store.append([True, True, 'Test active, checked check-box with hover selection.'])\nlist_store.append([True, False, 'Test active, unchecked check-box with hover selection.'])\nlist_store.append([False, True, 'Test inactive, checked check-box with hover selection.'])\nlist_store.append([False, False, 'Test inactive, unchecked check-box with hover selection.'])\nwindow.show()\nGtk.main()\n```\n\ntest_291.ui\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<interface>\n  <requires lib=\"gtk+\" version=\"3.20\"/>\n  <object class=\"GtkListStore\" id=\"list_store\">\n    <columns>\n      <!-- column-name None - Decide if the checkbox is active (not displayed)-->\n      <column type=\"gboolean\"/>\n      <!-- column-name Yes/No? - Show checkbx as checked or unchecked -->\n      <column type=\"gboolean\"/>\n      <!-- column-name Description - Discription of checkbox state -->\n      <column type=\"gchararray\"/>\n    </columns>\n  </object>\n  <object class=\"GtkWindow\" id=\"window\">\n    <property name=\"can_focus\">False</property>\n    <property name=\"border_width\">18</property>\n    <signal name=\"destroy\" handler=\"on_destroy\" swapped=\"no\"/>\n    <child>\n      <placeholder/>\n    </child>\n    <child>\n      <object class=\"GtkTreeView\" id=\"tree_view\">\n        <property name=\"visible\">True</property>\n        <property name=\"can_focus\">True</property>\n        <property name=\"model\">list_store</property>\n        <property name=\"hover_selection\">True</property>\n        <child internal-child=\"selection\">\n          <object class=\"GtkTreeSelection\" id=\"tree_selection\"/>\n        </child>\n        <child>\n          <object class=\"GtkTreeViewColumn\" id=\"tree_view_column_1\">\n            <property name=\"sizing\">autosize</property>\n            <property name=\"min_width\">10</property>\n            <property name=\"title\" translatable=\"yes\">Yes/No?</property>\n            <property name=\"clickable\">True</property>\n            <child>\n              <object class=\"GtkCellRendererToggle\" id=\"cell_renderer_1\"/>\n              <attributes>\n                <attribute name=\"activatable\">0</attribute>\n                <attribute name=\"active\">1</attribute>\n              </attributes>\n            </child>\n          </object>\n        </child>\n        <child>\n          <object class=\"GtkTreeViewColumn\" id=\"tree_view_column_2\">\n            <property name=\"title\" translatable=\"yes\">Description</property>\n            <property name=\"clickable\">True</property>\n            <child>\n              <object class=\"GtkCellRendererText\" id=\"cell_renderer_2\"/>\n              <attributes>\n                <attribute name=\"text\">2</attribute>\n              </attributes>\n            </child>\n          </object>\n        </child>\n      </object>\n    </child>\n  </object>\n</interface>\n.

Good progress! I'll see if I can come up with something to test the switches..

and click the Apply button.\nToggle the switch \"on\" and \"off\" to see how it appears with the changed background.\nUnless someone creates a custom CellRenderer widget, this situation should never

OK...\nJust be careful... in cases where the highlight color is too close to the primary color, there may not be enough contrast. This does happen with default Materia where we have the cyan (primary) and blue (highlight) and  colors.\nI recall from the Materia Design guideline that they recommend selecting three different complementary colors (colors that provide contrast between each-other; in other words, colors that are opposite each other on a color wheel).\nUsing complementary colors may be desirable for a website (or for marketing and branding purposes), but is not always practical for an OS. For an OS you may not want colors that are not too different from each other, because your goal is to minimize distractions and introduce consistency.\nAnyway, with the suggested 0.26 transparency, it may look OK.  (I'd like to see what it looks like).\nPersonally, I did like Potato-Kun's original idea of inverting the widget outline color to white. :). Thank You! I really appreciate the thoughtful work you have put into this particular bug and into this theme (which in my humble opinion is the best out there!).\nSome observations:\n\n\nThe rounded corners on the selected item in the Nautilus sidebar is beautiful. (It would be nice to see this treatment in all lists; I don't know if that is possible?).\n\n\nI think there may be some unintended side-effects. For example, I selected text in this web page. The selected ext was highlighted in light blue. When I switched to another application, leaving the text highlighted, the highlight color turned black. Is this normal/expected?\n\n\nThe lower contrast between the text and the lighter highlighted background is a little hard on my eyes. For example, the blue-on-blue in Nautilus below, is hard to distinguish from two feet away; I did notice that it is not as bad in the example at material.io, because of the dark purple text they used. I think I need to use this new design little more to get used to it. :)\n\n\nHere is a picture of the rounded highlighted corners of selected items in Nautilus. Very nice!...\n\n. oct2pus,\nJust to be clear, you are asking Materia theme to remove all running dots, so they can only be drawn by the Dash-to-Dock or the Dash-to-Panel extensions?\nIn your screen shots, there two different versions of running dots being displayed simultaneously:\n1. One set is drawn by Dash-to-Dock, using the Metro style.\n2. Another set drawn by Gnome-shell using the Materia theme (these are white).\n(By the way, this also happens in the Ubuntu dock extension with the default theme as well; the dots from the extension and the ones from the theme overly on top of each other, so it is not noticeable. However, if you open lots of applications the two sets of running dots become misaligned and you can actually see them).\nWhat happens if you disable your Dash-to-Dock extension? I presume the white dots drawn by the theme are be the only ones remaining?\nIf the theme supplies transparent running dot assets, or simply removes them, users not using the Dash-to-Dock extension would see no running dots at all.\nThe solution would need to support users who do not use a \"dock\" extension.\nTherefore, the theme would need to detect if an extension is drawing its own dots. If there is no extension, the theme would have to provide the running dots.\nFinally, I wonder if this is a bug in the Dash-to-Dock or the Dash-to-Panel extensions? May be something can be done on that side? Or perhaps Gnome-shell should be intelligent enough to know if an extension is supplying its own running dots, and stop displaying the ones from the current theme.. What does the Gnome-Dash look like if you disable Dash-to-Dock, but keep the User-Themes extension?\nWhat would the Gnome-Dash look like if Materia theme completely removed the indicators, and you disable Dash-to-Dock, but kept the User-Themes extension?\n. In the Adwaita and Adwaita-dark themes, when path-bar text is made inactive in a header bar, it becomes slightly darker.\nIn the Materia theme, the path-bar text becomes very dark.\nHowever, buttons or labels in the header bar are OK, so this only affects path-bars.\n. I wonder if there is a more formal way to use the files under /usr/share/gnome-shell/modes ?\nHere are the files in this directory...\nmodes\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 initial-setup.json\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ubuntu.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 yaru.json\nCan we create a materia.json file and place it here?\nPreviously (Ubuntu 18.04), you could use update-alternatives --config gdm3.css to configure which gnome-shell.css file was used, but that no longer seems to be effective. So there must be a different way to configure which *.json file in modules is used (and effectively chose the gnome-shell.css file)???. nana-4, ddnexus,\nHow about something like this?\nI think it is more elegant than overwriting files.\nThe user can install as many themes as he/she wants and easily switch between them.\nThis approach allows the user to use a GUI to chose which theme he/she wants to use.\n(I listed the commands in steps 1, 3, and 4 explicitly, just to make it clear.

I have a script, and I am refining and testing it. I'll simplify it and share it within a coule of days.. I do install gnome-session, and and then choose Gnome Session on the GDM screen. \nThat may be the part that you were missing when you tested?\n(To ensure this Gnome Session is always used, I typically remove everything from /usr/share/xsessions except gnome-xorg.desktop).\nI'll investigate if there is a nice way to do this without update-alternatives, and I'll share if I come up with something and let you guys judge if it's worthwhile.. I ended up with two scripts. Please let me know what you think?\n\nThe init-switch-themes.sh script sets up theme switching.\nThe switch-theme.sh script switches themes.\n\nThe solution also works for systems that do not have update-alternatives.\nI've tested this on Ubuntu and Arch (Antergos). \n\n\nInstall required packages.\nsudo apt install gnome-shell-common # wasn't necessary on Antergos\n   sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev-bin # glib2 on Antergos\n   sudo apt install bash-completion # if available\n   sudo apt install galternatives # if available\n\n\nInstall the Materia theme, if not already installed. This script works with some other themes as well.\n\n\nRemove or disable the \"User Themes\" extension, if you have it installed.\n\n\nRun the init-switch-themes.sh script to setup theme switching. The script also selects a theme for you, so you don't need to run switch-theme.sh afterwards.\nYou can provide \"hints\" about which theme is automatically selected.\nIf you simply want the script to use your current desktop theme...\nsudo init-switch-themes.sh\n\nIf you want the script to use a dark variant of your current desktop theme...\nsudo init-switch-themes.sh Dark\n\nIf you want the script to explicitly use the Materia theme and use a dark variant...\nsudo init-switch-themes.sh --theme Materia Dark\n\nFor more information on arguments, see the \"Usage\" section in the script comments.\n\n\nReboot.\nOn the GDM login screen, be sure to select \"GNOME on Xorg\" or \"GNOME\" (Wayland).\n\n\nIn the future, you can switch themes using one of these three options:\na. Command line (works on all systems)\nsudo switch-theme.sh\n\nb. Command line (works on Debian based systems like Ubuntu)\nsudo update-alternatives gnome-shell-theme\nsudo update-alternatives gdm3.css\n\nc. Launch Alternatives Configurator application GUI (works on Debian bases systems like Ubuntu).\ninit-switch-themes.sh\n\n\n```\n!/bin/bash\nSetup themes so the user can easily switch themes for:\n\n1. Gnome Shell (top bar, dash, and lock screen)\n2.

Launch the Alternatives Configurator application.\n2. Select the desired theme from the \"gnome-shell-theme\" group.\n\nRequired Prerequisites:\n\n- Be sure to select \"GNOME on Xorg\" or \"GNOME\" (Wayland) on the GDM screen, so\nthe top bar, dash, and lock screen theme will work.\n$ sudo apt install gnome-shell-common\n\n- Required for glib-compile-resources, used by this script.\n$ sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev-bin\n\n- Disable or uninstall the User Themes extension\n\nRequired Prerequisites for Debian based systems:\n\n- Used for Update Alternatives (command line theme selection)\n$ sudo apt install bash-completion\n\nOptional Prerequisites:\n\n- Used for Update Alternatives (command line theme selection)\n$ sudo apt install bash-completion\n\n- Used for Alternatives Configurator (GUI theme selection)\n$ sudo apt install galternatives\n\n- Used to change the user's desktop theme (i.e. the theme used for window\ndecorations)\n$ sudo apt install gnome-tweaks # to set desktop theme\n\nExample themes this script works with:\n\n- Arc Theme (only for GDM)\n$ sudo apt install arc-theme\n\n- Materia Theme\n$ sudo apt install materia-gtk-theme\n\n- Adapta Theme\n$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tista/adapta\n$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install adapta-gtk-theme\n\nGlobal Static Variables\n\nshell_link=\"/usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource\"\nshell_name=\"gnome-shell-theme\"\nUse for systems with update-alternatives\ngdm_link_1=\"/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/gdm3.css\"\ngdm_name_1=\"gdm3.css\"\nUse for systems without update-alternatives\ngdm_link_2=\"/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/gnome-shell.css\"\ngdm_name_2=\"gnome-shell.css\"\n\nFunctions\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBackup original gnome-shell-theme.gresource file\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis function creates a directory called gnome-shell for the Adwaita-dark\ntheme in /usr/share/themes. It copies the gnome-shell-theme.gresource file and\nthe gnome-shell.css file from /usr/share/gnome-shell/ into this new directory.\nThis is done so that the add_alternatives function will treat Adwaita-dark\nlike other the themes.\n\nThis function also renames the gnome-shell-theme.gresource file in\n/usr/share/gnome-shell/ as gnome-shell-theme-original.gresource. This is done\nso that gnome-shell-theme.gresource can be a link to a gresource file in the\nselected theme directory under /usr/share/themes. (See the add_alternatives\nfunction).\n\nThis function assumes that gnome-shell-theme.gresource and gnome-shell.css\nare the original files for Adwaita.

OK, thx! :). darcn181,\nFor me, this bug has been a major usability issue; most annoyingly, it shows up on the \"Save As\" dialog box, since you can't see the name or location of the file you are about to save.\nYour tip above has helped to at least make the text color white, so I can see it.\nIn the file, /usr/share/themes/Materia-Papirus/gtk-3.0/gtk.css, I changed the following lines...\nheaderbar entry,\nheaderbar spinbutton,\nheaderbar button {\n  margin-top: 6px;\n  margin-bottom: 6px;\n}\n...to...\nheaderbar entry,\nheaderbar spinbutton,\nheaderbar button {\n  margin-top: 6px;\n  margin-bottom: 6px;\n  color: white;\n  background-color: alpha (CurrentColor, 0.1);\n}\nI'm really looking forward to this getting fixed properly. :). ...Humm, this doesn't affect the entry field of the filechooser  (Save As Dialog) headerbar.\nAny suggestion on what I can tweak to fix that?. nana-4,\nDoes Materia 2 dictate that the \"X\" button should be rendered separately from the entry field?\nOr can it be rendered inside the entry field the way the \"down triangle\" is rendered in the \"Area\" field of the screenshot below?\n\n. Update:\nThis issue is only with drop-down combo boxes (GtkComboBox).\nThe entry fields (GtkEntry) are fine and do have the thick \"blue\" underline when hovered.\nHere is a screenshot of a text entry field (GtkEntry) from a file chooser dialog showing the colored underline...\n\nAnd here is the Gnome Tweaks window with combo boxes (GtkComboBox).

    "darcn181": "XFCE is currently moving to GTK3+, so i don't think @nana-4 is going to start doing theming for GTK2+, i started theming the xfce panel since it started using GTK3+ and was able to get good results, it's now a dark panel in a light theme\n\nIt includes animations, with the animations it doesn't even look like it's actually xfce panel. The overall look of my version is not that much \"material\", but it looks good so i don't care.\n. I was able to fix the issue by changing the line 2725 to color: white;\n\nDo i make a PR then?\n. The active one shows correctly with my change\n\nExcept the inactive one\n\nI'll have a look into it, if you could make another test program but with switches it would help more imo.\nUPDATE\nSeems the line that causes problems in the inactive check is 2731. Changed to \ncolor: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);\nAnd here's the result.\n\n. @PJSingh5000 Updated comment with solution, check it out!. The rows should look the same as they always have the highlight color as background (The green), so everything should look the same in the light variant as in the dark one.\nHere's a pic\n\n. I actually meant about the switches, @nana-4 said that the switches need a fix too, but i'll try to fix it without  a program. Nonetheless i'm going to try your program and see if the radio buttons are broken or something.\nUpdate\nSeems that the radio buttons are fixed already.. Hey @nana-4 what program did you use that showed the switch in a row?\n@PJSingh5000 Rows appear too on .sidebars, maybe there?\nthe only thing i've come up with to fix the switches is these lines\n.view:selected switch:checked slider {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: white;\n}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ or ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nrow:selected switch:checked slider {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: white;\n}\nI haven't tried them though. Don't worry, i'm here to help, the lines in my last comment (the ones that say row) would fix the issue though, but i want to see the new design you have in mind.. Looks good to me, seems better than before tbh.\nWill this affect rows in sidebars?. Ok. this is what i understand, Every selected item will have a color like blue which will be used in text or in the image, this CurrentColor will be applied to the background using 0.26 transparency, and images and text will have the same color.. Don't worry, it will look just fine, here's my version, i have a border on the left though\n\n. Wow, new materia looks awesome, nice job @nana-4, looks weird sometimes though\n\nAnd you should fix the xfce panel, you can use .xfce4-panel or #XfcePanelWindow, buttons just need it's backgroud-color changed to transparent, like this\n\nBut that's another issue and it should go to it's own thread, i would make a PR that fixes all the issues but i'm not sure about it\n. @nana-4 what i meant is that,  the text color is white in the unchecked buttons\n\nThe underline looks just fine on my end, i said that you should make the buttons transparent because of the white text and because this makes all elements on the panel transparent, so people can change the color of the panel and it will change the buttons too, supposing that you make the text of the panel black (which you should make it like that on the light variant of the theme) this is how it would look\n\nSo then people can change the panel color to white and it will look good, like this\n\nOr green for whatever reason.\n\nI would take out the shadows of the buttons too imo, and as it has a bottom border like all .flat things it would follow more the Material Design Guidelines. I was gonna report the issue and had a little surprise, i was using tilix and noticed it with  the dark theme. The text entries look weird.\n\nSo i went in to the inspector and tried to fix it by myself and this is what i got.\n\nIt follows the Material Design guidelines the only thing shady is the code, but since only i use it, i don't care.\nHere's the code i used in the inspector\n```\nheaderbar box.linked.horizontal entry {\n    color: white;\n    background-color: alpha (CurrentColor, 0.1);\n    box-shadow: none;\n        border-bottom: 2px solid white;\n    border-radius: 2px 0px 0px 0px;\n}\nheaderbar box.linked.horizontal button.popup {\n    color: white;\n    background-color: alpha (CurrentColor, 0.1);\n    border-radius: 0px 2px 2px 0px;\n        border-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at center calc(100% - 1px), white 100%, transparent 0%) 0 0 2/0 2 2px;\n}\n```\nThat's only for tilix and some apps though, if you want them to look like that globally i think it should work with this\n```\nheaderbar entry {\n        color: white;\n    background-color: alpha (CurrentColor, 0.1);\n    box-shadow: none;\n        border-bottom: 2px solid white;\n    border-radius: 2px 2px 0px 0px;\n}\n```. I think it should be fixed if you add it to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css instead of the theme's original file.\nBut if that doesn't fix the issue try the code in the gtk inspector under the css tab. I can't test it myself since i don't have those headerbars because i use xfce.. My ideas on how to resolve this issue:\n\n\nMake the text color change to black\n\n\nMake the button's background color #212121 and if the user wants this buttons transparent (for use in transparent panels) leave that button state when flat buttons are enabled (just as it is right now). \n\n",

Thanks for the reply, I do find the difference in colors between buttons and other controls (entry, combobox, etc) to be distracting and much prefer the old look.

    "tliron": "Actually, looking closely it is not just Tilix, and it's not exactly bold. I just noticed it most there. It seems that everywhere Materia causes fonts to be heavier. Do you know what causes this? Switching to a theme like Arc makes the issue disappear immediately.. This had no effect (I restarted GNOME Shell). Is there somewhere in the Materia theme CSS that I can change the weight?. Thank you for your detailed response! I tried commenting out those lines (from gtk-3.0/gtk.css), but the problem remains. I also tried debugging with GtkInspector, but I could not find any property anywhere that would cause this effect. Very confusing! I'm attaching two images (Adwaita and Materia) to show you what's happening.\n\n\n. The end effect is darker, but if you look closely it's either due to added weight or some change in anti-aliasing. It might seem subtle, but in everyday work it does make Materia unusable for me. I would be happy to patch it myself, but first we need to figure out what is causing this. Removing the font-weight css did not change this.\nDo you have some ideas that I can add as css overrides to GtkInspector to try it out?. Can you explain what you mean? Where would I change that in css?. This changes the colors for most things ... but not the terminal font. It seems that terminal font css comes from somewhere else. Actually you can try it yourself in GNOME terminal (Tilix uses the same VT widget).. Overriding seems to work. But it seems that the defaults are somehow different in Materia as compared to other GTK themes.. If I set Tilix to use the internal color scheme, it is consistent across all GTK themes. But if I set Tilix to use \"Use theme colors for foreground/background\", then the problem appears. By the way, the Materia CSS does include some custom theming for Tilix.. By \"problem\" I mean the issue you can see in my attached photos above, which now we realize is probably due to a wrong \"black\" color.\nThere's no need to create a special theme for Tilix: actually, it already includes a material theme and there are many community themes. However ... the included material theme is dark, and I personally prefer my terminal to match the desktop theme (I use the default Materia, which is light). So I always have \"Use theme colors for foreground/background\" set and I'm usually happy with whatever GTK theme I use ... except Materia which has this issue. :). Well, you asked about \"favorite\" -- specifically we are talking about the terminal inheriting the GTK theme. It's not always my favorite, but it is matching. :). Thanks @nana-4, I would be happy to help test. I'll subscribe to #157. Thanks also @actionless for your assistance!. For what it's worth, I found the base16 Tilix themes to have quite a few that are a good match for Materia. There is even a theme called \"Materia\", though I don't think it's related to this project.. @actionless Thanks, there are quite a lot of themes already included in the repo linked above.. ",
