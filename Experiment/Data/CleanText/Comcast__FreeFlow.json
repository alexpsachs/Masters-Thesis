Can you share some code where it does seem to be broken?\n. Just to test it, I copied the QuiltLayout class to my artbook project and that seems to work, including scrolling. So your loadData() does some async thing. So where are you calling invalidateData() ?\n. Is the container the entire width and height of the activity?\n. I am not exactly sure what your layout is doing, kinda fuzzy on what canvas.clippath does.

Btw, yeah looks like setting margins and padding will clip your content.
