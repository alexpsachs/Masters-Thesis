Hi, I updated the README.\n. I'm sorry, it's updated now.\n. Thanks for your pull request! It has been merged!\n. Thanks!\n. Please use Pulsator which is the new version of this PulsingHalo written with Swift. It has stop method.\n.

I'm sorry for late, supported resuming on 0.2.4, thanks!. @bhushanb02 thank you so much for this PR. I supported resuming in the PulsingHaloLayer class now. thanks again!. @sandman4sure thanks, i didn't know that problem. I just updated the podspec, could you try this?.

In the latest version there was an addition starting on line 105 in PulsionHaloLayer.m of the CAAnimationGroup delegate method.  This method seems to be called when pushing a view controller or presenting one which in turn removes the animation.  I added the if (flag) then remove the animations as that signals the animation is truly done.  I am unsure if this is correct but for now until I revisit the code it will have to do.  Below is my code for that method which would not remove the animation when a view controller is pushed or presented.\n- (void)animationDidStop:(CAAnimation *)anim finished:(BOOL)flag {\n  if (flag)\n  {\n      [self removeAllAnimations];\n      [self removeFromSuperlayer];\n  }\n  }\n.
