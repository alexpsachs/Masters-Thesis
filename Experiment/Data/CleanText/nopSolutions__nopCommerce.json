    "mohsen2hasani": "@AndreiMaz \nHi Andrei\nCan you guide me to Implement this feature?\n2 month later i implement this feature for nop 3.90, because in my company, we have some custom currency and we need this feature, but, some other feature like additional prices and discounts are processed by main price.\nI added currency to \"Tier prices\" and when admin entered price row, he can select currency ....\nbut i use static price code for my purpose, and if you want and help me, i want to implement this feature and commit codes for nopcommerce.\nsorry for my bad English and thank you.. ",
    "shurub3l": "When is this going to be implemented? We really need this feature in the near future. I am also available to help develop it if needed.. I have a written a plugin that uses Lucene.Net. How can I send it to you? It still needs to be a bit improved.\n. This is a must.\n. I think the welcome email should be sent automatically upon account activation.. There is a plugin for this. You can find it here: http://www.nopcommerce.com/p/986/restricted-to-store-discount-requirement-rule.aspx\n. I don't know exactly why they decided to add it as a plugin. I made a pull request to add the store discounts feature. We'll see if they accept it.\n. For example, the PlaceOrder method from OrderProcessingService uses #region 3 times. The best practice says you shouldn't use regions inside methods. Methods should be short and each method should do only one thing. So instead of separating the method into 3 regions, you should refactor into 3 or more separate methods.\nPlease also read the StackExchange answer and the article I referenced above for more info.. The PlaceOrder method is not the only place where region is used inside methods, that's why the title was more general.\nHere are other places where #region is used inside methods: Authorize in ExternalAuthorizer, FormatStockMessage in ProductExtensions, SearchProducts in ProductService, GetProductCount in ProductTagService, PrintOrdersToPdf in PdfService, DeleteGuestCustomers in CustomerService, InstallProducts in CodeFirstInstallationService, ProductListToHtmlTable in MessageTokenProvider. And the list can go on ...\nAlso the constants, fields, properties and constructor are always in the same order so I don't think the use of #region is required.\nAnd #region is also used in some classes to group some related methods. For example, in CustomerService you have 2 regions: Customers and Customer roles. I think the Customer roles region should be moved to it's own CustomerRoleService and so the use of #region will not be necessary.. I don't know if that is the case. For example, in my production database, right at this moment I have 1.874.532 guest customers (I haven't deleted them in a while), and only 69.957 generic attributes with EuCookieLaw.Accepted (and these are not filtered by the customer role, these are for all the customers). So not every user closes the cookie warning.\nBut, I agree, another possible solution would be to save a cookie just for the EUCookieLaw notification.. But I need a newer version of AutoMapper, that's the problem ... I could update Nop.Admin to use the newer version aswell, but I don't have access to the third party plugin that also uses AutoMapper 4.1.1.. I found a workaround for my problem. I changed the code to compare full assembly name when checking if an assembly is already loaded and, I added in web.config a codeBase element for every AutoMapper version. This way the different version nuget package assembly is not skipped when loading assemblies and every assembly is loaded from the correct file path.\nSo the method IsAlreadyLoaded from PluginManager becomes:\n```c#\nprivate static bool IsAlreadyLoaded(FileInfo fileInfo)\n{\n    //compare full assembly name\n    try\n    {\n        var fileAssemblyName = AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName(fileInfo.FullName);\n        foreach (var a in AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies())\n        {\n            if (a.FullName.Equals(fileAssemblyName.FullName, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))\n                return true;\n        }\n    }\n    catch (Exception exc)\n    {\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"Cannot validate whether an assembly is already loaded. \" + exc);\n    }\n    return false;\n//do not compare the full assembly name, just filename\n//try\n//{\n//    string fileNameWithoutExt = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(fileInfo.FullName);\n//    if (fileNameWithoutExt == null)\n//        throw new Exception(string.Format(\"Cannot get file extnension for {0}\", fileInfo.Name));\n//    foreach (var a in AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies())\n//    {\n//        string assemblyName = a.FullName.Split(new[] { ',' }).FirstOrDefault();\n//        if (fileNameWithoutExt.Equals(assemblyName, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))\n//            return true;\n//    }\n//}\n//catch (Exception exc)\n//{\n//    Debug.WriteLine(\"Cannot validate whether an assembly is already loaded. \" + exc);\n//}\n//return false;\n\n}\n```\nAnd added this in web.config file from Nop.Web:\nxml\n<dependentAssembly>\n  <assemblyIdentity name=\"AutoMapper\" publicKeyToken=\"be96cd2c38ef1005\" culture=\"neutral\" />\n  <codeBase version=\"6.1.1.0\" href=\"Plugins\\Integration.ServiceBus\\AutoMapper.dll\" />\n  <codeBase version=\"4.1.1.0\" href=\"bin\\AutoMapper.dll\" />\n</dependentAssembly>. What is the issue number? I can't find it.. Ok. Thanks.. ",

I have 700  Specification Attributes(For Mobile Phones, For Cars, for Pc , ....), and it is necessary to identify each group in the future, I think it is necessary to add this functionality in the next release. This feature will be available in version 3.9?. i'm sorry but how? \nwith import/export product , product attributes is  import/export- ing with  product?. and what about import/export product attributes ?. \n\nbut there is not import/export function\n. This feature will be available in version 3.9?. Sorry but You write wrong Title\nTitle is Like \"Product Attributes & Specification Attributes Import/Export Support\". @AndreiMaz i need to input Specification Attribute \"Resolution\"\nthis is the list\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_resolutions\nand i need to do this, because Nopcommerce dont have support IMPORT/EXPORT Specification Atributes.\nThis is only one Attribute, but in my store they more then 700.. This feature will be available in version 3.9?. I think same problem in Product Attributes  when exporting Product. @YuriyZaletskyy  when import/export Products  the system import/export Product parameters and Product Attribute parameters but not support import/export Product Specification Attributes:\nExample:\nProduct: CAR                                                                                                   ( import/export Support) \nProduct Attribute:Color            Option1:White  Option2:Black                       ( import/export Support)\nProduct Specification Attribute1: Body Type         Option:Sedan                      Not Support  \nProduct Specification Attribute2: GearBox Type    Option:Manual                     Not Support . i create, Sample Product Name is \"Product import/export. Support specification attributes\". yes, try export this product , then import again .\nAnd compare that products.. @skoshelev can you share product with specification attributes exported Excel  template file?. @skoshelev thanks Sergey \nBut how do we know SpecificationAttributeOptionId? SpecificationAttributeOptionId in version 3.9 not show in admin area. \nSpecificationAttributeOptionId will be show in 4.0 version?. We can Add \"Map to Category\" area in manufacturer details page. Car is a Example , its can be Froot, Mobile Phone or Real Estate. Now What We Have\n\n. I suggest add Grouping Specification Attributes , and function to add SubOptions \n\n. like in Example: Country>>City>>District>>Address. Example http://demo.aspxcommerce.com.

Thanks. @AndreiMaz  we can create SubLayer for Manufacturer and set name For example Model, set for model specifications, and then connect to Product(as we do with connecting Manufacturer to product).\nFor example Manufacturer>>Apple\nModel1>> Iphone 6\nModel2 >> Iphone 7\nwe cane create Specifications for Iphone 6 and Iphone 7\nwhen we create product By Name \"Iphone 6 from MyStore\"\nwe can connect to Model1 and Product inherit same Specifications. in Excel , i write ID from 1 to 200\nBut in Database imported from ID 1000 to 1200 . If i cant import by ID , so i cant import SubCategory whith Parent Category in same time. Let ability to create Virtual Group of Products, Virtual Group of Users, Virtual Group of Permissions\nAnd Map this Groups\n. add 360 degree picture viewer\nexample http://www.webrotate360.com/. example viewer\nhttps://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum. or\nhttps://github.com/leandigo/leanorama. Make Category and manufacturer default values configurable #669\nis it that work item?. Same problem when Language in Admin are set for example Russian , and  we go to Specification Attributes, there showing in Standard , but need Russian.\nSame problem in Product Attributes .. configurable- its Good\nBecause multilanguage needs to Costumers and Vendors.. in product page when we map to Categoryes, Categories Localizable values support . For example in product page write Call For Price.\nCostumer think , Call Vendor , Call Store owner , or search other contact.\nanother situation when Vendor sale Mobile Phones and Cars, but for Mobile Phones costumer need to call to Number1 and for Cars to Number2. i think Vendor can have phone number list:\nAnd when in product page Vendor check Call For Price he can select number from his number list. and ability login with Phone Number an Password. please see\nhttps://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/phone-auth. it's very important function for information security, we can add as default plugin or import to Nopcommerce. we can use http://imageprocessor.org/. it's more User Friendly View, we can add in default Template . we have Role - Costumer(System Default Role for Customers)\nwe have Role - Vendor(System Default Role for Vendors)\nwe create new Role by name Role2 \nRole2- is Vendor or is Costumer?\nAbility to set Role2 - Default Role for Customers or Vendors. when we create a new Role, lets add checkbox \"Show in Registration\"\nand let ability to Users in Registration procedure choose - Costumer, Vendor or new Role.. Can be \"refurbished\" ; \"For parts or not working\". Now we have fixed Delivery Dates for Product.\nBut we can choose Shipping method.\nExample: We have 2 shipping methods and customer can choose what shipping method he want.\nFirst shipping method By Car, Second By Air\nwe need to ship from Moscow to Paris.\nBy Car it take 15 days\nBy Air 2 days\nWhat we can do? if Shipping method not fixed but Delivery Date fixed?. @AndreiMaz we can do it only for offline shipping metods . For Example i have 2 Pickup store, in Moscow and in New York.\nBut product can be only on Moscow store, but Customer can select New York Pickup Store.\nWhat can i do?)))) send product to New York?\ni think needs Limitation . Vendor can have PickUp Point list.\nand in product page when Vendor select Enable  PickUp Point , then chose PickUp Points for this product.. Store Have Pickup Points, but Vendor can create own Pickup Point. For example \"group of vendors\"  can add products only to allowed categories, add to product only alowed attributes,specifications, shipping method, payment method and else.. only allow Sample Functions to Add Product.\nDisable  Product Type: Only Sample(can be hiden)\nDisable Visible individually: Only Chacked (can be Chacked and Hiden)\nDisable SKU\nDisable GTIN\nDisable Show on home page\nDisable Allow customer reviews\nDisable Mark as new\nDisable Gift card\nDisable Downloadable product\nDisable Recurring product\nDisable Product cost\nDisable \"Disable buy button\"( Disable buy button always Chacked and Hiden)\nDisable \"Disable wishlist button\"\nDisable Available for pre-order \nDisable Customer enters price\nDisable PAngV (base price) enabled\nDisable Discounts \nDisable Tax exempt\nDisable Tax category  \nDisable Telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services  \nDisable Tier prices\nDisable Inventory\nDisable Shipping\nDisable Limited to stores\nDisable Vendor\nDisable Access control list\nDisable Require other products\nDisable Product Attributes\nLimitation Group of Specification Attributes for Costumers\nCan be out of Admin area, Like Topic Page for Costumers to add Product.\n. we don't need to add access to Admin Area, only need new page For adding products.. in Costumer area can be split by Categories. Image 1\n\nImage 2\n\n. Now the style is One for all categories(Subcategories of Cars is show 3 categories in 1 line)\nbut need ability to configure subcategories size in category(in second picture Subcategories of Cars is show 6 categories in 1 line ). Now we can change in CSS, but for all categories.\nBut need to be Configurable for each category. . Configurable Catalog Mode\nits can be like Product Template for Catalog mode. and administrator can set permission for vendor- permission to use Catalog products or/and  permission to create Product. Like in Prestoshop - Catalog Mode\nin Multi Store Mode  we can set one store as Catalog , other store as Full e-commerce mode. For example I have Product by Name \"Volkswagen Golf 2003 - 2009, 5 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 / \u0445\u0435\u0442\u0447\u0431\u044d\u043a 5-\u0434\u0432.\"\nAnd the product have many Modifications, and every Modification have Specification like in image\n\n. we can add this option in Admin area>>Catalog>>Products>>\"Product\">>Specification attributes>>Add a new product specification attribute>>Attribute type>>by name \"Option Mapped to Product Attribute\"\nand when we select Attribute type \"Option Mapped to Product Attribute\" show 2 Dropdown lists of Product Attributes and Values.\nFront-end needs to be AJAX technology.. We can change product Import Excel Style. Like this.\n\n. if this issue while done https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2320\nwe can enable this function without risks.. when You export Grouped product only \"ParentGroupedProductId\" are exported\n(i test in http://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/admin/  Product name:\"Nikon D5500 DSLR\"            Id:13\nProduct type: Grouped). i think we need to change Button name or configurable disable it like in sample products.\nbecause costumer click \"Add to Cart\" and details page- false logic. @AndreiMaz maybe rename it .\nfor example \"Go To Product Page\". for example we can in excel file write full name of category like- \"Cat2>>Sub1\" or by Category id. Or in Excel file Categories Column can be selectable by dropdown list, and have 2 values \"CategoriesName\" and \"CategoriesId\" .\nif selected CategoriesName then import by name\nif selected CategoriesId then import by id\n. @Xzelsius only Administrator(root user) have permission to edit Nopcommerce source files.. @Xzelsius Here the hierarchical structure of rights.\n\"What if a administrator (root user) has restricted access to some parts of nopcommerce?\"- this is situation(human factor). @Xzelsius  Add many images in one upload process, use one picture in many products(not upload each time, use uploaded image for many products), ability to have place where you save original images, sample edit functions for images.. For example I sale tomatoes  by PandV , and set price 10$ for 1 kg. And costumer want to by 0.3 kg, 0.5 kg or 1.5 kg .How he can do it???? \nWe need ability to sale not only with quantity, but with weight and volume.. Please see #2615 and #2614 and #2550 . its good function\nits like https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2280\n. Product attribute \"HDD\" can have Sublayers \"Slot1\" \"Slot2\" \"Slot3\"\nAnd for every slot we can choose HDD's\nSame situation in Product attribute \"RAM\" for example i want 2GB in Slot1 and 4GB in Slot2\ni need to create  Product attribute \"RAM in Slot1\" \nand Product attribute \"RAM in Slot2\" \nbut we need ability to create Product attribute \"RAM\" and sublayers   \"Slot1\" and \"Slot2\"\nOr i Buy server and need 12 Windows server CAL license, how can i do it in product attibutes?. another example: i sale 1 liter \"juice\" with product attributes \"Disposable cups\"\nCostumer needs 1 liter \"juice\" and \"X\" quantity \"Disposable cups\"\nHow he can buy?. i close because in 3.9 version we can use associated product option. Example: https://isotope.metafizzy.co/. @AndreiMaz \nFor example Accountant, Content Management Admin, HR, Warehouse Admin, and else?. We can add Front-end validation with HTML and Back-end  validation in Server side.. I think if Nopcommerce support multi language, then plagins also need to support multi language. @AndreiMaz But not all peoples in Russia speak Russian, maybe customer is a tourist [ or Gerard Depardieu))))  ]. @AndreiMaz  i have product, Price 500 USD\ni have 2 currency USD and AMD, USD is prinery\nUSD rate 1 AMD rate is 486\nThen i change USD rate to 1/486=0.002 and AMD rate to 1\nand set primary currency AMD\nthen i go to product page, product price is 500 AMD.\nCan You repeat this action?\n. @media (min-width: 481px)  .item-box  .prices \n{\n    height: 40px;\n}\nits connect with  height: 40px;\ncan we delete that parameter ?. i close because i think its connect with Cache.. & Custom HTML text to. & Value change from Textbox to Multiline Textbox. & ability to edit Value . Example by Default Weight measure is LB and Ratio is 1 , KG  with Ratio 0.45359237.\nWhen we set Default Weight measure to KG auto set ratio to 1, and auto calculate LB rate to 2,20462262\n. @AndreiMaz \"Display notification when measures or dimensions are changed \" is right title?\n. Error massage: Value cannot be null. Parameter name: picture\n. its connect with mime type PNG????. file is exist, permissions is full, any ideas????. add same Column in Categories>>Products tab.. \n. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/01/19/net-core-image-processing/\n. I think it can be configurable.\nMobile or email. Can be add this function to Stores.\nCan be add this function to Vendors.\nCan be add this function to Categories.\nCan be add this function to Products.\nCan be add this function to Shipping methods.\nCan be add this function to Payment methods.. For example, in a multi-store mode, one store can work from 9:00 to 22:00 and the other will work 24 hours.\nIn the shipping, one Shipping method be Available from 9:00 to 22:00 (e.g. Fast food shipping  with Courier) and the other will be Available 24 hours.\nFor example, one vendor can work from 9:00 to 22:00 and the other will work 24 hours.\nAnd so forth, products can Available for Buy for 24 hours or other time, or  payment methods can Available 24 hours or other time.. Online store its not 24/7. \nWeb site and product list can be available 24 hours , and you can buy, but when you buy after work day, shipping will be in next day 9:00.\n. we can have Shipping method -- \"Ship in 30 minutes\" , but available only from 9:00-22:00.\nand we can have Payment method --- Payment can confirmed only from  9:00-22:00(because it confirmed manually  with our workers).\nWe can have Warehouses that open from  9:00-22:00.\nWe can have Vendors who Supply products but they work from  9:00-22:00.\n. https://www.menu.am/en/\nthis is example internet magazine, where vendors have Work time, and Costumer can Buy only in work time.. \n. i think Vendor(all vendor products) need to have Availablety time.\nAnd product Availablety now have parameter Start Date/Time -End Date/Time\ni think need to add parameter Every day from Start Time - End time.. We can create Desktop App with https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET. add parameter(if need) maxlength\nand allow only Digits to write in textbox.(Now in Quantity textbox we can write text ). @AndreiMaz Can we do it Configurable?\n'Phone number' is unique or not. The schedule for EF Core is in-sync with the .NET Core and ASP.NET Core schedule\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Roadmap\nASP.NET Core 2.1 Release  Q1-Q2 2018\ni think EF Core 2.1 Release  will be Q1-Q2 2018\nwhen will  be Nopcommerce 4.1 release???. Good news: announcing-entity-framework-core-2-1-preview-2. .net core 2.1 & entity framework core 2.1  released . @AndreiMaz Hi Andrei, You are right in existing functionality we can add Service as Product, but it will be great to split Products and Services.. @AndreiMaz I think new field or New Template or chekbok(like Rental or Downloadable products) by name Service. Service as a Rental product can have Start Date/Time and End Date/Time, can have Location with map. \n\n. @AndreiMaz Situation: User buy item and select pick-up is store, and 2 peoples came to take the item, how we can identify who buy the item?. @AndreiMaz Now we have Plugin \"Manual (Fixed or By Weight)\" . Can we add this ability to that plugin?\nAnd rename it \"Manual (Fixed or By Weight/Volume/Price)\". @AndreiMaz Can we reopen with new Title(\"Manual (Fixed or By Weight)\" plugin add By Volume and By Price)?. @skoshelev We can don't add id field,  but support import/export prouct attributes and specification attributes whith id in excel/xml .\nNow we can't impor/exportt product attributes or specification attributes.\n2047 . @skoshelev @andreymaz what You think about \"Add Id field\" or issue #2047  . now we have\n\nWe need to find SpecificationAttributeOptionId in database. @AndreiMaz Why You think it's done only once?\nif we need get ID from database, we can disable all import/export functions and share SQL script for importing/exporting directly in sql server)). @AndreiMaz  in most of issues Your answer is \"After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box.\" . Can Nopcommerce community be a part of discussion ? \n. @ngtrian a button Read more, if we have 2 pages, but if more pagination is better .. @AndreiMaz  in Default theme we have 'read more' button for Product Full description?. @AndreiMaz Thanks. Example:\n\n. @AndreiMaz Hi Andrei\n1.i create a category with name \"test\" and save it.\n2. i edit a created category and add Description \"test description\" and click preview button.\n3. In preview page I don't see a Description text.\n4. But when i save it, i see Description text.\nIn Result preview don't work with Description.\nP.S.\nSame situation in product Short and Full Descriptions .. Volume all sellers use in combination Volume-Price (like Weight-Price and else).\nVolume use in shipping, seller can calculate cost of shipping By Volume, By Weight, By Total Price, or with their SUM.\nAll Shipping provider use Volume with Weight.\nExample: product1 with Size 5m X 5m X 5m    with weight 3kg\nproduct2 with Size 5cm x 5cm x 5cm with weight 3kg \nin this functionality we have By Weight and Fixed.\nand 2 product have same shipping cost :\nor we need manually write additional shipping cost:(this not easy if we have many items)\nHow we can calculate the item SIZE and include it in shipping price:\nSituation: I sale Liquid\nDimention i cant use(because i sale Liquid but not Liquid in bottle).\nAnd i dont want use only weight, because in all world liquid selling by VOLUME:\nP.S. \nYou see Coca-Cola by Weight?\n1 Kg Coca-Cola? \n. My shipping provider calculate whit this function\nShipping price= (Weight price+Volume price)-Bonus of Total Price. I use PangV function because i sale FOOD and i don't live in Germany))\n10 gram Product 1 - price is 150$ \n1 gram Product 2 -  price is 20$\nand i sale Liquid my Volume (in all world Liquid sale by Volume)\n1 liter Liquid 1 - price is 10$\n1 gallon  OIL(in USA )\n1 barrel Petroleum(in all world)\ni think PangV function is not only for Germany.\nand i think Volume using in selling like Weight . NopCommerce Team not planing create github issue tracker for plugins created by NopCommerce team? . Disable scroll left-right situations, its not User-Friendly..

By ValueName or ValueID. . if you resize to right , You cant resize back)). Same situation in \"Admin comment\". Same situation in SEO>>Meta description. \n. @AndreiMaz but why textbox go under Right side? we can resize above Right side, or Right side can go more right when we resize.\nor we can disable resize to Right, only allow resize to down,. for testing you can install fresh copy of Nopcommerce 4.0 with Demo Content\nAdd new Language, import language resource  from official English language resource.\nthen go to any Category or Product write Category Name or Product Name on New language(for example Russian).\nthen open that Category or Product in Default Language, then change language to New Language.\nthen you got error.\n. \n. @AndreiMaz if it Bug, can we fix that bug in 4.0 version?. @AndreiMaz Thanks . And add Currency Symbols  in a right side of textbox. \n. we can add Credit Card types like>>Manual , PayPalDirect , Square , WorldpayUS. its  Limited to stores function\ni mean Multi-store configuration for function. i think we need rounding function for rental period .. @AndreiMaz I'm not sure\nin Ebay there is a button \"buy now\" (like add to cart in Nopcommerce), and can have Offer button, customer can send his offer and comments. System give the time for seller respond. Seller can accept , reject, counteroffer, or wait until offer expired.. \n. Sorry all is true. @mariannk  in my pc resolution, when i have 5 themes installed , themes go to right, but needs to be left.\nSorry my mistake  . @AndreiMaz in Admin Area when creating attributes(Catalog>>Attributes>>Product or Specification attributes>>Add New), set limitation for it, in what store it used. @AndreiMaz For example we have 2 stores FOOD and Cars.\nwe have Specification attribute -- Engine.\nWe need to limit that Specification attribute for use only in  Cars store.\n. @AndreiMaz its easy when you have 10 attributes, but when you have 500, its very hard.. @AndreiMaz and no logic, when vendor or admin want to add food product, why he see Engine or Gearbox ?. @AndreiMaz \nThis is small list of specification attributes.(Only Mobile Phones & Real estate specification attributes)\n\n. @AndreiMaz \niDEA\nCan we Group specification attributes, \nand when we add specification attribute need ability to add Group of attributes. Then like in Bulk editor, selecting the Attribute options.. Legal aspect\nin Russian you can sale only with RUB's\nin Armenia you can sale only with AMD's\nand more \n. @AndreiMaz Situation:We have product Price is 1000$ Product cost is 29100 RUB=500$ (But we can write only with USD because USD is primary currency) Exchange rate for now is 1$=58.2RUB\nBut in next day USD rate go down and 1$= 20 RUB\nNow Product cost=500$=10000RUB \nand it is wrong \ni'm right?. \n. @Xzelsius Yes example of product- Cars, Real Estate\nin Real Estate store we don't need to show Shipping box\nin store where only have Rental services products don't need to show Shipping box\nin store where we sale digital keys, we don't need to show Shipping box\nand more more examples.\nNow i think you know.. For Administrators not specific, but same Admin Panel use Vendors to, and for Vendors its specific. some type of predefined fields we have now, Basic-Advanced view. Default error template, We're sorry, an internal error occurred. ....... @AndreiMaz sorry its my local system issue, i correct it, all works fine. i Fix the problem, but its a real problem\nHistory\ni have multistore (Electronics, Stationary and Food)\nin Electronics store i have category by name Notebook(computer)\nin Stationary store i have category by name Notebook(copybook)\nand i want to import products to Food store, and show error\n(all Categories have Limitation by Store, first Notebook for Electronics store, second for Stationary store)\nthen i reneme Notebook(computer) to Laptop, and import products .. Now when we import products for current store, we can't ((((\nproduct is importing and available for all stores, then we manualy need to set Limitation.\nimport/export not support Multistore. @AndreiMaz Yes. @AndreiMaz  i reproduce.

Thanks @JanKonopka for a great detailed answer. So during dev how do you get around the dependent assemblies from being deleted when nop.web project runs ClearPluginAssemblies.proj. I can get my direct referenced assemblies to stick however any nuget package dependencies for my project get cleared out by the ClearPluginAssemblies project when nop.web is built/run/executed.. yes for /login you should display and remove the register stuff, however for /login/checkoutasguest there is no point in displaying this page. My concern is that if you show both it could be confusing.. @tigran-avdalyan please ensure your store is configured to use SSL. \nAdmin: Configuration -> Stores - 'SSL enabled' == true.. What a pay to punt this one - there is no need to allow the browser to autofill a username and password on the page which an admin creates a new user, nop should turn this off using attributes on those input elements. So rather than just saying there are no bugs please try to understand the problem and how you can correct it than just saying its the browser as if there is not an option to control the browser behaviour here. . I would not use DFSR, updating one web app will start replication to occur and depending on the file/location being replicated the web apps on the other servers will be restarted constantly and impact your entire server farm. You are better off taking each machine out of the LB, updating it, and then putting it back into service.\nAs far as updating the installedPlugins.json - we usually do not install/uninstall plugins all that much in production, but when we do we do so on one machine, replicate the installedPlugins.json to the others and restart each web app. Have not had an issue to this point but that may depend on the plugins you use.. I will send you a new pull request shortly.. @skoshelev - I did not capture a stack of the issue but I did run into a recursion issue whereby this lock was used via recursion. If you want to avoid using this flag we would need to fix the recursion issue. Microsoft's statement on using the recursion flag pertains to new development which this is not and for some cases we seem to be using recursion. That said, for now I have removed this flag from my test environment and when I run into the issue again I will capture a stack so we can better understand the issue and look into how to address. . I was able to reproduce the issue fairly easily be visiting a product page with the original fix in place and the site is configured to use Redis.\nAs you can see thre is a call to:\nNop.Core.Caching.PerRequestCacheManager.Get\nwhich grabs a reader lock. We have a cache miss so we call into the aquire() Func which calls into the settings service which results in a get into Redis Cache and again into the PerRequest cache and again tries to enter as a reader again (recursion).\nLooking at my original Pull again I think the best, and most correct, fix is to update the PerRequstCache Get method and use only a Reader lock when necessary and if a cache miss occurs ensure we are not acquiring the value with a held lock. Finally I can then grab a writer lock if the acquisition works.\nI will submit another PR when I finish testing my updated fix.\n```\n[External Code]\nNop.Core.dll!Nop.Core.Caching.RedisCacheManager.Get>>(string key, System.Func>> acquire, int? cacheTime)\nNop.Services.dll!Nop.Services.Configuration.SettingService.GetAllSettingsCached()\nNop.Services.dll!Nop.Services.Configuration.SettingService.GetSettingByKey(string key, string defaultValue, int storeId, bool loadSharedValueIfNotFound)\nNop.Services.dll!Nop.Services.Media.PictureService.GetDefaultPictureUrl(int targetSize, Nop.Core.Domain.Media.PictureType defaultPictureType, string storeLocation)\nNop.Services.dll!Nop.Services.Media.PictureService.GetPictureUrl(Nop.Core.Domain.Media.Picture picture, int targetSize, bool showDefaultPicture, string storeLocation, Nop.Core.Domain.Media.PictureType defaultPictureType)\n[External Code] \nNop.Core.dll!Nop.Core.Caching.PerRequestCacheManager.Get(string key, System.Func acquire, int? cacheTime)\n[External Code] \n5zpdhjdv.y2t!AspNetCore.Views_Shared_Components_Widget_Default.ExecuteAsync()\n[External Code] \npaxehel0.c4r!AspNetCore.Themes_Venture_Views_Catalog_CategoryTemplate_ProductsInGridOrLines.ExecuteAsync()\n[External Code] \nNop.Plugin.Api.dll!Nop.Plugin.Api.ApiStartup.Configure.AnonymousMethod__2_0(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext context, System.Func next)\n[External Code] \nNop.Plugin.Api.dll!Nop.Plugin.Api.IdentityServer.Middlewares.IdentityServerScopeParameterMiddleware.Invoke(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext context)\n[External Code] \nNop.Web.Framework.dll!Nop.Web.Framework.Globalization.CultureMiddleware.Invoke(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext context, Nop.Core.IWebHelper webHelper, Nop.Core.IWorkContext workContext)\nNop.Services.dll!Nop.Services.Authentication.AuthenticationMiddleware.Invoke(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext context)\n[External Code] \nNop.Core.dll!Nop.Core.Http.InstallUrlMiddleware.Invoke(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext context, Nop.Core.IWebHelper webHelper)\nNop.Core.dll!Nop.Core.Http.KeepAliveMiddleware.Invoke(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext context, Nop.Core.IWebHelper webHelper)\n[External Code] \n```. @skoshelev - I found one more issue. I still get the following exceptions every once in a while.

On the other side we can separately add percent to the base price only. And then sum all additional fees\n. I was going to bring up something on the 3.4 roadmap, but because it was already looking awesome, I was going to wait until 3.5 before bringing this up. But seeing the statement \"make it configurable because it can seriosly affect performance (disable by default) \", I will mention it now.\nIf we took a different architecture approach, many of these expensive lookups could be minimized. If we had an additional background job that ran off a queue, we could do very complex logic like this work item is requesting with no performance impact.\nJust like cache is updated when we save a product in the admin, any changes could also be pushed to a stack (similar to what we are doing already with activity monitor). So, lets look at a practical scenario.\nStore admin comes in and makes price adjustments to attribute options and maybe even updates a lot of attribute combinations. We write (using a queue paradigm) the events to a background work stack. So, an example row would be (ProductId, enum for price adjustment, etc). Within a min or two, the background job would pull off the stack and determine (From and To) prices based on changes, then write these 2 values right into 2 new columns in the product table and updates the cache as normal.\nWhen this product is pulled for the Catalog for someone browsing, the From and To are now simple fields that have no \"real-time\" calculation needed.\nThis same architecture shift could be applied to many many scenarios in nopCommerce. The goal being, during user browsing of the site, avoid complex logic by just putting results as simple attributes, and leaving the calculation of those values to back-end services. \nAs this work item is on the 3.4 roadmap now, I will make a note in the roadmap thread.\n. One additional point to the above comment. Essentially this adds up to introducing the concept of \"Calculated fields\" populated by background jobs to make catalog browsing faster.\n. Thanks for suggestion. Please note that nopCommerce supports tier prices per customer role. So these ranges could vary based on customer role and some complex discount rules. That's why it should be done \"real-time\"\n. An alternative would be an option to hide the \"From\" and \"To\" prices on Catalog pages.\n. Does this effect performance of the while web site regardless if this method of dealing with product attribute pricing is only need a on a few products? Example computer a system page.\nI worked around this sort of by creating a custom category template page for the category page for the computer system configurators. I hid the price and add to cart section so it is juts the picture and short description. So the person has to click to the product page to see the system and the attribute based pricing. \nNot ideal I know. But it is all I could come up with until some solution is found to allow for pricing to show up correctly. \nAnother option I tried to do but could not figure out was to replace the Add to cart button with a Configure button that bring you to the product. page so at least there is a obvious button to press. \nI sure hope some solution happens that allows for the dynamic pricing to show up as expected. This would make it perfect and do what our old cold fusion based configurator could do. :) \n. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. It can affect performance too much. Leave it for customization. The creation of a Reseller (or \"Partner\") Portal where resellers can register customers and order on a customers behalf.\nThe portal should allow the Partner to see only customers associated with them and orders only they have processed. A Partner Resources section where they can get logos, product descriptions etc would be helpful. Resellers are most useful for overseas and often foreign language sales.\nResellers purchase products at a discount and have the ability to turn off customer notifications about registration and also the option to hide order information (i.e,. the price paid) from the customer. Resellers whom separately bill the customer can then order products under their own pricing arrangements and can arrange for direct delivery either to the reseller or the customer.\nIn the case of downloadable products, the customer can login and download the product, but the reseller can't access the customer download, unless permitted by the store owner.\nIdeally Partners would be organised in separate classes with different administration rights depending on classes. eg. A \"Distributor\" might have the ability to refund orders, a basic reseller may not.\nThis can actually be done using a mashup of the Administration Interface combined the \"Affiliate\" functionality (\"Partner\" is a much better term). We have done this by hacking the code a bit which means it is not appropriate to share - it needs to be done properly.\nThe result was support for both \"Affiliate\" and \"Reseller\" management in one place. Both can login and seeeither how their Affiliate program membership is going or in the case of resellers can administer most features of the affiliated customers (affiliates only see customer name) .\n. @RomanovM Looks like Atul is right. Please check. oh, and since you're considering changing the admin UI/theme, I would like to suggest to right align all number/currency values in al table columns (for example reports etc). This design best practice improves readability and allows for easy comparison of values.\nsource: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/38848/nopcommerce-380-roadmap-and-estimated-release-date-lets-discuss.aspx?p=9#161620\n.

No. It should just work fine when doing import/export with the current version (keep it in synchronization)\n. Similar to #1172\n. Thanks! But we should not mix tasks in pull requests (you have two distinct commits to two tasks). A new branch should be created for each new task\n. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin development. Looks very interesting. A couple of notes:\n1. Localize \"Search\" text\n2. Is it possible to disable (ctrl +s) hotkey? I think it should be left as default browser hotkey for saving\n3. It's better to move the search box to the top (header). Now it confuses a bit when rendered near other search boxes\n. Thanks! But constructor of AutoMapperRegistrar in invoked multiple times for each HTTP request (in admin area). It's not acceptable.

Several recommendations:\n1. Combine images using CSS sprites. For example, /Themes/DefaultClean/Content/images/ajax-loader-small.gif and /Themes/DefaultClean/Content/images/compare-button.png\n2. Defer parsing of JavaScript. Actually it's jQuery library that cannot be moved to the footer - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2644\n3. Use cookie-free domains. For example, /Themes/DefaultClean/Content/images/logo.png or /thumbs/0000077_banner_1.jpg or ...min.css)\nLet's see whether we can (should) fix them. For example, it's better not to implement point 1 in open-source solution as it'll make customization more complex for third-party developers. Decided not to implement.

And move all price settings to it\nalso let's split product details page to several ones\n. Add a Getting Started Page\nOn the dashboard, show a panel with title \"Get Started With NopCommerce\" and in it show some items (along with a button next to each item) e.g.\n- Add few products [ADD NOW]\n  Setup a few products to your store\n- Add new page [ADD NOW]\n  Create new pages like About Us, Contact Us etc.\n- Configure Payment Methods [CONFIGURE NOW]\n  See what payment methods you'll be accepting\n. Show notification counts along with appropriate tabs\nSome notification counts should be shown e.g. Order tab will show the number of pending orders, Customer tab will show number of customers registered but not activated etc. They can also be given at the top links where Logout and similar navigation links are shown.\n. Quick Product Editor\nThis one should do what it says. Show the customer with minimum required fields to create a product. This will be a quick starter for him.\n. nopCommerce offers a ton of great features and flexible enough to meet most of the store owners. But, it doesn't change the fact that every store can have some unique requirements / needs. One online business might focus on vendor support and multi-store WHILE other business might focus on marketing features offered by nopCommerce to advertise their product line. So, it would be a great addition if admin panel is based on module system so that every store owner can customize the dashboard as per the business needs by simple drag and drop process.\n.  As others recommend, the admin should show only the options required by each store owner. Thus I suggest  to have a new menu tab \"Site Setup\" where the store options (checked/unchecked) would be set-up and then hide in a kind of ACL from the admin all those tabs/sections/settings which are not required. Example of the sselectable options:\nGeneral:\nMulti-store\nMulti-vendor\nMulti-language\nMulti-warehouse\nForum\nBlog\nNews\netc. etc.\nProduct Catalog:\nManufacturers\nGrouped products with variants\nProduct templates\nCustomer reviews\nGift cards\nRental products\nDownloadable products\nCustomer reviews\nInventory control\nShipping options at product level\nProduct attributes\nProduct specification\nTier prices\nACL on products/categories/manufacturers\nEtc. etc.\nMarketing:\nDiscounts\nAffiliates\nReward points\nEtc.\nOrders:\nShipping process\nPayment process\nReturns\nCustomer:\nCustomer attributes\nAddress attributes\nEtc., etc.\n- This could also be a first page during the store setting for unexperienced store owners who want to build their own store.\n- It is important to give a detailled explanation of the features in each option.\n- If some options are checked/unchecked some default settings should be set. For example if News option is not checked the \"News enabled:\" setting should be \"false\" \n- We use a similar checklist (almos 100 options) which has proved to be very usefull to produce very detailed and personalized proposals and quotes for our customers. If you think this is the way to go I could contribute with a more exhaustive checklist.\n. the long scrollable pages must go. Totally inconvenient. \n. my suggestion is Wizards - initial setup Wizards, security configuration Wizards, whatever. I have tried to manage multiple sites and it is time consuming, I've tried building default settings, and even a plugin was attempted, but it's always a \"fight\". And it's always funny introducing a shop owner to his admin as you know they just won't get it for a while...\nI've been interested in Ansible and Puppet for a while, and find a direct relation with ecommerce setups.\nI haven't given it any more thought than that, but I have considered creating an initial store setup wizard, and someway of creating a settings map.\n. What do you think about adding video tutorials to Admin panel? For example user goes to \"Configuration\" and below all options has header with \"Video manual/VIdeo tutorial\" and embed youtube link?\n. think about dropping \"Search by sku\" for products. anyway, it's search in product name by default\n. Product details page. Hide \"Discounts\" tab if product type is \"Grouped\" http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/42352/discount-in-group-product.aspx\n. Rename TierPrices to something else #1176\n. add description to specification/product/checkout attributes pages and tabs on product details page \nre-order specification and product attributes - http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/38848/nopcommerce-380-roadmap-and-estimated-release-date-lets-discuss.aspx?p=23#170785\n.

Actially in the latest version we have \"Ship to the same address\" checkbox on the \"Billing address\" step. It's enab;eby default. A store owner can simply rename this field to \"Address\". So we'll have a \"Address\" only.\nRegarding \"Ship to the same address\" checkbox. We can simply hide this option (but it'll be checked). So \"Shipping address\" step is always hidden. Just let's think how to better implement it. also see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2550 (plus volume).

Please also include task number to its comment with \"#2022 \". @manojkulkarni30 we're still thinking about it\nit redirect to English version now because we have English only. But very soon we'll have documentation translated to multiple languages. @manojkulkarni30 still thinking about it. It's by design. Entitie are not cached in EF. Thanks! But it's not by design. please see comment at https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2040\nEF entities doesn't support second-layer caching. What exactly do you suggest to refactor? Why should they be removed?. Agree. But in this case it's better to rename this task. Othwerwise, it sounds like they should be removed everywhere. Thanks! We'll discuss and think about it. I've just renamed a task!. moved to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2448. Great! Thanks a lot for this contribution!. What exactly do you mean? Hint (popup)?

Nothing seems to be logically changed. I don't think this issue could be resolved this way (this code doesn't change anything). I'm more than sure that it's related to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/33 (duplicated). After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization\nI would just sugget to specify larger period to delete guests (schedule tasks). e.g. - one month. Thanks. But product attributes import/export is already supported (3.80). @iammourya no, it's not supported yet. most probably 3.90 won't have its support. duplicated - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/524. We can have many refund requests.

After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin development\n. We decide to leave it for plugins. Split to two work items. The second one - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2106. @mcliment \n1. \"WebHelper.GetThisPageUrl(false)\" internally invokes \"IsCurrentConnectionSecured()\". So it'll return string starting with \"https://\" if a current store is SSL secured\n2. webHelper.GetStoreLocation() works aboslutely the same way. It invokes \"IsCurrentConnectionSecured()\" to detect whether secured URL should be returned\nDo you experience it only with CloudFlare?\nBTW, please see \"IsCurrentConnectionSecured\" method of WebHelper. have you enabled \"Use_HTTP_CLUSTER_HTTPS\" or \"Use_HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO\" in web.config?. So does \"httpContext.Request.Url\" return \"http://...\" in CloudFlare? Please confirm.\nAnd please make screenshot of your admin admin > system > system info. could you also please share screenshot of your admin admin > system > system info. please expand \"Variables del servidor\". is it the same as https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1159?. @tigran-avdalyan Thanks! Actually it's the same (grouping). But we don't have a task about templates (predefined values). So I've renamed this work to support templates. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin development\n. you cannot import by ID. it's used by update existing categories\nP.S.

After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. It can significantly descrease performance and make development more complex. So it' better to a described workaround (with additional customer role). It uses. But we load all categories in public store on the first request (not paging is used). So it almost doesn't effect performance. But it slighly increases it with large number of categories (e.g. 1-2K). After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box.

It should be the error page with a friendly message but not a store closed page. So by default in such cases visitors will see it (ErrorPage.htm). So just customize ErrorPage.htm file so it looks any way you want. This is how it works by design\nAnd to see the full error stack store owners (developers) can edit web.config file.

I\u2019ve reviewed the site and requirements. I haven\u2019t found anything that could affect nopCommerce. Maybe, I missed something. Do you have certain details what we could miss?\n. one more reply from our user\n\nIn The new core framework is it right that MS did not support ODATA at this moment?\n\nIf so do you have an idea if they are working on it and also a timeframe?\nI am asking, because we had made an connector which is based on ODATA and we are getting a new law in Europe (which is also valid for US if they sell in Europe). The new privacy law is coming on may 2018, at one of the new principals is, that a customer has to explicite accept the privacy conditions and it is mportand to sace the day and time when he had it done. 99 new paragraphs on 80 pages law\u2026\nI am sure that every shop must have some changes about this. Because the customers need this, they need surly the new version of nop, but without ODATA\u2026\nSo any ideas of that?\n\nno the cookie law was something simple. The new one it\u2019s called: GDPR - The new EU Data Protection Basic Regulation (DSGVO).\n\nAnd it has some new important changes, actually I am reading a lot about it, also we have an appointment with our lawyer.\nOne thing is that the customer must confirm what and why things are used (IP, Cookie, Trackingpixel etc.) and it has to be saved in a database (the date when he has signed). Also if he wants to cancel all his private information, it should be done in 72 hours and so on \u2026\nBut it is not only valid in EU, is is valid also in USA when they make business in the European market. So it will become a very important change to to a lot of companys who are making online business (also companies like Facebook etc.).\nSo  I think that perhaps would be a good feature if nop 4.0 works also with the old .NET Framework (hybrid), so all Plugins and ODATA is working.\nWhen new low gets online, I think it would be a serious problem if a company could not change to the new version of nop because something is missing.\nBut I will keep you informed what we get on new information.\nIn any case it us valid in the complete EU and all external countries who makes business with EU.\nThey called something out: 20 Mill / or 4% of the gross profit is to pay (maximum) if the law is broken. \nWe will see and we have also 8 Month\u2026 lot of time\u2026\nA basic article is:\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datenschutz-Grundverordnung\nYou could translate it very good with the new translator of German founders:\nhttps://www.deepl.com/translator\n. 4.10+ out of the box.

Until we load plugins in separate domains it's better to avoid usage of diffrerent versions. So we don'y plan to support it in the near time. I presume your server has not standard settings for US culture. We implicitly use US culture when parsing returned rate. Pleasae check it. @ArturAlekseev thanks a lot! done. @DarthSonic thank a lot!. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization . @ghd258 I think they are already supported as we moved to asp.net core 2. You can use them if you want. @a-patel thanks. we already did https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2535. @a-patel It's by design for 4.00. duplicated - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2492 (limitations described there_. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. @Moosebiter thanks a lot! Please also update upgrade.sql.\nBTW, there's one more space missing in \"Analyticsaccount\". It would be great if you can fix it as well in the same commit. @Moosebiter Great! Thanks a lot!. please post all confiration questions on our forums. @RomanovM all is good. @tigran-avdalyan we already have price (subtotal) in our roadmap. All the rest should be done in plugins. @tigran-avdalyan for price we have this work item (https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1955). I've added a link to this one to it. @manojkulkarni30 Thanks a lot. Please adjust RTL version as well. This issue is not of nopCommerce but of .NET. It was solved in 4.7.1 which don't plan to use (https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/dotnet471-changes.md - \"Fixed intermittent crash during GC with ETW memory tracing turned on\"). Now the only solution is 'Enable Diagnostics Tools while debugging'. all is good. @tigran-avdalyan thanks! but it could quite complex in terms of performance (network request). especially when we need to resize a picture.  After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin\n. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. Furthermore, it's done only once and it's possible to get ID from database. @tigran-avdalyan sure, we always welcome discussion. but this is no we're going to implement out of the box.. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box\n. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. It'll too complex to implement. we do not plan to implement such functionality out of the box. leave it for customization as it's quite specific. @tigran-avdalyan What formatting do you mean? Just as font-size, etc? We import and save the entire text as per the Excel file. @shurub3l thanks! duplicated work item. @shurub3l it's part of this work item (https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2287). Sorry that it's not implicitly mentioned there\nP.S. It's in our internal list of points (in Russian). I think we have to translate it for others. agree with @Xzelsius . @tigran-avdalyan no. it's left for customization. but I've jsut created a new work item (https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2616) not to lose this idea.  After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization. @xiaoyc please psot all questions on our forums. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin\n. @ngtrian thanks! but it's not planned. After some consideration we've decided to leave the current implementation. @tigran-avdalyan Hi Tigran, could you please provide a complete list of steps to reproduce the issue. Thanks! But it also doesn't work for name, price, etc. It's not the bug. It works only for already saved products (but unpublished yet). Versioning is not supported yet. @eadameg sure! Thanks!. @alessandromontividiu03 Thanks a lot! You're absolutely right. Could you please please delete (not just update) \"Can_remove_queryString_should_ignore_input_parameter_case\" as it's obsolete now. Thanks a lot!. @mmccann-umph sure. please contribute.. @a-patel thanks! we've also thought about it - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2597. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. IT can cause issues when a new data protecion keys are generated, etc. @xiaoyc pease psot all questions on our forums.  After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin\n. @Xzelsius Thanks a lot!. @MarinaAndreeva Marina, it works fine. SeName is received in the view (cshtml). @MarinaAndreeva Thanks, Marina! Bt it works fine. SeName is received in the view (cshtml). @wezzix thanks a lot! done. decided to implement only https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/17. After some consideration we've decided to leave the current implementation. @kipergil Hi Mustafa! It's done in database. And nopCommerce requires SQL Server database to be case invariant. So it's always case invariant when filtering in DB. @alecrt actually, yeah. you're right. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin\n. @tigran-avdalyan I understand what you mean. But how exactly will it be used? I mean logic (e.g. price change, something else, etc). And I'm also talking about shipping plugins that don't support volumn. All they need is dimention and weight. . @tigran-avdalyan I'm not sure the German laws use it (PangV is used mostly in Germany). After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin\n. decided not to implement. @tigran-avdalyan  Thanks a lot for suggestion!\n\nsuch discount requirement plugin already exists\n\nit can also be achienved with new requirement plugins. but we plan to have minimum number of plugins available out of the box (this github issue tracker is only for \"out of the box\" tasks). @tigran-avdalyan All of our plugins are available at https://github.com/nopSolutions (source code). @tigran-avdalyan what is your screen resolution? Browser?. moved to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2620. @tigran-avdalyan It works fine on my computer. What browser and screen resolution are you using?. we mvoe away from KendoUI. So closing this issue. @a-patel DataTables. @tigran-avdalyan thanks. the question is whether KendoUI Grid supports it. @tigran-avdalyan yeah, in this case you're right. @tigran-avdalyan no. it doesn't include the grid. please find more at https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/29633/using-kendo-ui-legal.aspx?p=8#194478. @tigran-avdalyan not sure that our licenses are compatible (For free) - https://js.devexpress.com/Licensing/. moved as comment to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/75. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization. It's part of CMS. thanks. After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization. Furthermore, this is an option to hide unpublish products below some low qty. it works fine\n\n. @ngtrian actually you type another word (other chars). @ivanslater could you please provide some examples of such countries?. I don't believe it's really required to such setting. Just delete all tax plugins..  After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin. Furthermore, it's already possible on the search page\n. We've already moved .NET Core. But we leave this pull reqeust open because it could be helpful for us in the future (when we start support new databases). @rolandh what version? 4.00?. @rolandh thanks a lot! fixed. @fsefacan what version are you using? Please share the entire error stack. @fsefacan what exactly entity do you try to serialize? Derived from BaseEntity?. So it's not the bug (at least not reproducable out of the box). BaseEntity should NOT be serializable because EF doesn't support 2-level caching. Just ensure that your custom entity (and its childs) is serializable. @Xzelsius looks like a very good idea. yes, please make a pull request. Suggestion to combine the following parameters to one container-class \n\n\npageIndex, pageSize and a new getOnlyTotalCount for methods returning IPagedList. After some discussion decided not to implement it . @Xzelsius Thanks. Seems like it doesn't workin the following case:\n\nGo to billing address on one-age checkout\nChoose \"New address\"\nChoose \"USA\" and American states will be loaded. But don't fill other required fields\nClick \"Continue\"\nYou'll validation errors. But now when you change a country, new states won't be loaded. @MarinaAndreeva Hi, Marina! You can always use the following workaround. Open the appsettings.json file and set \"ForwardedHttpHeader\" to something else (non-existing).\n\nI've just fixed the typo/ Thanks!. duplicated. https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2637. @Ochapparel what specifications do you mean? specification attributes?. thanks. but we'll leave it for customization. Specs are not for invoices. @tigran-avdalyan thanks. but duplicated work item - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2567. But why do you resize it? not sure that it's the issue of nopCommerce. I can reproduce it even in AdminLTE which we use - https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/pages/mailbox/compose.html. Thanks a lot! I've jsut fixed it. 1. Ensure that \"orderSettings.AutoUpdateOrderTotalsOnEditingOrder\" is set to \"true\"\n2. PDF are cached by your browser. Click F5 to reset it. https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/1c330caf83de699d0be79aeaff986be168e5f592. Thanks a lot!. Thanks. But already reported and fixed https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/989f8101044d57e670bd6f4887d57d6f55f3a62d. @totalagility please manually delete this table and try one more time. @rolandh It works absolutely the same way as in 3.90. On the store details page.. @rolandh we have several demo sites run on 4.00 and SSL works fine (enabled as in 3.90). What exactly have you customized in Nop.Web? Could you please share your code?. @rolandh ohh. So you mean local development only?. @JeanCollas You can implement your own \"INopStartup\" interface and register custom middleware in it\nCould you please post all questions on our forums. Github is an issue tracker. @neal007 this is how asp.net core deploys files =))\nWhen you deploy it to the file system (local), does it look the same way?. Thanks. But it's by design. @mariannk what do you think?. It's ASP.NET error. We should localize such errors. After some consideration we've decided to leave the current implementation. @bakbuz \n1. what is \"ShouldUseOtherLanguageAttribute\"? \n2. Could you please clarify about \"lang\" attribute of \"html\" tag? So if we add it, then everything will work fine?. @bakbuz could you please clarify how exactly have you fixed it?. @bakbuz I presume \"html lang=\"@(this.WorkingLanguage.UniqueSeoCode)\"\". Please confirm. @bakbuz found the solution. fixed. thanks again!.  After some discussion decided not to implement it out of the box. We leave it for customization or plugin development\n. Agree with @Xzelsius . @bakbuz please translate labels. the suggestion is not clear now. @bakbuz thanks a lot!. Thanks. But we prefer our approach with IDs. thanks. but ut's by design. this text in the footer should not be localizable. No. It'l lrequire customization. also see https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/49120/nopcommerce-400-beta-released-please-share-your-impressions.aspx?p=11#195473. please post all questiona on our forums. it's an issue tracker. Thansk a lot. decided not to implement. it's now done for all \"select\" by asp.net core. and anyway, even if it was not marked as \"selected\". If we choose some country. and then choose back default option, it would be marked as \"selected\". So the \"issue\" will exists.\nBut as I mentioned on the forums it works fine because we also have server-side validation. @haimca \n1. what is your SQL Server version? \n2. I presume you have at least several completed order as you're upgrading. Please confirm\n3. Is it possible for you to use SQL Server profiler and see the generated SQL command? \n4. If yes, then please open SQL Server Management Studio and execute this SQL command manually. Please share results here. @haimca What is the type of \"Quantity\" column of \"Order\" table (in database, not in source code)?. @haimca yes. It's \"int\" by default. So the issue is caused by your customization. Please update (just find out why it was done)\nclosing this issue.... \"NuGet package restore failed\" - looks like temporary issue. Try one more time. OR just googly by \"NuGet package restore failed\". There are a lot of solutions\nP.S. could you please post all questions on our forums. @kwerty It already validates it - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Plugins/Nop.Plugin.Payments.PayPalStandard/Controllers/PaymentPayPalStandardController.cs#L248. @rolandh \n1. so it happens only for one of your sites? but not for others?\n2. is it for the product details page only?. It's part of https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1457 task. But we do not plan to do it out of the box. The default theme should be easy to customize. Not much people using it in production. So it's betterto leave for customization. @ArturAlekseev It's not possible just because there are too many sizes to be generated (e.g. catalog, produict details, attributes, shopping cart, etc, etc). Please note that it happens only once. I don't believe that it takes 10 secs to generate 4 thumbnails nowadays\nWhat we really should better fix is this work item https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1610. @ArturAlekseev \n1. do you have \"MediaSettings.MultipleThumbDirectories\" setting enabled\". Try to do it (delete all thumbs in advance)\n2. how many thumb files do you already have in this directory (images/thumbs)?. @rolandh Thanks! The suggestion is good. But it can decrease the performance and logic to support it . It's better to keep it simpler now. thanks a lot for interest in contribution. GitHut is for development tasks. Please post it at https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/45692/nopcommerce-documentation-translators-wanted.aspx. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2494. @rolandh We insert customers with some random GUID. Which role these customers are mapped to?. @rolandh not sure how it's possible. Maybe some third-party plugin?\nBecause InsertGuestCustomer method of CustomerService sets GUID. @rolandh It's still not clear how to reproduce it (get empty GUIDs)\nRegarding the code (CurrentRegisteredCustomer). No, we don't plan to use it (duplicate code). YOu can get CurrentCustomer and then just check whether he's registered. @rolandh right, but this task is about empty GUIDs. not about a lot of guest records (they periodically deleted). @rolandh Creation of new guest records for each new visitor (not for each request) is by design (they are deleted later), It's not the bug\nBut it's not possible to reproduce creation of guests with empty GUID. How can I do it out of the box? Please see this method (https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Libraries/Nop.Services/Customers/CustomerService.cs#L614), It clearly generates a new GUID for each guest. Closing this task as it's not possible to reproduce out of the box.. @tigran-avdalyan Tigran, thanks a lot!. The same happens for any redirections for any redirection (e.g. after the login page).

https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/commit/c1e5640a656ddfe6d478cb54a30002de41c25180. @dotnetdreamer could you please some steps to reproduce the issue?. @ArturAlekseev it's by design. we load all categories. but we do it only once (for all pages). It takes some time but only during the first site visit. So it's by design. Do you have js minification enabled?. please see admin area > configuration > general settings > js minification. is ti enabled?. https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/49614/nops-version-of-squareup-breaks-checkout-page.aspx. @fsefacan just disable loading of all locales in admin area > configuration > general settings . Please share some screenshots. It works fine (there's one more checkbox to override this setting). @kwerty Thanks again! Fixed. related to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2737. made a little bit simpler way. Never experienced this issue and not sure how to reproduce it. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43305220/form-key-or-value-length-limit-2048-exceeded snd https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38357108/form-submit-resulting-in-invaliddataexception-form-value-count-limit-1024-exce. tiket: Overriding Request Form max upload limit\ncommit: https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/commit/23b7d8f62a2515e2dbea436ef118fb67e759e2d9#diff-366dd01d9e3d472a3fdd73c793f72db7. @Xzelsius Thanks a lot!. it's in release notes. we plan to release it lkater on our marketplace. @skoshelev \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439. @rahatur what version of nopCommerce are you using?. it's the issue. It was fixed in later versions. please see global.asax file in 3.90 where we set it. yes. @ArturAlekseev Thanks. But I think it's easier to implement it as a plugin which will do it for all payment plugins. For example, this plugin will have a new service (derived from \"PaymentService\") which will override \"ProcessPayment\" method of \"IPaymentService\". In this new method the base (original) \"ProcessPayment\" method will be invoked (it makes an actual payment). And then you can send any information to the cash machine once it's invoked.\nI don't think we should add a certain (region specific) implementation to the core (like this one). @ArturAlekseev Great! Then you're always welcome to publish it on our marketplace (free or paid, up to you). @ArturAlekseev Ohh. Please see \"OrderPaidEvent\" event. You cna subscribe to it. @SharePointShaz \n1. What is the diference? The boolean operation is just reverted. It works by design and fine\n2. How can we reproduce the issue?. @SharePointShaz The hint states \"'Pre-order' button will automatically be changed to 'Add to cart' at this moment.\". So by design it works fine. \nBut you're right that it's better to rename it to the \"End date\" so it doesn't confuse users. Thanks!\nP.S. It worked this way in all previous versions, not in 4.00 only. After one more investigation I can confirm that everything is correct. This field states (even in source code comment) - the start date and time of the product availability (for pre-order products)\nSo when this product becomes available. @amirkhanjz fixed in 4.10 by adding lang tag to html attribute. moved to https://github.com/nopSolutions/paypalexpress-plugin-for-nopcommerce/issues/11. @tigran-avdalyan just leave URL empty to disable a social network (as stated in the hint). thanks. we'll check. also see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2249 (related work item). @adam3039 Actually you already can do it. see demo at http://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/Admin/FixedOrByWeight/Configure (advanced mode). @adam3039 it's possible. You can limit plugins by store on the plugin list page (\"Edit\" button). @Xzelsius why not? we avoid duplications. What is the difference?  type=\"text/javascript\"?. Thanks. But after some consideration we've decided to leave our current event mechanism. \"No database instance\" - there's n osuch database as per your connection string\nP.S. Please post all technical questions on our forums. Github is only for tasks to be implemented. Hi Tigran,\nThanks! But we do not plan to add new plugins out of the box. It's better if someone from community will develop it. please see https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/46303/list-of-possible-integrations.aspx. After some consideration we've decided to leave the current implementation (not a real issue). All currencies or prices in admin area support primary store currency only. it's by design.\nWe can consider it only after https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1. All currencies or prices in admin area support primary store currency only. it's by design.\nWe can consider it only after https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1. Tigran, thanks for suggestion. But it's easier to manage (and implement) it the way it's already done now. We've decided not to implement it out of the box. please clarify. it's not clear now. @tigran-avdalyan It uses friendly name of payment plugins. It's by design. We should not use system name. \nPlease note that in live stores a store owner will have only ONE payment plugins with \"Credit card\" friendly name. Otherwise, it can also confuse customers during checkout. we move away from KendoUI. So closing it. It works fine out of the box. Perhaps, the Web.Admin.dll is not re-built. Could you please all technical questions on our forums. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/290. Thanks! But order notes are not supposed to be included in emails. It's for order details page only. @tompten111 Thanks! But it's the only way to see order details for guests (use the same computer) because cookies are stored only into it.\nIt's not secure to allow viewing order details page without cookies (e.g. using query string parameter, etc). It's not a trojan of course. Why do ytou think so?. @ArturAlekseev Have you rebuilt the application before publishing? Have you done step 2 from http://docs.nopcommerce.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1442493. @dev-siberia This github issue tracker is used only for features to be implemented (or bugs). Could you please post all questions on our forums (https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/)\nP.S. We don't use EF migrations. @tigran-avdalyan you already can do on the plugin list page (see \"Edit\" button)  - popup window. @tigran-avdalyan \n1. Most plugins already support multi-store configuration on the \"configuration\" page\n2. And \"Limited to store\" allows you to enable/disable per store. @tigran-avdalyan we don't plan to support it. In this case you have to enter price per day (e.g. $3 per day in admin area) if you allow to rent per days. @tigran-avdalyan Could you please provide more info? Like a quote? Auction?\nBTW, We also ready this work item https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/279. Is it the same?. so it's https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/279. @wize1 That's right. Each plugin will have to handle it\nCould you please clarify about PayPal Standard? How to reproduce the issue?. VS 2017 is required as per our requirements page. Please see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2834. @chlela you have to enable \"Force SSL for all site pages\" for the entire site now. @a-patel not yet. This is issue has already been fixed. Thanks. URLs are not properly created in email - https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/46330/duplicate-folders-in-path-eg-storestore-with-virtual-folders.aspx#199689. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box and leave it for customization. thanks. duplciated - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/276. It's by design. please find more at https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2644. @demckee Could you please clarify the following?\n\"extra code to delete the copied dlls doesn't always work. This is one of the reasons you have to build the solution multiple times\"\n. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box . @B-Esmaili this issue tracker is only for work item. Could you please post all questions on our forums? Thanks!. @tigran-avdalyan do you mean in admin area when managing products?. @tigran-avdalyan just don't use this specification attribute for products available in the FOOD store. We don't plan to implement it out of the box.\nBut we think about dropdownlists with \"Search\" functionality (filter textbox) for dropdownlists with a lot of values. please see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/225\nbut we do not plan to do it. @MJ-Vakili Thanks a lot!. already done =)). @ni-fara Thanks a lot . @AhmedVolcano Thanks a lot! ALready fixed https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2731. It works fine. Maybe, some 4.00 version is support (or wrong version is uploaded)\nBut it's better to address nop-templates team to get the support. @poyker Boyko, please check. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box and leave it for customization. @myaseer Why do you need two categories with the same name? I mean at the same level?. @tigran-avdalyan Thanks. But we don't plan to implement it out of the box.. Thanks for suggestion!\nI don't think that anybody will write a review in several languages (ILocalizedEntity). Maybe, we could just add \"LanguageId\" property to reviews. So we can filter them by current customer language (or sort by the current language)\nBut after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box and leave it for customization. After some consideration we've decided to leave current implementation. You can always use \"username\" as phone. @skoshelev Sergey, pleae check. @tigran-avdalyan already exists - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1. @B-Esmaili Could you please psot all questions on our forums? We use github only for  work items. decided to move the plugin to marketplace. Please also see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2876. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box and leave it for customization. Most probably some network issue or wrong store URL specified in admin area. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box and leave it for customization. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box and leave it for customization. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided not to implement it out of the box. Cannot reproduce. It works fine. For example, \"Price\" on the product details page in admin area. it works fine. I would suggest to post it on our forums to investigate your plugin. Just disable \"commonsettings.log404errors\" setting to avoid logging (which requires a customer record). @rudgr Hi Rutger. Please check the following commit and let me know if it works as expected - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/fd41506c0904234a05e04f838fdb47c7f627ca34\nBTW, what shipping rate computation method do you use?. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided to leave it for customization\n. Thank. but duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/336. Thanks for suggestion! But after some consideration decided to leave it for customization. What exactly error do you see?. Tigran, thanks a lot! But we don't plan to suppport it out of the box now. leaving it for customization. We also experienced this issue in previous versions of VS. Now it works quite fine (resharper slowed it down as well). @tigran-avdalyan what exactly link do you mean? product details page in public site?. Thanks, Tigran. But we don't plan to implement it out of the box. @tigran-avdalyan Product attributes are not somehow related to \"compare products\". It uses only specification attributes. It's by design.. @aghe there's no such bug. you can open this page but you CANNOT run a schedule task. We have appropriate validation in Task implementation. So everything is fine. UPDATE: please see \"Execute\" method of \\Libraries\\Nop.Services\\Tasks\\Task.cs. Right, it's possible to execute a task that have never been run before. But it's very-very rare case. Because once a store is installed, all active tasks will be run at least once in a quite short period of time.\nAnd it's NOT possible to run a task (that already ha been run at least once) by opening this URL. . @dahlbyk sure, please do it. and we'll investigate. Thanks for suggestion. But we leave it for customization. done. @rolandh no, there's no such plugin - https://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace.aspx?searchterm=sendgrid. Please provide a complete list of steps to reproduce the issue. It works fine for thousands of sites. We cannot reproduce it\nWhat is your site URL?. It looks like someone deleted generated thumbs. Or IIS doesn't have access to files.\nwe close this issue so it works fine out of the box. @darocker22 looks like the same as in https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2869. Thanks a lot. Fixed - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/ba2f9ddacd4ab5bc9a3ddc739a10424d2a4e482f. @cklenk \"Totally breaks\" - what exactly error do you see? \nalso try to enable/disable JS and CSS bundling separately. After some consideration we've decided to leave current implementation. there could be a lot of concurrency issues, not just with payments. we'll investigate it. @rolandh  not sure that it's possible. anyway I think it's related to Google servers rather to nopCommerce. @skoshelev Sergey, please check. Still reported at https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/55027/v41-negate-additional-shipping-charges-when-local-pickup.aspx. removed after moving to EF Core. @landlogicit sorry, I haven't got you. how  to reproduce the issue? please clarify. right now we use and support 4.6.1 only. cannot reproduce it out of the box. @venta360 it works fine at http://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/Admin/Product/BulkEdit\ncan you reproduce it there?. @onestar1 please clarify your question/request?. @tigran-avdalyan I cannot reproduce it. It works fine. Thanks for suggestion. But we'll leave it for customization. the issue is that it timed out. After some consideration we've decided not to implement it out of the box. @ivanslater no, in 4.10 it sends only once it's paid (not placed). @mariannk \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c?. After some investigation I can say that it won't significantly increase performance. But it'll make source code maintenance more complex and less developer-friendly. There are other more \"friendly\" way to improve performance (see issues with \"performance\" tag in this repository). @jvukovich do you have only one instance of the application?. we cannot reproduce this issue.. please see work item - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/560 (not implemented yet). @roanbekker Thanks a lot! But we do not plan tto add new plugins out of the box. But it would be great if you can upload it to our marketplace https://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace.aspx?category=2. @SuperArtie sure, please share source code so we can check it. Justin,\nIt works fine. Locales are installed during the plugin installation. https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Plugins/Nop.Plugin.Widgets.NivoSlider/NivoSliderPlugin.cs#L83. It's only in VS. It works fine on live servers. Please contact the developer of this plugin. But actually the error is self-describing. It's for some other version. It should support 4.00. @justindongqiang Thanks a lot! please note that in 4.10 we send this info using API calls to GA (not JS). fixed as part of https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2993. Please note that it works only with \"JS\" setting enabled. moved to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/471. Thanks! But it's by design. . Thanks a lot. Moved to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2494 (comments). moved to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/239. You can force HTTPS in admin area > configuration > general settings for the entire sirte (not HSTS). \nP.S. Could you please post all questions on our forums? Github is only for work items and bugs. already fixed https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/56677a22d426ab5bd0fe85f1c9b6f45b0b40db07. @rolek Could you please clarify what this code does? Some reference to documentation explaning it?. thanks a lot suggestion. but do not plan to implement it out of the box. @samdubey is right. @joecodino Thanks a lot! Fixed. after some investigation we decide not to implement it (not stable). @mariannk needs some investigation. It works fine out of the box. I presume you use some third-party plugin (we don't have - button). Thanks! We know about it. Just haven't finished the migration .net core yet. we don't use migrations out of the box. Could you please post this question on our forums? as github is used only for planned work items. moved to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3092. Thanks. But the second issue is already fixed\nP.S. Please note that 4.10 is not released yet. And not recommended to use in production. @JadynWong could you please clarify what it actually does. Not sure that I understand this logic . thanks a lot. but  we don't plan to support it. it's not supported out of the box. but \"spent\" dixcount requirement plugins could be found on our marketplace. Thanks a lot! It's by design now. But anyway we already have this work item - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2158. After some consideration we've decided not to implement it. We don't provide support for third-party plugin. We even don't source code of it. It's better to contact T-Motions. please see the latest commit regarding the margin. @justindongqiang Thanks a lot! Please also udpate https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/upgradescripts/4.00-4.10%20(under%20development)/upgrade.sql. @skoshelev Sergei, please check. please post al la development questions on our forums. after some investigation we decide not to implement it . Thanks a lot for suggestion. But we don't plan to support it out of the box. You'll have to customize solution to support it. Furthermore, it's a picture (not text).\nBTW, there are plenty of other sliders on our marketplace. Please check them out. after some consideration we've decided not to implement it out of the box. only these fields. Thanks a lot for suggestion. But we don't plan to support it out of the box. You'll have to customize solution to support it. Please also check https://www.nopcommerce.com/p/2464/api-plugin.aspx. Thanks a lot for suggestion. But we don't plan to support it out of the box. You'll have to customize solution to support it. thanks. but we don't support linux yet https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3095. I don't think it's weird. We just do it step by step. \n.net core is not introduced just for Linux support\n.net core can be also run on windows and has its advandages on Windows as well\n. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3095. it works fine now. thx. we droppped its support. we've decided to leave it this way because of:\n1. It's clear what type of database we support\n2. we plan to add new database support in the next version. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/30. thanks! no, it's still open https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2074. Right now we support only weights. So we'll leave it this way in 4.10. Anyway, you can edit a locale if you need it right now. What database version are you using?. Is it possible for you to use SQL Server profiler and see what SQL command is generated in this case (you can set breakpoint in \"GetAllCustomers\" method of \"CustomerService\" before the executation?. @Ochapparel sure, it would be great. please send a link to    [HIDDEN]. @Ochapparel by the way, why is it ntext in your case if nopCommerce sets as \"nvarchar(max)\" by default?. thx. but we don't plan to do it. @KrzysztofPajak thanks. but we haven't supported it before as well. https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/55402/installing-nopcommerce-on-host4aspnet.aspx. @mariannk please check. @DmitriyKulagin let's check whether it's an issue or by design by the validation script . It's by design. A store owner should not have two same SKUs. We also display a warning. This button shoudl redirect to a product details page. perhaps, just perhaps someone will want to have it. Furthermore, SKU could be assigned not only to products. But to product combinations as well. So it won't help in al lcases. Does it always happen?. not sure that it's clear when exactly it happens. we cannot reproduce it. why not? it is. No, it's by design. after some discussion we've decided to leave it this way. not sure that each customer can choose whether to receive this email or not. You can write it in the policy that everyone will be notified about review replies\n. Chris, Github is for issues. Could you please post questions on our forums? Thanks a lot!. It's by design. You save it withput publishing. Then you can preview it. Bundled files are cached. You can reset cache in admin area\nalso see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3092. It's a ModelPrepared event. And it's only for nopCommerce models. It's by design. Cannot reproduce. Works fine.\nWhere do you publish it? File system?. Is it published withput errors when ypu try to deploy it to a file system (local)?. So for example you entered \"www.dfgdfgdfgdfgdfgdfg.com\" URL. When exactly do you get this error? . it's just a timeout. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3095. do you have a valid URL specified on your store details page (admin area)?. @rajupaladiya please share your theme with @mariannk . @conway91 are you using some third-party theme or plugin? It works fine out of the box. It's NOT hidden. @DmitriyKulagin Dima, please check. please see https://www.sellercommunity.com/t5/Developer-Discussions/Creating-Customer-Card/td-p/27378. thx a lot. fixed. let's continue to use our implementation. let's use our implementation. done in 4.10. thanks. You did not check \"Automatically search sub categories\". @VR-Architect  I cannto reproduce it. It works fine. When you clear log, you can see it in the \"activity log\" (not the same as \"system log\"). Activity log is enough. Thanks. It\u2019s custom developement. Please post it on our forums . \"Sequence contains more than one element\" means that your database is not empty. You should delete all tables. This error is generated by Entity Frameworl. I think it should be better \"fixed\" by them. your installation wasn't completed (timeouted). Please re-install the site. It happens not after changes in admin area. But only after a purchase in public store (after an order is placed). It's by design. after some investigation we decide not to implement it . It's by design. When you have two products (variants), then it redirects t o the product details page. actually it's inside the \"product\" parameter\nP.S. Please give descriptive issue names on github (not \"feature request\"). @ArturAlekseev thanks a lot. thanks. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3174. thanks. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3174. please also post all questions on our forums. duplicated work item. Actually it exists in \"SearchProducts\" method. Furthermore, you can always load a product by ID and check its VendorId property. we've thought about it. But as long as we know asp.net doesn't support editing (saving) of  appsettings.json now. after soem consideration we've decided to leave the current implementation. thanks. we'll check the links and decided whether it can be useful. It's all is by design. Guest records are required\nFurthermore, if you use WebAPI, then consider using WebAPI plugin by nop-templates. Just see how it's implemented (no guest record is created for each request). MacOS is not supported yet. It preselect the current version. It works fine. 4.10 is selected if you use 4.10. we'll do it part of https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/276. @petrjiricek can you reproduce it on our demo site?. I presume you're using BETA. It was fixed in 4.10 RTM. What source control do you use?. What source control system? github? something else?. @JohnsonJohnsonYuan why not? font size should be positive . duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3182. The second one is not country. It's county\nWe'll display these fields according to address fields. Chris. could you please clarify. What exactly is wrong with this message? Not sure that I understand. Chris, please provide a list of steps to reproduce it at http://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/admin/\nWhen I type something unique, nothing appears. Please check out the latest version. We have appropriate validation in CheckoutModelFactory. @cnEUL Chris, thanks! You're right. It happens only during installation. We don't make appropriate validation in the https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Libraries/Nop.Services/Installation/CodeFirstInstallationService.cs when invoking \"urlRecordRepository.Insert\". Introduced in the following commit - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/c15db321ce3c37da93fd1079c07baf49ea5125a9#diff-79654c498769b4fd737ae0778c5d1b8b. similar issue - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3201. we cannot reproduce it. It was done by design to increase the speed because we changed the mechanism of schedule tasks in 4.00. @rajupaladiya What does your code do? Please provide a list of steps to reproduce an issue in nopCommerce. What exactly is \"functionality\" problem?. duplicated. . thx. duplicated - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2078. it's a per HTTP request cache. EF doesn't support 2-level caching. Thanks, Tigran. But duplicated - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/43. Why https could not be enabled? IIS express supports it. could you please post it on our forums?. Please post all quesrions on our forums. I also cannot reproduce it. I cannot reproduce it. It works fine. thx. but we think the current implementation is enough. thx. added as a comment to https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/7. thanks. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3182. That's not an issue of nopCommerce. It;s rather EF question. It's fine. Because then /testmetoo will be redirected to /de/testmetoo. We know about performance issues. But this task is too general. We have specific small task about performance improvements. If you have any other specific suggestions please let us know. PLease check your database. Does this table exist? It works fine out of the box. duplicated. Sure. But please post all questions on our forums. GitHub is for issues only. please provide a list of steps to reproduce the issue. Thanks! We still should display the login page because although registration is disabled some users can login (accounts could be created manually). But of course, register button should not be displayed. @skoshelev See pull request https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/3274. @skoshelev See pull request https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/3274. @skoshelev See pull request https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/3274. @alessandromontividiu03 Thanks a lot!. Thanks a lot! Actually it can be null in some cases. I think we should also check whether \"Country\" address field is enabled. And when enabled, we should make null validation. Thanks a lot for suggestion! We've already studies all popular systems. We have a list of specific tasks we plan to implement. You can find all of them on this GitHub site (and filter by the next milestone/version).\nif you have any specific suggestions, please create a seperate work item. I thin kwe can close this one because it's just a discussion rather than a specific work item. It works fine out of the box. Thanks. The same ahppens on our demo site - http://demo.nopcommerce.com/. thx. duplicated - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/1. Thanks. The same as per https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3310. Thanks. But right now only one primary store currency is supported and stored in database. It'll require too much changes in source code to support it . Thanks! But right now we don't plan this functionality. It'll make a product configuration a way too complex. It's related to this third-party attribute. Please post this development question on our forums (not nopCommerce issue). Could you please provide a complete list of steps to reproduce the issue?\nnopCommerce properly checks and compares the current version. Please see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Libraries/Nop.Core/Plugins/PluginManager.cs#L436\n. \" would be nice if Nop told me I had incorrect plugin versions earlier, instead of an empty list of plugins.\" - actually this warning is displayed in admin area > system > warnings\nI think we can close this issue as it works fine. We cannot reproduce it.\n. All is fine. Please see http://docs.nopcommerce.com/display/en/Working+with+source+code+and+contributions\n\"develop\" is the latest development version (4.20 now).\nSo you should use \"master\" or \"nopCommerce-4.10-bug-fixes\". If you want to simply download any version, then find them at https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/releases. 1. There's no need to import checkotu attributes. Why if usually store owners have 2-3 ones?\n2. Product attributes can be imported for products (when importing products) excluding the parent one. We can consider importing it as well (but not exporting)\n3. Specification attributes - maybe.\nSo I've renamed a work item to import/export specificationn attributes and remove product and specification ones. Thanks, but we don't plan to implement desktop-based management took. Is it your custom code? There's no such methods in nopCommerce. if this case could you please post it on our forums? This issue tracker for issue in the core. For custom development question it's better to use our forums. @ArturAlekseev What exactly causes POST back? What do you mean by \"iteraction\"? Please provide more info. tags are already localizable. just edit its html content and added any built-in CSS. @ecommerce-tester Just tested, I cannot reproduce it, everything works fine\nP.S. please always provide your nopCommerce version when creating a work item. But it's even better to post it on our forums first (https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/). If it's accepted (approved), then we'll create an issue on GitHub. Thank!. MAC and Linux are not supported yet. We're wotking on it. thx. but we don't plan to support it now. leaving for customization. Actually takes less RAM. And it depends on your server configuration, a shop configuration, size of your catalog, etc.\nClosing this work item as it's not specific. We always work on performance. So if we find something to improve, we do it. duplicated https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/385. Thanks, @rolandh . There was other issue fixed at https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/aeabc20d80e0ad0b2fa861e7bb3738fca80846d6 (a value indicating whethrer the menu was expanded or collapses) wasn't properly saved. But after that fixed the original issue came back. There should be some other fix. Thanks a lot! We'll fix it soon with some additional checks. Thanks. But we've decided to revert back that commit and re-do it more elegant way. Thanks again!. Please post all questions on our forums. We use GitHub for work items only . @dborovsky Thanks a lot. Please create a new pull request. https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12451. @glararan it's juts a first-time run. it's OK for any asp.net application. 1. \"powered by...\" is not citation \n2. it talks about in \"research papers\" and \"academic publications\". so it's not related to nopCommerce. we do not require anything in \"research papers\" and \"academic publications\". @Leftyx Could you please clarufy when you set IgnoreStartupTasks to false?. duplicated. Thanks a lot, Scott! But the link is valid.\nPlease let me clarify. We have two separate demo website. The first one for frontend (https://demo.nopcommerce.com/) and the second one for admin area (http://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/)\nBut https://www.nopcommerce.com/demo.aspx is the informational page on our official site that contains links to both demo websites. 4.20 is not released yet (under development). We won't use tabs in 4.20. We replace them with blocks. So you'll have to us widgets to add custom blocks in 4.20. Customer ID is not a ensitive data as it's internal.

I understand it is still in beta but as it is closed I have tested it and noticed that it doesn't work when the product quantity is more than 1.\nTherefore I am just wondering what should work and what is not supported.\nThanks!\nBR,\nJohann\n. @AndreiMaz thanks for the fast reply. Actually, it works fine after I have tested it again. My mistake was that I thought that the product quantity will automatically calculate the total of the product itself. When I manually add the correct price for the product totals then it also has the correct order totals.\nPerhaps an idea for another work item in case it doesn't fit here. To allow adding/removing/editing products in the orders without the need to calculate the totals of the product.\nThanks again!\nBR,\nJohann\n. @AndreiMaz has this already been implemented or will it not be done? Just wondering because both work items (this and the duplicate) are marked as closed.\nThanks!\nBr,\nJohann\n. @AndreiMaz Thanks!\n. @AndreiMaz I believe this option would be better in the core as it will increase the usability of the shopping cart. It's just easier to understand. Adding this simple option as a plugin is possible but every additional plugin increases server resources needed. It's just too simple to justify a plugin. I would rather replace the current implementation with a simple remove icon as shown in this good plugin above.\nThanks!\nBr,\nJohann\n. @AndreiMaz could you please point me to the duplicate as I couldn't find it.\nThanks!\nBr,\nJohann\n. @AndreiMaz thanks again!\n. If not mistaken this link points to a newer implementation of the same requirement: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/24852/add-the-quantity-textbox-next-to-addtocart-button-when-you-are-exploring-the-products.aspx\nJust in case someone is looking for it.\n. This would be a very good feature when specific tasks only need to be run once a month.\n. ",

    "a3406007": "+1 PLEASE!. We would like to sell by surface area from a roll. For example, we have a 1.5m wide roll of cloth and would like the customer to specify a length from the roll, so the amount sold is a decimal value of metres squared (m2) (width * length). So if the customer wants a length of 1.2m the quantity sold is 1.8m2 (1.5 * 1.2).\nThe calculation is not a problem, but every bit of code and even the columns in the database which deal with order/stock quantities are all integers. This problem could be solved or greatly eased by changing to decimal data types.\nWe just need the customer to be able to specify - and therefore for stock to be managed in - decimal quantities.\nPlease, please consider this for the next release!. ",
    "poyker": "@tigran-avdalyan \nOur (Nop-Templates) Ribbons plugin is available for nopCommerce 4.00.. @suddenelfilio \nThank you for your feedback!\nPlease see my comments below:\n1. Yes, the fields work on JSON serialization level but it doesn't mean they are useless. From an API consumer point of view if I use the fields parameter I would expect exactly this - reduce the size of the response.\n   I agree with you that the implementation should try to get only the specified fields from the database but I have to admit that we couldn't find a feasible solution. If you have done this for the APIs that you have implemented and you are willing to share your experience with us then I will be more than happy  to implement it into the API plugin.\n2. The partial updates actually should be PATCH rather than PUT if we are to follow the conventions explicitly. If you are referring to the product images maybe you have not understood how exactly they work. \n   For example if you want to update a product that has some images and you don't specify the Images property then they will NOT be deleted.\n   \n   PUT /api/products/5\n   {\n   \"product\" : {\n      \"name\" : \"updated name\"\n   }\n   }\nIn the request above only the product name will be updated and nothing will be deleted.\nIf you want to delete the product images then you need to explicitly specify the Images property like this:\nPUT /api/products/5\n{\n  \"product\" : {\n     \"images\" : []\n }\n}\nThe request above will delete all product images for this product.\nActually to fully manage the product images there should be separate endpoints i.e (/api/products/{#id}/images) but they are still not implemented. \n\n3. Agree. There should be a setting in the API plugin that will control if the returned images should be in Base64 format or just a link to the image i.e \"attachment\" or \"src\". I will create an issue for this. \n4. As I said on the conference - the API design is a never ending debate :) So we better choose one naming convention and stick with it. I think the majority of APIs use snake_case and that is why we decided to use this one.\nRegarding the OrderItems, I agree with you. It could be simply Items. We did this mechanically because we have a separate controller called OrderItemsController and also OrderItemDTO etc. and that is why we made the routes with OrderItems. I will create a new issue to correct this.\nRegarding the paging/filtering/sorting, it is all done on the DB level. \nTo be honest the Customers is the only area that I really don't like how we have implemented. But if you have a chance to take a look at the code and give us feedback will be much appreciated.\nWebHooks - this is really what the next step for the API plugin should be. Let's first make sure the rest of the things are stable and working and we will do this one as well. I will create an issue for this.\nThank you again!\n. This will make even more sense to be done for plugins. Furthermore some themes come with a lot of plugins and if you upload a theme from the admin then you should be able to upload the plugins for that theme again from the admin. In reality you usually have only a few themes but quite a lot of plugins in your store.\n. We use the Activity Log for keeping track of the downloaded products from our website.\nSo you can have a new activity type i.e \"Public Store. Download product\" and then write in the Activity Log when a customer downloads a product. This way you will have the exact time. The IP could be added in the Log message as well as the name of the downloaded product.\n. Agree. First name and last name  should not be generic properties but be part of the customer. This will make the search for customers by name much easier.\n. Maybe this is not needed anymore in 3.90. You can close this issue.\nhttp://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/46341/nopcommerce-390-beta-released-please-share-your-impressions.aspx?p=8#184653. Hi @mariannk ,\nThis was basically a \"revert-request\" for one of the previous versions of nopCommerce.\nAt that time we believed that such a change will require pre-styling of the thumbs elements by all theme vendors and requested you to revert it but you did not agree. So now when all theme vendors have already styled these new elements, this change does not make sense anymore (actually it will cause problems and will require again re-styling of the thumbnails). \nSo you can simply ignore this pull request :). I am not sure if this issue is related to the plugins or just Nop.Web but there is no point to create a new issue anyway.\nIt would be great if you could improve ClearPluginAssemblies.proj to delete these locale folders from the plugins. Now if you build the solution every plugin has around 4MB unnecessary locale folder (even if they are needed they could be loaded from the Nop.Web project and there is no need each plugin to have them). . @mmccann-umph \nThis helped me a lot.\nJust go to \"Tools -> Options -> Debugging\" in VS2017 and Uncheck this \"Enable Diagnostic Tools while debugging\". This worked for me.\nI am experiencing some other issues and I am curious if you have them too:\n\nRestart Application or Installing/Uninstalling a plugin stops the Debugger. I guess this is because when the Web.config is changed the whole Nop.Web.exe process is stopped and a new one is started. It would be great if there was a way to continue debugging though.. This is not working properly when you pass some additionalData.\nFor example if you pass the ID of the model let's say the category id the additionalData is a simple int value i.e 1. Then with the current implementation the additionalData is simply lost when it is passed to the constructor of the dictionary: new RouteValueDictionary(additionalData)\nThen in the Invoke method of the component if you have a parameter additionalData it will be null i.e Invoke(string widgetZone, object additionalData)\n\nThe code should be like this:\n//add widget zone to view component arguments\n            additionalData = new RouteValueDictionary()\n            {\n                { \"widgetZone\", widgetZone },\n                { \"additionalData\", additionalData }\n            };\nThis way the passed additionalData will be available in the Invoke method.. In addition to the ViewNotFound we should log also errors when a view could not be compiled. If someone has made some modifications in the Razor files that could not be compiled and the view is accessed the error should be logged in the Log as well. Or if the wrong view is loaded and a different model is passed you will still get a compilation error that needs to be logged.. ",
    "suddenelfilio": "Nop-templates Web Api plugin looks ok, but I attended the devdays this year and spotted various culprits in their implementation:\n- Specifiying fields to be returned without transparantly querying them down to the database is no advantage => you still query all the data, but only at json serialization you filter out the data specified in fields... For what? better bandwidth? Bandwidth is cheap you should focus on server resources. \n- The partial updates using Delta are breaking convention. On one hand you can update only the fields you specify in a PUT, but on the other hand you delete all not mentioned items in a collection/relation? That's not consistent with the expectation of Partial updates.\n- Returning images as BASE64 is effectivly killing off any CDN browser/proxy/server caching you might use as you are still returning a bunch of string data. It would be better to provide the url to image and let the framework used figure out how to render it. Or at least provide a way to select the behavior.\n- Also no fan of snake casing as it does not add any value to the REST principle. If you want to access items from an order your should use api/order//items and not api/order//order_items => why specify order_items when the parent entity you are querying though is already an Order. Logic provides that the items will be order items. It is the same as saying I have an Order class with properties like OrderId, OrderDate, OrderItems and so on... No those properties should be Id, Date, Items  really no need for repeating/prefixen the \"Order\".\n  -Not sure about this one, but I really hope that things like sorting/filtering/paging are done on the datasets in memory (like the fields \"feature\") because again you just lose any performance gain your might get by propagating this down to the data query itself.\nOkay gonna stop rambling on now... sorry for that, but I'm an REST API purist when comes to stuff like this.\nAnother note I believe you might benefit more from introducing something like Web Hooks instead of exposing the API. \n. We changed this using a separate service which is using the mvcmailer. We abuse the messagetokens to update the message templates making them render a json which then gets posted to the other mailer service. The payload gets merged with the json data using MvcMailer and the mail is send. We created a custom Task to replace the original mail task which would differentiate using the internal system or the new one by looking at the emailaccount that should be used for the message template. I have to admit a dirty hack of the current system, but works perfectly.\n. Again look at IdentityServer to handle this for you\n. build a nuget based marketplace where nop can download the package using nuget and install the plugin that way. Also provides upgrade support out the box.\n. true I implemented a an AzurePictureService implementation of th IPictureService which stores the pictures in azure blob storage. Just having to implement the IO part would be so much easier instead of the entire interface as it is about 75%-85% copy-pasting the logic\n. Should you consider a library for QR why not open it to any barcode type supported by the library instead of only QR? You're looking at this from a customer perspective, but what about a store owner? generating barcodes for orders, products and so on which are not WR might be added value. Especially if you keep in mind that barcode scanners (hardware) that support QR are still more expensive than a basic 2D barcode scanner. Main concern here is since this is a web application is how to react on a \"barcode scan\" from a device? I know SEOShop used to have this functionality, but it was flaky at best. Maybe now its better don't know.\n. I implemented this back in version 1.9 :-) I just added a column to the order table isQuote, and then override all Order related methods with a Quote override which would set the column to true. Also updated the UI as well as the email templates to differentiate Order and Quote.\nYou can still see it at http://www.visuatech.be \n. Can you force or expect a customer to change its password every 90 days? Have not heard of many webshops that do this. Also One-time buyers stalking for password updates will kill any change of them buying again at your store.\n. do you believe this necessary if you plan to migrate to .net core? I know core can also target 4.6.x, but then it still is stuck on Windows platforms whereas core 1.x could bring nopcommerce multi platform...\n. I think it would be wise to look at an existing solution like IdentityServer to integrate into nopcommerce as it already has lots of web auth scenario's out of the box. Also looking at the 4.0 release including an upgrade to Asp.Net Core the IdentityServer v4 is already up to the task.\n. If you are enabling this through settings for IIS. Please keep in mind that the dynamic compression module must be installed on the server for it to work, also enabling this might increase load on the server. There are known cases where this degraded the performance.\n. ",

This makes it impossible to use NTEXT to overcome the limitation of 4000 characters for string fields.\nBut I will post here my solution, maybe in the future it will work.\nFirst I added public function to NopEntityTypeConfiguration class:\n```\n/// \n/// Configures all string properies (in addition to those fields for which clearly defined maximum length)\n/// to allow the maximum length supported by the database provider\n/// \npublic virtual void SetStringMaxLength()\n{\n    //get ignorable properties\n    var filterConf = this.GetType().GetProperty(\"Configuration\", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance).GetValue(this);\n    var filter = filterConf.GetType().GetProperty(\"IgnoredProperties\", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance).GetValue(filterConf) as IEnumerable;\n    var ignoredProperties = filter != null ? filter.Select(p => p.Name).ToList() : new List();\nvar names = typeof(T).GetProperties()\n    .Where(p => p.PropertyType == typeof(string))\n    .Where(p=>!ignoredProperties.Contains(p.Name))\n    .Select(p => p.Name).ToArray();\n\nvar expression = names.Select(name => Core.DynamicExpression.ParseLambda<T, string>(name, null));\n\nforeach (var expr in expression)\n{\n    var prop = this.Property(expr);\n    var temp = prop\n        .GetType()\n        .GetProperties(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance).FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == \"Configuration\");\n\n    if (temp == null)\n        continue;\n\n    var obj = temp.GetValue(prop);\n    var maxLength = obj.GetType().GetRuntimeProperty(\"MaxLength\").GetValue(obj);\n\n    if (maxLength == null)\n        //uses ntext in sqlcompact, NVARCHAR(MAX) in SQL Server\n        Property(expr).IsMaxLength();\n}\n\n}\n```\nThen I added code to NopObjectContext.OnModelCreating in line 46:\n//use this approach to determine the Sql CE is not necessary, may have a better solution.\nvar dataProviderInstance = EngineContext.Current.Resolve<BaseDataProviderManager>().LoadDataProvider() as SqlCeDataProvider;\nif (dataProviderInstance != null)\n    configurationInstance.SetStringMaxLength();\nSetStringMaxLength.zip\n.

When you removed the plugin does the problem solved?\n@Xzelsius is right, the plugins are loaded before the database is initialized, and so the error log is nowhere to write.. Hi @rolandh and @haimca, this issue was with assemblies lock, we found a way to fix it in our code, but we need your help, can you check does it work in your instance?. Of course, this fix is attached to this issue (https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/47276d0bee879652178194d6e8c40b48b9e721cc). I also used this method as you described, uploaded the assembly into the cloud and downloaded again, I have no other solution. The setting will be turned on by default. I think if you redeploy new code to an existing install, you will not have any problems. Hello @rolandh. Please see this topic, I think one of solution will fixed you problem. .

You suggest us to add a lot of queries to the database, we think this can lead to a significant site performance drop during the times when it is actively used.. @ArturAlekseev Ok. We'll check your code for database performance, also we'll check our core code too. Thank you for your help.. @ArturAlekseev I admit that you are right that in a certain situation our approach can load a hard disk too much, however, your solution to this problem, given its low probability, seems to me superfluous. Yet, thank you for your wish to contribute to our product. We have created a task based on your proposal. A couple of points if you want to help us further: we don\u2019t use the ExecuteSqlCommand function to execute simple queries, as this make us inflexible, we document all public methods, we use standard rules and camel notation for parameter naming.. We investigated this problem and came to a conclusion that it is not related to our platform. And also with each visual studio update the performance rises.

So you still have to modify the Nop.Web project and enabled SSL there and it uses the installed pfx keys for the machine it is running on, I thought it was enabled dynamically.\nCan we add a page to the documentation for this? I see lots of confused people on the forums referencing old posts from Nop 3.00 etc\nIf the documentation is publicly editable I don't mind writing a short paragraph with screenshot on how to do it.. Nothing was customised code wise, it just had to be enabled in Nop.Web project properties under the debug tab. \"Enabled SSL\" was unticked by default.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/raQKV54.png. Yes.

I will do a pull tomorrow and report back.\nDo you have a link to the commit? Curious what the fix is. \nThanks. Being as I am working from a fresh compile can you think of any way this would have gotten marked as unsafe?

And if I do a redeploy to am existing install do you see any chance of it not updating?

I have not seen this problem come back since I last commented so I guess its magically solved itself.. Fair enough. What is the reason it slows things down? Are the ACLs not already cached in memory? If it is hitting the DB then that is understandable. If it is in memory adding a few operators would barely be an increase of 100 cycles per request.. They are mapped to guest (4). I assume each request from webbots or my external keep alives is creating a new \"guest\" customer?\nWhen are these guest customers removed/cleaned up?\nIt is already up to Customer_Id = 45581, it appears it is clearing some of them but the ID keeps incrementing.

Customer generates a guest customer everytime to call it and no one is logged in. If you hit this function every second you end up with a new guest guid every second also. . The empty guid is mapoed to the guest role. Is this not the same thing? . It turns out cloudflare was breaking the page with its compression. So nothing to do with nop. . Turns out it was cloudflare in the end. Their rocketscript wasn't working . All good I found a way to achieve it. I made my own TopicModelFactory that extends the original Nop one and registered it at startup to overwrite the standard one.\nI changed the redirect path by making my own TopicController and replacing the routes at startup to use mine (which extends the stock nop one).. It appears MemoryCache is broken according to this SO post\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6895956/memorycache-does-not-obey-memory-limits-in-configuration\nSomeone has written a new cache here that won't crash the runtime when memory gets near the limit\nhttps://github.com/haneytron/sharpmemorycache\nCan I override the nop cache using this without changing the nop source code from within a plugin?. Perhaps not however I still get outofmemoryexception when filling this cache. What is the solution? . Thanks for taking the time to do this. I tried adding your code to our nopcommerce plugin and executing it on localhost. I also cannot reproduce it. I will test again on our azure server and see if I can get it to happen.\nThanks. ",

How is the comisi\u00f3n going to be paid?\nIt could be done as reward points. Welcome.\nP.S. I have seen Reward points used to pay affiliates in sites like Groupon, Uber, etc. and I feel it will be simple to implement. In Catalog Settings a Default Values section would be useful. I think this could be more flexible to have some high margin products pay more points and low margin less points. You can specify a multiple of reward points for each product. Examples: 2= double, 0.5= half and 0=none\nFurthermore, this could be handled in the Promotions sections, similar to discount rules. \n. Since special prices as it is now will be replaced my suggestions are: Special Prices, Special Pricing, or Advanced Pricing, \n. Hi Cybernexus:\nI fully agree with you. Furthermore I think this becomes much more complex when we take into account discounts and promotions. I feel this is an area that has to be rethought and V4.00 could be the moment.  Due to its relevance I suggest you post your suggestion as a new topic in the Nop forum\n. Attention has to be paid to handle customers with more than one role that have configured shipping costs. Maybe  apply the lowest cost\n. I don't think so. None of the sites developed by us use this feature. What's the point of enabling it by default? Besides isn't it going to be redone as a plugin?\n. This is already available in v3.80:\nYou only need to import sku columns and only columns that you want to modify\nFor export only columns available in the Basic view (if it is chosen) will be exported\n. In configuration>settings create a new section \"Administration Settings\" for values such as adminareasettings.defaultgridpagesize, adminareasettings.hideadvertisementsonadminarea, etc.\nThis section may include other settings like catalog default settings such as catalogsettings.defaultcategorypagesizeoptions, catalogsettings.defaultmanufacturerpagesize, etc. (otherwise they should be included in Advanced view for Catalog Settings)\nTry to publish in another way all hidden settings or at least list them with a small description in the documentation so they are searchable. Please check this: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/19294/suggestion-updated-show-hidden-settings.aspx . Automatically change adminareasettings.defaultgridpagesize when the user selects another grid page size from the drop-down list, because is annoying, that when, for instance, the administrator is updating a catalog or orders with many records, selects grid size 100 and then he edits one and goes back to the listing, the size is back again to the 15 default.. 1. Bulk editing for Categories and Manufacturers for main fields such as name, published/unpublished and order.\n\nIn Products Bulk Edit add more columns and let the user hide some of them This could be done in Administration Settings commented above. Define more configurable default values for Products/Categories/Manufacturers such as:\nFor products:\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Show on HomePage True\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Show on HomePage False\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Published\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Unpublished\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Mark as New True\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Mark as New False\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Disable Buy Button True\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Set Disable Buy Button False\" . In regard to my previous comment, I just figured out that is not necessary to have defaults for products, since the Copy makes redundant. Other ideas:\nMulti-store? if not hide multi-store options\nMulti-language? if not hide multi-language options\nTrack inventory? If not set values accordingly for inventory control section\nAbility to st some default values for product, categories, etc. such as pages sizes, etc.. There is a plugin for this. Unfortunately that plugin was not upgraded for v3.90. A couple of examples would be helpful. Combine it with the Shipping by Total plugin. If I understand well, as it is working now the payment is made to the store owner and he then distributes it manually to the vendor(s) involved in the order. Even if partial payments is implemented, the payment would be done to the store owner and some portions of it will be credited to the vendor(s). Therefore INMO the store owner is the only one that can change the payment status.. >  Right now \"Info\" tab looks really huge\n\nNot a big problem because it only looks huge when in Advance mode. \n\nI would also like to include simplifying the product details page by moving the inventory management to it's own tab.\n\nMaybe I would just leave Inventory Method and Stock Quantity in info and have the rest in a separate tab \"Advance inventory\". Maybe another tab \"Other Mappings\" for Manufacturers, Related Products and Cross sells\nMaybe it would look cleaner and could be better displayed if  if  everything is kept just  in one column\n. I guess it is better to allow a product X time the normal percentage of reward points, where X can be =0 or a factor that allows to for example pay double (X=2) reward points. For better results post al your questions in the Nop forum. Are you going to have individual price lists or will you handle a few price lists for types of customer. We have the second with some other individualised price list without any impact in performance.\nFor Sales Managers check affiliates feature of Nop.  Customer attributes may also be of help. There is a plugin for that: http://www.nopcommerce.com/p/1882/nop-car-parts-filter.aspx. Hi Andrei:\nIs it related to #271 ?. This should be configurable. Workitemfor selling by attributes already exists: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/18\nOr maybe you mean PAngV (base price) that already exists and can  be enabled (in Advanced mde). It is common to have some clerks preparing the orders and other approving them. We have a couple of clients using this feature.  They use two roles one is Buyer who can view the companies assigned prices/products and prepare the order and another for Authorizer who can prepare orders (add products to cart) and authorize them (proceed beyond the shopping cart). It must read: \"It should be visible for un installed plugins\".. Make it configurable. There is a plugin which might solve this problem. I think that NopAdming handles grouped  specifications. There is a multi-tenant plugin that could be used for this purpose. All bugs and fixes are always done in later versions (4.x) and never within the same version (3.9.x). By choosing  4.0 you also get the advantage of big performance improvements of AS:NET Core platform . There is a plugin which might do the job.\nCheck these too. ",

Can't reproduce this bug \n\n. Thank you for the contribution!. Hey Boyko! Could you please clarify: what are these changes for?. Hi! Thank you for the pull request. This issue has been already fixed by our team during the migration to the latest version jQuery: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/408b0b06a459bc094476445297123dc5b2e33028. @manojkulkarni30 thank you very much for your pull request but I have fixed this issue another way: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/7321e13fcbd04abecf9e9727f95bc0d05f39df74. @tigran-avdalyan Why do you think it should be right?. @tigran-avdalyan but now it's right for RTL and left for LTR as you said, and everything looks fine.. @Peymanpn hi.\nThank you very much for your pull request! \nUnfortunately we decided not to implement this functionality out of the box.. Hi! I noticed you have fixed the merge conflict i mentioned before. Thank you.\nWill there be any updates regarding other issues I mentioned in comments?. Oh I'm sorry I should have clicked a common \"Submit\" button after all comments are done. I hope you see them now!. Hi!\nI merged your pull-request. I reviewed the code one more time and made required changes by myself.\nPlease see the commit: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/a7ab9fa5462ecea1e190c3d8a630e7d3b47584ec\nYou can see that I removed such labels as\naria-label=\"@T(\"ShoppingCart.AddToCart.CustomerEnteredPrice.Label\")\"\naria-label=\"@T(\"ShoppingCart.AddToCart.Quantity.Label\")\"\naria-label=\"@T(\"ShoppingCart.Quantity.Label\")\"\nsince related inputs already had labels.. @cnEUL @justindongqiang hey there! Could you please clarify: the issue still exists?\nSeems like everything is ok. Yes, it doesn't have any header. Is it the only issue for now?. @rajupaladiya yes. @rajupaladiya your ccs file root-theme-styles.css contains errors. That's why minification doesn't work and appropriate .min.css filw could not be found. Fix errors before enabling css bundling and minification.. Hint is required\nAnd use the following text for locale resource: Image alternate text. Don't forget to remove added locale resources when uninstalling the plugin. Don't use capital letters for each word. Please check other locale resources as well. Why is it Search.SearchBox.TextLabel and not Search.SearchBox.Label? I find it more logical. All the locale resources should be also added to upgrade sql as well (at the top where all the resources are added). There is no such locale resource. There is no such locale resource. I'm not sure if we need to add aria-label here? Isn't it enough if we just add \"for\" attribute to the previous label? Or there are some diffucults if we have few inputs with the same name on the page. Coulf you please clarify?. It was already done by nopCommerce team. The same formatting issue as previous. I'm sorry for these confusing comments! Forget about it. Extra lines between block are only in WidgetsNivoSliderViewComponent and not in Controller. ",

    "ArturAlekseev": "I think this idea is wrong. How it is now is fine. All user addresses are of same type. If billing address is enabled then user can select during checkout which one to use as billing and which one as shipping.\nAs for address fields - I think that just common should be used:\nname, email, phone, address, zip. No need for more like fax etc.\nShop owners or shipping companies need only user phone and name to contact him about delivery time (if courier). Email is needed for extra contact possibility. And address/zip for shipping method.\nSo no need to add such feature as to enable/disable these fields from admin area.\np.s. I think the most needed feature for 3.9 is navigation speed up considering a lot of categories/products.. I have >10k categories now. First i'v added caching. But it does not solve all problems.\nBecause even if they are cached they are all transferred in response (html) and its a huge data to transfer with each request. Also kendo ui dropdownlist that is used everywhere to add/select category (except for product list page) can't manage so many of them.\nI think the only reasonable and fast solution is on categories list page add ability to show category id (i'v made it to show selected category id in additional field under the table). And then everywhere else I change dropdown list to EditorFor (so that user just add categoryid).\nIts easy to have 2 windows opened in explorer where you can look category id on one page and enter it on another. And what is more important is that it is very fast.\n. Adding caching does not solve the problem fully.\nIf we have > 1000 categories, then even if they are cached HTML size is very big and badly loaded by browsers (especially mobile). Not counting that its hard to select needed one from such a long list.\nMaybe a view design should be different when categories number is greater than some number.. Maybe this way:\nhttps://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/1173\n. Maybe i'm not very good in C#.\nStatic class can contain only methods (no objects). And we must share objects of IMapper and MapperConfiguration.\nIf to make static class that return these objects from its methods then still methods are executed for each request.\nI'v made the same solution but class is registered in dependecyregistrar with .SingleInstance(); so it runs only once.\n. Forgot to add check for published = true. So this example will load even hidden categories.\n. Why it is made as plugin? Multistore is a core feature and discounts too.\n. For Product table:\nIndex key column: Id\nIncluded columns:\nDeleted\nVendorId\nProductTypeId\nManageInventoryMethodId\nStockQuantity\nMinStockQuantity\nUseMultipleWarehouses\nMaybe not exactly this index is needed considering some columns are already indexed in other indexes.\n. Same optimizations are needed for Products table.\nWhen there are a lot of products in it (>600k) I get 45% time consumption in SearchProducts procedure when navigating from category to category.\nBut if products table is fully indexed (all columns) then its still not very fast (around 16-20%) - maybe SearchProducts procedure should be made not so complex.\n. Then there should be a second option for guests to disable billing address.\nIt's a common need to disable it (especially for Russia where people do not know what is it - billing address).\nOr just make this option to also work for guests.\nAlso nearly in all cases we do not need it. We get payment online and only need shipping address where to send products. No one gets payment (not online) at billing address and/or sends there any documents.. In 4.10 this issue is still persist.\nIf user does not have any addresses BillingAddress form is shown.\nWhy you don't implement it as I'v shown before?\n_orderSettings.DisableBillingAddressCheckoutStep means that this form should be skipped in all cases.\nIn my example we just skip it and set billing address same as shipping when shipping address is selected.\n. I will look more into it. I think it is related to many pictures on file system (I use pictures not in db). Recently I had more than one million pictures with IsNew property set. And it took 13 seconds to show page with 4 pictures of categories.\nMaybe code that delete previous thumbnails take long time because of files list is parsed on file system for each picture.\nNo need to generate all thumbnails. But categories + product thumbnails (that are shown during category browsing) by default.\nAbout workitem #1610.\nThe best way is to remove binarydata property at all and omit ability to store pictures in database.\nIf store has few pictures they can be easily copied/backuped from file system. If store has a lot of pictures then database feature is unacceptable. My shops have > than 300gb of pictures.. Also I think its a good idea to create dbo.ThumbsMap table that will contain references to all Thumbs.\nId\nEntityType\nEntityId\nSize\nand maybe filename (because of seo)\nThis will speed up thumbs deletion because there will be no need to search file system for files.. Yes. The issue is here (in GetPictureUrl/DeleteThumbs):\nstring[] currentFiles = System.IO.Directory.GetFiles(thumbDirectoryPath, filter, SearchOption.AllDirectories);\nIt takes 8 seconds. Else code is fast.. Not using MultipleThumbDirectories. It will not help, because SearchOption.AllDirectories. It will search in all directories anyway...\nAs I remember in total there are around 6 millions images (original + thumbs).\nI'm rebuilding PictureService to use Thumbnail_Mapping table right now.\nAlso fixed Binary loading only to load it if thumbnail generation is needed (using 3.8 so far).\nDon't know is it exist in 4.0. Will check 4.0 once test my changes.. Did it using extra table. Now everything works fast and easy. Will make branch for 4.0 if it is needed there.. No. Issue is in this command:\nSystem.IO.Directory.GetFiles(thumbDirectoryPath, filter, SearchOption.AllDirectories).\nI have already implemented additional table and everything is very fast with it. Table uses only 138 mb of space on hdd.. Here is a solution. Try it and you will see that it is much better than using GetFiles: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/2760. Hm. I'v deleted this fork (thought this commit will also disappear) and made a new one from another fork here: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/2736. No matter which power of sql server you have - 1000 sql server requests will be nearly 1000 times slower than 1 request.\nIt is not possible to override PrepareCategorySimpleModels function work using plugin. It is not supported.. I know that it is by design and not a bug. But this design is not usable for large categories count. Because first time categories are loaded is very long for large categories count. And for each time cache is cleared it will be regenerated. And these:\nName = category.GetLocalized(x => x.Name),\nSeName = category.GetSeName(),\nfor 20000 categories is like forever.\nCheck it out: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/2741. Thanks. I will know now. Its even possible to override views by inserting custom view engine. But still its easier to change nopcommerce code than to write plugin. And I think its a wrong idea to change basic nopcommerce parts using plugins. It will add possibility that plugins will not work with other.. I don't ague. Just thoughts. Bad SQL Server is not an issue here. Even good SQL server will have much higher load when it gets a lot of requests instead of one.\nAbout super high amount of categories. I don't think that nopcommerce core shold be limited to few categories. It has support for different warehouses, different vendors. So it is planned to be used for large companies. And large companies most likely to sell a lot of different products that need a lot of categories.\nAnyway I think it's better to allow user to select whether he wants to load all categories at start and use them from cache (small store with few products and few categories) or not.\nFor maintenance - I don't think this change will make something much harder to maintain. Because not much change.\nAnd p.s. I don't think I have bad SQL server. Its on dedicated server with 16GB of ram and 2 CPUs at 3Ghz (8 cores total).\nEven if you have 1000 categories it will become slower in usage.\nI have on one store more than 20000 categories. I was not able to wait till the end of top menu load. It was > 10 minutes.\nEven If I count that it is only for the first time. Ok. Store cached all categories and then. When admin changes category, adds new, delete one. Cache is cleared. And store will become unusable for 10+ mins. This is not an option.. This way you will load only root categories.. I have > 20000 categories in one shop. With original code shop is unusable. You need to wait > 10 min to load shop for the first time. With changed pages load is lower than 1 second.. I was not able to find out why it is happening. Mostly this code works as expected. But sometimes exception occurs. And Id is not always 0. Sometimes > 0. Maybe its some sort of EF bug.. Well ofcourse I'v found where it happens. It happens for me when I debug. So my url is localhost:port.\nAnd the issue is that it should log error about wrong url without making any exception that says there is a problem inserting error log record. And mostly it saves this error fine. But some times later exception.... Synced with latest commits and don't experience it anymore.. Just update entityframework or sync with latest commits.. Without this feature it will be much harder to develop cach machine plugins, because they will need to make special payment plugins for it (for each gateway).. I'll try to make such plugin.. I thought a little and it can't be done this way.\nPayment workflow is different:\n0. ProcessPayment just sets PaymentStatus.Pending;\n1. Plugin sends data to payment gateway about order and sum (in PostProcessPayment).\n2. Gateway processes payment and then makes back request to plugin (using get or post method).\n3. Get or post plugin method then checks if server request is correct (authorized) and if result is \"paid\" then plugin should send notification to cash machine.\nIts not possible to override custom payment plugin method that processes server request.. Ok. I will override MarkOrderAsPaid then.. Interesting to know why. Not that I just want my solution to be merged.\nThis is a terrible bug in implementation where each time HDD is stressed for searching thumbnail files.. Well it is wrong.\n1. \"file system doesn't work much in this case\" - wrong because original code:\nvar currentFiles = System.IO.Directory.GetFiles(thumbDirectoryPath, filter, SearchOption.AllDirectories);\nis killing HDD when there are a lot of pictures. Maybe 1000 is ok. But 200000 ...\nIt is done in function where delete picture thumbs occurs.\nNow look.\nImagine we have added 10000 new products in database. And their pics are marked \"IsNew\". Now google bot or yandex box is starting to analize shop.\nAnd we get 10000 requests to file system to search for files using GetFiles function.\nWith a lot of pictures in pics folder you get 10 seconds to generate page instead of 1 second. This is not thoughts. I'v experienced it. And it is not the result of slow server.\nOfcourse you can write external code that will generate thumbnails for all products during products add. But why generate all if you can just fix shops code...\n\nAlso you are checking HDD file existance for each thumbnail that should be shown during page request. 20 products on page and you get 20 checks per page. Now think that google or yandex bot is working on site. So many checks... And check for record in database is much faster than check for file existance in file system. Not to mention non ssd hdds workflow...\n\nThat is why i'v made this change to my shop. After that my shop is working extremely fast.. Also a small update: For unknown reason when requesting pages with products list by using categories - not all thumbnails are generated leaving some products without picture (without link to image). Clearing cache and reloading page shows pictures. I will try to find why.. Will it be added to future releases? Or I should write a plugin?. I will make a plugin soon. It will be free.\nThou it has one problem so far I experience on site with many pictures updates.\nI don\u2019t know how to fix it. Some thumbnails do not generate on first request.\nMy code do not interfere with thumbnails generation so I don\u2019t know why it happens.\nFrom: arzybek19 notifications@github.com \nSent: Monday, February 4, 2019 7:04 AM\nTo: nopSolutions/nopCommerce nopCommerce@noreply.github.com\nCc: Artur Alekseev arthuralexeev@gmail.com; Mention mention@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [nopSolutions/nopCommerce] Thumbnails table reference (#2760)\nWill it be added to future releases?

Well. I'm not at the latest ref. Maybe this is the issue.. I'v synced with latest commits. And issue is gone.. Switching platform target to Any CPU resolves the problem, but not for Publish.\nOriginally was x86.\nI'v added this line: <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier> to the Nop.Web.csproj under <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>. And Publish worked.\nThis was suggested here: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/1321\n. Also because it is related to publishing. I had a problem. When I'v published release version to file system (to folder) - only some plugins from plugins folder were copied. I don't know why. There were only a few from originally available (like 4-5).. Yes, I'v rebuild it with release settings before (many times).\nStrange thing is that now i'v tried it without <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier> and it compiled fine and published fine.\nMaybe my components cache was damaged (yesterday i'v deleted it).\n. You make payment failed view inside your payment plugin. Then you give link to this view to your payment gateway. If payment is failed then user is redirected by payment gateway to your view.\nI have such workflow for my two gateways I use (russian Robokassa & Yandex).\nI think all redirect gateways are similiar.. You can see widget here: https://www.cdek.ru/clients/widget.html\nWhen I press inside textbox where you need to select city - it causes page reload. If widget is moved outside of form it does not happen.. Xzelsius, is you are against LargeDatabase setting - propose something better.\nAbout categories drop down:\n1) If you have 20000 categories it takes forever to generate categories list for dropdown (because list contains full path for each category)\n2) This list is very large and unusable.\n3) It is transferred to client with each request. If client is mobile device then its terrible not only for bandwidth but also for cpu/ui usage.\n_dbContext - used to execute SQL WHERE IN query.\nIf it makes harder to maintain - we can move sql queries to some one file like it is done with cache.\nI think the goal is to make shop versatile and not easiest to maintain.\nEasiest to maintain is one product shop. But nopcommerce with a LOT of its features is not the one by default.\np.s. same thing happens to manufacturers dropdown list. But so far I have only a few, so have not changed them.. It's just a fast solution. Need to update my plugins first and I'm not sure these changes will be approved into nopcommerce. I don't need ajax search mostly because nearly all products are loaded/updated automatically.. Instead of _dbContext.Set you should use IRepository.Table\nBtw are there any real reasons that we should use IRepository instead of IDbContext?. ",
    "cnEUL": "In my opinion very important. We have many multilanguage pages and when i look at google, it is a mixed language. Title English, Some description german and so on.  Nearby the Homepage has SEO fields with no effects (from Topic). Also other SEO basics are missed.. We are using the web edition of MSSQL server. it has all and some hoster rent it for about 10 or 20 EUR with support up to 8 Cores. is very easy to maintain with the free ssms. And it can support a lot of nopcommerce shop systems on one physical host. In any case it is a cheep alternativ in the actual situation.. We are using the www.hosteurope.de as hosting provider. And they have that option with their rootserver. the web edition supports much memory, cores, agent and lot of other fine stuff. Also the backup is supported in compressed mode.\n. Yes not easy to find... i will call them tomorrow in the german office time.\n\n(for any two cores we pay actually 10 EUR, based on a root server with windows datacenter and SSD its a very fast thing). I found a link in this moment, its for reseller and doc is in german. But with www.deepl.com you get a very good translation.\nThere you find a section for the web edition as reseller, only 8,40 EUR.\nhttps://www.hosteurope.de/download/PVL/Leistungsverzeichnis_Reseller_Level_L_final_v1.5.pdf\n. Very good and usafull function, because some suites like a nopTemplate theme exists of 10 plugins and more and it needs 20 minutes to install all. It seems for me that the system restarts after every plugin. Also great for us as hosters would be an comamndline command (or utility ) to install plugins so we could setup a new shop completely in silent mode.. We have many countries in Europe that use different languages at the same time. Whether it's Italy, Switzerland or Belgium.\nWhen we talk about the new GDPR, and now with version 4.10 we have a good tool to react to it, it would be a pity if we could only offer the texts for the different approvals in one language. The NopCommerce is multilingual by default, the GDPR should also be and of course directly to the start of version 4.10.. For the compliance of the GDPR it is important, among other things, that the user understands quickly what it is all about. A field description and a checkbox are usually not sufficient here. I put here a link or alternatively a kind of style which represents the additional information expanded in the page. \nThis gives the customer an overview and if he already knows what it is all about, he can quickly decide whether or not to give his consent.\nI would like to see this option in the final version 4.10.. Thank you,\nso i will try to make a small script in sql doing that.\nWhen it is ready I will post it.\nchris\nVon: Andrei Mazulnitsyn [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nGesendet: Donnerstag, 28.

Hello, Andrei,\nyes, this is already the latest version. There wasn't a gray box before. But without a headline the box hangs a little in the air.. Hi Justin, Margin looks very good on your screen. I was using chrome and now i am downloading the newes nop snapsot to look on it in english. give me 30 minutes.\nAnother idea with the headline, i dont know if its good for you, but to see all GDPR questions inside the grey 'Options' box is also ok. Because Newsletter is just something with the GDPR. By the way, why is the Newsletter checkbox right and the GDPR Left?. I compiled with the nopCommerce version from today and under Chrome, Edge and IE the distance is ok now. Don\u2019t know what it was.\nThe only thing is Header and the question if it\u2019s not better to bring them all in the upper 'Options' box.. @justindongqiang  you are right\nchris. @mariannk @justindongqiang \nyes, the headline is not resolved, the other point, with distance is ok now.\nBut all GDPR checkboxes dont have a headline. Like \"GDPR - CONSENTS\" or something else.. Yes, now i can compile again. Perfect!. Did not work also in the newes dev build.\nI looked in App_data folder, the datasettings.json has no creditals (obly the fieldnames) and the installedplugin.json did not exist in the app_data folder.\nPerhaps it helps.. Other thing i noted is the absend of SQL Compact. There is only SQL Server option now.\n\n. so the section \"Database Informatin\" could be dropped completly? right?\n. sorry, but it not insstalls on SQL Server (not talking about the dropped compact). i understand.. Found some infos on #2794 [https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2794] and is was written: removed this from the Version 4.10 milestone 21 days ago\nSo it has also to be dropped from the changelog.\n. \nfor clearification-. I understand that. But at the moment the name of the unit stored there is used to calculate the base price in the product (PAngV). Conversely, this would mean that products with a base price would only be on a kilo basis. Just to mention it again :-)\n. @KrzysztofPajak \nFor me i had a similar problem, i dont want the sa account on a webshop. So i created it with sa user, and then i chand the permissen by a powershell script. Perhaps it hels, so you not need to craete it by normal user. \nAlso the Application pool has this sicurity like this:\n    function Set-PermissionSspi()\n    {\n        Write-StackInfo\n    $Hostname = $Script:ini[\"CUSTOMER\"][\"Hostname\"]\n\n    $Sql =  \"USE [Master]\", `\n            \"CREATE LOGIN [IIS APPPOOL\\$Hostname] FROM WINDOWS;\", `\n            \"USE [$Hostname]\", `\n            \"IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = N'$Hostname')\", `\n            \"BEGIN\", `\n            \"  CREATE USER [$Hostname] FOR LOGIN [IIS APPPOOL\\$Hostname];\", `\n            \"  EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', N'$Hostname'\", `\n            \"END;\"\n    Send-SqlCommand $Sql\n}. @AndreiMaz\n\nwhy dont make SKU as a unique key which allowes null?. Sorry for that, i found it translateable in the Plugin Edit-Dialog.. I mean the third field, with the URL. It is an explanation, but has its own field name with hint. It should have moved in like this. If it is only a hint, the field name and hint would have to go away and then the explanatory text just below the field above, right?.

Hello,\nI tried to reproduce that with the current beta.\nIf I install German and save the descriptions in German, and change the SEO name to \"Apfel\", I get the correct translated link on the overview page and according to the language setting.\noverview:\nhttp://nop41.eulanda.eu/camera-photo\ngerman: http://nop41.eulanda.eu/apfel-icam\nenglish: http://nop41.eulanda.eu/apple-icam\nIf I did not understand this correctly, please specify it in more detail or add a screenshot - thank you.. oh, that's not funny. It looks like a bug :-). Hello,\ni have looked under this, but the combobox is translateable. Or do you looked at another part?\n\n. When you type in something unique, it tells that it is duplicated content. (this is when a \"-2\" is added). But it shows the message in any case when you write something like \"this is my sample link\". Because blank is not allows it changes to \"this-is-my-sample-link\". which is ok, but the message says also in this case the link exists and is doubel, so it has to change.\nSo my idea, to clearify the message (has two cases like i has written under 1) or make two strings avvailable, so the user knows ok it is really double (exists) or it is nout fully compative to the sluggy function.\nAlso the message says \"Pagename\" but it is only the link. So my idea is \"The name is not conform or double. It is corrected in '{0}\"\nThe message \"The name\" is mor egeneral because its the SEO-Name and not the Pagename.\nChris \n. if i enter in the slug field something with blanks it tells the same warning, as if its a already existing slug.\nBut in this case, it is only a correction of the entered text. So we need a more general text for the warning, or otherwise no warning on only corrections (and warnung only if the slug value already exists). \ni prefer only a more general text, which tells that its something to correct (slug-conform) or is just existing. But also the text \"Pagename \" is for me not the best value, because its a slug (means in this case only the link). So for the user all is much clearer.\n\nthe next is not a seo pagename in my opinion, because it is going to table UrlRecord. And is used as a link and also shown with mouseover like any link. Do you think it is not better to say \"Link\" instead of pagename also?. ok. so in the table it should be:\n9 Category apparel\n10 ProductTag apparel-2\nSo apparel should only be in there one time, right?. That's a very good thing. I look forward to it now, when it is approved. Overall, version 4.20 would look very good with more SEO options.. Yes, also for me it seems strange. \nIn Google searchconsole i get warnings and also soft errors 401 like : \"\n\"en/search?q={search_term_string}\", \n\"en/benutzer-91ef1ba8-6b70-4bab-86de-98190dcfd19a?orderby=15\"\n\"en/ausstattungspakete-4e78996c-ad51-4f48-94f6-4ec8221c2e1d?pagesize=6\"\nalso changelanguage in searchresults.\n. For multi language sites like ours also the hreflang tag is important and there is a spacial sitemap also for this. So for me also this woulb be good to be covered in a second xml sitemap. because it differs from the normal sitemap.xml.\n\nhttps://www.eulanda.eu/en/packages-of-options-3\n\n\n\n. Good idea, when I forgot it, I have to disable it on sql level. And it occurs often... . I know that the browser follows, but Google not seems to follow. I have sawn this on a permission issue on site map. Also we have lot of results in Google and only used the language identifier, but in the results you see the URL without that. I was confused about that, so I tried out to find, why. It seems fur me it's the response header of inactive urlrecord entries. . It's right to list all the good things in other systems, there are always a lot of points missing in your own system. I also would like to have some of these points, but I can understand very well, and personally find it a good decision to go the way to platform independence first. \nI am also sure that some of the points will come in 4.30 and later. But I also accept that the developer resources are limited and the path is not short.\nI also know some of the listed shops and their weaknesses and in the end I switched to nopCommerce because the overall system is simply very good - in my opinion this is what nopCommerce really is.\nDue to the upcoming platform independence the headwind will certainly be stronger, but there will still be a lot more users and therefore also a lot of new and good plugins, this is a completely natural way.\nWhat I would also like to see, however, is an official roadmap that should also be evaluated and corrected by the core staff. Less because I would switch back to another product, but much more to prepare myself better.. Hi, what could we do with such a feature, i mean what is the reason for such a feature in the real world? @RomanovM. Hello,\ndid you restartet the shopengine after changing shedular?\n. Hello,\nI just checked the Windows settings, countries like Italy, France, Germany and others have the currency symbol to the right of the number. \nSo if the default has to be changed or corrected anyway, then you could also set the currency symbol in the format mask to the right side, i.e. \"0.00 \u20ac\". This is more common in the EURO area.\nIf it has no other side effects i prefer \"#,##0.00 \u20ac\" as a default in euro zone.. Where is that option to find, i have used the standard compiled version.. Hi, but this is source code, i have used the binary - original. . ;-) Thank you. But you can also access all tables very well via OData. Nop4You offers a plugin which allows access to almost all tables. In this way a special import or export can be realized.\nOData is, if you look at it abstractly, a kind of ODBC over HTTP and you can control the protocol with Windows board tools also from scripting languages like simple VbScript.. perhaps it is an idea to move the service task routine from install/uninstall the ECB plugin inside the plugin.. Hi,\nif you uninstalls the ECB Plugin, and then also delete it. The Schedular has the ECB entry still there. It is also enabled and this give exceptions in the log.\nA the end i found this, because the nopcommerce gave a hin \"There are Warniungs\" and the warnings told me for better performance i can uninstall plugins (ECB because it is not used). I did it, but then the Schedular Entry was not deleted. The Plugin was delete from disk and the entry gives exceptions.\nIn my opinion, the Schedular Entry has to be dropped after deleteing the plugin.\n\n. I can understand that it is not possible to delete the task because other plugins use it. But if you uninstall ECB and then press the Delete button, the task will run on the hammer, so to speak. There's nothing he can start.\nWe'd have to talk about a conceptual change here. At least you should prevent the delete button from being activated... @RomanovM \nHello M. Romanov, is it not possible to set a switch inside the export routine to utf-8?\n@w-tbury \nIt is a workaoround, but you can use windows notepad to do this. SaveAs and select UTF-8. It works for me.. The data of the GDPDR may not be deleted in my opinion so simply. Here the regulations of the tax office are of higher value. In this case, orders and everything that led to this order or invoice may not be deleted.\nIf within the order therefore an address is referred to, where further information, which are bill-relevant, one must lift these surely.\nThe log must be kept in any case, because if someone has agreed to something and discards this at any time, a proof is required.\nThe deletion internally sets a flag, so that this address can no longer be used via standard mechanisms.  Which is to be checked if certain parts of the address are not relevant for billing and that these certain fields can then be deleted.\n@RomanovM\n@pantonis\n. Nop Commerce only sets the deleted flag when deleting records. You can therefore always select an ID using SQL commands - but as already described above, when deleting data that goes into accounting, it must not disappear, but only be removed from normal access. The log must also be kept. In my opinion this is as it is, ok. . if you have several languages in templates (or other editors), open also one window for each language. This helps to control the translation also very easy.. ",

Presently we seem to have a large number of sign ups that are spam related, so a bulk delete would be an excellent choice for us.\n\nbr Chris\n\nI agree with @ChrisEtzerodt . Some features looks not important for nopcommerce dev team but most of nopcommerce user avoid modify original codes and that feature needs modify original codes. Nop dev team may assign to community, like that simple features.. I think filters should be more rich. For examples: \n-user can filter more than one category, manufacturer etc.\n-stock quantitiy,\n-price, old price\nMain idea; store admin can filter and manage products without Excel or another 3rd party software..

    "cybernexus": "I am in the process of testing and finalizing a plugin that provides not only this functionality but automatic license key download / installation for purchased products.\nThere are two components...\n1. A store side plugin that provides the custom setup and WebAPI (data feeds)\n2. A client side plugin that provides core functions to other plugins and consumes the above WebAPI. This plugin also installs / uninstalls / upgrades plugins with code that supports executing sql upgrade scripts and adding language resource strings that may be included in the downloaded package.\nI found quite a few issues that needed to be explored while writing the code. The big one was versioning and the limit of having only one download option for a product. What I ended up doing involved creating a new table that stores a one to many relationship of product to downloads with additional data stored in the mapping table such as plugin version, nop version etc. \nAll in all the functionality is rather robust and so far I have been fairly happy with the results but... I would rather have this functionality built into the default plugin management and would be more than willing to contribute / integrate any code I have written to serve the entire community. \n. I've been thinking about this and how it applies to the customization's I've made. In my opinion it feels like calculating pricing has become one of the most extremely complex code segments in the core installation Perhaps it might be doable to abstract it all away and create a core pricing engine that allows you to create pricing engine types that can be installed as plugins (with the defaults being, 'simple price','tier price', 'pricing by attribute combination','customer enters price', etc). Doing this would allow you to develop custom pricing scenario's that would have their own admin ui and portable  logic code base that outputs the needed price info for the core abstract engine. \nIt seems like it might be a good deal of work and thought needed to achieve so this might be something to think about for version 4.0? Any thoughts or am I completely insane for even mentioning it!?\n. Found a bug in the initial implementation caused by two different plugins having the same controller and action names. Now there is only one path added to location arrays, which contains a tokenized string that is replaced at run time based on the controller context and a class attribute.\nThis change also gives developers the ability to dynamically change the default location of their views for a particular controller. \nThe only drawback to this implementation is that it causes a default view location of \"{DynamicPluginPath}/{1}/{0}.cshtml\" to be added. I'm not sure if this would cause an issue or not, I haven't found anything in my tests so far to indicate an issue.\n. Thought this would work but I ended up finding a rather large problem that does not happen when used from my plugins implementation. Cancelling Pull request.\n. ",

Most functions are already working. its marked for the 4.10 milestone so should be integrated with the next release. @sc0ttc0 Will try to update my branch to 2.1 preview1 over the weekend. I do see that there is still no implicit many-to-many relationship support. While it can be done explicitly (and that is what I have in my branch) it makes things easier if implicit support is there. \nWhile I believe I already have .Include() for the requests have the lazy loading just means I don't worry about missing anything\n. @tigran-avdalyan my branch updated to preview 2. Unfortunately there is a bug in EF core https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/11689 that stops it from even being able to do a basic install. It is fixed for their next release though. ClearPluginAssemblies is a compile time task if I remember correctly. Once published there is no hint of that project. Since they have recently updated to target .net core 2.1 the current develop branch should run. Only thing I can think of offhand that may not work is some file paths. Having windows style paths on a unix system don't always work. I've seen that before and while I'm not sure exactly what is going on, I do have a possible workaround.\nFor me if I get that message the trick is to build at least 1 plugin.

Please note that I used a different method for determining the currency ID.  I am using the currency code within the Order table and mapping to the PayPal currency ID.  This should cover a case of a store accepting more than one type of currency.\n. PBKDF2 would be a nice feature to have, but would likely be a detriment to high traffic sites.  A high number of iterations on a site that processes several logins and registrations would be starved of CPU time.\nIt would be nice if nopCommerce were able to support (mostly) seamless upgrades of the hash format without breaking existing users.  If you change CustomerSettings.HashedPasswordFormat on an existing site from SHA1 to SHA256, If I read the code correctly, login attempts would compare passwords with different hash types, effectively breaking the site.\nAn indicator on the Customer entity of which hash format is used probably wouldn't hurt security.  A determined attacker will likely be able to determine the hash type used by inspecting the number of characters that the hash is anyway.\nAs an added bonus, if a customer with an older hash format logs into a system currently using a newer hash format, we can write the new value and thus the customer base will progressively migrate to a more secure format.\n. Please see #1664 for a proposed solution\n. Hi @AndreiMaz - I was hoping to see a more comprehensive solution merged into develop.  It looks like all we are doing is changing the default hash to SHA2-512 instead of SHA1.  Were you able to look at #1664?. This is unfortunately another instance where nopCommerce has a hard dependency on an encryption or hashing scheme.\nSimply replacing 3DES with AES would break anything that was previously encrypted, as there is no means of determining what encryption scheme was used for that bit of information.\nIt sounds like we really need something resembling a plugin architecture for encryption so that it is more up to the user how their data is protected.\n. Also, would removing the functionality to store credit cards also disable Nop's capability to process recurring payments?\n. Please see pull request #1263 for proposed solution\n.

I think we need to discuss the model schema that will be indexed. In our solution we indexed Nop.Web.Models.Catalog.ProductOverviewModel. This way we prevent running all the mapping/preparing methods on every page load. Background task implementation prepares the view models and upload to search domain, all catalog actions calls directly search service instead of product service and prepare methods.\n.

    "sc0ttc0": "I think it would definitely be worth looking at output caching .. even if there were some caveats around initial implementation e.g.\n- guest users only\n- you have nothing in the cart \n- you cannot used recently viewed products.\n\nin that sense definitely worth making the cart on each page and recently viewed an ajax load.  (often wondered why these are not just plugins that ship with nop - they would lend themselves to widgets - performance ??)  You could fudge it a bit and just implement ajax that returns the cart html as is so that it isn't in the initial page load?\n\nAlternative thought - some way to flag that the user has no basket items (cookie?) and if recent items is off you could use an Nginx or similar on the front end to cache pages.\n. Any further thoughts on this.  I think it would be good - not sure if bootstrap licensing might be an issue (ie it might change in the future).   Certainly appears to be popular and gives developers a layout language they'd be familiar with ... I guess arguably you can do it already if you want to.  Maybe ship the default theme plus a bootstrap theme ?    It would also allow developers to use other design frameworks built on top of bootstrap.\nMaybe just too big a job at the moment / not worth it ?. I've not reviewed the latest plugin load code so sorry if this is way off .. but an simple idea I've seen in php environments is to prefix folders with \"_\"   e.g. plugins prefixed like \"_Shipping.UPS\" would simply be ignored completely, this is also useful in terms of quickly removing plugins without having to move the whole folder.. Would be great to see ... with this done the app would be able to target netcoreapp20 ?   I'm thinking being able to run on linux would be awesome - it would open up more hosting options (could be cheaper ?!).. Thanks Andrei, so this would involve:\n- Switch to entity framework core.\n- Switch to identity core \n- All packages would have to target .net core (sticking point maybe) \n- Fix any other framework api issues (calls outside of .net standard - maybe there are none). @AndreiMaz thanks, the lazy loading issues, on EF Core - does that scupper the wholesale move to .net core, or is it something that will still be progressed ?  I also see that features such as grouping are missing in EF core 2.0 ... will it have to wait for 2.1 ?. @AndreiMaz thanks - wasn't suggest that you guys implement that the EF features :-).  So basically waiting on EF core 2.1. \"core\" apps - ie using the asp .net core framework or EF core can still run on the full framework or even a .net core console app could target the full framework if you want (so long as you stick to .net standard)\nSo using the ASP .Net Core framework is OK and you can still target 4.6.1.\nGiven the limitation with the EF noted above I would assume that NOP 4.0 is going to release targeting .net 4.6.1 (or similar) would be good to have that confirmed though.. So to confirm NOP 4.0 will be released targeting .net 4.6.1. Happened to notice that EF 2.1 preview is out with lazy loading/navigation included - yay!\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/02/27/announcing-entity-framework-core-2-1-preview-1/\nAppreciate there is more than just this to move to true cross-platform nop but getting there :-). I'd also like to see this (more for linux ).  I guess we are saying that Nop should target Net Standard .. guess this should be a separate issue ?. Not sure how valid a questions that is.   ASP .Net Core was implemented with  nop 4.0 - this changed the web stack and it should perform better but was still targeting the .net full framework. With 4.1 I notice that sql server Fetch / Next has been used - presumably improving performance on category pages with large product sets.    So comparing 4.0 (full) with 4.1 (core) would be apples and pears.  \nYou could try re-target 4.1 to run on full framework and compare performance, but as it now targets netcoreapp2.1 thats probably more effort than I have time for.    netcore has loads of api level performance improvements .. but how the figures in nop is going to vary a lot depending on config and data.   I would guess/hope it would make a difference.\nNot the answer you were looking for I suspect ... maybe someone will do a A/B comparison at some point..  I'd be interested to know as well.. And not sure if it helps ... but this suggests massive improvement through ASP .Net Core  . sorry  - didn't see that other issue.  I'll follow #385 . ",

No, in public store area.\nin this file \\Presentation\\Nop.Web\\Views\\Customer\\Addresses.cshtml we have no Html.AntiForegeryToken.\nBut there is a javascript method addAntiForgeryToken that is trying to fetch antiForgeryToken from the page to attach it to requestData and send the request via ajax.\nAlso in server side we have no validation attribute.\n. Yeah, sorry. You'r right. I made a mistake.\n. Following validators changed to avoid duplication when entering page sizes values:\n- CategoryValidator\n- ManufacturerValidator\n- VendorValidator\n- SettingValidator\nAlso related unit tests implemented.\n. Your welcome. Ok.\n. Done.\n. Dear @AndreiMaz;\nI made changes as you asked.\n. After reporting this issue I noticed that there is an advanced setting for this to republish product (PublishBackProductWhenCancellingOrders). But I believe it's hard to find this setting for users. So I made a pull request and put this in Catalog setting.\n. I checked it in live server. For example I uninstalled PayPalDirect plugin.\nBut its configuration page (/Admin/Payment/ConfigureMethod?systemName=Payments.PayPalDirect) redirected me to payment methods list page (/Admin/Payment/Methods).\nI also checked it for other kinds of plugins (shipping, etc). @AndreiMaz \n. I think filesystem is preferred for logs instead of RDBMS.\nFor example Web Servers like IIS, Apache, etc save their access and error logs in files instead of RDBMS by default.\nMaybe people asks How to log filesystem error if it fails?\nAnd it is quite true, but if that fails, there is more chances that your DB is inaccessible as well.\nFor putting it all together:\n1. Too many things can fail with the database, and logging this failures is important too.\n2. Also there is an extra layer between our application and the DB (ORM like EntityFramework) that it has its probability and chances of error and failure.\n3. Unless you have a database system allowing autonomous transactions (or no transactions at all), logging would require a separate connection so a rollback or commit in logging doesn\u2019t interfere with rollback or commit in the application.\n4. Many things worth logging happen during startup, i.e. possibly before the database connection has been established.\nI believe using logging frameworks like Log4net or NLog is more safe solution for logging.\n. For some payment methods its necessary to persist more than two or three value (callback result and etc). So I think keeping fields like this is not a bad idea just as a reserved field. Of course in my case I'm storing a bunch of data in JSON or XML format in AuthorizationTransactionResult.\n. @SamPlusPlus there is an other issue for this feature #1142. \n. @SamPlusPlus your welcome!\n. Anytime! @AndreiMaz \n. Yeah, that's right. It happened to me last night. It should be a problem in browscap.xml\n. I thought I reported you as abuser few days ago. Does \"Github report abuse\" really work?\n. I think it's not a good idea to add bootstrap (includes a lot of CSS, JS, Font) to change installation page design. You can do better, you can design better, and you can build your code better. Using a CSS preprocessor like Sass will allow you to still have the rapid prototyping you need, and the community tools within Sass will be your bread and butter in this regard.\n. @joe704la #215\n. @B-Esmaili I think you should build Nop.Admin project in presentation section in the solution.\n.

Wouldn't faster and better in terms of performances and resources to join them and load them all the time ?\nThis is what I am talking about:\n\n4 queries to load 4 fields on the same entity ? Seriously ? I have 334 categories/subcategories in my ecommerce.\n\nAgree, when looking at application insights, the amount of queries/hits to the DB for this application gets up to 1 million on low traffic. you don't want to see high traffic....  plus the cache default is 60 minutes, non-sliding for everything.  they all expire at the same time.  \nif these aren't fixed, someone's just going to fork a new version of nopcommerce that saves you 10x on your hosting bill.  even then, more memory and CPU only gets you so far... it's just inefficient, worse than wordpress and woocommerce.  . > Check out GrandNode\nThat's intersting but MongoDB? no thanks.   it still has non-async functions, boatload of DI into controllers....  that alone is a performance killer.   but i guess it's better than stock...... i think range would be a good idea as well that's integer/date at least.  it's come up more than once, such as year / date for cars, or wines etc...  i can implement if i have time.   . Hey,\nI will implement this,  i had started something but figure i would do it right and do a PR.   A couple things to discuss with the format.   Currently Product attributes like color, size etc... are exported in excel as grouped, under the product row.    adding another group or adding the specification attributes after this seems messy.\nI wanted to see what others thought.  However i have an idea.\nI propose to make them flat as part of the main product row.  For example:\n| specification.attributename.TypeId | specification.attributename.SelectedValue | specification.attributename.customvalue | specification.attributename..AllowFiltering |\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n0 | Purple |  | true |\n\n\nFor columns prefixed with 'specification', they would be treated as specification attributes and the attribute name would be used to look up the attribute in the system with case insensitivity.\n\n\nif the columns are blank, the attribute is skipped.  indicates the product does not have this attribute. (while other products might, so the headers and columns must be present)\n\n\nif not blank the name is used to match the attribute in the system.  if none is found, it makes one.\n\n\nif the type is an option, it uses the selected value to look up if it exists and maps to that.  if not, it creates one.  this would be case insensitive to make sure we're not making duplicates. \n\n\n. Technically, you save the file to disk and read it paged, no need to split the file regardless.  Currently it just goes into memory directly i think.   The import should be done into a separate  background process/queue.   \n. @ljesquivesgh I didn't know $149 was considered Free....  this is some basic  stuff that should be free really.  at least azure/amazon s3.   At minimum a base URL and file location could be specified then you can use some other app that maps drives from the machine to a CDN.  i use this for amazon S3 on another platform and it works fine.    Far as it knows, it thinks it's adding the image to the local file system but it syncs to S3.  then the image base URL should be the S3 bucket url.   simple enough.   not need for API implementation.. Bunch of issues with performance on this platform.   Far as i know implementing elastic search for catalog indexing of view models/languages minus any pricing logic has huge gains in performance.  The redis cache implementation is broke since they treat it as if it were in-memory instead of remote (100 of hits to the remote cache per  page-load) and no async.  Every app pool refresh or cache expire needs to reload the whole thing again, 100's of queries per page almost.  it's great example of why lazy loading is dangerous and setting things up to load items it needs up front in one query....   .

    "MaxMommersteeg": "+1 for dapper\n. I don't think we have to move off from EF entirely. For most developers it is still the easiest ORM out there. However, nopCommerce's performance could be improved at some points. Why not have a hybrid solution, using Dapper for executing critical queries and keep using EF for the others? I prefer a solution like Dapper over adding more Stored Procedures, that imho decrease understandability of nopCommerce. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt703432.aspx. Could someone inform me about the status of this PR? Having 1000+- categories in my database and the category page is very slow. Would this code be of any use? Will it be added to the original source?\n. I couldn't find any extra spaces around onclick events at _OrderDetails.Info.cshtml. Even was not able to find any other places in the whole Nop.Admin project that had extra spaces? Has this issue already been resolved?\n. I think this issue has already been resolved by https://github.com/mariannk.\nWith the following commit: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/0f7cf11690de110effa574e9c2393e600a2febc7. @DevPartner What resolution did you record this on? It looks valid when using a 1920x1080 resolution.\n\nWhen resizing the browser window it will change as image you uploaded. Not only for Edge, but Chrome too.\n. Yesterday I dealt with a similar issue. We need to sync products from one database to another (nopCommerce). At last we ended up writing a single stored procedure that does this for us. Synchronizing 20.000 products took us about 3 to 4 days (that is with optimizing EF for our needs: recreating context,  AsNoTracking enabled and AutoDetectChanges disabled). We were done in 50 seconds using the Stored Procedure. The big downside of our approach is not being able to use the safe nopCommerce services. We now need to check if our sync still runs with a new version of nop (with possibly a changing database design).\nThe main issue making our sync slow was inserting records in the nopCommerce database. A bulk insert function, a switch to Dapper (https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/239) or implementing dapper or plain queries for the heavy database actions could improve performance significantly.\n. The performance degradation is indeed massive. For now we don't mind having to write some stored procedures in order to make our synchronization processes work fast. However like you said, it is a shame we can't (because of performance) use the services like other plugins do.  Especially when looking at the future. We will need to compare database sheme's carefully, whenever we are trying to update to a new version of nopCommerce. On the other hand we can easy rewrite the plugin to work with services, when in the future (especially) insert performance improves.\nThe performance gain you achieved with 10K products is not bad at all. Will do some investigations at my end. Thanks for your reply.\n. So by default they are aligned left/start? This does solve the issue where some pictures would have padding  (whitespace in image) and some don't have padding.\n. 'our social networks' as in nopCommerce's social networks or the webshop owner's social networks?\n. What is the difference between this and impersonating the customer? Impersonating allows store owners to do the same thing am I right (only difference would be a few more clicks)?. @jlnunez89 Of course you don't have direct push access for this repository. You will need to fork the project, make changes to the forked project. When you are done, open up a Pull Request. Explain what modifications you made.\nThe nopCommerce team will label and check your Pull Request. Code will be merged into this repository when Pull Request has been approved.\n. > (it's much faster in admin area with a large number of categories than the LINQ implementation)\nWhy does this only affect the Admin area and doesn't improve performance at Shop area? Doesn't the shop make use of GetAllCategories method?. The same is happening when updating the OrderStatus from admin window (_OrderDetails.Info.cshtml & OrderController.cs).. Would using the wish list functionality be an option for those customers?. Was trying to add all individual packages earlier on but referencing Microsoft.AspNetCore.All makes this all a bit easier.. Thanks, I did not realize that. Will see if I can correct the PR in a few hours if feasible.\nEdit: Back to including all required individual packages again.. Any update on this?.

But I have never seen any tests about EF Core X Dapper or other DB framework yet.\n. @travisterrell did you do it?. We need to have more control on it, disabling or enabling a task will take effect only after a POOL refresh. We simply can\u00b4t do it on stores with a lot of visitors online.. Andrei, there is no log, but you can replicate it easly, just change the time of your server to a day when dayligh saving time starts (the day where 00:00 doesnt exists), where clocks need to be forwarded from 11:59PM to 01:00 AM. So you will see dashboard order reports empty for that day.. @AndreiMaz 3.7, but it happens since 1.9 when I started to use nop!. @AndreiMaz the method was refactored but the code was reviewed? You can use 00:00 for start date selecion where date hasnt 00:00 clock time on that specific daylight time, for example.. Yes, I can. 10/15 will start daylight saving time in Brazil. You can set your regional settings to SAO PAULO (-3) timezone and check nop dashboard report. This day, (10/15) starts at 1AM time. In windows time, it hasnt 00:00AM time, the clock jumps from 23:59:59 to 01:00:00, so when you try to get orders report from 00:00 it crashes and dont display anything.. Great! Please do it!. A lot of ecommerce systems are upgrating to allow AMP compatibility. There are pretty nice AMP stores. I see it as a new plugin, but nop could add it to the core. \nYou can take a look at ebay, for example.. @bradranks there is no such plugin yet.. Will Web Gardens be supported?. Sure, Brazil for example. Taxes are paid by the stores, not by customers, and tax is always in price value, we dont use to display tax values to customers. They see product price, for example 10us and it is the final price. Once invoice is created, store owner has to pay the tax to government. It is calculated over order total price and the tax % depends on several store parameters. So, here in Brazil we do not use to calculate tax before orders. Thats why you can set it as configurable, so here and other countries can have some performance advantage.. @ArturAlekseev do you know how many ms it makes nop faster? Can you show some performance comparison with original source code?. Tested ok... little performance improvement was added! no bugs or problems detected in my tests.. I agree with @aghe... or it is a security breach or, if by design, a design error. You can choose.\nyou should remove task route, so it cant be ran by GET requests.. @AndreiMaz that is right as it is. Once order is placed, GA plugin sends the order transaction to GA. It is not related if order is paid or not, it is always sent, so GA plugin need to cancel it everytime order is canceled, no matter if it is paid or not.. @AndreiMaz so I believe you should change it to send them all...

    "Leftyx": "My 2 cents.\nI don't think the problem in NopCommerce is EF Core vs Dapper.\nGoing through the code base and doing some tests and profiling I can see a huge number of queries running to load a page, especially the first time.\nI don't quite understand why on earth we are loading localized properties one by one for each field of a product.\nSELECT + 1 must be avoided at all costs especially in high traffic applications.\nDo we really need to cache localized properties for products ? Wouldn't faster and better in terms of performances and resources to join them and load them all the time ? \nThis is what I am talking about:\n\n4 queries to load 4 fields on the same entity ? Seriously ? I have 334 categories/subcategories in my ecommerce.. @clearbucketLabs,\nI've tried to fix some of those issues but I smashed my face against a wall.\nToo many layers to fix. Too many crazy things are going on there.\nMy biggest problems is with localized properties. We have 300K products with descriptions in 4 different languages.\nEach localized attribute for an entity is fetched an put in a cache. A product has at least 5 attributes. Loading a list of products means a few hundreds of queries, just for that.\nSame thing for categories and we have more than 300.\nThere's no chance for us to move to Azure as we would have to pay a few thousands of $$$ to run this monster.\nAt some point I was trying to remove the idiotic Repository layer and generate some real view models but it's a massive job.\nSome of those layers are not decoupled. The dependencies are crazy.\nWe are thinking of building a new e-commerce from scratch using a modern approach with a modern front-end framework like vuejs.\nLet's see.\n. I've implemented something like this in PayInStore Plugin (PayInStorePaymentProcessor.cs):\n```\n/// \n/// Returns a value indicating whether payment method should be hidden during checkout\n/// \n/// Shoping cart\n/// true - hide; false - display.\npublic bool HidePaymentMethod(IList cart)\n{\n    //you can put any logic here\n    //for example, hide this payment method if all products in the cart are downloadable\n    //or hide this payment method if current customer is from certain country\n    if (_workContext.CurrentCustomer.ShippingAddress == null)\n    {\n    return true;\n    }\nreturn false;\n\n}\n```\nafter injecting _workContext.\n@AndreiMaz: Do you think it can work or is there anything else I need to be aware of ?. @mkgn I have the same issue you're reporting.\nI have managed to track down the problem.\nThe installation process creates some settings, specifically customerSettings.HashedPasswordFormat, but that component is not resolved when creating the password for the user.\nThere's not much to do there. A fix which seems to mitigate the problem is trying to resolve the CustomerSettings before the injection in CodeFirstInstallationService.\nThis is the payload for _customerSettings I received in CustomerRegistrationService:\n{\n    \"UsernamesEnabled\": false,\n    \"CheckUsernameAvailabilityEnabled\": false,\n    \"AllowUsersToChangeUsernames\": false,\n    \"UsernameValidationEnabled\": false,\n    \"UsernameValidationUseRegex\": false,\n    \"UsernameValidationRule\": null,\n    \"DefaultPasswordFormat\": \"Clear\",\n    \"HashedPasswordFormat\": null,\n    \"PasswordMinLength\": 0,\n    \"UnduplicatedPasswordsNumber\": 0,\n    \"PasswordRecoveryLinkDaysValid\": 0,\n    \"PasswordLifetime\": 0,\n    \"FailedPasswordAllowedAttempts\": 0,\n    \"FailedPasswordLockoutMinutes\": 0,\n    \"UserRegistrationType\": \"0\",\n    \"AllowCustomersToUploadAvatars\": false,\n    \"AvatarMaximumSizeBytes\": 0,\n    \"DefaultAvatarEnabled\": false,\n    \"ShowCustomersLocation\": false,\n    \"ShowCustomersJoinDate\": false,\n    \"AllowViewingProfiles\": false,\n    \"NotifyNewCustomerRegistration\": false,\n    \"HideDownloadableProductsTab\": false,\n    \"HideBackInStockSubscriptionsTab\": false,\n    \"DownloadableProductsValidateUser\": false,\n    \"CustomerNameFormat\": \"0\",\n    \"NewsletterEnabled\": false,\n    \"NewsletterTickedByDefault\": false,\n    \"HideNewsletterBlock\": false,\n    \"NewsletterBlockAllowToUnsubscribe\": false,\n    \"OnlineCustomerMinutes\": 0,\n    \"StoreLastVisitedPage\": false,\n    \"StoreIpAddresses\": false,\n    \"SuffixDeletedCustomers\": false,\n    \"EnteringEmailTwice\": false,\n    \"RequireRegistrationForDownloadableProducts\": false,\n    \"AllowCustomersToCheckGiftCardBalance\": false,\n    \"DeleteGuestTaskOlderThanMinutes\": 0,\n    \"GenderEnabled\": false,\n    \"DateOfBirthEnabled\": false,\n    \"DateOfBirthRequired\": false,\n    \"DateOfBirthMinimumAge\": null,\n    \"CompanyEnabled\": false,\n    \"CompanyRequired\": false,\n    \"StreetAddressEnabled\": false,\n    \"StreetAddressRequired\": false,\n    \"StreetAddress2Enabled\": false,\n    \"StreetAddress2Required\": false,\n    \"ZipPostalCodeEnabled\": false,\n    \"ZipPostalCodeRequired\": false,\n    \"CityEnabled\": false,\n    \"CityRequired\": false,\n    \"CountyEnabled\": false,\n    \"CountyRequired\": false,\n    \"CountryEnabled\": false,\n    \"CountryRequired\": false,\n    \"StateProvinceEnabled\": false,\n    \"StateProvinceRequired\": false,\n    \"PhoneEnabled\": false,\n    \"PhoneRequired\": false,\n    \"FaxEnabled\": false,\n    \"FaxRequired\": false,\n    \"AcceptPrivacyPolicyEnabled\": false,\n    \"$type\": \"CustomerSettings\"\n}\nAs you can see it is all empty.. > \n\nthe issue is that it timed out\n\nIt is not. @AndreiMaz  Maybe a little bit more investigation would help. Plus a proper logger (IE: Serilog) would have to track down issues.\n. @AndreiMaz I don't think the problem is Entity Framework.\nI've added Serilog to my implementation cause the errors/exceptions management is poor.\nI've also added some traces and the problem sits in CustomerRegistrationService.ChangePasswordResult.\nThis bit of code:\ncase PasswordFormat.Hashed:\n    var saltKey = _encryptionService.CreateSaltKey(NopCustomerServiceDefaults.PasswordSaltKeySize);\n    customerPassword.PasswordSalt = saltKey;\n    customerPassword.Password = _encryptionService.CreatePasswordHash(request.NewPassword, saltKey, _customerSettings.HashedPasswordFormat);\nuses and injected setting: _customerSettings.HashedPasswordFormat\nwhich is not resolved when pre-populating some data.\nIt happens randomly.\nIt's an issue.\nThis is the stack-trace:\n\nSystem.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.\nParameter name: hashAlgorithm\n   at Nop.Services.Security.EncryptionService.CreateHash(Byte[] data, String hashAlgorithm) in E:\\Development\\xxxxxx\\src\\Libraries\\Nop.Services\\Security\\EncryptionService.cs:line 103\n   at Nop.Services.Security.EncryptionService.CreatePasswordHash(String password, String saltkey, String passwordFormat) in E:\\Development\\xxxxxx\\src\\Libraries\\Nop.Services\\Security\\EncryptionService.cs:line 91\n   at Nop.Services.Customers.CustomerRegistrationService.ChangePassword(ChangePasswordRequest request) in E:\\Development\\xxxxxx\\src\\Libraries\\Nop.Services\\Customers\\CustomerRegistrationService.cs:line 358\n   at Nop.Services.Installation.CodeFirstInstallationService.InstallCustomersAndUsers(InstallationOptions options) in E:\\Development\\xxxxxx\\src\\Libraries\\Nop.Services\\Installation\\CodeFirstInstallationService.cs:line 4109\n   at Nop.Services.Installation.CodeFirstInstallationService.InstallData(InstallationOptions options) in E:\\Development\\xxxxxx\\src\\Libraries\\Nop.Services\\Installation\\CodeFirstInstallationService.cs:line 12038\n   at Nop.Web.Controllers.InstallController.Index(InstallModel model) in E:\\Development\\xxxxxx\\src\\Presentation\\Nop.Web\\Controllers\\InstallController.cs:line 407\n\n. One simple fix which seems to make things work is try to resolve CustomerSettingsbefore changing password:\nvar customerSettings = EngineContext.Current.Resolve<CustomerSettings>();\nat this line:\nCodeFirstInstallationService.cs. @brakim I have the same problem with categories and manufacturers.\nWhen I first load the home page I can see 600 queries running. I have never seen anything like that before ... but that's the way it is.\nIf you have localized properties it would run one query for each localized field.\nOne easy fix to reduce the amount of queries would be to comment some of the properties you are not interested to be localized:\n```\n.Select(category =>\n{\n    var catModel = new CategoryModel\n    {\n    Id = category.Id,\n    Name = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.Name),\n    Description = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.Description),\n    //MetaKeywords = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.MetaKeywords),\n    //MetaDescription = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.MetaDescription),\n    //MetaTitle = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.MetaTitle),\n    SeName = _urlRecordService.GetSeName(category),\n    };\n...\n\n})\n.ToList();\n``\nThere's not real view model in NopCommerce. Most of the entities are fully loaded and related entities are fetch one by one (SELECT + 1).\nI've tried to fix some of these bits but at some point I banged my head against a wall.\nThere are too many useless layers. They've used a repository patter with Entity Framework which is already a repository.\nQueries are in this Factory layer when they should be sitting in the service layer.\nAt the moment I've asked my client to add RAM and processors but at some point I might need to look somewhere else.. I've sort of managed to alleviate some of the problems with memory and restarts.\nFollowing some advice I've found in the forum I've switched the Application Pool to run 32bit: Switch on:Enable 32bit applications`\nI've changed the the configuration in Nop.Web.runtimeconfig.json:\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"tfm\": \"netcoreapp2.1\",\n    \"framework\": {\n      \"name\": \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\",\n      \"version\": \"2.1.0\"\n    },\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"System.GC.Concurrent\": false,\n      \"System.GC.Server\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\ndisabling the garbage collection.\nand I've changed the configuration in web.config running dotnet 32bit:\n<aspNetCore requestTimeout=\"23:00:00\" processPath=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\dotnet.exe\" arguments=\".\\Nop.Web.dll\" forwardWindowsAuthToken=\"false\" stdoutLogEnabled=\"false\" stdoutLogFile=\".\\logs\\stdout\" startupTimeLimit=\"3600\" />\nNotice: processPath=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\dotnet.exe\"\nNow the average memory usage has gone done to 300Mb. \nI still see those spikes in CPU usage when requesting a new page but that is related  to some poorly written queries to load localized properties and resources causing a SELECT + 1.. @skoshelev, I made some changes to my repository some time ago and submitted a PR with the changes.\nI had worked with similar problems in the past and you will find some changes which you might want to consider.\nIt's working fine in production.. @dborovsky: What I have done in my fork is to create in NopEngine.ConfigureServices a named HttpClient:\nservices.AddHttpClient(\"named-client\", c =>\n{\n    c.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"client-base-address\");\n    // c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(\"User-Agent\", \"user-agent\");\n    c.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);\n});\nso that we could have different specialized client for a different url/service and inject IHttpClientFactory.\nThe client can be resolved using its name:\nvar httpClient = this.HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(\"named-client\");\nand it does not need to be disposed. Another options is to create specialized clients but that would make things a bit more complicated.\n. @astrumcs I had opened an issue  for the same problems.\nThere's a fix to mitigate problems with RAM usage. Just run the app pool at 32bit and implement a couple of changes to the config files.\nQueries will be slow still. \nThere a few issues with localizations. Every time and entity or a set of entity is loaded the repository layer loads a localized property for each field.\nFor categories, manufactures and products that means running at least 6 queries for each entity.\nAt some point those info are cached but still.\nI guess it's crazy but there's not much we can do about it.. @clearbucketLabs yep. This code base is poorly written and lots of implementation don't consider performance and resources management at all.\nI have had exposure to Azure and on that platform resources (queries, memory and CPU) are really expensive.\nI am working on a fork now and trying to optimize the product a bit. It's not easy.\nDo you have any code to share for the Elastic Search integration ?\n. @AndreiMaz The biggest offender in my implementation is the use of the caching system.\nWe have 340 categories and doing something like this:\n_categoryService.GetAllCategoriesDisplayedOnHomePage()\n    .Select(category =>\n    {\n        var catModel = new CategoryModel\n        {\n        Id = category.Id,\n        Name = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.Name),\n        Description = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.Description),\n        MetaKeywords = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.MetaKeywords),\n        MetaDescription = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.MetaDescription),\n        MetaTitle = _localizationService.GetLocalized(category, x => x.MetaTitle),\n        SeName = _urlRecordService.GetSeName(category),\n        };\n    })\n    .ToList()\nis not efficient.\nThose are 6 extra queries for each category.  This pattern is used for pretty much everything but mostly for categories, products and manufacturers.\nI have used MiniProfiler to profiles some of these queries and I can see we are running hundreds of queries to load a page.\nBrowsing through the e-commerce is painful as well as most of the entities are not yet cached.\nWe cannot use LoadAllLocalizedPropertiesOnStartup as we have 200K products ... and growing.\nTo fix some of these issues I had to comment MetaKeywords, MetaDescription and MetaTitle as we don't used them. This little trick saves me a few seconds.\nShouldn't we load all those properties for an entity instead of each field ? Best would be to load them for multiple entities, maybe using an attribute for the field to identify those localized properties.\n. > \n\n@Leftyx Could you please clarufy when you set IgnoreStartupTasks to false?\n\n@AndreiMaz: Removing IIgnoreStartupTasks fixes the problem. Thanks.. Microsoft.AspNetCore.All is deprecated.\nAnd this is another link helpful explanation.. Wouldn't it be easier to change the mapping ?\nCreateMap<ShoppingCartItem, ShoppingCartItemModel>()\n    .ForMember(model => model.Store, options => options.Ignore())\n    .ForMember(model => model.AttributeInfo, options => options.Ignore())\n    .ForMember(model => model.UnitPrice, options => options.Ignore())\n    .ForMember(model => model.UpdatedOn, options => options.Ignore())\n    .ForMember(model => model.ProductName, options => options.MapFrom(x => x.Product != null ? x.Product.Name : string.Empty))\n    .ForMember(model => model.Total, options => options.Ignore());\nThat's what Automapper is meant to do..

    "zootie": "Probably, the simplest and most elegant implementation is by using the Order table, as the OP points out. IMO, rather than using an IsQuote column, use OrderStatusId, as a Pre-Order status, or (better yet) add an OrderTypeId column, akin to Product Templates (so nopC would filter/deal only with OrderTypeId in (Order, SavedCart, etc.), allow plugins and end users to define different OrderTypeIds to suit their needs). Same idea could be used to implement multiple saved shopping carts (just add a column to name them). Semantically similar/identical to a Pending or Canceled order. \nThis avoids duplicating Order functionality in other entities, and could use the same ID namespace (so users can refer to them by ID before and after it is approved to become an order). It could be up to the shop on how to activate a quote (either by changing its type, or by cloning it with an order status).\nOnly new useful functionality to implement would be to having an UI (or just a method/SP) to copy an order (ie, do a deep copy of all elements related to an order), to allow to copy a quote (or a cart), which is a common requirement when doing quotes (being able to create multiple similar quotes from the same base products). It would also be useful to have a compare side by side feature.\nQuote expiration could be implemented also as a status, semantically identical to a canceled order. Or if using OrderTypeId, just set it to canceled.. Nearly every entity that has a Name should have a way to refer to it programmaticaly. \nJust came across PO Numbers being stored in localized XML keys?! Why is this such a difficult concept for nopC? Why oversimplifiying everything around a single, user changeable name that makes customization a nightmare?\n. ",

But I am unware of a way to set an object as readonly..\n. I agree :+1: \n. Just my 50 cents. I've found that loading ... in head is what makes the most difference. (Difference between 80's range and 90's range). This is of course something that is done in views. But would be cool with some kind of \"engine\" that can do it for you. IISSpeed does this for you for instance.. I wrote it myself (for inspiration), I use it my theme... :\npublic static MvcHtmlString GetTopicTitle(this HtmlHelper html, string systemName)\n        {\n            var workContext = EngineContext.Current.Resolve();\n            var storeContext = EngineContext.Current.Resolve();\n```\n        //static cache manager\n        var cacheManager = EngineContext.Current.ContainerManager.Resolve(\"nop_cache_static\");\n        var cacheKey = string.Format(ModelCacheEventConsumerPostMe.TOPIC_TITLE_BY_SYSTEMNAME, systemName, workContext.WorkingLanguage.Id, storeContext.CurrentStore.Id);\n        var cachedSeName = cacheManager.Get(cacheKey, () =>\n        {\n            var topicService = EngineContext.Current.Resolve();\n            var topic = topicService.GetTopicBySystemName(systemName, storeContext.CurrentStore.Id);\n            if (topic == null)\n                return \"\";\n        return topic.GetLocalized(x => x.Title, workContext.WorkingLanguage.Id);\n\n    });\n    return MvcHtmlString.Create(cachedSeName);\n}\n\n```\n. @MaxMommersteeg : Just tuning in. You mention \"recreating context\". If you really did this per. 100 product there should not be a serious issue using EF. So my guess is that you forgot about events. We had a solr plugin that consumed most of our resources. I believe that nop's buildin REDIS cache must be similar (did not check though)..\n. I disagree with this. At least it should be manual (or very old ones). Reason being that google images also counts as SEO. So at least we are from a store perspective not interested in deleting images.\nI don't mind the function. But the task should be default off. And it's still a good idea to clean \"bloat\" from database.. just don't delete the filesystem ones...\n. An advanced (and cool feature) would be is a plugin that catch the \"jpg\" request and maybe serve a \"This picture is depreciated, please visit xxx instead\" default image would be nice. \nI have played around with this in the past. But the performance hit on IIS is severe because the mime type have to be treated as dynamic content and thus not cached static by iis.\n. BTW: its only when filtering by store. The order is fine when no filter is applied....\n. @AndreiMaz . Sure, it seems that it is a store mapping issue. My store \"PostMe\" is correct - this is because it has all categories added in \"limit to store\".\nSortorder is 0. I never changed that... \nSo here is two screenshot (I added which of my stores it's mapped to)\nmain store is called PostMe:\n\nThis store is called PostMeDentalSweden:\n\nThe store \"PostMe\" is the only one mapped to \"Dental Care\". PostMeDentalSweden is mapped to all below \"Dental Care\"\n. I think it's a minor bug. Most people will probably make seperate category tree for each store...\n. That is set to False. Agree :) . That does pose a problem. I agree that you should make sure it's compatible.\nI think you should make a new method without optionals:\nGetThisPageUrl(bool includeQueryString, bool useSsl, bool ignoreCasing)\nThe existing methods:\nGetThisPageUrl(bool includeQueryString)\nGetThisPageUrl(bool includeQueryString, bool useSsl)\nShould all call the GetThisPageUrl(bool includeQueryString, bool useSsl, bool ignoreCasing) method\nI don't see any possibility of this conflicting.... Yeah. Sounds like the correct solution :). ",

If the form submitted for a new customer address fails validation, ModelState.IsValid could be set from the plugin by consuming these events, instead of having to use mvc ActionFilters or overriding a default controller action..

Same error as #3146\nBut i get this one even with Keep alive task disabled.\nIn my case any error that happens in a scheduled task generates this dbContext exception.\nFrom what I can see, it's related with error logging on scheduled tasks.\n. Andrei, I made same tests. \nI set to null every datetime in the ScheduledTask table, re-enabled keep alive job only (with interval set to 30sec) and re-cycled the app pool.\nNow I don't receive any error at startup, application works.\nTwo weird things happens:\n\nlooking at my database table ScheduledTask the LastStartDateUtc is still null. \nlooking at Logs table I CAN SEE task's \"No such host is known No such host is known\" exception, exactly one every 30sec as I set in the db. So the task it's running.. .\n\nSo maybe there's a problem with scheduleTaskService update and the following error logging?\nHope it helps you.\nAh, as I said, only on the staging server.\nI can't reproduce this problem on my development machine where scheduled tasks and logs work as expected.\n. I set an invalid url to test the whole thing. With a valid URL, obviously, there's no logging so i have no way to check if the task is running or not. Same problem here.

Initially, he listed to the problems and tried helping around, but then he said, he can't fix the problems as he doesn't have enough time to spare for the plugin.\nAndrei - I would ask you to bring the functionality out of the box for nopcommerce 3.90. This would benefit the community and also the users doesn't have to depend on any third party plugin providers  as there is a risk that the third party plugin may be discontinued at the developers will.

I had this error too:\nhttps://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3162. Hi, I see Issue# 3144 was closed and referenced to this issue. Just wondering, is this issue implying that support for Linux is not currently available and on the roadmap? I need to make production decisions for the servers to support the business timelines today. If Linux is not currently supported, does anyone know when they expect to support it? Thanks to anyone who may know.. Received a comment stating Linux support is coming in v4.2\n. +1 for an official docker version in GitHub.\n+2 with instructions for nginx docker pre-configured for nopCommerce. Is this related?

OK, this was my first time deploying a .NET Core app to Linux and figured it out. The issue was how I was publishing the project. Instead of just clicking the green button at the top to do a release build, I had to do an actual publish. \nTo publish, I created a new directory on my developer laptop and published to it. This placed all dependency files needed. Then FTP those files over to my Linux server. Hope this helps others.\n. I had this error too:\nhttps://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/3162.

I think I am making some silly mistake during build and perhaps I do nto need to change any code to make the MapPath Separator work.\nCan someone who has successfully built on Linux provide that secret TIP ?\n\nI was created a branch named linux before but I totally forgot it. Sorry about that. Now, I merged the linux branch to master. Lets pull the master branch again. Now, you will be able to run on linux.. I successfully installed again on my local macos machine. Have you tried with clean start? I mean no database and empty DataConnectionString field at Presentation/Nop.Web/App_Data/dataSettings.json?\nThe issue probably about updating customer password after installation when you haven't yet the setting customersettings.hashedpasswordformat on db.\nAlso, have you tried just my fork of nopCommerce or merge something else in it?. I am using 2.2.101 sdk.\nNeed more information.\n- What OS you are using.\n- MySQL version.. @ekuiperemr There is no hard coded db name of nopdata but I don't understand why it use that the name of database.. @soci1248 \n1. To manage the memory caching by single point and be able to make changes at root level if required. Also it manage the clearing cache keys by pattern and abstract the usage to simplify that.\n2. _allKeys dic is responsible for the deleting cache object by regex pattern somthing like starts with given key.. > Based on a preliminary analysis I see the following problems.\n\nWhen there are many items in the cache RegisterPostEvictionCallback calls back the PostEviction method very frequently. Consider 100000 items, all expiring in 1 hour, and they creation are evenly distributed within an hour. Then every 3600 sec / 100000=0.036 second you got a callback in this method. This is 27 call per second. The real situation is much worse, because the cache additions are not evenly distributed at all in time.\nWhat does PostEviction do? It calls ClearKeys, which iterates thru _allKeys using a linear search (Where). For 100000 items this needs considerable time and CPU. This is the reason a production server is experiencing slowdown during a day. I used procdump to create a memory dump when the CPU for the worker process is more than 90% for 30 seconds. What did I see in the dump? 14 of the 30 threads were executing ClearKeys! Because it is a tight CPU loop, it sucks all CPUs to the ground.\nWhy do you call ClearKeys for when an item is removed from the cache? Why bother checking other items during the callback of a particular item? Why not call ClearKeys on a timer thread for every 10 seconds or so?\nThe next one, this actually also causes serious CPU burning is the IsCrawler method. It creates 5000 regex object for each call, and evaluates all of them if the user agent string is not a search engine. If you simply create and store the Regex object instead of string during the initialization the performance doubles at least. If you concat the pieces by (regex1)|(regex2), etc. manner to create one, big regex, the performance becomes even better.\nWhy I mention this method too? After a day of profiling I can claim that 75% of the CPU is eaten by ClearKeys and IsCrawler!!!\nOne other problem which does not bother me at this moment because I don't see it in the profiler and the memory dumps, but can cause pain in the back later: RemoveByPattern.\nThis is problematic, the code creates a compiled regex for each call! Compiled regex without caching the regex objects?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/513412/how-does-regexoptions-compiled-work\n\nThat is what I exactly say.:) But no one from the nop team, discuss the issue, until someone facing to this. . @antalistvan The better way is just calling the ClearKeys method by given time period. For example, use a timer that ticks every 10 seconds.\nSomething like that:\nvar timer = new Timer(state => {ClearKeys();}, null, WAIT_TIME_TO_START, 10);. It will not burn your cpu if you have lower than ~1 million cache key. The issue not about calling the ClearKeys. It is about calling this method too many times for a second. Actually, ClearKeys method is not must. Ignoring this method is another solution I think. . ",

It turns out it may have nothing to do with versioning, but it would be nice if Nop told me I had incorrect plugin versions earlier, instead of an empty list of plugins.\nI am running the site using visual studio running from IIS Express.  When I install a plugin, it goes through the motions of installation, but it never actually loads.  The Install and delete still appear and none of the Plugin screens are available.  The file containing the list of installed plugins is updated but none of the functionality of the plugins are loaded.  Clearing the cache and restarting the application has no effect.  \nI discovered that I can get the plugins to load by restarting the IIS Express process.  Stopping the debugger from Visual Studio doesn't kill it as it continues to live on.  I suspect the problem has to do with caching.  I noticed NopCommerce loads the plugins in memory.  Without knowing the details, perhaps .NET core is a bit more aggressive with its caching.  Perhaps there's a something going on between Kestrel and IIS?\n. >\n\n.... actually this warning is displayed in admin area > system > warnings\n\nYes, I'm sure it does, but to someone who just installed it, wouldn't it be far more informative if instead of displaying a blank plugins list,  it listed them like this:\nFedex Plugin        Error, incompatible plugin version [delete]\nUps Plugin            Error, Incompatible plugin version [delete]\nUSPS Plugin         Error, Incompatible plugin version [delete]\nThe warnings can be easily overlooked because they are often ignored for a variety of reasons, including the user thinking that an incompatible plugin should be an error instead of a warning.

I will keep an eye out on it as I am working with NopCommerce.  I will try to put a breakpoint where the plugin manager detects the plugin's version and see what may cause it.. Following up from Stackoverflow.  He claimed he has a working build on MacOS. Not sure if this was the only modification, but it's the firsr error encountered after running the build.  I can try a do a build on my Mac with this change and do some light user testing.  If it works, it is worthy of an experimental branch. At the very least, you can get some feedback and pull requests on any issues.  It could make your job a lot easier. \nA ton of developers want to do their development on a Mac and even more want to deploy it on Unix Oses.  Right now, I am having a terrible time influencing my clients to use NopCommerce because they don't want to be tied down to Windows hosting.

I have at least four other NopCommerce installation running versions 2.7 to 3.0 with no memory issues. \nI am not pointing to NopCommerce at fault, but since it is using dotnet core and it's a known issue, it's reasonable to see if there's any workarounds or solutions to this problem.  \nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCoreModule/issues/51\n. The problem apparently went away when I made a small change to my runtime.json file. The same option exists for web.config.  According to the AspNetCoreModule forum, the gcServer = true only works on post Windows 7/2008 operating systems.  When I switched it to false, the memory leaks appeared to resolve itself:\nMSDN gcServer attribute\nStill, the amount of RAM it's taking 200-300MB for you and ~500MB for me is pretty high. I wonder if the ram consumption is due to IIS rather than .NetCore.  I am not sure how and if it's a good idea to run it using Kestrel alone, since IIS has a lot of features and security provisions.\n. @toddca  LOL!  That was more like having the football yanked just before the punt and landing on your arse in a violent manner,. I am having the same issue as well.  It happens locally on my machine, but not on my live server.  It also happens with the Prisma theme from NopTemplates, but not the default theme. The problem is occuring in the following code:\n                    _processor.Process(configFilePath, new List<Bundle> { bundle });\n\nThe BundleFileProcessor.Process method creates a bundle of all the CSS files and then applies the minimization which generates the file with .min.css.  I suspect there's something about the file that is causing minimize to fail. It might be a size issue as NopTemplates theme is very large and has images encoded as text.. ",

There is no error. Country field is displayed twice.. The reason I opened this, we were using bitdefender  on one of our servers and somehow it blocked nopcommerce response and cause break in the application.. yes it is custom code from plugin.. I saw on forum as well, but seems like Nopcommerce Team cannot spare as much as time they used to on forum. That is why i put it here.. it was cache :).

    "kwerty": "This was an issue I submitted\nhttps://nopcommerce.codeplex.com/workitem/12134\nIf no_shipping is set to 1 then the payment will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection. However, PayPal Seller Protection is not available in many countries, so it would still be good to have an option to configure no_shipping in the PayPal Standard configuration page.\nThere is no point in asking my customers for a shipping address since they have already entered it on the Shipping address page, and since requiring an address to be entered into PayPal provides no additional benefit.\nI propose the following option text -\n- [ ] Require user to specify shipping address during PayPal checkout (Warning: Payments without shipping address not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection)\n. Hi Andrei\nIt is currently set to True, I've just gone and checked it. See log below -\n\nAnyway as you can see in the order notes the order was marked as Paid after the IPN. It's the IPN that has marked the order as paid - and the IPN does no such validation on the order amount.\nAnd if they managed to do it to my NopCommerce installation, then they will be doing it to others. If you close this issue I am positive there will be others reporting the same thing in due time.\n. I am sure it is unmodified.\nAnd if you look at the order notes it seems the order was not marked as paid until the IPN came in. I think this is a problem with the IPN not the PDT.\n. Looks good to me. I've now deployed your fix to production, if you don't hear back from me then it all went well. Thanks Andrei.\n. It validates the total, yes, but not the currency. Not a major, but if the hacker changed the currency they could potentially pay less.. With all due respect Andrei, I don't think you quite understand what I'm saying. I know about the override checkbox, this issue has nothing to with that. Simply selecting a store and clicking save will completely wipe the \"all stores\" settings back to the defaults. Follow the steps I've outlined, you will see.. Every time I update a general setting for a specific store, the settings for \"all stores\" are lost, so I have to go back to re set the settings for \"all stores\". It's a bit of a pain having to deal with the bug, but at least I know the steps to work around it. Newbies won't know about this and will no doubt be confused as to why their all store settings keep getting cleared.\nBy the way, I love your work. I've just recently launched a second store, NopCommerce really shines in this area.. This bug results in websites regularly going down until the IIS app pool is manually recycled. This is a serious problem, do you not think this warrants a hotfix or version 4.0.1 ? NopCommerce 4.0 was released over 7 months ago, and numerous people have come to your forums to complain about it. How can NopCommerce be considered production ready software with such a horrendous problem left unfixed for 7 months? This reflects very poorly on your team. Honestly it boggles the mind that you guys think this is acceptable..

    "kingmotley": "Or use <input type=\"date\" and only attach datepicker on to those few browsers that have yet to support the date type (old IE).. Why do this?  They are basically the same (for all versions of .NET >= 2.0), and string.Empty isn't nearly as readable.. \n\nThe picture binary blob should be moved to it's own table to keep EF from loading a potentially large amount of data from the server to the client (webserver) when it isn't required.  The web pages should only need to know the metadata of the picture (Id,SeoFileName,AltAttribute,TitleAttribute), not the size or contents of the binary blob, so why put it in the same table which will make it always be loaded and sent to the client (webserver) whenever you want to get the picture metadata (which you need when generating the img tag)?  Bad design.. The qty field in the cart should be <input type=\"number\" min=\"0\" not <input type=\"text\", then most browsers will display the spin buttons automatically (which can be removed via CSS if you don't like them).  It will also cause the correct onscreen keyboard to show up on mobiles, and also disallow entering letters into the box.\nJust don't forget to add default styles to input[type=number] because whoever did the default stylesheets didn't have one (WHY?).. If the html tag had the appropriate lang attribute set (best practices anyway), then you would be able to easily have different styles per language.\nEx: <html lang=\"en-us\"><h1>English\nvs\n<html lang=\"ru\"><h1>Russian\nThen using your stylesheet:\nh1:lang(en) { color: green; } // All H1's in English are green\nh1:lang(ru) { color: red; } // All h1's in Russian are red\nThis would also allow you to have nested languages, such as a normally Russian page having an English quote in it like this:\n<html lang=\"ru\"><h1>This is in Russian</h1><h1 lang=\"en\">This is in English</h1>. You could try putting this in your robots.txt file (although not all bots respect it, it's easy to test):\nUser-agent: *\nCrawl-delay: 10\nWhich tells any bot who asks, to please not hit more than 1 page every 10 seconds.. From past experience, I can tell you that storing images in the database and using imageResizer appropriately to auto-generate thumbnails when configured correctly has no scaling issues.  That means that images are never updated, only replaced (never reuse the same image id), and set the cache to a far future date (+10 years?).  Allow imageresizer to use it's own internal caching as well (resized images get a \"temporary\" cached copy on the webserver).\nUsing the above, we had one site handling 10,000 concurrent users on a single webserver with a hundred or so images on some pages.. Sorry, that site wasn't actually running nop, just using imageresizer.  That version also isn't currently in production, as it was recently replaced, but it was running for years with GREAT performance (all pages render in less than 2 seconds, most sub-second - quick test shows ~700ms on a page with 24 images first hit ~500ms on sebsequent which includes the request of the page rendering, and image downloading to the client).  It was an ASP.NET MVC web application running on a physical webserver, remotely accessing most images from an Azure database through imageresizer.  Development/QA/UAT of that code was run as an Azure Website with similar performance.\nIt was using the following plug-ins: a custom SqlReader plug-in, the DiskCache plug-in, the virtual folder plug-in, the Default Settings plug-in, and the Client Cache plug-in.\nSorry for the confusion.. Yes, that is a problem with the SqlReader as well.  That's why I wrote a custom implementation for it that reduced the number of Exists() calls and we removed the calls checking to see the last update DateTime (since we never allow images to be updated those calls were unnecessary).\nI'm sure if you contacted the author of ImageResizer he could make the modifications for you that would be similar to the ones we made.  For sources that aren't local (remote databases and cloud storage) the performance difference is pretty large.  Or maybe the latest versions already do this, I'm not sure, we used an older version of the engine before the licensing changed.. Glad to hear it.  I'm not sure why that isn't a default option, but the performance difference as you can see is well worth it.  As for the poor compression of ImageResizer, last I heard someone was working on a plug in that would async behind the scenes build a better thumbnail (with throttling).  So you would get the benefit of a really fast first result, and subsequent results would be a better compressed version.  Not sure what the status of that is today.. ",

    "mfalkao": "My I suggest a slightly different implementation.\nInstead of using the suggested RoundingType it would be sufficient to state the precision as decimal (like 0.01, 0.05, 0.5) and a rounding type that states midpoint rounding (to even, AwayFromZero).\nRounding could then be implemented as:\nv: the value to round\np: precision as decimal\nm: midpoint rounding\nq = Math.Truncate(v/p);\nr = Math.Round(v/p - q, m);\nresult = (q + r) * p;\nFurthermore, I would suggest to have two rounding settings per currency. One for Price and one for Amount. Additionally, there might be the need to have a separate rounding scheme for order total only.\n. I've added tax calculation for associated products. With this you can sell sets having products with different tax rate. \nMay I suggest to define the next steps.\nFirst of all a code review is needed. The pull request is a concept proposal to show how tax calculation could be implemented.\nExample where the actual implementation fails. Prices incl. tax and setting shoppingcartsettings.roundpricesduringcalculation = true\nwith 10% Subtotal discount.\nVersion 3.8\nItem1 = 7.99 and 10% tax\nItem2 = 7.95 and 20% tax\nResult: Subtotal 15.94, discount 1.59, tax 1.84 -> total 14.34. Should be 14.35.\nReason is a rounding error when calculating discount.\nNew\nResult: Subtotal 15.94, discount 1.59, tax 1.84 -> total 14.35\nTo go further on we need to decide several issues:\n1) Do we need the fields Incl/Excl in order? We could limit everything to what the order is intended for. For instance, orders with CustomerTaxDisplayTypeId = DisplayTax would have respective fields with tax, otherwise fields are without.\nIf we decide to keep them, then OrderDiscount should also have both fields (OrderDiscountInclTax and OrderDiscountExclTax) as it involves now tax calculation. Furthermore, in this case we should make CustomerTaxDisplayTypeId modifiable after the order has been posted, to allow printing invoices with different tax setup. This would be the case when a customer had the wrong setting.\n2) Should we add a tax-code to tax setup? Do we have the need to show tax texts per taxrate and tax exemption?\n3) Reward points. Should they reduce tax?\n4) Configurable tax and amount rounding?\n. ",

If you add / to the end it allows sitename.com/cart but blocks sitename.com/cart/someaction.\nSo you should better add allow rules for the other urls.\nA solution may be to add all active url slugs to robots.txt under allow section.\n.

So i diffed our 3.8 version with the 3.9 version and found the reason for this stack overflow.\n3.9 Version \"Administration/Views/Product/_CreateOrUpdate.Info.cshtml\" has a </td> at line 1517 which does not exist in the 3.8 version.\nIf i add the </td>  to our 3.8 version the stack overflow no longer occurs.\nSeems like you can close this issue as you already fixed it within #2036\n. And how do you handle permissions here?\nLet's say user with role XY has no access to products, but can edit views in admin area. How to prevent him using EngineContext to get product service or even product repository and doing bad things?\nThis could and would be a huge security issue!. Well then the problem still exists.\nWhat if a administrator (root user) has restricted access to some parts of nopcommerce?\nYou aren't forced to give the administrator role all rights.\nSure in this case it would be better to create a new role with restricted access.. You already have a list of images on the product edit page where you can add, edit and remove them. So what's the advantage of this?. Extend it so we can link products, manufacturer and categories. Depends on what you want. develop = nop 4.0 (work in progress)\nIf you want to work on 3.9 you have to use release-3.90-bug-fixes. Just check PluginManager.cs, PluginFinder.cs and all other files in src/Libraries/Nop.Core/Plugins... Back 3.9 the only relevant thing was under runtime -> assemblybinding -> probing\nBest is you analyse the code and learn how it works.. For nopCommerce default theme a 'read more' button will be sufficient. I don't see why there should be a pagination.\nAnd if you're not using the default theme,  implement it yourself.. Additionally i didn't need to login to upload a file, maybe this should be fixed too\nMy Settings\n\nSimple Postman Request\n\n. You should consider calculate stock quantity using Product.ManageInventoryMethodId and Product.UseMultipleWarehouses instead of just Product.StockQuantity.\nSee calculation in ProductExtensions.cs. Maybe try to refactor inline scripts into dedicated script files?\nI think of something like bootstrap does it.\nInstead of inline script you could use data-attributes and initialize handlers in that dedicated JS file which will be loaded after jQuery.\nTake this as a sample of what i mean\n_CreateOrUpdateAddress\n<select asp-for=\"CountryId\" asp-items=\"Model.AvailableCountries\" \n                    data-trigger=\"country-select\" \n                    data-url=\"@(Url.RouteUrl(\"GetStatesByCountryId\"))\" \n                    data-stateprovince=\"#@Html.IdFor(model => model.StateProvinceId)\" \n                    data-loading=\"#states-loading-progress\"></select>\npublic.countryselect.js\n```\n+function ($) {\n    'use strict';\nif ('undefined' == typeof (jQuery)) {\n    throw new Error('jQuery JS required');\n}\n\nif ($(document).has('[data-trigger=\"country-select\"]')) {\n\n    $('select[data-trigger=\"country-select\"]').change(function() {\n        var $this = $(this);\n        var selectedItem = $this.val();\n        var ddlStates = $($this.data('stateprovince'));\n        var statesProgress = $($this.data('loading'));\n        statesProgress.show();\n        $.ajax({\n            cache: false,\n            type: 'GET',\n            url: $this.data('url'),\n            data: { 'countryId': selectedItem, 'addSelectStateItem': \"true\" },\n            success: function(data) {\n                ddlStates.html('');\n                $.each(data,\n                    function(id, option) {\n                        ddlStates.append($('<option></option>').val(option.id).html(option.name));\n                    });\n                statesProgress.hide();\n            },\n            error: function(xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {\n                alert('Failed to retrieve states.');\n                statesProgress.hide();\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n}(jQuery);\n```\n_Root.Head\nHtml.AppendScriptParts(ResourceLocation.Foot, \"~/js/public.countryselect.js\");. The code above is 'reusable'. So you can replace the inline script within register page with data-attributes as well ;-)\nIf this code fits for you i could create a pull request later with the above changes.. Pull-Request #2648. For me it does work or i don't get what you meant\n\nAre you sure your browser cache doesn't produced this?\nSince i changed some parts in OPC java script.\nEdit: Used browser is Chrome Version 63.0.3239.84 (Official Build) (64-bit). Check this #2448, maybe they won't use object initializer since they finished their main code polishing. Although i prefer object initializer vs assignment statements too.\n. The above code makes nop vulnerable to SQL injection.\nI don't see any reason to expose IQueryable up to UI layer.\nIf you for some reason require more filters than default provides, extend (override) default services.. > Using IQueryable in my code boost my performance in my last .Net adventure (tested with miniprofiler & glimpse)\nnopCommerce uses IQueryable (Table property from IRepository) in their service layer. \nIf you need more filters or paged results, just override services to accept filters/commands you require. But exposing IQueryable up to UI is never a good idea, even if you \"trust\" controllers.. > Also the stack trace above does not show up in the nop error log. Do you know why this specific stack trace is not getting logged?\nMaybe because it's inside of PluginManager.Initialize() which is being called by NopEngine.Initialize().\nThus i think dependencies are not yet ready.\n. I think this is an issue with your web server.\nWe are running a site with more than 1.7 millions pictures (700+ GB). Our base images have a dimension of around 4196 x 5595. \nThe only issue we are facing is the memory usage to resize such a large picture. \nSure there is room for improvements regarding the default picture service, but using an additional table will either blow up database or your memory cache.\nEdit: We only made minor improvements like this\n```\nprivate static IEnumerable GetFiles(string path, string pattern)\n{\n    var pending = new Queue();\n    pending.Enqueue(path);\nstring[] paths;\nwhile (pending.Count > 0)\n{\n    path = pending.Dequeue();\n\n    try\n    {\n        paths = Directory.GetFiles(path, pattern);\n    }\n    catch (UnauthorizedAccessException)\n    {\n        continue;\n    }\n\n    foreach (var file in paths)\n    {\n        yield return file;\n    }\n\n    paths = Directory.GetDirectories(path);\n    foreach (var directory in paths)\n    {\n        pending.Enqueue(directory);\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```. GetLocalized and GetSeName use a setting to decide whether to cache all entries at first usage or not. See LocalizationSettings. So this shouldn't be a problem.\nBut a setting for \"LargeDatabase\" would be bad. (Since \"large database\" depends on the power of your SQL server)\nI think it would be better to just write a plugin for your large database where you override services/factories that struggle with your large database.. > It is not possible to override PrepareCategorySimpleModels function work using plugin. It is not supported.\nOf course it is supported.\nInside your plugin\n```\npublic class CustomCatalogModelFactory : CatalogModelFactory \n{\n    //... ctor\npublic override List<CategorySimpleModel> PrepareCategorySimpleModels(int rootCategoryId, bool loadSubCategories = true, IList<Category> allCategories = null) \n{ \n    //... your new code\n}\n\n}\n```\nInside plugin DependencyRegistrar\nbuilder.RegisterType<CustomCatalogModelFactory>().As<ICatalogModelFactory>().InstancePerLifetimeScope();. > And I think its a wrong idea to change basic nopcommerce parts using plugins\nPlease do not take offense: I think its a bad idea to change basic nopcommerce to support super high amounts of categories on bad SQL servers out of the box. And this only to increase page load on first visit.\nI've nothing against performance optimizations, but running different code parts based on a setting only makes code harder to maintain.. Yes it is really annoying.\nHere some links\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/8103\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2588\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2238\nBut i don't think it is because of 4.00. I am facing the same with a default project created by console (dotnet new mvc). So you only have plugin.json to identify the exact version of a plugin assembly.\nI cannot recommend this.. Sure it is a duplication. But now you removed one important way to identify the real version of an assembly.. We had the same issue in one of our plugins where we adapted the logic from product pictures.\nThe reason for this behavior is simple: The \"Add a new picture\" block doesn't get cleared so the same picture id is added to multiple product picture mappings entries but can only be deleted once.\nWe resolved this simply by reloading/clearing the \"Add a new picture\" block.. Are you sure you have restored all package references and rebuilt the whole solution?\n(they updated packages with 32e947b)\nBecause for me everything builds and runs well on Any CPU, x86 and x64.\nI've debugged and tested both Debug and Release Builds with IIS Express and Nop.Web.exe.\ngit ref is at 0268bf4\nWhat Visual Studio version are you using?. A way to do this is extending PermissionRecord with store id and handle this properly.\nBut then again, you have to add \"store id\" to almost everything.. I didn't knew that product edit page is store specific . What I mean is that nopCommerce Admin is not store specific. . Same in 3.9. Are there any plans to provide a \"hotfix\" for 4.0 or will this just be fixed with 4.1?. I once had problems with and older VS 2017 version.\nWith current version (2017 Pro 15.6.1) I've no problems. \nWhat version are you on?. Check TopicController.cs - TopicDetails Action\n. EF can load 120k rows in 0.4 seconds too. You just have to load them as \"no tracking\".. Well, this depends on your hosting environment.\nI made some experiences that nopCommerce is running extreme slow on low tier Azure DB or free/shared hosting. But only during first page views.\nAfter that most content is being served from cache.. See MemoryCacheOptions.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.memorycacheoptions?view=aspnetcore-2.1. Did you check how old your SO post is ?\nYou sure .net core is affected by the same?\n@override: you can simply override the dependency and thus replace the default memory cache. Either I get you wrong or I cannot reproduce this.\nTake a look at https://gist.github.com/Xzelsius/bb23217daa05eb9604a9f53705225aa2\nThat code creates around 10GB of cache entries. You can play around and go as high as you want.\nI never got a OutOfMemory exception. My development machine has around 16GB of RAM and the MemoryCache managed to keep ~50GB of cache entries (according to Visual Studio).\n\n. Since you are doing a readonly \"TableNoTracking\" query you'll have to .Include() every navigation property.. I solved this problem using a one-liner\nif (PluginManager.ReferencedPlugins?.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Installed && p.SystemName == \"PLUGIN-NAME\") == null) return;. IsMinimumOrderPlacementIntervalValid in ConfirmOrder() throws an exception and to display that exception the page reloads. -> The initial state of the button stays enabled.\nAnd on the other side, OpcConfirm is not affected by this.\n\nMaybe i understand #1456 wrong, but i thought the problem is the double click (double confirm request) where one request results in an empty cart page since the other request processed the cart. This script exactly prevents this.\nErrors that occour in ConfirmOrder() will still be visible after the page reload done by return View(model)\n. This makes nopCommerce harder to maintain. This makes nopCommerce harder to maintain. Why not using IRepository<LocalizedProperty>?. Why not using IRepository<UrlRecord>?. This makes nopCommerce harder to maintain. If there are 20 hardcoded SQL queries spread over 10 services and all for example are accessing Product and you for any reason change something related to that entity you probably have to change 20 SQL queries too. And thus have to remember where those queries are.\nInstead of _dbContext.Set<TEntity> you should use IRepository<TEntity>.Table...\nRegarding the dropdown problem with 20000 categories, how about an ajax powered search dropdown?\n1000 times better than to know category ids for 20000 categories or to do an id lookup everytime i want to map a category to a product.. > Btw are there any real reasons that we should use IRepository instead of IDbContext?\nExcept that nopCommerce does it this way, i think the only reason will be plugins. A plugin could replace the repository for lets say UrlRecord and provide a custom implementation for storing them, an thus IDbContext could lead to an error.. ",

A rough solution we've adopted is proposed in the comment and involves multiplying the error by the number of items in the cart.. @AndreiMaz Hi, you're absolutely right. The problem was that in the template the link was not showing up properly. Thanks for the tip and sorry for the inconvenience.\n. You're welcome \ud83d\udc4d . A third option may be to allow nulls in the Value of the Settings table.... I found the exception using Stackify prefix. The exception thrown is this\nSystem.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array. ---> System.Exception:  is not a valid value for Int32.\n  at System.ComponentModel.BaseNumberConverter.ConvertFrom\n--- End of inner exception stack trace ---\n  at System.ComponentModel.BaseNumberConverter.ConvertFrom\n  at System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter.IsValid\nThe explanation is that when you try to check if a value is valid (here SettingsService#L373), if it's a numeric value (nullable in this case) and the value to convert is an empty string, internally the method tries to make a conversion and throws an exception.\nIt's not a big issue but generally is not advisable to swallow exceptions (in this case in every request) and just a check that if the setting type it's a nullable value type and the setting value is and empty string the value will be null.\nTo see the exception in debug mode you need to disable 'Just my code' because it's thrown by .NET framework.. Well, the problem is not only storing the settings in one big value but that it's retrieved from Redis several times per request if I recall correctly.\nWhat's the advantage of having it in a monolithic way?\nIf I can make it work properly, would you accept a PR?. IsCurrentConnectionSecure works properly with the web.config setting in Cloudflare. That's not a problem.\nThe problem is here: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Presentation/Nop.Web/Global.asax.cs#L199\nThis comparison compares two strings, and as GetThisPageUrl(false) return http://.... and GetStoreLocation() honors request headers to determine if is SSL or not, returns a string starting with https://..., so it never matches and the culture is not properly set.\nI hope I explained myself better this time.. If you have Clouflare with Flex https (meaning you have a certificate in Cloudflare but the connection to your host is not secured), yes. It must rely on HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO to determine if you are under SSL and works properly.\nBut, as you ask, httpContext.Request.Url returns http:// because is not aware of this fact and that's why I added the code to change http for https.\n.

(product short description could be displayed on hover of the product thumb)\nThere should be a category filter at top of simple order form to show only products in currently selected category. Show all by default.\nOpening the simple phone order form should initiate a \"Phone Order session\" Once all items are added to cart, the normal checkout system could be used, but the customer email requirement must be made optional when the phone order session is active. If no email provided, don't tell EmailService to send customer notification...and as shoecake said, admins will need to be able to show any/all payment method options when that phone order session is active.\nWe should create an order note saying \"Phone order created by {CurrentAdminUsername}\" for accountability.\nAdmin settings:\nConfiguration >> Settings >> Order Settings >> Phone Orders (tab)\n--Enable Phone Orders\n (this makes new button to start new 'Phone Order' session appear in the admin order list view)\n--Checkout Payment Methods\n (this lets admin choose which payment methods will appear when phone order session is active)\n--Simple Order Form Designer\n (this lets admin choose which columns/and display order to appear in his simple order form)\nI think we can use existing checkout logic with simple conditional coding in the checkout view, based on \"phone order session\" value, and not need to duplicate core logic.\n.

    "tskaiser": "\nI cannot reproduce it.\n\nStrange. Am I misunderstanding the semantics? As I understand it ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency converts an amount from a source currency into the currency set as the primary store currency.\nSo say the primary store currency is DKK, and I have an amount in another currency. As I understand it ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency takes that amount along with the currency object of the source currency and converts the amount into DKK. Is this incorrect?\n\nWhat currency do you fetch?\n\nI fetch the currency using the currency service with the currency code \"EUR\" ie. I fetch the currency object representing euros, so in pseudo-C#\nvar euro = currencyService.GetCurrencyByCode(\"EUR\");\nvar amount = 50m;\nvar converted = currencyService.ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency(amount, euro);\nIn my scenario I have \"DKK\" as primary store currency, and \"EUR\" as the exchange rate currency. The Rate of \"EUR\" is 1, and the rate of \"DKK\" is ~7.5. So they are materially different. Yet I get converted == 50m back out.\nIf I instead do\nvar euro = currencyService.GetCurrencyByCode(\"EUR\");\nvar dkk = currencyService.GetCurrencyByCode(\"DKK\");\nvar amount = 50m;\nvar converted = currencyService.ConvertCurrency(amount, euro, dkk);\nI get the correct amount out, but those results should have been equivalent!\n. ```\n    public virtual decimal ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency(decimal amount, Currency sourceCurrencyCode)\n    {\n        if (sourceCurrencyCode == null)\n            throw new ArgumentNullException(\"sourceCurrencyCode\");\n    var primaryStoreCurrency = GetCurrencyById(_currencySettings.PrimaryStoreCurrencyId);\n    if (primaryStoreCurrency == null)\n        throw new Exception(\"Primary store currency cannot be loaded\");\n\n    decimal result = amount;\n    if (result != decimal.Zero && sourceCurrencyCode.Id != primaryStoreCurrency.Id)\n    {\n        decimal exchangeRate = sourceCurrencyCode.Rate;\n        if (exchangeRate == decimal.Zero)\n            throw new NopException(string.Format(\"Exchange rate not found for currency [{0}]\", sourceCurrencyCode.Name));\n        result = result / exchangeRate;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\n```\nThis is the code for ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency. Notice that the rate of the source currency is the only rate used, not the rate for the primary store currency. The primary store currency is only used to check that it is not the same as the source currency.\nSo for my example it simply checks euro.Id != dkk.Id and then divides the amount with euro.Rate. This does not convert to the primary store currency, this converts to the exchange rate currency. I imagine your test cases have both the exchange rate and primary store currency be the same?\n. To reduce points of failure I would reuse ConvertCurrency and propose something like\n```\npublic virtual decimal ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency(decimal amount, Currency sourceCurrency)\n{\n    if (sourceCurrency == null)\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(\"sourceCurrency\");\nvar primaryStoreCurrency = GetCurrencyById(_currencySettings.PrimaryStoreCurrencyId);\nif (primaryStoreCurrency == null)\n    throw new Exception(\"Primary store currency cannot be loaded\");\n\nreturn ConvertCurrency(amount, sourceCurrency, primaryStoreCurrency);\n\n}\n```\n. I can't from my current position due to workplace restrictions.\nThat said, please read my two last comments as they clearly describe both the scenario, the point of failure in the code, and how to fix it.\n. If you insist, but the bug location has already been identified and described. The code for ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency does not even touch the required information to be able to make the described conversion.\n\n. To reiterate what I have already described, ConvertToPrimaryStoreCurrency returns the amount converted to the primary exchange rate currency. It misses the step where it actually uses the primary store currency to convert it from that into the expected result.\n. Happy to be of assistance.\n. Regarding the label, is there a design choice against it or would it simply be more expedient if I found the time to code and issue a pull request with the necessary changes? :)\n. After researching it the problem seems central to the Entity Framework, so the proposed solution would most likely not work. In essence, when enough entities have been touched the performance degrades catastrophically.\nOur local solution is to manually chunk up the work using Autofac scopes and then recreating a new scope after an arbitrary (30) number of iterations. This indirectly leads to a new EF context being created where used. With this method the running time of the problem task has been reduced from unsustainable (>1 day) to manageable (minutes).\n. We are syncing/inserting in the vicinity of 10k products using EF within the order of minutes when recreating the contexts using Autofac scopes. Have you tried profiling to detect any hot paths? We discovered some of our plugins caught every product update event and manually resolved a logger using the request lifetime scope. This alone triggered the EF degradation issue massively slowing down everything. However it sounds like you completely bypassed the service layers so unless you are manually publishing the events that might not be your problem.\nThat said you're not going to beat an optimized stored procedure using EF, so now that you have one I could understand sticking with it - I would. The reason I'm staying with scopes is exactly to avoid breaking the abstractions and maintainability.\n. @kfuglsang Sure.\nYou can use var scope = EngineContext.Current.ContainerManager.Container.BeginLifetimeScope() to fetch a new scope object. You can use this object to resolve types registered with Autofac, which will be independent from the current scope eg.\nvar products = scope.Resolve<IRepository<Product>>();\nAs a side-effect this means all services and repositories resolved using this scope will be using a fresh underlying context. Once it has gone 'stale' (performance has degraded) you can make a new one again.\nBe aware that EF does not support mixing of entities from different contexts, so beware of doing this. A good rule of thumb is to use no reference types from previous scopes and to be done with all data from the current process chunk before starting on a new one with a new scope.. I originally made this service interface to reuse this pattern of \"chunking\"\npublic interface IScoped { ILifetimeScope SetScope(ILifetimeScope scope);  }\nWhere SetScope is meant to be implemented so it re-resolves all Autofact references in a service, eg.\n```\npublic class SomeService : IScoped {\n  private IProductService _productService;\n  private ICategoryService _categoryService;\npublic SomeService(IProductService productService, ICategoryService categoryService) {\n    _productService = productService;\n    _categoryService = categoryService;\n  }\npublic SetScope(ILifetimeScope scope) {\n    _productService = scope.Resolve();\n    _categoryService = scope.Resolve();\n  }\n}\n```\nI then made extension methods to facilitate chunked processing of data:\n```\npublic static class ScopedExtensions {\nprivate static ILifetimeScope NewScope => EngineContext.Current.ContainerManager.Container.BeginLifetimeScope();\nprivate static ILifetimeScope RequestScope => EngineContext.Current.ContainerManager.Scope();\npublic static void ChunkedScopeProcessing(\n    this IScoped self,\n    IEnumerable input,\n    int chunkSize,\n    Action action\n  ) {\n    var scope = self.SetNewScope();\n    try {\n      var i = 1;\n      foreach (var arg in input) {\n        if (i%chunkSize == 0) {\n          scope.Dispose();\n          scope = self.SetNewScope();\n        }\n        i++;\n        action(arg);\n      }\n    }\n    finally {\n      scope.Dispose();\n      self.SetRequestScope();\n    }\n  }\npublic static ILifetimeScope SetRequestScope(this IScoped self) {\n    return self.SetScope(RequestScope);\n  }\npublic static ILifetimeScope SetNewScope(this IScoped self) {\n    return self.SetScope(NewScope);\n  }\n}\n```\nThis enables an IScoped service to call this.ChunkedScopeProcessing(input, chunkSize, action) where action is some void function, such as a void method group on this or a lambda. The result is that it runs action on the elements of the input, recreating the scope every chunkSize iterations.. ",

This would allow more flexibility & transparency for store admins wishing to work with the images directly. Currently, (as I understand it) there is no way to reference an existing original image that is already on the web server (except by import & then image gets a filename change & duplicated)... and no practical way to identify which image should be \"overwritten\" manually with an updated 'original' if the store admin wishes to do so.\nIMO, there is no reason for most of our products to 'automatically' duplicate the exact same image (unless I choose for that to be the case for a specific SEO benefit)...

    "andrewlock": "Hi Andrei,\nThanks for looking at this. I have put together a pull request showing my proposal for your interest. \nThe only downside I can see is the need to reference AutoMapper in Nop.Core, but as long as you are not concerned about that (and I don't see any reason to be) then it should solve the plugin configuration problem.\nLooking forward to your input!\n. Thanks Andrei. Just to clarify, are you saying it worked fine on develop (as in,  you couldn't reproduce the problem) or that it worked fine with the pull request? \n. Apologies Andrei, I'm not sure if you've understand the problem correctly, but do let me know if I'm just misunderstanding you! \nIf you call AutoMapperConfiguration.Init() in AutoMapperStartupTaskTest, then that will work fine in your AutoMapperConfigurationTest when run in isolation. However at runtime, the two AutoMapperStartup tasks will conflict, both calling Init() - the last IStartupTask to run will replace the MapperConfiguration and IMapper with its own registrations, causing runtime exceptions when you try to map anything from the other project. \nInstead, we need to ensure all configurations are applied before calling _mapperConfiguration.CreateMapper() in AutoMapperConfiguration.Init(), and also that the Mapper and  MapperConfiguration properties cannot be overwritten;\nThe other problem as it stands is that every project and plugin that uses AutoMapper would need to reference the Nop.Admin project, in order to reference the AutoMapperConfiguration class.\nI think my pull request deals with both of these issues. :smile:\n. Excellent, you've definitely nailed a better implementation, thanks! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Actually, I've just discovered the problem and you've already fixed it in e987f90ae926ffa9681f6afebccc6c071b2be421.

Maybe less dependency on file system with data settings in json and utilize Azure Key Vault?\nCould make that as part of the setup - put in config settings for keyvault - use those in session to auth in, grab DB settings and then move on?. Good news! I was able to pull the 4.1 beta down and confirm my suspicion - having a true full asp.net core project (not a weird mix of core targeting net461) and Docker tools worked out of the box on the new solution! Plane landed so I had to close laptop and haven't actually run the container yet but that is a big step.\nStill - having an official Docker image to use as a Base is a must.

I've been working with Azure tech support on this and from looking at storage diagnostics logs you can be waiting 33MS for one call to Exists(), x100 images on a page and you have a big problem. Microsoft don't seem to make any claims about SLA on server response time for the API, only availability. I also discovered by default the function uses an exponential retry policy where if the call fails it will try again on a sliding scale of time. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazurestorage/2011/02/02/overview-of-retry-policies-in-the-windows-azure-storage-client-library/\nI have set the retry policy to NoRetry(), the worse thing to happen would be a place holder for the image if it happens the first time someone requested it. . I have put a temporary solution in place and the site is now 'lightning fast'. In the GeneratedThumbExists function I am caching the result of the Exists() call in static cache. The server response time is now well under 1 second and the whole site is much more responsive. . Agree, customer should be able to register and carry on browsing without disturbing the flow.

Hi,\nI am running 2017 Enterprise 15.6.1. I just upgraded to the newest 15.6.2, and although I have not tried it yet, I'm not expecting vastly improved performance. I really wish I knew what it was about the project causing the poor performance. I regularly work with a half-dozen much-larger solutions, and do not experience the slow downs.. I can't figure out what is different in these solutions. Many of the projects they contain also use ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, etc. \nFWIW, during times that the Visual Studio is unresponsive, there is constant CPU usage of around 30-40 percent, usually. This is the only indication that the program is actually doing anything. And it generally does recover. Startup is the very worst, so I try to close the solution as rarely as possible. Building and debugging are actually not nearly as slow as startup. Judging by the lack of responses, I'm assuming not many other people have encountered (or been very bothered by) this issue. Perhaps if I post it in the forum, I'll get a wider range of responses.\nI'm still open to any suggestions! Thanks.. ",

Will be happy to provide any support.. yes, GDPR compliance is fairly comprehensive exercise, which includes complete analysis of the business and applications with regard to handling and processing of personal data, appointing DPO (data protection officer) and formulating policies and procedures. But here we are looking at only the application part where our Clients are using nopCommerce as a platform for their B2C and B2B projects. Our clients can alter the parts of their nopCommerce configuration to achieve basic compliance, such as, data encryption and user registration forms for consent and 'right to erasure'. They would need to make changes in the user table in db to ensure the personal information is stored in encrypted form. However, we can build and offer a ready-made solution in nopCommerce to meet these requirements. At the moment default registration form (http://demo.nopcommerce.com/register) are simple and do not contain fields (in form and db) that they would need to manage consent as per the GDPR requirement. Also at present the personal data (name, address, etc) are not encrypted in the user table in db of nopCommerce.\nWe, at Tmotions are in the process of developing plug-ins which will be available at the nop marketplace and can be integrated easily to fulfil these requirements. We are also exploring the option of using a third party user/identity management service which can be integrated to nopCommerce.\nI will keep you informed on this.\nI can't comment on ODATA as we have never implemented it.. join the webinar \"nopCommerce & GDPR\" to learn more on this topic.\nhttps://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/5043168854127692547\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Is your business compliant? \nThe EU GDPR is due to come into effect in May 2018. GDPR will require businesses to demonstrate that they are protecting the personal data rights of EU Citizens. The GDPR will have significant impact on e-commerce and online businesses that deal with customers and users in the EU countries, even if they are based outside of the EU, and regardless of Brexit. \nIn this webinar, experts from TMotions and Digital Governance will share practical insights for organisations of all sizes to help them prepare for the GDPR, and how nopCommerce-based applications need to make essential changes to achieve GDPR compliance. \nWhat you will learn: \n\u2022   Key things you need to know about the EU data protection regulation changes \n\u2022   GDPR impact on e-commerce and online shops \n\u2022   GDPR compliance in nopCommerce based applications \n\u2022   Compliance by Design \nAfter registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.\n.

    "demckee": "I don't understand why this has an \"on hold/maybe won't\" tag. There are multiple spots where multiple redirections are generated. For example: https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/48817/multiple-redirects.aspx\nFixing this should be pretty straightforward. All of these attributes use similar code to form their redirection. Just build one routine in a common spot (like IWebHelper) and use the routine to form the redirected URL.. From what I understand, the ClearPluginAssemblies code runs after the Nop.Web project is built. If you have a plugin, it might not be built before Nop.Web is. The result is that the plugin output directories might or might not be cleared. If you have a project that depends on Nop.Web, it will always be built after Nop.Web, and thus the dlls might not be deleted.\nIf you take the system and Clean it, then build the solution, you will find that not all of the plugin directories are properly cleaned. If you build a second time they will be. You get similar results when you publish - if you don't do a couple of full solution builds before publishing, not all plugins will be properly built.. I'm not going to say I totally understand all of the stuff that's going on when the solution is built. I've read the csproj files, both for plugins and nop.web. From the comments, there is extra work being done in nop.web after the project is built.\nThat being said, I do know there are lots of weirdness going on during a build. Running a Clean doesn't always work - you have to run it multiple times. Similarly running a build all doesn't always work. Again you have to do this multiple times. Publish is another one like this. I suspect it's mostly a Visual Studio issue, but again I don't know. It really just comes down to it not working well.\nNop.Web is the target of everything - it's what is run. Logically, Nop.Web depends on all of the plugins to operate cleanly, but VS doesn't know/understand that. The models/factories shouldn't be in Nop.Web if you expect anyone to ever need access to them from a plugin. In fact, Nop.Web shouldn't have anything that will need to be used from a plugin. . Would you be so kind as to explain why this suggestion was rejected? There was no negative feedback (including from the team). Indeed, there was only positive feedback. So, why reject it?. Yes, it was annoying to find it moved without notice in 4.10.\nFrom what I've been able to understand, there are security issues when you use compression over https. The default in the Microsoft code is to disable compression when https is used. However, this is a poor solution as some things (bundled css/js) have no sensitive information, and can be safely compressed. The issue relates to a BREACH attack, and would apply to pages showing sensitive information only. So, it sounds like what we need is a way of selectively enabling/disabling compression, on a per-page basis. It should be disabled for the back-end, and enabled for most public pages.. ",

Like I mentioned before good example of this issue is PayPal Standard plugin which comes with NopCommerce, given you have source for that one, but if you didnt you wouldnt be able to fix it.\nThats why i propsosed for NopCommerce to have standard view and action for this process, which will call method which could be overriden and customised in plugin. I think its nice and clean solution for this issue.. I agree. I think the problem is Kendoo controls, which has very limited functionality out of the box. DevExpress is lot better with its dynamic filter builder on grid view, plus they have normal filtering and sorting a lot better in first place. This been issue for many of our customers, that said that filtering and sorting on each of admin page is very limited and they would like to have each property of the entity managed been configurable in filter... So for example, if I want to search for combination of where order total price over 50$ and where customer name start with 'R' and order placed this month and its status is Pending, I can not do that currently.  Here is basically what im referring to:\nhttps://demos.devexpress.com/MVCxGridViewDemos/Filtering/FilterBuilder\nPS. I'm not in anyways advertising devexpress or have any interest in it...

    "chlela": "@AndreiMaz I'm probably missing something. Your referred work item states that NopCommerce 4.0 forces SSL everywhere but I'm not seeing this behavior.  I'm actually facing an opposite behavior where my site https://soutoujewelry.com redirects to http://soutoujewelry.com and after a user logs in, it looks like they haven't logged in. If I click on my account then it redirects to https site and all login attributes are reflected.\nI thought it was a caching issue but I tried different browsers and it still redirects home page from HTTPS to HTTP.  I feel like it's a misconfiguration that I can't figure out. I changed the store default URL to HTTPS so I started getting too many redirects.  Before I write my own wildcard redirect rule, I was wondering if there is a setting that I need to flip.\nThanks.

That will be greatly help understand the issue and speed up the RCA... \nI was saying I added one line of code in GA setting(see screenshot) so that I could see the activity from my localhost in GA. I see we have changed the tracking code in v4.1 and I will add that line to v4.1 in GA to test it.. @AndreiMaz I have preformed step 1 to 5 and order has been placed. Now I went to GA and it looks as below. Can you show me where to see step 6 \"You'll see in GA only one product line (SKU) with qty 1 (that it wrong)\" please? Cellphone1 is the product I created and it two values in it.\n\n. Alright I think I found it in the code the EnableEcommerce need to be enabled. I will try that tomorrow. \nBut please confirm following GA setting if they are correct settings. Can it fire api ProcessOrderEvent in EventConsumer class?\nShould we go with Google Analytics or Universal Analytics?\nWhich checkbox need to be checked in order to reproduce this issue?\n\nThanks,\nJustin \n. Thank you AM. I have been on vacations with family and lost track on this issue. I will then look at other issues. . I will take a look at it. . @AndreiMaz Pull request has been submitted for this issue. Please have a look and let me know if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nJustin. @cnEUL I have tested newly created GDBR settings and it looks like you are right there is no header in the registration page. \nBut as with the margin of the textbox, it looks fine on my side. I tested with IE and Chrome. See the screenshot. I wonder what browser you are using and it might be caused by the wording. Can you try English text instead? I just want to replicate it on my end. \nimage\n\nThanks,\nJustin \n. @cnEUL Thanks for checking it again and I am glad the GDPR consents checkbox margin and distance are ok now. In term of if it is better to bring them together into one upper \"Options\" box, I wouldn't do so because GDPR could have multiple consents displaying in the box. \n@AndreiMaz I am going to work with this issue which is to add GDPR Headline into registration process. \nThanks,\nJustin . @AndreiMaz can you assign it to me? I am already  ready to check in this . @mariannk Yes the only issue here is no headline for GDBR Concerts. I am on it and I am going to check in the changes very soon.. @mariannk I checked into my branch, and will create a pull request once my previous request is completed.. @AndreiMaz Thanks for the feedback. I have updated upgrade.sql and please have a look and let me know if you have any questions. . @DmitriyKulagin You are welcome! Glad I could help.... @DmitriyKulagin I will take a look at this issue and I will refer to your  today's commit. . @DmitriyKulagin I am pretty much done with the changes and just wanted to make sure that if we need to have confirmation window for both Save and SaveAndContinue events.. @DmitriyKulagin I checked in additional changes to make sure confirmation window only opens when condition of warehouse quantity is met. Please review it and let me know if you have any questions.\n\n\nAs soon as you we button save button id with nop-action-confirmation tag helper, button click would open confirmation window always. This works fine for pretty much all the case, such as a Delete button, but not in this case.\n\n\nThe confirmation window has to open when a condition met. Otherwise, it won't display confirm window. I have added workaround code to resolve this case. Basically I have looked what nop-action-confirmation did, and removed its auto generated code by tag helper on the fly, in button focus event prior to click event, it resets button status so it wont call confirmation window method.\n\n\nI made a little more changes to make the code neat and dry, like jquery chaining and self calling 'this'.  \n\n\nThe script included in the if statement \"if (itemsFromMultipleWarehouses.Any())\", I will need to remove it and make a little adjustment to sb sting to return a true if there is no items. The reason to remove line of 'if (itemsFromMultipleWarehouses.Any())' is because, in case there is no warehouse settings, and the entire script inside if statement won't happen, and the script I wrote to remove confirmation tag helper won't happen either,  the confirmation window should not appear, but we already bind the save button with nop-action-confirmation, this is causing confirmation window open where we donot want it open. I hope I made it a little clear.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nJustin \n. Any updates? Andrei. Perhaps we could get this in and refactoring tag helper later.. @RomanovM can you elaborate it a bit more?. @RomanovM Having looked at the code.. can you confirm following:\nGenericAttributeExtensions class as an example,\nremove this line\n    var genericAttributeService = EngineContext.Current.Resolve<IGenericAttributeService>();\nand then change to use constructors with dependency injection as follows:\nprivate readonly IGenericAttributeService _genericAttributeService;\n        public GenericAttributeExtensions(IGenericAttributeService genericAttributeService,)\n        {\n            this._genericAttributeService = genericAttributeService;\n        }\nIf this is correct understanding and approach, I will start making the changes. Please let me know. \nThanks,\nJustin\n. Good catch. The radio box should be dropped.. @DmitriyKulagin  Can you elaborate it a lit more about \"A sentence with the addition of a condition I like more, because code in this case should get clearer.\"? As soon as save button binds with nop-action-confirmation, then the confirmation windows always happens. Okay I will try to add more condition to click event to see if that could be resolved.. @DmitriyKulagin Well hidden buttons wont work but I found a workaround that I am working on now. Will let you know when I finish testing and I want to make sure it works without any issues.  . Any updates? Perhaps we could get this in first and refactoring confirmation tag helper later.  . @DmitriyKulagin ok good catch, I will check it out.. @DmitriyKulagin okay it is fixed. Thanks! Let me know if you any questions. . @VR-Architect Thanks for sharing your findings. . @mariannk any updates on this?. @mariannk ### any updates on this?. @cnEUL Thanks for checking it. I will close this pr then. Thanks!\nThanks,\nJustin . @AndreiMaz  please close this pull request.. I will look into it.. ok will do. ",

Either way, the script for the NivoSlider isn't able to be versioned with \"asp-append-version\", and neither will any other plugin script.

This neither deleted the entries in the table nor set the flag IsActive to false.\nI removed the Tags from the table directly.\nBack to Products, I edited the first product and re-inserted the tags required. This inserted the following rows to the table:\nId  EntityId    EntityName  Slug    IsActive    LanguageId\n115 8   BaseEntity  plinth  1   0\n116 9   BaseEntity  painted-2   1   0\n117 10  BaseEntity  30x30cm 1   0\n118 11  BaseEntity  40cm-high   1   0\nHmm, not sure this is correct... I edited these tags tags via the Product Tags page, resulting in new entries in the table in addition to those created in the previous step.\nId  EntityId    EntityName  Slug    IsActive    LanguageId\n120 12  BaseEntity  plinth  1   0\n121 13  BaseEntity  painted-2   1   0\n122 14  BaseEntity  30x30cm 1   0\n123 15  BaseEntity  40cm-high   1   0\n124 14  ProductTag  30x30cm-2   1   0\n125 15  ProductTag  40cm-high-2 1   0\n126 13  ProductTag  painted-3   1   0\n127 12  ProductTag  plinth-2    1   0\nI hope this helps track down the bug that looks to be assigning the wrong entity type when creating tags via product page editing or duplication.\nI'd like to know whether the system is designed to delete unused entries in the table - by not clearing them out on changes the result is some pretty ugly friendly urls being created.\nIf you look at the table at the starting point of this post, there could well be other methods not working as expected. Half of my links were not working.\nThe whole system of generating friendly urls should be checked for operation as I am sure that there is a larger underlying problem.\nFor example, creating a product, save and continue, then save produces these entries:\nId  EntityId    EntityName  Slug    IsActive    LanguageId\n128 4   BaseEntity  sample-product  1   0\n129 4   Product sample-product-2    1   0\nThe same thing for categories:\nId  EntityId    EntityName  Slug    IsActive    LanguageId\n130 51  BaseEntity  sample-category 1   0\n131 51  Category    sample-category-2   1   0\nDeleting these samples via the web interface leaves the entries in the table unaltered.. Returning to the original issue, I discovered that when updating a product and adding a new tag, this generated the error. By deleting all entries in the Product_ProductTag_Mapping table for the product prior to saving the edit, the error did not occur. I further discovered that even if no edits were made to tag entries, saving a product edit generated the error for any product which contained tags.\nI believe this error is caused by not deleting all entries in the Product_ProductTag_Mapping table for the product prior to saving current entries, or alternatively checking the contents of this table for changes to tag entries before writing new ones to the table, or by constructing the table with primary keys on both fields.\nMy observations regarding the creation and editing of friendly urls seem unconnected and this probably should be moved to a separate issue\nI'd like to contribute to the development of NopCommerce, but have never been through the process of contributing via GitHub.

I sent the .pdf's with the complete PCI test methods and results to AndreiMaz, but would prefer not to post them here publicly due to security concerns.. That didn't fix the issue.

PCI scan company says: \nSolution\nWindows 2012 R2 Standard\nFilter all data collected from the client including user-supplied content and browser content such as Referrer and User-Agent headers.\nAny data collected from the client and displayed in a Web page should be HTML-encoded to ensure the content is rendered as text instead of an HTML element or JavaScript.. That fixed the issue on one site. After making those changes to web.config, our site on 3.60 now passes. The smaller site on 4.00 still fails. On the same server.. ...and actually, still failing on both.\nSeverity Medium\nCVSS Score 4.3\nDescription\nXSS vulnerabilities occur when the Web application echoes user-supplied data in an HTML response sent to the Web browser. For example, a Web application\nmight include the user's name as part of a welcome message or display a home address when confirming a shipping destination. If the user-supplied data conta\nin characters that are interpreted as part of an HTML element instead of literal text, then an attacker can modify the HTML that is received by the victim's Web b\nrowser.\nThe XSS payload is echoed in HTML document returned by the request. An XSS payload may consist of HTML, JavaScript or other content that will be rendere\nd by the browser. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would need to trick a victim into visiting the URL with the XSS payload.\nIn this case, the scanner identified the vulnerability by injecting a payload as part of the path component of the URL, as opposed to other kinds of XSS attacks t\nhat inject the payload into URL parameter values.. Solution\nWindows 2012 R2 Standard\nFilter all data collected from the client including user-supplied content and browser content such as Referrer and User-Agent headers.\nAny data collected from the client and displayed in a Web page should be HTML-encoded to ensure the content is rendered as text instead of an HTML element or JavaScript.. Doesn't help me though, because the extended security policy should fix that, correct?. The answer they gave me: \"the headers you configured for the website are being sent to the browser properly, which instructs modern browsers to protect against XSS attacks, however the website may still be vulnerable to XSS attacks if URL parameters are not sanitized.\". 3.6 is still passing. 4.0 is not..

You could try private/incognito mode to try to see if that's the case.\nThe exceptions you see should be from email scheduler trying to reach your problematic server.

    "astrumcs": "@Leftyx Thanks for the reference back to your issue entry.  Definitely gives some food for thought on  solving my problem.  I'll be focusing on this over the next few days and will pass on any epiphanies I run into. . I'm finishing up my changes to use a paged wishlist instead of the full list being returned.  \nAfter quite a bit of looking around and analysis, one of the big performance killers is this statement:\n```\n//whether other cart items require the passed product\nvar passedProductRequiredQuantity = cart\n  .Where(item => item.Product.RequireOtherProducts && \n  _productService.ParseRequiredProductIds(item.Product).Contains(product.Id))\n  .Sum(item => item.Quantity * requiredProductQuantity);\n```\nThis line is run in ShopperCartService.cs in the GetRequiredProductWarnings method.  With a large wishlist (or shopping cart for that matter).  This line will just kill performance.  On top of that, the use case is probably one that is not used very often.  So it ends up being a check that is probably not needed on many installations.\nMy fix is to check if there are any products in the cart that have the RequireOtherProducts bit set.  If there are not any, the Linq query is skipped.  Huge gain.\nIn my mind, it seems that the real fix is to break out this functionality into a many to many database table that will contain and define the relationship between products for required products.   This would change the check to a fairly simple (and fast) check of product.RequiredProducts.Any() against the database.  The check in the reverse direction would be just as quick and simple: product.RequiredBy.Any() or something similar. . My basic change is to insert this line above the problem line listed above:\n```\n// The code for passedProductRequiredQuantity is not necessary if there are not any \n// other products in the cart that have RequireOtherProducts.  So, do a quick check \n// for those products before doing the way more expensive work that passedProductRequiredQuantity does\nvar cartProductIds = cart.Select(r => r.ProductId);\nvar products = _productRepository.TableNoTracking.Where(r => cartProductIds.Contains(r.Id));\nif (!products.Any(r => r.RequireOtherProducts))\n    return warnings;\n```\nUnder my testing setup, this resulted in a 10x improvement in page load for a 20 item wishlist. \nAdditionally, I have implemented the paged wishlist so that there are only 20 or so items being retrieved and displayed at once.. The lazy loading fix described in #3419 made huge gains for this problem as well. \nI ended up leaving the check that I outline above in the production code because it really does save unnecessary processing in many cases. \n. @AndreiMaz,  \nI have implemented the class recommended by the EF Core folks as a work around for the lazy loading issue.\nIt has been in production for several days and I have not yet seen any issues with it.  The performance improvement was significant.   A 100 item cart that was taking minutes to load is now consistently loading in less than 2 seconds.  Similar improvements were seen in other parts of the site that perform heavy lazy loading or repetitive SQL requests.\nFeedback is welcome:\n```\nnamespace Nop.Data\n{\n    public class EFLazyLoaderFix : ILazyLoader\n    {\n        private readonly ILazyLoader _efCoreLazyLoader;\n        private readonly ICurrentDbContext _currentContext;\n    public EFLazyLoaderFix(ICurrentDbContext currentContext, IDiagnosticsLogger<DbLoggerCategory.Infrastructure> logger)\n    {\n        _currentContext = currentContext;\n        _efCoreLazyLoader = new LazyLoader(currentContext, logger);\n    }\n\n    private bool AutoDetectChangesEnabled\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return _currentContext.Context.ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled;\n        }\n        set\n        {\n            _currentContext.Context.ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled = value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Load(object entity, [CallerMemberName] string navigationName = null)\n    {\n        var originalChangeTrackingState = AutoDetectChangesEnabled;\n        try\n        {\n            AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false;\n            _efCoreLazyLoader.Load(entity, navigationName);\n        }\n        finally\n        {\n            if (originalChangeTrackingState)\n                AutoDetectChangesEnabled = true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public async Task LoadAsync(object entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken), [CallerMemberName] string navigationName = null)\n    {\n        var originalChangeTrackingState = AutoDetectChangesEnabled;\n        try\n        {\n            AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false;\n            await _efCoreLazyLoader.LoadAsync(entity, cancellationToken, navigationName);\n        }\n        finally\n        {\n            if (originalChangeTrackingState)\n                AutoDetectChangesEnabled = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nI also make the following call at the bottom of UseSqlServerWithLazyLoading method in the DbContextOptionsBuilderExtensions class.\noptionsBuilder.ReplaceService<ILazyLoader, EFLazyLoaderFix>();. @pantonis You added the class above and then modified the DbContextOptionsBuilderExtensions class located in the source tree in this file? \nPresentation/Nop.Web.Framework/Infrastructure/Extensions/DbContextOptionsBuilderExtensions.cs\n      . I'll dig back into it and see if there was anything else that changed.   What kind of load times are you getting on carts with 30 or 40 separate line items?. @pantonis,\nWell, the only other I have concerns a check for dependencies between products in the cart.  My most recent implementation of nop does not require this.  So, here is a link to the code that I ended up skipping because I don't need it.  I just issue a return warnings; just above this line.\nAs I recall, I did this change before I made the change to the lazy loading.   Cutting out the required product check helped, but, for me, the lazy loading seemed to be the real improvement.. ",

It's about 2-3x faster than before.\nFor example a simple ajax call went down from about 500ms to 100-130ms.\nI'm not sure this is a correct workaround or not, because I don't know the full impact of the changes to the nopCommerce.\nI think some redesing/refact is needed here from nopCommerce.. Just another proof.. From the picture, is clearly seeable the modification make the site performs better.\n\n. ",
    "soci1248": "Can someone explain what is the rationale behind the MemoryCacheManager?\n1. What is the exact responsibilities it wants to achieve?\n2. Particularly, what is the purpose of the _allKeys dictionary? Why it is needed, why the underlying cache cannot supply this information?\nI would be happy to optimize it and contribute it back, but first I have to understand exactly why did you introduce the _allKeys dictionary? For larger sites it kills all the cpus, this is a serious performance bug.. Based on a preliminary analysis I see the following problems. \nWhen there are many items in the cache RegisterPostEvictionCallback calls back the PostEviction method very frequently. Consider 100000 items, all expiring in 1 hour, and their creation are evenly distributed within an hour. Then every 3600 sec / 100000=0.036 second you got a callback in this method. This is 27 call per second. The real situation is much worse, because the cache additions are not evenly distributed at all in time.\nWhat does PostEviction do? It calls ClearKeys, which iterates thru _allKeys using a linear search (Where). For 100000 items this needs considerable time and CPU. This is the reason a production server is experiencing slowdown during a day. I used procdump to create a memory dump when the CPU for the worker process is more than 90% for 30 seconds. What did I see in the dump? 14 of the 30 threads were executing ClearKeys! Because it is a tight CPU loop, it sucks all CPUs to the ground.\nWhy do you call ClearKeys for when an item is removed from the cache? Why bother checking other items during the callback of a particular item? Why not call ClearKeys on a timer thread for every 10 seconds or so?\nThe next one, this actually also causes serious CPU burning is the IsCrawler method. It creates 5000 regex object for each call, and evaluates all of them if the user agent string is not a search engine. If you simply create and store the Regex object instead of string during the initialization the performance doubles at least. If you concat the pieces by (regex1)|(regex2), etc. manner to create one, big regex, the performance becomes even better.\nWhy I mention this method too? After a day of profiling I can claim that 75% of the CPU is eaten by ClearKeys and IsCrawler!!!\nOne other problem which does not bother me at this moment because I don't see it in the profiler and the memory dumps, but can cause pain in the back later: RemoveByPattern. \nThis is problematic, the code creates a compiled regex for each call! Compiled regex without caching the regex objects? \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/513412/how-does-regexoptions-compiled-work. Good progress, thanks. One more very easy but dramatically efficient optimization could exploit the fact that there is a strong serial correlation between the bot requests. I.e. google starts to crawl a site it will do it for the next several minutes. When the BrowscapXmlHelper identified a bot using the slow regex approach it could cache the exact user agent string which come from the bot. So, for the subsequent request it could answer from this cache within nanoseconds.\nA HashSet + lock might be appropriate for this task, or you could use ConcurrentDictionary with null Value.\nIf you afraid filling the memory with cached user agent strings you can use a sliding time expiration cache with 1-2 hours of duration.. What about the ClearKeys()? As I wrote it causes 3 times more severe performance problems than the regex thing. What I don't understand from the design, why do you store the keys redundantly when the underlying cache already stores them?\nIt seems maintaining this redundancy is the reason of the big perf hit.\nActually, I don't understand the intent of the developer.\n                //try to remove key from dictionary\n                if (!allKeys.TryRemove(key, out ))\n                    //if not possible to remove key from dictionary, then try to mark key as not existing in cache\n                {\n                    _allKeys.TryUpdate(key, false, true);\n                }\nWhen TryRemove returns false? When the item is already removed by a concurrent thread. Then why do you want to update it to false when it is already deleted?\nIt is possible I misunderstood the code, but I think some serious thinking is needed for this implementation. \nAfter you make it efficient, you can advertise the product become 4 times faster. :). Burning the CPU even every 10 seconds is a waste of time yet. This issue should be handled by correct data structures, not by slowing down the CPU sucking cycle. _keysToRemove idea is much better i believe.. Sure, less call, less cpu.\nDoes someone who wrote the code can reason about my TryRemove opinion? And why we need a redudant key collection when the underlying cache already stores them?. Good news. :)\nWhen you implement all changes we suggested you will trim that 70% overhead entirely (about 3-fold perf gain). Your CPUs become idle, and your customers happy. :). ",

It creates 5000 regex object for each call, and evaluates all of them if the user agent string is not a search engine. If you simply create and store the Regex object instead of string during the initialization the performance doubles at least. If you concat the pieces by (regex1)|(regex2), etc. manner to create one, big regex, the performance becomes even better.\n\nI modified the BrowscapXmlHelper.cs as suggested above and placed it in a test harness. I can confirm that this will provide a boost in performance to this method. On average the isCrawler() method ran in about 1/3rd the time. I also tried using the RegexOptions.Compiled but I verified that there is a bug in newer versions of .Net which actually causes a significant decrease in performance when using this option.\nMy test harness with updated BrowscapXmlHelper code is available at https://github.com/fpdavis/BrowsCapTest. So a quick update on this. We were having server issues every day during peak load where multiple servers would slow down to a crawl until we restarted it. After implementing the isCrawler Regex change we have not had any server issues. We are also looking at the ClearKeys but we have a few unanswered questions around that before we figure out the best way to address it (as others have been pointing out). We will post more on this later.\nAs far as caching the exact user agent string from the request and checking the cache first before running the string through the Regex... I was a little confused why it would ever need to run the customer back through the isCrawler method once the \"customer\" was identified as a bot. After further examination of the code I see that it does indeed run every non cached, non System account through this check.\nMy question is why isn't the call to _authenticationService.GetAuthenticatedCustomer() above the IsSearchEngine check in WebWorkContext.cs? This would drastically reduce the number of times the isCrawler method is called.. ",
