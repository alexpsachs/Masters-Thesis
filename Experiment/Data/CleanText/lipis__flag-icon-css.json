    "lipis": "Assets are used only for the demo, not needed if you want to use them in your project.. while the css is needed if you don't want to mess with less.. that's the idea to have them separate..\n. Thank for spotting that out.. I also posted an issue to the original projects with the flags and I'll fix this one once I'm back from vacations..!\nhttps://github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection/issues/36\n. So I reverted to the original flags without reducing the sizes using the https://github.com/svg/svgo because it was breaking a lot of flags :(\nIf someones knows how to make them smaller (and more consistent) it would be nice.. :)\n. Hey I added the main endpoint but removed the version completely as it's not really needed..\n. There is no England in this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes\n. Actually you can already.. I just never updated the README file.. just do:\nbash\nbower install flag-icon-css\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/bower.json\n. Thanks for the feedback, but for the actual SVG files and their proportions.. please refer to the original projects of the flags: https://github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection/issues and if it will be fixed there, then I will update them.\n. For the web most of the times you kind of want to have the same aspect ratio for all images for consistency.. and sometimes you need it as a square so I don't see a real problem.. and as for a wrong collection.. do you have anything alternative in mind?!\n. Thanks for the feedback, but for the actual SVG files and their proportions.. please refer to the original projects of the flags: https://github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection/issues and if it will be fixed there, then I will update them.\n. This is a collection of flags.. and flags belong to countries.. not languages! You will have to make your own logic for that.. because like you already mentioned which should I choose for English.. the British or the American.. or the Australian?\n. Here is what you will find in this collection: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1\n. Sorry but this will not going to happen.. one example on how you could easily override some rules to match your needs: https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init-babel/blob/master/main/static/src/style/locale.less\n(I had similar problem, to display the languages in http://babel.gae-init.appspot.com)\n. cool!\n. It's a known thingy and you can solve that with different ways..\nYou can change also the background-size: contain; to background-size: cover; and it will try to fit the flag inside the box so instead of having double border sometimes it will just crop the flag.. \nOr instead of the border you could use the box-shadow property\ncss\nbox-shadow: 0 0 1px @gray-light, 0 0 1px @gray-light, 0 0 1px @gray-light;\nBut I'm leaving all that to the end user as it really depends on the project..\n. I'm getting lots of requests about that issue and the problem is that there is no official list of all the languages with their corresponding flag.. because simply flags are belonging to the countries..!\nWhy using the british flag for the english instead of the US... I'm pretty sure the americans would totally prefer that.. and we didn't ask the australians.. :) same for spanish and many others..\nSo officially I don't think that we could cover all the languages without upsetting someone.. but it's quite easy to make some updates to the .less file to match your needs and add whatever flag you want to your language. I myself also needed that for another project, so you can check the example on how it works: https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init-babel/blob/master/main/static/src/style/locale.less\n``` less\n.flag-icon(@country, @locale) {\n  .flag-icon-@{locale} {\n    background-image: ~\"url(@{flag-icon-css-path}/4x3/@{country}.svg)\";\n    &.flag-icon-squared {\n      background-image: ~\"url(@{flag-icon-css-path}/1x1/@{country}.svg)\";\n    }\n  }\n}\n.flag-icon(gb, en);\n.flag-icon(gr, el);\n.flag-icon(ar, es);\n```\nand then using .flag-icon-en with the gb flag :)\n. @Rvanlaak If you do the above override then you will be able to use the .flag-icon-en instead of the .flag-icon-gb which is also what I'm using in my other app when I use en for the locale and I want to use a flag for it..\n. I think with that nice link we can close this issue for one more time :)\nFlags are for countries.. how people are going to use them is another thing and the method I described above is very very simple..!\n. Never used it before so what do I have to do on my side? \nAny chance that you can simply use Bower for your front end stuff?!\n. hey.. totally forgot about that.. I will do something about it I the coming days..\n. @Rvanlaak Do you mind creating a PR with the valid composer.json for this app and then I will add it to Packagist..\n. So here you are!! https://packagist.org/packages/components/flag-icon-css\n. Let me know if it actually worked on your sides :)\n. nice.. I thought about it later.. but instead of component/.. I might\nrename it to lipis/.. or something, but either case it works :)\n. You are Irish so I guess you're right :)\n. I think we can just delete the version from here... it's not mandatory and it's always visible in releases..\n. package.json is ignored anyway in the bower.json.. and if you install it using bower the version is stored in the .bower.json in the bower_components\\flag-icon-css\nInstall anywhere using to test it..\nbower install flag-icon-css#0.5.0\n. From package.json but ok :)\n. Thanks and btw.. using Sublime's multiple selection you could do that much easier without a script..!\n. thanks.. could you also squash the commits before I'll merge that?\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/5201642/8418\n. And then I will just have to register it here: https://packagist.org/packages/components right?\n. Thanks man..! It's all there and I enabled the automatic update as well..\nhttps://packagist.org/packages/components/flag-icon-css\n. @N8boy is right.. I'm sorry but I won't add any user assigned flags..\n. @rolandjitsu In this particular project I'm including only the official flags.. it's very simple :)\nIf someone wants to include the user assigned it's super easy to fork and add them to match their individual needs..\n. It's been discussed before https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues/13#issuecomment-42109283\n. I'll keep that project strictly for countries for now.. and here is one modification if you have locales instead... https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init-babel/blob/master/main/static/src/style/locale.less\n. as it's not on the list.. I won't be adding any new flags.. sorry.. but feel free to fork and do whatever..\n. I think the problem was from the original project that all the flags were 4x3 or 1x1 ratio.. as this flag is not in 4x3 the original creator modified it a bit to make it fit.. yes it's wrong to modify the flags, but in the web sometimes we just want a small flag/icon to represent it.. as I can see in this one the colors are also different which should definitely updated.\nAnother idea to fix it maybe it would be to stretch the background to fit the 4x3.. WDYT?\n. Fixed in #69.. can you please check if it's ok?\n. Fixed in #69 \n. Sorry but I won't be adding any PNGs to this project.. \n. Nope.. as Europe is not a country and this project is dealing only with ISO_3166-1 initials/flags\n. Should be OK now:\n- https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/cn.svg\n- https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/cn.svg\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/commit/d88fa40dfa3bfde7df1b11a7257a7efbbbd2acc7\n. I think these flags were on purposely slightly changed to fit in the 4x3 aspect ratio.. as it was the whole point of the old (now deleted) project.. I wasn't maintaining the flags and I'm not sure what do with them now as this project is also for the web and I want unified sizes for all flags. (To use them in dropdowns, icons, etc..)\nI think we'll have to take them per case if about to change.. especially the Cocos (#38)\n. I have individual issues now.. so closing this one..\n. Yes unfortunately the link is dead now and I'm not sure what kind of license I have to give them as there were not made/modified by me.. \n. EU is not a country that is why\n. Fixed.. there are too many stars.. :P\nhttp://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/\n. Work on mine.. and if it works on Firefox but not on Chrome.. then most likely you did something wrong :/ Either case without extra info or a link.. it's impossible to reproduce or help..\n. Yes.. guys sorry.. it's already hard to maintain all those flags in two different formats and adding support for something that was last updated 3 years ago is really not worth it :)\n. If someone is force to supported IE8 then they will have to do it on their own..\n. The PNGs used to be generated in the original project, that unfortunately is no longer exist.. and from what I remember it required bunch of planets to be aligned in order for it to work properly.. plus bunch of options for sizes and ratio... so to tell you the truth I'm not willing to maintain that thingy :) having said that if there is a simple script I could possibly include it to generate stuff.. or at least point to where you can find a clone.. for now I will close this issue and if anyone wants to maintain a IE8 fork.. please do so and let me know so I can link to it in the readme.. \n. Me neither... thanks @martinlindhe \n. sorry for that..\n. I refactored a bit.. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/less/flag-icon-base.less\n. Would you mind squashing the commits?\n. Thanks you very nice!\n. there are quite a few known issues that are already there.. but unfortunately there is no much time :/ color fixes are super easy so if you find anything feel free to report it..\n. Not really sure about that.. as I believe noone should automatically compile all the less files..\n. Cool.. point taken :) I don't see any major issue of not going for it.. if you can rebase/squash your PR and also since we SASS now.. please update those as well..\n. Still around?!\n. will close this one..\n. thanks\n. everything is possible but I have no idea how WordPress works or what exactly you want to achieve.. this is just a bunch of collection of files.. :)\n. Because these flags are not on the list.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes\n. I guess it didn't stay long enough :)\n. If you use something like http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/ sure :)\n. In short.. this is by design.. as that was the whole point of the original project, as these flags are suppose to be used in lists, dropdowns, etc where flag area should be exactly the same, because there is a decision that has to be made on what to do with the potential empty space.. white? transparent? \nThese flags should not be used or intent to be the official official flags.. I hope it's OK.. \n.  I will keep this repo for the ISO 3166 list only.. it's not really hard to add more flags even if this repo is used via Bower \n. Also the color is off.. that was from the original project that they did some modifications as the main target was small icons and it made sense.. but maybe we'll have to reconsider..\n. Let's continue in #126 \n. Thanks!\n. there is no script and if you really need instructions on how to use the CSS.. then you might don't really need these flags :D\n. That is not that of a bad idea at all.. on vacations now.. but will do it once I'm back :) I'm guessing just a white background or something would be enough..\n. Fixed in #66 but I'm not sure if it will be merged after all..\n. did you read the readme?\n. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Wikipedia has a better overview \n. no sorry.. I won't be doing it.. there are some PRs if you want to use, but this project is not going to support anything else than SVGs..\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ie8\n. pull requests.. #42 #33 \n. I've done that in the past.. but unfortunately some of the flags are ruined because of that... \nhttps://github.com/svg/svgo/issues/162\n. Will follow up after I'm back from my vacations.. I'm totally up for SVGO if flags are not breaking.. or at least if we know for sure which ones are breaking.. (like 100% sure)\n. or somehow identifying which flags are breaking is also good for me\n. @petethepig lol.. so lets delete the US flag..\n. @petethepig This repo is used not only via CSS and this is a very small optimisation that I don't see any reason to modify..\n. Many flags were optmized.. and from now on it will happen on per flag basis..\n. You didn't find it.. because Europe is not a country :D #34\n. Maybe a better idea would be to clone this project to be able to have it in sync much easier with the new flags and stuff..\n. I meant.. fork so people could see how back/front it is.. but nothing to this project.. closing it as outdated for now.\n. Lets continue the issue #60 here\n. You can submit a PR for ba if its not breaking it..\n. Also we need to take it per case.. as the original creator has killed the project and I didn't find an automated way to use this viewBox in a unified way for the whole folder..\n. Missed that one..\n. Freaking Illustrator.. \nThe generated file is not visible in the GitHub's viewer: https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/lk/flags/4x3/lk.svg\nWhile this one is OK: https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/lk.svg\n. yep\n. I added a new label, so people could easily find those.. we'll see in the future if we'll include flags that are not part of the ISO-3166..\n. As I mentioned in some other issue.. I might start adding more flags than the official ISO ones.. just need to clean some things up first..\n. but but but but.. I like Less :D\n. https://www.npmjs.com/package/flag-icon-css everything should be ok now..\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues/26#issuecomment-47708813\n. You can also check this (undocumented) thingy: http://flag-icon-css.lip.is/api/v1/country/  you have all the data there.. so basically do whatever you want..  \n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/search?q=kosovo&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93\n. Nice!! Thanks guys..\n. Is it really needed?\n. sorry.. too much trouble\n. @ninjanye no.. sorry\n. @ninjanye yes.. @belikemike's version doesn't support 2-digit code :)\n. I appreciate the effort.. could you also include the links in the description to the currently used flags?! It will be much easier to search later and refer to them.\nHaving said that.. these flags have to be adjust to 4x3 and 1x1 ratios so it's not that easy :/\n. Because that's how it this whole repo is: https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/tree/master/flags\n. and the main problem is that the guy who created the original flags has shut down his project.. :( and I'm the master of SVGs :)\n. I wanted to say.. that I'm not the master of SVGs :)\n. Fixed in #98 \n. While I agree with the Less changes.. what's the point of having sass and less for the development?! If anyone wants to use it can get the css, less or scss version of and all good.\nSo generating the same css with 2 different ways is really no need..\n. Not very doable with SVGs.. (even though there is a plan to optimise them) so what you can do is to choose your preferable size and transform them into PNGs or something..\nP.S. There were requests to include the PNGs in this project.. but since there could be many different sizes.. they won't be included at all :)\n. I tried the svgo in the past, but it was ruining some flags.. never got the time to find see if it's breaking less these days..\n. easier said than done.. doing that to all files without ruining some of them..\n. Some of them are optimised... this is an ongoing process..\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/search?q=europe&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues?q=is%3Aissue+european+is%3Aclosed or you can simply check #71 \n. :100: \n. Must be outdated now.. I'll close that issue.. I hope it's OK :) \ud83c\udf7b . could you submit a pr?\n. Hey.. All good.. especially if you have somewhere a link to the original source code.. is even better.\n. Nice!\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+eu\n. will review it soon... thanks\n. More like all of them that you touched :D https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/pull/111#issuecomment-159642513\n. So I guess I'm closing this one..\n. Something is not right though..\n\n. Same issue on GitHub preview..\n- https://github.com/copycut/flag-icon-css/blob/add-view-box-attributes/flags/4x3/ad.svg\n- https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/ad.svg\n. I'm in general against anything that is not on the ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code list.. but maybe due to the popular demand I'll have to start adding more flags.. we'll see :)\n. So if we are about to do it.. I will need some help in terms of codes and what is what :) For someone that is not from GB it might be confusing.. so lets move this conversation to #120 \n. :)\n. While I appreciate the optimised/better flags if they are in the same format (viewBox: 512x512 and 640x480) I don't see any reason why including the sources and sketches or updating the minified css file..\n. maybe.. but definitely not part of this one..\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/commit/3cd183cb1729d26482080db9a60fb589ba383cfc\n. #71 or https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=eu+OR+europe\n. thanks :) I thought it was final..\n. Even though we could have more instructions.. but I think you might want to spend more time with HTML and CSS in general, before trying to use these flags.. not sure where people learn these days, but this one looks cool enough: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web\n. What codes should we use for all these flags? \n. @simonwielens, @Jokero are you guys fine with these flags?\n. that's one of the reasons that I didn't want to include extra flags for so long.. :/\n. Sounds like a good idea..\n. Should be fine now.. :)\n. Maybe I'll merge the #125 as well.. before publishing.. the most demanded flag so far :)\n. Published :) should appear soon in your nearest shop..\n. > :D You can run into a lot of troubles by just mention \"NIR is not a country and it does not have own official flag\"\nWhat kind of troubles?! It's a free world man.. we can say and do whatever we want.. (at least in this part of the world..)\n\nCould you add that flag to your files, please. I'm sure you won't get that many request for NIR.\n\nNope.. sorry.. maybe if I'll get too many requests I'll reconsider.. :)\n. Internet is a fun place..! Not sure why people are getting mad.. or think that I'm lazy or care so much for something that they didn't do or wanted to do anyway.. like I mentioned before @carlosdv4 we live in a free world and nobody is paying me for doing that.. so how can you even demand or assume that I'm lazy?! do you think that this project just appeared here?! wtf?\n@seanfoo Yes.. that was the whole point.. that I sticked only to the official CIA listed recognised countries  but eventually due to the large demand I added a few more in the #120.. and now the chaos!! I enjoy the ride anyway.. it's fun! Thanks for the support..\n. @jakwo  That's a good reason.. can you point me to one or two such websites..?!\n. @jakwo Sold! Will do :)\n. There :)\n. If you publish your app.. feel free to come back to us to show off ;)\n. duplicate #38\n. @SergioBarja Fixed the ratio and colors..\n@agorilla yes.. the size is quite big (147KB) so maybe it's not a bad idea to have the other variant of the flag..\n. http://www.spain-flag.eu/flag-variants.htm\nSpain has only one national flag and ensign, the one with coat-of-arms. Any merchant or fishing ship can fly the coat-of-arms version. Many don't, just because the cost of a flag with a colored coat-of-arms is much higher than one without it.\n. I'll keep it for now.. and we'll see later..\n. no sorry..\n. Couldn't agree more with @copycut..\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/commit/d3f57d3ec4293bf7b66a126ec4fbd24f79c8249b\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/commit/f31cd4f67bb0c4f6c3d33f266d1e7e2d3987689f\n. Quite the opposite.. they are more than welcome! :dancer: \n. Isn't that fixed? https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/commit/2c6ecf46c7ec962d8c53e071cb5563cbd363f319\n. will do today.. don't be that sorry.. it's not a big deal :) :dancers:\n. Cool stuff man! :) Thanks..\n. I'm not dealing with PNGs and the SVG sprite will be huge..\n. Good stuff!\nI would recommend you (if it's not too late) to make it a fork of this one though.. as I'm updating the flags quite often and then it will be much easier to check how far behind or merge/sync with the upstream easier..\n. We've been through this before.. and it's an ongoing process that is happening on per flag bases at the moment.. It was breaking a lot of flags when done in bulk..\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues/63\n. Because I guess the Brazilian flag wasn't ruined :) SVGO is more reliable since that time.. so maybe less flags are broken.. but still :)\n. @vltr The written text many times can be misunderstood.. But xenophobia is one of the last things that could characterise me :) Why do you think I insulted you in any way? (Plus I love Brazil)\n. @vltr LOL :) It's hard to notice if any of the flags are broken after an optimization.. especially if you don't know how the flags should be.. but we (humans) tend to notice familiar things.. and I (wrongly maybe) assumed that you are a Brazilian or at least know how the Brazilian flag looks like since it's written on your profile.. so if the SVGO would break it (like in ruining the XML of it) you would quickly notice it and you wouldn't suggest to optimize all the flags.. That's all I meant..\n(I'm still puzzled on how you got insulted.. but that's Internet I guess)\n. Fact: Some flags will be ruined if running the SVGO and ripping 2MB from all the flags..!\nFact: You assumed that everything will be OK with all the flags..\nFact: People tend to not like if their flag is ruined.. :)\nQuestion: Did you check any of the flags after running the SVGO?! If so.. which ones did you check?!\n. So you are not a Brazilian or you don't live in Brazil and calling you a Brazilian is an insult to humanity?\n. (Even though I didn't call you a Brazilian I just assumed that you will know how the Brazilian flag looks like)\n. You're a funny guy..\n. (I assume that you are a guy.. because of the Richard and it's most common for men population)\n. Please don't feel sorry.. I'm fine :) But I could also be insulted when someone is calling me xenophobic assuming that I am :) That's not very polite in my book...\n. You can still use the flags.. they are not mine :)\n. I won't tell anyone..\n. If these flags were my main job.. yes :) Otherwise reasonable PRs are always welcome..\n. Roger out..\n. thanks!. Should be much better now.. can't be 100% correct as all the flags are adjusted to 4x3 and 1x1\n. Knowing my self and my OCD levels.. Even if you're producing the flags the same way (Inkscape, SVGO, etc) I most likely going to redo it, save and optimise it (2 spaces) again.. so I would recommend you to not make PRs for flags.. at least now that I found how to make them all consistent..\n. Thanks man and I appreciate it.. I will add the contribution so in the future it can be avoided.. at the moment the greatest help is to find the mistakes in flags and report them.. \n. much appreciated.. but you don't really have to do this if you have other better things to do :) :flags: \n. Would you mind also linking in the issue to the flag in the repo for fast comparison?\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/sr.svg\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/sr.svg\n. I do accept them if they are actually OK. especially the colors are the easiest to accept.. but please keep a single PR per flag. If it's only color changes.. feel free to submit the PR as it's not changing the XML.\n. could you squash the commits? to have only one\n. That one as well... some squashing..\n. No you can do that in the same PR.. here is one way of doing that: https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-android/wiki/Squash-All-Commits-Related-to-a-Single-Issue-into-a-Single-Commit\n. I just want a single commit.. (it's quite common in many projects)..\n. indeed...\n. :dancer: \n. So basically all flags!! :godmode: \n(keep them coming)\n. Few left.. thanks for reporting them :)\n. @ilyabreev Down to 10 open wrong flags :) Not bad..\n. can you sqaush the commits please?\n. :elephant: \n. set the correct path I guess..\n. I guess everything should be ok.. :)\n. Why should I?! It's not needed for that particular CSS. What if someone wants something else or nothing?\n. sorry.. but no.. it's just reserved.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1\n. not very feasible.. too much to maintain and as it was mentioned earlier you can find them in wikipedia.. :) the purpose if this project is to have them somewhere that could align perfectly either in 4x3 or 1x1..\n. In case you didn't notice.. they are all adjusted.. not only the Swiss flag..\n. I'll pass on this one..\n. what's the best sources for the CT?\n. Then maybe we'll pass on this one as well :)\n. these were the proprtions of the original project that had only the stand alone flags without the CSS... because people were complaining a lot.. the original creator couldn't keep up and he deleted the project. I'm still replying and I'm not ready to delete this project.. and I'm also not ready, nor willing to update ALL the flags to any other proportions other than the ones that exist at the moment (mainly because it's an open source project and if someone else wants it sooooooooooo much.. feel free to fork it and make it happen)\n. I'm not emotional sorry for that :) It's the whole written text.. if I would tell you this info over the beer it would be different..\nThe other problem is that someone will have to manually change/adjust/etc ALL the files.. to match this proportions.. which is not easy :)\nJust check the history.. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/commits/master \nFor some flags is quite easy.. but some of them are quite complicated flags that we need to match them.\nAlso I would like to keep the SVGs consistent and clean as well.. so in reality the reasons that you don't see all these proportions.. is that I'm not getting paid to make flags :D:D But I love having consistent things..\n(Nothing emotional.. just business)\n. Thanks man! Feel free to post any time if you see some flags that are already not filed..\n. what would be the 2 character code.. any reliable source for the most favorable suggestion?\n.  pass on this one  until further notice :)\n. @mattab Thank you. That would be great :) I need to something in order to start adding more of those.. but I don't want people to start thinking that we will add all of them :) But for now I'll reopen this one... I might have to pass on this one.. adding more non ISO codes was already a big step to what's this project was about.. so adding aliases I don't see any good reason to be honest :) \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1\n. Sorry..\n. It's about countries not languages..\n. Even though many of the flags were already optimized using SVGO with the recent updates it's pretty safe to do it to all flags :)\n```\nBefore:  8.217.280 bytes\nAfter:   6.530.332 bytes\n\nDiff:    1.686.948 bytes\n```\n. Look closer.. :)\n. One of the most difficult ones to solve :). I just didn't manage to do it using Inkscape.. > if this project is list of flags, I'd prefer all flags in their original aspect ratio\n@mareg I would also prefer to have a world peace, but that's not the case :)\nThis project has 2 aspect ratios for all flags.. if you don't like it.. don't use it :). Done.. :) \n. \nThanks!\n. Try again: http://flag-icon-css.lip.is/game/capital/Oceania/\n. Here you can see all of them in a nice sortable table.. http://flag-icon-css.lip.is/country/ so if you find anything else wrong.. please let me know!\n. #215 How many countries?!\n. May I ask you why exactly do we need that or have both things generating the same result?\n. and how #101 is exactly associated with what you did here..?\n. I disagree that it's useful as it is just a matter of taste on how to build the actual css for this particular project.. but has nothing to do if you are actually want to use SASS in your own project.. because sass files are already there...\n. yes :) will update the readme later..\n. Updated readme..      \n. I'm guessing you haven't check how the whole thing is working.. :)\n. Sorry but flags belong to countries/areas.. not languages :)   \n. Also maintenance.. there are thousands of languages and I'm not sure how it will work with simple things.. on which flag to use for English.. US, GB, AU? So in the end of the day.. that's why you have all the sources to adjust those things to your personal needs.. \n. @serhioV Since you are not so stupid.. do you understand that this requirement that you have for your own projects/clients, maybe it's not going to work for everyone, so there is no point of asking for any sort of implementation here... true.. but every website uses their own flags for whatever language they want depending which country their represent.. so there is no way to satisfy everyone by having the UK flag for English or PT for Portuguese, etc.. . Do you have link to wikipedia and the possible ISO code for it with sources?   \n. #120 \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Northern_Ireland\n. Hi.. please update all your requests with links to Wikipedia pages for the flags.. and your best source for potential ISO codes for them..\nheads up: this list is quite strict \n. fixed #120 \n. #120 https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-sct.svg\n. Both are former countries and don't exist in that form anymore.. so I'll pass on this one.    \n. I'll pass for now.. sorry\n. Maybe using <img src=\"flags/1x1/de.svg\"> instead of <image href=\"...\"> will improve dramatically your chances of making it work..\n\n. > The SVG Image Element (<image>) allows a raster image to be included in an SVG document.\nBut this library here doesn't provide any raster images... so I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve..\n. which version of IE?\n. how does it look if you go directly\n1. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/af.svg\n2. https://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/flags/4x3/af.svg\n. Don't we all love the good old IE?\n. of course CSS can help.. but the problem is in how the IE renders the SVG.. I'm using the SVGO to optimize them all and it seems that something might be needed for older IEs to figure out the actual size/ratio of the image.. not sure if it's worth fixing it..\n. Thanks @ksymeon! \n@sarathak I will close that issue then as it looks like in the latest IE/Edge they are OK..\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/commit/ba44a8a974ff4b0d9c4815c51f30b57cdfb6e26a\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-nir.svg\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/gb-nir.svg\n. I'll show the extra flags on the main page and maybe in the instructions.. as they are more than just UK I don't want to be specific for UK stuff as it is in this PR :)\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-eng.svg\n. it's ok. no worries about the issues.. it reminds me that I have to update the front page! thanks..\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-sct.svg\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-wls.svg\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-nir.svg\n(I'll include them in the demo though eventually)\n. It's easier to maintain, sort, add, remove, check, etc...\n. Also multi-cursor is your friend..\n. So what do you think about this idea after the answer?\n. I'll pass on this one..\n. #501 . what do you mean by Android support?! get the flags and do whatever...\n. No sorry..\n\nOn 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved into Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Maarten and the three public bodies of the Caribbean Netherlands.\n. thanks for the effort.. but I'll fold on that one\n. 1. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/pf.svg\n2. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/tw.svg\n3. and as for Kosovo there have been many filed issues for it..\n\nnext time one flag/country/issue per issue...\n. Dear @ankit007pandit,\nThank you so much for reporting this issue... and on top of that sending me a personal email to make sure that I will read in. I'm totally on it. I can see that you need it very badly for your project, so I'm dropping everything as we speak and I'll start following up and adding more of your needed flags. Are you sure you want only those?! Maybe some help with other parts of your project..? If the deadline is near, don't hesitate to ask us anything and we'll be at your help.. as soon as possible (as you wanted and you asked)..!! Stay put.. \n\n@tomlutzenberger You didn't have to.. :)\n. @seanfoo @tomlutzenberger It took me a while to add few non ISO flags but I'm not planning in any way to include all of them at this point.. adding them means maintenance and that wasn't the goal of this project.. and definitely there is no plan to have a historical archive.. that's what Wikipedia is for..\nAs for you @ankit007pandit my dear friend.. sure! I'll prepare the flags and send them to you directly.. worry not! Like I said before I have nothing else to do so it won't be an issue and you could totally deliver it on time over the weekend! I can also send them to you in a printed version if you like..\n. @ankit007pandit sure.. no problem!\n. Oh noooo!! I'm right on it.. I'll be away for a while buying all the systems with high contrast mode, but afterwards I'll fix all of them as soon as I can... When is your deadline?! How much time do I have to fix the flags?!\n. I'm already fixing it.. :P\n. @Rak- No problem man.. I'll make all flags black and white only for you by 25th of this month.. anything else?! Maybe you also need some help with other parts of the project like in this issue #262.. \n. @Rak- Jokes aside.. nobody will do anything! There is no point of having black/white flags.. if you really need it.. good luck!\n. It is maintained.. but we are not adding ALLLLL the flags of this planet.. :D Is Catalonia is represented in Olympic gameS?\n. There were strong(er) arguments for those flags.. if these flags are going to participate in some sort of big sporting or other events.. I'll reconsider many of them :) but Oliver this project is not going to include the planet..\n. Not the biggest fan of the variables either.. too much optmization I would say :) if there is such need in the project just override this function or clone and remove the not used flags..\nUsually I'm just including the flags that I'm using only, but never thought of this extra step..\nFood for thoughts :)\n. I will :)\n. can you pass the SVGs with svgo --pretty --indent=2 path/to/svg \nand I'll have to make sure the colors are accurate.. my main source was (and still is) Wikipedia..\n. please keep the PRs to one per country/flag..\n. Spot the difference :D\n\n(Just update the colors.. since colors is the issue)\n. I'll merge it after those comments.. but next time two separate PRs :)\n. thank you \n. Sorry.. I'll pass on this one.. Awesome! :) Thanks for the detailed analysis of the flags that didn't make it. I updated your comment to include the links for faster check.\n. Also after a quick check it looks very legit.. so I'm going to merge it :)\n. I normalized most of the flags to according to the new rules that I just made up :) and your awesome list lives in #277..\n. after vacations I'll update a few thinga.. thanks\n. 2.4.0 is out https://www.npmjs.com/package/flag-icon-css\n. yep.. this is outdated. #277 \n. #277 \n. #277 \n. Thanks @diagramatics :)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Zealand#/media/File:Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/nz.svg\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/nz.svg\n. Sorry I'll pass on adding quotes :)\n. This looks quite nice to be honest.. :) could you use SVGO to optimize them:\nsvgo --pretty --indent=2 /path/to/fj.svg\n. Thank you lion :)\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/tree/master/flags/4x3 I'll add the extra flags in the main website at one point.. but for now you can find them there..\n\n. No problem! :) It's not that obvious..\n. \ud83d\udcb6 :D\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Catalonia\n. Bunch of flags broke :(\n. I think it would be better that way ;) Less is working in a similar way..\n``` sass\n.flag-icon-background {\n  background-size: contain;\n  background-position: 50%;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n.flag-icon {\n  @extend .flag-icon-background;\n  position: relative;\n  display: inline-block;\n  ...\n}\n``\n. Just update your pr..\n. thanks\n. damn... wrong button :) wanted to squash.. oh well..\n. Haven't played with Webpack but can we add the [stylesheets files](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/bower.json#L3-L6) like in Bower? Because this project is not a JS project to add anindex.js`\n. While you might be right about Cyprus.. Geographically speaking most part of Turkey is in Asia (97%) and same for Russia..\nNow since when Greece belongs to Asia or Kazakhstan to Europe.. that's something that I can't really comment or answer.. check the map again :)\nI was about to update the website with some changes.. could add multiple continents for some countries.. \n. #277\n. do you think that all the flags were just stretched to fit the 1x1?. Can you check if they are better now?!\n. @cnsgithub that is very strange.. because there are no references to xlink or href or anything in those files:\n- https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/bo.svg\n- https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/bo.svg\n. Well not sure what to do.. if you find a solution to the \"problem\" let us know.. until then it looks good from my side..\n. @hulufei Published 2.8.0 :)\n. #277 and more\n. I'll squash it .. but you should update your local branch :)\n. No sorry.. I'm still thinking about whether to add or not some of the currently used, non ISO flags.. so for sure I will pass adding historical ones :)\n(Even though I have a special connection to Soviet Union, as I was born there.. hehe)\n. #277 \n. What about the folder name?! I'm always confused with Sass and their conventions..\n. SJ is part of ISO 3166-1 so I won't remove it.. but I'll update the flag :)\n. np... :D\n. You should have asked before actually doing it.. but that's definitely not the way.. I might add it in the future ass Less and Sass but not like that.. sorry..\n. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/eu.svg my bad that is not easily shown.. but it's there..\n. What we can do for that?!\n. It's in my plans for x-mass to reduce the size and other updates! stay tuned... #395. Is there anything we can do with some of the SVGO settings https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/svgo.yaml to reduce the size/complexity of the vectors?!\nUsing the civil flags will of course reduce the size, but I would like to keep the original ones :). #436 saved 13% more :). #437 even more.. :) 1.8MB. I'll close this one for now because of #437, and if anyone wants to simplify manually some big flags I'm open for review... It's already too complicated to maintain 2 formats.. :)\n. More cool stuff..\nNext time though in the brackets write (Fixes #282) so the issue will be closed automatically :)\n. more cool stuff\n. Cool stuff :)\n. I tried once.. but failed miserably.. :)\n. http://flag-icon-css.lip.is/api/v1/country/\n. Maybe in the future.. :/\n. I'll close it for now..\n. thanks.. fixed!\n. In some use cases it might make sense.. I'll give it a try to see the results and if it's not ruining the quality too much I might use it for the big flags..\nIn general I'm using the SVGO before pushing the flags..\n. Also I've seen this tool in the past.. and there is no command line for it if I recall.. right? Maybe that changed..?\n. right..\n. sorry... optimization was the only reason.. :) Some browsers from a previous century you mean?\n. will do :). I think this request is a bit tooooo much :) . Maybe :). Do you mind providing a PR.. or I can do it later this week. Thank you!! Sorry for taking a bit longer... and I'm guessing that's the way :). no.. :/. I had issues fixing those flags.. same for gb :(. mostly because the shape is a bit weird and I couldn't easily adjust it to the 4x3 without ruining too much the flag.. (speaking about gb). awesome.. do you mind running this command on both files?\nbash\nsvgo --pretty --indent=2 ba.svg. Delay?! Nobody is in a rush here :) hehe.. thank you very nice... dunno.. do you mind sharing a link or something because it works here: http://flag-icon-css.lip.is. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/eu.svg\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/eu.svg\nit's there but not documented... Sorry but I won't be accepting new flags for now especially bunch of them at the same time... No.. sorry... Works fine here.. which browser?! Just ping here and we can reopen this issue. Thanks... I'll try to find some time for this project.. it totally deserves it :). I'm sorry but I can't accept this.. but I fixed it already in #352. They look ok on Ubuntu 16.10\n\n. Is that still an issue?. Usually you would use a few of those flags and if actually you need all of them in one page.. I think anyone can use a sprite or something to cover their needs. This repo will have them separately.. sorry for that.. well I would recommend you to create a simple script that combines the ones that you want.. the total size would still include Serbia... bg. :). There are thousands of flags in general.. we simply can't get them ALL in one project.. :). fixed in #374 . I might start adding more flags.. but I can't accept this PR.. the stripes don't have the same height.. and due to my OCD I might have to make it myself :). The size is the OK.. is the content that I'm worried :) \n\n. fixed in #374 . Beer?. @arcanedev-maroc :) Nice one.. didn't know about it.. I thought this post was random questions :trollface: :D. But why adding more stuff when it's already very visible on top?\n\n\n. Sorry.. but I feel it's not worth it! I believe that everything is there and very clearly.. Thank you!. Why would you do that?! Because according to the docs this is about flags.. not languages! :)\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css#usage. Anything else you need to change to match your needs?!. Awesome.. any time you need anything.. just come here and do whatever you want!. Works here: https://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/flags/4x3/ua.svg. also try from different browser.. What do you mean?! If you just open that SVG in your browser does it work?! If the answer is yes.. then the problem is not in the svg.. but the way you use it... No I can't sorry.. the SVG is correct and the last two lines are added by your setup.. remove those lines and it will be fixed!. Pity?! How do you think we should help you exactly?! Should we start using Laravel, try to guess your full setup? try to guess your browsers, your machine and all your pipeline to figure out what is wrong with the rendering of SVG that actually is correct?!. np.. and good luck. . @The-Outrider do we have to update anything in the project, or it's just how people are using with different packages/frameworks?. Thanks @The-Outrider . As there is no a general rule I will close this issue... In the beginning I was only including the ISO 3166, but there were strong arguments (World Cup, Euro Cup, etc) for including some more flags.. . the SVGs are broken... Interesting... Does that makes sense now?. Something like this: http://flag-icon-css.lip.is/api/v1/country/?. anyone can create a PR.. you don't have to be part of the team for that... Thanks @rlenders :) \ud83c\udf7b . sorry no... nah.. sorry. Fixed. Thanks \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec. Good stuff!. Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore :)\n(source: I was born there). can you also change the other file as well in 1x1?. Thanks! \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 . I will add the task at one point.. #395 and I will experiment locally to see if I'll update all the sources.. but for now I'll close this one.. sorry.. too many edits! :). #393. Nope.. sorry.. . what about Australian or Singaporean? they also speak English... and combine 20 flags that their main language is english?. As we've said that many times in the past.. flags belong to countries and not to languages.. :). :D . This is actually quite interesting.. :). and there is no breaking change here.. right?. fixed. Interesting.. just to make it more unique though for possible conflicts.. shall we maybe switch to flag-icon-css-xx. Looks good to me :). Thanks @SaphuA \ud83c\udf7b . But: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Croatia#Colors. I will agree with @Findus23, let's have them here as official as possible :). Nah.. most them already optimized using SVGO but, I want them with --pretty --indent=2. One day I'll implement the #395 so it will be easy to adjust for anyone... the main reason that I have it like that is for easier view/fix here in the repo when submitting minor PRs, color changes etc.. and in general it saves 250kb in almost 7MB of total data if you are using the whole thing.. so overall you are saving around 3% which is not the worst case scenario.. and usually as you already mentioned you are not loading everything.. that's awesome.. thanks man for the link.  :). I'm sorry but I won't accept that one... Will be there soon.. thanks!. do you mind opening a PR for it?. I will close it for now then... Can you give an example in https://jsbin.com (or anywhere else) with your issue?. Works for me.. do you see anything here http://flag-icon-css.lip.is?. sure.. but this project has a different purpose :). are you using the squared version?. and instead of flag-icon you can use the flag-icon-background and flag-icon-squared but maybe some overrides need to be done.. haven't played with squared background ones :). Yes send more \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb4\ud83d\udcb8 to continue.. :). Sorry maestro.. :/. oups.. thanks . We are up and running! thanks again @johndierks . Thanks @minidoc.. works now  :) it's this time of the year again!\n. Thank you Peteris :). Can you have the minimum number of dependencies that are causing this error?. so I guess we can close this issue?. Not sure what we can do here.. seems fine from my end :). Oups.. removed IDs accidentally. Of course I'm interested.. thank you very much for this.. I'm on mobile now, but can you tell me if anything is broken.. and if we need to manually fix any of those flags?. Awesome... Thanks again!!. sure do you also need any other ratio?. The f*ck is this?. I think I'm going with this one :). @Findus23 thank you for that! Yes, that's quite expected, but hopefully nothing major was broken..!. While I don't have it in the repo.. you can take it from the http://flag-icon-css.lip.is/api/v1/country/?limit=-1\nBut keep in mind that we have more .svg that the displayed flags there :). Country is missing as well :). @2009 Thanks cat :). I kind of agree to use white for Polish flag..! I'm down.. any other objections..?. Can you file an issue for it? Because this PR seems a bit wrong :). As it's hard to know which one should be the default flag.. I'll close this issue.. They are there: https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/tree/master/flags/4x3\nBut not listed :(\n\n. We've been here before.. and I think I'll fold on this one :). Good stuff!. I'll trust you on this one :). Sk\u00e5l \ud83c\udf7b :). @kent1D Feel free to edit the colors?!. because there are no transparent flags.. :). aaa now I saw the flag.. hmm. nah.. it's hard to maintain the ones that we have.. there are no plans to introduce historical ones.. Plus what is URRS? Do you mean USSR?. how do you feel about making a PR? and many a link to confirm it.. on mobile right now :). So what do we do guys?! I like this one with Pantone definition #d52b1e (and the one that Wikipedia is using) over the #ff0000... So.. which one should be?. So going with #ff0000?. @dependabot rebase. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/ad.svg\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/ad.svg. viewBox is back... \ud83c\udf66. @dependabot rebase. @dependabot rebase. Thanks man! . Feel free to use it.. and if you make a few gazillions I wouldn't mind getting my share :). We could fix the colors but it will be tricky to shrink the Navy rectangle... Well all the flags here are either 4x3 and 1x1.. what do you mean replace it?. How do you feel about editing the files with these colors and submitting a pull request?. Check under Montenegro and Serbia.. http://flag-icon-css.lip.is . We only support iso flags with a few exceptions that are mostly for sport events... Remove the adblocker?!. https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-eng.svg. This projects was created to have 1x1 and 4x3 flags only for a particular purpose.. If someone wants the original ones.. there are plenty of sources... So which one should we use?. #474. I updated the colors.. if it's not the correct one please comment here.. hmm... what did you do? how are you using it?. There is no official globe flag or anything like that.. this project was and still is about the current Country flags :). Regardless of what you are using.. the flags are under flags and depends on which Style you want.. you will find the css, less, or scss under the respected folders... Done. Sorry... Not sure if it's worth it for this project.. as this sprite will be quite huge... #487. @dependabot rebase. Indeed unlikely :). This is Sierra Leone :) Slovenian code is SI :). I have no idea what you are talking about... :). If you are up for writing that script I'll be happy to accept a PR.. as long as it's just a script and not the actual assets... awesome. Just in case you have nothing to do @Blackjacx on your holidays.. :). @Blackjacx no rush! :). can you be more specific on what you need and how can we help?. works from here https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/es.svg. integrate what? where? language? platform? what do you mean? it's just a collection of flags with their code in the filename.. use them as you wish :). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#User-assigned_code_elements\nThe code XK is being used by the European Commission,[20] the IMF, and SWIFT,[21] CLDR and other organizations as a temporary country code for Kosovo.[22]\nOK.. you win! I'll add it... @pkrstic You are right! But I was getting a lot of request and in the end I ended up adding it... I'm not offended at all.. and I don't want to go into politics.. so case closed :). will do it tomorrow.. . So is this one ready? Bulletproof and all?!. Good enough... if you ever going to feel the need to improve it! Don't be shy... 3.3.0 is released.. can you verify if it's all good?. Yes, we've been through the language topic a lot.. and I still believe that it's outside of the scope of this project. This project is about flags.. country flags!. I'm open to PRs with suggestions @aerovistae!. it really depends on how your project is setup.. webpack gulp manual etc.. it could be anything. you just have to get the CSS and the icons included in your app :) . Do you see the flags when you deploy the app? Then it's good.. . Not sure how to help here.. sorry!. yes it should!. I'm sorry but we simply can add them all... https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/package.json#L40. I'll close that without any comment.. :). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1. @lycwed you are confusing languages with countries.. They are SVGs.. which means they can be any size you want! :)\nhttps://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/flags/4x3/es.svg. 3.3.0 released.. https://www.npmjs.com/package/flag-icon-css. I think this is issue should be on https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs side instead.. I have nothing to do with it :). I'm sorry but adding you as an author doesn't make much sense as you actually din't author anything in the actual project files and the list of the contributors is clearly shown here: https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/graphs/contributors\n. I would also add the less/** as someone might want to use the source files instead\n. can you keep the same number of lines to have it one to one.. it will be easier for the conversations later.. and if @mixin flag-icon-background has to be first.. then change the order in the less file as well.. but either case I want them to have the same in terms of lines :)\n. add the end of line :)\n. lower case colors..\n. is it possible to remove the xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"?. here as well. can you do it lower case?. can you do it lower case.. and next time would be nice to have them in one PR... The blue part is taking a quarter of the area (half of the width and half of the height) in the original one.. can we keep this ratio?. Sorry for being picky.. but can you make the blue area to occupy here again a quarter of the whole area?

I've been looking into the 'components' repository over here at Github, which all are available via Packagist. \nBut, as can be seen in the FontAwesome repo, they still have to update manually. The easiest way is to add a composer.json to your own project and add it to Packagist.org. \nNice article about this can be found here:\nhttp://tech.arendjantetteroo.nl/blog/2013/11/06/switching-from-bower-to-composer-with-components/\n.

All code will be added to the /vendor folder, where it should be in the /web folder.\nA possible solution would be to let composer install assets via an extra plugin.

I sense a bit of xenophobia in your comment, but stay cool, I looked at least 10 flags, including Spain, \"gb-wls\", South Africa, Mexico and others. I really feel sorry for your comment.\n. Thanks @ilyabreev, that's a more constructive idea, but, as the course of this issue goes, it's better for me to unstar the project, use a gif / png version I already have and wave good luck for a project that's in a social network with a xenophobic author. That doesn't seems right.\n. @ilyabreev I'm relaxed :)\n@lipis You insulted me by making assumptions, either I'm brazilian or not. If you chose the brazilian flag as an example of success of SVGO, directly, it's probably because this happened before. I repeat, PROBABLY. In any case: a very unfortunate example to give.\n. @lipis The insult is in your own words:\n\n.. and I (wrongly maybe) assumed that you are a Brazilian or at least know how the Brazilian flag looks like since it's written on your profile..\n\nDo you always makes this assumption, that all people will look only their flag and absolutely forget that this project have all flags?\n. Agreed about all facts. And, about your question, the answer is in the third comment after you closed this issue. Perhaps if you named another flag, this could have passed in blank, I'll not deny that because I'm no hypocrite. But, in a second thought, the behavior itself it's wrong. It's valid to anyone.\n. No, you didn't understand a bit what I'm talking about. You simply presume that someone will only look at the flag of his country (and not the rest) based on his profile. That's the bottom line.\n. I'm just polite and dislike controversial assumptions of any kind, specially from the author of a project I was keen to use (and help). I just feel sorry for you.\n. We're settled then :) Cheers!\n. But the project is and the course taken was not pleasant, unfortunately.\n. Neither I. But here's something for the future releases: unit tests, based on high-res flags (originals) and renders of the SVG flags on PhantomJS (or any other engine), with pixel subtraction and a bias level of acceptance (since not every anti-aliasing algorythm is equal, IMHO).\n.

On the other hand it is also reasonable to only include currently official and acknowledged flags.\nBut it's @lipis' turn to decide wether he wants to maintain a flag collection that represents the current situation or a historical flag archive.\n. I seriously wonder how this is even supposed to work...\nHigh contrast modes are always associated with color reduction.\n@Rak- How about a screenshot or something?\nYou can't just drop a line with almost no information and expect that it get fixed.\n. I doubt that \"fixing\" this is possible. Because there is nothing to fix.\nHigh contrast mode means color reduction.\nAfter enabling, in most cases 2-4 colors are left to display.\nNo colors = no flags.\n. What if the opposite is the case and someone only needs the square flags?\nThen he/she faces the same problem.\n. This would be a solution, I thought of that.\nBut I'm not really a fan of string comparison/checking like if (var == \"something\") doThat().\nNot sure. Let's wait for @lipis' reply and see what he thinks of it.\n. I'm not sure if this would compile correctly, because of the usage of variables inside the quotes.\n.

This could also be realised by using CSS.\n. You might consider replacing it entirely.\nThere are a lot differences to the original flag.\n. Why not copy the wikipedia flags and scale/crop them?\n. @matteocng You could call the API via AJAX and store the data.\n. Can confirm.\n. @notcmoore  Maybe file reading permissions on the server?. Based on @Findus23 idea I'd suggest to move all non-official flags to a separate project to keep this on small and clean. Most people will only need the official flags.. @inoas https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/LICENSE. Because it's necessary. @lipis mentioned about a thousand times, that he will only include official flags of countries which are in ISO 3166-1-alpha-2.\nOtherwise people will come up with some flag only he/she might need once in a lifetime and the project will end with a million flags including every karate club flag in south-east-asia and every.\nThat would be ridiculous.. Like a JSON file?. Please see #13 and #236 . I'd suggest fork+extend OR overwrite in your own CSS file.. I recommend to look at Ionic's documentation first:\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/third-party-libs/\nGoogle \"use css library with ionic 3\" => 2. result. @Elfayer Did you take a look at Wikipedia's SVG as well? There is a different color value than #f00 (=> #de2910). Also, if you google for \"Pantone 186\" you get a differing value (#c8102e), too.\nPretty confusing.... > \"For the Federal Identity Program, the red tone of the standard flag has an RGB value of 255\u20130\u20130 (web hexadecimal #FF0000).\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Canada. I'd argue that using pantone is kinda useless on the web... \ud83e\udd14 . I'd say RGB. @Dinfyru This would mean to rename everything and as a result it would break everybody's code on upgrade. Bad idea.\nYou should disable your adblocker or reconfigure it to exclude the flag.. Kurdistan is not an official country nor does it have an ISO-3166 country code. Therefore I doubt that there is any chance it will be included.. @ejdzipi If you browse through some of the older issues, you'll see that there have been a lot of requests for extra flags.

Flags are political. There will be some (such as okzhu above) who object to the idea of depicting the Tibetan flag as it is considered (by the Chinese Communist Party) representative of the Tibetan Freedom movement.\nHowever, the Tibetan flag serves many purposes - it's very much a symbol that represents the Tibetan culture and community both within and outside Tibet - without any furtherance of a political agenda.  Needless to say, as the current government of China has decided to denigrate the Tibetan flag, they would not consider it as representative of the Tibetan Autonomous Region as marked by the region code CN-54.\nAm I personally in favour of adding the Tibetan flag? Definitely so. Will you get stick from China if you do?  Most likely.. I would like to add that as soon as you added Northern Ireland, you extended the set to include regional flags. The official flag for Northern Ireland is the Union Flag, (popularly known as the Union Jack) which is the same as the GB flag.

This project is great but the number of open issues and the velocity makes me reluctant to use it. For my current needs, I can live without SVG (and even just having 16x16 png); but it'd be great to see the issues (at least the wrong and missing flag ones resolved ASAP). \nI can pitch in a bit, my illustrator/svg skills are beginner level at best but I think that might suffice. \n(I tried doing that with Font Awesome and later found out that icon contributions were off limits, so if something like that is not an factor here, I can help).. I fiddled a bit and I see your point now... :disappointed: . Although, one could argue that this is inevitable (making square flags out of rectanglular ones) . \nIt's the same problem video editors have, trying to fit widescreen formats scale to 4:3 or other formats - they solve it using blackboxes or crops. Crops lead to data loss but is the better option here (rather than having blackboxes in this case).\nSo, not an issue then? :smile: . @mareg like @lipis said, this is probably not the right project for you. I found this: https://github.com/hjnilsson/country-flags which seems to have the flags in their native aspect ratio which might be a better fit for you. . ",
    "mareg": "Every flag has its aspect ratio defined - I would like to see all flags by default in their original aspect ratios. E.g. Switzerland's flag is 1x1, so displaying it in 4x3 is incorrect (and some may find it disrespectful).. @Findus23 but that would mean a manual work for every project - if this project is list of flags, I'd prefer all flags in their original aspect ratio - then using css it's easy to place them inside square/circle/rectangle and fit/zoom/stretch/what not - for a particular use. Or if user users mostly are looking for 1x1 and/or 4x3 ratio, then have three sizes: original, 1x1, 4x3.. ",
    "Findus23": "@mareg The issue is that nearly every single flag has a different aspect ratio which makes it hard to use them as an icon:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aspect_ratios_of_national_flags\nIf you need the \"original\" flags, you don't need this project, but could instead directly use the SVGs from above Wikipedia entry.. @serhioV\nI agree with, @lipis that there is no general mapping from languages to flags. But this doesn't mean that there couldn't be a mapping for a single project (e.g. because all of your German speaking users are coming from Germany and you don't make business with Austrians)\nThis mapping is specific to your use case and therefore should be build in your program. Just write a function that takes the language you want to display and outputs the classname of the flag. . Another Idea would be creating two collections. One strict collection, which only includes flags from acknowledged states and a second one with all other types of flags.\nThis way everyone can get the flags they want for their project.. https://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/flags/4x3/ua.svg returns \n```svg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n``\nfor me. Have you got any browser extension which modifies the response?. Maybe open the local svg file in the node_modules folder and check if it has a duplicate`. The next step would be checking the http request in the developer tools. If you click on the request, you can see its content:\n\n. Check in \"Response\" if the duplicate </svg> is also there. If you want to you can use this icon, which we are using in piwik:\nhttps://github.com/piwik/piwik-icons/blob/master/unk.flag.svg\nThere is also an alternative (more flag-like) version: https://github.com/piwik/piwik-icons/blob/9487be120d11bc59dc5f763eb0084e0ee6cc772d/unk.flag.svg. I don\u2019t thinks it\u2019s a good idea to modify all colours just for one use case. Especially when they are officially specified. \nHow those colours are displayed isn\u2019t the job of the svg file. . Just for your information:\nOnly a handful flags changed visually because of this change and we are only speaking about a few pixels that aren't visible at 64px size.\nSee https://github.com/piwik/piwik-icons/commit/d4d8bf63b7831db7258a60830cd89dd49ea9d126. If we can trust this Wikipedia list, then the only standard is that nearly every flag has a different aspect ratio\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aspect_ratios_of_national_flags\n2:3 seems to be pretty common, but there are even countries with irrational aspect ratios. . But when you are using non-square flags and forcing them to be square via CSS there is no other way than adding spacing at the top. \nTo have a aspect ratio of 4:3 you'll need to use a height of 63.75px.. In case you are interested, the visual differences are really minimal (left is the new one).\nAll other stayed byte-identical with a 64x48 pixel png.\npe:\n\nlv:\n\nva:\n\n. Nothing needs to be changed, without the imagemagick compare tools I wouldn't be able to see a difference.. This time nearly all files have been changed visually. \nBut I didn't see any change that I'd consider wrong.\nIf someone wants to check them:\nhttps://lw1.at/diffs/index.html. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Poland_(normative).svg\nmentions that the slightly greyish flag is the normative one.\nI think the current is correct (at least according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Poland#National_colors). See also #381 and #332\nIf you want to you can use this icon, which we are using in Matomo:\nhttps://github.com/piwik/piwik-icons/blob/master/unk.flag.svg\nThere is also an alternative (more flag-like) version: https://github.com/piwik/piwik-icons/blob/9487be120d11bc59dc5f763eb0084e0ee6cc772d/unk.flag.svg. But just to keep in mind using the Pantone definition results in another color:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Canada_(Pantone).svg. It looks like https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg cropped on the right side (to fit 4x3) and with slightly different colours.. Have you seen\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/1x1/gb-sct.svg\nand \nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/gb-sct.svg\n?. @lazysergey \nI'd recommend you to setup HTTP 2.0 which makes the overhead of all those requests a bit less dramatic.\nAnd keep in mind that putting all SVGs as base64 would mean that the browser have to wait with the css rendering until 3MB css have been loaded (even more as bas64 is larger than binary).. One more thing: If the flags are shown really small (~20px) you could do something similar to what I am doing in Matomo: Convert the SVGs to optimized PNGs (with 3x resolution for high-res displays). \nAs flags compress incredibly well the files will have about 180 bytes(!) each with 64x48 px and maybe they will load and render faster in the browser.. > This doesn't have any side effects, so it's safe to be merged.\nI have to disagree. SVGs without newlines become hard to maintain if they are complex. In addition git tools like blame and diffs stop working properly if all changes happen in the same line.\nAnd while I haven't tested it, the size reduction of the gzip'ed files would be far more useful and I think it will be very close to zero because newlines compress well.. Like this one?\nhttps://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css/blob/master/flags/4x3/kr.svg\n(Took me a while to find out that kr is the country code of South Korea). ",

    "scottkellum": "The point structure here looks like it\u2019s unsuitable for production use. It could be that in expanding a stroke a design program added a huge number of extra points that are unnecessary. Vector art should have one point per every 90\u00b0 turn in the path on a curve. Occluded points don\u2019t need to be curved. Simply by having a clean source file you can probably cut 90% of the file size and on paths this bad adjusting precision might even make things worse because the points are so close together the paths are prone to become lumpy as they are placed on a more coarse grid but test this last point instead of taking my word for it as you want precision as coarse as possible without visual regression.\nIf you can find cleaner source files of flags like these you\u2019ll find significantly smaller file sizes. As a designer this looks like a bad source SVG and I wouldn\u2019t want to send it into production looking like that no matter how good the SVG optimization engine is.. @ritcheyer There is only so much you can do with a tool and the tools listed above in the thread are fantastic. Think of this like a book with a lot of repeated stuff, you could have a computer try to parse it down but what you clip out and the order in which you clip it out might change the meaning so this task is very hard for a computer to do well.

It is true that I am quite new to node, but nevertheless people like me also should know how to use it. So generally I have all my scss/css files in the \"public/\" folder, which is how it is supposed to be, but after installing flag-icon-css nothing appears there. That is what probably also confused @julianeden. We both looked into \"node_modules/flag-icon-css/\", but those files should probably not be used for the website content I guess because just all files in \"public/\" are supposed to be visible by the user (via source code look-up). So what is the correct way of including the css/scss in a node application after installing the package?. I just figured out a way, but I do still not know whether this is good practice. I think this will help a lot of other persons who are also in the same phase as me (developing the first projects with node):\nAfter installing the package with npm, I included this in my app.js:\napp.use('/flags', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules/flag-icon-css/'), { maxAge: 31557600000 }));\nand in my (pug) template file I included:\nlink(rel='stylesheet', href='/flags/css/flag-icon.min.css')\nand now I am able to use the css classes.

No more npm update :(.\nAnother problem is that it will add css and flags img in source control.. ",
    "Petronious": "Well, I've found an (ugly) workaround:\nIn angular.json, add \n{\n    \"glob\": \"*.svg\",\n    \"input\": \"node_modules/flag-icon-css/flags/4x3/\",\n    \"output\": \"images/flags\"\n}\nAnd in your component's scss, \n$flag-icon-css-path: '/images/flags' !default;\n$flag-icon-rect-path: '' !default;\n@import \"~flag-icon-css/sass/flag-icon\";\nI'm only using 4x3 icons so I didn't included 1x1..

    "MiguelRozalen": "Hi @Petronious i don't know in which part of angular.json put your solution... Can u help me?\n--EDIT:\nI finally fixed it. Your solution works like black magic! I got it put your info inside assets object:\n\"assets\": [\n     \"src/assets\",\n     \"src/favicon.ico\",\n     {\n         \"glob\": \"*.svg\",\n         \"input\": \"node_modules/flag-icon-css/flags/4x3/\",\n          \"output\": \"assets/flags/4x3/\"\n    },\n    {\n         \"glob\": \"*.svg\",\n         \"input\": \"node_modules/flag-icon-css/flags/1x1/\",\n          \"output\": \"assets/flags/1x1/\"\n   }\n],\nThen in my app style .scss: \n$flag-icon-css-path: '/assets/flags' !default;\n$flag-icon-rect-path: '/4x3' !default;\n$flag-icon-square-path: '/1x1' !default;\nAnd got it YEAH!.

    "alexandernst": "@Findus23 About the maintaining part: if those SVGs are edited by hand instead of using a graphical design tool, then yes, you're right. But I'm not sure if that is the case.\nAbout the size reduction: the resulting file size after gzip-ing the files in this patch will be smaller compared with the current files, after gzip-ping them. The reason for this is very simple: no matter how good gzip can \"compress newlines\", it still has to keep those newlines somewhere. If the newlines are removed, then gzip doesn't have to store anything related to newlines.. @lipis It doesn't seem to be working from outside of the project itself. If I create a \"Hello world\" project (with vue-cli, for example), and I do npm i flag-icon-css and then npm run build, the build folder will contain uncompressed flag icon SVG files.. ",
