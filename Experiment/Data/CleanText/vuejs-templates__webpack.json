Thanks @chrisvfritz for the explanation :)\n. The built file needs to be served over HTTP.\n. Thanks for the detailed report. So after investigation, this is actually caused by ESLint/espree monkey-patching Acorn (which is in turn depended by Jade)... it has already been fixed in espree and should expect a new patch release any time: https://github.com/eslint/espree/issues/250\n. espree@3.0.2 is out, update your eslint and it should work :)\n. In https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/src/main.js#L7 we are mounting the root instance onto <body>, with a child component named App - which will be rendered into the <app></app> tag.\n. Thanks! Ran into an issue where it would complain about sourceMap position not found in some cases, tracked down the problem and almost ready to submit a PR to fix it... then found this: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/1274\nSurprisingly it has been there for over a year and was just fixed just 8 days ago...\n. If you have errors thrown inside a *.vue file you will see that warning. (It still works though)\n. Awesome! Thanks a lot :)\n. You should think of css as module dependencies when using webpack. You can import css or sass directly inside *.vue files using <style src=\"...\" lang=\"...\"></style>.\n. <img> inside Vue templates will be processed by vue-html-loader which will serve the target file correctly on the dev server (and inline/copy the file during production build).\nFor JavaScript you should really install them through npm and just import instead of thinking about script tags.\n. You need to use the router before calling Vue.extend.\n. I forked it to provide better source map support for injected style tags during development, but other than that they are largely the same.\n. Hmm, I just personally never had the need to import html snippets when using Vue. But it doesn't hurt to have it pre-configured.\n. Yeah, I'm starting to think maybe we need to make some parts of the template optional via CLI prompts.\ne.g. do you want eslint? do you want coverage? do you even want tests?\n. Sorry for not getting this merged - I ended up making some big refactoring to the template, and included coverage config in those changes. Really appreciate raising the issue though!\n. The default webpack config inlines images < 10kb as base64 strings to save HTTP requests. Load the built page and you will see the image is there.\n. Fixed, thanks!\n. @jpokrzyk can you confirm adding .exe makes it work?\nIt'd be nice if Nightwatch can intelligently handle the correct extension on Windows, ~~so it's worth opening an issue there~~. But in the meanwhile we should probably look for a way to make it work as-is.\n. Ok, this should do it - chromedriver's npm bin detects the correct platform handling: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/commit/0ccbc85bc09ab1a485f2eab4e6ed63516ca6acf9\n. Let's see if this does it: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/commit/58c9d5c9710229c8c2cbe5a65b3744c842907044\n. :tada: \n. @chrisvfritz awesome, thanks in advance! :D\n.

Thanks to everyone who helped out locating the issue! It's fixed in vue-loader@8.2.3.\n. Well I guess it doesn't hurt to have a version, given that you can just press enter for the default value. In the meanwhile this avoids people running into problems with cmder. Another option is removing the prompt but leave the version in there.\n. dev \u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6ca1\u5fc5\u8981\u62bd\u53d6... \u90a3\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u4e0d\u662f\u7ed9\u4f60\u6539\u7684\u3002\n.

This seems like an html-minifier bug, but those options are not needed for Vue templates anyways. Fixed in vue-html-loader@1.2.1.\n. This is because one of the dev dependencies has transitive dependency on jade, and with npm3 it can be directly required. However you should still explicitly npm install jade --save-dev.\n. This is a vue-loader issue - I think you have the right guess, probably need to do some SourceMap line number hacking in there. Please open issue at vue-loader's repo instead.\n. \u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u7684 npm install \u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u88c5 node_modules \u770b\u770b\u3002\n. \u91cd\u65b0\u5b89\u88c5 ok \u4e86\uff1f\u5173\u6389\u4e86\u554a\n. I think it's better to keep App.vue as-is and add the note in the pre-render section of the README. Since replace: false doesn't actually do anything if no pre-render is used.\n. You need to disable eslint in webpack's preLoaders.\n. This is a module import order issue - because your main.js depends on other modules, those other modules are evaluated before main.js. In ES6, all import statements are hoisted, so even if you import other modules after Vue.use(VueResource), they still evaluate before that.\n\nOne work around is using require() instead of import which is not hoisted; another solution is to have a \"bootstrap file\" where you install all Vue plugins and export Vue again.\nFinally, I think it's probably better to re-design vue-resource so that it can be imported and used individually without relying on the global Vue.use().\n. Thanks for the PR - I do think this change makes sense, although there's one problem: if the user wants to change the sub-directory where built files are placed, they now have to change multiple places in the config instead of one.\nAlso, the build script relies on the sub-directory name to copy files in /static to the right place: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/build.js#L14\nSo we probably want to extract the static assets sub-directory name into a variable so that the user only need to change it in one place if they ever need to.\n. What we primarily want to consider is how can we make the setup easy to integrate with an existing backend app.\nIdeally, this is what the user needs to do in webpack.prod.conf.js:\n1. Change output.path to the root of the backend app;\n2. Change the variable mentioned in previous comment (let's call it staticPath?) to the sub-directory where static assets are supposed to be placed in for that backend app. E.g. /public for laravel/rails apps  (not in app/assets because webpack essentially does the job of the asset pipeline).\n3. They probably don't have to change publicPath in most cases.\nDoes this make sense?\n. @pespantelis thanks a lot for the follow up - unfortunately, it turns out this problem is more complicated than I thought, and your updates was quite different from what I had in mind. I eventually decided to make some pretty big changes, so sorry for not being able to merge this PR. Really appreciate the effort though.\n. Sounds weird. OS, Node, npm versions?\n. I thought this was clear enough?\nAlso, in production you are seeing a full reload, not a hot reload. The hot reload preserves your current application state.\n. You can disable that rule for the file using inline eslint-disable comments.\n. Thanks!\n. In dev mode, no file is written to disk, everything is served directly from memory by the dev server. You should use the dev server and proxy requests to your PHP app during development.\n. You should not be proxying everything - the proxys have highest priority and this would render your dev server useless. Only proxy API requests.\n. You do... dev server serves your frontend (index.html and static assets) at localhost, and it proxies API requests to your PHP app (which can be remote or local)\n. The config assumes your HTML file is pure. In your case you may need to instead proxy all static assets to the dev server on your PHP end!\n. I don't you guys are running into the same issue - but could you please try upgrading vue-cli to the latest version and confirm that things are fixed with a fresh project?\n. @Hemric good to know!\n. Shouldn't these be extracted in production build too? I think these two should reuse the same dev/prod settings.\n. @Grafikart beat you to it in #84 - sorry Chris ;)\n. This is a template for vue-cli. You're not supposed to use it directly.\n. Nice job!\n. vue-loader actually already does autoprefixing for component CSS: http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader/features/postcss.html\nBut yeah it doesn't get applied to non-component CSS, so I like your proposal, we can turn off vue-loader's own stuff and centralize it inside cssLoaders() and config.js.\n. \u9519\u628a dist branch \u7684 commit merge \u5230 master \u4e86...\n\u987a\u4fbf\u5347\u7ea7 vue-cli \u5427\n. You need to rebase against the latest dist branch because the previous merge was squashed.\n. Just put it in static and directly reference it in index.html. You don't want to pack it with your app code because jQuery never changes and would be better cached if loaded separately.\n. Use scss if you are using the CSS superset syntax.\n. If you are executing the build step, then you need to install full dev dependencies.\n. There's nothing we can do until the deps update for v6 compatibility, so stick to v5 for now!\n. I think this is the only template that uses Phantom 2, but thanks!\n. \u8fd9\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8981\u7b49\u4ed6\u4eec\u66f4\u65b0...\n. Hmm I'm not able to reproduce this with a fresh install. What's your OS/Node version?\n. The exclude pattern didn't work properly on Windows, it's fixed now.\n. Production source maps are separate from the js files. There is obviously something wrong, possibly related to the recent babel-runtime upgrade (we are using 6.x now). Built js from a fresh install is only 88kb.\n. What do you mean?...\n. vue-loader still uses postcss internally (when using scoped styles), so I think this would cause postcss to be run twice on Vue component CSS in some cases.\nWhat I think would be more ideal:\n1. Only chain postcss-loader for non-Vue CSS (probably by adding an option to the cssLoaders function)\n2. Disable autoprefixer in Vue config, and let both vue-loader and postcss-loader share the same Array of postcss plugins.\n. @Grafikart thanks!\n@chrisvfritz would appreciate you taking a look at this\n. Looks good - can you add a section in the docs for this feature?\n. \ud83d\udc4d thanks!\n. Mind doing this for dist branch instead? That is what CLI 2.0 is pulling.\n. This should theoretically save a file read (since webpack no longer needs to read main from Vue's package.json) and also save the parse time for the entire Vue.js file. The difference is probably not easily noticeable but seems nice to have.\n. Let's merge as long as it works properly.\n. CSS source map is disabled by default due to the tradeoffs described here: https://github.com/webpack/css-loader#sourcemaps\nYou can easily turn it on by forking the official template.\n. @hekigan it's mostly about the \"relative paths are buggy\" part. I haven't personally run into that bug, but I don't want people to be surprised by bugs caused by a default configuration.\n. \u7b2c\u4e09\u6b65 ctrl c \u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u88c5\u3002\u7b2c\u56db\u6b65\u53ea\u662f\u4e2a\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5176\u4ed6\u90fd\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8dd1\u3002\n.

Because the imagePath is only rendered by Vue at runtime, Webpack has no chance of rewriting it.\nIn your JS, use require('~assets/' + this.country.name + '.jpg') instead. This allows Webpack to return the correct static path.\n. js\nimagePath: function () {\n  return require('~assets/' + this.country.name + '.jpg')\n}\n. Selenium is still absolutely necessary, because Electron is only Chromium and we want to run tests in multiple environments. The default runs in Chrome & Firefox but the user can configure it to run in even more browsers.\nThe phantomjs usage is mostly for headless testing on CI environments. There are two concerns though: \n1. Electron's download size seems to be even heavier. (Phantom 17mb vs Electron 30~40mb)\n2. Electron is not a pure-browser environment, with Node and it's own special globals. This may cause unexpected problems for user code that are solely intended for browser environments.\n. Ideally we want the whole codebase to adhere to the chosen code style, but it's kind of a PITA to have to maintain two versions of the build/config files (which means we have to modify both versions for every change).\nA clever solution is using ESLint's --fix flag to convert between the formats during scaffolding - the two most decisive differences between the two styles (semi and comma-dangle) are both auto-fixable.\n. Serving gzipped content will be server-dependent, so it's better to be behind a config flag.\n. I'm not sure - feels clunky to have so many .eslintrc lying around. Although I don't have a better idea at this moment - will take a look later.\n. Hey thanks for the PR - can you submit it against the dist branch instead?\n. Yes please\n. Thanks!\n. This is caused by a bug in vue-loader@8.5.1, upgrade to vue-loader@8.5.2 and it should be fixed.\n. Hmm, cannot reproduce this, because it should resolve correctly: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/dist/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L16 (.vue extension is included)\nCan you provide the OS/Node/npm/webpack versions?\n. LGTM\n. Hmm not sure if beta makes sense for an option - if Airbnb's new config is still causing trouble, can we just revert to using the old, although deprecated, but maybe still available config?\n. file-loader config inlines any images smaller than 10k bytes as data-URI: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/dist/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L67\nThis is more efficient for an extra HTTP request for a tiny image.\n. I cannot reproduce this. Note the file only gets copied if it is somehow referenced in your templates. If it still happens for you, please provide a reproduction repo.\nAs for CSS, they are auto-extracted into standalone files for production builds, I'm not sure what you mean by \"a problem sooner or later\".\n. Embedded CSS is not inline and it has no specificity difference from external CSS. The only thing that may affect specificity in this case is occurence order.\nThe build system does know when you reference assets in templates (they are turned into require calls by html-loader). Same for urls in your CSS. In JavaScript you reference assets using require (causing it to be resolved by file-loader). It's in fact a good thing to not copy things that you never used, so again, unless you have a reproduction case showing it's not working properly, I don't know what your problem is.\nI suggest you do some reading on Webpack and the documentation of this template. If you simply disagree with how it is set up, then just roll your own.\n. Use plain <link> tag to include bootstrap. You don't need Webpack to process it anyway.\n. Rough idea is extracting the core configuration into an npm package, and allow users to override certain sections in the template. This is not easy though, due to how complex the config for this template has become.\n. The default components never intend to work with IE9. You are responsible for whatever content you create yourself.\n. @KingMario the components you see when you scaffold a new project. They are meant to be replaced by your code, so it doesn't matter what browsers they support.\n. Remove the leading slash: /[name].css will cause webpack trying to create the file at the root directory of your entire system.\n. Are you running this from Atom's console or something other than the terminal?\n. Imo it's not a good idea to mix pug includes with Vue's own component composition. If you need composition, just make them components instead. This is why vue-loader's template part don't support pre-processor imports.\nIf you really want it, you'll have to use pug-loader and configure vue-loader to use pug-loader per docs here. In addition, pug-loader returns a compiled template function, not the raw HTML, so you need to chain a custom loader after pug-loader to invoke that function and return the value.\n. Hey, thanks for the PR... but I think it's obvious that we can't merge this as-is.\nThere's no easy way to cherry-pick individual bits out of big PRs. Instead, I'd suggest open PRs that change one thing at a time.\n. You need https://github.com/webpack/json-loader\n. As the message suggests... read more here about the runtime only build.\nTo solve it you need to either add the following to your Webpack config:\njs\nresolve: {\n  alias: {\n    vue: 'vue/dist/vue.js'\n  }\n}\nOr, make sure that all your components are defined in *.vue files, because they are pre-compiled.\n. Likely because of this: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/dist/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L53 which makes babel-loader skips anything from node_modules.\nYou can try adding vue-datepicker to the include array so that it's \"whitelisted\" to babel-loader.\n. @kkomelin this is because most npm modules export pre-compiled JS, but vue-datepicker is exporting raw *.vue files. If we apply babel to every npm module it will be hugely inefficient, so it's not something the template itself can accommodate for.\n. GitHub probably had internal server errors during that period - seems to be working fine now.\n. ES6 -> ES5 transpilation only handles syntax transformation, not polyfills (these are more like runtime features). You can either use babel-polyfill (which includes all ES6 related polyfills) or just es6-promise.\n. @DevanB polyfills are not webpack specific https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise. I'd add that to the top of your entry file. Closing due to inactivity. I think it's better to leave this up to users to decide.. dependencies means you use it only in your application code.\ndevDependencies means you use it in build scripts.\nIt's true that the distinction isn't really that useful - technically, everything is devDependency because the final build output is static files. That said, this PR doesn't seem to help with that either because npm install --production is a Node server only concept.\n. I still hold my original opinion (also elaborated by @LinusBorg ) - if you want to build or test, you should always do a full npm install. FYI, you can simply overwrite NODE_ENV with npm install --production=false.. I tested on the latest branch with Webpack 2 and other projects using Wepback 2, and it seems there's no difference at all after adding this plugin... but thanks for the PR!. This template doesn't include server-side rendering - I'm not sure where you got the impression that it does.\nThere is currently no official template for server-side rendering, because SSR has a lot to do with your server setup and how your app is structured. The official reference implementation is https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0\nAnd as @ianwalter pointed out: it's inappropriate to just mention random contributors to help you with a problem.\n. Hey thanks for the PR - however, the port is needed in e2e tests and need to be determined before running the tests. The async-ness of detect-port also makes dev-server.js no longer export the server instance. I think it's probably ok for the user to ensure the port is available.. Closing since this shouldn't be necessary with proper node/npm versions.. @pksunkara apologies that I didn't pay more attention to your PR earlier - it does look very similar to this one. That said, it by no means indicate that your contribution was not welcome - it's mostly that my thoughts on what the template should include do change over time. At the time of your PR the 2.x router wasn't considered very stable but now it is - so I'm more confident in including as part of the default options now than I was a few months ago. Hope that explains it.. You should quote your strings or call JSON.stringify on the strings:\njs\nmodule.exports = merge(prodEnv, {\n  NODE_ENV: '\"development\"',\n  GLOBAL_VAR1: {\n    PROP1: JSON.stringify(\"someValue\")\n  }\n})\nUsing a string for DefinePlugin will result in something like this:\njs\n{NODE_ENV:\"production\"}.NODE_ENV !== \"production\"\nAnd will cause minifier optimization to fail.. I'm not sure if this is necessary. The build code is only needed in build.js, it's not reusable/reused, so I'd rather keep it where it's actually used. Thanks for the PR though!. If you happen to use Webpack's code-split feature, all lazy-loaded components will need to dynamically inject their styles, which relies on vue-style-loader. If not then this may indeed be a bug.. Oh god, I'm so sorry I didn't see this earlier (I turned off notifications for this repo). I happened to work on the exact same thing without knowing this PR existed... now they are conflicting in like a million files :/\n@patrick91 thank you so much for the effort put into this - I took some notes from your changes and incorporated into the current master branch, but unfortunately we do have some duplicated efforts here...\nApologies again. \ud83d\ude47\ud83d\ude47\ud83d\ude47. Removed in latest webpack 2 updates. Thanks for the PR though!. Cannot reproduce on a fresh install. What's your Node/npm version?. I'd suggest simply avoid doing that then... as this seems to be very unconventional. And if it's a webpack issue this is not really the place to resolve it.. Hey all - hate to say it but I have to revert this. The reason is that once you configure target browsers, some ES6 features will be left untouched, and it would break UglifyJS. The alternative is to use babili for minification, which is unfortunately ~3 times slower than UglifyJS, and would make builds significantly slower.\nI think for now we will use babel-preset-latest instead.. @graingert you can't just apply it to your application source code - you need to minify the entire bundle, so using it via a Babel preset won't fly. Instead we'd have to use babili-webpack-plugin, which in my local testing results in 100% slower build.. Thanks for the PR, but I don't really think it's a good idea to add another eslint config... It's already getting quite hairy making sure template files adhere to different configs. I think we'll stick with the two we have for now.. I don't think we should add more questions to the scaffolding process, because there will always be more of them. I'd rather make it easy to add whatever is needed after scaffolding. And I'm planning a rewrite of the webpack template in the next few weeks.. Thanks for the great work @Igogrek - this is actually quite helpful as I am designing the architecture for the next iteration of vue-cli. The core problem of this template right now, is that there are multiple options, and each option has its changes scattered all over the template (e.g. the number of files touched for adding minimal TS support), and each file involves conditional blocks added by many options, so it becomes more and more difficult to maintain over time. Hopefully we'll be address that in the next version of the CLI so all TS-related changes can be centralized and maintained in a single place.\nIn the meanwhile, I think the complexity introduced by this PR is manageable for the period of time before the new CLI is available.. this will point to the browser instance, I believe it's a convention for most of the callbacks in nightwatch. I'd preserve it for the sake of compatibility.. Looks good to me on first glance - good to merge with one additional person testing it locally to make sure it works as intended.. webpack imports the ES modules build, not the UDM build.. @codeofsumit FYI that's exactly how the env loading in vue-cli-next is handled.\nYou can have as many modes as you want, and each mode specifies its own env variables. So you do something like vue-cli-service build --mode=internal which loads env vars from .env.internal and .env.internal.local. And all env vars that start with VUE_APP_ will be available in your client side code via webpack.DefinePlugin.. Thanks, can you remove the blank lines here? Just keeping things consistent.\n. This could just be /* eslint-env shelljs */\n. path is in fact used below (see output.filename)\n. this loader also handles fonts\n. yeah that's what I would do\n. ",
    "TheDutchCoder": "I'm a complete moron. Sorry!\n. While on this topic (no need to open a new issue for this I think): it would be nice if the steps would also include modules like Vuex (Flux) or Revue (Redux) for state management, as well as Vue Resource.\nIs there a list somewhere that contains what is planned for the modules? Maybe people could contribute there ;)\n. I'm an idiot, #app gets replaced obviously.\nNothing to see here :|.

    "chrisvfritz": "@wei-ones Sorry it took a while to look at this PR! I haven't used browser-sync before. Can you share more information about it and how it would improve the workflow of everyone using this template?\n. @wei-ones Thanks! We'll investigate this. :smiley: \n. After some more research, I'm glad I know about browser-sync now, but worry it might not belong in this template. I believe it could be very useful when manually testing across many browsers and devices, but  in apps where it's important to test that different visitors do not see the same thing, it could get in the way. Thank you again though for bringing this tool to our attention @wei-ones!\n. @jbruni This sounds like a feature request for another project, rather than a bug in this one. I recommend closing and opening a new issue in one of these:\n- vue-loader\n- vue-hot-reload-api (which seems to have issues turned off - is that on purpose @yyx990803?)\n@yyx990803 should have a better idea of where that belongs.\n. @GitYong fsevents is an API available only on OS X. Since it's an optional dependency for at least one of the included packages, the failure should not kill the install. Since I haven't experienced this issue on Ubuntu, I don't think it's a bug in this project, but rather an npm or system quirk. \nMy recommendation would be to close this issue and open up a question on Stack Overflow.\n. @b44rd I think in your case for LESS, you might have just needed @import '../src/less/theme.less (relative importing, rather than absolute from the project root). As for getting lang=\"scss\" working and possibly some other issues, I believe #29 should fix a lot.\n. Ah, interesting. This thread has some people reporting a similar issue. Do any of their proposed solutions work for you?\n. @OEvgeny It's unclear. :confused: The problem seems to be specific to LESS - that much we know. The maintainers of less-loader are pretty sure it's not their problem (hence the issue being closed), some are saying it's an issue with Webpack, and some are saying fixing it requires special configuration in .babelrc. Then someone else said updating and configuring postcss was the way to fix it.\nEither way, if you find something that works for you, please let us know! This is an odd situation, where the problem definitely isn't specific to this project, but it's not very clear where the problem is originating. So while the LESS ecosystem is figuring it out, I think it makes sense to keep this issue open and then incorporate a patch once we find one.\nIn the meantime, would you mind renaming this issue based on our discussion? I'm thinking something like LESS imports not respecting Webpack resolve alias.\n. Thanks @mbensch! @OEvgeny, can you confirm whether that solution works for you?\n. @dolphineor When you say, \"it seems like the router doesn't work\", what code specifically is not working? And instead of the expected behavior, what is happening instead? Literally nothing, an error in the JS console, or something else?\nAdapting the vue-router Basic Usage docs, below is a minimal setup that should work within this boilerplate. Once you have that set up, v-link, this.$router.go, etc should work within all your components.\nMinimal vue-router setup\nsrc/index.html\nhtml\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>Vue App</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <!-- route outlet -->\n      <router-view></router-view>\n    </div>\n    <!-- built files will be auto injected -->\n  </body>\n</html>\nsrc/main.js\n``` js\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router'\nimport configureRoutes from './routes'\nVue.use(VueRouter)\nconst router = new VueRouter({\n  history: true,\n  saveScrollPosition: true\n})\nconfigureRoutes(router)\nrouter.start(\n  Vue.extend({}),\n  '#app'\n)\n```\nsrc/routes.js\nThe below assumes the referenced Vue components exist in a src/pages directory, which I often use for top-level page components.\n``` js\nimport NotFound from './pages/not-found'\nimport Home from './pages/home'\nimport About from './pages/about'\nexport default router => {\n  router.map({\n    '/': {\n      component: Home\n    },\n'/about': {\n  component: About\n}\n\n'*': {\n  component: NotFound\n}\n\n})\n}\n``\n. @dolphineor Awesome!\n. @iugo Can you provide more detail into what's going on in your case? Do you have an example project you can link to?\n. @iugo I'm closing due to inactivity. I'm happy to re-open though if @jbruni's suggestion doesn't work and you can provide more information about the failure and the system you're experiencing it on.\n. @zjhiphop Check out [the docs forsass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#apply-via-webpack-config). You'll need to add a loader for SCSS to use SCSS in their own files, outside of components. The only difference is that instead of thestyleloader, you'll usevue-style`. Let me know how that works out for you. :smiley: \n. @zjhiphop Just checking in. Have you had a chance to see if the suggestion above worked for you?\n. @chrispappas Almost. I believe this would be what you want:\njs\n{\n  test: /\\.scss$/,\n  loaders: [ 'vue-style', 'css', 'sass' ]\n}\n. @yyx990803 forked style-loader to fix some issues with it. I don't know a lot about that - I've just always used vue-style-loader and never had issues. :smiley: Evan will be able to better explain the history behind that decision and whether it matters for you in this case.\n. @chrispappas Excellent. Even though this is resolved, I want to keep the issue open for now. I'm considering implementing something similar to this, so that CSS preprocessor files just automatically work if the loader is installed, similar to how they do in components.\n. Resolved in #84.\n. I'll try to reproduce and fix this in the next few days on my Linux box.\n. @yyx990803 Wasn't able to reproduce this, unfortunately.\n- ubuntu 15.10 64-bit\n- linux 4.2.0-16-generic\n- npm 3.7.3\n- node 5.8.0\nI'm happy to dig in further though, with more information about the systems this fails on.\n. Thanks @cnicodeme! :smiley: I'll try to replicate this in a Docker container and see what happens. In the meantime though - can you try deleting the extract-text-webpack-plugin in your node_modules, then re-running npm install? Knowing if that fixes the problem could be useful.\n. @cnicodeme Wow, that's great information and should definitely help narrow it down! I'll let you know if I'm still not able to reproduce it or have any other questions.\n. No worries - you've already been a huge help!\n. Darn, I'm still having difficulty reproducing this, even on Fedora. :confused: I've run out of ideas currently, but I'll leave this open to see if someone else might be able to find a solution. @cnicodeme Thank you again for all your help narrowing it down! If you haven't already, I'd also open an issue in extract-text-webpack-plugin, now that we have more information.\n. @cipas @cnicodeme I'd open an issue in extract-text-webpack-plugin detailing your issue. If you find a solution to your problem, please let us know back here!\n. @pratyushbarik Thanks for adding new information. If you happen to find a way to get the plugin to work without disabling it, please do post back here. :smiley:\n. @funkyLover, I love your funk! Thank you for putting that together like a master detective. \ud83d\ude04 I'll investigate this and see if I can figure out what's going on.\n. @yyx990803 I hate to say this after-the-fact, but I'm actually wondering whether this shouldn't be reverted. :disappointed: While the docs do say a version is required, that information is actually out of date, because it doesn't really make sense for projects that will never be published as a module. So this just creates extra work at the start of a project for no gain.\n@jpokrzyk The real problem is in cmder and will be fixed in version 1.3. You can follow that link for instructions to get the fix early if you want. :smiley: \n. @jpokrzyk You definitely did the right thing. The maintainers of NPM have just chosen to keep a known oversimplification in the docs in an attempt to keep them simpler for package maintainers - at least until they come up with a nice, concise way to explain the exception.\n@yyx990803 Given those options, my personal preference would be to skip the prompt and just automatically add a version to package.json. I wonder if \"version\": \"*\" would be a good compromise? I'm thinking the advantage there is it doesn't imply versioning in a project where it probably won't apply.\n. Should really, really fix https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/56 :stuck_out_tongue: \n. Sounds like it is possibly related. @esahione @Astray-git I'd open an issue in extract-text-webpack-plugin detailing your issue. If you find a solution to your problem, please let us know back here!\n. I'm pretty convinced this is indeed the same issue as #41, so closing as duplicate for now.\n. @Astray-git I unfortunately wasn't able to reproduce the problem with that example. :confused: Could you link to an example project demonstrating the issue?\n. @Astray-git Thanks for the link! That helped a lot. :smiley: From the Vue docs:\n\nThe Array syntax for v-bind:style allows you to apply multiple style objects to the same element:\n\nThat means column.styles should be an object rather than a string. For example:\njs\ncolumn: {\n  width: '10px',\n  styles: {\n    textAlign: 'center'\n  }\n}\nIs your issue resolved after making that change?\n. Root-relative paths like this will work if you're visiting the page in the context of a real web server. For example, try this from your project folder:\nnpm install -g live-server\nlive-server dist\n. @tiaod That looks like an eslint error. Try removing the following from module.preloaders in webpack.base.conf.js:\njs\n{\n  test: /\\.vue$/,\n  loader: 'eslint',\n  exclude: /node_modules/\n},\n. @ickeep Can you share the contents of your .eslintrc file?\n\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u4eab\u4f60 .eslintrc \u6587\u4ef6\uff1f\n. I felt compelled to add a comment explaining the replace: false, which could be an indication that it's not worth adding... I'm on the fence.\n. @yyx990803 Yeah, I think that's a good call. Updated. Doc reference looks good?\n. This is working as intended. See the vue-resource docs for example usage.\n. The reason Vue.resource does not exist in the module is because it's a module. You're importing a fresh copy of Vue, because that other copy only exists within main.js. Vue.use(Resource) in main.js adds vue-resource to the context (this) of every component included from the App component.\n. In the module that you want to use vue-resource in, is it still not working after Vue.use(Resource)?\n. @OEvgeny I wouldn't recommend adding Vue to globals anyway. Calling Vue.use within each module is the correct way to do this. Glad to hear that it's working for you. :smiley: \n. Thanks @azamat-sharapov!\n. Thanks for the PR @pespantelis! Could you explain what the advantage of this change is? It looks like config is just moved around a little. Does it work better somehow or prevent other problems?\n. @silvestreh I think what's \"sane\" is very subjective in this case. We're shipping with rules from a community-developed standard, so it's not arbitrary. The good news is that you can use your own fork with vue-cli, with eslint rules that fit better with the coding style you'd like to enforce. :smiley: Or you can turn off eslint completely.\nIn the future, we're planning on making linting and some other features optional when generating a new project.\n. @miquelangel-castillo Changing values in data don't trigger a reload because those values are only the initial state for the component. When a component has already been initialized, changing that initial state has no effect. One important difference between hot reloads and a refresh are that reloads maintain the current state of components.\nIf you add method or computed functions and change those, does the hot reloading work then?\n. @miquelangel-castillo Glad to hear it! And glad you're enjoying Vue. \ud83d\ude00\n. @SystemZ That's what I would do. \ud83d\ude42 We're planning on eventually making features such as linting optional when generating a new project, so that should help in the future!\n. @rob-balfre We're currently working on a more modular build process that will allow people to opt in or out of certain features, such as tests and eslint, when creating a new project. I think that would be a great time to add optional vue-router integration as well. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @KevinNTH I recommend checking out the examples and the docs.\n. @KrishnaPG Those are usage/support questions, while the issues are reserved solely for bug reports and feature requests. I recommend posting your question on either the forum or the Gitter chat.\n. @unhealthy @Hemric Does the latest master with path.resolve instead of path.join fix the problem?\n. @yyx990803 Resolves #33.\n. Yeah, probably. I only use external files for branding variables that are imported into style elements in .vue components. I'll update.\n. That's fantastic! I'll never complain when someone does work so I don't have to. \ud83d\ude04\n. @Grafikart I recommend forking the template, then you can run vue init Grafikart/webpack name-of-test-project to generate a new project using your fork.\n. @Grafikart Just pinging on this. Anything we can do to help?\n. @erguotou520 I believe this is a Cordova configuration issue, rather than a problem with the template. Does this fix your problem?\n. @erguotou520 Just to give you an update, we're considering changing all the generated paths to relative rather than root-relative. Just exploring first whether there are any edge cases where this wouldn't work.\n. @erguotou520 So in a Cordova, can use of the base tag solve your problem?\n. @erguotou520 What about if location.href is updated to:\njs\nlocation.protocol + '//' + location.host\n. OK, turns out I didn't really understand how the base tag works. \ud83d\ude1e  For one thing, it apparently doesn't work at all on absolute URLs. But I just tested a modified build script in package.json:\njson\n\"build\": \"node build/build.js && sed -i .bak -e 's/href=\\\"\\\\//href=\\\"/g' dist/index.html && sed -i .bak -e 's/src=\\\"\\\\//src=\\\"/g' dist/index.html && rm dist/index.html.bak\",\nIt just removes the starting slash from any absolute URLs in the generated index.html. And it seems to work in one of my apps that I just tested it with! If you're on Windows, I believe you'd want to make sure you're using Git Bash or some other POSIX compliant shell.\n. Well you can do regex substitution with sed no matter what the file is. There'd likely be other ways you'd want to address the problem though, depending on where the absolute URLs are coming from. I'd need more information. \ud83d\ude15 \n. I've looked into this a bit more and some are claiming there are SEO concerns when using relative rather than root-relative paths, so this is starting to look like a wontfix. However... for mobile development, you may be interesting in weex, which very much inspired by Vue and is being actively developed by Alibaba Group, which is one of the largest tech companies in China.\n. @runarhk Thanks for sharing this! Can you explain a little more about the implications of a change like this? I understand it's creating an empty mock of these node modules, but after looking at the docs, I'm still unsure why or when this is necessary. I'm also not sure what potential problems mocking these modules could cause (I imagine there's probably a reason it's not default behavior).\n. @runarhk Thanks for the follow-up! I'm a Webpack power user, but by no means a complete Webpack expert, so I'll leave this open with the help wanted tag until someone can enlighten us. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Since this issue has been stale for a while and no one else has reported it, I'm closing for now. Happy to reopen pending new information or others indicating that it's a problem for them as well.\n. @lee134134134 Is this happening on a freshly generated, unmodified project? My suspicion is you may have modified .eslintrc to a configuration that does not allow modules.\n. @SiegfriedEhret Thanks for the confirmation and additional information! :tada:\n. This is correct. build.js is a script that's used to build the production site, but its dependencies are not included in the static files generated in the dist folder. What errors exactly are you getting on Heroku? And what is your setup? Do you have a backend that you've integrated this into, or are you trying to deploy a static site?\n. @thatandyrose Heroku is great for dynamic sites that include an integrated backend server, but for this template (which produces a purely static site), I'd actually recommend using static site hosting such as Surge or Netlify.\nWhat's probably the simplest possible deployment process would look like this:\nFirst, add the surge package to the dev dependencies in your package.json and install it with:\nnpm install --save-dev surge\nThen you can add these two lines to the scripts section of package.json:\njson\n\"predeploy\": \"npm run build\",\n\"deploy\": \"surge --project dist --domain whatever-subdomain-you-want.surge.sh\"\nAnd... now you're done. \ud83d\ude04  Whenever you run npm run deploy, your site will deploy to Surge, for free. The first time, it'll prompt you to create an account with an email and password and on subsequent runs, it'll just deploy.\nLet me know if that works for you!\n. @ChrisCates I just tested this with a fresh project and am not experiencing this. \ud83d\ude15  I'm guessing our dependencies have already released updates for node 6 compatibility, but you don't have them installed yet. Have you tried npm update in your project?\n. @plantvsbirds I'd be open to taking a look at a PR with what you have in mind.\n. Haven't heard any reports of this problem for a while, so closing for now - happy to reopen pending new reports or especially a proposed PR that would resolve it. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Duplicate #97\n. @ericjim It's not recommended to use @import in CSS, for these reasons. What I would instead recommend is using SCSS, which is a superset of CSS and will allow you to use imports the way you want to here.\nTo use SCSS, you'll need to:\n- npm install --save-dev sass-loader node-sass\n- rename .css files to .scss\n- add the lang=\"scss\" attribute to style elements in .vue components\n. Duplicate #98 \n. Hi @facesea. \ud83d\ude03  Beyond dependencies that you explicitly import/require, some other things that will contribute to the size of your project:\n- Your own code (obviously) \ud83d\ude1b \n- Webpack's code to tie everything together\n- Images that are small enough to be base64 encoded and inlined\nIf you still think something strange is going on, would you be able to host a demo project on GitHub that demonstrates the discrepancy you're observing?\n. @facesea Can you confirm whether upgrading to babel-runtime 6.x fixes your issue?\n. @facesea Possibly. Can you publish a project demonstrating what you're seeing?\n. This has been open for a while without repro, so I'm closing. Happy to reopen if someone provides a minimal example of a new project demonstrating the issue. \ud83d\ude03 \n. This is something I'd be open to if someone finds a good solution that compresses images losslessly (at least by default).\n. @TheDutchCoder I really like the idea of out-of-the-box, lossless image compression, but having just done a little more research into this problem, it looks like it won't be that simple. \ud83d\ude15\n- The quality (and sometimes availability) of binaries for various image compressors seems to vary wildly.\n- Depending on how images are used in a project, I worry that the optimal size/quality tradeoff will be quite different from project to project.\n- The types and quality of compressions possible are very different for each image format, likely making the results of image compression difficult to predict for users of the template.\n@mdsb100 Beyond the above concerns, I'd also really like to avoid increasing the complexity of the build process by introducing more build tools.\nClosing for now, but open to revisiting this in the future, pending better and more predictable tooling that can default to lossless compression.\n. @phanan What's your typical strategy for Laravel integration? I can explain what I do for Rails and I'm guessing the general strategy should transfer, but Laravel-specific instructions would probably be more helpful. \ud83d\ude42\n. @mariaczi I actually just published this, which demos 3 different Vue integrations with Rails, including one that uses this template and includes Bootstrap. What may be of particular interest to you is the proxyTable config and how Bootstrap is included via bootstrap-sass. \nI hope that helps! Anything Laravel-specific I can't be of much help with unfortunately. \ud83d\ude15 \n. @mariaczi I'm moving this issue to the forum, as it looks like someone has found a good solution and is able to answer questions about it.\n. My personal preference would actually be to avoid this right now. I worry that others might see let and const and think, \"Oh, I can write in ES6!\" when in fact, there's only very limited support and will be for the foreseeable future, as we don't plan on dropping support for node-v4 anytime soon.\n. Thanks @CodinCat!\n. I might be misunderstanding, but isn't the implication of \"generated\" that it is done generating?\n. @wklc2014 Are you on Windows by any chance? I've noticed that using Git Bash and sometimes other Windows terminals that many commands fail to quit properly (not just with vue-cli).\n. Yes, that's what I recommend.\n. This seems to work. @yyx990803 Does this look like it'll play well with vue-loader?\n. This looks really great. I just submitted a PR to your PR \ud83d\ude1c with a slight refactor. I changed the strategy used a little bit, so would love to hear your thoughts on that. Afterwards, it should be good to merge. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Except the example in the docs uses pathRewrite:\njs\npathRewrite: {\n  '^/api': ''\n }\n. Since this is neither a bug nor a feature request, I recommend posting your question on either the forum or the Gitter chat.\n. To fix the linting issues or turn off the linter?\n. Since this is neither a bug nor a feature request, I recommend posting your question on either the forum or the Gitter chat.\n. Some dependencies still don't seem compatible with node v6. I would recommend sticking with node v4 or v5 until they have a bit more time to update.\n. Thanks @vtrrsl! \ud83d\ude04  @ErickPetru @Async0x42 Can either of you confirm whether adding that to .eslintrc.js  fixes the issue on Windows x64?\n. Fixed in https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/commit/a20a796f4c9733d3379ecab9301a154fcc6820d2. Thanks for the troubleshooting and feedback everyone!\n. @Vasiliy-Bondarenko Unfortunately, I think that project structure is just inherently problematic. It's quite common for modules to try to detect the presence of optional dependencies, so this likely won't be the last issue it causes. If you're using buble for the backend, I recommend having side-by-side frontend and backend directories, which each have their own package.json. This way, they can't interfere with each other.\n. @markusha @Continuum81 The issue originally reported here has been fixed. It sounds like you're both seeing a separate, but similar issue. I can't reproduce this unfortunately, so I think you'll have to do a little more investigating to figure out when exactly it's happening. For example, does it still happen when:\n- Using a different operating system?\n- Using an older or newer version of Node?\n- Choosing different options during project generation?\nI've personally confirmed it works on Windows 10, with Node 4, 5, 6, and 7, and several different configurations.\n. Ahh, I see that now. On it.\n. You also need:\nnpm install --save-dev node-sass\n. @yyx990803 Should we go ahead and merge this then or is it not worth the added configuration complexity?\n. @ryerh On a fresh project, I'm getting\nUncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined\non this line. Does this PR need an update for the latest dist branch?\n. Huh. Just gave a stab at diagnosing this issue and I can't reproduce it anymore. I'm assuming I somehow did something wrong and this is actually fine, so merging. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Nevermind. Shortly after I merged, someone reported the same issue I experienced earlier. Looks like it may be an intermittent issue, possibly related to https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2312? Just reverted.\n. @ryerh Still open to a new pull request if you happen to figure out what causes the issue sometimes. When it was working for me, I did notice faster build times by ~1.5s on average. \ud83d\ude03 \n. @hekigan @PrimozRome Source maps for CSS aren't enabled by default in development. Does changing this line to:\nloaders: utils.cssLoaders({ sourceMap: true })\nhave the effect you desire?\n. I'd eventually like to go through and add a lot more comments and links to documentation in the build files, so I'll add a note about development source maps as well. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d\n. @aristidesfl This is an issue to bring up with css-loader. While they still have this warning, we don't want to risk exposing users to difficult-to-diagnose bugs in development.\n. @simplesmiler Yeah, this definitely looks like the same node6 problem as #116.\n. It looks like something is already running on port 4444. You'll have to end whatever that process is first.\n. Very interesting! I'd never considered this use case for electron. It certainly does seem to have its benefits.\nWhile I do feel some hesitation to switch from the devil I know, I think it might be worth the loss of Chrome + Firefox testing. I'm always developing in Chrome already and I can't remember the last time a test failed only in Firefox, honestly. The quirks usually result in things I'm not testing for, like the alignment of an SVG node. I'd be curious to hear others' experiences.\nThe speed of tests on the other hand, is a pain I definitely have felt on large applications. \ud83d\ude42 If I could cut those build times down by half or a third, that'd be... amazing!\n. @guidobouman jsdom isn't a full browser implementation, so is probably more likely to cause failures for features that do in fact work in real browsers.\n. It seems that this isn't the right time to move away from phantomjs, due to the concerns @yyx990803 mentioned. It could well be that electron's node environment doesn't really cause problems in practice, but we probably don't want Vue users to be the guinea pigs in this experiment. When there are more examples of large projects using electron to test against, we can revisit this. \ud83d\ude03 \n. This is something we're aware of and I should be able to take time to fix it in a few days. PRs welcome if folks want it sooner! \ud83d\ude42\n. I was planning on conditionals in the test files, then probably an overriding .eslintrc.js in the build directory so that it always uses standard.\n. @rhysburnie @dufus-proxy We have the beginning of a new potential strategy for linting here. It's still a work in progress, but even in its current state, will at least eliminate unnecessary linting errors in editors with ESLint integration. Would love to hear either of your thoughts on it.\n. I believe this should be fixed now. If anyone notices something we missed, please open another issue.\n. @SNiels Are you sure you're not using an older version of the template? The latest webpack.prod.conf includes this:\njs\nutils.assetsPath('css/[name].[contenthash].css')\nrather than:\njs\npath.join(config.build.assetsSubDirectory, '[name].[contenthash].css')\n. Hmm, I can't reproduce this personally (on OS X 10.11.4, node 5.11.1). What's your OS and node version?\n. Ah, would updating to type=\"text/babel\" fix it? I think that also works with Webstorm.\n. @devboxr In the settings for Atom's ESLint package, you have to check a box to enable Linting within HTML files.\n. @yyx990803 This is still a work in progress, but I'd love to hear what you think about this general direction.\n. My biggest problem with it is that most of those .eslintrcs obliterate the project's main linting rules with \"root\": true. I'd love a linting-package-agnostic way of disabling entire classes of rules, with something like this:\njson\n\"parserOptions\": {\n  \"ecmaVersion\": 5\n}\nBut it seems to have no effect. \ud83d\ude1e \n. The most significant pain for AirBnb users has been resolved with the addition of .eslintignore, so closing. \n. @ianwalter The method you describe of creating a testing config for Webpack sounds logical to me. I'd love to hear others' thoughts on whether this kind of change would be a good fit in the template.\n. There hasn't been any community desire for this it seems, so I'm closing for now.\n. @haozime Can you link to a simple example project with the problem?\n. This is working as intended. What you did is update the initial value of that data property, but after the component is loaded, hot reloading maintains the current state, so that change in initial state makes no difference.\n. Thanks! \ud83d\ude04 \n. This seems like a bug in airbnb/javascript, since Webpack is indeed able to resolve the path to the module. What would be the ideal solution for users of this linting config? A few ideas:\n- Specifically disable that rule in .eslintrc.js\n- Add .vue to those import statements, which may fix the problem\n- File an issue in the linting config so they can work better with Webpack\n. I've just disabled the rule, since Webpack will already let you know if a module can't be resolved. a5008e6d608093bd02cb1eb33b3e4f82ee31eae4\n. Thanks!\n. @jaschweder This is a known issue with the Airbnb linting config - is that what you're using? It's actually a bug on their end (and frankly, I think an overreach, since module bundlers already report errors if they can't find a module).\n. Duplicate #144.\n. Thanks for the PR, but I just disabled the rule, since Webpack already does a great job of notifying users when there's an unresolved module.\n. The forum or the Gitter chat are actually better places for questions like this, as we try to reserve the issues for feature requests and bug reports.\n. @yyx990803 Does this look OK to you? I have gzipping default to off, as many popular static hosts such as Surge or Netlify already gzip all static assets as part of their deployment process.\n. @vird Thanks for reporting this. I believe this may be an intermittent issue caused by https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/pull/122, which I just reverted. Can you confirm that the problem no longer exists for you on a fresh project?\n. It's not the new config specifically, but the fact that Airbnb's config isn't really a first-class citizen yet. When generating a new project, many files in the project folder - such as everything in the build folder - don't actually follow the enforced style. This causes a flurry of linting errors in editors with ESLint integration and also just feels yucky. \ud83d\ude41  We've gotten a few complaints about it, so this was an attempt to better manage expectations.\n. This has since been resolved by the addition of .eslintignore.\n. @blake-newman Sorry, will take another look at this soon. \ud83d\ude05  I took some time off to attend a wedding earlier this week and am still trying to catch up.\n. Got this error when trying to use stylelint in a new project:\nvue-cli \u00b7 stylelint doesn't match eslint - 16:68\n. @blake-newman Excellent! Will take a look at this soon, though maybe not this week, as I want to focus on getting those docs done if possible. \ud83d\ude04 \n. @blake-newman Just took another look at this and was still getting errors after generating a fresh project. \ud83d\ude15 \nI'm also concerned about users of unsupported preprocessors, such as stylus, less, or postcss. As far as I can tell, there isn't currently a way for stylelint to only parse style elements with an appropriate lang attribute and I'd hate for builds to start failing when someone adds one of these languages to a project. I just opened an issue for this, in case you want to take a stab at fixing it. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Huh, it looks like the HTML parsing has been deprecated, so a different strategy entirely may be in order. Possibly by using the stylelint postcss plugin and using it as the first loader for supported languages?\n. @rdpascua @XaroRSA Can both of you share your OS and node version?\n. @XaroRSA What about the node version (node -v)?\n. I still have no idea why the brace-expansion module is throwing Unhandled rejection on some systems. It doesn't seem to be a known issue. But it wasn't too hard to just removed the dependency that relies on that module, so I'm thinking all should be well now. @XaroRSA @rdpascua Can either of you confirm the fix?\n. Thanks!\n. This is not a bug. It's just how css-loader works.\n. @thany A couple other items worth noting:\n- Webpack will process files referenced from anywhere in your build system, including not only templates, but your JavaScript and CSS as well.\n- If you just want some files to be copied over, rather than handled by Webpack's file-loader, you can put them in the static folder. This is rarely the right solution, but an example where it's appropriate is a CNAME file that surge (the hosting provider) looks for to assign a custom domain.\n. Thanks! \ud83d\ude04\n. The component you linked to seems to work fine in a fresh project, so something else may be going on. Are you getting any warnings/errors in the JS console?\n. Closing this, as I'm guessing you may have resolved it and it also sounds likely to be an issue with the specific project, not the template.\n. @mul14 It looks like you found a bug in Vue itself! I just opened an issue for you there.\n. It looks like those are running through sass-loader, because you're getting Undefined variable errors. It just can't find where you've defined that variable. Can you provide a minimal project that demonstrates the problem you're seeing?\n. You can host a minimal example reproducing the problem on GitHub and then link to it.\n. Not sure why everything in the src directory would be bundled - that shouldn't happen. My guess is you have a glob import or dynamic require somewhere which is matching everything.\n. So there are a few things going on here. First, it looks like through deleting files, you've partially removed some features from the template, such as ESLint and Babel - but only partially. The .eslintrc.js file for example was deleted without removing the ESLint preloaders from webpack.base.conf.js. .babelrc was also deleted, breaking Babel integration.\nAs for your SCSS errors, when the unit tests run, (almost) all the modules in the in src directory are loaded to calculate test coverage. Since the template assumes the src directory contains independent modules, your tightly coupled SCSS raises errors. In _base.scss for example, you get an unknown variable error because the module assumes some global state created by main.scss. You could reorganize all of your SCSS into independent modules - or as explained in the comment here, you can update the regex to match a smaller subset of files, so that SCSS files are not tested for coverage. In your case, you could only test coverage for .js and .vue files like this:\njs\nvar srcContext = require.context('../../src', true, /^\\.\\/(?!main\\.js$).+\\.(js|vue)$/i)\nSome recommendations for the future:\n- To better understand Babel, Webpack, Karma, and many other technologies in this template, I recommend checking out egghead.io. They have a lot of great video tutorials on how these technologies work and building up that knowledge base will help you a lot!\n- When you want to remove a feature such as ESLint, first run a search through the project for the word eslint, so that you can gain greater perspective on how it's being used.\n- Before deleting files, definitely make sure you know what they do! .babelrc is necessary for Babel to work. Since you're still using the ES2015+ syntax in JavaScript files throughout the project, I assume breaking Babel was not intentional.\n- This last item is especially important. This was not a minimal example. A minimal example of the problem would have been one where the minimum number of changes have been made to a fresh project in order to reproduce the problem. In most projects, they simply would not help you when providing an example like this. And even here, going through code with so many changes that have nothing to do with the problem means it takes longer for me diagnose an issue, which means I have less time to help people. \ud83d\ude15 \nI hope this helps.\n. Duplicate https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/123.\n. This is a feature of css-loader. From their Usage docs:\n- url(image.png) => require(\"./image.png\")\n- url(~module/image.png) => require(\"module/image.png\")\nNote the imoprtant ~ prefix to reference installed packages. Using bootstrap-sass in SCSS, this is what I use:\n``` scss\n// -------------------\n// BOOTSTRAP VARIABLES\n// http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables\n// -------------------\n// add any variables you want to override here\n// ---------\n// BOOTSTRAP\n// ---------\n$icon-font-path: '~bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/';\n@import '~bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap';\n```\n. I wouldn't want to convert all my styles to a different language either. Fortunately, you don't have to. I use SCSS, so that's the example I had on hand, but a similar technique should work just as well for LESS. I do believe Bootstrap 4 will be SCSS-only, so that transition may be inevitable if you'd like to upgrade. \ud83d\ude1e \nAs for modifying the Bootstrap source code - that's not what we're doing here. This isn't even a hack. These Bootstrap variables are made to be overridable. This is especially apparent in the SCSS version, where the variables all use !default, meaning that value should be assigned to the variable only if it hasn't been previously defined.\n. In that first example I provided, I'm overriding $icon-font-path by declaring it before the main Bootstrap import. In LESS, I believe variables are lazy-loaded, so you may have to declare that variable after the main Bootstrap import.\n. Not sure, sorry. \ud83d\ude15  Haven't used the LESS version or LESS itself really. This issue on css-loader may have better information.\n. Ahh, those are called quotes. A semicolon is this: ;. HTML without quotes is actually valid in certain contexts and we strip the quotes in production to minimize the size of the HTML.\n. I've been thinking about that problem, but we do actually have a significant number of people changing files in the build directory. For example, I always add a prerendering step. Sainsbury's process is different enough that they maintain a separate template and pick and choose updates from the main one. I've toyed with a few potential solutions, but all of them so far come with significant drawbacks. \nRest assured, this is something we're thinking about!\n. Closing to consolidate future discussion into this new issue.\n. That sounds like a workable plan. \ud83d\udc4d It's similar to what I do. I diff my non-source files with my initial commit, so I can see any customizations I've made to the build, then make those same modifications to a new project if necessary and then copy over my source files.\n. Thanks for the report @178220709. I was unable to reproduce this on my OS X system, but please let me know what other information you're able to gather as you do further testing!\n. @178220709 Any progress resolving this? I unfortunately still haven't been able to reproduce the issue. \ud83d\ude15 \n. This sounds like a general Babel/ESLint question, rather than a bug / feature request with the template, which is what we try to reserve the issues for. I recommend posting something in a forum or chat dedicated to those two technologies.\n. Why not delete the master branch and rename dist to master?\n. If you do really need another branch though, you can reference it with my-username/webpack#dist\n. What you are describing is prerendering, which is outside the scope of this build. You can however use prerender-spa-plugin to add this functionality. It's been tested with Vue and works very well!\nThe vendor.js file is where we keep common dependencies that will not change very often, such as Vue. The app.js file is for your actual application code. Then the manifest.js file is required by Webpack so that they can correctly work together and bust caches properly.\n. As a primary maintainer of both this template and that plugin, trust me - it's what you're looking for. \ud83d\ude09 This template produces a SPA and if you want the \"correct production outcome\" written to index.html, you have to prerender it.\n. I'd say this probably even qualifies as a duplicate of #75.\n. There's not a lot of information here, but you may want to check out https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/98. Does that address your problem?\n. Hi @ivomarsan. It looks like something strange is happening with this PR. It's coming from \"unknown repository\" and seems to include some commits that are already in the repo. \ud83d\ude15 \n. Thanks @hekigan!\n. Since the welcome page uses a flexbox layout and all versions of IE have a large number of flexbox bugs, that probably explains the alignment being off. Can you investigate why the icon isn't appearing?\n. @ttoinou May I ask, why would you want to disable the hash?\n. @ttoinou Ah, I see. In general, webpack-simple may be a better template for library work, as there's a lot in this template that assumes one is building a SPA.\n. Yeah, NPM is having some issues right now. We just have to wait. \ud83d\ude15 \n. Thanks for this @nickspiel. Looks good to me! \ud83d\ude03 \n. Thanks @morficus! As @LinusBorg mentioned, since these templates are not very modular or easily testable at the moment, a bunch of major version bumps all at once makes me a little uncomfortable, but I would like to bring this in soon - possibly in an \"edge\" branch for this repo, where it would be more acceptable if something broke temporarily.\nTo ease development for the future and when some other work for 2.0 slows down a bit, I'd also like to completely rewrite the templates for 2.0 with a full test suite, so that in the future we'll just be able to say, \"Tests pass, looks good, merge\" for contributions like this.\n. Closing for now, as we'll either replace this template with a testable one or update dependencies one-by-one. \n. I believe this was just fixed in #188.\n. @LinusBorg What would you think about a rename from developmentSourceMap to cssSourceMap? Since it's under config.dev, the \"development\" part already seems implied to me, but I would like to specify that this only applies to CSS.\nI also see a couple more small typos we can fix. \ud83d\ude09 \n\n// In our experience, they generally work as ~~expexted~~ expected,\n// ~~just~~ but be aware of this issue when enabling this option.\n\nAnd then I know it was my idea, but what would you think about just removing those last two lines of the comment?\n\n// Repated issue in the templates repository:\n// https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/123\n\nI feel like linking to css-loader is probably enough when I think about it more. \ud83d\ude03 \n. @LinusBorg Regarding 2, the fact that it's already under the dev options scopes it specifically to the development build and unlike the productionSourceMap option, this one only affects CSS source maps (not JS), so I think it would be good to make that more clear in the name. \ud83d\ude03 \n. All you should need to do is update test/unit/index.js. This is probably the regex you're looking for:\njs\n/^\\.\\/(?!main\\.js$|routes\\/subRoutes).+\\.(js|vue)$/i\n. @AnthonySendra If that isn't working, the only explanation I can think of is you're requiring security.js through a test (even if indirectly). For an exclude through a karma config, you'll have to research that. It sounds like there's nothing specific to Vue or this template here, so closing.\n. No, we're not interested in adding 3rd-party libs that would only be used by a small subset of users.\n. @Coffcer I don't think I understand. Is the template not working as it should out of the box or are you looking for help modifying the template?\n. I'm still not sure why you'd want to, but you can disable it by removing any lines that mention hotMiddleware in build/dev-server.js.\n. babel-core/register is actually near deprecation. From the source:\njs\n// TODO: eventually deprecate this console.trace(\"use the `babel-register` package instead of `babel-core/register`\");\nmodule.exports = require(\"babel-register\");\nThis file and the surrounding files also follow the ferross/standard style, so no unnecessary semicolons please. \ud83d\ude03 \n. @ianwalter Thanks! I know this sounds like a nitpick, but in package.json, the babel-register dependency should be also be placed in alphabetical order. (It's still functional the way you have it, but people are used to scanning their dependencies list with this in mind.)\n. Thanks @noraesae. This looks like a great PR! The detail, demo, and links you provided are very helpful. I'll try to take a closer look later today so that we can get it merged in.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/126.\n. @zhangxin840 I believe that was originally added because it was required for code splitting. Have you checked that code splitting still works when it's not set?\n. I can add that note, though first I'd love to hear what other templates people are using and enjoying for mobile/electron. I'd like to add a few alternatives rather than just saying, \"No!\" \ud83d\ude04 \n. This was fixed in #198.\n. Any files required here are included for test coverage. See the require.context docs for more information about requiring groups of files.\n. benbria/karma-coffee-coverage might be useful\n. @aristidesfl No unfortunately. \ud83d\ude15  I haven't personally used CoffeeScript in a Vue project.\n. We do have some dependencies that we'd like to update 1-by-1 soon, but your problem is unrelated to them. The vital line is:\nError: listen EADDRINUSE :::8080\nThat means another application on your system is already bound to port 8080. I don't remember if this also works on Linux, but on OS X, I usually run lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P and it'll give you a list of all the processes bound to ports. Find the one that's bound to 8080 then kill -9 PROCESS_PID (replacing PROCESS_PID with the actual PID of the process).\n. @Doogiemuc You're correct that the ready hook is not fired, since we're not actually adding this element to the DOM, but the test doesn't require the ready hook to be fired. It works as expected as it is. Did it fail for you?\nBy the way, the rewrite you proposed is not only slower and more verbose, but I think it would actually fail, since you've now made the test asynchronous without adding a done callback to the it block.\n. Closing due to lack of activity.\n. @funkyLover Thanks for the heads up - just fixed it. It's also my fault for not taking more than a cursory glance at the change.\n. This looks to be a vscode-specific problem, so it's unfortunately their bug rather than anything wrong with our configuration. @summitxf Thanks for documenting a fix for other users!\n. Can you please link to an example repo showing the problem?\n. I believe this should be working now. @ttquoccuong @cn-wang @UncleBill Can any of you confirm?\n. @divmgl These lines in the .eslintrc.js should prevent the error. Can you confirm that they're present? If they are, I think we'll need a repo with a failing example as our next step, as I just tried to replicate the issue with with the environment you described, but was unable to. \ud83d\ude15 \n. @divmgl Any update?\n. @ianwalter This might be useful with an extremely limited set of rules to catch common errors, such as an unpaired tag. I think I'd like to stay away from any stylistic rules for now though.\n. We'd consider a PR then. \ud83d\ude42\n. @Aladdin-ADD Once eslint-plugin-vue is stable, it'll solve this problem. \ud83d\ude42 . @aristidesfl No, PascalCase is one of the acceptable options and either way, those conventions do not apply to file names.\n. The documentation explains why the conventions exist and what Vue is doing, so that if you think about it, there would be no reason for them to apply to file names. And as I said before, it's a moot point anyway. Even if you chose to interpret file names as having to conform to the same conventions, PascalCase IS one of the acceptable options listed.\n. @zigomir I'm happy to take care of this. Since this is the most-used template, I think it might also be helpful to display a little message reminding people that this is Vue 2.0, with a link to the 2.0 docs and instructions for using the 1.0 template instead. Beyond that, is there anything else you can think of beyond just making the minimal updates to things working?\n. Ah, got it - sorry for missing that.\n. @matt-sanders That is not how $refs work. See the docs.\n. Agreed with @Gomah - I can see cases where someone might want one, but not the other. I very much like that you started with just one rule though, as each one we add probably deserves its own discussion. \ud83d\ude03 \n. I'm thinking it would also be good to include a note that people will see when running vue init webpack my-project. For example, perhaps another prompt before everything else. @zigomir What do you think?\n. @zigomir Yeah, it's a tough balance. \ud83d\ude15  Part of me would like to only support the Standard config, but the AirBnB config is much more popular. Supporting it does make maintenance a bit more difficult, but it also means we don't have to respond to many issues complaining about a lack of support for it - I'm not sure which is more of a pain. \ud83d\ude03 \n. @zigomir Just realized, since the new vue-loader no longer includes autoprefixing, we'll also need to add that to the base build with:\njs\nvue: {\n  postcss: [\n    require('autoprefixer')({\n      browsers: ['last 2 versions']\n    })\n  ]\n}\nAlong with this, autoprefixer will have to be added to the devDependencies.\n. @zigomir It's because css-loader depends on cssnano which depends on autoprefixer. (To figure that out, I ran npm list | grep -B 10 autoprefixer, which looks for autoprefixer in our dependency tree and shows that line and the 10 before it.) Since this is really an implementation detail though (cssnano might update to no longer depend on autoprefixer or css-loader might update to no longer use cssnano), it's good for us to explicitly include it in our devDependencies too.\nI'm also happy to investigate the hot reload stuff. \ud83d\ude03  I've already spent a lot of time hitting my head against the Webpack wall, so may as well get some use out of it!\n. Hmm, hot reloading seems to be working for me. So... I guess I fixed it? \ud83d\ude1c \n. No problem - and feel free to let me know if you come across more Webpack-specific things I can help with. I'm happy to save you the frustration if I can. \ud83d\ude42\n. I agree with you. \ud83d\ude03  master is my vote.\n. @marines That comment seems unrelated to this thread \ud83d\ude15 , but yes it does. It allows you to get  stack traces with accurate files and line numbers when debugging an error that happens in production.\n. More information on \"errors galore\" would be helpful.\n. We haven't had this reproduced by anyone in a month, so I'm assuming it's either fixed or something specific a single machine. Will reopen if we get other repros.\n. @rizkyramadhan Did you just upgrade an old project to Vue 2?\n. @rizkyramadhan OK - can you open a new issue with more details then (e.g. options you chose during install, whether you modified any files after the project was generated, versions of Node and NPM you're using)? I'd rather not re-use this issue for any errors that happen to appear on a fresh install.\n. @wakecoder It sounds like a VSCode problem then. \ud83d\ude15  I would look there.\n. @andre-dw If your primary concern is limiting the size of the build, Webpack's code splitting should be what you want.\n. A few solutions have been provided there's been no further discussion, so closing.\n. Since this is neither a bug nor a feature request, I recommend posting your question on either the forum or the Gitter chat.\n. Is this a fresh project install? And are you getting any errors in the terminal?\n. Thanks for reporting back! It doesn't sound like anything we can do in our end, so I'll close this for now.\n. We'll have to add conditional semi-colons and a conditional trailing comma to the file, similar to files in the src directory. If anyone wants to do this in a PR, it'd be welcome!\n. passPerPreset can also break other configurations, so it's good to know about that fix for this case, but we have to leave it out of the template for now.\n. Having all the templates pre-compiled will also offer better performance.\n. @connor11528 When you run both servers locally for development, you'll also want to make sure to proxy to your development API.\nYou don't necessarily have to keep them separate though. You could use something similar to these Express or Hapi configurations, where the frontend is served out of a frontend directory.\n. If you're installing from NPM, you can do something like this to reference the file in node_modules, which is absolutely fine.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. @brendonthiede is correct. Vue itself uses Sauce Labs to test in a wide variety of browsers. They also provide the option to test in many different platforms, including mobile.\n. I don't think this is a good idea, as the transpiled code sometimes behaves slightly differently from native implementations - especially in terms of performance characteristics. There would also be no way to test real behavior for older browsers in development.\n. You can use watch mode as a configuration setting. This is a Webpack usage issue, rather than specific to this template.\n. I think this is a great idea!\n. @zigomir I just added this to the 2.0 branch. Not sure which other branches might also need updates. I see that 1.0 is now ahead of dist - is it now deprecated? If so, should we update the default branch to 1.0?\n. Got it. I guess this is a discussion including @LinusBorg as well then, since I see the 1.0 branch has received some commits that the dist branch has not. My understanding is that the dist branch is currently the default for this template though. Is that correct @zigomir? I just want to make sure we're all on the same page. \ud83d\ude04  Once we are, it would probably also be a good time to delete any branches we don't want.\n. I think I'd prefer to just remove the dist branch, since the other templates don't have one. We should probably keep it in the CLI though, in case other templates are relying on the behavior.\n. This should be done now.\n. Unfortunately, moving all the config to a JSON file wouldn't be possible, as we need JavaScript features that aren't part of JSON.\n. This is a usage question that would be best suited to either the forum or the Gitter chat. Or since it's Karma-specific, rather than to do specifically with Vue, you could use resources in that ecosystem.\n. @zigomir What do you think? Good to merge?\n. See this discussion for why this is necessary.\n. Does updating this exclude to an include with an array of folders you do want fix it? See this issue for more info.\n. Closing due to inactivity.\n. I'm not sure I understand the question. This template does have a dev server that supports hot reload.\n. There aren't currently any loaders set up for video extensions, only images and fonts. A PR would be welcome though.\n. @chovy You're welcome to submit a PR if it's urgent for you. Videos (or any other file type) can also still be referenced as static assets.\n. I think you meant to submit a PR to the 2.0 branch?\n. This template is not compatible with Webpack 2.0 yet.\n. With beta.19 it might not fail right away, but last time I checked, many of the companion libraries had not yet been updated to work with 2.0 yet, so I still recommend putting off that upgrade.\n. This will be simplified when we release Vue 2.0, but in the meantime for 3rd-party templates, master is the default directory while your changes are on dist. So you'll want to:\ngit checkout master\ngit reset --hard dist\ngit push origin master\n. I also know dozens of people personally (including myself) who use this kind of setup to test on external devices and also to share prototypes with other people on a team, especially during meetings. It's a feature, not a bug. \ud83d\ude09  For those who are very worried about accidentally leaking something in a coffee shop, I think it's up to them to take their own security measures. For example, it's not uncommon for companies require all remote development work to be done on a secure VPN.\n. Please provide a minimal example that demonstrates the issue. Stylus is working fine for me. \ud83d\ude15\n. If it doesn't break the other NPM scripts, I'd be OK making it conditional.\n. I believe at one point E2E tests used a superset of the production config, so I don't think that line should be necessary anymore since they're based off the base config now. Unfortunately, the way to test whether the NPM scripts will still work is to just test them manually right now.\nIt's on my list to refactor (or possibly rewrite) this template and add build tests, so that we can say with a greater degree of certainty whether something will have unintended side effects or not. Until then we do our best. \ud83d\ude05 \n. Ah, yep - didn't find it in a quick search earlier.\n. Oh, OK - I see what you're asking now. That can be accomplished with a custom handlebars helper - specifically, something like this.\n. @zigomir Do you know what's going on here? Did something change since this commit?\n. Can you please provide more information about your system (e.g. OS, node version), as well as a minimal example project that reproduces the issue? If you changed any configuration after generating the project, that's also important.\n. Haven't heard anything, so assuming this is resolved.\n. @zigomir can take a look at this later, as he knows more about the reasons for removal, but I'll just merge this for now.\n. @anishkny Is the current version not working for you?\n. Thanks for the explanation!\n. I took a quick look on my phone and it looks good from a quick glance! I'll try to do a more thorough review later today or tomorrow.\n. To keep things simple, I'd actually prefer a separate PR after this for Vuex.\n. I'm open to this change, though would prefer to just have static always compile to root, rather than providing an option. @linusborg @zigomir Thoughts?\n. @Sarke Options are a bad thing if they don't actually open up any new options, as each choice we force users to make adds cognitive load. They also make template maintenance more complex. If static assets always compiled to root, then it would allow everyone to do what they want. Users could build out their desired folder structure inside of that folder.\n. > I would feel that most people would want to put static file into a subdirectory as well.\n@LinusBorg I'm not sure that assumption is correct - for example, I think most people prefer to have files like favicons in the root (and actually, that's where they should go). So it could even be argued any configuration except for copying to root would be \"wrong\", unless users are also configuring server-side redirects for paths like /favicon.ico.\n. @Sarke Well, netlify and surge (two of the most popular services for static hosting) do actually support redirects, but yeah - it'd be easier for people to just be able to place a file somewhere and not have to configure anything (anywhere) to get it to go where they want.\n. This is something we've been considering. In the meantime you may enjoy vbuild, which was developed by a member of the Vue team.\n. Probably after it's officially released. It's still in beta right now.\n. No problem. We are actually using v2 in the webpack-simple template by the way. It's a bit safer, since it's a much less complex configuration, but even that we had to lock down to a specific version because of breaking changes.\n. It sounds like you're adding this to your other PR, so we can leave it out here.\n. @guidobouman Have you confirmed that the AirBnB config still works with these updates? If so, I'm happy to merge. Just want to make sure it's been at least manually tested. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Sure! Thanks.\n. Yep, thanks for providing the link @jbruni!\n. @plcosta That's what the src directory is for. The static directory is only for files that you specifically don't want to go through your build process.\n. I can understand the reasoning, but I'm not sure it causes enough pain currently to be worth the pain of the transition (for both maintainers and users). When I search for vue templates in Google (with no user signed in, in incognito mode), the first 3 links are this organization, then the components guide, then the syntax guide. That seems pretty ideal to me. No matter what people actually have in their heads, they can find it in the first 3 results.\nAlso to some extent, \"what's done is done\" - even if boilerplates might have been a better name to start with, current users may search for vue templates expecting to find this organization, but then end up confused when it stops appearing in search results.\n. Does this also happen for you on a freshly-generated project?\n. Are you sure you're actually serving the compiled files in the dist directory?\n. The static folder is for assets that don't change - you can instead compile to the assets folder and require the CSS file from there. I wouldn't recommend this workflow however. Everything will work better and more as you expect if you let Webpack handle everything, rather than running multiple simulataneous build systems.\n. @LinusBorg Is this still work-in-progress or ready for review?\n. Yes, as this template is for single-page applications, Vue Router would be the correct option to achieve multiple routes.\n. Since this is a usage/support question, rather than a bug report or feature request, I recommend posting this on either the forum or the Gitter chat.\n. I have not experienced this - hot reload works no matter where I put files. Could you provide an example repo?\n. @LinusBorg @zigomir Thoughts?\n. @LinusBorg Yeah, I like that idea a lot!\n. Closing due to lack of response.\n. We could add the code below to the template's package.json. That way, people would be warned if they're not using at least Node 4.\njs\n{ \"engines\" : { \"node\" : \">=4.0.0\" } }\n. I'll put together a preinstall script to check versions of Node and NPM.\n. While I like the idea, it looks the plugin isn't very reliable. I think not invalidating often enough would actually be worse than invalidating too often.\n. I agree with @LinusBorg. \ud83d\udc4d  Out of scope.\n. Oh, no problem! Please take your time - it's definitely not urgent. \ud83d\ude04  And sorry, forgot you were on vacation. \ud83d\ude2c \n. Btw, mostly for GitHub's record, this fixes #325.\n. Sounds good to me! Thanks for the review. \ud83d\ude42 \n. Thanks!\n. @MatthewOverall Docs have just been updated for using prerender-spa-plugin with this template. That one should now be a very simple integration. \nSSR, on the other hand, is a bit more complex and will be highly dependent on what you're using for the backend. If you want to build something with SSR, I'd first ask, \"Do you really need it?\" If you just need to prerender some marketing pages, stick with prerender-spa-plugin. And even if you need dynamic prerendering for a content-driven site, I would personally prefer to use Prerender.io or Netlify's dynamic prerendering before reaching for SSR, as they'll be much less complex.\nIn cases where it's important that prerendered pages always render the very most up-to-date data, I think it's likely it shouldn't be a SPA in the first place. If you're sure it should be a SPA and only SSR will do, then I'd use the hackernews project as a template, simply deleting anything hackernews-specific. Then you can selectively copy over whatever you need from this build. I know it's not ideal and we do want to improve the friendliness of SSR in the future, but that's where we currently stand.\n. This is a known limitation unfortunately - added or removed styles won't trigger a hot reload. There's an issue open for it if you'd like to add anything or take a stab at a PR.\n. Adding new packages usually won't involve touching Webpack (and shouldn't in this case). It's the same as any NPM-managed project. For further assistance on using NPM or Webpack though, I recommend posting your question on either the forum or the Gitter chat, as we try to reserve the issues for bugs and feature requests.\n. As I said, adding and using another package (Vue-related or not) does not involve anything unique to Vue or Webpack and we simply don't have to capacity to teach people how to use all the technologies in the JavaScript ecosystem. Here are some external resources you may find helpful:\n- Installing packages with NPM\n- Importing modules with Babel\n. Nope. See this template's docs for everything it handles.\n. Usage questions are best suited to either the forum or the Gitter chat, as we try to reserve issues for bugs and feature requests.\n. This is a feature, not a bug. \ud83d\ude09  See the docs.\n. This should work:\n``` js\nimport { directives } from 'src/directise/directiveOne'\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  directives: {\n    'directive-one': directives.directiveOne\n  }\n}\n```\nThough I'd recommend just exporting the directive config directly, rather than under a directives property in a parent object. \nFor future usage questions, I request that you post them on either the forum or the Gitter chat, as we try to reserve the issues for feature requests and bug reports.\n. Can you please provide more information about when this happens for you and on what kind of system? It's also worth looking through closed issues to see if what you're noticing is reolved there.\n. Agreed. A PR is definitely welcome in browserify-simple. We've also discussed changing the default build and that's still on the table. It's just a tricky transition to manage.\n. Since there's nothing we can do in this repo however, I'll close this. You're welcome to open a new issue (or just submit a PR at browserify-simple).\n. Glad to see a community project providing this!\n. @gkatsanos No, it's obviously not \"pointless\" or no one would use this template. You can see this discussion for more details on trade-offs we're trying to balance. Please keep criticism polite and constructive.. There unfortunately isn't a one-size-fits-all viewport setting for all apps. If the app isn't responsive for example, this would be undesirable. I'm honestly not sure if most users of this template are building responsive apps for not, so I'll leave this open for now in case other @vuejs-templates/collaborators have thoughts.\n. Just updated!. @iAlexanderMoon That's half right. \ud83d\ude04  More details in the comment here.. I definitely wouldn't add it yet, but when it's released, I think the default ESLint config should be vue/essential (currently only available in a PR), which only catches errors. That would also be good to include along with Standard/Airbnb, if the user chooses those options. In Vue CLI 3, vue/essential will probably be the out-of-the-box linting, since it's very non-offensive. It only halts the build if you'd actually get an error or unexpected behavior anyway - there are no style preferences.. Hmm, I'm honestly not sure. I haven't personally used the official Vue config for a big client project yet - mostly just small official or semi-official Vue projects. If there are folks in the community that are using it successfully, then I think we can go for it. I believe eslint-plugin-html should be unnecessary with eslint-plugin-vue though.. Heh, so actually, it's true that eslint-config-vue has been deprecated, but it will be replaced by rules embedded directly into eslint-plugin-vue. At the moment, it's being reworked to include many more rules and embedded configs.\neslint-plugin-vue-libs is what we'll be using for official Vue repos from now on, so it's not meant for user projects.\nSorry for the confusion! \ud83d\ude05 . @gucong3000 I think we should probably also extend from stylelint-config-css-modules, since vue-loader supports them out of the box.. @gucong3000 Does it work already? I thought we were still waiting on this PR being merged and for a new version of Stylelint to be released with that change.. I think it couldn't hurt, though I'd change build_config to build-config, since we're using kekab-case for all other folder and file names.. @adi518 @LinusBorg Another potential option is we could set an environment variable here with the port number, that is later read by Nightwatch.. @LinusBorg How's this looking to you?. @LinusBorg Sorry, forgot you were on vacation! \ud83d\ude05 . @LinusBorg Could extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin provide a possible solution?. I don't think this is actually a good idea. The real problem is that vue-material has listed Vue as a dependency, which means they specifically want to package their own version of Vue into the library. This is most likely a mistake and what they really want is to list Vue as a peer dependency. That's the correct way to avoid bundling the same package twice.. @blake-newman I think there should be a comma here, instead of on line 41.\n. It looks like stylelint can also lint scss and less, but it needs to be run again specifying that extension and syntax. See these usage examples.\nAnother question - what will happen with if .vue files use a transpile-to-css language?\n. Should be .stylelintrc.js?\n. Should say stylelint, correct?\n. The changes in this file should no longer be necessary. They were a workaround for a bug that used to exist in vue-loader, but it's been fixed now.\n. Should this be /build/webpack.base.conf.js?\n. Won't the above 3 lines be unnecessary if the standalone version is the default export?\n. That's a good point! Then maybe we should merge this even before a decision is made, since it future-proofs users of the 2.0 branch against any possible changes of the default export.\n. We're not using the routes export for anything, so I believe we can actually simplify lines 11-17 to:\njs\nexport default new VueRouter({\n  routes,\n  mode: 'history'{{#if_eq lintConfig \"airbnb\"}},{{/if_eq}}\n}){{#if_eq lintConfig \"airbnb\"}};{{/if_eq}}\n. With the change below, we can simplify this line to just:\njs\nimport router from './router'{{#if_eq lintConfig \"airbnb\"}};{{/if_eq}}\n. Hmm... this is a tough situation. On the one hand, if we're going to include Vue Router, I'd like to also set up some scalable conventions and demonstrate more router features, like including navigation with <router-link> above. As it is, <hello> is also a bit silly as a page-level component. I'd prefer a <home> component and one other component - maybe <about>. I also typically recommend that people only use the components folder for reusable components, rather than page-level components. I think it's better to have pages and layouts directories, where wrapper components from layouts are used as the root for page-level components in pages. \nAdding all this would mean a great deal more complexity for this template however. @zigomir @LinusBorg What are your thoughts? I'm worried that with this proposal, the people who would really benefit from out-of-the-box Vue Router integration would still be left with most integration questions unanswered, as they could probably get this far just from copying and pasting from the Getting Starting guide in the router docs. But adding a more complete Vue Router integration would be a maintenance nightmare.\nMaybe we should just have a separate template that includes Vue + Vue Router + Vuex?\n. I'm thinking since it's the dev server, NODE_ENV should always be overwritten here. Could we also place it a little lower and use the value from the config? For example:\njs\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV = config.dev.env\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Good point. I still think it'd be a good idea to set to config.dev.env though, instead of directly to 'development'.\n. This can be a bit dangerous actually, as any tasks relying on the exit code from npm run lint would have it suppressed. Users would have to look very carefully to see that this was happening. I think what you actually want is npm run lint -s, which silences NPM's useless error messages. Or, you can run these with yarn: yarn run produces only 2 additional lines when a command fails:\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\ninfo Visit http://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.\n. Does this have anything to do AirBnB linting errors?\n. This can be shortened to:\nrender: h => h(Hello){{#if_eq lintConfig \"airbnb\"}},{{/if_eq}}\nBecause parentheses-less single argument arrow functions are acceptable in both linting configs.\n. @LinusBorg Just pinging on this. I think once we update this one bit, it should be good to merge. \ud83d\ude42 \n. It's up to users how they want to handle this, but swallowing the exit code isn't acceptable here. Either way, this change doesn't actually have to do with the title of the pull request.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @mbicknese Just pinging on this. \ud83d\ude42 \n. ",

As far as I know, out-of-the-box support for PostCSS already exists:\nhttp://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/postcss.html\n.

Can you close the issue, please \ud83d\ude1b ?. Looks like you somehow did npm install --production and installed dependencies only but you need to install the dev dependencies as well. Mmmh, I wonder if it's a good idea to use a CDN when bundling your app with webpack because you may want to put vue+vue-router+vuex together into the same file.\nI also think this should be disabled by default (haven't tested yet). what do you mean by hacking for performance?\nI'm actually asking myself the same question for CDN \ud83d\ude06 Maybe it's starting to be a good time to start using them again. Yeah, to a certain degree:\n\nThere is still a protocol overhead for each request compared to a single concatenated file.\nThe compression of the single large file is better than many small files.\nServers are slower serving many small files than a single large file.\n\n(from https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-http-2-7083ec3f3ce6). I'll share with the team. If a user adds vuex while using the CDN feature, he'd expect to use the CDN version as well. What plugin? \ud83d\ude05  I literally wrote the code for you, I didn't test it but it should be working\nThe reason to include vuex is that it's also an official Vue plugin. Oh, but it's unrelated to the plugin, we're passing on the packages ourselves. Even if vuex is not part of the template we can make the experience much better by providing support for it (since it's an official Vue plugin)\n```js\nvar cdnPackages = [{\n    name: 'vue-router',\n    var: 'VueRouter',\n    path: 'dist/vue-router.min.js'\n}, {\n    name: 'vuex',\n    var: 'Vuex',\n    path: 'dist/vuex.min.js'\n}]\npackages = packages.concat(cdnPackages.filter(({ name }) => name in dependencies))\n``. no, building the array is unrelated to the plugin. How the array looks like **is**. I even wrote you the code.... Actually, this is not necessary once #913 is merged. @blake-newman Thanks! I didn't know it also worked that way. Can you keep it 2 spaces and add the default values as well: { img: 'src', image: 'xlink:href' }. this should be added only if vue-router is selected though.\nI think we could do something smarter that checks if the packagesvue-routerandvuexare present in the package.json and build thepackages` array at runtime. Can you make it dynamic instead? checking if vue-router and vuex are in the package.json file?. yes. yes, but here you're adding vue-router if vuex is in the dependencies. It could be something like:\n```js\nvar cdnPackages = [{\n    name: 'vue-router',\n    var: 'VueRouter',\n    path: 'dist/vue-router.min.js'\n}, {\n    name: 'vuex',\n    var: 'Vuex',\n    path: 'dist/vuex.min.js'\n}]\npackages = packages.concat(cdnPackages.filter(({ name }) => name in dependencies))\n```. As this is still true, can you leave something similar like:\nYou can change the port at `config/index.js` as well if you don't want to pass the option every time. if you don't want to pass the option every time. I think you forgot to remove this log \ud83d\ude42 . You should move this line outside of unit so it always gets installed. We need to remove line 38 and 39 from build/webpack.dev.conf.js\njs\n    // https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware#installation--usage\n    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),\nThe --hot is the only one needed.

Renaming it to cssSourceMap is of course possible, I simply chose the current name to match the productionSourceMap in the prod config settings. Maybe it's more obvious which does what when we leave them like this, with distinctive names?\n3. We can of course remove that last line, only added it for you anyway :-P\nWill make the changes for 1. and 3. later\n. Ok, agreed.\nSorry for not having pushed the changes yet, I messed up with a rebase on my end and have to correct it this evening after work.\n. @chrisvfritz I applied all changes as discussed.\n. publicPath != assetsPublicPath\nwithout an absolute public path, webpack fails to load split chunks when the url has changed (e.g. from using vue.router).\n. Yes, but we are not discussing assetPublicPath here. \n. when you use vue-router (or change the url history any other way), a relative publicpath (and most likely, also assetPublicPath will break your build. \nAt least I personally experienced that webpack will try to fetch chunks (from code splitting) relative to the current URL if public path is not absolute - which will fail if you are not in the root.\n. have you used code-splitting?\n. > This is still a bug \nI fail to see why a config setting's default value should be considered a bug, just because it does not fit your specific usecase.  If you need another value, change the config setting, that's what it is for.\n\nEverything builds correctly in both situations.\n\nDid you test with vue-router? Because relative asset Paths will break paths to your assets when using vue-router in history mode, which is a very popular usecase (or manipulate history API any other way): When you navigate from '/' to '/users', an asset's path will change with it, i.e. from './logo.png' will now point to  './users/logo.npg' - and the file won't exist at that path, of course.\n. When you build for production, it even tells you that the result is not intended to be used from file://.\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/build.js#L14\nIt's not a bug. It's a default value that you have to change if you want to do something that the default is not intended for. \n. And, as explained at the very beginning of this issue, an absolute path is required for code splitting. That's a fact. \nIf you need a relative path for cordova, no problem . Change the setting, done. \n. The question which is the bigger standard is not as important as the question what the default purpose of the template is. \nWhich is single file web applications, potentially big ones, which need code splitting (we advertise for it in various locations of our docs).\nThis template is simply not meant for mobile applications first and foremost. (and eg for electron there are templates provided by the community that are far better suited as a starting point than this one)\nHowever,, note in the config can never be a bad idea., so I will reopen this issue for that. \nBut someone else will have to pick up as I'm on vacation for the next ten days. \n. Yeah,  guess we should change it.. We accept PRs :). That sounds good so far, but I think there's one testcase still missing:\nLazy-loading a component in a nested route. The reason that this could be a special case is that for lazy-loaded components, styles are not extracted into the seperate .css file - instead they are injected into the page's head section when the component is loaded.\nThat means that with lazy-loaded routes, you may end up with CSS in your <head> that points to a wrong bakground-image etc.\nAs I said, paths in webpack can be very tricky... :/\n\nI agree with @mixedCase that history mode is used less often than a) serving an app out of a subdirectory (i.e. building to /app/dist and serving /app) b) serving from file:// (especially Cordova)\n\n\nTo serve from a subdirectory, just change the assetsPath. We should improve the docs for this (no matter what path we take in the end -pun inteded), though, and make it easy to customize it during build with an ENV variable or something.\nI don't agree with the sentiment that history mode is used more often. I get nearly zeroi questions about cordova on SO and our forums, and some about subdirectories, but many more about history mode. Also, this template is not built with cordova, electron or any other wrapping technology in mind. It's built for websites first and foremost, and I don't think it would be a good idea to turn it into a \"one size fits all\" mutant-beast.\n\nThat is not to say that we can't switch to relative paths at all - we still have to do some tests.\nBut if relative paths have problems with lazy-loaded routes and other edge cases, I would rather vote for staying with defaults that work best for a typical webapp, rather than something like cordova, which is not a focus of this template.. Please don't highjack issues to ask support questions. I saw you already asked on the forum.. I will close this because it's been too long and the template went through a multitude of changes. If such a problem persists, please open a new issue. Closing for inactivity.\n. That doesn't help. Open a new issue and provide details on your setup and steps you took. . See my previous reply, right above yours.. I will close this, eslint-plugin-vue is practically around the corner.. the default branch now uses Vue 2.0, so we can close this I think :)\n. I just added a couple ofg things to the 2.0 branch, and it works fine.\nBut we still should add a prompt/warning that this template now uses 2.0 by default - that is still missing.\n. closing for inactivity.\n. @mightlylal is this still current? What version of node & npm do you use?\n. ...and this is still happening on a fresh install with the latest vue-cli? Which OS?\n. seems to be something different in your case - different error message.\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/build.js#L23\nthis command does not seem to work on windows.\n. ...but this template does have a babelrc file... \n. fixed\n. fixed\n. import the config module just like in the webpack files, and read the port from it.\n. Yeah we should probably do that.\n. added PR #255 / #257\n. Merged \n. Idea: Maybe we should even add it as an option to the install process: \nWhich build of Vue should be used?\n[] runtime-only: smaller filesize, not templates in HTML files (templates in .vue files work fine)\n[] standalone: slightly bigger filesize, but templates from HTML files can be parsed.\n. added PR #256 \n. Exactly\n. Use -s to supress the npm errors. These will always show when the called script (eslint or whatever) exits with a code that is not 0\nnpm run lint -s\n. As described, it uses the port from the config file, not from ENV\n. This is a nice idea, but was not what I understood as the requested functionality from your issue #241 .\nCan you open a new issue for this? As the e2e tests use the dev server as well, we will have to change server.js to support both at the same time with different ports. \n. No, this still exists in the 2.0 branch (which is identical to the 1.0 branch except for changes nessessary to make it work with 2.0, which are very few).\nThe point is, it has to be added to the changes in nightwatch.conf.js of this PR as well. Can do that right now I guess.\n. Done\n. Yep\n. this is a webpack problem, googling this error message brought many results, the usual solution is appearantly to add this to the webpack conf:\nnode: {\n  fs: \"empty\"\n}\n(See here, for example: https://github.com/pugjs/pug-loader/issues/8#issuecomment-55568520)\n..which was already suggested in the previous issue #91. Did you actually try that?\n. That might be the problem as it can't work... \nClosing this as a \"solution\" was identified ;)\n. Well, you replaced fs with an empty module, so any fs methods will not work.\nYou cannot use fs in the browser, there is no solution to this, it's techincally impossible.. Well I don't really know what a CEP VM is, it's definitely not the usecase this template was built for. \nAnd generally this is a webpack problem, Vue won't solve that. . Hi @bluedarker,\nthanks for this PR. This looks very interesting but at the same time, makes the template config even more complex.\nWe will have to discuss weither this is something we want.\nPS: it would help if you added the two things (mutli-HTML vs. SVG-sprite) in two seperate PRs)\n. where do you keep those images before build?\nThe problem likely is: this \n- For non-bound src attributes Webpack (or more specifically: html-loader) can read those src paths and copies the files from the specified path to the assets directory in the build folder.\n- For dynamic, bound paths, webpack can't do that, of course. \nSo you will have to put those images into /<your project root folder>/static/ instead of placing them somewhere in /src/assets., because /static will be copied into /dist/ as-is.\n. Honestly I wasn't sure weither to add the two PRs of mine into dist, so I targeted 1.0 instead. \nOnce we switch to the 2.0-version as the default template, (which should be right around the corner, right?) we could merge 2.0 into dist and I think we can leave 1.0 as it is.\n. ...which would mean that old vue-cli versions will throw an error, or won't find the template anymore, right?\n. Well you linked to the source yourself above... \n. Oh.. Wait. If no dist it returns the template without a branch tag, which should download the defAult branch? \nThen we should be fine. \n. closing for inactivity.\n. This shouldn't be too hard:\n1) add a file-loader for video file extensions to this array\njs\n{\n  test: /\\.mp4$/,\n  loader: 'file',\n},\n2) to have html-loader replace src paths on <source> and <video> elements (by default it only does that for <img>), we have to add this as a config for the vue loaders here:\njs\nvue: {\n    // the template auto-generates the css loaders. \n    // since we want to change the default loader for HTML,\n    // we have to add it to that object.\n    loaders: utils.cssLoaders().html = 'html?attrs[]=img:src&attrs[]=video:src&attrs[]=source:src',\n    postcss: [\n      require('autoprefixer')({\n        browsers: ['last 2 versions']\n      })\n    ]\n}\n@rodzzlessa24  give it a try and let us now how it works.\n. Yeah, my code was a bit thrown together from the top of my head, but the assignment inside of an object definition was not a bright moment.\nYou have to do something that looks more like this I think:\n``` js\n// all of those requires for the webpack configs \n// at the top of the file are here. Insert this right after:\nvar vue-loaders = utils.cssLoaders().html = 'html?attrs[]=img:src&attrs[]=video:src&attrs[]=source:src'\nmodule.export = {\n  // other weboack configs\n  vue: {\n    loaders: vue-loaders,\n    postcss: [\n      require('autoprefixer')({\n        browsers: ['last 2 versions']\n      })\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n. That's a strange error. Can I see the component? Are you linking to a scss file in the template or something?\ncan you console.log the \"vue-loader\" variable?\n. What the hell, I realized my one-liner was crap, but why is that last thing not working?\n. I fixed this myself because I got this reported from someone else. as well.\nTherefore closing this.\n. what node and npm version are you using?\nvue-style-loader is a devDependency of vue-loader, so this should be fine normally, and in fact works fine for me.\nIf you still use npm < 3.0, you might have this problem though. As explained in the README, this template is meant to be used with Node  >=4 and NPM >=3 and is not tested with versions below that.\n. Please use the forum for usage questions and support, not old, closed bug issues.\nforum.vuejs.org. Thanks @vuchl :)\n. Please don't take this too seriously, but I  just came across this tweet a day ago:\nhttps://twitter.com/slicknet/status/782274190451671040\n. @chrisvfritz After thinking about this again: \nI don't know. I get the basic point that subdirectories make any 'target' directory possible, but:\n1. (-) Copying them to root by default seems a bit strange, since all other content besides index.html is in some subdirectory. So I would feel that most people would want to put static file into a subdirectory as well. \n2. (+) True, you can do that with a subdirectory in /static/, but:\n3. (-) But if people want to do that in most cases anyway, having them create a subfolder each time seems unnessessary work.\n4. (+) So a config option with a default value of /static/ would cover the default usecase (have static assets somewhere else, but not in root) and enable people to change this location if they want to.\n. Good points ... \n. This is a problem with your connection to github.\n. If you have a limited number of assets that you later want to dynamically require, you will have to use webpack's require.context feature to make that possible.\n. We were considering switching the default export to the standalone build shortly before the 2.0 release, and to prepare for either situation, we added aliases for both.\nthe runtime-only one can be removed now, that's correct. I will push the change soon, have some  other fixes/tweaks in the works to go with that.\n. this was solved with #314 \n. > just tried a blank out of the box project and run: npm run dev \n\nthere is a problem with .vue files\n\nThe issue that you commented on is not about problems with npm run dev, it's about the production build.\nIf you have a problem with the dev process, please open a separate issue. and add more information than \"there is a problem with .vue files\".\n. I just generated a new project, ran npm run build and started http-server in /dist/\nDefault page shows without any problems.\n\n. I will close this now. If you can provide a reproduction, we can re-open.\n. @chrisvfritz We should update the hint on the \"installation\" page of the guide accordingly.\n. Damn, sorry. \nMy fork must have gotten messed up when I tried to merge to upstream after 2.0 got merged into master\nWill have to re-do this tomorrow.\n. Seems I was missing some recenrt commits from the github repo?\nEdit: Perfect end to this shitty day: seems I messed up my local master branch somehow ...\n. No. We only want to add that alias to the webpack config if the user wants to use the runtime-only build. \nThe question could be changed into a \"yes/no\" question, but it is required one way or the other.\nI think it is working just fine this way. \n. The runtime build is the default export of the vue package, so you simply do import Vue from 'vue'.\nIf you select the standalone build, we add the alias to the webpack config for you, so import Vue from 'vue' now gives you standalone instead of runtime-only.\nDoes that help?\n. @chrisvfritz  It's ready \n. HtmlWebpackPlugin does that: \nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.prod.conf.js#L45-L60\n(Don't let the template strings ({{#...}}) from the template install options don't confuse you).\n. Also can't reproduce this, I have components in various folders and HMR works correctly.\n. Please provide at least the full index.html (preferably as it looks in the /dist folder when you ran npm run build) and main.js\nHowever, I assume properly registering the plugin with  Vue.use(...) will not work this way, because vue-loader also loads vue as a module to do it's job, and so you end up with two versions of Vue in the process.\nIf you use a build system, including the main lib that your app is relying on via CDN is probably a very bad idea generally.\n. I'm pretty sure my reasoning is correct. The same thing happens when someone decides to do:\nimport Vue from 'vue/dist/vue' \nbecause he wants to load the standalone build (why is this  bad idea (read the warning at the end) ?) \nFurther explanation: Vue-loader needs to import vue as well, to use the template compiler for turning templates into render functions. \nIt will assume that Vue is imported like this: import Vue from 'vue', and you, therefore, end up with 2 versions of Vue in the bundled result.\nIn your case, you end up  one version of Vue in the global namespace (from CDN), and one required by vue-loader. The router is added to the first one (used in main.js) while all your .vue components are referring to the second one (bundled with webpack).\nSo: Don't include Vue (and possibly neither the router) via CDN if you want to use vue-loader, I don't think that will work reliably.\n. Also, as a (very important) sidenote: this effect only happens in dev mode, where vue-loader requires 'vue' to be used in HMR:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/blob/master/lib/loader.js#L220\na production build or a dev build with HMR disabled would be fine. But who wants to develop without HMR? :D\nA possible solution would be to define vue as an external in the production config for webpack.\nSo in development, you import vue from node_modules via webpack, but when building for production, webpack assumes import Vue from 'vue' points to an external global and inserts it accordingly. \n. Looks fine.\nAdditionally (but not nessessarily in this PR), we could replace the render function in main.js with a template?\n. babel-runtime does not have to be defined as a devDependency. \nThis template works as it should for me, without it. \nPlease provide the following information:\n1. node version\n2. npm version\n3. Operating System\n4. Is there a .babelrc file in your project's root directory, and does it look like this:\njs\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"es2015\", \"stage-2\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-runtime\"], // this is why you don't need babel-runtime\n  \"comments\": false\n}\n. You run on npm 1.4 ? Current version is 3.8.*\nthat might probably be the problem. you should be using version 3.\nAs explained in the readme, this template is not tested with npm <3\n. I closed this as it is not a problem of this template.\nWe can't cater towards any problem that (highly) outdated tools may have with this setup.\n. LGTM\n. Hello ..\nThank your for your suggestion. Honestly, I think SSR is not within the scope of this template. It only makes sense when also adding the server, which would inflate the boilerplate significantly and at the same time, it won't help many people much as they would rather use koa/hapi/sails/feathers/adonis (... we could go on here...) than naked express.\nMaybe we create a separate template sometime, but probably won't add it to this one.\nAbout getting help: We encourage you to ask your questions on the forum  , Stack Overflow or on gitter and are happy to help you out there. Github issues are not the right place for support.\n. > but It will not work in some OS\nplease be more specific. an absolute path should work with every browser and HTTP server.\nIf you mean it doesn't work if you open the file locally - that's expected and mentioned in the console output during the build process.. > However, say, your production is served under a sub-directory of your domain\n...then you change the assetsPath to that sub-directory.\nThat's how webpack works, it has hardly anything to do with this template.. The problem with relative paths is that they don't work well with code-splitting and the router. . Hm, in that case i might have to re-test this. In my experience, .lazy-loading a Route component from a route like /users  (instead of /) will fail, because webpack will try to load the file from /users/static/js/.... instead of /static/js/.... @shah-newaz dropbox and similar synced folders are a problem as well. . Please use our forum or ask in the epo for vue.formular. \nWe can't provide support for individual plugins in this repository.. Sorry, this PR is to outdated. Will close this for now. Also want to clean up dependencies soon.. I guess what Evan means is that there is no real usecase for npm install --production when using it with frontend project like project like this one:\n- If you clone this repo, you chances are you want all dependencies because you intend to work on this project.\n- If you install this project as a depenency from e.g. NPM registry, npm will only install dependencies anyway. And since all the code is bundled, the best thing would be none of the (dev)dependencies would be installed.\nSo the smartest thing would be to leave everything in devDependencies, so that it's not installed in the latter case.\n. I'll re-open this for discussion for now. Still not convinced.\nWouldn't it be preferable to add the tested, build bundle files to the repo and simply pull from there instead of risking build failures on the production server?\n. Oh, that's my mistake, seems i didn't test this thoroughly enough in a recent commit. \nI'll fix it later.\nThanks!\n. it's fixed some time already, forgot to close.. It isn't. it's using ^2.0.1, which basically means \"the latest version that matches 2.0.*, but at least 2.0.1\". So new installations of this template would, right now, install 2.0.5.\nYou may want to familiarize yourself with semantic versioning and semver with npm\nHint: If you want to update an existing project folder that used this template, simply run npm install vue --save again.\n. well, the config you showed is only for vue-loader, which only takes care of .vue files.\nYou will have to add the same kind of config to the module: { loaders: config for /\\.css$/ files.\nSee postcss-loader docs: https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader\nPlease ask in our forum.vuejs.org for further support - github issues are for bug & feature requests.. Well, since the error explicitly states that the port is already used, there's not much we can do. I can certainly not reproduce this. . > According to this post, the HTML will still be minified by the loader even if you turn off the minify option.\nI don't think that's what the README says. minification would only be activated if we had an HTML loader specified, which we don't. The index.html is interpreted through the default EJS loader, in which case there's no minification, according to the readme.\nThe issue should be something else.. > What is the reason for this decision?\nWe like it this way.\n\nCreate-react-app puts the *.test.js files next to the src files in the src/ folder.\n\nsome prefer it this way, no problem.\n\nLooking at the boilerplate the only thing holding this back is test/unit/index.js which includes all /src files for code coverage. Is adding an exclude to *.spec.js enough to include my tests in the /src folder?\n\n... it would apper so, yes. Have you had any problems with this?. Seems useful! Is the improvement noticable?\nI found other issues like this one that actually saw slowdowns: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/979. Alright, I will test this on a project and will report back here.. This template is not meant to be tightly integrated into a Laravel project. For a tight integration, there's e.g. laravel-elixir-vue-2.\nIf you simply want to have it in a subfolder, just put it there, I'm not sure what guide is nessessary for this.\nIf you want to use the laravel app as the API server, make sure to proxy requests to it from the devServer.. check out /config/index.js, please. ou can change the publicPath there easily.. > eslint-config-standard@6.2.1 requires a peer of eslint-plugin-promise@>=3.3.0 but none was installed.\n\nin package.json, the version of eslint-plugin-promise is set to ^2.0\n\nThen we should adjust the dependencies in package.json and test weither that breaks anything.\n\nIs it necessary or possible to set the version of such dependencies to latest?\n\nThis might work in this specific case, but generally this is a very shaky subject, can make builds ver unreliable.\n. Well, feel free to remove the line if that does not suit your usecase. It's a template, you should adjust it to your needs.\nWe feel that opening the window is a nice helper for most scenarios, so I don't see a reason to remove this.\n. That behaviour is customizable since Nov 12, 2017 in /config/index.js. I don't understand whan the problem is, exactly. Can you explain please?\n. Wouldn't this setting solve this?\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/config/index.js#L10\nJust change it to either '' (relative path), or '/repo1/'\nBe caureful with relative paths, they stop working if you have nested pages.\n. Do you have the same problems when you try using it outside of vagrant?\nSeems it's related to vagrant - a guide to reproduce this would be helpful.. closing for inactivity.. You seem to have mixed a lot of other changes into this PR, like an update to webpack 2 etc. \nWe can't merge this in this state.. it's all good. If you still can reproduce the original fix, even as a new PR, I'm, happy to merge it.. this does seem to be entirely webpack-related and not so much about this specific template.\nAlso, we have a dedicated place for support questions (as opposed to bug reports): our forum at fourm.vuejs.org.. For future visitors: The \"WatchOptions\" config is now reachable in the template's config/index.js in the form of the pollproperty. Setting that to true will switch polling on in the dev-server's watchOptions. \nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/config/index.js#L21. Sorry, we won't update to webpack to yet.. > Some projects don't require dealing with CSS. It could become optional, as tests are.\nWhjat kind of sohisticated website/SPA does not have to deal with CSS?\n\nSimilarly, some projects only need Unit Tests and not e2e tests. Again could be optional.\n\nThat is already the case.\n\nDev code could be separated from build to a new dev folder (webpack.dev.config.js, dev-server.js, dev-client.js, index.html). And the same folder could be used to store project specific dev related code.\n\nMight be useful: Please Make a suggestion how exactly that should look, and define an easy to follow rule to help users decide what goes where.\n\nAdding more options would make it easier to start other projects than SPA.\n\nThe template is already quite large and complicated for the options it supports right now. I think it would be better to create new templates for totally different purposes (electron, multipage). Closing for inactivity.. Thanks! :) Will take this for a testride tomorrow, then probably merge it.. I will close this assuming @CodinCat's suggestion resovles this. Please open another issue if you still have probelms..

How did that lead to any errors for you? I have never had these errors .... @jiakeqi what npm version are you useing? I don't have such errors with npm >=3. Hello @znck\nThank your for your interest in this project.\nHowever, your issue is a usage/support question, and the issue tracker is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests (as outlined in our Contributing Guide).\nWe encourage you to ask it on the forum  , Stack Overflow or on gitter and are happy to help you out there.. We are thinking about /working on it. Closing this since this contains no further input.. @vance any update on this?. you have to tell vue-html loader to parse these attributes.\nHow to do this is explained here, and you have to insert those options in your wenpack files after this line:\nNot tested but should look something like this:\n```javascript\nvue: {\n  html: {\n    query: {attrs: \"img:src img:srcset\"}\n  }\n  loaders: //....\n}\n``. It seems thatsrcset` specifically is not currently supported by HTML-loader. There was an attempt to add this as a feature, but it was reverted: webpack/html-loader#79\nSo I guess you have to do this manually, by importing the impages in the Javascript and using a templatze literal:\n```javascript\nvar photos = {\n  1: require('./assets/photo.jpg'), \n  2: require('./assets/photo@2.jpg')\n}\nexport default {\n  // ...component stuff\n  computed: {\n    photos() { return photos }\n  }\n}\nhtml\n\n```\nIf your webpack config has a limit for the url-loader and you want to prevent inline data-urls, you may have to overwrite the loader:\njavascript\nrequire('!!url-loader?limit=0!./assets/photo.jpg')\n. @benjamincrozat is this still an issue? I know that for me, that nightwatch / selenium has problems with timeouts every once in a while, but nothing I could pin to this template.. Okay, will close this then. . I think instead of manually patching the generated HTML, we should update the docs by generating new files with the latest changes.\n/ping @chrisvfritz . Yeah our team has to do that.. removing double quotes is fine, but why add quotes to keys that don't need any? which eslint rule/preset does require this?. Thanks!. @posva @blake-newman What's the status on this?. @blake-newman @posva I think Blake's approach would be nice - but would take some time, right?\nCould we add the babel-plugin for instanbul for now with this PR, and work on the 'babel-vue-script-parser' idea after that?. (Sidenote: use 3 backticks oto format blocks of code. I edited your comment accordingly.). LGTM. Hello @DomenicRoti \nThank your for your interest in this project.\nHowever, your issue is a usage/support question, and the issue tracker is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests (as outlined in our Contributing Guide).\nWe encourage you to ask it on the forum  , Stack Overflow or on gitter and are happy to help you out there.. The /dist folder contains the built content that will be deployed. This is practically \"default\" behaviour for frondend builds in the industry right now.\nHave you read the docs? https://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/\nI don't see any issue with that. Do you have a specific problem with it?\n. I would rather change this line:\njavascript\n// from:\n  assetsRoot: path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist'),\n// to:\n  assetsRoot: path.resolve(__dirname, '../docs'),\nand then use this option for github pages:\n\nOtherwise, all your source code etc will be accessible through github pages as well, which you don't really want, I guess.. closing because it's deprecated, webpack has this as a real plugin now.. I assume you use vue-router? Anyway, you provide too little information.\n. Well, some code would be helpful. Also, you should see error messages in your Terminal if the devserver can't serve what you request.\nOr maybe you are just using the router in history mode and tr to access an url by hand through the adress bar? What exact steps did you take that lead to this error?\nI just tested this with a fresh project and had no problems:\n. @Vasiliy-Bondarenko \nAh, just remembered something: The devServer uses connect-history-api-fallback to serve index.html for any route.\nThis package doesn't like dots in paths:\n\nSpecifically, it will change the requested location to the index you specify (default being /index.html) whenever there is a request which fulfills the following criteria:\n\nThe request is a GET request\nwhich accepts text/html,\nis not a direct file request, i.e. the requested path does not contain a . (DOT) character and\ndoes not match a pattern provided in options.rewrites (see options below)\n\n\nThere's an Option to disable it:\nhttps://github.com/bripkens/connect-history-api-fallback#disabledotrule\nApply it here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/dev-server.js#L49\n... but I wonder weither that could lead to problems with static assets (images etc) that have dots in their path.. Hello @laahs,\nThank your for your interest in this project.\nHowever, your issue is a usage/support question, and the issue tracker is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests (as outlined in our Contributing Guide).\nSince this question does not seem to be answerable with a \"one-liner\" here, we encourage you to ask it on the forum  , Stack Overflow or on gitter and are happy to help you out there.. 1. Update your dependencies in package.json to these values:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/package.json#L16\nand\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/package.json#L85-L87\n\n\ndelete /node_modules\n\n\nnpm install. > rewriting @import './index.less'; again?\n\n\nThat's what you have to do, yep.. Nothing. This is a closed issue, the question was answered. \nYou may want to look at this, though: \nhttps://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader/blob/master/README.md. Then why the screaming? :D. Thanks!. I think stage-2 is far enough from the current standard for a default template. Whoever decides to go beyond that should do so on their own, IMHO. > Can I just npm run build and copy over the dist folder or something?\nExactly. all you have to upload is the /dist folder. \nNow, I don'T know the config panel of Heroku, so I don't know weither you can reference a folder within a repo.\nIf that is possible, I would remove /dist from the .gitignore file, build the release, push the changes to github and reference /dist from Heroku.\n . If you want to build on the production server, you should run the tests on it as well, so you have to install everything anyway. \nIf you just want to deploy the already built files, you don't have to install anything, the built bundle includes all runtime dependencies. . Well, that starts a development server, which is meant to be used during development only, as the name, indicates. I assume that you want to use heroku for a production or staging deployment, in which you would never run a development server - you will want to serve the previously built application from the /dist folder. \nThis is a common pattern for webpack based apps, and not specific to Vue. . Well, you can build in your CI environment and deploy from there, it doesn't have to be checked into git.. I don't think it's  good idea to not have eslint run when you build for production.\nYes, you can run it independently with npm run lint - but currently, building is not coupled to that. If we move the webpack linting config from base to dev, this would make it possible to build production code with linting errors. Not a possibility I would want for this template.. I like this.. Because I haven't come around to test this locally. And since there are no automated tests for this, I won't merge before I (or someone else) have done that. . Feel free to remove these lines if you don't like this:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/dev-server.js#L74-L76\nPersonally, I like that starting the dev server brings me to the website immediately. Yeah, this looks great. Thanks!. Seems resolved to me.. We use HTMLWebpackPlugin to inject this into index.html, and as far as I know, this Plugin can't do what you ask.\nSo you can\n\nrequest this as a feature for this plugin, or:\nMake the changes manually. Yep. . As a word of warning about @myst729'S idea: Without hashes in the filenames, cache-busting won't work. Wrong repository.. closing for inactivity.. Watching is The job of webpack-dev-middleware. \n\nYou can see the poll option in the example config here: \nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/master/README.md. @necevil does that answer your question?. wrong repo. already reported in the vue-loader repo.\nanyway, you should HTML-escape those chars properly with &lt and &gt. Those two plugins serve different purposes, as I understand it. We should definitely keep CommonsChunkPlugin in the production build, but the DLLPlugin can be useful in the dev build, I agree.\nHowever I also share your hesitation about the beginner-friendliness. In particular, I think that users who work on apps large enough to profit from this setup will have to be proficient with webpack anyway. and can easily add it, whereas users who use the template for prototyping or playing around may feel that this makes it more complicated than it already is.\nIf you have an idea how to incoprorate the DLLPlugin into the development experience while making it easy for users to deal with it, i'm all ears. :). > Now when you open the index.html\nBy that you mean that you opened with directly in your browser without any HTTP server, right?\nIn that case, the behaviour is expected, and can't bve changed by this template. \nWhen opening HTML files from the file system, the browser requires relative paths to read included files like scripts and images propertly. publicPath: '/' sets results in absolute paths, though.\nThis is the default because\n\nThis template is not meant to be used directly from the file system, but server over HTTP (it even  tells you about it in the console during build).\nabsolute paths are nessessary for code splitting and async components to work properly, especially when vue-router is involved.. This probably means that babel has not converted your code to ES5.\n\nDo you have a .babelrc file in the project root? This one:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/.babelrc\nIf this file is missing, that's probably because vue-cli did not have the permissions required to create it.. @learntoswim Your problem results from the fact that babel-loader is configured to transpile js files in /srconly, and you seem to have your mock files outside of that folder.\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L66-L68\nJust adjust the config to include the mocks folder and you are fine.. Closing because of inactivity of OP. @siempa So I ask you as well:\n\nDo you have a .babelrc file in the project root? This one:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/.babelrc\n\nAnd also; is the file with the error in the /src folder or outside of it?. Hm. Honestly, I have no further ideas. All I can say is that it seems that Windows 10 often play the role of a troublemaker in a lot of cases :(. > As you can see the alias for vue$ should now be set to vue.common.\nIt is:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L27\nNot sure what else can be done?. I would assume that you worked on an older project that was created before we updated the template?. It seems you are using a service worker? \nThat's not part of this template, so in don't see how this repository has anything to do with it. . @davidmoshal I still have no idea where this service worker is coming from. Have you found out more? . Ah that would make sense :). I'm sorry but this repository has nothing to do with angular or OneSignal, so i have no idea why you are asking here.\nThe only tipp I can give you is to check your chrome devtools under the \"Application\" tab when on localhost, and kill all service workers that may still be running.. Hi @faisalhakim47 \nThatnks for the PR, but I will close this in favor of #457, which includes this change amongst others necessary for webpack 2.2. closing in favor of #454 . you have to actually import the image in JS. then webpack knows about it as a depenency and can manage the path.\njavascript\nimport Image from './assets/image.jpg'\n// `Image` will not be a string, pointing to  '/static/img/img.1e7c8df.jpg'. Well, that's how webpack works for dynamic assets. You still have options, though.\n\nuse the /static folder as explained here.\nUse a dynamic require to make webpack require all images in one call, as explained here\n\nI won't go into much detail (for that we have forum.vuejs.org).. Please use the forum, as I mentioned in my last reply. \nThis is a closed isssue. . can't reproduce this.. Looking back at this, it's obvious: during unit tests, no dev-server is running, so there's nothing to do the proxy-ing. You will have to either mock the requests or change the paths with some environment variable during unit tests.. It's under consideration (#436). Not at all. :). https://webpack.github.io/docs/usage-with-bower.html. Not tested, but wouldn't it be enough to add this to the middleware?\n```javascript\n// devServer.js\nvar devMiddleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware')(compiler, {\n  headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" } \n  // ... other options.\n})\n```. Can we take a step back and re-evaluate the problem so I'm sure I don't miss something? I'm not sure that I understand your problem anymore. CORS is something that drives me nuts everytime I have to deal with it.\nSo: Where is the CORS requirement coming from? You wrote..\n\n.. except that it's not always so simple when facing Access-Control header restrictions, which often requires the API/Data/Backend server to configure CORS.\n\nI'm not sure what your actual problem is here. Does your backend API send a CORS header with its response that does not include localhost:8080? Or what exactly is causing the problem?\nShouldn't the Backend then simply send a different CORS header in dev mode?\nOn the client your typically don't have to do much for CORS to work, do you? . Since this issu eis quite old, and we will switch to webpack-dev-server in the coming days, I wil close this. If this still needs further discussion, please open a new issue with a reference to this one and we will see how to resolve this in the new envorinment with webpack-dev-server, if necessary.. 1. Test runs from us \n2. Taking the chance and generallt. Improving the webpack config's structure. . is this Windows 10?. Is your port 8080 already in use, perhaps?. Please try moving the project out of the dropbox folder. \nWebpack watch mode / hot reloading often has issues with it. . Agreeing with Toilal, adjust the include paths for babel-loader to transpile the E6 code from the node_modules subdirectory in question.. > I basically want my 'dist' folder to have a server.js file that I can run to serve my SPA.\n\n[...] My first thought would be to have a separate project that I could just drop the dist code into, but this seems a bit tedious. \n\n\nIf it's  an app that runs completely in the browser, then you don't need a server in your dist folder - just use static hosting like surge.sh\nIf it uses some kind of backend server (for a database and stuff), then yes, it's better to roll this as a seperate project, because it will have its own requirements and can hardly be crammed into the frontend template.\n\n. Please limit issues in this repo to stuff that is directly related to the template.\nFeel free to ask broader questions on our forum at forum.vuejs.org \n\nhint: you might want to npm run build and then serve the app from the /dist folder.. This is probably something that has to be addressed in the vue-loader repository, not here . Hello ..\nThank your for your interest in this project.\nHowever, your issue is a usage/support question, and the issue tracker is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests (as outlined in our Contributing Guide).\nWe encourage you to ask it on the forum  , Stack Overflow or on gitter and are happy to help you out there.\nAlso, when posting there, please:\n\nformat your code using markdown\nprovide information how you actually use this bootstrap-webpack loader in your project. Just show the code for this:\n\n\nI am importing 'bootstrap-webpack' in my main.js at the top of the file before anything else.... Commenting on old, closed issues has a high risk of going unnoticed. If you experience this problem, please open a new issue with a proper reproduction of the problem. . Please see discussion here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/808\n\nIn will lock this issue now, since that's vue-loader related.. > When i try to use axios, the requests are sent to http://localhost:8080 and not to http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.\nWell, the request will of course be sent to localhost:8080, which will then send the request to http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com - that's what proxys do.. vue-loader 10.1.2 should fix this, please upgrade.. Is .babelrc in your project's root folder?. Is this still a problem?. @jaredreich is that supposed to mean that the Babel polyfill doesnt work or that you don't have that option for some reason? \n@DevanB so including the es6-promise polyfill in main.js as explained in #260 did not work? . The Problem is that import statements always get hoisted to the very top of the file, before any other code.\nSo while the require comes first in your code, it runs after the import for Vuex has run. \nSolution: use require() for Vuex as well. . 1. The babel polyfill is really heavy, and polyfills much more than the Promise object required by vuex. I would rather use es6-promise.\n2. Vuex is not included in this template, so why should we include a polyfill that it needs? Smae goes for \"other stuff\"\n3. Not everyone develops for <IE11, many don't anymore.  I would rather have people developing for older browsers to include their polyfills themselves than forcing people developing for modern browsers to actively remove unnessessary polyfills.\n. @graingert Thanks fpr the PR. I think we should do the switch to babele-env, but I think we can improve a couple of things further:\nPolyfills\nAdd a new option to meta.json: \"Include polyfills?\" If yes, we should add import 'babel-polyfill' to main.js, which env will transform to only include what's required for the target browsers.\nDefault Targets\nMaybe we could include a default browser target definition to .babelrc so people can see that it's easy to change? maybe [\"kast 4 versions\", \"not IE <9\"] ? Just an idea, will be thankful to have someone with a better knowledge about browser support suggest something.. Thanks!. can you verify that the .babelrc file is in your project's root folder and has the correct contents?. How would that look from a usage perspective?\nI don't see the advantage from how you describe it. Currently, you can add more than one variable to the *.env.js files if you need to. Wouldn't that be enough?. So this never went on, right? I'm in the last steps of merging #975 which will bring a few new config options for the things you mentioned. \nHave a look and open a a new issue if you still think this config can be improved.. Did you change the webpack config that came with the template very much? \nEven if you did, the easiest way would probably be to simply create a new project, copy the build files over, and update\n\nwebpack\nwebpack-dev-middleware\nwebpack-hot-middlewar\nextract-text-webpack-plugin\n\nto their latest versions, then re-apply any changes you had done to the old webpack config.\nAlso, the migration guide on the webpack website is pretty extensive and very helpful:\nhttps://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/. > but users may confuse if they create some new directories in src and some of them conflict with npm packages' name.\nValid point ...\nI have no real argument for keeping it, so would vote to remove it. Anyone else?. I think we already have an alias for src. That could also be a problem when someone uses a package named src (didn't check but I assume one exists :D).. Created  a PR #516 . What plugin does this setting belong to? . closing for inactivity.. @squirmy Oh, that's a valid concern of course. Suggestions for a better character?\nWill have to try out $ or #. Doesnt that conflict with asset paths in css-loader? . I mean, in cssl loader, ~ is a special charater to make css-loader aware that the asset path is a node_module path:\nfrom the README:\n```\nTo be compatible with existing css files (if not in CSS Module mode):\n\nurl(image.png) => require(\"./image.png\")\nurl(~module/image.png) => require(\"module/image.png\")\n```\n. I think @simplesmiler 's  suggestion is probably the best.. @squirmy Thanks! that would have thje added benefit of eslint support.  Or would the eslint plugin also work without the babel one?\n\nWill have a testrun with it!. Ok then, I think that's good enough for me, will use @ -> /src. Sorry that this is still unfinished, had a busy week. Hope to finish this in a quiet minute in the next days.. Changed to @, but not tested locally yet.. Finally came around to testing this.. ~@/assets/img.png. We should probably adjust the docs a little to reflect that, even though the included aliases where never thoroughly documented in the first place. . No, it won't. The alias woeks on paths like @/components, not @components. . We're open to suggestions. As you can see in the previous comments on this PR, we discussed a few.. 1. As you can read in the docs of webpack itself, source maps in chrome are generally wonky and nightmarish. They link this issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/3165\n2. If something can be done to improve this general situation, it's not in this template repository\n3. I personally added #cheap-module-eval-sourcemap as a default to this template because it is a recommendation from the webpack docs and did work well for all tests that I did (around the time that I closed the issue), but that may differ for others because of 1.\n4. I closed the issue since a resolution to OPs problem was provided by two different people.\nBasically, we can try and switch the template's default to something that seems to work at the time, but mostly it's trial and error for everyone because sourcemaps suck. . Sorry, will have to close this PR. \nFor now, the absolute path will stay, because relative paths cause vArious problems with vue-router (mostly in history mode) and lazy loading. \nWe should rather introduce documentation that explains when to use absolute or relative paths and what to watch out for. . But main is already in the default value for resolve.mainFields. \nSo I don't understand your request. Can you clarify?\n. Well, browserify is not a standard field for that usage, and the next thing to a standard for this is the browser field, which is supported by webpack by default:\nhttps://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec\nWe can't support every strange vairation some projects may require, and this one won't make it into the template.. Hey, thanks for this! \nI think we won't merge this yet as we still are not sure what test support lib we want to add - a few different ones for vue were repressed recently, and we want to evaluate all of them before we decide. \nWill report back when we know more, ok? . Closing because we will be using github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils once they are officially released.. This template is deprecated in favor of vue-cli 3. We will not add any new features or major updates to it.. vue-cli 3 does everthing this template does and more out of the box. \nhttps://cli.vuejs.org. Will add this to the default config.. Change this after merging #501 . done.. Wouldn't that break when we use vue-router in history mode? as soon as we navigate to some route, the relative path be wrong.... Related PR: #541 . > because the font's URL is relative to the CSS file\nOh, right. Still wanna test it to be sure, webpack can be ticky with paths and stuff :D. I'm currently setting up a test with lazy-loading routes, asking for a little more patience. thanks :). So I tested it, and it's like I thought: When using history mode for the router, CSS stops working with this change for these scenarios:\n\ndirectly visiting a subroute (refresh the browser while on a subroute) (this also breaks in dev, because the relative link to the css file in the <head> is wrong now)\nusing lazy-loaded routes (\"only\" breaks in production, because of the following:)\n\nWhen we are at /test1/subtest1, then the SubTest1 component injects its CSS into the head in a <style>tag, with tese relative paths, e.g. ../fonts - which now points to /test1/fonts - which doesn't exist.\nSo, to summarize:\n\nIf we leave absolute paths for assets, those don't work with relative publicPath in webpack if the app is served from a subdirectory.\nIf we change it to relative paths, then lazy-loaded route components with vue-router produce invalid CSS paths to assets.\n\nNeither are optimal. But if I have to choose, I would vote to stay with absolute paths (for both assets and publicPath). Why?\n\nWith absolute paths, every app can be made to work in any subdirectory with a change of the assetsPublicPAth to match the subdirectory and a rebuild.\nBut with relative paths, Someone working at an app that is working great in dev, would have to somehow switch over from relative to absolute paths as soon as he wants to use lazy-loaded routes (which is a very common usecase for any bigger app).\n\nUnless we find a way to make the second scenario much more user-friendly than it is now, I think we have to stay with absolute paths, or find a way to offer both ways as an easy to switch configuration option.. have the repo locally, will upload it to GH tonight.. Wanted to, but had trouble to reliably replictae the scenarios. Either way, relative paths seem to be brittle at best.\nWill probably upload the repo tonight anyway - I hop you can find your way around the codebase with a few pointers in the readme.. So here's the repo: https://github.com/LinusBorg/webpack-template-test-relative-paths\nEdit: renamed the repo to remove stupid typos :D. Hm, that seems odd.. No, that should work fine.. Vuex uses Promises, so those have to be polyfilled it one wants to support browsers that don't support them natively yet (read: IE <=11).. @simplesmiler Yeah we are aware of that.\n@sudo most of the stuff that tranform-runtime would might polyfill (especially Promises) is available in modern browsers, but might fail in IE11 or even safari. No, that's not what I meant. What I mean is:\nIf we remove the tranform-runtime (or deactivate the automatic polyfill feature it provides), then you, the developer, have to manually keep track of the polyfill-requiring ES6 features you use include those polyfills if you want to make your app work with out-of-date browsers.\nI think we can counter-balance that by switching the es2015 preset for babel-preset-env, especially this feature of that preset, so users can easily add the polyfills that their target browser needs. Maybe that could even be a new option in the setup process.. I'm not sure yet weither we want to remove it completely. the helpers part of the plugin is useful, leaving it ouot could clutter the transpiled modules with duplicated helper code.. @sudo-suhas \nthe ignore polyfill: false option should be fixed in babel since March, according to the issue you linked.\nBut I'm not sure the underlying issue is resolved. we switched to babel-preset-env, but still use transfrom-runtime. \nTBH I simply haven't looked into this for months and am not 100% sure what's going on under the hood right now concerning polyfills.\nDo you have any further results you can share?\n. I think we will leave this to userland for now. I don't want to further complicate loader configurations at the moment. It's on the watchlist to re-evaluate at a later time, but off the table for now imho.. I agree with @limichange.. I will close this since dev-server.js will be replaced with webpack-dev-server in the coming days (#975) - if this problem persists with the new setup, please open another issue and reference this one in it.. The first version could lead to mismatche for this alias because it would also match vue/src/...\nThe second one is better because it only matches require('vue). @xereda Which OS?. Closing for inactivity.. I will close this since this doesn't seem to be a serious or well-prepared PR, but likely a mistake?. If this is a bug related to thescoped` feature, the vuejs/vue-loader  repo is probably a better place for it.\nAlso, a reproduction besides screenshots would be helpful.. Hi there!\nI close this issue because of inactivity. If you want to follow up on this issue, please open a new one, and provide the necessary information (a working reproduction etc.) in that issue.. change the assetsPath config to ./ or /dist\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/config/index.js#L10. Since you closed the issue I assume the problem is solved. Great :). Hello @hanai,,\nthank you for your filing this issue.\nPlease follow the guidelines on how to report an issue. In particular, provide an example on www.jsfiddle.net (or a similar service) that reproduces the problem. If necessary, create a repository for us to clone with a minimal reproduction. repositories of actual projects will generally not be accepted.\nThank you.. thanks. That is working as expected. Since all 3 of your route components require moment.js, and its up to the visitor to decide which route to go to first, webpack has to put it into each of the async bundles.\nif you want to extract dependencies that are shared amongst your extractred asynv bundles, you have to create another instance of the commonChunks Plugin:\nI think it should look like this:\njavascript\nplugins: [\n // other plugins...,\n  new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({\n    name: 'commonsasync.js',\n    async; 'commonsasync',\n    min: 2,\n  })\n]\nCoincidentally, I learned about this just yesterday through this article:\nhttps://medium.com/@adamrackis/vendor-and-code-splitting-in-webpack-2-6376358f1923#.jyz1nf7v2\n...and haven't tested it. Try it out and see if that works as intended.. @hanai If that solves your problem, please consider closing this issue.. Note: index.html is also referenced here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.dev.conf.js#L29\nand here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.prod.conf.js#L54. the router has a base: option, check it out in the docs.. Since we switched to webpack-dev-server, this no longer applies afaics. Since this has no replies since Febuary, I will close it.. Well, you could simply point to another template for the index.html file here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.prod.conf.js#L54. Are you runing anything else on Port 8080, by any chance?. Sorry, no idea what that error means then. :(. Closing in favor of #1021 . Honestly, I have no idea where this could be coming from.. node-sass and sass-loader have to be installed by you.. https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/dist#explanation-of-build-files. When apps grow, the number of routes grows, with beforeEnter hooks and so on, so you might want to put thta in a separate file, or files.\nWith a subdirectory you can keep this all in one place without bloating one router.js file.. > Something about Uglify cannot parse es6?\nProbably. Can't say with this little information.. > Why this issue is closed?\nBecause the OP didn't react to my request for more information for several months, and an appearant solution was provided by someone else.\nPossible solution for your problem:  adjust include paths for babel-loader to include the library that appearantly is wirtten in ES6. since the component is in the /components directory, the path should be:\n../assets/images/background_test.jpg (notice the two dots). Well, your component is nested 2 folders deep (/components/pages), so you need ../../ to get back to /src.\nPlease read up on relative paths.. > Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../images/background_test.jpg'\nStill sounds like the path is incorrect - but as I don't know your project, I can't tell.. This is a variation of this technique: \nhttps://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-libraries/#manifest-file\nPlease read up on it.. You can't make webpack require a resource that is only an expression (which is only evaluated at runtime) - which makes sense, because the require could end up being anything, includeing a node_modules package, and webpack shouldn't pre-load all of those possibly hundreds of megabytes of files, right?\nYou can however use a partly dynmaic require string:\nhttps://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-with-expression. it's added now.. It's using webpack 2, so yes.. Thanks fpr the fix - but I think we want to keep this in package.json. We have more than enough cnofig files in the template root already.\n@chrisvfritz @zigomir ?. Outdated, this lib is not part of this template anymore.. because the component is called 'app': components: { App }\n. components: is just making it aware of those components. The template defines which components to render. . Your source files and config would be more helpful... Closing for inactivity.. This was solved by another PR recently. Sorry ;/. fixes #583. Just fixed with #582 . To be perfectly honest, I suspect that we won't find time to do this anytime soon, there's a lot of other stuff to do that has a higher impact. At least I won't have the time, personally - can't speak for the rest of the guys with certainty.\nWe are open to PRs though, so the community might help out :). I don't understand your reproduction description, could you just upload a repository with the settings required for the error?. Eslint itself only supports the official standard. And The Object rest spread operator is not standard yet, but widely used, e.g. with vuex' map* helpers. . Thanks! . Sorry, merged a different PR thgat does something similar (#854). Since this doesn't seem to be well-tested I will close this and not merge the PR.. Hm, that's weird. Postcss is active for .css files since yesterday, so airport fixer should be applied. I will check this out. . We didn't properly version for the longest time, but recently started adding a version number to the top of /config/index.js. I have a suspicion, but can't verify until tonight. However I already made a PR that aims to solve this or something related.\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/pull/1053/files\nYou might try to give this a spin. The PR itself is also not thoroughly tested et (it's WIP), but maybe it just works :-P. Thanks. Will apply that PR tonight hopefully.. fixed by adding postcss-loader for all .css files as well.. On second thought: Wouldn't any and all CSS be extracted into app.css anyway in production, since we use ExtractTextPugin?\n@ronjuch your thoughts? Am I missing some use case?. Geez forgot about this. Want to test it myself before merging, but makes sense!. I'm really embarassed that this hasn't been reviewed (and hopefully merged) yet, butit just slipped my mind over and over, and I want to test it out for myself before merging, not because I don't trust you, but because I want to understand what's going on, and I'm a practical learner.\nSo I will definitely try to do this within the next 10 days. Feel free to ping me if I let it slip again.. @ronjouch I just re-read the issue #598 and now I'm a bit confused - should we include .vue files in the check or not? which variant has been \"battle-tested\"?. that's a very helpful comment.\nOn a serious note I don't understand what the problems were that people were having, both @import in style blocks and require() calls in the javascript simply work. This template is preconfigured for that, and always has been.. FUC can normally only happen if you write some markup in index.html.  if you write everything in components (including App.vue), that should not happen. . This would mean that we now have a folder static/root that behaved differently than other directorys. \nI don't really like this as a feature for the template. \nThere would have to be a widespread use case to warrant this. . I'll close this for inactivity . just do npm run unit --no-single-run (or was it npm run unit -- --no-single-run ?)\nIt's a Karma option: https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/configuration-file.html. Edit : redacted . tildes are not necessary for urls in templates. They are a special syntax used by css-loader.. The alias works like @/assets. And in CSS, it would be ~@/assets\nPlease ask further questions on forum.vuejs.org. Furthermore, tildes are only useful in CSS. . Makes sense! :D. @chrisvfritz eslint-plugin-vue will soon be ready, so I'm thinking about this.\nSince that plugin only comes with vue-related stuff, should we really add it as a choice like \"standard\" and \"airbnb\"? It can exist with both.\nI'm currently in favour of simply adding it whenever eslint is chosen, period.. Can you share a repo? this usually works exactly like that.. You likely set the same class somewhere else, with z-index: 1\nDuring production, all CSS is extracted in one file and minified, which also removes duplicate definitions - and in this case, the duplicate with z-index: 1 was the \"survivor\".. > For example, I set z-index:  2 in a.js, then I import it at b.js, and override z-index:  3 , it wouldn't work.\nThis is exactly what I am talking about, though. If you override global styles in a component without using the scopedfeature, the latest one will override all other versions. CSS is global by default.\nIf you still disagree, please provide a repository with a minimal reproduction for me to check out.. Ah I see, so at the root, this is an issue with css-loader / cssnano default settings.\nI think we should be able to fix this in the webpack config for css-loader.\nThanks for investigating! :). Hm, I'm currently trying to test my fix, but I can't reproduce the problematic behaviour, even if I set minimize: { zindex: true } in the css-loader's options.... Oh, I missed that, thanks for the pointer!. This is fixed in vue-loader 11.3.2. Sounds like this is solved?. Env variables in vue-cli are only used during build time (npm run dev/ npm run build), not runtime. So when you add any env variables in your server and expect them to be accessible to the JavaScript when your app runs in production, you are mistaken. . They are written before the command, not after it. Not sure what to do about that, closing.. Hi guys! \nWe are aware that keeping up is a problem with the current setup.. It that will always be the case for a \"template\". \nWe are thinking about how to best solve this with something similar to react-scripts or inferno-script s, but so far haven't found the time to really work on this. . Just as a small note: We ware actively planning a rewrite of this template that will extract the (webpack) config into a dependency, which will make updates more painless.\nSince this is being worked on, I will close this for now.. I think when work is actually going ahad to something wotrh noting, we will open a new issue.. I haven't come across this error, how did this happen for you? \nIt's by design that css is not extracted in dev mode, and in dev mode, the extract loader should also not be applied. . Well then we should investigate why that happens - simply adding this plugin even though we don't want to use it in dev mode is not an appropriate solution. \nWould you be so kind to open an issue for th8s problem so we can track it? Thanks. . Thanks. . The point is that webpack is handling the import paths in the @import 'Debug' - and it uses node's module resolution, which probably picks up Debug.vue, when really you want it to pick up Debug.scss. \nTry adding the file extension.. Works well here:\n\nSo I Would assume this is a problem with your atom plugins/config. Which pluign are you using? I use linter-eslint.\nMaybe you just haven't enabled this setting, which is necessary to make linter-eslint work with .vue files:\n\n. Please consider asking on our forum at forum.vuejs.org\nThis template usually works very well with es6 and  IE, and by default all ES6 code is transpiled to ES5, so the problem is likely something specific to your setup or usage.\nThe issue tracker is not the right place for this.. From what I found through googling this error message, this seems indeed to be connected to the Java version. . Closing this as I don't think we can do anything about this.. Also, I can't really understand how this fixed your problem. . Mabe you just need to change the watch mode of webpack-dev-middleware in dev-server.js?\nSee watchOptions -> Polling\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware. Well, polling is not a default in webpack-dev-middleware for a reason. \nI'm rather thinking about making this an option you can activate in /config. 1. no idea why tests failed.\n2. Now I can't reproduce the original problem ... darn. not needed, Evan optimized this elsewhere. This is not enough information, I don't understand your problem. With this template, Babel should transpile classes to ES5. Your error sounds like you did this:\njavascript\nvar something = YourClass()\nWhere you should do this:\njavascript\nvar something = new YourClass(). Closing for inactivity.. Thanks! . Since we will shortly switch to Jest (#817), this is soon obsolete.. Thanks for this suggestion.\nHowever, we currently don't want to make the template heavier by adding more questions in the initial setup. Also, Service Workers would rather be a topic for a special \"PWA\" template.\nWe will overhaul this template soon anyway, hopefully in the coming weeks, so I will close this request for now. This feature should be added in another template.. Hi @maoberlehner,\nThanks for contributing. However I don't think that we should add PWA support to this template - primarily because vue-cli 3 will come with (opt-in) support for it anyway. \nSo my general strategy for this template would be to not add any more bigger features, especially when they are covered by the new cli. \nI will make an exception for typescript support mainly because I wanted to merge the OR for this for about half a year and didn't get around to it... . Personally, I see provideplugin as a solution for some scenarios, but it can be abused quite easily. Injecting global variables is not a good idea most of the time, so I do t think that out template should actively encourage it but adding it as a \"feature\". Closing for inactivity.. > Well, semantic-ui kind of needs it real bad.\nWhy, exactly? \nI can understand that you want to use it because it saves you from typing import $ from 'jquery', but I know of no reason why it is needed. Others might say that this saves typing but creates code that relies on \"fake\" globals that aren't really globals, so it depends on webpack to work, which is why it should be avoided.\nA correction of my expressed view notwithstanding, your personal preferences are not a good enough reason to add another configuration layer to this template that people have to understand before deciding wether or not they want to use it.\nAlso, this plugin is 'really* easy to configure, so adding a convoluted config feature around it doesn't seem worth it.. This setting was added because webpack2 can handle ES modules itself - Babel doesn't have to transpile them. \nSo this won't affect browsers in any way. . Inject-loader can't work with ES modules,, which we probably want to use in our tests to mock dependencies - so for tests, we have to let babel convert to commonjs.\nOtherwise, modules: false can be used always, yes.. Thanks! . Hi @goncy, \nthanks for this suggestion.\nHowever, I think this is a niche functionality for deploys like Github pages, and would only add another config options for all users of the template that they rarely need, but have to understand/learn to know what it does.\nSo I don't think that we should add this to the template.. @chrisvfritz I think this makes sense, doesn't it?. Given Chris' explanation I will close this PR in favor of adding eslint-plugin-vue as soon as v3.0.0 is officially out.. \n\nillegal operation on a directory, open \n\nPlease move the project out of dropbox and try again. \nOr it may ha e something to do with folder permissions. . Closing for inacivity. This doesn't seem to be related to this template.. Thanks :). Fixed, thanks for the PR. Ok I think we can merge this, looked fine in my test as well.. Will merge later when I have a chance to redeploy docs as well. . Thanks!. You still haven't given any explanation as to why your approach here is better than simply using pug-loader.\nWithout such an explanation I don't see  reason to consider this feature, sorry.. Oh, thanks!\nWell, this looks much better.\nI'm still a bit unsure weither we even want to give this choice in the initial setup, as commented here:\n\nHowever, I think we generally don't want to add special support for any template engine or pre processor.\n\n/ping @vuejs-templates/collaborators WDYT?. As I already answered somewhere else, you will have to use Object.assign() to combine the results of Vuex.mapState() with the normal computed property functions.. Thanks.. Thanks!. Can you specify what exactly you mean with \"the configurations\":\n\na simple and usual JS object for the configurations \n\nIt seems you are talking about environment variables(?), but that's not really clear to me.\n. ...and what does your propose change would look like? I don't really see how we would get around the need for quoting strings twice - or do you suggest to turn .env.js files into JSON files?\nIf so, that's not a good idea, as it would be very limiting.. Sure!. I'm, working on improving config with #1178. Will close the issue since further discussion can happen on the PR. e2e tests need to know the port on which the devserver is running. This change would make the port \"random\", possibly making e2e tests fail.. No idea how to reproduce this, sorry. Is this still an issue for you?. That's weird, but seems to be a windows&node/npm problem at its core.... Not sure what we can do about this :(. How big is your app? this process usually  works quite fast.\nOnce your app hits a certain size, things can get slow. There are quite some things one can do to improve slow dev builds:\n\nHappypack\nwebpack's DLLPlugin\nvaching compiles from babel-loader\n\nThis, hoewever is a topic to be discussed on forum.vuejs.org or Stack Overflow etc., so i will close this.. Closing for inactivity.. This should simply work, provided that sass-loader is installed. \nThe code line you changed certainly was and is scss: generateLoaders('sass'), so i don't know why yours was scss: generateLoaders('css') as you say.\nBut good that it works for you now.. Thanks!. That env variable you created is only available in the node process that runs webpack and its config. \nIn order to make webpack aware that this env variable should be defined during bundling for your scripts, you have to add it here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/config/dev.env.js\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar merge = require('webpack-merge')\nvar prodEnv = require('./prod.env')\nmodule.exports = merge(prodEnv, {\n  NODE_ENV: '\"development\"'\n  API: JSON.stringify(process.env.API) // necessary so tht webpack injects the value including the \"\" quotes, as astring.\n})\n```\n...and similarly, in the other env files of the /config directory.\nIf you need further support, please open a thread on forum.vuejs.org.\nGithub should be used for bugs/features. I won't reply here. Thanks for understanding.. Go to forum.vuejs.org and ask there, please. \nUnless you can reproduce with a fresh install of the template, in that case, open a new issue with a reproduction. . I'm not sure about this.\nWhen people use vuex, they have to add a promise polyfill in their app anyway, so adding that polyfill here might at best be unnecessary and at worst conflict with their choice the made in their app code (like bluebird).\nThe template itself doesn't support vuex as an init option (yet), so I don't think we should add that.. We could certainly be more specific in vuex docs, feel free to open an issue for this in vuex' repository.. @nothingrandom Not a bad idea at all. HMR doesn't like brackets / parethesis as well. Would be a nice hint to give users.. In /test/unit/index.js you find this piece of code on the bottom:\njavascript\nconst srcContext = require.context('../../src', true, /^\\.\\/(?!main(\\.js)?$)/)\nsrcContext.keys().forEach(srcContext)\nIt uses webpack's require.context() to require all modules in a folder (and subfolders). This function accepts a regex, we use it to exlcude main.js, but you could use it to exclude /components as well.\nIf you need further assistance, please consider asking on out forum.vuejs.org so Github issues can focus on bugs, thanks!\n. It's supported insofar as webpack is proceonfigured to handle it as well as less, postcss, stylus, but we don't install all of those loaders by default.. > what is the reason to assume that pre-configured sass supporting\nThis it's documented here for everyone to know\n\nwhy just put it into devDependency to avoid confusion for users.\n\nas I said, we don't want to install unnecessary dependencies.\n\nPeople who use template may be even not familiar with webpack and sass-loader.\n\n\nThis template has extensive docs, users should read them.\nThis template is not a framerwork that aims to keep you from learning webpack. It's only a starting point to set up projects quickly.. you should look into the \"externals\" option of webpack. That will keep these depencencies out of the bundle.\n\nBut you would have to add them to index.html yourself.. I'm not aware of any webpack plugin or similar tool that will do this for you, so I don't think we can easily make this possible in this template.\nMaybe ask on our forum.vuejs.org to see what other people can come up with.. > I wonder why not use default value true or remain unchanged as people can just edit the config? Now with value:false \nWhat value are you talking about? where do you set this?\nEdit: Oh, you mean this? No idea why that's set to false, actually (wasn't added by me). \nPlease open a new issue so we can track this while I try to clarify with the other why this was set and if we can change it.. Will revert his. I already tried to revert this PR, but failed to remove the symlinks line. Just gimme a sec.. >  e2e tests can not be done with the unit test stack?\nExactly.. This issue is outdated.. So if I understand this correctly, this will only require .js and .vue files for coverage?. I don't see how this has anything to do with this template. Please ask on our forum.vuejs.org or Stack Overflow and similar places.. Closing this as version is already surpassed.. Looking at #200, #530, 541 this is not as simple as it looks. It's ok for a simple app but needs thorough testing for apps using vue-router and/or lazy loading of code-split components.\nSince local usage is not the focus of this template, we will rather keep settings in place that work well with those technologies, which we expect most devs will use when writing a biger app with this template.\nSince this topic is already discussed in the other mentioned issues and PRs, I will close this as a duplicate.. I'm not too convinced that we should add another config file to the template people have to know about (\"what is this for? should I do something with it?\"), especially when it's about something like ternjs (which is a great project, but ...) which is not required to use this template's functionality and olny used by a fraction of developers.. Since this is already being discussed on the forum, I will close this:\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/using-vue-cli-webpack-template-how-to-change-publicpath-correctly/10485. That's now a setting in /config.... https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader#fix-default-false. We will re-write the testing story soon, vue-test-utils will be added to this template and we will switch the test runner to jest.\nI will close this for now, But rest assured that the upcoming changes will cover this better.. This is a question to ask on our forums.\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org\nOr Stack Overflow etc.. in /build. I will close this since I don't think we will add anything of the sort to this template. \nIf you need help with implementing this for yourself, go to forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org. This template doesn't use webpack-dev-server, it uses a custom express server with webpack-dev-middleware.\nSo you have to enable https in that express server.\nThe code of that server is found in /build/dev-server.js\nA tutorial about how to use HTTPs with express can be found here:\nhttp://blog.mgechev.com/2014/02/19/create-https-tls-ssl-application-with-express-nodejs/\nFurther questions should be asked on our forum @ forum.vuejs.org. eslint-loader is configured for .js and .vue files, so I don't see what should not be working. Can you elaborate?. > You can quickly try it yourself and see it doesn't work.\nPlease at least name the package that you loaded the .vue file in question from, as well as the file itself.\nBecause I haven't come across such a problem yet, and the vue-loader config does not exclude node_modules (which the config for babel-loader does, for example), so it should work.. Seems like this is resolved and can be closed, great! . /config/index.js is not the webpack config, it's just a small config file for paremters used in the webpack config.\nThe webpack config can be found in the /build directory, and this is where you have to add this plugin.. We will definitely consider this. The question not if, just when.. We'll shortly be switching to Jest (#817) so Karma will only coexist as a \"deprecated\" alternative for a while.. seems resolved in karma.. > Actually, I think the Babel's comment configuration is not necessary because the Uglify plugin will do that on the later stage.\nYeah, that makes sense and will update the .babelrc config accordingly.. In my opinion, There's no need to add it to the docs because it's the default value. \nBack when this issue was relevant, we had comments: false in the Babel config, but that was months ago. \nAdding something about this to the doc would be starting a list of \"don't do this\" about general webpack features. . This is likely not related to yarn, but some other environment you use (dropbox /docker / vagrant ...) which interfers with webpacks default way of watching files for changes. \nHowever, polling is not a very performant way to watch files, so we should make this optional. I just submitted a PR for that (#946 ), before finding yours.\nI hope it's ok if I close yours in favour of mine, which adds a more flexible config option.\nGreets, Thorsten.. It seems some other PR already implemented this. Sorry :/. See comments in #743 . I would change this line to:\njavascript\nif (!process.env.NODE_ENV) {\n  process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'\n}\nThen you should simply be able to run\n```\nNODE_ENV=development node build/build.js. I don't know what you mean by \"multi compiler\".. I don't feel like merging this if \n\nIt can lead to accidentally removing used CSS\nthe project doesn'T seem to be well-maintained.\n\nI also don'tt think an opt-in is a solution, since in my opinion, people should only add this if they know what they are doing. Asking them ahead in the questionnair leads to people generating projects with this tool even though they don't know about its limitations.\nBut thanks for your work on this!. Well, I simply don't know this tool and don't plan on learning it extensively. SO to merge a PR that adds this, I would reuire extensive tests for:\n\nusage with normal CSS\nusage with scoped CSS enabled\nusage with CSS-modules enabled\nwith and without ExtarctText\n\nOtherwise I will be left with a template containing a tool I don't know, and not knowing what to do if the inevitable issues pop up about \"CSS is wrongly left out in case X\". I haven't really understood in what context this is useful.... This won't be an issue after #975 I assume. Please be so kind to open a new issue / PR if this persists after #975 has been merged. W already merged another PR that does something similar.\nPlease review the changes we made -if you think those can be further improved, we welcome a nother PR from you.. I'm sorry but this has nothing to do with this template. I suggest to ask the node / npm guys on StackOverflow or a similar place.. this repository uses CircleCI, yes.\nThe projects created from this template don't have any CI solution preconfigured or anything, though.. There's still some plugins that we rely on that have to release compatible versions (` extract-text-webpack-plugin andhtml-webpack-plugin` among them) so we will wait for those issue to resolve before we make the jump.. Do you know what issues exist with inject-loader with webpack 3?. Thanks for the heads-up! I guess we should be looking to upgrading this template now. . So I was looking into this again, and it seems that there is a general problem with that html-webpack-plugin:\nhttps://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/680\nSo think we should implement the workaround of https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/751#issuecomment-309955295 in our template until the problem for that pluign has been resolved by its maintainers.. yep, that's all, pretty much.. I just submitted a PR for webpack 3 here, you can easily check it out with\nvue init webpack#webpack_3\nIt would be great if a few folks could take this for a quick spin and report that everything is working for them.. Tests fail b/c of selenium not starting up. unit tests work, that's good enough in this case.... thanks. Sorry, I already merged another PR that did the same. Thanks for your contribution nontheless!. Thanks!. That Question needs a verb, at least.. Hey, thanks for wanting to help out! \nFirst, let me start by saying sorry that we haven't added everything people wish to this template. It's always a task to balance approachability and complexity. \nThat being said, if you want to start a more broad / sophisticated setup, that's fine. We can also accept it into this organization if it fits, i.e. It's different enough to this template so it's clear what use case the different templates address. \nSo I can't promise anything yet, but if it fits, sure! \nWe did the same for the pwa template recently. . thanks. Thats's probably a question to ask on our forum or in the repository of that plugin.. @nickmessing is this good to merge for you?. Leave have a look  at #1218. I took a bit more ambitious approach to improve the testing story for the template. . Thanks for reporting this! Yes, a PR would be very welcome :). Thanks!. You updated webpack to 3.0.0, but the html-webpack-plugin isn't fully compatible with that version yet, afaik. That's why we didn't update the template yet.\nSee #751 \nSolution: downgrade to 2.6.*. Thanks!. Please use our forum @ forum.vuejs.org for usage questions.. No worries. Will try and help over on the forum when in post and I have a minute. . Please use forum.vuejs.org for support about how to use or extend the template for individual cases.. your project appearantly didn't transpile the arrow functions to  ES5, and uglify can't work with ES6.\nPlease check if you have a .babelrc file in your root directory, like this one:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/.babelrc. I can't reproduce this.\n\n. closed for inactivity. Sure!. I think this makes sense. Sorry for overlooking it for so long.. I suggest to use forum.vuejs.org for support questions instead.. Thanks!. This was done this way because it's shown this way in the README of friendrly-errors-webpack-template\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/friendly-errors-webpack-plugin#turn-off-errors\nBut if you don't have any issues with that \"correct\" setting, I can merge it.. It's hard to say what the reason for that would be if all information you can provide is that it happened \"after a enw npm package install\"... :(. added to repo, must re-deploy docs..... I don't think we will add it to this template - maybe it makes sense as a preset in vue-cli (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/589). Thanks!. Damn, merged into the wrong branch. reverted. need a fresh PR.. https://github.com/MorisHarA/app/blob/master/src/store/index.js#L28\nI think you have to provide all module paths, inthat array here.... Hi there!\nI close this issue because of inactivity. If you want to follow up on this issue, please open a new one, and provide the necessary information (a working reproduction etc.) in that issue.. @sudo-suhas I'm not sure about this. I add these to my projects as well, sometimes.\nOn the other hand, I don't want to add too many scripts to the package.json and blow up the list. it should be quite easy for anyone interested in this option to add it, and I'm not even sure if I want to have people use it that haven't even understood what it does.... While I personally like trailing commas, and as a consequence add this rule to every project while using standard otherwise, I agree with nick that we should stick to the defaults of the xonfig the user chose. . Thanks, nice work with the PR description also!. This was done intentionally. Because in unit tests we have to compile ES modules to commonjs if we want to use inject-loader or vue-loader?inject to mock a module's dependencies. \nBut we could certainly add the target definition to the test preset as well.. please provide the repository. This works without any issues for me (provided the vairables exist).. can'T run this right now, but have you tried setting the cwd properkly in launch.json?\n\"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\"\nbut TBH, I doubt that's the issue.. Since we can't do much about this I will close.. This PR doesn'T seem to be about anything, I assume it was made in error.. @nickmessing makes sense to wait for #5887.. Hey everyone. \nWe appreciate the hard work that was put into this  - and I will consider a merge, just have to take it for a spin myself before to get a feel how much complexity it adds. \nWe originally planned a separate template, but that won't happen anymore before we do vue-cli 3.0 - which itself is still in the concept phase. \nSo I understand that an official integration would be welcome by many people, and I don't want to let this work go to waste. \nThe only thing that's might end up in a \"no\" vote would be if this makes the maintenance too complicated - I'll see about that. \nUnfortunately I I'll be travelling this weekend to won't have a chance to check this out with the dilligence that's reuqired. . @ThePlastic then to be \"fair\", packages for all supported preprocessors (sass/scss, less, stylus) should be added - which imho bloats dependencies unnecessarily, but that'S debatable.. I have taken a first look, and it's looking good for the most part. Have some small points/questions but probably won'T be able to write them down till Thursday evening.. More or less, but not really. \n\nthe main entry point has to be .ts\ntsconfig.json should be provided \ntypescript dependencies are not installed\n\nJust check out the diff to see what UP did. \nBTW once #1218 is merged I will merge this next. \nI just wanted to have a flexible testing setup first to test the template with and without typescript in CI. . Thanks!. Note: I'm planning on updating all of the eslint dependencies soon, especially eslint 4. Could this have any influence on this feature? I don't think so.... Nope, was on vacation for 10 days, will do the merges this weekeend. . Doesn't seem to be directly related to this template. Plus we will be switching to webpack-dev-server in the coming days (#975), so this would have to be re-evaluated after that.. that's been done now.. Not that I know of. you might be better off asking on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org - this question is only tangetially related to this template/repository.. host address will be customizable with #975 soon.. > how can I manage subdomains (subdomain.awesomewebsite.com)? \nCan you explain what you mean by \"manage\" in this conext?. I'm not sure I feel fine with editor-specific settings inside package.json for this template. USers unfamiliar with that atom plugin will wonder what that is about, and it will only clutter the file for anyone not using that editor & plugin.. I understand that this can be a painpoint in a couple of situations, especially when you design tightly coupled components.\nWhat I want to test (but can't right now) is if it works differently with the default stlye-loader instead of our forked vue-style-loader which we use in this template by default and which does the lazy insertion I think (amongst some optimizaitons for SSR, but we don't use SSR in this template by default anyway).\nDefining the order manually is not a viable option I think, far too brittle.. There's ongoing discussion about this in the vue-loader repo: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/808\nSince this has to be resolved in vue-loader, not this template, In an attempt to focus the discussion in one place, I will now lock this issue and ask anyone interested to join us in the issue mentioned above.. @victorhazbun Is this still relevant?. Well, you set NODE_ENV to production, but still run the development webpack condig. \nSwitching the production config won't work perfectly as well, as the Dr server config is in dev. Maybe we can move that to base. . Oh, I usually use http-server when I want to quickly serve the built files locally. . You have my vote :-P. Okay so we got jest included - go get that 1.0.0 release for vue-test-utils and we can close this :). > I define place of auto injected files before included my.js file\nYou think that this is a placeholder defining where your scripts are injected?:\n<!-- built files will be auto injected -->\nIt isn't, that's not how it works. This HTML comment is just a hint, it has no meaning to html-webpack-plugin, which will simply place them at the very end of the body element.. No. Is there a specific reason that you want this script in a separate tag instead of adding it to your app' code? You could, forg example, add it right after you created your Vue instance:\n```javascript\n// main.js\n// ... stuff\nnew Vue({\n  // ...\n})\nimport '../static/my.js'\n```\nFurther discussion should happen on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org\nGH is not a support forum.. When we started this template, webpack-dev-server didn't have all the features /customization options that we would like it to have, so we decided to use webpack-dev-middleware & hot-middleware.\nBut webpack-dev-server has improved other the last couple of months so I guess we could switch to it just as well. But I haven't compared the two setups in detail yet. We will do that sometime, though.. is this well tested with static files? Wouldn't this redirect requests for e.g. images to index.html?. We will shortly be dropping the custom dev server in favor of webpack-dev-server, so this PR, is no longer applicable.. Hey, we have a forum for questions, please use it.\nforum.vuejs.org.. We are aware that there's a need for a template for developing components/packages/plugins as opposed to a full app.\nThis template is meant for the latter. I don't think it makes sense to try and turn it into a template that can also create plugins/packages, because it's not just about some webpack options.\nIdeally, you don't use webpack to bundle packages for production, but rollup, because the runtime overhead of webpack increases the size disroportionally for small libs.\nAlso, ideally you build more than one version for production, at least: \n\nUMD version\nES module version (for tree shaking in bundlers that support it (rollup, webpack >=2)\n\nAs you can see, a proper template for this will work quite a bit differently, so it should be done in a different template alltogether, instead of shoehorning it into this one.\nAbout the question weither we are working on this: Yes and no.\n\nYes, insofar as many of our core team members have set up their own templates for this that are publicly available (see below)\nNo, insofar as for reasons of resources, there currently are no efforts in creating one \"official\" template from these existing solutions.\n\n\nAvailable templates:\n\nhttps://github.com/posva/vue-plugin-template\nhttps://github.com/ktsn/template-vue-component\n...one or two other which I can't find currently :-P. I just edited my OP with some templates. I know there are one or two more, but can't find them in my long list of GH stars at the moment.\n\n@kazupon should have one I think.\n@egoist has a more general template for npm packages not focussed on Vue alone:\nhttps://github.com/egoist/template-nm\n\nI didn't even knew rollup was better suited for this.\n\nSomething to read about that topic: \nhttps://medium.com/webpack/webpack-and-rollup-the-same-but-different-a41ad427058c. yes!. Great work!\nA thought though: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to make a hard switch to jest without any fallback for people that are used to the \"old\" workflow. Essentially, we would force everyone to either use Jest or scrap together a config from their old projects.\nBut we should do the switch sometime, so... I think I want to check out if it's achievable to support both, for a while, through additional/other options in the meta.js file. We could preselect Jest and make people aware that we will deprecate the karma/mocha config soon.. Absolutely!. @eddyerburgh running those tests is indeed a small nightmare. I was having the same problems while trying to switch the template's circleCI config to v2 - the questionnaire just hangs at the first question. \nSo don't worry too much about it, it seems to magically work on circleci v1, for whatever reason. \nI'm stroll looking for ways to automate the fill out of the questionnaire in any other way, so open for suggestions as well. . @sinaa thanks, will give that a spin!. Thanks for the hard work on this @eddyerburgh . That's probably a question to ask the team working on that repository.. Fixed in v 1.2.0 as of today. kagamiChan is right. . Without any exlcude: [] and includes[](!), babel, loader should transform everything coming from your node_modules directory. That would make your ptranspilation process veeeeeeeeery slow though:\nhttps://github.com/babel/babel-loader#babel-loader-is-slow\nSo, since babel / babel-loader doesn't have a mechanism like the one proposed by sindresorhus in the comment you linked to, you will have to add a seperate include path for every package in node_modules that needs transpiling.. You might want to read this guide on the webpack page:\nhttps://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/. You are trying to load a commonjs module meant to be used in node or webpack directly into the browser. That will not work. . Generally speaking, we don't want to blow up the questionnaire during init too much, because nobody wants to answer two dozen quesitons, when your answer to most of them is \"the default\" anyway.\nSo new options should have a really noticable benefit. \nConsidering that today, all you have to do to make this work is to install the appropriate loaders, I'm not sure that there's a good enough benefit in this.\nThe only exception would be JSX, which requires additional babel-plugins and config, so I would be open to add a JSX option.. Closing this as this will probably be addressed better with presets in The upcoming vue-cli 3. That element in index.html will be replaced with the one from App.vue when the app mounts. So this is intentional.\nBut nontheless, thanks for you willingness to improve this template!. Relative assets folders don't work well with vue-router in history mode. Particularly, asserts can't be resolved when doing page refreshs for any path but the root. \nBut yes, it's not well suite for dynamic deployment scenarios in subfolders, so we gave you an easy way to change it in the config folder :)\n. > I don't understand why this issue is closed?\nBecause @myst729  explained how to solve the issue.\nThe only general solution in this template would be to have babel transpile all code from /node_modules by default, which would make even small builds incredibly slow.\nFor that reason, we will continue to skip transpilation for anything in node_modules by default.\n\nI got tons of this kind of messages\n\u2838 building for production...[BABEL] Note: The code generator has deoptimised the styling of \"/home/***/Documents/WORK/EXAMPLES/vue-examples/node_modules/lodash/lodash.js\" as it exceeds the max of \"500KB\".\n\nThat's a totally different error (or rather: \"Notes\", as the message itself said) than the one discussed in this issue, so it's expected that @myst729 's solution doesn't \"work\".. Well, the solution was provided, just add the path to babel-loader config.. Thanks!. e2e simply starts a dev server for the tests backend.\nThe webpack config should transpile no matter which env you've set (or not set). . Hey, thanks for digging into this! \nWe should definitely fix this in the template. Will get to it when I find time - maybe we can ref actor these test / testing RMV variables into one. . In #1178 I consolidate the test & testing env variables into test, that should solve this problem once it's merged. Thanks for this. is there any info/docs that I can read up on this behaviour?. Thanks for the background info. Will try this! . @gucong3000 This looks great, but I'm worried that the circleCI tests fail, it seems the vm runs out of memory.\nI don't feel like merging this if it breaks tests :/. Okay, I'll push this as a separate branch to our repo and we'll see from there.. @gucong3000 I want to hold off with this PR until #1133 is merged, is that ok?\n. I know, I know :(\nAll I can say is thank you for being that patient with me so far... \nThese bigger PRs are always a bit problematic for me in terms of finding time to properly testing them. \nI'm also totally unfamiliar  it stylelint, so will have to learn the basics to feel comfort able maintaining it on this template. \nI will merge this and I won't take a moth t month to do so. . We will deprecate the karma setup in the forseeable future in favor of jest.\nFor that reason, I don't think it's  very useful to extend the questionaire with further options, so I have to close this PR.\nThanks for the efforts nontheless!. Thanks for the pointer. \nThere ar enot code changes necessary, but we should update the example in the docs accordingly: \nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/docs/proxy.md. What exactly is the remaining problem? We switched to webpack-dev-server, so we don't use the middleware directly anymore. We use the dev-server's correct api for this, so I see no problem remaining to fix. \nHowever, so if there still is something missing or wrong with our docs or the config, please let us know and I can reopen this. . Well, that's just the internal name in the template. We pass the data specified there to the proxy option of webpack-dev-server which then handles it internally for us.\nSo technically it doesn't matter what we call this field in the /config file. I'm open to rename this to proxy so it's using the same name as the webpack-dev-serveroption, but that's cosmetics.. You dont. That's the while point - you use the production api in you code, and webpack-dev-server proxies those requests to your test backend during development. \nIn production, there should be no need for a proxy. \nIf you want to switch api urls in development and production, you should rather read the template's docs about environment variables. . it should work well if you turn the assetsRootPath in config/ into a relative path.. This template will not add cordova support.\nSo this question might be better asked on our forums or chat:\n\nforum.vuejs.org\nchat.vuejs.org. https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/. You have to actually mount to an element.\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/a0c1wm6t/1/. @Kunigaikstis you are right, I was mistaken in this. Thanks for double-checking me\nThe real issue probabl has to do with his component failing in mounted because it tries to call this.$store.dispatch(), but this.$store is undefined.\n\n'[Vue warn]: Error in mounted hook: \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispatch' of undefined\"\n\nThat is expected if you render a component on its own without a store.\nI can only advise to check out how we do it in the vue-test-utils (currently in beta):\nhttps://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/en/guides/using-with-vuex.html\nWithout seeing the component in question, there's little more I can say. Since this is a usage question (not a bug), it should be continued on forum.vuejs.org. I can't reproduce this, sorry :/. Im sorry to close rid but there doesn't seem to be anything we can do... . thanks!. thanks. Will merge this to give it a try :). What is vuew build?\nThat's not a functionality of this template . Ah, I think you try and owe vue-cli build?\nNope. Thartemplate has its own build command, have a look in package.json. Please use our forums (forum.vuejs.org) for support a questions, or open a proper bug report issue with a reproduction. . Closing for inactivity.. .js is the default file extension for any javascript app. I don't think that it's a good idea to change that, I feel it would be counter-intuitive for anyone who worked iwith webpack before.\nThis being a boilerplate there's nothing wrong with changing that if it better fits your workflow, but I think the default should be as close to a \"normal\" webpack config as possible.. @chrisvfritz What do you think about this? Might make sense.... thanks :). Babili is still in its early stages, it's not \"battle-tested\" yet. Speed and size reductions are inferior to Uglify.\nThose reasons make me think it's not a good fit for such a widely adopted template as this one.\nBut we could add code comments and/or documentation to make people aware that they can use this when they choose to compile to a different target than ES5.. I'd say that its the responsibility of the package owner to provide a version compiled to ES5. \nOr at least make users aware that its using ES6.\nOtherwise devs who have to serve ES5 to their end users have to transpile all of their node_modules which would be a huge overhead. . Thanks!. Simply removing it is not a good idea, we still want to have an example of how to use environment variables. Could you come up with a small one-liner like we currently do with the debug example?. Perfect, thank you :). you can use this template with yarn.\nWe won't include rollup because it's not suitable for bigger apps (no code splitting), which this template is meant for.\nWe want to create a template for creating Vue libraries, and if we manage to create it, it will certainly use rollup for bundling.. Hey, \nThanks for this PR. However, we are planning to switch to JEst as the preferred test runner. We will keep the current option of running karma available for a while as people are used to it, but I doubt that we want to add a similar alternative like yours to the list.\nHowever, we are in the planning stages for vue-cli 3 (see the vue-cli repository), and for that version, we plan on making something like different presets available. That might be a way to make this an optional \"add-on\" in a future version of our template system.\nBut I will close this PR because it's currently not a fit for where this template itself is going right now.. Hey, thanks for tour contribution. \nHowever we are coherently evaluating if we want to a itch karma for something else, but haven't decided yet. \nSo this issue + PR will have to wait until we have settled on the future solution. . Update: We will swithc to jest (#817), so as explained in #874, this will not be happening.. thanks. Oh damn, that was my mistake for merging it like this. Will correct in a second!\nThanks for reporting it!. Will fix this adap, but might take a couple of hours until I get to a computer . Closing as a duplicate. Hm, maybe we should revert this .... done.. This is a question about express, you might be better of asking on Stack Overflow about this.\nBut generally, to make SSL really work, you would have to create a local certificate.\nhttps://www.kevinleary.net/self-signed-trusted-certificates-node-js-express-js/. You might have more success with your question on forum.vuejs.org. thanks. I have no idea what this PR is meant to do. Can someone help?. Relative assets paths don't work with history node of the router, that's technically impossible, pretty much. \nExample:\n\nyou open ``www.example.com/\n\nbrowser looks for your app at www.example.com/static/js/bundle,js\n\n\nThen you manually change the URL to www.example.com/users\n\nYour webserver also serves your index.html for this URL, so your history mode router can pick up.\nNow the browser will look for you app at www.example.com/users/static/js/bundle.js\n\n...but of course, that path doesn't exist.\nSo you will have to define the subdirectory in which you app runs as an absoulte path in config.js, and as the base: option in the VueRouter options.. Thanks, will check that out! \nMuch apprechiated. . > Do we need the .eslintignore rules at all?\nEditors like atom or visual studio code can run eslint right in the editor. Excluding those files in .eslintignore makes sure that they don't show any errrors for those files after installing the template.. It seems that this is a leftover from a recent change that I had to undo because it caused issue.\nThanks!. I think we will leave the gzip option as it is. /config/index.js has comments that tell users to install that package before setting that option to true, so I think this is covered well enough.\nWe usually like to keep the package.json as light as possible, it's already heavy enough.. tbh I'm not super familiar with Nightwatch, but that change for the callback means that this is now undefined in the callback, which the original code probably intentionally avoided.\n. @vuejs-templates/collaborators Can anybody with more nightwatch experience chime in wether it's imortant to bind this here?. @robwierzbowski There's your answer :). You should try to properly link the package with npm link. I'll close this as it's tracked in #611 . Please check out #1178 and tell me what you think.\n. I don't think that I will finish this PR. The current state is insufficient, and the new vue-cli 3 offers excellent env support.. Have a look at /test/e2e/runner.js - Here, we set NODE_ENV to 'testing', expecting to run the dev server with a production config.\nSo this doesn't seem to be unnecessary.. No idea, sorry.\nHeads up: We will soon add Jest as another option for unit tests, and the current karma setup will be available, but deprecated.. No idea what to do with this, and no one else seems to care, so closing.. Duplicate #906 . Give me a few days, I'm on vacation till 15th, will finish this up that after that. :). I'll close this since its been inactive and 5 months have passed. If this persists, please comment / open a news issue with further details. . This will be solved via #975. this PR won't be mergable after #975 because dev-server.js will be removed.\nSorry to close this :(. @chrisvfritz this would break e2e as nighwatch needs to know the port of the devserver to run the tests. . That would be good, yes. . Great idea. . Will take a final look at the weekend when I'm back from portugal. Hi @erwin16 !\nWhat issues does this prevent?. I will close this since I don't know what the change implies and what problems it is meant to solve. \nWe can re-open this PR anytime if additional information is provided. . Hi @grakic \nCan you elaborate a bit about what situations and problems this prevents? I'm not entirely sure I see the problem this is fixing.. @grakic We will be switching to webpack-dev-server (see #975).\nI will leave this PR open, but set a \"request changes\" block. \nI would ask you to test this issue with webpack-dev-server (you can check the PR's branch out and test it locally, see #975, or after we officially merged it) and either close this PR if the issue doesn't persist, or adjust this PR to apply to the new setup.. I'm sorry, but this change was already done through another PR. Thanks for the contribution nonetheless!. The vue webpack template comes with a babelrc file and it is required for the template to work properly. \nIf you removed it, you broke your setup. . I think this can be impropved upon, primarily by setting the context option and converting a couple of paths to absolute ones.\nWe should look at this after #975 has been merged - using the official webpack-dev-server might solve some of the issues you were having.. Context is now set  properly. \nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L23\nI hope this resolves this issue... Reason: This template is not designed with typescript in mind.\nSolution: No idea, your problem description doesn't tell me much.. We will do a separate template for typescript towards the end of the year. This one here will not explicitly support it. \nHowever, I know a couple of people who use this template with type script and vue-vlsss-component, and don't have any problems, so I can't tell where your rpoblem is coming from. \nWhat I can do is make an educated guess: are you using any of the following for your project :\n\nDropbox / OneDrive / Google drive etc. \nvagrant \ndocker\nphpstorm or a similar ide \n\nThose are known to interfere with web packs default way of observing file changes. \nThe solution is usually to switch to polling (#946)\nIn phpstorm, I usually have to turn off some weird save protect feature. . Hi @UncleBill \nThanks for your PR. However, I just merged port detection, also you can use the PORT env variable as well as the config. That should provide more than enough options to configure this.\nSo I have to close this PR.. You experience this because vue-loader exports ES modules since version 13.\nSo you have to do: require('youcomponent.vue').default. @ssijak Did you find out anything more about this? I won't change the host to 127.0.0.1 just because it magically fixes this issue - if this is a chrome bug, we should document it.\nAnd if it's just a weird side-effect of one extension you have running, that would be even better and we can close this.. Okay, thanks. I will take a look myself when I find some time. . We will make the host configurable with an upcoming PR, but will not make 127.0.0.1 the default.\nChrome's behaviour as you describe it seems weird, but localhost should stay the default for now.. If you reference all source files from your tests anyway, then this has indeed no effect.\nIf however you tests leave out some source files, then this code would make sure they are still required and therefore taken into account when calculating coverage.\nIf that doesn't work as expected for you, maybe there's a bug?. Hm, good point. PhantomJS doesn't support promises (so I wonder why your first expect didn't fail).\nWe didn't include a polyfill originally because Vue.nextTick didn't support Promises  originally, (no part of Vue requires them).\nSo a better solution to your problem than monkeypatching Vue would be to polypill \"Promise\".\nWe should fix this, even though we probably switch to Jest shortly anyway.. FWIW, I made a PR to the main docs to mention the need for  polyfill:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/pull/1180. if (window.location.protocol !== 'https:') window.location.href = 'https://yourdomain.com' \nYou should probably do that from your webserver though, but no idea how possible in heroku. Just commenting to let you know that I intend to look into this, but it wil require to make thorough tests of various scenarios, especially nested routes in vue-router, so see if that fix actually works across all of them.\nSo please be patient, It's not forgotten, but not done with a simple change, at least not if we want the template to be thoroughly tested.. So I tried to reproduce it, but still can't, .   your problem is not a problem related to paths. \nYou are dynamically constructing CSS styles at runtime. Webpack can't recognize that at build time without some help. That help is require().\njavascript\ndata () {\n    return {\n      msg: 'My Driving School',\n      tabIndex: 0,\n      image: require('../../assets/logo.png')\n    }\n  }. remove the Uglify plugin from /build/webpack.prod.conf.js. Those are two different things:\n\nTranspilation\nusing native ES modules.\n\nConcering 1., you can simply adjust your babel config to only support evergreen browsers, as explained in the article. since that's a very easy step, I don't hink this needs special support in the template. \nAbout 2., there are no plans yet. I'm unaware wether webpack-html-plugin supports such a thing.\nSince we recently started discussions about vue-cli 3, I think this would be something we could solve through a preset for v3, but not in this template here.. It's not new, but yes, it's default behaviour. you cna change the path in /config/index.js. Hi,\nI have no real idea since you don't really say what problems/errors you encounter.\nGenerally, it's better to ak question on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org anyway. This is for bugs & features.. Please use forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org. Thanks!. I don't think  that we will do this. This will make the generator much more complicated and will defeat the advantage that people can easily find their way in every project geenrated with this template.\nI understand that the folder structure is not suitable for all use cases, but that's a downside I think we will accept.\nI'm open to discussion about this, but personally am not in favor and will not work on any implementation.. This will be done in #975 . Closing for inactivity. I can't solve it, no one else stepped up .... Hm, no idea from that information .... this might be of interest to you: https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader. You should probably rather ask on forum.vuejs.org and/or chat.vuejs.org\nAlso, from what you showed, it's not clear what your problem is. You say you want to remove the CSS from the .vue file, yet all your code still has it in them.\nWhat did you try to do to make this error appear?. Hi there!\nThere's no reason to panic, so calm down, take a deep brath and relax.\nThe change you are seeing is only stylistic in nature. We made this change in this example component because  in our recently released Style Guide, we recommend PascalCase for Component tags in templates of Single File Components(!). Read more about it here\nBut this style is:\n\njust a recommendation\nnot a technical change, nothing was broken or anything.\n\nYou can still do both, and you always could:\n<hello-world>this works!!</hello-world>\n<HelloWorld>this works, too!!</HelloWorld>\n`` . Thanks for the hint :). You can simply import them from node_modules in the main file, like you would for a javascript file:javascript\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/bootstrap.css'\n```\nIf you want to cutomize, simply create a main style file and import  that one:\n```scss\n// main.scss\n// addd your vriable overwrites here..\nimport '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss'\njavascript\n// main.js\nimport './main.scss'\n```\nthe whole bootstrap CSS will then be included in the extracted CSS file in the dist directory. Well, alll solutions have their trade-offs, so it depends what you want:\n\nif you want to be able to update these dependencies by updating a package in  node_modules, you probably also want webpack to add a hash to the file, so updates will cache-bust existing files for your users. In that case, just import them as I showed.\nIf you want you static assets to be really static (i.e. they will likely change (almost) never), it's probably easier to add them to /static, and not a lot of work either.\n\nYet you can of course change the config (here) to also include some files from node_modules, but that won't hash anything. \nEdit: Just realized that would also require some changes to the dev server:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/dev-server.js#L68-L69. Hey @exarus \nWill look into this and probably merge for the next version, this looks like a great and long-needed cleanup!\nThanks!. Hm, that's unfortunate. I wasn't ready to jump to eslint 4 since I wanted to test a bit if every plugin etc. is working well with it, especially eslint-plugin-vue, which will be released soon.\nI will test that asap, and until then, will change the airbnb version back to 11.3, which was till compatible with eslint 3\nThat means I will close this PR, sorry.. Thanks. Seems this was created by a recent dependency upgrade for other deps. \nThis is likely not creating any issues (karma and Simon still work fine), but I'll clear up issue. . It seems that karma-sinon-chai didn't update the peer dependency in a while:\nhttps://github.com/kmees/karma-sinon-chai/issues/50\nBut it still works as intended, so there's not much we can do. You will just have to ignore it.... this will be done with/in #975 . Please ask questions about your own projects on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org\nThis issue list should be strictly about issues with the original template, not forks.. Currently, you can't. This is a restriction of webpack's treatment of CSS, not of vue-loader.\nYou can read about plans to improve that here:\nhttps://medium.com/webpack/the-new-css-workflow-step-1-79583bd107d7\n\nThis has a few benefits:\n* We can generate stylesheet files for on-demand-chunks (this was not possible with the extract-text-webpack-plugin). That's because the production build includes source Maps by default:\n\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/config/index.js#L14\nEither deactivate that option or don't serve the sourcemap files that you find in the /dist folder.. I don't know what you are told to change, so I can't say what that means with the new dev server. . Sorry, already fixed this on my own after seeing an issue about it :/. Also, it can't be a let either because this code is injected into the client and not transpiled, so we have to use ES5 (var). Oh, right, I indeed got confused. sorry.. Thanks!. m,aybe include both examples?. Thanks, fixed now.\nWe recently transformed the build config files all to ES6 because the minimum node version supports it.\nBut dev-client.js is inserted into the client-side, and not transpiled, so it should stay in ES5.. Hello @xieminghao \nThank your for your interest in this project.\nHowever, your issue is a usage/support question, and the issue tracker is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests (as outlined in our Contributing Guide).\nWe encourage you to ask it on the forum  , Stack Overflow or on our Discord chat and are happy to help you out there.\n\nThat being said, your code should be transpiled to Es5 by babel-loder - it seems this doesn't work, at least for that file. I suggest investigating in this direction.. Ooops, correction: This was a bug. Explanation here\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/967\nAlsready fixed now.. Sorry, this won't make it as we will shortly switch to webpack-dev-server ( #964), so it's not a problem anymore.. Hi @dolymood,\ncan you give me a concrete example where it doesn't work with the current setup? I'm not sure I understand the problem, or rather, it would be suprising to find that so far no one reported such a problem with importing stylus files.. Thank you very much, will check it out soon!. That feature isn't even officially documented. Weird.\nBut I don't really see the use - css-loader does that as well, so we don't have to do this in stylus at all.. Thanks, but we are in thge process of switching to webpack-dev-server, so this change won't make it.\nThere will be a config setting for this after the switch though.. Hi @Lanseria \nI assume this was not meant as a Pull request for the original template?\nCan I close this?. Just read the karma documentation:\nBy default, Karma loads all sibling NPM modules which have a name starting with karma-*.. We will switch to webpack-dev-server very soon (#975), so this should not be an issue afterwards.. Thanks. Weird, no idea how that got lost but it's easy to fix :). @grakic I just checked, it's not missing?\n\nBut anyway, I realized that I fixed a specific version which is not necessary, so I will push a small fix.. Hey, thanks for reporting. That may very well. Be the case, it's the dev branch. Some PRe that I merged probably need some refinement, I plan to look into this at the weekend . @Tirke postcss-loader was just added via #1038 and I opened a small PR to fix the sourcemap situation #1039 \nI can't test the PR right now, but you might take it for a spin if you want to :). I think clientLogLevel should be the setting you are looking for.\nI probably should set this to something more reasonable, thanks for the pointer.. Where is that warnign coming from? Webstorm? I would assume that's because Webstorm doesn't understand the webpack alias. Nothing wer can solve on our end.\nIf that is a problem for you, use relative paths instead.. >  I even doesn't see where Uglify comes from in webpack template, I see no related plugins.\nThat would be here\n\nI can't find the answer how to solve it.\n\nYou already commented two different closed issues where solutions were provided. You have to adjust the babel-loader's include paths here so that the source will be transpiled to ES5\n. Babel-loader finds the .babelrc file in that packages folder and tries to use its settings for transpilation, but  that package is not installed because the webapck template uses a different one.\nSidenote: The menu-aim package wasn't the one producing the errror, was it? That package appears to provide an ES5 build (it has a .babelrc file with the es2015 preset, after all...).\nBut: Your OP seems to indicate that vue-particles is the problem, so you should include resolve('node_modules/vue-particles'). As this package has no babel config, you won't have a conflict of  configs like you have with that menu-aim package.\nEdit: I just saw that I already cam across this package before: https://github.com/creotip/vue-particles/issues/7#issuecomment-330031021\nThe best solution would be if the author of the package simply ran npm run build and changed the main file of the package to the built file instead of the source.. Well, then that seems to be a problem of that package - its code isa ppearantly not completely transpiled to ES5, even though it appears it should. . This PR updates much more than just the README and I don't think that was your intention.. Thanks :D :D. > even running \"npm run dev\" again doesnt work.\nI can't image how that could \"not work\" - what does happen when you run it again, it still shows the old content that doesn't exist anymore?. Closing for inactivity from OP.. Thanks!. oh right, good catch. Thanks.. Seems like there was just a download error. Did you try again?. I will close this since it seems to be a problem with your npm connection/mirror, not this template.. I can't help you with that, because I can't reproduce the issue.\nAnd the issue seems to be with the npm mirror (taobao) you are using - it's returning incomplete files.\nIf that's true, they have to fix their files, we can't do anything about this.. Thanks!. Hi, and thanks for the PR.\nCould you explain in more detail what this is fixing, exactly? \n\nWhat is happens without this fix?\nHow does the fix work - is this flag set by default and this overwrites this default?. Closing this since I have no idea what it does or solves.. The main point is that Vue-Router in history mode requires absolute paths to work properly.. > but since I build this project with npm and webpack.config.js is no where to be found\n\nThe webpack config for this template is a bit more complicated than those you encounter in examples, because we cover a lot of features. For this reason, it's spread across more than one file, and those files live in the /build directory.\nThe file you want to edit is named webpack.base.conf.js. In this file, you will find the resolve: alias section that the website is describing. Simply add the described aliased there.\nThen run npm run dev when the description says \"run webpack\". that command will run a development server for this template, which in turn does run webpack for you, so everything should work just fine.\nSidenote: I can only strongly suggest you start reading up on webpack, they have really great documentation by now: webpack.js.org. Hm, that generally happens when comments are stripped, usually but babel. \nWe had a \"comments: false\" setting in .babelrc for a long time(before webpack introduced this feature) which stripped comments from transpiled code and consequently broke this webpack feature.\nBut I removed this from the template back on June 22nd (https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/commit/8563cdb8d8d1e4abaef64f7695697b70957b9490), so that should work, assuming you created your project after this date. \nCould you verify that your .babelrc does not contain this setting?\nEdit: Oh, I see you submitted a PR that changes something else. Nice, will check it out!. Thanks for the PR, will merge it as soon as I found time to take it for a quick spin. . Thanks!. > Are you serious?\nI've seen countless projects that use build to actually \"build\" a the project, because, well - that's what the command does, it builds your project, it doesn't run a \"prod\" server or anything (while the dev command runs the \"dev-server\").\nSo yes, we are serious. :). Sidenote: did a short search on Github:\n\n\"npm run prod\" : 7k results.\n\"npm run build\": 403k results.. Can I ask why you are so upset about the name of a command?. Okay, I'll bite since I have some time to kill.\n\n\nBecause the code is manipulation of names. What, besides the names, contains your code?\n\nI'm not entirely sure I understand what you mean - In case you mean \"names in programming are important, it's what transports the meaning of the code we write\", I completely agree. But these things are often subjective, and there are trade-offs to be considered. Of course they can and should be discussed - constructively.\nOpening a PR with \"Are you serious? I'm sure it MUST be: ....\" basically suggests that we did something obviously stupid, which is not the best way to start a productive conversation with anyone.\nMy reply to this was meant to show you that using npm run build is very, very common in javascript projects, so it can't be something obviously stupid -rather, we can assume that most people familiar with javascript projects already have a good intuition about what it does.\nPeople who are not familiar with npm commands can read the templates documentation to learn quick and clearly about what each command does - that provides a better learning curve than any command name could on it's own, I think. Apart from that, this is advertised as a template for advanced users, not beginners.\n\nWhat if I want to build dev version of a project?\nOr dev version is not building, but constructing or scaffolding?\n\nWell, of course we can have a constructive discussion about which name is probably more or less meaningful to someone at face value. But can quickly end up in endless bikeshedding.\nExample\nYour proposal was to change it to npm run prod - But since npm run dev runs a dev-server, would the user not assume that this also runs a server, but in prouction mode?\nSo we could rename both commands:\n npm run start-dev-server\n npm run build-for-production\nThat's more meaningfull, right? that's communicating very clearly what each command does.\nBut now people will complain about these commands being much too long to type them over and over. See where it goes?\nThe Point\nSo, don't get me wrong: Command names can be discussed and optimized, for sure. But that should be done in a civil manner and with a better argument than \"I am sure it MUST be:\", because there's not an obviously, objectively correct way to do it.\nThe current commands are commonly used commands in the npm ecosystem and are also well documented, so I don't see that your PR had a good argument to change them. Hence, I closed it.\n. The dev server process builds the files in memory, so as far as the developer is concerned? The result of this process is only accessible though the dev server. \nThe build process on the other hand actually produces a tangible output on the /dist folder. \nSo the result of the two are very different, not just the environment flag differs. \nBTW we are now essentially bike's herding about the exact same things I mentioned in my \"example\" above... \ud83d\ude37 . config/dev.env.js & prod.env.js. You should not create  a DefinePlugin instance yourself, the template does that for you. All you have to do is define the name and content of the variable, just like the template shows you for the already existing NODE_ENV variable:\njavascript\n'use strict'\nmodule.exports = {\n  NODE_ENV: '\"production\"',\n  API_URL: JSON.stringify('http://192.168.1.10:8081')\n}. you have toaccess it as process.env.API_URL\nSee also: http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/env.html. (close/reopen to trigger CI). That makes sense, but I'm unsure in which place to keep it. It might fit better in babelrc, but I think I remeber that the browserList field in package.json can be used by other tools? Do you know anything about that?. Thanks. Will merge this tonight when I do some cleanup. . Thanks!. Vue-loader uses buble under the hood to get rid of the with this { ... } code that the template compiler produces.\nYou probably have to set the objectAssign option for buble in the vue-loader config as shown here:\nhttps://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/options.html#buble\nNote that, as mentioned in that link, you still have to provide a polyfill for Object.assign to support older browsers (IE). You also Set stripWith: false which you certainly should not do. . I don't have a concrete use case for that. It's basically a fallback to the behaviour vue-loader had before webpack 2 came along and all es modules were in strict mode by default. ou probably will never have a use for this option.. What did you do before npm install?\nIt seems you did not install this template  through vue-cli, but instead just cloned the repository or something?\nIn  that case, the template placeholders we use in the template during the installation process with vue-cli will till be there.. Closing for inactivity, and no appearant relevance as a bug.. Hi, and thanks for this PR.\nUnfortunately I don't think we want to focus on that right now. We also attempt to keep this template backward compatible to at least Node 6, which still didn't fully support ES6\nbabel-register allows to get around that, but it slows the process down, so it's not really an improvement from my POV.. What exactly does this do? \"nicer integration\" doesn't say much. I started writing changelogs so it might be helpful to mention what this actually helps with.. Thanks, that's clearer.\nWell, this template doesn't assume people are using a spoecific editor or editor-plugin. IF people do, it's their responsibility to decide what do use and how to make it work.\nSo I would say that I don't think adding the standard package makes too much sense, since using both this and eslint would be uncesessary, would you agree?. Sorry, but that won't happen, this is far too much work for little gain. simply change the desired indentation in eslint and run eslint --fix or something.. I'm not sure if we can consider this plugin production-ready yet. Last time I checked this was still in the early stages, but admittedly that was some time ago.. I doubt that the issue tracker is the right place for questions about Atom configs, but maybe someone can help out.. Closing for inactivity . Thanks, but since this browser is sill in beta, I don't think we will investigate this, especially since it seems to be related to webpack's core HMR functionality, not Vue-specific implementations.\nIf you want to have this tracked, maybe open an issue in the webpack HMR repository. I'd like to merge this, but for that we would have to include a polyfill for Object.assign() as well.\nI'm not against that, but I have a general re-evaluation on the map about of what kind of polyfills we include, so this will be merged sometime, but might take a small while.\nThanks for your patience.. Thanks, will have a look!. Outdated. Hi!\nI'm sorry that the template is not working for you in wechat, but I have no idea how to help you with just one sentence saying \"not show page\" and a screenshot.\nI don't understand what the problem is and cannot test your code to verify anything.. That seems to be a design (CSS) problem, what does this template have to do with it?. So the CSS is from bootstrap-vue, not this template. Maybe ask there.. We only recently added this meta tag to index.html:\nhtml\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0\">\nWhich you probably need.. I'm not sure I can follow. Does your pahge live at robettmain.github.io/portfolio? If so, the behaviour is expected because the default publicPath is an absolute root path.\nYou \"fixed\" it by changing it to an empty string, which essentially is the same as changing it to './' - a relative path.\nThe other solution would be to use change it to /portfolio.\nSo why do we start with an absolute path to begin with? Because many, many apps use vue-Router with history mode, and this mode doesn't play nice with relative assets paths.\nBut since history mode doesn't work on github pages anyway, your solution is fine for your usecase, I think.\nSidenote: This doesn't really have anythign to do with the topic of this issue - it's about other assets path problems.. > Oh, it doesn't? Huh. TIL.\nWell, history mode requires some settings on the webserver, which you can't influence o github pages. the normal navigation works, but refrrshing a page will lead to a 404.. thanks. We will  shortly be switching to webpack-dev-server (#975), so we should revisit this issue after that.\nBecause the config we had to comment out as explained in #751 isn't even available anymore after that switch. So we have to see how that reload functionality can be re-introduced (or maybe it just works, I haven't tested that specifically with the new setup yet).. Can someone translate? I don't really see what this is supposed to solve.. Agreed. This won't be merged.. Hey @mgenware \n, so I looked into this, and I don't think that I want to activate this by default. \nReasoning\nWith the current config, CSS from .vue files that are code-splitted will reside in that async chunk and only be loaded when that async chunk is actually loaded.\nThat means that the app.css file will be lighter and only contain the \"basic\" styles, and stuff you load later comes with its own styles.\nSolution\nI think this option can be useful though, and so I would suggest to add it to the templates config like this:\njavscript\n// set the following options to `true` if you want to extract CSS from\n// codesplit chunks into this main css file as well.\n// this will result in *all* of your app's CSS being loaded upfront.\nallChunks: false\nIf you want to make this change to your branch, I will merge this so you get credit for bringing this to our attention.s. Looks like for some reason, you have set the environment-variable NODE_ENV set to production  or testing in your terminal.. Closing for inactivity from OP.. > after \" npm run build \" dist folder is created but all the references for static files was broken\nPlease be more specific. How were they broken? What should they have been instead? how did you test this?\nBecause this usually works for people.. >  i open index.html file\n@akshayvinchurkar1 Have you looked at your terminal when you build for production? It should tell you this:\n\nTip: built files are meant to be served over an HTTP server.\nOpening index.html over file:// won\\'t work.\n\nThe reasons for that is indeed that we use absolute paths by default. And we do that because vue-router's history mode doesn't work with realtive paths. Using that is a common usecase, while using the files directly in a browser is not. \nYou can switch to relative paths by changing assetsRootPath in config/index.js under the build key.. I'm sorry, I would need some runnable code to say anything about this.\nBecause I'm running a fresh install of the template right now, and changed the import of the default Vue logo into a require, and it works nicely:\n\n\n. I can, just have to find one :D\nI doubt that the result will be different because both imports are done with the same loader config.. Tested, works just fine. Your turn :). Thanks for your PR, but we are in the process of dumping the whole devserver setup (#975) - will merge this tonight and release on the WE I think.\nso this won't be of any use, unfortunately.. There's A Regression concerning HMR in Vue 2.5, but a fix is available. \nPlease see this issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/1041#issuecomment-342689466\nI will close this issue here because this problem, if it still exists, is with Vue itself, not this template. . 1. You forgot to show how you actually import that file\n2. This might be better asked on the forum @ forum.vuejs.org. Well, what is the language level of the development environment? That depends on the browser you are using, right? So it's not something we can definitely for you either way.\nBut yes, the karma test setup uses phantomjs by default, which doesn't have modern browser features (just like IE)., so features that run fine during development in chrome can fail in phantomjs because you used some ES6 feature that babel could not transpile and that phantomjs doesn't have natively. That can be a good thing if you want to support IE alongside modern browsers - such a failing test means a polyfill is missing.\nIf you want to test in modern browsers instead, replace phantomjs with karma-chrome-launcher.. I agree that better documentation for that would be helpful.. I merged #975 into develop yesterday - so it doesn't exist anymore in that branch, and will be gone in master as well after the weekend - hopefully. . Hm, thanks for testing it out - https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/pull/937 might also be of interest, but:\n\n\nEvan's comment doesn't really apply because the current code applies postcss-loader only to the loaders for style files (*.css etc.), not the loaders for <style> blocks in .vue files.\n\n\nWhile the fix in https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/pull/937 seems valid to me, it only applies to scenarios where people use <style lang=\"postcss\"> without having explicitly specified a loader for that lang with vue-loader. In our template, we do explicitly define a loader for postcss blocks, and it doesn't include poscss-loader.\n\n\nSeems some digging will be necessary to make this work. A job for the weekend.. @Tirke I found the issue - it was another mistake in the original PR, a strict false comparison even though options.usePostCSS is undefinedwhen creating the loaders for vue-loader. \nThat resulted in postss-loader being included where it shouldn't.\nThe fix I just pushed should solve this.. Good eye, but that's cosmetics. Will add this later.. That's nothing specific to unit tests. The webpack config for babel-loader skips /node_modules in general - because transpiling every package would be a gigantic performance issue. \nSolution: add specific packages' paths to the include option of the babel-loader config. . We have a forum for general Vue questions. \nforum.vuejs.org. As soon as it has left beta stage we will add it. . You have to mount to an actual element. Create one with document.createElement. > what do you mean? I'm mounting the component with $mount()\nYou are mounting, but not to an element:\njavascript\nconst comp = new Constructor({\n  timeFormat: 'hh:mm a'\n}).$mount(document.createElement('DIV'));\n\nalso document wont't exist in that context (my unit test) surely?\n\nOf course it exists, the unit tests run in a browser with the karma runner.. Oh, well you are calling .textContent on the root element of your template which is a <div> and that element doesn't contain any text - it only contains two <span> elements. so there's no textContent.. There's a very basic guide on the main website, and we have a guide specific to our test utility: \nhttp://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org\nHowever this is still confusing as this should simply work as it is. . Obviously :-P. Nope. I could take a look if you could share a repository, but as far as looking at code snippets goes, I got nothing more to contribute.. That component looks a bit different and there's no spec in the unit folder - are you sure this is the latest commit?. You still need $nextTick if I remember correctly. . $children contains child components. Your component doesn't have any child components. . Can'T say more, couldn't test your app so yet.. You're the first to come across it as far as I'm concerned, so i don't know that \"rest of us\".\nOPs reproduction is no longer avaliable, and I never had such issues.\nIf you can provide a clean repository with a minimal reproduction, open a new issue and I am happy to take a look.. Hi and thanks for the PR.\nI remember discussions abotu this rule - however, we do not have this enabled in the old dev-server (which is still public in the master branch, and I agree that activating it by default now is not a good idea.\nSo we should think about if we want to add this to the /config options, or directly into the devserver-config, but commented accordingly and commented out so it's inactive.. Fixed, thanks!. Yep, postloader somehow got lost during a merge of a feature. I just added it in develop and will push an update shortly.. Just did a quick test, works for me. What's your environment? Inside a VM, a dropbox folder or something like that?\nHMR has problems in various environments, in those situations you can maybe help yourself with the poll option:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/config/index.js#L21\n. Closing since I doubt this is a problem of the template. If you can provide a reproduction of the issue, I'm happy to re-open.. * no VM?\n no dropbox or other service/tool \"watching\" the folder the project is in?\n special characters in the path? Webpack used to not like those as well ...\nOther than that I don't really have any ideas.. > I think what may have thrown me off is that it is no longer automatically launching a browser.\nThat has nothing to do with Hot Reloading.\nYou can turn this behaviour on again in /config/index.js. >  No hot reload... Sorry reload stopped working.\nI don't understand what exactly stopped working now.. The good old \"have you tried turning it off and on again?\" - never gets out of fashion :). it is, for the notification feature:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/utils.js#L96. Please open a new issue and provide more information  . I will test this specific case when I get home\nThe normal installation works well for me, just tested a could of hours ago for #1054, and HMR works fine for me.\nUntil then: \n can you provide me with details aboiut your environment? Virtual Machines? synced folders  (google drive etc.)?\n Does the poll option fix this for you?. Seems I have to push some changes from dev..... That usually works, it has been the default setting forever, and worked in all of our tests.\nThere must be something specific to your situation, so I don't see a need to change the default.. @eddyerburgh Got an idea?. > but for App.vue not quite...\nAp.vue is doesn'T have any tests, insofar the 0% are correct. However he lines numbers are off, which we will have to fix in vue-jest I assume, right @eddyerburgh ?\nWe should also create a PR for this template to use @akryum's config for windows compatibility.. Awesome, thanks :). Done in deb97b1c42b76aacd05628dc2c222fe7bf7f3761. Hm, you're right. Honestly - no idea where this is coming from :(. Ah, got it. the FriendlyErrorsPlugin is added twice. :D. you can easily change the host in /config/index.js.. Hm, that's very weird. Inside .vue file or inside a .scss file?\nI don't really understand why because SCSS is supposed to take care of those imports so it should be \"gone\" by the time postcss is taking care of the result.\n\nSass builds on top of the current CSS @import but instead of requiring an HTTP request, Sass will take the file that you want to import and combine it with the file you're importing into so you can serve a single CSS file to the web browser.\n\ncan you provide a repo to clone quickly?. Thanks. Will take a look in a few hours, will be on the road until then.. So, I could verify the behaviour, and could also verify that removing the tilde makes it work:\nsass\n@import 'flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.css'\nBut that is not a real solution because people used to sass-loader expect the code to work with the tilde.\nUnfortunately, I'm a bit baffled why postcss-loader even processes this import. sass-loader is supposed to do that, itsn't it?\nBtw, it has nothing to do with vue-loader, as it also happens when loading the file in main.js instead of App.vue.. Note: postcss-import doesn't respect the ~ which loaders, like css-loader or sass-loader use to \"mark\" module imports. That explains reason for the error, at least.\nAs to why postcss-loader is called in the first place: I think sass-loaer hands off loading the .css-file to the loader-config for that file type - which uses postcss-loader. I still don't find it logical that postcss-import is executed in that step (rather than on @imports inside of a .css file only), but that sems to be what happens.\nSo the easy way out would be to simply say: 'don't use tildes when importing .css, but use it for .sass and other preprocessor files', but that won't really be an acceptable solution, we'll have to figure out something else.. No, I don't think that would be promising. I read a couple of issues around this question, and it seems this is the \"postcss\" way of handling imports. \nI will probably attempt use use css-loader's importLoaders option to let css-loader handle the imports, but then still need a solution for vue-loader which applies postcss without postcss-loader, so this option is not on the table. \nMaybe we even need a fix in vur-loader itself. . @jarrodldavis thanks for this. \nWhile I don't think the first point is entirely valid/important (I also reproduced it with an import inmain.js, the second point was the missing piece for me. \nThe behaviour makes much more sense now, thanks. \nI will still try and improve this behaviour, but now I understand what's going on and that it's \"expected\".. Webpack does not process paths of <link> elements in index.html.. It seems you have an old version of that package installed, which tried to get that an from an url that doesn't exist anymore. \nTry npm ls caniuse-db to find out which package's depebdency it is, and upgrade those to their latest versions. . Two things come to mind:\n\nlockfiles: if you still have a package-lock.json or yarn.lock (or whatever it's called) in your project root, that might force the install of an older, out-of-date package with the old url ...\nare you using yarn? Yarn caches packages locally for a while, while npm doesn't, by defaul.\n\nOther than that, no idea at the moment.. Simply set your host to 0.0.0.0. Well that would make your machine Ccessible from outside by default, which I don't feel as a secure default. . I don't understand. What does index.hyml have to do with it, or the comment in that code? . Okay, saw the PR and understand the issue now. Thanks!. merged. Thanks. I will test this locally tonight and then approve & merge.. See #1074 - I think we get Jest running on windows after all :). It seems the new setup will work, I'll close this for now. We can still revert if we come across other problems.. I think there should still be a jest config in package.json, right? that would have to go.. closed in a37bcbb8d0455611e0e16aecccd6f2c9b7f51090. I'm not sure what you mean by \"where to build a serve\".\nIf you want to know how to start a developement server, the command is stil the same as before:\nnpm run dev\nIf that's not what you are asking, you will have to clarify.. See the last section on this page of the docs:\nhttp://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/static.html\nhtml\n<img src=\"/static/yourimage.png\". At first, I was abit perplexed, but a quick trial and error showed me that's not so much a problem with \"the\" (postcss-) Autoprefixer (which adds the prefixes), as it is with optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin, which in turn uses cssnano to minify css, whih removes prefixes based on the browsersupport defined in package.json's browsersList field.\nhttp://cssnano.co/optimisations/autoprefixer/\nWhy exactly does that happen, and which one is right (the autoprexier adding it initially, or cssnano stripping it again afterwards)?\nWhen I look up linear-gradient on caniuse.com, it states that it's supported in all browsers, so there's no need for this prefix at all:\nhttps://caniuse.com/#search=linear-gradient\nHowever When I run your example in my Chrome browser, the background really doesn't show up, and devtools tells me that linear-gradient(left, red, blue) is an invalid property value.\nSo I went to MDN, which made me aware that this comes down to a simply syntax problem:\n\n[the first argument] consists of the word to and up to two keywords: one indicates the horizontal side (left or right), and the other the vertical side (top or bottom). The order of the side keywords does not matter. If unspecified, it defaults to to bottom.\n\nIn other words: your CSS syntax was simply invalid, but that problem was masked by the autoprefixer who turned you invalid CSS into a valid prefixed counterpart.\n\nscss\n// wrong\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(left, red, blue);\n// right\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(to left, red, blue);\n\n\n. I can't reproduce this, no idea how this happens for you.. whats your version of vue-cli?. Oh right, sorry. Still can't reproduce this, though - those helpers are pre-registered in vue-cli, they don't even come from this template:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli#pre-registered-handlebars-helpers\n. Closing as I can't reproduce, and if it's a bug, it's with vue.cli, not this template.. The wording on that page is confusing - we don' need babel-runtime because we transpile our code during build, we don't run babel in production (that would be crazy).. When you set the assetsRootPath in the /config/index.js file to a relative path (./) it should work.\nNote that in this case, vue-router's history mode won't work.. Thanks. Strange, I could swear they already fixed this. It also says so in their README:\n\nBy default, @babel/preset-env will use browserslist config sources [which are:]\n1. Tool options. For example browsers option in Autoprefixer.\n2. BROWSERSLIST environment variable.\n3. browserslist config file in current or parent directories.\n4. browserslistrc config file in current or parent directories.\n5. browserslist key in package.json file in current or parent directories.\n6. If the above methods did not produce a valid result Browserslist will use defaults: > 1%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR.\n\nand there's no open issue about this that I can find.. Hm, that's really inconvenient. We need browserslist in package.json for autoprefixer, for example. \nSo the middle ground would probably be to import it into babelrc, so we only have to manage it in one place. \nWould you adjust the PR in that regard? . Ah damn, babelrc is json, not js.... . Hm, I'm a bit torn. But I think this could be advantagous.\nOnce we have a babelrc.js (even with this \"hack\" for the time being, until babel v7), we could actually comment the babel config and give some hints about what do do to e.g. add polyfills or whatever.\nSo yeah, let's actually do this.. Yes, the added complexity is sub-optimal.\nHaving two places to edit broswerslist in is sub-optimal as well, especially if we can't add comments in neither of the two places since both are JSON. \nSo I'd say it's a trade-off that's worth it. We just have to Mae sure to make it worth to the users by offering a well commented babelrc.js. @sudo-suhas So I've checked this out and I'm sorry to say that I think I've changed my mind again :(\nI'm a fraid that the new format of the babelrc.js file with the conditional return depending on environment will lead to a lot of confusion for people not familiar with the reasons we did it.\nSo I guess we will have to bite the bullet and revert to having the browserslist in both package.json and .babelrc, and make a note in the docs to make people aware that they have to make changes to browserlist in two places until Babel 7 has landed.\nWould you agree?. > Okay, removing a commit is easy enough. Where do you think I should update the docs?\n@sudo-suhas Let's revert the code first and worry about docs in a second step - we currently don't have a section dealing with the Babel setup at all, so I don't think there's a good place to drop in a quick tipp for the user.\nMaybe in the generated project README?. (close-reopen to trigger CI). npm run dev starts a development server on localhost:8080, and this server directly builds and serves your files in memory. That means no files are created.\nThe script tags for index.html are also automatically inserted etc., so there's nothing you have to do at all. Just run the dev script and visit the URL your command line tells you.. You might want to change the hostr from localhost to 0.0.0.0 in /config/index so it's reachable from outside.\nI don't work with Homestead of Vagrant and don't knopw how they expose their network interface, but I would assume you have ot find out that box's IP and access the server through that.. That would be dangerous in the sense that it could screw up thrird party code that also requires from a /src` folder local to that package. Might be an edge case, but would be a hard-to-trace bug if it happens.\nI think these Mappings should generally only be used for mocks (Style files etc) or to mirror the aliases you defined for webpack.. Closing for inactivity from OP.. 1. You are using the develop branch, I hope you are aware that this branch is not to be considered stable.\n2. I'm not aware of such an issue. The example component HelloWorld.vue uses ES6 exports / imports as well, and tests run fine. \nI would need to see a respository reproducing this.. Can't reproduce. This is your develop reproduction:\n\nThis is from the Jest docs:\n\nNote: If you are using a more complicated Babel configuration, using Babel's env option, keep in mind that Jest will automatically define NODE_ENV as test. It will not use development section like Babel does by default when no NODE_ENV is set.\n\nSo: \n\nJest will set NODE_ENV to 'test'\nBabel will set BABEL_ENV = NODE_ENV since we did not define it\nBABEL_ENV === 'test'\n\n=> Tests run fine\nYou should verify that your shell doesn't have a permanent value set for BABEL_ENV accidentally.\nTry running printenv | grep BABEL in your terminal.. The config file still contains all of the options mentioned, it just received a few additional ones in recent updates. Yes, we have to add those to the docs, but the additional options don't keep you from following the advice on that page.\nI will leave this open as a question for a few days in case some of the visitors can contribute something, but you will probably be better of asking people on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org. > I'll wait then for the doc update. \nJust to be clear: That update won't help you much with your task - the new options I added and will document are just convenience stuff for how the development server works. All of them are totally irrelevant with regards to integrating with another backend like WP REST.. * What means \"don't work\"? What error?\n* How exactly did you try to use the polyfill?\nYou don't have to \"polyfill vendors.[hash].js\" - polyfills are applied globally.\nUsually, you just have to add this at the very top of main.js\n```javascript\nimport 'es6-promise/auto'\n```. Thanks!. Makes sense to me in general.. Thanks!. Thanks. that doesn't seem to be a problem withdynamic-import(which is concerned withimport()functions) - it rather seems that ES6 modules weren't transformed to commonjs, which would have been the job of thetransform-es2015-modules-commonjs` plugin.\nThat works for me on OSX, but I'm not sure this is a windows problem - this build was tested by @Akryum on windows as well.\nCould you check out what process.env.NODE_ENV and process.env.BABEL_ENVare set to for you? for that, console.log them in/test/unit/setup.js` (and comment out the import statement so that it won't interefere befor the console had a chance to log).\nI would assume that your BABEL_ENV is not set correctly.. No, babelrc is fine. The problem is that NODE_ENV is dev.\nYou see, normally it goes like this:\n\nJest by defaults sets process.env.NODE_ENV to test, if it's not already set(!)\nif BABEL_ENV is not set, babel falls back to the value of NODE_ENV, so now BABEL_ENV is also dev\nAs the .babelrc config relies on BABEL_ENV to be test so that the correct env configuration is  applied.\nIf you don't mess with any of these env variables at all, everything should work just fine, because BABEL_ENV will be test, like we want it to.\nbut with your setup, it ends up as dev for reasons I don't know, which means babel doesn't convert ES6 imports to commonjs.\n\nSo long story short: \n NODE_ENV should be set to test or not set at all, or, \n if you need NODE_ENV to be dev, then BABEL_ENV should be set to test by you manually.. https://forum.vuejs.org/c/chinese. Have any of you tried the poll option in /config/index.js?. Thanks! That should be fixable on our side.. Wow, I just realized webpack-dev-server seems to use portfinder internally already. That's not really documented... I'll have to test this.\nIf it really looks for free ports on its own already, that means we can remove our extra implementation of portfinder i guess, but that's independent of fixing this bug.. This seems to be an accidental PR, closing..... Hi @joltmode , thanks for this report, this should indeed be easy to fix.\nA PR would be welcome if you are up for it :). Yeah, that's the point - we won't expose the dev-server to the whole network by default, that's for the developer to decide.\nWhat I would accept and merge would be a comment in the config file mentioning that 0.0.0.0 is required for outside access of the dev-server.. Thanks!. That should not be necessary unless you set NODE_ENV to something else besides test - otherwise, Jest will set it to test, and babel will fall back to that value in absence of BABEL_ENV.\nWhat was your setup before?. Maybe we can / should explicitly set BABEL_ENV in test/unit/setup.js. It seems this was a unique problem of OP, . Please provide  way to reproduce this for us, I can't tell what you did to get this error.\nFor starters: Where is this font file saved, relative to the .vue file?. Thanks. It seems that makes sense indeed. If someone wants to do a PR:\n\nextend .postcssrc.js like OP showed\nadd postcss-url to package.json. Becareful\u00f6 not to put it inside a conditional block. That's included now . Is this supposed to be a feature request or how should I label this? :). This also has nothing to do with the proposed feature of this issue. Please stop posting comments to issues that have nothing to do with the original topic. . I'll close this for inactivity. I don't think we will add this to the standard . that will be fixed with #1083 . We can't order dependencies because we have to conditionally add dependencies with a templating language, depending on the answers the developer gave when creating his project.\n\nWe should fix the empty lines, though.. empty line fixed with https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/commit/01a4b646dd4fd92605368070acc23e16e30c5714. You are right that its possible technically, of course. \nMore conditionals are out of the questions for reasons of maintainability / readability. \nBut a sorting function would be possible. I would welcome a PR that introduces such a function. Just be aware that we can't use third-party packages (without hackery) during project generation since vue-cli doesn't run a npm install (and I don't think we want it to). . Thanks for posting this. I have a few questions:\n\nWhat CSS is duplicated? CSS from code-split .vue files is not added to the main app.css file that gets extracted - at least that's how it's supposed to work. Are you sure it's duplicated?\nThe production build generates sourcemaps. I'm not sure weither they should be included in the code-split bundle (to put it another way: if webpack simply behaves this way with sourcemaps for codesplit bundles), and if not, we can do anything about this from within this template (read: this would probably have to be fixed in vue-loader\n\nI'll take as soon as I find some time to really dig into this.. Okay, so I've taken a look. \nMy observations\n\nCSS itself is not \"duplicated\" - css in a codesplit component only lives in the component, not in the main app.css file.\nHowever, CSS Sourcemaps are \"duplicated\" - the codesplit chunk (e.g. 0.js) contains the CSS sourcemap for that chunk's CSS, and the map file for the code split chunk (e.g. 0.js.map) contains it as well. Not good. \nincluding the sourcemap in the chunk is bad for file-size, so we should get it out of there somehow.\nAnd finally: this also happens for \"normal\" .js files that are codesplitted and import a normal .css file - in other words: webpack / style-loader does this, not Vue or vue-loader.\n\nPossible short-term fixes:\n\ndisabling sourcemaps for production in /config/index.js.\nSetting allChunks: true in ExtractCSS extracts all css into app.css, even the CSS in codesplit bundles - this also extracts the sourcemap. But that might also be undesirable because I think by default, we do want the CSS to be in the codesplit bundle, but ideally, want the sourcemap for the CSS to be in a separate file.\n\nThe end goal:\n\nKeep the CSS in the codesplit chunk\nGet the source-map out of the codesplit chunk\n\n..however, I have no idea if that's actually possible with the current webpack tools we have.\nWill investigate further.\nWebpack Experts' help welcome\nThis seems to be a tricky one, so if someone out there has a good trick up their sleeve that they can share, please comment / send PR!. @vuejs-templates/collaborators take a look if you can.. @CharlesKumar Yes, this option allows to select a sourcemap, and we can also disable it there.\nBut as I said abov, disabling sourcemaps in production is not a real solution to the problem we are discussing, it's a quick workaround at best.. @chrisvfritz not on its own. While it extracts css from code split chunks into individual css files (and with them possibly the sourcemaps), it leaves the chunk without runtime code to load that css. \nIt seems to be meant in SSR scenarios specifically. \nI have hit up Sean on Twitter? hoping he has a pointer for us. . Sorry, but that will only compress results, it won't remove the duplicated source maps . Well it's not really duplicated. One is the \"real\" css, one is the source css for the source map, so it's not really used as css during runtime. Still it doesn't belong there of course. . After some discusssion with @chrisvfritz I think we should switch to allChunks: true as the default setting for the ExtractTextPlugin.\nOpinions?. That'sa safari being a dick, and it won't happen anymore since we switched to webpack-dev-server with v1.2.0. See https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/263. Hi, and thanks for your suggestions tryon to improve this template.\n\n\nWebpack's tree-shaking is not dependent on any setting that I'm aware of. It's \"always on\", and we do use Es6 static imports.\n\n\nNo, we don't use --optimize-minimize, because it has not use for us. As the webpack docs explain, this flag adds the UglifJS-Plugin, and we already add that ourselves in the production config manually, and with additional options.\n\n\n\nNote that the --optimize-minimize flag can be used to insert the UglifyJsPlugin as well.\n\nIt's not some additional option we can use, we already do what we can here.\n\nbabel-minify with several presets helps this process with lot of options\n\nYes, babel-minify would be an alternative, but at the time of this writing it's considerabley slower than UglifyJS.\nWe however mention it as an alternative in the config. We haven't added it initially because the default setup of this template aims to compile to ES5 anyway, and when doing that, Uglify is as good in terms of minification and much faster - at least that's my latest information, feel free to correct me :)\nBabel-minify doesn't do tree-shaking either.\n\n(see also webpack-closure-compiler)\n\nI don't think that the closure-compiler would be a good addition to this template - closure is a whole other beast of its own.\n\nThe above link has benchmark data (for react.js) with uglify, closure-compiler, betternut, closure-compiler-js and babel-minify\n\nIn those benchmarks, Uglify pretty much \"wins\" each of them, so I think we are good in that regard :)\n\nmany be this enhancement solve this issue\n\nI don't think so - this is not a problem of tree-shaking or minification.. As far as I understand it, the only advantage concerning tree-shaking that babel-minify has is that it can also tree-shake unused classes. \nBut that only works if we don't transpile es6 classes to es5, which we don't want for our default setup. . I think this can be closed for now, we recently switched to the new uglify plugin which also can compress es6.. Seems to solve issues with reltive paths in CSS libs as well, so we need this (see #1199). The correct syntax would be:\njavascript\nthis.$set(this.$data, 'products', dummy)\nBut since products is already a reactive property, that's not necessary at all:\njavascript\nthis.products = dummy. This is not a support forum, please join us at forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org - we are happy to help there.\nThank you :). ...for what? linting? running tests?. I don't have a nice idea of how to integrate this in a way that offers actual advantage without forcing it on users. Another question in the questionnaire at the beginning is not a good idea, the feature is too \"small\" to justify another question.\nSo I will close this. If someone comes up with a nice concept, open an new issue or send a PR.. Awesome work, thanks!. How does this compare to babel-minify? Any experience with both? . Thanks. What would be the advantage of this? . > there is no question of why this dependence is necessary.\nThen maybe I'm stupid. Enlighten me. \nEdit: ah, got it. I was actually being stupid. . Fixed the merge conflict created by #1118 . Can you be a  bit more precise?\n\nWhich project setup (answers)?\nWhat safari version?\nAny console errors? What does the HTML look like?\n...?. I don't own an iOS device, so I can't debug this, sorry. . Closing for inactivity.. Thanks. the source is uglified, but we also build sourcemaps by default, and you sem to serve those as well. Those sourcemaps are resp\u00fconsible what you are seeing.\n\nSimply don't serve the *.map files  or deactivate sourcemapping for the production build in  /config/index.js. Wow, good find!\nWill check this out this weekend.. @chrisvfritz This would probably also be relevant for the docs.. Hi @chris-schmitz \nThanks for the submission. I see the use this hase for you, but I think that it's not enough to create a new \"syntax\" around resolve. \nThe current resolve is pretty self-explanatory - your version will stump beginners and make them wonder where this is needed.\nSo I don't think we will add this.. Thanks for reporting this. We already fixed this in the develop branch (#1103)\nIt will be published shortly. . I have no idea, and don'T know this browser or how to debug this.\nSince no one seems to answer here, try asking on forum.vuejs.org // chat.vuejs.org. Thanks, but that's not necessary.  vue-loader runs everything through postcss anyway.\nThat's why that option is there in the first place: so we add postcss-loader only for the style-loaders for .css files etc, and not for .vue. You are misunderstanding what I wrote: \nAll css is run through postcss inside of vue-loader. Always. Without any config necessary. \nIt's in the docs, just take a look. . Hey @Toilal \nThanks for the PR. a quick question: host 0.0.0.0 is enough to access from within the same network, right? Like from a mobile phone in my Wifi. Or would that also require this additional option?. Thanks, understood.. (close and re-open to trigger CI). Very good point, thanks. We could change the last question to be a choice:\n\nInstall dependencies for you now (recommended)?\no Yes, use npm\no Yes, use Yarn\no No, I'll do that myself.. Hm, and am bus able stack trace. Dammit :D. Hm, I see you created the project in place instead of defining a sub directory name.  I haven't tested that one tbh. \n\nLet's hope it's related to this and not windows. . :(. I can't give you much. It seems the spawn() of the child process in /utils/index.js fails, but I'm not very familiar with that API. Maybe a problem with the cwd? Maybe we have to specify another type of shell on windows systems because now it uses one where yarn & npm are not in the path? . > btw.. Instead of manually wrapping spawn in a promise, why not use execa? It would handle a lot of edge cases as well.\nBecause that would mean that we have to \n first run an npm install in the temp dirctory where the template was downloaded to, to install execa (otherwise we install in the cwd which probably is undesirable)\n but I don't know if we can reliably know this direcory in the first place.\n say we do, then we can require  exceca from this directory \n and finally we can run npm again in the created proejct folder to install the project dependencies.\nA lot of hoops to jump through for convenience - I would only attempt this if it really was necessary to handle edge cases without excessive boilerplate code.\n\nAre you planning to drop support for node 4?\n\nI would like to, and vue-cli's latest version doesn't support it anymore anyways.\n. Not all need them, but there could be a flag to enable/disable it in meta.json - so yeah, that could make sense.... I would still like to add it to the template first, and then integrate it in vue-cli.\nRelease cycles for he cli are longer, and I can always deactivate it in this tempate quickly once the feature has been integrated into the template.\nthis way, older cli versions can benefit from it as well.... Duplicate of #618 . That's correct, good catch, thanks.. I activated that option - can you push a commit to trigger it?. 1. Why would you build on heroku?\n2. What command did you run on heroku? did you by any chance do this, or something similar?\nNODE_ENV=production npm run dev\n(maybe NODE_ENV=production is set in the environment on heroku by default? I don't use it so don't know)\nThat would start a dev server with a development configuration that breaks because the development config won't work with NODE_ENV=production\nAnd running the dev server on heroku doesn't make any sense anyway.. I can't reproduce this (I'm on OS X though).\nDoes the error tell you where that syntax error is happening?. Hm, that's a weird choice by the maintainers. \nI think we should add this workaround to the template. \nThanks for getting to the bottom of this. . I just pushed that fix to the develop branch, anyone interested can test it out with \nvue init webpack#develop. work fine for me ... you will have to provide more information.\n\n\n. No, I moved it to the static folder.  if it were in the assets folder and handled by webpack, it would also be under static/img, not static/. Hard to say without seeing your actual setup. Your description can't replace that. . Hm, that's weird. I'll have to check out if this is somethign webpack-dev-server does on purpose ... we haven't specified anything particular about what to serve, webpack-dev-server just does this on its own from the root directory.. thanks for the reminder.\nI just did the following:\n\ncreate a new project\nadd a file called test.js in the /static folder. it looks like this:\njavascript\nconsole.log('This was a successful test!')\nadd a script element to import this in index.html\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\n\ntest-static\n\n\n\n\n built files will be auto injected \n\n\n```\n....and it works:\n\nSo it works just like expected. \nI will stop researching this unless you can provide a repository that demonstrates the problem with runnable code. And please don't share a whole project that you worked on - just the bare minimum to demo it.\nOtherwise, I will close this issue since a reproduction of your problem is not possible.. Thanks for the analysis. I came to similar conclusions when researching #1176. That issue is probably more related to your problem. \nThis issue here, according to OP, has an assetPublicPath of '/' which should be fine. \nI'm still researching horny invest tackle this with webpack-dev-server. If you have any ideas, please share them (in #1176). I will close this since there's still no reproduction available And I can't see what's supposed to be wrong.\n@goowikns Please open a new issue pointing to this one if you can create a repository that actually reproduces the issue. Hello @jaisrid81 \nThank your for your interest in this project.\nHowever, your issue is a usage/support question, and the issue tracker is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests (as outlined in our Contributing Guide).\nWe encourage you to ask it on the forum  , Stack Overflow or on our Discord chat and are happy to help you out there.\n\nSpecifically, this repository is about the webpack template - you don't use the webpack template, so this issue is not relevant to this repository.. Sure, once it's released as a stable version we will add it asap. . This is not a problem with this template, but with vue-cli (and possibly your connection).. Should be doable. . Hard to say anythign as you don't share the project, or at least the code, its location within the project and where you try to include it.\nI don't see how babel could be the issue since in this template, it doesn't even transpile import - webpack does that itself.\nPlease consider asking questions in proper places like forum.vuejs.org // chat.vuejs.org. Closing for inactivity from OP.. that would probably an issue to report at https://github.com/eddyerburgh/vue-jest - since it only seems to affect .vue files. Otherwise, this is a jest-specific qustion and not related to the template itself.\n/ping @eddyerburgh \nEdit: With mapCoverage:false, the user.js file isn't in the list, with true it is - so just the other way around...\n. @eddyerburgh Please link the new issue here and close this one ok? thanks. See #1022. Remove all of the CommonsChunk Plugin instances in /build/webpack.prod.conf.js. If you find a way to create nice way to integrate a button or something in a way that doesn't look like it's there just for the test, sure!. Hm. I'm not on High Sierra yet, and can't reproduce anything like this on my MBPro .... Closing this since this is not reproducible for me, and I have no Idea what we can do about this,\nIf somone can provide further useful input, feel free to comment or open a new issue.. This is a complete app, basically. We won't debug this here.\nPlease use our forum on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org. On what kind of errors does this happen?\nI tried:\n\na syntax error wiht eslint enabled: shows eslint errors\nas syntax error with eslint disabled: shows error with highlighted code-snippet.\na from path on an import: shows \"module not found ...\" error\n\nPlease provide more information.. \n. > Sorry, I forgot one important thing ! The error is caused by ts-loader (i'm running typescript).\nNot an unimportant detail ^^. Please provide a repository with a reproduction, I won't build one myself.. Thanks. Seems ts-loader is a weird beast. In webpack 1, it even made webpack exit with code 0 on a compile error (https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/108), so getting errors out of ts-loader seems to not be that easy :-P\nSo I played around a little and found that removing children: false is enough to make the error appear again.\nThe thing is that this alone makes the output quite verbose on a successful build. and since this template is not laid out for typescript yet, I would hesitate to make the output verbose for everyone just to accomodate those who implement typescript into that template on their own.\nSo my suggetion would be the following:\n\nAdd a comment in build.js to tip off people using typescript how to fix it.\nIf /when we make typescript an option for the template, with e.g. #797, we can make this option change depending on wether typescript was added or not.\n\nDoes that sound sensible to you?. Oh, thought I had tested that thoroughly enough. Will take a look, thanks.\n\nBTW, last commits are great\n\nThanks :). @Toilal Try this branch:\nvue init webpack#fix_complete_msg_1157. Will change that. . That would probably require some drastic changes, I think you will be better off asking on the forum or the chat (forum.vuejsorg / chat.vuejs.org) or simply build your SCSS with gulp like you are used to.. Hey, \nI have been working on improving the CI tests for some time, and took a very different approach - one that doesn't rely on bash so windows users can run them too.\nPlease have a look at #1218 . Please explain in what cases that can make tests fail. You change breaks the tests as well ...\nThis is a pretty complicated array of possible setups we have to cater to (with/whithout e2e, with/without unit tests, unit test with jest or with karma...) so it's important to know what you think you are fixing, in order to check which other side effects this might have.\nI don't see what\n\nChanging the BABEL_ENV value from test to testing is supposed to do.\nsetting BABEL_ENV for e2e test is supposed to do. e2e tests runa webpack-dev-server with a production config, so I don't see why a different trnaspilation should be required.. > With those changes, it seems to fix my issue. Don't know why the CI fails, it seems unrelated to those changes.\n\nYou didn't change the BABEL_ENV for jest, and jest sets NODE_ENV to test unless specified otherwise - which in turn is the variable babel falls back to if BABEL_ENV isn't specified either.\n\n{{#if_eq runner \"jest\"}}\n  \"unit\": \"jest --config test/unit/jest.conf.js --coverage\",\n{{/if_eq}}\n\nSo your change breaks tests with jest - but the unit command for jest could be adjusted accordingly to fix this.\nHowever, I would like to learn more about what different config/plugins you needed for vabel in e2e tests. Those tests are starting a webpack-dev-server with a production config, so I don't see what special plugins would be required for babel during e2e tests. After all, the dev-server is supposed to behave just like a production build during the 2e2 tests.\nI'm not saying there can't be anything wrong with the setup we currently have, but we might have to change something else entirely depending on the source of the issues you faced. \n. I will close this PR since it triggered me to work on #1163 which will bring some changes to the area affected by this PR and others.. I started working on this today, as a matter of fact. Will push a WIP PR as soon as I have tested it once, hopefully tonight.\nDoing this cleanly requires some rewiring of the webpack configs and adjusting documentation, so I don't think it will be ready in the coming few days, but won't take weeks either.\nSidenote: previous discussions in #903 . If you mean something like \"config as a dependency\", then That's what vue-cli v3 will bring, but that's still in the concept phase. . Oh, that will be part of the PR I'm working on for this template. \nI think we wording is confusing: we have a /config/index file which mostly has general, environment-independent app settings (and a few things overwriteable by env variables). \nWhat is called \"config\" in your link is what I'm trying to improve, and part of that improvement will be .env file support and definition files for webpack  in /config/environments for any number of deploy environments. . Please see #1163. Have a look at /build/vue.conf.js, there's a call to a utils function which has an extract parameter. \nSet this to true.\nJust be warned that this will seriously slow down rebuilds during development, I can't recommend this. . Will close this for now.. There's no easy upgrade path yet -  we aim to solve this with vur-cli 3.\nFor now, the best way to go depends on the level of customization that you applied to the template. \nOf you hardly changed anything, it's actually quite simple to roll out a fresh install of the template, copy all your source files and tests and replace everything in your original project directory with that. \nJust make sure to adjust anything  you changed in  /config and /build afterwards. . This is not a discussion specific to this template, so please use more appropriate places to discuss this (Stack Overflow, forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org). So it seems The solution was actually pretty simple - something got lost in a merge/rebase.\n1170 by @sudo-suhas should fix this.\n\n@xiejiamiao\n@KyleLehtinenDev\n@IcedKnight\n@songhongjiang\n@lambdakris\n\ncould any of you run this and test it out?\nvue init webpack#develop. The fix is now available though the normal command as well. . Thanks for testing and reporting back!. Ah, damn - totally didn't notice. Seems I somehow lost this during a merge/trebase indeed.. Damn, it seem #1170 might fix the underlying reason, and it was easy so find. I will close this PR, and push another one rebased on that fix.. Closing this as I think we don't need it after all. . 1. target: 'http://localhost:3000/api',\n2. That's because we have set the historyFallback option of the webpack)dev-server, which is required to make vue-router work in history mode. You can read more about that in the router docs. \nFor further such general questions, I would recommend to visit forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org. 1. See #1140. Will apply that fix in this template later, asap.\n2. Not for me. Did you try the latest template version?. About 1.: I just pushed that fix to the develop branch, you can test it out with \nvue init webpack#develop. I followed exactly your steps and everything works for me. \n\nThis is a pure webpack question and not specific to this template.\nPlease provide an actual repository where this error is reproducible.\nPost this question to the forum or the chat (forum.vuejs.org / chat.vuejs.org). Easy: you added those options to the DefinePlugin, but as you yourself correctly wrote above, you have to use the ProvidePlugin. . First of all, why are you treating them as static assets instead of letting Webpack handle them by putting them into ./assets? that would prevent the whole problem.\n\nIf that's not possible, we will have to work something out, becaue it seems that webpack-dev-server doesn't apply the publicPath setting to static files (but he does to built files) - that's a pity. \nI will investigate a bit more if that's really the case and what to do about that, but for now we will have to work around that.\nWe can do that by generating the static paths dynamically depending on environment:\n```js\n// /config/dev.env.js\nSTATIC_PATH_PREFIX: '\"/\"' \n// /config/prod.env.js\nSTATIC_PATH_PREFIX: '\"/foo/\"' \nThen add a helper to your app:javascript\nVue.mixin({\n  methods: {\n    $toStaticPath(path = '') {\n      return process.env.STATIC_PATH_PREFIX + path\n    }\n  }\n})\nand use it like this:html\n\n``\n. I see how that could provide a workaround, but it would have to copy to a different location, e.g./public, so that it doesn't mess with/dist` - that would have to be docoumented and explained to users.\nSo thanks, I will fall back to this if I don't find a way to make webpack-dev-server serve the files appropriately.. Oh, I just saw this: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin#this-doesnt-copy-my-files-with-webpack-dev-server\n\nStarting in version 3.0.0, we stopped using fs to copy files to the filesystem and started depending on webpack's in-memory filesystem:\n\nThat could work after all. Thanks!. Hey, thanks for the feedback, that's very valuable. \nI'll add those fixes when I can. . > this fails to account for using the babel-loader for JS. \nThat would be a pretty stupid mistake to make for us. But it's not a mistake, the config is fine. \nReading the vue-loader docs you will find that babel-loader is used by default for the javaScript in .vue files. \nFrom what you write, it seems your problem is more with eslint and less with Babel? But I haven't really understood it. . Closing for inactivity. IF you can provide further info, feel free to open a fresh issue with that info.. Sidenote: The tests are failing because of memory issues on CircleCI. Maybe needs a workaround, but not relevant to this PR.. Looking forward to it :). @codeofsumit thanks for the feedback, I need to find the time for a longer reply, hopefully before the weekend. . I won't finish this. . I won't put much energy into feature development for this template, since vue-cli 3 is already in RC now, and it doesn't make sense to start new projects with this template in my personal opinion. I would assume that this template won't be useful anymore compared to vue-cli 3 within weeks after vue-cli 3 has officially become stable.\nAnd since there is no clean update path for this template from an old version to a new one, new features have very limited use for existing projects as well - you can switch those over to vue-cli 3 at least as easy, probably.\nI'd be happy to merge changes to this template proviced they are tested solidly (which is not easy!) though, so go ahead if you want to improve this.. Well, the error is pretty clear: each component can only gave or root element. Your has multiple: \n\nthe h1 element\none or more p elements. \n\nSolution: wrap everything in a div or any other suitable element. \nPlease read the docs or ask on forum.vuejs.org for further help - this question is not related to this template. . How do static files interfer with your unit tests?. > There are warning when vue refers files in /static/.\nWhat kind of warnings? I still don't see what warnings would appear in unit tests in these cases.. Closing for inactivity. It want explains what problem this PR solves, so I don't see a reason to merge it. . Not really, no.\nBut it seems the current setup has reached its limit. If you read the error, it says \"out of memory\". I have that error as well with a larger PR: #1178 \nI'm currently checking out how to move the tests to circleci v2, which is much more fficient and faster as far as I have experienced. Until then, you are pretty much on your own, sorry.. I'm closing this since the normal banches do build fine for us, and there's no specific setting you have to use. Nothing we an help you with.. thanks. We,, I would simply insert the bugsnag code here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/build.js#L34\n..and Netlify allows you to set Environment variables, that should allow you to pass in the api key without comitting it to git.. Have you chosen to let the template install dependencies?\n\nIf yes, then it also should run npm run lint -- --fix for you automatically, which will fix these mistakes\nIf no, then there should have been a note in your console to run this command yourself.\n\nIf one of those things didn't happen, we have a bug. In that case, please open an issue and explain exactly what you did and what happened.\nThe PR will be closed though, since as mentioned, we use --fix to adjust the created code to the different eslint presets after the fact. airbnb and standard have a lot of  incompatible rules, so this can't be \"fixed\" in the source of the template.. I assume this was not meant as a PR to this template?. Will make a quick test run with this to see the behaviour when it fails, then I'll merge. Thanks.. So I just tested this. The problem I'm seeing with this is that the error message generated is not as good as it is without that option, at least in case of a missing module which I used as a test case.\nWith bail: true:\n\nThe error states that a module is missing, but yu don'T really learn in what file that error happened.\nWith the current config:\n\nNow that's much more helpful, isn't it?\nMaybe there's a way to get these kinds of error messages with bail: true as well, but I don't know of any.\nIf you (or someone else) can come up with a solution for that, I'm willing to consider switching to bail: true, but I don't think we should accept inferior error messages for a quicker build cancellation when an error is encountered.. Are you sure? \nI was under The impress up that they get replaced... . Are you using jsx in your projects? \nWill test it tonight as well... . Import it at the top of /src/main.js\n`import '@babel/polyfill'. Can confirm. This logo is only used for the notifications you can get on build errors. . Hi and than a for the suggestion, but I don't think we need another plugin to replace two lines of code. \nIf this plugin offered additional advantages I would reconsider, but I don't see them. . I'm sorry, I don't understand \n\nwhat the title has to do with the text\nwhat kind of error message that is\nhow and when this happens for you.. I'm closing this for inactivity - No one seems to know this error and from the message itself, it sound like less of a problem with this template and more a problem with your node/npm installation and Operating system/file system.. I'm actually working on a bigger PR to support this properly across all features / modes of this template in #1178 \n\nchiayutsaipersonal has already mentioned the important part - using dotenv, I just want to make clear that this only gets you the API key into the node process that's running (i.e. webpack), not into your app.\nSo to get it into your app, you would have to add it to /config/dev.env.js:\n```javascript\nrequire('dotenv').config()\nmodule.exports = {\n  NODE_ENV: '\"development\"',\n  FIREBASE_KEY: JSON.stringify(process.env.FIRBASE_KEY)\n}\n```. I think the changes we have currently under review in #1115 should solve this. could you test it?. Great, will merge this asap.. It's merged, will publish tomorrow. . It seems the plugin was updated and 1.16 should have this fixed:\nhttps://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v1.1.6. That quote alone is no reason to not use this plugin. It is meant to work with webpack 3 just as well - it just won't be included into webpack before 4.0.0\nBut maybe we have to temporarily downgrade because of https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin/issues/197\nI will take a closer look tomorrow afternoon, won't be on a laptop before that.. Note: downgrading the version won't be enough, as plugin options work differenlty for 0.4 and 1.0.0:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/pull/1119. I didn't ignore it. I explained to you how I think you misunderstand it.\n\nThat plugin has a 1.0.0 release - that means it's stable. \nThe note only says \"we will include this in the webpack default plugins starting with webpack 4.0.0\". \nIt does not say \"don't use this plugin, it's not ready yet\". Problem was fixed with v1.16 of the plugin, so we can close this. . @sudo-suhas That actually doesn't work for me, I just get this:\n\n\nit correctly reads the version from pkg.json, but apperantly the helper returns nothing for me :/\nEdit: ah, got it. You accidentally put the template-version outide of the helper: {} object in meta.js. . Don't worry, thanks for the continuing contributions :). > snapshotting doesn't work\nYou state this as a fact and assume that we are familiar with the problem you are facing. I am not. Please clarify.\n(And to clarify on my part: I know what snapshots are, but I don't use them extensively at the moment. I am not aware of a reason why they should not work with this template and believe they worked when I tested them before the official switch to jest).\nEven if that problem exists, however, other reasons for jest include:\n\nvery active development\nall-in-one solution including dependency mocking, coverage etc. \nmuch faster, usually.. So I just tested this out of curiosity, and sure enough it works well:\n\nAdded this test:\njavascript\n  it('should match snapshot', () => {\n    const Constructor = Vue.extend({ ...HelloWorld})\n    const vm = new Constructor().$mount()\n    expect(vm.$el.outerHTML).toMatchSnapshot()\n  })\nResult:\n\nChanging the component's output fails the snapshot test, running with -u updates the snapshot - just as expected.\nIf you have problems using this feature I suggest visiting us on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org. Hm, I didn't really document it because didn't know what to document. the only thing to \"know\" is how to get the HTML via vm$el.outerHTML.\nBut maybe we can add a note to the docs somehow.. postcss doesn't transform css vriables by default, you have to inlcude a postcss-plugin that does, i.e. cssnext.\nJust install it and add it to the postcss config file in your project's root.. Since this is marked as a security related option in webpack docs, we won't set it to false by default.. You find the webpack config for the dev-server in /build/webpack.config.dev.js. What specifically is unclear? \nYou need to add a webpack option disableHostCheck) to the webpack-config of the dev server. I told you where to find these settings in your scaffolded project. \nOr did you scaffold your project with the new vue-cli 3, which does not scaffold the webpack config into the project folder anymore? \nIn that case 1)you are in the wrong repository - this repo is about the webpack template for vue-cli 2 - and 2) you can add dev-server options in vue.config.js, which is explained in the docs. . where does this error appear? any more info? line numbers? files? anything?. Closing in favor of #1208 since it has better description of the problem. . Hm. Strange. No idea what's causing that tbh :/\nMaybe I can get my hands on the laptop with IE11 and test this for myself. I would currentl guess that it's a dependency of webpack-dev-server or something causing this . Was fixed with v2.10.1 of webpack-dev-server. Of course not, why should we disable HNR on purpose? \nWhat's confusing me is that you say that happens for old projects as well. Otherwise I would have thought we have a problem with the new webpack-dev-server setup (which works well for me).\nDid you change anything about the environment of your project folders? HNR sometimes has problems with special characters in paths or folders that are controlled by other apps, i.e. Dropbox, Vagrant... In the latter case, using the poll option for webpacks watcher \n. Ah, yes. \nThat part of the devservrr was responsible for reloading the page when index.html changes. \nHowever. the html-webpack-plugin we use to process index.html doesn't play nice with webpack >=3 in that regard, so we had to remove that code when we moved to webpack 3 a while back. \nI assume you moved to webpack 3 on your own... . Yes. As I said we removed it as well. . the html-webpack-plugin does that. You would have to check the README or ask in their github how to fix it.\nAlterntively, ask on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org if people now a trick.. HMR often doesn't work in paths that contain special characters (e.g. ( ), or when the project is in a folder controlled by another app / system (e.g. dropbox/googledrive, Vagrant, VirtualBox).\nIf none of that applies, you would have to ask the webpack community how to debug this, we don't really know the webpack internals at pley here.\nClosing this as it's also a duplicate of #1209 . That's what webpack aliases can be used for. The template already comes with one, @/ is an alias for the /src directory. \nSo you can simply do this: '@/assets/img01.png'. Notw that you would have to prepend that with a tilde (~) when used in a template or scss. Normal css files don't require it though - postcss handles this differently. . Thanks. Probably some leftovers from a merge. . I don't think that we will add it to this template, but vue-cli 3.0 support presets - then we can have a storybook preset. . Hey, thanks for wanting to contribute, apprechiated! If you need help, just ask. \nAs a small note, I would not qualify this as as \"bug\" because /config/index.js is not meant to dynamically add any dev server options to the webpack config. It's just a static subset of options that we extracted out of webpack config for easier access. Adding options to this file will do nothing. \nBut adding https support can be considered a worthwhile enhancement, so go ahead :). Oh, I always squash PRs, but this one needs it badly - I fought with circleci config forever \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 . Oh right, the fact that the test.sh file is still there is an oversight. \nAnd I should add an npm script to run those tests in sequence. \nFor CI we run them in parallel with circleci commands, that's why in haven't added a script yet. \n  . These files don't get loaded individually. \nIn development, they are included in the JavaScript bundle and then injected into the head section. I'm production,  they are bundled together as one css file. \nSo the fact that you don't see any requests for the files is not an issue. And if the files could not be imported during build, webpack would have shown an error. \nDid you receive any errors? \n  . Well, then you will probably be better off asking on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org, more people to help out there. \nShare some reproduction code if possible. \nI will close this issue since I don't see how this is a problem with the template specifically . I'll reopen to answer later - short version: since this always worked, no other problems of this kind were reported and no recent changes were made that affect this, I would judge that its rather a usage error than bug, so it's not an issue for github, it's a question for the forum. \n\nHow can I tell from the output or browser, that the CSS file is loaded correctly?\n\nOpen devtools, look at elements tab and look of the styles are there. . So is there anything left here? . I'll have to side with @heinzdmx on this one. The plugin doesn'T seem to be of the kind you should be using without knowing what it does or what risks you are taking by using it.\nAlso, this template does not attempt to provide a setup that will work perfectly for gigantic projects - those will always need individual optimization. \nSo I would argue that this is a kind of plugin that users should add at their own risk, once they actually have a performance problem they need to solve.. Please consider using forum.vuejs.org for project-related questions. This issue is closed, and github issues in general are not supports tickets.. It just means that it gives you a very good deception emu experience because it's configured with many good things that make your development experience better. \nYou can check the rest of the docs to learn what that entails. . That was my phone trying to auto correct \ud83d\ude02 \nI meant \"development experience\" . Are you on windows? I just fixed a bug concerning this for windows users, but haven't pushed it to master yet. You can test the develop branch . Tomorrow late evening at the latest.  may be in the next two hours. I'm on a trip right now, but have my laptop in the hotel. \n  . Give it another try, should work now.. > try to display it in the code, \n\nWhat exactly did you do? \ndoes the Vue logo show up for you? \n\nWhile I'm on mobile atm and can't verify, I can say that I installed the latest template multiple times in the last days and the logo always showes up, which means that images from ./assets do work as expected. . Yeah that never worked that way. \nIf you want to define the path in your js,  it have to use require('. /....'). It may have worked by accident, since the dev server served static content from the project root before the recent update. \nBut it would have broken in production. \nRead The template docs about handling static assets. \n  . Probably related to this: https://status.npmjs.org/incidents/41zfb8qpvrdj. According to npm status, the problem was resolved. Please open a new issue if the problem persists  . We generally have some issues with CI tests, which is why I submitted #1218.\nBut you submitted 2 versions of this PR, can the old one be closed? . Closed it.. by you can close your own PRs yourself I think ;). What's your node version? . Versions look fine, no idea what may cause that on your end. All. Is working fine for me. . Hey, Thanks for your work on this!\nHowever, we already have a longstanding PR open with #797, which I intend to review and merge after #1218\nSo I doub that this PR will make it. However I would appreachiate if you would comment on the work in #797 and add feedback from your experience. Hm, I could swear that this has been iced before. \nMaybe some merge or rebase screwed it up again. \nWill fix it. . If you need to fix it yourself quickly, just change the alias from '@' to '@/'. Hm that doesn't work - why? I swear that worked before. Jesus ...\nWill look at this again tommorrow.. It seems we may have to switch to some other alias. I've seen ~being used in nuxt, but that also has a special meaning in e.g. sass-loader: @import(~bootrap.scss)\nWe could simply use @@ .... looks funny but not that much worse than  a single @. Re-classifying as an enhancement, more fitting imho.. Thanks for the feedback, that's a great list of possible replacements. \nPersonally like $ or #,  but I'm afraid  t least $ could be problematic because it's used as a special chat in aliases, defining the end of the require string. \nI'll play a bit wirh both to check for limitations, and ask everyone who's interested to do the same. . I think we will indeed go with # - I've tested it a bit and it seems to work fine in all scenarios.. Because there might be packages whose name starts with src.. That's to be expected, if I understand your problem correctly. \nJest exits with an exit code of 1 if any tests fail, which npm always interprets as an error. . That would work, yes. . https://forum.vuejs.org/t/vuejs-templates-webpack-change-entry-point/25242. \u00cet is as much (or little) supported as previous versions:\n\nVue itself supports >=IE9\nBut to use some ES6 Javascript features (like Promises) you need to include polyfills.\n\nWhat problems to you have when trying to use IE? Please be more specific.. I don't speak chinese, I can't read this :(. Thanks for The info @hornet-wing.!. upstream issue was fixed with WDS 2.11 (Release log). The template tests require node >=8.\nI'll update the engines field in package.json accordingly. \n. Edit: oh snap, I'm an idiot! \nthat code also runs on normal template installs! And those should of course not require node 8\nI'll fix this in the next hours. . Found a few minutes right now, and it's fixed!\nThanks for the report @TheSirC . Thanks :). What exactly is this about? just the Typescript typo?. duplicate PR. Thanks!. This is not a help forum for webpack questions. Its the issue tracker for bugs and features related to this temnplate only.\nPlease consider asking your question on forum.vuejs.org, chat.vuejs.org or Stack Overflow.. From the webpack docs:\n\nWhen set to true this option bypasses host checking. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED as apps that do not check the host are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks.\n\nI don't think we should add convenience config options that aren't recommended. If users need them, they should add them themselves and know what they are doing.. Hey @ErickPetru \nThatnks for your help! Unfortunately I'm not really familiar with the whole gitbook setup, and am very short on free time in the coming weeks, so I won't have uch time to look into this. \nCould you create a PR with the new folder structure? That would speed things up, hopefully.. You appearantly use some npm package that was \nwritten with ES6 JavaScript and has not been transpiled to ES5 with Babel. \nIf you can find out which it is, you can add it's path to babel-loader's include option. . Thanks!. Well, you are using import(...) instead of import '.... ', which creates an async chunk that is loaded later. \nSolution: use the right syntax. \nimport '../node_modules/vuetify/dist/vuetify.min.css'. https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/1278\nThis is essentially caused by a dependency of webpackdev-server\nFor the time being, you can downgrade to 2.9.*. Fixes in webpack-dev-server@2.11.1. Better yet: provide a name: for each component. \nEslint-plugin-vue can help you remind you. \nNot meaning to play the bad parent, but conversations like this are better suited for forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org. Well, just sharing The built files doesn't allow us to say anything specific about how to solve this for you \nThe issue is generally known, and has to do with vue-loader injecting styles lazily in development (when used with style loader) \nThere's long ongoing discussions a bout this in the vue-loader repository. \nIndependent of that its probably a bad idea to rely on css occurrence order for overwriting styles in components in general. \nI would guess you are importing bootstrap too late in your main.js or something. . Seems to be an upstream issue? https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest/issues/48. The development setup uses style-loader, it doesn't extract css on purpose because we want hot reloading to work for styles. \nThe error you are experiencing likely has to do with a misconfigured NODE_ENV environment variable. \nOpen an issue and describe your problem. . You should not have this env variable set permanently on your machine. \nThe project commands will choose the right default value for you. . Seems your vue-cli installation is broken. . Not related to this template. . No, the help text for vue init works fine. \nif you read the error stack trace, the error is in: \nusr/lib/node_modules/vue-cli/lib/check-version.js:19:34\nWhich runs before the template is actually downloaded and installed. \nSo it's either a bug in vue-cli or a problem with your local install. \nIt's not related to this template as far as I can see. . I'm not sure whats going on here since this template does not ask you if you want to include if_or or something. \nI also have no what flags you are talking about, can you clarify? . Okay, I understand.\nBut we use a locally installed vue-cli package in all of our automated tests in CircleCI, which also run on docker, and those work fine:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml\nSo maybe it's related to the docker image you use, or the npm version installed or something else you do.\n. @adimit I only now noticed that you installed vue-cli with ^1.0.0 version. Why? That would install a very old version which very probably doesn't worm wit this template. \n@MarkProffitt that doesn't apply to yiu, obviously. I would assume your situation is different, what're exactly is happening? \n. > latest: 2.9.2\n\ninstalled: 2.0.2\n\nYour version is outdated. If that helper is missing, you do not use the most recent version. . So vue -v says 2.9.2, yet installing the template fails? \nIn that case: absolutely no idea where to start. \nIf that command doesn't return 2.9.2 even though you did npm install vue-cli@latest -g, then your node npm installation is probably messed up. . Hi jake!\nWe currently don't want to add any more options for specific libraries, so this wont happen.\n. I'm not 100% sure I understand your issue, but;\n\nin which the browser is assuming the assets are on http://localhost/static/[js/css/]/... instead of http://localhost/prodbuild/static/[js/css]/...\n\nthat's the expoected behaviour if you leave the default setting for the assetsPublicPath`in/config/index.jsas it is:/`.\nIt's an absolute path, and this behaviour is intended - it's required for vue-router to work correctly in history mode.\nYou can change the assetsPublicPath under the build: key to something else, e.g. /prodbuild/, or ./ to make it work in your scenario.\n. Hm, In guess the hardcoded import for the font in fontawesome is messing something up.\nWon'T have much time to look into this in the coming days, sorry.. Try chaging this line:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L79\nto this:\njavascript\nname: NODE_ENV === 'production'\n  ? utils.assetsPath('../../fonts/[name].[hash:7].[ext]')\n  : utils.assetsPath('fonts/[name].[hash:7].[ext]'). You don't have to, it should work.\nAsk question on forum.vuejs.org please.. > Ask question on forum.vuejs.org please.. Those are too many different changes at once. Maybe cut not into single features and re-submit them, then we can discuss them . That should indeed not happen, to my best knowledge the config is set up to keep hashes intact in that scenario. \nUnfortunately this would require some sleeper investigation which I might not find time for in the coming 6-7 weeks or so, I'm on holiday and then preparing to move to a new home. \nI welcome any help on this. . Hm, Im not aware that this is a general problem with the plugin. Maybe we have to switch the order up? . The only thing I could find was a supposedly fixed bug in that plugin from 7 months ago... \nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/5184. I sonst understand - is /op-ui in node_modules or is it in a sibling directory to /src?\nAnyway, I would assume that there's a different Babel con fig in that folder which gets used instead of yours or. Something. . Okay, now I'm even more confused as to why you are building a project within node_modules, that can't be a good practice, but anyway ...\nI can only assumeit has to do with how babel / babel-loader resolve the babelrc settings depending on the working directrory?\nNo real idea, sorry. Never seen a setup like yours or even thought about it.\nYou might be better of asking on forum.vuejs.org as this is not really a usecase this template was designed for.. I will close this as it's more of a webpoack question that directly related to the intended usage of this template.\nAs suggested, please ask on our forum, Stack OVerflow etc.. Babel should transpile that, and I never came across this.\nAre you sure the .bablerc config is intact?. Could you try and downgrade babel-eslint to  7.*?. I read this: https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/578\nThere's no answer about this yet but seems that at least on windows, babel-eslint >=8 doesn't work with babel 6. I tested it on OSX and didn't have any problems.\nWould you be interested in making a PR to downgrade babel-eslint in the template?. I found this: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9020#issuecomment-354374450\nWhich says that this option doesn'T work for autoprefixer <=7 -  but we have 7.1 in our dependencies.\nCan you check which version is installed in your /node_modules?. > But I'm not sure if that is the problem\nI would assume that's the issue indeed, if autoprefixer <7 doesn't support major.\nhttps://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano/blob/v3.10.0/package.json#L26. Well, it must be something about either autoprefixer or cssnano. None of out code in the webpack config or anwhere else in this template uses the browserslist.  And since npm run dev works (unless I misunderstood), we can assume that autoprefixer works and it must be cssnano (or one of its dependencies), which is the only one of the two running only during build.. I'll leave this open to track it. . I don't see such problems, can you provide a real reproduction for us to evaluate? \nSince EnvironmentPlugin is just a wrapper around the DefinePlugin afaik, I would rather suspect a mistake on your part without such a reproduction . Hi there!\nI close this issue because of inactivity. If you want to follow up on this issue, please open a new one, and provide the necessary information (a working reproduction etc.) in that issue.. Can you provide the stack trace?. Maybe you have to adjust the context setting o f webpack, since you seem to have nested your project in another subdirectory: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L23\nNot sure, give it a try.\nIf thatr doesn't help, please upload a repository for me to clone with a minimal reproduction.. Those are much too big/ opinionated changes, sorry. . Have you tried installing it? . Will try to reproduce this tonight, seems very strange.\nThis is the module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin\nHere it's defined in package.json: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/package.json#L111\nAnd here it's being imported: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/webpack.prod.conf.js#L12\nI really don't see where this should break .... Thanks!. If that really is the case, you should rather open an issue in the main Vue repo. This is not a feature of this template.. I would be open to that if it's  common problem. I personally don't have much experience with that, so I can't tell.. Good point. . So I thought about this some more and agree with @whjvenyl - we should not add this.. There should be nothing for you to do, this template is pre configured to extract all css, from .vue and .js files as well. . Are you talking about dev or build? \nIn build, all css is extracted into one file. \nIf that doesn't work for you, please provide a repository with a reproduction. In dev we inject all styles into head for hot reloading. . Please try this: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/1266#issuecomment-361201523\nI wilkl look into this further at a later time. I'm very short on free time in the coming days, so it may be a while.. Damnit. This seems to be really tricky. Relative paths are of he devil :D. What exactly is happening instead of the expected behaviour?. Reading the last paragraph of webpack-dev-server's docs for proxy, I think you probably have to do this:\njavascript\nproxyTable: [{\n  context: ['/tf', '/hd', '/activities'],\n  target: 'http:.....'\n}]. Closing for inactivity by OP. This is not a big and not related to the template. \nDevtools don't work by default in production mode. Try setting Vue.config.devtools to true. \nhttps://vuejs.org/v2/api/#devtools. I missed that line, sorry. \nPlease open an issue in the devtoola repository with a reproduction that the guys can run for themselves. \nThe problem is most likely not related to this template. . @pmesgari Any further input? I can't really reproduce this ... Can you provide a repository with a minimal production?. This question is only indirectly related to the template and likely not bug. \nI would kindly ask you to use forum.vuejs.org for way rations like these, to keep the issue tracker focused on bugs etc. . Please open an isssue I the vue-loader repository. . Running npm run build --report\nIt will open a visualization of all the created bundles/chunks and their contents. That was a fat finger mistake. Can you rpovide a bit more info, what does \"does not work\" mean? I can't work on this right now and others might, if the input was more explicit.. Hm, that's because it relies on a special npm env car being set when it receives --report. Firebase is more than 710kb minified, that's half of your bundle right there! \nVue+vuex+router is <100kB minified, so the rest of your bundle must be made up by something else. \nThe map file has nothing to do with bundle-size, no. \nSo use the bundle analyzer to find out what yiur. Bundle is made up of. Please ask this on the forum.vuejs.oeg. We use circle/node:6.12-browsers currently: \nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml#L4. No. I don't know the package you refer to and you didn't share any code about how you used that package or created the worker.\nAlso, we have great forum at forum.vuejs.org for questions like these, (about how to use a 3rd party package with the template).. Well, it doesn't. package.json requires \"^2.5.2\", which is a semver version range and boils down to: \"the latest patch release in the 2.5 version range, but at least 2.5.2\". > Sorry, it doesn't do that.\nHow did you verify that? . Thanks. . This is a known problem with font-awesome and similar laibraries that come with fonts etc.\nTo learn more about it, see this:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader#problems-with-url\nAs to the solution:\nfont-awesome (You are still using v4, I think) allows you to set a vairable that tells SCSS where lo look for the fonts:\nhttps://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/fa-4/scss/_variables.scss#L4\nIt should be set Like this:\n```html\n\n  // I can remember what was correct:\n  $fa-font-path: \"font-awesome/fonts\";\n  $fa-font-path: \"~font-awesome/fonts\";\n  $fa-font-path: \"./node_modules/font-awesome/fonts\";</p>\n<p>@import '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';\n  @import '../node_modules/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome';\n\n```. We won't add font-awesome as an option to the template, I don't think so. That's too specific. \nBut I have a feeling we could make this work by adding url-resolve-loader into the loader chain for *css resources . \nI'll look into that. . Has it been deprecated or removed? Is it still required for versions before 22.4?\nWouldn't that be a breaking change? \nWe would at least have to bump the dependency on package.json accordingly. . Thanks. FYI I'm moving this weekend so it might take some days till I get to merge and release this and other prs . Yeah do a PR please . you should pass optios here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/develop/template/build/utils.js#L62\n. Wrong branch . No. No, you misunderstand. dev.env.js is only used to inject variables as \"environment\" variables into the app - they will not be accessible within the node process that runs webpack. \nYou should just set the host directly in config/index.js. . That refers to an actual environment variable set when you run the dev server: \nHOST=0.0.0.0 npm run dev. Or, to repeat myself, change it in config/index.js, you don't have to use an environment variable. . That syntax isn't supported in node 6, which is the minimum node version this template intends or to support. \nI can't merge this for that reason. . It is supposed to be there. It's used in the error notifications if they are activated. . So \n1. This doesn't seem to be the same issue\n2. Please use proper syntax highlighting, see githubs help for instructions \n3. Please provide the actual code that failing. The error is not that useful on its own. . Closing for inactivity. You probably need to read this: \nhttps://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/history-mode.html. the gh-pages branch is built from the /docsdirectory. Any changes should be made against the develop branch.. Hi, sorry this isn't working for you.\n\nHow can different behaviors on different platforms be possible?\n\nIn most cases, this is related either to paths (\\ vs. /)  or to case-sensitivity (some OS / file-systems are case-sensitive, others aren't).\nSo is the postcss config file written in all lowercase? Where is it stored, did you alter it?\nI'm not quite sure what to look for, to be honest, a runnable reproduction would be helpful, as the error explanation is a bit sparse, a stack trace would be helpful.\n\nI don't know if this is the acceptable solution.\n\nNot really. That option make sure that normal *css files are run through postcss for autoprefixing etc.. Question: why did you add this as a dependency? \n\"postcss-load-config\": \"^1.2.0. No feedback from OP, closing. . > I am using this boilerplate \nWith which options? did you include Vue-router? the urls you show look simply like urls created when using vue-router with its default hash mode.\n\nand whenever I use Vue Router and wants to go any particular URL, it creates issues, by automatically adding \"#\" in URL\n\nwhat issues does it create? What does the router config look like, what does the URL look like that you want to go to, and what goes wrong?\nYou have to give us a little bit more than 2 sentences to enable us to help you - preferably, runnable code.\n. Not easily. Create a new project with testing, and copy the / test die to your current project. \nAlso copy over all additional dependencies to package.json. \nYou might want to have a look at the template for package.json here in this repository to see which dependencies get added if you choose i.e. Jest for unit tests. \nThen run npm install again in your project to install those dependencies. . you're using vue-cli 3 which is a rewrite. The init plugin now lives as a separate plugin.\nYou can find the docs here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/dev/docs/cli.md#pulling-vue-cli2x-templates-legacy\nI would suggest to use the new cli though.. That will be fixed in vue-loader 15. Please use the forum \nforum.vuejs.org. We might switch this template to webpack 4 in some time. When we do that, we will use rust plugin as well. Please use forum.vuejs.org. We started to write the version into config/index.js sometime last year. . That would only be used when you use a webpack-based test runner, which jest isn't. \nThis is an inconsistency left over from the past where we only supported a karma/mocha setup with webpack. I don't understand what you mean. . Guys, please use the forum for questions about stuff like this. \nForum.vuejs.org. I have no idea what I should do with that description. \nDo you have code or at least a concrete error message so that I can try and understand what you mean? . What does that have to do with this template? . I have no idea to be honest. Evan wrote that css probably 2 years ago . When the path comes from Js, you have to use require():\njavascript\nreturn require(\"../assets/\" + this.card.jpg  + \".jpg\"). Please provide an actual runnable reproduction. No. I'm not planning on adding anything to this template.\nVue CLI 3 has been stable for half a year almost. This template won't be developed any further in favor of Vue CLI 3. I have no  idea what you are talking about . > In fact, I'm not really sure how the new CLI will affect this project. As I see it, the new CLI is more of a paradigm shift than a rewrite. Someone with more experience than I have will have to weigh in on whether this project is even relevant for CLI 3 projects.\nThat's right. vue-cli 2 was basically just pulling templates like this webpack template from github.\nvue-cli 3 doesn't rely on project templates anymore. Instead, it extracted all the config and dependencies for webpack, eslint and so forth into npm packagesthat cn ge integrated into any vue-cli 3 project as plugins.\nPlugins can of course also be written by the community. They can alter the project's configuration, ad dependencies, add files from templates, add npm script commands and much more.\nThat means that there's not really a need for templates such as this webpack template or the pwa template. Instead, everyone can mix and match the feature they need by installing the corresponding plugins.\nSo what does that mean for the future of this template? Personally, I don't see  reason to start a new project with this template anymore. vue-cli comes with all of its features and then some, and it has the advantage of being easily upgradable, which this template isn't.\nBut nonetheless, thanks to @noamkfir for the work on this PR. I will hopefully merge it soon, but that will be the last bigger change that I will make to this template. As a consequence of my explanations about vue-cli 3, I don't see it as worthwhile to put much time into it anymore.\nBut if someone want to take over maintanance, we could certainly talk about this. And there's always the possibility to fork this project :). @Garito every single feature of this template is already included in vue-cli 3.\nAnd if you do a quick search on npmjs.com, you will find that there are already dozens of plugins available for it, including things like vuetify, i18n, Apollo graphql etc. pp. . Far too opinionated, sorry. . You likely installed @vue/cli, which is the 3.0 version and a complete rewrite. \nIt doesn't use templates anymore, and doesnt have an init command anymore, but a create command. \nThe old, 2.* init command was extracted into a plugin package, called @vue/cli-init\nInstall it globally and vue init webpack will work again. But I recommend to just use the new create instead - the new CLI is in RC state already and much better than this template in many ways \nFor further information, please read the docs of the new cli at cli.vuejs.org. This contains stuff we to vuetify, maybe this PR was a mistake? . This is the wrong repository. You are looking for vuejs/vue-cli. Oh, of course it should. \n. Corrected.\n. ...indeed. \n. They will, technically. I thought I leave them in to make things clear and not take any chances of it exporting the runtime-only for some people depending on when 2.0 goes live on npm and reaches the users, and when that export change is done etc. \nBut it's not nessessary. \n. Agreed\n. since this is already mentioned in Line 5 of the README, this should be removed.\n. Lines 20 and 21 can also be removed, this is already explained in Line 5 of README\n. Note: this is not really related to this PR, just some added commenting, might help someone reading it.\n. The sec server is also used for testing. Is it wise to override the 'testing' environment? \n. agreed\n. Thanks for the ping, totally forgot about this over the weekend. Will do it later. \n. @chrisvfritz  Done\n. Fun fact: This typo originated in webpack itself in 1.0.0, and was fixed in Febuary of 2014:\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/commit/48aad3eeee3424e9150cce8df92cb5467213f40c#diff-da313f802aa85bbb07211a9399e04f95R63\nBoth spellings works for legacy reasons.\n. I don't think this is relevant to this PR?. I don't think this is relevant to this PR?. Keys only have to be strings if they contain a hyphen. These changes seem unnessessary.. this file belong in this PR. Why?. ...and this shouldn't be deleted either.\nThere are many other changes that don'T belong here, and I will not comment on all of them.. I think we should priorize .vue over .json, wouldn't you agree?. We don't have to use LoaderOptionsPlugin with vue-loader, you can specify these options in the loader rule:\nhttps://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/configurations/advanced.html (scroll down to Werbpack 2 section). I think we don't have to use LoaderOptionsPlugin as well:\nhttps://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader/issues/148\nCan you give it  a try? If we end up having to use LoaderOptionsPlugin, please add a comment explaining that this is temporary until eslint-loader supports webpack2's options syntax.. Can't find webpack2 equivalent resolve.modules in your config:\nhttps://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules. should not be removed - it's just resolveLoader.modules now:\nhttps://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveloader. Oh, right.. Oh, right again :D. That's a bit disappointing but we an deal with it.\nPlease ad the aforementioned comment and it's fine.. I assume it was meant as a safeguard in case people add other paths to the included paths array.\nBut I think we could remove it to trim some fat here.. Why would we want to ignore vue files?!? . Can you explain what the use of this command would be? Pug files or templates in. Vue files should. Be handled by webpack, shouldn't they? . Why is that necessary? . When we talked about adding a check for 'testing' environment, I didn't think about skipping the opn(uri) - I was thinking about skipping the whole portfinder logic.\nThe point is: for e2e tests, we currently try to access the dev-server through the port that is defined in the config (see this line). If the portfinder starts the def-server at a different port because that port is in use, e2e tests will connect to that wrong port anyway.\nSo either we find a way to tell the e2e test runner about the new found port, or we have to skip portfinder completely hen running e2e tests.. 1. Where does option.usePostCSS come from? It's not to be found in /config/index.js, not in any of the webpack config files. This should be documented someway.\nIs the idea to simply add it to the styleLoader code like this?\n```javascript\n// in webpack.base.conf.js:\nrules: utils.styleLoaders({ sourceMap: config.dev.cssSourceMap, usePostCSS: true })\n``\n. Oh, right - sorry, I missed that.. I'm not aware of akarma devcommand. What is that?. 1. I think!==` is better, stylistically.\n2. Just thinking: Could this break anything for a relative path ('./')?. Oh, right.  thanks! . Ooops! . Because this piece of code is injected into the client bundle in dev mode and not transpiled - which means it breaks in older browsers.. this (comment above this one for the same line) has to be tested before merge.. @eddyerburgh Since we are leaving the karma setup available, I don't think we should remove this docs section. \nWe should rather leave that docs in, but prepend the page with new infos about jest.. shouldn't that be {{#if_eq runner \"jest\"}}?. You seem to have some leftovers from an older merge conflict.... since we are leaving the karma/mocha setup in place, the eslint config should probably also leave this in.\nIt should be conditional:\njavascript\n{\n  \"env\": {{{#if_eq runner \"karma\"}}\n    \"mocha\": true{{/if_eq}}{{#if_eq runner \"jest\"}}\n    \"jest\"{{/if_eq}}\n  }{{#if_eq runner \"karma\"}},\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"expect\": true,\n    \"sinon\": true,\n    \"jest\": true\n  }{{/if_eq}}\n}. Hm, that merge doesn't look like it's supposed to I think ... the webpack-dev-server is new in the developbranch, while yours was still built on the old dev-server - so the former should stay in and the latter should go out.\nSimilarly, the other additions to package.json down in this file are all \"bringing back\" dependencies of the old dev-server.\nBut we might simply resolve this during / after the merge ... That has to go definitely, it's not required to make object rest spread work - to the contrary, it would probably breka most builds using ES modules in webpack 2 and upwards. . What I mean is that this is the option we want:\nobjectAssign: 'Object.assign',\nand this is the option we don't want:\ntransforms: {  // turn off the `with` removal\n+      stripWith: false\nso the latter should be removed from this PR. We only need the former.. actually I think we don't need this since preprocessors (SASS, LESS, Stylus) will handle @import themselves, so there won't be any left for css-loader to care about.\njavascript\nconst importLoaders = options.usePostCSS && !loader ? 1 : 0\nthat should be enough.. I think that config is only required if e2e || (unit && runner === 'karma') - jest doesn't use webpack.. good catch. Please add  a bold warning that this branch is not considered stable and can contain bugs or not build at all, so use at your own risk.. could you move this line so it's right above autoprefixer? That's where it belongs. Thanks! :). So this want not a bad idea in hindsight - this will break if the user has decided against using eslint during the project init. Will fix it.. This would have to be wrapped in a handlebars conditional {{#if_eq lintConfig 'airbnb'}}. Oh. Sometimes I'm stupid :). I'll merge this and then remove some of the node-spcific exceptions, because this is a frontend-template, and you are likely not gonna write express routes in it - that would be something for a SSR-focussed template.. Hey @gucong3000 Can you explain to me what this post hook does? I'm horrbile with bash.. Reading through a few old node issues (e.g. https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/2318, https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/5841) i think we might just have to add shell: true here to make it run properly on windows.\n@sudo-suhas Maybe you can try that?. Awesome! . There's a call to that function further below in the rules section, that should be wrapped in the same handlebars check. . Right, my mistake. Thanks.. I added these notes to that people get the connection between the commands and the NODE_ENV the set. These define the \"mode\" the app is running in.. See /test/e2e/runner.js: \nHere we set NODE_ENV to test, but for our e2e tests we run the webpack dev server with webpack.prod.conf.js, because the want to run e2e tests against a devserver that serves files like in production. \nTherefore, we have to use a second env variable as a workaround to make the production config behave like NODE_ENV === 'production' for e2e tests.. Since we now aggregate variables and stingify their values in /build/utils, we don't have to stringify them here anymore - so no more '\" \"'double quotes! . we set the NODE_ENV to test in the karma config, so BABEL_ENV will fall back to this.. this can actually be removed, leftover from an experiment.. See /test/e2e/runner.js: \nHere we set NODE_ENV to test, but for our e2e tests we run the webpack dev server with webpack.prod.conf.js, because the want to run e2e tests against a devserver that serves files like in production. \nTherefore, we have to use a second env variable as a workaround to make the production config behave like NODE_ENV === 'production' for e2e tests.. There's a package that makes this even easier imho: gh-pages\nHave you considered it? . Thanks! We still have to add the actual property to /config/index.js file so people can know about the option's existance without studying the webpack files.. ",

The problem boils down to this. Would be great if someone could help.\nI am getting the errors with the vue-router if I use <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.0.1/vue.js\"></script> in the html page directly (and not use the import Vue inside main.js).\nHowever, if I remove the CDN script tag and use rather use the import Vue from 'vue' inside the main.js then the same above code is working fine without problem.\nTo double check, I have compared the content from the CDN with the local node_module Vue content, and they are same. Loading order is also same.\nWhy is this behavior? How to take advantage of the CDN hosted vue in such cases?\n. Thanks. Wondering, how is the index.html got copied to the output (even though it is not inside the static folder) ? \n. Here is the basic code to reproduce the problem. After creating a sample app based on this webpack template, overwrite the content with below:\nindex.html\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\nvue-webpack\n\n\n\n built files will be auto injected \n \n \n\n\n```\nmain.js\n```\n//import Vue from 'vue'       <- comment out the local import\nimport App from './App'\nimport Hello from './components/Hello'\nVue.use(VueRouter);\nvar router = new VueRouter({\n    mode: 'history',\n    saveScrollPosition: true,\n    routes: [\n        { path: '/', component: Hello },\n    ]\n});\n/ eslint-disable no-new /\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  render: h => h(App),\n  router: router\n})\n```\nApp.vue\n<template>\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <router-view></router-view>\n  </div>\n</template>\nYou should see error\n[Vue warn]: Unknown custom element: <router-view> - did you register the component correctly?\nNote that both Vue-Router and Vue are loaded from CDN. \nIf instead of loading through script tag, if you load the vue through import in the main.js it will work fine (with vue-router still being loaded from CDN)\nNote sure two copies of vue... reasoning is correct. Because, in both cases vue-router is loading from CDN. Not sure how loading the vue with import will make the vue-router from CDN not load the 2nd copy.\nIf vue-router needs a copy of vue internally, it will always need it, irrespective of if vue is being loaded from CDN or not. May be something else is going wrong (unless the vue npm version is coming packed with vue-router that is some how overwriting the vue-router from the CDN so as to not create 2 copies - but that is not the case. If you remove the vue-router script tag from the HTML, it will throw vue-router undefined error, which means no other packed vue-router is overtaking it)\n. Thanks - the dev vs production info is what was missing. As long as it works in production, its great. Thanks for the external tip. Will look into it. It is helpful.\n. ",

They seem to be some runtime reference or something and not actually saved to the file system. Maybe the browser isn't connecting to webpack to get those modified sources?\n. Ok cool that's what seemed like was happening. Here's the config.js - I am proxying all requests to it as far as I can tell and have tested:\nApp Structure:\n- vue\n  - build\n  - src\n  - test\n  - config.js\n- View\n  - Layouts\n    - default-source.ctp\n    - default.ctp\n- webroot\n``` js\n// see http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack for documentation.\nvar path = require('path')\nmodule.exports = {\n  build: {\n    index: path.resolve(__dirname, '../View/Layouts/default.ctp'),\n    source: path.resolve(__dirname, '../View/Layouts/default-source.ctp'),\n    assetsRoot: path.resolve(__dirname, '../webroot'),\n    assetsSubDirectory: 'static',\n    assetsPublicPath: '/',\n    productionSourceMap: true\n  },\n  dev: {\n    port: 3000,\n    proxyTable: {\n      '/': {\n        target: 'http://directory.dev',\n        changeOrigin: true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n``\n. Oh alright. I just get the index.html file in the vue directory when I hit localhost if I just proxy the API. So in this case do I not dev with localhost?\n. Ok so the issue I'm having then is thedefault.ctp` has PHP in it that needs to be rendered, so the dev server can't render that. But this is the same as how Laravel or Rails would do it. So that's why I get confused, as I have followed the directions in http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/backend.html but still get output with PHP tags - how does webpack dev server account for the PHP needing to be rendered on the app? I've now set my config like this: \n``` js\n// see http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack for documentation.\nvar path = require('path')\nmodule.exports = {\n  build: {\n    index: path.resolve(__dirname, '../View/Layouts/default.ctp'),\n    assetsRoot: path.resolve(__dirname, '../webroot'),\n    assetsSubDirectory: 'static',\n    assetsPublicPath: '/',\n    productionSourceMap: true\n  },\n  dev: {\n    port: 3000,\n    proxyTable: {\n      '/api': {\n        target: 'http://directory.dev',\n        changeOrigin: true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n.

Ok, so the problem lies with the plugin html-minify.\nit needs this specific way of writing the comment:\n<!--[if gt IE 9]><!-->\n    <div id=\"app\"></div>\n<!--<![endif]-->\n. @nickspiel , I tried your fix and it mostly behave as it should.\nBut when I have fonts in the static folder and the build \"final\" folder is in a sub-directory (ex: site.com/events/party/static/fonts), the path in the css is still site.com/static/fonts.\nJust to specify a bit more the settings:\nApp.vue:\n<style lang=\"scss\" src=\"assets/sass/app.scss\"></style>\n...\nin a file imported in app.scss, _typography.scss:\n...\n@font-face {\n    font-family: 'my-font';\n    src: url('~/static/fonts/my-font.eot?5bfcg7');\n    src: url('~/static/fonts/my-font.eot?5bfcg7#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\n         url('~/static/fonts/my-font.ttf?5bfcg7') format('truetype'),\n         url('~/static/fonts/my-font.woff?5bfcg7') format('woff'),\n         url('~/static/fonts/my-font.svg?5bfcg7#my-font') format('svg');\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-style: normal;\n}\n...\nin config/index.js:\nbuild: {\n    env: require('./prod.env'),\n    index: path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist/events/party/index.html'),\n    assetsRoot: path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist/events/party'),\n    assetsPublicPath: '/events/party/',\n    assetsSubDirectory: 'static',\n    productionSourceMap: false\n}\n. Since I did not want to fiddle too much with the core of the template, I wrote an extra file fixpath.js in the build folder:\n```\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar config = require('../config');\nfunction getFiles (dir, files_){\n    files_ = files_ || [];\n    var files = fs.readdirSync(dir);\n    for (var i in files){\n        var name = dir + '/' + files[i];\n        if (fs.statSync(name).isDirectory()){\n            getFiles(name, files_);\n        } else {\n            files_.push(name);\n        }\n    }\n    return files_;\n}\nfunction replaceContent(filePath, stringToReplace, newString) {\n    if (!filePath || !stringToReplace || !newString) {\n        return console.log('some parameters are missing');\n    }\nfs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', function (err,data) {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.log(err);\n  }\n  var re = new RegExp(stringToReplace,\"g\");\n  var result = data.replace(re, newString);\n\n  fs.writeFile(filePath, result, 'utf8', function (err) {\n     if (err) {\n        return console.log(err);\n     }\n  });\n});\n\n}\n// Get all CSS files of the project\nvar fileList = getFiles(${config.build.assetsRoot}/${config.build.assetsSubDirectory}/css);\nfileList.forEach((file) => {\n    replaceContent(file, /${config.build.assetsSubDirectory}/fonts, ${config.build.assetsPublicPath}${config.build.assetsSubDirectory}/fonts);\n});\n```\nAnd in package.json in the scripts part:\n...\n\"build\": \"node build/build.js && npm run fixpath\",\n \"fixpath\": \"node build/fixpath.js\",\n...\nNot the best solution since I think it would be better to do something about it through postcss or something like that, but it does the trick for the moment.\n. It automatically gets the ${config.build.assetsPublicPath}${config.build.assetsSubDirectory} path from either dev or prod?\n. You have to import like that:\nimport * as d3 from 'd3';\n. @Awakening-j : basically, if you look at the D3 package.json in the node_modules folder, you would see which file is being called as 'main'.\nI am not 100% sure, but it looks like depending if you are using ES5 or ES6, you have to use either import * as d3 from 'd3'; or import d3 from 'd3';\nSo I don't think it is related to Vue cli   :)\n.

Vue explains the technical reasons why the convention exists, but that is not the only reason a convention might exist.\n\nIf the section of the documentation which talks about technical enforced conventions exemplifies naming of related things (file names) which could also benefit from a convention they are relevant even if for a different reason.\nPascalCase does NOT seem to appear in any of the examples of the section. Many other naming conventions would also be acceptable.

So, no ideas on how to do it without repeating the logic. Should we fix this in the template?\n. Is it possible in this version to specify a port via env variable?\n. Wouldn't being able to specify the port from env be desirable? The use case is being able to easily run tests in a different port than the one used for dev, without having to mess a lot with the configuration. This allows you to run the dev server and the tests in different ports at the same time for example.\n. The code I referenced in #241 supports both dev config and env variables: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/1.0/template/build/dev-server.js#L11\nHas this been removed in more recent versions?

Regarding fsevents, it is unrelated.\nEACCES means you don't have permissions to listen on the given address. I would guess it's due to firewall/antivirus settings.

I went and edited webpack.base.conf.js so vue key looks like so:\njs\nvue: {\n    loaders: utils.cssLoaders(),\n    postcss: [\n      require('autoprefixer')({\n        browsers: ['last 2 versions']\n      })\n    ]\n  }\nWhat's funny/strange though, is that webpack won't complain at all even though I didn't add autoprefixer to package.json at all. I don't get that, do you?\nAlso, this branch breaks hot-reload and I wasn't able to figure out why ... because I'm a webpack newbie + I kinda started hating on it while trying to make hot reload work. So this is my call for help if someone else wants to pick this 2.0 template up because I'm really not motivated fighting webpack :)\n. Huh, it works for me now too :) Have no idea what happened in between. I added autoprefixer now. Thanks for detailed explanation! :)\n.

We only need to decide into which branch we want to merge it (#270). I'm for master ;)\n. Closing in favor of #281.\n. @petervmeijgaard I'm really sorry. We did a force push against dist so this is probably the reason. Can you please re-open it?\n. Yes for the master please. We removed dist branch, because new master is now for Vue 2.0 as all other vuejs-templates. So we might want to merge this commit into master and 1.0 as well.\n. @LinusBorg I think it's safe to close this one, right?\n. @chrisvfritz not really sure what do you mean. Are you asking if dist is deprecated? In any case, I'm not sure, I don't really use or watch webpack template.\n\nI only know we have some extra code in vue-cli just to check if dist branch exists and use it if it does. I think we should remove it since vue-cli supports branches. Sorry, I might be off topic.\n. @chrisvfritz yes, that is correct. dist branch will be used by vue-cli by default (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/master/bin/vue-init#L116).\n. @LinusBorg are you sure? This means that old vue-cli versions have hardcoded dist branch lookup?\n. Yes, and also checkDistBranch is only for official templates so there should be no problem if we remove it.\n. Yeah, for sure. I also always favor explicitness \ud83d\udc4d \n. Less options = less config = better imho.\n. Hi @chrisvfritz! I'll do this tomorrow if it's ok with you? I'm barely from my vacation and had 100 other things to do first.\n. Eh, my fault, actually I forgot to mention anywhere (besides job of course) that I'll be having one.\nFirst thing that comest to mind is, what about yarn? :) But probably we don't need to care about it just yet. \nAnother, more important question that comest to my mind: should we move the logic directly to vue-cli and inform user after download? I know user can use/install vue-cli with different node version, but still, this way all templates could benefit from just adding engines part to package.json.\nOtherwise LGTM (I tried it locally and works fine). If it solves problems I'd merge this and try it out here and maybe later port to vue-cli, if or when it turns out to be useful.\n. @chrisvfritz I agree with you. What we might do instead is to put a comment around viewport and let users uncomment it if they need it. What do you both think about this? cc @anishkny \n. I agree @LinusBorg. One file to rule them all whenever possible.. Thanks! Fixing this now.\n. I agree with @chrisvfritz. I think we should keep official vue templates as simple as possible. If we are going to add router and vuex, I'd definitely do it as a separate template. Although on the other hand this means lot's of copy/pasta boiler plate thats already here (all webpack config and stuff).\nI'd use https://github.com/egoist/vuepack if I'd need full-stack-vue today :)\nI don't know, I'd keep it as simple as possible. If adding vue-router or vuex is hard to this template, I'd start fixing router or vuex (or their docs) instead.\n. ",

Hello! Please use our forum or Gitter for questions like this. The repo issue list is strictly for bug reports and feature requests.\nThanks.\n. Yeah I'd agree the best library for maintainability. \nHowever the development experience with Vue files is a little raw. Syntax and styling is off.\nTwo solutions:\nFork babel-istanbul-loader and self maintain or\nsee how much effort is required to improve the plugin to support html based files.\nMaybe a quick investigation on the later would be good, as it seems alot of tools seem to use the official version. \nIMO I think creating a babel-vue-script-parser plugin would be nice to extract html. This would be an agnostic solution to parse Vue file script content. \nTools like Ava, Jest, Istanbul ect would really benefit from a plugin like this.\nI would certainly suggest this approach, as Ava is an amazing testing tool. That has alot of React like testing Utils that we could leverage. Like snapshot testing. . /cc @posva. Note this is similar to a piece of.work I did to get stylelint to cover style tags. I could easily create a plugin to mimic this for script tags with babel. . Yeah certainly. @aasheer Please see the new recipe for ava.js and vue, this should help. https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/vue.md. Looks to me that the issue resides in the order of the helpers for Ava perhaps. Maybe change the setup helper to run last.\nI would need a reproduction if possible to help further.\n\"ava\": {\n    \"babel\": \"inherit\",\n    \"require\": [\n      \"ignore-styles\",\n      \"babel-core/register\",\n      \"./tests/unit/helpers/setup.js\"\n    ]\n},. Additionally there is this PR for vue-loader that solves the use of lang=\"postcss\". \nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/pull/1055. But what if you have multiple environments such as staging?\nYou build for then environment, you don't prod for the environment. Also there is nothing stopping you from changing. Good question we can probably have sub conditions for syntax. And as using plugin we could do less. \nScss is supported in node blob for files. \nLess is currently experimental, to i have avoided it currently. Also I think Less is very little used these days. Especially if starting a new project, as scaffolding is for new projects I think we can leave Less behind until stylelint fully supports it.\n. Probably best to use BABEL_ENV\nBabel will use either of these, but will probably be more clear of the use and cause less side affects. ",

    "grantcarthew": "Hi, I just want to add to @gazpachu answer above. I used a different syntax for my build/utils.js file like so:\n```js\nlet sassOptions = {\n    indentedSyntax: true\n  }\n  let scssOptions = {\n    includePaths: [\n      '~src/styles'\n    ],\n    data: '@import \"~src/styles/main\";'\n  }\n// http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader/en/configurations/extract-css.html\n  return {\n    css: generateLoaders(),\n    postcss: generateLoaders(),\n    less: generateLoaders('less'),\n    sass: generateLoaders('sass', sassOptions),\n    //  Make custom SASS available to all components https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\n    scss: generateLoaders('sass', scssOptions),\n    stylus: generateLoaders('stylus'),\n    styl: generateLoaders('stylus')\n  }\n```\nFor reference, the sass-loader supports all node-sass options. So in the above code you can add any of those options to the scssOptions object.. @alexmccabe When I posted that snippet above I didn't post the generateLoaders function. Checkout vue-foundation for a better example.. Hi @lehni. As stated in my last comment, see the vue-foundation template for reference. Here is the file with the answer for your question:\nhttps://github.com/hal0gen/vue-foundation/blob/master/build/utils.js\n. There should be a reference to vue-foundation here. You don't have to use the template if you don't want to. I created my project using the vue-cli and then copied the relevant parts from the template.. For reference if anyone else finds this issue, read here: #546. I've been thinking on this last night. Rather than some multi-option like changeBaseUrl it would be better just to expose the index file option. Something like this:\n```js\n{\n  defaultDocument: /index.html\n}\n// In the dev-server.js\napp.use(require('connect-history-api-fallback')({\n  index: config.dev.defaultDocument\n}))\n```\nThis then allows the user to set the value to anything rather than just change the sub-path. Couple this with a good documentation example of how to change the Vue application to a sup-path and you are set.\nAlso, an example which mentions nginx and other proxy solutions would help people searching the internet for it.. Ah, thanks @LinusBorg.\nDocumentation on those to extra references: https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin\nI don't think I need to change those setting in my use case however I'm not sure how you would want to expose them to a template user through configuration.\nMaybe something like the following config options:\n```js\n{\n  htmlDevServerDefaultDocument: 'index.html',\n  htmlTemplate: 'index.html',\n  htmlBuildFile: 'index.html'\n}\n```\nAnother option would be to not add these configuration options and just document how to change them and what they do?\nI think the browser default document should be added though because in its current state there is no configuration for the 'connect-history-api-fallback' constructor.. @iAlexanderMoon Hi. I didn't know about this change. Thanks for chiming in. I'll try it out however the client seems to be working ok as it is. I am using nginx as a front-end so it might be handling it for me.\n[Edit]\nAh! I was just about to look at this and read the change. I am not having issues because of my nginx config which has this section in it:\n```sh\nlocation ~ ^/__webpack_hmr {\n  proxy_pass http://localnode:2001;\n  proxy_redirect off;\n  proxy_buffering off;\n  proxy_http_version 1.1;\n  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n  proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n}\n```\nI got this trick in the past from working with browsersync.\nI just tried your change and it is not working. Took out the section of the ngnix config and added the path string. The browser is requesting /app/__webpack_hmr which means the path change has taken effect. It is getting a 404 though.\n. OK, I got it working @iAlexanderMoon. Requires two changes:\n1) dev-client.js add the path as you have shown above:\n```js\n/ eslint-disable /\nrequire('eventsource-polyfill')\nvar hotClient = require('webpack-hot-middleware/client?path=/app/__webpack_hmr&noInfo=true&reload=true')\nhotClient.subscribe(function (event) {\n  if (event.action === 'reload') {\n    window.location.reload()\n  }\n})\n```\n2) In the dev-server.js add the path option:\n```js\nvar hotMiddleware = require('webpack-hot-middleware')(compiler, {\n  path: '/app/__webpack_hmr',\n  reload: true, // <= I changed this. Do we need it?\n  log: console.log // <= I added this. I prefer more feedback in my console.\n})\n```\nNote: The webpack-hot-middleware options came from here https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware/blob/master/client.js\n. # Change Dev Server Base URL Config Summary\nTo change the base url of the dev-server.js which is used during npm run dev on the template, you need to make the following changes. Note that the changes below assume a child path of /app/.\n\nChange the assetsPublicPath in the config/index.js file like so:\n\n```js\ndev: {\n    env: require('./dev.env'),\n    port: 2001,\n    autoOpenBrowser: true,\n    assetsSubDirectory: 'static',\n    assetsPublicPath: '/app/',\n    proxyTable: {},\n    cssSourceMap: false\n  }\n```\n\nIn the build/dev-server.js file, change the connect-history-api-fallback middleware to support a new index path:\n\n```js\napp.use(require('connect-history-api-fallback')({\n  index: '/app/index.html'\n}))\n```\n\nIn the build/dev-client.js add the path into the option string for the hot module reload client:\n\n```js\n/ eslint-disable /\nrequire('eventsource-polyfill')\nvar hotClient = require('webpack-hot-middleware/client?path=/app/__webpack_hmr&noInfo=true&reload=true')\nhotClient.subscribe(function (event) {\n  if (event.action === 'reload') {\n    window.location.reload()\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIn the build/dev-server.js file add the path option for the webpack-hot-middleware:\n\n```js\nvar hotMiddleware = require('webpack-hot-middleware')(compiler, {\n  path: '/app/__webpack_hmr',\n  reload: true, // <= I changed this. Do we need it?\n  log: console.log // <= I added this. I prefer more feedback in my console.\n})\n```\n\nIf you wish to change the default document from index.html so another name like default.htm then you will need to change the filename/template names in these files and in step 2 above:\n\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.dev.conf.js#L29\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.prod.conf.js#L54\n. @LinusBorg This should be broken up into two problems; default document name and child path.. I could be wrong here however @BafS solution is just proxying. This issue is about child paths.. Doesn't Vuejs use standard already? . Check out vue-foundation . Docs must be out of date. Try the @ instead of tilda. . This is a common problem. I am currently manually updating the vue-foundation template as PRs come in.. @awitherow I've only been working with the template for a few months. So far I have changed the resolve character to @ and a few other minor changes. I am racking up a few issues to do all at once when I am next working on the template.\nCurrent changes needing attention: https://github.com/hal0gen/vue-foundation/issues/10\n. Hey, this sounds great. Is the new dependency going to include #546 ?\n. Checkout vue-foundation as a reference. That template is importing scss files.. Hi @dwikip. I would suggest you break the application up into different projects and use a reverse proxy like nginx to route between them.. Looks like you have a file permissions issue. Check the permissions on the first few js files in the stack trace.. @escawn webpack-dev-server uses express also: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/lib/Server.js\nThe custom dev-server.js file is pretty simple and easy to customize. They both use express.js behind the scenes.\n. Are you using SASS?\nPut this in your app.scss file:\ncss\n// Load font-awesome\n$fa-font-path: '~font-awesome/fonts';\n@import '~font-awesome/scss/font-awesome';\n. ",

Here how I have this working now for both Sass and Stylus:\n```js\n  var sassOptions = {\n    includePaths: ['./src/styles'],\n    data: '@import \"_main.scss\";'\n  }\nvar stylusOptions = {\n    paths: [path.resolve('./src/styles')],\n    import: ['_main.styl']\n  }\n// https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/configurations/extract-css.html\n  return {\n    css: generateLoaders(),\n    postcss: generateLoaders(),\n    less: generateLoaders('less'),\n    sass: generateLoaders('sass',\n        Object.assign({ indentedSyntax: true }, sassOptions)),\n    scss: generateLoaders('sass', sassOptions),\n    stylus: generateLoaders('stylus', stylusOptions),\n    styl: generateLoaders('stylus', stylusOptions)\n  }\n```\n.

Before I do that please bear with me as it might be a simple mistake on my side relating to the project folder structure of its sass files.\nI worked with webpack a little before and then I just required my sass by doing from the main.js:\nimport '../sass/main.scss';\nAnd from the main.scss other scss files where included.\nHowever in this templates' setup it looks like 'everything' in the src folder is bundled which causes some the scss variable issues as I currently have this folder structure. In src folder:\n\nThen in the sass folder:\n\nand finally in the base folder:\n\nSo the order of importing the scss files is then probably messed up and variables can not be resolved. I might try pushing the sass out of src folder and just import them from main.js ?! What is the 'best practice' here?\nThanks!\n. Adjusting the test coverage as you suggested worked.

Is that example too simple to test what you believe may break @chrisvfritz ?\n. @LinusBorg Regardless it fixes the problem. I now am able to run my application over file:// with no issues. Everything builds just fine, I can serve the files just fine.\n. @LinusBorg I think you're losing sight of the problem in favor of the details. In this case @zhangxin840 mentioned the problem explicitly. Changing assetsPublicPath to './' (instead of publicPath) solves the problem and everything seems to work on my end just fine afterwards, which was @chrisvfritz's worry.\nIn any case, how would I go about reproducing the problem you mentioned? Do you mean LiveReload breaks? Because the change is only applied to the build script, not dev.\n. I use vue-router in my project. I have not touched publicPath, only assetPublicPath. As I said, everything builds and works just fine.\n. @LinusBorg I'm using ES6 modules. They compile together just fine.\n. @LinusBorg This is still a bug and should be reopened. In config/index.js changing build.assetsPublicPath to './' and leaving dev.assetsPublicPath fixes serving over file:/// protocol while at the same time allowing the npm run dev webserver to keep working.\nEverything builds correctly in both situations. The files in dist can be used both over file and tested hosting them with python -m http.server and npm's http-server package with no issues found.\nI haven't seen an example using code-splitting to test wether it breaks or not. But not working under Cordova is as much an issue.\n. It's not \"my\" usecase. It's the default config breaking the file:/// protocol. Whenever it started doing that it became a bug. Not to mention that this not only affects Cordova (currently the only way to deploy Vue as a mobile application, at least until Weex starts supporting it) but pretty sure also affects Electron, another huge platform for cross-platform desktop development.\nI'm using vue-router and just tested history mode with nginx. Works perfectly with assetsPublicPath set to './'.\n. I'd say with quite some confidence that the file:/// protocol is a bigger standard than code-splitting and therefore has more merit as a default.\nBut even if the default is not changed, even if there's a consensus among all devs that Electron, Cordova, the Principle Of Least Astonishment and standard local development all together matter less than code-splitting, shouldn't it be acknowledged in some place beside this issue (like the message shown on build you mentioned or an alternative build script that supports the norm of file:/// working) that there's a way to build without breaking the mentioned standard?\n.

    "asselin": "I ran a simple test on the latest template with code splitting and setting assetsPublicPath to './', and everything seems to work fine.  Take a look at https://github.com/asselin/vue-webpack-codesplit-test.\nDoes this resolve the final concern about changing assetsPublicPath to './' as a default?\nSetting assetsPublicPath to './' fixes Cordova, file://, and serving from a higher directory (e.g. building into test/dist and serving test/), so it would be nice to make it the default if it there are no remaining reasons not to.\ncc: @LinusBorg @chrisvfritz @mixedCase  . @LinusBorg Is there anything I can do to help get this change in?. @LinusBorg Submitted PR #541 for this issue.  Also, could you please take a look at PR #530 at the same time?  It fixes a similar type of path issue loading fonts.\nThanks!. @LinusBorg I tested vue-router history mode, and ran into some issues.  If the URL is only 1 level deep (e.g. /index.html or /menu), everything works fine.  If it's 2+ levels deep (e.g. /user/menu), the relative URLs break.\nHaving said that, I'd still like to make a case for changing the default.\n\nI checked 3 sites that use history mode: Facebook, Twitter, and Blogger.  All 3 sites serve their static assets from absolute URLs from a completely different top level path or domain.  For example, all of Twitter's static assets are served from https://abs.twimg.com, and all of Facebook's are served from https://www.facebook.com/rsrc.php/.  My suspicion is that they did that so that the app servers don't have to serve static resources, and instead they're served by dedicated web servers and/or a CDN.  Since this seems to be common (perhaps best) practice, in production, if you're going to use history mode, you'd wind up changing assetsPublicPath anyway, and not using the default.\nI agree with @mixedCase that history mode is used less often than a) serving an app out of a subdirectory (i.e. building to /app/dist and serving /app) b) serving from file:// (especially Cordova)\nThe template's use of vue-router doesn't enable history mode.  I assume this is done because history mode doesn't work unless you configure your webserver correctly.  IMO, since history mode isn't enabled by default in the template, it's inconsistent to default assetsPublicPath to '/' so that history mode works.  My suggestion is to add a chapter to the documentation \"Enabling HTML history mode\" that has step by step what to do to make it work (e.g. 1. Change assetsPublicPath  2. Add \"mode: 'history'\" 3. Configure your server per https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/history-mode.html etc.)\n\nAlternatively, if you're concerned about changing the default and breaking support of history mode, how about a question in the template \"Enable HTML5 history mode?\" that would configure assetsPublicPath to '/' and add mode: 'history' if Yes was selected?. @LinusBorg Thanks for the reply.  I'll take a look at lazy loaded components with assetsPath set to './' and see what's what.\nI agree with you that Cordova isn't a focus for this template; I'm working on a Cordova template that I hope to publish soon.\nThinking about this some more, assuming lazy loaded components work, I think that adding a question at creation time about enabling history mode makes the most sense, that way the generated code is consistent.\nI'll let you know what I find soon.  Thank you!. To be able to use this with cordova, you have to be able to use relative paths, because 1) it uses file://  2) the root is unpredictable.  I agree with @guilhermefelipesilva that this should be fixed.. Looking further, this is a dup of #200 . Relevant to #200 . I think you might be using the webpack-simple template, not the webpack template.  If so, you should open an issue against that repo: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple. @LinusBorg I can give it a test, but I don't think it will break, because the font's URL is relative to the CSS file-- assuming you can load the CSS file, the font's relative URL should be valid.. I tested with vue-router history mode, and it worked fine, no issues. @LinusBorg, would it be possible to merge this one please?. @LinusBorg When I tested history mode with relative paths, I didn't run into any issues, including reloading on a subroute.  Note that for dev, I left the assetsPublicPath as '/', so there was no issue there.\nI haven't tried lazy loaded routes-- do you happen to have a snippet of code or a github repo handy with your test (I'd like to see it in action to see if I can come up with any solutions).  If not, no worries, I'll code something up.\nAssuming it's an issue we can't get around, based on your comment, are you saying that you'd be OK with a PR that adds an additional question (e.g. Do you want to use an absolute or relative base path?) and then configures the template accordingly (webpack config, assetsPublicPath, etc.)?\nThanks!. @LinusBorg Gentle reminder, when you have time, to upload your GH repo.  Thanks!. @LinusBorg Apologies for taking so long to get back on this one (client work!).\nI just sent you a PR to the repo you sent me above.  I think the reason you were seeing an issue with reloads is because you had assetsPublicPath set to './' with history mode turned on.  When I set it to '/', it worked fine.  \nAlso note that this PR only affects the URLs for Fonts, and since fonts are specified in CSS files, their URL is relative to the CSS file, not relative to index.html.\nThanks!. @LinusBorg See https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/200#issuecomment-255557630  I haven't personally tested it, but @mixedCase claims there's no issue running with vue-router in history mode and assetsPublicPath set to './'.. @nickm123 I have a Cordova template for Vue that I put together for a few internal projects for my company here: https://github.com/BlueOakJS/vue-cordova-template\nInterested in collaborating?.

    "cristijora": "Hi everyone. I also think that this can be somehow improved.\nSetting assetsPublicPath: '', allows for local usage, hosting as a static website and as I see in the comments above, cordova apps.\nWhile  assetsPublicPath: '/', covers more use-cases it forces to use some sort of web server to serve your website. \nI think this stuff should be at least very well explained in the docs so it doesn't create confusion\nSide note regarding code splitting: Code splitting works fine when used locally as a static website if the path is set to ''.. Although the blog post is very good I found it easier to:\nHave the server.js file, package.json and the Procfile as described in the post but after that follow these steps:\ncd dist\ngit init\ngit remote add heroku \"https://git.heroku.com/my-app-namegit\"\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"my commit message\"\ngit push heroku master\nThis approach is somehow easier than subtrees and doesn't require deleting dist folder from gitignore. Also it's a bit more flexible if you want to have several remotes (e.g heroku-dev, heroku-staging, heroku-live) and configure some tasks in the package.json which will run the following commands described above.\n. @moshie Actually it doesn't require those dependencies.\nIf you have vue-router in simple hash mode, you can deploy the files only without anything else\nIf you have vue-router in history mode, you might need some additional stuff \nhttps://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/history-mode.html\nFor me, the process of deploying with heroku is something like:\nnpm run build\ncd dist\ngit commit -m \"my commit message\"\ngit push heroku master (assuming heroku remote is defined)\nYou can see my comment from above that it's easier to have the dist folder with it's own git remote\nProcess of deploy with now https://zeit.co/now\nnpm run build\ncd dist\nnow (assuming you have installed now globally).

I'm using an old version of the template that has this issue and it seemed really peculiar, because I noticed CSS within an SFC style tag gets prefixed, but postcss-loader is not to be found in the template's dependencies. Further investigating revealed that css-loader includes postcss in its dependencies and probably auto invokes it if browserslist is present in your package.json, thus auto-prefixing the CSS as expected. All, but SCSS files imported in a script tag (and perhaps other, similar import variations). From this closed issue, I can only deduce postcss-loader has to be explicit for a complete, multi import-scenario solution.. I'm afraid not. When you come to think of it though, if you make an SPA, you should rarely arrive at a point where you need to import CSS (if that's the case), not to mention going as far as glob-import it. I only needed it to import some of my legacy SASS code, which will be re-factored into something like styled-components eventually. Never meant to use it permanently. Of course, if you plan to use it for something other than CSS, then I guess it could be viable somehow. Despite that, I have more experience with the Vue-Webpack template now so I'll retry to make it work, perhaps this weekend.. For the time being, just import it the boring way.

I'll try that.. @robwierzbowski You are right. It is there, I saw it there and documentation is rather clear about it, but it doesn't seem to affect third-party components. The template as is, doesn't prefix it. It's possible my vue-loader configuration is outdated, but odds are low.. Should I add a condition for testing environment?. I set the variable as suggested by @chrisvfritz.. For re-pro init a Vue project with Webpack, then setup a listener and throw an error right after it:\n```js\nwindow.onerror = function (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, error) {\n  console.log(error) // \"Script error\" instead of an error object\n}\nthrow new Error('oh no')\n```\nIt should be intercepted by the listener, which it does, but you don't get the full error (which reflects the stack-trace as seen on the console), because Chrome thinks the script that threw the error is in another domain. I think this is related to source maps and how devTools manages them. It seems however, it can be fixed by some extra Webpack configuration. I'm just not down to what exactly..

(I created a new issue #895). can we provide a option like something: \"simple mode\" vs \"advanced mode\":\n\nsimple mode -- gives users the less option and most ofen used configure.\nadvanced mode -- gives users more flexibility.\n. Hmm.. I just saw the webpack-simple, and it is really simple -- I guess it is mostly for learning :(\ncan we add an option webpack-advanced, which gives more options to support meta-language and more? (I'm not sure about this, actually I can see both sides.)\n\n```bash\nSee a list of available official templates\nvue list\n * webpack\n * webpack-simple\n * webpack-advanced\n...\n``. ready to go?. ping @LinusBorg .

I'm not sure there is a necessary to use github? it has no version control..I think.. an => a. :(. is there any reason to use var, not const?. why using var? it's in strict mode, using const is fine, and recommended! @LinusBorg .

I originally had import Vue from \"../../../node_modules/vue\"; and changed it to import Vue from \"vue/dist/vue.js\";.. I figured out the source of my confusion -- my project does only have single-file VueJS components, but I am using rails-vue-loader, which after a look at https://github.com/kikyous/rails-vue-loader/blob/master/lib/sprockets/vue/script.rb seems to be just dumping the template in as a string (to my surprise). We are trying to move to webpack, but are \"halfway\" through, and I guess the vue.js version dropped in by webpack was being used even for the old sprockets Vue instances.\nP.S. I had of course already read that link in detail!. We've now completely removed rails-vue-loader and are just using webpack, but this error persists when using import Vue from \"vue\". When I break at the warning and look through the stack-trace, it's happening at:\nimport SidepanelAd from \"src/components/sidepanel_ad\"\nvar v = new Vue({ el: \"#sidepanelAd\", components: {'sidepanel-ad': SidepanelAd} });\n<div id='sidepanelAd'>\n  <sidepanel-ad ref='sidepanel-ad'/>\n</div>\nwhich isn't using string templates (it's defined in a sidepanel_ad.vue file).

    "youfoundKim": "@Meekohi \nI can understand. At first glance, it does not make much sense. However, if you take your time and read the link Evan You posted, it should make much more sense.\nEssentially, Vue.js ships with two builds:\n- Runtime only build\n- Runtime + compiler build.\nThe compiler takes care of converting template strings to render functions. If you're getting this error, it means that you're trying to use the runtime only build while having one or more string templates in your project. \nIf you don't have a compilation step (such as webpack w/ vue-loader) and wish to use string templates, just import Vue from 'vue/dist/vue.js' like you're already doing. There's nothing wrong with that.\nHowever, if you do have a compilation step, you might benefit from converting all your string templates to render functions to remove the compiler overhead while using your Vue.js app. This can be done with webpack + vue-loader + only using Single File Components. You will still be able to use templates, they'll just be converted in the compilation step.\nIf you're unsure on how to render the root Vue.js instance without a string template, this might give you an idea: \n```javascript\n// index.js\nimport Vue from 'vue';\nimport App from './App.vue';\nconst app = new Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  render: function (h) {\n    return h(App);\n  }\n});\n```\n```javascript\n// App.vue\n\n\nDoes this work?\n{{text}}\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      text: 'Yes it does!'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n```html\nindex.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```.

    "DevanB": "Is there any documentation of the process to add the polyfill @yyx990803? I've checked the Webpack template docs, but didn't find anything. My webpack skills aren't strong.. Forgive me, as I'm new to dealing with this scenario. In es6-promise's documentation here, it looks as though I can simply add this: require('es6-promise').polyfill(); to a file. Would it be ideal to add that code in my main.js where Vue is being instantiated, or should something like this go in webpack.prod.conf.js file?\nThanks for the help @yyx990803. I know you are super busy!. Found one half of my problem. I was using the Prerender SPA plugin, which seems to be having the same problems: https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin/issues/16.\nAfter pulling that out and trying both babel-polyfill (and it's instructions) and es6-promise (and it's instructions), I was not able to get the promise polyfill to work on IE10 and below. I hope this makes it on the radar as an issue to at least research into. I will be glad to appropriately document the problem and steps I've taken to resolve it some where, if this isn't the correct place for the discussion.\nThanks @yyx990803 for the help!. The only way I could get this error to stop was by including this in the head of the index.html:\n<!-- Script for polyfilling Promises on IE9 and 10 -->\n<script src='https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js'></script>\nHope there is a better solution, as I'm not pleased with this.. @LinusBorg Yep, I added es6-promise to the top of main.js (like below), but still get the vuex error.\nI tried putting the babel-polyfill in webpack.base.conf.js like below, but that didn't work either.\n```\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill()\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport App from './App'\nimport router from './router'\nimport store from './store'\nimport { sync } from 'vuex-router-sync'\nimport VueHead from 'vue-head'\nsync(store, router)\nVue.use(VueHead)\n/ eslint-disable no-new /\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  router,\n  store,\n  render: h => h(App)\n})\n```\nentry: {\n  app: [\n    'babel-polyfill',\n    './src/main.js'\n  ]\n},. First, thanks for the help @LinusBorg!\nI didn't know that. So import statements have the same \"hoisting\" like variables and would \"out-rank\" a require() statement?\nI changed the require to a ES6 import statement (below), but no luck. So then I replaced the import statements with require statements (like below), and I received a vuex error (I assume having to do because of the require statement solution): \nTypeError: store.registerModule is not a function. (In 'store.registerModule', 'store.registerModule' is undefined)\n```\nimport { polyfill } from 'es6-promise'\npolyfill()\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport App from './App'\nimport router from './router'\nimport store from './store'\nimport { sync } from 'vuex-router-sync'\nimport VueHead from 'vue-head'\nsync(store, router)\nVue.use(VueHead)\n/ eslint-disable no-new /\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  router,\n  store,\n  render: h => h(App)\n})\n```\n```\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill()\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport App from './App'\nimport router from './router'\nvar store = require('./store')\nimport { sync } from 'vuex-router-sync'\nimport VueHead from 'vue-head'\nsync(store, router)\nVue.use(VueHead)\n/ eslint-disable no-new /\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  router,\n  store,\n  render: h => h(App)\n})\n```. @limichange that worked!\nAgain, thanks @LinusBorg for the help also (and the new knowledge!)\nI'll be glad to put in a PR for some documentation on the process, if wanted. This was the final solution:\n```\nimport 'es6-promise/auto'\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport App from './App'\nimport router from './router'\nimport store from './store'\nimport { sync } from 'vuex-router-sync'\nimport VueHead from 'vue-head'\nsync(store, router)\nVue.use(VueHead)\n/ eslint-disable no-new /\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  router,\n  store,\n  render: h => h(App)\n})\n```.

    "gkatsanos": "@pksunkara would you mind having a look at my repo/branch? I am trying to integrate your proposed changes to this template (so, having vue-router) : https://github.com/gkatsanos/gplus/tree/redesign. @pksunkara thank you. I am mostly trying to make it work on my own and understand a bit how it functions.. (I was expecting the integration to be smoother). @chrisvfritz would you mind adding some example or documention on how to include a vue related package and import it with the vuejs-templates?\n. Hold on, I know how to add a package with npm and import it with Babel, but I thought it could be vue-cli's responsibility to help you with bootstrapping the project to have an option to include vue-router or vue-resource (together with the necessary configuration..?)\n. Thanks a lot for this link! I have a question regarding http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/proxy.html - should I make an issue here or in http-proxy-middleware ? \n. Uhm, hold on, I guess my question should be at least towards vue-cli which\nis bootstrapping a Vue.js project and should normally give the possibility\nto choose whether you want a router or a resource?\n. I don't understand what's the point of the \"keeping it simple\" - having a generator which doesn't have a routing system is a bit pointless right? It could be an optional thing, like tests are. . I guess as long as there's a webpack-advanced template, 90% of use cases would be covered :) \nPersonally I don't mind doing things manually at this phase as it's a means for learning. But when you're past the 2nd or 3rd project, automation is basics can accelerate/facilitate the work a lot.\nMy Criticism was maybe a bit sharp, but it was definitely both constructive and polite, unlike some other comments I read which were definitely not constructive. . It would be very nice, I m just starting with vue-router and there's nothing useful in the vue-router documention regarding our webpack setup.\n. Thank you @LinusBorg . I should have closed this earlier - I figured I'd try that and indeed it worked. There's no \"node.js\" / \"express.js\" part used in my application so everything should be static :) . 2 years later, still don't get it. I deploy to heroku, and I set this:\n\"postinstall\": \"yarn build:production\",\n    \"build:production\": \"node build/build.js\",\nin my package.json .\nHeroku properly creates a /dist/ folder with the compiled files . \nSo far so good.\nWould be cool to be able to access this /dist/ from my Heroku domain though :( \nI believe vue-cli deserves a docu that explains the limits of deploying to services like Azure and Heroku. . lets please try to merge this! . what's missing from https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/ to consider it non-beta?. It just feels this was written for a very particular case and it's not extendable - I don't see the added value of complicating the webpack configuration EVEN MORE than it already is. \n. Thanks :) I forgot to close the issue!. Thank you, unfortunately the complexity of the project is such that I am afraid it will not be possible. I was hoping someone has already witnessed this and there's already a solution. \nPS: we might have been able to solve it by upgrading to Webpack 4. . Filed a bug to https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7199, although I suspect it has to do with something vue specific. . Have you checked that SourceMaps work? (because I think there are issues with mini-css-extract-plugin and sourceMaps) . Since this is not related to the pull request what's stopping us from merging it? . if you don't provide an explicit chunkFileName here you'll get errors when you split several chunks for lazy loading. (something like trying to emmit to the same file). Try having 2 or 3 lazy loaded components using vue-router when each one's using a separate CSS file. . ",

Is this working when running npm run dev? I believe your error is on your router.beforeEach  function\nI think your choice of naming of variables may have confused you. You define the variables as\nrouter.beforeEach((route, redirect, next) => {\nwhereas the documentation define them as:\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\nYou are trying to change the path using redirect but should instead do with with next as per the documentation\nFor example: \nredirect({  path: '/auth/login' }) should be changed to next({  path: '/auth/login' })\nI think that will take care of the first exception, as t is probably the renamed redirect variable.  \nThe last error I am not so sure about, but try commenting out all code in router.beforeEach, except next() and see if that helps.  I would also advice you to try running as development, as it can give some additional clues that build does not give. Then I guess it might have been caused by different dependencies on the Droplet compared to your local machine. As long as it works now I guess :) . Why add this? The documentation for vue-hot-reload states that it is not needed for normal application usage where you use vue-loader is used source\n. You are referencing two icon's with different casing doubanIcon.png and doubanicon.png\nMost filesystems on Linux and Mac are case sensitive so this would two different files. On Windows the filesystem is not case sensitive so this could only be 1 file.\nTo fix it be consistent in the your casing when defining the paths to a filename. . So far as I understand this happens if dependencies are missing or other fatal errors. However the errors are still outputted to the terminal so you should find the errors there. As is documented in the Vue docs  you use the assets the following way (btw they are not under src/assets/ but under assets/) \nAsset Resolving Rules\n\nRelative\nURLs, e.g. ./assets/logo.png will be interpreted as a module dependency. They will be replaced with an auto-generated URL based on your Webpack output configuration.\n\n\nNon-prefixed\nURLs, e.g. assets/logo.png will be treated the same as the relative URLs and translated into ./assets/logo.png.\n\n\nURLs\nprefixed with ~ are treated as a module request, similar to require('some-module/image.png'). You need to use this prefix if you want to leverage Webpack's module resolving configurations. For example if you have a resolve alias for assets, you need to use <img src=\"~assets/logo.png\"> to ensure that alias is respected.\n\n\nRoot-relative URLs\ne.g. /assets/logo.png are not processed at all.. There is already both open issues and pull requests for Webpack 3 support: #751 , #891 . What about solving the original problem first? \n\n\n\nTry setting it up as a routing proxy: https://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/proxy.html\nThat way you don't have to worry about CORS and get get it setup rather easily, and get hot reload the like to work as well. My 2-cents on this: \nhard-source-webpack-plugin seems very promising, but looking at https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/250#issuecomment-347811223 and the comments on it, it appears that it relies heavily on webpack internals which means that even a semver-minor change could result in breaking hard-source-webpack-plugin\nI woud therefore caution about adding it to this template and instead suggest that it might be added to a readme / added as commented out code. . Take a look at for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42936588/how-to-deploy-vue-app\nYour question is not specific to this template, this is very general to how webpack works, so I would suggest you read up on webpack dev/production builds. \nBasically when developing you use npm run dev\nWhen you want to create a production build you run npm run build and that creates standard html, css and javascript that can be run through any HTTP file server. So to answer your question, yes any nginx and apache server can be used. However your development and build machine needs node to create a production build. \nNote if you use Vue router with HTML5 history mode enabled it requires a little more, see Vue router documentation\nThis would probably be better suited as a forum post on https://forum.vuejs.org/ or on stackoverflow as this issue tracker is meant to be focused on bugs or new features for the webpack template, and not support questions. . I don't think this issue tracker is meant to be used as a support option. But itsn't it because of minChunks: 3 in CommonsChunkPlugin. It essentially will only placed it in a seperate chunk if 3 chunks uses it. If only 2 it will not do that. If you setr minChunks to 2 that would probably do it for you. But that could have other consequences. . ",

    "kiwina": "just tried a blank out of the box project and run: npm run dev \nthere is a problem with .vue files\n. ",
    "woozyking": "I encounter the same issue from time to time as well, where the manifest gets transferred, but app or other component (by vue-router) js files get \"stuck\", and leads to a forever blank screen.\nNot sure exactly why though. @LinusBorg it doesn't work. Even if it does, I would still feel that a server-to-server based API tunneling is the most reliable choice (and equivalently trivial). Let's say the backend API server does not have explicit CORS header configured, and by default prevents any form of cross-origin client side request, rightly so. So the problem is that we would get complaint (and an error in browser) that says the request hit localhost:PORT but the response actually comes from actual_backend_API_server.com, with no explicit allowance through the CORS headers, no go.\nThat's why I'm proposing to have the default dev-server.js implementation to instead of using the proxy middleware, having a simple middleware to perform a \"server-to-server\" request from dev-server to the designated backend API server(s), retrieve the data stream, and pipe to the response that dev-server sends to the client side (in usual case, a browser). No more CORS configuration and meddling on any layer of the stack, because so long you have access (through authentication, VPN, or whatever other means of protection), a server-to-server HTTP request is never governed by the CORS headers.\nAnd such simple middleware can be done through request library which nicely supports stream piping. But one can easily use axios, or even the raw HTTP module from node.js.. Here's a simple example I used to replace the default one\nnode.js\n// one can easily make this work with the `proxyTable` object to handle multiple configs\napp.all('/api/*', (req, res, next) => {\n  return req.pipe(request({\n    uri: req.path.replace(/^\\/api/, ''),\n    baseUrl: 'http://my.api.server.com',\n    qs: req.query,\n    method: req.method\n  })).on('error', next).pipe(res).on('error', next)\n})\n// this is used to capture the stream errors\napp.use((err, req, res, next) => {\n  console.error(err.stack)\n  res.sendStatus(500)\n}). Thanks for the pointer on the onProxyReq option @asvae. Unfortunately, I would still get browser complaining about CORS:\nXMLHttpRequest cannot load http://SOME_REMOTE_HOST/path/to/api. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8080' is therefore not allowed access.\nIt's such a puzzle to me right now \ud83d\ude1e . @asvae yes I certainly requested the intended proxy path as such on client side\naxios.get(`/api/campaigns?id=${...}...`).then(...). @asvae I didn't even set it, literally just axios.get('/api/...'). This is what I'm confused about too @asvae as I simply just request on http://localhost:8080/path/to/api it would \"redirect\" to the matching http://SOME_REMOTE_HOST/path/to/api specified in proxyTable.\nAnyway the values are as the following:\n\u23a2 Original URL: /api/endpoint?query=value\n\u23a2 Host Name: localhost\n\u23a2 Origin: undefined\nIt looks like the origin header is not set. @asvae thank you for all the help. I'll dive deeper later on this and report back any new findings.. Thanks @stcqu, I'll experiment with your suggestions and see if that would make things simpler.\nAt the end of the day this is a very minor part of the end product that one may ship. Right now we went as far as building the API proxy as part of the production server because the complexity kind of warrants this structure (especially that in our use case we handle sessions). We then factored the common logics out and have it imported by both the dev-server and production server as a shared middleware.\nI think it comes down to how much logic is utilized and shared between dev server and production server environment (when applicable), as some, or many Vue projects are developed without a production server side.\nI personally think that this issue could be closed as it only troubles a portion of the broader use cases that's not even vuejs-templates/webpack project's main concern (and frankly, shouldn't be)..

Absolute path tries to construct the URL from domain root, which is 404.\n```\nhttp://asdf.com/vue-app/index.html\n/static/js/manifest.[hash].js -> http://asdf.com/static/js/manifest.[hash].js\n./static/js/manifest.[hash].js -> http://asdf.com/vue-app/static/js/manifest.[hash].js\n```\nI remember once discussed with Evan about it, very long ago. But the conversation was not on GitHub, so I forgot to submit a pull request, should have.. @LinusBorg Not the best solution, in my opinion.\nFor example, I'm developing an open source app. If anyone forks the repo and makes their own change, that's fine.\nHowever, for people who are not familiar with code, or don't want to customize, they could also grab the dist package. In the latter case, I cannot be sure how they serve their deployment. So './' is my choice.\nBut after rethinking, I agree it's quite opinion-based.. It does. The app I mentioned uses vue-router. I also enabled code-splitting (but turned off in a later version) and works fine.. @callumacrae \nThe truth is that dependencies and devDependencies are not so clearly different in NPM. I mean, yes, they are different concepts, and behave differently in a way.\nIn the past we use bower, today everybody laughs at bower. Where's the successor? I don't find one. NPM is trying to take over, but honestly not enough, e.g. your case.\nOn the other hand, I'm also wondering one thing. Is npm install --production && npm run build the right way, even though lots of people do? In my opinion, production ready means the distributable is included for up and running. If you have to build from source code, that means the project is not production ready yet. Then why npm install --production? Or, since Heroku sets NODE_ENV to \"production\" which means it's meant to be a deployment server, why use it like a build server? Or we could argue is Heroku doing the right thing.... Yep. I removed that line too, and added rm('-rf', config.build.assetsRoot) right after spinner.start().. Oops, my bad. It was a batch find-replace, updated to keep only necessary quotes.. Did you noticed that NODE_ENV: '\"development\"' is already stringified?. Then you should probably use single quotes, since in the template eslint is using the standard style by default.. I got an approach, but not sure whether it meets your need.\nYou can remove chunkhash from build/webpack.prod.conf.js. So the bundled files will have fixed names (without the hash, e.g. manifest.js).\n\nThen you could turn off injection in HTMLWebpackPlugin options. This way, bundled files will not be automatically inserted into index.html.\nAfter that, modify index.html at project root, add these files like you wanted to.\nhtml\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\"></div>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" data-src=\"./static/js/manifest.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" data-src=\"./static/js/vendor.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" data-src=\"./static/js/app.js\"></script>\n  </body>. @LinusBorg Yep, that's what I meant by \"not sure\". \ud83d\ude03 . Initially the folder is empty (except a .gitkeep). So that's correct - * matches nothing. Once you put something in it, images or whatever, the error may go away.. Looks like the driver for firefox is built-in?. @MaxMilton \nAs you could read from above discussions, Linus and I also share your concerns. That's why I think it needs to be discussed. I'm thinking of maybe an opt-in feature could balance both sides? Like test and lint functionalities the template provides.. After over 9 months I'd rather close the thread. There's a better solution for me right now.\nDllPlugin could avoid unnecessary builds of dependencies, if they don't change at all. But, whenever we update, add, or remove one or more packages in production dependencies, the vendor bundle has to be rebuilt. The whole vendor bundle has to be loaded again on client side because you need to update the cache, even if you just changed a 1KB lib!\nTo make best use of the cache, now I load most of my production dependencies from CDN. That means I don't even have a vendor bundle now. All I need to deploy is my business bundle. When production dependencies update, only the updated packages need to be cached again, others are good as usual. Furthermore, the update could be bypassed too if the packages have already been cached by other sites.\nI've talked with several colleagues and they do have similar thoughts. When I tried to implement the idea, I found tools like webpack-cdn-plugin. Very handy for my use case.. I personally use #source-map. It's only slow at the initial build.\neval-source-map is fast (honestly I didn't feel it) but I found it cannot debug JS in *.vue via Chrome DevTools.. @mdartic \nWell, I don't think it's a good idea. The interactive wizard should focus the high level decisions. Let the detailed configurations stay in the files for manual adjustment. Otherwise the wizard will inevitably turn into a pain.. You can modify the webpack config build/webpack.prod.conf.js:\njs\n  output: {\n    path: config.build.assetsRoot,\n    filename: utils.assetsPath('js/[name].[chunkhash].js'),\n    chunkFilename: utils.assetsPath('js/[id].[chunkhash].js')\n  },\nAs you can see, the bundled file name is constructed with entry name or chunk id, plus the chunkhash. The hash varies if something has changed, so the bundled file name changes too.\nTo get a fixed file name, just remove chunkhash in the config.. You could import babel-polyfill in your main.js. Looks like due to UglifyJS cannot deal with ES6 modules?\nThe project is currently migrating to use webpack 2.x, let's see what happens when they finish the migration.. @kazupon The CI server doesn't even have a GUI, is Chrome headless available there?. Great! Will definitely give it a try.. A well-crafted component, as I understand, should be capsulated. Which mean it won't/shouldn't be manipulated from the outside, unless through exposed hooks. In such case, the order won't/shouldn't matter. If cascading and order does matter in your case, then maybe you are not doing thing the \"component\" way, IMHO.. Well, I retract what I've said before. Because I do encounter this issue recently \ud83d\ude1e.. You're right, './' works for the case.\nA long time ago (before Vue 2.x or so) I had a short chat with Evan about this. But I can't remember why I didn't make a PR. Maybe you could do it.. If you are using an npm package written in ES6, it fails because:\n\nBabel skips JS files under \"node_modules\" folder.\nUglifyJS cannot handle ES6.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\nYou can force babel to not skip \"node_modules\", so it could be transpiled to ES5.\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L51\njs\n  {\n    test: /\\.js$/,\n    loader: 'babel-loader',\n    include: [\n      resolve('src'),\n      resolve('test'),\n      resolve('node_modules') // or a more specific path to the package\n    ]\n  },\n\n\nMaybe you are importing the source code of the package, which is in ES6. You could checkout its docs or readme, to see if the package provides an ES5 bundle.. I use webpack-cdn-plugin in my project to exclude libs from the bundle.. I think the error message is clear enough. package is a reserved keyword, in other words, DO NOT define a variable with such name.. FYI https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Future_reserved_keywords. What do you mean by \"don't get any error in dev machine\"? You said you got this error when running npm run dev.\n\n\nWebpack build automatically inserts 'use strict', which means run code in strict mode.. What is skinName?. Oh I recalled that, you should use @import '~@skin/xxx/xxx.scss'. The trick is ~.\nIn original CSS, you could use URLs like here/there.css or ./here/there.css, both are relative paths. But in context of Node, these have different meanings. A ~ sign hereby explicitly declares \"this is not CSS relative path, resolve it as an alias\".\nThe same when you use background: url(~@alias/...) or <img src=\"~@alias/...\">.\nhttps://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader#url. Maybe you should put them in \"/static\" folder. Files under \"/src/assets\" will be handled with webpack.. ",
    "nickmessing": "@pksunkara, It would be awesome if contributors create a repo like webpack-advanced or webpack-complete so we can do vuex/vue-router in there with like lots of options, maybe we should try to convince them it's needed?\n. @pksunkara, hmm, nice, are contributions welcome?\n. @ScratchOs, I've seen at least 2 PRs for Vuex, looks like maintainers of this template don't want to include it. Actually they didn't want to include vue-router for long time too so maybe you have a chance.. @BillyPurvis, the webpack tempalte is kept as simple as possible, things like foundation are not general needs. Even vuex which is a part of vue ecosystem is not included so if you want to have a template with foundation you should keep it in a separate repository.. @thangman22, every once in a while somebody wants to add vuex support, just like me few months ago, webpack template is kept as simple as possible so, unfortunately, vuex is not going to be added.. @myst729, headless means \"without GUI\". @frandiox, same for Mac OS, not for windows yet. @van-nguyen, :+1:, LGTM, but me and @Aladdin-ADD are not members of maintainers so we should ask someone with write access.\nP.S. Maintainers should decide if they want this to be a part of official webpack template too. I think @LinusBorg or @posva could help with that. IMO this is a great improvement and should get merged.. I totally agree with @van-nguyen, that was why CDNs were popular in the first place. If this feature is enabled by default - potentially in long term most websites powered by Vue are going to share same cache making both gzip and file sizes irrelevant.. @Aladdin-ADD, I wanted for long time to maintain a more advanced setup (jsx, prettier, vuex...) but I didn't have motivation, we can start it together if you want.\nP.S. @LinusBorg, is there any chance to make it under vuejs-templates organisation?. @Aladdin-ADD, it's too irresponsible to give write access to some random people from internet. Maintaining community template (not afiliated with vuejs-templates) for vue-cli is not a big deal, there was some idea that I had a while ago which Evan liked but I still didn't have enough time to work on it. Can you message me on gitter so maybe together we can do that?. @Aladdin-ADD, @MaxMilton, I think having a separate option would be better than combining it with eslint since the whole vue ecosystem is non-opinionated and highly configurable, even tho I think nobody will use just one of them.. I think, just like @MaxMilton said, there should be .htmlhintrc and it would be nice to add htmllint src/**/*.vue to scripts in package.json I think.. IMO it's better to add #!/bin/sh to test.sh, chmod +x it and then add ./test.sh as a script because it's sh compatible and there is no need for bash per se.. Just as option, maybe it's worth considering replacing sh with shelljs just like vue?. @Aladdin-ADD, that is fixed by using shelljs which is cross-platform. @LinusBorg, yes, I use only linux based operating systems but this solution will not work on windows. As long as nobody who works on this template uses windows it's fine but if there is requirement to support windows I'd highly recommend rewriting test.sh in .js with shelljs.\nSo it's your call, do you want to support windows or unix is okay? :wink: . LGTM, you can ask some maintainers like @LinusBorg or @posva for review.. @Ffloriel, no, you're in @LinusBorg's hands atm :smirk: . @wuaiwuai, why not keeping them in static folder in the first place?. If you put it in static/posts/text.md it should be accessible on http://localhost:3000/posts/text.md, you can see that here.. Sorry, I was wrong, it should be http://localhost:8080/static/posts/text.md by default, you can find more information in docs.. @zhuxiao2004, it always gets latest template from github. @zhuxiao2004, yes. @MaxMilton, I use that as git commit hook since it fails if there are \"unfixable\" rules failing. I think it's worth a shot to add it as precommit hook but I don't know if we want to make it a part of webpack template. This should be bare minimal webpack template.. @gw0, we have airbnb option that has trailing commas and standard which doesn't, changing this would result in failing eslint on \"standard-formatted\" code. I don't like trailing commas tbh, and forcing them for all developers is not a good idea IMO, if you like them, you can always add that rule after you generate the project or use airbnb that already does that.. @Igogrek, I think we should wait for vuejs/vue#5887 before even considering adding typescript to webpack template, and even then I don't think this will be a valid option since we try to keep this template minimal and even vuex is not here.. @Igogrek, I think with all of discussion around TypeScript we can make a dedicated typescript template, @posva, do you think that's a valid option after vuejs/vue#5887 gets merged?\nP.S. I really think  vuejs/vue#5887 will be a big change for typescript support since it will make it possible to not use vue-class-component. I'm waiting for it for a long time.. @afontcu, you can do that but I'd recommend usign babel-plugin-module-resolver with Jest instead.. @afontcu, for src/ you need to set up resolve.modules in webpack config. @afontcu, with this config you can import MyComponent from 'components/MyComponent.vue'. Don't you need a comma at the end here?. Won't this end up being an empty line when cdn is false and two empty lines when cdn is true?. Looks like @van-nguyen is right, that's used in other files like package.json. I think this should be wrapped in {{#lint}}...{{/lint}} just like eslint-loader or have another key in meta.js something like htmlLint. Same as above comment. This should not be a part of project's .gitignore because it has nothing to do with actual project. If vscode is your main code editor you should add it to your global .gitignore instead.. :+1: but can you add \\n back please? :smile: . Check this file again, looks like you missed a closing bracket here after options, now it is:\njs\n      {\n        test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif|svg)(\\?.*)?$/,\n        loader: 'url-loader',\n        options: {\n          limit: 10000,\n          name: utils.assetsPath('img/[name].[hash:7].[ext]')\n        },\n      }, // <-- Missed this\n      {\n        test: /\\.(mp4|webm|ogg|mp3|wav|flac|aac)(\\?.*)?$/,\n        loader: 'url-loader',\n        options: {\n          limit: 10000,\n          name: utils.assetsPath('media/[name].[hash:7].[ext]')\n        }\n      },.

When deploying code written from this template, unless you have a separate build server, you want the dependencies requires to build the code, and usually not the dependencies required to test the code. It's not exactly an uncommon use case\u2014how are you guys deploying your code?\nRight now, this template fails to install when deploying to, for example, heroku, because NODE_ENV is set to \"production\" so only vue is installed\u2014not very useful.\nIs this template for applications or for libraries? Because the system you're using only works for libraries.\n. That's generally not the approach I would take, because then you can't have environmental variables. This template doesn't have them, but it's something I've added to every Vue site I've written: it's super useful for, for example, using one API endpoint on a staging server and another on the production server.\nMy workflow is generally:\n- Run build and tests locally after writing code\n- Commit code and push to github in a PR\n- CI runs the build, and then runs the tests - don't merge if failing. Because the build is also being ran, this tests with updated dependencies, which is good\n- Once merged into master, run tests again before deploying\n- If tests pass, deploy code to staging\n- Build runs on staging\n- Once a week, deploy code to production, build running there\nRunning the build locally, while entirely valid, would restrict what I can change between the four environments I'm deploying to. The config/*.env.js files fall apart when you have more than dev/prod.

The only change we made was to opt for using Ava for unit testing along with istanbul/nyc as the reporter/coverage tool. Our tests pass, the .vue files show up in the nyc report result but the line numbers are off. By that I mean that nyc is pointing to lines 700, 706, etc. as uncovered but the .vue component being tested only has 400 lines in it. I've been hearing about making sure I have sourceMap: true in my nyc package.json config but I tried setting that and a few other things. Nothing seems to work. \nSo my overall question is:\nWhy is nyc pointing to line numbers that don't exist when I'm testing a .vue component file with ES6 code (and not transpiled files)? If nyc is somehow looking at some transpiled version of my .vue file, how do I map it back (with the correct line numbers) to my .vue component file?. @blake-newman, thanks for the response. yeah a couple of people suggested your recipe.

No clue what I'm doing wrong. I've tried a variety of combinations but to no avail. Any help would be appreciated. \nThank you.. @blake-newman , I really appreciate the help. Still no luck with your suggestion above, but if it helps at all, here is the default Vue-Cli webpack boilerplate .babelrc file code:\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"env\", { \"modules\": false }],\n    \"stage-2\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-runtime\"],\n  \"comments\": false,\n  \"env\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"presets\": [\"env\", \"stage-2\"],\n      \"plugins\": [ \"istanbul\" ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nSo that's the last piece. I'm assuming \"babel\":\"inherit\" in the ava package.json config inherits from .babelrc file.\n. @blake-newman, I think I finally got it to work! Although I'm not sure why. The only thing I can definitely put my finger on is that if I put \"babel\":\"inherit\" in my ava package.json configuration, I get the error. What I ended up doing is leaving my .babelrc file as is, and defining a babel config in my package.json file. The working config looks like this:\n\"ava\": {\n    \"require\": [\n      \"ignore-styles\",\n      \"babel-core/register\",\n      \"./tests/unit/helpers/setup.js\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"babel\": {\n    \"presets\": [\n        [\"env\", { \"modules\": false }],\n        \"stage-2\"\n    ],\n    \"plugins\": [\"transform-runtime\"],\n    \"comments\": false,\n    \"ignore\": \"**/*.test.js\",\n    \"env\": {\n        \"development\": {\n            \"presets\": [\"env\", \"stage-2\"],\n            \"sourceMaps\": \"inline\"\n        }\n    }\n  },\nI have to look into all the stuff for babel config but I got some of the config above from the official Ava code-coverage recipe. That being said, I still have to define it in package.json and not in .babelrc\nNow however, nyc returns actual line numbers that map to my .vue file. If you feel there is anything to add, that I might not be considering, please let me know. Again, thanks for your efforts and the helpful information.\n. ",

    "MaxMilton": "Please don't add these types of advanced/complex features to the template. I was recently working on a project which used angular2-webpack-starter and the number 1 feedback I would hear is the build process is too complex. The junior devs struggled enough with webpack in general let alone all the extra complexity with the DLLPlugin.\nOne of the things that attracts me to Vue and the vue+webpack template in particular is its relative simplicity.\nI definitely see the benefits of DLLPlugin/DllReferencePlugin on projects with a large number of dependencies but as it stands this template doesn't have that many dependencies that it significantly slows down rebuilds. An option might be forking this idea into a separate template :). ~I'd prefer to see this as an option during template install rather than the default.~\nUPDATE: I just realised this only runs when you pass the --report argument. Seams pretty reasonable + it's something that should be done on all projects so on second though it's actually quite handy :+1: . Seams to work as expected in my project setups :). I get better results using clean-css vs cssnano (which this plugin uses). So I would prefer if we used clean-css-loader or left it up to the user to do their own advanced optimisations.. +1 \nI've been using babel-preset-env in all my babel projects, the customisability is great!. @airyland that line is already removed in master.. Sorry, you're right! I was looking at the wrong repo \ud83d\ude13. This template doesn't support webpack 3 yet. Double check you're not updating webpack; keep it at version 2.x.x if you need HMR.\nYou can track Webpack 3 status on https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/751. See https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/pull/743. It's look much better now! One last thing I think is necessary is the ability to disable this functionality when not required (I use the template for non SPA apps too which wouldn't be compatible with this setup).\nCould you wrap the webpack.prod.conf.js logic in an if and provide a flag in config/index.js to enable/disable this? It would be exactly the same as CompressionWebpackPlugin.. Just had a go at running this locally and everything works as expected.\nI did have an issue where it removed some used CSS and my webpage didn't look correct. Since developers might be confused when necessary CSS is lost, should this be opt-in/disabled by default (like the productionGzip option)?\nAnyone have thoughts on this?. I like this but I feel it should be optional because on some projects it can flood your terminal with excessive information.. @Aladdin-ADD  that sounds like a decent way to do things. :+1: \nWe could possibly add the value in config/index.js with a comment, that way we're keeping all the configurable options together too.. I played with it a little bit and had problems with webpack-hot-middleware not doing hot updates correctly but rather reloading the whole page. Other than that things worked as expected, however, I didn't do any in-depth testing.. I've opened an issue with inject-loader: https://github.com/plasticine/inject-loader/issues/46\nI believe this is the last package now which needs updating before we can work on our own webpack 3 compatibility.. Update: inject-loader 3.0.1 is now published with webpack 3 compatibility.. @adam-lynch you might have issues with webpack-dev-middleware: ^1.12.0, in my projects I'm keeping it at version 1.11.0 ; \"webpack-dev-middleware\": \"~1.11.0\"\nThis template doesn't have official support for webpack 3 yet so you can't expect it to magically work if you just upgrade all the packages. You can upgrade all packages (other than webpack-dev-middleware) and use the workaround in https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/751#issuecomment-309955295 but understand this will make HMR work at the cost of reduced functionality (no page reload when the html-webpack-plugin template changes).. Can you expand a bit on when this is useful? Why would we set NODE_ENV = production and run the dev server?. Should we provide a .htmlhintrc file with some preset defaults too?\nEdit: Just read https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint/wiki/Usage#how-to-use and saw if .htmlhintrc is missing it will use a default set of rules:\n{\n    \"tagname-lowercase\": true,\n    \"attr-lowercase\": true,\n    \"attr-value-double-quotes\": true,\n    \"doctype-first\": true,\n    \"tag-pair\": true,\n    \"spec-char-escape\": true,\n    \"id-unique\": true,\n    \"src-not-empty\": true,\n    \"attr-no-duplication\": true,\n    \"title-require\": true\n}\nSeems reasonable but maybe we should have a comment with a link to that page? Or to: https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint/wiki/Rules. Also, should this be an option together with ESLint or should it be a separate option during vue-cli init time? I'm not sure which is better to be honest. Thoughts anyone?. Looks like there might soon be a solution for the blank error in friendly-errors-webpack-plugin, see this PR: https://github.com/geowarin/friendly-errors-webpack-plugin/pull/52. Try upgrading to \"html-webpack-plugin\": \"^2.29.0\" which was just recently released. Do you still have the same issue?. Make sure you keep vue-loader at version ^12.2.1 otherwise you'll continue to have HMR issues. I believe you can upgrade to v13 once vue 2.4 has been released.. Have you made any changes to the template?\nWith all the default options I get (build code; minified, gzip'd):\nRuntime + compiler: 28.2 KB\nRuntime only: 19.5 KB\nThe template already comes with webpack-bundle-analyzer which can be used via npm run build --report.. I like this idea in general but how does it fit into the development workflow, when are devs meant to run this command? Is it something that devs are expected to script in their git commit hook or maybe in their code editor save hook? If so, should we also add some documentation for this? Otherwise I suspect people won't use it.. @ferllings did you install the dependencies as mentioned in the docs?\nnpm install sass-loader node-sass --save-dev. I just struggled with issues caused by this. Unless the cache is cleared after each change to the eslint rules (eslintrc file or eslint plugins) the changes are not respected for files already cached.. Could you give some information about your environment?\n\nWhat OS are you using?\nWhat terminal are you running the command in?\nWhich version of Node.js?\nDo you have the same issue with a fresh copy of the template?\nAre you using a command other than npm run dev?. Dup #751 \n\nThis template doesn't support webpack 3 yet.\nYou can track Webpack 3 status on https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/751. Rather than trying to include every possible 'meta language' here I prefer the current approach of including extensive details in the documentation. That way we can provide code samples and background information which is especially useful for new developers.\n\nGive a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.. Stylelint is great! I've been adding it to all my frontend projects. I'd love to see support out of the box in the template.. General support questions are better suited to the forum: https://forum.vuejs.org\n\nTo find out what CSS rules are applied to an element you can use Chrome Devtools. Right click the element and select Inspect. In the Elements tab on the right select the Computed panel. That area shows you all the rules applied. Check in both places and find out what's different.. @gucong3000 love the progress you've made on this so far, however, right now it's broken. I cloned the stylelint feature branch of your repo and initialised a new project but it's not working as expected.\nRunning yarn run lint:stylelint works correctly and linting errors are displayed.\nRunning yarn run dev compiles but does not show any errors.\nI spent quite a bit of time on this in my own project and I havn't been able to debug the cause. It's definitely caused by some dependency but I couldn't figure out which. Have you experience this in your projects?. Just tested and everything works great. Thank you :)\nLooking forward to seeing this as part of the template!. @c0defre4k webpack 3 support is going to be a significant change and definitely should be handled in a separate PR. There's an issue with some background info: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/751. General support questions are probably better suited for the vue forum: https://forum.vuejs.org/c/help\nWhen you post on the forum be sure to include more information about what you're trying to do, where are you trying to serve the files from? A local system? Electron? Anything else will require at least some type of HTTP server.. /build is pretty standard across most JS projects. I'd see this as more of an edge case. May be best to manually modify the path after initialising your projects.. Personally I just change:\npostcss: generateLoaders(),\nto\npostcss: generateLoaders('postcss'),\nand everything works great.. Since we're making the step to webpack 3 should we also now use webpack.optimize.ModuleConcatenationPlugin()? Or perhaps that should be a separate PR?. I like this but developers new to the whole npm and node thing might expect to be able to run npm start. Perhaps start could just be npm run dev?. EADDRINUSE means that node can't open the port because it'a already being used. Stop anything else that's using port 8888 and it should work.. I believe there's no automated way to do this right now. You'll need to manually run a diff against the changes.\nUse vue init webpack vue-webpack-fresh to get an up-to-date base template and then use a diff tool such as meld to see what the changes are.. +1 for changing the alias.\n@ conflicts with NPM orgs/teams and can be confusing when using both the @/ alias and NPM orgs/teams.\n~ is confusing since it means the users home directory on unix machines.\nWhat does that leave us with that's easy to type on all major international keyboards? There's also the question of whether to include the /.\n\n@@ or @@/ \u2014 actually not that bad\n# or #/\n$ or $/\n% or %/\n^ or ^/\n* or */ \u2014 a bit hard to see in some fonts\n+ or +/\n= or =/\n| or |/ \u2014 not sure this is easy to type on some international keyboards\n: or :/\n; or ;/\n~~? or ?/~~ \u2014 may conflict with webpack inline loaders\n~~//~~ \u2014 means protocol relative url\n\\ or \\/ \u2014 kind of confusing. # or ## would be pretty great now that I think about it. I can't think of any conflicts other than looking similar to an internal target location in a href link, but that shouldn't be an issue with webpack imports (right?).\n\n# is short and sweet, ## feels a lot more explicit and may be a good option for better clarity. I'm happy with either being the default.. It's probably worth adding a comment above here to let the developer's know what this plugin is doing.. Do we really need to whitelist 'someclass'?. I'm not familiar with glob-all but will this match files in subdirectories too? Wouldn't it be better to do something like path.join(__dirname, '../src/**/*.vue'),?\nI create directories for routing (/routing/) and vuex (/store/) so I don't think your globbing rules would match any files in those directories.. Where is this coming from? PurifyCSSPlugin is not referenced anywhere, did you forget to import it? Does it not need packages added to package.json -- purifycss-webpack and purify-css?. Do we not have a way to do globbing already that doesn't need an additional dependency?. You still need to add the dependencies to package.json.... I think since you've been able to combine the glob bellow into a single pattern we no longer need glob-all, we can just use node's built in glob right? :). ",

If not maybe a comment in the template linking to some docs?\nTo fix __webpack_hmr from not being found (checking the wrong hostname/port)\nfile: build/dev-client.js\n- var hotClient = require('webpack-hot-middleware/client?noInfo=true&reload=true')\n+ var hotClient = require('webpack-hot-middleware/client?noInfo=true&reload=true&path=http://localhost:8080/__webpack_hmr')noInfo=true&reload=true&path=http://localhost:8080/__webpack_hmr')\nTo fix hot-reload.json from not being found / loading an html page from my django server\nfile: config/index.js\n- assetsPublicPath: '/',\n+ assetsPublicPath: 'http://localhost:8080/',\nTo fix the hot-reload.json CORS issue (No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.)\n(npm install cors --save-dev)\nfile: build/dev-server.js\n+ // allows cross domain requests on dev server so hot reload will work between django and vue dev servers\n+ var cors = require('cors')\n+ app.use(cors())\nSome links to the issues you might find useful:\nhttps://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware#client\nhttp://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#output-publicpath\nhttps://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md#no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resource\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/cors. @LinusBorg You know I just looked at your first comment and that may be simpler than adding the cors middleware express package?

    "Toilal": "@feiyang0117 this is probably because you have ES6 code inside your app sources, but for some reason babel didn't transpiled it to ES5. UglifyJS only supports ES5 code as input, so transpilling is required.. It should be an option, as some people don't want to use TypeScript.. For people coming here, I have issues with .vue files support when using typescript inside my IDE (IntellijIDEA), so I wrote a fork of this template implementing a TypeScript option, but dropping the vue files in favor of splitted files (js / ts / html / css) => https://github.com/Toilal/vue-webpack-template\nIt still supports Hot Module Reload, it was the hard part of the fork.. Too add more tests, simply copy tests/default.sh into another name, and edit the script to generate the project and test it.. Ho I see ! Thanks for the tip.. Sorry, wrong branch. vue-property-decorator adds more decorators to vue-class-component. In fact, it depends on it.. I understand, in this case it make sense to keep vue-property-decorator out of an official typescript template.\nI maintain a fork of this template, Toilal/vue-webpack-template, that supports TypeScript as an option and also supports components writen with 3 distinct files (HTML, CSS, TS). I've included vue-property-decorator in the TypeScript template, it feels to me that something is missing when this dependency is not added. But it's mainly a matter of opinion :). (FYI Library support is coming soon in this template too).. fork-ts-checker-weback-plugin has been released as 0.3.0 with support for vue SFC files.. When TypeScript is chosen, .vue files should not be processed by eslint as it doesn't natively support typescript. \nMaybe we could try https://github.com/nzakas/eslint-plugin-typescript ? This could allow to run \"eslint --fix\" after generating the project.. fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin is really better, but it involves more changes. You may have a look to http://github.com/Toilal/vue-webpack-template as it's already implemented among other options. (it's a fork and I try merge as often as possible to minimize changes from official) . For everybody who needs a TypeScript or a Library template, you should try again https://github.com/Toilal/vue-webpack-template. It's merged with current develop branch of webpack template, and now brings 3 new questions on top of it:\n1) Project Type : App/Library. (When you choose Library, sources are splitted in 2 folders, src for the library and app for the demo/docs app.\n2) Which language do you want to use? TypeScript (ts-loader + babel)/ES2015 (babel)\n3) Use Class-Style Components (vue-class-component + vue-property-decorators)? Y/N \nThe template currently use dummy Single File Components with src attributes poiting to external html/css/ts/js files because TSLint doesn't support checking vue files, but I consider adding an option to really use Single File Components like in the official webpack template. For now, It's still possible to manually copy/paste the html/css/ts/js files into vue files.\nFor people who tested this fork months ago, It's now really closer to the official webpack template (it use vue-loader).. @stephan-v Checkout this template :) (It doesn't use rollup, but it tries to do it's best with webpack 3). It should at least be consistent, there's a <router-view> tag just above in the same file.. Setting host to 0.0.0.0 is NOT enough, because dev server check the HTTP host header actually match what's is defined in host parameter. If it doesn't match, it shows an empty HTML page with \"Invalid Host Header\".\nIt can be useful for mobile access or Dockerized yarn/npm installations.. import { Vue } from 'vue/types/vue' instead of import vue from 'vue'. Sorry, I forgot one important thing ! The error is caused by ts-loader (i'm running typescript).. https://github.com/pragmasphere/vue-tree\nIt's fixed in this repository, but you revert those lines\nhttps://github.com/pragmasphere/vue-tree/blob/2302c9b18b7298a0e83ad18f43d2f212bb487078/build/build.js#L22-L24. I think the comment would be ok for now.\nIn fact I realised later the problem was maybe related to ts-loader, so let's close this one, no problem. thanks :). It's OK. for yarn, you can omit run keyword. (yarn lint --fix). For some reason, those tests fails when using the brand new automated \"npm install\", so expect script are written to answer \"No\" to the last question, and bash script runs the commands manually.. After some additions to support vue-class-components with ES2015 scripts, I experienced some errors when running e2e tests. babel plugins declared in test env of .babelrc were not loaded.\nI then noticed that NODE_ENV=testing was declared in the codebase\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/cc89353be444eee88e7e6480bf186a3cf5bd439f/template/test/e2e/runner.js#L2\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/17ed63b1b3a0eaaebd3f593c08c32107a7cb7e01/template/config/test.env.js#L6\nbut it was inconsistent with BABEL_ENV=\"test\" declared in package.json scripts for unit tests, and inconsistent with .babelrc env entry\nWith those changes, it seems to fix my issue. Don't know why the CI fails, it seems unrelated to those changes.. Ok I see. \nMaybe the testing occurences could be replaced by test then ? If it's convention for most testing tools, it would make things less confusing (I didn't know about jest adding node_env=\"test\" automatically).\nLong explanation of my particular case:\nI also have a \"Library\" option in my fork that split sources in 2 directories : \"app\", and \"src\". \n\"src\" contains sources of the library that will be included in the production build, and \"app\" contains a UI that can be used to build a docs/demo website from the library, helps the development of the library by providing a UI on top of it.\nProduction build only bundle the entrypoint from \"src\", but E2E tests needs to run against the \"app\", so I have made a change to run E2E tests against the dev configuration.\nBut in fact, I think I should create 2 production builds, one for the lib, and one for the \"app\", and run E2E tests against the production build of the \"app\".\nFeel free to close this one If you don't want to replace the testing occurences to test, else I can update the pull request.. I have update the Pull Request with the proposal of renaming \"testing\" to \"test\". ~I have removed cross-env dependency as it's not used anymore, because NODE_ENV=\"test\" is defined by webpack configuration.~. It's actually far better than expect scripts ! Thanks :)\nIt's a shame inquirer.js doesn't support some kind of automation, the isNotTest variable seems like a hack, but it's still better than expect script that are just *** to build and maintain..

The working directory is set to the project root when you start the dev server with npm run or yarn run, so your entire working directory is served by webpack-dev-server (see https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-contentbase). This means that the default assetsSubDirectory only works because the source directory is also called static. As soon as you change assetsSubDirectory, it breaks.\nHowever, under e2e tests it works because it uses the production config and CopyWebpackPlugin. Using CopyWebpackPlugin in the dev config too instead of relying on contentBase fixes this problem, at least with assetsSubDirectory set to an empty string..

So am I trying to do something that I shouldn't?. @paulvanbladel I tried reproducing the error for js section as a separate file and I think I know what the issue(and the workaround) is. \nWhen I placed a js file in the same folder as my Vue component with the same name(hello.js), I saw the following warning:\nWARNING in ./src/components/Hello.js\nThere are multiple modules with names that only differ in casing.\nThis can lead to unexpected behavior when compiling on a filesystem with other case-semantic.\nUse equal casing. Compare these module identifiers:\n* E:\\Projects\\repos\\vue-test\\node_modules\\babel-loader\\lib\\index.js!E:\\Projects\\repos\\vue-test\\src\\components\\Hello.js\n    Used by 3 module(s), i. e.\n    E:\\Projects\\repos\\vue-test\\node_modules\\babel-loader\\lib\\index.js!E:\\Projects\\repos\\vue-test\\test\\unit\\specs\\Hello.spec.js\n* E:\\Projects\\repos\\vue-test\\node_modules\\babel-loader\\lib\\index.js!E:\\Projects\\repos\\vue-test\\src\\components\\hello.js\n    Used by 3 module(s), i. e.\n    E:\\Projects\\repos\\vue-test\\src /^\\.\\/(?!main(\\.js)?$)/\nAnd the tests failed with the following output:\n```\n13 03 2017 09:55:37.445:INFO [PhantomJS 2.1.1 (Windows 8 0.0.0)]: Connected on socket Eo_tCb-w3-ZkzEQyAAAA with id 29354609\nERROR LOG: '[Vue warn]: Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined.\n(found in )'\nHello.vue\n    \u00d7should render correct contents\n        undefined is not a constructor (evaluating 'vm.$el.querySelector('.hello h1')')\n        webpack:///test/unit/specs/Hello.spec.js:8:32 <- index.js:7518:32\n```\nHowever, when I placed the js file in a subfolder(sections), the tests passed.

I tested my app after removing the polyfills and things seem to be working fine. However, note that I am extensively using lodash and not relying on native modules.. Although this doesn't matter if transform-runtime is going to be removed, in a different project, the  \"polyfill\": false directive is not being respected. Could have something to do with this issue but I am not calling super() anywhere.. I extracted the stats for my webpack chunks and modules by enabling profile and using this plugin. Can anybody please help me understand why the polyfill: false directive is being ignored? The stats.json file can be uploaded here for interactive visualization.\n\nBabel config\n```json\n{\n    \"presets\": [\n        [\"es2015\", { \"modules\": false }],\n        \"stage-1\"\n    ],\n    \"plugins\": [\n        \"lodash\",\n        \"syntax-dynamic-import\", [\n            \"component\", [{\n                \"libraryName\": \"element-ui\",\n                \"styleLibraryName\": \"theme-default\"\n            }]\n        ],\n        [\"transform-runtime\", { \"polyfill\": false }]\n    ],\n    \"comments\": false,\n    \"env\": {\n        \"test\": {\n            \"plugins\": [\"istanbul\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCompressed stats file - stats.json.zip\nEdit: I was able to reproduce the issue of polyfill - false being ignored in a fresh copy of the webpack config.\nWhen async functions are used, transform-runtime adds transformation ./~/babel-runtime/helpers/asyncToGenerator.js which has a dependency ./~/babel-runtime/core-js/promise.js.\nSteps to reproduce:\n```\n$ vue init webpack vue-test\nThis will install Vue 2.x version of the template.\nFor Vue 1.x use: vue init webpack#1.0 vue-test\n?

I will check this again sometime this week.. Apologies for the delay in my response. I tried this out with the latest beta version for babel packages and the issue is not fixed. I have requested that the issue in babel repo be reopened.. > I got an error running test on Windows 10.\nThis might have something to do with git core.autocrlf setting. Read more here. @LinusBorg extract-text-webpack-plugin and html-webpack-plugin have been updated to support webpack 3. inject-loader has still not been updated though.. There was a PR merged in which allowed webpack 3 peer dependency. But not released. . @limichange I think this warning was coming from extract-text-webpack-plugin.\n\nDeprecationWarning: Chunk.modules is deprecated.\n\nLooks to be fixed - extract-text-webpack-plugin/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes. @adam-lynch I don't think it is as simple as updating all the package dependency versions. While webpack@3 was a backward compatible release for the most part, there are evidently differences in behavior which are breaking the hot reload. Let's wait for the repo maintainers to update.. The branch has been merged.. No need to specify the branch. My bad. Try vue init webpack#develop. Great! Created the PR - #763 . I usually checkin my vscode files for settings, recommended extensions etc. They aren't transient unlike intellij's .idea. The vscode repo does this too! . I wasn't aware of that. \nI have made a PR to the repo with a similar change - https://github.com/geowarin/friendly-errors-webpack-plugin/pull/57 updating the readme.\nAlthough I doubt there will be any significance to the no-op, let us wait for their response.\nAlso, rebased.. @LinusBorg No activity in the friendly-errors-webpack-plugin repo. This PR is a very minor change so could we please merge it in? . If this is approved, I can make a similar PR to vuejs-templates/pwa. TBH, I use the lint or lint:fix script commands quite rarely. I usually setup pre  commit hooks with lint-staged. But it makes sense to add the fix script if you have the one for linting.. @LinusBorg Shall I close this?. I understand @LinusBorg. Closing. . :smile: Cheers!. ping. There's shouldn't be but, to be sure, I can test it once after eslint is updated.. My aplogies @MaxMilton. I'll try to make a PR to eslint-loader to fix this.. Rebased to fix conflict. Also added 'use strict' directive because of this:\n```\n\u03bb node --version\nv4.0.0\n\u03bb echo let a = 1 > test-node4.js\n\u03bb node test-node4.js\nE:\\Projects\\experiments\\test-node4.js:1\n(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { let a = 1\n                                                              ^^^\nSyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode\n    at exports.runInThisContext (vm.js:53:16)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:413:25)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:452:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:475:10)\n    at startup (node.js:117:18)\n    at node.js:951:3\n`` . ping @LinusBorg. Any changes needed from my side?. @LinusBorg I upgraded a project to webpack 3 and while it isn't a through check, things were working as expected. Hot-reloading too forsrccode.. The original PR is this one - babel/babel-preset-env#161 and as you can see in https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/pull/161#issuecomment-322135362, the feature was landed in2.0.0-alpha.19but later they moved it to the monorepo and switched to that version(v7.0.0-beta.32is the latest). But yea.. some confusing changes. For example [babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs) has been renamed and moved to [@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs). I expect they will ease the transition with codemods. In any case, the last released stable version ofbabel-preset-envdoes not load the targets frompackage.json`.. Thanks @jarrodldavis, that's very helpful. \n@LinusBorg I agree that having to define the targets in 2 places is not ideal. However, this issue will be fixed once babel packages are out of beta which I am guessing will be soon. Are you sure you want me to setup .babelrc.js ?. This approach breaks jest \ud83d\ude1e\n```\n\u03bb yarn run unit\nyarn run v1.3.2\nwarning ..\\package.json: No license field\n$ jest --config test/unit/jest.conf.js --coverage\n FAIL  test\\unit\\specs\\HelloWorld.spec.js\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\nE:\\Projects\\experiments\\vue-webpack-dev\\test\\unit\\setup.js:1\n({\"Object.<anonymous>\":function(module,exports,require,__dirname,__filename,global,jest){import Vue from 'vue';\n                                                                                         ^^^^^^\n\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token import\n\n  at ScriptTransformer._transformAndBuildScript (node_modules/jest-runtime/build/script_transformer.js:305:17)\n      at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\n\nTest Suites: 1 failed, 1 total\nTests:       0 total\nSnapshots:   0 total\nTime:        0.872s, estimated 1s\nRan all test suites.\nRunning coverage on untested files...\n    Failed to collect coverage from E:\\Projects\\experiments\\vue-webpack-dev\\src\\components\\HelloWorld.vue\n    ERROR: TypeError: Cannot read property 'fileCoverage' of undefined\n    STACK: TypeError: Cannot read property 'fileCoverage' of undefined\n    at Instrumenter.instrumentSync (E:\\Projects\\experiments\\vue-webpack-dev\\node_modules\\istanbul-lib-instrument\\dist\\instrumenter.js:147:40)\n    at exports.default (E:\\Projects\\experiments\\vue-webpack-dev\\node_modules\\jest-cli\\build\\generate_empty_coverage.js:34:18)\n    at module.exports (E:\\Projects\\experiments\\vue-webpack-dev\\node_modules\\jest-cli\\build\\reporters\\coverage_worker.js:52:94)\n    at handle (E:\\Projects\\experiments\\vue-webpack-dev\\node_modules\\worker-farm\\lib\\child\\index.js:44:8)\n    at process.

Tried it, it does not get loaded during testing.. Thanks @jarrodldavis, that does work. A little concerned about the increased complexity though.. > I'm sorry to say that I think I've changed my mind again :(\nNo problem at all \ud83d\ude04. I honestly appreciate the thought you and the rest of Vue.js team put into maintaining and developing the ecosystem \ud83d\ude47. \n\nI'm afraid that the new format of the babelrc.js file with the conditional return depending on environment will lead to a lot of confusion for people not familiar with the reasons we did it.\n\nI had similar concerns.\n\nSo I guess we will have to bite the bullet and revert to having the browserslist in both package.json and .babelrc, and make a note in the docs to make people aware that they have to make changes to browserlist in two places until Babel 7 has landed.\n\nOkay, removing a commit is easy enough. Where do you think I should update the docs?. I already removed the commit which setup .babelrc.js. I'll be able to update the docs tomorrow. If you prefer I do that in a different PR, this can be merged in now. . I had tried babel-minify a few months back and the bundle size was slightly larger.. Hey @LinusBorg, I'd like to help you with testing this on windows. I'll try it out tomorrow.

Give me some hints. Maybe I can help you fix it.. Okay, I'll look into it.. btw.. Instead of manually wrappingspawnin a promise, why not use [execa](https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa)? It would handle a lot of edge cases as well.. Are you planning to drop support for node 4?. @LinusBorg The functionality that you have added to the template, it could be used by pretty much all templates right.

    "theoephraim": "Check out https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/ to avoid the awkward JSON.stringify and extra quotes. You can just specify which process.env keys you want to expose to the frontend.\nfor example: new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(['NODE_ENV', 'DEBUG']). Just running into this in my app now.\nI had been going down the route of using https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/ to set up env vars normally (ie using dotenv or whatever setup the user would want based on which mode they are in) and then just choosing a subset of keys to expose to the front-end. Your approach seems to be more flexible, although a little more verbose (manually mapping \"build\" keys to \"exposed\" ones). Perhaps another config option to just choose which keys to expose could make sense?\nOn a related note - I'm not sure why yet, but the define-plugin does work within vue components while the environment-plugin does not.. Will something else be taking its place instead?\nIf not I think it is important someone work on the config setup.\nI'd be happy to take a crack at it.. Ah - didn't realize vue-cli 3 will be replacing.\nThanks for the info!. What is the reasoning behind the name \"externals\"?\nSince this file is loaded regardless of \"mode\" it seems like the place to store the default values that will get overwritten with mode/env specific values - hence maybe \"defaults\" would make more sense than \"externals\"?. a little nitpicky, but this fn name makes me think that ALL env vars will be stringified and exposed.. The naming of the variables dir here is also a little confusing. Aren't all your env vars and webpack config settings \"variables\"? Maybe config/exposed or config/public would be more clear that these are the variables that will be accessible to the build/browser.\nSimilarly, when I started using this template, I found the fact that config/index.js was mostly build-related configuration a bit confusing. Maybe rename to config/build.js or config/webpack? The more explicit  import would likely make it more clear. It could also be worth a quick review of what config lives in there vs what lives in the build directory in the various webpack config files.\nPerhaps config/index would be the file that loads various files and exposes the formats needed in different places throughout.. typo \"Your\". This flexibility is nice, but don't many people use multiple .env files (for different modes) to solve this problem?\nMaybe worth adding a note about using separate .env files as the \"switch\" rather than remapping in the config/variables files.\n.

A staging environment will leverage the same build process as a production environment but with a different config.\nI'll spend the day trying to make this work and will spam results into this issue \ud83d\ude1b . Alright I made it work.\nI introduced .env files so I can easily deploy them with now or other cloud providers.\nI got two dotfiles, .env and .env.prod.\nThe files look like this:\n// .env\nAPI_URL='\"https://stage.github.com/api/\"'\n// .env.prod\nAPI_URL='\"https://github.com/api/\"'\nI include the .env file with the dotenv package locally in prod.env.js, which now looks like this:\n```\n// prod.env.js\nrequire('dotenv').config();\nmodule.exports = {\n  NODE_ENV: '\"production\"',\n  API_URL: process.env.API_URL,\n};\n```\nWith a regular build and deployment, I now get the config of .env.\nNow you have all the options to include .env.prod in your build.  The dotenv package will not throw an error, if the file is missing!\nFor example I utilize the environment variable features of now.sh which means I can deploy my app with now --dotenv=.env.prod.\nThis will parse and turn the .env.prod file into environment variables in my cloud instance / docker container / what ever - and then runs the build-process.\nThe build process looks for the .env file but its missing (remember, it's not local, it's in the cloud right now). But process.env.API_URL is getting it's value from the environment now \ud83c\udf89 .\nAnd boom - I got a build with different configs.\nObviously if you don't use now as a cloud, you have to figure out your own way to pass the other env file to your build. But this worked for me. Maybe it helps as a starting point.\nI'd still leave this issue open as I still think this build should provide help with that and make this process a bit clearer.\n.

Wow again, I really appreciate you all are looking into this and advancing this template for our needs \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4f \nWhile I probably can't provide the extensive in depth code review you're looking for (sorry about that), here are some thoughts:\nThe modes are the different ways your app can run:\n\nnpm run build ( = production mode, NODE_ENV='production')\n\nI would recommend to rename \"production mode\" to \"build mode\" or \"shipment mode\". I think sentences like these causes confusion:\n\nRunning in production mode in a staging environment probably requires different environment variable values than in the production environment, etc.\n\nOther than that I agree with the split in modes and environments.\nA bigger topic\n\nStrategies for different build environments.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood but it looks like this setup again limits me to three different configs via .env vars.\nAPI_URL_DEV, API_URL_TEST and API_URL_PROD. And they all go into the same .env file which (in my experience) is not how env vars are used.\nIf the application is built in any other environment than my local computer, the env vars should come from the server/environment and it's the developers/teams job to make them available. There is no .env file in the repo (in fact, it should be in .gitignore by default).\nWhich makes me question the usecase of API_URL_DEV. If I deploy to a development-environment or QA-environment, the mode I run the application in doesn't matter. The app gets it's config via process.env and the environment is providing those configs.\nMode and environment should not be coupled IMO.\nIf a developer choses to build the application always locally and then deploys it to the different stages, THEN the configs need to be available locally - but again, the mode should not matter.\nInstead, a user should create multiple .env files which is a common practice afaik (we do it too).\nFor example:\n- .env for local development\n- .env.prod for a production environment\n- .env.int for an integration environment\n- .env.qa for an QA environment\nNow let's say I want to deploy the app to QA and go through the two options: build locally vs build on the server.\nBuild locally\nI run npm run build/dev --.env.qa which should pass the path of the specific .env file to the dotenv package. No matter which mode, it choses the correct .env file.\nBuild Remotely\nI deploy my app and run npm run build/dev on the server. There are no .env files available. The env vars of .env.qa are in the node process and available via process.env - no matter which mode, the config is correct.\nThis solution eliminates any assumption about how many environments there are and there is no need to namespace anything.\nHope this helps in any way - let me know if I missed something and misunderstood the solution.\nThanks again for your work and get well into the new year!\n  . hmm no.

Oh stupid me, I was extracting the css in the vendor vue component I imported, so of course it wasn't there. So I stopped extracting it in the vendor package and now the css is stuck in the vendor.[hash].js file and is not being included in the parent project's app.[hash].css.. ^ this is probably more ideal though, when thinking about caching. Since likely vendor styles would change less and you don't want that included in your app.[hash].css file which will get rehashed more often.

Using the externals require modification to the index.html file directly which affects both dev and prod.. @LinusBorg If that's the case, than I have just wrote a plugin to do this https://github.com/van-nguyen/webpack-cdn-plugin\nI hope people in the same boat as me will find it useful :). @LinusBorg I have made a pull request for this, can you please take a look? https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/pull/737\nCheers.. @Aladdin-ADD @nickmessing is this good enough to merge? Thanks.. @posva What's the main advantage of having them in the same file besides hacking for performance? Specially when http2 is on the rise.. I mean files are separate by nature and should be called as such. Putting them together and serving them in the same file is a \"hack\" just because of the limitations of http. When you use http2 for the better this actually hurts and you will need to \"unhack\" everything.. While I agree on most parts but by using a CDN you are contributing to the network of caches and in best case scenario your users won't even need to download the file (leaving gzip irrelevant) while helping other sites that uses the same CDN achieve the same. This helps distribute Vue and your other favorite libraries. To me this is huge savings, but I'm happy to leave this off by default. happy to discuss.. @posva I have made the option to default to false, can this please be reconsidered?. But vuex is not even part of the template?. The plugin is not smart enough to do that.. they will have to add it manually. For vue-router it's already part of the template, we can do. As we don't know what the user will add.. it can be anything right? The moment that you start adding stuff not part of the template, you will also be expected to make it work manually yourself because then it's just your own custom build.. please correct me if I'm wrong here?. The plugin is called WebpackCdnPlugin, this PR is mainly for the said plugin. vuex flag does not exist yet? it can be in another PR when it does?. It is related.. the plugin is the only one consuming the array.. and produce the cdn artefacts.. The purpose of this array is providing options for the said plugin.. nothing else... @posva sure, hope it's all good.. Think have to do this to prevent empty lines when #cdn is false.. @nickmessing acknowledged, and has been fixed. Thanks for that, good spot.. I've tested running vue init van-nguyen/webpack seems there is no empty lines, maybe it's smart enough to detect these things.. Good catch, acknowledged. I couldn't find any reference to vuex, however I have fixed for vue-router. Hope it's all good.. I'm confused, thought the {{#router}} switch is meant to do that? Are you suggesting to actually read the packages.json file directly and not by flag?. @posva is this what you meant?. ",

Here is the context:\nI'm creating a Component folder Hello/ with 2 files in it: index.vue, and script.js.\nInside the index.vue, I have my template definition as well as <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>.\nWithin the script file, I intentionally added a tab to violate the lint definition and saw that:\n- If the logic is in the external script.js file, no error is thrown and the page renders fine.\n- If the logic is in the external script.js file, I can do npm run build successfully\n- If the logic is in the external script.js file, an error is thrown when running npm run lint\nAll three points fail if the logic is moved into the vue file instead. It seems that for whatever reason, the importing of script.js causes it to ignore the lint rules.\nTo replicate this:\n1. Download this template.\n2. In components, create a folder \"Hello/\"\n3. Move \"Hello.vue\" to \"Hello/index.vue\"\n4. Create \"Hello/script.js\", moving logic from the script tag in \"index.vue\" to this new file\n5. include the new script file with <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>.\n6. change the component import from just \"/Hello\" to \"/Hello/index\" (you could make a change in the webpack to allow index.vue as your default but not necessary).\n7. Intentionally violate lint inside of script.js\n8. Run either npm run dev or npm run build, observe the successful results.\n9. Run npm run lint, observe failed results.. Alright I figured this out: If you have a fresh copy of the vuejs webpack teplate, open up vue-loader.conf.js and add preLoaders: {\n    js: 'eslint-loader'\n  }, to your config file.\nDoing that picks up ESLint when I spit up my script from the main .vue file.\nHope this helps others!

You just need to upload your dist/ folder to your bucket.\nPro tips:\n\nI used s3-deploy package to automate the deployin process\nMake sure you disable the cache for your index.html, I ran into some issues with this. To do that, I'm uploading the whole folder with no cache flags, and then reuploading the index.html with the --cache 0 flag, like this (package.json scripts):\n\njs\n    \"deploy-s3\": \"s3-deploy --cwd './dist/' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --region YOUR_REGION --gzip --etag  --bucket YOUR_BUCKET\",\n    \"deploy-s3-task\": \"npm run deploy-s3 -- './dist/**' && npm run deploy-s3 -- --cache 0 -- './dist/index.html'\",\n(make sure you npm run build your project before uploading it!)\nHope it helps.. Hi @iharsuvorau, \nthat message only means that you cannot browser to file://whatever/path/you/are/using/index.html and expect your project to work.\nHave you tried uploading it to S3? I just ran npm run build and uploaded the whole /dist/ and everything worked as expected.\nHope it helps!. It might have something to do with windows and hosts... could try changing your host from localhost to 0.0.0.0 in config/index.js? Solved a couple of issues for me.\nHope it helps.. Hm, that's weird. Could you just double check that you are using node 8.8.0? As long as you are on node greater than v4, you should be good to go.\nCould you just describe your environment a little more? node, npm versions, OS, etc.\nAre you running your app from the OS cli or using some IDE?\n. You are completely right, I'd rather stick with the current config. I'm afraid I don't know how to improve bail error output, so feel free to close the PR if you think it's been waiting for help long enough.\nThanks!. Google says that \"This bug seems to be caused by installing a dependency that depends on an old version of NPM\". (source).\nRunning npm config set loglevel warn might solve the issue, which I think is not related to vue-cli or this template.\nHope it helps!. Hi!\nI think autoprefixer is working fine, it's just using browserslist to decide whether or not prefixes should be added. Try adding user-select: none and it will properly add prefixes in your dist files. Transform attribute does not require prefixes in last browser versions.\nIf you change your browserslist config to something like\njson\n\"browserslist\": [\n  \"> 0.5%\",\n  \"last 15 versions\"\n]\nyou'll see more vendor prefixes being added.\n__\nSo the question could be \"why is dev build adding prefixes?\". Is it possible that dev build process ignores browserlist? But... another question: does it even matter? \nhope it helps!. Hi!\nCould you provide some kind of environment info or even better, a repository link? It's hard to know what's going on without context.\nArrow functions should be working out of the box, so it must be something else.. If the error says \"syntax error\", it may be related to the import statement and babel. Check this out.\nhope it helps!. Hi,\nIt's hard to tell what's going on without seeing your package.json file. There's probably a syntax error. Try to lint your JSON file here.\nHope it helps!. Hi,\nI think you'll need to import the mixins file in your components. You can read some alternatives here.\nlong story short: import the file in your component or add it to your webpack configuration.\nHope it helps!.

Here they suggest changing your sourcemap devtool.\nHope it helps!. Hi! Could you provide some sort of environment to reproduce the issue (github repo, codesandbox...)? It looks like a webpack css/sass loader config.. Hi,\nhave you tried this? https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/483\nhope it helps.. Hi!

You have to import your .scss variables in every .vue file you want to use them as explained here:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/328. @benmccallum your problem is that you are using type instead of lang.\n<style type=\"scss\" scoped>\nShould be:\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\nDocs: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html. For regular CSS you don't need to specify lang, and type is never used for the style tag in vue components.. Here is another shenanigan with SVGs.\nWhen using <img src=\"../../../assets/icon.svg\"> the icon renders fine as a data URL.\nBut when passing the path as a prop <img :src=\"iconPath\"> I get exactly this in the DOM <img src=\"../../../assets/logo.svg\"> which obviously renders a broken image.. Ok I figured it out thanks to this discussion:\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/126\nI still can't resolve paths directly in the <img> tag though. I don't know if declaring relative paths is worse than declaring computed properties per icon. Probably the best solution is to create a plugin to automate that.. Why not simply go with src?. ",

Yeah you're right, we should get correct source mapping before merging.\nAs you said, jest-vue-preprocessor doesn't return a map or have any logic to produce one.

It should test every combination if possible. @nirkki can you try running:\nnpm run unit -- --no-watchman\nI'm basing this off a stackoverflow answer.. I'm not sure what to suggest.

Maybe you could start with a more basic template, without using classes and inheritance, but still with TS type inferences, as proposed in https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Vue-Starter.

I also don't think that everyone will necessarily want vue-property-decorators. Maybe if it becomes a more standard way of setting up Vue with TS then it should be added, but as of now it just doesn't seem to be part of the standard.\nAgain, maybe I'm wrong about what the standard is for Vue with TS. But to sum up my reasons, I want to keep the template as simple as possible while also providing the standard way of setting up Vue with TS.. @lbssousa I think that would be great!

    "alexmalkin": "I thought I'd provide a use case example, so others can fully understand what I am getting at here:\nThere are three components, app-image, app-video and app-post. All are vue components with their own HTML/template, css and js in a .vue file. They all can be used independently on their own, but app-video and app-image can also be used within app-post, but app-image cannot be used within app-video (or vice versa) Note I am stripping out any props/bindings etc. as this is concerned with the css classes.\nHere are their templates and styles:\napp-image:\ntemplate\n<img class=\"app-image\" src=\"image.jpg\">\nstyle\n.app-image {\n    width: 200px;\n}\napp-video:\ntemplate\n```\n\n  ...stuff\n\n```\nstyle\n.app-video {\n    width: 300px;\n}\napp-post\ntemplate\n```\n\n\n\n```\nstyle\n```\n.app-post {\n    / styles /\n}\n.app-post-content {\n    width: 100%;\n/* styles */\n\n}\n```\nUsage\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nRegistration\nimport appImage from './components/image.vue'\nimport appVideo from './components/video.vue'\nimport appPost from './components/post.vue'\nWithin certain parts of the app, the app-video and app-image are inserted into app-post as shown in the usage above.\nAs you can see, the app-image is given the class app-post-content, making them a BEM 'mix' component, whereby the app-image would have styles app-image and app-post-content applied.\nThe important thing to note, in the css is that app-post-content needs to override whatever it is placed on, so it can control its contents.\nThis is where the problem is, because when running npm dev, the css output in the  (in the form of multiple style tags) seems to be determined by the order the template tags appear, and because app-post is first (because its a parent of the others) its outputted css is first, however when running npm build, the order is in the order of the module imports, which is desired result.\nI am trying to archive where the appearance and output in the dev server is the same as production, as right now this cannot be achieved without forcing the dev server to use extract-text-plugin or use a system sass compiler and not write the components css in the components vue files.\nA few things that could be argued, but here are the counter-arguments\nYou can just use scoped styles\nNo, it would have the same effect, as the app-post would still come before the children, so their styles would prevail. \nPut your css somewhere else and reference it as separate imports\nThis can be done and would solve it, but it is super nice and initiative to have the css alongside the js and html for each component, because like the JS, it is directly coupled to the elements, app-image is not meant to be used on any other combination of html except the above example. In addition the list of css imports would be mirroring in the vue imports, making it double maintainability.\nIn addition, the vue single file components are such as nice and intuitive feature, and enable JS devs to easily see corresponding classes/styles/modifiers that are used.\nBottom line\nThe vue wepback template is outputting css in different orders depending on if the compilation is in build mode or dev mode. Given the nature of css (cascading style sheet), order is very important for css to function correctly, and should be preserved. Those not using the scope feature experience inconsistency and many headaches when the production version doesn't look the same as the dev version or vice versa. Good css is about layering styles in the cascade, unfortunately this is completely broken in this scenario.\nPotential solution \nEnable the dev server to have the option to always use extract-text-plugin / separate css file based on the import list and and inject hashed .css files on file-save in the same way it does with the js files to maintain hot reloadablity.\nI altered the vue-loader.conf and webpack.dev.conf to do this, but it was messy, forced-upon and not worth sharing.\nThe other thing my team was doing was placing separate css files in each component folder, and then using a isolated/native sass compiler to produce a single .css and then get webpack to import the single compiled css, but this required a separate list of includes, again causing repetition/bad maintainability. \nThanks to LinusBorg for his help on Discord.\nI'd attempt to contribute a half decent solution but webpack configuration is not something I've found easy to get into.\n. @autumnwoodberry as mentioned above, scoped styles would have the same effect.\nIn addition, as a CSS developer, I would argue that 'forcing' scoped styles is unnecessary as if your components are properly structured and cascaded, adding specificity is not needed when you can namespace, and adding that specificity with attribute selectors as the webpack template does is bad selector performance, compared to namespaces/cascaded styles. . These aren't global styles though? They are specific to html components (templates), in the css world we call them mix components https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/#mix\nI feel this issue goes a little deeper and is more to do with CSS being overlooked, I love the idea of Vue single files, but unlike JS imports, CSS is Cascading and order is everything, trying to force JS paradigms for CSS doesn't work, if you're serious about CSS efficiency and design. The simple solution is just for the dev server to output the css based on component import order, because the order doesn't matter for the JS, it would give it purpose for those wanting to control CSS order.\nAs for your selector performance, see https://csswizardry.com/2011/09/writing-efficient-css-selectors/ \nWe may only be talking miliseconds but for large platforms/sites like I am working on this racks up and is not an option, also the selector performance for Vue scoping is even worser than this because its using the attribute selector on each class, meaning the DOM has to search for every class and then every attribute, and then find the multiple. It is so much more efficient to just go btn-icon than [attribute].icon... this is actually a separate issue.. @DimitrisNL I have a working solution for the older version of this template, but the recent update broke the hot-reloading of css changes with this fix, and I'm yet to find a solution. \nPreviously it could be achieved by the following:\nwebpack.dev.conf.js\nAdd to the top of the file\njavascript\nvar ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')\nWithin the modules object in modules.exports, add extract: true like so:\njavascript\nmodule: {\n    rules: utils.styleLoaders({\n        sourceMap: config.dev.cssSourceMap,\n        extract: true // edit - add\n    })\n},\nWithin the plugins array in the modules.exports, add:\njavascript\nnew ExtractTextPlugin({\n    filename: '[name].[contenthash].css'\n})\nWithin vue-loader.conf.js\nChange extract: isProduction to extract: true in the loaders object\nAs I said, this perviously worked, and meant styles retained the same order in production and development versions. This however longer hot-reloads in the recent update to this template.\n. ",
    "autumnwoodberry": "I am of the opinion that un-scoped CSS does not belong in a component because it becomes global. Importing a module in another module shouldn't affect the global scope.\nI would actually prefer to force all components to scoped styling..

The fact is that what you are proposing is contrary to the design and intent of vue components, which are intended to be modular.\nI understand what you are trying to achieve, but I think that putting global style rules into a component is not a pattern I would like to see encouraged..

As far as I understand you suggest to import bootstrap into the bundle. In that case Webpack is going to load it via style-loader and process using postcss (i.e. autoprefixer).\n\nFor existing libraries e.g. Bootstrap or Semantic UI, you can place them inside /static and reference them directly in index.html. This avoids extra build time and also is better for browser caching. (See Static Asset Handling)\n\nQuote is taken from docs to template. I believe that the man who wrote the lines meant that the user can optimize build process by putting boostrap.min.css into /static so that files will be transferred to /dist as-is without piping Bootstrap through webpack pipeline. But this solution lacks automatic version management. Maybe it would be better option to load the file via webpack (in order to get it from node_modules) but do not process via style-loader and autoprefixer (because bootstrap is already built, minified and prefixed). Instead webpack may just copy the bootstrap.min.css as-is to the /dist folder.. Duplicate of #955. ",

Hi,\nIn the config/index.js there is this assetsPublicPath configuration option. By default it is set to a root path. I am working on the application that is deployed to a sub-directory, so in my project I set assetsPublicPath to /panel/. \nThe middleware connect-history-api-fallback is responsible for routing requests to the main /index.html file. You can read more here. Because of assetsPublicPath my main index.html file is not served as localhost:5000/index.html but instead it is served as localhost:5000/panel/index.html.\nWithout this change, when I access localhost:5000/panel/ the request is not rewritten to index.html and I get the error \"Cannot GET /panel/\". Configuring connect-history-api-fallback with the correct index path is fixing this problem.\nFor convenience this change also adds a  redirect from / to /panel (or whatever is set as assetsPublicPath). You can now run the server and access localhost:5000 which would then redirect to the app hosted at localhost:5000/panel/ which shows the index.html content.\nNothing is changed if assetsPublicPath is left at the default value. In that case no redirect is added and connect-history-api-fallback will be configured with /index.html which is the default setting.. Hi @LinusBorg I can confirm that there are no issues with webpack-dev-server now. Only redirect is missing, I've pushed this as #980 . I would check what Chrome extensions do you have enabled.

    "ceefour": "npm cache's claim:\n\nAll data that passes through the cache is fully verified for integrity on both insertion and extraction. Cache corruption will either trigger an error, or signal to pacote that the data must be refetched, which it will do automatically. For this reason, it should never be necessary to clear the cache for any reason other than reclaiming disk space, thus why clean now requires --force to run.\nThe npm cache is strictly a cache: it should not be relied upon as a persistent and reliable data store for package data. npm makes no guarantee that a previously-cached piece of data will be available later, and will automatically delete corrupted contents. The primary guarantee that the cache makes is that, if it does return data, that data will be exactly the data that was inserted.\n\nBut based on several issues (pretty common I guess), npm cache's \"corruption-proof\" seem to be just assumptions, not reality. :'(\n. I have to agree with @deepakjha14 :\n\nI had to downgrade node and npm to 8.11.0 and 5.6.0 respectively and multiple tries with npm cache clean --force, finally it seems to be working now\n\nFor me even npm cache clean --force \"works\" intermittently.

    "Frizi": "You don't build for development. You run the development server. There is no \"building\" action for dev environment, as opposed to all the rest of them.. All the outcome of dev command happens to land inside webpack's memory-fs, and it's directly served from there via express server. Those files are unusable outside of this context, as those are very big. Usually they contain evaled modules, inlined sourcemaps and hot-reloading logic. You should never use that server as your production environment.\nThat's why we have a build command, a de-facto standard used by many deployment solutions as your default app building hook. It just produces a bunch of ready to serve files. That doesn't mean that it has to run in production though, as you might have many different environments distinct from your main prod servers. All of those targets will use the same script, but having a different value inside NODE_ENV environment variable.\nJust imagine what a disaster would it be if somebody would assume that prod runs only on production environment, and with this in mind added a bunch of cache clearing logic into it.\nNow all your QA builds would influence your real production servers.\nIn case this pattern doesn't fit well into your project (because nothing is a silver bullet), you are free to adjust the files produced by the template as you please.. That's what you have build for again. It just produces a set of files to serve, you don't need JS on server side to deal with them. It's only required on your build machine. I'm commonly using nginx to serve those files later, but you are free to use whatever solution you prefer. Github pages works just as well \ud83d\ude09 . ",

    "robertmain": "Have you tried mounted instead of created?\nAlso - what does this have to do with wechat?. I'm trying to use Vue to generate a nice portfolio page for me on github pages. I'm just getting a white page and the reason seems to be related to the fact that all the asset paths are wrong:\n\nSee how it's putting in robertmain.github.io/static/whatever.js and basically slicing the URL segment off the end of the URL. Basically it seems to happen if you're not running a vue app in a subdirectory.\nOne temporary hack that appears to fix it (in the .3 seconds I spent playing with it) is to remove assetsPublicPath in config/index.js so that it's just an empty string. Though, I don't know what knock-on effect that may have so.... >The other solution would be to use change it to /portfolio.\nYeah, I'm kind of (ab)using GitHub pages for the time being to host a professional portfolio. The problem with changing it to portfolio would be that it then wouldn't work on my local box. \n\nYou \"fixed\" it by changing it to an empty string, which essentially is the same as changing it to './' - a relative path.\n\nYeah, I bought this up because I wasn't sure if that was likely to screw with other things or if it was an okay thing to do without breaking things..\n\nBut since history mode doesn't work on github pages anyway,\n\nOh, it doesn't? Huh. TIL.\n\nSidenote: This doesn't really have anything to do with the topic of this issue - it's about other assets path problems.\n\nOh, sorry - I thought it was a manifestation of the same issue. That....kind of makes sense now that I think about it, yeah.. @LinusBorg what do you mean? I'm mounting the component with $mount() - also document wont't exist in that context (my unit test) surely?. OK - so it's still coming up as <!-- -->\nAre there some docs somewhere? I feel like I'm maybe missing something obvious.. Right, but in this case comp.$el is still just showing up as <!-- -->...like I said - are there docs?. Yeah, it is weird...\nBtw - vuejd.org is a non-existant domain - did you mean vuejs.org? :). I mention it because I haven't finished my second coffee yet and it took me a good 15 minutes to figure out why it didn't work :P. Either way - I'm not using vue-test-utils...just whatever comes bundled with this template...not sure if that's relevant.... Sure, thanks - repo is here: https://glow.dev.maio.me/impulse/dashboard/tree/sjohn/date-component. Whoops - try now. I committed and pushed\n. OK...so it looks like the test is the problem. My component works just fine in the browser.\nThis prints out the prop data(in this case hh:mm a:\n```js\nconst Constructor = Vue.extend(Clock);\nconst vm = new Constructor({\n    propsData: {\n        timeFormat: 'hh:mm a'\n    }\n}).$mount(document.createElement('div'));\n//eslint-disable-next-line\nconsole.error(vm.timeFormat);\n```\n...however - this:\n```js\nconst Constructor = Vue.extend(Clock);\nconst vm = new Constructor({\n        timeFormat: 'hh:mm a'\n}).$mount(document.createElement('div'));\n//eslint-disable-next-line\nconsole.error(vm.timeFormat);\n```\nJust prints out undefined\nAlso worth noting that if, in the first example - I do this:\n```js\nconst Constructor = Vue.extend(Clock);\nconst vm = new Constructor({\n    propsData: {\n        timeFormat: 'hh:mm a'\n    }\n}).$mount(document.createElement('div'));\n//eslint-disable-next-line\nconsole.error(vm.$el);\n```\nIt prints out <!-- --> ....meanwhile console.log(vm.$el.children) simply produces undefined. Tried that\n```js\nconst Constructor = Vue.extend(Clock);\nconst vm = new Constructor({\n    propsData: {\n        timeFormat: 'hh:mm a'\n    }\n}).$mount(document.createElement('div'));\nVue.nextTick(() => {\n    //eslint-disable-next-line\n    console.error(vm.$children);\n    expect(0).to.equal(0);\n    done();\n});\n```\nI get [] in my terminal. ...oh - I would've thought it would contain child elements...\nEither way - vm.$el is still showing as <!-- -->\nSurely I should have something showing up?. Ah, ok. I did commit the component and it's tests up earlier I think.\nEither way - I appreciate you doing this. I originally thought this was an issue with the testing config in the template...but it seems to be just my understanding of how to test Vue components :). Solved it in the end - ended up upgrading to the latest version of the template and using jest instead of mocha and chai.. Windows 10 user here chipping in. I find it works if I run npx jest but not npm run-script unit. To say I'm confused is an understatement.\nAdditionally, manually running the jest test/unit/specs --coverage command doesn't work. It seems to be interpreting the test/unit/specs as the pattern to search for unit test specs...which doesn't work for some reason. Remove that and it seems to at least find the test suites.. @eddyerburgh I doubt it will since that isn't where my test specs are\n@Akryum See below:\n```\n FAIL  test\\e2e\\specs\\test.js\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\nYour test suite must contain at least one test.\n\n  at node_modules/jest/node_modules/jest-cli/build/test_scheduler.js:95:22\n      at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\n      at Promise (<anonymous>)\n      at <anonymous>\n  at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\n\nPASS  test\\unit\\specs\\HelloWorld.spec.js\nTest Suites: 1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total\nTests:       1 passed, 1 total\nSnapshots:   0 total\nTime:        10.432s\nRan all test suites.\n-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|\nFile             |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines |Uncovered Lines |\n-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|\nAll files        |     7.69 |        0 |    33.33 |     12.5 |                |\n src             |        0 |        0 |        0 |        0 |                |\n  App.vue        |        0 |        0 |        0 |        0 |... 19,20,21,22 |\n src/components  |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                |\n  HelloWorld.vue |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                |\n-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\nnpm ERR! errno 1\nnpm ERR! test-jest@1.0.0 unit: jest --config test/unit/jest.conf.js --coverage\nnpm ERR!

Once Babel 7 lands, you can use a .babelrc.js file if you need to: https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/4892\nHere's a workaround for 6.x in the meantime.. Hmm, since babel-jest does its own .babelrc resolution, I wonder if the relative path is an issue. Try adding a temporary console.log to .babelrc.js to see if it's even being loaded during testing?. Hmm, looks like Jest only looks at env -> test under .babelrc, and even then using the .babelrc.js preset trick doesn't work.. Okay, I've figured it out.\n.babelrc:\njson\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"./.babelrc.js\"]\n  ],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"presets\": [\"./.babelrc.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n.babelrc.js:\njavascript\nmodule.exports = function () {\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {\n    return {\n      presets: ['env', 'stage-2']\n    }\n  } else {\n    return {\n      presets: [\n        ['env', {\n          modules: false\n        }],\n        'stage-2'\n      ],\n      plugins: ['transform-runtime']\n    }\n  }\n}\nI also ran jest with --no-cache (as recommended here) to make sure the transformation was fresh..

I also have some info that may help someone track this down or resolve; I posted them over at the Vue-Jest repo since I'm thinking that's where the fix will be.\nWork Around\nPlace the Jest configuration directly inside package.json following the vue test utils jest-example. If you need any type of dynamic config obviously this won't be very helpful, but maybe it'll help someone.\n. ",

It took a little trial and error to get the right command (I'm on a Windows machine) but eventually $env:NODE_ENV=\"development\" worked. Thank you for your help.. Okay, makes sense. I will remove the global env variable and figure out how to set the process env variable instead. Essentially, my problem is described in issue #535 but in reverse. When I have some time I'll see if I can find some answers in that thread. Or maybe I need to add something like cross-env.

I can reproduce the above behaviour only with a package-local install of vue-cli to node_modules/.bin/vue.\nAs such, the problem is probably not, after all, related to this template in particular, but to vue-cli.

I replaced ETWP with Mini-CSS-Extract-Plugin with fairly minimal changes.\n\nI removed the ETWP code from build/utils.js completely (I faced similar problems as @jjyyxx)\nI added optimization config to webpack.base.conf.js:\n\njs\noptimization: {\n    minimize: false,\n    runtimeChunk: {\n        name: 'vendor'\n    },\n    splitChunks: {\n        cacheGroups: {\n            default: false,\n            commons: {\n                test: /node_modules/,\n                name: \"vendor\",\n                chunks: \"initial\",\n                minSize: 1\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n3. I replaced ExtractTextPlugin with MiniCSSExtractPlugin in webpack.prod.conf.js:\n```js\nconst MiniCSSExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin'); // import\n// added optimization.minimize: true to settings\noptimization: {\n    minimize: true\n}\n// changed new ExtractTextPlugin({ to new MiniCSSExtractPlugin({ with the exact same param {filename: utils.assetsPath('css/[name].[contenthash].css')} passed as an argument.\n```\n\nRemoved all CommonsChunkPlugin code.\n\nI have changed the build process in my project quite a bit since I used this template, so there may be some differences. I also was seeing two deprecation warnings that I wasn't able to track down, but didn't seem to have any detrimental effect:\n(node:37161) DeprecationWarning: Tapable.plugin is deprecated. Use new API on `.hooks` instead\n(node:37161) DeprecationWarning: Tapable.apply is deprecated. Call apply on the plugin directly instead\nHopefully this helps.\nEdit: I also added mode: 'development' (and cache: true) to the webpack.dev.conf.js file to re-enable incremental compilation and mode: 'production' to webpack.prod.conf.js.. @jjyyxx I set it to always return with the vue-style-loader:\n```js\nfunction generateLoaders(loader, loaderOptions) {\n    const loaders = [cssLoader];\nif (loader) {\n    loaders.push({\n        loader: `${loader}-loader`,\n        options: {\n            ...loaderOptions,\n            sourceMap: options.sourceMap\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nreturn ['vue-style-loader'].concat(loaders);\n\n}\n```\nIt looks like in the code you showed, if options.extract is true, nothing is returned, which doesn't seem to be what you want.. @jjyyxx I wasn't a huge fan of that either, but it wasn't worth it to me to figure out the fix (especially for my usecase, where a single version of an application is being installed in isolation, so I get little benefit out of caching files separately). I'm not even sure there is a good solution (yet).\n@kinsomicrote I believe the errors are coming from the plugins being used. Apparently WebPack 4 is backwards compatible with WebPack 3 plugins, which are where the deprecation warnings are coming from. I saw html-webpack-plugin fixed an issue with that exact deprecation warning in I believe 3.0.6, although I imagine it will take some time for all the plugins used to be fully updated for WebPack 4.. Are you importing the webpack script provided?\njs\n// import PDFJS from 'pdfjs-dist'; // not for webpack\n// import PDFJS from 'pdfjs-dist/webpack'; // webpack script that properly includes worker. Is this debug code?. ",
    "jjyyxx": "It seems the maintainer of ETWP decided to deprecate this plugin on webpack >= v4.0.0 and recommend mini-css-extract-plugin instead. Many issues related to ETWP 4 (with prefix 4.0.0-beta.0) is closed with that notification. Maybe we should consider mini-css-extract-plugin?. The mini-css-extract-plugin, from my perspective, is quite simple with only two options filename and chunkFilename. As the maintainer of ETWP claims, if you only use ETWP to extract css, migration should be very simple. I didn't have time to try the migration out, but I believe it would not be tricky if this template uses ETWP to extract css only.. I just tried updating all the deps to webpack 4 compatible version, and altered the config a bit but UNFORTUNATELY faced with numerous errors :-( \nThe previous build/utils.js calling ExtractTextPlugin.extract is a tricky part to me. I doesn't have sufficient knowledge on how the function works and simply copied related code from ExtractTextPlugin.extract, together with other related code and made a few necessary changes such as changing ExtractTextPlugin.loader to MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader.

So currently CSS has to be bundled within the JS files?\nIn addition, updating other devDeps to newest version, I did not see the DeprecationWarning.. @dak Thanks for your help. It currently works. However, without extracting css leads to no minification (remove comments, etc) of the css declarations, increasing my bundle size by 500kb. \nMy case might be special but I think extraction is necessary for part of the users. Maybe someone could solve this.. https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/1205\nvue-cli is currently at beta.9. So the official template may come out soon.. @noamkfir \nI'm sorry to report some issues of the template. This may not connect directly with your template, instead, connect with those plugins, but I'm seeking for your help (and anyone's, of course).\nThe current template has severe memory leak in dev mode. The memory keeps going up every time the dev server recompiled the files. Since my project is relatively big, the memory quickly exceeds the heap after around 10 compilation and exits with code 134.\nI did memory dump with chrome-devtool's node debug feature. Four snapshots are taken after four minimum recompilation (remove a statement/add it back).\n\nI have saved those snapshots. If you think it necessary and would like to analyze it, you can download it from google drive and load it from chrome-devtool.\nsnapshot 1\nsnapshot 2\nsnapshot 3\nsnapshot 4\nIf you need any further information, I'm glad to provide.\nBTW, I updated the devDependencies to newest:\njavascript\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^8.5.0\",\n    \"babel-core\": \"^6.26.3\",\n    \"babel-eslint\": \"^8.2.3\",\n    \"babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props\": \"^2.0.3\",\n    \"babel-loader\": \"^7.1.4\",\n    \"babel-plugin-syntax-jsx\": \"^6.18.0\",\n    \"babel-plugin-transform-runtime\": \"^6.23.0\",\n    \"babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx\": \"^3.7.0\",\n    \"babel-preset-env\": \"^1.7.0\",\n    \"babel-preset-stage-2\": \"^6.24.1\",\n    \"chalk\": \"^2.4.1\",\n    \"copy-webpack-plugin\": \"^4.5.1\",\n    \"css-loader\": \"^0.28.11\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^4.19.1\",\n    \"eslint-config-standard\": \"^11.0.0\",\n    \"eslint-friendly-formatter\": \"^4.0.1\",\n    \"eslint-loader\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"eslint-plugin-import\": \"^2.12.0\",\n    \"eslint-plugin-node\": \"^6.0.1\",\n    \"eslint-plugin-promise\": \"^3.7.0\",\n    \"eslint-plugin-standard\": \"^3.1.0\",\n    \"eslint-plugin-vue\": \"^4.5.0\",\n    \"file-loader\": \"^1.1.11\",\n    \"friendly-errors-webpack-plugin\": \"^1.7.0\",\n    \"html-webpack-plugin\": \"^3.2.0\",\n    \"mini-css-extract-plugin\": \"0.4.0\",\n    \"node-notifier\": \"^5.2.1\",\n    \"optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin\": \"^4.0.1\",\n    \"ora\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"portfinder\": \"^1.0.13\",\n    \"postcss-import\": \"^11.1.0\",\n    \"postcss-loader\": \"^2.1.5\",\n    \"postcss-url\": \"^7.3.2\",\n    \"rimraf\": \"^2.6.2\",\n    \"semver\": \"^5.5.0\",\n    \"shelljs\": \"^0.8.2\",\n    \"uglifyjs-webpack-plugin\": \"^1.2.5\",\n    \"url-loader\": \"^1.0.1\",\n    \"vue-loader\": \"^15.2.0\",\n    \"vue-style-loader\": \"^4.1.0\",\n    \"vue-template-compiler\": \"^2.5.16\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^4.8.3\",\n    \"webpack-bundle-analyzer\": \"^2.13.1\",\n    \"webpack-cli\": \"2.1.4\",\n    \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^3.1.4\",\n    \"webpack-merge\": \"^4.1.2\"\n  }\n}. Thanks for your reference! Actually I have seen that issue.\nWhat surprised me was that I configured a similar vue-webpack4 project recently and didn't encounter memory leaks (at least, wasn't aware of memory leaks). I switched to this template mainly because my own template has a strange bug when configuring dev-server and copy-webpack-plugin (contentbase to be more specific). This template solved my problem but led to a new one...\nThe differences between my configuration and this one are quite small. Maybe a specific option triggered the problem.. @ChadTaljaardt \nI investigated the previous configuration, and found that replacing the lines in webpack.dev.conf.js\nrules: utils.styleLoaders({ sourceMap: config.dev.cssSourceMap, usePostCSS: true })\nto\nrules: [\n  {\n    test: /\\.css$/,\n    use: [\n      'vue-style-loader',\n      'css-loader'\n    ]\n  }\n]\nsignificantly eased the leak. I know it isn't a fix as it drops support for css dialects, but it turned out that something went wrong in the styleLoaders function or the relating loaders.\nThe mem dump:\n\nDescription: Between Row 1 ~ Row 5, one minimum recompilation each time. Between Row 5 and Row 6, invoke a GC operation. So, it seems that other minor leaks exist, but it isn't so severe.\nI would be appreciated if anyone can trace into the styleLoaders and locate the problem.\n. In complement, the return value of \njavascript\nutils.styleLoaders({ sourceMap: config.dev.cssSourceMap, usePostCSS: true })\nis\njavascript\n[\n    {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use:\n            ['vue-style-loader',\n                {loader: 'css-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'postcss-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}}]\n    },\n    {\n        test: /\\.postcss$/,\n        use:\n            ['vue-style-loader',\n                {loader: 'css-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'postcss-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}}]\n    },\n    {\n        test: /\\.less$/,\n        use:\n            ['vue-style-loader',\n                {loader: 'css-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'postcss-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'less-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}}]\n    },\n    {\n        test: /\\.sass$/,\n        use:\n            ['vue-style-loader',\n                {loader: 'css-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'postcss-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {\n                    loader: 'sass-loader',\n                    options: {indentedSyntax: true, sourceMap: true}\n                }]\n    },\n    {\n        test: /\\.scss$/,\n        use:\n            ['vue-style-loader',\n                {loader: 'css-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'postcss-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'sass-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}}]\n    },\n    {\n        test: /\\.stylus$/,\n        use:\n            ['vue-style-loader',\n                {loader: 'css-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'postcss-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'stylus-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}}]\n    },\n    {\n        test: /\\.styl$/,\n        use:\n            ['vue-style-loader',\n                {loader: 'css-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'postcss-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}},\n                {loader: 'stylus-loader', options: {sourceMap: true}}]\n    }\n]\nI did not use any css dialect so maybe it's something related to postcss-loader?. With so many plugins, tracing the root of the leak is really tricky.\nThanks for your efforts anyway @noamkfir. Hope this problem can be solved soon.. ",

    "noamkfir": "The build for my PR (#1369) is failing. I have a pretty good idea why, and I'd appreciate it if anybody familiar with CircleCI or permissions to manage the official build on CircleCI could take a quick look.\nThe details are here: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/pull/1369#issuecomment-385192951.\nUpdate: the build is no longer failing. Yay.. I'm trying to get the build to pass. I noticed that the chromedriver being used for the e2e tests is 2.35, which is apparently installed by the image in /usr/bin/chromedriver. It should be using 2.38, which is specified in package.json and located in node_modules.\nThe Dockerfile used for the build tries to install the latest chromedriver, which should be 2.38, but either the script isn't working properly, some cache (maybe CircleCI's?) is returning the older version, or the chromedriver is preinstalled and the script is failing to overwrite it.\nI'm trying to configure a build that is identical to the current build, except that it does not try to install the global chromedriver, by commenting out just the chromedriver installation command. Turns out it's pretty complicated to get that set up and running. I'm working on it, but if anybody knows a faster way to get CircleCI to use a slightly different Dockerfile, I would be obliged :).. # Finally got the build to pass!\nThis mainly involved replacing the prebuilt CircleCI image with a custom image generated using a fork of CircleCI's dockerfile-wizard.\nThe custom image is currently necessary because the prebuilt images install chromedriver globally. For some reason, they install 2.35 instead of 2.38 (not sure why...). The global executable takes precedence over node_modules, causing the build to fail. I think my solution is better: I got rid of the global chromedriver installation altogether. package.json is now the single source of truth for the chromedriver version.\nI also had to add the --headless arg to the chromeOptions property in nightwatch.json, as well as make a few other tweaks. Took me a while to figure out why the container couldn't launch Chrome, and Chrome's and chromedriver's inane error messages weren't very helpful. It was a combination of the browser, webdriver, selenium, and nightwatch versions, each with their own quirks and breaking changes.\nI created a logs folder that the webdrivers write to. CircleCI collects those logs and puts them on the Artifacts tab after a build. Really helps figure out what's going on.\nI'm not sure if this was necessary, but I upgraded to the latest Node 6 image that CircleCI explicitly supports - 6.14.1. I'm guessing Node 8 (and maybe even 10) should work, but I'm not sure why it was downgraded to 6 and didn't want to screw things up now that it finally works.... @ChadTaljaardt, following up on @gkatsanos's review, I noticed that the vendor chunk does not preserve its chunkhash, so the PR probably shouldn't be merged just yet.\nI've fixed it and will try to push the update in the next day or two.. This update:\n simplifies the config by resorting to some default and recommended webpack 4 settings\n unifies the file and chunk naming strategies for js and css files for easier debugging and improved long-term caching\n* stabilizes the chunk hashes, mainly to prevent generating a new chunk hash for the vendor chunk when only app code is modified, but applied generally\nIf all is well, this should hopefully remove any remaining obstacles to merging.. @jjyyxx I was able to reproduce the leak very easily, so I dug into it a bit and I'm pretty sure this isn't related to my changes.\nBasically, I discovered that the leak also occurs in the released version of the template. As far as I can tell, it's the exact same leak, almost certainly the one that @ChadTaljaardt referenced: webpack/webpack#6929.\nI don't think it's the postcss-loader plugin because removing it does not seem to prevent the leak, but I can't rule it out either yet. It's entirely possible that a number of plugins are incorrectly retaining references to the Compilation and/or CachedSource objects between builds.\nI tried to replace module.rules as you suggested and this also didn't seem to prevent the leak. I'm not sure why I'm getting different results than you are but I tried a number of different approaches and still wasn't able to reproduce the improvement.\nOne thing I found interesting was that there's a difference in the memory profile between webpack-dev-server and webpack. It's not completely deterministic, but webpack seems to leak less and more predictably. This is true for both dev and prod modes.. Thanks @miaulightouch! I've merged your PR into mine.. Sorry about the delay. Been a bit busy. I've merged @miaulightouch's PR.. @jacobg and @Dylan-Chapman This PR does not include the PWA support added in Vue CLI 3. In fact, I'm not really sure how the new CLI will affect this project. As I see it, the new CLI is more of a paradigm shift than a rewrite. Someone with more experience than I have will have to weigh in on whether this project is even relevant for CLI 3 projects.\nThis PR essentially updates webpack and vue-loader. It's a pretty big PR because so many packages had to be updated, underlying behavioral changes accommodated, and configurations reconfigured, but a lot of effort was made to avoid changing surface behavior.. Thank for looking over the code @gkatsanos!\nAre you sure, though? The readme says both filename and chunkFilename are optional. And the webpack docs say:\n\nBy default [id].js is used or a value inferred from output.filename ([name] is replaced with [id] or [id]. is prepended)\n\nI'm assuming it's inferred from filename in this case, but haven't verified.\nIf it does break that way, how would I repro this effectively? I'd probably need more than just a long CSS file to test, right?\nIn any case, I was trying to mirror the configuration used for the extract-text-webpack-plugin, and this combination seemed to produce correct results (eyeballed). It's possible we need to reconsider the default settings.. @gkatsanos, they seem to work well on my machine... The CSS file in dist is minified and when I click a selector, Chrome opens the .vue file and highlights the proper line.\nCan you point me to something specific so I can verify?. @afontcu, I think it should stay, but I'm not really sure.\nVue is very new for me, so I don't know how every setting affects the build or the app. I only made changes I felt certain were equivalent to the previous behavior or completely redundant, mainly by following Vue's migration guide, reading docs, and trial and error.\nFor example, I got rid of the loaders property because the new vue-loader explicitly deprecates it in favor of the the webpack loaders configuration. And I renamed the transformToRequire property to transformAssetUrls, based on the guide.\nMy hunch is that it should probably stay for the sake of clarity, even though the usage has changed a bit.\nHaving said that, I haven't checked if the cacheBusting property is used anywhere, and I'm not sure if we should add other properties that are relevant for the new vue-loader.. @gkatsanos Finally found some time to take another look at this. I have to say, you sent me down the rabbit hole with this one...\nFirst of all, I was able to determine relatively quickly that if filename is specified and chunkFilename is not, webpack uses filename by default.\nSecond, I'm pretty sure we don't need [contenthash], which was used by the extract-text-webpack-plugin. The [chunkhash] is probably more suitable for our purposes anyway.\nHowever, that's not the end of the story. Turns out that regardless of the naming strategy used here, the current configuration may generate a new chunkhash for the vendor chunk for any change in the code, even if it is not in node_modules. This is probably a blocker.\nI did a bit of research and played around with different variations of filename and chunkFilename for both output and the MiniCssExtractPlugin using different combinations of placeholders ([name], [id], [contenthash] and [chunkhash]). I also tested with and without explicitly named chunks in dynamic imports for routing (e.g., const SampleComponent = () => import(/* webpackChunkName: \"sample\" */ '@/components/SampleComponent'), which imports a SampleComponent.vue file). And I fiddled quite a bit with the optimization settings.\nThe bottom line is that I've solved it. I have to clean it up a bit, so I hope to push it in the next day or two.. The paths object is not debug code. I intentionally collected all the paths for readability and to simplify the configuration.\nThe console.log is debug code and is extremely useful when trying to figure out why the webdrivers aren't loading.\nI just pushed a small update (ad1999d) that:\n adds a debugTests constant to nightwatch.conf.js\n logs the paths object when it's true\n* sets the nightwatch config object's silent property to !debugTests\nI also cleaned up the file a bit.. I'm not entirely sure if webpack-cli is required, but all the migration guides I looked at said to install it. The CLI code was split out from webpack in v4 and I wasn't really sure how to check if the generator or the templates use any of its functionality anywhere. I had planned to look into it further, but never got around to it.. @zevdg Quoting @thatisuday (https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6647#issuecomment-395078260):\n\nenforce will force modules to split whether or not condition mentioned in splitChunks suitable to modules to split.\n\nIf I recall correctly, I added it to ensure consistent hashing, but I really don't remember the details and, in hindsight, that probably doesn't make much sense :(. I do remember that it took me way too long to solve whatever the problem was because, as you said, there was no documentation for enforce so I didn't know the option existed until I came across it by accident on some unrelated article.\nThe SplitChunksPlugin code basically uses it to arbitrarily set other parameters to default values that guarantee that the chunk will be created.. @PanJiaChen Thanks for the thorough review!\nI did a lot of experimentation before I added the NamedChunksPlugin because the HashedModuleIdsPlugin did not guarantee consistent hashing, especially of the vendor module.\nI found that almost every change I made to any import statement in my code could cause the vendor module hash to change. The NamedChunksPlugin uses the path instead of the arbitrary module id to calculate the hash, and this proved to be far more consistent.\nIt's definitely possible I missed something, or that the behavior improved since webpack 4.6 (it's now 4.16), but I hesitate to reopen this right now as changing this or upgrading to 4.16 might have further consequences. In any case, after this PR is approved, doing that kind of change is a much smaller and far more focused change.. \ud83d\udc4d . You're right about namedModules. I'm removing it.\nHowever, the docs for noEmitOnErrors seem to indicate that it does not have a default value, so I'm leaving it for now.. ",
