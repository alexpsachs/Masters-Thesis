Just merge once ready :)\n. @nataliq Sounds cool! \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'm guessing this is an alternative implementation to https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/59?\n. @spotify/objc-dev\n. Also planning to update the \"Getting Started Guide\" to use this API instead, since it's so much easier to get into and doesn't require modifying the navigation stack. Will do in a subsequent PR thou :)\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @Goos It's awesome that you're \"that guy\" \ud83d\ude04 We should always focus on a really high test coverage - but in this case it becomes pretty much impossible to unit test - since it relies on UIKit's internal hit testing mechanisms, that won't get triggered in a unit test \ud83d\ude22 \n. @mvlasieva Merge master into your branch, then I can merge :)\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @Goos Can this be closed, now that you have https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/89?\n. Awesome, thanks a lot @rob-brown! \ud83c\udf89 \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @Goos Addressed your comments. Want to take a second look? \ud83d\ude42\n. @Goos Fixed some bugs and added backwards compatibility with UITableViewCell and UICollectionViewCell. Mind taking another look just to make sure things still look good? \ud83d\ude01\n. Turns out @Goos is on vacation, so can anyone else from @spotify/objc-dev have a look please? \ud83d\ude04 \n. @krris Can't respond to your comment with your question (since GitHub has marked it as \"outdated\"). But the 0.2 value comes from experimenting and measuring how UIKit delays its highlighting & selection mechanisms, and finding a value that didn't make the UI feel slow, but yet avoided flashing of accidental highlights.\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev @cerihughes\n. @cerihughes The conflict is because of me (sorry!) \ud83d\ude1b I added a workaround for the static analyzer warning here: https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/87/commits/0550094089dc8e7dca5a936221bdae28008a45e8. But I like this approach better! So feel free to pick your implementation when rebasing \ud83d\ude04 \n. Wooops, accidental close \ud83d\ude22 \n. @Goos Can the do not merge label be removed, or does this require some manual verification?\n. @spotify/objc-dev\n@cerihughes This is the bug we encountered when writing TA tests today, when the component would be selected twice.\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. Awesome to see your first contribution @pepibumur! \ud83d\ude09\nInteresting idea! How would HUBFeature work, is it like a mutable configuration object, or do you set it up once with an initializer? (Agree that the name HUBFeatureRegistration sounds more like a token than an actual model object).\n. @pepibumur Hmmm what would be the benefit of creating the object and then passing it to a method vs just calling the method? Wouldn't that turn something which can be done in one line to something a bit more complex? I'm not opposed, just want to figure out if it will have some clear API benefits.\nRegarding the renaming of HUBFeatureRegistration into HUBFeature - all for that \ud83d\udc4d (although it's an internal object only - but always nice to have a clean house \ud83d\ude03)\n. @pepibumur Alright. That's a good point! So sounds like a good change \ud83d\udc4d Regarding naming, feel free to just replace the current registration method with registerFeature:, and create a HUBFeature class as part of the API. No need to use macros or migration, just full steam ahead! \ud83d\ude80 \n. Feel free to also use the demo app as a demonstration of this new API, think what you said about creating a FeatureFactory would be an awesome showcase of why this change is great \ud83d\udc4d \n. @pepibumur Wohooo! I'll try to get new t-shirts ordered ASAP! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\ude80 \n. @pepibumur No need to be sorry, take your time \ud83d\ude04 It's not a part of the code base that sees a lot of movement, so shouldn't be any problems to implement it whenever you have time \ud83d\ude04 \n. @cerihughes Ah got it, awesome! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @Goos @cerihughes Really awesome work guys! \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @Goos The thing is that the scroll view is not exposed as part of the API, so then we'd have to add an extra step where you convert your point from the view controller's coordinate system to the scroll view's internal coordinate system. Feels like an extra step. The use case that I've seen so far (using this in a gesture recognizer to hit test components) is translating from a container view controller's coordinate space into a component - which is nice if the framework handles for you \ud83d\ude04 \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @cerihughes Yeah exactly, basically in the Spotify app, we're calling this as part of handling a gesture recognizer, so need to have close to O(1) complexity to not hog the main tread \ud83d\ude04 \n. @Goos You think it's worth adding a test that makes sure this doesn't happen again? :)\n. @8W9aG Fixed the macro issue and added unit tests + CI. Wanna take a 2nd look? \ud83d\ude04 \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @goos You navigate \ud83d\ude80 \n. @Goos It probably does, because we can't make the assumption that the scrolling is both performed and observed in the same piece of code. That is, some logic in an app might cause the view to scroll, while the scroll handler for the current view is implemented in a totally different code base.\n. @rordulu The demo app needs to be updated with the new APIs in order for the build to succeed \ud83d\ude42 \n. @cerihughes I personally think we should get it in. It's better than what we have, and it lays some of the ground work for additional testing we want to do ASAP. So while we look into why the build doesn't report as failed when the test fail, I would say we should go ahead with this \ud83d\ude04 \n. @cerihughes One thing we should do before mering this though, is to add a linting rule for the license headers in the /tests folder of the demo app. See how I did it for the live editing code here: https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/118/commits/325fa1e365365e4db06b7213335513e70681ce2d\n. @cerihughes Need any assistance on this one? Would be happy to help \ud83d\ude04 \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. And huge kudos for those tests! Should probably make a bump in our test coverage! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @Goos You mean \"When scrolling programmatically\" right? \ud83e\udd14 \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @cerihughes Yeah it would probably be a good idea to move all code doing any diffing into HUBViewModelDiff. For now there's already quite an amout of \"diffing code\" (although very simple) in the view controller for overlay components - would love to refactor that - but let's do it in a separate PR \ud83d\ude04\n. @cerihughes With this we also have the tests in place to make sure that our future refactor won't break anything \ud83d\ude80 \n. @cerihughes Done! https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/issues/144\n. @rastersize Wouldn't we want it to crash if something went wrong and the expectation wasn't fulfilled? \ud83e\udd14 \n. @zhubofei Merge master into your branch (you can use the button \ud83d\udc47), then I'll merge this in as soon as it builds \ud83d\ude04 Thanks again! \ud83c\udf89 . @zhubofei Sorry but you'll have to merge master in again. You can select that the maintainers of the repo can edit your PR, which will make us able to merge master in (I think \ud83d\ude05). @zhubofei Wohoo \ud83c\udf89 . @zhubofei Now I'm going to be extremely picky, so forgive me \ud83d\ude05 But can you please fix the last commit message: \"nit\" doesn't say anything about what the commit contains. Something like \"Remove unwanted space\" or something would be a lot better. The reason I'm a bit picky about this, is because when bisecting the git history (or working with the log in another way), commit messages like this make it very hard to know what's going on \ud83d\ude04 Another option is for you to just squash your two commits together and force push onto this PR.\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. Mr @Goos you are one thorough reviewer! \ud83d\udc4d So awesome \ud83d\ude80 Will fix!\n. @spotify/objc-dev \n. @krris Added another test, and fixed a bug affecting the content inset calcuation when a header component is used. Wanna take a 2nd look? \ud83d\ude04 \n. @krris Could you make this PR only contain the \"valid\" fix, so we can merge it in? \ud83d\ude04 . @spotify/objc-dev . @cerihughes . @spotify/objc-dev . @lumenela had to move your code a bit, also made the test a bit more thorough, mind verifying that everything looks \u2705? \ud83d\ude04 . @spotify/objc-dev . YAY! Built on first run, gonna take that as a sign \ud83d\ude04 . Hopefully UI tests flakiness will be reduced by https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/187. Awesome @rastersize! \ud83d\ude80 . @spotify/objc-dev . @Goos You and me both! \ud83c\udf89 . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @cerihughes Good points, makes sense to do asserts earlier, so that it's easier to debug the tests if something goes wrong \ud83d\udc4d Will fix!. @spotify/objc-dev . A future commit could rename HUBComponentReusePool to HUBComponentManager.. @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @rastersize Great suggestions - will update the PR! \ud83d\ude80 . All the convenience initializers are now class constructors, and moved to a category \ud83d\ude80 The category is still in the same file as HUBManager.h/.m (so that users of the Hub Framework don't have to specify the -objc linking flag to get it).. Built and verified locally \u2705 . We cannot make the assumption that every app using the Hub Framework will want to have this keyboard behavior. What's wrong with implementing it in the component - isn't that a lot more explicit, and leaves more control to the app?. @Lumenela Sure, you can ask the component layout manager from the view controller \ud83d\udc4d . @Lumenela Any update on this? \ud83d\ude04 . @spotify/objc-dev @anantthebiker. @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . Awesome @mpluders! Looking great \ud83d\udc4d . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev The recommended way to review this is by reading the rendered markdown.. @cerihughes I love nitpicks \ud83c\udf89 Fixed!. Built and verified locally \u2705 . @mvlasieva Since Travis are currently undergoing an incident, I'm using my computer as our build server \ud83d\ude05 However, this PR doesn't pass the tests locally. Can you update the PR so that they do? \ud83d\ude42 . @Goos Awesome stuff! \ud83d\ude80 . \u2705 Built and verified locally. @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @krris Yeah, I'm gonna add some longer timeouts to it - I've seen this happen to other UI tests as well when run on Travis.. I'm not sure if this is such a good idea - it gives the scroll handler a bit too many responsibilities. Is there no way to perform these actions from a content operation or component instead?. @spotify/objc-dev . @rastersize Updated \ud83d\ude80 . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @Goos I think it'd be great if you reviewed this, since you've been working a lot on the scrolling behaviors \ud83d\ude04 . @Goos @nataliq Awesome idea! We should probably do that with more of our default classes \ud83d\udc4d . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev. @Goos Would rather not move around the code too much, to keep the impact small. It would be great to move all of the rendering-related code into HUBViewModelRenderer (it could keep its own operation queue even) in a subsequent PR though.. @spotify/objc-dev . That's an awesome suggestion @rastersize - will do that! Thanks! \ud83d\ude04 . Wait a second @rastersize, those images are hosted on your own server or something? Not sure if we can use that here \ud83d\ude05 . Merging this for now, and we can update to the thumbnails later once we've figured out where to host them.. Could the commit history be cleaned up a bit? Maybe squash all of them? \ud83d\ude07 . @spotify/objc-dev . Very nice additions @rastersize! \ud83d\udc4d . @Goos @rastersize @8W9aG \ud83d\udc4b .

It would be great to move all of the rendering-related code into HUBViewModelRenderer (it could keep its own operation queue even) in a subsequent PR though.. @spotify/objc-dev . That's an awesome suggestion @rastersize - will do that! Thanks! \ud83d\ude04 . Wait a second @rastersize, those images are hosted on your own server or something? Not sure if we can use that here \ud83d\ude05 . Merging this for now, and we can update to the thumbnails later once we've figured out where to host them.. Could the commit history be cleaned up a bit? Maybe squash all of them? \ud83d\ude07 . @spotify/objc-dev . Very nice additions @rastersize! \ud83d\udc4d . @Goos @rastersize @8W9aG \ud83d\udc4b . ",

Idea; how about naming the class HUBAnonymousContentOperation? To me that name might work nice in both Objective-C and Swift while \u201cblock\u201d feels very Objective-C. What do you think @JohnSundell?. Hmm, this didn\u2019t fix the duplicate unit test run \ud83d\ude1e\nAt least it made Danger report both of them, hehe \ud83d\ude2c. This is ready for review @spotify/objc-dev\nIt should reduce time spent in CI as well as improve our flakiness situation.

Closing this PR in favor of #250 which takes @nataliq\u2019s commits and then also applies a final commit to fix the build error.. @8W9aG Updated to move the error domain constants to an implementation file making the declarations extern.. @nataliq You seem to have added the code in f0ace389785b1b62609be3c4a76a129b1b3eaba5. The commit says:\n\nForce update the content offset when content inset is set\nI\u2019ve found that sometimes when the content inset is set the content\noffset of the collection view is not updated for example when the view\nis not on the screen and is inside a child view controller..\n\nCould you make sure that that (:point_up:) problem isn\u2019t re-introduced with this PR?\nIf this doesn\u2019t introduce a regression I\u2019m ok with the change.

As such feel free to remove the \u201cdo not merge\u201d label once you\u2019ve verified this change.. How about extending this with some thumbnails?

Also the images I used are in an insane resolution (leading to about 1-2 MB for each) so need to resize them first as well :). This is blocked on https://github.com/KrauseFx/trainer needing to push v0.4.0 to ruby gems.

Unless we explicitly want to check that two objects are the same instance we should use XCTAssertEqualObjects(obj1, obj2, desc, \u2026).\nFurther I think we should, like you\u2019re doing here, use XCTAssertTrue() with a description (or comment) when we actually want to check for instance equality. I\u2019d also be fine with adding a function or macro like HUBAssertEqualInstances(ins1, ins2, desc, \u2026) to make the code more self-explanatory.. I\u2019ve made some tweaks and changes. I think it\u2019s good enough to merge in this state giving us, and others, something to expand on.. @marmelroy Thank you for the links and update, much appreciated! From reading the Alamofire discussions I think we should probably go with multiple targets. Like you\u2019ve done in this PR.. Had a quick look and looks good, I\u2019ll give it a proper review on Tuesday when I\u2019m back in the office. Thank you for the PR much appreciated!. @marmelroy We can add the linting later.

Go through the view hierarchy and look for a UIControl.. @mhallendal @marmelroy @mumme What do you think of this \u261d\ufe0f . @mumme @marmelroy I prefer this solution a lot to what Hub framework does and what was added in #283!

Oops, that's right \ud83d\ude2a \n. @JohnSundell the cause of the crash is related to the fix I did last week (https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/141) where the bounds-checking was changed as the view model child count might not align with the collection view's item count at all times. \nHowever, it seems like the numberOfItemsInSection: will actually trigger a call to the data source if the collection view hasn't done any prior item counts, potentially causing the collection view to report having more items than there are layout attributes for (as the UICollectionViewLayout is computed manually in combination with the reloading, which hasn't occurred yet). \nSo the crash would remain if frameForBodyComponentAtIndex: was called after the view model was updated but before the first rendering pass. \nYay UIKit \\o/\n.

More documentation coming up. @JohnSundell, @nataliq I'm kind of hesitant to move back scrolling behaviour to the view controller as it's way too large already. How about exposing the HUBDefaultScrollHandler as part of the interface for subclassing instead?. No worries, still approved :smile: \ud83d\udc4d . I'm not entirely familiar with the original issue, but wouldn't a more robust solution be to increase/decrease the content offset with the change in content inset? E.g. if the top content inset changes from 5 to 15, decrease the current content offset with 10. Or does the UICollectionView take care of that by itself?.

Looks like this is a known problem with codecov - see https://github.com/codecov/example-swift/issues/16\nSo, the question is, should we merge these tests, even though we're not sure if the build will still pass if they fail? i.e. can we merge this without https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/issues/127 being addressed?\n. @JohnSundell @rastersize Implemented the changes you requested.\nAlso, the test failures now seem to be reporting properly. I put in a breaking change, the tests failed and the build went red.\n. @Goos @krris @JohnSundell \n. \ud83c\udf89 Nice!\n. @JohnSundell Is this just a short-term solution / quick fix? Would a better / longer term solution be to consider headers and overlays in the existing diffing code and return diffed results for each component type?\n. @JohnSundell - Yeah, that makes sense. Let's create an issue to move all diffing code into the same place.\n. @JohnSundell @Goos \n. @rastersize : I copied your suggested changes into this PR. Look good?\n. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83c\udf33 . @JohnSundell - thanks for the comments! Updated.... @spotify/objc-dev master is currently \"broken\" (not compiling on 32bit). This fixes it.. @JohnSundell @rastersize . @rastersize Made the changes you suggested and also fixed the crash (I suspect it was caused by https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/234). @spotify/objc-dev. @Goos . @JohnSundell . Screwed up my branch trying to squash \ud83d\ude31 \nReplacing this with https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/270. Created https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/issues/266 to deal with the issue where the build fails without explanation. . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @JohnSundell : I would assume that by default we'd want to be checking object equality in tests, unless we have a requirement that something returns the same instance under certain conditions. Only then would we want to test the actual instances.\nThe NSIndexPath case is a good example - on some platforms (for some reason) calls to factory methods will return different instances, and on other platforms they return the same instance (I haven't verified this, but it's one explanation for what's happening). Ultimately though, it shouldn't matter, as long as we use object equality, not instance equality as isEqualTo: will take care of all the differences for us.\nOnly fixing the cases with NSIndexPath because we know there are problems with that right now seems a bit broken, as the same issue could arise with other classes in future OS releases (as an example).. @spotify/objc-dev . This looks good to me. I'm going to retrigger the builds a couple of times to make sure it kills the flakiness :). Hmmm. I'm seeing failures in SelectionUITests.testChildSelectionCancelledOnParentScrolling() now. I doubt that's related though... might be another instance of flakiness :sigh:. Replaced by https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/273. @mhallendal : Yeah. I manually reverted the travis change and just pushed this to master instead. Would you prefer I clean up the commit history?. @mhallendal : Actually, nvm... I already have a PR I can use without those commits..

Maybe there's a more suitable \"root\" object in Hubs that we could use (but I think these 2 are about as \"root\" as it gets).\nThis is much like client-ios where root objects like service/feature implementations generally access static singletons and inject them into all objects from that point (or at least, that's how I think it should be working).\nI don't think we should be exposing the application through the API as a HUBApplication either as that's confusing for users. Doing the above means we don't have to do this either. ... in other words, I don't think there should be any changes to the include APIs for this change. It should be purely an implementation change.. @krris : I'm struggling to see how injecting a HUBApplication is any easier than injecting a UIApplication. Is there something that doesn't work if we just use UIApplication?. Oh... is it because we don't have a mocking framework and so can't properly mock a UIApplication?. @krris Can we just subclass UIApplication for testing purposes (in the same way we do for HUBCollectionViewMock for example)?. We do have the option of subclassing NSObject instead of UIApplication and just mirroring the API that we use on that subclass.\nI'm all for writing code that's easy to test, but I think that needing changes to the public API just to be testable is a step too far.

Sorry for the delay in reviewing, but why doesn't visibleViewForComponentOfType:indexPath: just do\n- (nullable UIView *)visibleViewForComponentOfType:(HUBComponentType)componentType indexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath\n{\n    return [self visibleComponentViewsForComponentType:componentType][indexPath];\n}\n... maybe with a nil check at the end?\n.

I should have read the PR description!\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @rastersize @JohnSundell @nataliq UI Tests are now passing, but there's a problem with code coverage which may be the reason why failures are not reported. Looks like this is a known problem with codecov - see https://github.com/codecov/example-swift/issues/16\nSo, the question is, should we merge these tests, even though we're not sure if the build will still pass if they fail? i.e. can we merge this without https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/issues/127 being addressed?\n. @JohnSundell @rastersize Implemented the changes you requested.\nAlso, the test failures now seem to be reporting properly. I put in a breaking change, the tests failed and the build went red.\n. @Goos @krris @JohnSundell \n. \ud83c\udf89 Nice!\n. @JohnSundell Is this just a short-term solution / quick fix? Would a better / longer term solution be to consider headers and overlays in the existing diffing code and return diffed results for each component type?\n. @JohnSundell - Yeah, that makes sense. Let's create an issue to move all diffing code into the same place.\n. @JohnSundell @Goos \n. @rastersize : I copied your suggested changes into this PR. Look good?\n. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83c\udf33 . @JohnSundell - thanks for the comments! Updated.... @spotify/objc-dev master is currently \"broken\" (not compiling on 32bit).

Screwed up my branch trying to squash \ud83d\ude31 \nReplacing this with https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/270. Created https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/issues/266 to deal with the issue where the build fails without explanation. . @spotify/objc-dev . @spotify/objc-dev . @JohnSundell : I would assume that by default we'd want to be checking object equality in tests, unless we have a requirement that something returns the same instance under certain conditions. Only then would we want to test the actual instances.\nThe NSIndexPath case is a good example - on some platforms (for some reason) calls to factory methods will return different instances, and on other platforms they return the same instance (I haven't verified this, but it's one explanation for what's happening). Ultimately though, it shouldn't matter, as long as we use object equality, not instance equality as isEqualTo: will take care of all the differences for us.\nOnly fixing the cases with NSIndexPath because we know there are problems with that right now seems a bit broken, as the same issue could arise with other classes in future OS releases (as an example).. @spotify/objc-dev . This looks good to me. I'm going to retrigger the builds a couple of times to make sure it kills the flakiness :). Hmmm. I'm seeing failures in SelectionUITests.testChildSelectionCancelledOnParentScrolling() now. I doubt that's related though... might be another instance of flakiness :sigh:.

Thanks for the feedback.\nA universal framework is much easier to maintain and that's a huge plus. The main technical argument against a universal framework was that Carthage couldn't build it but that's no longer the case. \nSee these for context:\nhttps://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/326\nhttps://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/1064\nAny other argument we should consider in favour of a platform-specific framework? \nAn additional difference with @JohnSundell's implementation is that I added an explicit HubComponentWithFocusState protocol whereas John merged focus state with highlighted state. \nI will update the PR with the changes requested by @rastersize and @cerihughes and will steal a couple of ideas from @JohnSundell's branch \ud83d\ude04. Sorry for the delay in fixing this - moving countries is quite time exhaustive. This PR should be ready for another review (cc @cerihughes, @rastersize ). \nSummary of changes:\n- Syntax was improved as per @cerihughes request. \n- Change requested re unsigned enums was applied framework-wide. \n- Change requested re configuration overrides was due to duplication of the dynamic target on production. Overrides were removed from both iOS and tvOS targets.\n- The test target was improved a little. \nNote:\ntestScrollingToBottomOfViewLoadsPaginatedContent was being flaky. I improved the log we get when it fails. We should monitor the issue. . Thanks @rastersize. Good catch. . @cerihughes, just got around to adding a simple test that covers all the cases. Let me know your thoughts. . \ud83c\udf89  shipit. This PR is deliberately failing to test Danger. \nI was able to improve Danger error reporting but CI logs are still being swallowed up by Fastlane. Trying to figure out a solution. . \ud83d\udc4d \nMakes sense. . I was intrigued by the fact that we were traversing the view hierarchy looking for specific subclasses and created an alternative PR - https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/pull/285. @mumme, did a little investigation and it appears that the reason this doesn't work is that UISegementedControl doesn't implement any gesture recognisers and captures touches directly (thanks Apple).  . Strange that it's only causing a bug with Xcode 8.3 beta 2. @rastersize mentioned potential issues with apps importing as a module (e.g. Swift apps) and this kind of set up. Will run additional tests tomorrow. Don't merge yet. . @rastersize is right, this is not working as well as I hoped. . +1. +1. I like the sound of HUBViewController as a @protocol again. Something to consider for 3.0.0? . @krris, I did. HUBComponentContentOffsetObserver reports the content offset to components so that they can update themselves but I want to observe the contentOffset externally.. Small issue: adding a new method in the scroll handler protocol is technically a breaking change as it requires updating all classes that conform to the protocol.\nI did consider making it an optional method but the fact that the scroll handler is of an \"id\" type and doesn't inherit from NSObject means I can't check if the the delegate responds to the optional selector. . @rastersize, can't wait :). @cerihughes, please see my comment on https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework/issues/264.
