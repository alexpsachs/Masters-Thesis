Disable NAT Traversal and Dynamic DNS functions on the configuration file of SoftEther VPN Server.\n. bool DisableNatTraversal false -> true\n. 1. If you are using VPN Client, you can use your own DHCP server to assign static IP addresses to each computer, by using unique virtual MAC addresses of VPN clients.\n2. You can also define access-list entries on the Virtual Hub. An entry can have the username field as the matching condition. Then you can allow the specific access to the specific user.\n. You can force the user to use DHCP-assigned IP address by enabling the Enforce DHCP Allocated IP Addresses (IPv4) policy.\n. You can hide these information by modifying the CreateNodeInfo() function on the https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/Cedar/Protocol.c source code.\n. Hi,\nYou can build from the source code with \"make DEBUG=YES\" command.\nAfter that, you can debug the running process of vpnserver by using gdb to analyze the cause of the hang-up.\n. Hi tonychung00,\nI am a developer of SoftEther VPN. I really want to solve this reported hang problem during the shutdown, however, I have not succeeded to reproduce the problem in our environment with CentOS 6.5.\nSo I suppose this problem depends on the environment.\nTo reproduce the problem in my environment, I need your information.\n1. The problem always (or high-rate) occurs during \"vpnserver stop\" ?\n2. I need the results of following commands.\n   uname \u2013 a\n   cat /etc/rc.local\n   sysctl \u2013 a\n   ifconfig \u2013 a\n   gcc \u2013 version\n   dmesg\n3.

The URL can be accessed by only us, so the pasting the URL is safe.\nYour cooperation is much appreciated.\n. Hi tonychung00,\nI set up the same environment and have tried to reproduce your hang-up problem of vpnserver process, however I have failed to reproduce the problem.\nIf you don't mind, could you please let me log in to your actual server via ssh to analyze the problem?\nIf ok, please upload the text file how to log in to your actual server via the following HTTPS uploader.\nhttps://www.softether-upload.com/ PIN: 8931\nMake sure to choose the \"Private Mode\" when you sent a file.\nAfter uploaded, post the result URL on this forum.

Hi everyone,\nFinally I found a tiny bug in the code which causes the dead lock in the shutting down process of vpnserver.\nI will release the fixed version in a few days.\nI thank your appreciation very much.\n. Hi,\nSorry I have no idea about uclibc.\nThe \"String Library Init Failed\" error is very rare. This occurs when mbstowcs() or wcstombs() with Unicode strings does not work correctly. mbstowcs() and wcstombs() are standard C library functions. Thus I suppose that these string functions in the uclibc has a problem.\n.

Yes, you can enable the multiple tunnel connection, and set the \"Set Connection Lifetime of Each TCP Connection\" option in the advanced setting to enforce the VPN tunnel to negotiate the key every hour (or specified time peroid).\n. Please mind that the access list entry you inserted is applied for both bi-directional packets. You should specify the TCP flag (established or unestablished) on a TCP-based entry, or specify the source or the destination username.\n. Please see the tutorials at http://www.softether.org/.\n. We are considering to implement the certificate authenticaion on OpenVPN protocol in recent future.\n. Sorry, but I couldn't reproduce your problem.\nPlease make sure that you certainly installed the latest version of SoftEther VPN Client with VPN Gate Plugin from http://www.vpngate.net/en/download.aspx web page.\n. Check whether there is both \"VpnGatePlugin_x64.dll\" and \"VpnGatePlugin_x86.dll\" files on the directory same to \"vpnclient.exe\" or \"vpnclient_x64.exe\".\nIf there are no such .dll files, it means that \"SoftEther VPN Client with VPN Gate Plugin\" has not installed correctly.

DO NOT USE IT IN OTHER COUNTRIES.\" in the readme file is just our statement for warning and disclaimer. This is not a restriction under the license. Since SoftEther VPN has been licensed under GPLv2, we do not impose any additional restrictions which have contradiction with the license. We must put our disclaimer, otherwise we have a risk to be sued or sentenced by any court of any country in the rest of the world. In order to avoid or eliminate such a risk, we have put this \"USE ONLY IN JAPAN\" statement in the readme file.\nHowever, we are planning to replace this disclaimer statement to reflect our clear intention in the next update of the source code. The new statement will be as the following:\nUse only in Japan. Do not use this software in another country unless you have a confirmation that this software does not violate any criminal laws or civil rights in that particular country. Using this software in other countries is completely at your own risk. The SoftEther VPN Project has developed and distributed this software to comply only with the Japanese laws and existing civil rights including patents which are subjects apply in Japan. Other countries' laws or civil rights are none of our concerns nor responsibilities.

Even if you will be sued by a private entity or be damaged by a public servant in your country, the developers of this software will never be liable to recover or compensate such damages, criminal or civil responsibilities. Note that this line is not license restriction but just a statement for warning and disclaimer.\nThanks.\n. 1.0.0.1 is the dummy value during the PPP phase. It is ignored by Windows, Mac, iOS and Android L2TP/IPsec client, and causes no problem.\n. I think so, too.\n. Thank you for your suggestion.\nI cannot assure that your suggestion will be implemented by me in recent future. Currently I have no plan to implement that function.\nHowever, anyone can add such the function you want to SoftEther VPN Server, since SoftEther VPN is an academic open-source project.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/\nThere are several contributors for SoftEther VPN Server since the project began, as listed on the https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/graphs/contributors contributors page.\nIf you strongly need your requesting feature, you have three options:\n1.

Thank you so much for your contribution to enrich the SoftEther VPN source code.\nYour patch has been merged on the main source-tree of SoftEther VPN.\nAs a token of our gratitude, your GitHub username has been added on the AUTHORS.TXT file and on the header of the related source file.\nPlease see: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/AUTHORS.TXT\nThanks again for your contribution.\n. I suppose that this is not a bug of either SoftEther VPN or OpenVPN. Perhaps the --enable-small flag removes the IP address assignment codes for TUN devices. It may be by the design, for the purpose to eliminate the code size.\n. For analyze the issue, could you please copy and paste VPN Server log records which include the string \"Option Strings Received:\" ?\nPlease include patterns of both successful connection (without --enable-small) and failure connection (with --enable-small) from your router BOX.\n. The actual logs will help you understand the issue.\nMy analysis at the present time is that this is a problem of the client side, not one of the server side.\nSoftEther VPN Server always pushes the IP address and the routing information if the OpenVPN Client requests the connection to the VPN Server with the \"dev-type tun\" option string in the initialization phase.\nSoftEther VPN Server suppresses the IP routing options only if there are no \"dev-type tun\" option string from the OpenVPN Client.\nYou should make sure that your OpenVPN Client with the --enable-small option requests the connection toward the VPN Server with the \"dev-type tun\" option.\n. I read the options.c file in the OpenVPN source code. According to the source code, if there is no ENABLE_OCC definition in the compiling time, then it will make the OpenVPN Client forget to push the \"dev-type tun|tap\" option string toward the server.\nThe \"dev-type tun\" option string is essential to accept the connections from OpenVPN Client on the SoftEther VPN Server's side. Unlike traditional VPN software, SoftEther VPN Server supports both of the \"tun\" mode and the \"tap\" mode in a single VPN Server. Therefore, SoftEther VPN Server must determine the mode either \"tun\" or \"tap\" when a new VPN connection requests to establish a session. That is the reason why the \"dev-type tun\" option string is indispensable. Without the \"dev-type tun\" option string, SoftEther VPN Server assumes that it is a tap (layer-2) VPN session. Then no IP routing options will be pushed to the client. Moreover, without the ENABLE_OCC definition, OpenVPN Client cannot request the cipher algorithm to the VPN Server, and the VPN Server cannot determine the appropriate algorithm for the VPN client.\nFor these reasons, correct and appropriate option strings in the connecting time from the OpenVPN Client is essential to be accepted by SoftEther VPN Server. You should manually specify the \"ENABLE_OCC\" option when compiling OpenVPN Client, or request to your preferred distributor to enable the \"ENABLE_OCC\" flag.\n. Thank you for your testing.\nThe problem is that the option strings from the client side is incomplete.\nAs long as the option string is incomplete, SoftEther VPN Server cannot negotiate with the client to determine the tunnel type and the cipher algorithm.\nThis not a bug of SoftEther VPN Server.\n. This is not a security bug. The manner that the client side firstly suggests the parameters and the server side determines to accept or not the request is a traditional way in secure protocols including IPsec/ISAKMP, TLS and others.\nIf you have an opinion that it is a security bug please show the example of the security issue.\n. Thanks for good idea.\nOK, I am planning to add the \"default OpenVPN option string\" on the vpn_server configuration file.\nFor example, an administrator will be able to specify:\nstring DefaultOpenVPNOptionString V4,dev-type tun,link-mtu 1500,tun-mtu 1500, cipher AES-128-CBC,auth SHA1,keysize 128,key-method 2,tls-client\nThen the small-sized OpenVPN client w/o ENABLE_OCC will make a connection to a SoftEther VPN Server.\nThe default option will be same to the above on all VPN Gate servers (which are based of SoftEther VPN Server) so that small-sized embedded OpenVPN client can make a connection to relay via a VPN Gate server.\nAnyway, this is not a BUG of the current SoftEther VPN Server. The current version does not support the imperfect option strings. This is intended by design. Moreover, there are no standard protocol specifications of the OpenVPN Protocol.\n. > But could you please specify a use case when several different\n\noption strings are acceptable?\n\nCase 1:\nThere is a VPN Server in your corporate network.\nYou have an iPhone with OpenVPN Connect which wants to establish a L3 (tun) VPN session to the server.\nYou have an OpenVPN Bridge-box (linux-based PC) which wants to establish a L2 (tap) VPN session to the server.\nThen the VPN Server must accept both L3 and L2 VPN session in a single server instance. Therefore, the option string is essential.\nCase 2:\nThere is a VPN Server in your corporate network.\nYou have two VPN client computers in the remote branch.\nYour old (slow) computer wants to use DES3-CBC with MD5.\nYour another new (fast) computer wants to use AES-128-CBC with SHA1.\nThen the VPN Server must accept both DES3-CBC and AES-128-CBC VPN session in a single server instance. Therefore, the option string is essential.\n. I wrote the rapid code. I am compiling it. After that I will post the new build. Please test this build when available.\n. I uploaded the test build:\nhttp://uploader.sehosts.com/se4test/v4.11-9508-beta-2014.11.05/\nPlease test Build 9508. This includes the \"OpenVPNDefaultClientOption\" option in the vpn_server.config file. You can manually edit this line if you want to modify. Editing the configuration file must be performed whild the VPN Server service process is not running.\n. OpenVPN UDP mode might be a bottleneck on the high-density concentrated VPN server. Try using OpenVPN TCP mode instead.\n. Did you use the Local Bridge function and the external DHCP server for both assigning IP addresses and providing the communication between virtual hub and physical network?\nOr did you use SecureNAT function?\n. Please upload your vpn_server.config and actual log files in the server_log directory when your problem happened.

This bug in EncryptPassword() MUST NOT be modified.\nThis password encryption is not for security, but for just scrambling a clear text password with the fixed key (constant). This encryption is used only on the configuration file saving function.\nFixing this bug will cause fatal error on existing users of VPN Client.\nKeeping this bug doesn't cause any security issue.\n. Modifying the EncryptPassword() function will break the compatibility with VPN connection settings already saved in the vpn_client.config file.\nI must say that the name of the EncryptPassword() is wrong. This function does not provide any security mechanism but only hiding clear-text in the configuration file, like the Caesar cipher.\n. My suggestion is to modify the code as the following:\n```\n src/Cedar/Client.c | 47 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-----\n 1 file changed, 42 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)\ndiff --git a/src/Cedar/Client.c b/src/Cedar/Client.c\nindex 63af4c7..7ff8c43 100644\n--- a/src/Cedar/Client.c\n+++ b/src/Cedar/Client.c\n@@ -10120,7 +10120,8 @@ void CiWriteClientOption(FOLDER f, CLIENT_OPTION o)\n char DecryptPassword(BUF b)\n {\n    char str;\n-   char key = \"EncryptPassword\";\n+   char key_32bit = \"Encr\";\n+   char key_64bit = \"EncryptP\";\n    CRYPT c;\n    // Validate arguments\n    if (b == NULL)\n@@ -10129,7 +10130,25 @@ char DecryptPassword(BUF *b)\n    }\nstr = ZeroMalloc(b->Size + 1);\n\n\nc = NewCrypt(key, sizeof(key));\n+\n// Note: Do not modify the behavior of this code, otherwise it will break the\n// compatibility with VPN connection settings already saved in the vpn_client.config\n// file.\n// \n// This function does not provide any security mechanism but only hiding clear-text\n// in the configuration file, like the Caesar cipher.\n+\nif (sizeof(void *) == 8)\n{\n// 64-bit systems\nc = NewCrypt(key_64bit, 8);\n}\nelse\n{\n// 32-bit systems\nc = NewCrypt(key_32bit, 4);\n}\n\nEncrypt(c, str, b->Buf, b->Size);\nFreeCrypt(c);\n\n\n@@ -10158,12 +10177,13 @@ char DecryptPassword2(BUF b)\n    return str;\n }\n-// Encrypt the password\n+// Encrypt the password (just only hiding clear-text for configuration saving)\n BUF EncryptPassword(char password)\n {\n    UCHAR tmp;\n    UINT size;\n-   char key = \"EncryptPassword\";\n+   char key_32bit = \"Encr\";\n+   char key_64bit = \"EncryptP\";\n    CRYPT c;\n    BUF b;\n    // Validate arguments\n@@ -10175,7 +10195,24 @@ BUF EncryptPassword(char password)\n    size = StrLen(password) + 1;\n    tmp = ZeroMalloc(size);\n\nc = NewCrypt(key, sizeof(key));\n// Note: Do not modify the behavior of this code, otherwise it will break the\n// compatibility with VPN connection settings already saved in the vpn_client.config\n// file.\n// \n// This function does not provide any security mechanism but only hiding clear-text\n// in the configuration file, like the Caesar cipher.\n+\nif (sizeof(void *) == 8)\n{\n// 64-bit systems\nc = NewCrypt(key_64bit, 8);\n}\nelse\n{\n// 32-bit systems\nc = NewCrypt(key_32bit, 4);\n}\n\nEncrypt(c, tmp, password, size - 1);\nFreeCrypt(c);\n\n\n```\n.

Hello ava1ar,\nI am the owner of this project. This project is not dead.\nSince I want to keep the stability and functionality of SoftEther VPN, I need to review and test all patches submitted through Github or email. As my policy I have put the high priority on the stability and functionality than the rapidly merging of every submitted patches.\nWhile I desire to perform them as soon as possible, my time to review them are very limited because this project is non-commercial and I have daily jobs to do in working days. Therefore, merging patches submitted from several contributors often needs some months especially when I am too busy.\nAs exceptions I respond to any critical vulnerabilities (e.g. privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution) as soon as possible which are reported through the security reporting email address. (the address is on the header of all source code files.)\nTherefore, if you are in hurry to use some particular patches on the pull requests on this Github, you have three options:\n1) Fork this project and apply patches to the destination project.\n2) Apply patches to the local working directory to build your own binary.\n3) Please be patient for next release.\nAnyway it is very welcome that someone will have a forked project to maintain the \"fast track\" of SoftEther VPN, similar to fast track builds of Technical Preview of Windows 10.\n. ava1ar,\n120 is not critical vulnerability. It is by design like a Windows security protocol on the CIFS includes the client computer's node information on the negotiation phase as the Windows server will log them on the security log, and so helpful to perfoem troubleshooting in the viewpoint of VPN server administrators in organizations. If there is a demand to change this client behavior it is very easy to disable it on the client side.\n147 and #179 is not critical vulnerability. Accepting SSLv3 by default is still necessary in this phase for backward compatibility since there are still users using SSLv3-only VPN clients in Japan. Also, any TLS-only VPN clients will never connect to the server in SSLv3 according my understand. Therefore virtually there are no practical threat on accepting SSLv3 in the present time. However, it is sure that disabling SSLv3 by default is important to enlighten users to do not use SSLv3. In fact, users using SSLv3 only clients are only in Japan. To balance both side of users, I need write some codes to decide the default behavior by the user's region or language, or ask the user to remain/disable SSLv3 at the installation point.\n. For the \"Issues\" forum:\nCurrently, this project has two duplicated forums: Issues and VPN Users Forum. The actual usage of both forums are very similar. It is very inefficient for users to seek for / post to both forums to ask questions or post feature requests.\nThe VPN Users Forum has been active before I created this GitHub repository. Spam posts are bothering. While there is a problem of spam posts, spams are periodically removed, and the forum has some anti-spam script features to avoid them as possible.\n. For the fundamental problem that this project is very slow in a certain perspective:\nMy policy to merging pull requests in this repository was wrote in my above comment. The stability and backward compatibility deserves than promptly merging, except critical vulnerability. While I am making my effort to increase speeds, some people have dissatisfaction to my pace.\nTherefore, there are two possibilities I'd like to suggest:\n1) I will create a fast track (development, unstable) repository on GitHub.\nThe fast track repository will accept pull requests (roughly and promptly than the stable repository) with minimum security check.\n2) Responsible volunteer (s) will create and own a forked repository for fast track. He (they) will manage it. I will announce that the new repository is SoftEther's official fast track repository. The new repository may inherit the \"SoftEther\" as the project name if he (they) decide it, or may change the name. He (they) will own the fast track project. I have no authority to manage the fast track project as a dictator.\nIn both choices, users can choose one of the two versions (stable or fast track). The difference between (1) and (2) is the responsibility and the redundancy. For redundancy and rapidness, I thought (2) is better than (1). In the choice (2), it will be virtually active successor of this project. The successor(s) will have the confidence from users.\nAlso there might be other ideas here.\nI'd like to discuss.\n. xortim,\nThank you for your comment. As you mentioned, I admit that the VPN Users Forum has a problem of comfort. The difficult problem is that I cannot rapidly respond to posted questions, troubleshooting requests and feature requests posted to Issues. A new solution for fundamentally reform is necessary as some people here are pointing out.\nI would like to continue to discuss on this problem here to find a way to satisfy contributors and users.\n. xortim,\nThank you for your comment. If we start with option (1), I'd like to integrate all history to the new repository. I don't know well about GitHub, so I'd like to be advised if the following steps are possible.\n1. Create a new repository by forking from this repository.\n   (e.g. \"SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPNDev\". Please suggest another good repository name,)\n2. Integrate all posted issues and pull requests from this repository to the new repository.\n   (Is it possible?)\n3. Add some volunteers/contributors (if there are appropriate people) to the member of the project so that they can easily review and accept pull requests.\n4. For a certain time later, I will transfer the owner authority to the appropriate successor (s) on the SoftEtherVPNDev repository (if there are appropriate successors).\n. Today I reviewed and merged following pull requests and released the new version (SoftEther VPN 4.22 Build 9634). The other pull requests will be reviewed as soon as possible.\nAlso, as the first step of reformation, I am willing divide this project into two repository: stable and development. On the stable repository, I will be the single administrator so far. On the development repository, I will call for administrators who will have the authority to accept pull requests from contributors.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/85\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/96\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/107\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/127\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/128\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/133\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/165\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/178\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/180\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/184\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/189\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/204\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/208\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/217\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/229\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/231\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/232\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/241\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/248\n. The reason is because I am not familier with Git.. Thank you. It could be great. But still I think dividing into two repositories would make it simple, avoiding problems, due to my Git skill.. Then it would be nice that I am going to fork this repository into a new second repository \"SoftEtherVPN_Stable\", and after that, use this current repository \"SoftEtherVPN\" as the primary development repository. All of this Issues forum and current pending pull requests will continue on the \"SoftEtherVPN\" repository.\nThe \"SoftEtherVPN\" repository will have appropriate committers other than myself, and will have more lightweight policy to accept pull requests and further modification. The goal is to make \"SoftEtherVPN\" having democratic management.\nThe \"SoftEtherVPN_Stable\" repository will have only single committer (myself), and will merge patches from the \"SoftEtherVPN\" manually only when I decide to do so.\nAny comments are very welcome.. Thank you, but I would like to divide the project into two repositories, like Fedora and RHEL. In this example, Fedora is the \"SoftEtherVPN\" repository. RHEL is the \"SoftEtherVPN_Stable\" repository. In other words, the stable repository is like a Long-Term Service Branch. \"SoftEtherVPN_Stable\" is the slow track build, and will be a conservative branch. In this purpose I think it is better to make an isolated \"SoftEtherVPN_Stable\" branch in GitHub rather than using branches in the single repository.. In the above analogy, I'd like to move the activity for Fedora to the community, and would like to handle RHEL by myself. Users can individually choose one from the two forks. Most users will use the fast track builds, but small number of users (e.g. enterprise users) will prefer to use the stable and conservative builds. To fulfill both demands, it would be better that I will have the sole responsibility to ensure the integrity of the conservative build.. Thank you for comments. I am considering to do the following things:\n1) Create a new conservative repository named \"SoftEtherVPN_Legacy\" (this name is better than \"SoftEther_Stable\".)\n- I will be the sole maintainer of \"SoftEtherVPN_Legacy\".\n- I will import new feature from \"SoftEtherVPN\" to \"SoftEtherVPN_Legacy\" manually by my decision.\n- I will import bug fixes from \"SoftEtherVPN\" to \"SoftEtherVPN_Legacy\" manually as soon as possible.\n- The \"Issues\" and the \"Pull Requests\" will be hidden on the \"SoftEtherVPN_Legacy\" repository.\n* I took the hint of the postfix \"Legacy\" from the Wireshark project. Wireshark has two branches: Wireshark (Modern) and Wireshark (Legacy). Wireshark Legacy is very conservative while the Modern is aggressive to improve its functionality.\n2) Keep this current \"SoftEtherVPN\" repository without changing the repository name (to avoid confuse users by changing the URL.)\n- I will call this repository as the \"Modern\" repository, in contrast to the \"Legacy\" repository.\n- I will add some maintainers to this repository.\n- I will also be one of the maintainers.\n- Some delegated maintainers will have authority to control the source code, including accepting Pull Requests.\n. For the official binary download site http://www.softether-download.com/,  my idea is:\nI will add two dropdown items \"SoftEther VPN (Legacy)\" and \"SoftEther VPN (Modern)\" on the top page.\nI will share the credential to upload new binary files on this download site to some trusted maintainers.\nMaintainers will be able to upload new builds to the download site.\nMaintainers will have the credential to edit https://www.softether.org/ in real-time.\n. Probably, Long Term Support sounds good. In this case the name will be \"SoftEther_LongTerm\".. I suppose that the current repository should not labeled \"Testing\" or \"Unstable\". The current repository itself will have some branches, and \"Testing\" or \"Unstable\" should be just roles of some branches (not entire the repository.) Then labeling \"Development\" on the current branch is very appropriate in my sense.. I'm sorry for my late response for the planning to fork this repository.\nBecause of my lack of capacity, my response to pull requests for this repository has been delayed frequently.\nTo solve this problem, I'd like to call three (or more) new development board members.\nI posted the following thread. Please kindly read the self nomination process if interested.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/341. For the \"Issues\" forum:\nCurrently, this project has two duplicated forums: Issues and VPN Users Forum. The actual usage of both forums are very similar. It is very inefficient for users to seek for / post to both forums to ask questions or post feature requests.\nThe VPN Users Forum has been active before I created this GitHub repository. Spam posts are bothering. While there is a problem of spam posts, spams are periodically removed, and the forum has some anti-spam script features to avoid them as possible.\n. xortim,\n\nan attempt to force people to write code to fix the bugs as a part of the public reporting process.\n\nIn my thought, forcing people to write code is not a good idea. It is impossible to \"force\" people to work. Every person can gently request to other person to write a code (or do something). However, any person may not \"force\" to other person to do something for a speficic person or a group of people, even for public interests.\n. For issue posting, discussion and pull requests processing on the project, I'd like to discuss about them on the https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/268 page.\n.

I have already decided to fork the project to into two branches: Current-Development and Long-Term.\nRight before forking the current project, I'd like to complete the unfinished job: to accept commits by many of posted pull requests which are already (or just being) reviewed and tested by myself. I suppose it will be done in few weeks. This will be last commits before forking.. Currently I am on the task to merge the following pull requests. They will be merged before the forking.

I added three new board members to this project.\nMoataz Elmasry (Since Nov 6, 2017)\nhttps://github.com/moatazelmasry2\nZulyandri Zardi (Since Nov 6, 2017)\nhttps://github.com/zulzardi\nAlex Maslakov (Since Nov 6, 2017)\nhttps://github.com/GildedHonour\nThe list of board members:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/SoftEtherVPN/people. @paulmenzel \nRecently I asked each of three new members to make the states to \"public\".\nPerhaps the following URL is now correctly displayed.\nhttps://github.com/orgs/SoftEtherVPN/teams/softether-development-board-members/members. @paulmenzel \nSorry, the URL was wrong.\nCorrect one: https://github.com/orgs/SoftEtherVPN/people. Thank you so much for your contribution to enrich the SoftEther VPN source code.\nYour patch has been merged on the main source-tree of SoftEther VPN.\nAs a token of our gratitude, your GitHub username will be added on the AUTHORS.TXT file and on the header of the related source file.\n(It will be done within a few days.)\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/AUTHORS.TXT\nThanks again for your contribution.\n. This patch has a bug. I fixed it on the following patch.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/commit/1f2c052dfbf57ff2d6ff4441dc99e57cf05dbb99. Recently we deleted most of SPAM posts and upgraded the forum system. However, it is a cat-and-mouse game. Need to solve the forum problem fundamentally.. 1. My favorite naming convention is like Windows Kernel source code's. I believe that most of the existing codes of SoftEther VPN is using the similar convention. I suppose it is called Pascal. (But I am not familiar with the code convention.) However, on the name of variables I did not like to use the Pascal convention. I have used snake case for variables and arguments. (except the members of structures.) For names of the structures, macros and typedefs I have used all-upper-case. The indent and newline rules are MS Visual Studio's default rule.  Most of all codes I wrote on this project have the consistency on naming and code conventions.\n\nCould you please let me know the reason why we should avoid tab spaces?\n\n. I understood the reason about recommending spaces rather than tabs. I agree to reform them with spaces.\n. For the common naming and code convention, I agree to change it as necessary based on the entire consensus of contributors. It is a good thing that using good convention which programmers want to use.. I checked the code and found that the encryption candidate list is not fetched from the server, but using the suppoert list of the manager-side.\nThis is not a good, and I am considering to add a new RPC to fetch the support cipher list from the running server to list on the UI and vpncmd.. That is the total amount of exchanged buffer size between user-mode service and kernel-mode virtual network adapter using Read/Write API. Please read the source code of the Neo device driver to see the cause. The fundamental cause is that the adapter does not report the exact byte size of exchanged data. It reports just the total buffer size and become false report. Since the driver is using buffered I/O, it does not affect any performance. You can simply ignore it.. Thank you for your report. I fixed the bug.\nhttp://www.softether.org/5-download/history\n. As Guido posted, Guido has conducted the security analysis on the SoftEther VPN code tree. According to him, he did this analysis as a job asked by a particular \"client\". (I know the client's name, but I do not write it here because I am not sure whether it is allowed to be disclosed.)\nGuido found and gave me reports of 8 vulnerabilities (currently) found in the SoftEther VPN code tree. Guido also made patches to solve these problems. The last report from Guido is received in a private email on November 9.\nThe summary of currently 8 vulnerabilities are:\n- 4 missing memory boundaries checks. There is no risk of arbitrary code execution or intrusion on these bugs in my analysis. However, these problems may lead to crash the running server process. So these bugs must be fixed.\n- 4 memory leaks. While the amount of leakage is very small per time, these bugs can finally cause process crash. So these bugs must be fixed.\nCurrently I am preparing the patch and also analyzing the impact of these problems carefully. While my analysis of the present time concludes these 8 bugs do not admit any arbitrary code execution or intrusion but only DoS attacks, I need to check it more deeply.\nThe patch release process:\nBecause still there are a lot of users of the SoftEtherVPN_Stable branch, I will apply the patch to the SoftEtherVPN_Stable branch firstly, and at the same time I will submit the pull request for these patch from the SoftEtherVPN_Stable branch to this SoftEtherVPN branch. \n. Thank you for reporting. Could you please test the older version (SoftEther VPN 4.22 Build 9634) with your Android device?. Thank you. \nPerhaps https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/293 or https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/294 might cause this problem.. @moatazelmasry2 @akuropka On the patch https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/294 there is a suspicious code in the IkeHMac function.\nPerhaps the following modification in the IkeHMac function might solve the problem.\nHopefully someone would test it. I don't have any Android Oreo devices.\n- for (i = 0;i < HMAC_BLOCK_SIZE;i++)\n+ for (i = 0;i < hmac_block_size;i++). I released the fix as the Build 9652 Beta.\nhttps://www.softether.org/5-download/history\n- Fixed the bug which occurs the L2TP/IPsec connection error with Android Oreo on the Build 9647 and 9651.\nPlease note that this fix is only on the https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable repository.. I created Pull Request for this bug fix.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/405. I got two positive feedback so I will merge this PR now.. Recently surely I use Pull Request for applying my patch to this repository.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/405\nI suppose that there is a rough consensus that any pull request needs to have at least two positive thumbs. Since my PR got two positive thumbs, I pushed the marge button by myself.. Hmm.... I am going to learn how to use Git and GitHub.. I don't think it is good to output all console strings to the debug view. Only the outputs from the DebugArgs() function (in Str.c) should be copied to the debug view.\n// Display a debug string with arguments\nvoid DebugArgs(char *fmt, va_list args)\n{\n    // Validate arguments\n    if (fmt == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n    if (g_debug == false)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\nPrintArgs(fmt, args);  <-- It is good to insert the code here.\n\n}\n. I suppose that this should be editable on the configuration file. The default value should same to the existing constants.\nAltering the default behavior by editing the constants in the header file is not a good idea.\n. Even so, I suppose there is no reason to increase the OPENVPN_PING_SEND_INTERVAL value.. @davidebeatrici Thank you. I fixed them.. @davidebeatrici Thank you. I fixed the typo.. Then we will have to create a new branch 'GPL' as the complete snapshot of the particular day (to switch to Apache License). After that period we will have to remove all commits which authors are unreachable or are not allowed to change to Apache License. Then the master branch will continue to contain only Apache License codes.. https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/519. > \"there were my gpl commits... they were removed ... I insist that gpl was violated\"\nIn such a point of view, his codes which were committed under the GPL license were not removed. They are still stored in the \"gpl\" branch. The \"gpl\" branch will continuously keeping GPL as the license.. Preliminary to further movements, I'd like to add the following sentence on the Pull Request template.\n\nPRELIMINARY DECLARATION FOR FUTURE SWITCH TO A NON-GPL LICENSE\nI hereby agree in advance that my work will be licensed automatically under the Apache License or a similar BSD/MIT-like open-source license in case the SoftEther VPN Project adopts such a license in future.\n\nI suppose that even if this modification has profits, not harmful.\nPlease kindly comment on this modification on https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/519 .. For now, I realize that there are no risks to switch from GPL to the BSD-like license after summarizing approval from every existing contributors (= copyright holders). In case if some contributors doesn't reply anything, we can keep the master branch excluding such GPL codes.\nI listed 25 contributors who committed programs to this project at 2018/04/25 19:20.\n(Excluding very minor changes which will not treated as a copyright-protected work in Japanese Copyright laws.)\nAt a glance, more than half of the contributed codes have only minor changes. If some contributors don't agree to this switch motion to non-GPL, we can rewrite such work without using any contributed GPL codes.\nIn other hand, it would be more difficult in future that more contributors will commit their works to this project under the current license. For example if we will have 500+ contributors in future, It is impossible to collect approval from 500+ contributors.\n\n\nmoatazelmasry2\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/499\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/293\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/294\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/309\n\n\nchipitsine\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/477\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/465\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/440\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/275\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/229\n\n\nlewellyn\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/217\n\n\na-kr\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/476\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/327\n\n\nquantum5\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/343\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/344\n\n\nparly\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/452\n\n\nmaksqwe\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/426\n\n\najeecai\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/258\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/248\n\n\nNoahO\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/282\n\n\nzulzardi\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/313\n\n\ncm0x4D\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/256\n\n\nrtau\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/208\n\n\nLegDog\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/204\n\n\nmacvk\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/202\n\n\nmcsalgado\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/178\n\n\nmicsell\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/165\n\n\nholoreimu\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/154\n\n\nghost\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/143\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/33\n\n\nyehorov\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/133\n\n\nel1n\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/14\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/23\n\n\nyfdyh000\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/30\n\n\nnattoheaven\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/34\n\n\ntonychung00\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/84\n\n\nsacha\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/85\n\n\nnvsofts\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/129\n. To decide switching to Apache license, I need the consensus on this community.\n\n\nAt least, I have to send letters to each of existing contributors to ask whether agree to adopt Apache license. I suppose that we need to decide about this issue after the ratio of agreed contributors will be discovered.\nCould anybody please kindly write a draft of the email to ask to each contributor in English?\n. Thank you for this good improvement that is good for users who use the certificate authentication function with OpenVPN.\nHowever, I think that this is not goot for users who use the password-based authentication function with OpenVPN. Some OpenVPN Client implementations (e.g. OpenVPN Connect for iOS) requires the dummy certificate in the client configuration file even if the password-based method is specified. Therefore, the dummy certificate must not be removed as the default behavior for existing users.\nThis does not meet with the following principle.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/SoftEther-VPN-Developers-Guideline-(DRAFT)\n\nMUST NOT remove any features from the current SoftEther VPN in the default configuration setting. It is OK to add an opt-out configuration to turn off a specific feature in the configuration file.\n\nThe good way is to add new OpenVPN configuration samples for users of the certificate authentication function. In the current code, we have just two existing .ovpn files in the ZIP file generated by the sample configuration generating function.\n\"XXXXX_openvpn_remote_access_l3.ovpn\"\n\"XXXXX_openvpn_site_to_site_bridge_l2.ovpn\"\n(XXXXX is the server hostname.)\nI recommend NOT to change the behavior on the above two .ovpn files, according to the guideline.\nI suppose that adding two additional .ovpn files is a good idea.\n\"XXXXX_openvpn_remote_access_l3_with_certificate_auth.ovpn\"\n\"XXXXX_openvpn_site_to_site_bridge_l2_with_certificate_auth.ovpn\"\n. Making a copy of \"hamcore/openvpn_sample.ovpn\" to \"hamcore/openvpn_sample_cert_auth.ovpn\", and to edit the latter one as you wish is good to realize both keeping existing behavior and adding new behavior. This method does not affect any existing users who are still using password-based authentication with some OpenVPN Clients (e.g. for iOS).\n. I see. Thank you for your comment.\nIf there is confidence about this, this is not a practical problem.. This code has a bug.\np->ServerIP is an instance of the structure IP, not UINT.\nAdditionally, I am not sure that p->ServerIP always has a correct IP address in this case. Sometimes p->ServerIP has 0.0.0.0. Sometimes p->ServerIP has IPv6 IP address, In such a case, some implementation (e.g. Windows L2TP client) occurs errors.\nMoreover, PPP_IPCP_OPTION_IP should has an endpoint IP address in the PPP tunnel, not a global IP address.\nAs the original developer of this code, I don't agree with this modification unless the adequate tests will be done with most of all widely-used L2TP or SSTP client environment. However, if someone endorse this code that this doesn't occur any problem, it is OK to merge this code.\n. As the opinion by original author of this code, there is a reason to always reply \"1.0.0.1\" in this PPP negotiation phase while some people might say that it is corner-cutting.. I'd like to strongly recommend to apply this code as \"opt-out configuration\" (= apply the original behavior as default), according to the following rule in the SoftEther VPN Developers Guideline (DRAFT).\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/SoftEther-VPN-Developers-Guideline-(DRAFT)\n\nMUST NOT remove any features from the current SoftEther VPN in the default configuration setting. It is OK to add an opt-out configuration to turn off a specific feature in the configuration file.\n\n. @mxs42 After running make, is the file ./vpncmd created on the directory?\nIf so, please try \n$ ./vpncmd /tool /cmd:Check\n. @mxs42 If the './vpncmd /tool /cmd:Check' command passes there is no problem.\nAccording to the Makefile, the build process tries two types of arguments to run gcc as following:\n$(CC) code/vpnserver.a $(OPTIONS) -o vpnserver || $(CC) -no-pie code/vpnserver.a $(OPTIONS) -o vpnserver\nAs above, gcc tries without \"-no-pie\" option at first. If it fails, gcc tries with \"-no-pie\" option.\nSome versions of gcc doesn't support 'no-pie' flag. Some versions of gcc requires 'no-pie' flag. To support both environment, the Makefile tries both flags.\nThere is no problem if finally the binaries will be compiled successfully.\n. This is normal.\nUDP packets must be exchanged peroidically with short time interval in order to:\n1) Keep alive the UDP session on the NAT box.\n2) Detect if the UDP session is terminated by the NAT or Firewall to switch to TCP-based communication promptly.\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/79e2de6e25645484762f0640f467b4e4c4d23fcd/src/Cedar/UdpAccel.h#L134-L137\n. Since the port numbers of UDP Acceleration is dynamic, you cannot setup static NAT port forwarding entry in advance.. Thank you reporting this problem.\nI fixed this on the Stable Build (SoftEther VPN 4.27 Build 9668 Beta).. Could you please paste the full results of the make command?. If the message\n```\nThe command completed successfully.\n\nThe preparation of SoftEther VPN Server is completed !\n``\nis displayed after the make command, it is no problem.. Ifmakegenerates./vpnserver`, it is ok.. I'm afraid that this patch might break the following rule on the SoftEther VPN Developers Guideline.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/SoftEther-VPN-Developers-Guideline-(DRAFT)\n\nMUST NOT remove any features from the current SoftEther VPN in the default configuration setting. It is OK to add an opt-out configuration to turn off a specific feature in the configuration file.. We shouldn't change the time offset between UINT64 and the SYSTEMTIME since there are a lot of running instances of SoftEther VPN (both RPC server and client). Modification of this offset will affect to all existing users.. Please use the \"Startup Connection\" function which is already implemented on SoftEther VPN Client. This function realizes what you want to do.\n\n\nThis function is expressly described in the 4.4.19 Startup Connection section on the manual:\n\nYou can set a connection setting for startup connection by using VPN Client Manager to select a connection setting and then clicking [Set as Startup Connection] on the [Connect] menu. When a connection setting is set for startup connection, a connection to VPN Server is automatically started using that connection setting when Windows is started.\n\nhttps://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/4._SoftEther_VPN_Client_Manual/4.4_Making_Connection_to_VPN_Server#4.4.19_Startup_Connection. I found the cause. This problem causes only on Authenticode-signed binaries. I changed Authenticode certificate from DigiCert SHA-256 & SHA-1 to Codomo SHA-256 only. It fails on Windows XP. I am going to fix the build as soon as possible.. I published the new binary (Build 9669) with SHA-1 and SHA-256 dual Authenticode digital certificates.\nhttps://www.softether.org/5-download/history\nCould you please try it?. In the Hash() function, enabling specifying hashname as a string is very good idea in general.\nHowever, this will impact for the performance. OpenSSL source code has the const EVP_MD *EVP_get_digestbyname(const char *name) function which has a finding loop in the const char *OBJ_NAME_get(const char *name, int type) function. OBJ_NAME_get function also has a thread lock.\nTherefore I'd like to suggest to treat frequently used hash functions as special, not to call EVP_get_digestbyname() one by one.. My suggestion is\n(1) Delete the \"Hash\" function symbol, and never use it from now on. It will be extinct. I don't agree the changing of the behavior / arguments of the current \"Hash()\" function because it will be a cause of mistakes when developers try to merge codes.\n(2) Define the HashByName() function to use EVP_get_digestbyname() as you suggest.\n(3) The UINT Hash(const EVP_MD *md, void *dest, void *src, UINT size)  function should be renamed to HashByMd to make the \"Hash\" function symbol extinct. Then developers will notice by compile error when merging codes.\n(4) Define the following functions for performance call.\nHash_SHA0() => call Internal_SHA0()\nHash_SHA1() => call OpenSSL SHA1() for performance\nHash_MD5() => call OpenSSL MD5() for performance\nHash_SHA256() => call OpenSSL SHA256() for performance\nHash_SHA512() => call OpenSSL SHA512() for performance\n(5) Call \"Hash_***\" functions as possible for performance from client codes.\n. Admiration for your hard work!\nExisting NewMd() function has only HMAC function.\nIf you want to add a non-HMAC function as a new function on the NewMd() function, I'd like to suggest to improve the NewMd function as the following way to avoid breaking all consumer codes which each forked programmers have already called.\n```\nMD NewMd(char name)\n{\n    return NewMdEx(name, false);\n}\nMD NewMdEx(char name, bool simple_hashing)\n{\n   if (simple_hashing)\n   {\n      ... / New codes /\n   }\n   else\n   {\n      ... / Existing codes /\n   }\n}\n```\nBecause there is no default parameter value in the C language, we need to to something like above to keep the backward compatibility on the library.\n. That is a good idea if it supports .NET Core 2.1.. That is no problem. Could you perform it if possible please?. Thank you.\nI also improved .gitignore not to affect this change to the entire SoftEtherVPN repository.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/709/commits/8c2e0f32d366cb17c4af4d2ffecb4061f8d302b9\nThe Visual Studio-related .gitignore I added on this commit is intended only to apply on the `tools/stbchecker' directory.\n. Also I changed the directory name tools/ to developer_tools/ in order to make it clear that these tools in the directory are just for developers, not for users. I prefer further development-time tools should be placed on this developer_tools/ directory.. Could you tell me how to squash the commits please? I pushed the 'combine commits' menu on TortoiseGit and the commit ID https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/709/commits/b4d42d9cc3a231e08c6da88e09d93df4f82ddec5 is created. Is it ok?\n\n. I suppose that checking (p == NULL) after p = ParsePacket(data, size); and return immediately with calling Free(data) is enough to realize it.. Could you please attach the \"Advanced Settings\" dialog box of your connection settings as the following?\n\n. You can protect the settings by set up the password of VPN Client. Since the configuration vpn_client.config file is protected by the VPN Server service any of the configuration contents cannot be accessed unless another user has the correct VPN Client password.. > The concern is that User A, that may have saved the settings with his userid/password, then User B logs on can then connect to the remote network, using User A's saved vpn credentials. In my case each user, using the VPN may have different access right levels.\nUser B is unable to use User A's saved credentials if User A set the password of VPN Client.. Try the following security policy to prevent that users accidentally save the password.\n\n. Thank you. I fixed it.. Thank you. I fixed it, too.. To avoid any errors on any system, the subnet mask should not be /32 for safety. Some existing systems or some future systems might have a check routine that the specified IP address and subnet mask is compatible with the type of the network device. In OpenVPN L2 (TAP) mode, the type of the network device is Ethernet. Since Ethernet is not point-to-point topology, the IPv4 network on the Ethernet must have network address, host addresses and broadcast address. The subnet mask 255.255.255.240 is the largest number near 255.255.255.255 to make the address 192.0.0.8 as a host address (not network address nor broadcast address).. I wrote this in the NewCedar() function because similar OpenVPN configuration option OpenVPNDefaultClientOption is also written in the NewCedar() function.. ",

Just to let you know I needed IPSec/IKEv1 in tunneling mode, so I'm currently working on implementing it in SoftEther and actually investing time in that. Hopefully after that I'll find time to add IKEv2, doing a port from strongswan.\nHere's my code (it is a WIP) \nhttps://github.com/moatazelmasry2/SoftEtherVPN/tree/ipsec-tunnel\nSo if anyone wants to help with IPSec tunneling or with IKEv2 or just need to exchange ideas, I'll be glad to talk\n. Hi guys, please do not add a comment with +1 and instead use the thumbs up button on the first comment. This way it is possible to track how many people want this feature. Cheers. The question was answered correctly. The user does not exist anymore on github. I'd like to close this issue.. I also agree that this should be implemented. I added a \"good first issue\" tag and hope someone will implement it soon.. @dnobori did you manage to implement a fix, or can you tell us at least what is the cause of the problem ?. What is auto routing?. This is a duplicate of issue #55 . If it is ok. I'll close this issue in favor of tracking changes in the other issue.. Hi @nickdsl. Could you please create a pull request with your suggestion. As far as I remember from an old Project, the Cisco client was using IPSec tunneling mode, which is currently not supported by SoftEtherVPN. So this is not a problem, it is simply not implemented. This can be solved by extending the current IPSec implementation in SoftEther (Used in L2TP) to completely implement IKEv1 (IPSec tunneling mode) . The OP seems to be inactive. For this reason I'd like to close this issue within the next few days if there are no objections. \nCheers. In SoftEther currently you can only block IP Addresses, but not URLs. \nThis can be configured in the Access lists. Hi @sahal it looks like your merged PR resolves this issue. Could you please add some documentation in the README on how to use this solution for debian users so that we can close this issue? . The OP seems to be inactive. For this reason I'd like to close this issue within the next few days if there are no objections. \nCheers. @cicku . The project has now some new board members (me included)  and we will try to take care of these stuff in the sfuture. \nDid you manage to pack it into Fedora and EPEL??. why not what??. A new release tag has been created on github containing the release binaries\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/releases/tag/v4.24-9651-beta\nThis will hopefully be automated in the future. Hmm. One idea is to use travis-ci or a similar tool to fetch the list from vpngate.net and create a daily commit on github. \nvpngate client can then be configured with a new mirror URL (github) to fetch the list from.. As far as I know, no there is no SoftEther client for Android.\nHow can you help? Good question. Can you programm android apps?. @aicochow L2TP uses port 1701 and it cannot be easily changed.. Hi @Schouwenburg . Does this problem still occur with the latest SoftEther?. Unfortunately this is an apple issue not a SoftEther issue. You need to install a VPN Profile with the \"always on\" feature enabled. Please see this article:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/218851/how-to-enable-always-on-vpn-on-an-iphone-or-ipad/\n. Thanks for asking and really sorry that this is taking so much time. \nI've been trying to merge as many PRs as I can. I just ask you to be patient, as I don't want to merge anything that will be break the build or previous installations. \nIf you want to help facilitate this, please confirm that this PR is actually working. So far there is only one comment that actually saying that this PR is working. \nCheers. @timschneider \nYour great patch is much appreciated. We are considering to apply your patch into the SoftEther VPN main tree.\nSoftEther VPN Patch Acceptance Policy: http://www.softether.org/5-download/src/9.patch\nYou have two options which are described on the above policy. Could you please choose either option 1 or 2, and specify it clearly on the reply?. Looks like visual studio 2008 failed to build \nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoftEtherVPN/softethervpn/build/build-10-cb6fc10\nI'll try to investigate tomorrow why. Hi there again @timschneider. thanks again for your PR. I put some time today into mitigating the errors in your PR under visual studio 2008. There's unfortunately alot of code that works under linxu nut not under windows. While to my understanding this piece of software is intended for linux, the software as a whole must be compilable under Windows. Here are some problems I faced:\n\nAs @davidebeatrici  mentioned, pid_t is not defined in windows\nSTDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO are not defined\nsame for EXIT_FAILURE\nsame for SIGTERM\n\nPlease try to get your code running under windows. Thanks. Hi Tim and thanks for the quick reaction, \nI'll try to review your PR this week. Cheers.\nMoataz. Thank you for your great PR. It has been squashed and merged into the master branch. As a token of gratitude, your name will be added to the authors list. Again many thanks for your hard work and your contribution. I personally prefer CMake over Autotools,, as it is easier to understand and manage. What do the other contributors  think????. Hi @dajhorn. We merged PR #518 which makes use of cmake. Would you like to isolate the FHS changes into its own PR?. Closing this for now. Since cmake is in use now. Sorry. PR #327 has been merged into the master branch. Happy compiling. Hi guys, ideally we can create releases within travis-ci or appveyor. I'll try to either integrate the build binaries into one of the build tools, or just quickly create binaries and upload them. Cheers. I also agree we should close this issue, because it is a disclaimer and not a license. \n@dnobori You mentioned there will be new disclaimer text. What is the status on that?\nFurther Suggestions: \n- Move the disclaimer in its own text file. This approach is the most popular one. @davidebeatrici could you please thumb up PR #417 so that it can be merged into master?. Yup agree. Please feel free to comment against closing this issue if you see otherwise. Nop. This is not implemented. An easy solution is to mark the log directory as read only. . What is Wins Server???. hi @martell . This sound good, please implement that if you can. \nThere are some new board members here and we can actually accept PRs :) . So please do it.\nAlso @martell  and @topherbuckley . You do not really need Visual Studio to compile this project. I don't even have windows. I have linux and eclipse. Both are free and I use make and gcc to compile. \nHowever there are many things that could be enhanced in the configure and the make file. \nDo you have concrete ideas???\n. Hi @martell . These are all valid suggestions. I fully agree with a better build number suggestion as well as the tagging. \nI will change the title of this issue (I hope this is ok) to reflect these requests and would also like to use this issue to track the progress on a release process.. This feature does not exist in SoftEther and is really out of scope of SoftEther. \nfail2ban is one solution. There are several threads on the forum regarding this:\nhttp://www.vpnusers.com/search.php?keywords=fail2ban\nYou can also implement a similar result if you are using freeradius as a backend for Softether:\nhttp://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/lockout\nThere is really nothing to do here unfortunately, so I'll go ahead and close this issue.\n. There are some log files available but nothing more. What do you mean by performance stats. What kind of logs are you looking at collecting?. No answer in a long time. Closing this issue. This is definitely currently not possible. I remember from a discussion some months (year?) ago that this is technically not possible, but I'm not sure anyway. \nWhat if you didn't use clustering and used instead multiple stand alone with the same configurations and all use the same radius server for authentication. Then added a load balancer infront of them Would that solve your problem??? . Unfortunately yes.\nIs this a feature you would like to request? If so, please change the issue description accordingly, or even better we close this issue and create a new feature request issue . No answer in a long time. Closing this issue. @busted-it-guy would you like to create a PR with this content?I think it is a nice addition. This is not a serious commit. Closing. Almost 4 years later, but this is a good PR and we should merge it. Also if you have more of those good fixes, please submit. Currently certificate authentication is only supported in own SoftEtherVPN Protocol but not in other protocols. Sorry I don't understand. What is the issue????. The OP seems to be inactive. For this reason I'd like to close this issue within the next few days if there are no objections. \nCheers. As I understood from the other thread, one need to remove the format file from the git repository. Is this correct?. Nop. SoftEther write the logs by default to the logs folder. \nWhat if you start SoftEther WITHOUT execsvc\nThen in the next line you run cat -f <PATH TO LOG FILES>\nWould this solve your docker problem? . As far as I understand, this project does not really depend on other external vpn libraries and include stuff directly into its own ecosystem, which is ok I guess.. The answer from @test-github123  does actually solve the problem.\nAnother solution is to use Eclipse C++ (I use it myself) and it works great. You will have to compile on the command line though.. Nop. Looks like it is not part of the OpenSource Repository and is not being generated when compiling the code.. Please add a thumb up to the issue description, so it is clear how many users want this feature. Yes. It is always a good practice to take a backup before upgrading.. This issue is a couple of years old and there are many good answers here, and I personally couldn't reproduce it, when installing under /opt and giving the correct permissions.\nvpnserver is supposed to run with sudo.\nIf things are working fine now, I'd like to close this issue in the next few days . PR #339 Solves this problem for vpncmd. vpnserver should be started as root. For vpnclient, I am not sure. @hongquan yes true. So this issue has been answered correctly. Closing this issue  . Hi @patrakov has this issue been resolved by now?. Hi @dpoper Does this issue still happen?. I marked another similar ticket as a feature request and I'm trying to find the most requested features of this project to announce. This ticket is a duplicate of #101 . Please thumbs up there if you want this implemented. . Sorry I think this is a very specific use case. Or I may have not understood this feature. . There is another problem with this PR which is that SoftEther can not currently use colon as a separator. You need to implement that as well otherwise SE can not parse the list. This PR contains errors. Another PR #343 is much cleaner and solves the cipher suite actually in a nicer manner. The user does not seem to respond anymore. I'd like to close this PR without merging within the next few days if there is no objection\n. Hi all. Currently I'm trying to put up a roadmap for this project. So if this an actual feature request, then please change the description accordingly and vote (thumbs up) on the issue, so it is easy to know which features are wanted the most. Cheers . Did you try recently. Can you please try again? In which country are you?. Hi @nvsofts this is a great patch and I'd love to merge it. Could you please resolve the conflicts so that we can merge it please???. Your PR has been merged. I had to rename some stuff since the naming convention is currently messed up. Never the less it is a great PR. Thank you for your hard work. As a token of gratitude your name has been added to authors list. Cheers. Did you try SoftEther Own vpn Protocol instead of OpenVPN???. Hi @ghost . What SoftEther is currently offering is a simple Access List through allowing/disallowing IPs. Implementing a Proxy as part of SoftEther is a HUGE effort and in my openion not really a part of SE. There are products out there much better in doing that, for example Squid.\nBy the way for a project I did in the past, I set up a Squid Server infront of SE which intercepted all the decrypted traffic to disable . Here's what I did, but please note I'm just copy pasting here without proofing anything:\n```sh\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT --match owner --uid-owner proxy -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT  -m owner --gid-owner vpnserver -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT --match owner --uid-owner proxy -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -m owner --gid-owner vpnserver -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3129\niptables -N ufw-user-output\niptables -N ufw-user-output-b4drop\niptables -A OUTPUT -j ufw-user-output\niptables -A OUTPUT -j ufw-user-output-b4drop\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p tcp --sport 22 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 53 -d 8.8.4.4 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 53 -d 8.8.8.8 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --sport 1194 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p tcp --sport 3128 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p tcp --sport 3129 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p tcp --dport 3128 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p tcp --dport 3129 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --sport 67 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --sport 68 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 1701 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 500 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 50 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 51 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p tcp --dport 1812 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 1812 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p tcp --dport 1813 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output -p udp --dport 1813 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-output-b4drop --match owner ! --uid-owner proxy -m limit --limit 50/minute -j LOG --log-level 7 --log-prefix \"--OUTPUT Dropped:\"\niptables -A OUTPUT --match owner ! --uid-owner proxy -j DROP\n\nIptables INPUT\niptables -N ufw-user-input\niptables -N ufw-user-input-b4drop\niptables -A INPUT -j ufw-user-input\niptables -A INPUT -j ufw-user-input-b4drop\niptables -A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 443 -m state --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-input -p udp --dport 1701 -m state --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-input -p udp --dport 500 -m state --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-input -p udp --dport 4500 -m state --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-input -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-input -p udp --sport 53 --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED  -j ACCEPT\niptables -A ufw-user-input-b4drop -m limit --limit 50/minute -j LOG --log-level 7 --log-prefix \"--INPUT Dropped:\"\n\n$IPTABLES -A OUTPUT -m limit --limit 50/minute -j LOG --log-level 7 --log-prefix \"---OUTPUT---\"\nIPv4 address of proxy\nPROXYIP4=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nIPv6 address of proxy\nPROXYIP6=xxx:xxx:xxx\ninterface facing clients\nCLIENTIFACE=eth0\narbitrary mark used to route packets by the firewall.

If you are using OpenVPN, this is easily done on the client side. Or are you using SoftEther own Protocol?. Yes of course you can push from your OpenVPN clients whatever routes. \nSee this thread: https://serverfault.com/questions/631037/how-to-route-only-specific-openvpn-traffic-through-a-openvpn-based-on-ip-filteri\nSpecifically:\n```\nredirect all default traffic via the VPN\npush redirect-gateway def1\nredirect the Intranet network 192.168.1/24 via the VPN\nroute 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0\nredirect another network to NOT go via the VPN\nroute 10.10.0.0 255.255.255.0 net_gateway\nredirect a host using a domainname to NOT go via the VPN\nroute www.google.ca 255.255.255.255 net_gateway\n```\nDoes this help?. @PawelDefee  answered the question correctly. Closing this issue. Nop. But it is a nice feature. I'd like to merge this PR. Could anyone else please thumb up or +1 this PR so we can merge. Thanks. Your PR has been squashed and merged into the master branch. Many thanks for your contribution. Had to revert. This PR broke the build of SE. Please see: \nhttps://travis-ci.org/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/builds/365328348\n. I'm currently trying to collect most requested features. If you know other people who want this feature, then please invite them to thumb up your issue. Thanks. Why did you close this issue? How did you solve the problem?\nI'm also trying to debug softether. And I found out the reason why it is exiting is because there was another softether process running in the background. When I killed it, the program didn't exit.\nMy problem is a bit different, while starting, any breakpoint is used successfully, but after starting, eclipse seem to ignore all the breakpoints. Did you have a similar situation??\n. @alolis  Thanks. This solved my problem. Any ideas why you can't start a debugger directly from eclipse?\n. @MtCedarNet Yes I'm starting with execsvc\n. @omlaverde would you please create a Pull Request for this???. @Eric7Coding depends on your Linux distro, but as @gulbuhar mentioned, you might need to enable tun/tap in the kernel and recompile and install the kernel. Is this issue still happening?. Your great patch is much appreciated. We are considering to apply your patch into the SoftEther VPN main tree.\nSoftEther VPN Patch Acceptance Policy:\nhttp://www.softether.org/5-download/src/9.patch\nYou have two options which are described on the above policy.\nCould you please choose either option 1 or 2, and specify it clearly on the reply?\n. Thanks for your patch. Could you please align your code to have the same amount of space as the rest of code???. No  it looks good from my side. Now I need someone who understands traditional Chinese to actually review the content of the translation. Also we need one more thumb up before merging this PR. Thank you very much. Your great PR has been merged into the master branch. As a token of gratitude your name will be added to the authors list. \nAgain thank you very much for your hard work. Hi @ziozzang  Thank you for your PR.\nCould you please specify which Acceptance policy option, do you want to use?? \nSoftEther VPN Patch Acceptance Policy:\nhttp://www.softether.org/5-download/src/9.patch\n. Question has been answered. Closing the issue. Looks like certificate has been updated a while back. Alot has happened during the past 2 years regarding SE developement. Are you still having trouble???. Sorry the question is not clear at all. Which port are you talking about? When you start the connection from your PC, a socket is created on your machine with a port number > 1024 and connects to whatever port on the SE-Server (port 443 or so)\nWhich port do you want to change now?? and why??. Hi there. Than you for your pull request.\nThe description of the PR is missing. Also you added Tamil as a language, but the language is not supported, so why are you adding it???. No such feature is currently implemented unfortunately.\nMay I ask why do you want to do that?. No answer in a long time. Closing this issue. If you are talking about android, there's a library that we used in the past and it works quite fine.\nhttps://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn\nDoes this answer your question?. No answer in a long time. Closing this issue. You can achieve that by a program that mingle with network layer 4-7. For example squid is able to add whatever headers to http requests. What is the question exactly? I don't understand..... No answer in a long time. Closing this issue. As others mentioned, the issue is resolved by changing the matric in the VPN adapter. . Could you please verify that this problem still occur?. Didn't test that yet, but this looks like a very good analysis. Solid work!!!. Now we need someone to implement that :). For first suggestion. Yes it is valid. \nFor second suggestion, you can indeed achieve that by using firewall rules. @hsaito systemd directory has been merged into SoftEther a while ago. Closing this issue. Please have a look under the directory centos/. There are now a SPECS and a readme file for building the rpm. @fefewolf Why in your openion is this a mempory leak?? Isn't not obvious that every logged in user will use some server capacity. \nThis would be a memory leak if for example, after a user logs out, no memory is freed.  . No answer in a long time. Closing this issue. @tahasiddiqui123 answer should solve the problem of the OP. Closing. Certificates are at the moment not supported by OpenVPN Server in SoftEther. I'll label this issue as feature request. PR #327 has just been merged. @slym  Which VPN protocol are you using?. If you are using VirtualNAT? Are you then aware of the static routing table  feature? You can reroute the traffic based on the target's subnet.\nGo to Hub -> Secure NAT Config -> \"Edit the static Routing Table to push\"\nDoes this solve your problem?. This could be achieved by OpenVPN client\u00d6\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/631037/how-to-route-only-specific-openvpn-traffic-through-a-openvpn-based-on-ip-filteri\nBut yes I agree it is a missing feature in SoftEther protocol. For L2TP this might be only be implemented if it is part of an RFC related to L2TP. Guys. Please do not write in chinese. This website is in english and we have no way of following this conversation. Closing issue... SoftEther does not implement IPSec IKE, aka. IPSec tunneling mode(yet). So this can not work. . @macvk is this still an open PR? What is the link?. @nikrox2 As mentioned, this has been merged on the master branch. No binaries available yet. I'll try to create a a release within the next days, after I clear something with Daiyuu. I'm using ecliopse\nrun:\nsh\nmake clean\nmake DENUG=YES\nAnd you should be able to set break points in eclipse\n. Please see this article\nhttp://moatazthenervous.com/how-to-debug-softethervpn/\n. This is actually a nice feature. @GildedHonour I'm also unaware of such documentation. There is however another great resource. An implementation of vpncmd in Python:\nhttps://github.com/mindcollapse/SoftEtherPy\nCan this ticket be closed?. 2 years later, but nevertheless this great PR has finally made it into the code :)\nI added your name to the authors list. Thanks again. Related to Issue #80 . Which VPN protocol are you using on your android?. Please post your configuration. Definitely. However it is not implemented yet.\nWould you be interested in implementing that?. Could you please explain why this is a bug??. Ok. Thanks for the explanation. In this case I agree with you. @m0zart89  could you please adapt your PR to the comment:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/211#issuecomment-254700676\n??\nThank you. @macvk  where is that??. @m0zart89 ping??????. In this case we should close this PR. Any objections??. Can someplease create a pull request? as it is then easier to comment on the code inside the PR. @m0zart89  Which PR is this???. With bridge mode (no virtual NAT) it is known to get much better speed. I have no numbers unfortunately. However SE hat its own speed test tool:\nhttps://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/4._SoftEther_VPN_Client_Manual/4.8_Measuring_Effective_Throughput\nAlso there's a discussion about SE on reddit. Maybe this helps\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/388kpa/openvpn_vs_softether_vpn_protocol/\nGood luck. Hi @gecko-dev . How much RAM do you have?. Hi @QewQew . Is this problem still happening? Also with the newest SoftEther?\nWhich OS are you using? And which SoftEther Version. Hi @tahasiddiqui123 . Is the problem now resolved?. Hi there. Thank you for your PR.\nUnfortunately there are many problems with it. First of all the description is in korean or so, so we can not really understand the description. Then the commit messages are also missing. The changes introduced are huge and not understandable. \nCould you please explain what you are trying to do???. @el1n Could you please explain this PR? Otherwise I must unfortunately close it. Please also see PR #518 . Since the Poster is not responding and since merged PR #518, it won't be possible to accept this PR. I'm sorry. @ijat  A Pull request I created a while back adds sha256 and sha512 to OpenVPN\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/309\nThis should resolve your request. The patch has been merged. Closing the issue. @RolfWojtech Yes I think this is a nice feature that would tighten security of SE. Hi @cpitclaudel I agree that this is not really well defined and the project should work on documentation and transparent test/performance cases to reflect that. Android also requires 25$ so this is not the issue. \nIn my openion however, this is quite luxurious feature and the moment there are more urgant issues that needed attending to. @benjojo Answer is correct. Closing this issue. If you just want a standalone DDNS client, why don't you use any of the available products on the market?. In my opinion this is an overkill feature. I wrote a small nodejs library to automate some of the vpncmd commands. It contains currently only a very small subset of the vpncmd: \nhttps://github.com/moatazelmasry2/softether.js\nI know this is not what you are looking for, but it is something. Feel free to add your functions there\n. @leden. your two PR have been either merged or closed. Can this issue be closed?. You can change the network adapter in windows directly, for example like here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7785874/setting-network-adapter-metric-priority-in-windows-7\nDoes that answer your question?. You can limit the number of concurrent Logins directly in Radius. \nPlease see these links:\nhttps://wiki.freeradius.org/config/Users\nhttp://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-users/2011-April/053160.html\nDoes this answer your question?. I can compile with no problems. Does this issue still exist. Which OS are you on?\n. I have just started studying SoftEther code, so I'm not the best to answer this, but here goes anyway.\nIt doesn't seem that difficult. SoftEther import libssl-dev headers and depends on their implementation. \nTo understand how a cipher is imported into SoftEther, do a text search on one of the famous ciphers, basically the cipher is defined and added to the list of supported ciphers. Example: \nsh\ngrep -rn \"AES-128-CBC \" *\nHope this helps\n. What is rtm??\n. Guys. Could you please all write in english so we can also understand. If this is not possible then please use the japanese forum on vpnusers.com. I got a tip from another issue on how to solve this issue\n- Start the program on the command line using: \"./bin/vpnserver/vpnserver execsvc\"\n- Attach the eclipse debugger as described here\nI wrote a tutorial on how to do that here:\nhttp://moatazthenervous.com/how-to-debug-softethervpn/\n. Hi NoahO\nYes SE supports both group 2 and group 5. But the server simply chooses the first Security  Association (SA) it can support and not the best.\nThis is actually quite easy to implement and in my opinion does not violate the ISAKMP RFC. \nDo you know whether IPSec implementations (like strongswan) choose the first or the best SA?\nCheers\n. @omlaverde thanks for the tip. Do you have a PR with this content??. @NoahO btw a PR got merged couple of weeks ago, that added higher DH groups. Is that what you are looking for?. @Noaho ah ok, I misunderstood. In this case this is not yet implemented but we definitely should. This looks great, and I'm currently reviewing your PR. If anyone else reviewed this and can give it a thumb up, I'll be able to merge this PR. I messed up yesterday's PR specifically by running\ngit pull --rebase tidatida-master origin/master\nWhile his commit remained at the top of the branch, doing a git push -f, pushed everything except his commit and I broke the PR.\nI'm hoping with the cherry picking to reduce the damage. This is exactly what I did last time, really line for line and word for word what you just wrote.\nand it broke the PR. . But I agree that cherry picking is also not the right way to go. I'll try again in future PRs to rebase\n. This time I'll do a regular merge of the PR into master, since in my opinion both squash or rebase would be wrong. Feel free to argue otherwise . Your great PR has been merged into the master branch. Thank you for your hard work. Ca you access the server logs??. +1 I think this is a must have feature\n. I'm not sure I really understood.\nYou connected using SoftEther client to some server. Then stopped the client. Now browsers are not working anymore. Is this what you mean?\nIf yes then please confirm that this issue still happens with the newest SoftEther client and Server. Also please provide more details, like which windows are you using. Your settings, etc... @chipitsine answer is correct. Closing. Dear dnobori, xortim  and others.\nFirst of all dnobori, thanks for all your efforts. This is truly an amazing project and it looks like you've been doing a lot of heavy lifting by yourself, so thank you very much.\nFirst of all, I think there should be a wider discussion on whether to go with option (1) or (2) and invite those who contribute or are willing to contribute.\nSame question goes for the issues/vpnusers. Why use subreddit? There are much better options like gitter, stackoverflow clones, simple email list, etc.. You get my point\nAll I'm trying to say is please take some time consider all options and involve many people that can bring something to the table, as these decisions will affect us as users/contributors for years to come. Most importantly, if planned right, this project will sky rocket and will benefit millions of users\n. @dnobori  this is not a bad idea, especially if you want to be the sole maintainer of the stable repo, since github doesn't allow to assign maintainers to one branch only, but to the whole repo.\nOne issue that everyone should think of about the 2 repo solution is the issue tracker. People will probably submit the same issue twice and we need to come up with a solution that this does not happen (or minimize it). Hmm. This could work, but what about errors that are in the stable repo but not in the dev repo. This could happen since patches will be applied here and there, so the code is not 100% identical. \nI'm just trying to cover the bad scenarios here. Are there any updates on this issue? Should there be a vote or a decision soon? An unstable/test/development repo will really help push this project forward . SoftEther Client only supports SoftEther own VPN protocol. So it is not feasible to support the import function of another protocol \nDid that answer your question?. @UkrZilla SoftEther should now allow changing the L2TP port 1701 because this is the official port mentioned in RFC 2661:\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2661\nYou are not supposed to use a VPN Server and client on the same machine. If you are doing this for test purposes only, then please use vagrant or docker . This conversation is 1+ years old. I can only assume by now that the issues section WILL NOT be closed. What I'd like to do here is explain explicitly in the README.md on github that any user questions will be deleted and the user will be referred to  the user forum. \n@dnobori Could you please provide some feedback here. As it looks like, the issue section on github definitely won't be killed, but I like to keep it for developer related questions, but not user related questions. As for vpnusers.com there's an issue #424  created recently and we should discuss there what to do about spam on vpnusers.com. I'd like to close this issue within the next few days if there are no pbjections.\n. @ghost . This could turn out to be a great feature, but please help me understand how this should be implemented. I'm not really aware of Cisco IOS. \nBut to my understanding if you want to get a redundant job done, like creating 500 hubs or adding thousands of users, then a script of some kind should be used. What you are describing here is a bit of quite wide use case. So how can we narrow (generalize) that a bit so that it is useful to the community???? . Your PR has been merged. Thank you for your hard work. This issue was opened long time ago. vpngate is working fine now. Thank you so much for your contribution to enrich the SoftEther VPN source code.\nYour patch has been merged on the main source-tree of SoftEther VPN.\nAs a token of our gratitude, your GitHub username will be added on the AUTHORS.TXT file. (It will be done within a few days.)\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/AUTHORS.TXT\nThanks again for your contribution.. You must start SoftEther as a root. . Hi there, I just tested this and I can not see any sevpnclient and all related SofEther client processes are closed when the client is closed. The client has to be closed by going to the bottom right side of the screen and close it and not just click on X in the SE client windows\nIf you are seeing this phenomena then my questions:\n- Which windows are you using?\n- Are you using the latest release of SoftEther? . OP did not answer in a while.  Closing this issue.. Hi @sanderux . As @MtCedarNet mentioned you can use the PushRoute option in vpcmd. Is this what you are looking for. This issue has seen no reply since a couple of month and I'd like to close it within the next few days if it remained inactive. I choose Option 1 for merging. I choose Option 1\nThank you. I choose option 1\nThanks. As far as I understand now, TLS is not supported in the OpenVPN server functionality. So no ciphers could be added\n. +1\nTotally agree\nAnd many thanks for your kind words. Please install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install -y build-essential libreadline-dev libssl-dev. Silly question. Is your debian 64bit OS?. Sorry, I really can't figure this one out. \nThe compilation should work fine though on debian8 and ubuntu 16.04\nThe only thing I can think of, is to run:\n\"sudo ldconfig\"\nand hope it sorts itself out. from the definition of ldconfig:\n\" ldconfigcreates the necessary links and cache to the most recent \nshared libraries found in the directories specified on the command line, \nin the file//etc/ld.so.conf/, and in the trusted directories \n(//lib/and//usr/lib/)\"\nsp hopefully if there are trivial errors in your shared libs, this \ncommand should fix them, so that SE would link successfully.\nOn 03/18/2017 05:33 PM, youxiaojie wrote:\n\nwhat did you point to?\nSorry, I really can't figure this one out.\nThe compilation should work fine though on debian8 and ubuntu 16.04\n\nThe only thing I can think of, is to run:\n\"sudo ldconfig\"\nand hope it sorts itself out\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub \nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/301#issuecomment-287557504, \nor mute the thread \nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEQBxSArB0yl_avIaxyiy7QVfu1nFeQ6ks5rnAc-gaJpZM4L_SAw.\n\n\n. Hi people. If I understood correctly the problem is through the comments:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/301#issuecomment-320073384\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/301#issuecomment-326389993\nResolved. \nAlso as looking at lines 13020 onwards, it looks like SoftEther is behaving as it should regarding old and new SSL. \nIf everyone is happy, I'd like to close this issue within the next few days. Could you please rebase your changesesontop of the current master branch. leave the versio (major, minor etc..) as they are in the master branch? I'd then be happy to merge your changes. PR #518 has been merged which introduces CMake. Please use this mechanism instead of mak files in your centos/ directory . Are you using radius? in this case the policy will be ignored. But you can configure that in Radius. Please see :\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/radius/manual/html_node/Multiple-Login-Checking.html\nDoes this help?. You can help by implementing radius accounting :)\nThere are some further options in Policy, like \"Number of simultaneous MAC Address\" or \"Number of sessions\". Sorry don't remember the names exactly, but try those too. :+1: . Could you please create a Pull Request so that it can be reviewed from the community?. I choose Option 1. Duplicate of issue #80 . Closing. Hi @zulzardi  and many thanks for reporting this. Would you like to create a pull request for this issue?. VPNGate plugin is not part of the source code. Hi @ghost. While I really do understand your frustration as I've also been frustrated for years about the status of this software, there are now some new board members for this project and we will try our best to revive this project. I'm well aware of the security issues you mentioned and I'm currently trying to create an overview of all security related issues.\nThat being said, the issue you created is not really an issue, or better said, there are other issues describing the security problems more detailed. No work can be done here, so I'm closing this issue.. Yes you are right. This block in this case is useless. @GildedHonour why was this ticket closed without resolving?. Ah. Thanks for the Tipp. Could you please mention these important Tips while closing a ticket? Thanks. Which VPN protocol?. Sorry I didn't understand that.\nDo you want to connect to SoftEther without username/password? \nor are you saying you are already able to connect so SoftEther WITHOUT username/password??. OP did not answer in a while.  Closing this issue.. Thank you very much for your patch. It is alot of hard work. And thanks @davidebeatrici  for the review.\nThere is one (big) problem with this change.  It looks like it is accepting any private key I provide as long at is the same length. \nHow to reproduce: Follow your guide in the PR description. Connect to make sure that things are working. then change one or more characters in the key file to any other arbitrary character and try connecting again, it will work . You are right. I verified this behavior by creating a second valid certificate and using the private key in my client configuration and SoftEther server successfully fails the authentication. You PR has just been merged into the master branch. As a token of gratitude, your name will be added to the authors lists. Many thanks for your hard work. It is really a great addition to SoftEther.. I did squash the commits\n. But if it is not my repo, then I can not edit it, or?. @chipitsine  Please do that\n@davidebeatrici  Thanks for the Info. Hi there. Thank you for your PR. Would you please consider using SHA256 or 5112 as default OPENVPN_DEFAULT_MD instead of RMD160?? since it is more standard. Thanks. @Hope4hope ping!!!. Hi there. I agree on the choice of the cipher, but not on the auth hash. I'd personally like to have SHA256 as the default auth because it is more standard and offers almost same speed.\nAlso could you please resolve the conflict in the pull request?. Hi @Hope4hope could you please update your PR according to:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/330#issuecomment-339487751. @Hope4hope Ping!!!. Hi @joshperry. Could you please rebase your PR on the current master, to benefit from the ci Environment we set up recently?. Thanks. @joshperry  Ping!!!. Also we have a new policy for accepting PRs. Could you please read that and answer the question:\nYour great patch is much appreciated.

This is an english forum. and so most of us do not understand Chinese and hence this post is not very useful for the community. Closing. Hi @hongquan under which OS/Environment is error happening?

(It will be done within a few days.)\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/AUTHORS.TXT\nThanks again for your contribution.. Duplicate of Issue #101 . Closing. Yes obviously everyone can contribute and create PR. The role of board members (to my understanding) is to review and merge PR.\nRegarding workflow, I also prefer having the master branch as the development branch and cherry pick the good changes into a stable release. This has proven to work quite well in many projects. But also will require certain amount of work from Daiyuu. @dnobori  Maybe it would be a good idea to involve the the new board members or the community in general while reviewing the Pull requests. This way everyone gets a feeling how a cooperative work in the future would look like. Hi guys. This task is done I believe. And if there are no objections, I'd like to close this issue within the next few days. Any objections??. what about cipher_list defined in \nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/Mayaqua/Network.c#L236\n?\nIn practice it is disabled, but it is still there and being used by a couple of functions. . This is a quite important PR btw so thank you for that and when merged, it will solve the following issues:\nIssue #147\nIssue #179 \nIssue #253\nIssue #264\n. ok. Thanks for the explaination and I agree. But I'm not really comfortable with giving invalid value to the default cipher and enforce SE to get something from SSL. It feels like a hack. Can we maybe define the cipher suites directly in the cipher_list variable to achieve the same result?. I really need a second opinion on this. @dnobori @SoftEtherVPN/softether-development-board-members  could you please review this PR and especially whether the introduced hack migh cause any vulnerability . I merged this finally into master. This looks to be working fine and an expected cipher is being choosen when connecting. \nThank you for your hard work. . @paulmenzel I could not find a PR with your code. \nI'd like to work with you guys on creating the first travis-ci for this project. . I'm also in favor of first committing something very simple at the beginning and hopefully more commits to follow. @SoftEtherVPN/softether-development-board-members  Please upvote so we can merge this. Thank you so much for your contribution to enrich the SoftEther VPN source code.\nYour patch has been merged on the main source-tree of SoftEther VPN.\nAs a token of our gratitude, your GitHub username will be added on the AUTHORS.TXT file. (It will be done within a few days.)\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/AUTHORS.TXT\nThanks again for your contribution.. I will contact Daiyuu to do that because I don't have enough admin rights. What do you mean about full radius support? Can you be more specific please. The OP seems to be inactive. For this reason I'd like to close this issue within the next few days if there are no objections. \nCheers. Well this is not clear from the issue description. Radius accounting is also requested in Issue #101 . \nI'd like to close this ticket as a duplicate. . What do you mean by server protocol? SoftEther supports both TCP and UDP connections. \nIf you are using vpngate and you append \"/tcp\" to the server's name it will connect using tcp. \nDoes this answer your question?. OP did not answer in a while.  Closing this issue.. Hi guys. Thanks for the info. Can we close this issue?. Also one more remark. @dnobori please give on the forum admin rights to some trusted users and allow them to ban people who post even one spam message. @fenice2 thanks for your kind words. Hopefully it will become better soon\nwith the forum situation\nOn Fri, Nov 24, 2017 at 3:39 PM, fenice2 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIt would be useful to have more admins, at least they could cover\ndifferent timezones and hopefully catch a few more spammers.

Please contact the maintainer \"Dmitry Verkhoturov\" of this PPA for further questions. I'm against spaces and I'm aware of the drawbacks. \nBut specifically for this project I'm against converting tabs to spaces or vice versa etc.. because this will also mess the blame log and will touch almost every line in the code.\n\nIf there are concerns about different tab settings in the editor, here's a suggestion we use in our company:\n1- Write down a developers coding guide, specifying exactly everything: brackets, spaces in conditions, new lines, etc..\n2- Offer code formatters for popular IDE's: Visual Studio, eclipse etc.. and let people download and configure them for SE developement. WDYT??. Small tip. Everyone usually selects Option 1 :). Hi @youxiaojie thanks for the hard work. I'm still in christmas/new year's mode. and will  be back on 8th of january. Will try to get it done then. Promise :). @youxiaojie yes please try to make it clear. Best to separe this pull request into multiple PRs where each one does exactly one thing only. Thanks. An easy way to achieve that is through OpenVPN which SoftEther supports.\nThere you can configure the client to reroute all traffic except a certain Set, or route only a certain Set of URLs. I know this is't what you asked for, but it is a solution.\nPlease see this answer:\nhttps://serverfault.com/a/631048/114877\nSummary:\n```sh\nredirect all default traffic via the VPN\npush redirect-gateway def1\nredirect the Intranet network 192.168.1/24 via the VPN\nroute 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0\nredirect another network to NOT go via the VPN\nroute 10.10.0.0 255.255.255.0 net_gateway\nredirect a host using a domainname to NOT go via the VPN\nroute www.google.ca 255.255.255.255 net_gateway\n```. Uploading the Release binaries to github is a great idea. Anzone know how to automate that? . @ann0see The link you posted is extremely important and the critique points in it should all be considered by the SE project. Thank you. Please thumb up the issue instead of writing +1 so it is easy to query the important issues\n. Guys. Thumb up the issue:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/369#issue-270786887\nNot my comment :). Experience has shown that changes on SoftEther website and forum are slow..\nSuggestion on the short term.\n\nI'll talk to Daiyuu and download the latest release of SE using my secure corporate network\ncreate a new release  on Github with the tag: \"Ver 4.24, Build 9651, beta\". This is the latest release on the SE Website\nUpload all binaries to Github\n\nSuggestion for the long Term:\nHave a travis-ci that creates releases on demand. I only  don't know whether this is possible!! . I'll first try to get PR #348 through the door and then maybe we can add release step to it. Hi guys I created release v4.24-9651-beta on github. It contains ALL the binaries found softether-download.com:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/releases/tag/v4.24-9651-beta\nYou don't have to trust me that those binaries are sane, please check for yourself by downloading the zips from softether-download.com and from github.com and compare the md5sum.\nWhile this doesn't resolve our need of having a stable pipeline able to deliver releases, the OP of this issue wanted a secure URL to download the binaries.\nThat being done, I suggest we clone this issue if the uploaded binaries are sane. Please test and provide feedback. Hi guys. I think this task is done. I'd like to close the issue within the next 2 days if there are no objections. Cheers. Are you trying L2TP or which protocol?. @Khsed4 There are already man L2TP Apps for Android and they can connect to SoftEtherVPN. What do you mean own VPN? Client or Server?\nAnyways this is not an easy task to implement own VPN Server like SoftEther\nor strongswan. Of course you can look at the source code and copy many\nclasses/headers. Why do you want to do that anyway??\nOn Wed, Nov 22, 2017 at 10:49 AM, Abdulkhaliq Seddiqi \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@moatazelmasry2 https://github.com/moatazelmasry2, thanks, man, can you\ndescribe more how can I use SoftEtherVPN project to implement my own VPN,\nthanks in advance.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/372#issuecomment-346298315,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEQBxcQ-sfBbMtwsNGhNZrctnoXLrh6Nks5s4-4PgaJpZM4QUNSA\n.\n.

Unfortunately there is no GUI client for Linux and it is not on a roadmap. Only  the standard linux VPN clients like OpenVPN or L2TP. \n\nIf you are talking about managing SoftEther, one solution is to use vpncmd:\nhttps://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/2.SoftEther_VPN_Essential_Architecture/2.6_VPN_Command_Line_Management_Utility(vpncmd)\nI will close this issue, since there's nothing to do here for now.\nCheers,\nMoataz . Hi @tidatida. Does this answer solve your issue. If so I'll close this issue within the next days . Removed the extra line. Both reviewers agreed to changes. Merging..... Let us say you are using SoftEther source code in your own project which\nalso include other libraries. It is possible that other libraries are also\nusing ADMIN_H or similar which will cause an error since the header files\nof SoftEther can not be included.\nOn Tue, Nov 21, 2017 at 7:49 AM, macvk notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nwhy you do it? can you please provide an example of conflict?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/381#issuecomment-345933236,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEQBxSZYyLLRVu00IWKN1KbvHovPRacFks5s4nKQgaJpZM4QlGOk\n.\n. What do @SoftEtherVPN/softether-development-board-members  think? Otherwise we can just close issue #3 without resolving. The header guard should not be defendant on the file path. Because the file might be moved to another directory and is forgotten to update the header guard. \nI understand the need for a longer guard, but I'd really like something less cryptic and easy to understand. Both SFT_ETH or SOF_ETH  are too cryptic. \n\nSo I'd like to use the Prefix \"SOFTETHER_\". \nAgree?? If so, please thumb up to this comment\n. Please thumb up or down this pull request. SoftEtherVPN works in China.\nWhat have you tried? which protocol? which setup etc..\nFor user related question, please use the forum http://www.vpnusers.com/\n. As far as I know the source code for VPNGate is not openly released, although it uses many headers, c files from SoftEther. \nAlso vpngate has nothing to do L2TP or OpenVPN. On android there are many L2TP and VPN clients that can be directly used with a SoftEtherVPN Server. \nClosing this ticket. Are you using Radius? In this case it is not possible to use an Email as a username. The reason for  is that Softether  uses the \"@\" sign to distinguish between hubs and to which Radius Server it should send the traffic, for example user@hub1 or @hub2. So I'm not really sure how to solve this problem without further discussion.. Ok. But nevertheless SoftEther is using the \"@\" sign internally to send the requests to the right hub. so you can not use this sign in this username. Some other characters are also not allowed like = or ! or ?.\nSorry there is nothing to do here. . Ok. But I'm not sure what kind of help you expect to get..\nImplementing a VPN client is not an easy task at all. You can start by reading the source code under Cedar/IPSec.c and IPSec_L2TP.c\nAlso you need to be able to read and understand RFCs, for example like 2661 (L2TP):\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2661\nand then port SoftEther implementation to Java.\nThere's already an android open source library for OpenVPN\nhttps://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn\nHope this helps\n . Yes. SE is in C and you need to port several files into Java (or Kotlin). But again, this is not an easy task at all. Good luck. Hi there. Thanks for your PR. I have a question, where in your code does ir say Allow UDP aceleration is by default true?. Silly question. What is the motivation of this PR? Or which Problem are you actually trying to solve?. Your great PR has been merged into master. As a token of gratitude, your name will be added to the list SoftEtherVPN Contributors. Again many thanks thanks. I know about SoftEtherPy but it is also true that there's no clear REST API for this project and it would be good to have some clean API or Documentation. @syshackmin SE as mentioned by @DevSidious  can push static route. Or is this not what you are asking for?. 1. Open SoftEther Server Manager\n2. Double Click on your hub name\n3.  Click on \"Virtual Nat and virtual DHCP Settings\"\n4. Click on SecureNAT Configurations\n5. Click on the static routing table to push\n6. Add whatever routes you want as described in that window\n. Hi there,\nnone of these projects are official resources. I'm the author of softether.js package but I unfortunately stopped developing this package.\nGood luck. Thanks for the great PR. Could you please then consolidate your changes with \nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN#how-to-get-the-latest-source-code-tree-for-developers\nadd any difference from this paragraph that you still don't have and finally delete this paragraph??. Please have a look at the link\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN#how-to-get-the-latest-source-code-tree-for-developers\nThis paragraph contains similarities to: src/BUILD_UNIX.md\nBut also it contains information that are not mentioned in src/BUILD_UNIX.md (for example ubuntu build instructions).\nSo this paragraph should be consolidated into src/BUILD_UNIX.md and removed from README.md\n. Hi Ilya, using travis-ci as own documentation is not a good idea, because not everyone is accustomed to travis-ci  format. So build documentation should be easy to find and read.\nFor this merging of documentation, I'm very confident that you are capable of finding a good solution. I think it is better to offer a solution and merge and then let others enhance our work, than to open a discussion before we actually have anything good to present. \nWhat I'm trying to do here, is to push you a little bit that you come up with a good solution. :)\nGood luck . @qbeukes that would be really good if you can submit a PR\nI thumbed up this PR.

Guys, why do you want to change version to 4.23. when already 4.24. is released on github?. Thank you very much for your PR. I just merged it. I'll try to get around updating the version in the changelog  sometime soon. As a token of gratitude, your name and github URL will be added to the authors list.Thanks and cheers. As mentioned, SoftEther OpenVPN does not currently support certificates. Closing this issue. @dnobori why does the #294 contain suspicious code?. PR #405 has been merged. Closing this issue. SE client only supports SoftEther own VPN protocol. It doesn not support L2TP.\n\nThat being said, there are several documentation out there on how to use an L2TP client on Linux, for example:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/StrongSwan\nhttps://www.elastichosts.com/blog/linux-l2tpipsec-vpn-client/\nhttps://support.hidemyass.com/hc/en-us/articles/202721466-HMA-Pro-VPN-PPTP-L2TP-setup-on-Linux-Command-line-\nGood luck. You can use OpenVPN and set the port to 80 or 443. Alternatively you can use SoftEther Own VPN Protocol. Hi.\nI just merged your changes into master. Unfortunately your original repository has been deleted, and so I couldn't merge your changes through github and hat to do it manually.\nThank you for your PR. As a token of gratitude, your name has been added to the authors list. Again many thanks for your PR.\nCheers. 1. I don't have a GUI right now, but you can change the preshared key on vpncmd via the command \"IPsecEnable\"\n2. I don't understand the question? What do you want to achieve??\n3. Currently there is no support as far as I know\n4. For L2TP you can not. For OpenVPN you can change port from GUI or vpncmd. Further sstp is supported over 443. For SE own protocol you can also use any port. Also it is possible to use dns or icmp for creating a vpn connection . @canusuck If you are happy with this answer, I'd like to close this ticket. 1. AFAIK there are no hard coded limits. You are only bound by your hardware capabilities\n2. What do you mean \"how can I receive only DNS Sweden\" ??\n3. How to connect correctly to Linux?? Question is not clear. What is the problem exactly. Are you aware of the project's documentation?\n4. ikev2 is not implemented. l2tp on SoftEther is quite safe since it is using ikev1(ipsec) transport mode for encryption. . If these answers cover your question, I'd like to close this issue within the next few days. Hi Paul,\nThanks for your feedback. I assume you mean the commits I made the last couple of weeks. Those are mostly not direct commits but a squash of pull requests. We as developers agreed to merge commits only if they have 2 thumb up, but we didn't agree whether to a) merge b) squash c) rebase.\nI personally prefer squash, since I can not force other contributors to only make self contained commits, and hence a merge or rebase might be full of garbage. But this is just my personal openion and I should have agreed with the community on the best way to go. Apologies for that. If this is a big issue for you, we should put this topic to vote and add it to the contribution guideline\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/SoftEther-VPN-Developers-Guideline-(DRAFT)\nCheers. @paulmenzel  my answJust because we have these great git features, doesn't mean we must use them :)\nOk. joke aside, we are still quite able to use most of those features when using squashing. A Pull request should be small and it should handle one problem only. In this case we consider all the commits in a PR as playground and squash them into one. You can still use git revert, cherry-pick and blame quite well in this structure.\nUse case 2: a pull request is really big, contains a large number of commits and is handling one big topic. Example: Initial commit of unit testing or implementing IKEv2. In this case I totally agree   that we should merge --no-ff, because one commit is simply too large to understand.\nDoes this make sense?. Guys, we really need to merge this asap for many reasons:\n- This is a security PR and it shouldn't be hanging around a long time\n- This has already been patched on the stable fork and a release has been already made\n- It does not make much sense that the unstable version is behind the stable version\nIf there are no objections until tomorrow, I will merge this PR. Sorry about being pushy. As announced, I merged this PR. I'll try to get this fixed quickly. How can I mimic/use your build pipeline?\n. What is the bug? Could you please add more description?. Hi @fenice2 no you are not wasting your time at all. I among many other people are also quite bothered with the status of the forum. Even @dnobori is bothered about it. There was a thread in the past about the forum and I think there's a general consensus to do something about it. Best approach is like you said to implement some modern forum software with spam blocking. \nWe should keep this issue open, until this issue is actually resolved. There are basically two solutions to this problem:\n\nMigrate the bbforum to a better modern forum software and keep all the posts\nMove to a hosted trusted service like github issues, stackoverflow, reddit etc.. but lose all the posts (they remained archieved on the frozen vpnusers.com of course)\n\nI personally prefer the second solution as it will surely stop the spam. I also would love to migrate somewhere else where bot fighting is daily bread, like github or stackoverflow. Hi @fenice2 and thanks for your suggestions. I'm not a forum moderator and I don't know much about moderating forums anyways, but the answer to your question is simple: \nIt is not a trust issue, but simply a time constraint issue. No one somehow has the time or capacity to solve this problem. I will try to reach out to Daiyuu and actually work on a root solution to this problem. \nMaybe in the mean time you can help me a little by first telling me the names of the plugins you use to fight spam.\n. @maksqwe Ah sorry, forgot something. Could you please answer the following question:\nChanges proposed in this pull request:\n - \n - \n - \nYour great patch is much appreciated. We are considering to apply your patch into the SoftEther VPN main tree.\nSoftEther VPN Patch Acceptance Policy:\nhttp://www.softether.org/5-download/src/9.patch\nYou have two options which are described on the above policy.\nCould you please choose either option 1 or 2, and specify it clearly on the reply?\n-\n. I added your name to the authors list. Again thanks for your contribution. I just squashed and merged your PR into the master. Many thanks for your hard work. . @nuxrg yes and no. I agree that blocking VPN really sucks and I'm quite aware of the implications of living under an authoritarian regime like in China since I spent a good portion of my life in Egypt and I know how this really sucks.  Also one of the reasons this project became quite popular in China and Japan is its ability to penetrate through firewalls and proxies. \nVPNGate opening for donation won't advance this project, since as far as I know they act as two separate entities.  Also please notice that the Chinese state has way more resources to spend than the developers of this project. \nIf you want this project to advance, then please review the issues and pull requests and give thumbs up if they are good and Invite your friends to do the same. There are some very good Pull requests here which are several years old and no one cared to comment or upvote them. \nOn a side note @nuxrg  and @aicochow if anyone of you understands traditional chinese then plese review the PR #154 :) Thanks. Hi @paulmenzel  you already did some work on this. Would you kindly create a PR with your changes from https://github.com/paulmenzel/SoftEtherVPN/commits/integrate-travis-ci ??.

Hi @paskal  I added the encrypted credentials to travis-ci and pushed.\nBut this will just push to your repository, how do you want to get a badge on github? Or you mean a badge from  launchpad?. Updated the credentials. Still getting:\nDeploy failed! Launchpad credentials invalid. 401. I had to remove the deploy snippet  so that it does not show SE as failing. I prefer to work on this issue in a separate branch\n. Hi @hww3  and thanks for your contribution. I don't have any solaris hardware around. Do you have any tips on how I can test your PR ??. This is a nice PR and I'd love to merge it. We need one more +1 to do that. Cheers. PR has been merged. Thank you for your hard work and the great addition/subtraction :). 1. Open SoftEther Server Manager\n2. Double Click on your hub name\n3.  Click on \"Virtual Nat and virtual DHCP Settings\"\n4. Click on SecureNAT Configurations\n5. Click on the static routing table to push\n6. Add whatever routes you want as described in that window. @tomgie This has been fixed on the master branch but not yet released in a binary. Please clone and build the binaries youself. Hi @chipitsine . Just add the other changes directly to this PR.\nThanks and cheers. Hi there. This is the Repo for SoftEther Software and not VPN Gate or relarted software. Please open this issue on their thread. \nvpnusers.com. Can you build from the source, then just execute the exe?. @aicochow  ping. Thank you for your PR. It has just been merged. As a token of gratitude, your name and github will be added to the authors list. Thanks again for your great contribution. . @girasarum  Nop I don't think so. First there is no capacity to implement it, unless you want to create a PR for that, you are welcome to do so.\nAlso where is this discussion on vpnusers?\nAlso we try to implement features that are most requested, i.e. most +1. This issue has none so far.\nCheers\n. A PR stands for Pull request on github.\nYes this is difficult to implement. There's nothing like \"fast and simple\" feature. Also The code of SE should remain as small as possible to decrease the surface of attack. So only features that are highly requested might be considered.\nAlso the reason no one is really willing to help you, is for two reasons:\n1- the way how you are asking for a feature\n2- This is already solved on the OS level. @qbeukes already gave you a thorough answer.\nAnother answer from me, is to use \"iptables -m owner\" to tag all packets coming/going through SE and then only allow packets through which have the right tag.\nI really hope this answers your question. Thank you for your PR. I just merged into the master branch. As a token of gratitude your name will be added to the contributors list.\nAgain thank you for your hard work. Which VPN protocol are you trying to use?. Right now we have some places in the code using /usr and others using /opt. We need to agree on one location and create a PR that changes all the paths on the SE code . The link to the issue is not correct. Please check. No. You can only create one VPN per Computer. Cool thanks. Did you add new commits or just overwrote the last commit. I can see your changes, but I can not see any new commits. Anyways I'll try to get this done today. Your great PR has been merged. As a token of gratitude, your name will be added to the list of contributors. Many thanks for your great work\n. Thanks for the explaination. That males sense. And thank you for your work. I'll merge this PR right away . Currently no. .vpnazure.net is hard coded into a header file. I'd be happy if you submit a pull request that solves this issue. What exactly is protocol id?. This might work, but this might break things for our japanese users, there's no way for me to verify that.\n@dnobori Could you please test this PR on your OS?. Also btw, musl knows eucjp encoding:\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/musl/latest/source/src/locale/iconv.c#L51\n. Yup failing on musl would be an acceptable solution to me. I built a couple\nof images Based on alpine last week and what I can say is that musl is\nshit. How about Installing gcc and removing it after compiling and linking\nSoftEther?\nThis simple fix might cause a problem to others.\nAs per developers guide:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/SoftEther-VPN-Developers-Guideline-(DRAFT)\nMUST NOT remove any features from the current SoftEther VPN in the default\nconfiguration setting. It is OK to add an opt-out configuration to turn off\na specific feature in the configuration file.\nOn Wed 30. May 2018 at 11:08, Ilya Shipitsin notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nso, we can detect musl during cmake part and disable build on musl, right ?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/474#issuecomment-393088172,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEQBxYUUXVEONUh7RsIJ6_-mY_ZlRwi9ks5t3mGZgaJpZM4TGyUn\n.\n. Ok, I'm a bit confused now. Is the problem happening at compile or run time??\n\nAnyways I thought earlier that you were not able to compile SoftEther at all. And I tried a bit to get it compiling, and here's what I did after some trials and errors.\n```bash\ndocker run -ti --network host alpine:edge sh\napk update\napk add cmake gcc git ncurses-dev readline-dev openssl-dev make zlib-dev g++ cmake\necho http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing >> /etc/apk/repositories\napk update\napk add gnu-libiconv-dev\ngit clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git\ncd SoftEtherVPN\nconfigure\nmake -C tmp\n```\nThis compiles fine without changing the code.\nBut again I'm not really sure this is what you are looking for.\nAnyways let me know.\ncheers. Without looking deep into the source code, no I don't think that anything other than RSA for user authentication is supported. Thank you very much for the quick fix. The commit has been squashed into master. We really need those travis-ci builds. Nothing to add here. Looks great and I was hoping for a long time, that someone will finally create a simple matrix for travis-ci. This will definitely make our life easier. \nI also totally agree that we need a a functioning build system, one that is capable of cross compiling obviousely build windows binaries among others. I'm considering cmake with wingw or so. \nAnyways I'm accepting your merge. Many thanks for your excellent work. . One question though, how did you do multiple commits and they appear here as one commit?. I thought that rewriting history is forbidden by default in github. @davidebeatrici thanks. It is indeed a bit dangerous. I'll just stick to squashing and rebasing commits when accepting a PR :)\n. Merged. Many thanks. I updated the title a bit. I hope this is ok. Thank you for your great PR. It has just been merged into the master branch. As a token of gratitude, your name will be added to the authors list. Again many thanks for your work.. Merged with gratitude. Did you add your changes as a new commit or overwrote the last commit. Becuase usually adding a new commit would trigger travis-ci. Anyways I restarted the job manually. Hi guys. Is this still a work in progress or is ready for review?. @davidebeatrici  could you please rebase one more time??. > Is this something that could be done without rewriting the server and client? I would be willing to work on it (C++ is not one of my strongest skills however) if I could get some guidance on how to proceed with the implementation.\nGood. Because the project is not written in C++\nJoke aside, it is a good suggestion and we should follow this path.. Daiuyy wrote in the developers guide, that he wishes the code to remain compatible to vc 2008\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/SoftEther-VPN-Developers-Guideline-(DRAFT)\nAppearantly this is needed to support Windows 9x and Windows NT 4.x binary linking, but I have little idea about compiling under windows. Can this be done by mingw? if yes then we might be able to even get ride of msvc 2008 altogether. The problem is how in the world can we automate this kind of compilation in travis-ci?. Didn't know about that. It looks quite nice, will definitely try adding it to SE. Could you please describe in details what problem  this PR is actually solving. What is the error in msvc? . Nice!!. Now we need this text in the PR description, plus hopefully the actual error message produced by MSVC. Sorry that was not my intention to close the PR, please give me a couple of minutes to fix that. yah I know. It looks like I kinda messed up his branch, I wanted to rebase your commits from appveyor under his commits like this:\n```\ngit checkout tidatida-master tidatida/master\ngit rebase master\ngit push --force tidatida master\n```\nThis resulted on pushing your commits, but deleting this commit. And although I still see his commit locally, I can not push it, since I'm getting \"everything is up to date\". Also creating a new dummy commit on this branch and push it, also has the same result. Yup looks like it. This one is messed up. Hi @tidatida Your changes have been committed through PR #499 \nCould you please choose Option 1 or 2 of the acceptance policy:\nhttp://www.softether.org/5-download/src/9.patch\n???\n. Chages worked like a charm. Many thanks. If you say you choose option 1, then this is enough. Thank you. Hi @maurerr . Does the answer from @davidebeatrici resolves your issue? \nBasically removing private/public key and use the correct server certificate should solve the problem. I agree that this issue should be fixed, but the dummy configuration has been there forever, so 83295bb does not really break openvpn. \nSo in my humble openion, there are two ways to go. Either this issue should be renamed to reflect the request it is adressing, or we close this issue and you can open a new issue requesting this dummy cert to be fixed. But in the current state, the title is misleading. But this behavior was there way before this commit happened!!. The behavior is wrong, but it has nothing to do with this commit. They are an example on how one can configure openvpn client. URL, port and credentials must also be adapted. . Merged. Thanks for your contribution. Ok, but shouldn't this issue be created in the stable fork?. Crap!. Ok. the problem is, there is not much we can do here. This issue is related to a different repo, and to my understanding Daiyuu will merge whatever he likes/wants from this repo into the stable repo. Best thing you can do is to mention @dnobori and hopes he has time to respond to this issue . @davidebeatrici would you then like to amend this PR? or do you want to create a new one?. ok, could you then please mark it as WIP until you are done?. Also could you please add a build badge to README.md ?. Cool. This time, I'd actually like to rebase these commits into the master branch instead of squash, since each commit is actually self contained and achieve one isolated task. Agree?. Cool. Then please adapt the version in .appveyor.yml as agreed and we can merge :)\n. Yah sorry, I deleted the review by mistake. \nYah I was exploring appveyor yesterday and created the project there. But this should have no effect on your build, right?\nI'm ok with the fact, that SoftEther is building in your appveyor, and can keep it that way initially. \nAnd to my understanding, build-{build}-{commit} works. or no?\n. build-{build}-{commit} is fine. Ah ok. then we can use my appveyor for the time being, until we agree on the others on how to actually manage this kind of stuff, in case me or Daiyuu died tomorrow :). It turned out that I should not login into appveyor using my github, instead create a new account using username/password then add authorize apveyor to use github. I just rebased your changes and I'm really excited about them. Many thanks for your hard work. Done. Nice. Thank you very much. I just squshed your PR into master. @chipitsine are you sure the rpm spec file is referencing files under src/ ?\nLooking at https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/centos/SPECS/softethervpn.spec#L73\nIt is referencing files that only exist under the root directorly like AUTHORS.TXT !!. Cool. Thanks and have a nice vacation. Ok cool. Will try to get it done today. Still need to fix some merge conflicts and change a version number in in PR #302 before doing that. Are you aware of anyone using this spec files??. How about setting up separate repos for Fedora, Debian etc.. as they don't necessarily belong to the core SE Codebase? . Could you please rebase your changes ontop of the current HEAD?. Yes sorry. My mistake. I just fixed it. Looks very good. Merged. With gratitude. No time to remove and reinstall MSVC without windows driver kit for test purposes. \nI will just merge this PR :). Thank you :+1: . Merged. Many thanks for your great contribution!!. Merged with gratitude. Hi @dnobori in the future when you merge a Pull Request, could you please the \"Squash and commit\" functionality of github instead of merge whenever possible? This keeps the history linear and somehow better to read. Thanks. Looks good. Merged with thanks!!!. Yes I also support switching to Apache or so for obvious reasons. But i'm also afraid that you won't be able to get the approval of ALL contributors to this project, not even 50%. Probably most people won't see or will ignore this thread.\nSo my humble suggestion would be, when a good chunk of contributors agree on this move, is to announce the switch and ask anyone with objection to come forward, otherwise we switch one one month or less. You guys also need to reed some forums about switching, pros and cons. so that there is no misunderstanding there. GPL -> Apache/BSD is not always easy.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1409666/switching-license-from-gpl-to-bsd-in-later-time\nhttps://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/304/can-i-take-bsd-licensed-code-and-distribute-it-under-gpl\nhttps://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/75436/relicense-bsd-2-3-clause-code-to-gpl. Also there is always the dual license option. I'll try to my best to get this reviewed today evening or tomorrow.. Yup. I also would love to have a build system that sucks less as soon as possible. And then start enhancing it. Many thanks for the exploitation. Your PR has been merged . Nice. But I'd have prefered that this PR be integrated using Squash and merge, instead of merge, because then the whole PR would be added as just one Commit. Thank you very much for this great PR. I'd have preferred that the code checks whether there is a server certificate already available and paste it in the sample configuration, else leave the block empty as you did it. But this could be done in a separate PR and this one actually solves Issue #492 .\nThanks and regards. Ah now I see what you mean. Cool. Thanks. Merged. Many thanks for your hard work. This is a very good PR. If someone else can review and approve/thumb up this PR, then I can merge it. Thanks @dnobori for pointing this out. We really need unit and integration tests.... @davidebeatrici could you please add a WIP prefix to the title or close this PR if you are not working anymore on that?. Thanks for reporting this. Please compile from the master branch of this repository and let us know if you are still getting the same error. @SquirrelCoder could you please clone this repo and compile from the master branch. This should compile fine. Merged. With gratitude. Merged. Many thanks for your hard work :+1: . Is this an issue or a PR??. Looks good. Thanks alot for your PR. As a token of gratitude, your name will be added to the authors list. Again many thanks and all the best. I left the URLs there because in my opinion it is  nicer to be able to read these URLs directly instead of blue heighlighted text. But this is pure subjective opinion, so I don't really know what most people prefer. How did you Download the source code?? From this git repo??\nOn Thu 24.

Also this issue is not the right place to have this discussion (in my opinion). Please create an issue for that if necessary.. @Adrian-Voelker  Has your problem been solved?. Merged.

Cool. Could this be added to linux installation documentation please. \n. @youxiaojie as mentioned by @davidebeatrici I was hoping you'd create a separate PR for each self contained logical change you wanted to merge in the PR, which I waited to happen, but unfortunately didn't.\n\nSo honestly I don't know how this problem could have been avoided, since @davidebeatrici  and maintainers can not just review all closed/open PRs to make sure there are no similarities with other PRs.\nThat your PR was open for 8 months is definitely unfortunate, and it is a topic I apologized for several times on many PRs, but the fact is this project remained inactive almost for 3 years and no PRs were reviewed/merged which is something the current maintainers are trying to enhance.. I'm for merging this PR as is for now and have the improvements in a separate PR. The feature is not really clear to me from that link. Could you please describe here what \"start before logon\" does?. If tmp is not being used anywhere, then its definition should also be deleted. this list is quite different from cipher_list and I wounder how/why you choose those ciphers and not others used in cipher_list??. Could you also please translate this page?. Could you also please use the number \"4\" because another PR will take the number \"3\". I don't know much about travis-ci but according to the documentation, it is defined as \"cache: ccache\"\nhttps://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/\n. Also there's the comment:\n\"to cache $HOME/.ccache and automatically add /usr/lib/ccache to your $PATH.\". Please remove the tmp variable. Why did you move those three lines to the bottom of the list? It was by intention that the list is alphabetically sorted. List should be alphabetically sorted. And where is the dependancy on zlib for Redhat?. Why 23? 24 has already been released. 9651 has already been released. Question: How did you find this list?. This function is implemented at src/Cedar/VLanUnix.c line 388. So the definition should also be under: src/Cedar/VLanUnix.h. If OS_WIN32 then else OS_WIN32 ?? The comment after \"else\" does not make sense. Which problem does this line solve???. Why libncurses5-dev? libncurses-dev is a meta package and it refers to libncurses5-dev. Please append your changes as line 1, but do not delete already existing lines. Why was dest removed from the check? dest-Session is used in the later check. There's no way for the compiler to know about the actual value of this variable at compile time.. Same here. Why was s != NULL? check removed? There's no way for the compiler to know about the actual value of this variable at compile time.. Why was this check removed. p is being used directly inside the if condition. If dest is NULL, dest-Session will cause a segmentation fault. More specifically, it leads to undefined behavior, meaning that it might work, or it might crash. We will never know . How about build-{commit-sha1} ??. Could you also please specify the image used explicitly? This way it is clearer for everyone. I think Visual Studio 2015 is the default or?. I haven't tested this, but can you tell me whether really Other versions of Visual studio are currently supported? I can not for example compile SE on VS 2008 Express. I don't doubt that. My question was whether you can compile SE using MSVC 2008 Express? So far I didn't manage to do it, and I'm downloading the MSVC 2008 + SP1. It is complaining about missing afxres.h. Googling a bit shows that this header is part of the MFC which is not included in MSVC 2008 Express. But Stackoverflow also says that replacing this header file with windows.h should solve the problem.\nMy point is, until we actually are able to compile SE under each MSVC successfully, we should not remove the warning under BUILD_WINDOWS.md. Let me try that. Give me a couple of minutes. I'm not really a windows guy :(. You were right. My bad. After installing windows driver kit, the project is compiling. Under Visual Studio 2008, this project compiles without windows driver kit. Right? This is only needed with MSVC Express. Or?\n. Or MSVC 2008 Express, in combination with Windows driver kit. String comparison in bash is done using single 'equal '=' not double euqual.\nAlso please Use [[ and ]] instead of [ and ], because double square brackets will throw an error, if an undefined variable is used, single square bracket will just continue. Please add a '-y' just in case you get a prompt. Here also [[ and ]]. [[ and ]] . [[ and ]]. [[ and ]]. True to the \"set -e\". Nevertheless [[ and ]] is the standard format for a safer code.\nI'd personally leave the comparison as is, since it is then self explaining. Why is markdown link not used here as well?. Ok I understand the problem. I prefer to do the renaming separated in its own PR. In this case, please rename all TXT files that should have been .md, for example:\n- AUTHORS.TXT\n- LICENSE\n- THIRD_PARTY.TXT\n- WARNING.TXT\nAlso in my openion, all these text files (except README.md) should not have all capitalized letters in their names. This is a merge conflict tag. Why is this included in the PR?. Is this related to refactoring the build process?. Is this related?. Why are AES_128 and SHA1 been removed? they are currently used in running setups, and this change will probably break them. Please add not replace. Unless the algorithm is really broken from a security POV. Why RMD160 ??. There are binary matches for \"CommomDev\" in src/BuildFiles/Library. As I'm not familier with this part of the code, I'm afraid this might break things. Please revert or confirm and explain why it won't break things. Korean language has been added to SoftEtherVPN which contains the old strings \"CON_AMBIGIOUS_CMD_*\". Please rebase and also fix the keys in the Korean language. Please rebase on master and fix for korean language. Please fix for Korean language. Please fix in the korean language. Please fix in the Korean language. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Add to Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix indention, so that the number is vertically aligned with other numbers. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Fix in Korean. Yes Please revert here and create own distinct PR. You will be amazed what types of computers and setups are using SoftEtherVPN :). So I learnt not to change a standing behavior.. Why do you need cmake for runtime?. Should't the program exit here?. Just remove the whole snippet. It is a dead piece of code anyway.\nIf we needed this snippet in the future, it is still saved in git history. Please keep the release at \"1\".\n. Are there coding rules defined anywhere for SE?. There was a nice code convention format I saw couple of weeks ago, where you define one set of rules and they are understood by most IDE's. Need to search for it. Found it:\nhttps://editorconfig.org/#file-format-details\nThis one offers a universal format and could be used through multiple IDE's. OK guys. Let's just define an editconfig file. Ideally using either gnu or linux kernel format or so. ",

Who rules the process?\n@oferchen sorry, but this is russian idiom having no sense to translate.\n. Hi @dnobori!\nI can provide you with an access to our test/demo server so you could check it in real life what the problem is. Would you?\n. apt-cache search libreadline\nlibreadline-dev\n. @oooo1 did you get IP 1.0.0.1 when used an exteral DHCP server or the SE built-in DHCP server?\n. @collaboratorscollaborators why do you think you was attacked? any logs?\n. OK.\nNow my question goes further. For the past few days we have done several tests and find out that the tap interfaces created externally, i.e. tunctl, are not accessible by SoftEther and these tap interfaces cannot communicate with SoftEther Server. Generally, it means no type of traffic can pass via this type of interface. On the other hand, tap interfaces created by SoftEther (vtun.sourceforge.net library used by SE) are OK.\nSo, the questions are - what is the difference and why we can't use tunctl to manage tap interfaces externally?\nRegards.\n. @dajhorn Thanks for your note, will try this way.\nAnyway, we use tunctl as a system utility to manage all tap interfaces (one host has about 100 taps) and it is s real hassle to manage them from SoftEther console.\n. Are you talking about L3 routing topology?\n. Did you try this http://www.softether.org/4-docs/2-howto/1.VPN_for_On-premise/3.LAN_to_LAN_Bridge_VPN or this http://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/A.Examples_of_Building_VPN_Networks/10.5_Build_a_LAN-to-LAN_VPN(Using_L2_Bridge) or this http://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/A.Examples_of_Building_VPN_Networks/10.6_Build_a_LAN-to-LAN_VPN(Using_L3_IP_Routing)?\n. Hi.\nPlease take a look here http://www.softether.org/4-docs/2-howto/2.VPN_for_Cloud/4.Cloud_to_Cloud_Bridge_VPN\nWhich one is yours?\n. Hi @petergsnm.\nCan you show what exactly you did read that allows you to state that \"clustering is not possible in cascade connection scenario\"? Are you talking about a bridged connection or...?\n. https://www.softether.org/index.php?title=4-docs/2-howto/9.L2TPIPsec_Setup_Guide_for_SoftEther_VPN_Server/1.Setup_L2TP%2F%2F%2F%2FIPsec_VPN_Server_on_SoftEther_VPN_Server#Start_VPN_Server_Manager\nOn the Server Manager, you can see the \"L2TP/IPsec Setting\" button.

Sorry, @oferchen.\n@ksimonenko, very small percent of translation is complete. My advise is to take some part of a data, for example, installer text, translate it and push to my repository - I'll review and accept updates.\n. @hongquan, it's updated daily, just the version number is crippled because it's never updated in the code.\n. I'll swap it now, aarch64 will break as a result of unmerged #281.. It could be corrected only in this repository by @dnobori but he never did it before. You should open a separate issue and ask him update build files versions as well when he does new release, probably.. Including package to Ubuntu mean including it first to Debian. Including new package to Debian is a hard work, and even bigger work is maintaining it up-to-date in there. I don't think it will happen in the near or distant future, in last 4 years noone interested in getting it done done anything to actually make it happen, PPA is the best thing I could come with.. @dglushenok, after latest merges there are conflicts, could you please fix your patch?. @dnobori san, could you please merge that?\nSame problem stays for Debian files \u2014 I'm maintaining a PPA (https://launchpad.net/~paskal-07/+archive/ubuntu/softethervpn) and minor version is still 9412 \u2014 I've already got questions why version is so old, while actually it's built from latest github commit.\n. I'll appreciate a lot if this will be merged today as well, @dnobori.. Could someone please merge that? We'll have arm build in Ubuntu PPA then.\n. I'll enabled new architecture build in PPA today, build rules are messed up and should be fixed (not a result of this particular commit).\nError message:\n```dh override_dh_auto_configure \nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/<>'\n   dh_auto_build -a\n   dh_auto_test -a\n fakeroot debian/rules binary-arch\ndh binary-arch \n   dh_testroot -a\n   dh_prep -a\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpnbridge.substvars\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpnbridge..debhelper\n    rm -rf debian/softether-vpnbridge/\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpnclient.substvars\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpnclient..debhelper\n    rm -rf debian/softether-vpnclient/\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpncmd.substvars\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpncmd..debhelper\n    rm -rf debian/softether-vpncmd/\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpnserver.substvars\n    rm -f debian/softether-vpnserver..debhelper\n    rm -rf debian/softether-vpnserver/\n   debian/rules override_dh_auto_install\nmake[1]: Entering directory '/<>'\npatch -f < debian/makefile.patch\ncan't find file to patch at input line 3\nPerhaps you should have used the -p or --strip option?\nThe text leading up to this was:\n\n|--- Makefile   2014-02-04 21:20:33.422762017 +0000\n|+++ Makefile.old   2014-02-04 21:20:10.298761727 +0000\n\nNo file to patch.

Can be closed.. @dnobori, could you please merge this one? That's a real problem for all Ubuntu \\ Debian users and we need to fix it before [introducing package to Debian repo](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=757746#35).. It's preventing newly installed vpnserver service from start, and package doesn't count as installed properly. Very trivial change, please merge.. I guess there is no need for separate issue apart from #276. Let's resolve this one, @DDGo?. @dnobori, that really fixes build for aarch64, I've tested it, could you please merge? I've built packages with it in https://github.com/paskal/SoftEtherVPN-debian.. It's because once you've sent some version to launchpad, you can't reupload it for rebuild and only way is forward. I hope softether vpn will close the gap someday, I can't revert version in PPA now.\nStatus is won't fix for now.. Yes, this issue have nothing to do with this very repo.. #281 merged now, please test again.. Could you please prepare a merge request with your commit then? It will greatly increase the chance of this fix going into upstream.. Please, select an option from link mentioned in your initial message - otherwise patch coudln't make it to the upstream.\nUPD: just write \"I am ok with [option 1](http://www.softether.org/5-download/src/9.patch#Contribution_option_(1):_Allowing_us_to_apply_the_same_patch_into_PacketiX_VPN._(Default))\" or \"option 2\". Everyone around choose first one.. @moatazelmasry2, could you please take a look if it could be merged now?. @youxiaojie I am not a maintainer, it's better to ask @moatazelmasry2 opinion. However, from my POV it's quite complex - at least you should write a summary, what your merge request is about.. I am wondering if someone will finally update version in deb and rpm configuration files. My [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~paskal-07/+archive/ubuntu/softethervpn) have version ` 4.04.9412` which is around since the first introduction of debianisation and noone ever updated it.. bash\n\u279c  SoftEtherVPN git:(master)  fgrep 4.04.9412 . -r\n./debian/changelog:softether-vpn (0:4.04.9412-rtm) unstable; urgency=low\n./centos/SPECS/softethervpn.spec: Wed Jan 29 2014 Dexter Ang thepoch@gmail.com - 4.04.9412-2\n./centos/README.md:2. This was tested using sources for version: 4.04.9412. I'll try and update this as new versions come out.\n``. I'll be super-happy if you'll updatedebian/changelogandcentos/SPECS/softethervpn.specwith version4.23-9647` which is current - it will update all the 3rd-party build numbers we have out there. Even changing just this number without any additional changes will help.\nYou won't believe if I tell you how many times I was asked \"why you are building so old version, 4.04 when current is 4.\".. Things are just wrong now. If you want, add your name, current date and normal version. Or even paste and format a proper changelog for a few recent versions.\nIf you'll just modify the version number and won't touch anything else at all, I'll be same happy.. Here you can find actual builds for Ubuntu: https://launchpad.net/~paskal-07/+archive/ubuntu/softethervpn. I believe this broke armhf builds: build, log.. I guess you could create code import for your repository and build same pipeline around it. Here is the code and \"recipe\" for building it.\nIt's complex, but general steps are\n 1. set up code import from github\n 1. set up build pipeline (for this fix armhf for latest Ubuntu version is enough)\n 1. change code and import it in interface to trigger build.. Here are travis-ci instructions, contact me by email (in github profile or in cv if it's not there) to get credentials for initiating build.\nI guess it's nice to know what current version of code have working builds for previously-working architectures on Ubuntu.\nUPD: I've got the keys, but they require someone with write access to travis configuration to be encrypted and then added to .travis.yml (travis encrypt doesn't work for me):\ndeploy:\n  provider: launchpad\n  slug: \"~paskal-07/softether-vpn/+git/SoftEtherVPN\"\n  oauth_token:\n    secure: \"<have to be generated from plaintext>\"\n  oauth_token_secret:\n    secure: \"<have to be generated from plaintext>\". armhf builds for all supported Ubuntu version (https://code.launchpad.net/~paskal-07/+archive/ubuntu/softethervpn/+packages) on Launchpad.\nI think this issue should be reviewed, a lot changed since March.. To clarify, here are build logs for arm64 and armhf - first one is OK, second one failed.. It's armv7l and it started working suddenly. Resolving this issue.. Builds in PPA still fail from time to time, could someone who have access over repo contact me for credentials to enable badge \"build success\\failure\" at least over master branch? Creating tests builds over PRs is separate matter and I can't help with that, but I know for sure when master is broken and I want everyone to know that.. \nThis should notify you of errors from this moment, I guess. However something is wrong with creds:\nDeploy failed! Launchpad credentials invalid. 401\nhttps://travis-ci.org/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/jobs/350054996. Launchpad deploy is not what I've had in mind, and there is no badge for build (because there are many builds for different architectures and OS versions). Closing this one, checking arm build is discussed in #432 and fix for current situation is #462.. By the way, builds are still broken.\n\n. Looks good to me. Sadly I have no idea how to get badge working with Launchpad builds.. Builds are failing, by the way: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/384967572/buildlog.txt.gz. Builds are still broken.. I am. The problem Davide mentioned is unsolved, and also some harmful things happened lately (especially this very issue) and unknown amount of them is still there (builds are behaving badly under different platforms).\nI'm thinking of forking this repo, making in-place fixes to get builds working, and leaving it in such state for the time being until there will be security updates to merge. Current contributors team choose something else over stability and I think it's cheapest way to fix things for Ubuntu users.. At this very moment absence of debian directory breaks things, if I got it correctly I could just attach it from another repo (as well as submodule, maybe), and it will work. I'll check it this week.\nThanks for the work you're doing! I think we should introduce more tests to make sure build-related things are stay in some known positions and won't run away from us once more:). Hooray, I've fixed it in Launchpad by nesting it before the build! So Launchpad is not an issue anymore.. Yes. Now it fails in different place, I'll try to finally fix it.. Debian folder restored from last available before deletion version and now lives in separate repo. For now it successfully builds packages.\nI think we could include a note to readme what in case of trouble with Ubuntu packages people should create issues in my repo.. It won't affect Ubuntu builds, however it seems it should fix Andy's problem.. Please don't merge things with red cross and merge things with green flag only, otherwise you break builds for everyone including Launchpad and that's something I beg you to avoid in the future.\nLaunchpad is not a part of test pipeline: existing test clearly stated what mentioned commit (ec7a9d7281d7a595491e02ed450b71a1c8c73ad2) build is broken: .\\Tracking.c(891): error C2059: syntax error : ')'\n@davidebeatrici, it would be nice if you'll agree on that.. I'll switch to next release available and will update it manually from time to time then.. Done, thank you. I'll need to sync the version with the release when it will be out, through.. I don't want to be rude, but \"works on my machine\" is something I wouldn't expect to hear on the project of this scale, I think we should care just a little bit more.. Should we maybe upload generated deb files from GitLab CI/CD instead of building them in Launchpad? That way new versions will be uploaded as soon as they are ready and we won't have appendix of debian folder in separate repo.. 3. we can include init files as a fallback for 12.04 and other systems without systemd.\n4. The upload is pretty easy\nBut because of 2) it's preferable to start doing this after cross builds will be possible, otherwise we can't switch to self builds.. https://github.com/paskal/SoftEtherVPN-debianisation/issues/6 is the same, is it supposed to be fixed in upstream?. @davidebeatrici @chipitsine current location is an issue for debian:\nFound files in /usr/local (must be in /usr).\ndebian/softether-common/usr/local\ndebian/softether-common/usr/local/lib\ndebian/softether-common/usr/local/lib/libcedar.so\ndebian/softether-common/usr/local/lib/libmayaqua.so\ndh_builddeb.pkgbinarymangler: dpkg-deb --build debian/softether-common .. returned exit code 1\nI'll switch it to /usr/lib for Ubuntu PPA and suggest you do the same.. It's against Debian standard which is why Ubuntu PPA build refuses to do so. Quote:\n\n/usr/local/ : Tertiary hierarchy for local data installed by the system administrator. Local data installed by system administrator means something which is brought manually, not by packages: no standard Ubuntu package write to this folder.\nAlso an issue I've bumped into: I can't use this repo tags because they are not correct version number from dpkg-buildpackage POV:\ndpkg-buildpackage: warning:     debian/changelog(l1): version 'v5.01.9665~201812020153~ubuntu18.04.1' is invalid: version number does not start with digit\nLINE: softether-vpn (v5.01.9665~201812020153~ubuntu18.04.1) bionic; urgency=low\nBecause of this I need to maintain my own versions. Could you please use tags without \"v\" in future?. Thanks a lot!. I'm sorry, I've looked into it and it looks like there is no elegant way to fix things. I think current state is good and shoudln't be altered because this problem solving will add complexity but will give no value in return. Resolving, if noone minds.. I like your debian packages naming and I think you can use it for all platforms.. \n",

We have operated a small company in Japan since2004. I made SoftEther 1.0 in 2003 (the older version, Japanese only). After that, Mitsubishi Corporation (aJapanese giant) offered me to make an exclusive sales contract of SoftEther 1.0 for 10 years. I was 19. Iaccepted the agreement without consideration, as a person (not company). The agreement says that I mustnot release any freeware which might compete to Mitsubishi Corporation's version of SoftEther CA(commercial version for enterprise market) until April 2014. So we hesitate to release the function forenterprise-use, to avoid legal problem.

The next thing will be moving from C++ to Python, I guess. \n\nMr Nobori must say 1. and 2. is the rules but not something for discussion. . @cdcseacave what is \"certain targets\", what you mean? certain applications? or certain networks? or certain IPs? . It is impossible now to disable route replacing. but I can add this \"feature\" to SE (add option in vpn_client.config). \nI can't understand why you need this. if the routes not changed, then Windows will not route any traffic through VPN client adapter. are you sure you need this?. @cdcseacave as I can see in your routing table, you have 2 default gateways. SE tries to delete old default gateway just after successful connection to VPN server. In your situation SE can't delete your old default gateway. Maybe restarting SE which admin privileges will solve this issue. You shouldn't have 2 default gateways!  Also try run \"netsh winsock reset\" from command line and restart your computer. Or run \"route delete 0.0.0.0\" and then turn off and then turn on WiFi adapter (this will reset default gateway).\n. What I need, and what I think is the primary purpose for a VPN usage, is to route only the traffic having as destination an IP in the local IP address space set by the VPN. All the other traffic to be routed through the default network on the PC. Is there a way currently to do that?\n@cdcseacave: What is this \"an IP in the local IP address space set by the VPN\"? Do you set this space somewhere manually or what? where is described this \"space\" which must be set by the VPN? As a far as i know every vpn in windows tries to route all traffic through itself. this belongs to L2TP, IKEv2, OpenVPN .... @cdcseacave 10.1.11.x - where is this described? in DHCP server? you can't have two active DHCP servers. you can't have two default gateways which is installed by two different dhcp servers. . @cdcseacave this is not my client ;) and client does not do anything with routes. routes are managed by windows.. @cdcseacave I can do it. but it is strange behavior because every VPN tries to hook all traffic. and almost every users need exactly routing all traffic through vpn. But you need the opposite routing only a piece of traffic... so your internet connection will not use VPN and therefore your internet connection wouldn't be secured.. @Xenos13 sorry there isn't easy way to do it. what OS do you use for server?. don't be paranoid, guys. if you use windows or skype or facebook or any famous antivirus - you are already watched. Android and iOS watches you too.. @NoahO really? how often you was attacked this way? I think less that zero times. on the other hand google play store is full of viruses. \nP.S. I'm just downloaded SE binaries and see that binaries has digital signature by Softether, So when you start SE application, Windows will warn you about digital signature. if signature is correct the warning message will be blue and if signature is wrong - windows will show red warning.

I agree to changing the license.. Hi\nyou didn't show routes without vpn. do you connect from windows? it seems like route to dns server was added from outside (by your isp software for example). i recomend to change dns server on every network adapter in your system to opendns or cloudflare dns servers. As far as I know windows detects all available dns servers in the system and then use them in random order. so the only way to get rid of the dns leak is removing all \"leaking\" dns servers from the system. \nif you use linux as a vpn client. you can use command line tool for dns leak test https://github.com/macvk/dnsleaktest \nI think in the linux environment you should do the same - remove all leaking dns servers from the system. \nse software dosen't change routes. it's done by linux or by windows (by your system) automatically. it's pushed by dhcp server...\nin you first screen you have two default gateways. it seems strange... . in my opinion it looks absolutely useless. . I mean the whole tool is useless. ). buildutil uses some local SOAP server for signing. Unfortunately there is not so much info about this SOAP server. You can find its description in \"HvSignService\" folder of BuildUtil. \nUsually signtool is used for signing windows applications. you can find signtool.exe in MS Visual Studio distributive.\nBut the main problem is not in signing itself but in certificate.\nTo sign a kernel mode device driver you need a EV code signing certificate (700 USD anualy). To get EV cert you need a registered company with active bank account. so everything is in your hands .... I  see here no deprecated functions.\n. > \n\nTravis is failing\n\nI don't think so.

How to deal with \"road warriors\" ? i.e. people who use own devices to connect to vpn ? no GPO, nothing.\nfrom that point of view, GPO is not very usefull (but I would to hear that I'm wrong). what I think is really more usefull is chocolatey or oneget package. as for myself, I doubt about GPO/Applocker (we use it actually).\nhowever, SE VPN would definetely like to learn something from you. do you have some best practice to share ? wiki / md / rst ?. what would prevent from crashing ... it could be some unit test :)\n\"This bug in EncryptPassword() MUST NOT be modified\" --> \"this must be covered by unit testing\" ?.

I do not agree with your PR, it is overcomplicated from my point of view. However, you can make your own PR.  I made my own PR which I am happy about.\nif there's something wrong with commit message, please be more detailed. @paulmenzel , I do not insist on gcc-4.8.4, from my point of view it makes some sense to test in \"the most popular environments\", something like running \"centos6,7 ... ubuntu 16.04 ....debian 8,9\" in docker and use compilers provided with certain distributive.\nfrom this point of view, both 4.8.4 and 7.X do not make a lot of sense because ubuntu trusty is pretty outdated.\nas I said earlier, I'd leave \"matrix expansion\" to other collaborators :) as soon as it is merged, there'll be some buzz around it, stay tuned :). @moatazelmasry2 , can you also enable this repo on https://travis-ci.org ?. I noticed that launchpad is newer :). we are going to release next week. we can take, for example, 5.01.9663. I doubt we should take numbers from stable repo. it has its own release cycle. even if we set 9669 next week, what we have to pick for the next release?. @paskal , can we close this issue ?. Usually, people cannot agree on tabs or spaces\nMaybe, separate forks for tabs and spaces? Otherwise, it will never end. closing in favour of https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/462. pardon, what difference are you talking about?. well, both of paragraphs are correct.\ncurrently, I do not know how to \"merge\" those into good consistent documentation. I'll think about it later (or maybe someone else ?)\nactually, I have another idea, as long as we are getting more travis-ci and app veyor, those ci are build documentation itself. probably, we'll get rid of markdown someday. or we can open an issue with \"help-wanted\" tag regarding further \"merging\" of documentation, what do you think?. well, I did not write those paragraphs, why are you asking me to rewrite them ?. I'd say, what are you asking is beyond the scope of my current PR.\nI'm ok if you will rewrite them.. as a side note - clang is also ok, not only gcc. the question is answered.\ncan we close the issue ?. as for freebsd, I'd try installing from ports.\n(some time ago I was using SE VPN on freebsd without any issue)\ndo you install from ports collection ?. It's a niche case. I will resolve it using app veyor artifacts. should we add it to travis-ci matrix ?. deployment to launchpad is something different from what I meant.\nI meant to expand current build matrix \nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/.travis.yml\nand add your build there (or I can do it later). @guidovranken , can you help with fuzzers ?. I did some investigation towards armh builds.\ncurrently softethervpn is not friendly for cross-builds at all.\nso, we have to choose from\n1. do nothing\n2. modernize build system to support cross builds (and use travis-ci)\n3. upload sources to launchpad (it builds natively as far as I seen). can you please try https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/462 ?\n(I haven't figured out how to set up launchpad yet, however, it resolved deb magic on ubuntu, so I added \"dh build-arch\" step). Any chance of unit test for that))?. can you please share details of how to use it ?\ntypical use cases, examples ... it would be nice if you can provide PR on current docs. is there something like travis-ci with Solaris ?. am I right that only \"OpenEthSolaris\" function is affected? so, linux, etc are not affected by this patch?\nif so, I guess we can merge it.\ncan you please resolve merge conflict ?. I think we can merge it.\nno ready CI for solaris (like travis-ci).\nif solaris folks wish, they can setup jenkins, for example.\nno other subsystem (except solaris) is affected. @moatazelmasry2 , there are 500+ unused functions. I think, the most comfortable is 20-30 per PR. If you prefer to review 500+ removed functions in a single PR, I can open such PR. I'll remove \"WIP\" when it is finished. I will reopen it. nobody (who can write a code) is interested in such a feature.\nyou need to either implement it by youself or motivate someone to implement it. well, I'm not interested.\nbut anyone else (who is interested) can write a code. question is answered, closing the issue.\nfeel free to reopen when PR will be available. @davidebeatrici , I think we can just merge it (with squashing)\nproper solution would be generate systemd scripts dynamically when packaging or installing\nneither manual path is good.\nbut this PR actually resolve some issue :). you can mark it as \"WIP:Spelling...\" (work in progress) to prevent merging. for all the comments - there's always a check (before).\nwithout that check it would be a \"use before check\" case ... and null dereference. so, checks are really redundant here. feel free to open PR. so, we can detect musl during cmake part and disable build on musl, right ?. those issues are hard to find.\neven if we will add musl to travis-ci build matrix, those issues are not seen during build, they are seen when running softethervpn, right ?. it is not a question \"to leave or to remove musl support\". it is rather \"how to test it\" \nif you have an idea, PR is welcome\n(to simplify testing, I suggest the following: add .gitlab-ci.yml ... and alpine docker image to it ... go to https://gitlab.com ... set up \"set up CI for external project\" ... voila, you are running alpine in 2 clicks). @davidebeatrici , what do you think ?\nI think we can merge it (after commit message is set to something good)\nanyway, such things should be covered by unit tests. we do not have any unit tests, so ...\nand, if people wish to use musl and ruine their own life, it is their choice.. musl is incompatible with iconv. when people use iconv, they mean iconv. sometimes they do not use unit tests. and things break.. well, I actually meant \"default behaviour is unchanged\", but \"some extra define and ifdef reveals that change\"\nso, musl users will define it and break their legs :) but regular users will not see any change. I used to speak English fluently, but it was 20 years ago. Sometime I people understand me wrong. Maybe, I'll go to UK for several months to fix it :)\nYes, I meant \"let us leave thing as is\" and \"let us provide some way to break legs if people really want so\".\npeople can pass defines manually. ok. \nexport I_AM_USING_MUSL=yes\ncmake .\nmake\nsomething like that (with appropriate variable name and proper comments around).\nanother way (but I like it less) would be to compile a little program during cmake phase,\nlike https://github.com/chipitsine/engine/blob/cmake/CMakeLists.txt#L137-L160\nI like it less because it changes default (current) behaviour\ninstead of FILE ... EXECUTE_PROCESS ... (the link above), try_run macro might be used \nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.7/command/try_run.html. \"src/makefiles\" are gone in favour of cmake. you can either \"force push\" from current branch\nhttps://ncona.com/2011/07/how-to-delete-a-commit-in-git-local-and-remote/\n... or you can open new PR :). cmake is available as \"master\" branch at https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN. closing in favour of https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/627. @moatazelmasry2 , @davidebeatrici - I'd like to get review from you. ok, that makes sense. @davidebeatrici , thank you for your attention.\nI sure I eye witnessed (on my laptop) proper ldd\nwe definetly need better detection of \"is softethervpn linked to the proper openssl lib\" and we need better build system (something like autoconf or cmake). @moatazelmasry2 , do you mean Settings --> Merge button --> ... ? Or do you manually squash those commits during merge ?\nwell, I also hoped that I'll do simple travis-ci and someone will see it and develop into real matrix. seems, I need to do it myself. well, Bountysource may be another alternative. superceeded by https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/687. Maybe define two macros?\n. Ha :)\n. it might be some other NAT timeout. do you have any other NAT between endpoints ?\nif so, it looks like keepalive SYN (in configured interval) should be nice\nfrom TCP point of view only client may send SYN. well, I think we can merge this.\nas for FIPS, I vote for separate \"github project\" (here: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/projects )\nFIPS might introduce incompatibility between \"FIPS enabled\" and \"FIPS disabled\" SE VPN, for example. so, project is ok, but we have to think about it twice. there's AES NI lib mentioned\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/THIRD_PARTY.TXT#L695\nif you switch to openssl implementation, should that reference be removed as well ?. We need app veyor\nIf nobody submit a patch, than I'll do. Current VS image. Uh-huh. @davidebeatrici , you can get it faster than me ))\nI'm a bit busy, hope to find time in next couple of weeks for app veyor. Nice.\nI would add artifacts, it is good for \"here's link to test binaries\". Any update on the PR?. @tidatida , are you still here ?. installer already deployed as build artifacts, close the issue. files in src are used in \"centos/SPECS/softethervpn.spec\". @moatazelmasry2 - I was sure it is 'src/*'\nI can check after May 10, I'm on vacation now (with limited access to servers).\n. it turned out that spec was broken (surprise! by myself) in https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/395\nwhat I suggest is\n1) merge this PR (i.e. 502), anyway spec is broken\n2) merge https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/302\n3) setup CI for rpm build (I think about Fedora COPR)\notherwise spec will be broken almost all the time (and work by chance from time to time). well, spec is broken (I check both SoftEtherVPN and SoftetherVPN_Stable), nobody complains, so 100% nobody is using it.\nwe'll need to decide what to do with redhat packaging (it might be either \"it's up to distributive maintainers\" or \"here's OpenSuse Build Service or Fedora COPR with prebuilt RPMs). we can do it later, it is ok to have master branch broken for a while (it's already broken  from spec point of view).\nI'm interested in maintaining COPR packages. Hope to find some time to set it up soon. repo itself means not too much.\nmaintaining packages is responsibility. it might be done either inside distributive (Debian is known for that) or inside package (i.e. providing repos with actual prebuilt packages like Launchpad, Fedora COPR or similar clouds)\nwhen you agreed on responcibility, you can choose either way, i.e. inside or outside repo. I'd prefer to have specs inside repo (it allows simple push triggers for CI). it was rebased. oh, come on. it was rebased just as you asked.... There are about 550 unused functions. I will split cleanup into several PR for ease of review. personally, I do not care about license.\nhowever, I'm afraid that \"fork and remove non gpl commits\" is potentially dangerous from lawer point of view. some people will want money from you and will endlessly take you to court \"there were my gpl commits... they were removed ... I insist that gpl was violated\". you can investigate \"C:\\Windows\\Minidump\\042518-8484-01.dmp\" with WinDbg\nor you can share that file (if you prefer - privately). I had a look. haven't found anything interesting yet.\nwill have a look later. it sounds like a good time to add osx to travis-ci matrix.\nif you are not planning to do it yourself, I'll add it\n(otherwise, I'm afraid it will get broken soon). I would add cmake also to https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/debian/control#L5\n(otherwise https://launchpad.net/~paskal-07/+archive/ubuntu/softethervpn will get broken). also, it would be nice to have cross builds. it is easier to do with cmake, maybe next PR.... I do not agree with certain aspects. \nbut let us choose your way, it is good to have osx builds. currently. travis-ci caches openssl build which is located in travis-ci home. you seem have changed location to /usr/local, so cache will not work.. oh, sorry. let me explain my \"approval\":\ncode looks good. even if there's some issue, it is ok to break master for a while (and fix right after). @moatazelmasry2 , can we merge this?. there're many ways to improve cmake, for example implement cross builds.\nor follow FHS.\nbut I'd leave them for separate PRs. @top-master \nwe have discussed your patch in SE VPN team.\nwe are ok with your contribution (no need to rewrite to C), feel free to make a PR.\nthe one thing we care about - default behaviour should not be affected, i.e. DNS filtering should be enabled (either by user or in vpn config, which came from VPN provider)\nC++ is not a problem if the code is just for Windows.\nAdding it to the below C++ file would be fine.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/Cedar/Win32Com.cpp. we use \"setenv CLIENT_CERT 0\" for user/password auth with openvpn connect.\nno need to have dummy cert. hmm, I thought to implement osx builds after cmake magic is merged.\nor you are not going to add osx to cmake?. do you mean Internat.{c,h} ? or Internat.* ?. I'm afraid .travis.yml modification might conflict with https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/518. hi,\nI like an idea to manage path via cmake, but I suggest to do it in another PR.\nless changes --> better review. resolved by https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/643. couple of thoughts\n1) if /opt is chosen as destination, usually action is required to load libraries from that folder (there's a PR related to making dest dir configurable via cmake)\n2) supporting both static and dynamic linking makes testing twice as complicated (I vote for switching to dynamically linking without supporting static linking). please ignore my deleted comment ))\nI recall that we use 'ldd' in travis-ci builds. openssl is linked dynamically (from custom folder). the question is answered. can we close the issue ?\nor maybe you are going to do some PR ?. hello\nwill it break compatibility with earlier SE VPN clients?. did you build SE with SSL3 removed and tested compatibility between different builds?. feel free to try :). well, you managed to build it. so, I do not beleive you are really bad in C :). those Makefiles will be removed soon in https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/518 :). hi, while you touch README anyway, can you please convert links to markdown ?\nlike\n[Daiyuu Nobori](https://github.com/dnobori) (Since Jan 2, 2014)\nthat will reduce overall size and improve navigation. also\nMore details on http://www.softether.org/.\nmight be converted to\n[More details](http://www.softether.org/). ok, let leave them as they are. hi,\nhere's debian 9 build:\nhttps://gitlab.com/chipitsine/SoftEtherVPN/-/jobs/70354507. ./configure\nmake\ndoes not work after cmake:\nhttps://gitlab.com/chipitsine/SoftEtherVPN/-/jobs/70356321\nhowever, error message is different from you observe. @davidebeatrici , we should update BUILD_WINDOWS with \"make -C tmp\" . I think about more traditional\n./configure\nmake\nwithout \"-C tmp\". @davidebeatrici  , I mean something like that\nhttps://github.com/chipitsine/SoftEtherVPN/commit/6557532b1316e04655965f928af214a07ddd5d72. well, anyway BUILD_UNIX is incosistent, we should update \"make\" with \"make -C tmp\"\nif you do not like my idea, let follow your way. hello,\nwhat is the issue you need to help with ? can you please be more detailed . can you provide a wireshark dump of that UDP traffic?. screenshot would be ok. udp/40000 seems to be \"udp acceleration\".\ncan you try to switch off \"udp acceleration\" and have one more look at traffic ?\nalso, can you provide screenshot of packet details (lower part of wireshark, does wireshark decode it ?). I considered decoding as an alternative if disabling \"udp acceleration\" would not helped.\ncan you do some more investigation ? for example, compare traffic amount when \"udp acceleration\" disabled and enabled.\nas for documentation, documentation is welcome :). such a comparision would be nice. actually \"you can\"\nthere is ICE/STUN/TURN approach as well as uPnP.\nbut that is quite complicated (we implemented such things for VNC communication), I'd say it requires a lot of code and testing.\nanybody volunteer to write the code :) ?. well, someone has to write the code.\nI have an idea to involve some activity like the one used here: https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati\nhave a look. there are so called \"bakers\". people who write code for money. what do you think ?. opencollective is a kind of donation from my point of view\nmost often people ask for \"china great firewall\" penetration or some really complex stuff like wireguard.\nif there were enough volunteers to write the code .... yes, it is possible. @Gentoli , are you going to share your iOS code with upstream?. @evgenmedia , it is up to you - wait for years or do something. I managed to get scan-build by the following\nscan-build cmake .\nscan-build make\nno special magic needed on cmake side. there findings (most of them are the same as coverity), maybe we need to store report somewhere. https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/clang-scan-build. sure,  https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN#for-ubuntu\n(just noticed, we have break them recently, need to fix). gcc-4.8 seems to be too old to understand ``-no-pie```\nwait a bit ? I'll provide a patch and a solution how to compile (if you are in hurry, use SCL, which provides modern gcc compiler for redhat). yum install -y epel-release\nyum install -y centos-release-scl-rh\nyum install -y devtoolset-4-gcc cmake3\nscl enable devtoolset-4 bash\ncmake3 .\nmake\nplease provide a feedback, so can update build instructions\nhow did you install compiled version? can you provide step by step ?\n. do you mean \"build from source\" ? or did you download binary package?. I managed to build on centos 7.5 using just cmake3 (with default gcc-4.8)\ncan you try also simplified script ?\nyum install -y epel-release\nyum install -y cmake3\ncmake3 .\nmake. I managed to reproduce your error message. . binary file seem was released from https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable\n@moatazelmasry2 - any idea where to report such issues ?. \"this\" repo is 5.x\nI seen 4.X in error report, right ? Also, I downloaded from softether.org, followed build instructions, and there 4.X. it seems we should add debuild -i -us -uc -b to .travis.yml instead of dh build-arch. do you mean \"currently builds are broken, but we do not see that, so add badge\"?\nI could not find launchpad badge. yep. I'm digging into ubuntu package build process. please hold on.. superceded by https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/572. I sent an invitation (in order to view defects). \n. Did it 2 or 3 times already. @macvk , do you mean \"overview provided on screenshot\" is useless? Or coverity in general (including detailed reports) is useless?. @moatazelmasry2 , I took your email from github profile. is it correct ?. Please update github profile))\nSome employers might be searching you. @macvk , your opinion is valuable, however, what do you suggest to do (based on opinion provided by you) ?. @moatazelmasry2 there're coverity build limits\n\"Up to 21 builds per week, with a maximum of 3 builds per day, for projects with 100K to 500K lines of code\"\nI've no idea what happens when you build more often. Maybe nuclear war :) Most probably, extra builds would be dropped. Nothing to worry about.\nas for PR, it is not possible to run \"secure\" travis-ci tokens with PR builds. it is considered as a security hole.\nas for travis-ci addon, I could not manage to get it running with build matrix.\nso, if we will build it several times a week, I think it is ok. Another common way is setup \"coverity\" git branch and merge it manually once a week. someone volunteer to do so ?\n. Ver 4.27, Build 9668, beta is related to https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable\nanyway, I could not find a way to download WinXP, it's support ended.\ncan you try the following - install several latest builds and check every build on WinXP compatibility ?\nthus we can find the change that breaks WinXP. 4.X is \"stable\" repo.\nsince 4.25-9656 there were 5 commits:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable/compare/v4.25-9656-rtm...master\nwe can try them one by one and have a look which one breaks WinXP\nunfortunately, I do not have an WinXP here (and I have no idea where to get it).\ncan you try to find the breaking change ?. @501ari5 , I've managed to get WinXP image. couple of questions\n1) are you using x86 or x64 build of WinXP ?\n2) are you using SP3 on WinXP ?\n3) which ubuntu do you use ? 18.04 ?. @paskal \n@moatazelmasry2 \n@davidebeatrici \ncan you please have a look ?. I'm still open to ideas how to get badges from Launchpad. I hope this will resolve https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/550. ubuntu 14.04 is shipped with cmake 2.8\nmaybe we should adapt cmake scripts to suit that. @davidebeatrici , I'm going to merge it. well, this PR does make documentation better\nso, I'm merging it\nas the @scegg keeps silence, so we'll add things mentioned by @davidebeatrici in future PRs :). hello,  4.27 Build 9668 is a stable \"repo\", actually: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable\ncan you please reproduce the issue with development repo ?\nalso, can you provide more details ?\nwhat happens during a week ? high traffic, video games ? or \"almost nothing\" ?\ndoes it matter if you use, for example linux client ?\n(I can try to get mac mini for server, but it is almost impossible to get two of them). I'll have a look. Stay tuned:). we hope to fix it in few days. can you have a look at https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/579 ?\nif it is approved, I'll merge it. ok, I'll have a look. \"more failing architectures\" due to \"cpuid.h\" missing on ARM platforms.\nI did not fix that yet. maybe @davidebeatrici has plan reganding that\nI only meant to fix x86_64 builds, sorry they are still broken\nI can build them locally on ubuntu, some magic still required to fix on launchpad.

No risk\nFeel free to open PR. the good thing is actually removing debian/debian/makefile.patch which is not needed. no functional change, just refactoring ?. does this mean some implification like \"linux might use bundled zlib.h as well, so we relocate zlib.h into deeper folder, to make sure linux will load system zlib.h\" ?. I recall pretty complicated story of bundling \"zlib\" into base in openvpn\npatch is nice (while commit message might reflect changes in more clear way)\nas for future, I'd say we need to do something with that.\nfor example, use zlib from nuget (on windows). it is hard to maintain bundled zlib. I'll have a look bit later.\nwhat do you think, shall we add an issue of moving binary dependencies (openssl, zlib) to nuget ?. That info seem to be good to add to BUILD_WINDOWS.MD\n@BlackHoleFox , can you take care of that?. thank you.\nI actually meant couple of things\na) why do we need VS2008 (because of win95 compatibility)\nb) link to download VS2008\nI'm not very good in english :). https://ci.appveyor.com/project/chipitsine/softethervpn/build/job/q8viilsrwfe8lq7y. what if ethtool is not installed ?. yeah, it fails regardless to your patch.\nbut it is nice time to review such things if we touch that code anyway. what also came to mind, \"/sbin\" is usually available in root $PATH variable, but not in regular user.. I understand. \"/sbin\" is part of interactive shell $PATH, is it true for SE VPN as well ? I'll check tomorrow. 11 commits :-) travis-ci must be burning . at least we publish App Veyor build artifacts (not sure how many people use installer from there)\ndo we use \"Release\" configuration when building installers :) ?. can we also add brew cache ?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/39930171/cache-brew-builds-with-travis-ci. I'm not sure \"cache\" is allowed within matrix (I only used it as global). IsStrInStrTokenList is unused. @vampywiz17 feel free to send PR. that's great. are you going to implement it ?. it is not clear about motivation behind such tickets.\nlooks like \"guys, I did the most difficult part, I googled for you ... here are links, now it is your turn\". project scope is \"multiprotocol vpn implementation\"\nin order to implement wireguard (which I like very much) someone has to write code, tests, so on...\nif nobody is interested in writing such code, issue is not very usefull.\nI would not limit issue to \"PR only\". I would say that feature request should come with understanding of \"who will write the code\".. SE VPN is 3rd party from that point of view. Wow\nI'll review soon\n@Andy2244 ?. I'll remove it.\nwhat about \"DoNothing\", is it safe to remove it ? I do not have idea why we need such function. I broken app veyor accidently, need time to fix. I would add \"mirrored from github\" to the text (of course, one can have a look and see it, I mean \"just in case\"). are you going to resolve https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/93 ?. windows build is broken\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoftEtherVPN/softethervpn/build/build-243-22f8d26#L234\ncan you wrap code with #ifdef    OS_UNIX ?\nalso, you need to answer to patch acceptance policy, i.e.\nSoftEther VPN Patch Acceptance Policy:\nhttp://www.softether.org/5-download/src/9.patch. great, we'll review in few days. omg, it will break debian packaging again. https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/621. I would rather write\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git. done. this will resolve https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/90. done.\nthank you for reviewing :)\nwe implemented some sort of \"debian package CI\" via gitlab.com mirroring, have a look if you are interested\nhttps://gitlab.com/chipitsine/SoftEtherVPN/pipelines/27430751\nhowever, I still haven't implemented 12.04 builds. after travis-ci is fixed, I do not mind to merge it. \"root added commit...\". As for documentation, feel free to add proper documentation. can you please change \"From: root root@pyremc.example.com\" to your github account ?. @davidebeatrici \n@thepyper \ncan you have a look, please ?\nhttps://gitlab.com/chipitsine/alpine-musl\nhere's CMakeList.txt which (in a way that I've no idea about) ... detects musl\nhere are builds:\n(centos)  https://gitlab.com/chipitsine/alpine-musl/-/jobs/87850559\n(alpine)   https://gitlab.com/chipitsine/alpine-musl/-/jobs/87850558\nshall we use something like that ?. musl is also used in LEDE builds, @Andy2244 how do you deal with that ?. I've found the following http://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2013/06/26/5\n```\nOne caveat which should not affect your usage is that the following\ncharsets are only supported as the \"from\" charset, not the \"to\"\ncharset:\neucjp\nshiftjis\nsjis\ngb18030\ngbk\ngb2312\n```\nit might be the reason why musl fails in runtime.\nhowever, I successfully converted to \"eucjp\" using musl. \ndetecting SIGEV_THREAD_ID seems to be the only way.\nor not ?. .gitlab-ci.yml should be deleted as well, it uses \"debian\" folder. @youxiaojie \nthank you for your cleanup efforts.\nthere're still compiler warnings, like that \nhttps://gitlab.com/SoftEther/SoftEtherVPN/-/jobs/96657450\nif you are going to make PR, we'll take care of it . oops. it displays \"ERROR: COVERITY_SCAN_TOKEN must be set\"\nhttps://travis-ci.org/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/jobs/415169455#L593\nit is intended behaviour. token is not available for PR builds. I'll have a look at those functions/variables later\nthanks. I tend to explicit define (by user) which package has to be built, deb or rpm\ndetermine \"rpmbuild\" is tricky. it might be CentOS with no rpmbuild installed, for example.. https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/302 is superseeded by #648 ?. I'll build rpm on fedora. should we drop standalone \"systemd\" scripts (even with https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/454) in favour of CPack ?. I built rpm, it's missing startup script (either systemd or /etc/rc.d). it should be fixed at least when we will host those RPM somewhere. is it related to #524 ?\nseems, not. that PR is about PPP, current is about OpenVPN, right ?. for some compatibility reason (openvpn 2.1 and earlier) \"net30\" is default for openvpn. it might be the reason of implementing \"net30\" for SE VPN.\nI think we can drop support for \"net30\". However, change in the code is really huge,. fixed. I definetely like the approach of LEDE people :) Comment everything.\nhttps://github.com/el1n/OpenWRT-package-softether/blob/master/softethervpn/patches/201-minimize.patch. sorry, I was not going to blame LEDE.\nby LEDE I meant openwrt as well (I heard the story of divorcing openwrt and lede and joining back).. can we enable 12.04 build as well ?. I would also move cmake version to variable and used pushd/popd semantic to change directory, but ... who cares when it works :). no volunteers, closing the issue. but we do support, for example 10.11 ?. Does it make sense to provide \"asan\" builds? Like Mozilla Firefox does. I have reviewed the patch. It looks good.\nhowever, a side note, what's the meaning of https://github.com/davidebeatrici/SoftEtherVPN/blob/macos-time/src/Mayaqua/Unix.c#L2063-L2065 ? can we remove it ?. another side note, can we reduce to \"#elif\" here https://github.com/davidebeatrici/SoftEtherVPN/blob/macos-time/src/Mayaqua/Unix.c#L2076-L2077 ?. freebsd port maintainer is hrs@FreeBSD.org\ncan we invite him in review ?. I will try to find proper document.\nIn short, windows 8.1 and later allows to start VPN connection from logon window (before user logs in). \nIt is nice for enterprises, so road warriors can log to active directory from home notebook.\n. https://blog.lan-tech.ca/2013/03/02/windows-8-connect-to-vpn-before-logon/. api first appeared in windows 8.1\nwindows 10 api is totally reworked\nand yes, I mean that feature :). Wow, I missed that. unfortunately I merged without checking for patch acceptance policy and licence change agreement. asked for those in private message. accidently superceeded by https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/682. can you specify android version, please ?. @davidebeatrici , do we print version during build ?. so... we do not catch \"stderr\" message, right ?\nBuildUtil: fatal error C0001: Child process 'X:\\Softether\\SoftEtherVPN\\src\\bin\\BuildUtil.exe' returned error code 1.\nand ... no output ?\n. @BlackHoleFox , new guide regarding CMake on windows will be really nice. @krugdenis, can you have a look at windows event viewer?. Nice. Can you try to build and investigate more, I.e. adding debug info, break points, etc?. @krugdenis , it is great\ncan you add some debug info to you build and find a place where it crashes ?. @krugdenis \nI could not reproduce installer crash.\nwould be nice if you could investigate it in depth. @krugdenis \naccording to windows event viewer log (provided by you), it crashes when executing certain command.\ncan you try to run such command from command line (i.e. taking all neccessary files from fresh build)\nif it still crashes, you can add debug messages to various points of vpnsetup.exe. @krugdenis \n\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 WER-\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 ?\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps\n\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435.\n\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c-\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0430\u043c\u043f. @krugdenis did you enable WER reporting ?. @solipse \nwhen I import your dump to WinDbg.exe (you can try it yourself)\nand run !analyze \u2013v\nI get\n\nlooks much like null pointer dereference, but we do not provide pdb with releases.\n@davidebeatrici , what do you think, should we add pdb as well ?\n. @solipse , can you reproduce crash using this installer https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoftEtherVPN/softethervpn/builds/20381447/job/j7vdnupi9c5t7w79/artifacts ?\nit is better, beacuse we have PDB and WinDbg will show us full stack trace\ncan you provide dmp ?.

I would stay with github naming. hi, @Andy2244 \nactually, there's one more task (launchpad builds), where git submodules are not supported (for another reason).\nwe will get some solution of those issues probably next week. @paskal , do you mean something like \"build step\" within launchpad recipe ?. we can have a look at builds, as I remember they are publicly available. https://launchpadlibrarian.net/392429020/buildlog_ubuntu-bionic-i386.softether-vpn_5.01.9657-0~201810081900~ubuntu18.04.1_BUILDING.txt.gz ?\ndo you call \"git submodule update --init --recursive\" manually ? if so, you should not (as launchpad removes \".git\" subfolder).\nif it came from SE VPN itself, we need to remove it. as for cmake (very recent cmake required), you can take something like that\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L7-L8. hi, @Andy2244 , @paskal \nI added tar + submodules in new releases\n(it is done via AppVeyor machinery  https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/.appveyor.yml#L79)\nin the next release (which I expect in few days) full archive will look like that:\nhttps://github.com/chipitsine/SoftEtherVPN/releases/download/v666.666.666/v666.666.666.tar.gz. how this supposed to be used ? should we add this to app veyor ?. not sure it is a good place where stable edition should be discussed.. done. done. can you provide step by step guide how to reproduce it ?. @paskal , can you try this patch on launchpad ?. @paskal , we recently started to tag releases (we are going to it weekly). maybe launchpad builds should be run on releases ?\n(on the other hand it is nice to detect some build issues early). I came to an idea.\nwhat if you will split launchpad into two \"channels\"\n1) releases\n2) nightly builds (against master)\n?. there are couple of releases already  https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/releases\nhopefully, we'll release one this week. I guess launchpad might be affected, @paskal ?. OpenWRT builds, @andy2244 ?. @Andy2244 , yes, I meant that. thanks.. can you please reproduce ubuntu 18.04 fresh build including \"make package\" and investigate resulting deb ?. unfortunately, I deleted vm.\ngive me 30 min. @paskal , there are few thoughts\n1) launchpad is running native armh, arm64 build agents. it is good\n2) currently we do not support cross builds (but we wish)\n3) current deb files include startup scripts only for systemd (if target system supports systemd)\n4) we do not know how to upload to launchpad (it would be really nice if you can help here). @davidebeatrici  (it is not related to this particular PR, seems it was always there)\n```\nroot@ubuntu-18:~/softethervpn# dpkg -i /home/ilia/softethervpn/build/softether-vpnserver_5.1.9660_amd64.deb\nSelecting previously unselected package softether-vpnserver.\n(Reading database ... 67327 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack .../softether-vpnserver_5.1.9660_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking softether-vpnserver (5.1.9660) ...\nSetting up softether-vpnserver (5.1.9660) ...\nroot@ubuntu-18:~/softethervpn# \nroot@ubuntu-18:~/softethervpn# cat /lib/systemd/system/softether-vpnserver.service | grep ExecStart\nExecStart=/usr/local/libexec/softether/vpnserver/vpnserver start\nroot@ubuntu-18:~/softethervpn# \nroot@ubuntu-18:~/softethervpn# ls -l /usr/local/libexec/softether/vpnserver/vpnserver \nls: cannot access '/usr/local/libexec/softether/vpnserver/vpnserver': No such file or directory\nroot@ubuntu-18:~/softethervpn# ls -l /usr/libexec/softether/vpnserver/vpnserver \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2154528 Oct 18 09:54 /usr/libexec/softether/vpnserver/vpnserver\nroot@ubuntu-18:~/softethervpn# \n```. can you please provide an output of\nvpncmd 127.0.0.1:443 /SERVER /CMD:ServerInfoGet\n?. closed due to github bug. will reopen. closing due to github bug. @qupfer , can you try the following https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/767 ?. it works for me as well. ok, merging. we build packages for ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 (I am going to add upload to launchpad for those packages some time)\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoftEtherVPN/softethervpn/build/job/w1tydq8nsd0o1b3u\nas a part of test process, we install packages and do \"systemctl restart ...\", it restarts (that means, no issue with /usr/local)\nas for \"doing the same\", it is bad to use hardcode path, I think configurable path is better.\nin those terms /usr/local is more \"configurable\" then default /usr/lib\nyou can choose either solution.\nif you will include \"install package\" + \"test restart\" (ike we did already for app veyor), it would be nice. as for \"doing the same in upstream\", feel free to open PR on that (if you understand what you mean exactly), as I said already, we do not observe those issues in upstream anymore. it is exactly what you are installing.\nlocal data.\nhow can you determine SE VPN is not local data, installed by system administrator ?. @paskal, you seem trying to find the worst practice ever.\nthis issue is closed already. and originally it is not related to tags.\nwhy not to open dedicated issue on tags ?\nas for tags, currently they are not used for build numbers. build numbers are supposed to be taken from src/CurrentBuild.txt\nprobably we need to discuss it and do something. like CI check on \"are build numbers the same in tag and inside that file\". I tried to change those as well, build fails. I'll address it later. @djony , can you help with russian translation ?. @djony , I noticed your commits and I decided to ask you about this particular PR (it adds some russian strings). File is strtable_ru.stb, however it is updated in PR#772. duplicate of https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/16. can we change Proxy Type with dropdown box ?. no problem. radio button is good to two option choice. we can check all the interface, how many choices do we have. yep, sorry for typ0. it might be because of libressl\n@davidebeatrici , what do you think, should we add the most recent libressl to travis-ci ?. @solipse , just for the record, are you using libressl or openssl ?. What if we will add a possibility to turn this by sending some PUSH from client?. really nice!. hi, I actually have no idea how to test (or review) this particular PR.\nopenvpn scrambling is significant part of Tunnelblick.\nlet us kindly ask @jkbullard for review :)\n. there are few \"cheap\" ways\n1) delete fork and create fork from scratch (you described)\n2) switch to new branch (and reset few commits there)\n3) ..... are we going to merge this PR before weekly release ?. v4.22-9634-beta is related to https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable\nit is different repo from this one. Can you try to reproduce on 5.1.NN (which is current repo) ?. I suspect some memory related issues. Can you try valgrind (in case you can reproduce the issue) ?. even if you cannot reproduce, valgrind may find leaks if there's any. as you are touching \"systemd\" folder in this PR, maybe it is time to move it somewhere deeper, like \"src/systemd\" or \"src/BuildFiles/systemd\" ?. can we merge it before release (which I'm going to make in a couple of days) ?. are we ready to merge it ?. @paskal , we are not very powerful on debian packaging (as you might have noticed already, we break packaging few times per year).\nhowever, we do not proud of breaking packaging and we ask your help on improving its robustness.\nparticularly, can you help in a couple of things:\n1) can this setting help to resolve this issue https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L59 ? if so, can you add CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr to your packaging recipies ?\n2) if packaging need to be resolved within upstream, what kind of change should it be ? and how can we test it (we will add tests to App Veyor) ?. hello, thank you for your investigation.\n4.X is related to https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable\nyou have opened an issue in \"developer\" repo, it has 5.X versions. can you try to reproduce your issue on 5.X ?. which OS do you use ?\nwe built releases for few of them https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/releases\n(or you can follow build instruction and build it from source). Nice. We should add such tests. @Alchiadus , I recently added integration test for running native openvpn2 against SE VPN\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/commit/eb64940d363e4e9fb06a45d78427a5587694c2b4\nI  guess we need the similar for openvpn3 as well. can you help on that ?. @Alchiadus , my vision is something like that https://github.com/gost-engine/engine/blob/master/test/00-engine.t\ni.e. \n1) involve some testing framework (like Test::More)\n2) split actions into separate functions (like \"setup SE VPN\", etc, ...)\ncurrent bash scripts is quick and dirty approach. @pskifast , password is sent via clear text. anyway, please open a separate issue . @Andy2244 , they were not manual. they were supposed to be created by App Veyor, however we ran out of artifacts quota.\nwe are moving that to Azure Pipelines. thank for your patience.  @solipse , LibreSSL ?. we definitely miss tests ((. can you please fill an issue on that?. I will investigate possible performance penalty. is OpenBSD more picky regarding double free ? can we run tests on Linux in similar mode ?. can you provide details why that api is deprecated ?. thank you, it makes sense. @paskal , please review. 4.28 is SoftEtherVPN Stable\nyou open a issue to SoftEtherVPN developer edition\ncan you try to reproduce desribed bug on 5.01.N ?. you can try some RADIUS implementation with mysql backend. or write some code to support mysql directly. great news!\nso, do you have public gitlab.com repo to have a look at ?. Hello\nCan it be propagated in client configs?. when commercial VPN provider deploys SoftEtherVPN, usually he supply config files for clients. Can that setting be included in that config ?. I would say that it is up to cactus vpn and their customers. if they beleive in \"True\", they can provide their users way to set it up.\nno need to change default setting (it might break things). well, I see \"Step 2. Follow this link to download the .vpn files\" in their guide.\nwhy not to include proper setting to those .vpn files ?. thank for SE VPN public providers, btw\nreally nice sites, will have a deeper look. changing default values is bad.\nproviding better documentation is good.\nyou are welcome to make PR. Travis is failing. please, do not pay attention to app veyor, we are out of build artifacts quota.\ncan you squash commits into one ? . well, we pay some attention to app veyor builds (probably, we should remove artifacts).\nanyway, we are slowly going to Azure Pipelines (I am a bit busy last month) . @macvk  , do you mind if we will provide you short guide how to squash commits ?. hi,\nI started splitting it into several files\nhttps://github.com/chipitsine/SoftEtherVPN/blob/azure/azure-pipelines.yml\ndid not finish yet. That way of specifying cache is limited to ccache only\nIf we ever will want to add other caches, \"cache: ccache\" will not work\nAs for now we can use short form, you are right. there's check already  https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/Cedar/Hub.c#L5435\nif dest is NULL, we'll return from function. if s is NULL we return from function https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/Cedar/Protocol.c#L4821. there's check for NULL https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/Cedar/SM.c#L18372. ok. there's \"set -e\"\nso script will stop on error\n(personally, I'd keep installing packages with \"apt\" plugin, it only affects linux, so no comparision is needed). it is LICENSE, not LICENSE.md\nif it is acceptable to convert license to markdown, it would be great. those files are also used in \"centos/SPECS/softethervpn.spec\"\nI doubt they are really needed in rpm (maybe due to legal terms?), also, I'm not sure md is good there\nso, I just removed duplicates. if you wish, please feel free to open any other PR on your own. is it safe to call when FIPS is not enabled?. is SE capable of running in FIPS mode ? should we add that to travis-ci matrix ?\nbesides that, I think we can merge this PR. I reverted \"if (A && B)\" to \"if( not A || not B)\" (at least I meant that) . makes sense. nobody reads wiki.\nif you really care about tabs and space (but from any regular developer it makes no sense, we do not use python), please find a time to add a check like that https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/blob/master/.travis.yml#L62-L63\notherwise, it is not \"wrong\". it is your private opinion, no rules are defined for SE. guys, please start another issue discussing tabs, spaces, whatever.\nthis particular PR was open when no rules were defined, it does not break any rule. I do not think so.. what's wrong with that?. what is the difference?. it is C, not python. . I understand what you are trying to say. Rules exists in your own head, but some people ask you to define rules first before you can use it. Right ?. for C language both are equivalent.. I'm not trying to break anything. I simply used x windows buffer, copied few lines and pasted them. Probably, tabs were converted to spaces. I do not think it is important, and I was not doing that in purpose. For C language those things are equivalent. If you want rules, ok, but define them first.. I do think we should. Please replace if you wish so.. thank you.. I will fix that in a day. \"modes\" ?. how it will work on system without systemd support ?. shall we add .clang-format with \"BreakBeforeBraces: Stroustrup\" ? (or any other value, I do not care personally)\nand make travis-ci check the format. we probably can add .mfractor globally, not only that folder. done. can we add command line installation instrruction ?\nsomething based on workload is\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/workload-and-component-ids?view=vs-2017. can we use nuget here ?. I mean, when VS2017 is installed, you can add workloads to existing installation. we use things like that in automated build agent setup. if you think developers do not use it frequently, let's ignore that. I mean we it in similar self hosted environment.\nas for App Veyor, it has many workloads installed right out of box. OK, I will make more investigation. in theory, there might be names like chipitsine@gmail.com@mail.ru ?\nand they are not to be treated as error ?. does it allow unicode characters ?. I mean how to treat when multiple separators are found. can we accidently get some security issue here?. what will happen if user will input unicode char?. what will happen if separator is the last character, i.e. chipitsine@gmail.com@. should we also assign NULL inside FreeSSLCtx ? there are other usages of that function as well.

Related issue: #61. Pull request: #524. #524 changed the IP address to 192.0.0.8, which is defined in RFC7600 as dummy IPv4 address.. Certificate authentication with OpenVPN has been added in #327.. I'm closing this issue because many things changed regarding the build system.\nFeel free to reply in case you're still experiencing the issue.. Client support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD has been added in #670.. The new function's signature should be added to Encrypt.h.. Yes, but all of the functions' signatures are in the header.. Here's the cause:\nc++\nsrc/Mayaqua/Encrypt.c:4050:10: warning: incompatible pointer types passing\n      'struct stack_st_SSL_COMP *' to parameter of type 'OPENSSL_STACK *'\n      (aka 'struct stack_st *') [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]\n        sk_free(SSL_COMP_get_compression_methods());\n                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. New pull request: #484. Solved by #343.. Yes, we should document all the options we implement for configure.. Solved by #343.. Pull request to support OpenVPN certificates: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/327. #808 adds the desired feature.\n@hijack329 Could you test and review it, please?. #808 has been merged.. ECDHE-RSA ciphers are now available.. Only Visual Studio 2008 is supported.. Solved by #343.. Solved by #343.. Thank you for fixing it.. @moatazelmasry2 I think that you should enable the rebase by default when using git pull:\ngit config --global pull.rebase true. I would've added his repository as new remote, checked out his branch, pulled from origin/master and then force-pushed.\ngit remote add tidatida git@github.com:tidatida/SoftEtherVPN.git\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout -b tidatida-master tidatida/master\ngit pull --rebase origin master\ngit push -f. That would be the best way to merge a pull request, in my opinion.\nAll of the commits are inserted into the target branch as they are, along with a merge commit which indicates that the commits come from a pull request.. Superseded by #787.. SSLv3 has been permanently disabled in #594.. Solved by #343.. I think that this issue can now be closed.. I'm going to reply in #424, which is more recent.. I would remove commit 2569939a18e262741bd6b5cad3ef3087c5ed6913 from this pull request and propose it in a new one, as it's unrelated.. The new strings should be added to the Traditional Chinese table (strtable_tw.stb) as well.. Is the PreverifyOk variable required?. @a-kr Thank you very much for your contribution!\n@moatazelmasry2 I would have squashed the commits, as the second one is a fixup to the first.. Oh, sorry.\nI was looking at the commits list in the pull request, as I usually squash them in the source branch and then merge normally.. You can, if the \"Allow edits from maintainers.\" option is enabled, which is by default.\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork. @a-kr Build fails with OpenSSL 1.1.0f:\ncpp\nsrc/Mayaqua/Network.c:5836:11: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type \u2018X509_STORE_CTX {aka struct x509_store_ctx_st}\u2019\n    if (ctx->cert != NULL)\n           ^~. Are you planning to use Docker? Or do you prefer to compile the latest version of OpenSSL on Ubuntu 14.04?. Working!\nThank you very much for the fast fix.. @moatazelmasry2 You're welcome.. @a-kr The OpenVPN sample configuration can't be used as it is anymore because it contains dummy certificates, causing user authentication to fail.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/596493e1a1a09905b59c73a55635351dee1d6fd3/src/bin/hamcore/openvpn_sample.ovpn#L119-L136\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/596493e1a1a09905b59c73a55635351dee1d6fd3/src/Cedar/Admin.c#L1158-L1185\nI think that we should remove them and add setenv CLIENT_CERT 0, as suggested in OpenVPN's documentation.\nSetting the environment variable is not required anymore though, as the problem has been fixed in OpenVPN Connect 1.0.1, back in 2013: https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?t=11991#p26976. @DRSDavidSoft It's not implemented in the stable repository yet.. @DRSDavidSoft The stable repository is managed by @dnobori, we currently don't know when he will update it.\nYou can download Windows releases compiled from this repository on AppVeyor.. Closing for lack of activity, feel free to reopen.. Closing for lack of activity, feel free to reopen.. #245. I prepared a virtual machine with the latest stable version of RouterOS (6.43.4) and I can reproduce the issue.\n~~However, the cause of the connection failure is this:~~\n~~ovpn-out1: terminating... - TLS failed~~\n~~Which also happens with an OpenVPN 2.4.0 server.~~\nI realized that the Certificate field is meant to be the client certificate, not the server one.\nThe graphical interface is not clear on that.. Fixed in #812.. https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/333#issuecomment-332789392:\n\nThe good news is that using this patch I was able to connect from a MikroTik router to SoftEtherVPN in ip mode (Layer 3 or tun) mode, but a connection using ether mode (Layer 2) still fails. The reason for this is that even when using layer 2 (so no IP), the MikroTik router expects IP parameters in the PUSH_REPLY.\nSending fake IP settings even when a layer 2 connection from a MikroTik router is incomming actually works, but I have to figure out how to detect connections from those routers as sending IP parameters to all clients would be really a bad idea.\n\nWorkaround implemented in #828.. Thank you very much for your contribution!. #408. > Default value is 'Disable'.. Without this patch, the network interface's state is always UP, regardless of the session status.. Because the network interface's state should always reflect the state of the associated connection, especially because you can use it in a script to easily detect whether the VPN is connected.. VLanUnix.c is not compiled on Windows:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/30a554c1902407a7ad3118833c77604796473b17/src/Cedar/VLanUnix.c#L133. @joshperry Yes, because I pushed before completing the rebase and thus I left out 190ad01eb758f85ae20b945cfc75c7204da88d84.\nI completed the rebase, force-pushed and 59e1483dbf707b1adcec04f5f450c0b3445ab5f2 was deleted.. Thank you very much for your contribution!\nGiven the importance of the network interface's state, I think that we should enable NicDownOnDisconnect by default in future.. You're welcome!. @moatazelmasry2 I think that this shouldn't be tagged as security.. @paskal Our current version is 5.01.9659, but on the PPA repository it's 5.01.9662.. No problem, we will close the gap as soon as possible.. We should get on par with the stable repository, which is currently at build 9669.. Let's ask @dnobori.. > This is not a good, and I am considering to add a new RPC to fetch the support cipher list from the running server to list on the UI and vpncmd.\nDone in #852.. Fixed in #632.. Superseded by #571.. Superseded by #569.. Superseded by #562.. Superseded by #453.. The issue has been fixed in the latest release (Build 9668 Beta).\nhttps://www.softether.org/5-download/history.

The SSLv3 protocol is deprecated and should not be used.\n```. Fixed by #594.. I removed the spam by deleting users (and their posts) which:\n1. Had less than 2 posts.\n2. Had a link to a \"bad\" website on the profile.\n3. Posted spam threads/messages.\n\nI also deleted all posts made by the Anonymous (guest) user.\nAs a side effect of point 1, a few valid users were affected and there are some threads which don't have the original first message anymore, because phpBB doesn't delete the entire thread.\n@fenice2 Thank you very much for your help, you're now a global moderator.. > That must have been quite an horrendous task getting rid of all that 'mess', well done. :)\nThank you.\nIt took some days, but it was worth it.\n\nI'm surprised, amazed and honoured to be a moderator, I'll try my best to keep the forums clean. I've had a quick trial of various bits on the forums and no great surprises but a couple of questions.\n\nI'm sure you'll do a great job as a moderator, you did a lot of work as a user with limited power.\n\nI'd like to suggest that a 'private' forum for moderators/admins is created where we can ask questions without cluttering github, is that possible?\n\nDone.. Closing in favor of #424.. After some testing, I found out that the problem only happens with OpenSSL 1.1.0f.\nNewer and older versions work fine, meaning that it's probably a regression introduced in 1.1.0f and then fixed in 1.1.0g.\nDebian Stretch users should install libssl1.1 from the sid branch, as a temporary workaround.. #427. I rebased against master and fixed the code style.. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Superseded by #571.. See #777.. There is a client available on Play Store, which requires root permissions in order to work: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.lfasmpao.softethervpn\nThe repository on GitHub is not up-to-date though: https://github.com/lfasmpao/softethervpn-android.

OPENSSL_NO_ECDSA is only in OpenSSL's headers.\nAt the moment there is no support for ECDSA certificates.. @arvindiotium You're welcome!\nI would transform this issue into a feature request.. There's a problem though.\nThe 1.1.0f builds have the system's OpenSSL libraries as dependencies, according to ldd:\n$ ldd bin/vpnserver/vpnserver\n    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffd1cefe000)\n    librt.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0x00007f1f6f4e5000)\n    libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f1f6f2c7000)\n    libssl.so.1.0.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f1f6f068000)\n    libcrypto.so.1.0.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f1f6ec8c000)\n    libreadline.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libreadline.so.6 (0x00007f1f6ea46000)\n    libncurses.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncurses.so.5 (0x00007f1f6e823000)\n    libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f1f6e60a000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f1f6e241000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f1f6f6ed000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f1f6e03d000)\n    libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007f1f6de14000). @chipitsine I agree.. Using git rebase.\nHow can I squash my last X commits together into one commit using Git?. It isn't, but you have to push forcibly: git push --force or git push -f.\nIt's kind of dangerous because you have to be careful if someone else is working on the same branch, otherwise you risk overwriting his commits if your local branch is not up-to-date.\nThis can be avoided by using git push --force-with-lease, which checks that your local branch is up-to-date before pushing.\nThere's a great article explaining in detail: https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/git-push---force-and-how-to-deal-with-it. > @davidebeatrici thanks\n@moatazelmasry2 You're welcome.\n\nIt is indeed a bit dangerous. I'll just stick to squashing and rebasing commits when accepting a PR :)\n\nI think that's the best thing to do, as the previous pull requests have been merged this way.\nStarting to squash and rebase the commits directly in the branch and then merging it via a merge commit would probably cause confusion in the master branch's commits list.. I think it's a good idea.\nI've seen many projects using Bountysource lately.. Yes, I forgot to update it, sorry.. Thank you very much!. RSA_KEY_SIZE was unused.. Hello,\nAre you still encountering the issue?. I agree.. Builds failed because we only have the Windows library in the repository:\nsrc/BuildFiles/Library/[Configuration]/libintelaes.ni\nI think that we should use OpenSSL's EVP interface instead: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29838852/6658002. @a-kr I would like to get a review from you, as you seem quite experienced with OpenSSL.. @a-kr Thank you very much for the detailed review!\nI should've addressed everything you pointed out, let me know if I missed anything or there's something else to change.. Thank you again for your review.. I moved the variables declaration at the top of the function, as required by the C89 standard.. This build has to be restarted, but I don't have the privileges to do it.. I overwrote the first commit, which triggered Travis-CI.\nAll of the build succeeded except one.. Ready for review.. Yes.. The reference was already removed.\nI pushed the commits again because I pulled from master in order to trigger the AppVeyor build.. @moatazelmasry2 Done.. In case you're compiling for Windows, you should expect similar performance.\nIn case you're compiling for other operating systems:\n\nIf you compile from this repository, the performance boost is significant, because Intel's AES-NI library is not included.\nIf you compile from the package available on http://www.softether-download.com, which includes the library, you should expect similar performance.. Hello,\n\nYou're right.\nI removed \"Intel\" from the name because also CPUs from other manufacturers support AES-NI.. The \"official\" way would be to use Visual Studio 2008 with the Debug preset, so that you can see debug messages in the console.. You're welcome.\nCould you create a pull request, please?\nViewing debug messages via DebugView or DebugView++ can be useful for many people.. Thank you very much!. Thank you very much for the report.\nThe failure is caused by commit 83295bb736d282940a79f0bd2c1a4e45910101cf.\nWe didn't know it would cause issues with MSVC, as we only have Continuous Integration tests with GCC and Clang (Linux), unfortunately.. Which software are you planning to use on AppVeyor?. We have to make the code compatible with Visual Studio 2017 first.. I meant that we have to make the code compatible with Visual Studio 2017 in order to use the current AppVeyor image.. @tidatida I created a pull request which should fix the compile problem.\nCould you test it out, please?. Depending on the issues showing up in Visual Studio 2017, we could create a separate project file for it while maintaining the code compatible with Visual Studio 2008.. We have to use two separated build configurations on AppVeyor.. I'm working on it.. @chipitsine No problem.. @moatazelmasry2 @chipitsine\nDone: #498\n. Errors fixed in #499, AppVeyor artifacts added in #500.\nI think that this issue can now be closed.. No problem.. Superseded by #491.. It fixes #488.\nMSVC is not compatible with the C99 standard, thus all of the variables have to be declared at the beginning of a block (immediately after the opening bracket).. Unfortunately the error messages are not clear.\nFrom https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/488#issue-314418751, translated to English:\ncpp\n.\\Network.c(5836): error C2143: Syntax error : Missing \";\" (in front of \"const\")\n.\\Network.c(5837): error C2065: \"msg\": undeclared identifier\n.\\Network.c(5838): error C2065: \"msg\": undeclared identifier\n.\\Network.c(5858): error C2143: Syntax error : Missing \"{\" (before \"*\")\n.\\Network.c(5859): error C2371: \"NewSslPipe\": redefine; different base types. The commit is 9188b573ec8b2bed7ca7961054aa40e4d96c9ae0.. I would create a new branch, cherry-pick his commit there and then create a new pull request.. The auth type is \"OpenVPN certificate authentication\" because your client configuration contains a certificate and a key.\nSee my comment in #327.. It asks for the credentials because auth-user-pass is specified in the configuration.. You're welcome.. I think that 30 seconds for the ping transmission interval and 120 seconds for the communication timeout are too high.\nI would set the ping transmission interval to 10 seconds and the communication timeout to 30 or 60 seconds.\nWhat do you think?. Thank you for testing, I'm going to create a pull request to apply the changes.. Issues are disabled in the stable repository.. Making the intervals editable via the configuration file would be ideal.\nHowever, I think that we should edit the constants anyway, as the current intervals are too low to be suitable for slow connections or devices.. True.. @moatazelmasry2 I would like to keep this one.. Done.. Done.. I strongly agree.. I replied to your comment, but the discussion is now marked as outdated as I pushed the changes.\n\n{build} is required.\nWhat about {build}-{commit-sha1}?\n\n4-1e94d9e\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidebeatrici/softethervpn/build/4-1e94d9e. I see that you have created the project on AppVeyor, but the build failed.\nThat's because I decided to change the default configuration name appveyor.yml to .appveyor.yml.\nYou can set it in the project settings, under the General tab: \"Custom configuration .yml file name\".. You didn't delete the review, it's just marked as outdated.\nUnfortunately we can't use my AppVeyor project, as I'm not part of the team.\nbuild-{build}-{commit} works, yes. Do you prefer it to {build}-{commit}?. I changed {build}-{commit} to build-{build}-{commit}.\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidebeatrici/softethervpn/build/build-5-69347d3\nWhen you login to AppVeyor via GitHub, you can choose between your personal profile and the organization one.\nIf you login with the organization one, you can create the project which will be accessible by everyone who is part of the team.\nThe URL will be https://ci.appveyor.com/project/softethervpn/softethervpn.. You're welcome!. The build failed, as expected: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoftEtherVPN/softethervpn/build/build-2-b29ca0b\nOnce #491 is merged, it should succeed.. Unfortunately his commit email is not the same as his GitHub one, meaning that it will not be counted as contribution.\nI would manually change it, along with the name: git commit --amend --author=\"tinyserver <tinyserver@foxmail.com>\".. Excellent.. I would remove the files in src and keep the ones in the repository root.. You're welcome.. @dnobori You're welcome.. @dnobori You're welcome.. Fixed in #741.. You're welcome!. I think that switching the project license from GPL to a BSD-like one is a very good idea, as it would push software and hardware manufacturers to add support for SoftEther VPN in their products.\nMuch more people would probably be preferring it to other solutions, especially for its performance, if available and ready to be used out-of-the-box on their device (usually a router).\nI agree to changing the project license to Apache License or any other BSD-like licenses.. What about switching to a license compatible with the GPLv2, such as the 3-clause BSD?. We currently need the approval from:\n~@a-kr~, ~@quantum5~, ~@maksqwe~, ~@ajeecai~, ~@NoahO~, ~@cm0x4D~, ~@LegDog~, ~@mcsalgado~, ~@micsell~, ~@holoreimu~, ~@yehorov~, ~@el1n~, ~@yfdyh000~, ~@nattoheaven~, ~@tonychung00~, ~@sacha~, ~@nvsofts~, ~@scj643~, @rel22, ~@timschneider~, ~@mogikanin~, ~@jsoref~, ~@mlaily~, ~@nna774~, ~@ziozzang~, ~@dglushenok~, ~@joshperry~, ~@hsaito~.. You contributed with pull request #276, but we removed the debian folder when we switched to CPack.. From @ziozzang via email:\n\nYes, I approve.. From @scj643 via email:\nYes, I approve.. @el1n approved the license switch via email.\n\n@rel22's contribution is not covered by copyright because it's a minor change.. Pull request: #832.

Feel free to do it.. > I would add cmake also to https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/debian/control#L5\n(otherwise https://launchpad.net/~paskal-07/+archive/ubuntu/softethervpn will get broken)\nDone.\n\nalso, it would be nice to have cross builds. it is easier to do with cmake, maybe next PR...\n\nIndeed.. @chipitsine Pull request to add the Mac OS X target to Travis CI: #523. Feel free to explain what you don't like, feedbacks are very important.. I didn't change the location.\nOpenSSL in /usr/local is provided by Homebrew.. No problem.. Ready to be reviewed.. This pull request has been tested on:\n\nDebian 9.4\nFreeBSD 11.1\nOpenBSD 6.2. You're welcome.. @dnobori I think that you should use the same email address for Git and GitHub, otherwise the commits you create locally are not counted as contributions in your profile.. The code already pastes the server certificate (<ca>) to the sample configuration.. You're welcome.. From https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/327#issuecomment-380305697:\n\n\nI think that we should remove them and add setenv CLIENT_CERT 0, as suggested in OpenVPN's documentation.\nSetting the environment variable is not required anymore though, as the problem has been fixed in OpenVPN Connect 1.0.1, back in 2013: https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?t=11991#p26976\n\nAlso, regarding dummy certificates:\n- They wouldn't be ideal for applications like OpenVPN for Android, as it supports authentication with certificates + credentials.\n- They can't be used anymore, unless we edit the code so that they are ignored when authenticating the user.. It's already present.. @rikyenns4 That's the current line in master:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/eb776cf14cfaad7cf94674c37436a9fbf67b5749/debian/control#L5\nzlib1g-dev is already there.. No problem.. I already added support for MacOS in the CMake configuration, but we should make sure that it works.\nOnce this pull request is merged, I will rebase #518, in order to trigger the builds, so that we can know whether they succeed or not.. Done.. You're welcome.. I agree, I think that we should add it as a virtual hub option.. @moatazelmasry2 I added the prefix.. @Siggemada You have to install the zlib1g-dev package.. You're welcome.. Related issue: #406 . That's because the Linux packages on the SoftEther website contain compiled static libraries which are then linked into the various executables by make.\n@dnobori Those libraries should be built with -fPIC (Position Independent Code).. It has been fixed in the latest version (4.27 Build 9668).. No problem.. Pull request: #508 . The pull request has not been merged yet.. There's a bug in it: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/511#discussion_r183244902. Did you reinstall the virtual network adapter driver?. #508 changed the virtual network adapter's type to IF_TYPE_PROP_VIRTUAL, as explained there: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2919900/windows-connection-manager-disconnects-wlan-if-a-vpn-connection-is-est.\nThe network adapter not appearing in the list is a Windows issue.. I would change the pull request's and commit's title to src/Mayaqua/Internat: remove unused functions, as the functions are removed from the header too.. src/Mayaqua/Internat: remove unused functions\nI corrected the comment, sorry for that.. No problem, I will rebase it.. Pull request #50 changed the paths in order to adhere to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.\nI can integrate the changes in #518.\nI think that we should also add an automatic import system, in order to move the configuration files from the old paths.. I agree.. Superseded by #760.. We deprecated SSLv3 in #594.. TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.. > I would assume it defaults to the highest supported on both ends.\nRight.\n\nAs 1.2 counts as \"modern\", this issue is probably closable i'd imagine.\n\nDone.. You're welcome!. @chipitsine What do you think about creating a new script called build, which calls make in the tmp folder?. ./configure\ncd tmp\nmake\n?. @chipitsine I don't think it's a good idea, because all of the build files are created into the source code folders.. Hi, ARM64 is supported.. Hello, the build fails because the objects are built for ARM32.\nYou should build SoftEther VPN from this repository using CMake: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/master/src/BUILD_UNIX.md#build-from-source-code-and-install. Ubuntu packages are available in @paskal's PPA repository: https://launchpad.net/~paskal-07/+archive/ubuntu/softethervpn/+packages. The command is make install, not ./install.sh.. No worries, thank you very much for reporting the error.. Hello,\nDid the issue appear with the latest version?. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Of course you can, if your app supports it.\nYou can connect using raw L2TP (not encrypted) or L2TP with IPSec (encrypted).. You could use Android's VpnService API and then write your own L2TP client implementation.. We should use a temporary folder for CMake, as we do with configure:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/879dc8f6b8daa017ebbe843a57fd15ebb36877c3/configure#L20-L28\n. We could use https://github.com/babelouest/ulfius to implement a REST interface.. Excellent, thank you very much.. The author of #47 reported that the issue is fixed for him.\nAre you still experiencing crashes?. I couldn't reproduce the issue on Android 8.1.0. Could you specify on which device are you encountering the issue, please?. SoftEther VPN Server is now installed in /usr/libexec/softether/vpnserver.\nYou can edit the path inside /usr/bin/vpnserver.. The main problem is that Launchpad doesn't support Git submodules: https://bugs.launchpad.net/git-build-recipe/+bug/1733603. The only aspect we chose over stability is security, but so far only #552 and #688 are caused by that and I'm working on fixing them.\nI'm extremely sorry about this issue, we should've fixed the systemd services much sooner.\nRight now the only thing that's breaking the PPA builds is cpu_features, as submodules are not supported on Launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/git-build-recipe/+bug/1733603).\nThey're working on it, according to the bug status. Meanwhile, as a temporary fix, you could fork this repository and replace the submodule with the files from its repository (https://github.com/google/cpu_features).. You're welcome!\nI agree that we should have more tests, especially for the packaging (DEB/RPM for now).. From https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/574#issue-343408913:\n\nThe commit that added cpuid.h to Encrypt.c breaks cross-compiling, because only i386 targets have support for  via gcc and the file is not included/copied by most cross-compile sdk's on other targets.\nMaybe /proc/cpuinfo and checking for the aes flag could be used on unsupported linux/bsd platforms instead?\nSome arm/mips have aes support, but i'm not sure what has to-be in-place to actually get this working on none i386 platforms.\n\n. Duplicate of #573.. Fixed in #578.. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Yes.. Thank you very much for your contribution!. From https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn23ManPage:\n\n--block-outside-dns\nBlock DNS servers on other network adapters to prevent DNS leaks. This option prevents any application from accessing TCP or UDP port 53 except one inside the tunnel. It uses Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) and works on Windows Vista or later.\nThis option is considered unknown on non-Windows platforms and unsupported on Windows XP, resulting in fatal error. You may want to use --setenv opt or --ignore-unknown-option (not suitable for Windows XP) to ignore said error. Note that pushing unknown options from server does not trigger fatal errors.\n\nWe should push the option from the server.. Exactly.. I updated the commit message.. Yes.. You can download it from Microsoft: https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=13276. From https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/wiki/SoftEther-VPN-Developers-Guideline-(DRAFT):\n\nMUST support Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 is the latest version to support Windows 9x and Windows NT 4.x binary linking. It is OK to add new Visual Studio's solution files (e.g. for Visual Studio 2017). In such a case, there must be dual solution files for both Visual C++ 2008 and the latest Visual Studio.\n\nI'm working on adding Windows support to our CMake configuration.. The file appears as if it was entirely changed because now it has LF line endings.\nI would create a commit to change the line endings before 7a12daefdaaba2f835544d068fa98eb471974386.. No worries, it's fine.. Thank you very much for your contribution!. The call fails.. I agree.. Yes, because ethtool requires root permissions..

I changed it so that it creates the package using CMake.. You closed #363 on 26th April, after @moatazelmasry2 asked you to separate it in multiple pull requests with a precise purpose for each.\nIt was the pull request itself which was rejected, not your fix.\nI created #632 because @chipitsine and I started cleaning up the code after adding the project to Coverity Scan.\nI didn't know about your pull request, otherwise I would've cherry-picked your commit..

I agree.. Yes.. No, we have to copy them manually as CPack doesn't support them.. It's missing also in the DEB packages.. Indeed.. Right.. The reason behind the original code is this:\nThere is a problem in your selection of --ifconfig endpoints [local=192.168.30.13, remote=192.168.30.1]. The local and remote VPN endpoints must exist within the same 255.255.255.252 subnet. This is a limitation of --dev tun when used with the TAP-WIN32 driver. Try 'openvpn --show-valid-subnets' option for more info.\nIt happens because the default topology is net30, we have to set it to subnet.. Done..

Try to check where the following function is failing:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/8f53bf23e71182be4a9b30da8a8eb79ee022cb95/src/BuildUtil/BuildUtilCommands.cs#L764-L907. What are the values of versionMajor, versionMinor and versionBuild?. You can now use CMake and Visual Studio 2017: #769\nThere is no support for building the installer yet, but you can run the binaries directly.\nTo install the service: vpnclient install.. @BlackHoleFox Sure, no problem!\nYou can either:\n\nImport the CMake project in Visual Studio 2017, which is what I personally recommend\nGenerate Visual Studio 2017 project files (default CMake generator)\nGenerate an NMake makefile by specifying -G \"NMake Makefiles\" (as we do with AppVeyor)\n\nRight now you probably have the Visual Studio 2017 project files, you should be able to build the solution.. Try to delete the build directories.. @BlackHoleFox I can't reproduce the issue.\nTry to delete the CMakeBuilds directory inside your user's directory, it contains the CMake cache.. > Once I actually grabbed the MFC C++ class support, this has fixed the issue. Visual Studio now seems to build everything fine, and the debug .exe's generated work as expected.\nMFC support is required because our .rc files include afxres.h, but we don't actually use MFC.\nOlder Visual Studio versions used to include afxres.h even if not required: https://stackoverflow.com/a/38785446\n\nNot sure if this is supposed to happen right now, but the vpnclient.exe will install the service, but cannot start it, even when trying a seperate /start command.\n\nvpnclient.exe installs the service when the /install parameter is specified, but you can test the service without installing it with the /test parameter.\nYou can also run the service with vpntest using the c command.. I see that you're using Cmder, which makes it easier:\n\nExecute vpntest c in a tab opened as administrator (in order to access the virtual network adapter).\nOpen a new tab and execute vpntest cm in order to run VPN Client Manager.\n\nYou can also run VPN Client Manager directly from Visual Studio after starting the client service.. It's only required to build the drivers: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk\nFor Visual Studio 2008 Express it's also required for ATL/MFC support.. Excellent, thank you very much!. @solipse @krugdenis Which version of Windows 10 are you running?\nI can't reproduce the issue on build 1607 and 1809.. I couldn't reproduce the issue on a fresh installation of Windows 7 x86 Service Pack 1.\nWhich version of Windows 7 and Windows 10 do you have (Home, Pro, ...)?. @chipitsine Definitely, we should provide all .pdb files in an archive.. Pull request: #811. https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/bf0d5c551e720e6e47a8e09cea27f16809c78699/src/Cedar/SW.c#L5177-L5184\nReadDump() returns NULL because warning_ru.txt is not found, SeekBuf() and WriteBuf() check whether the passed buffer is NULL, but at line 5184 we try to access the raw buffer in the non-existent buffer, causing a crash.\nThe ideal fix would be to check whether ReadDump() returns NULL. If it does we should try to read warning_en.txt and, if that file is missing too, we should exit with an alert window.. Unfortunately not, but you can use iptables with a local bridge.. What do you think about something like:\n```c\n// Hash calculation (digest algorithm name)\nUINT HashByName(char digest_name, void dest, void src, UINT size)\n{\n    const EVP_MD md;\n// Validate arguments\nif (IsEmptyStr(digest_name) || dest == NULL || src == NULL || size == 0)\n{\n    return 0;\n}\n\nmd = EVP_get_digestbyname(digest_name);\nif (md == NULL)\n{\n    Debug(\"HashByName(): Algorithm %s not found by EVP_get_digestbyname().\\n\", digest_name);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nreturn Hash(md, dest, src, size);\n\n}\n// Hash calculation (EVP_MD structure)\nUINT Hash(const EVP_MD md, void dest, void src, UINT size)\n{\n    EVP_MD_CTX ctx;\n    UINT len = 0;\n// Validate arguments\nif (md == NULL || dest == NULL || src == NULL || size == 0)\n{\n    return 0;\n}\n\nif OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10100000L\nctx = EVP_MD_CTX_new();\n\nelse\nctx = EVP_MD_CTX_create();\n\nendif\nif (EVP_DigestInit_ex(ctx, md, NULL) == false)\n{\n    Debug(\"Hash(): EVP_DigestInit_ex() failed with error: %s\\n\", ERR_error_string(ERR_get_error(), NULL));\n}\n\nif (EVP_DigestUpdate(ctx, src, size) == false)\n{\n    Debug(\"Hash(): EVP_DigestUpdate() failed with error: %s\\n\", ERR_error_string(ERR_get_error(), NULL));\n}\n\nif (EVP_DigestFinal_ex(ctx, dest, &len) == false)\n{\n    Debug(\"Hash(): EVP_DigestFinal_ex() failed with error: %s\\n\", ERR_error_string(ERR_get_error(), NULL));\n}\n\nif OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10100000L\nEVP_MD_CTX_free(ctx);\n\nelse\nEVP_MD_CTX_destroy(ctx);\n\nendif\nreturn len;\n\n}\n```.

Done.. Hi,\n\nhttps://www.softether.org/5-download/history says that the latest version is 4.28 9669\n\nThat's the latest version from the stable repository: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable\n\nBut the binary built from https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git has the different versions:\nFor client: 4.27 9667 (linux)\nFor server: 0.51 9657 (linux)\n\nThe current version is 5.01.9657:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/64b68c15f413d7c0313132a4c7164f46d74f0061/CMakeLists.txt#L4\nWe will increase it and create a new tag, once the packaging system is finished.\n\nDoes the binary built from here contains all fixes listed in the https://www.softether.org/5-download/history ?\n\nYes.. You're welcome.\nI agree that the virtual network adapter's driver should have the same version as the software.. Wait before merging, I'm doing some changes.. @hww3 I wanted to set your GitHub email address in the commit so that it counts as contribution, but it's not public.\nYou can set it with:\ngit commit --amend --author=\"Name Surname <email>\".

I created #759 to fix the issue, please test and review it.. You're welcome.. We will switch to shared libraries after #757 is merged.. Done: #761. Yes, see #767.. Hello!\nBy which causes all the games using BattlEye to be accelerated by softether you mean that the games which make use of BattlEye fail to start in case SoftEther VPN Client is running?. Does stopping the SoftEther VPN Client service let you participate in a match?. We should do that for hamcorebuilder too:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/b34d0366477191ff7581af87ceefb99579815778/src/hamcorebuilder/CMakeLists.txt#L5-L7. And also for install_wrapper_script:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/b34d0366477191ff7581af87ceefb99579815778/src/CMakeLists.txt#L6-L10. No problem.. Good idea, but I would do it in another pull request.. Thank you very much for your great feedback!\nDo you confirm that the SOCKS5 implementation works for you?. From AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/airj8d3jfh4bca23/artifacts/output%2Fpkg%2Fv5.01-9661-unstable-2018.10.30%2Fsoftether_open-vpnclient-v5.01-9661-unstable-2018.10.30-windows-x86_x64-intel.exe. Are you using OpenSC?. No worries, I asked if you were using OpenSC in order to know the name of the DLL file to add to SoftEther VPN.. Could you check if your YubiKey works with https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/ou31ib4eu4mqwttx/artifacts/output%2Fpkg%2Fv5.01-9662-unstable-2018.10.30%2Fsoftether_open-vpnclient-v5.01-9662-unstable-2018.10.30-windows-x86_x64-intel.exe, please?. Yes, the DLL file has to be in PATH.\n792 adds opensc\u2011pkcs11.dll to the list of DLL files, renaming it to P11STD9A.DLL is not required.. Did you download the installer from the link I sent?. I found the issue: the string contained a Unicode character (non-breaking hyphen) instead of -, sorry for that.\nI fixed the string and also improved Win32SecureLoadLibraryEx() so that it loads the library from the default installation directory, meaning that you don't have to copy it in System32 anymore.\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/id0vx0ramdn93lgw/artifacts/output%2Fpkg%2Fv5.01-9662-unstable-2018.10.30%2Fsoftether_open-vpnclient-v5.01-9662-unstable-2018.10.30-windows-x86_x64-intel.exe\n\nIs there any way that you can add native support for Yubikey instead of having to use opensc?\n\nDoes renaming ykmd.dll to P11STD9A.DLL work?. Unfortunately I'm unable to check whether the driver actually works because I don't have a security key.. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Thank you very much for your contribution!. No problem.. > Would it be possible to bump the digest to SHA256, as SHA1 has been shown to produce collisions? Source\nYes.\n\nAnother thing as well, could the 128 bit be bumped to 256? All modern OpenVPN clients (Android, iOS, Windows and Linux) support it.\n\nI don't think it's worth the performance difference, consider that our OpenVPN function is mostly used where SoftEther VPN Client is not available (eg. routers, smartphones, tablets, etc.).. > The local test link is successful, and going back to test the game UDP will delay at night.\nI was waiting for your reply before merging it.. No problem, I merged the pull request.\nAbout the local routing table (#765), I understand the importance of such a function and it's definitely something we will implement as soon as possible.. Done.. Thank you very much for reporting the issue!\nI created #804 to fix the error, please test and review it.. > @davidebeatrici , what do you think, should we add the most recent libressl to travis-ci ?\nYes.. @chinamore You may be interested in this, as you mentioned that you would like to use OpenVPN's local routing function: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/801#issuecomment-436459517.\n. We can't, because also the packet including the options is scrambled/obfuscated.. However, we could support clients with different scrambling/obfuscation options (except the XOR mask) by trying to parse the packet with every method available until it succeeds.\nThen, we can keep the method number saved in a variable for the next packets.. I understand, thank you very much for your feedback.. > However, we could support clients with different scrambling/obfuscation options (except the XOR mask) by trying to parse the packet with every method available until it succeeds.\n\nThen, we can keep the method number saved in a variable for the next packets.\n\n@chipitsine Done.. > hi, I actually have no idea how to test (or review) this particular PR.\n\nopenvpn scrambling is significant part of Tunnelblick.\nlet us kindly ask @jkbullard for review :)\n\nYou can download OpenVPN's source code, apply the patch, compile it and test the various options.\nMy request for review was mostly for the code, to see if it can be improved for example.\n\nSorry, but I can't comment on the code because I am not familiar with SoftEtherVPN's code base.\nAnd I don't have much to say about the openvpn-xorpatch itself beyond what is at https://tunnelblick.net/cOpenvpn_xorpatch.html except to point out that it does not scramble the first byte of the packet. This may make it more vulnerable to detection than is generally recognized.\nIf it is of any help in making the decision to accept/refuse this PR, though, it is my intention to continue maintaining Tunnelblick's version of the openvpn_xorpatch.\n\nThank you very much for your reply.\nMy pull request is based on Tunnelblick's openvpn_xorpatch and I tested it on Linux using OpenVPN with the patch applied.\nIt would be good if you could test it with Tunnelblick, but I don't think it's necessary.. You're welcome!. The @ symbol is used to determine the user's virtual hub, we should probably add a setting to specify a different character.. Sure, but we should use @ as default in order not to break the login for updated servers.. Better: a config option to specify the character, with @ being the default.. Done.. The OpenSSL static libraries in the repository have been updated to version 1.1.1 in #738, the ciphers you mentioned should be available in the latest builds.\nWhat do you mean by \"they are not in the default builds\"?. > Understood, they are not available for selection in GUI manager for Windows version 4.28\nIn vpncmd release v5.01.9663 available and works.\nRelated issue: #360\n\nWindows GUI manager v5.01.9663 I did not test, it looks like the installer is broken, closes during installation.\n\nRelated issue: #689. Thank you very much for your contribution!\n\nI wonder if you could expand on your guidelines for submitting a pull request, starting by telling a person they need to create a fork.\n\nWe will probably create a \"first contribution guide\" in future, with detailed steps on how to create a pull request and the basics of Git.\n\nAnd it looks like every line of the file I modified got flagged by the diff, I think because of the line endings change.\n\nYes, it's because of the line endings: the file in master uses CRLF, yours uses LF.\nWhat operating system did you use to commit the changes?\n\nIs there a way I should have done this request that would work better?\n\nYou should use a dedicated branch in your forked repository to submit a pull request, ideally creating a new one each time you propose a change. That way there can be multiple open pull requests at the same time and you can keep track of your changes better.. > So, I think you are saying that after I fork, then clone my fork onto my\nmachine, I should branch my fork for each \"project\" I work on, is that\ncorrect?\nCorrect.\nYou can also clone this repository and then add yours as new remote.\n\nNow that I have done the pull request on an unbranched clone, how do I fix\nthat, is there a way to move that to a branch?\n\nYou can switch to a new branch with git checkout -b branch-name, however this pull request is tied to master.\n\nHow do I, and should I update my repository to get the line endings changes?\n\nSince this is a cross-platform project, the right thing to do would be to convert the line endings to LF for all files.\nTo keep the commit \"clean\", I would create a new one which changes the line endings from CRLF to LF.\nIn order to do that, you can:\n```\nRemove the last commit and keep its changes in the tree\ngit reset HEAD~\nCopy the edited file somewhere\ncp src/BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs src/BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs.new\nRestore the original file\ngit checkout -- src/BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs\nChange the line endings from CRLF to LF\ndos2unix src/BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs\nStage changes for the next commit\ngit add -u\nCreate commit\ngit commit -m \"BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs: change line endings from CRLF to LF\"\nMove the edited file to the right place\nmv src/BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs.new src/BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs\nStage changes for the next commit\ngit add -u\nCreate commit\ngit commit -m \"BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs: Fix an issue with building on Visual Studio 2008\"\nPush branch to the remote (-f specifies \"forced\", required because we removed a commit)\ngit push -f\n```. You're welcome.\nYou changed the line endings correctly, however you did it for the entire repository.\nI propose to:\n```\nSwitch to a new branch\ngit checkout -b crlf-to-lf\nRemove last commit\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1\nUpdate previous commit's message (something like \"Change line endings from CRLF to LF\") and update timestamp (\"--reset-author\" does it automatically)\ngit commit --amend --reset-author\nPush the current branch to the remote (\"-u\" sets it as upstream. \"origin\" is the main remote, which currently corresponds to your forked repository)\ngit push -u origin\n```\nAnd then create a new pull request. Once that pull request is merged, I will explain you how to update this one.\nA Git guide for starters I would recommend is https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide.. ```\nClone master repository\ngit clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git\nMove inside the repository\ncd SoftEtherVPN\nAdd your forked repository as remote\ngit remote add linush100 git@github.com:linush100/SoftEtherVPN.git\nCreate a dedicated branch for your pull request\ngit checkout -b visual-studio-2008-architecture-check-fix\nChange line endings from CRLF to LF\ndos2unix src/BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs\nStage changes for the next commit\ngit add -u\nCreate commit\ngit commit -m \"BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs: change line endings from CRLF to LF\"\nStage changes for the next commit (after fixing the issue inside the file)\ngit add -u\nCreate commit\ngit commit -m \"BuildUtil/VpnBuilder.cs: Fix an issue with building on Visual Studio 2008\"\nPush branch to the remote (\"-u\" sets it as upstream. \"linush100\" is your remote)\ngit push -u linush100\n``. You can restore the original files withgit checkout ... It should, indeed. You can see the changes withgit diff.. What's your currentautocrlfsetting? You can see it withgit config --get core.autocrlf` (it doesn't print anything if it's not set).. I would do it in a dedicated pull request.. It's the intended behavior, because the operating system is supposed to be sending a DHCP request through the virtual network interface, which is what happens on Windows.\nOn Linux you have to do it manually, before the client times out. You could set up a script for OpenVPN to do it automatically:\ndhcp-manager.sh\n```bash\n!/bin/bash\ncase $script_type in\nup)\n    echo \"Requesting IP address for ${dev} from DHCP server...\"\n    dhclient -v \"${dev}\"\n    ;;\ndown)\n    echo \"Releasing ${dev}'s DHCP lease...\"\n    dhclient -r \"${dev}\"\n    ;;\nesac\n```\nIn OpenVPN's configuration:\nup dhcp-manager.sh\ndown dhcp-manager.sh. You're welcome!\nThe OpenVPN server acts as a DHCP server when you set the network in its configuration, otherwise it doesn't send the IP address because it isn't a DHCP client.\nWe can implement the feature in SoftEther VPN, with a client-side environment variable such as UV_NO_DHCP to disable it.. The client timing out turned out to be an OpenVPN bug, we implemented a workaround in #828.\n827 implements the desired feature, however in Layer 2 mode the DHCP lease is supposed to be requested by the client and not by an intermediary entity (the VPN server).\nDo you still want the feature, now that the timeout issue is not present anymore?. You're welcome!\n\n827 implements the desired feature, however in Layer 2 mode the DHCP lease is supposed to be requested by the client and not by an intermediary entity (the VPN server).\n\nWe're probably not going to merge #827 for this reason, sorry.. No problem.. From https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/822#issuecomment-443468790:\n\n827 implements the desired feature, however in Layer 2 mode the DHCP lease is supposed to be requested by the client and not by an intermediary entity (the VPN server).. Could you check the metric of the virtual network adapter and the physical one, please?. The headers in the source files have to be changed.. Done!. You're welcome!. To maintain Free()'s current behavior, I'm going to create FreeSafe().. 2018-12-21 13:12:57.122 [HUB \"DEFAULT\"] Connection \"CID-01\": User authentication failed. The user name that has been provided was \"\".\n\nIs your certificate's common name set?. The username is determined by the certificate's common name only when it's not specified by the user:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/0cf6fac7a37db96e3174dfda55115af5bf9909ab/src/Cedar/Protocol.c#L7125-L7137\nIf the username on the server is not matching with the certificate's common name, you can specify it in OpenVPN for Android by selecting User/PW + Certificates instead of Certificates.\nIn OpenVPN's configuration you can specify auth-user-pass along with the certificate and key.. I agree.. softether-common_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnbridge_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnclient_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpncmd_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnserver_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nYou mean this one?. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Has SoftEther VPN Server been compiled after 8ec43e76182227a308d5c40ee66d5eb49fce0197 was merged?\nThe list of available ciphers is unavailable when the RPC call fails.. I created #862 to fix the issue, please test and review it.. Also on Linux a crash happens in case of a double free, the behavior is probably different between OpenSSL and LibreSSL.. @solipse Could you test this pull request again, please?. Excellent, thank you very much for testing.. Hi, which OpenSSL version are you using?\nCVE-2011-1473 seems to be restricted to OpenSSL version 0.9.8 and before.. I deleted the duplicate comment.\nAre you experiencing the issue mentioned in CVE-2011-1473?\n\"OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, and 0.9.8m through 1.x, does not properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection\". Could you tell me what did you use to scan for the vulnerability, please?. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Maximum allowed artifact storage size of 90000 Mb will be exceeded., not related to the pull request.\nCould you clean your master branch or create a dedicated one and a new pull request, please?. > sorry, what should I clean? I've changed only 3 files, 3 lines of code in total. Please clarify what should I do? if I create new branch, it'll contain the same 3 files + 3 lines of code.\nLook at the commits.. > It is a bug in appveyor. I've found a lot of same issues. As for my commit it changes only 3 lines of code. I think any next commit to this project will fail with the same appveyor error.\nThe AppVeyor build failing is not the issue. There are 4 unrelated commits in this pull request.. Ideally, you should rebase your master branch against the one in this repository and then create a new branch from it each time you want to create a pull request.\nAlso, I strongly recommend to enable Git's automatic rebase:\ngit config --global pull.rebase true\nThat way merge commits such as 1ba1afb1c0b95beda5cadc13652f74af61fcf62e are not generated.. Squash your last 3 commits and cherry-pick them in another branch.\nYou can then cherry-pick those commits in your master branch again if you don't want to create a new pull request.. You have to pull forcibly from this repository's master branch.. The extra commits would probably end up in our master branch.. @macvk I fixed everything for you.. You're welcome.. Thank you very much for your contribution!. Excellent!. I would flip the logic:\nc++\nelse if (!c->ClientCert.PreverifyErr)\n{\n    OvsLog(s, se, c, \"LO_CLIENT_NO_CERT\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    OvsLog(s, se, c, \"LO_CLIENT_UNVERIFIED_CERT\", c->ClientCert.PreverifyErrMessage);\n}. Unrelated change.. The bracket should be in a new line, to maintain consistency with the current code style.. I would change this into a bool.. Or use PreverifyOk:\nc++\nelse if (c->ClientCert.PreverifyOk)\n{\n    OvsLog(s, se, c, \"LO_CLIENT_NO_CERT\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    OvsLog(s, se, c, \"LO_CLIENT_UNVERIFIED_CERT\", c->ClientCert.PreverifyErrMessage);\n}. Different line break (CRLF instead of LF).\n. I would write an explicit cast:\nc++\nclientcert->PreverifyOk = static_cast<bool>(preverify_ok);. Oh, I didn't notice that it isn't a C++ file, sorry.. Wrong indentation (spaces instead of tabs).. Can't this be removed, as it's specified in the matrix?. See comment above.. Extra tab (should be an empty line).. Unrelated change.. Two extra tabs (should be an empty line).. The asterisk(s) should be attached to the variable name, to maintain consistency with the rest of the source code.. If dest is NULL, then dest->Session must be NULL too.. Right, because it dereferences a NULL pointer.\nI propose to use a separated if statement to check whether dest is NULL.. I created a test program to see what happens.\nSegmentation fault, as expected.. Extra empty line.\nUnfortunately it can't be removed, as the source branch doesn't exist anymore.. Unfortunately I don't have write access to your branch, as I'm not part of the team.\nYou can add changes to the pull request by committing them in your Run_deadlock branch.\nDon't worry about squashing the commits, it can be done when merging the pull request. :). Done.. Right.. Fixed.. Right.. Done.. Using EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() seems to be the best solution at the moment.. Using EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() seems to be the best solution at the moment.. Right.. I would rewrite the comment:\n// When debugging on Windows, you can use DebugView from SysInternals or similar tools to view debug messages. You're welcome, thank you for applying the changes!. Why is this now called t2 instead of t?. Right.\nI think that the variables should have a better name, such as RpcEnumHub and RpcListenerList.. I would leave the names as they are, for now.\nWe could create an issue in order to discuss about it and decide what to do in future.. Feel free to create the issue, if you want to.. This is the name of the build, where {build} is the incremental number.\nI think that we should change it to something else, Build-1 and Build-2 doesn't sound very nice.. Yes, Visual Studio 2015 is the default image.\nI'm going to specify it explicitly.. {build} is required.\nWhat about {build}-{commit-sha1}?. mac[0] = 0x5E should be mac[0] == 0x5E.. I would replace the function instead of renaming it, as the old implementation is not used anymore.\nIt also makes it easier to look at the changes.\n. The string should be added to strtable_tw.stb as well.. I would change the sentence to:\nAfter reinstalling the Virtual Network Adapter driver, the current Virtual Network Adapter's MAC address will change. Also, all TCP/IP settings within the Virtual Network Adapter will reset.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case the reinstalled Virtual Network Adapter fails to work, delete it and create a new one. If it still doesn't work properly, please create a new Virtual Network Adapter with a different name.. I would move this part above HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE LATEST SOURCE CODE PACKAGE.. I would change the sentence to:\nI hereby agree in advance that my work will be licensed automatically under the Apache License or a similar BSD/MIT-like open-source license in case the SoftEther VPN Project adopts such a license in future.. I would change the sentence to:\nPRELIMINARY DECLARATION FOR FUTURE SWITCH TO A NON-GPL LICENSE. You're welcome.. You're welcome.. AppVeyor has Visual C++ 2008 Espress, as you can see on the Build Environment page.. I didn't try to install Visual Studio 2008 Espress locally, but it should work without any problems.\nWhat problem are you encountering?. MFC is part of the Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0, did you install it in the default path?. No problem.. The Windows Driver Kit folders were already added as include and library directories in some projects, such as Neo6, prior to #498:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/94e2e37cc18a6f705eda1a6056b4737feb4f7d02/src/Neo6/Neo6.vcproj#L51\nI don't know whether Visual Studio 2008 automatically installs Windows Driver Kit, but according to the previous directory name (7600.16385.0) it's an older version.. From CMake's documentation:\nFATAL_ERROR    = CMake Error, stop processing and generation. Build-Depends specifies the dependencies required to build the package.. Done.. Yes.. I think we should add it to the Travis CI matrix, yes, as conformance to FIPS 140-2 is very important for a VPN software.. Could you remove the space before the opening bracket, please?. then -> than. This link is for Visual Studio 2008 Professional, it's a 90 days trial.\nVisual Studio 2008 Express: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=104679.

I would change the sentence to:\nEnvironment variable OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR not set, using default Homebrew path: /usr/local/opt/openssl/. Typo: disconnec -> disconnect. Typo: Clien -> Client. Typo: Clien -> Client. Typo: Clien -> Client. #ifdef OS_UNIX. #ifdef OS_UNIX. #ifdef OS_UNIX. This is wrong, as every packet larger than ping_signature is ignored.\nIt should be:\nc\nif (!

Or, for better readability:\nc\nconst bool isPingPacket = size >= sizeof(ping_signature) && Cmp(data, ping_signature, sizeof(ping_signature)) == 0;\nif (!isPingPacket). Oh, sorry, I didn't notice you changed == 0  to != 0.. The bracket should be in a new line.. Remove the space before the bracket, to maintain consistency with the style.. Wrong indentation (spaces instead of tabs).. No, I think that we should write them in the Wiki.. The correct term would be \"inconsistent\".\nWe can use clang-tidy to check that the code style is consistent.. I like the current code style, except for the brackets position.\nI would prefer\nc\nif (condition) {\n    Debug(\"condition == true\");\n}\ninstead of\nc\nif (condition)\n{\n    Debug(\"condition == true\");\n}\nWhat do you think?. It's true that no rules are defined, but it's bad to have different code styles.. https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/7be6b3a3f01ba23d40c9b7155908d1588f5b7b6a/src/Mayaqua/Network.c#L660-L675. Look at the difference between lines 667-668-669-670 and the others.. The margin.. That doesn't change the fact that the spacing looks different, it's not about the language.. I understand that we don't have any rules now, but the current code style is consistent and it probably has been for the past 15 years. Why do you want to break it just because we don't have any rules which \"enforce\" a well-defined code style?.

OpenVPN 2.4 still uses BF-CBC as default cipher, I don't think it's a good idea to comment out the setting.. No, it doesn't.. The @ character is currently considered as invalid character in the username, I'm going to fix this behavior.. Oh, sorry.\nIn case there are multiple separators, only the last is used to split the string. In your example, the username would be chipitsine@gmail.com and the hub name mail.ru.. @ is used, we check whether the character is usable with IsPrintableAsciiChar().. We always copy after the separator character:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/b8629f324f81aff488f461468c4b44593b847513/src/Cedar/Proto_PPP.c#L837\nHowever, it's not a problem because we check whether the hub exists:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/8a58af86b131b786a8b605851302cb1d541bfe78/src/Cedar/Proto_PPP.c#L839-L849. Shouldn't 255.255.255.240 be 255.255.255.255?. Shouldn't this be handled in SiLoadInitialConfiguration()?. I understand, thank you very much for the detailed explanation.. No problem, for consistency we can move both in a dedicated pull request.. Copy-paste mistake?. That's incorrect, as it changes the local variable's value.\nI will create a macro in order to set the passed variable's value.. Typo: COMPILER_AVALIABLE_OPTIONS -> COMPILER_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS.

I use it and it works well and I don't think I've ever seen anyone complain about the security of OpenVPN, unless you know otherwise. :). @vainkop \nIf you think this is important then submit a pull request.\nYou could, on the other hand, wait until the changes in the development model for this project become more effective - give the developers a chance to clean-up the code and make some progress with the development of this project.. Pointing someone the the SoftEther forums assumes they want to fight their way through the continuing spam that's posted on there. Nobody ever cleans it up and the content on there is a disgrace.. Is there any update on whether there will be rpms provided for centos (in my case)? I have built them in the past on a test server but the current master branch fails horribly, not being a developer I'm struggling to get this working again.\nI'd also suggest that providing prebuilt installable packages might help in the update of SoftEtherVPN, not everyone has the ability or resources to build these packages and ease of installation is always a bonus for some users. :). Is there any update on the progress of a 'fork' of this project?. That's an interesting article and expresses the problem very clearly, unfortunately it offers no solutions. What can be done to move to a more dynamic model of development that will protect the life of the project and enhance the stability, reliability and security of the project?\nThere is, as far as I can see, no evident movement forward on the ideas expressed in this thread. In addition, the forums for SoftEtherVPN are a haven for spammers selling counterfeit goods, illegal goods, and various other nefarious products designed to separate a visitor from their hard earned cash.. That's fantastic news, I look forward to this project moving ahead - thanks for the update. :)\nUnfortunately I'm not a developer so I can't do much in that area, any chance we could get some movement for the forums getting cleaned-up from all the spam/spammers on there?. I'd agree that it is about time something was done about the forums. In my opinion the major problem with the forums is the lack of management and effective moderation. There are plug-ins that can allow a moderator to mark a thread as solved. If you're a moderator then you can edit the first post and that allows you to edit the thread title to mark it as solved but that too long-winded.\nSpam, there are also effective plug-ins that can get rid of most of the spam and my guess is they aren't implemented. Spammers should be banned (and their posts removed) immediately but that doesn't seem to be happening as the posts and users accounts are visible for years.\nThe forums software allows subscriptions to specific threads (or boards) and you should get a notification but I'm not sure if there's a feature to get an email notification about a thread update.\nThe above features might all depend on addition plug-ins or more recent versions of the software  and again, that needs someone to manage the forums (software).\nI would agree with you about the general state of the forums and that something needs to be done. I'm a moderator on a forum that has the some phpBB software and I see very little (almost none) spam and if anyone posts with spam links they're banned immediately I see them.\nIf you're not getting email notifications then it's possible to get an rss feed to these forums, I use quiteRSS for that and a scrape can be scheduled as often as you like and I find that better than getting a ton of email notifications.\nUnfortunately I have a feeling that this subject isn't likely to go very far or fast but it does need doing. It's a shame really as this is a great product that could, and should, be in widespread use. Although I'm a novice with VPN software I found this SoftEtherVPN far easier to set-up and configure than comparable products.\nBTW, you do an excellent job of helping on the forums. :). Yes, I noticed when the forums were upgraded and the prolific spammer was deleted - that was a job well done and quick. :)\nI don't really think that most of the spam (or spammers) gets deleted, if you look at the link above for my forum thread on this topic and click on some of the links there you'll see that most of those users have not been banned and therefore the posts are still visible on the internet and one of those has two thousand plus posts.\nI do understand the problem as I have been a moderator on a fairly large/busy forum for the past twelve years. They also use phpbb and we get between one and ten posts a month, there are good plugins for the forum software that will keep most of the spammers away.\nI have said this before but if you need additional help moderating the forums then I'm willing to help.\nThanks again for this great software and I'm looking forward to the project moving forward with the upcoming 'fork', that's a brave and exciting change and if the forums are cleaned it wiil be more welcoming to new users.. It would be useful to have more admins, at least they could cover different timezones and hopefully catch a few more spammers. My additional 2c worth, it would also be helpful if we had some timeline to improvements to the forum software with regards to implementing some of the plug-ins for catching spammers i.e.: stopforumspam; don't let members add signatures without a minimum number of forum posts.\nI will say this again, most of the spammers that I report don't get removed and are still visible on the forums. For a welcoming, helpful and open forum this spam problem needs addressing as soon as possible.\nAs far as I'm concerned this issue can be closed.\nBTW, @moatazelmasry2 - you're doing a great job of filling up my mailbox with all this hard work you're doing on these issues. :). You just need to post whether you prefer option 1 or 2. :). I wholeheartedly agree with an initiative such as this, it can only be beneficial to the project. :). My choice would be for it to stay on a 'forum' and get some more moderators that have the time to remove spam etc.\nI've been reporting spam on these forum almost from the day I joined and there's still a ton of spammers (some with thousands of posts) posting a load of rubbish (illegal in a lot of cases) and those posts are still there. All it would take on the current forum is an admin to ban the user and all the 3000+ for that user would go.\nKeeping it in a forum only takes a bit of effort in the beginning but, IMO, it's worth the effort.. As I've mentioned before, I'm a moderator on a large forum that uses the same software as SoftEther and I do not see any spam on those forums apart from a couple of posts per month that end up in moderation. The reason for that is the forum software has plugins that restrict who can post by doing a lookup for their IP address - most of the spam is stopped by that plugin. In addition you could have policies in place that restrict who can add signatures to their profile, you could even stop that altogether if it suits you.\nIn addition, you need moderators/admins than can (and should) remove/ban any user that actually manages to post on the forums - that's what keeps them clean.\nI've mentioned many times that there's still a ton of spam on the forums and many registered users that have thousands of post - these have never been banned, all it takes is for a moderator to ban that user and all the posts get removed and their IP is passed to the anti-spam plugin for others to benefit from that information.\nI suppose one of my questions is why don't the current moderators take the time to ban those users? If they don't have the time then recruit more moderators or is there a problem of trust in doing that?\nI still think that most end-users are more comfortable with a forum rather than github or google groups and stackoverflow is more for developers and, I believe, intimidating to end users. I believe that all of those are not suitable for inexperienced en-users.. One of the best plug-ins is stopforumspam or Akismet which is mentioned in this blog post: https://michelkraemer.com/5-anti-spam-measures-for-phpbb3/. That must have been quite an horrendous task getting rid of all that 'mess', well done. :)\nI'm surprised, amazed and honoured to be a moderator, I'll try my best to keep the forums clean. I've had a quick trial of various bits on the forums and no great surprises but a couple of questions.\nI'd like to suggest that a 'private' forum for moderators/admins is created where we can ask questions without cluttering github, is that possible?\n. Although I'm just a user I would agree this proposal and with davidbeatrici that it should be changed to the least restrictive type of licence.

I use this kind of configuration to set a routing metric on SoftEther interfaces in the /etc/network/interfaces file like this:\niface tap_foobar inet dhcp\n  metric 200\nSoftEther has some latent bugs involving Linux interface plumbing.  You are more likely to get a good result if SoftEther creates the tun interface instead of something like tunctl.\n. @lerys, most people that could help you will ignore this issue ticket because the log records were modified.\nRunning SecureNAT on a bridged physical interface is contraindicated by the SoftEther documentation and could explain the excessive CPU usage and broadcast storm.  Move the SecureNAT function to a different virtual hub, or reconfigure the LAN gateway to handle VPN clients through the existing L2 bridge.\nPast that, broadcast traffic to port 137 is probably SMB/CIFS discovery chatter.\n. @quentinhardy, no, but the native OpenVPN client for Android is compatible with the SoftEther server implementation (and usually performs better than alternatives like L2TP and IPSec).\n.

It would provide an additional connectivity option that would likely run on top of SoftEther\u2019s Virtual Adapter. I suggest you try out the Tor Browser Bundle to see how it works and all of the advantages integrating it would bring. Tor's SOCKS Server allows the user to configure any browser or IRC client to use encrypted network, while transmitting all the other traffic over the standard network connection.\nIf you've ever used TOR, you'd see how useful it is to not encrypt everything such as file sharing programs or streaming Netflix. Even more importantly, it prevents you from accidentally sending unencrypted confidential data. If SoftEther supported SOCKS access, when the VPN goes down, the app configured to use SOCKS will just stop working. \nWhile there are many open source SOCKS servers such as SS5 , dante, or 3proxy, none of them natively work well with SoftEther.

    "jdstroy": "Take a look at fail2ban for nix and nix clones, or take a look at the answers to this question on Server Fault.  Implementing such a policy-level feature in SoftEther seems like excessive \"bloat\" to me.\n. Hello,\nNo.  I'm running a Linux server and a Windows client.  The Linux server has the SecureNAT feature enabled, along with the Virtual DHCP Server. When I connect to the Linux server through SoftEther, the Virtual DHCP Server returns a default gateway.\nThinking about this a little bit more, I think I understand what's happening.  The SoftEther client isn't changing routes, but because the adapter appears to be a regular Ethernet adapter, Windows performs the usual procedure of attempting to run a DHCP client on it.  When the SoftEther Virtual DHCP Server provides the DHCP lease, the lease contains a default gateway -- so even though I've asked the SoftEther Client not to change the routing table, the routing table is affected anyway due to the DHCP lease from the server.\nIt would be nice if there was a way to mimic the behavior from Windows, where the IP address and subnet mask are both obtained from the server, but the default gateway is ignored.  I can see how the current behavior makes sense from an implementation point of view: the SoftEther client is merely attaching an Ethernet network adapter, and everything beyond that is not under its control\n. Would it make sense, alternatively, to allow the SoftEther VPN client to negotiate with the server on what it wants from the DHCP server, out-of-band?  I'm not sure what policies SoftEther VPN enforces, if any -- like, would it be possible for the VPN server to prevent bridging a client virtual VPN adapter onto a physical network?\n. The strategy outlined above has been implemented in other tools before (see tcp-over-dns, dnscat, and iodine).  One could probably cobble something together combine the projects with SoftEther for actual VPN over DNS.  (tcp-over-dns uses polling to achieve server-initiated transactions.)\n. ",

Yeah, hopefully, they (or someone else) would come up with that solution.\nFew things that need to happen because the way Linux network implementation work is:\n1) Add the  to the VPN server through current network device (so it can still talk to the VPN server after default is switched to VPN)\n2) Obtain default gateway from the VPN server on the VPN network device\n3) Change the default to that VPN device\nThe tricky part is when the adapter and address is changed, etc. It's almost like one will need to implement whole DHCP client to be able to handle this.\n. @ezgoen I think you should send in a pull request if the fix is available on your tree.\nI've applied the change to my tree because I found it's useful for my private build distributions\nhttps://github.com/hsaito/SoftEtherVPN/commit/a4a53e4c0a5aed691142317d2d7287f0a901a2df\nI don't want you to feel like I'm stealing your \"idea\" but if you want me to issue pull request on your behalf, I can do that too. Let me know!\n. I choose option 1 which which allows you to apply the same patch into PacketiX VPN.\n. Within the distribution, there are currently few places that it can end up, depending on how you install it.\nFrom source, doing 'make install', looks like most ends up in /usr/bin, with setting files in /usr/vpnserver, /usr/vpnbridge, /usr/vpnclient, and /usr/vpncmd.\nCurrent debian config file expects /opt\nI think this from the fact that the code expects that the config file to sit in the same directory as an executable itself.\nConsidering anyone can pretty much specify any place with the prefix. Perhaps I suppose I (or someone else) can add sed script of some sort to Makefile to adopt to the PREFIX on the Makefile. \n. Superseded by #180 because of my fault handling the commit.

Aren't you using L3(tap) mode client?\nIn L3 mode, OpenVPN client doesn't send MAC address to server.\n. L2TP server and client use same UDP port.\nYou can't run these at same time on one PC.\n.

Each entry must be specified in the \"IP network address/subnet mask/gateway IP address\" format.\nThis Virtual DHCP Server can push the classless static routes (RFC 3442) with DHCP reply messages to VPN clients.\nWhether or not a VPN client can recognize the classless static routes (RFC 3442) depends on the target VPN client software. PacketiX VPN Client and OpenVPN Client are supporting the classless static routes. On L2TP/IPsec and MS-SSTP protocols, the compatibility depends on the implementation of the client software. You can realize the split tunneling if you clear the default gateway field on the Virtual DHCP Server options. On the client side, L2TP/IPsec and MS-SSTP clients need to be configured not to set up the default gateway for the split tunneling usage.\nYou can also push the classless static routes (RFC 3442) by your existing external DHCP server. In that case, disable the Virtual DHCP Server function on SecureNAT, and you need not to set up the classless routes on this command.\nSee the RFC 3442 to understand the classless routes.\n. Why do you want to use SSL 3.0?. Thank you for reporting the problem.\nI'll fix it.. I'll try to deal with it.. Append '/tcp' to the server name to use TCP.\nAppend '/' to use UDP..

Since the metric value is a parameter of the IP layer, it is not related to the type of the device.\nThere is the possibility that some third party application is manipulating the routing table. (For example, the software that comes with WiFi device may lower WiFi priority on Ethernet connection.)\nWhy do not you check the routing table in the connected state?. Is 192.168.1.X for your LAN?\nIt seems that the LAN has priority.\nCould you disable DHCP on your VPN virtual NIC and static IP address for it (without default gateway)?. SoftEther VPN protocol is a Layer-2 VPN protocol.\nBasically, client don't care about IP address.\nPlease try DHCP client to get IP address.\n(Do not forget to statically add a route to the VPN server if the default gateway update masks the route to the VPN server.). Windows client only monitor DHCP packets. DHCP request is sent by Windows OS.\nOf course, routing is processed by OS.. The client makes virtual NIC online when connection is established.\nWhen Windows detect NIC raised to online, Windows sends DHCP request.. SoftEther VPN doesn't support cert auth with openvpn protocol.. It contains non-executable resources.\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/tree/master/src/bin/hamcore\n.

Please see the logs at https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/472\n. I cannot do this, because the VPN Server is being run by the third party. I will try to set it up in a VM, but I cannot promise that I can reproduce their setup and the failure.\n. The options string from a client built with --enable-small is always:\nOption Strings Received: \"V0 UNDEF\"\n. The options string from a full client is:\nOption Strings Received: \"V4,dev-type tun,link-mtu 1557,tun-mtu 1500,proto UDPv4,cipher AES-128-CBC,auth SHA1,keysize 128,key-method 2,tls-client\"\n. Why does it need to negotiate this? IMHO relying on the client for such critical security setting is a security bug.\n. OK, I take back the \"security bug\" statement, as it would be a different bug anyway. But could you please specify a use case when several different option strings are acceptable?\nI still think that it would make sense for SoftEther VPN either not to fail in this situation at all, or to fail with a better client-side error message (if the protocol allows it). And it is possible to avoid the failure, by mapping \"V0 UNDEF\" to the options string that an official client would have sent when given a config generated by the OpenVpnMakeConfig command.\n. OK to DefaultOpenVPNOptionString idea, as long as it also gets reflected in the file generated by the OpenVpnMakeConfig command.\n. Thanks for the explanation!\n. I have tested this build. It allows the small client to connect.\n. The previous \"it connects\" comment only applies to the SoftEther VPN server with the default encryption options. I have not tried to change encryption parameters.\n. So far, I have tested that it is fixed in the default configuration of the server. However, if my understanding is correct, it is not fully resolved, because there is no guarantee that this option string is equivalent to what the official OpenVPN client would send if given the config file generated by OpenVpnMakeConfig.. I have no concrete details, sorry, and I am not interested in testing SoftEther myself. Basically, here are the facts and ideas that I am basing my suspicion of incomplete fix on:\n\nThere is OpenVpnMakeConfig command that can generate openvpn configs.\nIt can put various options into the generated configs, that depend on SoftEther VPN server settings. Speculative guess about relevant options: cipher, tun, tap.\nThe config that is generated can be read by the OpenVPN instance on a home router, compiled without OCC, or on a PC, compiled with OCC.\nSoftEther VPN makes some decisions based on the option string sent by the client.\nIf the client sends \"V0 UNDEF\", then the default option string comes into play.\nThere is a OpenVPNDefaultClientOption directive, which sets the default option string, hopefully allowing small clients to connect.\nThe \"default default\" client option string is just a static string that does not depend on any other SoftEther VPN options, thus creating the need to configure certain settings twice - once in other directives, and once in OpenVPNDefaultClientOption, in order to allow small clients to connect.\n\nWell, all of the above is theoretical. The test plan would be to create a SoftEther VPN server that emulates a TAP OpenVPN server, then generate an OpenVPN client config, then try to connect with normal client, and try to connect with a small client, and this all should either work without the need to set  OpenVPNDefaultClientOption, or without such option there must be a prominent warning in SoftEther VPN log that the default client option is not compatible with the configured settings. So that admins that are educated enough to read logs don't create servers incompatible with small OpenVPN clients by mistake.. ",

Anyone can open a launchpad.. We have no way to check that these packages haven't had malicious code added..

The softether devs need to protect the website. \nThe problem we are trying to solve is that any man in the middle (eg ISP, wifi, government) can change the file for another as I download it from a http website and I currently don't have any way of verifying the checksum (from a HTTPS website). \nIf there is a checksum file (posted on a https website), then I can download the file insecurely, but verify it (securely) from the checksum posted on a https website. Then I know nobody has changed the file in transit. \nThe best way would be if the checksum file is signed with a GPG signature, which would ALSO protect from the website being hacked, as you say.\n. For example see here the parts about the GPG verification. https://www.howtogeek.com/246332/how-to-verify-a-downloaded-linux-iso-file-wasnt-tampered-with/. @macvk this ticket is not about being watched, see other tickets for that. \nThis is about closing a problem that any attacker can exploit while a user is downloading softether. For example, someone sharing my cafe wifi could modify softether in-flight, and install whatever they want on my computer with the same privileges I use to install softether.. @macvk great, so we can agree it is a good idea and being done for windows. \nNow let's make some progress on the other OSes, especially since a lot of Softether VPN endpoints are linux servers. . @moatazelmasry2 travis ci sounds good.

    "BlackHoleFox": "The current method requires adding a PPA manually and trusting that third party source. The proposed method is direct publications from this repository into a default base, such as the Debian Universe package repository. . Any update on this at all? The native connection protocol though the SoftEther client doesn't work with RADIUS auth because it uses PAP, which is inexcusable in this day and age for password authentication.. You would need to setup some kind of routing rule outside of SoftEther to send the traffic from the SoftEther server through a proxy, if its possible. To my knowledge, SoftEther has no inbuilt ability to send traffic through a proxy.. The only thing from Microsoft that they are using is a \"clone\" of MS's SSTP VPN server and then authentication inside of a Windows NT Domain. You dont have to use either of these options, so you could set this up on a Linux box, disable the \"MS-SSTP\" server and use any authentication method but \"Windows NT Domain Controller or Windows Server Active Directory Controller\" and you would not be using a single thing related to MS. . This really does need to be fixed, as a single password is a really flimsy way to secure an entire VPN controller.. By this, you mean the certificate specified under Encryption and Network Settings, correct? This could probably be fixed with a simple notification with instructions on how to change it, if actual generation would be unlikely.. Also if possible, it is also probably time to move to CHAP for RADIUS auth as PAP is not the best idea in terms of sending auth.. @chipitsine  Thanks for responding! To answer your questions, removing the SSL3 support, most likely. However, it would still be better then nothing to include support for TLS1.1 and 1.2 options for those who have updated clients and wish to use it. In terms of PAP auth that exists for RADIUS right now, no. As far as I can see the RADIUS auth is a server side setting only.. I did not, sorry. I sadly do not know enough C to work with this project personally. I primarily just opened this issue as a possibility for implementing it in the future.. @chipitsine So I removed all the headers that had SSL in them (I really am bad with C) and while the server built on it, a server manager that was properly built failed to connect to it due to a protocol error occurring. I had to build it on Linux as I couldn't even find a Visual Studio 2008 installer. So the answer to the question is that SSL3 support cannot be purged from the client and server, it breaks everything. TLS 1.2 support options would have to be added in extra with it to maintain compatibility.. Well, I said that more in the crude way I removed SSL3 from it. @chipitsine If I were to look into this again, would it be best to deprecate SSLv3 completely or to just add an option to use higher versions of TLS? I'm thinking option one would be against the developer guidelines though.. Oh, seems I missed that PR being merged in. So now it uses TLS1.0 and 1.1?. Oh, awesome. I would assume it defaults to the highest supported on both ends. As 1.2 counts as \"modern\", this issue is probably closable i'd imagine.. Thanks! I'm glad i'll be able to recommend this project to others with no apparent downsides anymore :). Oh, thank you. The only download I had found was a .pptx file on their site. Are there any plans to move to a newer Visual Studio project file? Newer versions still support .NET 3.5. @chipitsine Assuming that you mean details on what C++ versions it must support and that a CMake config for windows is coming, sure.. With the merging of #588, this can be closed now right?. To what I can find, C++ 2008 binaries will target the Windows NT API, with spotty chances of being backwards compatible to Windows 9x. Out of curiosity, how does this project maintain compatibility all the way back to 98? I can't find much on the binary linking that was mentioned.. Reasons and download links added :) (The link posted in the issue was to the service pack only, I also added the one to the actual VS 2008 installer and then for the Windows Driver Kit needed.. I have no clue how to adjust the line endings, my apologies for the trouble.. Out of curiosity, if it disables TLS entirely, what does it use instead of it?. I don't think this could work at the moment, as Wireguard has not a trace of Windows support as of writing this. You couldn't run a server or client on Windows. . According to the official site, there are none, and advise against using third party ones.\n\n. It was a fresh git clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git from about 30 minutes before I sent this issue.. When I get off work, I can run it again and give you guys anything else you need from the output if needed.. This is the output from the other console that the buildAll.cmd spawns in case it helps.\n```powershell\nBuildUtil command - VPN Build Utility\nCopyright (c) SoftEther VPN Project.

Ah I see, thanks!. @davidebeatrici Has there been any progress on this issue by chance? I cloned a fresh copy and still encountered the same build error.. It seems to be failing here at the child processes when they attempt to build:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/8f53bf23e71182be4a9b30da8a8eb79ee022cb95/src/BuildUtil/BuildUtilCommands.cs#L877-L893\npowershell\nWaiting child processes...\n1 / 2 (softether_open-vpnserver_vpnbridge-windows-x86_x64-intel):\n       * Error *\n2 / 2 (softether_open-vpnclient-windows-x86_x64-intel):\n       * Error *\n.

If you wouldn't mind explaining it some, I want to add more info to the BUILD_WINDOWS.md on how to develop using the new CMake process.. Alright @davidebeatrici . So I opened Visual Studio 2017, clicked Open -> Cmake and pointed it at the repository's CMakeList file. This works just fine. I then go to the toolbar and select vpnclient.exe and try to run it in debug mode. My build console spits out the same thing 100 times before stopping and giving an error of manifest 'build.ninja' still dirty after 100 tries.\nThe repeated entry in the Output terminal is this:\n```powershell\n\n------ Build started: Project: CMakeLists, Configuration: Debug ------\n\n[0/1] \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\CMake\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe\" -HC:\\Users\\Fox\\Documents\\SoftEtherVPN -B\"C:\\Users\\Fox\\CMakeBuilds\\2d0f08d5-ea76-6d3e-87bf-237c6568fd6e\\build\\x64-Debug (default)\"\n  -- Build date: 29/10/2018\n  -- Build time: 17:11:57\n  CMake Warning (dev) at src/Mayaqua/3rdparty/zlib/CMakeLists.txt:4 (project):\n    Policy CMP0048 is not set: project() command manages VERSION variables.\n    Run \"cmake --help-policy CMP0048\" for policy details.

After removing the `build` and `tmp` directories it still has the same behavior, including when VS is restarted.. @chipitsine Very much so. Just need to resolve these build errors and take notes for later.. @davidebeatrici Once I actually grabbed the MFC C++ class support, this has fixed the issue. Visual Studio now seems to build everything fine, and the debug .exe's generated work as expected.. Not sure if this is supposed to happen right now, but the `vpnclient.exe` will install the service, but cannot start it, even when trying a seperate `/start` command.. If thats the case, how do you test to see if new GUI elements and stuff like that worked as intended?. Oh, awesome. This CMake was is 100x more straightforward then getting VS 2008 and the Windows Driver Kit, though I think that second one is still needed?. Well, Visual Studio 2017 has that ATL/MFC support, you just need to specify that you want it. When I get a bit of time after work i'll add some stuff to info regarding CMake on Windows. I'm also going to make a GitHub Wiki entry that has a more step by step guide for setting up all the needed toolings for Windows Development.. @davidebeatrici So after trying to run the full installer builder, the error persists from previously. I got the numbers you requested though. This is on the latest checkout from `master`\nversionMajor: 5\nversionMinor: 1\nversionBuild: 9662\n``. Better step then im at, mine still crashes when trying to build the installer.. @davidebeatrici Sorry to drag a dead issue up again, didn't want to open a new one for it. It's the same issue I have been having for months now where the full build of SoftEtherVPN crashes for me during the finalBuildUtil.exe` steps. Would you mind taking another look if possible?\n```powershell\nExecuting 'X:\\SoftEtherVPN\\SoftEtherVPN\\src\\bin\\BuildUtil.exe /CMD:ReleaseWin32 all /IGNOREERROR:no /SERIAL:no'...\nBuildUtil command - VPN Build Utility\nCopyright (c) SoftEther VPN Project.

No problem. Wiki entry soon(TM). Would it be possible to bump the digest to SHA256, as SHA1 has been shown to produce collisions? Source\nAnother thing as well, could the 128 bit be bumped to 256? All modern OpenVPN clients (Android, iOS, Windows and Linux) support it.\n. Might as well tweak BUILD_WINDOWS.md and remove the steps describing adding MFC/AFC support in VS2017 as well?. The : character may work? . So it would be a config switch in the server between @ and :, with @ being the default? . It looks like you should be able to look at the session management tab inside the virtual hub settings.\n\n. I'm thinking then vpncmd would work better for you then. See SoftEther Docs. I may of misunderstood the original intent then, my bad. You want to compare registered users that are in that hub with those who currently have a active session on the server?. @Ilo89 I went ahead and created a small Python application that checks what users are \"online\". It does this by seeing how many sessions the user has, if any. Probably not perfect but it may help you out. https://github.com/BlackHoleFox/SoftEtherVPN-User-Checker\n. Oh, my bad there.. @davidebeatrici I did see that, when I installed it though there was a serial key already added into the install steps with no option to remove it or overwrite it, so I assumed that they stopped activation for it.. I definitely could add something about just adding it as another workload the process is dead identical as VS2017 installs and modifies through the Visual Studio Installer application.\nI would have to research the CLI instructions, as I have never touched them before. Do standard Windows developers use them that frequently?. I don't think so. Nuget is for C#/.NET projects. Everything I read says you need to download and have the openssl libs somewhere that your build can find them.. At the moment, the AppVeyor has a Visual Studio 2017 build process, so I assume its already setup in some way?. @davidebeatrici Is there a way to tell CMake this by default? It didn't pick them up automatically.. Odd. Removed the ones I had separately and it still worked. I'll just put it up to my system being weird. Incoming commit removing that.. Should be fine now. CI passed for the changes removing the OpenSSL info. @davidebeatrici So far I have made 3 messes out of my repo. Can you link me to a good way to squash commits?. I think that worked?. ",

    "pdarcos": "I too think this is a great patch and much needed.\n+1. Hi guys,\nThis is one aspect of SoftEther that worries me.\nWhat good is having a VPN if it's blocked in many countries (which will only likely grow) and therefore useless?\nI think that SoftEther should focus some of the effort on lessons learned with OpenVPN and Tor regarding bypassing DPI and other restrictive tech. How hard would it be to incorporate obfsproxy and other similar modules into SoftEther?\nThanks for this great software. Hey @moniekabir \nHow can we get in touch? It would be great to exchange some ideas with you. Hi @moniekabir \nPlease check the issue I created on your wine repo.\nCheers. I agree with the OP. We need to add those pluggable transports or else SoftEther won't work at all in many countries in the world that are increasingly using DPI and other techniques to block VPNs.\nWhat does the team think about this? Is it a priority or not really relevant for your goals?\nThanks. @paulmenzel\nI'm not expecting anything, simply a reply to my question: is this on the roadmap or not?\nI'm bringing together some of the smartest minds in this area for a future project and am willing to invest resources to get things done. So, I ask again, is this on the roadmap at all? If not, who from the community would be able to implement these pluggable transports (a paid job)?\nThanks. I also agree this a very important feature to have in any security software.. +1 Another must have if we want to take security seriously. +1  switching to Apache.\nGPL limits options way too much in my opinion, and what we want is SE to be everywhere.

Yes, this was enabled and still not getting the user class identifier set. A restart of the service was also performed. \nThe AssignVLanIdByRaduisAttribute is also enabled. Could it be that the DHCP traffic is handled differently if VLANS are used?. Thanks yehorov for looking into this. I had finaly more time to troubleshoot this. Here are my results:\nWith IPsec I can see the user class defined in the DHCP Discover packet. Using the Softether VPN client Ver 4.25 the user class is not added. \nIs this feature only for IPsec connections?. This is the Virtual Hub configuration. As far I remember most of the settings are default except for UseHubNameAsDhcpUserClassOption and radius authentication.\nVPN HUB.txt\n.

After this there are calls to CiSaveConfigurationFile and CiNotify and CiSendGlobalPulse - none of which seem to do anything much at OS level. So maybe it is merely setting the MAC on the internal list, saving it to a config and then not actually attempting to update the virtual adaptor?\nWhen the client restarts of course it will initialize the adaptor correctly with what it finds in the config.\nLooking further at the initialization of the TAP device for the Virtual NIC we see this line which seems to set the MAC Address at init:\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/d7d0e6d36fe1d73eca6205d9b2144ded67f52b13/src/Cedar/VLanUnix.c#L527\nThis is in a function called UnixCreateTapDeviceEx - so I guess what we need is a UnixModifyTapDevice call, which actually calls ioctl with the new MAC?

And, in Cedar/Connection.c and Cedar/Server.c, remove any code involving AcceptOnlyTls, it is no longer needed.\nIn the StartSSLEx method in src/Mayaqua/Network.c, remove the code for the AcceptOnlyTls setting completely and add the following. Note: 0 in the max proto setting means up to the highest version supported:\n```\nSSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(ssl_ctx, TLS1_2_VERSION);\nSSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version(ssl_ctx, 0);\nif (sock->ServerMode)\n{\n    Unlock(openssl_lock);\n    AddChainSslCertOnDirectory(ssl_ctx);\n    Lock(openssl_lock);\n}\n```\nIf you would like, you could add a define somewhere in the header for providing the default minimum and maximum TLS versions and/or retrieve it via a user provided setting.

And it\u2019s not clear why you do not go with GCC 7 with better and more elaborate warning and the old version 4.8.4.. And your opinion/reasoning is totally fine, so please add it to the commit message, where that belongs and not in some merge/pull request discussion.. As the audit is over, this issue can be closed.. @dnobori, @moatazelmasry2, thank you for your replies.

However, fix the code to avoid future misunderstanding.. @dnobori, if you have any question regarding using git, please do not hesitate to ask.. @paskal, as the merge/pull request is already accepted, please create a new issue for this.. Could you please document the reason, why you closed the issue?. Looks good. Did you find this by looking at the build warnings or do you experience an actual problem?. @nuxrg, @pdarcos, I am no deveioper, but I am unsure what you expect? It\u2019s free software, and all the developers seem to busy especially as none seem to do SoftEther VPN work for a living. So, if you want/need this support and the developers haven\u2019t implemented it yet, please either pay somebody to do the work or do it yourself. I know it\u2019s harsh, but that\u2019s how it works.\n\nif you have other ideas, how more people can be acquired to work on SoftEther VPN, everybody will love to hear those.. Could the arguments be summarized somewhere? The argument, that the Linux kernel as a GPLv2 project is used everywhere kind of makes the argument, that the license prevents software and hardware manufactures from using it moot.. @blakestell\u2019s comment in https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/208/ has ideas how to change the code to set the minimal versions..

I think replacing the current\nchar *key = \"EncryptPassword\";\nwith smth like\nconst char key[] = \"EncryptPassword\";\nwould be a better fix. At least it saves the call to strlen.\n. well. it's a plain coding error.\nWhat do you think the semantic of the existing piece of code is?\nsizeof is a compile-time macro that expands to the number of bytes the variable requires. In that case it's a char*, i.e. a pointer with constant size. You're probably interested in knowing how many bytes it consumes at runtime.. Wait. what?\nThis is a plain and obvious coding error.\nThis has nothing to do with what the function tries to achieve, being it for increasing the security of the software or not.\nIt's more about a bug that prevents this function from achieving anything useful at all.\nThe sizeof operator is a compile time thing. It works differently from what the author expected it to be.\nIf this is not being treated then a longer key will destroy the memory layout of the running program, eventually leading to exploitable conditions.\nThe fix is either to use the runtime strlen as proposed in this PR or to an actually array of chars so that the sizeof operator knows how big the underlying structure actually is, as proposed in https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/pull/211#issuecomment-254700676.. > I must say that the name of the EncryptPassword() is wrong. This function does not provide any security mechanism but only hiding clear-text in the configuration file, like the Caesar cipher.\nThe name of the function doesn't matter. What matters is the clear and obvious bug in the code.\nif (sizeof(void *) == 8) don't do any of that. It's making things worse than they are right now.\nHave you understood the problem in the existing piece of code? Out of four instances of a NewCrypt call, one wrongly uses he compile time sizeof rather than the runtime strlen. If you want pass on a magic 4 or 8, then fine, do that. But you must not use sizeof in this context as it's highly deceiving.\nAnd before using any of that: char *key_32bit = \"Encr\"; make it a proper char array, i.e. char key_32bit[] = \"Encr\";. This will preserve the length of the buffer for compile time operators.. What's the rationale for closing this issue? Has the bug been fixed?. ",

In order to tunnel IPv6 your going to need ip6tables NAT. ip6tables NAT is only supported on kernel versions 3.3 or higher.\nhttps://gist.github.com/cmdwhoami/1d0bc57a13e158d9d828d4fce2fbb2ec\nhttps://gist.github.com/cmdwhoami/5abed9b0aaaa1702cf207d8dbb045a79\nhttps://gist.github.com/cmdwhoami/b98772b692eedbf3bc2213af80907397\nYour also going to have to enable ipv4 and ipv6 frowarding in /etc/sysctl.conf\n```\nFor binary values, 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.\nTo save changes run command  sysctl -p\nFor more information, see sysctl.conf(5) and sysctl.d(5).\nControls IP packet forwarding\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nControls IPv6 packet forwarding\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\n```\n. > I'm stuck too. I've been trying to setup ipv6 dhcp (via ipv4 internet) for L2TP/IPsec connections for a week now. I've disabled SecureNAT, and bridged to a TAP device so I can use dnsmasq for DHCP (and it can also do DHCPv6). ipv4 traffic and internet works fine. Unfortunately, no ipv6 address is assigned.\n\nI haven't tried softether, openvpn or sstp connections yet.\n\nAs far as I know L2TP/IPsec clients aren't going to support IPv6.... You don't need secure NAT to tunnel Dual Stack... You can tunnel dual stack by using a bridge to TAP_INTERFACE and using dnsmasq for the dhcp server functions. You also have to use iptables and ip6tables NAT... In order to use ip6tables NAT you need kernel version 3.3 or higher on the server.\n. Depends on what the VPN server software is run on. If it's a Openvz container (VPS) you might be out of gas... If it's on a server behind NAT where the router will handle the DHCP it's as easy as disabling secure NAT and bridging to eth0 or wlan0... if your not behind NAT and need to handle the DHCP with dnsmasq you might need to come over to discord and we can talk about it in real time in chat. discord invite: https://discord.gg/QByKXA9. I'm stuck at the moment myself with tunneling Dual Stack cuz I'm inside a OpenVZ container with a kernel that doesn't support ip6tabes NAT... Since it's OpenVZ and I don't control the host I can't upgrade the kernel... Now if it was a KVM container it'd be a different story... I wonder if I could open a support ticket and asked them to put my IPv6 addresses on tap_interface??? I've read bridge utils won't work inside a OpenVZ container either but I've been contemplating trying it anyway. Yea, stop by the discord server... Its only a week or so old ATM but its growing daily.. Lincoln's bridge example works... Did you disable SecureNAT before you set up the bridge and dnsmasq? That could be the reason for your failure...\nI'm guessing your only working with IPv4?\n/etc/sysctl.conf\n```\nFor binary values, 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.\nTo save changes run command  sysctl -p\nFor more information, see sysctl.conf(5) and sysctl.d(5).\nControls IP packet forwarding\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\n```\n/etc/init.d/vpnserver\n```\n!/bin/sh\nBEGIN INIT INFO\nProvides:          vpnserver\nRequired-Start:    $network $remote_fs\nRequired-Stop:     $network $remote_fs\nDefault-Start:     2 3 4 5\nDefault-Stop:      0 1 6\nShort-Description: SoftEther VPN Server\nEND INIT INFO\nDAEMON=/usr/local/vpnserver/vpnserver\nLOCK=/var/lock/subsys/vpnserver\nTAP_ADDR=192.168.30.1\nTAP_INTERFACE=tap_soft\ntest -x $DAEMON || exit 0\ncase \"$1\" in\nstart)\n$DAEMON start\ntouch $LOCK\nsleep 3\n\nifconfig tap interface\n\n\nAssign $TAP_ADDR to our tap interface\n/sbin/ifconfig $TAP_INTERFACE $TAP_ADDR\n\n\nEnd\n\nsleep 3\nservice dnsmasq start\n;;\nstop)\n$DAEMON stop\nrm $LOCK\n;;\nrestart)\n$DAEMON stop\nsleep 3\n$DAEMON start\nsleep 3\n\nifconfig tap interface\n\n\nAssign $TAP_ADDR to our tap interface\n/sbin/ifconfig $TAP_INTERFACE $TAP_ADDR\n\n\nEnd\n\nsleep 3\nservice dnsmasq restart\n;;\n*)\necho \"Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}\"\nexit 1\nesac\nexit 0\n```\n/etc/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nSoftEther VPN server dnsmasq.conf\n############################################################################ Interface Settings\nIf you want dnsmasq to listen for DHCP and DNS requests only on\nspecified interfaces (and the loopback) give the name of the\ninterface (eg eth0) here.\nRepeat the line for more than one interface.\ninterface=tap_soft\nIf you want dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on,\nuncomment this option.

Those channels are rather conceptual. When I use the openvpn client on my Mac over TCP to connect to SoftEtherVPN, only one single channel will be created and it works without problems.. I found already one problem: MikroTik routers do not send the peer info as part of the key exchange and SoftEtherVPN's OpenVPN compatibility layer failed if this string was missing in the key exchange.\nHere the PR with the fix: #355. The good news is that using this patch I was able to connect from a MikroTik router to SoftEtherVPN in ip mode (Layer 3 or tun) mode, but a connection using ether mode (Layer 2) still fails. The reason for this is that even when using layer 2 (so no IP), the MikroTik router expects IP parameters in the PUSH_REPLY. \nSending fake IP settings even when a layer 2 connection from a MikroTik router is incomming actually works, but I have to figure out how to detect connections from those routers as sending IP parameters to all clients would be really a bad idea.. @moham96 Did you apply the patch?. I agree to change the license.. Mayaqua and Cedar libraries can still be linked statically to OpenSSL itself I guess.. ",

Even with these changes it will probably still try to use DES.. I kinda gave up waiting for updates. There is sufficient information from all those tickets to fork your own high security build.\nThings to update:\ncipher_list entry needs to be updated to discard all insecure ciphers (most of them lol?)\nReplace all those SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version calls with higher TLS versions in their arguments. No more SSLvn, low TLS, etc.\nBasically if you don't do the above, your server will fail those SSL tests like Qualys (or get bad scores anyway).\nThings to watch out for:\nThose proto SSL_CTX calls mentioned in some of the tickets are from OpenSSL 1.1. They won't compile if your linux distro is still using 1.0.1.\nGoing down this path will require full client and server recompiles. All the users will need their software updated.\n. @baimafeima I didn't look. I merely built my own version using the source and following the responses to the tickets.\nFor us, we had to comply with PCI DSS 3.2. That meant that not even TLS 1.0 was allowed. The current release is coded to only attempt using TLS 1.0 when you disable SSLv3. So if you only recompiled the server to support TLS 1.2, the existing client will fail to connect. dnobori will basically need a have a new client version that steps through multiple protocol handshakes to handle backward compatibility while not falling over when connecting to higher security servers. I just didn't have the patience to do that and just tailored it to our requirements.\n. @cr9c1 Your mistake is that you only did a compile for the server version. The clients connect only with TLS 1.0, so you need to compile that same code under Windows to get new versions of the client and GUI.\nIf your current VPN client (NOT the VPN Server GUI) throws an error about protocol when connecting to your version of the Server, you are on the right path server-wise, and just need a re-compiled client.\n. Yes, you will need VS2008 and the required service packs as per the build instructions.\nBoth server and client codebases uses that Mayaqua/Network.c (assuming that is what you have changed).\n. These are the changes I made for TLS.

I am not sure if the TLS code in SoftEther has Ephemeral Key Support.. This is unlikely to be a SoftEther issue, more likely the possibility that the CA cert added in your client config does not line up with the client certificates you've used.\nIn other words, this is an OpenVPN client config issue.\nThere are several solutions that can be found on google for this, and it largely depends on your certificates.

    "henderbj": "@MtCedarNet Hi, thanks for answering.\nYes, I would like to use L3 mode if possible. However problem is that I can't solve IP conflicts because I can't make server to see another MAC and assign a new IP.\nUsing L2 mode, I am able to change MAC address (and then obtain new IP), but then the routing table is no correctly set to have all internet networking through VPN. Probably I could find a way to correctly update the routing table when using L2 mode.\nWell, probably what you say explain why I can't make server see another MAC Address from same Windows machine, when using L3 mode.\n. If somebody interested, I was able to make it work by using tap device (layer 2) and routing traffic through VPN adding these lines to configuration file:\ndev tap\nroute-delay 10\nroute-gateway dhcp\nredirect-gateway def1\nThe route-delay is no essentially necessary.

    "ava1ar": "dnobori,\nI undestand your care about the stability and this is very important, but there is one thing, which is more important than stability - this is security.

The same propably is with SE. As dnobori wrote he needs to review and test all patches and issues that is time consuming. SO the question is what we can do together to push this project further.\n@ava1ar thanks for sharing knowledge about LINUX problems. We are testing several platforms, virtualization, server setups etc. and from about 2-3 months we got problems to setup any OPENVPN connection (which was working earlier this year) to SE VPN from several distros (mainly CentOS, Debian and it's clones). We lost several hours and I think it is shame that Linux doesn't have stable SE support. (I will test Strongswan)\nI don't think that server administration for Linux is essential because CLI is very good in SE and for me the most important is to have more CLI features and some sort of API support than another admin panel.\n.

    "xortim": "I believe your answer is \"yes\":\n- The \"Issues\" section is going to be closed at the end of the year, no replacement has been announced\n- The forums are filled with spam posts\n- Lots of PRs that haven't been acted upon.\n- Time, this is a very complicated project. I'm sure the author(s) are simply busy with other projects that help them pay the bills.\n. Thanks for the updates on our concerns @dnobori. Just my two cents on this. The forums are pretty clunky and difficult to use, search, and follow. GitHub is much more welcoming and easier to use. To add to the usability, most users of free software that are willing to file bug reports already have a GitHub account or trust it to some extent. Maybe instead of general purpose forums that your team has to maintain, creating a subreddit might be more helpful. The purpose is not to move things around for convenience, but to hep make it easier and accessible for SE users to participate in a way that is productive and reduces the noise for everyone.\nFor the TLS related issues, I think the primary concern is more administrative control. For example, telling the server to only use TLS, and then to see SSLv3 pop up in the cipher list is concerning. I, personally, would like to see more control over the cipher list, and simply receive a warning in the GUI or CLI about backward compatibility issues. A lot of us have to comply with certain regulatory issues or auditing bodies, and this would definitely help us deploy and champion the project.\nThanks again for your work in making sure that the project remains current and stable.\n. dnobori,\nWhile I can't necessarily help with the deep, code related issues with the project. I can, however, volunteer some time to help moderate a subreddit or forum, and assist with high-level usage related issues as time permits. I'm sure there are some other users that may be willing to pitch in, and help reduce the noise for you.\n. I think your fast track repository is a good solution to the problem. The biggest challenge is finding the right person or persons to take that on.\nOne suggestion is to start with option one (where you provide a development/unstable branch) and work with the top contributors on vetting an official forked project owner.\n. My guess is that the goal is not be to discourage issue reporting. Rather, an attempt to force people to write code to fix the bugs as a part of the public reporting process.\n. @dnobori - thanks for your reply. I apologize if I gave the wrong impression. Force is a little hyperbolic, but rather encourage people to author code alongside their bug reports :)\n. ",

I stumbled across this project a couple of days ago and tested it out on my home lab.  It is a very cool project, and it seems to work very well, and is very fast.  I am glad to read it is not dead, and is still being worked on.  \nI compiled under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS w/ OpenSSL 1.0.x with the pull from #208.  I am somewhat green to programming but know enough to be dangerous. I was hoping I could force TLS 1.2 connections only, but was unable to achieve that goal. Once I enforced TLS and disabled SSL V2, V3, and TLS 1, and 1.1, I could no longer connect with the client or GUI server manager under windows. \nI look forward to seeing this project move forward however, more specifically, support for a TLS 1.2 only option for both server/client. Keep up the great work.\n. @SplatterPaw  Thanks -- I figured that may be the case. I had actually set out to take the same code to my visual studio machine, but I'm running 2015 Community and it didn't play well with it at all.

I got it all compiled under VS2008/SP1 but still no go, will not connect to server with SSLV2/3, and TSLv1/v1.1 disabled on the server end, error code 2, protocol error.I appreciate the assistance you offered, though. It was worth a shot.\n. Worked perfect, verified with a packet capture as well. Thanks so much!\n. @maurerr The only changes I made were the changes proposed by @SplatterPaw \nAside from that, I also found a patch to add the ECDHE ciphers, and the build I'm working on right now currently has TLS v1.2 only, and ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 as the only cipher.  I'm still figuring github out but if you want what I've got in the meantime, I can try to get it to you. I've got another patch I found to fix a memory leak with SSL I have yet to apply, but if you want I can email you what I've got so far, just let me know what you want (until I figure out how use this to upload code changes/differences/etc.\n. I can do that. let me apply the SSL memleak patch real quick and build it and I'll see if I can get the zip archive uploaded of the linux source and the windows binaries. \n. @maurerr Try https://github.com/cr9c1/softether-4.21.9613-tls1.2-ecdhe\nThe windows binaries are under releases/pre-release, source code is there as well.

I came across SoftEther while looking for an easier ad-hoc solution than OpenVPN, and it looks really great, but I'm not thrilled about the idea of implementing my security layer in something that takes a long time to get issues fixed. I could see this becoming very widely used if the workflow can be got right.. Legacy seems like it will be retired at some point leaving only the other repository - I definitely prefer Stable or Long Term Support, or even Enterprise, though that tends to imply extra features.

Then a fixed in the development repo, then a patch applied on the stable repo (or cherry-pick). The development repo can have a branch that tracks the stable repo to ease preparation of the patch.\nThen the maintainer of the dev repo, having prepared a patch applicable on the stable repo, sends it to @dnobori who can then apply it on the stable repo and release a new version as seen fit.. @moatazelmasry2 The dev repo would have a branch that is tracking the stable repo's main release branch, so people would just open issues there and say what version they were using like any other bug.. SoftEther is easily thwarted nowadays by DPI and throttling and fingerprint of unique SSL handshake. And especially UDP acceleration packet drop is used to disrupt SoftEther by letting first few packets and then dropping random packets (30-50% packet loss). It needs integration with KCP on UDP acceleration side, also it needs ability to set and change UDP acceleration port ranges (port range targeted and dropped by ISPs).\nAlso needed is built-in traffic obfuscation (for both tcp and also udp packets) to scramble packets using different methods (maybe integrate pluggable transports) or emulating HTTP packet to beat traffic shaping against long https sessions.\nIt is sorely in need of modernization.\nAlso it needs to be able to hide behind common nginx web proxy to camouflage with a normal website and use normal website https certificate..

    "kuituhirvi": "I have to say that this conversation has been great and also think that seeking advice from the Debian community way of doing things is a good idea. Let us just not get stuck on the precise wording as picking none or any for the two branches/repositories leaves the need for explaining the situation. \nIn Debian terms a release is always stable, so everything with a version number has to be stable. The newest (highest number) version is also supported, removing the need for a specific supported release. Testing for the next version is on-going and has no numbering although if one feels the need for such it could be conceived using simple arithmetics, with a formula like, latest release + 1. \nOverall though these are very different kinds of projects and I feel that a singular (single use case) piece of software does not need to be as strict as Linux distribution and these kinds of labeling efforts can be approached a little more lightheartedly. Except for the piece considered stable for which I kind of like the term \"Robust\"  as the term implies it is not easily penetrated.. ",

This is also mentioned manual under 3.6.11 and I quote: \n\nimitations within the Linux or UNIX operating system prevent communication with IP addresses assigned to the network adapter locally bridged from the VPN side (Virtual Hub side). The cause of this restriction lies with OS's internal kernel codes rather than with the SoftEther VPN. When wishing to communicate in any form with a UNIX computer used for local bridging from the VPN side (Virtual Hub side), (for instance, when running both the VPN Server / VPN Bridge service & the HTTP Server service and wishing to grant access to the server service from the VPN side as well), prepare and connect a local bridge network adapter and physically connect both it and the existing network adapter to the same segment (as explained in 3.6 Local Bridges, it is recommended to prepare a network adapter for exclusive use in local bridging for this and other situations).\n\nIn short, the Linux kernel prevents access to the interface you bridged for your VPN for security reasons as far I have read (had this issue aswell when I was new to SoftEther). The real solution is getting a second network card in the server you use for the VPN. Then you have one interface dedicated to routing internet traffic and the other interface as management where you can SSH into it.\nI hope this helps you any further. Note: I'm not a maintainer and/or member of this project, but just a user that runs its own SoftEther VPN server.\n. Windows does indeed not have problem with this. I have run SoftEther VPN Server on a Windows operating system before I transfered over to Linux, due to getting a second NIC for it.. @dnobori Could you please look at this project a bit more? In the past seven months there have been made dozen of pull requests to further improve this project.. @dnobori To help you, #309 is extension of #294, as the first one I mentioned has the same commits in them as in the latter pull request, hence the probable merge conflict you are talking about.. Any update regarding this? I still don't have an option to update this, other then to try manually. But even this does not work, as the client simply refuses to use the new CHACHA 20-POLY 1305 encryption options.\n. Yes, but it doesn't work if you manually edit the config file. The Softether client simply refuses to use the cipher and uses another one. . Maybe you could try Virtual NAT? It has an option to not give a default gateway to clients connecting to it, but I don't know if other traffic will be let through to the local network. Hmm, wasn't notified on this issue (though I'm still a contributor, even if it was for a small but simple change).\nAnyway, no probleem for me..

Hi! Great questions! I am no spokesperson for the  project, but I do think I can provide possible explanations for these behaviors:\n\n\nThe first case I believe is an internet-connectivity check. I do agree the rate and an option to toggle it completely would be useful.\n\nMaybe even the target should be configurable, www.yahoo.com may not be responsive forever. Also in a large private network environment one may want VPN to segregate further but the entire network is incapable of reaching yahoo it makes no sense to attempt to but perhaps it does make sense to hit some other internal endpoint instead. Configurability would be great there.\n\n\n\nTo the second case\n\n\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/0b8fcb75bc577847af2405d7dfc87cdc3945ad89/src/Mayaqua/Internat.c#L2046-L2048\nUniSearchStrEx indicates this behavior is only for when SoftEther runs with the account name specifically set to \"public.softether.com\" https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/9f9dc459a72a963c5c435186958117778b7b4cf5/src/Cedar/CM.h#L136-L139\n\nTo the latter, tracing the \"VpnServerHtml\" leads to this warning page for English people http://www.softether.com/jp/special/se2hub_en.aspx and a matching one presumably for Chinese/Japanese/?.\n\nThe warning page could be quite concerting! But I think both cases are benign. I would presume the latter one is due to as it claims, actual legal involvement requiring some form of warning and liability release. I would propose adding code to enable compiling it out, but I could see in that case that releasing SoftEther with the ability to compile WITHOUT that code in would be flagrant violation of whatever happened, at least as long as the public SoftEther purported to run the same code base. So in the worst case if you really distrust it you can always fork and disable I guess.\n\nI hope my answers make sense and someone with more authority can come in and give better answers. :). ",

This damaged file can also be successfully used by OpenVPN client, as you have noted. This is a (mis)feature of the OpenSSL implementation.\nSoftEther VPN Server, in its role as SSL/TLS server, does not, of course, get to see the client's private key, so cannot verify its integrity (as openssl rsa -check does). Server only sees that the client, when prompted during the handshake, has produced the correct signature which matches the certificate; so the client must possess the correct private key and therefore should be successfully authenticated.\nNow let's try and change some other character in the private key:\n```\n$ diff -u steve.key y_steve.key\n--- steve.key   2017-05-26 20:40:29.000000000 +0300\n+++ y_steve.key 2018-04-05 09:59:23.214988138 +0300\n@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\n -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n MIICdwIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCAmEwggJdAgEAAoGBAOtTdKQ2VgMVIQtk\n-qEhwYgBuorup9jdSiUEuP8N+3U+c16JZ6JpfG+nZfa2TFfzylw1N3yfGqMIa0XGa\n+qEhwYgBuoUup9jdSiUEuP8N+3U+c16JZ6JpfG+nZfa2TFfzylw1N3yfGqMIa0XGa\n j5ljVab0SbfM1L9RAeo1wf7nfAvJmNSirxGsVlgaQlVyvzRkBHJ5szrqJmv6xcNi\n C0fcYmSjhQ3eqp+a0hprTY44Q1FJAgMBAAECgYAgkWY9K7/voUb3erDHhbYqdSVU\n b4tB0MxqFuqANdiPIhe9wk+svajxTkZUdVy/qxs4niRaLuZAJtIBtPBWvCaoNoqw\n$ openssl rsa -noout -check -in y_steve.key\nRSA key error: n does not equal p q\n$ openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in x_steve.key | md5sum\n9991b79bdbf3ca869c82b9a1b5ad7141  -\n$ openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in y_steve.key | md5sum\na896af578f40204c9015617f129b1603  -\n$ openssl dgst -sha256 -sign y_steve.key -out /tmp/signature.y_steve.sha256 /tmp/signed_data\n$ md5sum /tmp/*.sha256\ncac540cb0955e8ab4ab6a39c282afdbe  /tmp/signature.steve.sha256\ncac540cb0955e8ab4ab6a39c282afdbe  /tmp/signature.x_steve.sha256\nff6b1284d6585aa1a88f6af25fb9a1e0  /tmp/signature.y_steve.sha256\n$ openssl dgst -sha256 -verify <(openssl x509 -in steve.crt -pubkey -noout) -signature /tmp/signature.y_steve.sha256 /tmp/signed_data\nVerification Failure\n```\nAha!

During SSL/TLS handshake the client would fail to produce a signature that can be verified with the client's certificate / public key (as we have demonstrated above), and the handshake would fail.. I have made a quick fix in #476. It compiles with OpenSSL 1.0.1 (the older one), and should compile with 1.1.0, but I have no access to 1.1.0 at the moment and cannot verify it myself right now. Could you guys please test it with 1.1.0?. I agree to changing the license.. Fixed the line break, but static_cast would not work here, because Network.c is not complied as a C++ source file:\n...\ncc -DNDEBUG -DVPN_SPEED -DUNIX -DUNIX_LINUX -DCPU_64 -D_REENTRANT -DREENTRANT -D_THREAD_SAFE -D_THREADSAFE -DTHREAD_SAFE -DTHREADSAFE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -I./src/ -I./src/Cedar/ -I./src/Mayaqua/\n -O2 -fsigned-char -m64 -c src/Mayaqua/Network.c -o tmp/objs/Mayaqua/Network.o\nsrc/Mayaqua/Network.c: In function 'SslCertVerifyCallback':\nsrc/Mayaqua/Network.c:5825:29: error: 'static_cast' undeclared (first use in this function)\n   clientcert->PreverifyOk = static_cast<bool>(preverify_ok);. Removed this line altogether, since, as you correctly noted, the value assigned to PreverifyOk is never used.. Should also remove the corresponding #define from Mayaqua/Mayaqua.h:218. Copy seems unnecessary: EVP_EncryptInit_ex signature has a const modifier for iv parameter. Same applies to plaintext and EVP_EncryptUpdate call below. Also, same applies to AesDecrypt function.. Should call EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free(ctx) before returning from the function (here and in several places below). Same applies to AesDecrypt function.. Is the copy operation necessary here? Why not pass dest directly to EVP_EncryptUpdate / EVP_EncryptFinal_ex instead of ciphertext?. The comments about freeing ctx before returns and unnecessary Copying also apply to this function.. Docs state \"the decrypted data buffer out passed to EVP_DecryptUpdate() should have sufficient room for (inl + cipher_block_size) bytes\". See also https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2/issues/169.\n(Note that this requirement is probably to handle the padding, and with the way AesDecrypt is used in SoftEther codebase, no padding is needed). EVP_EncryptFinal_ex adds so-called PKCS padding to the ciphertext. This padding is always at least one byte long. But the ciphertext array (declared on line 4636) has the same size as the plaintext, with no space reserved for padding, so buffer overflow occurs here.\nNote that the AES_cbc_encrypt function which was previously used here does not add PKCS padding (see here for reference), so the new code is not equivalent to the earlier version.\nAlso note that the only caller of AesEncrypt (Cedar/IPsec_IkePacket.c) performs its own padding operation: in IkeEncryptWithPadding() the plaintext length is rounded up to a nearest block boundary, and the ciphertext is then expected to be the same size.\nTherefore I suggest removing the EVP_EncryptFinal_ex call (and its counterpart EVP_DecryptFinal_ex call from AesDecrypt) and adding an assertion size % AES_BLOCK_SIZE == 0  to the beginning of AesEncrypt.\nEDIT: a better way would be to disable the padding with a EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding call, instead of removing EVP_EncryptFinal_ex.\nAnother option would be to make AesEncrypt a more general-purpose function which can handle arbitrary plaintext lengths. In this case, you'll need to allocate additional space for ciphertext, and rewrite Cedar/IPsec_IkePacket.c to do the same, and make sure that the correct padding is also present when calling AesDecrypt. Though, since IPsec does not use PKCS padding anyway, I'm not sure there is a practical need for this.. If you remove the EVP_EncryptFinal_ex call as I suggested above, this call also should be removed. Otherwise you have to make sure the correct PKCS padding is present in the ciphertext when AesDecrypt is called --- which means adding it manually, because IPsec does not use PKCS padding.\nEDIT: better yet, do not remove the EVP_EncryptFinal_ex call and disable the padding with EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding.. Since ctx == NULL here, there is no need to call EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free in this specific place. Same on the line 4679.. ",

I think you are confused, as Let's Encrypt HTTP challenge requires you to listen the port 80, not 443.

It will work like a charm.\nFurthermore, if you want to automatically renew your SoftEther VPN SSTP certificate, you can automate it via CRON and vpncmdclient, though you will have to expose your server password in a file, that is dangerous.

In Linux I use SoftEther server soft as server and as client. You create 1. hub 2. bridge tap for hub 3. cascade connection to another server. So it is work around for peer-to-peer. SoftEther client on Linux do nothing to routing table or interface IP. You have to set manually or configure it for static or dhcp network interface.\nauto tap_hub1\niface tap_hub1 inet static\n    address 192.168.30.2\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\nauto tap_hub2\niface tap_hub2 inet dhcp\n. SoftEther works great with creating tap device and debian/ubuntu network interface config works too. Try this:\n```\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nallow-br0 eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\nallow-br0 tap_vpn\niface tap_vpn inet manual\n    up brctl addif br0 $IFACE\n    pre-down brctl delif br0 $IFACE\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n    bridge_ports eth0\n    address 192.168.1.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    gateway 192.168.1.120\n.

I set up /etc/network/interfaces to automatically do something with SoftEther device on creating/destroying.\nI guess creating TAP with tunctl may cause SoftEther error on creating TAP device because it already exist..

    "joshperry": "Hey guys,\nThe importance of this patch is like @davidebeatrici said, but not just for connectivity detection. All network management scripts on Linux rely on the transitioning of the Up/Down state to know when certain configuration tasks should be done.\nFor example the dhcpcd client only attempts to allocate/renew a dynamic IP address when the interface transitions from Down to Up. If the state never transitions, and the server (and/or its dhcp server) are recycled, then the client will not allocate a new address until the current one expires. If you do not persist your dhcp leases then your server-side systems will have no idea what IP address to use to communicate with the client.\nAnother critical aspect is that the Kernel will keep this network segment as part of the system's routing table as long as it is Up. This makes it very difficult to implement features like least-cost or priority routing based on the network metrics if the network is not really Up when it says it is.\nThank you for pushing this forward!\nJosh. @davidebeatrici Did you accidentally overwrite this PR?.

The intention is that most installations will use these default ciphers and automatically benefit from the increased security should new ciphers be created.\nUsing the other cipher list would prefer using extremely insecure ciphers like RC4-MD5. I would remove it, but the management tool uses it and I couldn't quite figure out how to modify it.. The main concern regarding configurable ciphers is what happens if the server is misconfigured to use no cipher at all. I decided to use the fallback as a sane alternative, since otherwise a lot of error handline will have to be implemented so some obscure error message doesn't show up.\nAdmittedly, the invalid specification is a hack, but is probably the best I can do without seriously messing with the management UI. The management program cuts off any long cipher list, which makes it almost impossible to list more than one cipher inside it, hence, a short invalid string has to be used for now.\nTo do it properly, the UI will have to be a list of checkboxes that can be moved around, or perhaps two lists of ciphers, one for active, and one for inactive, and a button to move ciphers in and out of the list. I am afraid I do not have the time for this.. Also note that OpenSSL will use a default list of ciphers anyway, if it fails to set the cipher list.. No objections to changing the license.. ",

Thank you!. @Raafat do not find the option (that is also the reason why I created this issue), any guiding hints?. doesn't seem to be what I need\nDhcpSet command - Change Virtual DHCP Server Function Setting of SecureNAT Function\nStart Point for Distributed Address Band:\n``\nfirst of all SecureNAT is not enabled\nsecond no idea what starting point is he speaking about\n. Finally I found the solution (by pure chance):\non the client manager, selectPropertiesfor the desired VPN connection,Advanced Settingsand finally selectNo Adjustment of Routing Table`\nThis seems to solve my problem: internet is not routed through the VPN anymore, only the remote local network can be accessed.\nI find very strange that the developer of this project, @macvk, didn't know about this option.. @net147 u r right, I got excited too fast, this does not solve this issue. That connects indeed, thank you, but the speed is incredibly slow, somewhere around 1kbps. I imagine it is caused by not using a direct connection, while your client somehow manages to get a direct connection after establishing the connection through Azure server. Is there any solution for that?. not sure what you mean\non the same machine the connection established by the SoftEtherVPN client is much faster than the connection established by native Windows 10 VPN client\nwhat do you want me to check?\n.

    "nxtester": "@cdcseacave I think your needs are not so unusual because I also come to the same point like you. In Germany, we often have this crazy situation, that internet connections in industrial areas are (still) slower than in pure living areas. So it's simply unwanted, to route internet access from a fast internet connection at home (where a home-office is situated)  through a slower internet connection in the company (where the VPN server is situated). Moreover, it's even unwanted for the company, that a home-user opens for instance a RDP connection to their infrastructure by VPN connection and at the same time all internet traffic from the LOCAL internet browser at home will be routed to the companies internet connection. What, if the home-user will do something strange, like to share copyrighted music or videos by sharing-software installed on his LOCAL computer? In this case, the company might be in danger to get in unwanted situations.\n@MtCedarNet Thanks for your advice to set static IP without DNS and gateway for the VPN network interface which is quite simple but working. The disadvantage is, that if you have for instance 10 remote stations, you need to reserve a certain address space and document, which IP is assigned to certain remote stations to avoid IP address conflicts.\n@macvk Now you know, why people could use this function :-)\nTo say it short: Yes, there is a need to get control about the fact, if (or which) gateway and DNS will be transferred to a remote station, or just an IP and Subnet Mask. A switch in the VPN client software \"Use default local gateway\" or \"Do not use remote gateway\" would do the job. Even better would be a switch or an parameter for every user in the GUI of \"VPN Server Manager\".\nHowever, thank you guys from the University of Tsukuba. You really did and do something georgeous to provide high security in legendary Japanese quality to make security affordable for everyone around the world. I highly appreciate it!. Basically to change the metrics of VPN network interface at the client does the job also. But there is a big disadvantage: The first try to connect to a pc by remote-desktop (RDP) will generally fail. You have to connect a second time and it will work (the same if you try to PING where the first PINGs will get lost). I assume this is under Windows by design because of this gateway/metrics relation.\nSo (only) to change manually Gateway and DNS entry in the VPN client adapter seems to work as it should.\n\n. ",
    "2E0PGS": "I just remove the gateway being pushed in the virtual DHCP server.\nThen I add static routes to be pushed for certain IP rages.\nThat way only traffic destin for that IP range will be sent across the VPN adapter.\nThat works fine for me so far using DHCP.\nHowever I think for static IP I would need to have it outside the virtual DHCP server pool and possibly manually setup DNS lookup zones. Wil update if/when I get to that.. That is using the SecureNAT virtual NAT and DHCP server built into SoftEther. I now need to figure out how to configure SoftEther to push custom routes without using the SecureNAT.. Related https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/391 seems it only supports that in DHCP mode.. ",

What will OS say if file is not signed and unpacked from zip archive? I guess nothing... Even with signing available a user will have to check each file instead of archive with CD (all components).

Any signing is just additional step... And it is not considered by 99% of users.\nSo secure channel is still required... to deliver binaries or deliver hash. \nAnd for Linux it is the same. For example it can be own repository for each distro and all packages can be signed, but we still need to publish key for repo and provide that info using some secure trusted channel.\nI do not think it makes sense to discuss more.

What's more ,  a detail document about how to quickly understand , use , test source code, or how to build a SoftEtherVPN  development environment is important for most  SE fans.. > @tidatida , are you still here ?\nI don't think print too much info is a good idea too, so I think it is time to close this issue.  @chipitsine  . @moatazelmasry2  Sorry, I am not familiar with patch polcy before.   I choose option 1, the default.  But I am not clear  where to select \"option 1 \" ? What should I do now ? . I support to change to Apache License.  SE project is very great, but not used everywhere that needing L2 connect, maybe part because to GPL license limit.  So, I am glad to see SoftEtherVPN project change to Apache License.. Dear @dnobori ,  have you decided to  switch to Apache license, or even a BSD license?  if so,when?. @davidebeatrici  @fenice2 @dnobori  Could you give a help on this topic?   Though I have read the code for quite a lot of time ,  I can't find a right  and native way to solve this question.  Many thanks.. This line moved up from orignal version. \n Line 18367 has defined a param t, so this param shouldn't be t too, so I rename it to t2. . Yes, you are right, you can rename this param freely, and make a new PR. \nThe param names in this project are not always self-declared,  for examples, a lot of single char param, such as \"o\"  ,\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"p\",\"s\", \"t\"  there.  What's more , they are a lot of MACRO used to declare/define functions, such as rpc-processing code, it makes more diffcult to do smart-param-rename. But nobody trys to rename all of them, the work is too huge, on the other hand it becomes a new code for authors/ users  who are familiar with the current style.  I don't  know how to deal with this situation.. Great idea. I hope to join the discuss.. ",

I have a problem that needs to trouble you. I don't know if you can achieve it. I have been researching the software of SOFTETHER for a long time. I have new ideas:\n1 Modify the software verification interface: one of the servers to verify the account time, the successful verification of the account can be carried out, other settings of the server (mainly time control is very useful, other servers).\n2 The routing table function is added. The current routing table has only 64 entries, and the entries are too few. At present, the branches of https://github.com/fivesheep/chnroutes can be separated by traffic.

Use the routing table before the computer links to the VPN site: routes-up.bat and then link to the VPN site, then skip the Chinese site. 2: After connecting the VPN, use routes-up.bat, then only all Chinese IPs are delegated, and routes-down.bat deletes all added custom routing tables.. https://www.175.es/windowsroute.rar. https://github.com/fivesheep/chnroutes. On October 23, 2018, I used the softether VPN link to Korea to speed up, open STEAM ----PUBG (PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS), and now the anti-cheating is: BattEEye 4.8.8, directly report the SOFTETHER system process and installation directory error , said softether affects the game, then PUBG detects that BattEEye 4.8.8 is not running at the best stage of the match and cannot join the game. Before BattEEye 4.8.8, it only prompts for softether, but does not say that it affects game matching.. BattEEye 4.8.8 kills all the softther system processes and scans the softether installation directory. If I don't uninstall all the software files, it will cause the computer to not participate in the game match of pubg.\n. I am still unable to participate in the game by closing softether, because vpnclinte.exe is a service process, I can only participate in the game when uninstalling softether (BattEEye 4.8.8 detects the installation directory of softether). I can now install pptp with Korean VPS and use softether l2tp/ipsc to participate in the competition, but the risk is very high, and there is danger of being blocked by China Great Wall Firewall at any time, because I have not paid the protection fee.Moreover, we all use the China-Korea-CN2 line, which is very expensive. Once the IP is blocked, the loss cannot be afforded.. 19:23:13: Starting BattlEye Service...\n19:23:18: Launching game...\n19:23:58: Note: File blocks can be ignored if they don't cause problems with the game.\n19:23:58: [INFO] Blocked loading of file: \"C:\\Program Files\\Play softether Client\\vpnclient_x64.exe\".\n. Found the root cause: BattEEye 4.8.8 checks the software's digital signature, so the self-generated software used does not have a digital certificate, which results in direct detection by BattEEye 4.8.8, and then can not open the game, just do not know how to add a certificate to the source code. CodeSign.cs \uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1fIs this file? Who can give an example? It is best to provide a free signed certificate. In win7 64-bit system, I solved the above problem: Using 32-bit, vpnclient.exe and vpncmgr, of course you have to stop the service first:\nCommand: NET STOP SEVPNCLIENT\nVpnclient.exe and vpncmgr.exe (digital signature: application mode, you can look for a free signature,)\nReplace your installation directory file default 64-bit file: vpncmgr_x64.exe, vpnclient-x64.exe rename other, change the installation directory vpnclient.exe and vpncmgr.exe to vpncmgr_x64.exe, vpnclient-x64.exe,\nCommand: NET START SEVPNCLIENT\nOK, BE 4.8.8 will not detect SEVPNCLIENT\nIf SEVPNCLIENT needs to run 64-bit, it must use the same signature as the officially released by Sofar (drive mode digital signature), which is a big expense for the average developer.. \u4f60\u5f88\u6709\u6548\u7387\uff01\u8d5e\u4e00\u4e2a. After reading your code, I realized that sockes5 is a very complicated implementation method. I think you must spend a lot of time to deal with this function. Thank you for your efforts in the function of sockes5. This function will benefit many people. :\n1, when the customer through the sockes5 link can be separated from the routing table, DNS control\n2. You can truncate some of the URLs in the first phase of SOCKES5.\n3, there are other benefits of SOCKES5: For example, China's lines are divided into individuals, enterprises, dynamic enterprises, static enterprise lines, the above firewalls are different, personal firewalls are the most stringent, static enterprise firewalls are the most lenient, when personal firewalls are discarded When using the server IP, we can use SOCKES5 from the static enterprise line.. Can I generate a client binary for testing?. windows client binary please, http down load url please!. The local test link is successful, and going back to test the game UDP will delay at night.. Sorry, my reply is late, all the tests have passed, I hope to merge as soon as possible, and release the source code! Thanks again for your hard work is our happy game, of course, I have a hope, I hope to support the local routing table in windows, which is perfect for me, because I have done a lot of attempts, I hope to add this feature. But helpless softether is very large code, a sentence is not done, it will lead to failure to generate, if we can support the windows local routing table, it means that we will be as good as the openvpn client (OPENVPN has been hanged in China) And I also really do not like the OPENVPN interface, windows local routing table has a very detailed open source, I hope God can also put this function jich. OPEN VPN has obvious characteristics, it does not work in China or a tightly closed country, and OPEN VPN may have a small client, and it is not as powerful as SOFTETHER. So far, the traffic characteristics of SOFTETHER cannot be recognized by China's firewall Great Wall. I have been using SOFTETHER for all reasons. All foreign VPNs have been blocked in China. Only SOFTETHER client + server can hold on, so I recommend my customer to use SOFTETHER. We are not using LAN function, we are more Focus on the Internet function to prevent the IP from being blocked and prevent it from being detected. This is very important.. I currently use a third-party software to load a digital signature into an EXE file.. This software is licensed open source, so they removed the digital signature part. As for how to increase the digital signature, you have to ask SOFTETHER, the version they released is signed, and the open source is not signed.. connecting. This may be caused by firewall interference and flashing. This situation often occurs in China. If you have this situation, please change the server encryption method and do not use the RC-MD5 encryption method.. Thank you for your reply, I see a few questions when I see you: 1. The source code cannot compile errors, fatal errors. 2. Why does the development version not generate linux-x64-64bit.tar.gz?3, which local custom routing table can be achieved? 4.

I think that did not explain clearly enough what is the working setup.\nwe modify the Softether VPN local bridge to use a TAP device instead of the real NIC (here it is eth0 on my server).\nThen, under Linux, I modified the network settings for the system by using a Linux bridge linking eth0 to the new TAP device in order for both devices to see the external world.\nI provide here the content of /etc/network/interfaces on my server (the settings are the same on the other server at the opposite side of the VPN link) but I did never used the client which's setting can be different:\n\nThe loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nThe primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 0.0.0.0\nThe VPN TAP network interface\nauto tap_vpn\niface tap_vpn inet static\npre-up tunctl -t tap_vpn\naddress 0.0.0.0\nhwaddress ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\nThe bridge network interface\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\nbridge_ports eth0 tap_vpn\naddress 192.168.1.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.120\n\nFor the TAP MAC address, use eth0's MAC address as the bridge will use either eth0's one or the TAP's one depending on which comes up last during the bridge creation. So using eth0's MAC address for the TAP device ensure that the bridge will use a real MAC address for communications with the outside...\nThe TAP device is created by Linux instead of softether VPN in order for it to be included in the Linux bridge at boot time as network interfaces are supposed to be up before any VPN can be created.\nThe trick is to ensure that the TAP device in Linux has the \"tap_\" prefix prepended to the TAP device name used in softether VPN (and also the same MAC address).\nHere is an extract of Softether VPN configuration file for the corresponding local bridge:\ndeclare LocalBridgeList\n{\nbool DoNotDisableOffloading false\ndeclare LocalBridge0\n{\nstring DeviceName vpn\nstring HubName BRIDGE\nbool LimitBroadcast false\nbool MonitorMode false\nbool NoPromiscuousMode false\nstring TapMacAddress XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX\nbool TapMode true\n}\n}\n\nI hope I have been a little clearer with the settings of the servers... but I did never used the client which's setting can be different . that means a TAP device alone is not enough and you need to change the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nto say dear system please use this TAP device. From my point of view:\nanyone that does not strictly mention in a written request that \"Please never use my code except for GPLv2\" has leaved full ownership of his work to @dnobori as he is the owner of the original source-code's.\nWill try to explain situation with below example:\n- I publish this comment under GPLv2 license (anyone is allowed to change it and republish under GPLv2 until they do not take that right away from others to do so) was very simple now this comment is under GPLv2.\n - now someone does come and finds a Grammar or any other issue and leaves Me know about it.\nof-course I will fix that like he says or even better...\n - anyway would he mention  \"but you are never allowed to use my work except for GPLv2\"\nthat would be offending and I would answer with \"thanks but no thanks, I have an even better way to fix that\".\nWhat I am attempting to say is that there is no use or need on waiting for permission from someone that did not disallow you in any form.\nsure the project is under GPLv2 but no help from outside is under GPLv2 except when it is strictly mentioned from the helper in a written document or something.\nIn short this issue was opened at begin 2018, which is soon over and yet no answer from all contributors???\nStill it is a good thing to ask contributors in email or something for their permission, that is quit polite but in the email they receive should also be mentioned that you have a limited time to answer this request else you are considered to agree with the license change.. @davidebeatrici: what about @el1n, @rel22 and is there anyone else left?. May I ask when the final license change is, since it looks like everyone did accept the license change?\nby the way, it's EXTREMELY exciting to read this thread\nI hope it will switch to Apache 2.0 (or something like that) soon :+1: thanks in advance... . ### Fix for DNS-leak on Windows\nHello, I would like to make a pull request, but unfortunately, my fix is written in C++ and rewriting it in pure-C code is an excersice left for anyone interested...\nIt is under Apache 2.0 license:\n  - using Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to block any other network-adapter\n  - and is forcing Static-DNS while connected (to support Windows-XP which is lacking WFP)\nSource-Code (dns-blocker.cpp)\n```C++\n// License: Apache 2.0\ninclude \"dns-blocker_p.h\"\nHINSTANCE DnsBlockerPrivate::ipLibrary = NULL;\nConvertInterfaceIndexToLuidPtr\n    DnsBlockerPrivate::convertInterfaceIndexToLuid = NULL;\nGetAdaptersInfoPtr DnsBlockerPrivate::getAdaptersInfo = NULL;\nDnsBlocker::DnsBlocker()\n    : d(new DnsBlockerPrivate())\n{\n}\nDnsBlocker::~DnsBlocker()\n{\n    this->stop();\n    delete d;\n}\nvoid DnsBlocker::prepare()\n{\n    if (d->api == NULL)\n        d->api = ::IPsecWin7InitApi();

We plan to use SoftEther just as background-client-service in our Client for connecting to our SoftEther protocol based server, but even if any RPC interface needs to be (and is) usable from two directions (Service-Provider and Client) the SoftEther RPC functions are under GPLv2 too so:\n\n\nwe need LGPL, so we can dynamically-link our Client to a .dll file or something (which's source-code we would publish) that does provide SoftEther RPC interface functions\n\nshould the license really change to Apache 2.0 we could go even further and include that RPC functions with static-linking\nbut until waiting for any license change, we are adding our own RPC interface to the background-client-service (which's source-code we need to publish), that should be a simple work-around for now since our own RPC interface can be used under whatever license we need.\n\n. below is the route print command result (where 192.168.30.10 and metrics 2 and 257 belong to VPN Client Adapter):\n```cmd\n===========================================================================\nInterface List\n 35...00 ac 57 34 84 38 ......VPN Client Adapter - VPN\n 42...84 3a 4b 40 e8 6d ......Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter #25\n 16...00 21 cc d8 fe 4a ......Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection\n 14...f4 b7 e2 f6 db ac ......Bluetooth Device (Personal Area Network)\n 11...84 3a 4b 40 e8 6c ......Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6205\n  1...........................Software Loopback Interface 1\n 68...00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 Microsoft ISATAP Adapter\n 73...00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #2\n 43...00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #3\n 37...00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #4\n 45...00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #6\n 64...00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #7\n===========================================================================\nIPv4 Route Table\nActive Routes:\nNetwork Destination        Netmask          Gateway       Interface  Metric\n          0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0   192.168.10.254    192.168.10.21     25\n          0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0     192.168.30.1    192.168.30.10      2\n        127.0.0.0        255.0.0.0         On-link         127.0.0.1    306\n        127.0.0.1  255.255.255.255         On-link         127.0.0.1    306\n  127.255.255.255  255.255.255.255         On-link         127.0.0.1    306\n     192.168.10.0    255.255.255.0         On-link     192.168.10.21    281\n    192.168.10.21  255.255.255.255         On-link     192.168.10.21    281\n   192.168.10.255  255.255.255.255         On-link     192.168.10.21    281\n     192.168.30.0    255.255.255.0         On-link     192.168.30.10    257\n    192.168.30.10  255.255.255.255         On-link     192.168.30.10    257\n   192.168.30.255  255.255.255.255         On-link     192.168.30.10    257\n        224.0.0.0        240.0.0.0         On-link         127.0.0.1    306\n        224.0.0.0        240.0.0.0         On-link     192.168.10.21    281\n        224.0.0.0        240.0.0.0         On-link     192.168.30.10    257\n  255.255.255.255  255.255.255.255         On-link         127.0.0.1    306\n  255.255.255.255  255.255.255.255         On-link     192.168.10.21    281\n  255.255.255.255  255.255.255.255         On-link     192.168.30.10    257\n===========================================================================\nPersistent Routes:\n  None\nIPv6 Route Table\nActive Routes:\n If Metric Network Destination      Gateway\n  1    306 ::1/128                  On-link\n 11    281 fe80::/64                On-link\n 35    276 fe80::/64                On-link\n 11    281 fe80::8438:32e4:4257:a00a/128\n                                    On-link\n 35    276 fe80::c52b:1bc6:9a60:156b/128\n                                    On-link\n  1    306 ff00::/8                 On-link\n 11    281 ff00::/8                 On-link\n 35    276 ff00::/8                 On-link\n===========================================================================\nPersistent Routes:\n  None\n``\nnote that we tried:\n1. reinstallingSoftEther2. applying lowmetricand settingpersistenttotrueforVPN Adapter3. applying metric500on all other Adapters including the Real-Adapter (which provides internet)\n4. did review some other options usingNetRouteView` tool.

After setting No Adjustments of Routing Table to off was never again able to reproduce this issue (no wonder, since now SoftEther-Client ensures there is no other 0.0.0.0 in route table while Client is connected; and on any error and/or disconnect it does restore 0.0.0.0 into route table)\nthe only thing left is to ensure that No Adjustments of Routing Table will be in our installations always off (we got to this issue because of using settings from Unix platform where it is set to true by default, in CmCreateNewAccountObject(...) method I think)\nso will close this issue, but feel free to open this issue if No Adjustments of Routing Table is meant to be on by default in windows (when SoftEther-Client is installed the first time).

    "Andy2244": "Opened a new more specific one #575 after checking the source and not finding a easy way to uncomment/define out the updates. What i did for now, is patch the default values to 24h and max to 7 days for my openwrt package.. @chipitsine I don't have a simple script, i maintain a package feed with this git version as upstream for the openwrt-sdk.\nopenwrt sdk: https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/start\nmy feed for the updated dev version: https://github.com/Andy2244/openwrt-extra\nThere is also a docker based sdk builder: https://github.com/jandelgado/lede-dockercompiler\nThey also have a buildbot with logs (target/packages/softether), currently only the old stable 4.25 version is officially supported, but i will try and create a PR for this dev/git version. http://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/faillogs/\nAs you can see the old version fails on many targets, because the old buildsystem was hard to adapt to correctly cross-compile. My feed adapts your new cmake version and was much easier, cleaner to adapt.\nPS: I also did a quick search and seems this is a general problem. \nWhat i found is this (last comment): https://github.com/anrieff/libcpuid/issues/96\nand related: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/stdsimd/tree/master/stdsimd/arch/detect\nBtw samba4 has a similar problem, we cant enable aes-ni support, since there is no runtime detection and we can't just blindly enable it at compile time for all x86_64 targets, so we just disable it.... Just found a possible solution, check: https://github.com/google/cpu_features\nWe can ask in the openwrt community to test the mips/arm targets with aes support, if you want to also try enable acceleration on those?. Its only fixed for newly added files.\ngit clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git still produces source files with CRLF endings on unix.\nI'm not sure how to regenerate all files in the database, without re-adding them. I had the same problem and ended up deleting/re-adding them to my repo and than squashed via git rebase -i HEAD~2.\nI understand that this might not be a option for this repo, but we should be aware that now any newly added file will have LF endings on unix, while old files still have CRLF.\nPS: If you find a way to regenerate existing files to LF endings please let me know, since that's also what i could not figure out.. I mean you could just delete/re-add all cross platform files in a single commit or is this too risky for some reason?. Optional as in the openssl lib not compiled with support for it and therefor this build fails with undefined refs.\nWhy two commits, i don't understand?. ah oki, so just two commits in one PR or two PR?. done, split into two commits. oki need to fix the special OPENSSL_INSTALL_DIR handling. @davidebeatrici @paulmenzel need some help, have no clue where on osx the openssl includes are located? Is openssl there also installed under OPENSSL_INSTALL_DIR=\"${HOME}/opt\" ?\nDoes brew upgrade openssl also install the dev headers, since on linux you have to add openssl-dev?. @davidebeatrici Thanks, so /usr/local/opt/openssl/ is the default install location of openssl? Just wondering if using the OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR on osx is viable.. @davidebeatrici Yeah but it seems on osx cmake cant find openssl, without either explicitly defining OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR or adding the custom includes/lib. I would expect cmake to find a default openssl installation on osx and only if it has a custom install location OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR should be necessary?\nPS: Maybe i expect too much from cmake.. woops, kinda hard to test this without being able to run this locally.. Small fish, my samba4 commits took 45-70 minutes per testrun while using all available cores.\nStill trying to find a clean solution for osx.. @davidebeatrici oki ready for review. Nice so the google lib worked out. \nKeep in mind that this does not just report aes-ni, but rather all \"known\" aes accelerators/hardware support. So on x86 this may include (Geode LX, VIA) and on arm its ARM cryptographic extensions.  Mips/mips64 might have some too, but i'm not aware of any for aes.\nSo the code/lib also needs to support those or use some fallback.\nhttps://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/cryptographic.hardware.accelerators . @chipitsine I just hack it for openwrt:\n$(SED) 's/\"eucJP\"/\"utf-8\"/gI' $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/src/Mayaqua/Internat.c. Why was this closed?\nThis is independent of #652 and my PR was not the fix for this.. Np, but is it normal to have to define this (-DHWCAPS_ANDROID_MIPS_OR_ARM) manually via cflags?. I'm cross-compiling for mips/arm yes, but the error happens only on the host part (x86_64), which just compiles the hamcorebuilder.\nThats why its weird that i need to add a host only cflags define, thats related to arm/mips.\nHOST_CFLAGS += -DHWCAPS_ANDROID_MIPS_OR_ARM\nYou can check my makefile here: https://github.com/Andy2244/openwrt-extra/tree/master/softethervpn-server. Yes <sys/auxv.h> exists or i would get a missing include error.\nWhat i don't get is that  and  has the actual define, yet only if i add:\n#include <linux/auxvec.h> does the compile work.\nNot even manually adding  to the top works? I don't get how the elf.h define somehow gets undefined again?. ```c\nifndef _SYS_AUXV_H\ndefine _SYS_AUXV_H\nifdef __cplusplus\nextern \"C\" {\nendif\ninclude \ninclude \nunsigned long getauxval(unsigned long);\nifdef __cplusplus\n}\nendif\nendif\n``. I'm not getting it...\nI will just do for the makefile:HOST_CFLAGS += -DAT_HWCAP2=26`\nPS: I build inside a alpine/docker container, yet for me the define is in elf.h/auxvec.h, that's also true for my docker host, which is ClearLinux. What i don't get is  is included via , so the define should be there, yet the build fails.. wow holy cow.... found the problem.\n<sys/aux.h> comes from the docker host, while  comes from the openwrt sdk ./staging_dir/host/include/elf.h\nThis elf.h files is somehow older and has no AT_HWCAP2 define....\noki thanks, now i have to figure out where this older version is coming from.\nPS: closing this, its a openwrt issue. That's not the official repo https://github.com/openwrt/packages and stop using LEDE \ud83d\ude04 \nLEDE is dead and was merged back to openWRT nearly a year ago, there is no LEDE anymore.\nI just commented it, since in the future mips/ppc might get aes acceleration as well and the members might be supported.\n. Just remembered that you can use codeload and a hidden redirect to get a proper filename-version scheme.\nhttps://codeload.github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/tar.gz/v5.01.9658\nhttps://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/archive/v5.01.9658/SoftEtherVPN-v5.01.9658.tar.gz. Thanks will test this next week, if i have some time for openWRT again.. thanks is fixed and working now.. @chipitsine What are you asking exactly, if this PR works for my openWRT version? I will have to adapt the makefile, but don't see why it wont, only some output dirs changed?. > \n\n@Andy2244 you're just repeating what i said\n\nSorry just skimmed over the thread and missed your quick note about this :). > \n\nAnd create a directory like SoftEtherVPN-${VERSION} under the tarball.

    "thepyper": "Hi!\nI've traced back some debugging I did in 2015, here is results of my findings at that time:\n\nThe problem lies in InitInternational, it does not couple well with musl iconv support (that is more limited than gnu iconv).\nAs a reference, you can look into:\nhttp://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/locale/iconv.c\nIn particular:\n1) at Internat.c \\ line 935, tries to call iconv_open(\"C\", \"UTF-16BE\");\nthis fails because \"C\" has no meaning to musl iconv (at least that seems to me)\n2) at Internat.c \\ line 943, tries to call iconv_open(\"EUCJP\", \"UTF-16BE\");\nthis fails because that combination is not supported (while \"EUCJP\" and \"UTF-16BE\" are recognized by musl)\n3) at Internat.c \\ line 960, tries to call iconv_open(\"US\", \"UTF-16BE\");\nthis faile because \"US\" has no meaning to musl iconv;\nthere is 2 simple solutions to that problem:\n1) use \"UTF-8\", as is done on MACOSX system, this works with musl (well, it does not block make at least :)\n2) use \"ASCII\" or \"USASCII\" or \"ISO646\" or \"ISO646US\" instead of \"US\", those should be synonims in musl for \"US\".\n(see line 41 in http://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/locale/iconv.c)\n\ndon't know if iconv logic changed in-between... \n. Why disabling it, when a simple fix is available?\nI'm using softether compiled this way since 2015, and it has no problems on musl...\n. Uhm... sorry I'm not understanding exactly :)\nMusl is libc implementation, and of course I build softether on alpine linux with gcc (which on alpine uses musl as libc implementation).\nI have no issues with musl but I'm no libc expert so cannot judge whenever musl / glibc / newlib / whatever libc is better and why, I just want to compile softether on alpile linux because I like some features of this distro...\nWell, whatever :)\nI will continue manually patching softether when I compile on musl, no problem. \nHope you will not change it to completely refuse compiling on musl, or at least keep an \"override\" option please :)\n. This particular issue is only seen at runtime, yes. I spent some time debugging it, basically everything needing a string (all texts) was failing because iconv was not able to convert it; so issue was pretty evident itself :)\nI don't want to be pushy, your software your choices: I just tell you that by my experience there is no other known issue on musl; I used both client and server features, and never experienced any strange behaviour.\nSecond thought is that this fix is not my invention, it's already being used to make softether run correctly on macosX, so it's already \"well-tested\" I suppose; all I did is to enable inconditionally that fix. A more conservative approach would be, if you can spot musl during cmake phase (I have no cmake experience), to enable the fix only for MUSL, changing line 938 in Internat.c from:\nifdef  UNIX_MACOS\nto \nif defined(UNIX_MACOS) || defined(UNIX_MUSL)  (whatever flag reveals musl)\n. Problem happens at runtime: the iconv_open call fails (see previous comments for details) during softether initializations.\nThen, every time softether tries translating a string, it fails because during initializations iconv_open failed.\nDon't remember exactly the behaviour, but was pretty unusable (I mean it was not a subtle but, just nothing worked :). Sure I will do next days when I will be back in office..\nFor my curiosity, could anybody give me some hint about why musl is considered so bad? As said I have no idea I just use it because alpine Linux used it.. just curious!. Changed comment accordingly to title...\n. I'm confused then :) don't understand if:\n1. it's ok to merge that change so everybody will use \"utf-8\";\n2. you would like to mantain current behaviour and change it only for musl.\nOption 2 is quite difficult, as musl faq explains:\n(see question: Why is there no MUSL macro?)\nhttps://wiki.musl-libc.org/faq.html\nhttp://openwall.com/lists/musl/2013/03/29/13\nSo there is no easy way to know that compiler is using musl, as musl authors believe that you should not rely on knowing it, as musl is perfect and bug-less :P \n. Too bad, I liked the old-fashioned makefiles there :)\nWell, I have tested on alpine linux the build with modified makefiles and it works and produces working executables.\nHow can I get the cmake branch? where is it? better, what should I write on my console to get it?\ngit clone ...whatever...\nThen I suppose I should make a new PR?\n. Uff, should be ok now :)\nSomebody could add a note on documentation about that way of building, or will it remain an \"undocumented secret\"? :)\n. ",

    "kawing-chiu": "Exactly the same problem here. The tcp connection to SQL server dies after around 40 seconds if using softether vpn (with securenat enabled). This issue does not exist if connecting to SQL server directly in LAN, without using softether vpn. Have no idea where this 40 seconds timeout comes from.. I investigated the issue a bit further and captured packets on both the client side and the server side. Due to lack of knowledge in tcp protocol debugging, I am not able to interpret the capture log in detail but it looks suspicious (strangely, this time the connection breaks at around 1 min, not 40 secs).\nHere is my setup: 192.168.30.10 is the client 's ip behind SecureNAT 's NAT (SecureNAT's virtual gateway is 192.168.30.1). (Edit: In this test, the securenat function is in user mode). The machine running softether vpn bridge with SecureNAT is 10.38.18.161. And the sql server that the client try to communicate is at 10.38.63.7 port 1433.\nThe connection worked well at the begining. The client logged in to the sql server and successfully performed a select 1 query. However, after the connection idled for some time, something went wrong and the connection was reset unexpectedly. From some point on, the client sent keepalive to the server at a high frequency and then later reset the connection.\n\nHere are the wireshark capture files:\nclient_capture.zip server_capture.zip\nEdit: Now I know why this test is different from the previous tests (i.e. not break at around 40 secs). This is because in previous tests, the securenat function is in kernel-mode and raw ip mode. While in this test, the seurenat function is in user mode. I did not alter any of the config of SoftEther vpn, but it seems that whether or not to use kernel-mode/raw ip mode nat is chosen somewhat randomly at each boot, this may indicate another bug.\n. Now I conduct the same test when securenat is in kernel-mode. The client / server settings is the same as above. This time the connection breaks after idling for about 40 secs. From the capture files, we can see that although the connection just breaks as the previous test, it is of different reason. This time, it is the server that tries to send a lot of keep-alive messages to the client, but failed to get a response, so it cut off the connection.\nHere are the wireshark capture files for this second test (securenat in kernel/raw ip mode):\nclient_capture_2.zip server_capture_2.zip\n. To sum up: This bug occurs whether the securenat fucntion is in kernel/raw ip mode or in user mode. While in these two cases the same symptom is exhibited from the user's point of view (connection break up after idling for some time),  it looks quite different at the tcp packet level.

    "RickSanch3z": "@chipitsine Hello,\nIt's not an issue by itself because I don't use this software in enterprise environment. I just wanted to notice the observation (I described in my opening message).\nI found it's strange that there is a constant UDP exchange between client and server even if you configure to use TCP. You can try and simulate it (and catch packets with \"wireshark\").\nThe reason why I'm interested because I don't think that this behavior is part of SoftEther protocol and probably a bug.\nThank you.. Would screenshot be ok? Posting a wireshark dump of my internal/external network addresses is not the option.\nIf it's ok I'll post it tomorrow.\nThanks.. @chipitsine ok.\nAs you can see my first post is relatively old. So I do not remember in details the problem. The behavior may have been different.\nI'll try to explain the screenshot:\n\n192.162.43.145 is my client local IP address.\n192.162.0.14 is my server local IP address.\nOne can observe that connection is unidirectional (from client to server). And ports is always constant (I did not verified if ports are constant from one session to another).\nAnd as one can see each time client send two packets with the same size (I verified the payload is same too) to the server local IP address and to the server external IP address.\nThe question now. Why client behave like this? And how in the first place client know the local IP address of SoftEther VPN server.\nP.S.: I've used port 5556 and TCP on server configuration side.. Today I tried capture packets from the server perspective (screenshot from previous post was from client view of point).\nAnd this is the result (from client side. On server side is mirrored). Not similar to previous one.\n\nNo change in configuration were made on server/client side from previous test.. @chipitsine Hello,\nI've tried to disable \"udp acceleration\" on the client side (in advanced settings) and it seems to remove the problem. It's supposed to work even when connection is TCP based?\nNow I want to ask where I can get information a little bit more about this \"udp acceleration\" (on softehter docs? Other resources?).\nAnd no. Wireshark does not decode the payload. If you explain me how I can decode the payload (if it's some useful information) I can try to decode it.\nThanks.. @chipitsine \nSure.\nThe main goal of using softether was to share/play with a friend. At this moment no partner to test under payload. I can test it later.\nWhat I can test today is vpn connection with \"background\" traffic with/without \"udp acceleration\".\nBut if I remember \"udp acceleration\" is constant so no matter how heavy is payload it's absolute value does not change. But I could be wrong.\n*\"background\" traffic - traffic generated by OS, ARP, discovery services etc. And then compare it (TCP) vs \"udp acceleration\" (UDP).\n. Some results with passive payload:\nUDP acceleration ON:\nTCP connections: 8\nHalf-Duplex: OFF\nClient capture time 1 hour: \nCaptured file size: 6,593,734 bytes:\n    UDP: 2,118,627 (32,131%) bytes;\n    TCP: 4,475,107 (67,869%) bytes\nNumber of packets: 35253:\n    UDP: 14291 (40.5%);\n    TCP: 20962 (59.5%);\nUDP acceleration OFF:\nTCP connections: 8\nHalf-Duplex: OFF\nClient capture time 1 hour: \nCaptured file size: 4,873,406 bytes:\n    UDP: -;\n    TCP: 4,873,406 (100%) bytes\nNumber of packets: 25,234:\n    UDP: -;\n    TCP: 25,234 (100%);\nUDP acceleration OFF:\nTCP connections: 8\nHalf-Duplex: ON\nClient capture time 1 hour: \nCaptured file size: 2,785,518 bytes:\n    UDP: -;\n    TCP: 2,785,518 (100%) bytes\nNumber of packets: 16,601:\n    UDP: -;\n    TCP: 16,601 (100%);\nAs I said UDP traffic here could be constant regardless traffic load. Need to be tested.. @dnobori \nSo how I understand UDP_ACCELERATION is for the case when we can't use port forwarding? Because if we can use port forwarding (for UDP) NAT will not terminate (?) the session.\n. @chipitsine \nFor volunteering to code one should be a good C/C++ programmer :). @chipitsine it is always good when you can hire \"en plus\" if you need to implement something.\nThe question is money.\nWhy not to start some sort of donations on the \"softether\" main page? Raising money to implement some new experimental features? I saw someone asked to implement \"wireguard\".. Softether is present in \"opencollective\"?\nIf not they should be. One can suppose that there is VPN companies / private businesses that implementing softether right now. They have interest to have a better product and more functionality.. ",

    "ronneke1996": "I will test this after the weekend.\n. This fix seems to work with my tests. If you ask me this can be merged.. Thanks for the quick reply!\nAlright, after some more testing I did notice that Windows did indeed get an ip and it's only a problem on Linux. \nThough when using the standard OpenVPN server (which I plan to replace with a SoftEther one), the server does send an ip to Linux and Windows without the manual dhclient call.\nMaybe this could be a new feature for SoftEther? Perhaps a setting that forces the SoftEther OpenVPN server to send out dhcp leases.. That's wonderfull to hear.\nI'll be able to test this on Monday. #827  seems like a great solution to our problem, so I'll test this tomorrow. And it's also great that the OpenVPN bug got fixed with #828 .\nYou guys are amazing \ud83d\ude04 . I've tested #827 and #828 and both seems to be working fine. If its up to me this feature can be merged. Again, thank you for the great work!. Alright, that totally understandable. I'll make a patch from your implementation for my own projects.. As I'm working quite a bit with SoftEther in the past few weeks and especially OpenVPN I thought I'd test this also for a bit. \nI've also found that connecting with a certificate with SoftEther via the Openvpn 3 Android app does not work for some reason. I've build the SoftEther in debug mode for some more logs and this is what I found.\nWhen connecting to the SE server with openvpn 2:\nSslCertVerifyCallback preverify error: 'self signed certificate in certificate chain'\nBut with openvpn 3:\nSslCertVerifyCallback preverify error: 'unable to get local issuer certificate'\nSslCertVerifyCallback preverify error: 'unable to verify the first certificate'\nAlso if I override the password as @davidebeatrici said with User/PW + Certificate I do get the username in the logs  like Connection \"CID-01\": User authentication failed. The user name that has been provided was \"test_user\"., but still get \"External server authentication\" as the auth type instead of certificate.\nIt seems like something goes wrong when verifying the certificate. But it's odd that this only happens when you try to connect with an Openvpn 3 client and not with an Openvpn 2 client. \n. After another test i got the Openvpn 3 Android app working. With the following changes.\nI changed the openvpn config file to have the ca certificate also in the  brackets.\nOld config (not working):\n```\nconfig stuff....\n\n--ca cert--\n\n\n--client cert--\n\n\n--client key--\n\nNew config (working):\nconfig stuff....\n\n--ca cert--\n\n\n--client cert--\n--client cert ca--\n\n\n--client key--\n\n```\nNotes:\n In my case the ca cert is the same as the client cert ca.\n This only works if the client cert ca is after the client cert. Like @paskal said I really like the debian package naming. \nI do think you should add something like the commit hash(the short hash) for builds that do not have a tag. So when somebody builds from master you would know which version and commit they use. This would also be easier for reporting issue etc.\nSo something like this:\nTags:\nsoftether-common_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnbridge_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnclient_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpncmd_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnserver_5.1.9667_amd64.deb\nBuild from master/other branches\nsoftether-common_5.1.9667.3b85a11_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnbridge_5.1.9667.3b85a11_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnclient_5.1.9667.3b85a11_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpncmd_5.1.9667.3b85a11_amd64.deb\nsoftether-vpnserver_5.1.9667.3b85a11_amd64.deb\nThis could be achieved by using the TWEAK version option from cmake..

    "Alchiadus": "Thank you for the patch! This works great to retrieve a DHCP lease in TAP mode, but I ran into an issue where the lease would not get automatically renewed.\nAfter an investigation I found that it is related to the IPC_ARP_LIFETIME constant as defined in IPC.h. If the IPC_ARP_LIFETIME >= DHCP_LEASE_TIME / 3 then the OpenVPN connection in TAP mode will get its DHCP lease refreshed, otherwise it will lose its lease. With the default ARP lifetime of 180 seconds and default DHCP lease time of 7200 seconds the TAP connections will always lose their lease.\nWhen it is time to renew the DHCP lease (after DHCP_LEASE_TIME / 3 time has passed) the stack looks roughly as follows:\nIPCSendIPv4 IPC.c:1665\nIPCSendDhcpRequest IPC.c:964\nIPCDhcpRenewIP IPC.c:755\nOvsRecvPacket Proto_OpenVPN.c:2509\nAnd an ARP request will be inserted (Raspberry Pi has an OpenVPN connection to SoftEther in TAP mode, where 10.10.10.2 is the Pi and 10.10.10.1 is the Hub):\n2019-02-18,10:23:44.173,SID-RASPBERRYPI-[OPENVPN_L2]-2,-,CA9D21C48D80,FFFFFFFFFFFF,0x0806,42,ARPv4,Request,-,-,-,-,-,-,Who has 10.10.10.1? Please Tell CA9D21C48D80(10.10.10.2),-,172.27.1.100,-\n2019-02-18,10:23:44.173,SID-SECURENAT-1,SID-RASPBERRYPI-[OPENVPN_L2]-2,5EBCCBFA9A23,CA9D21C48D80,0x0806,42,ARPv4,Response,-,-,-,-,-,-,5EBCCBFA9A23 has 10.10.10.1,-,-,172.27.1.100\nThis ARP request is always done regardless of whether or not the ARP lifetime has expired. Unfortunately, only when the DHCP renew request is made before the ARP lifetime has expired it will be refreshed. If the DHCP renew request is done after, then it appears that the request gets lost, perhaps because it is not sent once the ARP response is received, but I have not been able to verify this.\nAfter changing the IPC_ARP_LIFETIME to 60 * 60 * 1000 (1 hour), the DHCP lease of OpenVPN connections in TAP mode will correctly get renewed when using the default DHCP lease time of 2 hours.\nI was unable to pinpoint exactly where things go wrong. Is it safe to set the ARP lifetime to such a high value? Does SoftEther depend on a low ARP lifetime? It appears that ARP entries related to a session are correctly cleaned up after this session ends, but I'm not sure if ARP entries are copied across multiple servers where such long living stale entries might pose problems?. > Is your certificate's common name set?\nThe certificate's common name is indeed set.\n@ronneke1996's findings correspond with my own. Unfortunately I won't be able to test the proposed workaround / fix until I get back into the office after the holidays, but I am quite confident it will also solve the issue for me.\nI appreciate the suggestions, will report back after I can confirm.. I can confirm that adding the client cert ca after the client cert in the cert block indeed works, verification succeeds and the connection is successfully established.\nI am not sure if the issue lies within OpenVPN 3, or within SoftEther. As @ronneke1996 mentioned, the verification already fails at the SslCertVerifyCallback stage, before the code snippet shown by @davidebeatrici. The following is pure speculation, but could it be that OpenVPN 3 does not send the root CA together with the client certificate because it is assumed to be known by the server? As an optimisation similar to how browsers do not require the root certificate to be sent because it is assumed to be present locally on the computer? If something like that is the case, perhaps SoftEther could add a check for it.\nThanks again for the suggestions and workaround, this solves the issue for me.. I took a brief look at the tests included with OpenVPN 3 and it looks like the transmission channel is mocked:\nOpenVPN/openvpn3/test/ssl/proto.cpp\nThis would make it difficult to perform an integration test similar to eb64940 without making changes to the OpenVPN 3 code base, as I don't see a way to instruct the OpenVPN 3 client side unit tests to communicate with a separate OpenVPN server (e.g. SoftEther).\nDo you have any suggestions?.

However, if I execute ip link set vpn_interface1 down when the first connection is off, and then I restart it... in this case the number of TX packets dropped stops to increase. Perhaps a simple ip link down when the client interface is off (or when the user stops it, or when a reconnection is done) will fix the problem.\n\nI discovered that executing vpncmd and inside the CLI run TUNDownOnDisconnectEnable then the TUN interfaces are going down when the session is off. Great!\nHowever, the problem of the TX packets dropped now appears time to time. Now, with this option enabled, when the problem appears, a simple stop/start of the session will solve the problem. However, the trouble continues... \nIdeas?. Hi,\nAfter several days running it, I discovered that after the first time the TX packets dropped start to rise, it never appears after it. So, if you execute one time the stop/restart of the session then you will not show troubles anymore.\n\nSo, it's possible some initialization bug?\nOne workaround is a simple stop/start at first run (or in boot).\n\nI suggest to do some review, or almost include some initial restart option in the config file.\nThank you for this great VPN!.

It's always better to have the software secure by default. Normal users, who usually don't have technical background, may not understand the risk of not checking the server's certificate. \nIf the SoftEther VPN team doesn't want to change the default value of \"CheckServerCert\", is it possible to update the examples (e.g. this) so that the value is set to True? Also, is it possible to update the guides and documentations of the software so that SoftEther VPN users would understand more about the importance of the \"\"CheckServerCert\" setting?. ",
