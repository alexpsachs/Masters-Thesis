There's no way that I know of to stopexpatfrom parsing a subtree and treat it as CDATA instead, but you could investigate further and come back with a pull request ;)\n. @slestak It's not a perfect solution for this scenario, as it would imply an unwanted and in some cases lossy XML->dict->XML transformation.\nIt is, however, a good idea for a useful general-purpose feature. I have forked this into a new issue [here](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/issues/6) and will work on it.\n. fixed in release v0.3\n. With streaming mode, you can return a false-ish value from your callback function to stop parsing. If this doesn't solve your issue, can you provide a concrete example?\n. I get it. In this case, you should use apostprocessor, not the streaming mode.\nThe postprocessing function gets three arguments in (path,keyandvalue) and must return a(key, value)tuple orNone` to skip the node altogether.\n\n\n\nIf you want to skip odd <item>s, you should do something like this:\n``` python\nxml = '''\n\nItem1\nItem2\nItem3\nItem4\n'''\nclass SkipOddValues:\n    def init(self, key):\n        self.key = key\n        self.count = 0\ndef __call__(self, path, key, value):\n    if key != self.key:\n        return key, value\n    self.count += 1\n    if self.count % 2 == 1:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return key, value\n\ndoc = xmltodict.parse(xml, postprocessor=SkipOddValues('item'))\n``\n. Welcome!\n. I'm not sure I understand. Can you explain a bit further, with a code example if possible?\n. Got it! It does sound like a nice to have a feature. I'll give it a look.\n. Something like that?\n. Welcome! It's out in v0.4.\n.cdata_separator='\\n'should do (no need toforce_cdata`)\n. @dubanoze describe issue not\n. That's great news!\nThe patch looks good to me, I will ship it with 0.4.2.\nThanks!\n. Done: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict/0.4.2\n. I would, because I'm a human being and I know children is the plural form of child. The only thing xmltodict knows, though, is that it has only found one value for the child node (same way as with root, children and name), so there's no need for iterable objects there.\nYou can easily work around this by using a custom dict_constructor that always starts off with empty lists as values, i.e.:\npython\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nxmltodict.parse(xml, dict_constructor=lambda *args, **kwargs: defaultdict(list, *args, **kwargs))\n. @foxx I understand it can be annoying, but I think the other option is even worse. For example, with this XML:\nxml\n<config>\n  <settings>\n    <value1>0</value1>\n    <value2>false</value2>\n  </settings>\n  <logging>\n    <value3>1</value3>\n    <value4>true</value4>\n  </logging>\n</config>\nI would expect a dict like this:\npython\n{\n    \"config\": {\n        \"settings\": {\n            \"value1\": \"0\",\n            \"value2\": \"false\"\n        },\n        \"logging\": {\n            \"value3\": \"1\",\n            \"value4\": \"true\"\n        },\n    }\n}\nBut with your proposal I would get this instead:\npython\n{\n    \"config\": [{\n        \"settings\": [{\n            \"value1\": [\"0\"],\n            \"value2\": [\"false\"]\n        }],\n        \"logging\": [{\n            \"value3\": [\"1\"],\n            \"value4\": [\"true\"]\n        }],\n    }]\n}\nIn order to access the configuration values, you would have to use d['config'][0]['settings'][0]['value1'][0] instead of d['config']['settings']['value1']. Other users might think this is surprising behavior too, so I believe which option is better depends on the use case.\nAlso, the Python standard library doesn't have a DefaultDict that is also an OrderedDict. If I followed your suggestion and used DefaultDict in the next release, xmltodict would lose the elements' ordering information, which could also be surprising for some use cases (and break code that depends on this).\n. The best we can do about this is improve the documentation, I think. @foxx, what would you add to the README to make this behavior less surprising?\n. @kadnan @candlerb this feature is already out in the 0.10.1 release. Which version are you running on? I just did a fresh install and it worked fine:\n``` sh\n$ pip install xmltodict\nCollecting xmltodict\n  Downloading xmltodict-0.10.1.tar.gz\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: xmltodict\n  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for xmltodict ... done\n  Stored in directory: /Users/martinblech/Library/Caches/pip/wheels/06/23/c0/b5e91910dc6261d118f437bc4c487972e3b00147e09372f8bc\nSuccessfully built xmltodict\nInstalling collected packages: xmltodict\nSuccessfully installed xmltodict-0.10.1\n$ python\nPython 2.7.11 (default, Feb 22 2016, 19:49:39)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n\n\nimport xmltodict\nxml = '''\n... \n...   .1.\n...   .2.\n...   .3.\n...   .4.\n...   .5.\n... \n...

No problem, glad it worked in the end.\n. You can use a postprocessor for that:\n\n\n\n``` python\ndef postprocessor(path, key, value):\n    try:\n        value = value.strip()\n        if not value:\n            return None\n    except:\n        pass\n    return key, value\no = xmltodict.parse( infile.read() , postprocessor=postprocessor);\njson.dump( o , outfile, indent=2 )\n```\nand get this out:\njavascript\n\"Service\": {\n  \"kind\": \"1\"\n}\nHowever, this should be the default behavior. Use this as a workaround while I fix this for a new release. Thanks!\n. fixed with this commit by @slestak https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/commit/2c2b4601e640481bd0ea5c3bf0c22d883eca47e5\n. what's up with the unit tests?\n. I see the test is failing because your expected dict doesn't have a 'emptya' key. We don't want to completely lose that node, but check that it's value is None (as if all that whitespace wasn't there).\n. Looks good now!\n. Unicode support can be quite difficult to achieve on both python 2 and 3 with the same codebase. I will look into this.\n. Fixed with commit 75f885bfc81a7d95e885e81e94330ff9827b6e6f\n. That's correct, unparse() is officially done but still undocumented. Thanks for pointing it out!\nAre you using it? Can you try to come up with a small example for the README?\n. Now there's an example in README.md, but I'm leaving this issue open until I find the time to write the docstring.\n. Looks great. Thank you a lot for the contribution!\n. @LORDofDOOM It's breaking the Travis build. Have you investigated why? https://travis-ci.org/martinblech/xmltodict/builds/6913744\n. Conversions like this don't belong in the core library, as xmltodict should not be tied to specific types of XML. The recommended way of doing this is using a postprocessor. Thanks for the input!\n. You are welcome!\n. I will definitely consider it for the next release. Thank you for your input!\n. You can start using it in v0.5.0, just released. xmltodict still defaults to the built-in expat, but you can pass defusedexpat.pyexpat instead using the expat parameter, just look at parse()'s docstring.\n. I like the idea: pretty-printing is surely a useful feature. However, I'm not sure I like the approach. You are extending XMLGenerator but then completely overriding the core startElement(), endElement() and characters() methods. I would bet there are corner cases that the new implementation doesn't cover but XMLGenerator does.\nI think the right, robust way to do this is by leaving XMLGenerator untouched and modifying our own _emit function to pass a depth parameter to itself and call content_handler.ignorableWhitespace() appropriately.\nI will close this pull request but keep this issue open. Thank you for opening up the discussion!\n. @ahalbert I'm just pinging you to let you know I finally got around to implementing pretty print in unparse(), in case you would like to start using it. Cheers!\n. > I think the right, robust way to do this is by leaving XMLGenerator untouched and modifying our own _emit function to pass a depth parameter to itself and call content_handler.ignorableWhitespace() appropriately.\n. I'm glad you found it useful. The KeyError means the article dict doesn't have a 'title' key. Have you tried debugging your script? What keys does the article dict have? Sometimes a few prints can help a lot!\n. You should at least print the exception stack trace, error alone doesn't say much. You could also print the whole untouched page object to see exactly what your callback function is being called with.\n. You should the json module to turn it into JSON, e.g.:\n``` python\n\nimport xmltodict\n\n\nfoo = xmltodict.parse(\"\"\"<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n...         \n...           john\n...           20\n...         \"\"\")\nprint json.dumps(foo)\n{\"person\": {\"name\": \"john\", \"age\": \"20\"}}\n```\n\n\n\nOrderedDict is just a dict that preserves key order (makes sure that if you round-trip that object to XML, name will always come before age).\n. Looks like a reasonable fallback. Thanks for the contribution!\n. I certainly didn't start the project with namespaces in mind, as you probably guessed from their complete absence in the examples and tests.\nYour use case doesn't seem very complicated. I will have a look at it and see how much pyexpat can help me in this direction. I would love to add this feature if it doesn't bloat xmltodict for the simplest use cases.\nThanks for your input!\n. @tomstrummer\nWhat's exactly the role of the namespaces dict argument in your example? I see that it has entries for one='http://one.com' and two='http://two.com', but three is missing, but as far as I can see, one, two and three are treated equally in your example's output.\nWhat difference does it make for a namespace to be present or missing in namespaces?\n. @tomstrummer Ok, it should have been there. But what if it wasn't? What would be a reasonable default behavior for xmltodict in case it bumps into a namespace that is not among the values of the namespaces dict? Should it raise an exception?\nI'm just trying to figure out what's the purpose of the namespaces dict in your example.\n. Fixed with release 0.7.0\n. Looks good to me. Thanks for the contribution!\n. This is a duplicate of #14. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for xmltodict to know beforehand which elements are supposed to be lists and which are supposed to be single elements. I can think of 2 workarounds for this:\n- The dict_constructor approach I described in #14, in which case all values will be lists (doc['root'][0]['abc'][1]['tr'] == ['four']).\n- Writing your own postprocessor that cherry picks the values that should be converted to lists in your particular type of document.\n. @tomstrummer will something like this do?\n. You should return True from your callback function, e.g.:\npython\ndef handle_artist(_, artist):\n    print artist['name']\n    return True\nReturning a falsy value (such as None in your case) makes xmltodict stop parsing and raise a ParsingInterrupted exception.\n. But then I realise the example in the README is wrong. Good find, thanks!\n. @AlexMikhalev did it work for you after adding return True?\n. Thank you for the contribution, but I think you can already achieve this by passing jsobject or AttrDict as dict_constructor to parse().\nThis functionality is not core to xmltodict, and since you can already get it with help from another module that's available on PyPI, I don't think it's necessary to merge these changes.\n. I meant passing it as dict_constructor to parse(), overriding the default (OrderedDict), e.g.:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxd.parse(x, dict_constructor=jo.JSObject)\n```\n\n\n\nDoesn't this work for you?\n. @rjbez17 Doing it this way also more efficient, as xmltodcit creates JsObjects right away, instead of creating regular dicts and throwing them away after converting them to XMLObjects in the end. Also, it's less code to maintain!\nI would be happy to merge a pull request documenting this in the README, though... :wink: :wink:\n. I don't see the issue here. If you want to compare two documents, it doesn't make a difference at all whether you use OrderedDict or a regular dict:\n``` python\n\n\n\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nOrderedDict([('a', 'b')]) == {'a': 'b'}\nTrue\n```\n\n\n\nHowever, if you don't want to use OrderedDicts at all and just want to use regular dicts all over, it's easy to override the default behavior using the dict_constructor parameter:\n``` python\n\n\n\nimport xmltodict\nxmltodict.parse('b', dict_constructor=dict)\n{u'a': u'b'}\n``\n. Thanks @qixiuying for reporting this! @alesdotio You are right, I have to includedistribute_setup.py` in the package.\n\n\n\nI just removed this buggy release and reverted to v0.7.0 until I get the time to fix it.\n. Fixed with release 0.8.1\n. I've just upgraded xmltodict to the latest version of setuptools. Can you try pip install xmltodict==0.8.2 and see if it works now?\n. Can you try 0.8.3 now? It now tries to use your system's setuptools if available before attempting to install 1.1.6. It worked for me locally.\n. welcome! thanks for reporting this!\n. It's not incorrect, it's just one of the possible ways of handling lists. What matters is that unparse() is consistent with parse() and roundtrips correctly.\nI understand that this way of handling lists can be annoying for your use case, but if I changed xmltodict to your convenience I still wouldn't be able to make everyone happy. If this:\npython\n{\n  'response': {\n    'versions': [\n      {'version': 1},\n      {'version': 2}\n    ]\n  }\n}\nunperses to:\nxml\n<response>\n  <versions>\n    <version>1</version>\n    <version>2</version>\n  </versions>\n</response>\nThen it means that this:\nxml\n<settings>\n  <bind>localhost</bind>\n  <bind>192.168.1.1</bind>\n  <port>8080</port>\n</settings>\nhas to parse to:\npython\n{\n  'settings': [\n    {'bind': 'localhost'},\n    {'bind': '192.168.1.1'},\n    {'port': '8080'}\n  ]\n}\nWhich would be a pain to use, compared with this, which is the current behavior:\npython\n{\n  'settings': {\n    'bind': ['localhost', '192.168.1.1'],\n    'port': '8080'\n  }\n}\n. That's what the strip_whitespace argument is for: deciding whether to strip whitespace or not. It defaults to True, but if you pass False you get what you're looking for:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxml = '''<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n... \n...     \n...         SEPARATOR\n...          \n...     \n... \n... '''\ndoc = xmltodict.parse(xml, strip_whitespace=False)\ndoc['service']['key']['value']\nu'\\t'\n``\n. @chrismatta @grzn @lovato thanks for your input. This issue should have been fixed with release 0.8.4. Could you please verify this is so from your side? Thanks!\n. @neildd looks good, thanks! The only thing missing is a python 2.4 line in.travis.yml`. Can you do that?\n. @twcook I'm unable to reproduce this error. What platform did this happen on? Were you using virtualenv?\n. I setup a clean Ubuntu 12.10 virtual machine, but I still cannot reproduce the error, xmltodict installs just fine.\n\n\n\n@twcook I could try again, but I need step by step instructions to reproduce it in a local environment.\n. The proposed change breaks a large number of test cases: https://travis-ci.org/martinblech/xmltodict/builds/15720916\nCould you clarify the issue a bit further and provide a code example?\n. @dada2801 beginning with 0.8.5, xmltodict is letting the expat XML parser take care of choosing the correct encoding.\n. That's sounds like a nice feature, thanks. I will give it some thought as of how to implement it.\n. @megahall I think it's not a bug: you cannot have a XML document with more than one root node. You should wrap that dict inside another dict with a single key:\npython\n{\n    \"root\": {\n        \"@name\": \"dbl-test\",\n        \"description\": \"dbl-test\",\n        \"recurring\": {\n            \"hourly\": {\n                \"at\": \"00\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"type\": \"ip\",\n        \"url\": \"http://192.168.1.6:8080/pa-dbl.txt\"\n    }\n}\nOtherwise, what XML opening tag should the @name attribute belong to?\n. That's awesome, thank you for this contribution!\n. @skela You should leave out <![CDATA[\u2026]]> from your val. xmltodict will take care of the escaping/unescaping for you, so you shouldn't attempt to introduce XML escaping characters into the values. The right thing to do is just have val = '<a href=\"http://www.space.com\">Hi my name is Bob</a>'.\n. It's just not possible to do this with xmltodict, it's not what the library is intended for.\n. @walko1234 there's no builtin solution, but you could use some DefaultOrderedDict recipe such as this.\n. @fyears Thank you for your input. You can already do this if you pass dict_constructor=dict to the parse() function, as in #39.\n. Yes, I'm afraid it's kinda hidden. I could definitely use some help with\nthe documentation!\nOn Apr 15, 2014 11:40 PM, \"fyears\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWow! There's a hidden feature! I should have a good look at the source\ncode first!\nThank you. :-)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/issues/59#issuecomment-40557514\n.\n. @fyears I appreciate your contribution, but do not think it belongs as part of the library.\n\nxmltodict aims at doing just one thing and doing it well: it turns a valid XML document into a dict and vice versa. Even though it might be useful in your own particular scenario, the raw_text() function produces invalid XML.\n. @sbadia Sure, no problem! It's done: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict/0.9.0\n. @sbadia Are you going to create/maintain an official Debian package for xmltodict? Or is this just for a private .deb?\n. @sbadia awesome, thanks!\n. thanks @sbadia !\n. @dgonyier I don't have a Windows box at reach at the moment, so I cannot reproduce it. It's great that you figured this out on your own, this thread can now be used as reference in case someone googles for this error.\n. @BlackMan82 You are right, it seems that xmltodict does not follow the spec for semi-structured XML nodes.\nWe should detect such cases and have xmltodict behave as specified, it would make much more sense:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxmltodict.parse('sometextualcontent')\n{'e': 'sometextualcontent'}\n```\n\n\n\nI'm still wondering what to do with unparse in this case, though. If I leave it as it is, it would escape <s and >s, something we don't want:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxmltodict.unparse({'e': 'sometextualcontent'}, full_document=False)\n'some<a>textual</a>content'\n```\n. @joohoi Not much, sorry!\n\n\n\nSince xmltodict uses SAX, not DOM, by the time it's able to detect semi-structured XML, it's already too late to process it differently. It would have to backtrack and unparse what has been parsed so far, or else switch to DOM, which would mean rewriting the whole library from scratch.\nPerhaps I'm missing some other alternative, so I'm definitely open to reading proposals or looking at pull requests.\n. While I do appreciate it and thank you for taking the time to write this long proposal, I do not see something like this happening to xmltodict.\nxmltodict aims to be a very simple library that implements just one of the many possible ways one can map XML to and from JSON-like structures. This particular mapping works fine for some simple use cases, but unfortunately it does not for other more complex ones, such as the ones you mention. It does not feature type coercion, meta processing directives nor attribute sniffing. This is by design.\nI do understand that your proposed features must make a lot of sense in your context, so I would like to encourage you to either:\n- Implement all this and submit a Pull Request, so I can review the impact of this added complexity on code maintainability, backwards compatibility and usefulness for the originally intended, simple scenarios. I promise to reconsider my position once I see the implementation and tests.\n- Fork xmltodict and build your own XML processing library on top of it.\n. That's great, thank you for this PR. The only thing missing would be a new entry in the matrix/exclude section to avoid running the tests twice on jython.\nyaml\n matrix:\n    exclude:\n      - python: \"2.6\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n      - python: \"2.7\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n      - python: \"3.2\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n      - python: \"3.3\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n+       - python: \"3.4\"\n+         env: JYTHON=true\n. Perfect! Thanks, @frewsxcv \n. @taylormattison Thank you for reporting this. It was actually a problem with the README: it was missing the process_namespaces=True parameter.\n. @ZoomQuiet Please have a look at #14 for a workaround.\n. @CamyDee Looking forward to see some progress with your fork!\n. I'm sorry, the streaming mode is a bit lacking on the documentation side. Fortunately, the attributes are not lost but passed to the callback as the path argument, e.g.:\n``` python\ndef cb(path, item):\n    print path, item\n    return True\nxmltodict.parse(open(xmlfile), item_depth=2, item_callback=cb)\n[(u'items', None), (u'item', OrderedDict([(u'attr', u'hello')]))] OrderedDict([(u'inner', u'value'), (u'inner2', u'value2')])\n```\n. @pySilver I guess the workaround does work for your use case, but I'm not sure this is would be the correct thing to do. If a l list with N items produces N XML nodes, the logical conclusion should be that a list with 0 items must produce no XML nodes at all, not one empty node:\n``` python\n\n\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': [1, 2, 3]}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': [1, 2]}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n1\n2\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': [1]}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n1\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': []}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n\n```\n. @pySilver I understand, in some use cases (such as yours) it makes more sense to do it that way. I just think that it's not right to force that behavior on all the other users, it's less logical and might not be what they want.\n. @Telofy thank you for reporting this issue, but I am unable to reproduce it locally. Here's the whole interactive Python session:\n\n\n\n``` python\n\n\n\nfrom urllib2 import urlopen\nfrom xmltodict import parse, unparse\nfeed = urlopen('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Telofy/241ca0d28edaef732153/raw/70b9228ee374a285397319ce97b0d8dbf227b278/master.atom')\nprint unparse(parse(feed), pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\ntag:github.com,2008:/OParl/specs/commits/master\n\n\nRecent Commits to specs:master\n2014-07-28T17:01:14+02:00\n\u2026\n    \ntag:github.com,2008:Grit::Commit/53f3af90949c69f0fd9860200077d039107ef2c2\n\noparl:Person: title: Beschreibung ge\u00e4ndert\n2014-07-12T18:11:25+02:00\n\n\nmarians\nhttps://github.com/marians\n\n<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex'>oparl:Person: title: Beschreibung ge\u00e4ndert\n\n\n\nString an erste Stelle</pre>\n\n\n        \u2026\n    \n\u2026\n\n```\nAll the <entry> - </entry> balance out correctly. I can subsequently feed the resulting XML to a XML parser and it shows no validation errors.\nCould you try to isolate this issue into a test case and submit a pull request for that instead?\n. No problem, glad you solved it!\n. @karantan this is a duplicate of #14, please have a look at that conversation for a workaround\n. That's correct @kmonsoor, xmltodict could use some help with documentation, especially about the streaming mode. \n. @arikscore Thank you for reporting this. xmltodict takes care of mapping a XML tree to a set of nested dictionaries, lists and strings. It won't deal with XMLSchema semantics, that level of abstraction is up to the user.\n. @kolis binary mode is the correct way to do this, not a workaround. The XML parser expects bytes as input and takes care of the conversion from bytes to unicode.. I didn't make the parser, can't say. Try asking in stackoverflow.com, someone out there might know.. Thank you for reporting this. It's a known issue, but still haven't figured out a practical way to solve it. Please have a look at #63.\n. No problem. Updated the description of issue #78 with the improved formatting.\n. Thanks @JKillian for the idea, it will be available in the next release.\n. Thank you for reporting this edge case, @JKillian . It's fixed in 0.9.2 which is already published in PyPI.\n. This is not a xmltodict issue. Python dictionaries raise KeyError when you try to access a nonexistent key, that's just how they work, and I don't think defaultdict will help you either.\nMaybe you could post this res['foo']['bar']['might']['exist'] example in Stackoverflow, since this is more of a general Python question, perhaps you will get more help over there. Good luck!\n. I don't see an issue here, there's nothing random about it. The following XML:\nxml\n<namespaces>\n      <namespace key=\"-2\" case=\"first-letter\">Media</namespace>\n      <namespace key=\"-1\" case=\"first-letter\">Special</namespace>\n</namespaces>\nMaps to a dict like this:\npython\n{\n    \"namespaces\": {\n        \"namespace\": [{\n            \"key\": \"-2\",\n            \"case\": \"first-letter\",\n            \"#text\": \"Media\"\n        }, {\n            \"key\": \"-1\",\n            \"case\": \"first-letter\",\n            \"#text\": \"Special\"\n        }]\n    }\n}\n. @xtiansimon The only difference between dict and OrderedDict is that the latter preserves key insertion order while the former doesn't. We can safely ignore this here.\nThere is nothing random about this behavior, it's just a duplicate of issue #14. Please have a look there to see the discussion and some possible workarounds.\n. Thank you for reporting this, @rotten \nCould you please provide a code example with expected and actual output?\n. The problem is not related with xmltodict at all, it's just that you are not building the OrderedDicts correctly.\nThe constructor takes a list of key/value tuples as parameter, but you are passing a dict instead, which has already lost the ordering information before the OrderedDict is even created. Please have a look at the official documentation.\n. No problem, @rotten , I'm glad that it finally worked for you!\n. @centralniak Thank you for reporting this. Sounds like a nice improvement to xmltodict, I would love to review and merge a pull request for this.\n. Thank you for reporting this, @kputland \nWould you mind writing a test case for this? Something with the minimal XML needed to reproduce it, the expected output and the actual output.\n. Thank you for the test case, @kputland. It seems you missed the \"minimal\" in\n\nSomething with the minimal XML needed to reproduce it, the expected output and the actual output.\n\nCould you please do that? There's a lot of info in that XML that is not necessary.\n. It's fixed now in master, @kputland . Thank you for reporting this bug, the fix will be out with the next release soon.\n. I agree it's much more pythonic. If someone figures out how to turn the SAX parser into a generator, I'd be glad to review and merge the pull request.\n. That's excellent news! I think that this can be a great contribution to xmltodict, as generators are much more pythonic than callbacks.\nCreating threads under the hood can be a very unexpected side-effect for the user, so I think we must first make sure that they will be destroyed every time they're not being used anymore, no matter how the iteration was stopped.\n. @mcrowson absolutely! If you pull the generator stuff to a standalone PR I'll take a look.. Thank you!\n. Looks good to me, thanks!\n. Wow, a Pull Request with documentation. That's not something you see very often, thank you so much!\nAbout OrderedDict, yes, it's a source of confusion. Maybe this can be fixed in a separate pull request.\n. @centralniak you can rebase now\n. I recently updated the Travis CI configuration to use the latest stable Jython release (2.7). Would you like to rebase and give it a try, @centralniak ?\n. Merged in df80377347259d434dbe3b86d3efcf27b16198ce. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. @iyn The main reason back then was to avoid introducing an extra dependency. Now that I think about it better, maybe a good compromise would be to use defusedexpat if available and fall back to regular expat if not, and raise a security warning. What do you think of this as a default?\n. @iyn I understand. Is there an open issue at defusedexpat about Python 3.4 support that we can link to? Please leave a comment if the author gets back to you.\n. Absolutely, @kmonsoor. xmltodict is certainly lacking on the documentation side and your contributions will be very welcome. I have no preference on doing it one way or another, just do it however you feel more comfortable and I'll be happy to review the Pull Requests. Thank you!\n. Sorry for the delay! Lots of useful stuff here, indeed. I really appreciate the contribution, @jonlooney !\nThere are a few of these features that I would merge right away. The problem is that it's too many things mixed in one \"super-pull request\", and there's a few things that I'm not a fan of. It would be really helpful if you could split it into one pull request per feature, so we can discuss each separately.\nSome of the things that I really like:\n- Documentation! xmltodict is lacking in this aspect, so this is really helpful. Thanks!\n- Whitespace stripping enhancement.\n- LXML ElementTree parser.\n- Forced lists. This would mitigate a very common annoyance for xmltodict users.\n- Iterators/Generators.\nSome stuff that I don't like:\n- The new_style flag. If users don't a new version's backward-incompatible changes, they should just stick to an older version.\n- Index Keys. I understand it can be useful for some use cases, but I want to keep xmltodict simple and have only one XML->dict mapping logic.\n- New Classes. This library has to map between XML and Python standard library dicts. If users need a richer model, my opinion is that they should deal with the DOM/ElementTree/etc directly. There's plenty of libraries that provide that and xmltodict isn't trying to replace them.\nAgain, @jonlooney thanks a lot for the contribution. Let me know if you would like to take the trouble to split this into separate Pull Requests. Otherwise, I can go through the diff and cherry-pick the parts that I think are ready to merge.\n. @asandvig Thank you for your contribution. Could you please re-send it in pull request form so it's easier to review?\n. @KenetJervet is right, xmltodict expects unicode strings and won't try to decode binary UTF-8 encoded data.\n. I'd be glad to review and merge a pull request if proposed.\n. Please send a pull request with your proposed changes.\n. Have you looked at pull request #120? If it doesn't cover this use case, I'll be happy to review and merge any pull request as long as:\na) It doesn't complicate the simplest use cases.\nb) It has tests and documentation.\n. The guiding principle behind the design of xmltodict is to implement one simple mapping between XML and nested dict+list+string structures resembling what you would get from a JSON document, no more, no less. I have no intention of making xmltodict a full fledged XML processing framework and I think that features like the one proposed in this ticket come at the expense of the library's ease of use and code simplicity/maintainability.\nIMHO, if you're hitting xmltodict's limitations, you should use XPath over the excellent lxml.\nOf course I could be wrong, if so please prove it with a pull request that I'll be glad to review and merge as long as the library remains easy to use, simple and maintainable.\n. @SeanHayes You can already achieve this effect using this snippet:\npython\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nxmltodict.parse(xml, dict_constructor=lambda *args, **kwargs: defaultdict(list, *args, **kwargs))\n. Please provide a test case or at least a code example to illustrate the issue.\n. Oh, sorry if I wasn't clear. I meant that it would be easier to troubleshoot if you provides snippet of Python code and an explanation of expected vs actual output. Something in the lines of:\n\nIf I run this:\npython\nxmltodict.parse('<a/>')\nI get this:\npython\n{'a': None}\nBut I think xmltodict should return this instead:\npython\n{'a': ''}\n. Duplicate of #63\n. Many thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thank you for the contribution! The change looks good to me. Do you have any benchmarks regarding the speed and memory improvements?\n. Wow, thanks for the benchmark @bharel, it's a simple change that makes a huge difference!\n. @kmonsoor There's no need for documentation, it's an internal data structure change that is completely transparent for the user. You still get a str in the end, the list is only used internally.\n. Thanks @daisieh for the contribution! xmltodict is definitely lacking on the documentation side, so this is very much appreciated.\n. Yes, there is. Just pass strip_whitespace=False to xmltodict.parse.\n. Great! Thank you for this contribution!\n. Could you please explain the purpose of this change?\n. Already implemented in #120 \n. Wow, good catch! Surprised nobody reported this before.\n. Thanks for this contribution, it looks promising! There's a couple of things that need to be fixed before merging:\n1. Tests are failing for Jython in the Travis build. I can't merge this if it breaks the build.\n2. I don't see any test cases for round-trip support. Doesn't this require any changes in unparse()?\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for this contribution! Please add some tests for this new feature.\n. Thanks again!\n. It looks like this is not an xmltodict issue. Can you provide an example of expected vs. actual output?\n. Docs is the area where this library is definitely lacking. Thank you!\n. This error is unrelated to xmltodict. The XML input is not well formed and this is making Expat fail (as it should).\n. Thank you!\n. It's not possible using attributes, but you can pass force_list=True instead.. I don't think xmltodict should go in the direction of interpreting the semantics of XML elements based on their names. This would also break the parse(unparse()) roundtrip feature.. Hi @timmwagener \nxmltodict tries to preserve order whenever possible: adds elements to lists in the order they're received from the parser and uses OrderedDict instead of plain dict if available. If you do find cases where order isn't preserved, please file them as a bug.\nThanks!. Thank you!. v0.11.0 is out: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict/0.11.0. Looks like this is covered by #131, please reopen if you still have this issue with the latest release.. Merged #150, fixed.. Looks like this was covered by #150, please reopen if you still have this issue with v0.11.0.. You can pass full_document=False to unparse so it will skip the declaration altogether. This way you can take care of the declaration however you want.. There's no need to change xmltodict to support this use case. You could do something like this:\n\npython\nsuperdict = {}\nfor filepath in filepaths:\n  superdict[filepath] = xmltodict.parse(open(filepath)). The latest version of xmltodict disables XML entities by default for security reasons (see 86c3ed6f0e6ea8bb07f98a3f0730e88c34828c84). Just pass disable_entities=False if you need this.. Sure, my bad! Happy to merge if you send a PR with the change you'd like to see in the Changelog.. This is a duplicate of #63. Duplicate of #14. Please take a look at the discussion in #14 for possible workarounds. One simple solution is to pass force_list=True.. That's simply invalid XML, xmltodict will not attempt to fix it for you. It's easy to work around, though:\n``` python\ndef rootlessparse(doc):\n    return xmltodict.parse('{0}'.format(doc))['root']\nrootlessparse('''\n0\n1\n''') # this returns {u'test': u'0', u'another': u'1'}\n```\n. that's invalid xml, any sane xml parser should fail with it. you should escape your strings.\n``` python\n\n\n\nxmltodict.parse('&')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  ...\nxml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: not well-formed (invalid token): line 1, column 4\nxmltodict.parse('&')\n{u'x': u'&'}\n``\n.xmltodictis based on the built-inxml.parsers.expatmodule. There's no way that I know of to stopexpatfrom parsing a subtree and treat it as CDATA instead, but you could investigate further and come back with a pull request ;)\n. @slestak It's not a perfect solution for this scenario, as it would imply an unwanted and in some cases lossy XML->dict->XML transformation.\nIt is, however, a good idea for a useful general-purpose feature. I have forked this into a new issue [here](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/issues/6) and will work on it.\n. fixed in release v0.3\n. With streaming mode, you can return a false-ish value from your callback function to stop parsing. If this doesn't solve your issue, can you provide a concrete example?\n. I get it. In this case, you should use apostprocessor, not the streaming mode.\nThe postprocessing function gets three arguments in (path,keyandvalue) and must return a(key, value)tuple orNone` to skip the node altogether.\n\n\n\nIf you want to skip odd <item>s, you should do something like this:\n``` python\nxml = '''\n\nItem1\nItem2\nItem3\nItem4\n'''\nclass SkipOddValues:\n    def init(self, key):\n        self.key = key\n        self.count = 0\ndef __call__(self, path, key, value):\n    if key != self.key:\n        return key, value\n    self.count += 1\n    if self.count % 2 == 1:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return key, value\n\ndoc = xmltodict.parse(xml, postprocessor=SkipOddValues('item'))\n``\n. Welcome!\n. I'm not sure I understand. Can you explain a bit further, with a code example if possible?\n. Got it! It does sound like a nice to have a feature. I'll give it a look.\n. Something like that?\n. Welcome! It's out in v0.4.\n.cdata_separator='\\n'should do (no need toforce_cdata`)\n. @dubanoze describe issue not\n. That's great news!\nThe patch looks good to me, I will ship it with 0.4.2.\nThanks!\n. Done: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict/0.4.2\n. I would, because I'm a human being and I know children is the plural form of child. The only thing xmltodict knows, though, is that it has only found one value for the child node (same way as with root, children and name), so there's no need for iterable objects there.\nYou can easily work around this by using a custom dict_constructor that always starts off with empty lists as values, i.e.:\npython\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nxmltodict.parse(xml, dict_constructor=lambda *args, **kwargs: defaultdict(list, *args, **kwargs))\n. @foxx I understand it can be annoying, but I think the other option is even worse. For example, with this XML:\nxml\n<config>\n  <settings>\n    <value1>0</value1>\n    <value2>false</value2>\n  </settings>\n  <logging>\n    <value3>1</value3>\n    <value4>true</value4>\n  </logging>\n</config>\nI would expect a dict like this:\npython\n{\n    \"config\": {\n        \"settings\": {\n            \"value1\": \"0\",\n            \"value2\": \"false\"\n        },\n        \"logging\": {\n            \"value3\": \"1\",\n            \"value4\": \"true\"\n        },\n    }\n}\nBut with your proposal I would get this instead:\npython\n{\n    \"config\": [{\n        \"settings\": [{\n            \"value1\": [\"0\"],\n            \"value2\": [\"false\"]\n        }],\n        \"logging\": [{\n            \"value3\": [\"1\"],\n            \"value4\": [\"true\"]\n        }],\n    }]\n}\nIn order to access the configuration values, you would have to use d['config'][0]['settings'][0]['value1'][0] instead of d['config']['settings']['value1']. Other users might think this is surprising behavior too, so I believe which option is better depends on the use case.\nAlso, the Python standard library doesn't have a DefaultDict that is also an OrderedDict. If I followed your suggestion and used DefaultDict in the next release, xmltodict would lose the elements' ordering information, which could also be surprising for some use cases (and break code that depends on this).\n. The best we can do about this is improve the documentation, I think. @foxx, what would you add to the README to make this behavior less surprising?\n. @kadnan @candlerb this feature is already out in the 0.10.1 release. Which version are you running on? I just did a fresh install and it worked fine:\n``` sh\n$ pip install xmltodict\nCollecting xmltodict\n  Downloading xmltodict-0.10.1.tar.gz\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: xmltodict\n  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for xmltodict ... done\n  Stored in directory: /Users/martinblech/Library/Caches/pip/wheels/06/23/c0/b5e91910dc6261d118f437bc4c487972e3b00147e09372f8bc\nSuccessfully built xmltodict\nInstalling collected packages: xmltodict\nSuccessfully installed xmltodict-0.10.1\n$ python\nPython 2.7.11 (default, Feb 22 2016, 19:49:39)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n\n\nimport xmltodict\nxml = '''\n... \n...   .1.\n...   .2.\n...   .3.\n...   .4.\n...   .5.\n... \n...

No problem, glad it worked in the end.\n. You can use a postprocessor for that:\n\n\n\n``` python\ndef postprocessor(path, key, value):\n    try:\n        value = value.strip()\n        if not value:\n            return None\n    except:\n        pass\n    return key, value\no = xmltodict.parse( infile.read() , postprocessor=postprocessor);\njson.dump( o , outfile, indent=2 )\n```\nand get this out:\njavascript\n\"Service\": {\n  \"kind\": \"1\"\n}\nHowever, this should be the default behavior. Use this as a workaround while I fix this for a new release. Thanks!\n. fixed with this commit by @slestak https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/commit/2c2b4601e640481bd0ea5c3bf0c22d883eca47e5\n. what's up with the unit tests?\n. I see the test is failing because your expected dict doesn't have a 'emptya' key. We don't want to completely lose that node, but check that it's value is None (as if all that whitespace wasn't there).\n. Looks good now!\n. Unicode support can be quite difficult to achieve on both python 2 and 3 with the same codebase. I will look into this.\n. Fixed with commit 75f885bfc81a7d95e885e81e94330ff9827b6e6f\n. That's correct, unparse() is officially done but still undocumented. Thanks for pointing it out!\nAre you using it? Can you try to come up with a small example for the README?\n. Now there's an example in README.md, but I'm leaving this issue open until I find the time to write the docstring.\n. Looks great. Thank you a lot for the contribution!\n. @LORDofDOOM It's breaking the Travis build. Have you investigated why? https://travis-ci.org/martinblech/xmltodict/builds/6913744\n. Conversions like this don't belong in the core library, as xmltodict should not be tied to specific types of XML. The recommended way of doing this is using a postprocessor. Thanks for the input!\n. You are welcome!\n. I will definitely consider it for the next release. Thank you for your input!\n. You can start using it in v0.5.0, just released. xmltodict still defaults to the built-in expat, but you can pass defusedexpat.pyexpat instead using the expat parameter, just look at parse()'s docstring.\n. I like the idea: pretty-printing is surely a useful feature. However, I'm not sure I like the approach. You are extending XMLGenerator but then completely overriding the core startElement(), endElement() and characters() methods. I would bet there are corner cases that the new implementation doesn't cover but XMLGenerator does.\nI think the right, robust way to do this is by leaving XMLGenerator untouched and modifying our own _emit function to pass a depth parameter to itself and call content_handler.ignorableWhitespace() appropriately.\nI will close this pull request but keep this issue open. Thank you for opening up the discussion!\n. @ahalbert I'm just pinging you to let you know I finally got around to implementing pretty print in unparse(), in case you would like to start using it. Cheers!\n. > I think the right, robust way to do this is by leaving XMLGenerator untouched and modifying our own _emit function to pass a depth parameter to itself and call content_handler.ignorableWhitespace() appropriately.\n. I'm glad you found it useful. The KeyError means the article dict doesn't have a 'title' key. Have you tried debugging your script? What keys does the article dict have? Sometimes a few prints can help a lot!\n. You should at least print the exception stack trace, error alone doesn't say much. You could also print the whole untouched page object to see exactly what your callback function is being called with.\n. You should the json module to turn it into JSON, e.g.:\n``` python\n\nimport xmltodict\n\n\nfoo = xmltodict.parse(\"\"\"<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n...         \n...           john\n...           20\n...         \"\"\")\nprint json.dumps(foo)\n{\"person\": {\"name\": \"john\", \"age\": \"20\"}}\n```\n\n\n\nOrderedDict is just a dict that preserves key order (makes sure that if you round-trip that object to XML, name will always come before age).\n. Looks like a reasonable fallback. Thanks for the contribution!\n. I certainly didn't start the project with namespaces in mind, as you probably guessed from their complete absence in the examples and tests.\nYour use case doesn't seem very complicated. I will have a look at it and see how much pyexpat can help me in this direction. I would love to add this feature if it doesn't bloat xmltodict for the simplest use cases.\nThanks for your input!\n. @tomstrummer\nWhat's exactly the role of the namespaces dict argument in your example? I see that it has entries for one='http://one.com' and two='http://two.com', but three is missing, but as far as I can see, one, two and three are treated equally in your example's output.\nWhat difference does it make for a namespace to be present or missing in namespaces?\n. @tomstrummer Ok, it should have been there. But what if it wasn't? What would be a reasonable default behavior for xmltodict in case it bumps into a namespace that is not among the values of the namespaces dict? Should it raise an exception?\nI'm just trying to figure out what's the purpose of the namespaces dict in your example.\n. Fixed with release 0.7.0\n. Looks good to me. Thanks for the contribution!\n. This is a duplicate of #14. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for xmltodict to know beforehand which elements are supposed to be lists and which are supposed to be single elements. I can think of 2 workarounds for this:\n- The dict_constructor approach I described in #14, in which case all values will be lists (doc['root'][0]['abc'][1]['tr'] == ['four']).\n- Writing your own postprocessor that cherry picks the values that should be converted to lists in your particular type of document.\n. @tomstrummer will something like this do?\n. You should return True from your callback function, e.g.:\npython\ndef handle_artist(_, artist):\n    print artist['name']\n    return True\nReturning a falsy value (such as None in your case) makes xmltodict stop parsing and raise a ParsingInterrupted exception.\n. But then I realise the example in the README is wrong. Good find, thanks!\n. @AlexMikhalev did it work for you after adding return True?\n. Thank you for the contribution, but I think you can already achieve this by passing jsobject or AttrDict as dict_constructor to parse().\nThis functionality is not core to xmltodict, and since you can already get it with help from another module that's available on PyPI, I don't think it's necessary to merge these changes.\n. I meant passing it as dict_constructor to parse(), overriding the default (OrderedDict), e.g.:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxd.parse(x, dict_constructor=jo.JSObject)\n```\n\n\n\nDoesn't this work for you?\n. @rjbez17 Doing it this way also more efficient, as xmltodcit creates JsObjects right away, instead of creating regular dicts and throwing them away after converting them to XMLObjects in the end. Also, it's less code to maintain!\nI would be happy to merge a pull request documenting this in the README, though... :wink: :wink:\n. I don't see the issue here. If you want to compare two documents, it doesn't make a difference at all whether you use OrderedDict or a regular dict:\n``` python\n\n\n\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nOrderedDict([('a', 'b')]) == {'a': 'b'}\nTrue\n```\n\n\n\nHowever, if you don't want to use OrderedDicts at all and just want to use regular dicts all over, it's easy to override the default behavior using the dict_constructor parameter:\n``` python\n\n\n\nimport xmltodict\nxmltodict.parse('b', dict_constructor=dict)\n{u'a': u'b'}\n``\n. Thanks @qixiuying for reporting this! @alesdotio You are right, I have to includedistribute_setup.py` in the package.\n\n\n\nI just removed this buggy release and reverted to v0.7.0 until I get the time to fix it.\n. Fixed with release 0.8.1\n. I've just upgraded xmltodict to the latest version of setuptools. Can you try pip install xmltodict==0.8.2 and see if it works now?\n. Can you try 0.8.3 now? It now tries to use your system's setuptools if available before attempting to install 1.1.6. It worked for me locally.\n. welcome! thanks for reporting this!\n. It's not incorrect, it's just one of the possible ways of handling lists. What matters is that unparse() is consistent with parse() and roundtrips correctly.\nI understand that this way of handling lists can be annoying for your use case, but if I changed xmltodict to your convenience I still wouldn't be able to make everyone happy. If this:\npython\n{\n  'response': {\n    'versions': [\n      {'version': 1},\n      {'version': 2}\n    ]\n  }\n}\nunperses to:\nxml\n<response>\n  <versions>\n    <version>1</version>\n    <version>2</version>\n  </versions>\n</response>\nThen it means that this:\nxml\n<settings>\n  <bind>localhost</bind>\n  <bind>192.168.1.1</bind>\n  <port>8080</port>\n</settings>\nhas to parse to:\npython\n{\n  'settings': [\n    {'bind': 'localhost'},\n    {'bind': '192.168.1.1'},\n    {'port': '8080'}\n  ]\n}\nWhich would be a pain to use, compared with this, which is the current behavior:\npython\n{\n  'settings': {\n    'bind': ['localhost', '192.168.1.1'],\n    'port': '8080'\n  }\n}\n. That's what the strip_whitespace argument is for: deciding whether to strip whitespace or not. It defaults to True, but if you pass False you get what you're looking for:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxml = '''<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n... \n...     \n...         SEPARATOR\n...          \n...     \n... \n... '''\ndoc = xmltodict.parse(xml, strip_whitespace=False)\ndoc['service']['key']['value']\nu'\\t'\n``\n. @chrismatta @grzn @lovato thanks for your input. This issue should have been fixed with release 0.8.4. Could you please verify this is so from your side? Thanks!\n. @neildd looks good, thanks! The only thing missing is a python 2.4 line in.travis.yml`. Can you do that?\n. @twcook I'm unable to reproduce this error. What platform did this happen on? Were you using virtualenv?\n. I setup a clean Ubuntu 12.10 virtual machine, but I still cannot reproduce the error, xmltodict installs just fine.\n\n\n\n@twcook I could try again, but I need step by step instructions to reproduce it in a local environment.\n. The proposed change breaks a large number of test cases: https://travis-ci.org/martinblech/xmltodict/builds/15720916\nCould you clarify the issue a bit further and provide a code example?\n. @dada2801 beginning with 0.8.5, xmltodict is letting the expat XML parser take care of choosing the correct encoding.\n. That's sounds like a nice feature, thanks. I will give it some thought as of how to implement it.\n. @megahall I think it's not a bug: you cannot have a XML document with more than one root node. You should wrap that dict inside another dict with a single key:\npython\n{\n    \"root\": {\n        \"@name\": \"dbl-test\",\n        \"description\": \"dbl-test\",\n        \"recurring\": {\n            \"hourly\": {\n                \"at\": \"00\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"type\": \"ip\",\n        \"url\": \"http://192.168.1.6:8080/pa-dbl.txt\"\n    }\n}\nOtherwise, what XML opening tag should the @name attribute belong to?\n. That's awesome, thank you for this contribution!\n. @skela You should leave out <![CDATA[\u2026]]> from your val. xmltodict will take care of the escaping/unescaping for you, so you shouldn't attempt to introduce XML escaping characters into the values. The right thing to do is just have val = '<a href=\"http://www.space.com\">Hi my name is Bob</a>'.\n. It's just not possible to do this with xmltodict, it's not what the library is intended for.\n. @walko1234 there's no builtin solution, but you could use some DefaultOrderedDict recipe such as this.\n. @fyears Thank you for your input. You can already do this if you pass dict_constructor=dict to the parse() function, as in #39.\n. Yes, I'm afraid it's kinda hidden. I could definitely use some help with\nthe documentation!\nOn Apr 15, 2014 11:40 PM, \"fyears\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWow! There's a hidden feature! I should have a good look at the source\ncode first!\nThank you. :-)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/issues/59#issuecomment-40557514\n.\n. @fyears I appreciate your contribution, but do not think it belongs as part of the library.\n\nxmltodict aims at doing just one thing and doing it well: it turns a valid XML document into a dict and vice versa. Even though it might be useful in your own particular scenario, the raw_text() function produces invalid XML.\n. @sbadia Sure, no problem! It's done: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict/0.9.0\n. @sbadia Are you going to create/maintain an official Debian package for xmltodict? Or is this just for a private .deb?\n. @sbadia awesome, thanks!\n. thanks @sbadia !\n. @dgonyier I don't have a Windows box at reach at the moment, so I cannot reproduce it. It's great that you figured this out on your own, this thread can now be used as reference in case someone googles for this error.\n. @BlackMan82 You are right, it seems that xmltodict does not follow the spec for semi-structured XML nodes.\nWe should detect such cases and have xmltodict behave as specified, it would make much more sense:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxmltodict.parse('sometextualcontent')\n{'e': 'sometextualcontent'}\n```\n\n\n\nI'm still wondering what to do with unparse in this case, though. If I leave it as it is, it would escape <s and >s, something we don't want:\n``` python\n\n\n\nxmltodict.unparse({'e': 'sometextualcontent'}, full_document=False)\n'some<a>textual</a>content'\n```\n. @joohoi Not much, sorry!\n\n\n\nSince xmltodict uses SAX, not DOM, by the time it's able to detect semi-structured XML, it's already too late to process it differently. It would have to backtrack and unparse what has been parsed so far, or else switch to DOM, which would mean rewriting the whole library from scratch.\nPerhaps I'm missing some other alternative, so I'm definitely open to reading proposals or looking at pull requests.\n. While I do appreciate it and thank you for taking the time to write this long proposal, I do not see something like this happening to xmltodict.\nxmltodict aims to be a very simple library that implements just one of the many possible ways one can map XML to and from JSON-like structures. This particular mapping works fine for some simple use cases, but unfortunately it does not for other more complex ones, such as the ones you mention. It does not feature type coercion, meta processing directives nor attribute sniffing. This is by design.\nI do understand that your proposed features must make a lot of sense in your context, so I would like to encourage you to either:\n- Implement all this and submit a Pull Request, so I can review the impact of this added complexity on code maintainability, backwards compatibility and usefulness for the originally intended, simple scenarios. I promise to reconsider my position once I see the implementation and tests.\n- Fork xmltodict and build your own XML processing library on top of it.\n. That's great, thank you for this PR. The only thing missing would be a new entry in the matrix/exclude section to avoid running the tests twice on jython.\nyaml\n matrix:\n    exclude:\n      - python: \"2.6\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n      - python: \"2.7\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n      - python: \"3.2\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n      - python: \"3.3\"\n        env: JYTHON=true\n+       - python: \"3.4\"\n+         env: JYTHON=true\n. Perfect! Thanks, @frewsxcv \n. @taylormattison Thank you for reporting this. It was actually a problem with the README: it was missing the process_namespaces=True parameter.\n. @ZoomQuiet Please have a look at #14 for a workaround.\n. @CamyDee Looking forward to see some progress with your fork!\n. I'm sorry, the streaming mode is a bit lacking on the documentation side. Fortunately, the attributes are not lost but passed to the callback as the path argument, e.g.:\n``` python\ndef cb(path, item):\n    print path, item\n    return True\nxmltodict.parse(open(xmlfile), item_depth=2, item_callback=cb)\n[(u'items', None), (u'item', OrderedDict([(u'attr', u'hello')]))] OrderedDict([(u'inner', u'value'), (u'inner2', u'value2')])\n```\n. @pySilver I guess the workaround does work for your use case, but I'm not sure this is would be the correct thing to do. If a l list with N items produces N XML nodes, the logical conclusion should be that a list with 0 items must produce no XML nodes at all, not one empty node:\n``` python\n\n\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': [1, 2, 3]}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': [1, 2]}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n1\n2\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': [1]}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n1\n\nprint unparse({'a': {'b': []}}, pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n\n```\n. @pySilver I understand, in some use cases (such as yours) it makes more sense to do it that way. I just think that it's not right to force that behavior on all the other users, it's less logical and might not be what they want.\n. @Telofy thank you for reporting this issue, but I am unable to reproduce it locally. Here's the whole interactive Python session:\n\n\n\n``` python\n\n\n\nfrom urllib2 import urlopen\nfrom xmltodict import parse, unparse\nfeed = urlopen('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Telofy/241ca0d28edaef732153/raw/70b9228ee374a285397319ce97b0d8dbf227b278/master.atom')\nprint unparse(parse(feed), pretty=True)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\ntag:github.com,2008:/OParl/specs/commits/master\n\n\nRecent Commits to specs:master\n2014-07-28T17:01:14+02:00\n\u2026\n    \ntag:github.com,2008:Grit::Commit/53f3af90949c69f0fd9860200077d039107ef2c2\n\noparl:Person: title: Beschreibung ge\u00e4ndert\n2014-07-12T18:11:25+02:00\n\n\nmarians\nhttps://github.com/marians\n\n<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex'>oparl:Person: title: Beschreibung ge\u00e4ndert\n\n\n\nString an erste Stelle</pre>\n\n\n        \u2026\n    \n\u2026\n\n```\nAll the <entry> - </entry> balance out correctly. I can subsequently feed the resulting XML to a XML parser and it shows no validation errors.\nCould you try to isolate this issue into a test case and submit a pull request for that instead?\n. No problem, glad you solved it!\n. @karantan this is a duplicate of #14, please have a look at that conversation for a workaround\n. That's correct @kmonsoor, xmltodict could use some help with documentation, especially about the streaming mode. \n. @arikscore Thank you for reporting this. xmltodict takes care of mapping a XML tree to a set of nested dictionaries, lists and strings. It won't deal with XMLSchema semantics, that level of abstraction is up to the user.\n. @kolis binary mode is the correct way to do this, not a workaround. The XML parser expects bytes as input and takes care of the conversion from bytes to unicode.. I didn't make the parser, can't say. Try asking in stackoverflow.com, someone out there might know.. Thank you for reporting this. It's a known issue, but still haven't figured out a practical way to solve it. Please have a look at #63.\n. No problem. Updated the description of issue #78 with the improved formatting.\n. Thanks @JKillian for the idea, it will be available in the next release.\n. Thank you for reporting this edge case, @JKillian . It's fixed in 0.9.2 which is already published in PyPI.\n. This is not a xmltodict issue. Python dictionaries raise KeyError when you try to access a nonexistent key, that's just how they work, and I don't think defaultdict will help you either.\nMaybe you could post this res['foo']['bar']['might']['exist'] example in Stackoverflow, since this is more of a general Python question, perhaps you will get more help over there. Good luck!\n. I don't see an issue here, there's nothing random about it. The following XML:\nxml\n<namespaces>\n      <namespace key=\"-2\" case=\"first-letter\">Media</namespace>\n      <namespace key=\"-1\" case=\"first-letter\">Special</namespace>\n</namespaces>\nMaps to a dict like this:\npython\n{\n    \"namespaces\": {\n        \"namespace\": [{\n            \"key\": \"-2\",\n            \"case\": \"first-letter\",\n            \"#text\": \"Media\"\n        }, {\n            \"key\": \"-1\",\n            \"case\": \"first-letter\",\n            \"#text\": \"Special\"\n        }]\n    }\n}\n. @xtiansimon The only difference between dict and OrderedDict is that the latter preserves key insertion order while the former doesn't. We can safely ignore this here.\nThere is nothing random about this behavior, it's just a duplicate of issue #14. Please have a look there to see the discussion and some possible workarounds.\n. Thank you for reporting this, @rotten \nCould you please provide a code example with expected and actual output?\n. The problem is not related with xmltodict at all, it's just that you are not building the OrderedDicts correctly.\nThe constructor takes a list of key/value tuples as parameter, but you are passing a dict instead, which has already lost the ordering information before the OrderedDict is even created. Please have a look at the official documentation.\n. No problem, @rotten , I'm glad that it finally worked for you!\n. @centralniak Thank you for reporting this. Sounds like a nice improvement to xmltodict, I would love to review and merge a pull request for this.\n. Thank you for reporting this, @kputland \nWould you mind writing a test case for this? Something with the minimal XML needed to reproduce it, the expected output and the actual output.\n. Thank you for the test case, @kputland. It seems you missed the \"minimal\" in\n\nSomething with the minimal XML needed to reproduce it, the expected output and the actual output.\n\nCould you please do that? There's a lot of info in that XML that is not necessary.\n. It's fixed now in master, @kputland . Thank you for reporting this bug, the fix will be out with the next release soon.\n. I agree it's much more pythonic. If someone figures out how to turn the SAX parser into a generator, I'd be glad to review and merge the pull request.\n. That's excellent news! I think that this can be a great contribution to xmltodict, as generators are much more pythonic than callbacks.\nCreating threads under the hood can be a very unexpected side-effect for the user, so I think we must first make sure that they will be destroyed every time they're not being used anymore, no matter how the iteration was stopped.\n. @mcrowson absolutely! If you pull the generator stuff to a standalone PR I'll take a look.. Thank you!\n. Looks good to me, thanks!\n. Wow, a Pull Request with documentation. That's not something you see very often, thank you so much!\nAbout OrderedDict, yes, it's a source of confusion. Maybe this can be fixed in a separate pull request.\n. @centralniak you can rebase now\n. I recently updated the Travis CI configuration to use the latest stable Jython release (2.7). Would you like to rebase and give it a try, @centralniak ?\n. Merged in df80377347259d434dbe3b86d3efcf27b16198ce. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. @iyn The main reason back then was to avoid introducing an extra dependency. Now that I think about it better, maybe a good compromise would be to use defusedexpat if available and fall back to regular expat if not, and raise a security warning. What do you think of this as a default?\n. @iyn I understand. Is there an open issue at defusedexpat about Python 3.4 support that we can link to? Please leave a comment if the author gets back to you.\n. Absolutely, @kmonsoor. xmltodict is certainly lacking on the documentation side and your contributions will be very welcome. I have no preference on doing it one way or another, just do it however you feel more comfortable and I'll be happy to review the Pull Requests. Thank you!\n. Sorry for the delay! Lots of useful stuff here, indeed. I really appreciate the contribution, @jonlooney !\nThere are a few of these features that I would merge right away. The problem is that it's too many things mixed in one \"super-pull request\", and there's a few things that I'm not a fan of. It would be really helpful if you could split it into one pull request per feature, so we can discuss each separately.\nSome of the things that I really like:\n- Documentation! xmltodict is lacking in this aspect, so this is really helpful. Thanks!\n- Whitespace stripping enhancement.\n- LXML ElementTree parser.\n- Forced lists. This would mitigate a very common annoyance for xmltodict users.\n- Iterators/Generators.\nSome stuff that I don't like:\n- The new_style flag. If users don't a new version's backward-incompatible changes, they should just stick to an older version.\n- Index Keys. I understand it can be useful for some use cases, but I want to keep xmltodict simple and have only one XML->dict mapping logic.\n- New Classes. This library has to map between XML and Python standard library dicts. If users need a richer model, my opinion is that they should deal with the DOM/ElementTree/etc directly. There's plenty of libraries that provide that and xmltodict isn't trying to replace them.\nAgain, @jonlooney thanks a lot for the contribution. Let me know if you would like to take the trouble to split this into separate Pull Requests. Otherwise, I can go through the diff and cherry-pick the parts that I think are ready to merge.\n. @asandvig Thank you for your contribution. Could you please re-send it in pull request form so it's easier to review?\n. @KenetJervet is right, xmltodict expects unicode strings and won't try to decode binary UTF-8 encoded data.\n. I'd be glad to review and merge a pull request if proposed.\n. Please send a pull request with your proposed changes.\n. Have you looked at pull request #120? If it doesn't cover this use case, I'll be happy to review and merge any pull request as long as:\na) It doesn't complicate the simplest use cases.\nb) It has tests and documentation.\n. The guiding principle behind the design of xmltodict is to implement one simple mapping between XML and nested dict+list+string structures resembling what you would get from a JSON document, no more, no less. I have no intention of making xmltodict a full fledged XML processing framework and I think that features like the one proposed in this ticket come at the expense of the library's ease of use and code simplicity/maintainability.\nIMHO, if you're hitting xmltodict's limitations, you should use XPath over the excellent lxml.\nOf course I could be wrong, if so please prove it with a pull request that I'll be glad to review and merge as long as the library remains easy to use, simple and maintainable.\n. @SeanHayes You can already achieve this effect using this snippet:\npython\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nxmltodict.parse(xml, dict_constructor=lambda *args, **kwargs: defaultdict(list, *args, **kwargs))\n. Please provide a test case or at least a code example to illustrate the issue.\n. Oh, sorry if I wasn't clear. I meant that it would be easier to troubleshoot if you provides snippet of Python code and an explanation of expected vs actual output. Something in the lines of:\n\nIf I run this:\npython\nxmltodict.parse('<a/>')\nI get this:\npython\n{'a': None}\nBut I think xmltodict should return this instead:\npython\n{'a': ''}\n. Duplicate of #63\n. Many thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thank you for the contribution! The change looks good to me. Do you have any benchmarks regarding the speed and memory improvements?\n. Wow, thanks for the benchmark @bharel, it's a simple change that makes a huge difference!\n. @kmonsoor There's no need for documentation, it's an internal data structure change that is completely transparent for the user. You still get a str in the end, the list is only used internally.\n. Thanks @daisieh for the contribution! xmltodict is definitely lacking on the documentation side, so this is very much appreciated.\n. Yes, there is. Just pass strip_whitespace=False to xmltodict.parse.\n. Great! Thank you for this contribution!\n. Could you please explain the purpose of this change?\n. Already implemented in #120 \n. Wow, good catch! Surprised nobody reported this before.\n. Thanks for this contribution, it looks promising! There's a couple of things that need to be fixed before merging:\n1. Tests are failing for Jython in the Travis build. I can't merge this if it breaks the build.\n2. I don't see any test cases for round-trip support. Doesn't this require any changes in unparse()?\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for this contribution! Please add some tests for this new feature.\n. Thanks again!\n. It looks like this is not an xmltodict issue. Can you provide an example of expected vs. actual output?\n. Docs is the area where this library is definitely lacking. Thank you!\n. This error is unrelated to xmltodict. The XML input is not well formed and this is making Expat fail (as it should).\n. Thank you!\n. It's not possible using attributes, but you can pass force_list=True instead.. I don't think xmltodict should go in the direction of interpreting the semantics of XML elements based on their names. This would also break the parse(unparse()) roundtrip feature.. Hi @timmwagener \nxmltodict tries to preserve order whenever possible: adds elements to lists in the order they're received from the parser and uses OrderedDict instead of plain dict if available. If you do find cases where order isn't preserved, please file them as a bug.\nThanks!. Thank you!. v0.11.0 is out: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict/0.11.0. Looks like this is covered by #131, please reopen if you still have this issue with the latest release.. Merged #150, fixed.. Looks like this was covered by #150, please reopen if you still have this issue with v0.11.0.. You can pass full_document=False to unparse so it will skip the declaration altogether. This way you can take care of the declaration however you want.. There's no need to change xmltodict to support this use case. You could do something like this:\n\npython\nsuperdict = {}\nfor filepath in filepaths:\n  superdict[filepath] = xmltodict.parse(open(filepath)). The latest version of xmltodict disables XML entities by default for security reasons (see 86c3ed6f0e6ea8bb07f98a3f0730e88c34828c84). Just pass disable_entities=False if you need this.. Sure, my bad! Happy to merge if you send a PR with the change you'd like to see in the Changelog.. This is a duplicate of #63. Duplicate of #14. Please take a look at the discussion in #14 for possible workarounds. One simple solution is to pass force_list=True.. ",

I understand now that xmltodict notion of cdata is different from XML's notion of CDATA.

FWIW, I was able to accomplish what I needed with this change:\n*** xmltodict.py.orig   2016-03-28 13:37:00.098508399 -0500\n--- xmltodict.py        2016-03-28 16:11:52.053726618 -0500\n\n* 362,368 **\n--- 362,371 ----\n                    attr_prefix, cdata_key, depth+1, preprocessor,\n                    pretty, newl, indent)\n          if cdata is not None:\n-             # Output the CDATA start/end tags explicity\n-             content_handler._write(r\"<![CDATA[\")\n            content_handler.characters(cdata)\n-             content_handler._write(r\"]]>\")\n        if pretty and children:\n            content_handler.ignorableWhitespace(depth * indent)\n        content_handler.endElement(key)\n. I understand now that xmltodict notion of cdata is different from XML's notion of CDATA. The above hack simply does not work because any and all character data gets encapsulated by XML's CDATA strings.\nThe solution I found is to do the following:\n- Encapsulate any user CDATA with the XML CDATA strings.\n- Use xmltodict.unparse() to write the data to a string\n- Use xml.sax.saxutils.unescape() to reconvert the entity references back.\nThanks again for writing this library module as I find it very useful.\n.

    "bzamecnik": "+1 for this problem.\nI've came across using the results of streaming parse() in a generator. In my case I'd like to feed it into unparse() and transform one XML to another in a streaming way.\nFeeding unparse() with lazy-generated input should be solved in pull request #92 (to issue #91). What remains is connecting parse() callback to an unparse() generator. I've tried to use a single-element coroutine-based queue (asyncio.Queue) for this purpose. My code is not complete yet, but I have a working prototype of the queue usage on a simple producer-consumer problem. I hope to integrate it with xmltodict in a similar way to sirex@2c8002a, without the need to use threads.\n. So I delved deeper into asyncio, coroutines, generators with the goal to turn callbacks into generators and unfortunately without success. The problem is that on one end I need a generator (pulling data from the source) and on the other end I have a coroutine (pushing data from the source). I need to use asyncio event loop to start both the producer and consumer but it doesn't allow me to use a for loop for driving the computation. In order to synchronize both I tried to use a Queue but the problem is then that putting into the queue is a coroutine and it has to be wrapped into a task, which gets executed later in the loop, thus the computation is not lazy at all. What I'd like is that putting an item into the queue in the callback blocks and switches the execution to the consumer.\nAfter many tries I've created a thread on stackoverflow, so possibly someone more experienced might help us: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29724273/transform-callbacks-to-generator-in-python\n. At least I tried to get the code with threads working. After a lot of fiddling with the producer-consumer pattern it works. The producer can be notified when the generator was closed and finish the thread. So it is possible to break from within the for loop and the producer thread finishes correctly. The trick to coordinate the consumer and producer is to use two singleton queues (one for requests and the other for responses).\nA generator can either finish correctly or be closed. Eg. when break occurs before the generator completes. In this case we can signal to the producer, that it should finish. The failing test case was a bit strange usage since since it neither completely iterated the generator not closed it. It would correspond to a situation when processing one item hangs. A possible behavior is to finish the producer thread after some time of consumer inactivity.\nThe new code seems to work ok. I'll try to clean it up a bit and commit it tomorrow.\n. So I commited the code I have. It seems to work in all Python envs defined in tox. https://github.com/bzamecnik/xmltodict/tree/%2388-streaming-parse-with-generator\nI'm afraid if we'd like to get rid of the thread and use asyncio it couldn't be used from 2.x Python versions.\n. @sirex The timeout is configurable, so you can increase it as a user if you expect processing items would take long. But anyway, the important point is that the proper usage of a generator is either to fully consume it or close it. If the user do not close the generator, it is wrong and the user cannot be surprised that some resource might get leaked. Your suggestion with automatically cleaning up the resource after usage seems to be a promising way. Since we're using some resource in the generator a proper pattern might be to wrap the whole generator usage into a with statement which would take care of resource allocation and closing (just an idea). I'm not a Python expert but I'd be worried that the destructor doesn't get called or gets called too late (compared to 'with') and also the 'with' statement clearly indicates that there's a kind of resource allocation inside. This way we could elimitate completely the hack with the timeout.\npython\nwith xmltodict.parse(data, item_depth=2) as gen:\n    for _, item in gen:\n        process_item(item)  # takes 2 seconds to process\nBtw: it seems that the timeout doesn't work on pypy. https://travis-ci.org/martinblech/xmltodict/builds/59315990\n. Hi @kmonsoor, this approach seems interesting, I should try it as well. As for that debug message, it must have been from some old commit. Please have a look at the fixed code (in the #99 pull request from the #88-streaming-parse-with-generator branch). The usage would be like:\n``` python\n\n\n\nwith xmltodict.parse(file_path, item_depth=2) as gen:\n...     for path, item in gen:\n...         print(path, item) # do whatever...\n```\n. +1 for this problem.\n\n\n\nI've came across using the results of streaming parse() in a generator.

The failing test case was a bit strange usage since since it neither completely iterated the generator not closed it. It would correspond to a situation when processing one item hangs. A possible behavior is to finish the producer thread after some time of consumer inactivity.\nThe new code seems to work ok. I'll try to clean it up a bit and commit it tomorrow.\n. So I commited the code I have. It seems to work in all Python envs defined in tox. https://github.com/bzamecnik/xmltodict/tree/%2388-streaming-parse-with-generator\nI'm afraid if we'd like to get rid of the thread and use asyncio it couldn't be used from 2.x Python versions.\n. @sirex The timeout is configurable, so you can increase it as a user if you expect processing items would take long. But anyway, the important point is that the proper usage of a generator is either to fully consume it or close it. If the user do not close the generator, it is wrong and the user cannot be surprised that some resource might get leaked. Your suggestion with automatically cleaning up the resource after usage seems to be a promising way. Since we're using some resource in the generator a proper pattern might be to wrap the whole generator usage into a with statement which would take care of resource allocation and closing (just an idea). I'm not a Python expert but I'd be worried that the destructor doesn't get called or gets called too late (compared to 'with') and also the 'with' statement clearly indicates that there's a kind of resource allocation inside. This way we could elimitate completely the hack with the timeout.\npython\nwith xmltodict.parse(data, item_depth=2) as gen:\n    for _, item in gen:\n        process_item(item)  # takes 2 seconds to process\nBtw: it seems that the timeout doesn't work on pypy. https://travis-ci.org/martinblech/xmltodict/builds/59315990\n. Hi @kmonsoor, this approach seems interesting, I should try it as well. As for that debug message, it must have been from some old commit. Please have a look at the fixed code (in the #99 pull request from the #88-streaming-parse-with-generator branch). The usage would be like:\n``` python\n\n\n\nwith xmltodict.parse(file_path, item_depth=2) as gen:\n...     for path, item in gen:\n...         print(path, item) # do whatever...\n```\n. \n\n\n",
