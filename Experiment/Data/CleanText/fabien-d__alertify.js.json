    "fabien-d": "Thanks for submitting the issue. Fixed with ^ pull request.\n. Thanks for the note, testing is high on the priority list at the moment... \n. Resolved with ^ pull request\n. Resolved with ^ pull request\n. fixed with ^ pull request\n. I currently don't have access to Ubuntu - and I'm not fully clear on the issue you're having. Could you provide a screenshot(s)?\n. I was able to recreate it - sort of ... If I click on the first pixel (top) of the button, it moves down by 1px (:active state) which most likely moves the hit state as well, so on release it's no longer on the button and the click doesn't get triggered.\nI'll look at it some more -\n. Closing with ^ pull request will be part of release 0.4.0\n. Moved to 0.3.5 release\n. Currently the pull request can't be merged automatically - \nI haven't updated/written the documentation for code updates yet, but changes should be made in the 'src/' folder. The 'lib/' files get automatically created by grunt after the lint and tests (tests incomplete at the moment) run successfully.\nAs for the functionality, I'm currently on the fence with this one. I may reconsider if this becomes a common issue. But I'd rather stick with inserting JS files at the bottom of the page.\n. Maybe as an alternative, it shouldn't initialize automatically. It could expose the init method and force the user to initialize...\n``` js\n// setup once\nalertify.init();\n// and then use\nalertify.alert(\"...\");\n```\nThat way it's only trying to access the DOM to create the elements when required. I'm still not sure if a DOM loaded event is the way to go for this issue.\n. Thanks for the request, it did surface an issue - however I went with a different approach (https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/22 initialize on first use) instead of the DOM loaded event.\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. Closing with ^ pull request\n. I've split the core and theme CSS into separate files. For this one, I'm leaning towards simply adding a alertify.bootstrap.css file which would style the dialogs in a bootstrap look and feel.\n. New CSS file was created to support a bootstrap look and feel. Will be part of 0.3.0 release.\n. Resolved with ^ pull request.\n. Thanks for the update, I'd prefer you kept the align as it was (values aligned), and make sure it doesn't break the grunt concat/min process. In the root of the directory, the grunt.js uses this file to generate the banner comment and some of the object keys it's looking for have been removed.\n. I like it - could you squash your commits and then I'll merge?\n. It is not standard behaviour of native alert() dialogs... but I'm still leaning towards it. I think it makes sense from a user perspective (even if it's not a modal window, which are what people tend to close with ESC)\n. I generally rebase (if the code hasn't be pushed - otherwise conflicts can occur)\ngit rebase -i HEAD~3\n3 is the number of commits to go back on. http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages\nthen squash comits onto each other\npick ...\nsquash ...\nsquash ...\nhttp://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits\n. You're testing changes got pushed and added to the pull request and also it can no longer be merged automatically. If you want to clean the commits and only leave 2fc2a2f - I'll merge (w/ fixed indentation)\n. This was being discussed in pull request https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/10. The request was to add a DOM loaded event, which I'm still not sure is the right approach for this project since most people already have a library to do this (e.g. jQuery)...\nI was thinking of 2 options (code examples are just for visual purposes):\n- expose the init method in the API meaning it would have to be initiated before use\n``` js\n// initialize after DOM ready\nalertify.init();\n// use\nalertify.alert(\"...\");\n```\n- check the first time alertify is used to see if it's already been initialized. That way it doesn't change the current usage but prevents alertify from trying to create DOM elements before it's told to.\n``` js\n// maybe in the dialog method\nif (typeof init === \"function\") init();\n// and have the init method delete itself after first use\ninit = function () {\n    ...\n    delete this.init;\n}\n```\nI'd love to get some input on it.\n. Documentation updates are a priority this weekend - mainly around usage, code contribution guidelines ... \n. Fixed with ^ pull request\n. Should be fixed with ^ pull request\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. I removed it since it made sense to bind the enter key to the buttons instead of the document (keyboard accessibility purposes).\nValid point for the prompt dialog though, it should behave like a form (submit from input field)... I opened a new issue for it https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/28.\n. Fixed with ^ pull request\n. fixed with ^ pull request\n. Hitting ENTER multiple times (after closing a dialog) triggers the href=\"#\" on the button link... resetting the focus to the trigger element will resolve this issue\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. Thanks for the fix! Added a few minor spacing comments... also ~~could you update the version in the package.json to 0.2.3~~ I'll update this after merging... \n. Good catch. I'm wondering if it makes sense to keep  the same functionality and fix the browser navigation issue or move towards the native implementation of dialogs (no callbacks). There's no validation in native dialogs, it simply does its job and lets the code figure out what to do with it... \ne.g.\n``` js\nvar string = alertify.prompt(\"name?\");\n// string equals the input value... \n// continue code\nif (alertify.confirm(\"sure?\")) {\n// true\n} else {\n// false\n}\n```\nThis would make it resemble the native dialogs but would take away the benefits of callbacks and chaining.\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. This looks good. Just need to apply the same \"wait\" parameter to the \"extend\" method.\ne.g. This should work... \njs\nalertify.custom = alertify.extend(\"custom\");\nalertify.custom( message, wait );\n. I'm not sure about this. The goal is to mimic browsers native behaviour as much as possible, but still keep UX in mind. IMO an \"undefined\" value for a message doesn't seem to benefit the user in any way where as a error tells the developer what is wrong during dev.\nI'm open to the discussion and if I get good argument to go down this road - I'm open to implementing.\nAs for issue https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/24, it's more about a optional prompt value (the default value that shows in the input field).\n. Closing this pull request. For the time being, I'm going to leave the message as required. Thanks\n. I'm with @abrkn. The prompt dialog is intended to access a value and pass it to a callback - nothing more, nothing less. It's the callbacks job to handle validation.\nI'll leave issue open and hear other opinions, but at this time I'm not inclined to implement.\n. I'll leave the issue open as a discussion and if the features gets a lot of interest I will reconsider.\n. I wouldn't say that a prompt dialog is a typical use-case for a login box. Not very secure. \nHowever, I'm considering adding an HTTP Authentication dialog. \nScreenshot\n\nScreenshot below is from above link under example 10, by clicking Display Image button.\n. I just don't like passwords getting passed around unencrypted.\nThe idea for the auth dialog would need to be flushed, but at first thought I'm seeing it tied to a form element. It wouldn't provide the login functionality, just a wrapper to point to an end point that would. That form could get be intercepted using JS to prevent post back.\nJust thinking out loud, if I decide to implement an auth dialog in alertify, it needs to be flexible, easily extendible without adding unnecessary bloat.\n. I'm not opposed to adding types, still not convinced on attributes (that is getting into a lot of bloat) - but it may have to wait for the 0.4. \nThe way the prompt dialog API is setup already has 3 optional parameters and would have to be reworked. \nFrom:\njs\nprompt( text [, callback, value, classes ] );\nTo:\n``` js\nprompt( text [, callback, options ] );\n// where options contains (variable names for demonstration):\noptions = {\n    value: '',\n    classes: '',\n    type: ''\n};\n```\nInstead of:\njs\nprompt( text [, callback, value, classes, TYPE ] );\nand I don't want to change the API (to break existing functionality) within a minor release. The 0.4 is based on a very similar API but since it's a release candidate I don't have an issue updating it to reflect a better approach.\n. Closing this issue - it's been sitting for a long time\n. I agree this could be a nice feature since it would mimic the native dialogs - but from a user experience, I'd rather have consistency. The goal is to mimic the native dialogs as much as possible, but also aim to improve the user experience where possible.\nI'll leave open for discussion - and see where this goes.\n. I'm not opposed to the reverse option. It could be part of the set method.\ne.g. alertify.set({ buttonReverse: true });\nor even more specific\nalertify.set({ buttonOrder: 'win' });, alertify.set({ buttonOrder: 'mac' });\nSomething along those lines. I'm opposed to adding the user agent sniffing code in alertify... \n. @stuartkeith looks good. I left a comment on 1 line... but if you want to open a PR for it, I'll merge\n. Closed with ^ pull request. Will be part of release 0.3.1.\n. I'm assuming (don't have the device to test) that it's a position: fixed support issue. I'll keep this on the radar and look for a valid fallback! \n. Sure - that would be great. Feel free to open a PR and we can start a discussion in there.\n. @javizarza any update on the fix? \n. You're in the right direction - the two main issues I have with this approach are:\n1. Agent detection instead of feature detection (I'd rather test against position fixed versus trying to determine all agent that don't support it)\n2. It's adding quite a bit of bloat calculating the position and adding inline styles\nI'm leaning towards checking what the modernizr test for position fixed is and see if that's a small enough test to add to the library. Then if the current device doesn't support position fixed, fallback to the default browser dialogs.\nmy 2 cents\n. It's a regression, I've resolved the labels property earlier (https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/45), the same will be applied to the delay property.\nFor now, you can specify the wait parameter individually...\njs\nalertify.success(\"message\", wait); // optional time in ms\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. you can call any of the alertify methods (e.g. alert, confirm, log...) on page load. \nIf you have a DOM ready function... e.g. jQuery\njs\n$(function() {\n    alertify.alert(\"Test\");\n});\nor you can load the library at the end of the html page and call it from there (inline script is not ideal - just for demonstration purposes).\nhtml\n    <script src=\"path_to_file/alertify.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>alertify.alert(\"test\");</script>\n</body>\n. it's hard to help with the information you're providing. It seems like you're looking for more help than just implementing this plugin.\nIf you linked the alertify.js file like option 2 from the comment above (and replace the path_to_file with the actual path to the image) it should work. \n. This hasn't had any activity in a while, closing.\n. Is this a unique instance request, where you can use multiple alerts but change/override any specific one OR a generic override for all buttons?\nif the latter, a CSS overwrite would do\ncss\n.alertify-button-ok { ... }\notherwise, maybe adding an optional parameter that allows a custom class for any dialog would be beneficial?\nJavaScript\njs\nalertify.alert(\"Message\", callback, \"custom-class\");\nCSS\ncss\n.alertify-dialog-custom-call { ... }\n. I can see this being useful, I'll have to think about the approach/implementation that makes the most sense... I want to be careful not overdoing the optional parameters.\nSuggestions are welcomed.\n. will be part of the 0.3.0 release. usage:\njs\nalertify.alert(\"message\", function () {}, \"css_class\");\nalertify.confirm(\"message\", function () {}, \"css_class\");\nalertify.prompt(\"message\", function () {}, \"placeholder\", \"css_class\");\n. This would be a nice feature - it's already possible to use with bower without the component.json, you just need the full git url, which I know isn't ideal.\n$ bower install git://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js.git\nThe bower documentation says there should only be at most one file per file type in the main list.\nI'm thinking I may create a separate shim repo similar to what the github components has, and serve alertify from there. That way it's separate and only serves the files needed. \nIt would require a bit of thinking since I'm hoping to expand the theme options to more than just the alertify.default.css.\nI've assigned this to the 0.3.0 milestone.\n. Closing this pull request. I've registered alertify as a bower package and pointed it to the shim repo https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js-shim.\nThanks for the suggestion.\n. rest looks good. I need to pay more attention to this!\n. this can no longer be merged automatically.\nCould you also provide some info (or link to info) on this? Just for my benefit. I get removing the gist of it, but would like to get more background!\n. The intention is to animate in/out. It's using CSS3 transitions so it requires a bit more logic to only remove the element after the transition is done.\nI will be implementing using the transitionend event. The fallback for browsers that don't support the event will simply remove the element right away - as it currently does. \n. resolved with ^ pull request. Will be part of 0.3.1\n. I appreciate the pull request... but I'm not really for this feature at this time. I don't believe it's the job of alertify to prevent it. And while I love customization - I want to limit the options and not have alertify try to do everything!\n. I like the feature, but please read the coding standards and Submitting a Pull Request.\nChanges should be made to the src/alertify.js file.\n. Status update? Looking to merge this in.\n. Opened new pull request ^ with same functionality.\n. alertify has a transparent cover element (which prevents clicking on elements behind the dialog) that can be styled as @RiderSx mentioned.\ncss\n.alertify-cover {\n    // can use an image\n    background: url( path_to_transparent_image );\n    // or can use RGBA\n    // this won't work for IE8- and would require a fallback\n    background: rgba(255,255,255,.5);\n}\n. you can apply the element.style to the .alertify-cover element.\ncss\n.alertify-cover {\n    background-color: #777777;\n    // untested but prefix and filter must be used\n    // for IE opacity support\n    -moz-opacity: .7;\n    -ms-filter: \"alpha(opacity=70)\";\n    filter: alpha(opacity=70);\n    opacity: .7;\n}\n. I'm going to close this issue. If you have other questions/comment, just reopen the issue or create a new one.\n. I already have a shim repo for packages. I hadn't included it to the NPM registry yet, but was in the plans. I wanted to make alertify a node module before that happened though. Currently not setup or tested to be used as one.\nThe reason behind the shim repo, is that it serves only the files needed. Not the unnecessary bloat that comes with the core.\n. Closing this based on comment above\n. It almost sounds like a conflict... If possible, I'd say disable any other plugins or JavaScript just as a preliminary ruling out whether it's a conflict or not (since it can't be reproduce on the example site)\nWhen all JS is removed except for alertify, if the issue is gone, it will come down to finding out where the conflict is occurring and if it's an issue with alertify or not.\nIf that doesn't solve the issue would you be able to provide more info, e.g. steps to reproduce, screenshots, anything that could help.\nIt's hard to debug an issue when it's unreproducible.\n. If you need more info/help simply reopen or log a new issue... if it happens to be a conflict, if you could post info about it, it'd be helpful. It'd be nice to see if it's something that alertify could prevent... \n. I still can't reproduce this in any browser on my mac (don't have access to a PC ATM)\nA couple things:\n1. I'd add a doctype - your page may be in quirks mode <!doctype html>\n2. How are you calling the gotoButtonClick function? Maybe that's where the issue happens.\nIt's very strange, all the button styles are simply CSS\n. Awesome. Any chance you could squash your commits? And feel free to throw your information in the Contributors doc!\n. Alertify is more aimed at replicating the native dialog which is why the public API is limited and only exposes the absolute required methods. I'm not sure if extending fits the description of what alertify.js tries to achieve.\nFor custom HTML or close buttons (to reuse your examples) falls more under a modal pattern, which many great libraries already offer.\n. Could you provide more info? I tried the same code on my end and it works properly.\n1. Browser/OS it's happening?\n2. How do you call the confirmDelete method?\n3. Is there any other JS that could create a conflict?\n. Has this been resolved? Looking to close this issue.\n. Closing - If more help is required, reopen or log a new issue\n. Never considered that use case. An extra class would be a viable option. \nA quick workaround, until a solution for all targeted browsers is available, is to use the :empty CSS selector (browser support).\ncss\n.alertify-logs:empty {\n    display: none;\n}\n. Fixed with ^ pull request. Will be part of release 0.4.0\n. Moved to 0.3.5 release\n. I'll keep this on the back burner and I'll try to take a look at it when I have access to a windows machine but it appears that Apple has (silently) stopped developing Safari for Windows. The last update (5.1.7) was in May 2012 and they've removed all direct download links on their website. With browser shares the way they are, unless it's an obvious error - I won't be spending too much time on it.\nI'll gladly accept a PR with a fix (if it doesn't require a safari specific hack) but otherwise, unfortunately for the time being, it's going to be low on the list of priorities.\n. Don't quote me on \"no longer supported\"... but certainly appears going in that direction\n. This issue should now be fixed. There was a CSS property that was conflicting with older versions of Safari. I've restructured a few things in ^ pull request.\n. Great! Closing issue\n. The elements get removed once the transitionend event is triggered. There was a bug regarding this issue reported. At a quick glance it appears that it had been resolved in the canary build, but I'll take a closer look when I have a chance.\nI wouldn't consider this a critical issue since the canary is an early adoption version and things may still change.\n. Definitely worth mentioning. I'll be keeping an eye on it. Cheers! \n. Appears to be resolved with stable release of chrome 26. Closing.\n. It's weird since the page shouldn't scroll, like you said it's simply a position fix. Sounds like it may not prevent the default event on the button click.\n- Does it happen with all three dialogs, or just prompt?\n- Can you recreate on the example site?\n- Does it append a blank anchor # to URL after button click?\nIf you could provide screenshots and/or post more info (code sample to recreate) I can try to debug. \n. yeah, fair enough... What OS? And can you reproduce on any other browsers (or are other browsers good like FF)?\n. I think I was able to reproduce, I'll look into it some more shortly and hopefully get this resolved soon.\n. Tied to this https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/81 - I can reproduce the Safari 5.1.* issue where the dialogs don't show which I believe is what you mean by freezes up (dialog doesn't show, but cover does - meaning you can't click on anything)\nStill investigating the jump to top issue.\n. #### Jump to Top\nThis is a result of setting focus to the OK button or input focus before the animation is complete. Currently a setTimeout with a 50ms delay is used which resolves issues with certain browsers that weren't setting focus at all. Setting a higher delay, e.g. 1000ms resolved the jump but is really ugly. Looking for a cleaner more reliable approach. (Thinking of using the transitionend instead of setTimeout to set focus)\nDialogs not Showing\nThere is a parameter of visibility: hidden in the .alertify-hidden class in the core alertify.core.css file. Removing this resolves the dialogs not showing but causes a failure in IE8-. Looking for a solution that will work cross browser.\nThanks for logging the issue - this will help solve major flaws.\n. Issues should be resolved with ^ pull request.\n. Awesome. Closing this issue. If anything comes up simply re-open or log a new one. Cheers\n. There's more to it than simply removing focus on the button (from a code's perspective). The ENTER and ESC keys are also bound to the buttons. This means you can click OK and Cancel via the ENTER and ESC respectively even if the buttons don't have focus.\n\nI am making double sure the user wants to take the action they just indicated, \n\nAgreed, that's fair and a common use case\n\nas I want the user to do extra work to complete the action\n\nNot sure I agree with this. Having to click twice (once for the initial action and once to confirm in the dialog) seems sufficient and standard practice. Taking away the ENTER key event, to me seems to go against best UX practices.\nI'd love to hear people's opinion...\n. @quasipickle \n\nWith focus on the OK button, they only need click once, then hit enter once\n\nI still think less savvy users (if primarily a mouse user) would not necessarily assume a focus state to the ENTER key and go from clicking a button with the mouse followed by an immediate ENTER key just because the button is focused.\nThe implementation of the native confirm dialog has OK focused by default. Maybe @dparlevliet is on to something. An extension of the confirm prompt which requires an actionable item (e.g. checkbox) before a user can confirm or deny.\nStill not sure it's needed, alertify is already rapidly growing in size (want to optimize and shrink it) and want to make sure that all features implemented into the core are valuable to the majority of users and not unique cases.\nMaybe starting an extension library would make sense and would also provide options for https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/39 and https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/70. Doesn't ship out with the core but extensions could be added as dependencies for users you want extra features/dialogs. Just a thought...\n. Feel free to open a PR, it's usually easier to have a discussion around physical code! Just follow the info on submitting a PR!\n. Awesome @dparlevliet. \nMore food for thought, maybe instead of an extension library, a custom build would be better? Ala Modernizr.\nThat way you could essentially just include the exact functionality that is needed and nothing else. (e.g. just dialogs, just logs, add extras...)\n. Closing with ^ pull request\n. Functional testing is far from up to date in alertify - so I wouldn't necessarily worry about it. I'm still new to testing so I've been focusing more on unit testing than functional testing. If you can sort it out, and more functional test can be based off of it that would be fantastic.\nI'm assuming since PhantomJS uses WebKit, it most likely detects the transitionend property and focus isn't set when you attempt to grab the active element. Since in the test there is no trigger element, you get back the body element.\nIn the jsfiddle you sent, the focus element is the trigger element and not the OK button. I'm assuming it's the same issue, focus isn't set until the transition is done, and therefore the active element remains the trigger button.\n. Overall I like it... a couple of minor code styling. My biggest concern is the focus state when set to none. If we can sort that out, I'll merge this in. \n. Tying to issue https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/86\n. I've update to 0.3.4 to resolve another issue. Just an FYI that you'll need to merge master into your branch so it can be automatically merged.\n. The inability to tab is a browser setting which (I believe) is off (mac webkit only?) by default.\nSafari Preferences\nPress Tab option \n\nChrome Settings\nPressing Tab option\n\nI don't have an issue tabbing through the links in the dialogs. The idea to not set the focus inside the dialog means that as a keyboard user (I rarely use the mouse) I have to tab through the entire page. I understand that the idea is to avoid (as much as possible) a user from doing something they didn't want.\nBut I won't sacrifice accessibility for it. I like the concept here - setting which button has focus, but still need a solution for null.\nAlso as an alternative, have you considered changing the labels on the button to be more descriptive? E.g. \"Disconnect Account\" and \"Cancel\" instead of a simple \"OK\", \"Cancel\" to re-enforce the action they will be taking?\n. The resetFocus element is at the end to keep the focus inside the dialog. When it receives focus, it automatically resets it to the first element so you can tab all you want and never leave the dialog\n. Option 1 works for me. Also for commit 077b28b, did you by chance remove the wrong file?\n. it seems like the 2 test files have been removed...Make sure these are still included and that you merge with master. I've made a few updates since you started this branch and it can no longer be automatically merged.\n. Actually that may be better - just link it to this one so the conversation doesn't get lost. And make sure you pull my master into your branch so it can be merged automatically.\nAlso, send the PR to the branch staging. I'm going to update documentation, that way I can do a code review, merge, pull down that branch, do the testing (without setting new remotes to pull down the PR branch) and so on... Just going to be a new process.\n. This is off the top of my head, so may want to just research and read up and confirm the syntax:\nSetup an upstream, a link so you can access my repo\ngit remote add upstream git://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js.git\nthen you can fetch, which will pull down the latest code from this repo\ngit fetch upstream\nand then you can pull the changes from this repos master into your branch (may want to create a test branch to do this just to see what happens)\ngit pull upstream master\nYou can read a bit on it here... http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/ under Make Your Fork Track the Original Upstream Repo\nThe article suggests doing a git merge upstream/master (from your master branch) which should make your repos master match my repos master... and then you would be able switch back to your dev branch, and do a git pull origin master and it should pull my changes into it.\nAgain, I would suggest you try it out in a test branch, so if anything goes wrong, you can just trash and move on.\n. The reason I can't accept it now is that it can't be automatically merged. The whole process of setting up an upstream doesn't normally get into play when submitting a quick patch, the problem here is that I've made some updates to master since you created your branch.\nCurrently your code base is out of date with mine, and some of your changes are conflicting with the updated master branch in my repo, so git doesn't know how to merge. Setting up an upstream simply allows you to pull in the latest update from my repo into yours, so that your pull request can be automatically merged.\nI appreciate your patience, and if you can set it up into another PR which includes the latest code from my master branch so it can be automatically merged, I'll merge, otherwise I can't... actually can't, I don't get the merge button.\nIt can sound like a lot, but it's really not that bad when you get a hang of git. \n. Do you mean log messages? And what exactly are you trying to do, add/pass custom HTML to a log message?\n. Close this - dup of #89. The dialog box is always the same - and can already be targeted. The log messages will be returned when issue #89 is resolved.\n. From code, no. You can click to close, plus it automatically closes after set time. Can you provide a use case for this? \n. I see your point. I'm thinking I may return the log message instead of the alertify object... This would take away chaining on log messages, but would return the newly created log message.\nI'll have to consider a few options, see what makes the most sense.\n. @simonwade this is a good approach. I was thinking of separating the log message and the dialog message into separate modules. I would keep the dialog module as a singleton and restructure the log module as a factory.\nThe idea would be to offer a custom build option for alertify to only include the parts needed.\n. The custom build would be optional - similar to Modernizr.\nBower would still pull in the full core library (no extension). The custom build option would simply be available for extensions that shouldn't be in the core library, but could be useful to some.\n. This issue is resolved in 0.4.0rc1. You can now do:\n``` js\nvar log = Alertify.log.info(\"Notification Message\", 0);\n// close\nlog.close();\n// after closing, you can recreate and reshow\nlog.create();\nlog.show();\n// you can also get the log element\n// returns DOM element\nlog.el\n```\nYou can try it out on the demo site\n. I'm still looking for the ideal build to make it easy for users to use and for developers to extend/customize. I've started modularizing it for 0.4.0. You can check it out at http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/0.4.0rc1 and the source code is the master branch.\nStill not perfect, but much more structured and a step in the right direction. I'm hoping by the release of 0.4.0 to have an extendable library but also one that can be added to the site in no time.\n. Merged. Issue resolved in 0.3.9. Branch 0.3 of repo or can be downloaded for the demo site.\nLeaving opening because it's still an issue for 0.4.\n. 0.4 is deprecated - closing\n. Great catch! Resolved with ^ pull request\n. @dparlevliet gave you good advice. I haven't tested the code, but it makes sense. For me, I would have asked why you wanted to do it this way? The only 2 things I can think of:\n1. You don't like writing alertify. everytime, or you wish to replace all existing native dialogs without changing any of the code base.\n2. You like that the native dialogs return a value  \njs\nalert(...)   // returns undefined\nconfirm(...) // returns true/false\nprompt(...)  // returns input value/null\nBoth of which are very hard to deal with.\n\nbecause the very nature of JavaScript is non-blocking\n\nThis is it. A user can't interact with a piece of UI while the script is executing, so if a user has to interact with UI before the script finishes, and the script has to finish before the user can interact with the UI... the browser would hang.\nThis is why alertify is using callbacks. It ensures that the script is only executed after the interaction has been made, but it doesn't block the execution of the rest of the code.\nI would consider changing the implementation and adding a finally function as a parameter. I'm not sure if it adds too much value, but could be worth exploring.\njs\nalertify.alert(\"string\", fnYes, fnFinally);\nalertify.confirm(\"string\", fnYes, fnNo, fnFinally);\nalertify.prompt(\"string\", fnYes, fnNo, fnFinally);\nAbove is very rough, but the fnFinally method would be called after the fnYes or fnNo to continue with your next code block.\n. As @dparlevliet mentioned, JavaScript is non-blocking by design. The idea that alertify. can simply be thrown in front of native dialog and everything just works is flawed.\nI also get that it would be nice if it could, but it's just not possible. It's just a matter of separating the code a little bit.\nStep 1: Current code\njs\n// using native dialogs\nfunction init () {\n    var answer = prompt(\"question\");\n    // do something with answer\n}\nStep 2: Separate the dialog from the rest of the code\n``` js\n// change to\nfunction init () {\n    var answer = prompt(\"question\");\n    handleAnswer(answer);\n}\nfunction handleAnswer (answer) {\n    // do something with answer\n}\n```\nStep 3: using alertify\n``` js\n// alertify 0.3.8\nfunction init () {\n    alertify.prompt(\"question\", function (e, answer) {\n        if (e) {\n            handleAnswer(answer);\n        }\n    });\n}\nfunction handleAnswer (answer) {\n    // do something with answer\n}\n```\n``` js\n// alertify 0.4.0rc1\nfunction init () {\n    Alertify.dialog.prompt(\"question\", function (answer) {\n        handleAnswer(answer);\n    });\n}\nfunction handleAnswer (answer) {\n    // do something with answer\n}\n```\n. Tying to https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/87 to keep the conversation around this PR. Two quick things (and then I'm done - I swear):\n1. Could you re-insert https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/87/files#L0R36 back? That was a great catch\n2. Could you update your single quotes to double quotes (for consistency)\nDon't worry about squashing - 2 commits is fine. Also feel free to add your info in the Contributors.md file in the root.\nOnce that's in - I'll merge! \nCheers\n. Appreciate the back and forth... I'm going to test it when I get home, and it will be part of the next minor version bump. Cheers\n. Strange... can you try pasting the following in the console on http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/ and see if you can reproduce?\njs\ndata = { name: \"test\" }\nalertify.log(data.name + ' has disconnected!', 'error', 5000);\nor using the error shorthand.\njs\ndata = { name: \"test\" }\nalertify.error(data.name + ' has disconnected!', 5000);\nI've tried both in chrome on OS X and don't have an issue clicking to close, or changing the 5000 to any value.\n. If you're using chrome.. you can hit cmd+alt+j to pull up the console or View > Developer > JavaScript Console. You'll be able to use the console there.\nBut it does sound like a conflict... if you have a hard time debugging, you can post (or send me a DM) with more code, I can take a look.\n. No problem, glad you were able to sort it out.\n. What version of alertify are you using? I fixed a similar issue at 0.3.3 so it may simply be an outdated version.\nAlso, could you double check the behaviour on the demo page (in IE9) to see if you can reproduce the same functionality (I wasn't able to)? I added a return false at the bottom of the function to prevent the default event from firing for browsers that don't support event.preventDefault. If a piece of code in your callback is causing an error, the return false would never be reached and the default event would be fired.\nI will look into the returnValue property... so instead of just testing against event.preventDefault... do something along the lines of event.preventDefault ? event.preventDefault() : event.returnValue = false; to try and prevent the default event from ever firing.\n. 0.4.0 isn't out yet, latest is 0.3.7 as of today! But glad to hear the issue is resolved. Cheers\n. I noticed this issue when building the new site yesterday - link styles from the site can conflict with the link styles in alertify.js, not just the bootstrap theme.\nThe direction I'm looking for is to reset all a styles in the alertify.core.css to ensure no conflict happens. That way, any styles in the site will be reset to none (e.g. background, border, text-decoration...) and only the styles defined in alertify.js will be shown.\n. I've updated the CSS to avoid (as much as possible) any conflicts in ^ PR. Thanks for submitting.\n. Could you provide a code sample (reproducible example)? Currently alertify dialogs are queued and shouldn't overlap. Also, the cover element should show up blocking any interaction with the page. I'm attempting to double click buttons on the example site and can't encounter the issue.\nIs there a JS error? There could be a conflict.\nAs a side note, something to consider. A user shouldn't be able to re-submit a form.\n. > it will show other alerts\nMy bad, I misunderstood this part. I was thinking dialogs and not log messages.\nFor log messages, currently there is no way to only open them once, or only if they are not currently open. The thought behind logs was always a 1:1, every time you take an action the corresponding log is shown.\nI feel like multiple log messages is still better than no logs at all. That way a user is aware that he's taken another action. If a user clicks a button and there's a log tied to it, then it should show a new one every time that button is clicked. If you don't want it to show more than once, the button should get disabled.\nA form for example, I still believe the best approach is to disable the submit button until the form action is completed.\nI personally feel like removing the log notification is a workaround the problem... and not really a solution to the problem.\n. Thanks for the PR but IE6 is not on my browser support list and I'd rather not include hacks (more so expression) in the css.\nI'm still planning on having support for devices (mainly handhelds) that don't support position: fixed so maybe that fix will make IE6 work.\n. > How do I create an external alertify.js using tools provided in the web.\nNot sure what you mean?\nFrom what I get you should be able to just run alertify.alert(\"You have...\");\n. In order to redirect to a different URL, you need to use the callback function, see below:\njs\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    // alert dialog\n    alertify.alert(\"<b>You have reached the WW Network.<Br>The WW Network uses state-of-art<a href=\\\"http://www.hasoffers.com/customer-satisfaction/\\\">tracking</a> from our private domain tracker.ww.com.<br><i>We are only accepting<a href=\\\"http://network.w-wnetwork.com/signup\\\">*10* new affiliates for January, so join today!</i>\", function () {\n        window.location = \"http://google.ca\";\n    });\n});\nnote: you have to escape \\\" quotes or use single quotes.\n. I pasted the exact code you need to run what you're asking for in the comment above. You just need to replace the window.location with window.open(URL).\nI'd rather you not post signup links in the comments for self promotion. I'm glad to help hooking up the functionality you need - but that doesn't require you posting the actual URL.\nCheers,\n. Please don't open new issue when you already have one open. Closing, dup of #110\n. Currently there is no setting/config for it. I'm working on making the log messages more flexible (individually control the position of each). In the meantime you can overwrite the CSS to control the position of the logs.\ncss\n.alertify-logs {\n    top: 10px;\n    right: 10px;\n}\n. For now I'd like to keep the look & feel and placement of the elements to be controlled via CSS. I will not implement this functionality into alertify.js.\nI may create more themes - with time - that will have elements placed in different location, but these will all be through CSS.\n. Thanks for the PR, I like it.\nCould you update the single quotes to double quotes (code consistency) and change the PR to merge into staging to follow the pull request guidelines.\n. You'll need to update your codebase so it can merge automatically. And you'll need to follow the pull request guidelines.\nMainly open the PR to the staging branch.\n. Hmm, I like the idea of the buttons. Not sure about the tabindex attribute though. It would have to be dynamic because of the buttonReverse property. Also, the JS already handles this, sets focus on the proper button and keeps focus inside the dialog while it's open. Not sure how much value the tabindex add since it's a dynamically created element.\nSide note: you'd need to clean your commits. I would only want the actual code changes, not the merges in ideally 1 squashed commit.\n. The tests don't run because of linting errors. If you fix the quotes issue the tests should pass.\n. I released 0.4.0rc1 and I've included this as part of it. If you want to submit another PR so it's part of the 0.3.* release, fix the escaping and submit to the 0.3 branch.\n. Mainly fixed in #154 \n. @Martinho0330 This is not the right place for that question. I opened a new issue\n. Thanks for the note, I've been meaning to update the docs, but haven't had time to fully do them. The master branch is currently at 0.4.0rc1 and the API has changed which is why it doesn't work as expected.\nThe master branch is tagged at versions to ensure it works as expected at that point, but using master as in may sometimes result in unexpected behaviour.\nTo use the master branch, you need to follow the new API documentation which currently isn't available (in progress), but you can checkout the example site to see the usage.\n. @Martinho0330: Could you be more specific? I'm not sure exactly what you mean?\n. If I understand correctly, you want to display the text as it goes down? e.g. 10... 9... 8... until the notification is closed?\nIf that's the case, you cannot. The new version 0.4.0rc1, not yet stable, does offer an API to the log elements, so it's something that could be added on your end.\n``` js\n// using 0.4.0rc1\n// this will not work with 0.3.8\nvar log = Alertify.log.info(\"Notification Message\", 10000);\n// will return the log DOM element which you can manipulate\nconsole.log(log.el);\n```\n. I'll have investigate this one. I'm currently away at a conference but will take a look when I get back. \nAny reason why you're running compatibility mode? Just curious!\n. I got to test it and was able to recreate the issue.\n\nIt's something to do with the :focus state. If you hit the tab key to cycle through the button, whichever one has focus doesn't show. First thing you could try is to remove the :focus state in the CSS. See if that works.\nI'll will look at it this weekend, just don't have time while at the conference to debug.\nCheers,\n. I just tested the 0.4.0 release candidate version - tag 0.4.0rc1 and it works. I'll sort out what the differences are between the 2 and get a fix in for the 0.3.* stable release. 0.3.* will be deprecated shortly as 0.4.0 approaches.\n\n. You can grab the source on the tags page.\nJust a word of warning, 0.4.0rc1 is a release candidate, so everything may not be stable, and also the API has changed quite a bit from 0.3.*.\nFeel free to look at the demo site at http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/0.4.0rc1\n. Fixed with ^ PR\n. I'll be investigating this. The answer provided does makes sense (as a workaround) since transitionend can be a bit buggy. I will try to find a more elegant solution to include as part of alertify.\n. Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. I don't have that combination to test with. I did pull up a Android 2.3 emulator on browserstack and wasn't able to recreate the issue.\nI was able to create new logs while the page showed other logs. And I also couldn't recreate the page jump. Any chance you could provide steps to recreate or a demo link - can direct message a link if you don't want to post public.\n\nCould you also test the demo site (http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/) with the Android device see if you can reproduce? It may be a conflict between alertify.js and something in phonegap.\n. any updates on this? If it's no longer an issue I will be closing the issue.\n. You have to provide more information in order for someone to help you out. You should check the opening issues wiki entry\nShort version of the wiki entry\n\nPlease list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue.\nInclude versions of your OS, browser, etc.\nInclude relevant sample code. The less code you include, the easier/faster the problem can be found. Try to only include the bare minimum code required to reproduce the error.\n. See caniuse and MDN\n. Good catch... agreed that I don't really like having -show and -hide at the same time. Will look for a more elegant solution.\n. Good catch - thanks.\n. There's nothing there that should create an issue outside of Alertify should be alertify.\n\nCan you reproduce it on the example site? If so, can you provide the steps to reproduce. I've just tested it with the latest version of Chrome (Version 26.0.1410.65, Mac 10.8.3) and in Safari on my iPhone and everything worked fine.\nIf you can't reproduce on example site example site, could you provide sample code with the issue being reproduced?\n. I don't have an iPad first generation to test, but I'll fire up browserstack to test it and see if I can recreate/debug it. I'll update with my findings.\n. I'm looking at it now - so far I'm able to open 1 dialog (iOS 5.1, iOS 4.3.2) with weird behaviour (jumps to the top of the page) but can't open any other afterwards.\nI've tested the 0.4.0rc1 version, and it appears to work on both of these. Could you confirm? Test the 0.4.0rc1 demo site. I'll start seeing what the differences are and see what I can do.\n. That's correct. There's an issue with the transition properties at the moment, which I've resolved, causing the cover to show, but not the dialog (\"hang\" mode).\nI'm close - I have resolved the issue with the dialog not showing after the first time (2nd time onward dialogs show perfectly), but the first item still causes the page to jump to the top. Need to sort that out and I'll push an update.\n. @janroesner Any chance you could take a look at the above PR and test the new source with your iPad to ensure the fix does indeed work? I was seeing the behaviour in the simulator and the changes resolved the issue, but getting confirmation on the actual device is always better.\nedit:\nthe 2 files to look at are alertify.js and core css\n. I had to remove the transitions - that's what was causing the issue. It supports an older syntax for CSS transitions but doesn't do so very reliability. \nI will look for a workaround but that will be for the 0.4 release. \nThanks for the help. I'll merge/release/update docs when I get a chance. \nSent from my iPhone\nOn 2013-04-20, at 4:20 PM, Jan Roesner notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@fabien-d It works like a charme.

Initializing on a specific DOM element would require some tweaking. I can mark it as a nice to have or accept a PR if anyone wants to implement.\nClicking through is a known issue. There is a fix in the issue details, which I will implement soon.\n. Could you try the demo page with the same browser? Generally this issue happens when the browser supports transitionend but the event is not firing properly.\nIf the issue can be reproduced on the demo page, I'll try to debug, if it doesn't happen on the demo page, maybe you could provide a code sample from your project so I can take a look.\n. any updates on this?\n. Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. The alertify confirm method does not work the same as the native confirm. It does not return true or false. JavaScript is non-blocking meaning the if (s == true) { will get tested before the user clicks on ok or cancel.\nalertify uses callbacks to get around this problem...\njs\n$(\"#Button1\").on(\"click\", function () {\n    alertify.confirm(\"This is an alert dialog\", function (e) {\n        if (e) {\n            // user clicked ok\n        } else {\n            // user clicked cancel\n        }\n    });\n});\n. sorry for the delay - any progress on this?

Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. Unfortunately JavaScript is a non-blocking language and this is not possible.

Closing - if you have more questions/comments, feel free to reopen.\n. Looks like a duplicate of #138. See if the workaround in that issue works for you. Still haven't had a chance to implement a fix.\n. Fixed with ^ PR\n. This seems like it may be an event bubbling issue. I remember having something similar with chaining alertify dialogs but has been fixed.\nInstead of using event.stopPropagation() try replacing it with event.preventDefault() and/or a return false at the bottom of the function.\n\nSince the .live() method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events\n\n^ from the jQuery docs. And the live() method simply calls the on() method.\nIf that doesn't work - could you try providing a working demo?\nI've tried calling, on the docs page, an alert dialog after the confirm without issues (w and w/o delay)\njs\nalertify.confirm('test', function (e) {\n    if (e) {\n        setTimeout( function () { alertify.alert('blah'); }, 1000);\n    } else {\n        alertify.alert('cancel');\n    }\n});\n. Could you confirm if this is only happening using the keyboard? It's the only way I have been able to reproduce...\nI haven't been able to reproduce in 0.4.0rc1 (keyboard or mouse), so I'll see about implementing the fix in 0.3.*.\n. the clicking once is another issue - there is a temporary fix at issue #138.\nSo there is a bug in the alertify code. In the hide method, I set isOpen to false immediately and I believe since there is a small delay between the ajax request and the next call, the new dialog gets confused for the existing one and also closes. \nI'll have to dig a bit more and tweak some of the functionality around this.\n. I wasn't able to reproduce - but I haven't tested it with your example so I can say for sure it will work.\n0.4 is in release candidate, so it hasn't been fully tested and it's a completely new API (can't just swap 0.3 for 0.4). You can see the demo site and see if you want to give it a go.\nI'm hoping to get more time to work on alertify and get 0.3 stable and then leave it as a legacy as I bring 0.4 stable and onto a 1.0\n. Sounds similar to #166. Should be fixed with #176 which will be in 0.3.11\n. thanks for the fix\n. I'm going to keep alertify in front end package managers.\n. Thanks for the PR. I don't really know much about composer or Packagist - so I'm just going to do a bit of research on it before merging.\n. Do you have any arguments on why a JS plugin should be part of a PHP package manager? I'm hesitant on whether it makes sense...\n. I'm going to pass on this for now. Since you can still use it with composer without the composer.json file. Also, 0.4 has been deprecated. Cheers,\n. Resolved with #155 \n. The build was fix with #154 so you can pull down the latest master branch and should be able to run grunt.\nAlso, this functionality exists in 0.3.*, it just hasn't been ported over to 0.4 yet, so I would like to keep it consistent with where the type gets appended.\nSee https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/0.3/src/alertify.js#L286 and screenshot:\n\n.

Fixed and reset the 0.3.11 tag to include this. Thanks\n. Care to elaborate...\n. Can you provide more info? A demo page, code samples... \n. the library detects if define is used and doesn't expose alertify globally. If you want to use with AMD, you need to include it as a dependency:\njs\ndefine( [ PATH_TO_ALERTIFY ], function ( alertify ) {\n    alertify.success( 'Hi' );\n} );\n. did you also include the alertify.core.css? you need both the core and theme styles.\n. Great\n. not a stupid question - just bad documentation which I will try to update sometime.\nThe extend method allows to generate custom log messages. The parameter custom can be whatever you choose.\nFor example:\n`` js\n// sets a property onalertify` object\nalertify.[anyKeyValueYouWant] = alertify.extend( 'anyStringYouWant' );\n// so you can then write\nalertify.anyKeyValueYouWant( 'custom log message' );\n```\nIn the HTML, this will output:\nhtml\n<!-- notice the extra class, this is the value passed in the extend method -->\n<article class=\"alertify-log alertify-log-anyStringYouWant\">custom log message</article>\nThen in CSS, you can then control the look of those specific messages:\ncss\n.alertify-log-anyStringYouWant {\n    /* overwrite default styles */\n}\nIn short:\n- the string argument passed in the extend method will be used as a class name on the log messages\n- the key value you assign to alertify lets you call it directly.\nSee https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/0.3.*-API-Documentation#extend\nThis is how the success and error methods work - https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/0.3.*-API-Documentation#success--error\nHope that's clear\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. Ruby and Compass are needed to compile Sass into CSS. If you just cloned the project - I would suggest you checkout the 0.3 branch (https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/tree/0.3) since that is latest stable release.\nMaster currently points to 0.4.0rc1 which will never be done. I'm skipping that release and going straight to 0.5.0.\nIn the 0.3.* release, there is no Sass so you will not need ruby or compass.\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. See https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/185#issuecomment-27147210\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. I just put a very basic starting point, I was hoping to get a designer to jump in and help. It will for sure looking much better for the actual 0.5.0 release.\n. Can you double check if this is not just indentation? I generally write CSS with sub styles nested. E.g.\n``` css\n.container {\n}\n.container-child {\n}\n\n```\nwhich can make it seem like the last line is missing a closing } although it is not.\n. Here's the file from that release tag: https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/0.3/themes/alertify.default.css. I don't see any missing }. \n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. I'm going to need more information.. code sample? This error only happens if the JS file hasn't been included.\n. It's a GitHub page and a temporary issue with them. \n. no worries.\n. Thanks - I'll take a closer look when I get a few mins. Could you fix the indentation, tabs, so it is consistent and matching the current 0.3 formatting.\n. There is some indentation issues - e.g.\n\nand\n\nOtherwise it looks good.\n. If you do format the code feel free to reopen the PR. I will merge, but only if it's following the code standards, cheers\n. JavaScript is non blocking which means alertify.js does not block the execution like standard dialogs. You would have to use callbacks to handle it.\nSince it does not block the execution the code continues to run while the alert is shown causing the the focus to be overlooked.\njs\nif (TestCase > 1) {\n    alertify.alert(\"Please make a...\", function () {\n        // this code is only called after the button has been clicked\n        document.EditForm.percent_off_subtotal.focus();\n    });\n}\n. Closing - if you need more help feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. There is a .alertify-message class that can be used to left align just the message, if I understand correctly.\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. ``` js\n$(document).ready(function(){\n    $('.delete-page').on('click', function(event){\n        // add me, stop the default link from clicking\n        event.preventDefault();\n    alertify.confirm(\"Message\", function (e) {\n      if (e) {\n          // use window.location and go to a->href\n      } else {            \n        return false; \n      }        \n  });     \n});\n\n});\n```\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. What version of safari are you seeing this in? \nThe default behaviour is to block access to other elements, could you provide me a sample case with the issue? \n. Thanks - would it be possible to squash your commits? Then I'll merge.\n. Could you provide more information?\n. Thanks for the submission but I've deprecated 0.4. I'm jumping straight to 0.5 which will hopefully turn into a 1.0 and a possibly the end of this project. https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/173\nAlso, warning is not part of the alertify core. You would have to add the warning to alertify for this to be merged. If you want to add it to 0.3 I'll merge.\nExample\nhttps://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/0.3/src/alertify.js#L612\njs\nwarning : function (message, wait) { _alertify.log(message, \"warning\", wait); return this; }\n. Closing - if you want to send the patch to 0.3 I'll merge in there. Cheers\n. thanks for the PR but this isn't the look and feel direction I'm looking for. If you want to keep playing around with styles, feel free to update this PR or even just post screenshots in the issue itself (#187) so we can have some open discussion around the overall direction.\nI'm looking for something much simpler and not as obtrusive. Cheers,\n. the base colour is really more of a \"wireframe\" approach. I want to get a theme before I release 0.5.0 - but I would like to keep it more on the subtle side\n. The div highlighted in the screenshot below covers the alertify dialog (higher z-index) and also has a tabindex of -1. If you simply remove the tabindex attribute you will be able to edit the alertify prompt.\n\nFeel free to reopen if this does not solve your issue.\n. And I should have looked at the stackoverflow link before posting that - \n. Unfortunately not at this time. It may be worth doing in the 0.5.0 release.\n. Thanks for the PR - I do like the idea. There are a few things missing:\n- update the log, success and error methods in the API. (https://github.com/S-anasol/alertify.js/blob/0.3/lib/alertify.js#L622-L625)\n- update the extend method to ensure the functionality can also be used. (https://github.com/S-anasol/alertify.js/blob/0.3/lib/alertify.js#L396-L402)\n. could you provide more info? Version, screenshots, code sample to recreate...\n. When a dialog is open, it creates an invisible cover that will disable all mouse clicks from happening on the underlying site. This is to \"mimic\" the behaviour of native dialogs. \nDialogs are used to force the user to take an action before being able to continue. This is intended behaviour.\n. I think we're talking about the same thing... you're issue is attempting to click a link on the page (behind the dialog)?\nIf so, that is blocked by design. If that's not what you mean - may need to provide a bit more info\n. I misunderstood - log messages should NOT block interaction. If that's what is happening then there could be a bug.\nCould you provide a small code sample that recreates the issue? Also, which version/browser this is happening and I'll take a look \n. I'm in the process of cleaning up the repo - master is currently an old dev version of 0.4 which is deprecated. If your issue is happening in 0.3 you would have to open the PR against that branch.\nThe fix seems strange, I'm looking at reproducing your error - but I'm not able to. The .alertify-logs element is only the size of the log messages and don't interfere with any elements below.\n. I'll investigate - I'm not too familiar with iframe communication so if anyone as more information that would be helpful\n. Does this only happen in IE11? IE10- and other browsers are ok?\n. could you provide a sample recreating this issue? It would make debugging/fixing easier. Thanks\n. No problem! \n. I don't know much about .NET environments, but a few quick things to check -\n1. Could there be another script that is interfering? If you remove all other JS files, does the problem remain?\n2. Double and triple check the path\n3. Are you using AMD (e.g. requirejs)? That would prevent alertify from getting attached to the window object causing it to be undefined.\n. The position of dialogs are currently controlled globally, meaning all dialogs open at the same location. There is no way to open a dialog at a specific location for each trigger element.\nIf this doesn't answer you question - please see the opening issues page and provide more information to have this issue solved.\n. Are you able to reproduce the issue on the example site?\nAnd please see https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/Opening-Issues to provide enough information to be able to get issues resolved in a timely manner.\n. what version of alertify.js are you using? Alertify (uppercase \"A\") was part of 0.4 which is deprecated. I would suggest using 0.3 or 0.5 which uses alertify (lowercase \"a\").\nUsage and examples can be found at: https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki#usage-documentation\n. Could you provide more info? There is an opening issues wiki entry on providing the information needed to quickly resolve the issue. I unfortunately don't have too much free time at the moment, and the more information you provide, the easier it will be for me (or someone else) to help you out.\nExample template from the wiki.

Any chance you could provide a code sample with the error? I'm trying to reproduce but can't - also does it happen on the [demo page](http://fabien-d.github.io/alertify.js/)?\n. I was debating this myself - in0.3the HTML was inserted via JS, but with0.5` I was leaning towards having it in the DOM by default. Saves the DOM injection which (in a way) makes it slightly faster. \nI'm not married to the idea - I'm open to re-inserting in the JS if it makes sense. But I do like the idea of HTML being HTML. It's a transition towards it being a component.\n. I will - I've never published to NPM (someone did), only bower. I'll update as soon as I get a chance.\n. It is not possible. Alertify.js mimics the native dialogs and the prompt dialog is a single input.\n. I've updated the site (http://fabien-d.github.io/alertify.js/) with a link pointing back to your fork. I'm going to leave the repo as is until a fork takes off. Your roadmap does look good - \n. >  it's not my fork\nMy bad. I shouldn't have assumed it was.\n. All animations/effects are done through CSS transitions.\n. duplicate of https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/234\n. This project is no longer being maintained.\nThis is not a feature I would add to the core plugin. The dialogs purposely do not have a self closing method because the goal of a dialog is to get a response from the user. The project aimed to keep the alertify.js dialogs reflecting the native dialogs.\n. This is not an alertify.js issue. This is a form handling/submission issue. Without changing your code, the following would work.\nPass the event object from the markup:\ndiff\n- onclick='return xFunction();'\n+ onclick='return xFunction(event);'\nAdd the event object as a parameter:\ndiff\n- xFunction = function() {\n+ xFunction = function(event) {\nNow the preventDefault() will stop the form from submitting so you'll have to submit it programmatically when the dialog is confirmed.\ndiff\n- $('#conf1').click();\n+ $('form').submit();\nyou can look at a quick \"working\" example on CodePen: https://codepen.io/fabien-d/pen/c2874e38af19af131d088afc75bdf2d2. Thanks for submitting the issue. Fixed with ^ pull request.\n. Thanks for the note, testing is high on the priority list at the moment... \n. Resolved with ^ pull request\n. Resolved with ^ pull request\n. fixed with ^ pull request\n. I currently don't have access to Ubuntu - and I'm not fully clear on the issue you're having. Could you provide a screenshot(s)?\n. I was able to recreate it - sort of ... If I click on the first pixel (top) of the button, it moves down by 1px (:active state) which most likely moves the hit state as well, so on release it's no longer on the button and the click doesn't get triggered.\nI'll look at it some more -\n. Closing with ^ pull request will be part of release 0.4.0\n. Moved to 0.3.5 release\n. Currently the pull request can't be merged automatically - \nI haven't updated/written the documentation for code updates yet, but changes should be made in the 'src/' folder. The 'lib/' files get automatically created by grunt after the lint and tests (tests incomplete at the moment) run successfully.\nAs for the functionality, I'm currently on the fence with this one. I may reconsider if this becomes a common issue. But I'd rather stick with inserting JS files at the bottom of the page.\n. Maybe as an alternative, it shouldn't initialize automatically. It could expose the init method and force the user to initialize...\n``` js\n// setup once\nalertify.init();\n// and then use\nalertify.alert(\"...\");\n```\nThat way it's only trying to access the DOM to create the elements when required. I'm still not sure if a DOM loaded event is the way to go for this issue.\n. Thanks for the request, it did surface an issue - however I went with a different approach (https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/22 initialize on first use) instead of the DOM loaded event.\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. Closing with ^ pull request\n. I've split the core and theme CSS into separate files. For this one, I'm leaning towards simply adding a alertify.bootstrap.css file which would style the dialogs in a bootstrap look and feel.\n. New CSS file was created to support a bootstrap look and feel. Will be part of 0.3.0 release.\n. Resolved with ^ pull request.\n. Thanks for the update, I'd prefer you kept the align as it was (values aligned), and make sure it doesn't break the grunt concat/min process. In the root of the directory, the grunt.js uses this file to generate the banner comment and some of the object keys it's looking for have been removed.\n. I like it - could you squash your commits and then I'll merge?\n. It is not standard behaviour of native alert() dialogs... but I'm still leaning towards it. I think it makes sense from a user perspective (even if it's not a modal window, which are what people tend to close with ESC)\n. I generally rebase (if the code hasn't be pushed - otherwise conflicts can occur)\ngit rebase -i HEAD~3\n3 is the number of commits to go back on. http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages\nthen squash comits onto each other\npick ...\nsquash ...\nsquash ...\nhttp://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits\n. You're testing changes got pushed and added to the pull request and also it can no longer be merged automatically. If you want to clean the commits and only leave 2fc2a2f - I'll merge (w/ fixed indentation)\n. This was being discussed in pull request https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/10. The request was to add a DOM loaded event, which I'm still not sure is the right approach for this project since most people already have a library to do this (e.g. jQuery)...\nI was thinking of 2 options (code examples are just for visual purposes):\n- expose the init method in the API meaning it would have to be initiated before use\n``` js\n// initialize after DOM ready\nalertify.init();\n// use\nalertify.alert(\"...\");\n```\n- check the first time alertify is used to see if it's already been initialized. That way it doesn't change the current usage but prevents alertify from trying to create DOM elements before it's told to.\n``` js\n// maybe in the dialog method\nif (typeof init === \"function\") init();\n// and have the init method delete itself after first use\ninit = function () {\n    ...\n    delete this.init;\n}\n```\nI'd love to get some input on it.\n. Documentation updates are a priority this weekend - mainly around usage, code contribution guidelines ... \n. Fixed with ^ pull request\n. Should be fixed with ^ pull request\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. I removed it since it made sense to bind the enter key to the buttons instead of the document (keyboard accessibility purposes).\nValid point for the prompt dialog though, it should behave like a form (submit from input field)... I opened a new issue for it https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/28.\n. Fixed with ^ pull request\n. fixed with ^ pull request\n. Hitting ENTER multiple times (after closing a dialog) triggers the href=\"#\" on the button link... resetting the focus to the trigger element will resolve this issue\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. Thanks for the fix! Added a few minor spacing comments... also ~~could you update the version in the package.json to 0.2.3~~ I'll update this after merging... \n. Good catch. I'm wondering if it makes sense to keep  the same functionality and fix the browser navigation issue or move towards the native implementation of dialogs (no callbacks). There's no validation in native dialogs, it simply does its job and lets the code figure out what to do with it... \ne.g.\n``` js\nvar string = alertify.prompt(\"name?\");\n// string equals the input value... \n// continue code\nif (alertify.confirm(\"sure?\")) {\n// true\n} else {\n// false\n}\n```\nThis would make it resemble the native dialogs but would take away the benefits of callbacks and chaining.\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. This looks good. Just need to apply the same \"wait\" parameter to the \"extend\" method.\ne.g. This should work... \njs\nalertify.custom = alertify.extend(\"custom\");\nalertify.custom( message, wait );\n. I'm not sure about this. The goal is to mimic browsers native behaviour as much as possible, but still keep UX in mind. IMO an \"undefined\" value for a message doesn't seem to benefit the user in any way where as a error tells the developer what is wrong during dev.\nI'm open to the discussion and if I get good argument to go down this road - I'm open to implementing.\nAs for issue https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/24, it's more about a optional prompt value (the default value that shows in the input field).\n. Closing this pull request. For the time being, I'm going to leave the message as required. Thanks\n. I'm with @abrkn. The prompt dialog is intended to access a value and pass it to a callback - nothing more, nothing less. It's the callbacks job to handle validation.\nI'll leave issue open and hear other opinions, but at this time I'm not inclined to implement.\n. I'll leave the issue open as a discussion and if the features gets a lot of interest I will reconsider.\n. I wouldn't say that a prompt dialog is a typical use-case for a login box. Not very secure. \nHowever, I'm considering adding an HTTP Authentication dialog. \nScreenshot\n\nScreenshot below is from above link under example 10, by clicking Display Image button.\n. I just don't like passwords getting passed around unencrypted.\nThe idea for the auth dialog would need to be flushed, but at first thought I'm seeing it tied to a form element. It wouldn't provide the login functionality, just a wrapper to point to an end point that would. That form could get be intercepted using JS to prevent post back.\nJust thinking out loud, if I decide to implement an auth dialog in alertify, it needs to be flexible, easily extendible without adding unnecessary bloat.\n. I'm not opposed to adding types, still not convinced on attributes (that is getting into a lot of bloat) - but it may have to wait for the 0.4. \nThe way the prompt dialog API is setup already has 3 optional parameters and would have to be reworked. \nFrom:\njs\nprompt( text [, callback, value, classes ] );\nTo:\n``` js\nprompt( text [, callback, options ] );\n// where options contains (variable names for demonstration):\noptions = {\n    value: '',\n    classes: '',\n    type: ''\n};\n```\nInstead of:\njs\nprompt( text [, callback, value, classes, TYPE ] );\nand I don't want to change the API (to break existing functionality) within a minor release. The 0.4 is based on a very similar API but since it's a release candidate I don't have an issue updating it to reflect a better approach.\n. Closing this issue - it's been sitting for a long time\n. I agree this could be a nice feature since it would mimic the native dialogs - but from a user experience, I'd rather have consistency. The goal is to mimic the native dialogs as much as possible, but also aim to improve the user experience where possible.\nI'll leave open for discussion - and see where this goes.\n. I'm not opposed to the reverse option. It could be part of the set method.\ne.g. alertify.set({ buttonReverse: true });\nor even more specific\nalertify.set({ buttonOrder: 'win' });, alertify.set({ buttonOrder: 'mac' });\nSomething along those lines. I'm opposed to adding the user agent sniffing code in alertify... \n. @stuartkeith looks good. I left a comment on 1 line... but if you want to open a PR for it, I'll merge\n. Closed with ^ pull request. Will be part of release 0.3.1.\n. I'm assuming (don't have the device to test) that it's a position: fixed support issue. I'll keep this on the radar and look for a valid fallback! \n. Sure - that would be great. Feel free to open a PR and we can start a discussion in there.\n. @javizarza any update on the fix? \n. You're in the right direction - the two main issues I have with this approach are:\n1. Agent detection instead of feature detection (I'd rather test against position fixed versus trying to determine all agent that don't support it)\n2. It's adding quite a bit of bloat calculating the position and adding inline styles\nI'm leaning towards checking what the modernizr test for position fixed is and see if that's a small enough test to add to the library. Then if the current device doesn't support position fixed, fallback to the default browser dialogs.\nmy 2 cents\n. It's a regression, I've resolved the labels property earlier (https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/45), the same will be applied to the delay property.\nFor now, you can specify the wait parameter individually...\njs\nalertify.success(\"message\", wait); // optional time in ms\n. Fixed with ^^ pull request\n. you can call any of the alertify methods (e.g. alert, confirm, log...) on page load. \nIf you have a DOM ready function... e.g. jQuery\njs\n$(function() {\n    alertify.alert(\"Test\");\n});\nor you can load the library at the end of the html page and call it from there (inline script is not ideal - just for demonstration purposes).\nhtml\n    <script src=\"path_to_file/alertify.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>alertify.alert(\"test\");</script>\n</body>\n. it's hard to help with the information you're providing. It seems like you're looking for more help than just implementing this plugin.\nIf you linked the alertify.js file like option 2 from the comment above (and replace the path_to_file with the actual path to the image) it should work. \n. This hasn't had any activity in a while, closing.\n. Is this a unique instance request, where you can use multiple alerts but change/override any specific one OR a generic override for all buttons?\nif the latter, a CSS overwrite would do\ncss\n.alertify-button-ok { ... }\notherwise, maybe adding an optional parameter that allows a custom class for any dialog would be beneficial?\nJavaScript\njs\nalertify.alert(\"Message\", callback, \"custom-class\");\nCSS\ncss\n.alertify-dialog-custom-call { ... }\n. I can see this being useful, I'll have to think about the approach/implementation that makes the most sense... I want to be careful not overdoing the optional parameters.\nSuggestions are welcomed.\n. will be part of the 0.3.0 release. usage:\njs\nalertify.alert(\"message\", function () {}, \"css_class\");\nalertify.confirm(\"message\", function () {}, \"css_class\");\nalertify.prompt(\"message\", function () {}, \"placeholder\", \"css_class\");\n. This would be a nice feature - it's already possible to use with bower without the component.json, you just need the full git url, which I know isn't ideal.\n$ bower install git://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js.git\nThe bower documentation says there should only be at most one file per file type in the main list.\nI'm thinking I may create a separate shim repo similar to what the github components has, and serve alertify from there. That way it's separate and only serves the files needed. \nIt would require a bit of thinking since I'm hoping to expand the theme options to more than just the alertify.default.css.\nI've assigned this to the 0.3.0 milestone.\n. Closing this pull request. I've registered alertify as a bower package and pointed it to the shim repo https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js-shim.\nThanks for the suggestion.\n. rest looks good. I need to pay more attention to this!\n. this can no longer be merged automatically.\nCould you also provide some info (or link to info) on this? Just for my benefit. I get removing the gist of it, but would like to get more background!\n. The intention is to animate in/out. It's using CSS3 transitions so it requires a bit more logic to only remove the element after the transition is done.\nI will be implementing using the transitionend event. The fallback for browsers that don't support the event will simply remove the element right away - as it currently does. \n. resolved with ^ pull request. Will be part of 0.3.1\n. I appreciate the pull request... but I'm not really for this feature at this time. I don't believe it's the job of alertify to prevent it. And while I love customization - I want to limit the options and not have alertify try to do everything!\n. I like the feature, but please read the coding standards and Submitting a Pull Request.\nChanges should be made to the src/alertify.js file.\n. Status update? Looking to merge this in.\n. Opened new pull request ^ with same functionality.\n. alertify has a transparent cover element (which prevents clicking on elements behind the dialog) that can be styled as @RiderSx mentioned.\ncss\n.alertify-cover {\n    // can use an image\n    background: url( path_to_transparent_image );\n    // or can use RGBA\n    // this won't work for IE8- and would require a fallback\n    background: rgba(255,255,255,.5);\n}\n. you can apply the element.style to the .alertify-cover element.\ncss\n.alertify-cover {\n    background-color: #777777;\n    // untested but prefix and filter must be used\n    // for IE opacity support\n    -moz-opacity: .7;\n    -ms-filter: \"alpha(opacity=70)\";\n    filter: alpha(opacity=70);\n    opacity: .7;\n}\n. I'm going to close this issue. If you have other questions/comment, just reopen the issue or create a new one.\n. I already have a shim repo for packages. I hadn't included it to the NPM registry yet, but was in the plans. I wanted to make alertify a node module before that happened though. Currently not setup or tested to be used as one.\nThe reason behind the shim repo, is that it serves only the files needed. Not the unnecessary bloat that comes with the core.\n. Closing this based on comment above\n. It almost sounds like a conflict... If possible, I'd say disable any other plugins or JavaScript just as a preliminary ruling out whether it's a conflict or not (since it can't be reproduce on the example site)\nWhen all JS is removed except for alertify, if the issue is gone, it will come down to finding out where the conflict is occurring and if it's an issue with alertify or not.\nIf that doesn't solve the issue would you be able to provide more info, e.g. steps to reproduce, screenshots, anything that could help.\nIt's hard to debug an issue when it's unreproducible.\n. If you need more info/help simply reopen or log a new issue... if it happens to be a conflict, if you could post info about it, it'd be helpful. It'd be nice to see if it's something that alertify could prevent... \n. I still can't reproduce this in any browser on my mac (don't have access to a PC ATM)\nA couple things:\n1. I'd add a doctype - your page may be in quirks mode <!doctype html>\n2. How are you calling the gotoButtonClick function? Maybe that's where the issue happens.\nIt's very strange, all the button styles are simply CSS\n. Awesome. Any chance you could squash your commits? And feel free to throw your information in the Contributors doc!\n. Alertify is more aimed at replicating the native dialog which is why the public API is limited and only exposes the absolute required methods. I'm not sure if extending fits the description of what alertify.js tries to achieve.\nFor custom HTML or close buttons (to reuse your examples) falls more under a modal pattern, which many great libraries already offer.\n. Could you provide more info? I tried the same code on my end and it works properly.\n1. Browser/OS it's happening?\n2. How do you call the confirmDelete method?\n3. Is there any other JS that could create a conflict?\n. Has this been resolved? Looking to close this issue.\n. Closing - If more help is required, reopen or log a new issue\n. Never considered that use case. An extra class would be a viable option. \nA quick workaround, until a solution for all targeted browsers is available, is to use the :empty CSS selector (browser support).\ncss\n.alertify-logs:empty {\n    display: none;\n}\n. Fixed with ^ pull request. Will be part of release 0.4.0\n. Moved to 0.3.5 release\n. I'll keep this on the back burner and I'll try to take a look at it when I have access to a windows machine but it appears that Apple has (silently) stopped developing Safari for Windows. The last update (5.1.7) was in May 2012 and they've removed all direct download links on their website. With browser shares the way they are, unless it's an obvious error - I won't be spending too much time on it.\nI'll gladly accept a PR with a fix (if it doesn't require a safari specific hack) but otherwise, unfortunately for the time being, it's going to be low on the list of priorities.\n. Don't quote me on \"no longer supported\"... but certainly appears going in that direction\n. This issue should now be fixed. There was a CSS property that was conflicting with older versions of Safari. I've restructured a few things in ^ pull request.\n. Great! Closing issue\n. The elements get removed once the transitionend event is triggered. There was a bug regarding this issue reported. At a quick glance it appears that it had been resolved in the canary build, but I'll take a closer look when I have a chance.\nI wouldn't consider this a critical issue since the canary is an early adoption version and things may still change.\n. Definitely worth mentioning. I'll be keeping an eye on it. Cheers! \n. Appears to be resolved with stable release of chrome 26. Closing.\n. It's weird since the page shouldn't scroll, like you said it's simply a position fix. Sounds like it may not prevent the default event on the button click.\n- Does it happen with all three dialogs, or just prompt?\n- Can you recreate on the example site?\n- Does it append a blank anchor # to URL after button click?\nIf you could provide screenshots and/or post more info (code sample to recreate) I can try to debug. \n. yeah, fair enough... What OS? And can you reproduce on any other browsers (or are other browsers good like FF)?\n. I think I was able to reproduce, I'll look into it some more shortly and hopefully get this resolved soon.\n. Tied to this https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/81 - I can reproduce the Safari 5.1.* issue where the dialogs don't show which I believe is what you mean by freezes up (dialog doesn't show, but cover does - meaning you can't click on anything)\nStill investigating the jump to top issue.\n. #### Jump to Top\nThis is a result of setting focus to the OK button or input focus before the animation is complete. Currently a setTimeout with a 50ms delay is used which resolves issues with certain browsers that weren't setting focus at all. Setting a higher delay, e.g. 1000ms resolved the jump but is really ugly. Looking for a cleaner more reliable approach. (Thinking of using the transitionend instead of setTimeout to set focus)\nDialogs not Showing\nThere is a parameter of visibility: hidden in the .alertify-hidden class in the core alertify.core.css file. Removing this resolves the dialogs not showing but causes a failure in IE8-. Looking for a solution that will work cross browser.\nThanks for logging the issue - this will help solve major flaws.\n. Issues should be resolved with ^ pull request.\n. Awesome. Closing this issue. If anything comes up simply re-open or log a new one. Cheers\n. There's more to it than simply removing focus on the button (from a code's perspective). The ENTER and ESC keys are also bound to the buttons. This means you can click OK and Cancel via the ENTER and ESC respectively even if the buttons don't have focus.\n\nI am making double sure the user wants to take the action they just indicated, \n\nAgreed, that's fair and a common use case\n\nas I want the user to do extra work to complete the action\n\nNot sure I agree with this. Having to click twice (once for the initial action and once to confirm in the dialog) seems sufficient and standard practice. Taking away the ENTER key event, to me seems to go against best UX practices.\nI'd love to hear people's opinion...\n. @quasipickle \n\nWith focus on the OK button, they only need click once, then hit enter once\n\nI still think less savvy users (if primarily a mouse user) would not necessarily assume a focus state to the ENTER key and go from clicking a button with the mouse followed by an immediate ENTER key just because the button is focused.\nThe implementation of the native confirm dialog has OK focused by default. Maybe @dparlevliet is on to something. An extension of the confirm prompt which requires an actionable item (e.g. checkbox) before a user can confirm or deny.\nStill not sure it's needed, alertify is already rapidly growing in size (want to optimize and shrink it) and want to make sure that all features implemented into the core are valuable to the majority of users and not unique cases.\nMaybe starting an extension library would make sense and would also provide options for https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/39 and https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/70. Doesn't ship out with the core but extensions could be added as dependencies for users you want extra features/dialogs. Just a thought...\n. Feel free to open a PR, it's usually easier to have a discussion around physical code! Just follow the info on submitting a PR!\n. Awesome @dparlevliet. \nMore food for thought, maybe instead of an extension library, a custom build would be better? Ala Modernizr.\nThat way you could essentially just include the exact functionality that is needed and nothing else. (e.g. just dialogs, just logs, add extras...)\n. Closing with ^ pull request\n. Functional testing is far from up to date in alertify - so I wouldn't necessarily worry about it. I'm still new to testing so I've been focusing more on unit testing than functional testing. If you can sort it out, and more functional test can be based off of it that would be fantastic.\nI'm assuming since PhantomJS uses WebKit, it most likely detects the transitionend property and focus isn't set when you attempt to grab the active element. Since in the test there is no trigger element, you get back the body element.\nIn the jsfiddle you sent, the focus element is the trigger element and not the OK button. I'm assuming it's the same issue, focus isn't set until the transition is done, and therefore the active element remains the trigger button.\n. Overall I like it... a couple of minor code styling. My biggest concern is the focus state when set to none. If we can sort that out, I'll merge this in. \n. Tying to issue https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/86\n. I've update to 0.3.4 to resolve another issue. Just an FYI that you'll need to merge master into your branch so it can be automatically merged.\n. The inability to tab is a browser setting which (I believe) is off (mac webkit only?) by default.\nSafari Preferences\nPress Tab option \n\nChrome Settings\nPressing Tab option\n\nI don't have an issue tabbing through the links in the dialogs. The idea to not set the focus inside the dialog means that as a keyboard user (I rarely use the mouse) I have to tab through the entire page. I understand that the idea is to avoid (as much as possible) a user from doing something they didn't want.\nBut I won't sacrifice accessibility for it. I like the concept here - setting which button has focus, but still need a solution for null.\nAlso as an alternative, have you considered changing the labels on the button to be more descriptive? E.g. \"Disconnect Account\" and \"Cancel\" instead of a simple \"OK\", \"Cancel\" to re-enforce the action they will be taking?\n. The resetFocus element is at the end to keep the focus inside the dialog. When it receives focus, it automatically resets it to the first element so you can tab all you want and never leave the dialog\n. Option 1 works for me. Also for commit 077b28b, did you by chance remove the wrong file?\n. it seems like the 2 test files have been removed...Make sure these are still included and that you merge with master. I've made a few updates since you started this branch and it can no longer be automatically merged.\n. Actually that may be better - just link it to this one so the conversation doesn't get lost. And make sure you pull my master into your branch so it can be merged automatically.\nAlso, send the PR to the branch staging. I'm going to update documentation, that way I can do a code review, merge, pull down that branch, do the testing (without setting new remotes to pull down the PR branch) and so on... Just going to be a new process.\n. This is off the top of my head, so may want to just research and read up and confirm the syntax:\nSetup an upstream, a link so you can access my repo\ngit remote add upstream git://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js.git\nthen you can fetch, which will pull down the latest code from this repo\ngit fetch upstream\nand then you can pull the changes from this repos master into your branch (may want to create a test branch to do this just to see what happens)\ngit pull upstream master\nYou can read a bit on it here... http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/ under Make Your Fork Track the Original Upstream Repo\nThe article suggests doing a git merge upstream/master (from your master branch) which should make your repos master match my repos master... and then you would be able switch back to your dev branch, and do a git pull origin master and it should pull my changes into it.\nAgain, I would suggest you try it out in a test branch, so if anything goes wrong, you can just trash and move on.\n. The reason I can't accept it now is that it can't be automatically merged. The whole process of setting up an upstream doesn't normally get into play when submitting a quick patch, the problem here is that I've made some updates to master since you created your branch.\nCurrently your code base is out of date with mine, and some of your changes are conflicting with the updated master branch in my repo, so git doesn't know how to merge. Setting up an upstream simply allows you to pull in the latest update from my repo into yours, so that your pull request can be automatically merged.\nI appreciate your patience, and if you can set it up into another PR which includes the latest code from my master branch so it can be automatically merged, I'll merge, otherwise I can't... actually can't, I don't get the merge button.\nIt can sound like a lot, but it's really not that bad when you get a hang of git. \n. Do you mean log messages? And what exactly are you trying to do, add/pass custom HTML to a log message?\n. Close this - dup of #89. The dialog box is always the same - and can already be targeted. The log messages will be returned when issue #89 is resolved.\n. From code, no. You can click to close, plus it automatically closes after set time. Can you provide a use case for this? \n. I see your point. I'm thinking I may return the log message instead of the alertify object... This would take away chaining on log messages, but would return the newly created log message.\nI'll have to consider a few options, see what makes the most sense.\n. @simonwade this is a good approach. I was thinking of separating the log message and the dialog message into separate modules. I would keep the dialog module as a singleton and restructure the log module as a factory.\nThe idea would be to offer a custom build option for alertify to only include the parts needed.\n. The custom build would be optional - similar to Modernizr.\nBower would still pull in the full core library (no extension). The custom build option would simply be available for extensions that shouldn't be in the core library, but could be useful to some.\n. This issue is resolved in 0.4.0rc1. You can now do:\n``` js\nvar log = Alertify.log.info(\"Notification Message\", 0);\n// close\nlog.close();\n// after closing, you can recreate and reshow\nlog.create();\nlog.show();\n// you can also get the log element\n// returns DOM element\nlog.el\n```\nYou can try it out on the demo site\n. I'm still looking for the ideal build to make it easy for users to use and for developers to extend/customize. I've started modularizing it for 0.4.0. You can check it out at http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/0.4.0rc1 and the source code is the master branch.\nStill not perfect, but much more structured and a step in the right direction. I'm hoping by the release of 0.4.0 to have an extendable library but also one that can be added to the site in no time.\n. Merged. Issue resolved in 0.3.9. Branch 0.3 of repo or can be downloaded for the demo site.\nLeaving opening because it's still an issue for 0.4.\n. 0.4 is deprecated - closing\n. Great catch! Resolved with ^ pull request\n. @dparlevliet gave you good advice. I haven't tested the code, but it makes sense. For me, I would have asked why you wanted to do it this way? The only 2 things I can think of:\n1. You don't like writing alertify. everytime, or you wish to replace all existing native dialogs without changing any of the code base.\n2. You like that the native dialogs return a value  \njs\nalert(...)   // returns undefined\nconfirm(...) // returns true/false\nprompt(...)  // returns input value/null\nBoth of which are very hard to deal with.\n\nbecause the very nature of JavaScript is non-blocking\n\nThis is it. A user can't interact with a piece of UI while the script is executing, so if a user has to interact with UI before the script finishes, and the script has to finish before the user can interact with the UI... the browser would hang.\nThis is why alertify is using callbacks. It ensures that the script is only executed after the interaction has been made, but it doesn't block the execution of the rest of the code.\nI would consider changing the implementation and adding a finally function as a parameter. I'm not sure if it adds too much value, but could be worth exploring.\njs\nalertify.alert(\"string\", fnYes, fnFinally);\nalertify.confirm(\"string\", fnYes, fnNo, fnFinally);\nalertify.prompt(\"string\", fnYes, fnNo, fnFinally);\nAbove is very rough, but the fnFinally method would be called after the fnYes or fnNo to continue with your next code block.\n. As @dparlevliet mentioned, JavaScript is non-blocking by design. The idea that alertify. can simply be thrown in front of native dialog and everything just works is flawed.\nI also get that it would be nice if it could, but it's just not possible. It's just a matter of separating the code a little bit.\nStep 1: Current code\njs\n// using native dialogs\nfunction init () {\n    var answer = prompt(\"question\");\n    // do something with answer\n}\nStep 2: Separate the dialog from the rest of the code\n``` js\n// change to\nfunction init () {\n    var answer = prompt(\"question\");\n    handleAnswer(answer);\n}\nfunction handleAnswer (answer) {\n    // do something with answer\n}\n```\nStep 3: using alertify\n``` js\n// alertify 0.3.8\nfunction init () {\n    alertify.prompt(\"question\", function (e, answer) {\n        if (e) {\n            handleAnswer(answer);\n        }\n    });\n}\nfunction handleAnswer (answer) {\n    // do something with answer\n}\n```\n``` js\n// alertify 0.4.0rc1\nfunction init () {\n    Alertify.dialog.prompt(\"question\", function (answer) {\n        handleAnswer(answer);\n    });\n}\nfunction handleAnswer (answer) {\n    // do something with answer\n}\n```\n. Tying to https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/87 to keep the conversation around this PR. Two quick things (and then I'm done - I swear):\n1. Could you re-insert https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/87/files#L0R36 back? That was a great catch\n2. Could you update your single quotes to double quotes (for consistency)\nDon't worry about squashing - 2 commits is fine. Also feel free to add your info in the Contributors.md file in the root.\nOnce that's in - I'll merge! \nCheers\n. Appreciate the back and forth... I'm going to test it when I get home, and it will be part of the next minor version bump. Cheers\n. Strange... can you try pasting the following in the console on http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/ and see if you can reproduce?\njs\ndata = { name: \"test\" }\nalertify.log(data.name + ' has disconnected!', 'error', 5000);\nor using the error shorthand.\njs\ndata = { name: \"test\" }\nalertify.error(data.name + ' has disconnected!', 5000);\nI've tried both in chrome on OS X and don't have an issue clicking to close, or changing the 5000 to any value.\n. If you're using chrome.. you can hit cmd+alt+j to pull up the console or View > Developer > JavaScript Console. You'll be able to use the console there.\nBut it does sound like a conflict... if you have a hard time debugging, you can post (or send me a DM) with more code, I can take a look.\n. No problem, glad you were able to sort it out.\n. What version of alertify are you using? I fixed a similar issue at 0.3.3 so it may simply be an outdated version.\nAlso, could you double check the behaviour on the demo page (in IE9) to see if you can reproduce the same functionality (I wasn't able to)? I added a return false at the bottom of the function to prevent the default event from firing for browsers that don't support event.preventDefault. If a piece of code in your callback is causing an error, the return false would never be reached and the default event would be fired.\nI will look into the returnValue property... so instead of just testing against event.preventDefault... do something along the lines of event.preventDefault ? event.preventDefault() : event.returnValue = false; to try and prevent the default event from ever firing.\n. 0.4.0 isn't out yet, latest is 0.3.7 as of today! But glad to hear the issue is resolved. Cheers\n. I noticed this issue when building the new site yesterday - link styles from the site can conflict with the link styles in alertify.js, not just the bootstrap theme.\nThe direction I'm looking for is to reset all a styles in the alertify.core.css to ensure no conflict happens. That way, any styles in the site will be reset to none (e.g. background, border, text-decoration...) and only the styles defined in alertify.js will be shown.\n. I've updated the CSS to avoid (as much as possible) any conflicts in ^ PR. Thanks for submitting.\n. Could you provide a code sample (reproducible example)? Currently alertify dialogs are queued and shouldn't overlap. Also, the cover element should show up blocking any interaction with the page. I'm attempting to double click buttons on the example site and can't encounter the issue.\nIs there a JS error? There could be a conflict.\nAs a side note, something to consider. A user shouldn't be able to re-submit a form.\n. > it will show other alerts\nMy bad, I misunderstood this part. I was thinking dialogs and not log messages.\nFor log messages, currently there is no way to only open them once, or only if they are not currently open. The thought behind logs was always a 1:1, every time you take an action the corresponding log is shown.\nI feel like multiple log messages is still better than no logs at all. That way a user is aware that he's taken another action. If a user clicks a button and there's a log tied to it, then it should show a new one every time that button is clicked. If you don't want it to show more than once, the button should get disabled.\nA form for example, I still believe the best approach is to disable the submit button until the form action is completed.\nI personally feel like removing the log notification is a workaround the problem... and not really a solution to the problem.\n. Thanks for the PR but IE6 is not on my browser support list and I'd rather not include hacks (more so expression) in the css.\nI'm still planning on having support for devices (mainly handhelds) that don't support position: fixed so maybe that fix will make IE6 work.\n. > How do I create an external alertify.js using tools provided in the web.\nNot sure what you mean?\nFrom what I get you should be able to just run alertify.alert(\"You have...\");\n. In order to redirect to a different URL, you need to use the callback function, see below:\njs\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    // alert dialog\n    alertify.alert(\"<b>You have reached the WW Network.<Br>The WW Network uses state-of-art<a href=\\\"http://www.hasoffers.com/customer-satisfaction/\\\">tracking</a> from our private domain tracker.ww.com.<br><i>We are only accepting<a href=\\\"http://network.w-wnetwork.com/signup\\\">*10* new affiliates for January, so join today!</i>\", function () {\n        window.location = \"http://google.ca\";\n    });\n});\nnote: you have to escape \\\" quotes or use single quotes.\n. I pasted the exact code you need to run what you're asking for in the comment above. You just need to replace the window.location with window.open(URL).\nI'd rather you not post signup links in the comments for self promotion. I'm glad to help hooking up the functionality you need - but that doesn't require you posting the actual URL.\nCheers,\n. Please don't open new issue when you already have one open. Closing, dup of #110\n. Currently there is no setting/config for it. I'm working on making the log messages more flexible (individually control the position of each). In the meantime you can overwrite the CSS to control the position of the logs.\ncss\n.alertify-logs {\n    top: 10px;\n    right: 10px;\n}\n. For now I'd like to keep the look & feel and placement of the elements to be controlled via CSS. I will not implement this functionality into alertify.js.\nI may create more themes - with time - that will have elements placed in different location, but these will all be through CSS.\n. Thanks for the PR, I like it.\nCould you update the single quotes to double quotes (code consistency) and change the PR to merge into staging to follow the pull request guidelines.\n. You'll need to update your codebase so it can merge automatically. And you'll need to follow the pull request guidelines.\nMainly open the PR to the staging branch.\n. Hmm, I like the idea of the buttons. Not sure about the tabindex attribute though. It would have to be dynamic because of the buttonReverse property. Also, the JS already handles this, sets focus on the proper button and keeps focus inside the dialog while it's open. Not sure how much value the tabindex add since it's a dynamically created element.\nSide note: you'd need to clean your commits. I would only want the actual code changes, not the merges in ideally 1 squashed commit.\n. The tests don't run because of linting errors. If you fix the quotes issue the tests should pass.\n. I released 0.4.0rc1 and I've included this as part of it. If you want to submit another PR so it's part of the 0.3.* release, fix the escaping and submit to the 0.3 branch.\n. Mainly fixed in #154 \n. @Martinho0330 This is not the right place for that question. I opened a new issue\n. Thanks for the note, I've been meaning to update the docs, but haven't had time to fully do them. The master branch is currently at 0.4.0rc1 and the API has changed which is why it doesn't work as expected.\nThe master branch is tagged at versions to ensure it works as expected at that point, but using master as in may sometimes result in unexpected behaviour.\nTo use the master branch, you need to follow the new API documentation which currently isn't available (in progress), but you can checkout the example site to see the usage.\n. @Martinho0330: Could you be more specific? I'm not sure exactly what you mean?\n. If I understand correctly, you want to display the text as it goes down? e.g. 10... 9... 8... until the notification is closed?\nIf that's the case, you cannot. The new version 0.4.0rc1, not yet stable, does offer an API to the log elements, so it's something that could be added on your end.\n``` js\n// using 0.4.0rc1\n// this will not work with 0.3.8\nvar log = Alertify.log.info(\"Notification Message\", 10000);\n// will return the log DOM element which you can manipulate\nconsole.log(log.el);\n```\n. I'll have investigate this one. I'm currently away at a conference but will take a look when I get back. \nAny reason why you're running compatibility mode? Just curious!\n. I got to test it and was able to recreate the issue.\n\nIt's something to do with the :focus state. If you hit the tab key to cycle through the button, whichever one has focus doesn't show. First thing you could try is to remove the :focus state in the CSS. See if that works.\nI'll will look at it this weekend, just don't have time while at the conference to debug.\nCheers,\n. I just tested the 0.4.0 release candidate version - tag 0.4.0rc1 and it works. I'll sort out what the differences are between the 2 and get a fix in for the 0.3.* stable release. 0.3.* will be deprecated shortly as 0.4.0 approaches.\n\n. You can grab the source on the tags page.\nJust a word of warning, 0.4.0rc1 is a release candidate, so everything may not be stable, and also the API has changed quite a bit from 0.3.*.\nFeel free to look at the demo site at http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/0.4.0rc1\n. Fixed with ^ PR\n. I'll be investigating this. The answer provided does makes sense (as a workaround) since transitionend can be a bit buggy. I will try to find a more elegant solution to include as part of alertify.\n. Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. I don't have that combination to test with. I did pull up a Android 2.3 emulator on browserstack and wasn't able to recreate the issue.\nI was able to create new logs while the page showed other logs. And I also couldn't recreate the page jump. Any chance you could provide steps to recreate or a demo link - can direct message a link if you don't want to post public.\n\nCould you also test the demo site (http://fabien-d.github.com/alertify.js/) with the Android device see if you can reproduce? It may be a conflict between alertify.js and something in phonegap.\n. any updates on this? If it's no longer an issue I will be closing the issue.\n. You have to provide more information in order for someone to help you out. You should check the opening issues wiki entry\nShort version of the wiki entry\n\nPlease list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue.\nInclude versions of your OS, browser, etc.\nInclude relevant sample code. The less code you include, the easier/faster the problem can be found. Try to only include the bare minimum code required to reproduce the error.\n. See caniuse and MDN\n. Good catch... agreed that I don't really like having -show and -hide at the same time. Will look for a more elegant solution.\n. Good catch - thanks.\n. There's nothing there that should create an issue outside of Alertify should be alertify.\n\nCan you reproduce it on the example site? If so, can you provide the steps to reproduce. I've just tested it with the latest version of Chrome (Version 26.0.1410.65, Mac 10.8.3) and in Safari on my iPhone and everything worked fine.\nIf you can't reproduce on example site example site, could you provide sample code with the issue being reproduced?\n. I don't have an iPad first generation to test, but I'll fire up browserstack to test it and see if I can recreate/debug it. I'll update with my findings.\n. I'm looking at it now - so far I'm able to open 1 dialog (iOS 5.1, iOS 4.3.2) with weird behaviour (jumps to the top of the page) but can't open any other afterwards.\nI've tested the 0.4.0rc1 version, and it appears to work on both of these. Could you confirm? Test the 0.4.0rc1 demo site. I'll start seeing what the differences are and see what I can do.\n. That's correct. There's an issue with the transition properties at the moment, which I've resolved, causing the cover to show, but not the dialog (\"hang\" mode).\nI'm close - I have resolved the issue with the dialog not showing after the first time (2nd time onward dialogs show perfectly), but the first item still causes the page to jump to the top. Need to sort that out and I'll push an update.\n. @janroesner Any chance you could take a look at the above PR and test the new source with your iPad to ensure the fix does indeed work? I was seeing the behaviour in the simulator and the changes resolved the issue, but getting confirmation on the actual device is always better.\nedit:\nthe 2 files to look at are alertify.js and core css\n. I had to remove the transitions - that's what was causing the issue. It supports an older syntax for CSS transitions but doesn't do so very reliability. \nI will look for a workaround but that will be for the 0.4 release. \nThanks for the help.

Merged. Issue resolved in 0.3.9. Branch 0.3 of repo or can be downloaded for the demo site.\n. I'm not really sure what the issue is - any chance you could provide a working code sample of the issue? \n. Tag was added. Thanks\n. alertify.js 0.4 appears to be tied to -> https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/158\n\nSeems like the issue is also happening in 0.3? I'm not familiar with turbolinks so hopefully someone can provide more insight. \n. Fixed with #161 \n. Fixed with ^ PR\n. I'm hoping to get a fix in for this shortly.\nduplicate of https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/137\n. as a quick workaround you can add the following line in alertify.core.css if you're using 0.3.* or  in alertify.css if you're using 0.4.0rc1.\nI'd need to test that this doesn't create issues elsewhere, but it could be a hot fix in the meantime.\ncss\n:root *> .alertify-hidden {\n    display: block;\n    visibility: hidden; /* <-- add this line */\n}\n. Have you had any luck with this? I haven't been able to reproduce and if it's still an issue with the latest 0.3.10?\n. Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. duplicate of #138.\nSetting it to display: none prevents the CSS animation from running. A temporary workaround is to add visibility: hidden;.\nWill be looking for a better solution.\n. Thanks for the report/fix. Would you mind opening a PR? \n. Fixed with ^ PR\n. There is no Metro theme with the plugin, but it would just be creating a new theme in CSS. I'll accept a PR! \nI don't have an outloook account, I sort of understand the request, which would require quite a bit of tweaking - but could you provide a screenshot just to confirm.\n. Initializing on a specific DOM element would require some tweaking. I can mark it as a nice to have or accept a PR if anyone wants to implement.\nClicking through is a known issue. There is a fix in the issue details, which I will implement soon.\n. Could you try the demo page with the same browser? Generally this issue happens when the browser supports transitionend but the event is not firing properly.\nIf the issue can be reproduced on the demo page, I'll try to debug, if it doesn't happen on the demo page, maybe you could provide a code sample from your project so I can take a look.\n. any updates on this?\n. Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. The alertify confirm method does not work the same as the native confirm. It does not return true or false. JavaScript is non-blocking meaning the if (s == true) { will get tested before the user clicks on ok or cancel.\nalertify uses callbacks to get around this problem...\njs\n$(\"#Button1\").on(\"click\", function () {\n    alertify.confirm(\"This is an alert dialog\", function (e) {\n        if (e) {\n            // user clicked ok\n        } else {\n            // user clicked cancel\n        }\n    });\n});\n. sorry for the delay - any progress on this? If not, any chance you could provide more info on the issue. I'm not sure what you mean by\n\nbutton click event on the server side is not being fired.\n. Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. Unfortunately JavaScript is a non-blocking language and this is not possible. You'd have to adjust the code to use the callback.\n\njs\nalertify.confirm( 'question', function ( e ) {\n    if ( e ) {\n        // the code to execute after a user choice\n    }\n});\n. Closing - if you have more questions/comments, feel free to reopen.\n. Looks like a duplicate of #138. See if the workaround in that issue works for you. Still haven't had a chance to implement a fix.\n. Fixed with ^ PR\n. This seems like it may be an event bubbling issue. I remember having something similar with chaining alertify dialogs but has been fixed.\nInstead of using event.stopPropagation() try replacing it with event.preventDefault() and/or a return false at the bottom of the function.\n\nSince the .live() method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events\n\n^ from the jQuery docs. And the live() method simply calls the on() method.\nIf that doesn't work - could you try providing a working demo?\nI've tried calling, on the docs page, an alert dialog after the confirm without issues (w and w/o delay)\njs\nalertify.confirm('test', function (e) {\n    if (e) {\n        setTimeout( function () { alertify.alert('blah'); }, 1000);\n    } else {\n        alertify.alert('cancel');\n    }\n});\n. Could you confirm if this is only happening using the keyboard? It's the only way I have been able to reproduce...\nI haven't been able to reproduce in 0.4.0rc1 (keyboard or mouse), so I'll see about implementing the fix in 0.3.*.\n. the clicking once is another issue - there is a temporary fix at issue #138.\nSo there is a bug in the alertify code. In the hide method, I set isOpen to false immediately and I believe since there is a small delay between the ajax request and the next call, the new dialog gets confused for the existing one and also closes. \nI'll have to dig a bit more and tweak some of the functionality around this.\n. I wasn't able to reproduce - but I haven't tested it with your example so I can say for sure it will work.\n0.4 is in release candidate, so it hasn't been fully tested and it's a completely new API (can't just swap 0.3 for 0.4). You can see the demo site and see if you want to give it a go.\nI'm hoping to get more time to work on alertify and get 0.3 stable and then leave it as a legacy as I bring 0.4 stable and onto a 1.0\n. Sounds similar to #166. Should be fixed with #176 which will be in 0.3.11\n. thanks for the fix\n. I'm going to keep alertify in front end package managers.\n. Thanks for the PR. I don't really know much about composer or Packagist - so I'm just going to do a bit of research on it before merging.\n. Do you have any arguments on why a JS plugin should be part of a PHP package manager? I'm hesitant on whether it makes sense...\n. I'm going to pass on this for now. Since you can still use it with composer without the composer.json file. Also, 0.4 has been deprecated. Cheers,\n. Resolved with #155 \n. The build was fix with #154 so you can pull down the latest master branch and should be able to run grunt.\nAlso, this functionality exists in 0.3.*, it just hasn't been ported over to 0.4 yet, so I would like to keep it consistent with where the type gets appended.\nSee https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/0.3/src/alertify.js#L286 and screenshot:\n\n. There's conflicts in the PR. The change looks good, I would just rather have spacing around the blocks for legibility and consistency. Also, once the conflict is resolved, could you squash your commits?\njs\n// from:\nclsElShow+\" \"+\"alertify-\"+item.type \n// to:\nclsElShow + \" \" + \"alertify-\" + item.type\n. committing minified source shouldn't create conflicts - but it can be a pain. I've been debatting whether to remove them from source control and I think I will. Closing since you opened a new PR\n. Could you provide more information? I'm not able to reproduce this issue as it's something I know has been implemented.\n- Which alertify.js version are you using?\n- Do you have custom code interacting with it? \n- Browser/OS?\nCan you reproduce on the demo site?\n. If you're able to isolate the problem - or can replicate the bug with sample code, feel free to pass it along and I'll be glad to help out. \nSent from my iPhone\nOn 2013-07-10, at 9:49 PM, devanddesign notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYeah, you're right.

I don't intend on making it a full bootstrap module. If someone wants to fork it and develop/maintain it - that's great! I'll link to it. But the main repo will remain a stand alone widget. I don't want to tie it to any framework in any way. \nThe bootstrap CSS was to show that it could easily be made to look and fit in a bootstrap project with little effort.\n. Closing this issue - if it's still a problem feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. And could you confirm this is with alertify.js 0.3.*...\n. I'm closing this since 0.4 is deprecated.

I never got any emails with attachments - \n. still nothing - send me a DM fabiend.github [at] gmail\n. > Any idea to make a dialog which provides certain items to select\nThat's more of a modal than a dialog. The intention of this library is to replace the native dialogs so at this time that would not really be possible.\n. I'm going to try to get some bug fixes for 0.3 today and if I get a chance I'll try to release a 0.5.0rc1 as well.\n. there is no way to unregister at this time, see: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120\n. Closing. Created - 0.5 branch\n. Released 0.5.0rc1. Usage example can be found here.\nMore documentation and an example site will be up shortly\n. > I find the new dialog is too white\nAgreed. I have an issue opened for it (https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/187) was hoping to get a designer to coming in and help out. Even if only with a visual and not code\n. > such as changing the animation style, customizing alert positioning\nalertify.js was built so only the core was in the JS. These two items are controlled via CSS. The original goal was to build a theme library which would cover various animations and positions but I just never had time or contributions for it -\n. @Alex-Sokolov I haven't been able to reproduce this - any chance you could put a demo together recreating (as basic as possible) the issue.\nI tried including a window.open in a alertify.confirm and after closing the new window and going back to the original page, the dialog was gone and the page was fully usable.\nIf you can't provide a demo, any chance you can provide more info? Browser/OS, does it still happen with 0.3.11 ...\n\n@wizonesolutions, the 0.3.11 fix was for back to back dialogs using AJAX https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/166 - not this one.\n. @wizonesolutions: could you put a demo together that reproduces the error? \n. Can you provide more info (browser, OS, steps to reproduce, code sample)? I've tried using the following code sample and am unable to recreate it:\njs\nalertify.prompt( 'test', function (e) {\n    if (e) {\n        window.open( 'http://google.com' );\n    }\n});\n. Fixed and reset the 0.3.11 tag to include this. Thanks\n. Care to elaborate...\n. Can you provide more info? A demo page, code samples... \n. the library detects if define is used and doesn't expose alertify globally. If you want to use with AMD, you need to include it as a dependency:\njs\ndefine( [ PATH_TO_ALERTIFY ], function ( alertify ) {\n    alertify.success( 'Hi' );\n} );\n. did you also include the alertify.core.css? you need both the core and theme styles.\n. Great\n. not a stupid question - just bad documentation which I will try to update sometime.\nThe extend method allows to generate custom log messages. The parameter custom can be whatever you choose.\nFor example:\n`` js\n// sets a property onalertify` object\nalertify.[anyKeyValueYouWant] = alertify.extend( 'anyStringYouWant' );\n// so you can then write\nalertify.anyKeyValueYouWant( 'custom log message' );\n```\nIn the HTML, this will output:\nhtml\n<!-- notice the extra class, this is the value passed in the extend method -->\n<article class=\"alertify-log alertify-log-anyStringYouWant\">custom log message</article>\nThen in CSS, you can then control the look of those specific messages:\ncss\n.alertify-log-anyStringYouWant {\n    /* overwrite default styles */\n}\nIn short:\n- the string argument passed in the extend method will be used as a class name on the log messages\n- the key value you assign to alertify lets you call it directly.\nSee https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/0.3.*-API-Documentation#extend\nThis is how the success and error methods work - https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/0.3.*-API-Documentation#success--error\nHope that's clear\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. Ruby and Compass are needed to compile Sass into CSS. If you just cloned the project - I would suggest you checkout the 0.3 branch (https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/tree/0.3) since that is latest stable release.\nMaster currently points to 0.4.0rc1 which will never be done. I'm skipping that release and going straight to 0.5.0.\nIn the 0.3.* release, there is no Sass so you will not need ruby or compass.\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. See https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/185#issuecomment-27147210\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. I just put a very basic starting point, I was hoping to get a designer to jump in and help. It will for sure looking much better for the actual 0.5.0 release.\n. Can you double check if this is not just indentation? I generally write CSS with sub styles nested. E.g.\n``` css\n.container {\n}\n.container-child {\n}\n\n```\nwhich can make it seem like the last line is missing a closing } although it is not.\n. Here's the file from that release tag: https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/0.3/themes/alertify.default.css. I don't see any missing }. \n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. I'm going to need more information.. code sample? This error only happens if the JS file hasn't been included.\n. It's a GitHub page and a temporary issue with them. \n. no worries.\n. Thanks - I'll take a closer look when I get a few mins. Could you fix the indentation, tabs, so it is consistent and matching the current 0.3 formatting.\n. There is some indentation issues - e.g.\n\nand\n\nOtherwise it looks good.\n. If you do format the code feel free to reopen the PR. I will merge, but only if it's following the code standards, cheers\n. JavaScript is non blocking which means alertify.js does not block the execution like standard dialogs. You would have to use callbacks to handle it.\nSince it does not block the execution the code continues to run while the alert is shown causing the the focus to be overlooked.\njs\nif (TestCase > 1) {\n    alertify.alert(\"Please make a...\", function () {\n        // this code is only called after the button has been clicked\n        document.EditForm.percent_off_subtotal.focus();\n    });\n}\n. Closing - if you need more help feel free to reopen or open a new issue.\n. There is a .alertify-message class that can be used to left align just the message, if I understand correctly.\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. ``` js\n$(document).ready(function(){\n    $('.delete-page').on('click', function(event){\n        // add me, stop the default link from clicking\n        event.preventDefault();\n    alertify.confirm(\"Message\", function (e) {\n      if (e) {\n          // use window.location and go to a->href\n      } else {            \n        return false; \n      }        \n  });     \n});\n\n});\n```\n. Closing - feel free to reopen if this didn't solve your issue.\n. What version of safari are you seeing this in? \nThe default behaviour is to block access to other elements, could you provide me a sample case with the issue? \n. Thanks - would it be possible to squash your commits? Then I'll merge.\n. Could you provide more information?\n. Thanks for the submission but I've deprecated 0.4. I'm jumping straight to 0.5 which will hopefully turn into a 1.0 and a possibly the end of this project. https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/pull/173\nAlso, warning is not part of the alertify core. You would have to add the warning to alertify for this to be merged. If you want to add it to 0.3 I'll merge.\nExample\nhttps://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/0.3/src/alertify.js#L612\njs\nwarning : function (message, wait) { _alertify.log(message, \"warning\", wait); return this; }\n. Closing - if you want to send the patch to 0.3 I'll merge in there. Cheers\n. thanks for the PR but this isn't the look and feel direction I'm looking for. If you want to keep playing around with styles, feel free to update this PR or even just post screenshots in the issue itself (#187) so we can have some open discussion around the overall direction.\nI'm looking for something much simpler and not as obtrusive. Cheers,\n. the base colour is really more of a \"wireframe\" approach. I want to get a theme before I release 0.5.0 - but I would like to keep it more on the subtle side\n. The div highlighted in the screenshot below covers the alertify dialog (higher z-index) and also has a tabindex of -1. If you simply remove the tabindex attribute you will be able to edit the alertify prompt.\n\nFeel free to reopen if this does not solve your issue.\n. And I should have looked at the stackoverflow link before posting that - \n. Unfortunately not at this time. It may be worth doing in the 0.5.0 release.\n. Thanks for the PR - I do like the idea. There are a few things missing:\n- update the log, success and error methods in the API. (https://github.com/S-anasol/alertify.js/blob/0.3/lib/alertify.js#L622-L625)\n- update the extend method to ensure the functionality can also be used. (https://github.com/S-anasol/alertify.js/blob/0.3/lib/alertify.js#L396-L402)\n. could you provide more info? Version, screenshots, code sample to recreate...\n. When a dialog is open, it creates an invisible cover that will disable all mouse clicks from happening on the underlying site. This is to \"mimic\" the behaviour of native dialogs. \nDialogs are used to force the user to take an action before being able to continue. This is intended behaviour.\n. I think we're talking about the same thing... you're issue is attempting to click a link on the page (behind the dialog)?\nIf so, that is blocked by design. If that's not what you mean - may need to provide a bit more info\n. I misunderstood - log messages should NOT block interaction. If that's what is happening then there could be a bug.\nCould you provide a small code sample that recreates the issue? Also, which version/browser this is happening and I'll take a look \n. I'm in the process of cleaning up the repo - master is currently an old dev version of 0.4 which is deprecated. If your issue is happening in 0.3 you would have to open the PR against that branch.\nThe fix seems strange, I'm looking at reproducing your error - but I'm not able to. The .alertify-logs element is only the size of the log messages and don't interfere with any elements below.\n. I'll investigate - I'm not too familiar with iframe communication so if anyone as more information that would be helpful\n. Does this only happen in IE11? IE10- and other browsers are ok?\n. could you provide a sample recreating this issue? It would make debugging/fixing easier. Thanks\n. No problem! \n. I don't know much about .NET environments, but a few quick things to check -\n1. Could there be another script that is interfering? If you remove all other JS files, does the problem remain?\n2. Double and triple check the path\n3. Are you using AMD (e.g. requirejs)? That would prevent alertify from getting attached to the window object causing it to be undefined.\n. The position of dialogs are currently controlled globally, meaning all dialogs open at the same location. There is no way to open a dialog at a specific location for each trigger element.\nIf this doesn't answer you question - please see the opening issues page and provide more information to have this issue solved.\n. Are you able to reproduce the issue on the example site?\nAnd please see https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/Opening-Issues to provide enough information to be able to get issues resolved in a timely manner.\n. what version of alertify.js are you using? Alertify (uppercase \"A\") was part of 0.4 which is deprecated. I would suggest using 0.3 or 0.5 which uses alertify (lowercase \"a\").\nUsage and examples can be found at: https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki#usage-documentation\n. Could you provide more info? There is an opening issues wiki entry on providing the information needed to quickly resolve the issue. I unfortunately don't have too much free time at the moment, and the more information you provide, the easier it will be for me (or someone else) to help you out.\nExample template from the wiki.

I was debating this myself - in0.3the HTML was inserted via JS, but with0.5` I was leaning towards having it in the DOM by default. Saves the DOM injection which (in a way) makes it slightly faster. \nI'm not married to the idea - I'm open to re-inserting in the JS if it makes sense. But I do like the idea of HTML being HTML. It's a transition towards it being a component.\n. I will - I've never published to NPM (someone did), only bower. I'll update as soon as I get a chance.\n. It is not possible. Alertify.js mimics the native dialogs and the prompt dialog is a single input.\n. I've updated the site (http://fabien-d.github.io/alertify.js/) with a link pointing back to your fork.

This project is no longer being maintained.\nThis is not a feature I would add to the core plugin.

    "kaansoral": "Hi fabien-d, indeed amazing plugin :)\nI've been using alertify a lot lately, and enjoying it, today I tested it on my example phonegap project, using Android 2.3 because that's where all the bugs are and I can't even see any result. There are no errors etc.\nThere are almost no bug reports related to alertify on internet, and couldn't come up with anything adding android to the mix, only this thread. There are no exceptions, I've tried dialogs and log,success's, none of them show anything.\nAny suggestions for a solution?\n. Sorry about the last comment, turns out it was just a case of missing css files, it works great tho, the last stable version.\n. Sorry for the late reply, I was thinking how this could be reproduced, but I guess an android 2.3 device is a must if the problem is indeed what I described it is, so I will experiment a bit, also try the things you suggested and get back here.\n. No improvements, I've tested new version on Android devices, any version I tested seemed buggy, for example on Android 4.2.2, alert log shows but never hides etc, there are that kind of bugs, so I sticked to version 0.3.8\nMost probably the cause of the issues are animations, and android webkit's own bugs\nOn Android 4.2.2, instead of a click issues, the alert logs were showing twice, I managed to reduce it to 1 with these styles:\n.alertify-hide,.alertify-show,.alertify,.alertify-log,.alertify-log-success,.alertify-text{\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n    -webkit-perspective:5000;\n    -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\n}\nGenerally, imo, android versions are really buggy, and to make things work, instead of improvements, one requires workarounds for known bugs, I mostly gave up on Android 2.3's issues, the above fix solved it for 4.2.2\n. alertify is discontinued, I also have similar custom modifications / overriders myself, to fix issues / add features\n.

Hi fabien-d, indeed amazing plugin :)\nI've been using alertify a lot lately, and enjoying it, today I tested it on my example phonegap project, using Android 2.3 because that's where all the bugs are and I can't even see any result. There are no errors etc.\nThere are almost no bug reports related to alertify on internet, and couldn't come up with anything adding android to the mix, only this thread. There are no exceptions, I've tried dialogs and log,success's, none of them show anything.\nAny suggestions for a solution?\n. Sorry about the last comment, turns out it was just a case of missing css files, it works great tho, the last stable version.\n. Sorry for the late reply, I was thinking how this could be reproduced, but I guess an android 2.3 device is a must if the problem is indeed what I described it is, so I will experiment a bit, also try the things you suggested and get back here.\n. No improvements, I've tested new version on Android devices, any version I tested seemed buggy, for example on Android 4.2.2, alert log shows but never hides etc, there are that kind of bugs, so I sticked to version 0.3.8\nMost probably the cause of the issues are animations, and android webkit's own bugs\nOn Android 4.2.2, instead of a click issues, the alert logs were showing twice, I managed to reduce it to 1 with these styles:\n.alertify-hide,.alertify-show,.alertify,.alertify-log,.alertify-log-success,.alertify-text{\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n    -webkit-perspective:5000;\n    -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\n}\nGenerally, imo, android versions are really buggy, and to make things work, instead of improvements, one requires workarounds for known bugs, I mostly gave up on Android 2.3's issues, the above fix solved it for 4.2.2\n. alertify is discontinued, I also have similar custom modifications / overriders myself, to fix issues / add features\n.

This Alertify prototyp coule expose the DOM element through a method or a property (ie. .element(), .el, .getElement() etc.) and have a .close() method.\n```\nfunction() {\n  Alertify = function() {...}\n  Alertify.prototype = {\n    el: null,\n    alert: function() {\n      ...\n      return global;\n    }, \n    close: function() {...}\n  }\n  return global = {\n    alert: function() {\n      return new Alertify().alert();\n    },\n    ...\n    create: function() {\n      return new Alertify();\n    }\n  }\n}\nAlertify.alert('Hello world')\nvar obj = Alertify.create();\nobj.alert('Hello world')\nnew Spinner().spin(obj.el)\nobj.close();\n```\n. I'm not against code separation, but the build process should be optional IMO. One of the things I like about Alertify was that I could bring it in using bower and it worked straight away. So I think that adding the .create() method (or whatever it's called) and, if you do decide to modularise, then include a full build including both dialogs and log messages in the repo.\n.

This is related to my other issue. My use case is this:\n1. User clicks a button that triggers a process that can take a number of seconds.\n2. The system shows a notification that the operation is in progress\n3.

Everybody wants to customize a component to have look and feel based on their app. Having the HTML to be setup separately gives the end developer to make changes to the HTML, which can sometimes make the component to not work because of the changes. And developers will just create issues on github that it is not working because of the customization that they did.
