Never mind, I figured it out.\nIt could just be put into thesave` function.\n. You have to execute the SQL located at elFinder / PHP, then setup the root as you have done. And then it should actually work.\n. It should not be necessary to disable the other roots, as elFinder supports multiple roots.\nDo you get any messages in your error log?\nAlso, do you have any rows in your database elfinder -> elfinder_files ?\n. Do you include the elfinderVolumeMySQL.cass.php file?\nCause I really can not figure out why this would not work.\nDoes the elFinder runs correct with the other roots, ignoring the MySQL root?\n. Can you send me your configuration of elFinder.\nPlease remember to remove passwords and other private informations.\n. Its okay. Glad you got it to work.\nI though you just removed your password from above, to secure that we didn't saw it :smile:\nIf solved, please mark as solved/closed.\n. My guess would be that you went for the FTP Driver, and modified it a little. Maybe made a custom Copy of it for your changes.\nI would guess you would need to change the connect() function and the port.\nGood luck with it.\n. I dont have any server using SFTP, else I would be willing to give it a try.\n. I don't see a problem in that.\nAnyways, here is the License\n. By the way, if you success making it work for SFTP, please release for the future of elFinder.\nAnd if you have any problems with it, let me know.\n. What driver are you using and what is your settings?\n. What do you mean with the file product table?\nCause the FileSystem driver doesn't use any database by default.\n. But it seems like to have modified the FileSystem Driver. In that case I will need to see your driver code in order to help.\n. Thanks a lot @burritodemon.\nThis fixed my issue.\nBut stock into another issue, which might actually be a bug.\n829\nI have tried adding this.disableOnSearch = true; to the reload command without lock. I tried to out-comment the this.alwaysEnabled = true;, but still without any luck.\nAny ideas?\n. This was fixed using the following in the configuration options requestType : 'post'.\nAnd why is this not the default in elFinder? As it can handle much more data than get can do.\n. @prem2\nRequestType should not be inside the roots array.\n. Can you send me a link to your elFinder?

But that is only for the connector.

    "baconbrad": "It is a little bit wild west here on elFinder's Github unfortunately. Fortunately there is a committed handful still working on code and elFinder is widely used. Unfortunately a ton of people use a 2-3 year old version riddled with bugs and vulnerabilities instead of using the one provided here.\n. Also take note using jQuery Migrate allows you to have elFinder compatible with the latest jQuery and jQuery UI.\n. You can also use jQuery Migrate to ensure compatibility.\n. I found my fix for the space issue at #562.\n. Yup, I see how the #562 is not the best method as it just turns spaces into slashes to work with the rest of the code. Will implement #445 instead. Maybe wouldn't hurt to make this an official fix? All though spaces in folders and file names are bad practice, it is extremely common.\n. Do not CMOD it to  777. This could lead to a vulnerability as you are weakening privileges for a file that has direct control of the server. This is also why this restriction is in place as it would allow someone to set Apache settings.\nThis restriction is set via your connector file. Here are the instructions for removing this restriction. If you are using it based on the default connector.php you should delete a line of code that looks like 'accessControl' => 'access'. This tells it to access a function within this script that looks something like this. This is the function that disables access to the .htaccess files.\nPHP\nfunction access($attr, $path, $data, $volume) {\n    return strpos(basename($path), '.') === 0    \n        ? !($attr == 'read' || $attr == 'write')  \n        :  null;                                    \n}\n. Again, I only suggest removing this restriction if it is not going to be accessed by individuals you wouldn't give root access to.\n. And I see this issue https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/169 states that securing PHP files is not an elFinder job. But I think this could expand beyond just PHP and be a general security issue. It would only make sense implementing an official repository fix. Otherwise most implementations of elFinder leave the web server vulnerable to direct attacks, cross site scripting, and more.\n. Everything updated to 2.X nightly branch for my project and it seems to still be an issue. Used @noosalife's code from issue https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/169 for my preferred solution.\nClosing on the basis a solution is available. With this said maybe we can add a modification of the solution in the source as something you can set via the connector.php settings. Maybe more people would be aware of this fix seeing it in the documentation opposed to having to do a search for it or learn from it the hard way. In itself, it would be a nifty feature making another point for being in the official source.\n. What type of connection are you on? I got this issue when I was connected to 3G via a teether from my phone. Smaller files were okay but large files or tons of small files would brick the backend. Connected to WiFi and all went back to normal.\n. I know that elFinder should check your limits via your php.ini but can you double check the upload_max_filesize and make sure it is set higher or unlimited in case elFinder wasn't able to determine the value from ini_get('upload_max_filesize'); in elFinder.class.php.\n. Manually added the edits. I noticed when I click to add a netmount, submit without filling out a hostname, cancel the netmount window, then my elFinder instance is now frozen. Anyone else having this issue?\n. Try running the following jQuery stack in this order. It works great for me.\njquery-1.11.0.min.js\njquery-ui-1.10.4.min.js\njquery-ui-1.10.4.min.css\njquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js <--- required for using recent versions of jQuery with the latest elFinder.\n. Use the above and then link the Touch Punch JS library to add touch support to jQuery UI. http://touchpunch.furf.com/\nEven though this handles UI portions to get touch functionality there is still some mods that need to be done to elFinder for improved usability. I am currently working on trying to improve Touch Punch and elFinder functionality and will post them when I get better results.\n. Since it would require server side archivers then to have this possible the existing archiving options would be possible as well. Hence making the feature redundant since a user can archive and download as a feature already.\nAs for is it possible? Very much so, just make a hybrid of the archive and download code blocks already in. But I wouldn't be surprised if this never becomes a core feature due to the redundancy as stated in my first paragraph.\n. Yes, you can fake a mime type. The secure way to test image types is not by extension or mime types but actually try to get image data only a true image mime type would offer. Most PHP developers have relied on using getimagesize() to best detect a valid image.\nAlternately if you have the ability save all uploads in a folder with a .htaccess file restricting any kind of CGI executing you can make it even more difficult for hackers.\nRemoveHandler .cgi .shtm .shtml\nRemoveType .php .php3 .php4 .php5\n<FilesMatch \"\\.(cgi|p[ly]|php[345]?|[sp]html?)$\">\ndeny from all\n</FilesMatch>\nOptions -ExecCGI -Includes\nAlso, simply opening an image via URL or using an img tag is not enough to execute PHP from an image. They would have to execute it from a PHP script or parser or set the image extension as a PHP mime type. So always display images using the img tag and never as an include or similar method.\n. Additionally, sanitize all data you may pull from an image file if you must use PHP. There is a way to hide PHP in other parts of the image such as the EXIF headers. But again, must be executed via PHP. Typically this exploit requires special arrangement of commands to pull off and you won't see it's use in the wild aside from shared script snippets, WP templates, etc. But it is still a possibility in some setups. - http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/07/malware-hidden-inside-jpg-exif-headers.html\n. If you haven't done it yet enable the extension renaming fix by @noosalife in issue #169 just in case. I found that even if you prevent the PHP mime-type uploads and have restricted access rules for the extension you can fake the mime, upload as a png, and just rename the extension once uploaded. The access rules will lock and hide the PHP file within elFinder but it will sit on the server ready for execution as long as the hacker knows the URL.\nI also found I can bypass the upload restrictions by net mounting a drive, copying a PHP file from my server to the victims. And it completely ignores the upload permissions. The file access rules apply, but again I can execute it as long as I know the URL. My .htaccess snippet above can help prevent it's execution from direct access but I am going to work on a fix when I have a chance this weekend. Even though elFinder is not in charge of preventing PHP attacks I would think it not checking the upload mime-types via copy from another server qualifies that as broken and merits a fix.\n. I wrote a check to see if an image MIME type is legit. My code is highly modded so I can't give line numbers. But check elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php for this code block and replace it with the second code block.\nPHP\n        // logic based on http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#order\n        $allow  = $this->mimeAccepted($mime, $this->uploadAllow, null);\n        $deny   = $this->mimeAccepted($mime, $this->uploadDeny,  null);\n        $upload = true; // default to allow\n        if (strtolower($this->uploadOrder[0]) == 'allow') { // array('allow', 'deny'), default is to 'deny'\n            $upload = false; // default is deny\n            if (!$deny && ($allow === true)) { // match only allow\n                $upload = true;\n            }// else (both match | no match | match only deny) { deny }\n        } else { // array('deny', 'allow'), default is to 'allow' - this is the default rule\n            $upload = true; // default is allow\n            if (($deny === true) && !$allow) { // match only deny\n                $upload = false;\n            } // else (both match | no match | match only allow) { allow }\n        }\n        if (!$upload) {\n            return $this->setError(elFinder::ERROR_UPLOAD_FILE_MIME);\n        }\nReplace with:\nPHP\n        // logic based on http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#order\n        $allow  = $this->mimeAccepted($mime, $this->uploadAllow, null);\n        $deny   = $this->mimeAccepted($mime, $this->uploadDeny,  null);\n        $upload = true; // default to allow\n        if (strtolower($this->uploadOrder[0]) == 'allow') { // array('allow', 'deny'), default is to 'deny'\n            $upload = false; // default is deny\n            if (!$deny && ($allow === true)) { // match only allow\n                $upload = true;\n            }// else (both match | no match | match only deny) { deny }\n        } else { // array('deny', 'allow'), default is to 'allow' - this is the default rule\n            $upload = true; // default is allow\n            if (($deny === true) && !$allow) { // match only deny\n                $upload = false;\n            } // else (both match | no match | match only allow) { allow }\n        }\n        if (strpos($mime, 'image') === 0 && getimagesize($tmpname) === false) {\n            $upload = false;\n        }\n        if (!$upload) {\n            return $this->setError(elFinder::ERROR_UPLOAD_FILE_MIME);\n        }\nNow if they do spoof the MIME type PHP will check it using:\nPHP\n        if (strpos($mime, 'image') === 0 && getimagesize($tmpname) === false) {\n            $upload = false;\n        }\nRemember, this will only validate images. Theoretically the same exploit could be performed if you accept non-image MIMEs and don't perform a check to validate those. If you only request images, you will be fine.\n. JSON is becoming more widely supported now. But at one time not all browsers supported it. As a result browsers did parse them as 'text/html'. Theoretically it is not wrong for all cases. Some cases you can leave yourself to XSS attacks. But in this case I haven't been able to perform one via elFinder. It seems it all encodes as it should.\nIf you are using 2.x you should enable the sanitizer plugin. It is off by default. But using it you can escape special characters as underscores and also help prevent directory traversal. To enable use the code provided in the header of plugins/Sanitizer/plugin.php This would resolve any concerns as it removes the ability to inject characters to cause XSS in the first place.\n. You can actually integrate CodeMirror into the editor. Here is a guide someone posted. You would need to have knowledge of setting up CodeMirror to complete the guide. - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20359471/using-codemirror-as-elfinder-editor\nIf you want to truly have it edited by a another service or window I would look into the code block used by the Pixlr feature in 2.x. It does this but with images. Shouldn't be too difficult to do the same with text files.\nI plan on going about away to open and edit text mime types in a new jQuery tab and saving it back in via the same callback to integrate with an interface I am working on. I just haven't had the chance to get to it yet.\n. Your error call should be like this within that function. this.fm.error() or fm.error() in this case is used to fire the error dialog.\nthis.exec = function(data) {\n        var fm = this.fm,\n        dfrd  = $.Deferred()\n            .fail(function(error) {\n                fm.error(error);\n            })\n        return dfrd;\n    }\n. I planned on creating one using phpseclib ( http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/ ) and PEAR. I have not had a chance to get to it yet or have this on my workbench any time soon. But maybe you can work with it, the examples, and modify an elFinder driver. This library should have every feature needed to complete this driver.  More details on the SFTP API: http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/sftp/intro.html\n. Yes there is. You can do this by adding this.disableOnSearch = true; to a command. Example: Find elFinder.prototype.commands.paste = function() { and add that line as the first line of the function. You can no longer paste if in search mode. Add this accordingly to sections you want to disable while in search mode.\n. Reload is a required command. It is always enabled. There should be an .each code block in the JS file that can be found searching // check required commands. Try removing reload from that array.\n. Are you using 2.X or 2.1 of elFinder and what browser are you working on? @nao-pon has been doing a lot of commits for this section on the 2.1 branch as of late including a few IE fixes. Might be of interest to skim through. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commits/2.1\n. I am on FF so I didn't catch that. Just tested on Chrome and it is broke for me as well. I will see what I can find.\n. This is a plugin with the 2.1 branch called AutoResize. So if you are doing it put this in your connector $opts. I am writing this without testing so if it isn't right let me know.\nPHP\n    'bind' => array(\n        'upload.presave' => array(\n            'Plugin.AutoResize.onUpLoadPreSave'\n        )\n    ),\n    'plugin' => array(\n        'AutoResize' => array(\n        'enable' => true,\n        'maxWidth'  => 1200,\n        'maxHeight'  => 1200,\n        'quality' => 95\n        )\n    ),\n. It looks like elFinder is set up correctly. Otherwise you would get a message saying you can't connect to backend, or file type not allowed, ect. You need to adjust the file/folder permissions on your server to allow modifying/creating/deletion. I don't know your Windows Server OS so I can't give a guide since this method seems to change from version to version.\nAlso, once you get this fixed, you should take down or secure your elfinder.html (or php for others) page. Wanna be hackers like to find this default install file to gain access to a server since it typically doesn't have elFinder restrictions set by default. This is know as the shell upload vulnerability. This doesn't mean elFinder has a security hole. It was just a slight that admins may forget to delete this.\n. If this is a security aspect you should write this condition in your PHP backend and not handle this via clientside scripting.\n. Not surprised. That site has been maintained for years.\n. ",

Hi KurkSS,\nPlease try elFinder 2.1 - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/tree/2.1 ( Nightly build - http://nao-pon.github.io/elFinder-nightly/latests/elfinder-2.1.zip )\nAnd 2.1 support DnD folder uploading with Google Chrome.\n. Branch 2.0-src and 2.1-src are built.\n. elFinder 2.1+ supported CORS over XMLHttpRequest. Demo site is http://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/ .\n. It is implemented in elFinder 2.1.24.. It was on branch 2.1 (#612)\n. ref.  #129\n. Fixed on elFinder 2.1.3 .\n. I think it need escape.\nex. edit.js line 39\n``` javascript\nta   = $(''+fm.escape(content)+''),\n```\n. I got it.\n. @vongruenigen Please try & check with nightly build.\n. @vongruenigen I made JS Bin of PHP connector API 1.0. Please check it.\n. I came up with one of the ideas. Please try newest nightly build.\n. @vongruenigen You are welcome, don't worry. :-)\n. Thanks for marge !\nSince I speak only Japanese, there are few texts. \nHowever, there is a lot of gratitude. \n. It is comprehension. \nThe date was set to  @ version . \n. > We have wait until user selects a folder where to download file?\nDo not wait user select, but we cannot delete \"iframe\" until the dialog is displayed.\nSince I made the movie of reference, please see youtube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW6MlLhkQa0\nThe file of the last processed after \"iframe\" was deleted was not saved without displaying a preservation place selection dialog. \nAlthough it is difficult to decide the required number of seconds per file, a certain amount of time is required. \n. You are welcome! \nThank you for your consideration.\n. Yes, it understood. It wrote promptly for my project (xelFinder [elFinder for XOOPS]). However, it is better not to use a third party's plug-in, and I think so as well.\n. Oh! It's so cool!!\n. About \"Radio buttons markup\"\nHow about \"jQuery UI\"?\nhttp://xoops.hypweb.net/modules/xelfinder/index.php/view/98/image_rotate.png\n. Thanks for marge. By the way, about opera. My opera is \"Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; U; ja) Presto/2.6.30 Version/10.60\" that is work fine. What is your tested opera version? I control according to a version.\n. I tested Opera \"Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; U; ja) Presto/2.10.229 Version/11.61\". I saw same problem. so I will disable animate with opera. \n. I made mistake  previous commit. I redoes.\n. I think Edit image mean including photo retouch. How about Resize & Rotate?\n. Thanks for marge & your works. :-D\n. This is wonderful! I completed merge.\n. Thanks for everythings, hahaha. :-D\n. It is OK. \nI am looking forward to being taken into 2.1. Till then, it includes in xelFinder (XOOPS's module) and sees a situation. :-)\n. Use #238 URL upload function.\n. Wow!\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\uff01(Nihongo wo arigatou!)\nThank you for using Japanese! \n. Yes, I think that it is a good idea. I consider how to carry out full separation. However, it will take time. ;-)\n. Hi MrGorki,\npixlr_edit is not merged into 2.x or 2.1. But you can use it on 2.1_n branch.

Please re-post into nao-pon/elFinder/issues.\n. oops! 2.x had this problem, I fixed it. (@60ce68418b) \n. This affair is considered to be a problem of a .NET connector. It may solve, if you ask the .NET connector side.\n. Hi  abrenoch,\nThanks for your solution. I fixed it. :-)\n. Hi Chuck,\nSince a single touch cannot be made into a selective state and a menu (tool bar) cannot be used, a double touch (selection + open) is required.\n. About scrolling, I think that it does not work by Android 2.x. It is working in Andorid 4.2.2 and iOS 6.1.4.\n. Thamks! :-)\n. Now merged branch '2.x' ( 453f3274b6 ). So it can merges automatically. How is this request?\n. I found this problem when testing FTP netmount volume. And I verified this fix. But I thought this problem is important. so I desired other persons' verification. It is OK if nobody can discover a mistake about this fix. :-)\n. I found this problem when testing FTP netmount volume. And I verified this fix.

Hi 0010,\nPlease access to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create, and set \"Full Dropbox\" and choice \"Core\" & \"Full Dropbox\".\nGood luck! :+1: \n. Hi, 0010\nPrease try \"NetMount\" like this -> http://youtu.be/S1Q_jGIwrzY\nDropbox driver (with NetMount) use session value, this session key is 'elFinderNetVolumes' (as default).\nYou save the value of \"$SESSION '[elFinderNetVolumes]'\" by a certain method (for example, in a log function), By assigning the value to \"$SESSION '[elFinderNetVolumes]'\" at the time of a new session, \"Net Volume\" can be used continuously. \nP.S.\nI enabled Dropbox driver on my \"2.x_n\" demo site.( http://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/2.x_n/elfinder.html ) Please try it.\n. Thanks 0010,\nIs an old file the past history file? There is no function which displays the deleted file for the moment. \nDo you have any ideas for how displaying them on elFinder? \n. Hi,\nI understood. Maybe I made mistake, so I corrected this problem. (@3750ae8)\nHow is newly version. ( My demo site ) Please try cwd refresh. (Press [F5]) \n. Hi,\nSince delta acquired the whole data, what is cached on a memory was the approach which is not good. \nNow, using PDO (sqlite), I am making a program change so that it may cache in a database. \nPlease try on my DemoSite. (It is still a draft) \n. Thanks,\nWhen using \"metadata\", it is necessary to perform \"metadata\" about all the directories included to a directory. I had got data by \"metadata\" at first.\nHowever, the response had dissatisfaction. Then, the data obtained by \"delta\" was saved at temporary file, and when displaying, it was processing by developing on a memory.\nAcquisition of \"delta\" is performed, when a user links with dropbox for the first time and uses. Data acquisition takes time to the first time. However, from the 2nd time, it is very quick. \nThis time, the reason I chose PDO (SQLite) is that it can use as standard after PHP 5.1. Furthermore, it is because it thought that handling of a database file was also easy. The database file was made to be taken as another file for each users.\nThe next place has a Dropbox PDO type. \nhttps://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder/tree/dropbox_sqlite\n[ja]\n\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\uff01\n\"metadata\" \u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u5834\u5408\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u306b\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308b\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u5168\u3066\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 \"metadata\" \u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u79c1\u306f\u3001\u6700\u521d\u306f\"metadata\"\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5f97\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30ec\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u4e0d\u6e80\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u3053\u3067\u3001\"delta\" \u3067\u5f97\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u4fdd\u5b58\u3057\u3001\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u6642\u306b\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u4e0a\u306b\u5c55\u958b\u3057\u3066\u51e6\u7406\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\"delta\" \u306e\u53d6\u5f97\u306f\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u521d\u3081\u3066 dropbox \u3068\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u3057\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306b\u884c\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u521d\u56de\u306f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53d6\u5f97\u306b\u6642\u9593\u3092\u8981\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u30012\u56de\u76ee\u304b\u3089\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u30af\u30a4\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u4eca\u56de\u3001\u79c1\u304c PDO(SQLite) \u3092\u9078\u629e\u3057\u305f\u7406\u7531\u306f\u3001PHP 5.1 \u4ee5\u964d\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u6a19\u6e96\u3067\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u53d6\u6271\u3044\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306f\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u6bce\u306b\u5225\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\nDropbox PDO \u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u6b21\u306e\u5834\u6240\u306b\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 https://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder/tree/dropbox_sqlite\n[/ja]\n.

For example\n``` php\nfunction accessCtr($attr, $path, $data, $volume) {\n    $rootReg = preg_quote(rtrim('[ROOT ABSOLUTE PATH]', '/') .

Please re-open if there is a similar problem by checking in elFinder 2.1.\n. In accordance with the respective environment, please coordinate your CSS.\n. Thanks!\n. @SplicePHP elFinder 2.1 is using jQuery UIui-front`.\nref. https://api.jqueryui.com/theming/stacking-elements/\n. elFinder 2.1 FTP driver supported IIS FTP server. Please use elFinder 2.1 with FTP driver.\n. Thanks!\n. On elFinder 2.1.x, we can now add any item to the info dialog. Take advantage of its features.\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/140054e12682c9f7fbc16f8d33ff91b824002c32/js/elFinder.options.js#L220\nConnector side should be its own override.\n. @yarons Please use elFInder 2.1 and set volume root options encoding, locale.\n. oops! I fixed it! Thanks!!\n. May be it is not bug.\n. @adisos \nphp\nfunction debug() {\n    $arg = func_get_args();\n    ob_start();\n    foreach($arg as $v) {\n        var_dump($v);\n    }\n    $o = ob_get_contents();\n    ob_end_clean();\n    file_put_contents('debug.txt', $o, FILE_APPEND);\n}\npublic function mySimpleCallback($cmd, $result, $args, $elfinder) {\n    // Check debug.txt\n    debug($result);\n}\n. probably is not bug of elFinder.\n. There is a possibility that a custom parameter of session ID etc are included in URL. Therefore I think URL should be hidden.\nYou can find Item's URL at Link: in Info dialog.\n. Hi,\n\"elFinder 2.x\" In the official site, it is as \"RC1\" for a long time. \nHowever, many bugs are corrected on the repository. \nMany also of the problem reported by Issues are fixed with solution in the latest version. \nI will think that it is good, if the latest version is exhibited in an official site. \nHowever, I do not have the authority. \n(Machine translation) \n. Thank you! elFinder is an open source project. We are waiting for the better code, the defect report, the functional improvement proposal, etc.!\n. Hi,\nHow about this solution -> 858ef697926e776459e11f8c49f55bc4162dbcd9 ? \n. This is not a bug. Please see wiki (https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Integration-with-TinyMCE-4.x)\n. If elFInder DOM ID is \"elfinder\".\njavascript\njQuery('#elfinder').elfinder('instance').exec('reload');\n. Hi,\nPlease see Wiki - Build and compress elfinder from source\nOR\nMy Nightly builds (not official) - Although it is not stable, but it's always new.\n. To measure the recursively size, it takes a very large cost. Please use the disk quota of the operating system.\n. Please to check with the latest version of elFinder.\n. Probably elFinder 2.1 has not this problem.\n. @jtsjunior In the latest of elFinder seems no problem.\n. Hi, marche\nplease try next solutions (replace filesize($tmpname) to sprintf(\"%u\", filesize($tmpname)))\nelFinderVolumeDriver.class.php (elFinder 2.1 branch)\nL.1429\nphp\n        if ($this->uploadMaxSize > 0 && filesize($tmpname) > $this->uploadMaxSize) {\n            return $this->setError(elFinder::ERROR_UPLOAD_FILE_SIZE);\n        }\nto\nphp\n        if ($this->uploadMaxSize > 0 && sprintf(\"%u\", filesize($tmpname)) > $this->uploadMaxSize) {\n            return $this->setError(elFinder::ERROR_UPLOAD_FILE_SIZE);\n        }\nL.1452\nphp\n        $stat = array(\n            'mime'   => $mime, \n            'width'  => 0, \n            'height' => 0, \n            'size'   => filesize($tmpname));\nto\nphp\n        $stat = array(\n            'mime'   => $mime, \n            'width'  => 0, \n            'height' => 0, \n            'size'   => sprintf(\"%u\", filesize($tmpname)));\n. Umm.. It seems to be restriction of a 32-bit system.\nMay be you should recompile your php with the CFLAGS=\"-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64\" ./configure etc...\n. @santaclaus21 If your php running on 32bit operating system, May be maximum upload size is 2GB. Please set connector roots option uploadMaxSize to '2GB'.\nIf you want to use more than 2GB, please use a 64bit operating system.\n. @Inkperial Maybe path is wrong.\n. You can use bind.\n. @AngelDi Please use elFinder translation tool and send PR.\n. Thanks for your request. Natural sort supported at 0ccfe56c09ad99b844d69a46d710fa96238ebedf. \"Autoresize\" function is supported in 2.1 branch's PHP connector plugin \"AutoResize\".\n.

Oh, Is it this?\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.1/js/elFinder.version.js#L6\nI'll fix it. :-)\n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.1/php/elFinder.class.php#L19\nThis is API version. I think it's OK for the time being.\n(wow It's a miracle (BBC)! :-D)\n. I did a pull request.(#937) It would become possible to be to designate encoding, locale of a volume option and connect non-UTF-8 to a server.\nA movement test is performed for a while, and when there are no problems, I'm planning to merge with 2.1.\n. It closes with #937 (new volume options encoding, locale)\n. 1.2 is no longer maintained. Therefore here is closed.\nelFinder 2.1 can deal with large-volume folder and file. There is a possibility that you can solve problems by using 2.1. But, it would be necessary to use a server of 64bit system.\n. Please try elFinder 2.1 and please re-open this issue if you get same problem.\n. May be, PHP output error messages. Please check your server response with developer tools.\u3000AND Please check it by nightly build.\n. I am going to gonna link icon beside the download menu.\n. elFinder 2.1 was fixed it.\n. There is only way to disable paste command.\n. HI!\nI think it's better for the history not to be eliminated by Reload, too. But that's cleared specifically by a program code. I don't know why that's cleared. umm...\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/3dc406c9adc480c6d68ff874f9953ebc50322b48/js/elFinder.history.js#L110\neasy to fix\njavascript\n.reload(reset);\nto\njavascript\n.reload(/*reset*/);\n.

Thanks for your descriptions.\n. This issue is not a bug. so close. But please advise continuously.\n. Please let us know the appropriate switch.\n. Oh! I missing. I wrote into #957.\n. Must be able to either of these commands are executed on the server. (Tar, zip, unzup, rar, 7z, 7za)\n\nIn or elFinder 2.1 PHP ZipArchive Class is also available.\n. - What's your elFinder version? Please check with nightly version.\n- Which VolumeDriver uses?\n- Can PHP uses server command tar, zip, rar, 7za or 7z ?\nPlease check #957, #977 too.\n. Did you check with nightly version? If you are able to upload and make file or folder, maybe any archive command unavailable on your server.\n. MySQL driver included in elFinder can't save contents in the file system. What driver do you use?\n. Make your own driver to inherit the class \"elFinderVolumeMySQL\" or use the command bind.\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#user-content-bind\nBecause it is not a elFinder issue to close it.\n. Problem of the details I do not know.\n. Thanks @pelikanek\nI rewritten  Wiki page ( https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Integration-with-CKEditor ).\nwindow.opener.CKEDITOR.tools.callFunction(funcNum, file.url);\nor\nwindow.opener.CKEDITOR.tools.callFunction(funcNum, file);\n?\nsee https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#commandsoptions \ncommandsOptions.getfile.onlyURL = false is file.url\ncommandsOptions.getfile.onlyURL = true is file\n. \"elFinder\" doesn't have the user administrative function, so it's necessary to use it according to the other platforms.\nThose generate the option which gives it to elFinder on connector.php by the user login information dynamically.\nA connector for XOOPS (CMS) I have developed is the next.\n- https://github.com/nao-pon/xelfinder/blob/master/xoops_trust_path/modules/xelfinder/connector.php\n. When BASIC authentication of Apache is used, a login user name is obtained in $_SERVER ['PHP_AUTH_USER'], so I think it's the simplest way to use that.\nAnd\u3000you can use attributes volume option. ( https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Simple-file-permissions-control )\n. There is Basic Auth example -> http://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/#elf_l1_QmFzaWNBdXRoRXhhbXBsZQ\n. @MrGorki\nI think lazy loading of tree is difficult. A rendering was sped up in a compensation. In 2.1 branch at 760a4156526119f377e0286555af6e36f08284ea .\n. @DavidDomain Thanks!\n. Please check the settings for the upload of PHP.\n. @phongdatgl I checked with elFinder 2.1.2. I could not see this problem.\n. exec ('open') must stat information of the target folder is loaded. There are following solutions instead.\njavascript\nhandlers : {\n    load: function(event, elfinderInstance) {\n        elfinderInstance.request({\n            data   : { cmd : 'open', target : custom_hash_directory },\n            notify : { type : 'open', cnt : 1, hideCnt : true }\n        });\n    }\n}\n. @4Giedrius elFinder 2.1 supported non-utf8 server's file system encoding and locale by the volume options. ref: Volume option encoding, locale\nPlease try elFinder 2.1 Nightly build.

Please check in my demo site.\nDemo site: http://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/2.1/#elf_l2_Lw\n. How about a result on my demo site? If there are no problems, I guess conflicting by the other Java Scripts which are loading on your site.\n. utf8_encode supported only ISO-8859-1 so it isn't possible to accept this request.\nOn 2.1 branch has Volume root options encoding and locale.

Please check the CSS of the page.\n. @lokothodida Thanks!\nI think the option name startDirHash is more better. What do you think?\n. OK. I thought again. May be name startPathHash is best. Because connector options has startPath. Please change name to startPathHash for merge this PR. :-)\n. Thanks! :-)\n. Please check with elFinder 2.1+ . Close for a while.\n. I started to develop this function. By specifying the hash ID which becomes trash box in setting volume roots, when deleting items, move to trash box with original directory hierarchy.. @ERROPiX The trash is mounted as one of the volumes, and when deleting, the directory hierarchy is reproduced to the volume and moved. To restore is re-move from the trash by the user's operation.\n@donShakespeare The trash is specified by the hash value on elFinder as an option of each volume. You can specify the same one, but usually you specify another one.. oops! I made mistake. I'll fix it. This problem get with jQuery UI < 1.11.0\n. @lokothodida Thanks! :+1: fixed on 65e22ac565491b4a43af785317be97ddf7e34b3d\n. @lokothodida , @esyede Thanks!\nISO_639-1 says \"Indonesian\" is \"id\". so I think \"elfinder.id.js\" is more better.\n.

Hi, @buckett , @megadr01d.\nI think so too. However , I do not have permission to release...\n. After a review of our my authority, administrative privileges had been granted. Now, I can manage the version.\nFrom now, I will contact to @dio-el-claire.\n. elFinder 2.0.3 and 2.1.0 released. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/releases :v: \n. We are waiting for the cooperation of everyone. Please send your translation from our translation tool.\n. @santaclaus21 , @megadr01d Thanks!\nAdded a new connector config uploadTempPath into 2.1 branch.\nphp\n$opts = array(\n    'locale' => '',\n    'uploadTempPath' => 'PATH TO UPLOAD TEMP',\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n        )\n    )\n);\n. @santaclaus21 option uploadTempPath is Main option, It is not Root option. ( https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1 )\nuploadTempPath: Main option. It's shared by all volumes.\ntmpPath: Each Root option. Temporary directory for extracts etc.(I edited Wiki)\n. And I added error handling of chunked upload @1c005968360f7d4cb0e9baf3fc264d6d6ad88afd .\n. 'uploadTempPath' is setting of elFinder temp files path. This file name has 'ELF' as prefix. Do you want control of PHP temp files (maybe has 'PHP' as prefix) path?\nAbout debug\n- use  error_reporting(E_ALL); and check server responce\n- use debug($target); with next code in connector.php\nphp\nfunction debug($var) {\n    ob_start();\n    //debug_print_backtrace();\n    var_dump($var);\n    $out = ob_get_clean();\n    file_put_contents('PATH_TO/debug.txt', $out . \"\\n\", FILE_APPEND);\n}\nEdited:\nupload_tmp_dir is PHP_INI_SYSTEM. Entry can be set in php.ini or httpd.conf.\n. My guess, PHP doesn't have a writable permission of your files directory.\n. @appqui Thanks!\n. s3 driver looks unfinished. Please try League\\Flysystem. \n. @barryvdh might know.\n. @Azenet Thanks!\n. At present, it is not possible to display the link that shows the outside\nof the volume root. I believe in order to allow it. Please wait...\n. @Raven3419 , @megadr01d Thanks! Fixed on 2.1 branch.\n. @Raven3419, I found bugs of this problem so I'll fix it. Please wait a little longer.\n. Maybe fixed @e07c8222db4680124adb4854dcdf45685763c89b .

I added package.json to 2.0-src and 2.1-src. Is This OK?\n. :+1: \n. I think that's a rare cases thing to disable the glob() so to close this issue.\n. Currently, we are using a blob in elFinder in seven locations. There is a need to mask the results of scandir for each occurrence.\n\nPHP 5.2.4 and later does not have a directory traversal vulnerability, such as before. It is one of the also solutions to propose a re-examination of the set to the server administrator.\n. ref. #27\n. Please try the FTP driver.\n. elFinder 2.1.10 will supports API version 1 connector.\nref. #1270 \n. @Tiega91 please try elFinder-Inctance.disable()\n``` javascript\nvar f = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n  url : 'path_to/connector.minimal.php'\n}).elfinder('instance');\n// call any point for disable elFinder's hotkeys\nf.disable();\n```\n.

Hi @ichuot,\n\nabout icon\nPlease set absolute URL to option icon. However, I think a good idea to add a CSS class of options (for example rootclass).\nADD: You can define ELFINDER_IMG_PARENT_URL in connector.php for using absolute URL.\nphp\ndefine('ELFINDER_IMG_PARENT_URL', 'http://example.com');\nicon URL became http://example.com/img/volume_icon_local.png.\nabout white-space: pre-wrap\nSince the file name in the 2.1 two lines can be displayed has to pre-wrap. What problem are you having?\nabout $this->getFullPath\nPlease try the volume option systemRoot. (For example 'C: \\', 'D: \\', etc.)\n. about icon\nI'll fix on next commit. It uses css class name.\nabout &#8203;\n&#8203; It will be used for character wrapping. Value of the title attribute is a bug.It will be fixed next commit.\nabout white-space: pre-wrap\n\npre-wrap with 2 lines can not display \"...\" at last line.\n\nI am aware. However, no alternative is found.\n. @o771 There is a option fileMode in the LocalFileSystem volume driver.\nfor example\nphp\narray(\n    'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',   // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n    'fileMode'      => 0755,  // permission of the new file\n    'path'          => '../files/',         // path to files (REQUIRED)\n    'URL'           => dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) . '/../files/', // URL to files (REQUIRED)\n    'accessControl' => 'access'             // disable and hide dot starting files (OPTIONAL)\n)\n. @barryvdh Thanks!\nI was well understood. However, now I am turning the script, such as automatic build and packaging, I am worried that does not occur mistake in their modification.\nComposer require studio-42 / elfinder: \"dev-2.1-src\" In how about you?\n. Sorry my poor English.\nI'm afraid to make a mistake the correction of scripts, such as automated build etc. in my server. But this is my personal problem. It may be time-consuming, but will consider the modification.\n. I changed branch names.\n- 2.x-src - Main development branch\n- 2.1-src - 2.1 development branch\n- 2.0-src - 2.0 development branch\n- 2.1 - 2.1 nightly build branch\n- 2.0 - 2.0 nightly build branch\n.

It can generate code when you click the \"make it\" button after editing.\n. Hi @Diablo925 :smile: \nPlease check connector configuration acceptedName.\nDefault value of acceptedName is '/^[^\\.].*/'. It is the file name that begins with a dot will not be allowed.\nBy the way, it is very dangerous to allow this in an environment that is not strictly controlled. Please carefully set.\n. @MazeChaZer ooooops! oh my.... fixed it. Thanks a lot!\u3000:v: \n. $tmpfile file made by tempnam() with permission 0600. I propose a change to chmod($tmpfile, 0644);.

Oh, what are you want to specify the route holder on elFinder for each user?

Thanks! :+1: \n. ref. #1156 closes.\n. @kirakhaos elFinder sends HTTP header \"Content-Disposition: inline\" by image, text and flash only. And this is not configurable. So I'll make to configurable it by volume driver option.\nThanks!\n. I seem to have been misread. Is this issue miss the detection of file type?\n. If you want to correct the MIME type of detection,\u3000There is an option mimeMap in Volume driver options.\ndefault is\nphp\n// mime type normalize map : Array '[ext]:[detected mime type]' => '[normalized mime]'\n'mimeMap'         => array(\n                     'md:application/x-genesis-rom' => 'text/x-markdown',\n                     'md:text/plain'                => 'text/x-markdown',\n                     'markdown:text/plain'          => 'text/x-markdown',\n                     'css:text/x-asm'               => 'text/css'\n                    ),\n. @barryvdh Thanks! :+1: \n. @AlgirdasR Thanks! :+1: \n. @alsantos123 You can modify array $result in callback.\nfor exmple\nphp\nif (!empty($result['added']) {\n    foreach($result['added'] as $i => $v) {\n        $result['added'][$i]['write'] = 1;\n    }\n}\n. :+1: \n. @Hammur20 Thanks for your job. :+1: \n.

Can you send a pull request that created a branch from the current master branch?\n. @lonejack The connector always calling stat() of root when volume mount on each request, so it must return the session cache except reload of the current volume for not to lower the performance on multi volumes. So, I would like to maintain the logic of the current stat().\n. @lonejack , @barryvdh OK! I will add a session handler to the option of elFinder instance.\n. @lonejack I chose (2). It has created a branch(session) for this. And it is being considered the interface definition. The idea is in the recruitment at any time!\n. @lonejack Thanks! I will commit the prototype in a few days. Please advice to see it.\n. @lonejack , @barryvdh I pushed @2bbcc67646f5208832fd61df928958425d2965d0 to branch session. Please check out. :-)\n. Such as base64 encoded was implemented for a connector option base64encodeSessionData of elFinder.  I think so, that certainly not needed in much case. So it is not required in its own wrapper.\n. elFinder 2.1.8 supported custom session handling wrapper. (https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#session-218) \n. @barryvdh It's so cool! :+1: \n. @mlerman It began.

I'll fix it.\n. @suiluj Thanks! :+1: \n. @suiluj I tried, but this is not a problem. Please let us know your volume settings.\n. I know at #1243 that your elfinder is old version. This problem is probably resolved in the latest version. Therefore, to close once, but if there is a similar problem with the latest version, please re-open.\nPS. startPath settings you can specify only one of several volumes.\n. This issue was fixed at #1174. Thanks!\n. @aihimel This is a specific problem of WordPress. You must be fix in a plugin of WordPress.\n.

It has been used in such as confirmation of the file information in the pre-flight of the other commands.\nPlease monitor the communication with the server in order to know the timing of the command execution.\n. @paulcanning Thanks! :+1: \n. @paulcanning There is in source code of elFinder.class.php.\n. Unfortunately cannot provide immediately, so that document is not written.\n. I edited section bind of Wiki.\n. @tugh Thanks! Is it needed \"_CN\"? I'm sorry if it is rude. Because I don't know well.\n. @tugh Thanks! :+1: \n. @gabsource Thanks! :+1: \n. We do not have a plan to create a bootstrap version.\n. > \"error\": [\"errOpen\", \"default folder\", \"errFolderNotFound\"]\n@tugh This mean that '../files/' is not found or not readable.\n. Please try set connector option locale to your server supported local.\nYou can see server locales with locale -a in server shell. or use showlocale.php.\n. [mime] => unknown is strange. What result is <?php echo is_dir('/disk/htdocs/xjadwokat.com/elfinder/el/files')? 'true' : 'false'; ?>? \n. I found bug of currently master may be. Please try\nphp/elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php L.470\nphp\n        if ($dir = is_dir($path) && $this->options['detectDirIcon']) {\nto\nphp\n        if (($dir = is_dir($path)) && $this->options['detectDirIcon']) {\n. Maybe fixed. Please reopen if you are having the same problem.\n. @dneykov \nThe Wiki offers a Lazy Load, but to be precise is Lazy Rendering. From the server you will receive all of the items at one time. Lazy function of Rendering is working without any problems.\n. @fastesol Please try composer require dropbox-php/dropbox-php:dev-master@dev And use newest nightly And define \"token\" and \"token secret\" And set  in your connector.php.\ne.g.\nphp\n// load composer autoload.php\nrequire './vendor/autoload.php';\n// define Dropbox tokens\ndefine('ELFINDER_DROPBOX_CONSUMERKEY',    'YOUR KEY');\ndefine('ELFINDER_DROPBOX_CONSUMERSECRET', 'YOUR SECRET');\n// enable netmount\nelFinder::$netDrivers['dropbox'] = 'Dropbox';\n. OR e.g. to static mount\nphp\n// load composer autoload.php\nrequire './vendor/autoload.php';\n$roots = array(\n    'driver'            => 'Dropbox',\n    'consumerKey'       => 'CONSUMER KEY',\n    'consumerSecret'    => 'CONSUMER SECRET',\n    'accessToken'       => 'ACCESS TOKEN',\n    'accessTokenSecret' => 'ACCESS TOKEN SECRET',\n);\n. @fastesol Can you check server response on error of GoogleDrive?\n. @fastesol Please close this issue, And make a new issue of GoogleDrive problem.\n. @paulcanning What about dynamically multi volume?\nphp\n$groupDir = '/path/to/group_dir/';\n$userDir = '/path/to/user_dir/';\nphp\n'roots'  => array(\n    array(\n        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'   => '/path/to/public_dir/',\n        'alias'  => 'Public',\n    ),\n    array(\n        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'   => $groupDir,\n        'alias'  => 'Group',\n    ),\n    array(\n        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'   => $userDir,\n        'alias'  => 'Private',\n    ),\n)\n. Well smartest way I think it make the driver to return to the GCS any folder appropriate tree based on the login information.\n. I think it is not as simple can be explained here. I have to tell as one of the ideas.\n. This is one of the tips.\n``` php\nfunction debug() {\n    $arg = func_get_args();\n    ob_start();\n    foreach($arg as $v) {\n        var_dump($v);\n    }\n    $o = ob_get_contents();\n    ob_end_clean();\n    file_put_contents('debug.txt', $o, FILE_APPEND);\n}\nfunction access($attr, $path, $data, $volume) {\n    debug($attr, $path, $data);\n    // you can check args value in ./debug.txt\n    $allow = true; // or $allow = false;\n    if ($allow) {\n        return ($attr === 'read' || $attr === 'write'); //read,write: true, locked,hidden: false\n    } else {\n        return !($attr === 'read' || $attr === 'write'); //read,write: false, locked,hidden: true\n    }\n}\n// add config 'accessControl' => 'access' to volume root option\n``\n. @YanMagale You can use [bind]() tochange` event.\ne.g.\n``` javascript\nvar elfinderInstance = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    url : 'php/connector.php',\n}).elfinder('instance');\n(function() {\n    var tm;\n    elfinderInstance.bind('change', function(e) {\n        var file;\n        if (e.data.changed && e.data.changed.length === 1) {\n            file = e.data.changed[0];\n            if (file.mime.indexOf('text/') === 0 && file.size == 0) {\n                tm && clearTimeout(tm);\n                tm = setTimeout(function() {\n                    alert('Content is empty');\n                }, 10);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n})();\n```\n. It was a little different from my post of last time. Your issue to resolve might may want to define a new editing function in the editing options.\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/775acaeaf9b1f3ca868e42547f8559090fb4dc0c/js/elFinder.options.js#L193-L244\n. @fastesol Please use stable release or nightly build.\n. @paulcanning This might be a problem of flysystem-google-storage adapter. Can you see the raw data of flysystem-google-storage adapter of the output result?\n. Other adapter (GoogleDrive, Dropbox) of Flysystem In There is no similar problem. I think probably there is a problem with the GoogleCloud adapter side.\n. @baturman Which version of elfinder-flysystem-driver are you using? Please check with latest version.\n. Probably this is not a problem of elFinder.\n. @paulcanning elFinder is caching root stat. That cache key is volume ID and Path. In your case, path is same in each volume. I'll also add 'alias' as key.\nAnother way is to be set a config id of volume root.\ne.g.\nphp\n{\n    $this->load->helper('path');\n    $opts = array(\n        'roots' => array(\n            array(\n                'id' => 'gt',\n                'driver' => 'Flysystem','\n                'alias' => 'GCS thumb',\n                'URL' => 'https://storage.googleapis.com/thumbnails/',\n                'filesystem' => new Filesystem($this->googleCloud('adgen-dev-thumbnails')),\n                'separator' => '/'\n            ),\n            array(\n                'id' => 'ga',\n                'driver' => 'Flysystem',\n                'alias' => 'GCS assets',\n                'URL' => 'https://storage.googleapis.com/assets/',\n                'filesystem' => new Filesystem($this->googleCloud('assets')),\n                'separator' => '/'\n            ),\n            array(\n                'id' => 'gr',\n                'driver' => 'Flysystem',\n                'alias' => 'GCS rss',\n                'URL' => 'https://storage.googleapis.com/rss/',\n                'filesystem' => new Filesystem($this->googleCloud('rss')),\n                'separator' => '/'\n            )\n        )\n    );\n    $this->load->library('elfinder_lib', $opts);\n}\n. Default value of path is '/'. ref. https://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver/blob/master/src/Driver.php#L58-L66\n. GCS adapter use StreamedReadingTrait. Please check to tmpfile() in your server.\n. Sorry I made a mistake. readStream() used in copy or move. edit uses read().\nThere are breakpoints for debugging.\n- vendor/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver/src/Driver.php _getContents()\n- vendor/superbalist/flysystem-google-storage/src/GoogleStorageAdapter.php read()\n. Maybe saveCE() called by LocalFileSystem driver. I think it can not read contents from GCS. Please check content data from the GCS adapter is able to get.\nAbout path, I think In elfinder-flysystem-driver, it does not problem if you do not specify path. The Flysystem will process properly based on the path that is a option of Flysystem abapter. On Dropbox, GoogleDrive adapter, there is no problem even if it dose not specify the path.\n. Probably this is not a problem of elFinder.\n. Probably this problem is same reason to #1300.\n. @svetlanadzhura Probably this problem was fixed @7a4d8202e8ba16c3c4d54d5297f977d5629d8463. Please try check on nightly build.\n. @paulcanning Your problem seems to be another problem with this.\u3000Please make new issue. Thanks.\n. @svetlanadzhura Can you show me your connector configuration? Are you using newest nightly?\n. @svetlanadzhura I checked with connector root option ``'disabled' => ['extract', 'create', 'zipdl'], That is no problem. Please check in elFinder latest nightly as standalone.\n. @paulcanning In first post in this issue.\n\nIf you select multiple files and click download, it says 'Unknown command'.\n\nAre you seen 'Unknown command' dialog?\n. @paulcanning Yes, your case is a problem in zipdl command. Please attach a server response of zipdl command when creating new issue.\n. @svetlanadzhura  Today elFinder 2.1.10 released. Please check with 2.1.10. Thanks.\n. @svetlanadzhura Thanks! :+1: \n. Problem in the response of zipdl seems not. Can you download on the demo site? Also, please try in elFinder of stand-alone in your server.\n. Do you try elFinder alone? Is connetor url \"http://localhost/fileportal/index.php/ex_cont/elfinder_init\"? Please show me your connector.php and elfinder.html.\n. Please install elFinder by next steps, and test alone without integrate with other systems.\n1. Download latest nightly and unzip to your PHP server\n2. Rename /php/connector.minimal.php-dist to /php/connector.minimal.php\n3. Load /elfinder.html in your browser to run elFinder\n. I added Archive(zip|gzip|tar) quicklook preview plugin. Thanks!\n. @pateljaykesh Please try 'uploadOrder' => array('deny', 'allow'),\n. What about @c2b69e4?\n. Close it, because there is no response.\n. I added link to your theme repository into https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder#3rd-party-themes . Thanks! :+1: \n. @vkirpa If  special characters are '\\','/',':','*','?','\"','<','>','|', you can use Sanitizer plugin.\nAnd I edited plugin Normalizer @6407c4f. Does this help you?\n. @barryvdh I fixed @12033d1 . Please check on 2.1-src Nightly: 12033d1. Thanks! :+1: \n. OK, I'm checking with barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver dev-master (603afb0). And i send PR. Thanks!\n. @northernlite69 I think the source of getfile would be helpful.\n. @vkirpa Thanks! I fixed it. Prease try nightly build and Add \"ls.pre\", \"ls\" to bind function.\ne.g.\nphp\n'upload.pre mkdir.pre mkfile.pre rename.pre archive.pre ls.pre' => array(\n    'Plugin.Normalizer.cmdPreprocess'\n),\n'ls' => array(\n    'Plugin.Normalizer.cmdPostprocess'\n),\n. @vkirpa Thanks! :+1: \n. I'm WIP.\n. > if you go to the empty folder and try to create new folder in it, the label 'Folder is empty' stays there and columns all are screwed.\nIt was already fixed at @eb6021e9434e89faa91e69979157e2c2f70e9376 and more enhancement @66b75c443eb1db8d37156f0922a9b6341152c3d7.\n. @svetlanadzhura \"jquery.dialogelfinder\" dose not has modal option. Please use another dialog solution.\ne.g. jQuery UI dialog\njavascript\n$('<div id=\"elfinder\"/>').elfinder({\n    url : 'connector.minimal.php'\n}).dialog({\n    modal: true\n});\n. Sorry, I was a misunderstanding. I said about \"jquery.dialogelfinder.js\". Do you want to make modal dialog in all of elFinder?\n. @svetlanadzhura You can set $.fn.elfinderdialog.defaults.modal = true with @ec004778f2efd496d54cfdbd48c3c390d3608650. Thanks!\n. I edited again. Please check with latest nightly.\n. @vkirpa Please try 'upload.presave' => array('Plugin.AutoResize.onUpLoadPreSave', 'Plugin.Normalizer.onUpLoadPreSave') (AutoResize to first).\n\nwhere to find the mime template for adding .word, .excel, .word, .excel, (MS Office)\n\nWhat mean is it? Don't the elFinder detect MIME-Type of MS Office files?\n. @DIDoS Can you revert @99590479019f958f7d6813b880f6a5eb8d8495ff to merge this PR?\n. @DIDoS Thanks!\n. elFinder is not support merge folder on paste. It is difficult.\n. Which volume driver are you testing? I was checked LocalFileSystem & FTP. It seems no problem.\n. Please try 2.1 nightly build. Then please make new issue If you have this problem yet.\n. Let's get back on track. I found volume root option\nphp\n// if true - join new and old directories content on paste\n'copyJoin'        => true,\nbut it feature does not seem to be implemented, I began to implement.\n. @vkirpa Please use translation tool and send pull request. \n. @Welpato Please leave a previous translator name.

I think so.\n@svetlanadzhura locked mean is the items in unwritable directory. That are readable and copyable.\nStill, do you want to ban the Copy on the client? Well you can respond by changing the function as in the proposal of troex. But it is possible to copy by issuing the command directly because of the connector-side functionality is not disabled.\njavascript\nvar elfinderInstance = $('#elfinder').elfinder({ opts }).elfinder('instance');\nelfinderInstance._commands['copy'].getstate = function(sel) {\n    var sel = this.files(sel),\n        cnt = sel.length;\n    return !this._disabled && cnt && $.map(sel, function(f) { return f.phash && f.read  && !f.locked ? f : null  }).length == cnt ? 0 : -1;\n};\nWarning: This change will cause the discrepancy between frontend and backend functions.\n. I will close this issue. Because this is not a problem of elFinder.\n. @svetlanadzhura This was fixed @300f0946862a8121c839184f21c4afa43bd192b8. Please wait 2.1.12. or You can try nightly build.\n. @svetlanadzhura I tried to fix this issue. Maybe fixed it.\n. @side-by-side  What about it? (add elf.destroy();)\n``` javascript\n    $().ready(function() {\n        var funcNum = getUrlParam('CKEditorFuncNum');\n    var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n        url : 'php/connector.php',\n        getFileCallback : function(file) {\n            window.opener.CKEDITOR.tools.callFunction(funcNum, file.url);\n            elf.destroy();\n            window.close();\n        },\n        resizable: false\n    }).elfinder('instance');\n});\n\n``\n. And You will can disable action that getting image size in next version with an optioncommandsOptions.getfile.getImgSize`.\n``` javascript\n$().ready(function() {\n    var funcNum = getUrlParam('CKEditorFuncNum');\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    url : 'php/connector.php',\n    commandsOptions: {\n        getfile: { \n            getImgSize: false\n        }\n    },\n    getFileCallback : function(file) {\n        window.opener.CKEDITOR.tools.callFunction(funcNum, file.url);\n        elf.destroy();\n        window.close();\n    },\n    resizable: false\n}).elfinder('instance');\n\n});\n``\n. I changed default value ofcommandsOptions.getfile.getImgSizetofalse` at be03221f4c317976fd7a539435a9eef7d3ff90f3.\n. @gorghi92 Please try absolute path.\n. I found a bug. I'll fix it. Thanks!\n. @RolfBensch It is one of examples.\njavascript\n      getFileCallback: function(file) { // editor callback\n        // Require `commandsOptions.getfile.onlyURL = false` (default)\n        if (file.mime.indexOf('image/') === 0) {\n          $('<img/>').attr('src', file.url)\n          .on('load', function() {\n            var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n            canvas.width = this.width;\n            canvas.height = this.height;\n            canvas.getContext('2d').drawImage(this, 0, 0);\n            file.url = canvas.toDataURL(file.mime);\n            FileBrowserDialogue.mySubmit(file, elfinderInstance);\n          })\n          .on('error', function() {\n            FileBrowserDialogue.mySubmit(file, elfinderInstance);\n          });\n        } else {\n          FileBrowserDialogue.mySubmit(file, elfinderInstance);\n        }\n      }\n. You are welcome!\n. @StudioJunkyard Thanks! :+1: \n- Add a volume root option tmbFbSelf default is true\n  - Fallback self image to thumbnail (nothing imgLib)\n- New setting value \"self\" of volume root option tmbURL\n  - If you want chose original image as thumbnail it is able to set 'self'\n- Show information of options debug server response into \"debug\" tab\n  on \"help\" dialog when the connector configuration has debug to true\n\n. Tool tip is using the title attribute. It will not be able to control the timing because it is a function of the browser.\n. c.f #2082. @fhb12345 Thanks! :+1: \n. @rajasharma27 From where the First noticed...\nPlease omit the unnecessary things about the options. Also, please let versatility without defining a value. For example, such as callback or path.\n. @rajasharma27 I do not know much about MsSql. Is this thing generic? (e.g. \"DF__elfinder_f__mime__7F60ED59\")\n. @rajasharma27 I don't know well about MsSql. Please make clearly. And, SQL query \"ALTER TABLE\" can be included in \"CREATE TABLE\"?\n. There is a regrettable, but we drop the MsSQL driver. Because it can not be maintained to continue because I am not familiar with MsSQL.\nSo you can listed in the README as a third-party volume driver, please PR to README.md.\n. OAuth callback, please be treated with GoogleDrive volume driver. And, please integrated into the #1349.\n. @rajasharma27 Please be available on the driver side, as this can be used as is.\n. @troex I do not know a lot about bower...\n- Is it better to include main and ignore sections?\n- require version in 2.1 and 2.0 branch's bower.json?\n. > Also I think bower.json is only needed in 2.0 and 2.1 branches, we don't need bower.json (and composer.json) in any other, for development users must use git clone.\nThink so. @troex I'll leave it up to you. Thanks!\n. I plan to accept the pull request of #1711. Please tell me the opinions of everyone.\n. Merged #1711. so close.\n. We are aware. However, the resource is missing. We are looking for a person to develop a document.\nIf there is no document, please to resolve read the source. Or, please ask with a \"elfinder\" tag in StackOverflow.\nIn addition, we are appreciate if you reflected in the document.\n. @ma2tkraus I also think it is necessary, but not yet implemented. Please to PR if there is a good idea.\n. We have decided to use only for the development of the issues of Github. Questions will be asked on  StackOverflow with a \"elfinder\" tag.\nIf there is a bug or feature requests here please let us know.\n. > Allow the cwd tree to be fully hidden\nWhat about swipe to close/open ? I'm now work in progress.\n\n. And I added swipe to open/close toolbar. You can try on demo site.\n\n. In elFinder 2.1.12 it will be pretty much fixed.(ref. #1373) So I close this issue. And we waiting more requests. Please make new issues of that.\n. Demo site has no problem. I checked with Google Chrome 51.0.2704.29 beta-m.\n. @rajasharma27 It should not be disabled about SSL certificate checking. Please fix it.\n. @rajasharma27 Netmount dose not work.\n. @rajasharma27 No, it is not match to netmount option.\nOther, I think this driver prerequisite is using composer. Therefore, \"include_once 'google-api-php-client/vendor/autoload.php'\" is unnecessary.\n. I got some notice errors. Please check with error_reporting(-1) and fix it.\nP.S. Do not use the \"@\" as possible.\n. I think that $client->setScopes([ Google_Service_Drive::DRIVE ]) is enough for access permissions.\n. Sorry to my poor English. \nPlease avoid error suppression using the '@'.\n. Please full support of commandsOptions.netmount.googledrive.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM Why do you think a bug? We will not be able to do anything and there is no additional information.\n- Which version of elFinder?\n- Which connector are you using?\n- What is your connector & client configuration?\n. @MG73 There is not similar problem in I've tried. What kind FTP server?\n. > The issue is only from windows localhost to remote server.\nExactly! I'll fix it.\n. @MG73 @troex Thanks! :+1: \n. @bilaljaffer I did a modification of the z-index on or after 2.1.11. Please try the nightly build.\n. @bilaljaffer Did you try to update the browser cache?\n. I'm testing in http://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/develop/bootstrap.html. It seems no problem.\n. This has already been run on elFinder 2.1.\nThese can be\n- Paste URL list in the upload dialog\n- URL list DnD to elFinder\n- DnD from other browser window / tab elements.\n. It is no problem on demo site. Please check firewall etc of your localhost.\n. @troex \n\nI think toolbar should also open elfinder upload dialog. Can you please check it?\n\nYes, I'll check it.\n. @troex I changed default value of commandsOptions.upload form 'uploadbutton' to 'button'.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM DnD is move itmes. DnD + [Shift] or [Ctrl] to copy items.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM Thanks! :+1: \n. @CodeLyokotEAM The reason is because it can not use their function in your server.\n. @MG73 Thumbnails will be stored on the server placed the connector. FTP server and Web server are running on a same server?\n. @svetlanadzhura I am in the planning is to be sent a mtitme during file upload. However, it does not process in the core. You will be able to handle a callback by bind.\n. I thought at the time that this implementation. It is a copy or move on the local file system is that we should keep the time stamp.\nI am thinking the introduction of options.\nFor example,\nphp\n$this->options['keepTimestamp'] = array('copy', 'move'); // keep timestamp at inner filesystem allowed 'copy', 'move' and 'upload'\nWhat do you think @svetlanadzhura @troex ?\nP.S. It is only on local file system driver.\n. @svetlanadzhura If there is another node in the HTML page, it should be disabled When elFinder has lost its focus. However, if there is only elFinder node to HTML pages, there is no need to disable the elFinder. I will fix this.\nThanks!\n. Please give if there is a specific improvement matters.\n. @troex OK. I'll add an option. e.g. selectCheckboxUA: [ 'Touch' ]\n. I tuned up. :smiley: \n. @CodeLyokotEAM You can start swipe in the area of 50px from the edge of the elFinder node. I will the modifications to visualize the area.\n\n. Yes, I have begun. :-)\n. @paulcanning What is your phone?\n. @paulcanning to #1425\n. In elFinder 2.1.12 it will be pretty much fixed. So I close this issue. And we waiting more requests. Please make new issues of that.\n. @MG73  @MG73 You can get MIME type from this.file.mime.\nIt is work fine.

There is a regrettable, but we drop the MsSQL driver. Because it can not be maintained to continue because I am not familiar with MsSQL.\nSo you can listed in the README as a third-party volume driver, please PR to README.md.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM Thanks! :+1: \n. I got this problem. filename is \"image.jpeg\", \"image.jpg\", or \"capturedvideo.MOV\". I will think of a method such as that using the file time stamp to the file name.\n. My plan is the filename incrementation, because it is impossible to get time stamp of the upload file on iOS.\n. @bbfriend Have you more infomation about php errors from server log?\n. @bbfriend I fixed notice error in rotate function @b98d582b785fb4211e6f0b1a79025dda37adcebc.But it was Notice error, It may not be the cause of this problem\n. @StudioJunkyard elFinder use php imagick extention, GD, or server command convert(imagimagick). And rotate function use server command exiftran or jpegtran if it is possible. \n. @StudioJunkyard Use GD(2) to image libs with connector root config 'imgLib' => 'gd'.\n. @bbfriend @StudioJunkyard This bug was already fixed in master branch. Please check with nightly build.\nThanks!\n. @StudioJunkyard Perhaps ... It seems there are problems in the JavaScript or theme side. Please create a new issue, if necessary.\n. @bbfriend OK. 2.1.12 coming soon.\n. @dekyfin Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d I added to README.md.. It is settled by using a third party connector.. @dipens [Shift] + drag start to drag out. But Google Chrome only\n. @idkl You can get with ...\njavascript\ngetFileCallback : function(file, fm) {\n    fm.exec('download', [ file.hash ]);\n},\n. @idkl download is not binded to handlers. but you can use bind.\ne.g.\njavascript\nvar elfinderInstance = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    // your options object\n}).elfinder('instance')\n.bind('download', function(event) {\n    elfinderInstance.log(event); // print to browser console\n});\n. @donraton , @StudioJunkyard If you are using LocalFileSystem driver, you can use volume root option detectDirIcon. I've just added to the Wiki.\nref. #1231 - Folder icon\nBy the way it is it is a good idea to add an HTML attribute. e.g. \"data-dirname\" attribute...\n. I have also forgotten but had been in getClass client option.\nuiOptions.tree.getClass and uiOptions.cwd.getClass I think this in enough.\nref. #1061 and https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/bf1fc1520a9226e204960ba66231f4da7d46978f/js/elFinder.options.js#L509-L519, https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/bf1fc1520a9226e204960ba66231f4da7d46978f/js/elFinder.options.js#L551-L561.\n. For example to using CSS.\nAdditional CSS\ncss\n<style>\n    .elfinder-cwd-file.picture-folder .elfinder-cwd-icon {\n        background:url(\"[PATH TO]/MyPictures.png\") 0 0 no-repeat;background-size:contain;\n    }\n</style>\nelFinder  client configuration\njavascript\nuiOptions: {\n    cwd: {\n        getClass : function(file) {\n            return file.name.match(/photo|picture|image/i)?

Please read connector.minimal.php-dist source code comment. - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/connector.minimal.php-dist#L36-L47\n. @paulcanning Perhaps, this problem would not be due to elFinder. However, If you find the matters to be corresponding to elFinder, please let us know and then re-open.\n. @Seungcheol-Lee I did not think about the integer maximum value of 32-bit systems. I will fix this. Thanks! :+1: \n. I'm planning to try to process the loading of the source file in the auto load. You will load any file by the priorities of the auto load.\n. @paulcanning Please read connector.minimal.php-dist source code comment. - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/connector.minimal.php-dist#L36-L47\nref. #1388\n. What about https://github.com/nao-pon/flysystem-google-drive#usage-to-with-elfinder ?\n. e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8942340/get-refresh-token-google-api\n. Probably in the 32-bit system is likely to files over 2GB PHP can not handle properly. Try a 64-bit system.\n. elFinder can not upload a file that exceeds the value of PHP_INT_MAX. This is by design.\n. @paulcanning You will need to use the more than 64-bit systems.\n. @paulcanning What is result in next?\nphp\n<?php\necho 'PHP_INT_SIZE: ' . PHP_INT_SIZE . ' , PHP_INT_MAX: ' . PHP_INT_MAX;\n. @CodeLyokotEAM Please to post to StackOverFlow mere question. ./vendor/autoload.php will be created when you use the composer.\n. @dbugit You can use bind.\ne.g.\n``` php\nfunction myUrldecode($cmd, & $result,  $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    foreach($result['files'] as $k=>$v){\n        $result['files'][$k]['name']  = urldecode($result['files'][$k]['name']);\n    }\n}\n// Documentation for connector options:\n// https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options\n$opts = array(\n    'bind'  => [\n        'open' => [ 'myUrldecode' ]\n    ],\n    'roots' => [ YOUR ROOTS ARRAY ]\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```\n. I think is that it is the responsibility of the volume driver to return the correct results. This matter looks like there is something due to FlySystem adapter of WebDav.\n. @StudioJunkyard This looks like a client side of trouble. Please check with plain elfinder.html, or elfinder.src.html.\n. Did you check with elfinder.html or elfinder.src.html?\nAnd, Can you show me your screen shot?\n. Ah! I got it. Congratulations!\n. @frazjp65 Probably, duplicated to #1269. It was fixed.\n. @kadosh1000 Did you mean, how is this? - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options-2.1#usebrowserhistory\n. @samokspv I have tried did not have a problem. Please check the nightly build.\n. @paulcanning Please also be applied to open, parents commands.\n. I've confirmed. Hidden items not included in the volume driver response. Therefore, please remove the item you want to hide.\nphp\nbind => array('open tree' => array('hideCheck')),\nphp\nfunction hideCheck($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    if (! empty($result['files'])) {\n        foreach($result['files'] as $i => $file) {\n            if ($file['name'] === 'hidden') {\n                unset($result['files'][$i]);\n            }\n        }\n        $result['files'] = array_values($result['files']);\n    }\n    if (! empty($result['tree'])) {\n        foreach($result['tree'] as $i => $file) {\n            if ($file['name'] === 'hidden') {\n                unset($result['tree'][$i]);\n            }\n        }\n        $result['tree'] = array_values($result['tree']);\n    }\n}\n. By the way, There is a way to use accessControl.\nphp\n'roots' => array(\n    array(\n        'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'          => '../files/',\n        'accessControl' => 'access'\n    )\n);\nphp\nfunction access($attr, $path, $data, $volume) {\n    if ($attr === 'hidden') {\n        if (preg_match('#/hidden(?:/|$)#', $path)) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n. @paulcanning PHP regex is PCRE. - http://php.net/manual/book.pcre.php\nPattern what you want is '/^123$/'.\n. @northernlite69 First of all, please refer to the Wiki. And, Questions, please ask in stackoverflow.\n. Please read source code comment of connector.minimal.php-dist.\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/89bbcab742122404c471d0898770956f871bc0ff/php/connector.minimal.php-dist\n- for elFinder >= 2.1.12 - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/connector.minimal.php-dist\n. @paulcanning Pattern matching is used full path.\n. There is no plan at the moment. We would welcome the PR.\n. I thought that way, but the implementation is difficult. For the time being and the specification that it can not request  to resize , crop and rotate at one-time.\n. @paulcanning Thanks!\n. @CodeLyokotEAM This is not a bug. It can be registered only folder to Places.\n. @TeamNuvolect Do you have the same problem in the nightly build?\n. Prease read README.md . Master branch has not been built. Please look at the 2.1 branch.\n. I do not know whether this correction is correct. Please check the nightly build. Do not forget to update the JavaScript cache.\n. What about newest nightly bae4125?\n. @leo1989work There is a problem of backward compatibility. I'll fix it. However, You can use new arg type. (wrap to array)\nphp\n                    'bind' => array(\n                        'mkdir mkfile rename duplicate upload rm paste' => array(array($this, 'log'))\n                    )\n. Please put the div element of elFinder a modal dialog. The basic question should be asked in StackOverFlow.\n. @YanareKu Please try an option mimeMap.\nphp\n'mimeMap'         => array(\n        'md:application/x-genesis-rom' => 'text/x-markdown',\n        'md:text/plain'                => 'text/x-markdown',\n        'markdown:text/plain'          => 'text/x-markdown',\n        'css:text/x-asm'               => 'text/css',\n        'ico:image/vnd.microsoft.icon' => 'image/x-icon',\n        'csv:text/plain'               => 'text/csv',\n        'm4a:video/mp4'                => 'audio/mp4',\n        'oga:application/ogg'          => 'audio/ogg',\n        'ogv:application/ogg'          => 'video/ogg',\n        'idml:application/zip'         => 'application/octet-stream'  // or What you want\n    ),\n. I'm not sure. Can you explain in detail along with a screen shot?\n. Since the demo site does not specify a getFileCallback icon will not be displayed.\n. Please use an option getFileCallback.\n. This is duplicate to #1403.\n. @zc888168 It is on the server time-out? I do not know because the detailed situation is not known.\n. @paulcanning \nphp\nfunction uploadCallback($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    $parentPath = $volume->getPath($args['target']));\n}\nelFinder 2.1.12 or nightly required.\n. composer require studio-42/elfinder:2.1.x-dev to install nightly build.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM What is correct URL(Scheme + URI)?\n. @CodeLyokotEAM How was it?\n. Please try 'URL' => '' or don't set. It use the connector to file open.\n. @mb202020 You can use an client configuration option getFileCallback.\ne.g.\njavascript\ngetFileCallback : function(file) {\n    $('#elfinderInput').val(file.mime);\n}\nDnD e.g.\njavascript\n$('#elfinderInput').droppable({\n    tolerance  : 'pointer',\n    accept     : '.elfinder-cwd-file-wrapper,.elfinder-navbar-dir,.elfinder-cwd-file,.elfinder-cwd-filename',\n    drop : function(e, ui) {\n        ui.helper.hide();\n        $(this).val(elfinderInstance.file(ui.helper.data('files')[0]).mime);\n    },\n    over : function(e, ui) {\n        ui.helper.addClass('elfinder-drag-helper-plus');\n    },\n    out : function(e, ui) {\n        ui.helper.removeClass('elfinder-drag-helper-plus');\n    }\n});\nHere, it does not describe in detail because it is the development of the field. Further information, please ask in such StackOverFlow.\n. @paulcanning It is not equipped with their functions to elFinder. To equipped with those features require extend function of elFinder. Please try to ask in such StackOverFlow because it does not support its own function here.\n. I'm thinking that upload confirmation is no need. Because it can cancel or can remove the item. Excessive confirmation will deteriorate UX.\n. @paulcanning elFInder detect user device by elFinder.UA.Mobile & elFinder.UA.Touch. Please make sure not interfere with this work on your project.\njavascript\n    /**\n     * User browser UA.\n     * jQuery.browser: version deprecated: 1.3, removed: 1.9\n     *\n     * @type Object\n     **/\n    this.UA = (function(){\n        var webkit = !document.uniqueID && !window.opera && !window.sidebar && window.localStorage && typeof window.orientation == \"undefined\";\n        return {\n            // Browser IE <= IE 6\n            ltIE6:typeof window.addEventListener == \"undefined\" && typeof document.documentElement.style.maxHeight == \"undefined\",\n            // Browser IE <= IE 7\n            ltIE7:typeof window.addEventListener == \"undefined\" && typeof document.querySelectorAll == \"undefined\",\n            // Browser IE <= IE 8\n            ltIE8:typeof window.addEventListener == \"undefined\" && typeof document.getElementsByClassName == \"undefined\",\n            IE:document.uniqueID,\n            Firefox:window.sidebar,\n            Opera:window.opera,\n            Webkit:webkit,\n            Chrome:webkit && window.chrome,\n            Safari:webkit && !window.chrome,\n            Mobile:typeof window.orientation != \"undefined\",\n            Touch:typeof window.ontouchstart != \"undefined\",\n            iOS: navigator.platform.match(/^iP(?:[ao]d|hone)/)\n        };\n. Stand-alone elFinder is no problem, if there is a problem in your project, I think that there is a problem with the integration with your project.\nPlease check one by one what is the difference. And please tell me if there is a thing to be improved to elFinder.\n. I do not know on our side about your project. Please let us know if you encounter similar trouble by the stand-alone specific options.\n. It is due to the CSS in my guess. Please try to disable non elFinder CSS.\n. How is JavaScript or HTML? Cause you can see if you changed to your implementation little by little from a normal state in a stand-alone.\n. @tx350z I'm checked on Firefox 46.0.1 (Windows 7 64bit). It was no problem. Please check to disable any extensions.\nP.S. http://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/ use CORS connecting. Perhaps Will your extension is blocking it.\n. I checked, but it was no problem. I attach sample archive.\ntest(Zip 2.32).zip (Linux)\ntest(ZipArchive).zip (PHP 5.5.35)\nWhat is your archiver?\n. I got it. I'll fix it. Thanks!\n. @japerr Yes, that's right! Thanks! :+1: \n. @helloooideeeeea Which volume driver do you using? Can you show us your connector configurations?\n. FMEIfinderBundle use ElFinderPHP. It is different to our elFinder. You should ask to FMEIfinderBundle.\nThanks.\n. There is also a elFinder 2.1_n as one of the choices. 2.1_n is the image can be edited in pixlr.com.\n. @lianee It is difficult to incorporate third-party services to the main stream. We need to create a mechanism that allows we to edit the item by the plugins.\nref. #1449\n. I will accept elFinder's edit command other than text files. This will make JavaScript editors (such as Adobe's Creative SDK) available.. @tracyliu2084 elFinder read the file system directly. (Not the HTTP protocol) Therefore I think it's impossible that you want.\n. @leo1989work  I'll implement function to make thumbnail from the video file by server side command ffmpeg.\n. You can try on nightly build. Thanks!\n. @leo1989work I was tested on demo site. It was no problem. Please try clear of browser cache.\n. This works with the default settings. Create a thumbnail if available the ffmpeg on the server.\nIf you got a JavaScript error, please let me know the location by using the elfinder.full.js.\n. The state of ffmpeg has been stacked in a session variable. Please try again confirmed with a new session when installed ffmpeg.\n. It can be processed in the action as well as the description by assigning the data in the file object in the open command.\nIf the document is not enough to combine with its own project elFinder, you will need to read and understand the program source. Here it can not be supported for that matter.\n. @rajasharma27 I'm not sure. Next example work well.\n``` javascript\n$(function() {\n    $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n        // Connector URL\n        url : 'php/connector.minimal.php',\n    // Callback when a file is double-clicked\n    getFileCallback : function(file) {\n        alert(file.url);\n    }\n});\n$('#elfinder2').elfinder({\n    // Connector URL\n    url : 'php/connector.minimal.php',\n\n    // Callback when a file is double-clicked\n    getFileCallback : function(file) {\n        alert(file.url);\n    }\n});\n\n});\n```\nhtml\n<body>\n    <div id=\"elfinder\"></div>\n    <div id=\"elfinder2\"></div>\n</body>\n. OK, I got it. I'll fix this bug.\nThanks!\n. @leo1989work You can use specific icon with custom CSS.\ne.g.\n``` css\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-excel,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-excel-addin-macroEnabled-12,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-excel-sheet-binary-macroEnabled-12,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-excel-sheet-macroEnabled-12,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-excel-template-macroEnabled-12,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-openxmlformats-officedocument-spreadsheetml-sheet,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-openxmlformats-officedocument-spreadsheetml-template {\n    background-image: url(\"URL TO YOUR EXCEL ICON\");\n    background-position: center center;\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size: contain;\n}\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-word,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-word-document-macroEnabled-12,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-ms-word-template-macroEnabled-12,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-openxmlformats-officedocument-wordprocessingml-document,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-openxmlformats-officedocument-wordprocessingml-template {\n    background-image: url(\"URL TO YOUR WORD ICON\");\n    background-position: center center;\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size: contain;\n}\n``\n. @leo1989work Sort of File type (kind) will be evaluated in the MIME type. So if you want to sort by file extension, use the client configurationsortRules`.\ne.g.\n``` javascript\n$('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    // Connector URL\n    url : 'php/connector.minimal.php',\nsortRules: {\n    kind: function(file1, file2){\n        return file1.name.split('.').pop().toLowerCase().localeCompare(file2.name.split('.').pop().toLowerCase());\n    }\n}\n\n});\n```\n. @duozersk Thanks! :+1: \n. @CodeLyokotEAM Already, elFinder show the confirm dialog of window closing when it has notify dialog. Do you want show confirm dialog always?\n. @leo1989work :+1: \n. @leo1989work \n\n1) when there is only one file , the next button is still there.\n\nIt was already fixed @2e43f5370b958c143500ac680308070203136fe6\n\nwhen I close the preview and open again, the preview content is disappeared\n\nI fixed @d97359aa5c0015b2d98607f5e4d2ce8fd96e170b\nThanks! :+1: \n. @leo1989work There is no problem in the demo site. Probably I think that there is a cause to your theme or integrated environment.\n. @RobiNN1 Thanks! :+1: \n. @eternelpanic Volume driver (backend) must return a UNIX timestamp as ts. Please correct the volume driver side.\nThanks.\n. @orpat Which version are you using? There aren't any problems in demo site.\n. I am guessing that you are integrated with some other systems. Perhaps this is not a elFinder problems. Please re-open if there is a similar problem in stand alone elFinder.\nPS. Probably sanitizer plugin will not be to your help.\n. @orpat File upload uses POST method. So you will fix with $_REQUEST.\nphp\n'host' => $_REQUEST['host'],\n'user' => $_REQUEST['user'],\n'pass' => $_REQUEST'pass'],\n. @raffaelescarcella Did you getting errors in console of the browser developer tool?\n. Google Docs preview is not available on the local host it is necessary to send the URL to Google.\n. @raffaelescarcella If you want to use Google Docs preview, you must be able to read the target item URL anonymously.\n\nI have also a problem with authentication : after logout the system can login without prompting for user credentials.\n\nIt is a specification of the Basic authentication. To destroy the logged in session you need to quit the browser.\n. > Did that means \"Google Docs preview works bebore login\"?\nYes, The unreadable item on logout can't use the Google Docs preview.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM elFinder will need to be a mechanism that can be edited just not other types of file text file to allow the plug-in format.  It is a future challenge.\n. @phtsaibb If you want to mount as an FTP drive, you need to be able to access from the FTP server to the USB device.\n. I got it. It is easy. But it should not be used in any public area. It will be vulnerable of security.\nclient configuration\njavascript\ncommandsOptions : {\n    netmount : {\n        localfilesystem : {\n            name : 'LocalFileSystem',\n            inputs: {\n                host     : $('<input type=\"hidden\" value=\"localhost\"/>'),\n                path     : $('<input type=\"text\" value=\"/\"/>')\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nconnector.php\n``` php\n// regist network mount volume\nelFinder::$netDrivers['localfilesystem'] = 'LocalFileSystem';\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```\n. @Gokujo I am guessing that you are to try a sample of the basic authentication. Basic authentication does not have a log-out of the mechanism during the session. To log out, such as closing the browser, it requires destruction of the session.\nIf you need a mechanism of logout, there is a need to integrate with any login/logout system, but does not provide such an example.\n. I thought that you are trying BasicAuthExample. was it different?\n. Did you added 'user' => 'user' into $auths?\n. Please make sure the session is working properly.\n. Perhaps in your server $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'] has not been assigned. Please perform the server set to be assigned them.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM This is not a bug. I believe it is rare to accidentally click the Close button \uff08x\uff09. Since the editor is open in the Ctrl + E after closing the editor, I think it good enough.\n. @raffaelescarcella elFinder 2.0 is not support office document preview. And pdf preview.require the Adobe Acrobat browser plugin.\nI checked on your elFinder with the Adobe Acrobat browser plugin. It's work fine.\n. @tscholz You can use client configuration handlers.\ne.g. (use kamranahmedse/jquery-toast-plugin: Highly customizable jquery plugin to show toast messages)\n``` javascript\nhandlers : {\n    upload : function(e, fm) {\n        if (e.data && ! e.data.warning && e.data.added && e.data.added.length) {\n            $.toast({\n                text: \" It was uploaded successfully completed.\", // Text that is to be shown in the toast\n                heading: 'Uploaded', // Optional heading to be shown on the toast\n                showHideTransition: 'fade', // fade, slide or plain\n                allowToastClose: true, // Boolean value true or false\n                hideAfter: 3000, // false to make it sticky or number representing the miliseconds as time after which toast needs to be hidden\n                stack: 5, // false if there should be only one toast at a time or a number representing the maximum number of toasts to be shown at a time\n                position: 'top-right', // bottom-left or bottom-right or bottom-center or top-left or top-right or top-center or mid-center or an object representing the left, right, top, bottom values\n            bgColor: '#00c131',  // Background color of the toast\n            textColor: '#ffffff',  // Text color of the toast\n            textAlign: 'center',  // Text alignment i.e. left, right or center\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n},\n```\n. Progress notification of server side has been stacked in #1357. However, I think that this support will be heavy work in the formulation of specifications and technical support.\nWe are looking for collaborators.\nThanks!\n. @paulcanning What about volume root option accessControl?\nNote: Use \\ instead of / on the windows server.\n`` php\nfunction function access($attr, $path) {\n    if (rtrim($path, '/') === '/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/elfinder_root/files') {\n        return ($attr == 'read' || $attr == 'locked');   // set read+locked to true, other (write+hidden) set to false\n    }\n    // And more rules here\n    // e.g. basic control of file/folder begins with '.' (dot).\n    return strpos(basename($path), '.') === 0       // if file/folder begins with '.' (dot)\n        ? !($attr == 'read' || $attr == 'write')    // set read+write to false, other (locked+hidden) set to true\n        :  null;                                    // else elFinder decide it itself\n}\n```\nin root opts\n'accessControl' => 'access'\n. > I want users to be able to upload into subfolders, but not into the root volume itself.\nThe previous code just works that way. Currently the my test site in this state.\n. The state of my test site is not what you want?\n. Function specified in accessControl is called each time the authority decision of all of the items.\n. Function specified in accessControl is called each time the authority decision of all of the items.\n. @paulcanning Please show us your accessControl function.\n. It is a issue of your project, not the issue of elFinder.\n. Please take the distance to swipe long. Because it wait the horizontal scrolling.\n. Please take the distance to swipe long. Because it wait the horizontal scrolling.\n. It is difficult to control the current. I'm planning to be able to control the CSS to give the name of the class to the TD element.\n. @paulcanning Please check out nightly build or demo site.\n. @Yves-K You can use an option startPathHash to set initial open folder.\nAnd example to auto select on initial open.\n``` javascript\nvar elfinderInstance = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    url : 'php/connector.php',\n    startPathHash : 'l1_Lw'\n}).elfinder('instance');\nelfinderInstance.one('open', function() {\n    var hashes = ['l1_SW1hZ2Vz', 'l1_QmFzaWNBdXRoRXhhbXBsZQ'];\n    $.each(hashes, function(i, hash) {\n        $('#'+elfinderInstance.cwdHash2Id(hash)).trigger('select');\n    });\n});\n```\nYou can get folder hash from browser location hash, And You can get items hash from HTML Elements  in browser developer tool Or next PHP script.\n``` php\n<?php\ninclude_once '../php/autoload.php';\n// Your connector $opts\n$opts = array(\n    'roots' => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',   // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n            'path'   => '../Demo/',       // path to files (REQUIRED)\n        ),\n    )\n);\n$elfinder = new elFinder($opts);\n$volume = $elfinder->getVolume('l1_'); // Volume driver ID + Increment integer + '_'\n$hash = $volume->getHash('/Images');\necho $hash;\n```\n. @bbfriend Sounds good! :+1:  Please edit 3rd party connectors, plugins, modules \u00b7 Studio-42/elFinder Wiki by yourself. And please close this issue after completion.\nThanks!\n. @gebrerv In LocalFileSystem and FTP driver uiCmdMap is not required. Please check your commands option.\n. Please double check that 'allowChmodReadOnly' and 'statOwner' contains in volume roots (each volumes) options. And chmod is valid only LocalFileSystem and FTP.\n. @gebrerv Thanks a lot! I'll fix it. But I can't found 'StatOwner'(uppercase S) in documents. Please tell me where it is.\n. @donraton It is duplicate to your #1387. Please ask in such StackOverFlow If the answer is not sufficient. Here is a place of development. \n. @leo1989work You can check files object with elfinder.log(files) in browser console. files object has a property type. That is 'files', 'data', or 'html'. You need to do the processing by their types. (Size acquisition of html type might be difficult)\nIt's processed by uploads.checkFile In elFinder.js.\n. You will need to code the program such as checkFile. But we can not support to more detail. Please ask to StackOverFlow or any agent as a business.\n. @leo1989work Maybe fixes with\n``` javascript\n        elfinder.upload = function (files) {\n            var total_byte = 0;\n            var uploads = files.files;\n            var upload_list = uploads.files;\n            var dfd = $.Deferred();\n        $.each(upload_list, function (index, entry) {\n            total_byte += entry.size;\n        });\n\n        $.ajax({\n            type: 'POST',\n            dataType: 'json',\n            url: '<?= site_url(\"API/check_quota\"); ?>',\n            data: {upload_size: total_byte}\n        }).done(function (res) {\n            if (res.result === 'success') {\n                dfd = elfinder.transport.upload(files, elfinder);\n            } else {\n                dfd.reject();\n                elfinder.error('Quota reach limit');\n            }\n        }).fail(function() {\n            dfd.reject();\n            elfinder.error('Quota check error');\n        });\n\n        return dfd;\n    };\n\n```\n(Not tested)\n(rewrite with $.ajax ref. #1501)\n. @leo1989work I think this is the theme of the issue.

For example, it does not seem to function properly as a fixed drive. In addition, there is such as unnecessary variable definition and options in the code.\nTo add to a project, you need to make it work without any problems in a variety of conditions.\nCurrently, because GoogleDrive driver using FlySystem there is already, I priority to maintain the code for this class is low.

It was fixed on elFinder >= 2.0.3, >= 2.1.0 \nMaybe, you can use elFinder 2.1.x with ruby connector (API 1.0 connector).\n. @nicorac Thanks! :+1: \n. @paulcanning There is client configuration uploadMaxChunkSize\n. > Typically, it's not in the documentation,\nYes, So wrote in Wiki.\n\nNote: This page is in progress and as such will not list everything. For more options and further documentation, see inside the js/elFinder.options.js file. \n\nWiki can be edited by anyone. We are looking forward to contribute of everyone.\n. @paulcanning Thanks! :+1: \n. @neotropic2023 Current plug-ins may not work only in the current version. Please use the plug-in version you are using.\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/tags\nP.S Old plug-ins work with the new version of elFinder.\n. It is probably the browser restrictions. The number of concurrent connections in most of the browser is limited to 6 connections.\n. @nicorac open command It is unexpected to disable because it also serves as the action to open the folder.\nFor paste command, it seems to function properly without being displayed in the context menu. I'm checked in elFinder 2.1.13.\n. @nicorac Which version of elFinder are you checking?\n. You can refresh the elFinder view by in the connector callback returns the value true. First of all, please try it.\n. Do you have disabled open command? There is a possibility of unexpected behavior to disable the open command.\n. @nicorac It is a simple example.\njavascript\n$().ready(function() {\n    var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n        url : 'php/connector.php'\n    }).elfinder('instance');\n    elf.bind('open', function() {\n        var info = $('<span class=\"elfinder-stat-quota\"/>').html('10MB still available');\n        elf.getUI('stat').append(info);\n    });\n});\n. Use connector option bind.\nconnector.php\n``` php\nfunction checkQuota($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    $result['_quota'] = 0;\n}\n$opts = array(\n    'root' => array(/ Roots options/),\n    'bind' => array(\n        'paste' => 'checkQuota',\n    ),\n);\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```\nelfinder.html\njavascript\n$().ready(function() {\n    var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n        url : 'php/connector.php'\n    }).elfinder('instance');\n    elf.bind('paste', function(e) {\n        var quota = e.data._quota;\n    });\n});\n. @nicorac There is Demo on jsfiddle. Please check it.\n. @nicorac Yes, you can use sync.\ne.g. Demo on JSFiddle\njavascript\nvar elfinderSetVolumeSize = function() {\n    var info = $('<span class=\"elfinder-stat-quota\"/>').html(' ' + elf.getUI().data('_volume_size') + 'MB free');\n    elf.getUI('stat').append(info);\n};\nelf.bind('open', function(e, fm){\n    fm.getUI().data('_volume_size', e.data._volume_size);\n    elfinderSetVolumeSize();\n})\n.bind('sync', function() {\n    elfinderSetVolumeSize();\n});\n. We plan to use the MIME type of the type property of the browser of file objects. It does not check when the MIME type can not be acquired.\n. onlyMime is allowed filter only. By the way what about volume option accessControl?\ne.g. in accessControl call back function\nphp\nif ($attr === 'hidden') {\n    if (preg_match('/\\.exe$/i', $path)) {\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n. @kukko I pushed @f638d9b748657d3ed01b7a4a009bf6b5f0b9de42. Now you can use $volume->getPath($hash) in bind function.\ne.g.\nphp\nfunction logger($cmd, $result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    if (! empty($result['removed'])) {\n        $removed0 = $result['removed'][0];\n        $path0 = $volume->getPath($removed0);\n    }\n}\nThanks! :+1: \n. @Poppoll Please use getFileCallback option. There is a wiki page Integration with TinyMCE 4.x.\n. @paulcanning I can not see the trouble. Do you have this problem in the demo site?\n. Probably I think that it is due to other CSS or JavaScript is being read into the page. Please let us know, and then re-open When you have found it to be improved in elFinder side.\n. @freccon There is an option 'optionsNetVolumes' of connector main.\ne.g.\n``\n$opts = array(\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n        )\n    ),\n    'optionsNetVolumes' => array(\n        'googledrive' => array( // or'*' => array(` for all netmount drive\n            'tmbPath' => 'Path to tmb directory',\n            'tmbURL'  => 'URL to tmb directory',\n        )\n    )\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```\nNote: It require elFinder >= 2.1.13\n. @freccon There is an option 'optionsNetVolumes' of connector main.\ne.g.\n``\n$opts = array(\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n        )\n    ),\n    'optionsNetVolumes' => array(\n        'googledrive' => array( // or'*' => array(` for all netmount drive\n            'tmbPath' => 'Path to tmb directory',\n            'tmbURL'  => 'URL to tmb directory',\n        )\n    )\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```\nNote: It require elFinder >= 2.1.13\n. @paulcanning Please correspond with doSearch method to extend the volume driver. We can not support for more information how to do this.\n. I think the order of the column has been set.\nrel. #1535\n. @nicorac This bug reason is that dosn't update cmd status at sync. I'll fix it.\n. There is no problem on demo site. Please check on stand alone elFinder (with out any other CSS & JavaScript). Please reopen this issue, if you got same problem on stand alone elFidner\n. I added custom column url. -> http://output.jsbin.com/honaqa#elf_l2_Lw\nIt seems no problem.\n. Update http://output.jsbin.com/honaqa#elf_l2_Lw with 2 custom columns. It use git nightly version. Please check with nightly if you want to report a bug.\n. @dadicsb I fixed itwith 4f858d5. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . There is no way to reset the order of the column. Why do you need to be reset?\n. Data is stored in a local storage of the browser. If necessary in debug as a developer is available from the Web console.\nwindow.localStorage.removeItem(window.location.pathname+'-elfinder-cwdCols'+'<elfinder dom id>')\ne.g.\nwindow.localStorage.removeItem(window.location.pathname+'-elfinder-cwdCols'+'elfinder')\nAnd reload browser window.\n. This issue duplicated to #1527. It was fixed @f638d9b748657d3ed01b7a4a009bf6b5f0b9de42.\n. Please wait 2.1.14 or try nightly build.\n. @kukko $volume is available since elFinder2.1.12.\n. @nicorac I'll check it.\n. @nicorac Your are right. $volume is false if cmd has targets(multi targets). You can get like this.\nphp\nfunction callback($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    if (! $volume && isset($args['targets']) && is_array($args['targets'])) {\n        foreach($args['targets'] as $target) {\n            $volume = $elfinder->getVolume($target);\n        }\n    }\n}\n. > I only had to change your sample from $arg to $args (in function body).\nOh, my... I corrected it. Thanks!\n. @yuseilee1992 elFinder supports folder uploading only Google chrome. Other browsers will be possible if the supported DirectoryReader API.\n. @paulcanning Perhaps, it is due to your configuration. We do not have a way to resolve the. Please let us know, and then re-open if there is a problem with the elFinder side.\n\n\nAlso, there is a spelling mistake. It should be \"exist\", not \"exists\"\n\nI fixed it. Thanks.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM Which connector are you using? I checked with LocalFileSystem that was no problem. Please show us your  connector configuration.\n. @CodeLyokotEAM  close this, but please re-open if necessary.\n. If the folder of the specified hash does not exist in the data driver returns, and redirects to the default folder. This problem appears to be of the AWS driver problem. Maybe it is related to #1543.\n. Perhaps I think volume driver does not return the correct data. This would not be elFinder problems. I will close this issue, but please re-open when you have found a problem in elFinder.\n. Yes, the folder mime type is \"directory\".\n. I can not. I don't have AWS account.\n. For now I do not need the AWS. There is also no time to test. This would not be elFinder problems. I will close this issue, but please re-open when you have found a problem in elFinder.\n. @vongruenigen 2.1.13 uses a DocumentFragment to DOM build than to improve performance. Since there is no problem it is a stand-alone state, perhaps there is a problem with the integrity with your customization. Please let me know if there is a point to be addressed something in elFinder.\n. @vongruenigen You can debug with full.js version in JS Bin. Please check it.\n. @vongruenigen Oh! OK! I broke the downward compatibility. I will fix it.\nThanks! :+1: \n. @paulcanning \n\nI want to let users rename, but not delete.\n\nWhat about write = 0?\nelFinder complies with the file attributes of a typical file system.\n. Renamable operate on files of the write-protected is a specification of the common file system, such as Linux.\n. The operation of elFinder by the file attribute is by design. If you need to change the specifications, please customize the elFinder.\n.

If you are using the elFinder as an extension of opencart, I do not know that the details regarding it. Please ask the extension of the developers.\nMe to guess, I think that it is because the sort command is not enabled.\n. Please don\u2019t worry.

Thus, to close this issue.\nEveryone, please re-open an issue #1584 with its details When you have found a new problem.\n. @RobiNN1 Thanks! :+1: \n.

I'll commit and push soon.\nThanks! :+1: \n. @alsantos123 To do this you will need to extend the duplicate command of elFinder.\nThis is an example. it require elFInder >= 2.1.15. Please use the nightly build up to 2.1.15 release.\nJavaScript\n`` javascript\n// custom ui commandmyduplicateextendsduplicate`\n(elFinder.prototype.commands.myduplicate = function() {\n    var fm = this.fm;\n    this.getstate = function(sel) {\n        var sel = this.files(sel),\n            cnt = sel.length;\n    return !this._disabled && cnt && fm.cwd().write && $.map(sel, function(f) { return f.mime !== 'directory' && f.phash && f.read && f.phash === fm.cwd().hash? f : null  }).length == cnt ? 0 : -1;\n}\n\n}).prototype = {\n     forceLoad : true,\n     extendsCmd : 'duplicate'\n};\nvar options = {\n    url  : 'php/connector.php'\n}\n$('#elfinder').elfinder(options);\n```\nPHP connector\n``` php\n// custom volume driver\nclass elFinderVolumeMyLocalFileSystem extends elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem\n{\n    public function duplicate($hash, $suffix='copy') {\n        $file = $this->file($hash);\n        if ($file && $file['mime'] === 'directory') {\n            return $this->setError(elFinder::ERROR_COPY, 'Folder:' . $file['name']);\n        }\n    return parent::duplicate($hash, $suffix);\n}\n\n}\n// use custom volume driver MyLocalFileSystem and ui command myduplicate\n$opts = array(\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver'   => 'MyLocalFileSystem',\n            'path'     => '/path/to/files/',\n            'uiCmdMap' => array('duplicate' => 'myduplicate'),\n        )\n    )\n);\n``\n. @girishkv Isn't that an issue with elfinder-flysystem-driver or Flysystem?\n- barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver#44\n-  thephpleague/flysystem-aws-s3-v3#46\n. Please check your connector configurations [tmbPath](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#tmbpath) and [tmbURL`](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#tmburl).\n. @standus API of elFinder will request the item data in the current working directory at a time. Mechanism of division acquisition is not.\n. > It means that it is impossible?\nYes, it is. That's right. elFinder is not designed to split get the cwd item data.\n. @standus Please set 'consumerKey', 'consumerSecret', 'accessToken' and 'accessTokenSecret' in volume root options.\n. I tested with next config. It was no problem.\nphp\narray(\n    'driver' => 'Dropbox',\n    'consumerKey' => 'xxxxx',\n    'consumerSecret' => 'xxxxx',\n    'accessToken' => 'xxxxx',\n    'accessTokenSecret' => 'xxxxx',\n    'path' => '/Public',\n);\n. Please set 'debug' => true, and check about dialog - debug tab - debug section.\nThis is example of wrong accessTokenSecret config.\n\n. Can you connect with netmount?\n. Did you make dropbox App as Full Dropbox?\n. Witch version of elFinder are you using? Please try latest version or latest nightly.\n. I can't reproduce this issue in my site. Could you do debug of elFinderVolumeDropbox.class.php _stat() , deltaCheck(), parseRaw(), etc...?\n. Dropbox driver use SQLite DB for cache. DB data file(.elFinder_dropbox_db_[unique key]) will be created in tmp directory(option metaCachePath, tmpPath, tmbPath or elFinder::commonTempPath).\n. Would you try to clear session cache by browser restart?\n. umm... I don't get it.\nI have test site on XAMPP 5.6.23 (Windows 10). That is no problem.\n. Do you have any error messages in the debug tab of the info dialog?\n. I got same error. I'll debug it.\n. Could you try install pear/http_oauth?\n. I found a bug and fixed it. @standus Thanks! :+1: \nPlease delete DB file before retry with this fix.\n. @Miromani4 Please set config debug to true and Please check about dialog - debug tab. \nCan you find any errors in there?\n. @Miromani4 Did you solved it?\n. Steps for debug\n- Connector configuration debug to true\n- Enable error reporting in your connector.php\nphp\nerror_reporting(-1); // Set -1 for debuging\nini_set('diaplay_errors', '1');\n- Open elFinder and check debug tab in about dialog\nDid you find any errors in that debug tab?\n\n. elFinder doesn't show anything errors when you open a folder?\n. If encoding of server file system is not UTF-8, please try volume roots option encoding and locale.\ne.g.\nphp\n'encoding' => 'ISO-8859-5',\n'locale' => 'ru_RU.iso88595',\n'driver' => 'FTP',\n'host' => '5.100.67.123',\n'user' => 'dw',\n'pass' => 'my pass',\n'port' => 21,\n'mode' => 'passive',\n'path' => '/',\n'timeout' => 10,\n'owner' => true,\n'tmbPath' => '',\n'tmpPath' => '',\n'tmp' => '',\n'dirMode' => 0755,\n'fileMode' => 0777,\n. OK, I will close it. Please let me know if you find any bugs of elFinder.\n. @standus At the latest we want to handle up to V1 is finished, but I have not enough time now. 2017 first quarter about somehow to ...\n. There is no official APIv2 PHP SDK, so we need to select a third party SDK.\nCurrently there are two SDKs.\n- https://github.com/kunalvarma05/dropbox-php-sdk\n- https://github.com/Alorel/dropbox-v2-php\nI will select kunalvarma05/dropbox-php-sdk. I ask for your opinion.\n. @standus I started coding from today. I think that it will be possible to test in a couple of days.. I done. We can be testing in nightly build.\nThanks! \ud83d\ude04 . I did not know DropPHP until now. The size of the library is small and good, but I think that Kunnu DB lib has versatility.\nAdditional third party library guzzlehttp/guzzle is also used with the Google Drive driver, it is very useful to have centralized control with composer.\nBy the way, it's about configure.\nChanged option name consumerKey to app_key and consumerSecret toapp_secret or define constant ELFINDER_DROPBOX_APPKEY and ELFINDER_DROPBOX_APPSECRET.\nDropbox2 use the OAuth2 so it need access token for OAuth2. You can get it from https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps (Generated access token).\nCode example is\n```php\n// load composer autoload before load elFinder autoload If you need composer\nrequire './vendor/autoload.php';\n// elFinder autoload\nrequire './autoload.php';\n// ===============================================\n// Required for Dropbox network mount\n// Installation by composer\n// composer require kunalvarma05/dropbox-php-sdk\n// Enable network mount\nelFinder::$netDrivers['dropbox2'] = 'Dropbox2';\n// Dropbox2 Netmount driver need next two settings. You can get at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps\n// AND reuire regist redirect url to \"YOUR_CONNECTOR_URL?cmd=netmount&protocol=dropbox2&host=1\"\ndefine('ELFINDER_DROPBOX_APPKEY',    'YOUR APP KEY');\ndefine('ELFINDER_DROPBOX_APPSECRET', 'YOUR APP SECRET');\n// ===============================================\n```\nAND\nphp\narray(\n    'alias'        => 'elFinder@Dropbox',\n    'driver'       => 'Dropbox2',\n    'path'         => '/Public/elFinder',\n    'access_token' => 'YOUR TOKEN You can get from https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps',\n),\n. What about upload from folder's contextmenu?\n. > also file-types .apk .crdownload like files deny upload massage show, after the upload.\nelFinder do checking by MIME type that notified from browser, but browser does not know all file types. If elFinder does not obtained the MIME type, can not pre-check.\n. > I think user can change upload path, selected upload button in toolbar.\nIts implementation is a little difficult.\nI have a one draft. It is possible to select target folder of the current working directory before clicking the upload button. How is it?\n. Upload dialog is modal. Therefore, to use a tree view is difficult. I am considering the selector display of child folder of the current working directory.\n. It's done. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! :+1: \n. @streamy878 I think this is the ASP.NET connector problem. You can get the information in a Wiki about Client-Server API.\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.1#information-about-filedirectory\n\n\"tmb\"    : 'bac0d45b625f8d4633435ffbd52ca495.png' // (String) Only for images. Thumbnail file name, if file do not have thumbnail yet, but it can be generated than it must have value \"1\"\n    \"alias\"  : \"files/images\",       // (String) For symlinks only. Symlink target path.\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.1#tmb\nBackground command. Creates thumbnails for images that do not have them. \n. @CodeLyokoXtEAM I checked 2.24GB video file on XAMPP 5.6.23 (Windows 10 64bit/RAM 4GB). There was no significant change in the amount of memory at the time of preview in my environment. Play in part read by the HTTP 206 also was started immediately.\n\nI recommend the confirmation of the setting of the output buffering of PHP.\n- http://php.net/manual/outcontrol.configuration.php\n. @standus You can use elFinderInstance.log() for debug. That is shows the data into browser console.\ne.g. - use self.log() in elFinder..request - success (elFinder.js L.1379)\n``` javascript\n            success = function(response) {\n            /*--- debug ---*/\n            self.log(response);\n\n            // Set currrent request command name\n            self.currentReqCmd = cmd;\n\n            if (raw) {\n                return dfrd.resolve(response);\n            }\n\n            if (!response) {\n                return dfrd.reject(['errResponse', 'errDataEmpty'], xhr);\n            } else if (!$.isPlainObject(response)) {\n                return dfrd.reject(['errResponse', 'errDataNotJSON'], xhr);\n            } else if (response.error) {\n                return dfrd.reject(response.error, xhr);\n            } else if (!self.validResponse(cmd, response)) {\n                return dfrd.reject('errResponse', xhr);\n            }\n\n            var resolve = function() {\n                response = self.normalize(response);\n\n                /*--- debug ---*/\n                self.log(response);\n\n                if (!self.api) {\n                    self.api    = response.api || 1;\n                    if (self.api == '2.0' && typeof response.options.uploadMaxSize !== 'undefined') {\n                        self.api = '2.1';\n                    }\n                    self.newAPI = self.api >= 2;\n                    self.oldAPI = !self.newAPI;\n                }\n\n                if (response.options) {\n                    cwdOptions = $.extend({}, cwdOptions, response.options);\n                }\n\n                if (response.netDrivers) {\n                    self.netDrivers = response.netDrivers;\n                }\n\n                if (isOpen && !!data.init) {\n                    self.uplMaxSize = self.returnBytes(response.uplMaxSize);\n                    self.uplMaxFile = !!response.uplMaxFile? parseInt(response.uplMaxFile) : 20;\n                }\n\n                dfrd.resolve(response);\n                response.debug && self.debug('backend-debug', response.debug);\n            };\n\n            lazy? self.lazy(resolve) : resolve();\n        },\n\n```\n. @Vartex05 In first method in Wiki example, change\nFrom\njavascript\nFileBrowserDialogue.mySubmit(file);\nTo\njavascript\nFileBrowserDialogue.mySubmit(file.url);\nwill be solved.\nAnd If you need absolute URL. Please set absolute URL to volume roots option URL.\n. Could you show me your connector configuration?\n. It's odd. Probably, volume driver returning relative URL in the url of the item data. Are you extend something volume driver? e.g. bind action...\nAs one of the solution there is a way to convert the relative URL to an absolute URL.\njavascript\ngetFileCallback: function(file, fm) { // editor callback\n    file.url = fm.convAbsUrl(file.url);\n    // do something...\n}\n. OK, i got it. Congratulation!\n. OK, i got it. Congratulation!\n. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Nice! :+1: \n. @standus This problem has been corrected at the same time of @b747a8c7cec914c2c652c989b8dfeb56a5e025b3.\nThanks for your reports.\n. @darrylyeo Please read Wiki - Using custom editor to edit files within elfinder. It will be your help.\n. - FTP Driver\n  - Please set connector roots option URL correctly.\n- Dropbox, GoogleDrive Driver\n  - ~~Please make public link by Get URL Link button in info dialog before insert to CKEditor.~~\n  - \n  - It should automatically public link is obtained when the command is executed in the \"getfile\".\n. @standus elFinder is can be copied between volumes. Please copy the target file to the local file system volume.\n. This is a basic example. But it require nightly build or elFinder >= 2.1.15.\n``` javascript\ncommandsOptions : {\n    getfile : {\n        onlyURL  : false,\n        // allow to return multiple files info\n        multiple : false,\n        // allow to return filers info\n        folders  : false,\n        // get image sizes before callback call\n        getImgSize : false\n    }\n},\ngetFileCallback : function(file, fm) {\n    var localId = 'l1_';\n    var localTargetHash = localId + 'Lw'; // 'Lw' = '/' = root\nif (file.hash.indexOf(localId) !== 0) {\n    var dfd = $.Deferred();\n\n    fm.clipboard([ file.hash ], 0);\n\n    fm.exec('paste', localTargetHash)\n    .done(function(copy, paste) {\n        if (paste && paste.added && paste.added.length) {\n            fm.one('pastedone', function() {\n                dfd = fm.exec('getfile', paste.added[0].hash);\n            });\n            return dfd;\n        }\n        dfd.reject();\n    })\n    .fail(function() {\n        dfd.reject();\n    });\n\n    return dfd;\n} else {\n    fm.log(file.url);\n}\n\n}\n``\n. @standus [This](http://jsbin.com/tefodu/edit?html,output) is live demo.

It require writable permission from PHP. \n. @samatic You can use AutoResize plugin of PHP connector to auto resize.\nOR\nYou can use client congratulation handlers.\ne.g.\njavascript\nhandlers : {\n    // Auto crop OR Auto resize\n    upload : function(e, fm) {\n        var uploadedFiles = e.data.added,\n            mode = {\n                resize: {\n                    mode: 'resize',\n                    width: 500,\n                    height: 500\n                },\n                crop: {\n                    mode: 'crop',\n                    width: 500,\n                    height: 500,\n                    x: 100,\n                    y: 100\n                }\n            };\n        if (uploadedFiles.length) {\n            $.each(uploadedFiles, function() {\n                if (this.read && this.write && this.mime.indexOf('image/') !== -1) {\n                    fm.request($.extend(\n                        {\n                            cmd: 'resize',\n                            target: this.hash\n                        },\n                        mode['crop'] /* or mode['resize'] */\n                    ));\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\nAnd We will usable next code with elFinder >= 2.1.16. This is such as error handling will be handled properly. You can try this code with nightly build.\njavascript\nhandlers : {\n    // Auto crop OR Auto resize\n    upload : function(e, fm) {\n        var uploadedFiles = e.data.added,\n            mode = {\n                resize: {\n                    mode: 'resize',\n                    width: 500,\n                    height: 500\n                },\n                crop: {\n                    mode: 'crop',\n                    width: 500,\n                    height: 500,\n                    x: 100,\n                    y: 100\n                }\n            };\n        if (uploadedFiles.length) {\n            $.each(uploadedFiles, function() {\n                if (this.read && this.write && this.mime.indexOf('image/') !== -1) {\n                    fm.getCommand('resize').resizeRequest($.extend(\n                        {\n                            target: this.hash\n                        },\n                        mode['crop'] /* or mode['resize'] */\n                    ));\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n. @paulcanning I checked on newest nightly elFinder with FlySystem - Google Drive adapter. That is no problem. I guess this problem is issue of Google Cloud adapter. Or your PHP configurations (e.g. memory_limit, max_execution_time, etc).\n. Which version of elFinder are you using? Not match \"elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php line 2910\" in latest version.\n\nWhen elFinder displays \"Doing something\" what is it meant to be doing exactly?\n\nPerhaps, It saving the uploaded data to the server to GCS.\n. Please check without all of your bind functions.\n. > I'm using 2.1.15.\nYour environment is different from the JavaScript and PHP connector versions of elFinder. PHP of the file does not seem to be updated.\n. @paulcanning Did you solved it? Please close this isuue if you got it.\n. Perhaps, because I think that is a GCS FlySystem Adapter of the problem, I will close it. Please re-open if necessary.\n. @ductaionline Probably, this issue was already fixed. Please check with latest nightly build.\n. @ductaionline Please check #1331.\n. @dwickstrom Thanks!\n. @paulcanning Please check the value of $path.\ne.g.\n``` php\npublic function elfDebug()\n{\n    $arg = func_get_args();\n    ob_start();\n    foreach($arg as $v) {\n        var_dump($v);\n    }\n    $o = ob_get_contents();\n    ob_end_clean();\n    file_put_contents('./debug.txt', $o, FILE_APPEND);\n}\npublic function accessControl($attr, $path, $data, $volume)\n{\n    $this->elfDebug($attr, $path);\n    return null;  // elFinder decide it itself\n}\n```\n. > I am now seeing / at the end of the log file.\ne.g.\nphp\n    public function accessControl($attr, $path, $data, $volume)\n    {\n        if ($path === \"/\")\n        {\n            return ($attr === 'read' || $attr === 'locked');\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n. It is related to #1680 \n. @paulcanning Thanks! By the way, your environment is different from the JavaScript and PHP connector versions of elFinder. PHP of the file does not seem to be updated.\n. @paulcanning  That is the file. Please check Wiki.\n. @Gosokan Everything OK, if the authentication mechanism that can get the login user name in the PHP. It define in connector.php.\nphp\n$username = 'auth_user_name';\n$opts = array(\n    'locale' => '',\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/'.$username.'/',\n            'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n        )\n    )\n);\n. @jitkang Please run the PHP by each user account. e.g. suExec...\nRelated to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39973078/manage-users-files-with-apache\n. @salahsaleh I guess 'path'   => basename(__DIR__).$midDirPath.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Technology' is not correct.\n. What is value of basename(__DIR__).$midDirPath.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Technology'? Is it correct?\n. Please check your php.ini.\n- upload_max_filesize\n- post_max_size\n- memory_limit\n- max_execution_time\n- max_file_uploads \n. It seems no problem. Can you try nightly build?\n. @phtsaibb Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d I'll fix it.\n. @max-wen It is not supported now. The next version will supports this feature. Thanks!\n. There is problem of CSS for touch devices. I'll fix it. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks!\n. @alexantr Probably fixed @c3f4709b8776787579fff4f2f6945267a47bdeb3. Please try and check on nightly build.\nThanks!\n. @alexantr Thanks for your time!\n. @webuntu I was checked in our demo site. There was no problem. Would you check in our demo site?\n. @alexantr You are right! I'll fix it. Thanks!\n. @CodeLyokoXtEAM \n\n\nWorking area is closed & user must resize working window.\n\n\nWhat's mean? I'm not sure. Would you please explain more detail?\nIs it https://youtu.be/oqyrlUYWSs8?\nThanks!\n. OK, I'll fix it. :ok_man: \n. @Shadowfied Video thumbnail feature require the ffmpeg on the server.\nPlease try install the ffmpeg into your server.\n.

Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @Shadowfied You can try nightly build until release 2.1.17.\nThanks for your time!\n. Please move to javascript - CKeditor / Elfinder different reaction - Stack Overflow.\n. @ElrondVardamir , @beechyrb \nHTTP error 0 meaning is \"It could not connect to the back-end server.(Connection has been cut off)\". I guess, this problem is that there is a cause to your client side or your server side.\nNext article of the stack Ober flow will help you?\n- ajax - HTTP status code 0 - what does this mean in MS XMLHTTP? - Stack Overflow\n. @max-wen Thanks!\n. @BitStinker There is an option destroy in elfinder object.\ne.g. $('#elf').elfinder('destroy').elfinder(opts);\n. #1731 is my mistake. That was canceled.\n. @oitsuki This problem is not a problem to ask here. You need to learn about the HTTP communication and server configuration.\nPlease ask in such a stack overflow.\nThanks.\n. @RobiNN1 Thanks!\n\nI created a theme, you can add it to a 3rd party Themes? https://github.com/RobiNN1/elFinder-Material-Theme\n\nOh! Sounds good! Would you please send pull request of README.md?\n. @Shadowfied There is a client option sortType, sortOrder.\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    url  : 'php/connector.php',\n    sortType : 'date',\n    sortOrder : 'desc'\n}\n$('#elfinder').elfinder(options);\n. It's exactly, so I edited Wiki today. ;-)\nThanks!\n. @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @Flamenco There is CSS problem. I'll fix it.\nThanks!\n. @doncaz \n\nCopy few files from folder\n\nWhere copied from? from your local PC?\n. I checked it on windows PC. It can by Ctrl+v only Firefox. Other browser was impossible. \nPerhaps, this is due to the browser specifications. So please use DnD upload or file picker.\n. OK, I am considering a change of message, but my English is not perhaps well. Please suggest a better wording.\nMy wording is \"Drop or Paste Files, Images, URL-list to here (File drop only)\".\n. @doncaz Thanks!\nWhat about \"Drop files, Paste URL or Image data here\"?\n. It is possible to paste image data of the clipboard that is not limited to the screenshot, so I'm selecting \"Image data\".\nThanks so much!\n. @RobiNN1 The default setting will not be able to add files that begin with .(dot) for security reasons. Please change connector roots option acceptedName. \n. @BitStinker Please try $this->session->set($key, $val) and $this->session->get($key).\nref. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/elFinderSessionInterface.php\n. @BitStinker Did you got it?\n. @leo1989work Which volume driver are you using? please check function _copy() of your use volume driver.\n. @Flamenco \nWhen the focus shifts to other than the node of elFinder so elFinder become disabled. There is a UI option enableAlways to always enabled.\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    url  : 'php/connector.php',\n    enableAlways : true \n}\n$('#elfinder').elfinder(options);\nIn addition, elFinder next version will have the client configuration option enableByMouseOver to enable by mouse over.\nThanks!\n. > Also I tried setting\n\nenableAlways : true \nwith no luck.\n\nOK, I'll check it.\n. @Flamenco I modified about an option enableAlways. Would you try and check enableAlways: true with nightly build?\n. @Flamenco Thanks for your debugging.\n\n$(top.document).on('keydown', function (e) { console.info(e); });\n\nI think this is not good idea. It might trouble occurs when there is other content in the parent window. \nBecause the cause is that the window that contain the elFinder loses focus, I'm going to fix it.\n. @Flamenco I edited. Please try  and check with enableAlways: true on nightly build.\n. @leo1989work It is impossible. If you allow it through the connector of elFinder, the security settings of the server is no longer meaningful. Don't you think so?\n. There is no reply,  so close this.\n. @nganivet RFC 6266 is applied to the Chrome in the current version. The actual code is as follows. Please check in the latest version or nightly build.\nphp\n$filenameEncoded = rawurlencode($file['name']);\nif (strpos($filenameEncoded, '%') === false) { // ASCII only\n    $filename = 'filename=\"'.$file['name'].'\"';\n} else {\n    $ua = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];\n    if (preg_match('/MSIE [4-8]/', $ua)) { // IE < 9 do not support RFC 6266 (RFC 2231/RFC 5987)\n        $filename = 'filename=\"'.$filenameEncoded.'\"';\n    } elseif (strpos($ua, 'Chrome') === false && strpos($ua, 'Safari') !== false && preg_match('#Version/[3-5]#', $ua)) { // Safari < 6\n        $filename = 'filename=\"'.str_replace('\"', '', $file['name']).'\"';\n    } else { // RFC 6266 (RFC 2231/RFC 5987)\n        $filename = 'filename*=UTF-8\\'\\''.$filenameEncoded;\n    }\n}\n. I made test file (a' b\u201d.txt) into http://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/2.1/#elf_l1_VGlwcy9Gb3JDaGVjaw . Could you try download a file a' b\u201d.txt with Chrome?\n. Oh, sorry. I renamed it.\nThe elFinder send header Content-Disposition:\"attachment; filename*=UTF-8''a%2C%20b.txt\" on download.\n. Yes, I think this problem is Drupal module issue probably.\nThanks!\n. @YanareKu It seems no problen on the current version. Could you check on the current version or nightly build?\n. @YanareKu , @featheredtoast I got it. This is a  bug of cmd getfile. I'll fix it.\n. It done. We can request to get path as async. (Automatically perform the async request in getFileCallback.)\ne.g. for your custom function\njavascript\nfm.escape(fm.path(file.hash, true));\nto\njavascript\nfm.path(file.hash, true, {}).done(function(path) {\n    fm.escape(path);\n});\nif you don't need notify\njavascript\nfm.path(file.hash, true, {notify: null}).done(function(path) {\n    fm.escape(path);\n});\n. @Flamenco \n\n2 . remove expand/restore icon\n\nThere is a client configuration option uiOptions.toolbar.\n\n3 . remove expand/restore messages\n4 . remove all relevantkeyboard shortcuts\n\nWhat mean is it? Could you please explain more detail?\n. There is no way to prohibit canceling the full screen mode. It is the specification of browser (or OS).\n. Are you want like this? -> http://jsbin.com/gowemuq/edit?html,output\njavascript\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    url : 'php/connector.php',\n    ui : ['tree', 'path', 'stat'],\n    allowShortcuts : false\n}).elfinder('instance').exec('fullscreen');\n. What you want is maximized in the browser, not in full screen mode?\nLive demo example -> http://output.jsbin.com/gowemuq\nSource -> http://jsbin.com/gowemuq/edit?html\nFull screen mode on the OS can not be started without user action.\n. Currently elFinder accept '100%' to client config option height. see #2305 (comment) .. @mustaqim313 This is duplicate to #1657. Please check it.\n. @mustaqim313 Such a thing is I think that it is better to do in a server-side script.\nIf you want to do something about the action that the user performs on the elFInder you can use the 'bind' option.\n. This is my commit mistakes. This was canceled.\n. @BangShut Please check out the Wiki.\n. @saudisoftech Please check the Wiki page. -> https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#uploadallow\n. @ipppinto There is an option [disabled](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#disabled) of volume roots.\ne.g.\nphp\n$opts = array(\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'disabled' => array('rm', 'rename'),\n        )\n    )\n);\n. @paulcanning The local storage value of the browser may be affecting it. Please check in secret(Incognito) mode of browser.\n. Please see https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1535#issuecomment-233101512\n. @Flamenco There is no problem in demo site. Please check on newest version or nightly build.\n\n. Did you checked on our demo site?\n. @Flamenco Please try latest version or nightly build.\n. @Flamenco Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @pgilad Please consider using the config value uploadMaxSize.\n. elFinder will try a retry to recover from a very short network error when chunked file uploading. You can adjust the chunk size with the uploadMaxChunkSize client option.\n. The connector config uploadMaxConn to -1 to disable chunked file upload. Please try it.\n. @pgilad I'll fix to retry uploading only on connection aborted.\n. @Flamenco Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @YavuzTR There are client configurations commandsOptions.quicklook.width and commandsOptions.quicklook.height.\ne.g.\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    url  : 'php/connector.php',\n    commandsOptions : {\n        quicklook : {\n            width: 850,\n            height: 500\n        }\n    }\n}\n$('#elfinder').elfinder(options);\n. @anagaok \n\n$dir1 = '../../../../uploadImg/';\n$dir2 = '/images/';\n$user = '2';\n\nand\n\n'path' => $dir1 . $user . '/' . $dir2\n\nThe path became ../../../../uploadImg/2//images/\nI'm guessing that correct setting is 'path' => $dir1 . $user . $dir2.\n. However, it is very strange that there is only a problem with IE. There is no problem with IE in the demo site, so I do not know any more.\nI think that this problem is not a problem of elFinder and I will close it. Please let me know if you find a problem with elFinder.\n. @leveller101 There is a plugin AutoResize. Will it help you?\n. @ks780 Thanks!\n. @iridance Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @ToX82 I added plugin option 'forceEffect. Please set it to true.\nphp\n'plugin' => array(\n    'AutoResize' => array(\n        'enable'         => true,       // For control by volume driver\n        'maxWidth'       => 1024,       // Path to Water mark image\n        'maxHeight'      => 1024,       // Margin right pixel\n        'quality'        => 95,         // JPEG image save quality\n        'preserveExif'   => false,      // Preserve EXIF data (Imagick only)\n        'forceEffect'    => true,       // For change quality of small images\n        'targetType'     => IMG_GIF|IMG_JPG|IMG_PNG|IMG_WBMP // Target image formats ( bit-field )\n    )\n)\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @pingtux Please set a client option commandsOptions.upload.ui to 'uploadbutton'; \n. @standus This is decoder of UTF-8 to UNICODE(JavaScript internal string data).

OK, You can get toolbar DOM by fm.getUI('toolbar') and controllable it.\nThere is a live example for it. -> http://jsbin.com/nerese/edit?html,output\n```javascript\n$('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    url : 'php/connector.php',\n    handlers: {\n        init: function(e, fm) {\n            fm.one('open', function() {\n                var tm,\n                    toolbarLive,\n                    clearTm = function() {\n                        tm && clearTimeout(tm);\n                    },\n                    toolbar = fm.getUI('toolbar')\n                        .addClass('ui-front')\n                        .css({position:'absolute'})\n                        .hide()\n                        .on('mouseenter', function() {\n                            toolbarLive = true;\n                        })\n                        .on('mouseleave', function() {\n                            toolbarLive = false;\n                            toolbarHide();\n                        }),\n                    toolbarHide = function() {\n                        clearTm();\n                        tm = setTimeout(function() {\n                            ! toolbarLive && toolbar.hide();\n                        }, 500);\n                    };\n            fm.trigger('uiresize');\n            fm.getUI('cwd')\n                .on('mouseenter', '[id]', function() {\n                    var $this = $(this);\n                    clearTm();\n                    tm = setTimeout(function() {\n                        var offset = $this.offset();\n                        toolbar.css({top: offset.top+$this.height()}).show();\n                    }, 1500);\n                })\n                .on('mouseleave', '[id]', function() {\n                    toolbarHide();\n                });\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n});\n```. > Question 1: \"handlers:{ init:\" is this how we can add new function to elFinder?\nThere is a method bind in elFinder instance. see https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-event-API .\ne.g.\njavascript\nvar fm = $('elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nfm.bind('init', function(event, fm) {});\nfm.bind('init', function(event, fm) {});\n\nQuestion 2: what is \"fm.one('open' \"?  \n\nalso see https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-event-API .\n\nfm.trigger('uiresize');  //Question 3: what does this do?\n\nFit height to elFinder node height of tree and cwd and also call any binding functions.\n\nfm.getUI('cwd') // Question 4: Is this to get every row in the file listing?\n\nThe node obtained by fm.getUI('cwd') is the parent node containing each items.\n. @taylankasap \n\nFor example if I copy a .jpg file and paste it, it's automatically converted to PNG & filesize is much higher than the original file.\n\nThat is the specification of the browser. If you want to upload a file, please drag and drop or paste the image URL.\n\nDownload the doc file to your computer, copy it in your computer, go to elfinder, click upload button, paste to the dropPasteFiles area.\n\nOnly images or text data can be pasted. If you want to upload a file, drag and drop it or use the file selection dialog.\nThanks!. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @taylankasap Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @taylankasap Yes, that way is fine. Since elFinder does not record the file size when deleting files, you need to obtain the size of the target item before deleting the file.\nAlternatively, if you extend the volume driver, you can record the size in file deletion. In that case extend the elFinderVolumeDriver :: delTree () method.. @vvzh Since server encoding and content encoding do not necessarily match, we can not accept this request.\nHowever, there is a way to use the bind option as a solution.\nphp\nfunction putConvEncord($cmd, &$args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    if (! empty($args['content'])) {\n        $args['content'] = $volume->convEncIn($args['content']);\n    }\n}\n$opts = array(\n    'bind' = array(\n        'put.pre' = array('putConvEncord'),\n    ),\n    'roots' => array(...),\n);\nI appreciate your contribution. \ud83d\udc4d . > Maybe it's incorrect too and needs a fix?\nYes, It is a bug. I'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ercanertan Which version of elFinder are you using? I checked on newest elFinder with imglib 'imagick', 'gd' and 'convert' but it was no problem.. > Also I released when I use 'bind' to reduce the file size, rename/backup pop up doesn't appear and overwriting current image.\nThat is an already fixed bug of plugin Sanitizer. See #1310.\nAnd, Please use lateset elFinder. Thanks!. @max-wen elFinder >= 2.1.18 exclude php folder. (see #1354, #1711) Please use composer to get php folder.. @max-wen The value of displayTextLabel is store to browser local strage. The config setting value is applied when there is no value in local storage.\nThanks!. @max-wen Sorry, I found a bug in ui/toolbar.js. so I'll fix it.. @max-wen Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @taylankasap Please use this.hashes(hashes) for getting selected items hash.\njavascript\nthis.exec = function(hashes) {\n    var selHashes = this.hashes(hashes);\n    console.log(selHashes);\n}. The hashes parameter is assigned a target when called from a context menu or the like. When an item is selected and called from the toolbar, it is necessary to acquire the selected items.\nsee https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/js/elFinder.command.js#L271-L282. @mungurs There is an option id of connector configuration.\ne.g.\n'roots'  => array(\n    array(\n        'id'     => 'a',\n        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n        'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n    )\n)\nhash become la_xxx. @starstrap We do not know about Tinymce-Image-Upload-Cakephp.

That is in no problems.. @isreehari This problem is caused by the fact that the elFinder class does not support multi-level directory creation when uploading. Please create a new Issue.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @limars This is a simple example to it. (Live demo)\n```javascript\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\n// Auto blur to mkdir and mkfile without rename\nelf.getUI('cwd').on('focus', '.elfinder-cwd-file-tmp textarea,.elfinder-cwd-file-tmp input', function() {\n    var input = this;\n    setTimeout(function() { \n        input.blur();\n    }, 100);\n});\n```. @irfane This is a simple example to disable \"copy\" command if include \"image\" in item name. (Live demo)\njavascript\nvar fm = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nvar disabledVals = {};\nfm.bind('open', function() {\n    // save default \"_disabled\" value of cwd\n    disabledVals = {};\n    $.each(fm._commands, function(name, obj){\n        disabledVals[name] = obj._disabled;\n    });\n})\n.bind('select', function(e) {\n    var sel = e.data.selected || [];\n    var images = $.map(sel, function(id) {\n        var file = fm.file(id);\n        return (file && file.name.match(/images/i))? file : null;\n    });\n    // restore default \"_disabled\" value of the \"copy\"\n    fm._commands.copy._disabled = disabledVals.copy;\n    if (images.length) {\n        // disable copy command if include \"image\" in item name\n        fm._commands.copy._disabled = true;\n        fm._commands.copy.update();\n    }\n});. The code I presented for the first time had an extra part. It can be made more simple.\njavascript\nfm.bind('select', function(e) {\n    var sel = e.data.selected || [];\n    var images = $.map(sel, function(id) {\n        var file = elf.file(id);\n        return (file && file.name.match(/images/i))? file : null;\n    });\n    if (images.length) {\n        elf._commands.copy.update(-1, elf._commands.copy.value);\n    }\n});\nso your code will become\njavascript\nelf.bind('select', function (e) {\n    // NOTE: `file.options.disabledCmds` is array of disabled commands\n    var sel = e.data.selected || [];\n    var disabledCmds = {};\n    $.each(sel, function (i, id) {\n        var file = elf.file(id);\n        if (file && file.options && file.options.disabledCmds) {\n            $.each(file.options.disabledCmds, function(n, name) {\n                disabledCmds[name] = true;\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    if (Object.keys(disabledCmds).length) {\n        $.each(disabledCmds, function (name) {\n            var cmd = elf._commands[name];\n            cmd.update(-1, cmd.value);\n        });\n    }\n});. What kind of file data does your connector return?\nIn the following code what results do you see in the console log?\njavascript\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nelf.bind('select', function (e) {\n    var sel = e.data.selected || [];\n    $.each(sel, function (i, id) {\n        var file = elf.file(id);\n        elf.log(file);\n    });\n});. This related to #1826 .. @CodeLyokoXtEAM \n\nAlso its must be saved last user selected values\n\nSince it is an example for demonstration, it is not to implement.\nThanks!. @phtsaibb It is necessary for exclude items that are not allowed to read on elFinder. However, if it can use a hard link, that can expect some performance improvement, so I will implement it like that.. @flack I'm checking on PHP 5.3.29 server. But I can't reproduce of this problem yet.\nI tried next steps.\n\nUpload elFider 2.1.19 to PHP 5.3.29 server\nRename connector.minimal.php.dist to connector.minimal.php\nMake new file\nUpload JPEG image file\nDupulicate image file\nRemove image file\nEdit text file\n\nThat's no problem.. It's in not clear but I'm guessing that registered midcom::get()->finish(); in the shutdown function may have some influence.. What about next?\nelFinderVolumeDriver.class.php\nphp\n    public function __destruct() {\n        if (! headers_sent()) {\n            $this->session->set($this->id, $this->sessionCache);\n        }\n    }. @flack I fixed this issue (maybe) @fc1153d243555d1bfdac0df82f59ecee4c5d8bc9.

Yes, elFinder load elfinder.min.css and theme.css automatically with using elfinder.min.js or elfinder.full.js. . @kerker Please check permission of the directory that volume root option [quarantine`](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#quarantine).. What is result of next test.php code?\n\ntest.php (save into same directory to your connector.php)\n```php\n<?php\nini_set( 'display_errors', 1 );\nerror_reporting(-1);\n\n$path = '../files/'; // value of volume roots option path\n$cwd = getcwd();\n$res1 = chdir($path . '.quarantine');\n$res2 = chdir($cwd);\nvar_dump($res1);\nvar_dump($res2);\n``. @melanholly Can that be handled by extendingfm.request ()`?\ne.g. (online demo)\njavascript\nvar fm = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nvar _fmRequest = fm.request;\nfm.request = function(opts) {\n    var cmd = (opts.data || opts).cmd;\n    if (cmd === 'open' || cmd === 'tree') {\n        if (! window.confirm('Are you OK?')) {\n            fm.trigger(cmd + 'done');\n            fm.error('It was canceled by you.');\n            if (cmd === 'tree') {\n                setTimeout(function() {\n                    // restore arrow state\n                    $('#' + fm.navHash2Id(opts.target))\n                        .removeClass('elfinder-subtree-loaded')\n                        .addClass(fm.res('class', 'navcollapse'));\n                }, 10);\n            }\n            return $.Deferred().reject();\n        }\n    }\n    return _fmRequest.call(fm, opts);\n};. I think that it is sufficient in many cases to cancel the request to the back end. By triggering an event from the request function, you can do that with elFinder 's bind function.\nIn the last sample it looks like the following. (online demo)\njavascript\nfm.bind('exec.open exec.tree', function(e) {\n    var cmd = e.type.substr(5),\n        opts = e.data.opts;\n    if (! window.confirm('Are you OK?')) {\n        fm.error('It was canceled by you.');\n        if (cmd === 'tree') {\n            setTimeout(function() {\n                // restore arrow state\n                $('#' + fm.navHash2Id(opts.target))\n                    .removeClass('elfinder-subtree-loaded')\n                    .addClass(fm.res('class', 'navcollapse'));\n            }, 10);\n        }\n        e.data.result = false;\n    }\n});\nIt is more complicated to set hook points for middleware in various parts of elFinder. Also, you have to think about what kind of parameters to pass each time.\nHow is the proposed event trigger from this request function? If that's OK, I'll add an event trigger point to the request function.\n. And, of course, it also supports asynchronous processing. (live demo)\njavascript\nfm.bind('execpre.open execpre.tree', function(e) {\n    var dfrd = $.Deferred(),\n        cmd = e.type.substr(8),\n        opts = e.data.opts;\n    fm.confirm({\n        title : '#1811 Test',\n        text  : 'Do you want to continue?',\n        accept: {\n            label    : 'btnYes',\n            callback : function() {\n                dfrd.resolve();\n            }\n        },\n        cancel: {\n            label    : 'btnNo',\n            callback : function() {\n                dfrd.reject();\n                if (cmd === 'tree') {\n                    setTimeout(function() {\n                        // restore arrow state\n                        $('#' + fm.navHash2Id(opts.target))\n                            .removeClass('elfinder-subtree-loaded')\n                            .addClass(fm.res('class', 'navcollapse'));\n                    }, 10);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    e.data.result = dfrd;\n});. @melanholly Thanks for your contribution. \ud83d\udc4d . I will not be able to do enough work. Also, since it is not an elFinder task, I will close this after a few days.. I will close this because there is no other response.. @richseyha There isn't GCS volume driver to elFinder. But you can use Superbalist/flysystem-google-cloud-storage on barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver. Please check out it.\nThanks!. @jhon100 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @navijo What is \"Drive\" that you say?. Do you want to mount fixed GoogleDrive storage for all access users? Or is it GoogleDrive for each individual?. OK. A refresh token is required to make a permanent mount.\nsimply example of volume roots option\nphp\narray(\n    'driver' => 'GoogleDrive',\n    'path' => '0Byxxxxxx', // folder ID\n    'refresh_token' => '1/S-p6xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\n),\nTo acquire the refresh token with elFinder, you can check it on the debug tab of the info dialog displayed in the debug mode of the connector by mounting with offline access options when mounting as a network drive.\ne.g.\n\n. @AnilaKhan10 There are things you need to do to solve yourself. For example, to search on Google ...\nIn this case PHP version is too low. It is also specified in the google-api-php-client documentation.\n\nRequirements : PHP 5.4.0 or higher\n. @gebrerv In such a case, it seems that PHP is executed with each user privilege with FastCGI etc. in many cases. If that is impossible, you need to save it as metadata associated with the file in some database and return the owner information with the expanded volume driver.. \"Using LocalFileSystem together with MySQL #1808\" It may help you. And since this issue is not an issue of elFinder, close it.\n\nThanks!. @irfane Yes, That is a bug so I'll fix it. Thanks!. @romaricdrigon Thanks for your contribution! \ud83d\udc4d . @romaricdrigon I think that it is better to use the disabled option instead of increasing the new setting. To do that, I think that cwdOptions should be able to specify each option specific to each folder, and volOptions will need to correspond to each folder specification.\nI will consider how to implement it. I will open a new issue when I found a solution.. I opened new a issue #1826. so I'll close this when #1826 fixed.. @kkotowick There is no setting item, but it can be hidden by CSS.\ne.g. (Online demo)\ncss\n.elfinder-toast .toast-success {\n    visibility: hidden;\n}. @kkotowick \n\n'dispInlineRegex' => '.'\n\nSince it is a regular expression, 'dispInlineRegex' => '.*' Is required to allow all types inline. However, whether it is displayed inline or not is controlled by the browser.. Oh! OK, I done fixed Wiki. However, Did you get clear about this issue?. To play media using the browser window on a network drive, you need to publish the target item. You can use the getFileCallback option to open a file and publish it at the same time.\nsimple example\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    url  : 'php/connector.php',\n    getFileCallback : function(file, fm) {\n        fm.exec('open', file.hash);\n    }\n}\n$('#elfinder').elfinder(options);\n.

Until then you can try it with the nightly build. When you try, do not forget to clear the browser cache.. @98549844 That is the subject of bluejoe 2008/elfinder-2.x-servlet, not Studio-42/elFinder. Please report with bluejoe 2008/elfinder-2.x-servlet.. @paulcanning \"Processing the uploaded file\" means that the item uploaded to the web server is being uploaded to GCS. On network drives often require considerably more time than uploading to the web server. Also, since elFinder does not have an API to know the progress status on the Web server, it can not display its progress.. It is impossible with the current elFinder API.. If you use FlySystem, you need to upload the file to the web server. To send directly to GCS stream, you need to send it directly to GCS from the browser. elFinder does not have such a mechanism.. FlySystem supports streams. The situation does not change even if the connector driver of elFinder on web server directly uses the GCS adapter.\nThe elFinder client does not have an API to access the GCS connector or GCS directly.\nData sequence of the file upload\n```\n                Browser      Web server         GCS\nShow first progress|------------->|              |\n                   |Chunked upload|              |\nRedraw progress bar|<-------------|              |\n                   |------------->|              |\n                   |Chunked upload|              |\nRedraw progress bar|<-------------|              |\nShow 2nd progress  |------------->|              |\n                   |     Done     |              |\n                   |              |------------->|\n                   |              |Chunked upload|\n                   |              |<-------------|\n                   |              |------------->|\n                   |              |Chunked upload|\n                   |              |<-------------|\n                   |              |------------->|\n                   |              |     Done     |\n                   |              |<-------------|\n                   |              |    Results   |\nRedraw progress bar|<-------------|              |\n                   |   Results    |              |\n```. Have you understood the diagram of \"Data sequence of the file upload\"? It is as shown in that figure.\nTo upload directly from the browser to GCS, you need to have a connector that works with JavaScript. We do not have that plan.\nThere is no choice but to wait for you to make or someone else to make it.. I do not know what you want, but FileStream's handling is as follows.\n\nelFinder client do chunked upload to elFinder connector\nAfter upload is complete, elFinder connector pass thru file stream to FlySystem driver\nFlySystem driver pass thru file stream to FlySystem\nFlySystem pass thru file stream to GCS adapter\n\nIf the GCS adapter can handle file streams, I think uploading to GCS will be done in the stream,  but I do not know that part.. - elFinder client do upload to elFinder connector\n- After upload is complete, elFinder connector pass thru file stream to FlySystem driver\n- FlySystem driver pass thru file stream to FlySystem\n- FlySystem pass thru file stream to GCS adapter\n.

OK, In that case, please overwrite elFinder.request().\ne.g.\njavascript\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nvar elf_request = elf.request;\nelf.request = function(opts) {\n    if (opts.data && opts.data.cmd && opts.data.cmd === 'search') {\n        opts.data.q_private = opts.data.q;\n        delete opts.data.q;\n    }\n    return elf_request.call(elf, opts);\n};. Please assign parameter q_private to q in your connector.\nphp\nif (isset($_POST['q_private'])) {\n    $_POST['q'] = $_POST['q_private'];\n}\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();. @learningcentrum files/.tmb or indicated by connector setting tmbPath is nothing or you do not have write permission, or the setting oftmbURL in the connector setting is incorrect.. files/.tmb is a writable directory. If tmbPath is not specified, the child directory .tmb of the directory specified by the path option is used as the thumbnail directory.. If there is no mistake in the setting of tmbPath and tmbURL, there may be a memory shortage of PHP.\nsee #1922.. Oh, is it a permission problem? Is it possible to solve by setting the permission of the thumbnail directory to 777?. @vahidalvandi This is duplicate to #1331. . @paulcanning Yes.\nUse connector roots option accessControl.\ne.g.\n```php\nfunction access($attr, $path, $data, $volume, $isDir) {\n    // set locked all of folder\n    if ($attr === 'locked' && $isDir) {\n        return true;\n    }\nreturn null; // or your controlling code\n\n}\n``. @vahidalvandi Use connector option [bind`](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#bind).\nFor example\nphp\nfunction hashedName(&$path, &$name, $src, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    $ext = '';\n    if ($pos = strrpos($name, '.')) {\n        $ext = substr($name, $pos);\n    }\n    $name = md5($name) . $ext; // With your preferred hashing method\n}\nphp\n$opts = array(\n    'bind' => array(\n        'upload.presave' => array(\n            'hashedName',\n        ),\n    ),\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n        )\n    )\n);. What is problem? Would you show me your configuration.. There are bugs of plugins Sanitizer and Normalizer (#1983). I'll fix it.\nBy the way, if you make hash of filenames, you do not need to process them with those plugins.. The function hashedName must be in the global scope.\nOR uses as elFinderVolumeMyLocalFileSystem menbar.\nstatic public function hashedName(&$path, &$name, $src, $elfinder, $volume) {\nAnd\nphp\n'upload.presave' => array(\n    'elFinderVolumeMyLocalFileSystem::hashedName',\n),. @limars That's OK.\n\nshow notify\n    fm.notify({type : 'copy', cnt : 1, hideCnt: true});\nclose notify\n    fm.notify({type : 'copy', cnt : -1});. @Greendeviate There is a client configuration option defaultView to set default view.\n\nTransition to full screen is impossible without user intervention. That is the specification of the browser. However, it is possible to fit in the browser window. See #1965(Nightly build or 2.1.24 or later required).\n. @SquawkWoof If the setting of the path is correct, I guess it restricted by PHP setting \"open_basedir\".. Umm... I'm not sure. Can you debug of createTmb() of class elFinderVolumeDriver?. @donShakespeare OK. I'll make an option driverId so that it can be specified more easily.. Done, Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @dleffler Since sends data from the connector may contain HTML tags, we can not accept this proposal. Please sanitize your own data separately. Or use fm.escape() to escape on client side.. Give that payload to the elFinder connector, the next response will be returned.\n\n{\"error\":[\"errOpen\",\"#l1_asdl<object allowscriptaccess=always> <param name=url value=http:\\/\\/mhz.pw\\/game\\/xss\\/alert.swf>\",\"errFolderNotFound\"]}\n\nThis is the error dialog displayed by that data.\n\nIt does not seem to be vulnerable to XSS.\n. I am testing in debug mode, but I can not reproduce this problem.\nCould you explain the detailed procedure to reproduce this problem?. Yes, I understood. I was checking the display on the wlFinder client. text/plain should be returned in the content type when debugging.. @SkyTaurus What about\nphp\n'bind' => [ 'open upload' => ['addExtra'] ]\nphp\nfunction addExtra($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    if ($cmd === 'open' || ! empty($result['added'])) {\n        // your job\n        // you can change value of `$result` directly\n        $result['sync'] = 1; // to force refresh cwd\n    }\n}. Here is a related issue, see #1808.. Sorry, There was a mistake in the previous comment.\nPlease change $result to &$result. (I edited previous comment)\nAnd set $result['sync'] = 1; to refresh cwd.. @navijo Yes, that is possible. However, interlocking with a login system that can store user data is necessary.\nFor example $user is the user object of the login user and you can get the data type indicated by $type for $key with $user->getUserData($key, $type), And You can save the user data with $user->setUserData($key, $val).\n```php\n<?php\n$userDataKey = 'elfNetVolumes';\n// Bind Function: Save netvolumes data to user data storage\nfunction setNetVolumeDataToUserData($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder) {\n    if (is_object($user && (!empty($result['sync']) || !empty($result['added']) || !empty($result['removed']))) {\n        $user->setUserData($userDataKey, $elfinder->getSession()->get('netvolume', array()));\n    }\n}\n// Create a session handler object beforehand.\n$sessionOpts = array(\n    // Optional\n    //'base64encode' => false,\n    //'keys' => array(\n    //  'default'   => 'elFinderCaches',\n    //  'netvolume' => 'elFinderNetVolumes'\n    //)\n);\n$session = new elFinderSession($sessionOpts);\n// Set user netvolumes data to session if it has not\nif (is_object($user) && $session->get('netvolume') !== null) {\n    $session->set('netvolume', $user->getUserData($userDataKey, array()));\n}\n// make options of  elFinder\n$opts = array(\n    'session' => $sesstion, // set session handler\n    'bind' => array(\n        // bind to setNetVolumeDataToUserData() on netmount\n        'netmount' => array('setNetVolumeDataToUserData')\n    ),\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n        )\n    )\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n``. Thanks! Good luck!. @donShakespeare You can catch toolbar refresh event by elFinder eventtoolbarload`.\njavascript\nfm.bind('toolbarload', function() {\n    // add your changes\n    // .....\n    // trigger `uiresize` If the height of the toolbar changes\n    fm.trigger('uiresize');\n});. @RobiNN1 Thanks!. @RobiNN1 Thanks!. @dennisfair Perhaps PHP settings memory_limit or post_max_size values are less than the upload_max_filesize value.. @marcelwirtz elFinder handles $_SESSION directly only in the elFinderSession class (elFinderSession.php). Also, elFinder does not touch about session variable members unknown to elFinder.\nHowever, in order to support multi-access, elFinder closes sessions early during command execution, so there is a possibility of improving by saving your session data before executing elFinder connector.. My commitment (da0ee16b2768935926b6626c7a10d1b5009557cf) may have been wrong.\nChange in line 66 of elFinderSession.php\nphp\nif ($this->started && $this->prevVal !== $_SESSION) {\nto\nphp\nif ($this->started) {\nIt may be solved by this one change. Could you test it?. If restore the $_SESSION variable, elFinder session data will not be saved. Perhaps the database column size is too small?. I checked with next simple test case.\n```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\nif (empty($_SESSION['mySessionData'])) {\n    $_SESSION['mySessionData'] = time();\n}\n$mySessionData = $_SESSION['mySessionData'];\n$opts = array(\n    'bind' => array(\n        'open' => array(function($cmd, &$result) {\n            global $mySessionData;\n            $result['myDebug'] = $mySessionData;\n        }),\n    ),\n    'roots' => array(\n        array(\n            'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',           // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n            'path'          => '../files/',                 // path to files (REQUIRED)\n            'URL'           => dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) . '/../files/', // URL to files (REQUIRED)\n            'uploadDeny'    => array('all'),                // All Mimetypes not allowed to upload\n            'uploadAllow'   => array('image', 'text/plain'),// Mimetype image and text/plain allowed to upload\n            'uploadOrder'   => array('deny', 'allow'),      // allowed Mimetype image and text/plain only\n        )\n    )\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```\nIn this case, the value of $_SESSION['mySessionData'] is retained.\nCould you please re-check your session handler?. @axelocz What about nightly build?\nAdded:\nIs the number of XHR requests OK? There may be a lot of requests due to an infinite loop.. There was a part to worry about, so I tried to fix it. Please try it with the nightly build.. First, from the point I noticed. It is necessary to return the value of api in the response of the initial request.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.1#open. OK, go next. Object tree is not needed.. I checked with next simple test script, but there was no problems.\n\ntest.php\nphp\n<?php\nif (! empty($_GET['init'])) {\n    $file = 'elfinder_server-resp-simple.txt';\n} else {\n    $file = 'elfinder_server-resp-reload.txt';\n}\nreadfile($file);\n\nset elFinder client option url to 'test.php';\nopen elFinder\ntrigger command reload\n\nThat's no problem.. I think that there is no problem if it is jQuery 1.8.0+. Please let me know if there is a correction to elFinder side.. Please inform me of all JSON responses from initial request to hangs to reproduce in my environment.. 3-open-home.txt data invalid.\n\nSelf hash is specified in the phash parameter of the cwd object.\nThe files object does not contain the data of the Home directory.. I took measures to prevent infinite loops with unauthorized response data in elFinder. So close this issue. Please fix so that your backend connector will send the correct data.\n\nThanks!. @ShinJii89 There is similar issue #1808.. @Greendeviate I started to develop #1065. Please wait that function. Thanks!. Closes via 1f1e6ea384bee66f8641c921441b38a9ade85644. @SkyTaurus This problem seems to be due to the function you specified for bind. It can not be solved here.. Oh, OK. I got it. I think that it has been fixed by the previous correction. Please try the nightly build.. If the target volume can not be detected, $dstVolume became to false. In callback, it is necessary to correspond to the case of false.. @SkyTaurus This cause was found and fixed. Thanks!. @CodeLyokoXtEAM \n\nYou can delete it without going through the trash by Ctrl + Delete or Delete icon in the context menu.\nIt is necessary to remember the folder tree.\nI implemented the restore function. In Trash Volume, the copy command is replaced with the restore command. Also, the cut command is left for when the restore destination can not be detected.\n\nThanks!. OK, Try to disable dropping in the trash.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks!. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! However, when restoring folders, Do not check recursively the folders.. > Folders don't want to rename.\nI think so... I'll try it.. @onionstand Please check PHP error.\nFor example,\nphp\nerror_reporting(-1);\nini_set('log_errors', 1);\nini_set('error_log', 'Path of the log file you want');. If you do not know the error message it will be difficult to solve it. I think this is due to the server environment so I close it. Please re-open and let me know what problem if you find elFinder's bug.\nThanks.. @thanhansoft There is an option disabled in connector roots options. However, since elFinder does not have user control function, it needs to be combined with some kind of login system.. If you read and installed the \"install\" page of the wiki, it is php / connector.minimal.php. Other than that, we do not know.. @Jahedur elFinder catch the drop data in js/commands/upload.js:197-214.  Would you explain which data should be caught here?. @Ange7 Yes, dropbox-php/dropbox-php(Dropbox API  v1) will be unavailable soon and will be fixed.. I done that. Thanks!. To use the new Dropbox driver please install kunalvarma05/dropbox-php-sdk.\ncomposer require kunalvarma05/dropbox-php-sdk\nThen make the following settings with the connector.\n```php\nelFinder::$netDrivers['dropbox2'] = 'Dropbox2';\n// Dropbox2 Netmount driver need next two settings. You can get at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps\n// AND reuire regist redirect url to \"YOUR_CONNECTOR_URL?cmd=netmount&protocol=dropbox2&host=1\"\ndefine('ELFINDER_DROPBOX_APPKEY',    '');\ndefine('ELFINDER_DROPBOX_APPSECRET', '');\n``. Do not need dropbox-php/dropbox-php.composer remove dropbox-php/dropbox-php. @ahjamshidi Alsowidthandheightare mandatory forcrop`.. Oh! my... You are right! I'll fix it.. @ahjamshidi Thanks!. @JuanWilde Have you read the Wiki bind entry?. > But my issue is that I don't know where to place the callback function in my laravel project to catch events.\nAbout laravel, you may not get an answer here. Ask in the barryvdh/laravel-elfinder or community of laravel.\n. @ratmalwer It is probably the same problem as #1994. Can you catch anything about PHP errors?. Okay, it may be because the Web server was unstable???, I'll close this Issue.. @emitchan There is no problem for me. Please try clearing browser cache and data storage.. I checked your site with Firefox 53.0.2(64bit) that was no problem.\nScreen shot -> http://oc.emit.hk/files/image.png. @shinokada I'll add an option to the Normalizer plugin that convert umlauts with their closest 7 bit ascii equivalent.. I done. You can try it with nightly build. Thanks!. @SkyTaurus #1632 will help you.. OK, You can use jQueryUI widget droppable. This is very simple example. (Online Demo)\nhtml\n<div id=\"elfinder\"></div>\n<div id=\"drop\" style=\"width:100%;height:100px;border:solid 2px gray;\"></div>\n```javascript\nvar fm = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\n$('#drop').droppable({\n    accept : '.elfinder-cwd-file-wrapper,.elfinder-tree-dir,.elfinder-cwd-file',\n    over : function(e, ui) {\n        var helper = ui.helper;\n        e.stopPropagation();\n        helper.data('dropover', helper.data('dropover') + 1);\n        helper.addClass('elfinder-drag-helper-plus');\n        fm.trigger('unlockfiles', {files : helper.data('files'), helper: helper});\n    },\n    out : function(e, ui) {\n        var helper = ui.helper,\n            ctr    = (e.shiftKey||e.ctrlKey||e.metaKey);\n        e.stopPropagation();\n        helper.toggleClass('elfinder-drag-helper-move elfinder-drag-helper-plus', helper.data('locked')? true : ctr).data('dropover', Math.max(helper.data('dropover') - 1, 0));\n        fm.trigger(ctr? 'unlockfiles' : 'lockfiles', {files : helper.data('files'), helper: helper});\n    },\n    drop : function(e, ui) {\n        var helper  = ui.helper,\n            res = [];\n    // set helper data and hide\n    helper.data('droped', true).hide();\n    // helper.data('files') has target item hashes\n    $.each(helper.data('files'), function(i, hash) {\n        var file = fm.file(hash);\n        if (file) {\n            res.push(file.hash + ' : ' + file.name);\n        }\n    });\n    $(this).html(res.join('<br>'));\n}\n\n});\n```. @Yves-K I'm not sure. How do you start dragging from hidden elFinder?. @Ange7 If your server is not Windows, I guess that it is not a PHP timeout but a Web server timeout. If that is the cause, you will need to change the web server settings.. @Qh0stM4N Because the path encoding method can be changed with the volume driver, the client side does not implement a function to decode it.\nHowever, if it is the default encoding method, it can be decoded as follows.\njavascript\nvar hash = 'l1_RG93bmxvYWRz';\nvar encPath = hash.substr(hash.indexOf('_')+1);\nvar path = '/'+atob(encPath.replace(/\\-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/\\./g, '='));. @harryarnold79 Please check volume roots option URL. Probably that configuration is wrong.. @dleffler There is an exsample in connector.minimal.php-dist.\nAlso note the access function.. This specification to makes it possilbe to the Trash function without extends current API.\nI strongly recommend that you set the same permissions as the target volume as a countermeasure against attack using the Trash.\nAs an example of allowing only root directory names beginning with \".\", There is an access () function in connector.minimal.php-dist.\nphp\n/**\n * Simple function to demonstrate how to control file access using \"accessControl\" callback.\n * This method will disable accessing files/folders starting from '.'

And please don't forget clearing browser cache.. @alexandre51 I fixed. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @newbie7777 It is impossible at present. It is possible to extend the function to provide preset values, but do you need it?. Yep, Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Nuvolect The description about \"cdc - dim\" in the document is API 1, so API 2.0 or later is not necessary. I deleted the description earlier.\nWhich connector do you use?. No request is made by XHR at the time the resize dialog is opened. Is there a JavaScript error?. What about using jQueryUI 1.12.1?. Not jQuery 1.12.1, JQueryUI 1.12.1.\nOr, Have you loading any other JavaScript libraries?. This is caused by conflicts with the bootstrap. Since there are similar issues in the past, I'll take measures on the elFinder side.\nrel. #740, #1398, #1620. @Nuvolect Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM Good idea! I'll try it.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Good idea! I'll try it.. There is no problems.\nLive demo\n\nHTML & JavaScript - http://jsbin.com/wohisuq/edit?html,js\nResult View - http://output.jsbin.com/wohisuq. @Cyril6789 There is an error in require.js. Please refer to elfinder.legacy.html and try not to use require.js.. @Cyril6789 elFinder disables key bindings when focus is not on. I fixed that this problem is affecting that having focus in the initial state has affected it.\n\nProblem may be solved in nightly build. Please make opportunities and try it.. @jasneet-bhatia I'm sorry I can not understand what you mean.. It is impossible to connect to FTP without such information unless that FTP server allows anonymous users to connect.. @vahidalvandi Perhaps the file that defines the class is not loaded.. @Jeffery4000 This is currently nightly's bug. I'll fix it.. @Jeffery4000 Thanks!. @ammarfaizi2 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d .

If you want to upload a file with Base64, it is not a general usage of elFinder, so it can not be supported here. You will need to design both the backend and the client. Please challenge yourself.. @jasneet-bhatia Please set the MIME type of the template file to be text.\n\nIn Connector config additionalmimemap.\n. @shahab19 It is probably due to server setting. Please check the server upload settings.. @chrrusch Please open the downloaded file with a text editor. Are there any error messages?.

For example, file deletion is unlink(). It is difficult to respond if files can not be processed with these functions.. Did you check the permissions?. Yes, it is. Is the owner of the folder a PHP execution account? If not, please change it to 0777 and so on.. Also, please set error_reporting (-1) in connector(.mimimal).php and check whether error is output to server response.. If the folder name and the file name are ASCII character strings, the locale problem will not occur.\nBy the way. You said \"Error: Invalid backend response. Data is not JSON.\" in the first. Can you check HTTP responce at that case?. OK, Probably, elFinder version is old. Please try the latest 2.1.24 or nightly build.. Is it same to \"Fatal error: Uncaught ArgumentCountError: Too few arguments to function access(), 5 passed in /home/psltr/.app/apache2/htdocs/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php on line 3677\"? line 3677?. @Jeffery4000 I found a bug! I'll fix it. Really thanks!.     I done fixes. Please check with nightly build. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @mcarpenterjr There is no fundamental solution at the moment. There is a related issue #1879.\nAs a workaround you can try the checkSubfolders volume root option. (false: disable or-1: ondemand). Since the value of \"checkSubfolders\" is evaluated after converting it to an integer, -1 or \"-1\" both is vaild.\nIt is unintended behavior that the CPU is consumed with file (download) oropen (file open) commands. Since these commands are requested by specifying the target file, they are not usually heavily loaded. There may be bugs in something, but in my environment there is no problem.\nPlease let me know if you find a problem.\nIn Nightly build, request optimization at the time of directory tree acquisition is applied. Please try it too.\n. @Jeffery4000  \"In to Trash\" takes more time than deletion. If it is more than the prescribed number of items, I'll consider a mechanism to shift to delete command.. @Jeffery4000 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @newbie7777 I have a plan that add a button \"Save As\" into the resize dialog. I'll push to github it soon.\n\n. @newbie7777 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @vijaykumarkn Probably JavaScript has stopped with some error. It may be conflicting with another script that is loading the page.

Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @FLsales3 What connector do you use? It probably is due to connector problems or file permissions on the server.. I thought that you were using a third party connector. Are you using the standard PHP connector elFinder? OK, If you have problems after updating elFinder, please try the nightly build.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @joshribakoff This is a client bug. I'll fix it. Thanks!. @joshribakoff This is a PHP connector bug. I'll fix it. Thanks!. @joshribakoff This seems to be caused by a bug in #2050. It will be solved with #2050.. @N73dp Since it is difficult to handle with JavaScript, such as content encoding and binary file handling, we do not plan to add this function at the moment.. @w32gold This is probably because your server is Windows. Since Windows's directory separator is \\, it has a hash value different from Linux etc. However, since the user will be confused, I will also add an option on Windows server that can use the same hash value as Linux etc ... @w32gold Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d You can try nightly build until release elFinder 2.1.25.. @SeymurHashimov There is a similar issues.

Please use the latest version (2.1.25 at currently).\nAlso, please do check operation with Nightly Build when reporting bugs.\nThanks.. @ioaoue Is there a problem with Nightly build too? I verified with PHP connector 2.0 and 2.1, but there was no problem. Ask the developer of the Java connector because there is a possibility of a problem with the Java connector. If you find any problems with elFinder's client side program, please let me know as I will fix it.. Perhaps the result of your connector's ls command is incorrect.\n\nelFinder requests the ls command in the preprocessing of the upload and checks the existing item. If the uploading file name is exists in results of ls and CWD does not have that file, elFinder will request the open command and try to keep the CWD up to date.\nIt seems to be a bug in elFinder. Since I attempted to fix it please check with Nightly build.. What data will your connector return to the ls command?. The value returned by the ls command should be an object of item name with hash as key ( or array of item names). If intersect is given as a parameter, it is advisable to return only the item names that overlap in the array.\n\nI edited Wiki - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.1#ls . Please check out it.. @ioaoue Thank you for your report. \ud83d\udc4d . Fixed via 7e2750443816253c1ddc99cea91389bed0bda121 . @rajayogadharasan Thanks!. @mducharme Thanks! Sorry for being late.. @froid24 elFinder (official PHP connector) has no setting disks. Since I guess you are integrating with some framework, ask the developers of that framework.\nThanks.. @cpnemo19 Thanks! Would you make a pull request? It's easy by edit icon at https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php .. @cpnemo19 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @tseho Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @EroticCode I re-written Wiki - Integration with CodeIgniter. Please check out it.. @MickaelTH There is an option disabled of connector roots option. If you want to disable zipdl command, Please set 'disabled' => array('zipdl').\nHowever, since I think that you may want to disable only downloading files while keeping directory zipdl enabled, I plan to add client option commandOptions.download.minFilesZipdl.\njavascript\ncommandOptions : {\n        download : {\n            // max request to download files when zipdl disabled\n            maxRequests : 10,\n            // minimum count of files to use zipdl\n            minFilesZipdl : 2\n        }\n}. @MickaelTH Which connector are you using? Official PHP connector? Which is version? And please check and inform added of server response of upload command request. \nlike this\n\"added\":[{\"isowner\":false,\"ts\":1500553910,\"mime\":\"text\\/plain\",\"read\":1,\"write\":1,\"size\":\"3268\",\"hash\":\"l2_dGVzdC50eHQ\",\"name\":\"test.txt\",\"phash\":\"l2_Lw\",\"url\":\"\\/\\/hypweb.net\\/elFinder-nightly\\/demo\\/develop\\/files\\/test.txt\"}]. > Any help to start investigation should be appreciate. And I am sorry I don't know where to add \"added\" you asked above.\nPlease check the value of the \"added\" parameter of the JSON data of the server response. If the \"size\" value in the data is incorrect, I think there is a problem with the SFTP adapter or cache mechanism.\n. @MickaelTH Sorry for my poor English. The meaning I said is to check the response data from the server. If there is a problem with the added data in the server response, it means that it is a problem on the connector side.. @MickaelTH , @heyonghong  The cause of this problem seems to be in barryvdh / elfinder-flysystem-driver. I confirmed that the problem is solved by disabling the cache setting of elfinder-flysystem-driver.\nfor example\nphp\n[\n    'driver' => 'Flysystem', \n    'path' => '/',\n    'filesystem' => new Filesystem(new SftpAdapter([\n        'host' => 'example.com',\n        'port' => 22,\n        'username' => 'username',\n        'password' => 'password',\n        'privateKey' => 'path/to/or/contents/of/privatekey',\n        'root' => '/path/to/root',\n        'timeout' => 10,\n        'directoryPerm' => 0755\n    ])),\n    'cache' => false, // 'session', 'memory' or false\n]. OK, I found an elFinder's bug of PHP volume driver. so I'll fix it.. @MickaelTH I am planning to release 2.1.27 within one to two weeks. Please wait for that 2.1.27, or update it with Developer Channel until then.\ncomposer require studio-42/elfinder:2.1.x-dev. @Chaffinch Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d closes #2109 . @thatobabusi There is a config accessControl of volume roots options on elFinder PHP connector. We can control thoroughly by callback function registered in accessControl. However, I do not know how to use the Laravel user role, so please ask in the Laravel community.\nThanks!\n. @Chaffinch Thank you for your work.\n\nI tried to change in file: https://github.com/Chaffinch/elFinder-Ver-2.1.26/blob/master/js/commands/help.js\n\nYes, you are right. It's OK. so I marged your commits 83fc8094474bda02ac0e1ecbf660f0bd53bb5164 and 440a8eee1ed4a0fff3e25d5de243859266451758 in to master branch.\nThanks again! \ud83d\udc4d . @russh3l Please check out Wiki - Connector root option uploadAllow, uploadDeny and uploadOrder..

(It can not be invalidated) I can not think of the situation of the request that the installer wants to invalidate it...\nHowever, I'll be waiting for you if there is a better proposal.\nThanks!. It was my simple mistake and it has already been fixed (deb02bdcb68ff0a3e09adcb52450f8ea3825f0e2).\nThanks!. That's nice! I'll try it. I think that it is better to always display it in the context menu. And, I think that the automatic display on the tool bar is optional.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM I done. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @terraplane This seems to be a ruby on rails connector problem. Please ask the developer of that connector.\nThanks.. @alsantos123 To do that you need to get an access token.\ne.g\nphp\narray(\n    'driver' => 'OneDrive',\n    'path' => '/', // or folder ID (not path)\n    'accessToken' => '{\"expires\":1501753851,\"data\":{\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3600,\"scope\":\"wl.skydrive_update wl.offline_access\",\"access_token\":\"xxxxxxxxxx\"}}',\n),\n. You can find access token in the debug tab of the help dialog with debug mode (in connector configuration).\n\n. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . OK, I will adjust it to go to the left a little more.. @extend1994 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @codemilan I'll fix it. It is a bug that the SaveAS button is shows even though saving of the image file is not allowed.\nThanks!. @Chaffinch Would you please send pull request?. OK, I merged at 5ba56d6d67671097e3888e1fed1d2e3d4453bafc. By the way, it is very helpful to use the Pull Request. I'm glad to if you sent pull requests in the future. \nThanks!. @ashickurnoor Register the command to open the upload dialog with bind in the \"load\" event.\njavascript\nvar fm = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nfm.bind('load', function() {\n    fm.one('open', function() {\n        fm.exec('upload', [fm.cwd().hash]);\n    });\n});. maybe... do not use elFinder in global scope.\n```javascript\nvar elFinderInstance = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    url : 'explorer/php/connector.minimal.php',\n    ui : [],\nwidth : 600,\nheight: 400\n\n}).elfinder('instance');\nelFinderInstance.bind('load', function(){\n    elFinderInstance.one('open', function(){\n      elFinderInstance.exec('upload', [elFinder.cwd().hash]);\n    });\n  });\norjavascript\n(function() {\n  var elFinder = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n    url : 'explorer/php/connector.minimal.php',\n    ui : [],\nwidth : 600,\nheight: 400\n\n}).elfinder('instance');\nelFinder.bind('load', function(){\n    elFinder.one('open', function(){\n      elFinder.exec('upload', [elFinder.cwd().hash]);\n    });\n  });\n})();\n```. @Dee-Fuse Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @coderubyonrails The client side command is elFinder.command.js as the base object, and each commands are extended object. If you find a command similar to the command you are trying to make, the code of that command will be helpful.\nEach command is executed by exec function of elfinder.js. An array of hashes (ID) of the target item is passed as the first argument, and an object (associative array) according to the case is passed as the second argument.\nCommand execution is often done by click event of a button on the toolbar or click event of the context menu.\nThe toolbar button is js/ui/button.js, and the context menu is js/ui/contextmenu.js is the source code.\nFor your happy coding!\n. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM This is the specification of the PHP connector. The PHP connector detects MIME type by file contents by default. To detect by file extension, please set 'mimeDetect' => 'internal' with the volume roots option.. @yangzhengpk Sorry, I don't understand Chinese, so would you please post with English?. see #2137. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @yangzhengpk \n\n\nWhen using elFinder on a Windows server, you need to specify the proper locale and encoding of connector roots options. Please investigate appropriate values in each country.\n\n\nOne of the reasons why files can not be uploaded on Linux servers is that directory permissions are insufficient.. If the directory permission referred to by elFinder is 0777, there is no permission problem. There is something else problematic. Can you show your elFinder's connector settings?. The screenshot showss that PHP's execution account is not authorized to write to the \"files\" directory.\n\n\nAlso, it is not normally necessary for permissions of all files and directories to be 0777.\nI think this problem is specific to your server. I think that you should learn more about web server operation.. @Yves-K The setting is 'lang' only. However, since the previous language is stored in the browser, you need to initialize the settings on the Preferences tab of the help dialog to check the initial status.. @rajayogadharasan I don't know about connectors other than the official PHP connector. Please ask the developer of the connector you are using.\nThanks.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . It is a problem of the theme. Please ask the developers of the theme, or adjust CSS by yourself.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM OK, I'll add CSS class \"elfinder-button-icon-mkdirin\" to button . I done at 09a26df32efcd2f5d434e00726d31cc85827c00a. (#2142). @bitbybit There is no API change of the Upload command. The Upload command requires target andFILES parameters. Are they sended in that request?. \"current\" is included in the parameter. Are you using the APIv1 connector? Which connector?. Ok, Please remove transport : new elFinderSupportVer1() from client configuration.. Umm... Which version of \"protocol version\" in help dialog?\n\n. \u2754 It is very strange...\nWould you show the response of the initial request (cmd=open&target=&init=1&tree=1)?\nIs there a problem elFinder located in the public place? Please let me know the URL if it is open.. OK, Please try edit elFinder.class.php L.1287 '%.1f%03d' to '%.1F%03d'\nphp\n$result['api'] = sprintf('%.1f%03d', self::$ApiVersion, self::$ApiRevision);\nto \nphp\n$result['api'] = sprintf('%.1F%03d', self::$ApiVersion, self::$ApiRevision);. Yes! @bitbybit Thank you so much! \ud83d\udc4d I'll fix it!. @CodeLyokoXtEAM \"Home\", \"Up\", and \"Reload\" buttons are not displayed by default. However, since the user can now control the button display, they should be displayed by default as well.\nThen, the \"Select all\", \"Select none\", \"Invert selection\" button adds a new command and implements it.. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . The problem of \"BackPack Elfinder\" can not be solved here. Ask the developer of \"BackPack Elfinder\".\nIf you have problems with elFinder itself, please let me know with its contents.\nThanks.. @coderubyonrails It is a simple trick to suppress browser caching and request to the server.. @bitbybit Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . Currently, only \"elfinder-cwd-icon-image\" is given as the class name for files with MIME type \"image/*\". Since thumbnails may not be created even for image type files, so I'll make that \"elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-adobe-photoshop\" is also given.\nPlease be careful about the priority of CSS.\ncss\n.elfinder-cwd-icon-image:after, \n.elfinder-cwd-icon-postscript:after,\n.elfinder-cwd-icon-image, \n.elfinder-cwd-icon-postscript        { background-position:0 -250px;  }\n/* It must be defined after \"elfinder-cwd-icon-image\" */\n.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-adobe-photoshop:after, \n.elfinder-cwd-icon-vnd-adobe-photoshop { background-position:0 -xxxxpx;  }. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @w32gold This is not a bug. Please use 'file' instead 'download'.\ne.g\nphp\n'bind' => array(\n    'file' => array(function($cmd, $result, $args) {\n        if (! empty($args['download'])) {\n            $downloadInfo = $result['info'];\n        }\n    }),\n),.

Please send this SQL query.. What is results of $res = $this->query($sql); in elFinderVolumeMySQL.class.php L.535?. @arkytn Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @johnjohansen Do you have problems that CSV files can not be uploaded? \nIn that case, you can allow CSV file upload in the following way.\nconnector roots options\nphp\n'uploadDeny'    => array('all'),                // All Mimetypes not allowed to upload\n'uploadAllow'   => array('image', 'text/plain', 'text/csv'),// Mimetype `image` and `text/plain` allowed to upload\n'uploadOrder'   => array('deny', 'allow'),      // allowed Mimetype `image` and `text/plain` only. What is the MIME-type of *.csv in your elFinder? \"text/csv\"?\n\nIf it is \"text/csv\" it will be editable by reading js/extras/editors.default.js or js/extras/editors.default.min.js.\nsee\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/main.default.js\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/elfinder.legacy.html\n\n. Please check with next steps.\n\nDownload 2.1.28 and Extract to web server\nrename php/connector.minimal.php-dist to php/connector.minimal.php\nchange 'uploadAllow'   => array('image', 'text/plain'), to 'uploadAllow'   => array('image', 'text/plain', 'text/csv'),\ncheck CSV file on elfinder.html of your web server\n\nI tried this steps. It's no problems.\n. @arkytn Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @parkerj You can use an option getFileCallback.\n```javascript\ngetfile : {\n    onlyURL: false,\n    multiple: false,\n    folders: false,\n    oncomplete: 'destroy'\n},\ngetFileCallback : function(file) {\n    if (file.mime.match(/^image\\//i)) {\n        $(\"#page_image\").val(file.url);\n    var imgPath = '<img src=\"'+file.url+'\" id=\"append-image\" style=\"width:280px;height:auto;background-size:contain;margin-bottom:.9em;background-repeat:no-repeat\"/>';\n    $(\"#elfinder_image\").append(imgPath); //add the image to a div so you can see the selected images\n\n    $(\"#remove_image\").show();\n    $(\"#set_image\").hide();\n}\n\n}\n``\n(I have not tested it). @coderubyonrails I think that it is probably a problem of the gem backend, so please ask the developer of it.. @X-Coder You can use connector option [bind`](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#bind).\nphp\n'bind' => [\n    '*' => [function($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n        $addUrl = function(& $data) {\n            foreach($data as $idx => $file) {\n                if ($file['mime'] !== 'directory') {\n                    $data[$idx]['url'] = 'http://example.com/media/' . $file['hash'];\n                }\n            }\n        };\n        ! empty($result['files']) && $addUrl($result['files']);\n        ! empty($result['added']) && $addUrl($result['added']);\n        ! empty($result['changed']) && $addUrl($result['changed']);\n    }]\n]\n. @atefBB Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @atefBB Thank you, Please keep your mind!. @greggles We know that a security vulnerability exists in version 2.1.20 or earlier.

Also, please learn how to set uploadAllow, uploadDeny, uploadOrder.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#uploadorder. @berk-can OK, please try the Nightly build. Current nightly has item filter in client side but it is disabled in default. Previous version has not item filter.\n\nPlease don't forget clearing browser caches before checking.. Please check if the data of the video item is included in the response data from the server. You can determine whether the problem is on the connector side or on the client side.. @Flamenco Thare is an option validName in client configurations. Please check out this option.\njavascript\n    /**\n     * Additional rule to valid new file name.\n     * By default not allowed empty names or '..'\n     * This setting does not have a sense of security.\n     *\n     * @type false|RegExp|function\n     * @default  false\n     * @example\n     *  disable names with spaces:\n     *  validName : /^[^\\s]+$/,\n     */\n    validName : false,\n. Oh, you needed a filter for display. validName is a filter for for saving new names. It may be better to use the callback on the connector side. I will write that method later.. Simple example of the bind option\nphp\n'bind' => [\n    'open' => [function($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n        if (!empty($result['cwd'])) {\n            $cwdHash = $result['cwd']['hash'];\n            $cwdPath = $volume->getPath($cwdHash); // you can filtering with $cwdPath\n            if (!empty($result['files'])) {\n                $files = [];\n                foreach($result['files'] as $file) {\n                    if ($file['phash'] === $cwdHash && $file['mime'] !== 'directory') {\n                        $name = basename($volume->getPath($file['hash']));\n                        if (preg_match('/\\.txt$/i', $name)) {\n                            $files[] = $file;\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        $files[] = $file;\n                    }\n                }\n                $result['files'] = $files;\n            }\n        }\n    }]\n]. @Flamenco The client side would be more convenient if you need to set it dynamically. Please send PR. I would like to consider it.. see #2178. @Flamenco Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Flamenco Thanks! I edited to change option name filenameFilter to fileFilter and accept function.. Options example\njavascript\n{\n    // pdf files\n    fileFilter = /.*\\.pdf$/i\n}\n// or\n{\n    // png and jpg files\n    fileFilter = /.*\\.(png|jpg)$/i\n}\n// or\n{\n    // no hidden files \n    fileFilter = /[^\\.].*/\n}\n// or\n{\n    // check MIME-type\n    fileFilter = function(file) {\n        var self = this; // `this` is instance of elFinder object\n        return file.mime && file.mime.match(/^image\\//i); // type image only\n    }\n}. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Problem of table header is a bug. so I'll fix it.

I edited \"elfinderBasicAuth.js\". Please check out it.. Did you clear the browser's cache?. @phd0 There is no example for elFinder, but I think that a common example in PHP can be diverted. Based on login information, it is possible to control various kinds with connector.php.. @arubalucalasagni I'll fix it.. @arubalucalasagni Thank you so much! \ud83d\udc4d . @hintau I got it.

Please check out newest version of BasicAuthExample. I checked with iOS 11.0.2, that is work fine.. @Chaffinch Thanks! Please make a Pull Request to master branch.. I send PR to your master branch to make possible make pull request to Studio-42/master.. @RJRahevar That error message means that the elFinder client is requesting the \"src\" command, but there is no \"src\" in the official command. I guess there is a problem with the command you extended.. @ManuSori It seems that directory permissions are missing. Please check permissions and owner such as directory \"Carpeta\". Or if you can debug the FTP driver, check the raw data of the response from the FTP server.. @ManuSori Did you solve this problem? If you have anything to fix in elFinder, please propose that fix.. @ManuSori Thank you for your response. I got it, so I'll close this issue.\nThanks!. @bwaindwain elFinder is reading the complete image for obtaining the image size. Consider using AutoResize plugin if you are using PHP connector.. I think so that it is a good idea to acquire only the image size so that editing can be started as soon as possible, so I will implement it like that.\nOn the other hand, it is maybe useless to prepare images for the resize screen beforehand for all of the images so we will not adopt it this time.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @bwaindwain Please tell me about the network speed and the image file size that you assume.. @bwaindwain I done. I added the following two options on the client side config commandsOptions.resize.\njavascript\n// File size (bytes) threshold when using the `dim` command for obtain the image size necessary to start editing\ngetDimThreshold : 204800,\n// File size (bytes) to request to get substitute image (400px) with the `dim` command\ndimSubImgSize : 307200\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @daniresa This is an example to simply auth with HTTP header.

If there is no problem logging in, there probably is a problem with the connector setting. Please present your connector settings.. @daniresa It is necessary to switch the operation of the connector according to login information.

It seems that it is not properly booted up in the constructor.. @bwaindwain \"Here\" also includes the current folder and folders below it. To search only the current folder, please use incremental search (not press Enter).. @kaiqueg Please set connector roots options encoding and locale to fit to your server environment.. Volumes that have 'URL' set open files directly on the server whereas volumes that do not set 'URL' will open the file via elFinder's connector. In order to open the file directly on the server, you need to specify the volume encoding appropriately.. @gabrieldaj Your screenshot shows that the command on the .net connector is not valid. Please ask the developer of the .net connector.. Please check the wiki uiOptions and contextmenu.. @Heronbeluci elFinder requires a connector to scan the file system of the server. If you can only use NodeJS on the server, you need to have a connector for NodeJS.\nRefer to the wiki page for client / server connection API.. @huynhquocbao92 I can not accept your pull request to the Sanitizer plugin, but since I changed the sanitizeFileName function from private to protected, you can customize it with the extended class.\ne.g.\n- plugins\n    - MySanitizer\n        - plugin.php\nphp\n<?php\n/*\n * ex. binding, configure on connector options\n *  $opts = array(\n *      'bind' => array(\n *          'upload.pre mkdir.pre mkfile.pre rename.pre archive.pre ls.pre' => array(\n *              'Plugin.MySanitizer.cmdPreprocess'\n *          ),\n *          'ls' => array(\n *              'Plugin.MySanitizer.cmdPostprocess'\n *          ),\n *          'upload.presave' => array(\n *              'Plugin.MySanitizer.onUpLoadPreSave'\n *          )\n *      ),\n *      // global configure (optional)\n *      'plugin' => array(\n *          'MySanitizer' => array(\n *              'enable' => true,\n *          )\n *      ),\n *      // each volume configure (optional)\n *      'roots' => array(\n *          array(\n *              'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n *              'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n *              'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n *              'plugin' => array(\n *                  'MySanitizer' => array(\n *                      'enable' => true,\n*                   )\n *              )\n *          )\n *      )\n *  );\n */\nclass elFinderPluginMySanitizer extends elFinderPluginSanitizer\n{\n    protected function sanitizeFileName($filename, $opts, $allows = array()) {\n        $fileName = md5(microtime());\n        $fileExt  = pathinfo($name, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);\n        return $fileName.'.'.$fileExt;\n    }\n}\nThanks!.

OK, Please make new pull request on your https://github.com/wintstar/elFinder/tree/patch-1 .. @wintstar Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @badsaarow It seems that there is no problem with the latest 2.1.30 I tried. Please use the latest version and check if there is a similar problem.. OK, I also checked with IE 11.729.15063.0 - 11.0.48(KB4047206). But there is no problems. I can close dialog with Enter, [Close], or  [X], Is there a similar problem on our demo site? . I do not think that this problem is different due to the difference of the back end. However, there may be some error in the previous request. Is there a JavaScript error in developer tool?. The dialog closing behavior is executed in dialog.js. Please check whether the sequence arrives there.. It is a very strange behavior. However, when I checked the code, I found another point to fix and fixed it. Please reacquire the nightly build or master and try it. (Do not forget to clear the cache of the browser). @Chaffinch Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @badsaarow To handle file systems other than UTF-8 in elFinder, you need to specify the locale and encoding of the connector roots setting appropriately.\nThe locale setting in the Windows environment is \"<language>_<country>.<code_page>\". Also in the case of Korean encoding is \"CP949\"? I do not know well.. @bisherbas Please check connector roots option dispInlineRegex in the Wiki And client config commandsOptions.open.into.\nNotice: Please keep in mind that you should only allow trusted files for HTML inline display to avoid creating XSS vulnerabilities.\n. @badsaarow IE is in compatibility mode. Please add <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge,chrome=1\"> to maneger HTML.\nSo I'll fix example HTML files.. @badsaarow With the modern browser, full screen mode can not be switched without user intervention..

Therefore, it seems necessary to create your own plugin.. @badsaarow I checked on our demo site with IE 11.729.15063.0 (Windows10 64bit). It was no problems.

Since it supports UTF - 8 path, it may be good without setting encoding.. @badsaarow I do not know the cause. Do you have any information on the handling of Korean path on Windows server?. @badsaarow Please try next settings. and Please check result of elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem::_basename().\nphp\n    'locale' => 'korean_korea.65001', // or 'locale' => 'korean_korea.1252',\n    'roots' => array(\n        // Items volume\n        array(\n            'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',           // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n            'path'          => '/WebPark/GwanParking_Files/elFinder/',                 // path to files (REQUIRED)\n            'URL'           => '', // URL to files (REQUIRED)\n            'winHashFix'    => DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR !== '/', // to make hash same to Linux one on windows too\n            'uploadDeny'    => array('exe', 'asp', 'aspx', 'php', 'js'),                // All Mimetypes not allowed to upload\n            'uploadAllow'   => array('all'),// Mimetype `image` and `text/plain` allowed to upload\n            'uploadOrder'   => array('deny', 'allow'),      // allowed Mimetype `image` and `text/plain` only\n            // (comment out) 'locale'        => 'korean_korea.1252',  //'korean_korea.65001' is also result.\n            'accessControl' => 'access'                     // disable and hide dot starting files (OPTIONAL)\n        )\n    ). @badsaarow Since elFinder is being processed by UTF-8, it is necessary to specify the locale setting to UTF-8 (Windows code page 65001), but it seems that it can not be set to 65001. Thus, setting the standard code page 1252, it make reduce the problem of UTF-8 processing.. @badsaarow I tried setting \"C\" locale for Windows server.

Please enable debug in the connector setting and check the details of the error. However, I do not know the error caused by the open cart.. @terrysharp HTTP error 500 indicates that PHP stopped with an error. You need to know the details of the error. Have you tried 'connector' setting debug?. @terrysharp Have you looked at the Wiki page (Integration with CodeIgniter) and integrated it? The autoloader does not seem to work.. Since $connector is a variable name, there is no problem. Please make sure CodeIgniter config $config['composer_autoload'] = TRUE;\nBy the way, it has nothing to do with the problem this time, but I edited the wiki. See Diff.. @badsaarow Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Offerel Yes of course.\nPlease rewrite next URL to local location.\n- elfinder.html\n    - require.min.js\n- main.default.js\n    - require.config\n        - paths\n- client config option\n    - cdns\n    - an example on elfinder.html\n``javascript\nmanagers : {\n    // 'DOM Element ID': { /* elFinder options of this DOM Element */ }\n    'elfinder': {\n        cdns : {} // if you don't need extra editor and viewer.\n    }\n}. @Offerel Invalidating options.cdns requires setting each value to empty instead of{}`.

Please try nightly build.\nwith...\njavascript\nopts : {\n    url : 'php/connector.php',\n    cdns : {\n        // for editor etc.\n        ace        : null, // or your location\n        codemirror : null, // or your location\n        ckeditor   : 'Your CKEditor directory location (without last `/`)',\n        tinymce    : null, // or your location\n        simplemde  : null, // or your location\n        // for quicklook etc.\n        hls        : null, // or your location\n        dash       : null, // or your location\n        prettify   : null, // or your location\n        psd        : null, // or your location\n        rar        : null, // or your location\n        zlibUnzip  : null, // or your location\n        zlibGunzip : null  // or your location\n    }\n}. @apotheosis91 I found a client bug in elfinder.js. so I'll fix it.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @badsaarow Please check commandsOptions.help.selectActions of client configurations.\njavascript\ncommandsOptions : {\n    help : {\n        selectActions : ['open', 'download']\n    }\n}. @badsaarow It seems no problems, but It can not disable the 'preference' tab by design.. No, You can not invalidate the 'preference' tab, but others can be changed like this.\nhttp://jsbin.com/yisegem/edit?js,output. @jeremyzhou2001 Please check the Wiki's Connector roots option uploadMaxSize.. @a2exfr I'd like to merge this, but it is closed by you. Do you want to cancel this pull request?. Ok. We look forward to. By the way, is Ukrainian two-letter country code \"ua\" correct?. P.S I found the answer. The country code is \"ua\" and the language code is \"uk\", isn't.it?. @a2exfr Please try add 5th param.\nphp\nfunction RenameFiles($cmd, $result, $args, $elfinder, $volume){\nHowever, I think that using the 'upload.presave' hook point will give better results. In that way Normalizer plugin is helpful.. @a2exfr Although I have not verified it correctly, the upload command may be inconsistent as the partial request is also sent, such as during chunk uploading.. @fjibj That is due to cache as you guessed. Please specify the unique value of each host in the volume roots option rootRev.. @fjibj Is elFinder the latest version?. @Mandzuk Sorry, Please English toking.. @MickaelTH Are you using FlySystem's adapter? Depending on the configuration, the adapter may request content for MIME-Type determination. (I do not know well). @MickaelTH It seems that elfinder-flysystem-driver is doing. Please ask with elfinder-flysystem-driver repository.\n\nhttps://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver/blob/master/src/Driver.php#L303-L323 . @kruvas Can you use PHP constant __DIR__ in your case?. @kruvas elFinder converts the path based on the given path and \"cwd ()\" to an absolute path. A bug was found in the conversion process so I will fix this.\n\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Offerel First of all, check the contents of the server error and make sure that elFinder is causing the error.. @ForgotToPickAName Give the CSS class name so that it can be controlled by CSS.\nFor example\ncss\n.elfinder-confirm-upload .elfinder-confirm-btn-backup {\n    display: none;\n}\nOR\ncss\n.elfinder-confirm-upload .elfinder-confirm-btn-rename {\n    display: none;\n}\nCertainly [Cancel] and [X] buttons have duplicate functions, but that is a elFinder's specification. The [Cancel] and [No] buttons have functions that are slightly different so both are present.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @flack This feature is not release yet. It will on elFinder 2.1.31. Please try the nightly build until 2.1.31 release.. @gcompton I fixed. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @matpen With elFInder 2.1.17 or higher, the connector main option maxTargets is available. This is an option to suppress the load on the connector side, but it is also effective for this case.\nphp\n$opts = array(\n    'maxTargets' => 1,\n    'roots' => array( .... ),\n);\n. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @kagagnon This is a elFinder's bug. so I'll fix it.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @kagagnon This is a elFinder's bug. so I'll fix it.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @kagagnon Probably, it was fixed on 08f801abb95872600536a3d4d89fcde3ea82e749. Please check with nightly build.. @kagagnon Probably, it was fixed on 08f801abb95872600536a3d4d89fcde3ea82e749. Please check with nightly build.. @DiemenDesign Sure of course! Also edit the wiki at any time as it is editable. :-) :+1: . @vdanelia elFinnder 2.0 and below are not maintained. Also, please use the latest version because it is vulnerable to security.. Sorry, the old version can not be supported here and will not be fixed.. @llovvoll You can catch the download event by monitoring the exec event on the elFinder client.\ne.g.\njavascript\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder('instance');\nelf.bind('exec', function(e) {\n    var data = e.data || {},\n        files, jsonStr;\n    if ('download' === data.cmd && data.files) {\n        files = [];\n        $.each(data.files, function(i, hash) {\n            var f;\n            if (f = elf.file(hash)) {\n                files.push(f);\n            }\n        });\n        if (files.length) {\n            jsonStr = JSON.stringify(files);\n            elf.log(jsonStr); // show in browser console\n            // also you can send any endpoint with XHR...\n        }\n    }\n});. @badsaarow This is enbug of 7f8874b5247e567bc4c053d1b5bd7fe8b5e60853 so I'll fix it.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @sharifzadesina This problem was fixed with #2337. Thanks!. Please try the nightly build.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder#downloads. @sharifzadesina Just today, elFinder 2.1.31 was released. Please use it.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM I can not reproduce the second problem (about netmount dialog). Do you have detailed procedures that can be reproduced?. OK, Please create a new issue if the second bug is reproduced.. @ckvnahsik It is unknown what kind of things you want, but it is possible from the server side if you get a response along with Client - Server API 2.1.. @devcoinfet Regarding concerns you pointed out, I think that elFinder itself has no problem. The main points are as follows.\n\n\nThe base64encode option is disabled by default\n\nPassed data is session variable only\n\nHowever, satisfying the following requirements is vulnerable to object injection attacks.\n\nEnable base64encode option\nNot use the elFinderSession session handler and saves data passed from the user to the session variable directly\n\nIf you use elFinder, you must not meet all of these conditions.. @devcoinfet OK, I added the warning about object injection attacks into source code comment.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @vcordes79 The event name \"update\" can not be changed easily because there are cases where other users have added the quicklook preview plugin by themselves. Instead, I will modify it to change the event name if Element.update is extended.\nThanks!. @kkotowick In my testing environment, for example on the demo site, it is opened by connector.php every time. Can you explain in more detail?. @kkotowick This is a bug of the Dropbox2 volume driver, so I'll fix it.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @kkotowick Thank you for your advising. Of course yes, Please edit the Wiki page.. @Offerel There is a related issue.. @Afolabidivia Please check with a connector option debug ('debug' => true).. @haozhaodev The elFinder php connector sets the MIME type to \"unknown\" if the MIME type of the extension is unknown and the file size is zero. This is a problem when creating a text file so I will fix this.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Offerel I added trigger point of the dialog opened. You can try nightly build with next snipet.\njavascript\nvar fm = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nfm.bind('dialogopened', function(e) {\n    var dialog = e.data.dialog;\n    if (dialog.hasClass('elfinder-dialog-edit')) {\n        dialog.find('.elfinder-titlebar-button.elfinder-titlebar-full').trigger('mousedown');\n    }\n});\n  . Oh, sorry. In recent elfinder.html you can set it in the bootCallback option.\njavascript\n// bootCalback calls at before elFinder boot up \n,bootCallback : function(fm, extraObj) {\n    /* any bind functions etc. */\n    fm.bind('init', function() {\n        // any your code\n    });\n    // for example set document.title dynamically.\n    var title = document.title;\n    fm.bind('open', function() {\n        var path = '',\n            cwd  = fm.cwd();\n        if (cwd) {\n            path = fm.path(cwd.hash) || null;\n        }\n        document.title = path? path + ':' + title : title;\n    }).bind('destroy', function() {\n        document.title = title;\n    });\n    // maximize editor dialog\n    fm.bind('dialogopened', function(e) {\n        var dialog = e.data.dialog;\n        if (dialog.hasClass('elfinder-dialog-edit')) {\n            dialog.find('.elfinder-titlebar-button.elfinder-titlebar-full').trigger('mousedown');\n        }\n    });\n}. About PHP errors, this is my mistake. Currently it has already been fixed. Please re-acquire the nightly build.. @Offerel Please load the configuration that does not include the text area editor instead of \"js/extras/editors.default.js\", or remove the text area editor from the default editor.\njavascript\nopts : {\n    bootCallback : function(fm, extraObj) {\n        elFinder.prototype._options.commandsOptions.edit.editors.pop();\n    },\n    url : 'php/connector.php'\n}. > BTW: There is a small translation error for TextArea Editor or maybe the translation variable is not available. When you select a html file and look in the Main Toolbar, the word for TextArea is untranslated, where in the RightClick menu it is translated (in my case German).\nYes, you are right! I'll fix it.. @Qh0stM4N Please try 'uploadOrder'=> array( 'deny', 'allow').\nphp\n'uploadDeny' => array('all'),\n'uploadAllow' => array(\n    'video/mp4'\n),\n'uploadOrder'=> array('deny', 'allow'),. @Offerel elFinder is issued under a 3-clauses BSD license. Since there are no restrictions other than to satisfy that license provision, there is no problem with inclusion of elFinder unless it contravenes your product's license.\nI think that it is more better if the update is easy by the user acquiring elFinder and overwriting it.. @Qh0stM4N Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Qh0stM4N About mime-type of mp3 It is registered as \"audio/mpeg\" in the mime.types file. This \"audio/mpeg\" can be played in the browser.\nIf you want \"audio/mp3\" under your circumstance, you can control MIME - Type with additionalMimeMap of the connector route option. For example ...\nphp\n'additionalMimeMap' => array(\n    'mp3:audio/mpeg' => 'audio/mp3'\n). @awsmthx uploadAllow is a connector roots option it's not a client option.. @cuongnguyenvn Please change the elFinderVolumeTrash class and create a new class elFinderVolumeTrashMySQL extended the elFinderVolumeMySQL class and use it.\n\nelFinderVolumeTrashMySQL\n```php\n<?php\n/**\nelFinder driver for trash bin at local filesystem.\n *\n\n@author NaokiSawada\n /\nclass elFinderVolumeTrashMySQL extends elFinderVolumeMySQL\n{\n    /\n\nDriver id\nMust be started from letter and contains [a-z0-9]\nUsed as part of volume id.\n *\n@var string\n **/\nprotected $driverId = 'tm';\n\npublic function __construct()\n{\n    parent::__construct();\n    // original option of the Trash\n    $this->options['lockEverything'] = false; // Lock all items in the trash to disable delete, move, rename.\n// common options as the volume driver\n$this->options['alias'] = 'Trash';\n$this->options['quarantine'] = '';\n$this->options['rootCssClass'] = 'elfinder-navbar-root-trash';\n$this->options['copyOverwrite'] = false;\n$this->options['uiCmdMap'] = array('paste' => 'hidden', 'mkdir' => 'hidden', 'copy' => 'restore');\n$this->options['disabled'] = array('archive', 'duplicate', 'edit', 'extract', 'mkfile', 'places', 'put', 'rename', 'resize', 'upload');\n\n}\npublic function mount(array $opts)\n{\n    if ($this->options['lockEverything']) {\n        if (!is_array($opts['attributes'])) {\n            $opts['attributes'] = array();\n        }\n        $attr = array(\n            'pattern' => '/./',\n            'locked' => true,\n        );\n        array_unshift($opts['attributes'], $attr);\n    }\n    // force set copyJoin to true\n    $opts['copyJoin'] = true;\nreturn parent::mount($opts);\n\n}\n}\n```. I added elFinderVolumeTrashMySQL.class.php to repository.. I tested next settings, that is no problems.\n\n\nphp\narray(\n    'driver' => 'MySQL',\n    'trashHash' => 'tm1_MQ',\n    'path' => 1,\n    'host' => '192.168.1.xxx',\n    'user' => 'xxxx',\n    'pass' => 'xxxx',\n    'db' => 'elfinder',\n    'files_table' => 'elfinder_file',\n    'tmpPath'       => 'PATH TO/.tmp',\n    'uploadMaxSize' => '10M',\n),\narray(\n    'id' => '1',\n    'driver' => 'TrashMySQL',\n    'path' => 1,\n    'host' => '192.168.1.xxx',\n    'user' => 'xxxx',\n    'pass' => 'xxxx',\n    'db' => 'elfinder',\n    'files_table' => 'elfinder_trash',\n    'tmpPath'       => 'PATH TO/.tmp',\n    'uploadMaxSize' => '10M',\n),. The values of path need not be the same. However, with the MySQL volume driver, there was a problem that it was not possible to set the folder with the parent as the root, so I modified it with commit (ef6e182cc98b57b763804ae7b1528e64ba978fba).. @sunblur I think that there is probably a cause in the server configuration, but just in case please check it with elFinder latest version. Also ask VestaCP about the cause of the server side.. @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @mkhomytsya Please check \"Requirements - Server\"\n\nPHP 5.2+ (Recommend PHP 5.4 or higher) And for thumbnails - GD / Imagick module / convert(imagemagick) require. Oh, sorry. I missed read clearly this title. Are you trying in elFinder 2.1.31? What about nightly build?. Is the value of \"URL\" in connector roots config correct? \"http://127.0.0.1:4570/tmp/elFinder-2.1/files/a/icoTest_passed_selected.png\" is the URL of the original file, can the server PHP access the location?. Please try set a connector main option commonTempPath to readable/writable directory for PHP.\n\nphp\n$opts = array(\n    // 'debug' => true,\n    'commonTempPath' => 'Readable/Writable directory',\n    'roots' => array(\n        // Items volume\n        array(\n            'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',           // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n            'path'          => '../files/',                 // path to files (REQUIRED)\n            'URL'           => dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) .

Please try the latest nightly build. (Do not forget to update the cache of the browser). @ntrimg By default, pdf can not be uploaded, but there is no display / download restriction. So I think that this behavior is restricted in your server environment.. @kkotowick $len is the size of blob data sliced with JavaScript and $csize is the size of uploaded blob data. Normally $csize will not be bigger. There is a possibility that data has been changed somewhere. Please explore it.. @kkotowick For such this case please use \"upload.presave\" hook point.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#bind. @todhing The folders are merged. Only files are overwritten. To replace the folder, select \"Backup\". In relation I fixed the dialog message.\n\n\n. @todhing Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM I'm trying implement this feature now.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n\n. @hayes-seyah09354085977 Would you show your connector configuration?. There seems to be no problem in setting. I made error messages displayed in debug tab of information dialog by enabling debug mode. Please observe if any errors are displayed on the latest version of the nightly build.\nphp\n$opts = array(\n            'debug' => true, // to enable debug mode\n            'bind' => array(\n                'upload.presave' => array(\n                    'Plugin.Watermark.onUpLoadPreSave'\n                )\n            ),\n.....\n\n\n. @china-live That is not image proportion of Width/Height. It is a ratio of display image size / real image size. \nThanks!. @china-live Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @BuffaloBrennan With the bind option, it is possible to change the contents of the file at the time of uploading, but I think that it is not possible to change the file and output it at the time of downloading. However, there is a way to extend the file() function of the elFinder class and change the contents of the file when downloading.. @RRangioni Please try to omit (disable) URL option in connector.php file. Please check the Wiki.. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @todhing I tried several patterns with Windows 10/64 bit Chrome 64 and Firefox 58, but I could not reproduce this problem.\nCan you show the procedure to reproduce this problem?. @todhing The cause of this problem is that the directory selector does not include directories that do not contain files in the file data obtained by the directory selector.\nSince elFinder does not support such data, there is a bug that nothing happens. I will fix this, but the directory which does not contain the file will be skipped and uploaded.. @todhing I fixed this issue. Please try nightly build. so please don't forget browser cache clearing.. Chrome has a related bug. - Webkitdirectory input returns wrong path of selected files.

It is the same as ordinary HTML <A>.. @flack Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @rwilkin Please try\njavascript\nbaseUrl : 'js'\nto\njavascript\nbaseUrl : 'elfinder/js'\nin your main.js.. @parvanova If your directory pattern is as follows...\n./index.html\n./main.ckedialog.js\n./elfinder/js/elfinder.min.js\n./elfinder/php/connector.minimal.php\nYou need to modify main.ckedialog.js.\nelfUrl = './php/connector.minimal.php' to elfUrl = './elfinder/php/connector.minimal.php'\nAnd\nbaseUrl : 'js' to baseUrl : 'elfinder/js'\nThat's all.\n. > Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined at elfinder.js:5186\nPlease load elfinder.min.js or elfinder.full.js instead of elfinder.js.. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @dmarcos89 I think that the place you should ask is \"https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-elfinder/issues\".\nThanks.. @dkaar elFinder treats the file name as UTF-8. To decompress the archive compressed with elFinder use an archiver that can handle UTF-8.\nTo decompress archives containing files other than UTF - 8 on elFinder, use a library that converts the encoding to UNICODE.\nFor example in the Japanese environment \"https://github.com/polygonplanet/encoding.js\" is used.\njavascript\nfm.registRawStringDecoder(function(s) {\n    return Encoding.convert(s, {to:'UNICODE',type:'string'});\n});. @zamebit Please check the Wiki. There is a connector roots option  uploadAllow.. @MonkeyMaster Thanks!. @MonkeyMaster Thanks! I'll fix it. \ud83d\udc4d . @bwaindwain Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @gordon-matt It seems JSON data is wrong. \"volumeId\" should be \"volumeid\".. However, since \"volumeid\" is easy to mistake to \"volumeId\", I would like to be fixes by the client side.. > So you will change it in a future version to, \"volumeId\" instead?\nNo, \"volumeid\" is correct, it will not be changed in the future.\nAnd, there is the Wiki page \"Client-Server API 2.1\".\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.1#open\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.1#information-about-filedirectory. OK, again it will only allow \"volumeid\". However, since backward compatibility to API 2.0 is broken, I will fix it.. @badrizahra You can set user ID in connector.minimal.php isn't it?. Fixed in 79c4983c89cf616a7d319d31e120d72660d06961 .. @CodeLyokoXtEAM This issue will be fixed next commit. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . Closed by d927a82c4c2f6fbe461aa53a170f3358f1fc1d1b .. @Yves-K You can access the connector URL directly.\nex.\n- https://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/2.1/php/connector.minimal.php?cmd=open&target=l1_Lw\nsee - Client Server API 2.1. In that case please inherit the elFinderConnector class or create a new connector class and use it.. @michalm2018 Please try the cliant configlaton requestMaxConn. It is a setting concerning simultaneous request limitation.\nex.\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    url  : 'php/connector.php',\n    requestMaxConn : 1\n}\n$('#elfinder').elfinder(options);. @yangjinpanda Which PHP version are you using?. OK, In PHP 7.1 and above, the multibyte path problem has been fixed. You will get good results if you can update to PHP 7.1 or later.\nAlso, with PHP 7.1 and higher you do not need to set encoding and locale.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @hayes-seyah09354085977 What's the problem you have?. @hayes-seyah09354085977 OK, I see.

From the manager's perspective, the rename will be deleted and added. Then the rename event fires when the rename command completes.. @hayes-seyah09354085977 Since an XHR request to the back end does not occur when the file is opened, please use \"exec\" with 2.1.35 or later.\njavascript\nexec : function(e, fm) {\n    var data = e.data;\n    if (data.cmd === 'open') {\n        fm.log(data);\n    }\n}. @haukefrahmann You can use whatever solution it can open arbitrary URLs into the iframe.. @BjornMelgaard I added to the Wiki - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/HOWTOs-by-external-sites .

That part is ...\nphp\nif (ini_get('mbstring.internal_encoding')) {\n    ini_set('mbstring.internal_encoding', '');\n}\nThat is, it will only be executed if mbstring.internal_encoding is set in php.ini or on before elFinder instance creation.\nPlease check the value of mbstring.internal_encoding in your environment.. @enlivenapp If values are set in iconv.internal_encoding or mbstring.internal_encoding in the environment of PHP 5.6 or higher, those settings are invalidated by setting an empty value. If those errors are reported, It shows those values are set in php.ini etc.\n\nhttp://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#scripterror\n\nWhat is the error in the JavaScript console? Is it also the same if you clear the browser's cache?. @enlivenapp The value of iconv.internal_encoding or mbstring.internal_encoding are empty value as default. Please check all ini files php reads.\nHowever, if its value is UTF-8, it does not interfere with the operation of elFinder, so I'll add checking if it is UTF-8 in elfinder.class.php.\nphp\nif (($_val = ini_get('iconv.internal_encoding')) && strtoupper($_val) !== 'UTF-8') {\n    ini_set('iconv.internal_encoding', '');\n}\nif (($_val = ini_get('mbstring.internal_encoding')) && strtoupper($_val) !== 'UTF-8') {\n    ini_set('mbstring.internal_encoding', '');\n}\nif (($_val = ini_get('internal_encoding')) && strtoupper($_val) !== 'UTF-8') {\n    ini_set('internal_encoding', '');\n}\n\nFailed to load resource: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/elfinder/2.1.35/js/elfinder.min.js\n\nThere seems to be a problem on cdnjs.. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @gadangmadhulika What is PHP version and elFinder version?

Please check with the latest version. Please let me know the error that PHP will issue with the latest elFinder.. The version of PHP supported by elFinder is PHP 5.2 or higher. I am checking the operation with PHP 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.2.\nScreenshots seem to be integrated with something, but please check the operation with plain elFinder. Then let me know the error message that PHP reports.. @Colinax Does the error occur if you do not integrate elFinder anything?. @venukommu Your screenshot is integrated with something else application. Please verify with elFinder which does not integrate in order to determine whether the problem is elFinder or its application.. @Briareos17 Did you check #1968?. Fixed with e567b31a6e2ee3dd961959eafd5854cfbe28a4ae. @standus There are some options in connector side and client side.\nConnector side\n- uploadMaxConn\nClient side\n- loadTmbs\n- requestMaxConn\n. @Yves-K Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Colinax Version 2.2 has not been coded yet. And detailed specifications are not yet decided.. They are listed in the sense that they will not implement in 2.1.x so maybe. It is undecided.. @nmpetkov Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @xizan Is #2384 related? If it is the cause it has been fixed since 2.1.33.. @xizan I'm checking with PHP 5.5/MySQL 5.1. There are no problems. Please check your API protocol version is 2.1035.\n\n. @actorius Since API 2.0 also includes directory information in target, the src parameter is not necessary. However, the description of the wiki page seems to be wrong. In order to maintain compatibility, I also add src parameters for 2.0 connectors.\nThanks!. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @nmpetkov It's so nice idea! Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @xizan Please make LOAD_FILE available in MySQL configuration or adjust the value of max_allowed_packet.. @NinaSts Are you having any problems?. @NinaSts OK, It can't delete the issue on GitHub, so I'll close this.. @gadangmadhulika Since it can not be hidden under present conditions, I plan to add an option to make it possible.\nThanks!. @SantoshTirukkovilour That's correct. However, the setting saved in the browser takes precedence. Please check with reset your preferences.. @gadangmadhulika There is the \"Reset\" button in reset tab in preferences dialog on elFinder.. @llovvoll Is it due to the web server or php-fpm timeout? . @llovvoll In my test environment (Apache 2.2 + mod_xsendfile + PHP module), such problems can not be reproduced. You'd better consider using 'X-Sendfile' or 'X-Accel-Redirect'.. @llovvoll In my test environment (Apache 2.2 + mod_xsendfile + PHP module), such problems can not be reproduced. You'd better consider using 'X-Sendfile' or 'X-Accel-Redirect'.. There is no problem in the environment of Apache 2.2 + PHP module without mod_xsendfile. I tested the file download of about 8 GB and completed normally in about 30 minutes.. There is no problem in the environment of Apache 2.2 + PHP module without mod_xsendfile. I tested the file download of about 8 GB and completed normally in about 30 minutes.. @llovvoll I got that fpassthru() has a bug in the output of large size files if PHP version is less than 5.6. So I'll fix it by elFinder side.. @llovvoll Please try the Nightly build.. @xizan _save() is that. Probably you will be check _copy() too to support user_id.. @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ioweb-gr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @mshayashi This is a bug.

OK,  Since 20 items are not enough, it probably means that one request has not been successfully processed. Is there no error message?. If you increase the value of max_file_uploads in php.ini (eg 30) what happens?. @Kreyco Since the hash value of the URL takes precedence, please access without hashing the URL.. @Kreyco You say startHashPath, it is correctly startPathHash.\n\nopts={\n startHashPath: 'l1_RG9jdW1lbnRvc0V4dGVybm9z'\n}\n\nto\nopts={\n  startPathHash: 'l1_RG9jdW1lbnRvc0V4dGVybm9z'\n}. @Yves-K Did not you satisfy your requirements with the upload event listener?. @sauerlu This is a problem of file location configuration on your server, so it is not a problem of elFinder. Please configure so that elfinder/php/autoload.php is loaded correctly.. @santoshray02 As far as I know there is no driver for network mount of Amazon S3, so you need to create your own. You need to create a driver class or create a network mount driver that uses FlySystem.\nThere are similar drivers for Box, Dropbox, GoogleDrive (with FlySystem), OneDrive. Will the source code help you?\n. @santoshray02 Please notify here when you got it.. @mauleous There is no problem in the way you indicated about blink.

Using the connector option debug you can get server side error messages. See the wiki. In addition, elFinder supports PHP 5.2 to 7.2.\nWhat is \"product image\"? I do not understand the meaning.. @wegeeus I do not know about opencart. Please let me know if there is a problem when using elFinder standalone.. I do not know any extensions for opencart. I can not answer because I do not know how the extension is configured. You should ask the developer of the extension for opencart instead of here.. @hayes-seyah09354085977 It is related to #1037. I will add a client option that can send a search type identifier to the connector.. @hayes-seyah09354085977 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \nTo actually add custom searches, you need to extend the volume driver. For details, please see the wiki.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Custom-search-function. @gadangmadhulika Please configure your volume driver to include thumbnail URL in \"tmb\" item of file information. The s3 driver can not be solved here (elFinder project).. @yinmingming Because of elFinder's specification, we collect item information in directory at once. Therefore, in order to raise the response performance, it is necessary to reduce the number of items in the directory, one of which is a multi-level directory structure.. @russh3l Please obtain the error contents with the browser developer tool and specify the cause.. @hayes-seyah09354085977 You can use an option callback.\n\nphp\n'plugin' => array(\n    'Sanitizer' => array(\n        'enable' => true,\n        'callBack' => function($name, $options) {\n            $ext = '';\n            $pos = strrpos($name, '.');\n            if ($pos !== false) {\n                $ext = substr($name, $pos);\n                $name = substr($name, 0, $pos);\n            }\n            return str_replace('.', 'new', $name) . $ext;\n        }\n    )\n). @hayes-seyah09354085977 Yes, It correct. I tested with elFinder 2.1.38. Rename \"A.txt\" to \"A.B.C.txt\", it became \"AnewBnewC.txt\".. @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ShinJii89 Bind your function to the rename command with connector.php.\nSee\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#bind\n- https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Logging . @pjetrucha Adjustment of CSS is necessary for Firefox. I will make that amendment.\nSince UA.Touch is a flag as to whether it is a touch device or not, I think that there is no problem with current judgment.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @vahidalvandi It require tmbPath and tmbUrl options. Or It seems it can with to use Glide on the Flysystem driver.. @DiemenDesign There isn't JavaScript option fot that. but, however there is a PHP plugin \"AutoResize\".. @DiemenDesign Please try an option debug to get server error messages.\nphp\n$opts=array(\n  'debug' => true,\n  'bind' => array(\n    'upload.presave' => array(\n      'Plugin.AutoResize.onUpLoadPreSave'\n    )\n  ),\n....

Or change the folder of open elFinder? ... etc)\nOr please show me the script of your web page.. What is the need to change the root directory dynamically? It seems enough to implementing the custom search function.. Please return true if you search your database using $path and $query and match. This method is called for all target items.. I do not know the details because the structure of your database is unknown. What I can say is that the function searchMatchContents($name, $query, $path) needs to return true if the item of $path matches $query.. Probably,\nphp\nprotected function searchMatchContents($name, $query, $path) {\n    static $results = null;\n    if ($results === null) {\n        $results = array();\n    }\n    if (!isset($results[$query])) {\n        $sth=$dbDB->prepare(\"select * from [OCRTest] where Content LIKE '%\".$query.\"%'\");\n        $sth->execute();\n        $results[$query] = array_flip($sth->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_COLUMN, 0));\n    }\n    return isset($results[$query][$this->_relpath($path)]);\n}\nHowever, the value of Location should be relative path from the root path. (Remove \"/php/../files/\"). Since $dbDB is undefined it is natural to get an error. Even if copy paste is done as it is, it does not work. You need to understand the contents and respond by yourself.. @prashantrijal96 Please check the Wiki - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1 .. @prashantrijal96 Please correctly set the values of 'path', 'host', 'user,' pass', 'port', 'mode' for your FTP server.

It can be avoided by loadding \"js/extras/editors.default.js\".\ncf. #2257.. @zwakrim 'attributes' has no effect because 'pattern' parameter is not specified in 'attributes'.

Is that OK?\nThanks!. @isreehari Thanks!\n\nI tried to do some Donation to elFinder (nao-pon) through paypal but it does not go through please check it once.\n\nI updated \"Donate\" section of https://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/ .

Please check with the nightly build.. @isreehari  Thumbnails are created according to the instructions of the client as necessary. That is the specification of elFinder. If you need to create thumbnails at the same time as uploading, you need to respond like the code you presented.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM This is an error of configuration of demo site. so I was fixed it.

Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Chaffinch Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @standus I corrected my mistake. Thanks!. @unigia There is same problem in the nightly build? I checked it with nightly, but there aren't any problems.\nUPDATE:\nThe problem has been reproduced in the Firefox browser. I will investigate.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @oleg-moseyko Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @sclolo Please check the setting related to file upload of Symfony 4 and PHP. If there is no problem with Symfony 3, there is something wrong with those settings.. @unigia Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @unigia , @arubalucalasagni Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @gadangmadhulika The elFinder PHP connector examines the file type when uploading files, and processes images with AutoResize, WaterMark plug-in, etc. The cause of the crash may be insufficient memory. Please take measures such as increasing the allocation memory of PHP. Regarding the time required for execution, please PR if there is room for improvement in the program.. @gadangmadhulika I tested it, uploading 30 images of 4592 x 3056 pixels (total size 139 MB) took about 1 minute. It will vary depending on server specifications and network environment, but I think that it is rare to crash on the way. What exactly is your problem?. @gadangmadhulika I was misunderstanding that there was a problem with uploading action. I saw a movie. It seems that the UI is blocked by something and FPS seems to be going down, but I could not reproduce it in my environment.\nIs it a similar result even if I tried it with a nightly build? Please change it to another browser or clear the browser's cache before checking.\nAlso, please open the browser's developer tool and observe what blocks UI.. @gadangmadhulika Is it same on the nightly build too?. @gadangmadhulika Does Chrome's browser extension have any impact?. @gadangmadhulika I created a sample folder on the demo site. There is no problem in my environment ( Chrome: 67.0.3396.87 (Official Build) (64 bit/Windows 10)).\n\nhttps://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/#elf_l1_SW1hZ2VzL0hpZ2hSZXNvSW1ncw. @gadangmadhulika If you have same problem in our demo site, I guess your PC has any problems. Please try to check with other any PC.. @tristanleboss I done.\n\nExample: Make the edit dialog the same size as the elFinder node\nTo define with handlers.dialogopen: [Fn] of the client setting or elFinderInstance.bind('dialogopen', [Fn]).\njavascript\nhandlers : {\n    dialogopen : function(e, fm) {\n        var dialog = e.data.dialog,\n            elfNode;\n        if (dialog.hasClass('elfinder-dialog-edit')) {\n            elfNode = fm.getUI();\n            dialog.css({\n                top: 0,\n                left: 0,\n                width: elfNode.width(),\n                height: elfNode.height()\n            }).trigger('resize', { init : true });\n        }\n    }\n}\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @eatsweetly Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @siyakant Please check the error contents by setting debug of PHP connector option to true.. @ntrimg Because suppressing by UI option is apparent, please use the connector side option to invalidate the function itself.\nIf it is an official PHP connector ...\nphp\n'disabled' => array('rm', 'rename'),. @ntrimg These are connector side options. Please set it at the connector side.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#disabled. @alexgiovi Currently, elFinder detect up to 4 characters as the file extension, So I'll change it to 10 characters.\n\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @unigia Thank you so much! \ud83d\udc4d . @alexgiovi This is a bug of currently nightly. I'll fix it.\nThank you! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thank you for the detailed reproduction method!. @wanminxg I checked with $_REQUEST. That was no problem.. @hardiktailored Is that about \"Empty the folder\"? If right, please add 'empty' to roots option disabled.. Sorry, I misread the question. I will check the source code.. @hardiktailored I fixed to make possible to commands.empty become superclass. Please try with the nightly build.\nCreate a subclass command.deleteAll of command.empty that only changes the title, add 'empty' => 'deleteAll' to the uiCmdMap option of the Trash volume so that the command title can be changed.\n```javascript\n/ It from default elfinder.html /\nbootCallback : function(fm, extraObj) {\n    / add commands.deleteAll function /\n    // Class commands.deleteAll extends commands.empty\n    (fm.commands.deleteAll = function() {\n        \"use strict\";\n        this.init = function() {\n            // call parent.init()\n            (Object.getPrototypeOf? Object.getPrototypeOf(this) : this.proto).init.call(this);\n            // set my title\n            this.title = this.fm.i18n('Delete All');\n        };\n    }).prototype = { extendsCmd : 'empty', forceLoad : true };\n    / Up to this point is appended /\n/* any bind functions etc. */\nfm.bind('init', function() {\n    // any your code\n});\n// for example set document.title dynamically.\nvar title = document.title;\nfm.bind('open', function() {\n    var path = '',\n        cwd  = fm.cwd();\n    if (cwd) {\n        path = fm.path(cwd.hash) || null;\n    }\n    document.title = path? path + ':' + title : title;\n}).bind('destroy', function() {\n    document.title = title;\n});\n\n}\n```\nIn tha connector root option\nphp\n/** It from default connector.minimal.php **/\n// Trash volume\narray(\n    'id'            => '1',\n    'driver'        => 'Trash',\n    'path'          => '../files/.trash/',\n    'tmbURL'        => dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) .\n'/../files/.trash/.tmb/',\n    'winHashFix'    => DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR !== '/', // to make hash same\nto Linux one on windows too\n    'uploadDeny'    => array('all'),                // Recomend the same\nsettings as the original volume that uses the trash\n    'uploadAllow'   => array('image', 'text/plain'),// Same as above\n    'uploadOrder'   => array('deny', 'allow'),      // Same as above\n    'accessControl' => 'access',                    // Same as above\n    // add `'empty' => 'deleteAll'` to default option\n    'uiCmdMap'      => array('paste' => 'hidden', 'mkdir' => 'hidden', 'copy' => 'restore', 'empty' => 'deleteAll'),\n)\n. @Nick3523 May be... ( Not tested )\n```php\n$allowed = array(\"ihm\",\"mpd\",\"accords_conf\",\"bdp\",\".tmb\");\n$regex = '\\/(?:' . join('|', array_map('preg_quote', $allowed)) . ')\\/';\n$basename = basename($path);\nif (in_array($basename, $allowed) || preg_match($regex, $path)) {\n```\n( I do not considering performance. ). @Nick3523 For reference, If we consider Windows, it might be as follows.\nphp\n$regex = '\\' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . '(?:' . join('|', array_map('preg_quote', $allowed)) . ')\\ ' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;\nBy the way, it was good that you could solve in another way. Since the access() function is called quite a lot, you can get good results by making the cache work with the filtrage() function.. @jacceko The Zoho editor plugin receives uploads from the Zoho server, assigns the data to variables, and processes them. It is probably due to differences in upload limit or memory limit, not due to server version differences.\nPlease check those settings on your server.. @jacceko It seems that there is a problem with detection of MIME-Type. In PHP 7, when you hover over the file type of the file information dialog of the bin icon, the MIME-Type is displayed on the tooltip. What is that MIME-Type?\n\n. @jacceko When the MIME type is \"application/octet-stream\", it is logic to detect from the file extension, but there seems to be a bug in it. I will fix it.. @jacceko I think that this problem was fixed.\nNote: elFinder detects MIME-Type by file contents as much as possible for security reasons. If you want to detect MIME-Type with only the file extension, set \"mimeDetect\" of the connector roots option to \"internal\".\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @nmpetkov elFinder can incorporate any editor as a plug-in. Pixlr editor, Criative Cloud editor, etc. are already installed. However, since they work with external services, they can not be used to edit confidential data, I know. If it is an editor working with JavaScript, so that is not send data to externally. Please let us know if you have any editors you recommend.\nThanks!. I found tui.image-editor. it looks like a good editor, so i was started implementing it.. @nmpetkov Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @masihfathi Please load \"js/extras/editors.default.min.js\". It is designed to load by default.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/main.default.js#L92\nor\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/elfinder.legacy.html#L31. @nmpetkov Multiple edits are fine. Is the cache of the browser affected?. @jacceko Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @jacceko Are you trying the Nightly Build? How about on our demo site?. @jacceko Current elFinder does not support changing file types when editing files. It is necessary to take care not to make it a security hole. I will start to think about its specifications and implementation.. @CodeLyokoXtEAM I'd like to change the file type conversion to the Online-Convert of the edit plugin.\n\nFor the integration of external services, i will add the Integrations tab in the help dialog and enumerate it there.\nThanks!. @CodeLyokoXtEAM No, There aren't disabled. But there aren't list up on some devices that hasn't the Flash plugin.. This request is likely to be solved by extending the \"SaveAs\" function, so I started this.. @jacceko , @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @jacceko Thanks! :+1: . The online-convert.com has many options, and it takes a lot of time to use the API. It is easy to create a command that opens a new tab with content URL, how about it?. I have created a test cases that does not use the API.\nOne is an implementation as an editing plugin and the other is an implementation of an independent command.\nEdit plugin opens to iframe, command opens online-convert.com on tab.\nYou can try them on my developer site.. Sorry, please scroll down to find elFinder manager.. The problem of the space character of file name is a bug of online-convert.com. I reported this issue to support.\nRegarding API usage, I will consider how to implement polling.. Currently I'm developping in \"https://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder/tree/onlineconvert\".. @jacceko , @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM I fixed it. Thank you! \ud83d\udc4d . @hayes-seyah09354085977 The open event is an event that fires after receiving data from the backend when the folder is opened.

But this integration of online-convert.com on elFInder, that used edit command. The edit command is not support mulitiple item handling in on window. So maybe it impossible in currently.\nThanks!. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @CodeLyokoXtEAM The idea of hiding any item at the user level is interesting. However, it is unknown how much it is worth in elFinder. Can you explain the value?. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Okey, I made a new issue #2595.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @hayes-seyah09354085977 Did you solved it with https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Simple-file-permissions-control?. @bwaindwain Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @technologiesorion elFinder is a multi-root supported file manager, it is not thought to hide the root. If you hide it with CSS you can hide it with the following style.\ncss\nspan.elfinder-navbar-root {\n    display: none;\n}. @fortcms There is no problem in this example ( https://jsbin.com/magodiw/edit?html,output ).. @fortcms It is displayed in the latest version with the default options.. In the latest version, that item is in the user preferences. Also, there is no problem with the ACE editor in the latest version.\n\n. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @fortcms That is a question about TinyMCE. Please ask TinyMCE developers.\nThanks!. @ShinJii89 \n\nLike the file system, elFinder also treats renames as item movements.\nCan't  it currently. see #1357, #1667.\nYou can use a deregate point upload.presave like this.\nphp\n'bind' => [\n    'upload.presave' => [\n        function($thash, $name, $src, $elfinder, $volume) {\n            $isFull = true; // or false\n            if ($isFull) {\n                unlink($src); // It will be triggered an warning error.\n                // customized error message\n                $GLOBALS['my_elfinder_upload_error'] = 'You can\\'t upload those files because it exceed the disk space';\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    'upload' => [\n        function($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n            if (!empty($GLOBALS['my_elfinder_upload_error'])) {\n                $result['warning'][] = $GLOBALS['my_elfinder_upload_error'];\n                unset($GLOBALS['my_elfinder_upload_error']);\n            }\n            // Show toast message (elFinder >= 2.1.41 or nightly build)\n            if ($result && $result['added']) {\n                if (!isset($result['toasts']) || !is_array($result['toasts'])) {\n                    $result['toasts'] = array();\n                }\n                $result['toasts'][] = ['msg' => 'Files uploaded fine'];\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n]\nsee (3.).\nYes. but it need customize of quickllook plugin. see - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/js/commands/quicklook.plugins.js\nSee uiOptions.toolbarExtra.displayTextLabel.\nIt probably will not matter Sanitizer Plugin. I think that some other setting is affecting. But i don't know.. @ShinJii89 $src is a path to uploaded temporary file. So you can check file size with filesize($src). And there are problems on elFinder <= 2.1.40 to this issue. Please try with the nightly build.. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ShinJii89 Would you explain with some screenshots?. Long filenames are omitted because it is displayed in limited space. You can adjust CSS and show it all, but that will be bad results. Is not it a mouse over tool tip?\n\n\nOr, if you maximize the size of the icon, the number of characters displayed will increase.\n\n. @dhirusarania Please try setting the appropriate value for post_max_size.\nsee - http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size\n\n5.3.4 | post_max_size\u00a0= 0 will not disable the limit when the content type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded or is not registered with PHP.\n\n. @dhirusarania Please read the manual of PHP. http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size . 1000 is 1000 bytes. That's too small.. I can not reproduce similar problems with folder uploading issues. Are you specifying options other than the default settings?. Umm...\nPlease try\npost_max_size 24M\nupload_max_filesize 20M\nmax_file_uploads 50. @nihal1234ouali Office Online is a viewer and can not be edited.

If you are integrating with something else, please find what is blocking the shutdown function.\nHowever, these files may be deleted by garbage collection after 12 hours.. @Poldan Yes, The cause of this problem is that commonTempPath is a relative path.

Can you respond to other environments?. What I mean is that we can not write code for under a specific environment. At least the environment judgment block is necessary.\nI have thought about this problem. Regarding file size acquisition, various responses are required depending on the server environment. Therefore, I am planning to be able to define a callback function to acquire file size by option.. I done in f05b84b0a6166fce2a55a2722b23ee6a8566088c .. @yuchting The best solution to this problem is to use PHP compiled with 64 bit. However, even with the current code, file size of 4 GB or less can be acquired correctly in many environments. I added this option for environments that can not handle files larger than 4GB or 2GB correctly. For example, to realize the same thing as this PR, specify the option as follows.\n```php\n$opts = array(\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'statCorrector' => function (&$stat, $path, $statOwner, $volumeDriveInstance) {\n                if (isset($stat['size']) && $stat['mime'] !== 'directory') {\n                    if ($stat['size'] == '0') {\n                        // filesize problem for file larger than 4GB ( testing in PHP Version 5.4.16)\n                        // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6482211/php-filesize-over-4gb\n                        $stat['size'] = trim(shell_exec('stat -c %s '.escapeshellarg($path)));\n                    }\n                if ($stat['ts'] === false){\n                    // sometime filemtime will failed to return false\n                    $stat['ts'] = (int)trim(shell_exec('stat -c %Y '.escapeshellarg($path)));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    )\n)\n\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n. @yakupdemirci Please add a setting of volume roots configuration.php\n'uiCmdMap' => array('rm' => 'hidden', 'paste' => 'hidden', 'mkdir' => 'hidden', 'copy' => 'restore')\n``\n(Add'rm' => 'hidden'` to default of elFinderVolumeTrash). @CodeLyokoXtEAM I checked with 2.1.40 and 2.1.40 (2.1-src Nightly: e929d13). There are no problems. Please check with clear your browser cache.\n\n. @CodeLyokoXtEAM Have you any JavaScript errors in the browser console?. @CodeLyokoXtEAM OK, You're right! I'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d. @fortcms Do you want an action specification (ex. Onerror: 'destroy') when an error occurs in the getFileCallback function?. @fortcms OK, This is a bug of elfinder.js. I'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @xizan There is a similar issue. see #2599. Thanks.. @russh3l PHP syntax error has occurred because you added config.. @flohw Oh! Thank you so much! \ud83d\udc4d . @Nick3523 Is your goal to make the directory creation an authentication function?. @Nick3523 Use the bind option to execute your own PHP script immediately after creating the directory.\nphp\n'bind' => [\n    'mkdir' => [\n        function($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n            if ($result && !empty($result['added'])) {\n                $newDir = $result['added'][0];\n                $newDirPath = $volume->path($newDir['hash']);\n                // and more your script...\n                // Changing $result also changes the data returned to the client.\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n]. I may not understand correctly because I am not good at English.\nIf the user needs an input value each time the user creates a directory, it is necessary to create a new mkdir command (mkdir 2, etc.).\nOr, if there is enough user authentication information, it will solve by combining some login mechanism.\nIf you have a diagram of user input and data processing at the server I think that I can give better advice.. @vkirpa82 That is a good idea. I will start on this.. @vkirpa82 Please try plugin options...\nphp\n'ratio'    => 1,    // Ratio to original image (ratio > 0 and ratio <= 1)\n'position' => 'CM', // Position L(eft)/C(enter)/R(ight) and T(op)/M(edium)/B(ottom)\n'marginX'  => 0,    // Margin horizontal pixel\n'marginY'  => 0,    // Margin vertical pixel\nwith nightly build.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Shadi-Ayoub Since the rename of the volume root is not changed on the connector side but is changed only on the client's browser, it is not affected by the connector setting.. @Shadi-Ayoub Preference settings are saved in client's browser local storage.. @ghigio2000 The cause of this problem is that detecting MIME-Type by finfo causes all XML files to become \"application/xml\". I will fix this.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ghigio2000 Please try nightly build to check this issue.. @ghigio2000 Can you use elfinder.full.js of version 2.1.41 to report the line number where the error occurred?. Perhaps the event handlers you added to the elFinder client are affecting. What kind of event handlers do you add?. @ghigio2000 OK, Please let me know if there is a part to adjust on elFinder side.. I close this, but you can reopen it if necessary.. @rmcdahal I made online demo(JSBin). Is that what you want?. @rmcdahal Use \"file.url\" only or remove unnecessary part.. @chiragparekh A simple example. Will it be helpful?\n```javascript\nelf = $('#elfinder').elfinder('instance');\n$('').html('Select').on('click', function() {\n    var files = $.map(elf.selected(), function(h) {\n        return elf.file(h);\n    });\n    elf.log(file);\n});. @ghigio2000 One solution is to monitor click events.\njavascript\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder('instance');\nelf.getUI('cwd').on('click', '[id]', function(e) {\n    var file = elf.file($(this).attr('id'));\n    elf.log(file);\n});. @ghigio2000 Did you solve the title issue? Do not forget to close this issue if you solve it. Also, please make a new issue if you move to another topic.. @ntrimg Something you've done affects something. Please examine what is affecting compared with standalone elFinder.. By default, the URL when the file is opened is the URL of the content itself. It is not via the connector (connector.minimal.php).. By default it is connector.minimal.php.. @rmcdahal Do processing according to the value of $path.. @mozan Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @alexantr I made a new task of Jake build. And added \"elfinder-minimal-2.1.zip\" to nightly builds. However, the file size did not become as small as I expected, it is 658 KB (320 KB - minimized).. @ghigio2000 I plan to solve this by using Flexible box of CSS. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ghigio2000 For volumes with Trash function enabled, the Delete icon will change to Trash icon.. @racoon-attack About jQuery 1.12.4, only IE 8 is loaded. IE 8 is because jQuery 3 does not work. Although elFinder supports IE 8 for convenience, IE 8 is not encouraged due to expiration of vendor support.. @ghigio2000 Please check elfinder.legacy.html.\nPlease adjust the size of the icon with your CSS.. @ghigio2000 This is also related to #2622. The cause of this confusion is where the caption is \"Rename\". I fix it so that I display appropriate caption (\"Alias (Preference)\") to solve this confusion. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @farhadst About Upload Restrictions Please familiarize yourself with uploadAllow, uploadDeny and uploadOrder of Wiki. If uploadOrder in your configuration is array ('deny', 'allow'), it allows all types!\nFor the file name, refer to the acceptedName setting and the Normarizer plugin.. @weiluo8791 There are bugs in elFinder.class.php and elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php. I'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ghigio2000 There is no such setting. Instead, you can cancel the command by including 'preventexec' => true in the array returned by the function specified by the bind option [any command].pre.. @mozan There is no option to disable, so please hide it in CSS.\ncss\n.elfinder-dialog-resize .ui-dialog-buttonset .elfinder-btncnt-1 {\n    display: none;\n}. @mozan There is an option commandsOptions.info.showHashAlgorisms. Please set empty array [].. @mozan There is no option to hide the folder only, so I will add an option. Please tell me why you need this feature to determine what options are best.. @mozan I done. Please try with volume roots option 'dirUrlOwn' => 'hide' with nightly build. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @QuentinCaffeino Did you get any errors on the browser console?  Please check using elFinder.full.js.. @Joramt Client side restrictions have no security implications. To restrict the upload function, you should restrict it on the connector side.\nPHP can also use anonymous functions, so I think that it can be done more easily.\nphp\n'disks' => [\n    'local',\n    'my-disk' => [\n        'URL' => url('to/disk'),\n        'alias' => 'Local storage',\n        'bind' => [\n            'upload.pre' => [function() {\n                $isFull = function() {\n                    // Your logic\n                    return true;\n                };\n                if ($isFull()) {\n                    // prevent uploading...\n                    return array(\n                        'preventexec' => true,\n                        'results' => array('error' => 'Disk capacity is now full.')\n                    );  \n                }\n            }]\n        ]\n    ]\n],. @Joramt Is the version of elFinder old? Please try with the latest version. Also, client side restrictions can be avoided by the user accessing the connector directly.. @aqib555 See https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/connector.minimal.php-dist#L34-L44 . After that, please ask a specific question about the point you do not know.. @carlosgg93 There is a menu \"Action when select file\" in \"Preferences - Work Space\". Please use it.\n\n. @carlosgg93 OK, now elFinder has no option to set default value, so I will add an option to able to it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @carlosgg93 An option was added so that it can be set more easily.\nsee https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commit/ae9e90803b3d77c3ea1914c35ad06201a2e618bd#diff-8f21be2aabffef6829e6a54df1769004. @ghigio2000 What you want is not to control file selection from other than checkbox?. @ghigio2000 You can add a check box with the following settings. However, since there are some problems with check box event handling, I will fix it.\njavascript\nuiOptions : {\n    cwd : {\n        listView : {\n            columns : ['perm', 'date', 'size', 'kind', 'sel']\n        },\n        replacement : {\n            sel : function(f, fm) {\n                return '<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"elfinder-cwd-nonselect elfinder-cwd-list-sel\" data-hash=\"'+f.hash+'\"/>';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}. @ghigio2000 I fixed a bug. Please try with nightly build with...\njavascript\nbootCallback : function(fm, extraObj) {\n    fm.bind('init', function() {\n        fm.getUI('cwd').on('click', 'input.elfinder-cwd-list-chk', function() {\n            var chk = $(this);\n            fm.log([chk.data('hash'), chk.is(':checked')]);\n        });\n    });\n},\nuiOptions: {\n    cwd: {\n        listView : {\n            columns : ['url', 'date', 'size', 'kind', 'chk']\n        },\n        replacement : {\n            chk : function(f, fm) {\n                return '<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"elfinder-cwd-nonselect elfinder-cwd-list-chk\" data-hash=\"'+f.hash+'\"/>';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}. @ghigio2000 \n\n\nPlease implement it yourself using sessionStorage etc.\n\n\nCalling elfinderInstance.selected() will get an array of hashes of the selected items. Please implement it yourself using this. . @ghigio2000 elFinder does not use sessionStorage. You need to handle sessionStorage using JavaScript. I'd suggest checking the sessionStorage with 'replacement' and adding the checked attribute as necessary.. @ghigio2000 Yes, I was able to reproduce the problem. I will fix this.. @Shadi-Ayoub Does the demo site reproduce the same problem?. @Shadi-Ayoub According to your screenshot you put \"image003.jpg\" into trash be \"image003.JPG\". This is a strange behavior. Have you customized anything?. @mozan If those files have a specific MIME type, it is possible by extending the quicklook plugin. Later I will post a sample with the file type \"*.uri\".. This is example to show YouTube player.\n\n\nelFinder client option bootCallback\n```javascript\nbootCallback : function(fm, extraObj) {\n    fm.commands.quicklook.plugins.unshift(\n        function(ql) {\n            \"use strict\";\n            var mime = 'text/uri-list',\n                fm = ql.fm,\n                preview = ql.preview,\n                loading = $(' '+fm.i18n('nowLoading')+'');\n            preview.on(ql.evUpdate, function(e) {\n                var file = e.file, jqxhr;\n            if ((file.mime === mime || (file.mime === 'text/plain' && file.name.match(/\\.uri$/i))) && (file.mediaUrl || (!ql.options.getSizeMax || file.size <= ql.options.getSizeMax))) {\n                if (typeof file.mediaUrl !== 'undefined') {\n                    if (file.mediaUrl) {\n                        e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n                        loading.appendTo(ql.info.find('.elfinder-quicklook-info'));\n                        $('<iframe style=\"width:100%;height:100%;\" src=\"'+file.mediaUrl+'\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>')\n                            .on('load', function() {\n                                loading.remove();\n                                ql.hideinfo();\n                            })\n                            .appendTo(preview);\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n                    loading.appendTo(ql.info.find('.elfinder-quicklook-info'));\n\n                    // stop loading on change file if not loaded yet\n                    preview.one('change', function() {\n                        jqxhr.state() == 'pending' && jqxhr.reject();\n                    }).addClass('elfinder-overflow-auto');\n\n                    jqxhr = fm.request({\n                        data           : {cmd : 'get', target : file.hash, conv : 1, _t : file.ts},\n                        options        : {type: 'get', cache : true},\n                        preventDefault : true\n                    })\n                    .done(function(data) {\n                        var m;\n                        if (m = data.content.match(/(?:^\\s*)(https:\\/\\/www\\.youtube\\.com\\/embed\\/[a-z0-9_-]+)(?:\\s*$)/i)) {\n                            file.mediaUrl = m[1];\n                        } else {\n                            file.mediaUrl = '';\n                        }\n                        fm.updateCache({\n                            files: [file]\n                        });\n                    })\n                    .fail(function() {\n                        file.mediaUrl = '';\n                    })\n                    .always(function() {\n                        preview.trigger({\n                            type: ql.evUpdate,\n                            file: file,\n                            forceUpdate: true\n                        });\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n);\n\n}\n```\nsample file \"yt-test.uri\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/2x5V-PMa8_w. @mozan I edited a line if ((file.mime === mime || (file.mime === 'text/plain' && file.name.match(/\\.uri$/i))) && (file.mediaUrl || (!ql.options.getSizeMax || file.size <= ql.options.getSizeMax))) {.. @nadorator I'll add a connector main option throwErrorOnExec (Default: false).

You are welcome. Anyone can edit the wiki freely. We welcome informative edits any time. \ud83d\udc4d . @fortcms What's the problem you have? Please explain concretely.. The mime.types file is automatically loaded internally. It is not necessary to set auto loading. see https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php#L4370-L4399. As of now, elFinder supports PHP 5.2. Therefore, in order to introduce the namespace, we have to stop supporting PHP 5.2. That decision should be careful.. > PHP 5.2 is hopelessly outdated.\nI understand it well. However, it is certain that a server running PHP 5.2 still exists. I agree to truncate the outdated PHP, but because of the policy to support PHP 5.2 as a project, it requires development of two lines of legacy and edge. However, there is not enough power for that.\n\nTell us how to properly edit the files for my purposes?\n\nIt is best to rewrite the files under the php directory with PSR-4.. @fortcms Yes, you are right! I will fix this. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @uche40 Your site has an error in index.html. \n\nYou can change the setting in main.js as you are doing, or you can change the default option in index.html. On your site, context menu is not displayed due to the setting in main.js you did. It is because the download is not functioning because var myCommands = ['preview', 'sort', 'view', 'fullscreen']; does not contain download.\nDebugging JavaScript is useful when using the browser's developer tool.\nAlso, Please use Chrome's super reload. https://superuser.com/questions/220179/how-can-i-do-a-cache-refresh-in-google-chrome. @uche40 You have already set it up in main.js by yourself.\njavascript\n            var mySub = {\n                // navbarfolder menu\n                //navbar : ['open', '|', 'copy', 'cut', 'paste', 'duplicate', '|', 'rm', '|', 'info'],\n                // current directory menu\n                //cwd    : ['reload', 'back', '|', 'upload', 'mkdir', 'mkfile', 'paste', '|', 'info'],\n                // current directory file menu\n                //files  : [ 'getfile', '|','open', 'quicklook', '|', 'download', '|', 'copy', 'cut', 'paste', 'duplicate', '|', 'rm', '|', 'edit', 'rename', 'resize', '|', 'archive', 'extract', '|', 'info' ]\n                files: ['download'],\n                navbar: ['|'],\n                cwd: ['|']\n            };\nIn order to master elFinder, you need to learn more about JavaScript.. @neo314 Plobably fixed with a17467e.

Therefore, I think that it is not very useful to include only flysystem driver in the core.. What I would like to say is that composers are often used when introducing adapters of Flysystem so it is not very useful to put only Flysystem drivers in the core. I think that it is enough to install the Flysystem driver together when installing Flysystem's adapter by composer.\nWhat are the advantages of maintaining Flysystem's drivers here?. @shinokada Did you check the wiki? https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#uploadmaxsize. @shinokada \"0\" is the default because it does not limit it.. @yatheeshkm Please check the Wiki - https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options-2.1#width .. @rsthomas100 It does not seem to be an issue with elFinder. Please check the source application.. @praad You can use event handler of select.\njavascript\nhandlers : {\n    select : function(e, fm) {\n        var data = e.data;\n        if (data.origin && data.origin === 'cwd') {\n            fm.exec('getfile', data.selected)\n        }\n    }\n}. @padre It seems to be an error on zoho side. Please ask in the zoho community.. @daebak74 Please check the DOM id of the corresponding element in the folder tree with the developer tool of the browser.\n\n. > I belived that was possible to use the hash for get the path\nIn the case of the Google Drive driver, you can access that folder by encoding(hashing) \"/Target parent ID/Target folder ID\". Please try it.. The ID used for the folder hash is the item ID on GoogleDrive. So you will need to store the ID on GoogleDrive in your database as well. Or I think that hash on elFinder may be good.. > Or there is a way to get the elfinder path in callback function and select after init ?\nUsing the following code, you can open the specified folder at any time.\njavascript\nvar hash = 'gd3_Lw';\nelFinderInstance.request({\n    data   : {cmd  : 'open', target : hash},\n    notify : {type : 'open', cnt : 1, hideCnt : true},\n    syncOnFail : true,\n    lazy : false\n});\n\nBy the way would be great to get the Google drive ID from elfinder API :)\n\nYou can get the ID path by decoding hash.\ne.g in PHP\nphp\n$id = 'gd3_';\n// cut volume id after it was prepended in encode\n$hash = substr($hash, strlen($id));\n// replace HTML safe base64 to normal\n$idPath = base64_decode(strtr($h, '-_.', '+/='));\n. @shinokada What is \"Inserting image\"?. Is that something on the WYSIWYG editor? If so, the place you should ask is the WYSIWYG editor repository.. @mparfeniuk PHP requires GD or Imagick. Or, the web server needs the ImageMagick convert command. Please check them.. @neo314 There is an option useBrowserHistory of client. Please check it.. @mit-ems The GooglrDrive driver holds folder information in the session. However, since you do not have access rights to the session object, you can not use it. So extend it to get the session object. Once this is possible, session data can be obtained as follows.\nphp\n'accessControl' => function($name, $path, $accessControlData, $volume) {\n    $session = $volume->getSession();\n    $cacheData = $session->get($volume->id() . $volume->netMountKey);\n}. @sbekzhan This seems to be due to your integration, not the elFinder problem.. @uru You can get URL with getContentUrl.\nphp\nfunction smallImage($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n    if (!empty($result['added'])) {\n        foreach($result['added'] as $i => $f) {\n            if (empty($f['url'])) {\n                $result['added'][$i]['url'] = $volume->getContentUrl($f['hash']);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}. @ghigio2000 Please trigger resize event to window on just after showing the elFinder node.\njavascript\n$(window).trigger('resize');. @RJRahevar The doSearch() method of the volume driver also includes the path attribute in the result. Is the path attribute set?. @ghigio2000 The download callback fires after being downloaded. Therefore, you can not stop the download.. @ghigio2000 To realize that, there is a method to create your own download command (eg mydownload) with reference to the download command and use it.\nRefer to https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues?q=uiCmdMap+label%3Ahowto for how to use the volume driver option uiCmdMap.. @ghigio2000 This is related with https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/2653#issuecomment-427359505. I'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ghigio2000 I tried it on iPhone 6s + iOS 12.0, but there is nothing wrong with it. However, since the touch point is sensitive, I think it would be better to take measures such as setting a margin in the check box.\n\n. I checked on iPhone 6s iOS 12.0.1 Safari. Column size are strange a little but display and operation are no problems.\n\n. - First item (pippo folder) checked\n\n\nSecond item (BHavCove.gpx)\n\n. @ghigio2000 Perhaps by increasing the padding size of the checkbox on touch devices I think that erroneous touch can be prevented. For touch devices, elFinder nodes are given the \"elfinder-touch\" class.. There is no problem in my test environment, so CSS of your environment may be affecting. Usually the column size will not be shifted. Since the column size is calculated according to the header line, there is a possibility that a problem may have occurred in acquiring the header size.. @seekerliu I improved duplicate archiver checks. Also, I added archivers to the main option of the elFinder class. This overrides the archivers option of each volume driver.\n\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @seekerliu Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @uche40 You need to configure GoogleDrive to mount by network mount. Next, add 'refresh_token' option to GoogleDrive's volume root setting.. @uche40 The minimum setting is that GoogleDrive is available on network mount and the following volume root setting.\nphp\narray(\n    'driver' => 'GoogleDrive',\n    'path' => '/', // or folder id of the GoogleDrive,\n    'refresh_token' => 'Your Refresh Token',\n). @ghigio2000 You can hide it for each volume using the disabled root option of the PHP connector, but there is no mechanism to dynamically change with JavaScript after instance creation.. @ghigio2000 See \"commands/view.js\" and \"ui/viewbutton.js\". The points of view.js are this.options = {ui: 'viewbutton'}; and this.exec().. @alexandrovsergii Please try an option enableAlways : true of client options.. This is a bug so i'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @neo314 \n\nIf I secure the Connector is that enough?\n\nYes, On the client UI side, mainly XSS countermeasures have been applied, and we are making efforts to ensure that the security holes on the client UI side are only those caused by the web browser. On the other hand, the security strength of the back end varies depending on your setting. Therefore please pay close attention to setting backend.. @ghigio2000 Prese try...\njavascript\nheight: '100%',\nheightBase: $('#middle'),. @flack There is a bug in elFinderVolumeDriver::mimetype() so i'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @flack It should use the MimeType that is notified by the volume driver. I will fix this.. @fortcms What is the problem with actual operation?. @fortcms I'll add an option i18nBaseUrl. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @fortcms I'll fix this. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . The wiki is not complete yet.\n\nNote: This page is in progress and as such will not list everything. For more options and further documentation, see inside the js/elFinder.options.js file.\n\nAnyone can edit the wiki freely. Everyone's participation is always welcome.. @fortcms Do you mean that you want to change the default language?. @fortcms The language \"en\" is a fallback language and is mandatory for the system. If you want the default language other than \"en\" when browser language is not in elFinder language file, use customized main.js instead of main.default.js.. @fortcms There is an option ui of client options.\njavascript\nui: ['tree', 'path', 'stat'],. @fortcms Sorry, I'll add options. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . You can set next settings when this issue fixed.\njavascript\nuiOptions : {\n    toolbarExtra : {\n        // also displays the text label on the button (true / false / 'none')\n        displayTextLabel: 'none',\n        // show Preference button into contextmenu of the toolbar (true / false)\n        preferenceInContextmenu: false\n    }\n}. @jancarlopacanza \n\nThere is a client option uiOptions.cwd.showSelectCheckboxUA.\nThere is a client option commandsOptions.quicklook.docked.\nIt is necessary to expand and implement the volume driver yourself.. @jancarlopacanza Please make a new Issue with detailed explanation as much as possible if requested about the behavior of Quick Look. However, I do not know if it will be implemented.\n\nUnfortunately there is no detailed technical documentation of elFinder. Please understand by reading the source code and implement it. (I also did so). I think that technical data should be present, but at the moment human resources are not enough.\nThanks!. @nanghele , @fortcms \"Zero Width Space\" is inserted for the purpose of appropriately breaking a long path when the dialog width is narrow. If you want to get the item URL, right click on the \"link\" item and obtain the URL.. OK, I see. I'll make implement remove ZWSP with mousedown event.. @fortcms There is a bug in environments where network mount is not enabled, so I will fix this. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @fortcms Please check elFinder::$netDrivers of connector.minimal.php.dist .. @Chaffinch Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ji-ryoo I checked with... on the Nightly build.\nphp\n'accessControl' => null,\n'attributes'    => array(),\n'acceptedName'  => '/^[^\\/\\0]+$/',\nIt can...\n- Make a file \".htaccess\" was OK\n- Edit was OK\n- Preview was OK\n- Delete  was OK. @fortcms There is a no-problem with default theme about element height. However, I think also that this control does not match the header category. So I consider to make to move it to footer.

I change the content class name to \"elfinder-resize-container\" and also modify the CSS.. @jancarlopacanza For item selection, the destination folder is first selected when the folder is moved, and when the CWD is switched, it becomes non-selected state. To continue selecting items Place an item in the clipboard with the Copy command. Clipboard data can be obtained withfm.clipbord()`.. @jancarlopacanza Please use this.\njavascript\nfm.clipboard(fm.selected());\nvar files = fm.clipboard();. @jancarlopacanza The problem is that elFinder keeps the file cache only if it is CWD's or what is in the clipboard. So it seems better to create your own commands.\nFor example,\n- Keep the selected file in its own variables with that command\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - var keeps = [];\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - keeps.push (FileObject); // Please check and remove duplicate registrations\n- Create a UI that lists the file information held in that variable\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - something with your coding\n- Call download command by user download action\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - elFinderInstance.cache(keeps, 'add'); // add to cache\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - elFinderInstance.exec('download', $.map(keeps, function() {return this.hash;});. @fortcms \n\nI'm not use this icon...\n\nThey are included in the distribution package and can not be deleted.. @fortcms There is a tab \"Theme\".\n\n.

And you can hide any preferences with an option prefs.\nsee https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/js/commands/preference.js#L32. It is meaningful to be able to remember it because you can change the icon size. In addition, the last value is saved automatically for sorting. As for the dialog size, there are many items on the All tab and it is meaningful that the user can change the size of the dialog.\nAlso, group change can be changed by setting..

And, The screenshot you presented is different from normal behavior. \"Unable to create folder \".ElFinder_trash\".\" This is never displayed with the empty command.. @johnfort It may be because the file size is too large. Please check if there is a problem with a small file size of about several megabytes. It may be better to limit file size.. @johnfort The rar preview passes the item URL to the rar library. It seems that the URL can not be processed by the rar library for some reason. You can disable rar preview by setting ui option cdns.rar to NULL.\njavascript\ncdns: { rar : null }. @johnfort Since rar gets data via the URL via the browser, even if it is a local host, there is no problem if it can access the URL.\nYou can find out why data can not be acquired with developer tools and so on. If you can not get the data please disable rar preview.\nAnd if you solve, do not forget to close this issue.. I have no problem with rar preview so I will close it.. @johnfort I can not understand exactly what you want. Please let me know which command you want to do.. @johnfort What do you want?\n(I am sorry that my understanding of English is weak.). @johnfort The basic design of elFinder adopts it because it is rounded round. Please adjust it with CSS to change it.. Even assigning own class name will specify the same style as CSS in jQuery-UI, so you either need to overwrite the CSS in either case. I think that there is not much difference.\nex.\n.elfinder .ui-corner-all { border-radius: 0; }\nor\n.elfinder-ui-corner-all { border-radius: 0; }. I will arrive at not using the \"ui-*\" class if I stick to your logic. That is because the boundary of what to eliminate is ambiguous. For example, margin, padding, display, etc. may be disturbing depending on theme. For now I think that theme.css is to define color. Please understand that applying the unique theme by overwriting it with the theme by jQuery-UI as a standard.\nOn the other hand, if there is something that can not be dealt with by overwriting it should be rectified, please let me know if there is such a point.\nAlso, elFinder was not thought about changing the theme at the beginning of development, so if we are going to start elFinder 3, I would like to have a structure that will become a separate CSS from logic and design.. @johnfort For toolbar I found that it is okay to delete \"ui - corner - \". I will delete it.. Again, I decided to revive the designation of \"ui-corner-all\" CSS class of toolbar. Instead, I'll remove \"border-radius: 4px\" from toolbar.css. The reason is that the designation of \"ui-corner-all\" is often used elsewhere, so removing it from toolbar has no meaning. There is the possibility of removing \"ui-corner-\" in the future, but it is not now. ( 13c7a0ecb55a1e7464cb758b42c9682255c114fd ). I will consider using jQuery-UI's CSS class in this next major version.. @dogmaxpeppe event.data.added is files infometion array.\njavascript\nelFinderInstance.bind('upload', function(e, fm) {\n    fm.log(e.data);\n});. @dogmaxpeppe That is basic in JavaScript.\njavascript\nvar data = e.data;\n// or for Added items\nvar files = e.data.added || [];\n. @MisterOl71 It seems that you can preview odt with ViewerJS.. @MisterOl71 OK, I tested the integration of ViewerJS and it is a good feeling so I will incorporate it into the default viewer. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @MisterOl71 I done. Please check https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/9ed86111369e13d50432303155b88195fde39904/js/elFinder.options.js#L367-L372 .. @MisterOl71 You can use the Nightly Build until next release. Please try it.. @MisterOl71 If GoogleDocs preview is not available due to network restrictions, please disable GoogleDocs preview. (also sharecad and officeOnline)\njavascript\nquicklook : {\n    // to enable CAD-Files and 3D-Models preview with sharecad.org\n    sharecadMimes : [],\n    // to enable preview with Google Docs Viewer\n    googleDocsMimes : [],\n    // to enable preview with Microsoft Office Online Viewer\n    // these MIME types override \"googleDocsMimes\"\n    officeOnlineMimes : []\n}. @MisterOl71 Please check #2742 .. @johnfort Since it is difficult to specify a class with only the file name on current  implementation, enclose the word to be replace in the error message with  with the class name \"elfinder-err-var\". And to default to set \"word-break: break-all;\". Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @sabeti05 The current elFinder does not have a mechanism to acquire page unit data from the back end.\nsee #1879 .. However, if processing on the server takes time, pagination is not a solution to this problem. Since the back end needs to sort the data according to instructions from the client and then send it after splitting it, it may be later than it is now.\nCurrently, on my test server, processing time of folders with about 6000 image files is about 12 seconds.. I'm reluctant about pagination. elFinder client side processing time is considerably less than backend processing time. Because rendering in stages as needed instead of rendering all the items. Depending on the processing capacity of the client, processing time for folders with 10,000 items on low-end PCs is about 1.8 seconds. In fact it can be used conveniently by searching items by incremental search and narrowing down and displaying them.. @johnfort I am fixing this because it is necessary to correct the part hard-coding different values depending on the content of CSS. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @johnfort \"elfinder-navbar-spinner\" will be integrated into \"elfinder-spinner\". On the other hand, since \"elfinder-resize-spinner\" is actually a progress bar, it will not be integrated. Thanks!. @johnfort I'll change CSS class name elfinder-resize-spinner to elfinder-resize-loading.. @johnfort Please try to call elfinderInstance.disable() when the drop menu is opened.. I understood. Taping the list header to sort it will display an unnecessary context menu, right? So I'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . 01378c8 was make a bug that is impossible to open contextmenu of the file. I'll fix it.. @Guille270 Please check with the latest version of elFinder or Nightly Build.. @Guille270 I do not know about CodeIgniter well, but probably the path to main.default.js is incorrect. You will first need to check elFinder without any integration.. @johnfort I will modify the order of the icons. ~~However, I will not prepare the icon for rtl in the default theme.~~ Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \nUPDATE: I done that mirroring some icons for rtl.. @johnfort Each command has its own class name in the container of the dialog.\nelfinder-dialog-help, elfinder-dialog-preference and elfinder-dialog-edit.. @johnfort I do not understand the meaning well. The elfinder-titlebar-button-right class is given to buttons in the dialog header for Windows clients.. @johnfort Did you solve?. @johnfort OK, I understood. Also fix the dialog header of Quicklook so that it will be outputted in the same HTML structure as other dialogs. Also, unify \"elfinder-platformWin\" class to \"elfinder-titlebar-button-right\" class.. @dogmaxpeppe Currently it is an action to cancel uploading when uploading errors occur, but I will modify it so that it will not cancel items that can be uploaded. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @aminbaik Please double check your root option URL.. @twisted1919 I verified it with a nightly build. When set to the Volume roots option, the same name file is incremented and uploaded. I think that this behavior is the same in 2.1.42.\nphp\n$opts = array(\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'uploadOverwrite' => false,\n        )\n    )\n);. @ghigio2000 Is elFinder demo site displayed on your mobile device? At least I have not seen this problem.. @ghigio2000 About WebView, I do not have any solutions. I do not know it well.. @BuffaloBrennan In your environment, which MIME type is detected when uploading?\n\n. Try the latest version or Nightly Build, can you see the MIME Type with the error message?. @BuffaloBrennan \n\nI modified the file php\\mime.types and added msg to the application/octet-stream entry worked a treat (so far) and added 'application/octet-stream' to the allowUpload list\n\nIf non-administrator can upload the item it is very dangerous. \"application/octet-stream\" contains the executable file and includes the unknown file type.\nThe best bet is to add \"application/vnd.ms-outlook\" to additionalMimeMap`in the connector root setting. (require elFinder >= 2.1.22)\nphp\n'additionalMimeMap' => array(\n    'msg:application/octet-stream' => 'application/vnd.ms-outlook',\n    'msg:application/CDFV2-corrupt' => 'application/vnd.ms-outlook',\n),\n. @johnfort The online-converter tab uses the tabs plugin of jQuery - UI, but help and preferences are rendering by own script. This is because the tabs plugin is not mandatory. Therefore, I will modify it to be a class similar to the tabs plugin when rendering by own script. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . Fixed at 5a3f78f4588cbec1f0084cfefeb649430c2de790 .. @d0coco What did you try and what did not go wrong?. Have you added \"application/json\" to the uploadable MIME-Type?. > I added it to the elfinder.mimetypes. Js file\nNo, uploadable MIME-Type is a connector root option. Please double check the Wiki.. > I added it to the elfinder.mimetypes. Js file\nNo, uploadable MIME-Type is a connector root option. Please double check the Wiki.. @d0coco Please try set connector root option dispInlineRegex.\nDefault value: '^(?:(?:video|audio)|image/(?!.+\\+xml)|application/(?:ogg|x-mpegURL|dash\\+xml)|(?:text/plain|application/pdf)$)'\nTo\n'^(?:(?:video|audio)|image/(?!.+\\+xml)|application/(?:ogg|x-mpegURL|dash\\+xml|json)|(?:text/plain|application/pdf)$)'\nThen... you will can open .json into new window by dblclick on the item in cwd.. @UnreALi Thank you for your contribution. \ud83d\udc4d . @laiyangwen Yes, that's right. So, I'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @d0coco In the distribution package elfinder.html, load elfinder.min.js. It does not use elfinder.js. I guess you have customized something by yourself.. @johnfort Specifically, which part?. OK, I thought that designation of padding by inline to the maximize element is unnecessary so I will delete it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @UnreALi \n1.\nphp\n if ($this->ARGS['cmd'] !== 'duplicate') { \n    $this->added[] = $this->stat($path); \n }\nCurrently, processing is done with elFinder::duplicate(). However, since it is not a good method to judge by processing with $ this->ARGS['cmd'] !== 'duplicate', I will fix this.\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/df0beb187ef6fa7bc0255cd7b5405fefa0e4bdd2/php/elFinder.class.php#L2124-L2156\n\n\nMessage catalog can be changed with JavaScript. Please change elFinder.prototype.i18 before elFinder instance creation, or elFinderInstance.messages if created.\n\n\nIf you want to integrate with CMS, i recommend that you create a driver based on the MySQL driver.\n\n\ne.g. https://github.com/nao-pon/xelfinder/blob/master/xoops_trust_path/modules/xelfinder/plugins/xelfinder_db/driver.class.php. @UnreALi For example in my project X-elFinder ...\n\nParent-child relationships of items, permissions, references to file entities are managed in the database.\nThe entity of the file is outside the document root. In order to fully control the access rights of items.\nAccess to the file entity is done through PHP connector or gateway.\nIf the server supports X-SendFile etc., we use it to improve performance.\n\nI do not know about Glide well, but probably it will be possible to use it.\n. @laiyangwen How about next?\nif ((fm.uplMaxSize && size + blobSize >= fm.uplMaxSize) || fcnt > fm.uplMaxFile) {\nto\nif ((fm.uplMaxSize && size + blobSize > fm.uplMaxSize) || fcnt > fm.uplMaxFile) {\n. @patackett I checked 2.1.42, but there was no problem. What browser do you use?. @Chaffinch Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @QuentinCaffeino Please recheck if this problem is reproduced in the latest version or nightly build. Thanks!. @MisterOl71 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @willi552 It seems that the network transfer rate is slow or the server's processing capacity is low. The speed does not change with the setting of the item that can be uploaded.. @maa3x The sending of cookies is completely under the control of the browser. If you use the Cross Origin Request, please deepen your understanding of Cross Origin Request.. Since cookie is not sent, I guessed it was CORS. If it is not CORS, it can not be controlled with JavaScript. Please check the attribute of cookie (path etc.).. @mauleous At currently, there is no option like that, so I will make it possible with the ui option sortAlsoTreeview : null. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @changkejun Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . It marged. Thanks!. @ArniXXX Please set the main option locale or the volume root setting locale appropriately.. @ArniXXX Please set the main option locale or the volume root setting locale appropriately.. @ArniXXX PHP's built-in function basename() functions normally by setting the locale correctly. Since the locale affects other functions, please properly specify the locale in which basename() functions properly.\nAlso, if the file system of the server is other than UTF-8, please properly specify encoding as well. In that case, specify the main option locale as UTF-8 and the roots option locale as its encoding.. @bgbruno Please use the volume driver option mimeTypeUnknown (elFinder >= 2.1.43).. @bgbruno The mimeTypeUnknown option requires 2.1.43 or later. When using 'mimeDetect'=>'internal', all file types not defined in mime.types will be of the MIME type specified by the mimeTypeUnknown option.. @thany This is a bug. I will fix this. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @thany I misread the source code. The uploadfail event is triggered when an error is received from the backend. The data includes backend response. On the other hand, uploading may be canceled before being sent to the back end. For that, I will create a new event xhruploadfail. The data includes the file object that was about to be sent.\nRel. #2784 . Fixed via 290e4588f3c1636cd5e6f7320c474ab0c0953944 .. See #2783 (make new event xhruploadfail).. @JCharlesSL There is a problem with event handling of the droppable element in the current version. There is a problem that event handling can not be performed correctly when the tree view width is large and it overlaps the lower layer of CWD. I will fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Tab3r The behavior looks odd. The zipdl command requires keeping of a PHP session. Is the client able to keeping the session?\nCan you debug the next part of elFinder.class.php?\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/281a509c59ba5649c10490bdc5e0790dec3c60f0/php/elFinder.class.php#L1695-L1706. @aminbaik Please save all JavaScript etc. read from CDN to your local and read it. Maybe, using \"elfinder.legacy.html\" will be easier to migrate.. @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @RobiNN1 Sorry, I overlooked this. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @weiluo8791 This seems to be caused by the following part.\nphp\n                exec('rd /S /Q ' . escapeshellarg($dir), $o, $r);\n                if ($r === 0) {\n                    exec('del /F /Q ' . escapeshellarg($dir), $o, $r);\n                }\nPerhaps it should be fixed as follows. I will fix this.\nphp\n                if (!is_link($dir) && is_dir($dir)) {\n                    exec('rd /S /Q ' . escapeshellarg($dir), $o, $r);\n                } else {\n                    exec('del /F /Q ' . escapeshellarg($dir), $o, $r);\n                }\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @aminbaik It seems to be a file system write permission issue. Please specify the PHP writable directory in commonTempPath of connector main option.. @creedrahul Is it possible to solve by uploading directly to the file system on the Web server?. @disha2018 To determine where this problem is, install elFinder alone and check it.. @alexandrovsergii When using the cssAutoLoad option, please do not load elfinder.min.css or elfinder.full.css in HTML. \"css/elfinder.min.css\" and \"css/elfinder.theme.css\" are automatically loaded.. @alexandrovsergii I changed the line 18 of elfinder.html as follows and tried it. The result is no problem. \njavascript\n                    cssAutoLoad : ['css/test.css'],\n                    url : 'php/connector.minimal.php' // connector URL (REQUIRED)\nFor cssloaded, pay attention to elfinder.js.. \"elfinder.legacy.html\" is a sample to load necessary files in HTML. Please read the necessary CSS in HTML.. @alexandrovsergii You can use client option bootCallback. Please try it.\njavascript\nbootCallback : function(fm, extraObj) {\n    fm.bind('cssloaded', function() {\n        fm.loadCss(['URL to CSS file']);\n    });\n}. @ji-ryoo A bug when uploading multiple files was found on the client side. That is a bug where not all files are uploaded. I will fix it.\nOn the other hand, since there is no option to limit the number of files, I will consider that.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @ji-ryoo I fixed a bug when uploading multiple files via #2799. You can check the outcome of this fix in a nightly build.\nNow, regarding the restriction function of the number of files that can be uploaded, the elFinder client handles file upload in multiple steps. Therefore, I think that limiting the number of files that can be uploaded has little meaning. Do you need that option?. > Perhaps I think that the upper limit of the file upload is gone, so the restriction function is not necessary at the moment.\nOK, I'll close this.\n\nI uploaded a folder containing 30000 files, the file will go out of the folder like #2593. Why...?\n\nIs PHP setting post_max_size sufficient? Is it set several megaby larger than upload_max_filesize? If you still have problems, please create a new issue.\nThanks.. @masihfathi \n\nis it possible to change this behavior to load and create thumbnails in FTP server?\n\nIn order to do that it is necessary to extend the \"elFinderVolumeFTP\" class by yourself.\n\nhow can be possible to disable thumbnail creating for FTP server driver in the elfinder config? Is it adequate to not set tmb path and tmb url to disable thumbnail creating?\n\nThat's right. That's not a problem.. @aminbaik When PHP is less than 7.1 on Windows server, character encoding can not be handled properly. Using PHP 7.1 or above will solve the problem.\nThanks.. @aminbaik I only have Windows in Japanese environment, so I can not debug other languages. Please let me know if you have any information.\nThanks!. @aminbaik Decompressing the zip archive uses the shell command on the server or PHP's ZipArchive class. Basically, if a file containing a file name other than UTF-8 is included, you need to set your own archiver settings.\nDo you have a alternate code or command setting that can handle the character encoding you use?. If you have functions yourCustomCompressor() / yourCustomDecompressor() that you process with PHP it looks like this.\n```php\n<?php\nfunction yourCustomCompressor($workingDir, $files, $zipFilename) {\n    // see elFinderVolumeDriver::zipArchiveZip()\n}\nfunction yourCustomDecompressor($zipPath, $toDir) {\n    // see elFinderVolumeDriver::zipArchiveUnzip()\n}\n$opts = array(\n    'roots' => array(\n        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n        'archivers' => array(\n            'create' => array(\n                'application/zip' => array(\n                    'cmd' => 'phpfunction',\n                    'argc' => 'yourCustomCompressor',\n                    'ext' => 'zip'\n                )\n            ),\n            'extract' => array(\n                'application/zip' => array(\n                    'cmd' => 'phpfunction',\n                    'argc' => 'yourCustomDecompressor',\n                    'ext' => 'zip'\n                )\n            )\n        )\n    )\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```. @aminbaik This is the connector to which elFinder client is connected. For default configuration it is \"php/connector.minimal.php\".. @mtran0011 Thank you for accurate PR. \ud83d\udc4d . @alexandrovsergii Please set commandsOptions.search.searchTypes to empty and hide it in the style sheet.\njavascript\ncommandsOptions : {\n    search : {\n        searchTypes : {}\n    }\n}\ncss\n.elfinder .buttonset.elfinder-search-type {\n    display: none;\n}. @oitsuki \nThis problem has already been fixed in 2.1.44.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commit/b7fc3e078a069ef52fb5b7eaf22c8d06f162d401\n\nThanks.. @hardiktailored Since users can start a new upload during uploading, there is no status to end all uploads. Instead, you can detect that there is no upload dialog with the following code.\njavascript\n// `fm` is elFinder instance\nfm.bind('upload', function(e) {\n    var ntfNode = fm.getUI('notify');\n    requestAnimationFrame(function() {\n        var hasDialog = ntfNode.children('.elfinder-notify-upload').length? true : false;\n        if (! hasDialog) {\n            fm.log('All uploads was done.');\n        }\n    })\n}). @hardiktailored Please check e.data.added and process it when the file is added.\njavascript\nfm.bind('upload', function(e) {\n    if (e.data && e.data.added && e.data.added.length) {\n        var ntfNode = fm.getUI('notify');\n        requestAnimationFrame(function() {\n            var hasDialog = ntfNode.children('.elfinder-notify-upload').length? true : false;\n            if (! hasDialog) {\n                fm.log('All uploads was done.');\n            }\n        });\n    }\n});. @hardiktailored While uploading multiple files, event.data.added may be notified more than once depending on its contents. This is the specification of elFinder. By keeping these values while the dialog is displayed, you can process the values collectively when the dialog disappears.. @hardiktailored It can be solved by delaying the timing to check the dialog. I tried a simple test script. It seems to work well.\njavascript\nvar uploadFiles = [];\nfm.bind('upload', function(e) {\n    if (e.data && e.data.added && e.data.added.length) {\n        var ntfNode = fm.getUI('notify');\n        uploadFiles = uploadFiles.concat(e.data.added);\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            var hasDialog = ntfNode.children('.elfinder-notify-upload').length? true : false;\n            var cnt;\n            if (! hasDialog && (cnt = uploadFiles.length)) {\n                uploadFiles = [];\n                alert(cnt + ' item are added.');\n            }\n        }, 100);\n    }\n});. @hardiktailored I tried it, it seems to work well.\n\nhttps://output.jsbin.com/yumeyus/ (live demo)\n\nhttps://jsbin.com/yumeyus/edit?js (JavaScript). @hardiktailored No worries!. @applibs I have tested the latest elFinder with the following browsers, but there is nothing wrong.\n\n\nEdge 42.17134.1.0\n\nFirefox 64.0\nie 11.472.17134.0\nChrome 71.0.3578.98\n\nOpera 57.0.3098.106. @applibs I have tested the latest elFinder with the following browsers, but there is nothing wrong.\n\n\nEdge 42.17134.1.0\n\nFirefox 64.0\nie 11.472.17134.0\nChrome 71.0.3578.98\nOpera 57.0.3098.106. @applibs I found a cause. Usually, the <form> element completely covers the <div> element, but this problem occurs if the <form> element is not completely covered under the influence of other style sheets. So I will fix this.\n\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @StreamZero I am working on this issue now. I will fix it within a few days.. @StreamZero I added a new option onetimeUrl of volume root options.\nPlease try\n'onetimeUrl' => true\nor\n'onetimeUrl' => function($file, $options, $volumeInstance) { return 'String of onetimeurl'; }\nTo enable onetime URL support.. @StreamZero Included in the next release, until then you can try it with Nightly Build.. @applibs Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d .   @applibs I am trying the phpStorm you recommended. This is the best way to find bugs. This is a bit heavy, but I'd like to use it for coding checking. Well, I also recognized other bugs you reported, so I will fix it in a few days. Thank you!. @applibs Do you know how to return it in the function document of \"imageMagickConvertPrepare()\"?. OK, I done. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @Chaffinch Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . It fixed via 896af8cb44f7eb51a280ba834bc4799f8d634703 . I made a typo in the commit log.. @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @johnfort Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @michalheger If it differs from the default configuration, make sure to set tmbPath and tmbURL.\nThanks!. @Ratana176 Multi-byte space characters are mixed in the source code, so I will fix this.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @toastbrotch It can be used by using iframe. I have created a demo page. And I am currently planning an example that does not use iframes.  The document will be serviced once it is completed.\nDemo: https://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/tinymce/v5i.html\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . A dialog version was also made.\n\nhttps://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/tinymce/v5d.html\n\nThen, I will investigate tinymce 5 imagetools from now.\n. @toastbrotch , @johnfort \nI configured to be able to save image editing results on TinyMCE through elFinder.\n\nhttps://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/2.1/tinymce5.html \ud83d\udc4d \n\nHowever, it require the nightly build or 2.1.47 or later.. I made the tinymceElfinder that elFinder integrator for TinyMCE 4 and 5. Using it makes integration easier.. @toastbrotch The folder hash value on elFinder is a hashed version of the path on elFinder.\nsee. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1564\nMaybe, your case is 'l1_Lw' - l(LocalVolumeDriver)1(1st)_Lw(/). @johnfort Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @johnfort Try the fm.path() function.\njavascript\nfm.path(file.hash, false/*i18n*/, true/*async*/).done(function(path) {\n    // tips: path contain volume root name\n    fm.log(path);\n}).fail(function() {\n    // error handling\n});. @johnfort \njavascript\ngetFileCallBack : function(file, fm) {\n    fm.path(file.hash, false, true).done(function(path) {\n        // tips: path contain volume root name\n        fm.log(path);\n    }).fail(function() {\n        // error handling\n    });\n}. For security reasons, we can not get the full path of the server on the client side. When processing something on the server, it is necessary to process it on the connector side.. Please use URL of the connector roots option. Can you cope with by changing the setting value dynamically for each access right?. Please use the value of file.url in getFileCallback.. @johnfort If absolute path from the web server document root is required as the content URL, specify the absolute path from the document root in the 'URL' option.. How's this?\nphp\n$opts['roots'][0]['path'] = 'application/';\n$opts['roots'][0]['URL'] = './';\nif(!System::Access()->isSystem){\n    $opts['roots'][0]['path'] .= 'uploads/';\n    $opts['roots'][0]['URL'] .= 'uploads/';\n}\njavascript\ngetFileCallback: function( file, fm ){\n    $('.mce-open').parent().children('input[id^=\"mceu_\"]').val(file['url']);\n}. @johnfort Congrats! \ud83d\udc4d . @johnfort Is the loaded \"scripts/elFinder/elfinder.js\" built \"elfinder.min.js\" or \"elfinder.full.js\"?. I made a live demo and tried it, but it seems to be no problem.\n\nhttps://jsbin.com/zecobes/edit?html,output. @johnfort I fixed it. Please try nightly build. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @manctm Please let us know your detailed server environment (OS, OS character encoding, PHP version etc ...). elFinder may not handle character encoding other than UTF-8 normally.\n\nThanks.. Is the same result if you change the connector's main option locale to 'zh_CN.UTF-8'?\n'locale' => 'zh_CN.UTF-8'\n. I uploaded it to the demo site, but it seems that there is no problem.\n\nhttps://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/#elf_l2_Y25fdGVzdA\n\nIs the character encoding of the server file system UTF-8 correct?. @rebekah65 I will consider this. Thank you! :+1: . @johnfort The windows server needs to use \\ as the separator. Usually, separator is set automatically.. Please convert with JavaScript.\nFor example ...\njavascript\npath = path.replace(/\\\\/g, '/');. @johnfort Thanks! As another method, execute 'netmout' command after executing the first open command.\njavascript\nvar opts = {\n    url : 'php/connector.minimal.php'\n};\nvar fm = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\nfm.one('open', function(e, fm) {\n    fm.exec('netmount');\n});. @iambudi Is it supposed to be combined with some authentication system? In order to set security restrictions, configure the config value dynamically on the connector side.. @iambudi If you control the volume display by authority, you should control it with the roots array instead of using the hidden attribute.\n```php\n$opts = array(\n    'roots' => array()\n);\nif ($isAdmin) {\n    $opts['roots'][] = array(\n        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n        'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n    );\n}\nif ($isUser) {\n    $opts['roots'][] = array(\n        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'path'   => '/path/to/files1/',\n        'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files1/'\n    );\n}\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n``. @iambudi You can use an option [accessControl`](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#accesscontrol) of volume roots options.\nFor example, the function for A can be written as\n``php\n/**\n * Simple function to demonstrate how to control file access using \"accessControl\" callback.\n * This method will disable accessing files/folders starting from '.'

Are the following links useful for you?\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Ahowto+upload+bind. @toastbrotch One way to do this is to extend the elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem class. This example is simple. Actually it may be necessary to prevent degradation in performance by caching dim in some way.\n\nphp\nclass elFinderVolumeMyLocalFileSystem extends elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem\n{\n    protected function stat($path) {\n        $file = parent::stat($path);\n        if ($file) {\n            $dim = $this->_dimensions($this->convEncIn($path, true), $file['mime']);\n            if ($dim) {\n                $file['dim'] = $dim;\n            }\n        }\n        return $file;\n    }\n}\n```php\n$opts = array(\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'driver' => 'MyLocalFileSystem',\n            'path'   => '/path/to/files/',\n            'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'\n        )\n    )\n);\n// run elFinder\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n```. @toastbrotch Thanks! There is a donate button in demo site.\n\n. @mjyu51 If your connector is PHP's LocalFileSystem, the PHP execution account on the web server is the file owner.. @mjyu51 If you use PHP's LocalFileSystem driver, the file creator will be the PHP execution account. This is an OS specification and can not be controlled by PHP script. Also, in order to chown, you need to run php as root account.\nOn the other hand, if you use the FTP driver, the logged-in user becomes the file owner by mounting by network mount etc.. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @edison009 You can limit the number of simultaneous uploads in max_file_uploads of PHP setting, elFinder can make asynchronous request, so it may not make much sense.\nFor the upload quota, I think the following link will be helpful.\n\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1467. @edison009 I seem to have misread the question. I think that this is a problem with the servlet backend so please ask the servlet developer.. @StreamZero The setting is correct with that. However, if the last size is stored in the local storage of the browser, it will take precedence. Please try resetting your personal preferences.\n\n\n. @StreamZero I found elFinder's bug so i'll fix it. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @arky123 If the trash is enabled, you can undo that operation so you will not get a dialog. If the trash is disabled, a confirmation dialog will appear.. @Chaffinch Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @mjyu51 The LocalFileSystem driver can be used by mounting Sanba on the OS.. @zero77 In the modern browser, what is the advertisement of video.js compared to the media preview of elFinder?\nThanks!. @zero77 I could not find the corresponding video.js plugins for them.. @Doals Please try autoResize plugin.. @Doals I done.

My recommendation is the type of photopea, using window.message. Besides that, there are also types that create plugin on the PHP side like zohoeditor.. @mjyu51 I added a reference image into the Wiki.

There is an option ui of client options.. @webcontributor \njavascript\nui: ['toolbar', 'stat']\nsee live demo - https://jsbin.com/netuhah/edit?js,output. @mehrdadshirvan You can configure the connector config dynamically based on the role of the current user.\nFor example... https://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/#elf_l1_QmFzaWNBdXRoRXhhbXBsZQ. @toastbrotch Perhaps this is a duplicated to #2836.. @toastbrotch Yes, Please try the nightly build.. @toastbrotch Thank you for verifying! \ud83d\udc4d . @zorn-v This is a measure for the problem of duplicate cookie being transmitted, but since that problem exists only in apache2 SAPI, it needs to be processed only for that environment. I will fix this.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @zorn-v I'm sorry to be confused. What I would like to say is that \"ini_set ('session.use_cookies', 0);' is required only for apache2 SAPI.. @zorn-v , @MrAwanishKumar I fixed it. Please try nightly build.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @johnfort About \"full screen of the device\", It might be useful on small screen devices like mobile devices. How about a plan that changing the \"full screen of the device\" / \"full window on the browser\" by user setting?. @johnfort I tried it with user setting, and its work is quite nice. I will try to implement this.. @johnfort Please try with commandOptions.fullscreen.mode to 'window' on the nightly build.\njavascript\ncommandOptions: {\n    fullscreen: {\n        mode: 'window'\n    }\n}\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @johnfort Options can be changed by the bootCallback option function.\nFor example\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    url : 'php/connector.php',\n    bootCallback : function(fm, extraObj) {\n        fm.options.commandsOptions.fullscreen.mode = fm.UA.Mobile? 'screen' : 'window';\n    }\n}. @aftabir The path option is not set correctly. Or, the specified directory can not be found, or PHP does not have read permission.\nThanks!. @aftabir Ask barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver for information on setting barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver. Configure so that the correct value is set to the setting value path of the elFinder connector.. @munish48 Is the file extension \".cpp\"? If you are using the official PHP connector, MIME-Type will be detected as \"text/x-c\" and it should be editable.\nThanks!. @bgbruno AutoSync is checked on the server side by long polling method. It may take up to 30 seconds for the inquiry time. Therefore, if you open elFinder on many tabs, the number of concurrent connections reaches the upper limit, waiting for a request will occur. That is the cause of this problem.\nI plan to incorporate an action that does not query the server for AutoSync when the tab is not displayed.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . > number of concurrent connections reaches the upper limit, waiting for a request will occur\nOK\nQ pls where in code is this sync action?\nPerhaps the browser limits the number of concurrent accesses per host. It is not a limitation of elFinder.\n\nThat is the cause of this problem\nQ pls this problem occurs per user device or by server ?\n\nIt probably comes from the browser. However, in some cases it may be restricted by the server. You can see it by observing the HTTP session.\n\nI plan to incorporate an action that does not query the server for AutoSync when the tab is not displayed.\nQ thx that would be awesome - any ETA?\n\nIt will be included in the next version. Before that you can try it with Nightly Build.\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @cristiangervasi I am fixing this because backwards compatibility is broken.\nHowever, there are new ways in theme designation.\nUse options themes and theme.\njavascript\nthemes : {\n    // You can specify a manifest.\n    default : 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RobiNN1/elFinder-Material-Theme/manifests/material-default.json'\n},\ntheme : 'default',\nurl : 'php/connector.minimal.php' // connector URL (REQUIRED)\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @KlausHB The calculation of the total size of the files contained in the folder is burdensome on the server, so it is calculated only when the user needs it.\nThanks!. @KlausHB There are many costs involved in calculating the total size of the files contained in a folder. It is not realistic to always calculate their size, especially if the folder contains so many files and descendant folders. Therefore, elFinder is designed to calculate only when the user needs it. Please refer to the following video.\n\nIf you want to always show the total folder size, you need to create your own driver that includes the folder size in the file information.. @adolforo That is probably the function of the drag-out works and the server is getting through the URL. The server seems to be unable to read for its URL.\nEven so, normally, while holding down the Alt key, dragging will be handled via the URL, but have you changed the Firefox key binding?. @adolforo It seems that detection of Alt key and Uppercase key is only confused with Firefox. It may be a jQuery specification.\nWell, let's talk about the behavior of elFinder when dragging out.\nIf you start dragging while holding down the Alt key, elFinder starts HTML 5 specification dragging. In the drag data, the URL of the item is set, so if you drop it into elFinder, the content will be retrieved from the URL on the web server side and the file will be saved.\nTherefore, to save content successfully, you need to configure the web server to allow the web server to retrieve data using the URL pointed to by the item in elFinder. In a typical configuration, this should work without problems, but depending on the server configuration it may not work correctly.\nPlease check if your item can be obtained from the URL of the item indicated by elFinder on your web server.. @alexantr Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @zorn-v Thanks, I'll fix it.. @aaryansaharan This vulnerability has already been reported by Thomas Chauchefoin (Synacktiv), registered as CVE-2019-9194, and has been fixed in elFinder 2.1.48. Please use elFinder 2.1.48 or later.\nThanks!. @shiyee For example, quicklook.googledocs.js has a sample to preview on <iframe>.. @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @RobiNN1 Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @RobiNN1 PHP's finfo seems to get the wrong MIME type. I will correct this.\nI tried on the demo site about the file name \"c.c\" but it seems that there is no problem.. @RobiNN1 I think that the file name \"c.c\" is not acceptable because of the connector setting. Check the acceptedName option.\nAnd, there are no problems with some MIME-Types of the files you have highlighted in red.

The idea was just to show how it works, your example will be great for documentation examples\n. This is probably wrong \\W means \"NOT character (a-zA-Z + locale), underscore or digit\"\n. I suggest /^\\w[\\w\\s\\.\\-]*$/.\n^\\w - means it must start with character, digit or underscore.\nThe other part [\\w\\s\\.\\-]* indicates allowed characters letters, digits, underscore, minus and dot\n. using \\w on my system blocks UTF-8 valid characters like Russian once \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430 or Arabic \u0645\u062c\u0644\u062f \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f so maybe another solution is just to block files starting with a dot with /^[^\\.]/\n. Looks like PHP needs special regex flag for correct work with UTF-8. This flag is u, so I suggest default rule for checking valid name should be: /^\\w[\\w\\s\\.\\-]*$/u this will allow quiet normal file names, maybe we should add brackets to this rule []() as well?\n. \\p{Lang} is also good approach if you need specific language only or couple of them, but we are talking about default acceptedName for elFinder. I think my solution is okay for most cases and this thread can be very useful for other who hit this problem.\n. @wolfgangihloff than we have to write double side validation in case of acceptedName is regex, but what if acceptedName is a user-defined method which maybe queries a database, how we would test it without server-side validation?\n. This will require quiet a lot of small changes in the code and probably API for only a small convenience benefit.\nNot in 2.0 release, if you would like you can create another issue for a feature request for next versions\n. dox looks more interesting, If it is good we will be able to deploy it on github pages like api.elfinder.org\n. dox looks very promising but currently it's very poor in parsing tabbed comments and is broken in latest versions\n. I have tested both, and elFinder is not yet ready for jsdoc, need to review all the code to match jsdoc documentation style\n. If you have made a translation, please post new issue https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/new we will be glad to include it in relaease\n. \u0422\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0435\n.

Maybe in future #78\n2. Already supported by HTML5 and Drag & Drop, elFinder can be integrated with 3rd party software using plugins\n3. I'm not sure these views are needed (this is Explorer way probably but we are elFinder not elExplorer)\n4. There is callback functions using bind option in connector, see how logging is implemented https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/connector.php#L178, I know the docs are missing yet.\n5. elFinder build on jQuery UI styles and themes, you can use any of them or customize your own like here http://revaxarts-themes.com/whitelabel/fileexplorer.html\nThank for the suggestions, feedback is always welcome so we could knew what our users need and want!\n. Are using 1.x version or 2.x?\n. The 1.x version is a bit limited in internal mime type detect, I recommend to setup php finfo module and sure it work's right, and set mimeDetect => finfo\n. Thanks for the translation, but you don't need to use html codes here, use UTF-8 symbols direct in file.\nCan you correct this?\n. I'll close this ticket myself when I add it to the repository\n. This feature was suggest before, you are the second one who ask for this feature, probably it can be implemented using a plugin\n. We need ability or interface to paste any URL, and elFinder should download it.\n1. Catch ctrl+v and check it for URL (in case internal buffer is empty)\n2. In upload dialog with should have some textarea where use can paste urls and upload them\nAlso this feature need to be configurable, so we could disable all remote uploads\n. Thanks!\n. There is connector option\n// open this path on initial request instead of root path\n'startPath'       => ''\nYou can use it to get what you want. This feature is available in elFinder 2.x only\n. This is only a start directory somewhere under your root folder. You cannot set this variable directly in the link, but you can write a wrapper in your html/js which will parse your url and grab the path, than on elFinder init you can pass this variable using customData client option. And than in you connector.php you will get this variable in _GET/_POST/_REQUEST and corresponding on that set the startPath.\nI have a working example of similar task... probably we need to write a howto about that topic\n. This is connector option not a client one: https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php#L153\n. To summarize the discussion above:\nWe need and wiki example showing how to start elFinder with startPath in some dir, based on url option\n. to always init elFinder with startPath, you need to disable rememberLastDir in client options\n. Thanks a lot, I'll document this in wiki\ncan you please provide getQueryVariable js method ?\n. I mean autoresize on window size change or some callback, Idea is to change width and height without recreating elFinder\n. I know this is not good, but it will be a pain in the ass to change all the places in elfinder where it generates unique ids. Until this is not a major issue and you don't have any critical side effects of it I consider this issue as \"won't fix\".\nPlease reopen this issue if you found any major problem.\n. elFinder have all needed options to configure such behavior see onlyMimes option https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/js/elFinder.options.js#L190\nFor a start dir you see startPath connector option https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php#L53\nThis also should be documented\n. uploadAllow/Deny is a different - it only checks if file is allowed to upload. If you need special rules for uploading each filetype in different directory than you have to use accessControl option in connector, see https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/connector.php for example how it can be implemented.\n. \u0412\u044b\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0438 \u043e \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u044f \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e. \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0451\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\n. I'm not sure that I understand what you want. Do you want to get file path instead of file url on editor callback?\n. elFinder does not know anything about your domains or file structure. If you want to lock user in  $_SESSION['path'].'/content/media' than you need to set it as root.\nInstead of adding topDir it is better to do it in you callback function, elFinder will be more and more complex if we will implement such features, and actually this your custom situation. elFinder task is just to return path of file starting from root directory and that's all than you can do anything what you need with this path.\n. elFinder will not return anything upper than the root folder this is base security rule. Or maybe I didn't understand you correctly...\nif root dir is content/media and you have selected image/myimg.jpg there is no way to return content/media/image/myimg.jpg, client side (javascript) does not know anything about the root directory it operates with crypt hashes, and only connector can decrypt them. This is made for security reason\n. I have to check it twice, right now I haven't test it very wall. I must return image/myimg.jpg indeed\n. You have translated elfinder.LANG.js file itself, instead you should copy it to elfinder.nl.js a than translate it. Than use git add & git push to commit it. Can you please remake it or I'll have to add elfinder.nl.js manualy?\nAnd thanks for the translation!\n. invalid\n. Now it looks great! Thanks for the translation.\n. Maybe support for native PHP compression methods?\n. This must be added to Wiki, please help us\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Multiple-roots\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Simple-file-permissions-control\n. imdong,\n\"anonymous\" or \"user\" is that what you need to do yourself, what you have done is a right way also.\n. I assume this issue as fixed\n. Beta version (2.x) is work in progress right now, all docs are one the way, version 2.x has nothing to do with 1.x - it's a total rewrite of the software. All new docs will be published here on https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki, for more options and details you have to look through the code right now.\nThat is what beta difference from release. \n. Thanks a lot, I'll take look at database driver. This thread is useful and also a wiki page for database connector will be useful\n. This is no plans yet. This will be only after 2.0 stable release\n. This is server side sorting implemented in 2.x but it has nothing to do with sorting in list view, this sort is how connector sort files before sending json. That is not exactly what you want.\n. this commit should probably do the job and close this issue\n. case insensitive search works with latin but not with utf-8 cyrillic.\nLinux PHP 5.3, mbstring enabled\n. Setting these php settings, fixes the problem:\nmbstring.internal_encoding = UTF-8\nmbstring.func_overload = 2\n. This is kind of problematic as elFinder work with file system, then where do we have to keep this comments? I think there is no universal way and many of you would like to keep it in database.\nSo I don't a straight-forward solution for such feature\n. You idea is clear, but this feature should be optional. I think it is possible to implement without even editing elFinder's code only by extending it.\nIf someone like this idea please vote here.\n. I'm not sure, but maybe this method it not yet implemented or maybe this is a bug\n. If you are not familiar with github and you don't know how to make pull request you can just send us translation to dev@std42.ru\nAnyway thanks for the translation\n. Do you use beta version or latest master? This probably have been fixed already in master, also give us more info on your browser\n. And does this happens on demo? I'm using Chromium 12 and don't have this issue.\nTry the latest master version from git, we did some work on this issue already\n. Demo is newer than beta, but older than master, this mess probably will be until we release stable version\n. This is fixed in current master tree\n. Duplicate, see #100\n. works fine in Chrome\n. I already merged your translation to our tree\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commit/a5915ab23854e761ccb04ddeb7872e3929eabc29\n. can you post screenshot or some more details on this bug?\n. Can you please also check this on demo, does it happen there?\nWhat browser are you using?\nDoes this error happens with other browsers?\nWe need this info as we cannot detect the bug \n. I have uploaded 30 Kb file into test HTML edit folder on demo with the name Munin-PeterHost.html - I can edit it with no problem, please test\n. That is really strange. But what is actual encoding is in your file?\nLooks like your file had some broken characters, I have uploaded yab2-fixed.html files. What I have done is saved your file with UTF-8 encoding.\nI have to say that elFinder has to encode any file that you want to edit using JSON, this is when server sends data to client. JSON only supports utf-8 encoding. So any file you want to edit must be in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding, probably will work with other encodings but if you have some bogus symbols like in your's it will fail.\n. Okay I assume this is now clear, elFinder will work UTF-8 files, or files which contents can be encoded by php_json module with UTF-8 encoding\n. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a, \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 UTF-8 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c fork \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439. \u041f\u043e \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e.\n. What you mean? When client send's command to create tmb?\n. Yeah, now it works different from 1.x, the client itself sends request for connector to make tmb's for selected hashes, but if tmb alreay exists it will be send with open command.\nI cannot tell you more detailed info as I haven't implemented it myself\n. Oh thats great! I'll add it right now\n. Keybindings will not if elFinder is not in focus, e.g. you need to click somewhere inside elFinder to enable key bindings to work\n. Oh you said in Preview (I missed it)... Probably elFinder should not lose its' focus when opening preview... and back, tell us more if you find a reason\n.

If you look at all other translations they are made in pure UTF-8 and all works file\n. Because UTF-8 is a must for correct work of elFinder, that is why you do not need to fallback for compatibility. All other translations are in UTF-8.\nP.S.: and what the difference can be between windows and linux editing the same UTF-8 file?\n. Translations is made by humans for humans, so there is really no need in some \"codes\", just keep it simple. Maybe someone would like to improve your translation and will not be able to do the same way as you.\nSome other facts:\nI never heard of BOM problem in elRTE or elFinder\nYour translation will be the only one \"ugly\"\nImagine https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/js/i18n/elfinder.zh_CN.js this translation with encoded strings - it would be useless for normal human\nMany other products use normal utf-8 encoded translations without any problems\nSo there is really no need to encode it, believe me =)\n. Looks interesting, you should try to put it in git.\n``` php\n<?php\nprivate function open(){\n  //OPEN DIRECTORY ??? OR FILE TOO ???\n  // MAYBE dir only !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n  //init? tree? target?\n```\nYes open is used to open both file and directory, if this is directory, than we enter it and display contents, if this is a file we allow browser to download file using backend - this is very useful when files are not accessible from URL\n. Space is not a problem, the hardest part is to implement build-release mechanism in Jakefile, probably file name should be something like:\nelfinder-BRANCH-TIMESTAMP-HASH.tar.gz/.zip\nBRANCH = git name-rev --name-only HEAD\nTS_HASH = git log -1 --pretty=format:\"%at-%h\"\nWill result in elfinder-2.x-1315680840-3a992f2\n. elFinder 2.x will be ready when it's ready, It's true that about 100 bugs where fixed since beta but we are still changing api and sometimes break internal mechanism. Daily builds will be available only after release also rc1 is planned in a week.\n. I think we need more info and understanding how it can be implemented\n. Using fuse on regular hosting I think is not possible, but if you are using FUSE than you can handle almost any FS with elFinder\n. implemented\n. JSONP is useful because of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, example: client and connector can be on different servers or in multi-root configuration different roots can be on different servers/domains. JSONP should much more easier to implement and will require only a few changes\n. Probably this can should be made using build-in callbacks... so no real changes needed to elFinder\n. Idea is clear, it was requested for 1.x as well.\nIf you want to implement it your self the easiest way is to extend elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem class and rewrite _unlink function first.\nI'm not sure that we will implement that feature at all, it's not high priority\n. Another problem that we will need temporary storage for storing 'restore' locations of files/dirs, also if two files with the same name are deleted from different locations it will be hard to show and store on a local fs\n. see #1065 instead\n. Look though connector.php in 2.x branch there is example how you can implement logging\n. I think we need wiki example how to implement logging\n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Simple-logging-example this should be enough \n. This will be feature request for next version.\n. It's not possible yet and it is hardcoded, I really don't know that part of elFinder code so I cannot tell you.\nThis feature was already requested couple of times, so I assume this is high priority for next release\n. ctime is usually is not a file creation time in unix and it can depend on a file system.\n. Probably try set it to false\n. tmbPath set to '' or false disables thumbs creation at all\n. We should add check for this function, because this is not critical data. Is this the only problem when running with lower version of PHP? Can you give the info about which PHP version are you using.\n. I think we just need to test it with PHP 5.0.x and 5.1.x\n. The problem can be in https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php#L1893 when getting name or in json_encode, one more problem can be if files returned from file system have non-ASCII symbols and is not in UTF-8 encoding - then json_encode will not be able to encode it as i works only with UTF-8\n. This is probably workaround but not a solution, and we haven't found the root problem why PHP 5.1 couldn't encode your data\n. If so it looks like this is PHP problem, anyway if json_encode is not detected elFinder connector will tell you about that. PHP's json is usually included in in linux distros.\nI'll leave this ticket open until we have some more information.\n. I consider PHP 5.2 as minimum require version for elFinder now, patches for 5.0 and 5.1 are still welcome.\n. I suggest we need to review code with error_reporting(E_STRICT); ?\n. not confirmed with 5.3.6\n. Which PHP version are you using?\n. Can you please provide the full php.ini because we cannot figure out this problem in our testing environments\n. currently getting none errors and notices\n. Check that you have PHP 5.2 or newer\n. @malko can you please report exact error_reporting setting and exact error you got, also make sure you are using latest code from git, because I can't reproduce it locally and on our prod server\n. Please check the latest version\n. Changing PHP configurations is not an option, we need to refactor elFinderConnector so instead of exit/echo it just returned the data and headers.\nRegarding to your situation the problem is not because your application sent some headers, but that your application sent data, in which case it is not possible for elFinder to set needed headers and JSON would be broken. You can add your logic before connector.php but make sure it does not output any data otherwise elfinder client will not be able to parse it\n. If you would like to see thumbnails than you have to put them somewhere on a webdomain, like thumbs.mydomain.com/elfinder/thumbs/\n. Hm, what you are asking was implemented in 1.x version and option called fileURL, try to not set URL option in connector.\nIn 1.x it lead that all file transfers (even thumbs) were made through connector.\n. Sorry I give you wrong info that in 1.x it is possible.\nIf your thumbs are not available to public than you need to set tmbURL to some script which will serve thumbnail like my-thumbs.php?hash= or use a rewrite like you suggest to your script.\n. Not for 2.0 release for sure. As I said write own script which will serve thumbs thought PHP, that should be just 10-20 lines of code.\n. Write your own method which will validate the correctness of file name. Or maybe I do not understand you correctly?\n. Now I understand, we haven't predicted just behavior but I think it shouldn't be hard to implement, I'll ask Dmitry to review your request.\n.

What version of elFinder are you using? There was recent changes in resize a week ago\n. please use the latest 2.x branch version, lots of changes since beta version were made so maybe your problem is already fixed\n. I assume this issue is closed because no feedback or more details where introduced\n. You are free to write your own connector and we welcome it, but I think our team will not implement it on own powers, we are too limited in resources right now, so if you want FTP support start searching for people who also need it and collaborate\n. 2.x API docs are on the way, they will help a lot\n. I've merged your changes into 2.x branch\n. Thanks for pointing out, this is now fixed in proxy class https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commit/423700a5fb23d4cd4d5e129db4ff4f71f34c328f\n. This is connector bug, not elFinder UI, fixed https://github.com/Studio-42/elfinder-python/commit/42b653d6ed26e2bbe89e83a477121a791070e4dd\n. Already fixed, thanks for notice.\nWe are moving old elfinder and new elfinder website to a new server, so there could be some downtimes today and tomorrow\n. That is strange I thought this directory is in the git, It must be there with elfinder.html\n. Now I know about it :)\nI'll fix when I have time for elfinder\n. Right now there is only option in connector which controls to overwrite or not https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php#L192\n. This should be easy, you just have to write your own extension, the problem is that we do not documented the internal API\n. inactive\n. Thanks it fixes #153, sorry I had no time yet on elFinder to fix it.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for a great patch\n. Moved to wiki https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Using-custom-editor-to-edit-files-within-elfinder\n. API translated into english\n. Just write your own logic which will generate connector options based on currently logged in user in your system,\nJust set root to something like '/home/' . $USERNAME\n. If you wanna make it fast and dirty add you authentication logic into php/connector.php and generate home path based on username. That's all.\nelFinder itself will not handle users or authentication, it's a tool for developers and can be used in different ways. elFinder is not click-and-install software and not a plugin. Take the code, see the docs, modify and use it in your own way.\n. MySQL driver was broken after starting FTP driver =)\nyou can switch to this version before FTP merge\ngit checkout cd6a82f33e5de02866b6bc44501f5e5c5f1477b9\n. Please be patient, we would try to release new version of elFinder before a new year, it should be really easy to fix mysql driver, I really regret that we didn't have time for elFinder yet.\n. @dio-el-claire started working at MySQL driver, some progress already, I hope in few days it will be ready\n. Yes there is some progress, you can look at recent git history https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commits/2.x/ I hope in one week it will be fixed.\n.

This is already fixed in latest git version\n. for a quick and dirty workaround you can replace following line in elfinder.full.js:\n: file ? cwdOptions.path + (file.hash == cwd ? '' : cwdOptions.separator+file.name) : '';\nwith\n: file ? cwdOptions.path + (file.hash == cwd ? '' : '/'+file.name) : '';\n. then just use latest git version\n. You mean drag and drop files?\n. There is no way currently to disable it, but I'll leave this issue as feature request for next version\n. Please explain better, do you want to allow renaming only the file name without extension? So user could not rename the file?\n. That is already implemented see the demo http://elfinder.org/ take a little bit shorter file name so you could see the full name and press F2. It world like you say in Chrome at least\n. Okay now I see. I'm not sure that we are about to implement it, but you can easily extend the elFinderVolumeDriver class and redefine the rename function. I'll leave this issue as feature request.\n. Securing .php files is not elFinder task, and there is no straight way to secure from unwanted PHP, because there is a lot of possibilities in elFinder to upload/modify/create a .php file under root directory, the only true way is to disable PHP in root directory by your server config\n. There is no problem with this function it is designed so you could pass any custom data from client to connector\n. There is no option data in client, there is customData that will do what you want.\nSetting root using http query parameters is really bad idea from security point of view but any way you will need to use $_REQUEST['user'] instead otherwise upload function will not work as it uses POST instead of GET (maybe some other commands too)\n. Does it happen on demo? What version of elFinder and browser are you using?\n. Confirm remove is triggered before upload command, is it a bug or a feature?\nTODO we also need a list of possible handlers for documentation\n. Docs published https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-event-API\n. We are dropping any support for IE 6 and 7\n. There is no direct way to pass additional variables from client to connector in elFinder 1.x, but you can use for example PHP session to set and get some needed variables in connector\n. debug your code, check everything twice\n$userid = $_GET['userid'];\necho $userid;\n$root = '../../../self/profiles/'.$userid;\necho $root;\n...\n$opts = array(\n   'root' => $root,\n   'URL' => $url\n);\n. See the onlyMimes option in https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options\n. 1.x doesn't have such ability, it only can allow or disallow uploading certain types of files.\n. Where do you see an issue? That user can add <?php ...? This is not an issue as many people using elFinder to edit PHP files and other code files. You can disable processing .php file in server config\n. Thanks, now I get it!\n. It's not implemented yet, but I'll leave it as feature request for future release\n. 'path' => '//192.168.1.176/Share/',-- this should not work in linux, what you have written is windows specific only, in linux you will need first to mount the remote share to a local directory and typically only root can do this.\nThis is not elFinder issue for sure. Learn more how remote file systems work in linux.\n. Cannot reproduce with latest version, probably it was fixed\n. 30k files is very nice amount. elFinder was able to work fine with 6k files. But the problem comes also from browser side, creating 30k DOM elements is also not an easy task.\nI think even ls -al will lag on such amount.\nAny way right now I don't see any reasonable way to implement it, making elFinder 'paginatable' is not an option as it will break the concept of whole elFinder idea.\nFurther discussions are welcome.\n. That depends what kind of database structure you have, selecting 30k records from table is usually an easy task with good database design. And yes in DB you can use LIMIT statement but you cannot use such feature when you are reading local filesystem.\n. I'm hard to advise here... As I understood you use your own controller, that means if you implement such functionality in client as you described above we wouldn't be able to test it with default elFinder.\nIf you know what you are doing and you know how to implement it - you are welcome, you can just fork us. We would be happy to merge your changes if they really are useful for elFinder itself.\n. Not sure that I understand you... What you exactly want? Do you want to replace system dialog for selecting file on local system with elFinder... this is not possible.\n. Cannot reproduce this bug, can you test the latest version? Also report browser\nProbably we need a slow connection to catch it.\n. inactive\n. This is not elFinder task to know if FS is case sensitive or not, if FS is not case sensitive elFinder should also work correctly.\nOr you want elFinder to behave like it is working with case insensitive FS? - If so you will have to reimplement your own driver\n. This is not a bug, calculating entry directory size can be very intensive work if you have lot of files or directories. That can make connector almost unresponsive. This feature should be optional and async from connector work.\n. displays - now by default in list view\n. This should be easy to implement using accessControl need to documentate\n. True, this behavior is weird, clicking on file file try after search should behave the same as ESC key or clicking x\n. Can you please test it with latest version or on demo http://elfinder.org ?\n. @rivulent please check if it works now on windows, because I have nowhere to test it.\n. Beta version is outdated and mysql driver was significantly rewritten since than. So you better use current git version. Make sure you have created table with proper name and structure as in MySQLStorage.sql file. Are you able to create directories and files using database driver?\n. I've just pushed the changes to https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/MySQLStorage.sql file, please create database table. You will be able to see the files, I'm not sure if upload will work thought.\nMySQL Driver is not stable yet\n. Upload is also working after new creating new tables\n. Per user file permissions is possible to implement in DB driver, there are many ways to do it, one and simple solution is to use permission and to allow user seeing files only in folder /username - but be haven't test it yet.\nProbably in future we will develop an example how to store file ownership in separate table without modifying elFinder's source. We have more things to do by now\n. The same happens after upload the file can be selected beyond visible area, and should scroll to this position\n. Thanks for pull requests\n. Fixed in latest version\n. Please update @version on string 4 to current date, this is useful to track files for translators. Only a few translators know how to use git =)\n. Are you creating elFinder and jquery ui dialog on the same element? - I'm not sure this is great idea. And I'm not sure if elFinder will correctly handle the situation when it is created on a hidden element, it's not tested yet.\nI'll recommended you to use elFinder own dialog mode $('<div/>').dialogelfinder(opts)\n. Probably you are right, this code buggy in 1.x, I'll figure it\n. There is a problem but your example fixes nothing, there is lot bigger problem\n. And it shouldn't. Options upload* talks for itself - it is related to upload only, if you concerned about security reason like not to allow user uploading and/or creating/renaming .php files, then this is a wrong way of doing security. elFinder gives a lot of abilities to manage file system and if you want to be 100% safe that user will not run php code - is to completely disable PHP in certain directory.\n. We have wait until user selects a folder where to download file?\n. Thanks for great explanation! We will think about how to correctly fix this situation.\nYour help is very welcome!\n. I've merged your changes to separate branch image_rotate, connector part looks fine but UI need changes.\n. Do I understand you correctly - You want to open an alternative URL when downloading file from elFinder?\n. I think this is a very custom mod which is not main goal of elFinder, SQL is not the only driver think about how to implement it with local filesystem and FTP driver?\nYou can customise elFinder as you like, especially SQL driver but our main goal and idea of elFinder is to make work with file system as simple as it can be and not to create universal app for anything you may need. Sorry I have to decline this request.\n. Yeah that would be great to have such support in future, we already have some reserved methods to implement it, also we could start from easier JSONP (refs #122)\n. Implementing WebSockets on client side is not a problem, but current PHP connector can be a problem. Is there some PHP server side WebSockets implementation?\nIf we had nodejs connector than bringing WebSockets will be easier\n. Closed due to inactivity\n. That would be really nice if you could test running two or more instances of elFinder. We have tested such ability only during development and probably missed something\n. Many thanks!\n. The code looks better now. But I'm aware of using 3rd party lib jQueryRotate for preview. I'll see what we can do with CSS3 and rotate property.\n. @667bdrm found a CSS3 solution http://jsfiddle.net/22Feh/5/ I thing we should try to integrate it\n. replaced with #228\n. replaced with #228\n. that is already fixed in latest git version\n. After debates this functional considered invalid\n. merged your pull request into image_rotate branch - now it looks better, works fine in FireFox, got error in Chrome\nresize.js:602 Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined\nCan you make next pull request to image_rotate branch ?\n. pull image_rotate branch \n. Please next time when you commit, add refs #229 to commit message\nDiscuss here #229\n. @nao-pon I like your changes, merged into image_rotate\n. Opera is always special http://youtu.be/bsCl6WuC914 is it easy to disable rotate animation in opera?\n. I've test in Opera 11.61 mac os x, now it's okay.\n. I think now it's ready to merge with 2.x maybe we need to rename Resize image into Edit image ;) ?\n. Thanks everybody for great work!\n. Great! Big thanks for your work and time, I'll test it for 1-2 days and then merge to 2.x if no bugs found, refs #229\n. This must be in connector itself, by default we do not show .tmb folder and this folder also should be hidden by default.\n. Great example! This really should be in our wiki, can you create a page and put it there? I would like to keep connector.minimal.php really minimal and simple because this file will by default when you download elFinder and I want users not to be afraid of many many options elFinder have.\n. Sorry I didn't saw you edited php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php\nI think what you have done is possible to make using bind option triggered on upload command. It would be great if you can implement using bind, see Simple logging example.\nThat is actually why we designed this bind option so anybody could hook in 'after command' chain without modifying main code.\n.

It would be great if you can implement using bind, see Simple logging example.\nThat is actually why we designed this bind option so anybody could hook in 'after command' chain without modifying main code.\n. I'm closing this PR as it can be implemented using built-in methods\n. You guys decided to make \"awesome rotation\" ;)\n. Also consider contacting the person who made Joomla module, generally we can help you only if you use latest version from git and standalone.\n. Wiki docs are not complete, for complete list of elFinder connector options see the code https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php\n. Make sure your php configuration do not pollute output with warnings and notices, because client requires valid JSON output only.\n. com_elfinder is not related to elFinder project and probably this code is of something you call K2 (what is that at all?)\n. This not support forum, this is developer issue tracker where bugs are reported, use forum instead. Btw you provided no information for helping you, no info about your connector/client options, urls, connector response.\nMake sure you use latest version from git branch 2.x. Beta version is outdated and more than 300 bugs where fixed since beta version.\n. That looks very interesting, this feature was planned for 2.1 release #81.\nI'm sorry but I'll not include this patch until 2.1 release, maybe I can start 2.1 branch for it. I'll discuss your patch with @dio-el-claire and we will decide what to do.\n. @nao-pon did you get my message about to become elFinder team developer? Can you send me your email at trx(at)std42.ru?\n. @nao-pon I was thinking... is it possible to implement the same image editing using our custom editor setting? One of users asked for another image editor support #330. Writing plugin for each one can be hard, so we better implement custom editor api.\nWhat do you think?\n. Have you tried to build elFinder? Actually the code should be wrapped when build, take a look at\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/Jakefile.js#L162\nTry to build and see if it will work the way you need\n. If you are familiar with Java you can write ant build task for elFinder and build using yui compressor (the compressor we used for elFinder 1.x), with google closure compiler we had some issues.\n. Make sure you are using latest version from git\n. Confirm with imagick and gd, 'tmbBgColor' => 'transparent' has no effect\n. 'tmbBgColor' => '#ff0000' - also returns black background\n. imagick works fine with transparent, gd still have issues\n. replied you at forum, this is bug tracker and not general discussion places\n. Can you please send pull request?\n. Do you hit this issue when downloading though connector? Can you give some more info? Maybe check md5 of files on server and after download on local computer. Does it happen with other files?\nProbably you can have such issue if you have php closing tag ?> + new line in connector.php file\n. That is interesting! Tell me are you using connector to download files, e.g you didn't set URL option in connector root? Also tell me what web server are you using, which PHP version and OS.\n. What are doing is absolutely wrong, probably you are running on windows, and elFinder doesn't know anything about windows and it's network shares on it. It only understands plain file system without any user authorization. Probably as workaround you need to attach your remote share as local drive (with map network share or something similar).\nI'm really surprised that works at all! There was already similar question #180.\nMaybe if this works your know and can write your own wrapper to authenticate against windows share from php, but I even don't get the idea is to posible to implement at all.\n. It was in the code but I removed it, that really hides errors instead of showing them or at least making a way to detect them. This is not good for code quality. Anyway you are free to add such code in your connector.php \n. Send a pull request please\n. I'm not sure about your path option, try to set it to something like '.' or '..' and see if it will work. Path in FTP driver is set based on ftp user root path which is usually user home dir and you don't have access outside this dir\n. elFinder currently does not support all FTP servers, there is related topic in Russian http://elrte.org/redmine/boards/1/topics/4203\n. Closed due to inactivity\n. About your first pull request, but why do commands need to be disabled for all instances?\nDisabled commands are per instance and must be per instance, or I don't get your idea?\nJust set per instance commands you need https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#wiki-commands\n. About your second patch, what you are doing is a little bit wrong way for elFinder and this e.stopImmediatePropagation(); as I remember is needed for drag & drop support in some browsers.\nTo bind an event in elFinder use next code in client init code:\njavascript\nhandlers : {\n  select : function(e) {\n    console.log(e.data.selected)\n  }\n},\ndebug : true\ndebug will show you all events\n. The wiki link you refer is related to elFinder 1.x only and not 2.x.\nTo disable command in client refer https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#wiki-commands\nAlso your patch against client, but link is about connector, there is also a way to disable commands in connector, but it's not documented yet.\nIf there is really a problem with per instance disabled commands please provide a test (you can do it in separate branch)\n. Option 1:\nYou can disable commands by setting only allowed commands: [...] in client.\nOption 2:\ndisabled option in connector is available as root option and also should work. But it's not been tested well. \n. Btw I like your code but it also can be done without editing elFinder's code. I've added en example https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#wiki-commands\n. Thanks!\n. The basic scenario - you take one of the commands/buttons from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/tree/2.x/js/commands and redefine it or add your own based on them. extending connector is also not a hard task, just inherit and extend the base classes\n. Thanks, added to wiki https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Custom-context-menu-command\n. We had problems with closure before, referring elfinder.full.js is useless because it's different every commit and probably if you got full script than you don't have problems with using node's uglify-js for compressing which is your default way. Feel free to pull request if you have a solution. For warnings above\n. Can you please send pull request or send this translation to dev@std42.ru\n. I think there shouldn't be a separate rule for thumbnails dir, it should just follow default rules, than we will also need a separate setting for quarantine directory. Also there should be an option to show thumbnails directory.\n. So I assume using standart access or attributes to show/hide what you need\n. Do you mean to cancel current file selection?\nMaybe pressing arrow up/down or left/right will cancel it.\n. Are you using elFinder on some touch device?\n. I'm afraid I can't help you with this, elFinder were never tested on any mobile platform and it's not planned yet.\n. Not yet, we will probably need to rewrite whole gui to get better support on mobile devices\n. Check you permissions that PHP can create directories\n. Probably there is some your server issue that prevents elFinder from creating directories, the most common problem is that your PHP instance does not allow to create files. Make a simple php file with mkdir() and test if you can create folders under the same path as elFinder\n. Probably you are right, I hit some very similar bug. Can you tell what exactly problem it fixes so I can test?\n. you get the object file, you can show user popup for example where he will select what exactly he want to select thumbnail or image, if you want option in context menu - you have to hack it yourself\n. You can define other size for generated thumbnails https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-tmbSize\n. Which PHP version are you using? Make sure any magic quotes are switched off, also under which OS this happens?\n. no response\n. Looks really great and promising, I'll think about how to handle dropbox-php library separate from elFinder\n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-startPath\n. There cannot be such option by design, but you can define customData during ui init which will be passed to connector, and than in connector you can use this option to set startPath\n. take a look on that discussion #83\n. Can you please provide an working example with bug or screenshot at least?\n. Can you please provide an working example with bug or screenshot at least?\n. Give us more info, what version are you using, how many files, folders you have, your OS/environment and PHP version\n. I'm not sure that this is an elFinder issue, even if it is you have to find this bug yourself. We never catch such behaviour during development and maybe this is related to your environment only, I would be great if you could test on other server. Reply here if could discover more info.\n. There is not straight way right now, elFinder UI is not yet flexible for extensions, this is a big work for next major releases.\n. thanks! feel free to update wiki https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Custom-context-menu-command\n. We did this before in version 1.x, but we had negative experience about it, bug reports against full version are useless, because developers never deal with full version. Customising full version is also a bad idea because you will not be able to update your code and keep in sync with latest changes. The only way to get full version is to build it yourself using jake https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Build-and-compress-elfinder-from-source. Also the true way to modify elFinder is to overlay prototypes, for example you can redefine some dialog, for this you can use the file from source (git) as a base one and include it after elfinder.min and before you init it.\n. elfinder.full.js is a mess to understand the code and nodejs 0.6+ should work on windows just fine, If you really want drop a PM on github or a note to dev@std42.ru I can send you latest full.js version\n. Can you please test it on your demo http://elfinder.org if you can upload/create chinese filenames there that probably is wrong with your environment and it doesn't handle UTF-8\n. Can you please also update the date in the header?\n. Check validName connector option and make sure it suites your needs. Try to upload file with simple name like test.txt and make sure it works.\n. Which OS are you running? Just interested...\n. As I know IE do not support multiple files download at all, in FF there is a hook which tries to hold download iframe open for some time, this is needed when FF displays dialog for saving files refs #215\nI have tested downloading 4 files on http://elfinder.org with Firefox 12 and no problem accrued all 4 files where downloaded? Can you please test it there too?\n. We use an embedded forum which uses freemium http://tal.ki/ service. Probably there are some issues from your side with cookies so you couldn't login. Because users do post everyday.\nThis is not best solution but I'm quiet happy with it because it does not require admin overhead. If you know some other solutions for hosted/embedded forum I would like to look at them. Probably as alternative I'm thinking of google group.\n. use StackOverflow for general question on elfinder\n. What OS are you using? and what system locale does it use? The problem as I see is that your file system is not using utf-8. The one secret for me which still unclear - which filesystem encoding is using windows? As I understand it uses Unicode 16 which is somehow compatible with UTF-8?\n. We are not planning to implement other than utf-8 encoding (maybe utf-16 in future), implementing others can be tricky and buggy.\n. Btw php/elFinderConnector.class.php is given as example and you can simply reimplement it with iconv inside\n. Give us full example how you configure connector, try to set absolute root path option. Also make sure your web user can access your files\n. Try removing accessControl string, also what OS/WebServer are you using? Can you create files/directories and upload files?\n. Probably this is encoding issue, elFinder works only with utf-8 file system. There is probably no solution until your files system is utf-8, can you please post the connector output?\n. Can you please send us json output of connector when you rename? You can do it with Chrome/Safari Inspector or FireBug for Firefox\n. Can you please download latest git version and check if it happens there? Maybe you have some special name with uncommon characters?\n. Not confirmed, I have no problems downloading files from demo on http://elfinder.org \n. Confirm! Happens in Safari only, Chrome is OK. Any file with space or non ascii symbol downloaded as connector\n@nao-pon can you please check it https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/php/elFinder.class.php#L656 ?\n. Thanks works fine now for Safari 5.1/6\n. Sounds strange, there was such bug in beta version but was fixed in rc1, and now I cannot reproduce it on demo page in Chrome 19\n. http://jsbin.com/otedag#preview here is a working example of elRTE + elFinder. \nFirst make sure standalone elFinder is working fine than combine with elrte\n. Hello, I've seen your email and this pull request. I like idea of unit tests for elFinder but I need to say nobody in our team have ever used PHPUnit, and I hardly understand what you are trying to test. Also PHP code looks very cozy to me and as I understand this intends to run elFinder in browser and test some basic user behaviour? If it is so it's definitely not we want to.\nAlso PHP is secondary importance language in elFinder, so any build/test code should be written in javascript/nodejs, like your build system.\nIf someday we would like to write tests for elFinder, they would test first our json API because PHP is only one of many other connectors. I have no idea how we would test js ui, but we probably take a look how it's done in jquery and other major js projects.\nCurrently we don't have time and manpower to write and maintain unit tests so I can't pull your request.\n. It's a hard question, because we never used unit testing, so we lived and programmed for many year without it and I don't think we will just start doing it. In total our team spent not more than 10 man hours a week working on elFinder, and there is a lot of more important things to do from our view and we are absolutely not ready to implement it our self.\nIf you have interest, want write and maintain unit test code that is great and we can cooperate this way, but if this is one time commit I don't see any profit for elFinder\n. Thanks, I'll include it in next release\n. Have you fixed your problem?\n. Check https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-acceptedName option you can just set it to null do disable the filename check\n. not confirmed on demo, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDTzSKfa_90\nby default drag and drop is doing move, if you want to copy by drag and drop you need to keep command/control key pressed, the green plus icon will show up.\n. Hah, now I see the problem, so it's happening when dragging from tree to working area, we will try to fix this asap. There is no general option to disable drag and drop in elfinder but you can set copyFrom and copyTo options to false for both root paths, more info https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-copyFrom\nThanks for video report, It makes much more clear\n. About upload study the wiki https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-uploadAllow\nYou can set almost any rules using file permission https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Simple-file-permissions-control\nIf this not enough you can implement your own permission control class using accessControl option\n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-tmbSize, maybe you will have to edit css to handle bigger size.\n. You are using connector options in client, tmbSize and tmbBgColor need to be set in your connector.php\n. after you change tmbSize you will need to delete existing .tmb/* so finder could regenerate new ones\n. There is no problem about sending utf-8 files without bom, just configure your web server to send correct header encoding. Also BOM is kind of silly hack, application should be able to determinate encoding automatically, in case of your Chrome example it's just question about default encoding in your browser locale.\nThis is not a problem at all, elFinder assumes UTF-8 by default. Also you could just add <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> into your html file and if it will work\n. You can play around with mineDetect option in connector, you have to set it to finfo or mime_content_type and make sure it is working correctly (e.g. PHP info module is installed). This way elFinder will be able to determinate that your files without extensions are images.\n. Need more info on this, we have tested elFinder with 5-6k of files in one directory and it worked 'normal'. In any way please give us more details, how long does it take for connector to reply or you are facing in browser, your connector settings, server hardware, how long does it take ls -al in your directory.\n. Check your acceptedName, probably your php version do not handle correctly utf-8 regexp flag, that is common for win, osx installations.\nOn our demo it works fine\n. so the slow down is not on the 1000 files but directories, this probably can be an issue, also as I understand this is client problem and not connector\n. if it's still critically long render times for you, consider using elFinder without tree as you described above and you can enable latest added option uiOptions : { cwd : { oldSchool: true } } which will add .. directory into working directory for after access to parent directories\n. Thanks, I'll include it in next release\n. I thought it was fixed in #246, was the solution in 35653b20dffbdcfca397fe21bc59e2c35c83cee4 wrong? \n. http://jsbin.com/ifuhih/7/edit#preview - can you please reproduce the problem here?\n. I've updated the demo to latest git version, looks like you are right\nNow the wrong position is seen on the demo http://jsbin.com/ifuhih/7/edit#preview\n. send us a pull request\n. Sorry but we don't have time to support 3rd party software, I looked over avinary docs and looks like it requires some api key and save function requires post url, which only will be available in elFinder 2.1.\nYou probably can easily load the image into their editor, but you will not be able to save it back to elfinder until you use 2.1 branch. Your request is not 5 minutes task so I cannot help you, but I would love to publish working example in our wiki if you got success\n. related foxel/elFinder@6d6dffe6d8138e280da77198eac244ba4a47cf9e\n. Partly done, now need to update jakefile\n. Pyhton connector is another implementation separate from PHP and have own github project. Python 1.x connector is very similar to PHP 1.x connector in options but is different. There would not be similar option in PHP because PHP has it's own internal upload module\n. api must be set from connector response, according to connector\n. \u041f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043c\u044b \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 2.0 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043c, \u0430 \u0432 2.1 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0435\u043c \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u043c\u0438, \u041f\u043e \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0438 \u0432 elFinder \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435, \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 jquery ui.\nrefs #331\n.

Looks good, I think we should follow this way\n. As temporary workaround hack you can place root options with startPath first in $opts, this is not a solution... we will see what we can do.\nPerhaps we will need another additional option like startRoot to select which root to open on init\n. about git: you should provide pull request from separate branches with one branch per pull request - that is github style workflow\nabout patch... I'm not sure... need Dio's advise\n. Probably not but it should be easy to implement. As I understand you want to set root something deeper like inner folder?\n. Closed due to inactivity\n. And that is correct please read the doc https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-alias\n. You also need to disable rememberLastDir option otherwise elFinder will open previous path\n. As I see there is already 4 elfinder packages http://packagist.org/search/?q=elfinder. We don't use composer or packagist, so I can't say anything about them.\nAlso I don't see how you would build elfinder in composer?\nTo use elFinder in production it is recommended to use minified version, not the development source.\nIn any case it would be great if you maintain the fork with composer specific includes/patches. We don't have much time for elFinder itself, not even thinking about supporting 3rd party libs/integrations\n. \u041c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e-\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0438 composer'\u043e\u043c, \u043d\u0438 packagist'\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 PHP (\u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430), \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043c\u044b \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0443\u0434 \u043a php.\n\u042f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c packagist \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044f \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 composer.json \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043b. \u0410 \u0432\u044b\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u043f\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442 master \u0432\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f\n. \u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 composer \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e php/ \u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u0430\u043b\u044b \u043a\u0430\u043a connector.php \u0438 connector.minimal.php \u043f\u043e \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b\n.

Are you using latest elFinder version from git? This bug has been fixed, please update\n. use the defaults option https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-defaults, or you you can also use 'pattern' => '/.*/'\n. You can rotate image using resize function\n. Closed due to inactivity\n. elFinder is PHP application - so after each request all memory used by PHP if flushed and there is nothing to do with garbage in memory, GC is not a task for any PHP application. In any case elFinder is limited to PHP memory limit which is usual 16-64 Mb of ram. You probably facing some server misconfiguration - I would recommend using php-fpm with nginx or apache-worker over fastcgi (not using ugly mod_php)\n. I'm not sure that I understand what you need. But I guess client event API is what you looking for https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-event-API, you can trigger any custom method on almost any event\n. Closed due to inactivity\n. Make sure you use latest elfinder version from 2.x git branch, 2.0-rc1 will not work with jquery 1.8\n. The git version does not have elfinder.min.js file - you have to build it yourself https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Build-and-compress-elfinder-from-source\nor use full inclusion on libraries like in this file https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.x/elfinder.src.html\nIn any case I would recommend you to use jquery 1.7 with elFinder 2.0-rc1 untill we release next version. In other apps you will probably not get any regression from using jquery 1.7 instead of 1.8\n. I can't say anything about tinymce integration but looks like problem with it. When I try to run example/index.html and open image insert dialog I get in Chrome Inspector:\n\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'apply' of undefined image.js:8\n\nWhen I try to run just elFinder from jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/elfinder/elfinder.html I get:\n\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'EditorManager' of null tiny_mce_popup.js:5\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'add' of undefined elfinder.html:55\n\nremoving tiny_mce_popup.js and tinyMCEPopup.onInit.add code I'm able to run elFinder.\nI don't see any problem with elFinder especially if you can run standalone version of elFinder.\n. One user on forum reported that version 3.4.3.2 worked for him.\nI would recommend you to scan the changelog of TinyMCE to see if they have changed popup behaviour.\nOr contact their forum, It would be great to have jsbin elfinder + tinymce working example like we do have for elRTE http://jsbin.com/otedag/1/edit\n. You have to setup CSRF manually in elFinder setting customData in client\n. I don't know about Security.php and CodeIgniter at all so I can't say what side effects you can have, you better ask this on CI forums/community\n. I don't know about CI, but Rails sets csrf token using meta tags, so it can be easily grabbed using jQuery, take a look at that example: https://github.com/phallstrom/el_finder-rails-example/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js \u2014 I found it more elegant and right way to do it\n.

That sounds as good idea but there are no plans for it right now, you can implement your own simple caching by overwriting _dimensions method in connector\n. It's not designed to filter files on the client side, you should do it in connector. using customData you can pass your own settings/values to connector and configure connector to filter files based on your settings.\n. I'm not sure if this is still an issue, feel free to reopen if it is\n. maybe you can different version of rar or unrar utility installed, elFinder supports unix version of rar, for windows you might need to tweak archivers connector configuration options.\n. added to wiki\n. check your phpinfo() for the right size of max allowed upload size.\n. fixed\n.

Demo page used nginx, it's easy to configure nginx to run php only on selected files e.g. connector.php. Try to google for more examples.\n. the right way to do this is bind configuration option\n. files are downloaded directly bypassing connector\n. Since read-only is connector option, i think you can overwrite archive methods in connector and save archive in some other directories. But implementing such option for client is not a priority\n. what do you suggest by metadata for media files?\n. we had ended support for 1.x\n. not related to elfinder directly, contact grails connector author\n. I don't think we need such functionality \n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Custom-context-menu-command\n. try flysystem with http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/adapter/azure/\n. there is already Italian translation, thanks\n. there are currently no plans for official SFTP driver, but you can try using https://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver\n. There are no plans to support one, search github for possible solutions\n. I think we will keep only front-end (js/css) for bower distribution, refs #1354\n. elfinder wasn't created for that, it would require some heavy modifications, not suggested for the core package\n. I guess our S3 code is old and doesn't work anymore. Would be nice if someone could update current codebase or replace it with working one, otherwise I'd suggest removing S3 support from core package as unmaintained.\n@nao-pon fyi\n. @barryvdh that what I suggest I'm sure there are good maintained S3 implementations, so we should probably drop our driver for S3 in favour of flysystem\n. I'll update the docs to make sure they match\n. @paulcanning can you tell if https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Integration-with-Codeigniter is different for CI3? Update to the wiki is welcome\n. see #1015 \n. I'm not sure there is easy trick to do it, elfinder header in list view is <thead> and files are in <tbody> if you can fix position of thead probably you will get what you want. There are some hacks for this like https://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/\n. yes, I was thinking about it... when you release new version you tag it as 2.1.x on 2.1 branch, I think it would be good if you also create tag 2.1.x-src on the 2.1-src branch.\n. moved to #1361 \n. I'm not sure, since we are not pushing our project to npmjs.org maybe we can omit version...\n. removing version doesn't hurt npm, so I removed it, if you merge it I'll update docs\n. close reason: not directly related to official connector\n. Currently elFinder has integration with https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem this is best option so far. You can try to search ownCloud implementation for flysystem or write own.\n. I'll check myself on it. I used bower in angular projects with node and rails backends, so bower is mostly used for front-end components, node server packages usually installed with npm, and front-end with bower, so I think we should remove php from bower.\nAbout version I'm not totally sure, bower should be able to use git tags as version, but I'll check it. Maybe we will generate it on jake build.\nAlso I think bower.json is only needed in 2.0 and 2.1 branches, we don't need bower.json (and composer.json) in any other, for development users must use git clone.\nBower and Composer are distribution systems we should only deliver ready built versions with it and not src, nobody wants to download src version of jquery to use it on the site.\n. From bower.io site:\n\nBower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesn\u2019t concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.\n\nSo I'll definitely get rid of php/ in bower.json\n. @lianee I'm not agree because there are different connectors as well, people who do not use PHP do not need it, and bower used with different languages as well like ruby/node/python. If you use PHP I consider you should use composer elfinder package instead, it will come with both PHP and JS parts\n. @lianee thanks for your feedback, I'll make more research on it, but I believe distributing php with bower is considered a bad practise, and possibly can be security issue because usually bower_components folder is open to the web.\n. @BSalah, @nikosites check connector.php output in Inspector/Firebug, there are too little details to help you\n. Sorry, I thought it's obvious, added a note to wiki Install\n. Also it will mean we have to parse output of different archivers in order to get current progress and I'm not sure it's easy and right task. Also additional problem that we will have to write current progress state into some temporary file, so status pull request could read from it.\nThere are no yet plans to implement it\n. elFinder uses jQuery UI, so it's responsive as jQuery UI is. About mobile friendly... it's likely another feature. There are no plans for it yet.\n. This really can depend on FTP server you use, driver should work with most unix ftp server, backslash in the file name... probably you are using windows ftp server which may need some hacks if it doesn't support MLST and MLSD commands.\n. Not totally sure but I think it's the problem with z-index of context menu, probably bootstrap model z-index. Try setting css:\ncss\n.elfinder .elfinder-contextmenu,\n.elfinder .elfinder-contextmenu-sub {\n  z-index: 1100; /* value higher than bootstrap modal, I think it's 1040 by default */\n}\n. Generally elFinder uses base64 to encode file paths, it also prepends root number with elf_l{root number usually 1}_{base64 of directory path} if you know the path you can generate link to it\n. closed due to inactivity\n. @nao-pon if I press upload icon in toolbar it opens system OS dialog to select files to upload, but if I right click in workzone and select Upload files it opens elfinder dialog, I think toolbar should also open elfinder upload dialog. Can you please check it?\n. I'm not sure I understand what you mean, does it happens on demo? Can you please attach screenshot, also browser you are using\n. Looks strange... I don't have this issue and it works for me on demo, are you using touchscreen to interact with elfinder?\n. @MG73 as nao-pon said thumbnails will be created on the server where connector.php is located, so /tmb probably will not work try to specify different directory where your web document root is located usually /var/www/... or /home/user/... depends on your web server configuration\n. That is not something that depends on elfinder, elfinder uses mtime of stat() to get last modification time http://php.net/manual/en/function.stat.php. When you upload a file it is actually created on the server, so creation time (and last modification mtime) is time when it was uploaded and not when file was created on your computer.\nIt's general filesystem design and we're not going to break it.\n. use uiOptions:\nuiOptions: {\n  toolbar: [\n    ['back', ...]\n  ]\n}\nExample: http://jsbin.com/boqeho/9/edit?html,output\n. @nao-pon can you make these checkboxes optional?\n. Please update to latest version 2.1.12, we do not support older versions.\nAlso check your connector output there might be some warning preventing ui update.\n. there is example http://jsbin.com/boqeho/22/edit?html,output but it uses latest connector, UI is from 2.1.0.\nCan you show connector output after creating new folder?\n. Doesn't work for me too, looks like something wrong with edit commandsOptions. load function is not fired at all.\nHere is my example http://jsbin.com/boqeho/11/edit?html,js,output\n. @nao-pon I also think that we should pass mimeType as second argument to load function - it could be useful for initalizing external editor, in case of CodeMirror it could help to load correct file syntax.\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/516b745c831e3d56d9af2233acf967498fbcf642/js/commands/edit.js#L118\n. @nao-pon thanks, now it works for me too.\n@MG73 here is finaly full working example http://jsbin.com/boqeho/14/edit?html,js,output\njavascript\n$('#elfinder').elfinder({\n  url: '//connector-elfinder.rhcloud.com/php/connector.minimal.php',\n  // use CodeMirror as external editor\n  commandsOptions: {\n    edit: {\n      //mimes: [],\n      editors: [{\n        mimes: ['text/plain', 'text/html', 'text/javascript'],\n        load: function(textarea) {\n          var mimeType = this.file.mime;\n          return CodeMirror.fromTextArea(textarea, {\n            mode: mimeType,\n            lineNumbers: true,\n            indentUnit: 4\n          });\n        },\n        save: function(textarea, editor) {\n          $(textarea).val(editor.getValue());\n        }\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n});\n. added to the wiki https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Using-custom-editor-to-edit-files-within-elfinder#codemirror-3\n. @nao-pon I think we should extract MsSQL driver into separate repository, and put in readme that it needs maintainer, I'll create issue\n. Here is working example with PHP code, you need to include clike.js mode for codemirror http://codemirror.net/mode/php/\n\nSimple HTML/PHP mode based on the C-like mode. Depends on XML, JavaScript, CSS, HTMLMixed, and C-like modes.\n\nFrom elFinder side you need to make sure mime-type is correctly detected, use inspector/firebug to check connector output.\n\nExample: http://jsbin.com/boqeho/18/edit?html,js,output\n@MG73 hint and anything else this is out of elFinder scope, please read the docs and source code of codemirror to understand how it works, or ask about codemirror on stackoverflow.\n. Can't check since I don't have iPhone, but it probably can be true since I phone doesn't have direct access to file system so probably filename isn't passed. What was the the filename?\n. dialog is height: auto; so you need to adjust you content editor height. you can do it with css too\ncss\n.elfinder-file-edit {\n  height: 800px;\n}\n. This is good idea and I know node is getting more popular lately, however we don't have any plans for writing node connector on our own, there are a lot of community connectors for asp/python/ruby and others, so all the hope is on community.\n. Sure it's API doc https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.0 see commands list the minimum required I believe are first five open, tree, file, parents, ls if you implement these five commands on your backend it elFinder client should start working with limited functionality\n. if you're using git version you need to build elfidner first\n. (10 seconds) * (number of file to download) for mozilla to wait before removing iframe? I think it is too long. Have you test it?\n. What does this fix?\n. catch(Exception $e) is a bad practice, please catch exact error. \n. ",
    "wolfgangihloff": "I still see places on my installation, also I do not see any option to disable this shortcut functionality given by places.\n. So I see the commit in the elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php which is great, but should not the javascript already try to validate the same way, thus that the error comes up before trying to store?\n. Well could the java script not be provided with a regex on start? As to the DB queries, that sounds far fetched as such implementation is not there in elfinder as of now or is there? I totally agree that the client side validation is unreliable but it serves as a first sanity check and provides faster feedback, before files are actually posted to the server.\n. what would you mean with that? which callbacks are available, as my approach with the .named folder seems to get me into lots of changes necessary.\nI guess what could work:\n- use folder without .name\n- do not hide it\n- change the rm function to cp/move files there before deletion\n- make ui not allow for delte when in trash folder\n. for same name, my resolution is to name the second deleted one with a time stamp at the end, for the restore location, I do not store that, so you have to manually drag and drop it back into the correct place\n. Can you point me on where to do it manually?\n. I had to touch a few files:\nhttps://github.com/wolfgangihloff/elFinder/commit/636e9b79f2070f7b3a0feaa593ef9c3b4b3370fb\nAlso my implementation with ctime is not valid I guess, I would need to store the creation time on db or something to make it right and stick.\n. I see that the names values is not filled for any of the array on browser json object files/0.... Otherwise all seems fine. Where should I put debug statements to find out why the names values do not get filled?\n. On php 5.1 this fixed the issue for me using the JSON.inc from here http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=198:\nphp\n<?php\n        if(version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '5.2.0') >= 0) {\n          exit(json_encode($data));\n        } else {\n          require_once (\"$inc_path/JSON.inc\");\n          exit(encode_json($data));\n        }\n. Well in php 5.1.6 json is not included and  you compile it in, a friend of mine said that the json_decode function return different value in 5.1.6 than in 5.2 and it ate the parent/hash value.\n. I nailed the problem further down, it seems only the name field does not get populated. However all other parts of the array are present. Then the error I see is the parent missing. I installed elfinder 2.0 standalone on the server with php 5.1 and all works in that setup.\n. But that would always make the thumbsnails accessible by public, that goes against the idea of having private data. As I see it the thumbnails would need to be hashed and queried for through the connector.php as well as the other images or files.\n. I see in elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php the 'URL' option as you say.\nIn my connector.php I set: 'URL' => '', ...\nHowever I see my script requests do this:\nhttp://trunk.debian6.local/15ece56560dfea9c7020526b60d8d79e.png\nNow would I still need to have a htaccess/mod rewrite to redirect these requests to the right path aka point to connector.php?\n. @jmar, the thumbnail feature was not important for us so far, so we just disabled it\n. that sounds ok, so I could change the method that it will normally deny .folders to be displayed, but my .trash folder it will provide the the JS client, however then the JS client needs skip folder listing of .trash but on clicking a trash symbol in the toolbar it will display that folders content.\nIt sounds as if I have to change and fiddle around with quite a few functions and methods.\n. I set the stuff below in my connector.php, that shows me the folder then, however I would also love to have custom actions in this folder, eg disable delete in there           \nphp\n'attributes' => array(\n                array(\n                    'pattern' => '/\\.archive/',\n                    // 'pattern' => '/^\\/\\./',\n                    'read' => true,\n                    'write' => true,\n                    'hidden' => false,\n                    'locked' => false\n                )\n. then it shows all . prefixed folders again in the folder structure\n. I now went ahead of removing display on a per case basis, as I know there will not be any .folders that I do not create this works for me:\nphp\narray(\n                    'pattern' => '/\\.archive/',\n                    // 'pattern' => '/^\\/\\./',\n                    'read' => true,\n                    'write' => true,\n                    'hidden' => false,\n                    'locked' => false\n                ),\n                array(\n                    'pattern' => '/\\.quarantine/',\n                    // 'pattern' => '/^\\/\\./',\n                    'read' => true,\n                    'write' => true,\n                    'hidden' => true,\n                    'locked' => false\n                ),\n. So I did this and it seems to work:\nhtml\n<input name=\"showhide\" value=\"+\" class=\"text_btn\" style=\"float: left\"  onclick=\"$('#filemanager').toggle();var elf = $('#finder').elfinder('instance'); elf.exec('reload'); if(document.getElementById('filemanager').style.display!='none') { this.value='-'; }else{ this.value='+'; } \" type=\"button\">\n. I guess that fixes it, maybe nice to add to documentation on how to call the elfinder from outside script.\n. I second that to be an error I see appear as well. I browsed through the code but could not see the change that might have resulted in this.\n I know this works on the demo in Icon mode, but this I see to fail:\n- Try to rename any file or folder with a special character, eg name .something.jpeg\n- Save. \n- Click the close button on the denied notification pop up window. See issue.\n- it is fine if you click the same folder again\nI was able to reproduce the issue in List View mode on elfinder.org\n. Is there any plan to enhance elFinder for iOS and Android?\n. Thanks for the info.\n. Confirmed, works for me in FF. IE cannot be helped then for now. Greying out the icon in IE is good and the open works for multiple. Great.\n. ",
    "ghost": "I found the cause around line 2976:\n```\n    $(document).bind('click', function(e) {\n        self.fm.ui.hideMenu();\n        $('input', self.cwd).trigger('change');\n    if (!$(e.target).is('input,textarea,select')) {\n        $('input,textarea').blur();\n    }\n});\n\n$('input,textarea').live('focus', function(e) {\n    self.lock = true;\n}).live('blur', function(e) {\n    self.lock = false;\n});\n\n```\nThe last part somehow re-enables the keyboard commands after closing down elfinder. I'm using a contenteditable by the way, not a textarea. Any idea?\n. This (preview) is a simple permissions plugin (entered in Octal mode) for Codiad. Would it be easy to port it as an elFinder plugin?\n. I ues IIS7.5\n. I`ve got the same problem ... If i am using dropbox driver (nao-pon/xelfinder) i've got the same result too... Did you find solution?\n. Here is a better version I found that uses the new 2.1 code\nhttp://pastebin.com/Bzt4eyZh\n``` javascript\n elFinder initialization (REQUIRED) \n\n            $().ready(function() {\n                var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n                    url : 'elfinder/php/connector.php'  // connector URL (REQUIRED)\n                    // lang: 'ru',             // language (OPTIONAL)\n                }).elfinder('instance');\n            });\n        \n\n        $().ready(function() {\n            var opts = {\n                cssClass : 'el-rte',\n                // lang     : 'ru',\n                height   : 450,\n                toolbar  : 'complete',\n                cssfiles : ['elrte/css/elrte-inner.css']\n            }\n            $('#descripcc').elrte(opts);\n        })\n\n        var dialog;\n$('#descripcc').elrte({\n  fmOpen: function(callback) {\n    if (!dialog) {\n      // create new elFinder\n      dialog = $('<div />').dialogelfinder({\n        url: 'connectors/php/connector.php',\n        commandsOptions: {\n          getfile: {\n            oncomplete : 'close' // close/hide elFinder\n          }\n        },\n        getFileCallback: callback // pass callback to file manager\n      });\n    } else {\n      // reopen elFinder\n      dialog.dialogelfinder('open')\n    }\n  }\n});\n    \n``\n. I get the **Edit** command on files with content in them. If I create a new file in elFinder the **Kind** is set toPlain Textbut as soon as I press enter to accept the new filename, the **Kind** is set asinode/x-empty. New empty text files created elsewhere also get set asinode/x-empty` which prevents them from being edited.\n. OK, I was able to fix it with this tip.\n. thx. could you please tell me, where i must add this code?\n. I found.\nYou must use the \"attributes\" function\n. This is what I saw in the demo, but in my case I get an error.\nWould you or is the problem?\nHow to fix it?\nthank you\n. Sorry, already figured out:\njs\n$('#elfinder_button').live('click', function() {\n            $('<div id=\"editor\" />').dialogelfinder({\n                url : '{{ path('ef_connect') }}',\n                getFileCallback: function(file) {\n                    $('#editor').dialogelfinder('close');\n                    $('#editor').closest('.elfinder').val(file.path);\n                    console.log($('#editor').closest('.elfinder-input'));\n                    console.log(file.url);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n. Hello,\nIndeed I saw that option, but it is possible to use a sp\u00e9sifique folder.\nFor example in my \"Pictures\" folder, I have five other cases one of which is call \"admin\".\nI want only the \"admin\" folder is not the deletion and renaming.\n. Very good.\ntky\n. It's just that I get the data of a variable,\n$ data = $ this-> Mod_grupo-> return ();\nand data received through the I name the folder locations, the roots, so I need a loop in the variable to extract the folder locations.\nI am using codeigniter.\nThanks for helping me, I'm using google translator, sorry\n. Chuck , I got the loop , thanks , but it turns out these other directories do not carry , only the first .

Just wait a bit to see if I can solve this other  problem , show here solution. \n. elFinder can support zip tar gz files? How I can active?\n. Awesome, I hope others find it useful as well.\n. I might have a look at doing something else for those folders, they do look ugly. I'm still playing around with the theme, so updates and suggestions are welcome.\nI modded the theme to fit in with Bootstrap (obviously), and Summernote, which uses Bootstrap for styling.\nI ended up making my own Font Icon (LibreICONS) to use with the CMS I've been building (LibreCMS). Summernote uses their own Font Icons, but were originally using Font Awesome, but it had a lot of Icons missing that I needed, hence making my own Font Icon, but I also include the SVG Source files, which I used for this theme. I have also included markup within the LibreICONS CSS that makes transitioning from Font Awesome, Summernote's Font Icons, Glyphicons, and even Octicons much easier.\n. @barryvdh I've changed the Folder Icon in the file window. I've also added FontAwesome and LibreICONS versions of the theme as well.\n. You are aware the Bootstrap will be dropping the Glyphicons?\nBeside's, plenty of people use Font Awesome with Bootstrap instead of Glyphicons.\nAlso, it's more to do with the look, and using the Bootstrap Classes.\n. is your SERVICE_URL actually referencing the connector for the language your using. for e.g., I'm using PHP, so I reference the elfinder/php/connector.php?\nEdit: Sorry, just reread your issue. The Mimes are set in the connector, not through the Javascript calling the editor instance. You can have different connector's for different mime types needed, and just call each connector for the mimes you need to work with.\n. His last comment on this was 5 hours ago. Do you think it might be possible that he's sleeping. Not everyone is online 24/7, lol.\n. From what I can tell from looking at the source code for the links provided by @canbozdemir the .net implementation is similar to the PHP one, just in a different language. Mime-Type as has already been pointed at several times, is set in the connector file that's called via javascript in the server side file. The mime type's aren't set via Javascript, rather by the .net connecter server side, as it is using PHP.\n. @canbozdemir google is your friend, or more recently, Bing is the coder's friend. Apparently, they've been indexing code snippets. Good Luck in getting it working.\n. Awesome, thank you. I'm sure other will like this too. Great work.\n. @nao-pon on this subject, what PHP libraries need to be installed to allow image resizing, rotating, and so on with the editing options?\n. Ah ok, I've stayed away from imagick as there's currently an open security issue with it (might be patched now), that was posted about in /r/netsec in Reddit.\nI've got GD2 installed on the live server, but the edit, for resize and rotate isn't working according to client reports, I haven't had time to test it myself. Is there something that needs to be enabled in the connector settings, or elsewhere?\n. https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-imagetragick-the-real-payloads-being-used-to-hack-websites-2/\n. Thanks @nao-pon, much appreciated. Client's have been loving using your project in my CMS, it's made things so much easier. Using it as an addon for Summernote WYSIWYG editor, and as a Media Manager embedded in a page.\n. For me it was at line 4460.\n. Actually, for me the radio buttons are disabled.\n. Cheers @nao-pon keep up the great work.\n. I just update everything, even cleared my browser cache to be sure the updated code is being used. I can resize image, but the crop and rotate radio buttons are still disabled. Is there maybe some setting I need to enabled, or apache/PHP library that needs to be installed?\n. Actually, I just noticed all three radio buttons are disabled. But the resize still works.\n. I should check things a bit more closely. When I actually go to perform the resize on an image, I get back a dialog with an error: Invalid parameters for command \"resize\".\n. @nao-pon, currently client's just upload a thumbnail image they wish to use, as I use elF in three ways. As a plugin to Summernote for media management, as a file uploader and selector within an input field for main and thumbnail images for products, blog cover images, and as a stand alone media manager on it's own page. It would be handy to for client's to edit a single upload image by duplicating it, renaming it, and cropping or rotating to use a thumbnail.\n. You can change the folder icons via CSS, but it would change all the folder icons, I don't think it would change a specific one. Not unless there was something like a folder type class or other way to designate the type of folder. Maybe if the the folder has a specific name, you could possible target the folder via CSS, and apply a style for that. I've never noticed if, for e.g. the name of the folder which is displayed as text, also has an attribute like name=\"photography\", or title=\"photography\", then you could do something like .folder[name=photography]{}.\nI might actually give this a go, as representing folders for the content they contain might be handy for client's.\n. @nao-pon I just had a look after my above comment. This would be doable if there was a title, or other attribute in the element that's generated that displays the actual icon.\n<div id=\"\" class=\"elfinder-cwd-file directory ui-corner-all ui-droppable native-droppable\" title=\"[this contains a date]\">\n  <div class=\"elfinder-cwd-icon elfinder-cwd-icon-directory ui-corner-all\" unselectable=\"on\" [some attribute]=\"[folder name]\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"elfinder-cwd-filename ui-draggable ui-draggable handle\" title=\"[folder name]\">[folder name]</div>\nAs you can see the [folder name] is after the element that is styled to display the folder icon. If there was an attribute with the [folder name] in the styled element then we could assign an icon to use as per the original Issuer's request using only CSS.\n. If the Icon markup appeared after the folder name in the DOM, then we could easily target the Icon using the next sibling abilities of CSS, as it is, CSS can't traverse backwards, only forwards. Hence, why it can't be targeted using CSS.\n. Ah, now I see what you mean. I was hoping for a solution without having to add more js, lol. Will have to add this option to the bootstrap-theme, and add extra folder types.\n. Yeah, replace the image reference in the code that @nao-pon showed you, with the image you want to use. It's pretty easy, I used SVG Icons with what I did from the examples, and even added more folder types so different folders can have different icons.\n. The uiOptions goes in the javascript options when calling the elFinder instance.\n. Not sure what you mean on the comment above I added a confused icon too.\nThere's a donate button on the site below:\nhttp://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/#elf_l1_YV9sb3Rfc2FtcGxl\n. Yes you need to make the modifications, we don't have access to your stuff to do it for you. Plus, it'll be a learning experience for you.\n. Did you restart Apache/nGinx (or whatever your using)? Also, does your server side script limit the file size of uploaded files. There's also a PHP setting for .htaccess that can limit uploaded file sizes.\n. hm, WAMP, not sure if there'a anything else that could be stopping it. I haven't used WAMP for over 10 years or so, surprised it's still around. Personally, I use Linux, and a LAMP stack. If I think of anything else that could be an issue, I'll let you know.\n. I know what WAMP is, and there are some differences.\n. In your PHP connector for elFinder, check that there isn't a file size limit option set. I didn't see one in mine, but I have extensively modified mine so the folders resolve correctly so I may have removed it if it was there.\n. maybe try removing the option in the connector file (or comment it out), and see if that helps. Ideally you should only need to set the options in the connector file.\n. oh FFS, I thought you were trying to upload 2MB, lol. I think @nao-pon may be on the mark with this, file system limitations.\n. Are you running the 64-bit version of WAMP?\n. WAMP being 32bit, will more than likely be the issue.\nAlso, what could you possibly be uploading that 2GB?\n. There must be another setting overriding your edited setting somewhere.\n. Does that get set by elFinder, or does it get the setting from somewhere else? If so, do a search in the elFinder source to see where it gets the setting from.\n. ah ok, you must be getting close to what's going on. I just resolved an issue I was having between Bootstrap and elFinder. Always a good feeling when something is worked out.\nSilly question. Have you tried doing a search in google for say \"wamp file size limitation upload large files\" or something like that?\nAlso, you might get help with WAMP here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wamp\n. Having a look at the generated dialog content for resizing in Chrome's Dev Tools. The Resize, Crop and Rotate Radio Input's have disabled attributes by default. Am I right in assuming that if the dependency requirement's are met (i.e. installed system libraries to perform those actions) then elFinder would enable those radio buttons. I'm also thinking that may be why even the resize isn't working as elFinder isn't getting back expected results to allow resizing to work.\nAs mentioned above, I have checked that GD is installed, Image-magick is installaed, and I tried it with that as well.\n. Not sure if this helps you track down the issue, this is what's sent when the resize is requested to elFinder:\nGET http://localhost/LibreCMS/core/elfinder/php/connector.php?cmd=resize&target=l1_dGVzdC5qcGc&quality=80&mode=&_=1463542313093\n200 OK\n60ms \nThis is the response:\n{\"error\":[\"errCmdParams\",\"resize\"]}\nIs it me? I entered 300 for the width, the height was auto generated (not an issue). Shouldn't there also be sent the width, and height in the url?\nEDIT: Issue is also persistent in Firefox.\n. The elfinder.html after modifying the connector to access the correct folder works.\nI did notice that the selectors in the dialog aren't using the Radio button itself, I assume they've been restyled to use labels?\n. Looks like it's something to do with the styling, as you've pointed out. But elF shouldn't be affected by other styles, or they shouldn't interfere, so something is overriding.\nI also tried removing all the unnecessary css includes, and only allowed what elF require's and uses in the sample, and even tried including them last in the hopes the elF CSS would override styles that come before hand. No luck the radio button selector's through out elF get overridden. This is something that shouldn't happen, would it be an idea that elF uses it's own classes for these, that way other CSS Frameworks won't interfere with elF's styles.\n\nAs you can see the dialog doesn't have the styled radio buttons like the default elF does using the sample .html file.\nNOTE: I did try it with the elfinder.html, and everything worked. Hence why the image in the screen shot is rotated.\n. As you can see below, I've called the elfinder.html from within my CMS's folder structure where elF is located, and the styling is fine, and the image editing works.\n\n. The more I look at the source, the more I think it's got more to do with how the dialog and elements have been implemented.\nAnybody should be able to override the style of the elements, without interfering with the functionality.\nFor e.g., there's styles that are injected into the elements that aren't exposed in the stylesheet, and the id's for elements look very random resize-elfinder-l1_dGVzdC5qcGc-resize. I get that the label has the for=resize-elfinder-l1_dGVzdC5qcGc-resize and the radio button has that id, and the radio button should be hidden, and clicking the label activates the associated radio button. But why is the javascript adding an attribute to disable those radio buttons?\nPlus, I've gone through the full and minified, and theme.css to try and determine what bootstrap styles are interfering, can't find any direct styling for the radio button and it's associated label elements.\n. I just tried a little experiment, I added all the classes and javascript to the elfinder.html file so I could remove each reference until I find which file has whatever is affecting the dialog adversely. At this stage I haven't removed any of the added classes. \nHowever, when I removed the bootstrap.js, everything works fine again. So something with Bootstrap's JS is interfering with elFinder's script. Exactly what, I don't know yet.\n. Ok, I came across issue #740 and added:\njavascript\nvar btn = $.fn.button.noConflict(); // reverts $.fn.button to jqueryui btn\n$.fn.btn = btn; // assigns bootstrap button functionality to $.fn.btn\nWhich fixes it, completely. Bloody Bootstrap.\nThanks for you assistance on this.\n. Cheers for your help. Two of my client's are really happy that it works now. Now to fix the bootstrap theme for elF.\n. You can hide folders using the below in the connector.php file inside the roots array, the folder|to|hide is the list of folders to hide using the pipe character as a deliminator:\nPHP\n            'attributes'=>array(\n                array(\n                    'pattern'=>'!^/folder|to|hide!',\n                    'hidden'=>true\n                )\n            )\n. Not sure about the bind callback, but regex can take many forms, and can have differences between languages. Not sure what they are using is strictly regex for that, but it works.\nThey could be just exploding the setting, using | is the deliminator.\n. You can change the icons via the CSS styles.\n. You could modify the connector so it gets the current logged in user, and creates the credentials on the fly so they only have access to their designated folder. For e.g. when creating a user account you could have a folder created using their username, then when elFinder is initialised, if your using cookie's or a session id for logged in users, the connector can grab that, then use that data to set the folder they have access to.\n. Are users able to change to the root folder, even if you specifally set their user folder?\nphp\n$opts=array(\n    'roots'=>array(\n        array(\n            'path'=>$_SERVER[\"DOCUMENT_ROOT\"].DS.$settings['system']['url'].DS.'media'.DS,\n            'URL'=>URL.'media/',\n        )\n    )\n)\nIs this the options your using to set their user folder, it's what I would do, but add their folder, after the media? From my understanding, doing that would make it so that would be that user's root folder.\n. I tried it myself on my local machine, using what @nao-pon described, using Linux Mint, Apache, and it worked as @nao-pon described. Check you haven't made a typo, or it's possible some other system settings is stopping things working as expected. \n. You could also use .htaccess to stop files being uploaded to folders, essentially blocking selected folders.\n. Are you still doing this on a Windows Box? I wonder, if like the 2GB limit issue you had on another issue, might also be something to do with this as well.\n. Well, it seems like your the expert. I'm not having the issue's your having, so I must not know what I'm doing, go figure.\nWas just making suggestions, that you may not have thought of.\nPHP, can and will behave differently in a Windows Environment. The majority of servers run some derivative of Linux these days, hence why most developer's use Linux, even Locally for testing.\n. @nao-pon has, scroll up, I tried what he suggested and it worked. There MUST be something your missing, or it's something to do with using Windows.\nI don't see how sharing my connector script is going to help you, anyway, let's see if you understand how I've modified mine:\nphp\n<?php\nerror_reporting(0);\ndefine('DS',DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);\ninclude_once dirname(__FILE__).DS.'elFinderConnector.class.php';\ninclude_once dirname(__FILE__).DS.'elFinder.class.php';\ninclude_once dirname(__FILE__).DS.'elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php';\ninclude_once dirname(__FILE__).DS.'elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php';\n$settings=parse_ini_file('..'.DS.'..'.DS.'..'.DS.'core'.DS.'config.ini',TRUE);\nif((!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS'])&&$_SERVER['HTTPS']!=='off')||$_SERVER['SERVER_PORT']==443)\n    define('PROTOCOL','https://');\nelse\n    define('PROTOCOL','http://');\ndefine('URL',PROTOCOL.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].$settings['system']['url'].'/');\nfunction access($attr,$path,$data,$volume){\n    return strpos(basename($path),'.')===0?!($attr=='read'||$attr=='write'):null;\n}\n$opts=array(\n    'roots'=>array(\n        array(\n            'imgLib'=>'gd',\n            'driver'=>'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'=>$_SERVER[\"DOCUMENT_ROOT\"].DS.$settings['system']['url'].DS.'media'.DS,\n            'URL'=>URL.'media/',\n            'uploadDeny'=>array(\n                'all'\n            ),\n            'uploadAllow'=>array(\n                'image',\n                'text/plain'\n            ),\n            'uploadOrder'=>array(\n                'deny',\n                'allow'\n            ),\n            'accessControl'=>'access',\n            'attributes'=>array(\n                array(\n                    'pattern'=>'',\n//                    'pattern'=>'!^/orders|backup|avatar!',\n                    'hidden'=>true\n                )\n            )\n        )\n    )\n);\n$connector=new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n. I've already mentioned, I tried what @nao-pon described and it worked. As I keep saying, it has to be something your doing, or some quirk with Windows. I remember having weird directory structure issue's even back in the XP days with folder recursion, and other weird permissions issue's with access. All those issue's went away after switching to Linux. I don't remember what I'd done to resolve things back then, and it could be different to what your getting now, as elFinder wasn't around back then.\n. Have you tried this in Linux at all, just to compare if it is a Windows thing?\n. Give me exactly what you want me to try for the access. And I'll see if what your using works?\n. ",

    "Gamerz": "If this functionality is added onto the user interface so instead of manually going to the scripts and adding each file/folder to edit we will be able to just edit each individual file/folders on the elFinder file options (right click on a file), then I totally support it to be released for 2.1\n. Simple. Just \"mount\" another set of driver and name it \"LocalFileSystem\" on your opts inside connector.php\nExample:\n``` php\n<?php\n$opts = array(\n    'roots' => array(\n        array(\n            'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',   // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n            'path'          => 'path/to/files/root',         // path to files (REQUIRED)\n            'URL'           => 'http://www.localhost.com/files/root/', // URL to files (REQUIRED)\n            'alias'  => 'Root',\n            'accessControl' => 'access'             // disable and hide dot starting files (OPTIONAL)\n        ),\n        array(\n            'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',   // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n            'path'          => 'path/to/files/second_root',         // path to files (REQUIRED)\n            'URL'           => 'http://www.localhost.com/files/second_root/', // URL to files (REQUIRED)\n            'alias'  => 'Secondary Root',\n            'accessControl' => 'access'             // disable and hide dot starting files (OPTIONAL)\n        )\n    )\n);\n``\n. Just assign anattributes` array inside the specific mounted driver you would like to set the permissions for.\nFor example, you would like to lock out the \"TEST\" Folder inside the \"Main Root\" root, you would do this:\nphp\n<?php\narray(\n    'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem', // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n    'path' => 'path/to/files/main_root', // path to files (REQUIRED)\n    'accessControl' => 'access',             // disable and hide dot starting files (OPTIONAL)\n    'attributes' => array(\n        array(\n            'pattern' => '/\\TEST$/', //You can also set permissions for file types by adding, for example, <b>.jpg</b> inside pattern.\n            'read' => false,\n            'write' => false,\n            'locked' => true\n        )\n    )\n),\nYou can set the following true/false to the attributes:\n'read'   => true/false,\n'write'  => true/false,\n'locked' => true/false,\n'hidden' => true/false\nHope this helped!\n. Haha, thanks Troex for adding the code view. I was actually trying to find the code format, but never actually got it. \nEDIT: The two wikis has now been fully completed.\n. I'm not understanding? What are you trying to do?\n. Alright, I actually figured my way to most config options. Although no matter how many posts I dig or scripts that I go through, I can't seem to get the MySQL driver to work. Maybe it's just me, but has anyone actually got the MySQL driver up and running? If you could Troex, please make a MySQL driver wiki documentation as your top priority as I know a lot more people are having this issue. Thank you.\n. Yeah, that would be appreciated if you could get me a SQL dump. I did all that above and still doesn't work.\nEDIT: Sorry for closing this issue, I reopened it.\n. Oh my....it was that easy LOL. What I did was made the parent_id 1 in the sql, so it didn't show anything...that's why I was having troubles. But it works now, thanks! \nAnd uhm, when I was browsing through topics in this forum, I noticed that quite a few people are having that issue as well...when files can't be moved into directories. I, too, are having that issue as well. It gives me a blank error popup. I'll probably look into this issue and figure it out when I have some time.\nEDIT: When I upload a file to the MySQL driver, I can't seem to open the file. It opens a new window and said: \"errFileNotFound\" and not the actual file contents. Do you get that?\n. I can create a text file but I can't read it...basically, I can't read anything which makes this driver useless at this stage. It works but you can't really do anything useful on it. It's either a broken link, which I suspect it is, or a broken function in which the hash of the path in the url is messed up. Either way, I'm going back to the LocalFileSystem driver until this issue is fixed (Hopefully on 2.1)\n. Even after strpos() is replaced with mb_stripos(), the results are still case-sensitive. Are there more functions in the script to disable case-sensitivity?\n. What's wrong with storing comments in a MySQL DB? I mean just because the comments are in a DB, doesn't mean the whole file system needs to. The DB table could just simply contain a unique id, file name (where the comments come from), commenter information (who, when, maybe ip). And to retrieve it, maybe make a class and select * in table comments and each comment row will go out to each file name. Am I being clear in what i'm trying to propose?\n. ",

It is actually a php file.In the .htaccess file in the same directory\nAddType application/x-httpd-php .htmlRewriteEngine on # Turn on the rewriting engine\nRewriteRule open-command-prompt-here.html /common/open-command-prompt-here.html?&requri=%{REQUEST_URI}&reqfname=%{REQUEST_FILENAME} [L]\nThen when I open the file open-command-prompt-here.html I don't want to see the content but I want another file to render (/common/open-command-prompt-here.html etc...)\nIt was working fine in an earlier version of elfinder.I just want it to render normally as if it was not intercepted by elfinder.\nRegards,MiKL~408 564 9578 : Cell408 538 0490 :\u00a0Voicemail/Text/SMS\nManEstate.com\u00a0In the meantime connect with me\u00a0using one of your accounts :\n.

On linux systems, elFinder would see the / character and then not prepend the root.

    "barryvdh": "Okay, the uploadAllow and uploadDeny options look nice.\nI only use tinyMCE, so I don't know if it is useful to include some standard types, otherwise I'll just code it by hand, that's pretty easy then.\nFor the startPath, I'd rather like a root dir, but I already described that here. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/93\n. My CMS editor is on a different domain then my website, so I use the following configuration:\n'path'          => $_SESSION['path'].'/content/media/',\n'URL'           => $_SESSION['baseurl'].'/content/media', \nAnd path is something like /domains/mydomain.com/public_html/ and URL like http://www.mydomain.com/\nBut when I select a file, i get url.path = media/myimg.jpg, but what I actually want is to return content/media/myimg.jpg\nOne solution is the following:\n    'path'          => $_SESSION['path'].'/content/',\n    'URL'           => $_SESSION['baseurl'].'/content'\nand then set the startpath\n$connector->startPath = $_SESSION['path'].'/content/media';\nThis will return the correct path, but then the user is able to browse one level to high.\nSo what I think is better:\n    'path'          => $_SESSION['path'],\n    'baseURL'           => $_SESSION['baseurl']\nAnd then set something like topDir of rootDir, the same as startDir, but without the possibility to go above it.\nIt just seems weird that the path returns the first dir, when \"content/media\" is my root directory for the browser, the file \"content/media/images/myimg.jpg\" should return images/myimg.jpg and/or a full patth \"content/media/images/myimg.jpg, but this just seems weird imho.\n. Okay, but doesn't it make more sense that the return path starts after the root dir, instead of with the root dir?\nWell, of it's just me, it doesn't matter, but I thought it was more logical the other way.\n. No but i mean:\nRoot dir is: content/media\nI select image/myimg.jpg (content/media/image/myimg.jpg)\nSo imo the return value should be image/myimg.jpg but instead, it returns media/image/myimg.jpg.\nBut either way will work, so it's not a big problem to me.\n. +1\nIs it possible to get a current release, or maybe a manual release after some important bugfixes or new features? A few important bugs seem to be fixed, but I don't have Node.js or Jake, to build it..\n. But it would probably be a good idea to have at least basic protection, or provide some examples how to fix this.\nI implented this fix (tnx @noosalife) and set the validName function to disallow php files, but maybe this should be included by default?\n. Indeed, this is also the case when selecting a file.\n. Okay, but with the default (#ffffff) and with transparant, they are both black..\n. Still present in the 2.0-rc1, with new thumbnails.\n. Do you mean the screen of elFinder, or the dialog? \n. Better in #363?\n. Did you follow this Wiki guide? https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Integration-with-TinyMCE-3.x\nYou have to change the elfinder.html file, to set the callback for clicking on an item, otherwise nothing will happen.\n. You can also use https://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver\nThat enables support for any Flysystem (https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem) driver, like SFTP (https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-sftp)\n. Turn error reporting on and track the errors.\nOr write your own driver.\nOr convince your boss to upgrade to 5.4+, that's safer anyways ;)\n. Perhaps better to split this. Other (irrelevant) commits seem to have been added since.\n+1 for Composer :) \nBut it could use pre-built assets probably..\n. Closed in favor of #878 / #928\n. Closed in favor of #878 / #928\n.

Got a file listing but doesn't really seem to work yet with directory listing, and not sure if paths etc are correct. https://gist.github.com/barryvdh/6fda690d59a7963c5c76\nNeed a Filesystem instance in it's config.\nuse League\\Flysystem\\Filesystem;\nuse League\\Flysystem\\Adapter\\Local as Adapter;\n'roots' => array(\n    array(\n        'driver' => 'Flysystem', // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n        'path' => 'content', // path to files (REQUIRED)\n        'URL' => asset('content'), // URL to files (REQUIRED)\n        'filesystem' => new Filesystem(new Adapter(public_path()))\n    )\n),\n. So if anybody is interested, I've updated the gist so that files/directory listing seems to work. (Only tested with the Local adapter.\n. Submitted a PR in #928\n. I hope not. The last release is working for me (using the latest 2.1 nightly from https://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder-nightly)\n. Yes I also don't really have a rush, it works fine for my purpose..\nAnyone know which fork is best maintained (if any)?\n. I've made the path optional (defaults to '/') and instead of filesystem, it's also possible to just add the adapter directly.\narray(\n    'driver' => 'Flysystem',\n    'URL' => asset('content'), \n    'adapter' => new LocalAdapter('/var/www/html/content')\n),\nReason for having both options is that frameworks/libraries might supply a Filesystem instance, but users might find it easier to add just the adapter.\n. Update: I've added an icon and tweaked dirname, so when no path is used, dirs should still be under the correct root.\n. Pinging @hason @mazurva @jarodium @ahmadazimi @adisos because they have shown interest in related issues.\nAnyone care to test this with \"league/flysystem\": \"1.0.*@dev\",? I can browse, make dirs, upload files, preview images, rename and delete files, tested with the SFTP and Local adapters.\n. I've also tested basic FTP and Dropbox:\narray(\n    'driver' => 'Flysystem',\n    'adapter' => new DropboxAdapter(new Dropbox\\Client($token, $appName))\n),\n. Yeah I guess it should work with all supported Adapters, but I'm not really sure if the paths work correctly like this (if there are differences with directory separators (Windows?) or that not all adapters supply the required attributes/meta data). Now it's just 'it works on my machine' but if some other people give it a go, we might catch some issues :)\nThe reasoning behind allowing just an adapter, is that it might be a bit shorter if you just use this stand-alone (only use the flysystem for elFinder), but I guess that it's just as easy to create your own Flysystem instance. I'm okay with removing this I guess.\n. I've simplified the paths functions a bit, don't think they are necessary with Flysystem.\n@nao-pon it's not possible to use an empty root, is it? Because Flysystem handles it's own 'root', it just uses '' as the root, so don't really need the absolute/relative paths etc.\nAnd do I need the normpath, relpath, abspath functions etc? Because everything is already normalized by the Flysystem..\n. I've added a method to resize the the images also. \nBut I feel like this is probably a lot the same for all non-local volume drivers. I just used the _getContents and _filePutContents method to read/write to a temporary file, so it should be the same for all drivers..\nPerhaps it's worth to put it the elfinderVolumeDriver and just let the local driver use the 'native' methods?\n. Could probably be a getLocalFile() function also on the AbstractDriver, because it's always the same. And the local driver could just return the same filename, which we could check\n```\nprotected function getLocalFile($path)\n{\n    $local_path = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), 'elfinder');\n    if (!$local_path) {\n        return false;\n    }\n$contents = $this->_getContents($path);\nif (!$contents) {\n    return false;\n}\n\n$written = @file_put_contents($local_path, $this->_getContents($path), LOCK_EX);\nif ($written !== false) {\n    return $local_path;\n}\n\n}\n```\nCheck before deleting:\n$path = $this->decode($hash);\n$local_path = $this->getLocalFile($path);\nif (!$local_path) {\n    $this->setError(elFinder::ERROR_FTP_DOWNLOAD_FILE, $local_path);\n    return false;\n}\n//.....skip this part..\nif ($result) {\n    if($local_path !== $path) {\n        $contents = file_get_contents($local_path);\n        if ($contents && !$this->_filePutContents($path, $contents)) {\n            $this->setError(elFinder::ERROR_FTP_UPLOAD_FILE, $path);\n            $this->deleteFile($local_path); //cleanup\n        }\n    }\n    $this->clearcache();\n    return $this->stat($path);\n}\nSo local just has to be:\nprotected function getLocalFile($path)\n{\n    return $path;\n}\nBut perhaps this is better fitted in a different issue.\n. Re-submitted in #967 because squashing didn't work out..\n. Ah cool you worked that out :)\nI've create a seperate repository for the Flysystem driver, so it's easier to restrict to certain versions etc. (And Composer is required anyways)\nhttps://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver\nIt also supports http://glide.thephpleague.com/ to create thumbnails or secure urls :)\n. Wondering the same thing. I always just use 2.1, because it's ahead of 2.x, bust most changes are merged back and forth.\n. Probably something like this:\narray(\n    'driver'    => 'S3'\n    'accesskey' => '',\n    'secretkey' => '',\n    'bucket'    => '',\n    'path'      => '',\n),\nIf you want to use Flysystem (which requires Composer etc), you can look into: https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/928\nBut that's not stable yet.\n. Did you follow the guide for CKEditor? Any JS errors in your console? Try debugging the return value from elFinder.\n. You can easily submit a pull request, just click on the edit button in the github web interface ;)\n. Perhaps this would be better fit as a custom package, to take care of package etc. Let me think about it ;)\n. Yeah I'm not sure, if it's a seperate package I can require dependancies and perhaps support new releases etc. And I can make updates/changes faster.\nSo perhaps better to keep it a seperate package and just list it in the readme?\n. Why? (English please?)\n. Maybe change it to file.url || file (Or var url = typeof file == 'string' ? file : file.url;?\n. You can use the S3 flysystem driver with https://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver\n. Sorry for the late reply, but this has a few problems with Composer.\nYou tag, for example, 2.1.1, 2.1.2 etc. This can be required with:\ncomposer require studio-42/elfinder:\"2.1.x\"\nWhich is great! But if you have your stability set to dev, you will get the version from the 2.1 branch, which doesn't include a build.\ncomposer require studio-42/elfinder:\"2.1.x@dev\"\nThey probably should be reversed, eg. work on 2.1-src and build to 2.1. Or there should be an alias (https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/aliases.md) but not 100% sure if that works correctly with those branch names.\nThe main benefit is that a package require elFinder, can just require 2.1.x and don't care about the stability settings.\n. Sorry, I don't really understand your question. Could you rephrase that?\ncomposer require studio-42/elfinder:\"dev-2.1-src\" would probably work indeed, but for example, in laravel-elfinder, I require \"studio-42/elfinder\": \"2.1.x\",\nIf people want the latest nightly, they could require  studio-42/elfinder:\"2.1.x@dev\" in their own composer file, or lower the stability to dev in the settings. It would still validate as 2.1.x, so will work with my package. But if they need to require dev-2.1-src, it will lead to conflicts.\n. Okay cool.\nSo what is the difference between them? You are still developing all three of them? Usually the 'active' development branch is master, but it doesn't really matter.\n. @kirakhaos Can you see what the actual mimetype is (not extension) for the file, as returned by the driver? Which driver is it? audio/mpeg should display as MP3, but some might use audio/mpeg3 or audio/mp3 instead, which isn't recognized.\n. I think you should use false for the native php classes like Imagick and PDO, but you should autoload the volume driver with true.\n. You can try this if you want: https://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver\n. I would be happy if the session (and response/request) were abstracted to some classes/interfaces, so we can implement our own ones. Similar to https://github.com/maximebf/php-debugbar/blob/master/src/DebugBar/HttpDriverInterface.php and https://github.com/maximebf/php-debugbar/blob/master/src/DebugBar/PhpHttpDriver.php\n. Haven't tested it, but seems reasonable. Not really sure what the empty checks do, but I guess we wouldn't need that (or the base64) in our own wrappers, right?\n. I've implemented this for Laravel, looks good :)\nhttps://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-elfinder/commit/90a32a00690adb64421d9f39342a737798f4f5ad\n. Can you tag a new release sometime soon? Now latest release is broken :(\n. Sorry I don't think this is fully correct either. We're still not sure if $file is set in the next line.\nNot sure if it's $file or $path, but we should check if they're set before using them, or initialize at null first.\n. That looks nice :) Also seems to fit nicely with TinyMce: http://archive.tinymce.com/tryit/basic.php\nIt looks a bit similar to https://github.com/lokothodida/elfinder-theme-moono \nMaybe you can combine them for less work?\nI'm not a super big fan of the big black folder icons, perhaps a less solid one could be used for the bigger icons?\n. Great, thanks!\nBtw, I've made some changes to the flysytem driver to increase performance and reduce requests.\nLet me know if this breaks anything!\nhttps://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver/compare/80df7e54e6b65e49ddc92e590679979ca280605b...v0.1.5?w=1\n. https://github.com/barryvdh/elfinder-flysystem-driver/issues/43\nCan you avoid creating multiple same issues, or at least reference them.\nThe flysystem drivers caches in the session by default, so when you load the contents in elfinder, then do something in the cloud console directly, it will indeed not show up. But hitting the refresh button in elfinder should clear the cache. You can also set the cache  option to false\n. There is also this for frontend: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper\nWhich can be used to manipulate/crop/resize on the frontend, and send the cropped image.\nOr you could do it serverside with a composer package like https://github.com/Intervention/image or https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine\n.

And I explained, I removed the accessControl, but the option I used was the same as in your wiki, so I didn't see a need to include the code.\n. I fixed the issue, I'll do a pull request. What branch etc should I use? the files I have in my project are from 2.1.9, but the 2.1 branch on here does not match those files :/\n. I'm not sure. Bind seems like it works after an action is performed? I need to get data form the database when files are displayed. If bind can do this, then yes. But I cannot find any example of how to parse through each file to add the extra data\n. I have added the above code into my project, but it is not working correctly.\nI put a break point on the foreach loop in the addExtra function, but it is never hit when opening a file. I even tried changing the bind to info but again it never hits the addExtra function :/\n. Turns out the function has to be added to the Elfinder_lib.php file.\n. info doesn't seem to do anything?\n. Is there a way to include the extra data in a column in the list view?\n. I found out by looking in the issue list. Can you please update the 2.1 documentation? It is way behind and lacks a lot of information.\n. Can this be documented please?\n. Yes, this was my thinking, but might look a bit \"ugly\".\nThe folders that I am limiting access to are for \"jobs\" and will each contain various files. Root volumes can and would work, but there is likely to be maybe 100+ folders per user.\nAdded to this, I will likely use Google Cloud Storage, and whilst I can target a folder in GCS as a root volume, it'd be nicer to have the one root volume, e.g. \"user A jobs\" then underneath, each job folder.\nI'll do some test with root volumes, see what the performance is like.\n. How can I modify/extend the driver to do this exactly?\n. Seems accessControl can do it, just need to refine how I check the users allowed folders\n. Below is a pastebin of the response form one of the folders that is showing duplicate folders inside it.\nJust to highlight, the path variable in options is incorrect. This is coming from GCS, so the path is basically the URL - it doesn't have a file path as such. I think this path problem is causing other issues I have posted.\nOddly, one of the duplicates will be \"real\" and have files inside, the other is empty (and obviously should not exist in the file tree anyway, as it does not actually exist!)\n. It is very odd, as I have another GCS bucket with nested folders, and they are not duplicated. On another browser, it is the same. Some duplicated nested folders, others are OK\n. The path isn't the same though? Or do you mean, because I have not set the path, e.g. it is techincally null or \"\" that it think they are the same?\nI'll add the ID and see if that helps.\n. Gotya. Yea, maybe make the caching key use options that must be set and that are unique :)\n. Sorry I don't understand what you mean. \nI'm pretty sure it's caused by the path being wrong, but if I put the path as the bucket public URL (same as URL option) the root volume stops working. So I left path out. \n. I checked and using a breakpoint on StreamingReadingTrait, and it is never hit when trying to edit a text file.\n. OK, found the problem. Looks like an empty file e.g. a newly created text file, returns the contents as false, and therefore errors out.\nI can see where this happens, it's getting set to false in vendor/superbalist/flysystem-google-storage/src/GoogleStorageAdapter.php read() but this is passed to vendor/league/flysystem/src/Filesystem.php read() where the contents are actually returned.\nSo where does this need fixing? If I know which package should be fixed, I can attempt a patch.\n. As for moving a file form GCS to local, the error is happening in the saveCE() method.\nIn elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php, line 3765, $path is returning false from $this->saveCE(...) and again, I think this may be due to GCS not needing the path option\n. Surely this is now enough information for someone to start looking at a fix?\n. When I selected two files and download, it attempts to make a ZIP file, finishes and then does nothing. No ZIP file is in the folder or downloaded?\nEDIT - I downloaded the nightly, 2.1.x-dev and I'm still having issues.

Do you really want a new issue where it's 99% the same as this one?\n. Demo site works.\nWhat do you mean \"Also, please try in elFinder of stand-alone in your server.\"? I already did try, that's how I found the problem...\n. Yes that's the connector URL. I'll post my exact code later, but I don't understand what you mean \"do you try elFinder alone?\" \n.

Oneplus One, running COS 13 (Android 6.0.1), Chrome v50.0.02661.89\nBut it doesnt work in my desktop Chrome browser, when using the repsonsive tools. But your demo site does.\n. My root options:\narray(\n                    'id' => 'blah',\n                    'driver' => 'Flysystem',\n                    'alias' => 'CS Root',\n                    'URL' => 'https://storage.googleapis.com/MY_BUCKET/',\n                    'filesystem' => new Filesystem($this->googleCloud('MY_BUCKET')),\n                    'separator' => '/'\n                )\n. It gets worse. If I change the target bucket back and forth, and even change the ID attribute, I can land in a bucket and see an old, now deleted sub folder.\n. Sorry, I am unsure where the problem lies so put issues on each repo. I'll make sure to reference in future. \nI understand I wouldn't see changes in elFinder after doing stuff in the console until I refresh elFinder. But even so, folders made in the console do not show up after a refresh. \nAlso, if I create a folder in elFinder, navigate into it and try to upload a file, I get an error saying the folder doesn't exist. \n. Yea, that documentation is useless to me.\nI want to add Google Drive alongside a LocalFileSystem. Can You please provide correct documentation and not just link to some terrible comments?\n. Much better. Just trying it now. Where do I get the Client ID, secret and refresh token from? I cannot see anything like that in my Drive API credentials.\n. I restarted WAMP several times. No .htaccess file in use. I am using Codeigniter 3, but there doesn't seem to be any default file size limit.\nAlso, doesn't elFinder do chunked uploads?\nEDIT - I also changed the memory limit to 10G, no dice.\n. Well is pretty much the same, just running on Windows.\n. I have it set to 0 which should mean unlimited.\nEDIT - Using debug mode, I can see the following option when trying to upload a file larger then 2G\nuploadMaxSize:2147483647\nBut I have explicitly set this to be 0 (tried 10G before, now trying 0)\nEDIT 2 - Did more digging. in elfinder.full.js, response.uplMaxSize is being set correctly from my options.\n. Tried that, no luck.\n. I am using Windows 10 64bit.\n@lianee I checked phpinfo(), and all my PHP settings are fine, as stated above.\n. @StudioJunkyard aha, no I'm not! It's 32 bit, for some odd reason haha!\nIs there a way to upload these large files, chunked to 2gb?\n. I need to upload files bigger than 2GB, possibly up to 100GB. It's surveying point cloud data from laser scans.\n. OK, I am using WAMP 64 bit, PHP 5.6 64bit, which allows for larger then 2GB file uploads http://php.net/releases/5_6_0.php\nYet elFinder still fails to let me upload files larger then 2GB.\n. Well this is buggered.\nI am on 64bit Windows, running 64bit WAMP (Apache) and 64bit PHP v5.6.21. My PHP_INT_MAX should be 9223372036854775807\nPHP_INT_SIZE: 4 , PHP_INT_MAX: 2147483647\n. The only place PHP_INT_MAX is mentioned is in the elFinder library.\n. elFinder check to see if it is set, if not, it sets it.\nThe test I just did does not even load elFinder, so the issue is not with elFinder, or my project. Something up with WAMP or Windows.\n. @phtsaibb I think the issue lies with Windows and PHP. There is some info online about it, and the solution tended to be \"use Linux\".\nWe have a linux server we pay for, so I may try and test on there.\n. @phtsaibb AFAIK if you are running 64bit Linux, with 64bit Apache and PHP 5.6+, with the php.ini settings sorted, you should be able to upload more then 2gb.\n. Also, how can I use a callback in my controller?\nRight now, I have to put callbacks in the elFinder library file, but I ideally need them to sit in the controller that loads the elFinder_lib file.\nI tried:\n'bind' => array(\n    'open' => array($this, 'check_access')\n)\nBut it doesn't seem to work.\n. Sorted it.\nI needed parents to check the main fodler under the root.\nAnd in CI3, I had to make my callback function public.\n. That pattern isn't a valid regex pattern, how on earth does it work?!\nEitherway, is there no way to use the bind callback? It'd make things much cleaner in my project.\n. @nao-pon is there a reason why I cannot use the hidden attribute in a bind callback?\n. That is not a valid answer. I know I could use it, but I want to use the bind callback. Please look at adding in the hidden attribute. \nIt makes zero sense that you can set read and write with bind, but not hidden. \n. Argh, I tried that before and it was not working! now it is. Nvm.\n. Right, the solution you gave me does not work.\nUsing /^123$/ as the pattern, and setting write to false and locked to true, neither attributes are set.\nIf I use !^/123! the attributes are correctly set.\n. you have to add , for example, a root FTP volume in the connector, then the button is enabled (strange I know!)\n. Ha, well this just gets better.\nI disabled read and write access for a XML file, and elFinder let me download it.\nIf you then open it, it turns out to be the HTML output of the page elFinder is in.\nWhy is the download option even available?! And why is it downloading the HTML source?!\n. There is no 2.1.12 package available via composer\n. $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] fetches the location of the script being run. Problem seems to be your code.\n. I think having a modal to show a confirmation for upload should be a feature of elFinder.\n. I'm not interfering with any of that script.\nEven in my browser, using Chrome tools to make the site appear as it would on mobile, my project just won't show the mobile view, but I can view your demo page on desktop, with Chrome tools, as a mobile page, and it works.\nIs there anything else I can try? I need to support a mobile view!\n.

Point is, I am using the same JS and CSS files client side, but it doesn't work.Is there anyway to test the UA detection built into elFinder?\nEDIT - the included example project from the repo seems to work.\nEDIT 2 - Adding the <meta> tag helps to make it responsive, but still no \"touch\" classes added\n. I don't have any. See my code above, that's it.\n. My page source http://pastebin.com/PeqgizxJ\n. If you can explain exactly how elFinder figures out if you are on mobile, I may be able to start digging to find the issue\n. Working. The JS file had not been updated properly.\n. Nav bar is hiding itself, but the left side directory list doesn't hide itself, and I cannot swipe it away?\n. I updated to 2.1.12 (I was using 2.1.x-dev, but this did not grab 2.1.12?) and whilst using my desktop browser in mobile mode, both nav and side bar auto hide, but on my phone, only the nav bar does?\nMy phone is running the latest Chrome browser.\n. Guys, I just want to be able to stop uploads to the root volume.\nLike using the disabled option, but only for the root volume, not every folder/file in it (which is what that option does, I tried it)\n. @StudioJunkyard I am basically doing that, but I am talking about the root volume itself.\n. Users have access to lots of sub-folders, so ideally I don't want to be adding a root volume for each of the sub-folders :/\n. I tried this code, and when loading the page afresh, all folders and files under the root, are passed though the access control function, EXCEPT for the root itself! So this code it useless to me.\ne.g\n- ROOT <-- NOT passed through\n  - - a_sub_folder <-- passed through\n  - - a_file.txt <-- passed through\n  - - another_file.jpg <-- passed through\n. I don't see how, as I said, I tried it, and the root path was never passed through the function!\n. Yes, it is. But I do not understand how you have stopped uploads to the root, using the code above, when the code above does not pass the root volume path to it at any point!\n. I don't think you are understanding me.\nYou stated that accessControl can be used to set the read, write, locked and hidden options for the ROOT volume (the root folder that contains everything else. The same as Test Here on your test site)\nHowever, when I used the code you posted above, and I run the connector with a break point on the access method, the path of the ROOT volume is NEVER passed to the method, meaning it can NEVER be checked and its read, write, locked and hidden options can NEVER be set.\nI then asked how you achieved this on your test site, and you have simply failed to provide a clear answer and then just closed this issue.\n. @StudioJunkyard I tested it several times, and that method simply did not work for checking the root path. If I could take a screen capture, I would.\nThe method is passed all the various sub-folders etc, but never the root volume path.\n. @StudioJunkyard sorry but what are you talking about? Why would Windows stop one file path form being shown, when ALL OTHER files and folders (directly under the ROOT) be passed to the accessControl method, and block the ROOT path from being passed through?\nHint, IT WON'T\n. I understand PHP can behave differently under different OS environments, but what you mentioned simply is not the case. Just think about it. Why would Windows block the path of the root volume going through to a method?\nBoth you and @nao-pon have yet to actually show the exact code you are using.\nPlease provide your full connector script.\n. And your access method?\nAlso, put a breakpoint on your access method and load your elFinder. Check the $path parameter and see if it starts with the root volume (in your case, media) or if it starts with the first sub-directory under media\nEDIT - sorry, didn't see your method there hidden away. \n. Please, do the break point thing and show me the first read out of the variables captured by the access method. I want to see what you get when it supposedly shows the root volume parameters\n. I am using Google Cloud Storage by the way, as my main volume.\nHowever, I tried with a Local File system, and it's still not working. When I load the root volume, the first path that is fed through is for the .quarantine folder.\n. Just use yours. Put a break point on the IF statement and load the page. Then check the method variables. According to you and @nao-pon , the first $path variable (seeing as it is the root volume) should be, for you, something like /media/, with $attr being read\nOh, and please remove all the uploadDeny and uploadAllow settings. I am not using those, as @nao-pon stated I could just use the accessControl option, and, if it works how it is supposed to, setting the write option to false for the root volume should stop uploads to it.\n. I know what a ternary is, I just didn't see it in your code, I thought you were using the code @nao-pon posted, which has a long-hand IF statement, to check the $path variable.\nCan you post a screenshot of your break point info?\nAlso, what version of elFinder are you using?\nMy access method simply won't work the same as yours.\n. I am still having this issue.\nAs explained previously, using your exact code, the root volume path is never passed through to the accessControl function, hence it cannot be locked (to stop uploads).\n. public function accessControl($attr, $path, $data, $volume)\n    {\n        if (rtrim($path, \"\\\\\") === \"\\\\\")\n        {\n            return ($attr == 'write' || $attr == 'locked');\n        }\n    }\nI have tried over and over, and no matter what, when I click on a root volume (a google cloud bucket) it is 100000% NOT passed to the access control method. All files and sub folders are passed, but not the root volume.\n. I got it to autohide, but now when I swipe it open, I cannot swipe it closed\n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/2.1.12/js/elfinder.full.js#L2765\nGoing through step by step, with a break point here, sliding the nav bar, right to left, navhide is set, but not triggered.\nPretty sure the math is off.\non my phone, lastX = 168.17799377441406, x = 161.81300354003906, node width = 330\nSo\nif (Math.abs(168.17799377441406 - 161.81300354003906) > Math.min(200, (330 * .5))) {\n    alert('success');\n} else {\n    alert('fail');\n}\nAlert shows \"fail\".

Hence the navbar does not hide when swiping right to left.\n. Is this ready?\n. Typically, it's not in the documentation, https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options-2.1\n. Edited for you.\n. Also, to add to this (unless there is a solution already) can we check file extensions, rather then mime types? I want to allow users to add their own extensions to a deny list in a backend system, but they might not know the exact mime type for a particular file extension.\n. Is there anyway to use the client option onlyMime to deny file types right now?\nFor example, I want to hide files with extension exe in the file dialog window, but onlyMimes is a list of allowed file types as it stands.\n. How will the new check work? Is it a client option? And when will it be ready to roll out? :)\n. Hmm, no I don't.\nCould it be affected by some odd CSS?\n. Yea, this seems to be fixed if I removed a custom stylesheet. I'll have words with the frontend dev.\n. Do you have any more info on implementing this?\nSeeing as custom columns can be added easily enough with elFinder, extending the search should be via elFinder\n. To add to this, my second.custom column was.appearing at the end of the.columns, instead of being second.\nI ordered the columns in the.client options, a such\nCustom column 1, custom column 2, size, modified, type\nYea column 2 was shown last.\n. Your repo contains no connector.php file, which is what is referenced in index.html\n. On your demo site you do not have custom columns, like I do. So of coruse you see no issue on the demo site.\nAdd a custom column and you'll see what I mean (like my screenshot)\n. Please use 2 custom columns for a proper comparison.\nWhat version of elFinder are you using? I am using 2.1.14\n. Thing is, when I reported this issue and you said there isn't a problem on the demo site, 2.1.14 was the latest version at that time AND your demo site didn't show 2 custom fields.\nI'll try the latest version and see if that helps.\n. So this is what it looks like with the 2.1.16 nightly. I also added some content for the description column just to be safe.\nYou can see that the end column is totally borked and they are all misaligned.\nhttp://imgur.com/uImFtaP\n. OK, looks like the issue is a conflict with Bootstrap's CSS file.\n. The only solution was to have the elFinder window on a blank page and use an iframe to embed it into the bootstrap main site. Bit of a hack but it works. . The only solution was to have the elFinder window on a blank page and use an iframe to embed it into the bootstrap main site. Bit of a hack but it works. . @Joosakur You're right, the main problem here is that it conflicts massively with Bootstrap. I understand that it's a big ask to have something be compatible with someone else's work, but now the problem has been brought to attention, it'd be great if I didn't have to use an iframe to skirt the issue.. If I reorder them and refresh, how does elfinder know how they are ordered? Is it stored in a cookie?\nI want to reset the order just because I want to.\n. So is there an update? I'm using 2.1.13...\n. The folder definitely exists, because the testing was done in a matter of seconds.\n. Do folders need a specific mime type or something for elFinder to recognise it as a folder?\n. Hmm, that's what is is showing as. so I think there may be an elFinder issue?\nI have removed all other root volumes, and now it doesn't redirect. However, despite it showing the sub-folder contents, the sub-folder is not selected in the tree nav list.\n. Can you check with AWS?\n. You can get a free one, which is perfect for testing purposes.\n. I tried read, write and locked with all combinations of 0 and 1.\nFiles were only re-nameable when locked was set to 0\nNB setting write to 0 makes no sense anyway, if the file is un-writable, you shouldn't be able to rename it!\n. Here is a screenshot showing a file that has the following attributes:\nread = 1\nwrite = 0\nlocked = 0\nAs you can see, the rename icon is clickable (not muted/greyed out)\n. I am running this on a Linux server, connected to Google Cloud Storage.\nI have provided evidence that write does not effect renaming, and that renaming and delete are both connected to locked.\nThey need to be separated.\n. If that is the case, can you provide information on how to enable/disable certain toolbar icons based on specific file attributes?\nExample, if I give a file an extra attribute of rename = false then the rename icon only is disabled.\n. Just tested and it seems to work, thank you!\nAny chance of getting the docs/wiki updated with stuff like this?\n. 1. How are you specifically targeting the delete icon? How can I target other buttons?\n2. What do you mean by \"In addition, you will not be able to control show/hide state for each item.\"?\n. You really need to put this kind of stuff in the wiki rather then people ask and refer them to the source code.\n. I tried this, but I get a \"Forbidden\" error when Chrome tries to download the file\n.

I'm using 2.1.15.\nI am using the following for my bind functions\n'bind' => [\n    'open search' => [$this, 'add_file_data'],\n    'upload' => [$this, 'file_upload'],\n    'rm' => [$this, 'file_remove'],\n    'rename' => [$this, 'file_rename']\n]\nThe functions are doing basic things such as adding data to the DB.\n. What do you mean? I updated to 2.1.5 via Composer. I don't know what else to do?\n. Nevermind, think I sorted it. I'm using CodeIgniter, so I have to copy the PHP library files to the CI library folder\n. OK, I am now seeing / at the end of the log file. How do I declare the attribute settings?\ne.g. I want the root to be read only, no uploading or deleting allowed\n. Right, this is STILL not working.\nI just re-tested logging the results to a text file, and now the root path is NOT there.\nI tripled checked the accessControl callback and the root path ('/') is a 100000000000% NOT passed through to this callback. \n. So I did some testing, and as soon as I change the accessControl callback to \nif ($path === \"/\")\n        {\n            return ($attr === 'read' || $attr === 'locked');\n        }\n        return null;\nRather then just return null; the root path, / is not logged!. I got this working somehow on my local machine (Windows), but it is not working when deployed to a live server (Linux)\nI have used if ($path === \"/\" || $path === \"\\\\\") to cover both bases.\nOddly, on local, the root volume states Permissions: read, Locked: yes but the live server states Permissions: read and write, Locked: yes\nCould this be a caching issue (like we've seen before with elFinder)?\n. // for compat <= v2.1.13\nif (file.disabled) {\n    self.volOptions[file.volumeid].disabled = file.disabled;\n}\nSeems file.disabled is coming through as an array, so I think this is totally broken.

I have added that in, and I can still drag icons about, as if to copy/move them. Is there a way to fully disable the drag-n-drop feature?\nAlso, how do I upgrade from 2.1.16 to the latest version? The main elFinder JS file has been renamed and there are now seperate UI JS files?. Simply overwrite to upgrade? What about the fact that the main JS file is named differently? Guessing it is more then just overwriting?. It should not be uploaded to the server first, it should be streamed straight to GCS, surely?. elFinder can use FlySystem, which in turn can use the GCS adapter. So why wouldn't it be possible?. It does, I just told you it does. elFinder > FlySystem > GCS Adapter. So, despite using the elFinder FlySystem connector, FlySystem and finally the GCS FlySystem Adapter, elFinder still won't utilise the streaming capabilities of the GCS Adapter? \nWell, that is really unfortunate... \nDo you know of anyway to get this resolved? \nHonestly, I don't think I'm wrong to assume that streaming to GCS should work, seeing as I have the other components in play? \nIs this salvageable at all? . Yes I have, thank you. \nHmm, surely this should still work, as a chunked upload to the web server initially should work right? \nOtherwise, what is needed to utilise the GCS Adapter streaming methods? I assume they would work if I just used FlySystem without elFinder? \nSo how exactly would javascript hook into the streaming methods? If I can at least be pointed in the right direction I can look to see if it's even possible? . What if chunked uploads were disabled?. ",

Needed an sftp. So I started playing with phpseclib.  Wrote the following lines and I am able to view the folders, files in the elfinder.  Can download and preview. Defaulting to read and write as true.  If someone wants to take it further for copying,deleting files, etc.., be my guest. Here is the code. Also in your connector include this file called: elfinderVolumeSFTP.class.php an extension of the FTP adapter.  Not using passwords but RSA keys.  The variables in uppercase is what you should replace.  However, you will need to install the phpseclib.  I downloaded and installed it in the php folder of elfinder as phpseclib.\nMake sure you specify the array in the connector file.

Thanks Mark. Look forward to it.  Also wanted to use RSA keys as opposed to putting passwords in the connector's root array.

And another thing, when focus is outside elFinder, the arrow buttons in preview dialog does not work, however the fullscreen button still works..\n. It would be a great help if you can translate the Russian part of the document into English when it's stable enough.\n. The second one is from the document(https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-Server-API-2.0) , so it's not up to date I guess?\nHowever if URL means the baseurl from your root, it won't be necessary after \"init open\" a folder in a vol. For example, after I open \"Demo\", client already know that the base url for this volume is \"http://elfinder.org/files/demo/\". Then if I open \"Demo/Images\" (which is in the same volume), the base url won't be changed anyway, is this true? If so, why would server repeatedly returns the same options.url?\n. ",

Jip tested the concept. Thus my fix is more a fix for the wrong config. I changed config to point to the\nlocal file path from where the base dir must be for the browsing, I then pointed the tmbPath from that path onwards to where I want the thumbnails to be made (thumburl stays the same as it  is used for the links). in this case the thumb is one dir back from the root path, thus I made it ../thumbdir and it works.

However, if I do re-import for another reason, I will let you know if this works.  Thanks.\n. ",

Hi,\nI am experiencing the exact same problem in a .NET port of Elfinder 2.0 rc1. Uploading a file will generate the \"Invalid backend response. Data is not JSON.\" error message in IE8, while in IE9 there is no error but the \"Loading\" dialog box is never hidden and a page refresh is required to see the uploaded file. \nNo exception is thrown in the backend C# code, and the returned JSON is valid. Any suggestions?\nEdit: I have found out where the problem starts. In elfinder.js around line 1880 is the upload handling logic for iframe. This is what is used by IE, while Chrome for instance uses the upload handling logic for XMLHttpRequest around line 1970. Could there be a bug here? \nThe iframe.contents().text() object which is passed into the parseUploadData() method contains the following:\n\"The XML page cannot be displayed Cannot view XML input using style sheet. Please correct the error and then click the Refresh button, or try again later. Invalid at the top level of the document. Error processing resource \\'http://MyDevelopmentApp/api/connector.ashx\\'.

Finally found the answer, and it was so easy that I am embarrassed when I think about how long it took me to solve it.\nJust locate the Draggable options in elFinder.js (around line 465). Remove the appendTo parameter from \"body\" to \"\" (empty) and you're done.\nCheck out this blog post for more details and also how to leave the draggable functionality but stop the actual droppable event: http://blog.degree.no/2012/10/disable-drag-and-drop-in-elfinder-2-x/\n.

    "benkaminski": "May be ansley-bartolome021631 want a behavior like renaming files in Windows Vista/Widows 7. When you select file and press F2 - the filename in editable field selects without extension.\n. ",
    "StephenNeate": "Whilst this may not be the most elegant solution to the rename issue it is one way to solve it...\nIf you update the file elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php and insert the below inside the top of function \"rename\" line 1240 it will check against the original file name, use that extension so that even if someone renames the file to a new extension only the original is used.  (it will work if the file name has multiple periods in the name, and if the user wipes out the extension when they rename)\n```\n    // find extension from original file name by period\n    $extension = explode('.',$this->decode($hash));\n    // last value is the etension\n    $extension = array_pop($extension);\n// this is only needed if the file name is not submitted\n$newName = $name; \n// find extension from submitted value and remove it from string\n$name = explode('.',$name); \n// remove last value (being the extension)\narray_pop($name);\n\n// put the newname back together if the extension exists when submitted\nif( count($name)>0){\n    $name = implode(\".\", $name).'.'.$extension;\n}else{\n    // if no extension existed in rename return name with the original extension\n    $name = $newName.'.'.$extension;\n}\n\n```\nI hope this helps anybody else out looking to solve the rename security issue.  \nThe reason I call this a security issue is that someone could very easily upload a .txt or .jpg file which is actually a PHP file.  Then rename the file through the interface and gain additional access to the domain / server which most likely is not the desired effect for the standard usage of this great little file manager.\n. I agree that securing .php files is not a task for elFinder (and security is a large topic all by itself), but it never hurts to have some basic protection to stop users hurting themselves by accident.  Although just ensuring that files can't accidentally or intentionally be renamed to change their file type does not by itself guarantee security, although it cant hurt :)\n. ",

Do you have another public instance of elFinder running where I could try to reproduce the issue?\n. @nao-pon, thanks, I'm going to try to reproduce the issue with this.\n. @nao-pon, I tried to reproduce it, but it's not possible easily. Maybe the problem lies in our connector library (see the el_finder ruby gem). I'm going to investigate that and get in touch with you as soon as I've found something.\n. @nao-pon, it's definitely our backend which is causing the problem. I tested our frontend with the backend you provided me in the JSBin example earlier (see here) and it worked like charm.\nIn this case, I'm going to open an issue on the issue tracker for the el_finder gem. Thanks a lot again, you can close this issue IMO.\n. @nao-pon, it's definitely our backend, I just checked our code and figured out that we're not always sending the whole tree back to the client, even though we should. Your newest change wouldn't help in this situation, so IMO, you can close this issue as I'm going to fix this problem in our backend. \nThanks for your support and sorry about the unnecessary trouble.\n. @zzplab, no, we cannot use this plugin because we're using a ruby based backend (see here) and not the default PHP backend. Even though, this would not solve our problem since we're also offering access to the files via FTP. Users could still upload files with fishy names this way.\nWe would need a solution on the frontend which ensures that the filenames are properly escaped and not just simply written out to the title attribute the way they come from the backend.\n. We're still using version 2.0. And yes, you're right, after checking the newest version (2.1.13) I can confirm that this bug is really fixed, sorry for the trouble, next time I'm going to check the latest version BEFORE I open an issue. Thanks a lot!\n. @nao-pon, thanks for the quick response. Even after disabling / removing all customizations and plugins, it still doesn't work. I'm initializing it the as follows (note: I'm using coffeescript):\ncoffeescript\n$ ->\n  @el = $('#elfinder')\n  @el.elfinder\n    url: @el.data('elfinder-api-url')\n    lang: @el.data('i18n-locale')\n    transport: new elFinderSupportVer1()\nI cannot imagine what might cause the problem here. I'm including the elfinder.full.css and elfinder.full.js files from the release 2.1.13 zip. The problem is still the same, the ui-droppable class is missing on directories.\n. @nao-pon, I just tried the version 2.1.12 instead of 2.1.13, and it working. I saw that you made changes to the makeDroppable() function between 2.1.12 and 2.1.13 (see 695b0c5bd814221668c134c81f97aa5166bb5549). I'm not sure if this is the change which causes the problem.\nDo you have a public availably and running demo of the version 2.1.13 where I could debug the code? Cause the demo on the elfinder homepage uses the minified version and I cannot get it to run locally, even if I strip everything down to the bare minimum (jquery/jquery-ui and elfinder css and js).\n. @nao-pon, thanks again! I'll give it a try, maybe I can find what the problem is.\n. Ok, I've tried it out and if I copy all source which you were using in your JSBin example, it's working! But I currently really don't understand what's the problem here, because we're using jQuery in the version 1.11.1 and jQuery-UI in version 1.11.4, which are both sufficient according to the wiki. If I'm using the versions 1.12.0-pre and 3.1.1-pre respectively, it suddenly starts to work.\nI updated the JSBin example you provided earlier to use the exact same versions as we do and finally, I can reproduce the issue!\n@nao-pon, what do you think? Are the minimal requirements for jQuery and jQuery-UI to \"low\" for the new version? Or is it simply a bug which you were not aware of?\n. @nao-pon, thanks a lot! After testing the new version 2.1.14, I can confirm that this issue is fixed.\n. @nao-pon, thanks, your tip solved my issue. I would suggest that you extend the wiki page about client options to include this, what do you think? Or at least a page where you explain to me as a user of elFinder where I can find everything which can be overwritten via the configuration.\n. @nao-pon, exactly what I was thinking about. Thank you too for your excellent managing of the project!\n. @nao-pon, ok thanks for the answer. I'm going to try the nightly builds and upgrade as soon as you release 2.1.15.\n. ",

Hey, have you try this;\n$opts = array(\n    'debug' => false,\n    'roots' => array(\n        array(\n            'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',\n            'path'          => '../files/',\n        )\n    )\n);\nmake sure you have following folders:\nfiles\nsomefolder/connector.php\nyou need to edit you script in the html:\n<!-- elFinder initialization (REQUIRED) -->\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n        $().ready(function() {\n            var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n                url : 'somefolder/connector.php',  // connector URL (REQUIRED)\n            }).elfinder(\"instance\");\n        });\n    </script>\n. thats not the right way, you just need to define those options in head of your file where elfinder is loaded... like that:\n<!-- elFinder initialization (REQUIRED) -->\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n        $().ready(function() {\n            var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n                url : 'php/connector.php',  // connector URL (REQUIRED)\n                lang: 'de',             // language (OPTIONAL)\n                cssClass: 'explorer',\n                height: 450,\n                uiOptions: {\n                    toolbar : [\n                        // toolbar configuration\n                        ['open'],\n                        ['back', 'forward'],\n                        ['reload'],\n                        ['home', 'up'],\n                        ['mkdir', 'mkfile', 'upload'],\n                        ['info'],\n                        ['quicklook'],\n                        ['copy', 'cut', 'paste'],\n                        ['rm'],\n                        ['duplicate', 'rename', 'edit'],\n                        ['extract', 'archive'],\n                        ['search'],\n                        ['view'],\n                        ['help']\n                    ]\n                },\n                contextmenu : {\n                    files  : [\n                        'getfile', '|','open', '|', 'copy', 'cut', 'paste', 'duplicate', '|',\n                        'rm', '|', 'edit', 'rename', '|', 'archive', 'extract', '|', 'info'\n                    ]\n                }\n            }).elfinder(\"instance\");\n        });\n    </script>\nbody should look like this to load elfinder:\n<!-- Element where elFinder will be created (REQUIRED) -->\n        <div id=\"elfinder\"></div>\nbut keep in mind that you also need the jquery etc like in the example elfinder.html... pretty easy\n. but its not meant to include all that files manualy, if you download RC you dont have elfinder.options.js but elfinder.min.js with all that stuff in. Its not necessary and restricts updates in future use... anyway you have the old code in min.js and the one you need as standalone which can cause problems.\nSo the way its meant to be is the easy one to use the head script.\n. can you post roots array from connector.php?\n. you just need the folder sound in elfinder directory and there is a sound file in... \nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/tree/2.x/sounds\nworks for me, but is not included in official download. This is defined in elfinder.full.js/elfinder.min.js/elFinder.js:\n```\n    .bind('rm', function(e) {\n        var play  = beeper.canPlayType && beeper.canPlayType('audio/wav; codecs=\"1\"');\n    play && play != '' && play != 'no' && $(beeper).html('<source src=\"./sounds/rm.wav\" type=\"audio/wav\">')[0].play()\n})\n\n```\n. iam sorry, but i dont see a bug here, folder was just not included in RC1 from http://elfinder.org/. I just needed to include the folder, no code changes.\n. In the Wiki you found some root options for that.\nI set this in my connector:\n            'disabled'      => array (\n                    'download','rename'\n                ),\nThat works.\n. I think you got what you want, if you find the right pattern in attributes array for your file extensions to hide :) try and error is a good way :P\n. I dont found a real Solution to this Problem. \nCan anyone help me to fix the bug in the FTP Driver to support foldernames with space characters?\nThe Problem is just in the left Foldertree where those Folders missing the Arrow to expand or Dont be shown if the first Folder in List got a space Character. Without my Workaround explained above those Folders got no Content. So its usable but iam unlovely with it.\nPlease help me :)\n. mhm i tested to uncomment the whole cacheDir function, but the Problem with whitespace Character in foldername still exists.\nSeems to be the $path is wrong.\nSo the failure is not in line 335 in the cachedir function where i got the workaround to get the folders shown in mainwindow... the tree still is empty with that, thats the big problem.\nAgain how the wrong path for folders with whitespace characters is build:\n[Path to folder][Path to folder]/[file]\nIn example it looks like that in the FTP console:\n/Technik/untitled folder 2//Technik/untitled folder 2/Neues Textdokument.txt\nsome ideas would be awesome for usage of elfinder for my project. I cant use a Linux Filesystem :(\n. wow, big thanks for your solution, i will test it and give Feedback as fast as i can :) \n// amazing, this realy fixed this Problem :) Thanks again for your work, this helps me a lot.\n. Iam glad to hear that iam not the only one who stomble over these bugs and much better that someone is out there who is disposed to fix that. \nThe Problem i see is the Pull Request 474 with this, the FTP connector seems to need a new Fork to support Windows Filesystems in future releases... but i am expecting that support of windows is a big deal for elfinder. Other web based File explorers have bigger problems with so it should be possible to workaround the unicode problem with the FTP driver the right way.\nwhat i have seen, its not possible to get elfinders local filesystem driver to deal with unicode cause of transport data through JSON. But i dont have the best understand of this protocol..\n. You should download the nightly Build from here https://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder-nightly/blob/master/elfinder-2.x-7f59c13.zip\nThan you have to modify elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php like explained from fluidmindorg above.\nOr you test it with my file: https://mega.co.nz/#!UMkGQYBA!FGuPSn0RGukFGtY_ZvXnI2bZoq1Of-QoPIUiTUU7RxA\n. Great hint, thank you. Iam little bit busy with other projects and my elfinder works well. I will have a look at your solution soon. Thanks.\n. Iam working on this problem again, cause i need usage of contextmenue \"download\".\nI know the executed url, in example:\nhttp://myserver.de/elFinder/php/connector.php?cmd=file&target=f1_X0RhdGVucG9vbC12ZXJsb3Jlbi5qcGc&download=1\nthe download starts and the files are broken... txt files missing unicode chars, pictures and exe files cant be opened or executed.\nI found the download.js what creates some iframes..\nand to solve the unicode problem, i found this function from rfc2781\n// http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2781.txt\nfunction decodeUtf16(w) {\n  var i = 0;\n  var len = w.length;\n  var w1, w2;\n  var charCodes = [];\n  while (i < len) {\n      var w1 = w[i++];\n      if ((w1 & 0xF800) !== 0xD800) { // w1 < 0xD800 || w1 > 0xDFFF\n          charCodes.push(w1);\n          continue;\n      }\n      if ((w1 & 0xFC00) === 0xD800) { // w1 >= 0xD800 && w1 <= 0xDBFF\n          throw new RangeError('Invalid octet 0x' + w1.toString(16) + ' at offset ' + (i - 1));\n      }\n      if (i === len) {\n          throw new RangeError('Expected additional octet');\n      }\n      w2 = w[i++];\n      if ((w2 & 0xFC00) !== 0xDC00) { // w2 < 0xDC00 || w2 > 0xDFFF)\n          throw new RangeError('Invalid octet 0x' + w2.toString(16) + ' at offset ' + (i - 1));\n      }\n      charCodes.push(((w1 & 0x3ff) << 10) + (w2 & 0x3ff) + 0x10000);\n  }\n  return String.fromCharCode.apply(String, charCodes);\n}\nBut i cant find a place in download.js to get this working. Someone have idea for that issue?\n. You checked this: https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#wiki-sync ?\n. is it working without giving the 'lang' in client config?\nI got the same problem with de, but i have just changed the language js and now it works.\n. Iam using the FTP Driver and down and upload files up to 2GB without high memory usage. Firefox shows CPU 40% and RAM dont grow up.\nIam confused cause my downloads are not using the FTP connection, its just used for upload... but it works^^\nMy System:\nWindows Server 2008 R2, IIS 7.5, PHP 5.3 and Filezilla Server 0.9.41.\n. On a Linux Webserver you can use elfinder archive methods... on a Windows Webserver there is already a Feature Request to support winzip or winrar or something to do this.\n. I think php function ZipArchive would be best, like explained here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/ziparchive.extractto.php\nI will make some tests ...\n. I was able to get the archive feature working with 7-zip in ftp driver. But i cant extract...\nFirst you need the last elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php\nTo get it working i have filled some empty functions:\n_checkArchivers from elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php\n_archive from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\ntempDir from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\nftp_downloadFile from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\nftp_downloadDirectory from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\nftp_isDirectory from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\ndeleteDir from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\ntouchDirectory from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\nlistFilesInDirectory from https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/474\nin _checkArchivers change \"7za\" to \"7z\" everywhere in this function. Make sure you have 7z.exe and 7z.dll in %systemroot%\\system32 or SysWOW64. \nCause we cant make archives with gzip, bzip, zip and tar, we comment out the $arcs['create'] for that so we just make simple 7z Archives and dont get dropdown on toolbar to choose the archive-type.\nTo get extract working, need some fix in _extract and/or _unpack functions.\nI think to get it working with localfilesystem, you just have to change _checkArchivers function the same way.\n. // My last problem was IIS Webserver who needs access to the zip temp folder (IUSR). So i can make 7z Archives and extract zip, tar and 7z.\n. To get correct extract of archives, we have to change arguments from 7zip in elfinder:\nFollowing changes in the Function _checkArchivers:\n```\n    $this->procExec('7z', $o, $c);\n    if ($c == 0) {\n        $arcs['create']['application/x-7z-compressed']  = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'a', 'ext' => '7z');\n        $arcs['extract']['application/x-7z-compressed'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'x -y', 'ext' => '7z');\n    // if (empty($arcs['create']['application/x-gzip'])) {\n        // $arcs['create']['application/x-gzip'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'a -tgzip', 'ext' => 'tar.gz');\n    // }\n    if (empty($arcs['extract']['application/x-gzip'])) {\n        $arcs['extract']['application/x-gzip'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'x -tgzip -y', 'ext' => 'tar.gz');\n    }\n    // if (empty($arcs['create']['application/x-bzip2'])) {\n        // $arcs['create']['application/x-bzip2'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'a -tbzip2', 'ext' => 'tar.bz');\n    // }\n    if (empty($arcs['extract']['application/x-bzip2'])) {\n        $arcs['extract']['application/x-bzip2'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'x -tbzip2 -y', 'ext' => 'tar.bz');\n    }\n    // if (empty($arcs['create']['application/zip'])) {\n        // $arcs['create']['application/zip'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'a -tzip -l', 'ext' => 'zip');\n    // }\n    if (empty($arcs['extract']['application/zip'])) {\n        $arcs['extract']['application/zip'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'x -tzip -y', 'ext' => 'zip');\n    }\n    // if (empty($arcs['create']['application/x-tar'])) {\n        // $arcs['create']['application/x-tar'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'a -ttar -l', 'ext' => 'tar');\n    // }\n    if (empty($arcs['extract']['application/x-tar'])) {\n        $arcs['extract']['application/x-tar'] = array('cmd' => '7z', 'argc' => 'x -ttar -y', 'ext' => 'tar');\n    }\n}\n\n```\ni uncomment $arcs['create'] lines for gzip etc, cause i dont got it working.

We just need Archive Feature cause of easy up- and downloading whole folders.\nSo my archive and extract works fine now and i cant find bugs anymore.\nSo here is my new file:\nelFinderVolumeFTP.class.php (38 KB)\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!QEMx2L4K!A0IfKTk9FSuCosiVpQZdvHP0aMx8atAj20rxSMFv3mk\n. If you use webserver on a windows filesystem, make sure you have 7z.exe and 7z.dll in %systemroot%\\system32 or SysWOW64.\nYou did changes in _checkArchivers as explained in your used driver file? \n. If you work on a Windows Filesystem, you can have Problems with UNICODE Files. Files with i.e. \"\u00fc\" will not be visible. \nMy Workaround is to use the FTP Driver in the connector (works with Filezilla Server).\nIf your files have a dot at beginning, they will always be hidden.\n. You checked Jquery Scripts in your html head ?\nI use jquery 1.7.2 and jqueryui 1.8.18, make sure you dont use more than one Version on your Site.\nSorry, but i dont have more Ideas for your TinyMCE Problem, i think you have to figure out compatibility from elfinder and tinymce on your own. Would be nice if you document solution here on success :)\n. Its a Problem with PHP and Windows Filesystem. Try the FTP Driver to solve the Issue.\nYou can look at my Issues #443 and #446 there i explained the Problem more detailed. Its not a elfinder Problem :(\n. Its not just the filename, its the content too.\n. There are some more php commands:\nupload_max_filesize\nmax_execution_time\nmax_input_time\npost_max_size\nOn a Microsoft IIS Webserver you have to set requestLimit to 4294967295 (4.1 GB) in web.Config like that:\n<security>\n        <requestFiltering allowDoubleEscaping=\"true\">\n            <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength=\"4294967295\" />\n        </requestFiltering>\n    </security>\n. How big is your File? \nAre you using the LocalFileSystem as Root in connector.php?\nHow much RAM you have on your Webserver?\nFurther you have to add \"M\" for Megabyte or \"G\" for Gigabyte to upload_max_filesize and post_max_size like this:\nupload_max_filesize 1024M\npost_max_size 128M\nHave you set \"uploadMaxSize\" in connecor.php?\nYou tried to set memory_limit down to 1024M?\n. I think your Webserver dont use your PHP settings... can you proof your config with a phpinfo() in your PHP File?\nThe PHP Error says that the defined Memory Size of 128 MB is too small and he wants to allocate 2630 MB. Even if you set a Memory_Limit of 1024 MB it would not be enough.\nCan you test smaller Files of 1GB and 2GB ?\nI use the FTP Driver as Root in connector.php and i have nearly 0 RAM Usage for uploading large Files. I have not tested LocalFileSystem and usage of Large files now, but it seems the Files uploaded are stored in RAM completely and then wrote to HDD.\n. Oh, i dont know that the PHP Error is gone...\nSo, if i understand it right, you doubleclick on a File and nothing happend?\nWhat if you use the elfinder Download button?\nWhat if you use the Information Button and click the link or Right click and use Browser contextmen\u00fc to save target or open Target in new Tab? Can you proof the link to the file?\nI think your Problem is in connector.php: \n'URL' => dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) . '../../../home/public/', // URL to files (REQUIRED\nI think your url path is wrong. Make sure your Folder \"home/Public\" is defined in Webserver to access. Change the Path for testing to default and place a file there.\n. You tested direct link to the file? If it dont work it is not a elfinder Problem and you have to check your webserver configuration to get access to the link.\nI dont have more Informations for you.\n. Thanks i will test it tomorrow and will post my results.\n// I have tested the 2 new files, but then i got a Backend failed error all the time. With the old files it works except the bugs with space characters in foldernames in foldertree.\nSo i checked the Backend Failure happen for every modified line of code.\nLets start with elFinder-VolumeDriver.class.php:\n// Error seems to be from line 1991:\n$stat['date'] = isset($stat['ts'])\n        ? $this->formatDate($stat['ts'])\n        : 'unknown';\n// Also i got an Backend failure with line 3316:\nabstract protected function _save($fp, $dir, $name, $mime, $w, $h);\nLets go to elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:\n// Backend Failure happen with line 832:\nprotected function _save($fp, $dir, $name, $mime, $w, $h)\n// In old file i uncommented line 325 to get files and folders, its also necessary in the new file:\n$p = $path.'/'.$p;\nNow i tested the extract/archive function, but on Windows FIlesystem it dont works, it seems to be an update for Linux based Filesystems.\nIt would be amazing to get solution for my biggest bug in elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php in line 325 on Windows Filesystem. See my issue #445 for more Informations.\nThanks Guys and keep up the good work.\n. Thanks for your hint to the parseRaw function i will test some changes there to get better understanding for the Problem.\nBut i can work with the elfinder already, just got a few little bugs there. But all my needed functions for a webbased Filebrowser are working, so i just need to fix some little bugs.\nIf someone could help me for better support a Windows Webserver with elfinder it would be great.\n. your change from line 725 in elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php dont works to me, return $path; is correct.\nOther changes i made and also work to me i have wrote in #459. \n. As Workaround i would suggest a Setting like that:\n<!-- elFinder initialization (REQUIRED) -->\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n        $().ready(function() {\n            var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n                url : 'php/connector.php',  // connector URL (REQUIRED)\n                lang: 'de',             // language (OPTIONAL)\n                cssClass: 'explorer',\n                height: 450,\n                uiOptions: {\n                    toolbar : [\n                        // toolbar configuration\n                        ['back', 'forward'],\n                        ['reload'],\n                        ['home', 'up'],\n                        ['mkdir', 'mkfile', 'upload'],\n                        ['open'],\n                        ['info'],\n                        //['quicklook'],\n                        ['copy', 'cut', 'paste'],\n                        ['rm'],\n                        ['duplicate', 'rename', 'edit'],\n                        //['extract', 'archive'],\n                        ['search'],\n                        ['view'],\n                        ['help']\n                    ]\n                },\n                contextmenu : {\n                    files  : [\n                        'getfile', '|','open', '|', 'copy', 'cut', 'paste', 'duplicate', '|',\n                        'rm', '|', 'edit', 'rename', '|', 'info'\n                    ]\n                }\n            }).elfinder(\"instance\");\n        });\n    </script>\nin Connector.php:\n'disabled'      => array (\n                'download','resize','quicklook'\nSo they just can double click files ;)\n. i dont think its the problem cause download works and file size is correct. But if its a txt i can see the brokenm UNICODE char. In case of a .exe file it cant be executed anymore.\nyour article describes a failure with a downloaderror.\nanyway thanks for your reply\n. Whats the name of the first Folder that has to be shown there?\nIts possible to be the same Problem as postet from me in #445 ?\nYour Webserver is based on a Windows Filesystem?\n. Then i think you have to check your JQuery version. Try this:\n<!-- jQuery and jQuery UI (REQUIRED) -->\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" href=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.18/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css\">\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.min.js\"></script>\n. Whats your htaccess there?\nCan you try with other folder with one txt file and one new folder to test with?\n. I dont understand the question, the URLs are diferent in target:\nl1_Lw&tree=1&=135922707638 = First Folder\nl1_SW1hZ2Vz&=1359227280238 = Subfolder\nAnd tmburl ist just for the thumbnails temp-folder if a path contains pictures.\n// Ah ok.. you give both path the same url... \nURL means the baseurl from your root... your second one wont work.\n. can you drag and drop on ... mega.co.nz ?!\nSeems not a Problem from elfinder, its the damn IE ;)\n. First Question: Why you double Close Script Tag?\nSecond Question: url: 'scripts/files/connector.php' is at the right path?\nmhm i think your have some fails there...\nStart testing with standars settings:\n1. Download elfinder from here: https://github.com/downloads/Studio-42/elFinder/elfinder-2.0-rc1.tar.gz\n2. Configure a Directory you can access over http in your webserver\n3. extract the files downloaded there\n4. try to access the elfinder.html from your webbrowser\n. Ok, i have give you a default installation example above, but i think your fail is here:\n<!-- elFinder initialization (REQUIRED) -->\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n        $().ready(function() {\n            var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n                url : 'php/connector.php'  // connector URL (REQUIRED)\n                // lang: 'ru',             // language (OPTIONAL)\n            }).elfinder('instance');\n        });\n    </script>\ntry this.. iam missing your  $().ready(function() {\n. please check                 url : 'php/connector.php'  // connector URL (REQUIRED)\ninsert your path there, thats mine, sry\n. iam confused about your elfinder.js file in the script tag... in default its a elfinder.min.js. \nand why you change the default folder structure this way?\ndeal with default first, than modify if you want...\n```\n     jQuery and jQuery UI (REQUIRED) \n\n\n\n<!-- elFinder CSS (REQUIRED) -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" href=\"css/elfinder.min.css\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" href=\"css/theme.css\">\n\n<!-- elFinder JS (REQUIRED) -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/elfinder.min.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- elFinder translation (OPTIONAL) -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/i18n/elfinder.ru.js\"></script>\n\n```\n. than you got the wrong download, read my first post...\ndownloads on github are for developing and have to be builded first... for more information see https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki\n. i gave you the link for download in my first post...\n. come on guy^^ google is your friend.. so search for \"open tar.gz\"\nbut here is a tip: 7-zip\n. check your connector.php for correct root options\n. thats the wrong file... check \"connector.php\" for valid root options.\nhere are default root options:\n$opts = array(\n      'roots' => array(\n            array(\n              'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',   // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n              'path'          => '../files/',         // path to files (REQUIRED)\n              'URL'           => dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) .

I dont understand why there is an anchor to about in elfinder.html... \nHow you use the code in asp.net? have you found the asp connector on sourceforge? Iam bad at asp.net, but iam very interested in this solution.\n. Please try same like here: https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/504\n. ToDo:\nNeed to modify the javascript event which actually just handle the toolbar button span class \"elfinder-button-icon-open\" with one click\ndivs with the class \"elfinder-cwd-file\" should be handled same way, to get better usage on touchscreen devices.\nA client or connector option would be the best way to keep alive the nice double click feature for desktops.\n. Great thank you :)\nYou already solved the issue to use touchscroll? At the moment its impossible to scroll, cause there are no scrollbars.\n. i cant test it yet, but i would recommend to debug selected.mime on clicking a pdf. print to php log with error_log(selected.mime) maybe. if you know the string you can handle it :)\n. i think you are running on a windows filesystem (standard unicode problem)? what if you dont use special chars in filename? dont use a space character...\n. The download from contextmenu works different than from toolbar or with double click. I disabled the contextmenu entry, cause i got a UNICODE Problem with.\n. Download of files works the same way with FTP driver. So you should get the same result. Best workaround for this issue is to disable the contextmenu entry for download in client config.\ncontextmenu : {\n                    files  : [\n                        'getfile', '|','open', '|', 'copy', 'cut', 'paste', 'duplicate', '|',\n                        'rm', '|', 'edit', 'rename', '|', 'archive', 'extract', '|', 'info'\n                    ]\n                }\n. to prevent from contextmenue, look at client-config.. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#wiki-contextmenu\niam using this:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n        $().ready(function() {\n            var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n                url : 'php/connector.php',  // connector URL (REQUIRED)\n                lang: 'de',             // language (OPTIONAL)\n                cssClass: 'explorer',\n                height: 450,\n                uiOptions: {\n                    toolbar : [\n                        // toolbar configuration\n                        ['back', 'forward'],\n                        ['reload'],\n                        ['home', 'up'],\n                        ['mkdir', 'mkfile', 'upload'],\n                        ['open'],\n                        ['info'],\n                        //['quicklook'],\n                        ['copy', 'cut', 'paste'],\n                        ['rm'],\n                        ['duplicate', 'rename', 'edit'],\n                        //['extract', 'archive'],\n                        ['search'],\n                        ['view'],\n                        ['help']\n                    ]\n                },\n                contextmenu : {\n                    files  : [\n                        'getfile', '|','open', '|', 'copy', 'cut', 'paste', 'duplicate', '|',\n                        'rm', '|', 'edit', 'rename', '|', 'info'\n                    ]\n                }\n            }).elfinder(\"instance\");\n        });\n    </script>\nYou can also test this command option.. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#wiki-commands\n.

You compiled the github version on your own? if not, you have to or use the nightly builds.. https://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder-nightly\nor compile it on your own... https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Build-and-compress-elfinder-from-source\n. Feel free to use what you want, but the elfinder is the best opensource file explorer with the best customization you can find. And if you use other Version than RC1 you have to estimate some little bugs you are able to solve with the correct settings... so whats the point here?\n. Speak english\n. A good hint, thanks for that. \nBut iam confused cause there are no generally Problems with unicode folders, just with the root folder with unicode like i explained in my examples. so the utf8_decode/encode should already work.\n. Its funny, i can create a folder there, but not a new file. \nfunction _mkdir($path, $name) works -> I can use new fodler from toolbar\nfunction _mkfile($path, $name) dont work -> i cant use new file from toolbar\nSo whats wrong with that:\nprotected function _mkfile($path, $name) {\n    if ($this->tmp) {\n        $path = $path.'/'.$name;\n        $local = $this->tmp.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.md5($path);\n        $res = touch($local) && ftp_put($this->connect, $path, $local, FTP_ASCII);\n        @unlink($local);\n        return $res ? $path : false;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\nI also tryed utf8_decode without success. I cant debug $path and $local vars...i also tryed FTP_BINARY. I need to get knowledge of debugging elfinder -.-\n. Ok Guys, iam stupid^^\nI fixed this Problem in connector.php with easy make an utf8_decode on my foldername for 'tmbPath'.. why tmbPath blocks creation of files is little bit crazy, but it works.\n. Thank you for the fast help. I see you added the 2/3 of Window size part if connector dont give image dimension in file data. So whats the Problem with my image dimension data?\nCan i wait for a compiled version of this or i have to compile it myself?\n// This seems to be my real Problem with it:\n\n. I compiled latest version and now iam using the elfinder.full.js. Its great and your fix with window size works. Anyway there is the Question why elfinder cant get the file dimensions.\n. I found the real problem:\nin function _dimensions $path seems to be wrong. If i set a path to a file manualy here, i got the size in elfinder for this file shown correctly.\nAfter debugging $path, the content is filepath from root, but not the fullpath. So i corrected it with giving my rootpath. This works now, except for files in folders as symbolic links, but seems a problem from getimagesize.\nChange:\n    return strpos($mime, 'image') === 0 && ($s = @getimagesize($path)) !== false\nto:\n    return strpos($mime, 'image') === 0 && ($s = @getimagesize(realpath('../files/'.$path))) !== false\nInclude a utf8_decode for $path here, fixes problem with UNICODE names to me.\n. For FTP Driver we should use Image URL for getimagesize() than realpath, to support extern hosted FTP Servers. There are much many functions who already use local based functions (i.e. download a file just works with http download)\n. i dont understand the usage of this jake compile too, but iam working on to set up a linux system for me, but its horrible at VMWare -.- \n// This Ubuntu is stupid since v11... fedora works better.\n. After i compiled it myself, i can see the advantage from this concept. You can compress several files to one small file. And in development of this several files its easier to find the bugs or make some changes. \nSo i get a uglify min.js which is 50% reduced size to the compiled full.js.\n// i got a little problem to compile...\nuglify elfinder.min.js\njake aborted.\nTypeError: Cannot call method 'parse' of undefined\n    at null.action (/home/technik/elFinder/Jakefile.js:185:16)\n(See full trace by running task with --trace)\nThe uglify dont works to me.\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/409 fixed it for me\n// ok min.js is nearly empty now :( \nJust use nightly builds^^\nhttps://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder-nightly/blob/master/elfinder-2.x-7f59c13.zip\n. try this in connector.php\n```\nfunction logUpload($cmd, $result) {\n    $files = $result['added'];\n    foreach ($files as $file) {\n            $name = $file['name'];\n            file_put_contents(\"../files/logUpload.log\", date('Y-m-d H:i:s').\" \".$_SESSION['user'].\" \".$file['name'].\" \" . round($file['size'] / 1024) .\" KB \\r\\n\", FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);\n    }\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n    return true;\n}\n$opts = array(\n    'bind' => array(\n        'getfile upload' => 'logUpload'\n    ),\n```\nI tested this and it works :)\n. Sry i think nobody can help you with functions nobody knows ;) But this is a good example to show, how to bind functions to elfinder commands.\n. i dont understand why you dont work with a normal function...\n```\npublic function getUserId(user) {\nreturn $this->id;\n\n}\n$u = new User();\n$u->getUserId($_SESSION['user']); \n```\n. i think you could find the problem in connector.php or in your elfinder html where the jquery, elfinder.min.js and the language file is embedded.\nI have successfull setup with php 5.3 and following jquery:\n<!-- jQuery and jQuery UI (REQUIRED) -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" href=\"jquery/jqueryui/1.8.18/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery/jqueryui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.min.js\"></script>\njquery.7z (83 KB)\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!pdEwWRIK!b4lT9gRK4SLsC3pIgKK-mFQKrVNt0bXL5C1Ntqekhr4\n. Can you test php 5.3? I think you already checked your connector.php for incorrect path or something.\n. I will test php 5.4 with elfinder on my system\n// php 5.4.12 works to me\n. you can try to bind your function for this on extract command in connector.php\nBut you should better configure your webserver, that script files are not allowed to open or just open as plaintext.\n. Check this:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/459\n. Feedback would be nice. You are using a Webserver on Windows Filesystem too that #459 helps you to get it working?\n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-uploadMaxSize\nBut you can set limits in php.ini too.\n. than make usage of easy quota... in Windows it could be dirquota. Elfinder dont have a quota option.\n. Unicode Problem with Windows Filesystem, i was just able to fix this with use of the elfinder FTP driver and some elfinder options... \nIn your case, if the root folder dont have a unicode name, you can try this solution to rename special chars:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/466\nHere i wrote some informations about the problem:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/443\n. _checkArchivers is empty, so i cant use archive or extract without it. I filled it.\n_archive dont work to me, my archives are empty with this code.\nI try to make some tests in future, but actually my ftp driver works perfect to me like i posted in #459\nYour other fixes with space in name and sort localization seems fine.\n// if i want extract a archive, there comes a error message that temp folder is not a directory. I think its cause the folder  is named like that: elF5DEF.tmp.\nthis error is caused from this line in _extract:\n        $filesToProcess = elFinderVolumeFTP::listFilesInDirectory($tmpDir, true);\nI fix it without parameter true:\n        $filesToProcess = elFinderVolumeFTP::listFilesInDirectory($tmpDir);\nNow i got a error message that extract failed, but it works... And your new overwrite dialogue works too (senseless to get a \"no\" and a \"abort\" option, it results the same :P )\ni think i need hours of testing to merge your new stuff to my working ftp driver -.- Anyway thank you, you have build some interesting things there.\n. iam using a Windows Server 2008 as Webserver with Filezilla as FTP Server on. I used the archive and extract function from #474 and added a simple hardcoded quota in.\nBut your functions seems not to be that special for linux, except the detection of directory for temp dir.\nSry for that chaotic documentation all over the issues from me, but iam new to github and have to understand how i can post whole files and it changes.\n. Thanks for explain listFilesInDirectory, i think the symlinks could be my prob, i have some.\nI have now a own Fork of this Project where i will develop elfinder for my needs on Windows :)\n. mhm sry i just want to pull the german language file :(\n. if someone can tell me the problem to pull just one file? -.-\n. I use dynamic IP Security from IIS or dynamic .htaccess files with Apache to restrict access outside the root.within my login.php which detects IP from Client and give access only to the root folder.\n.htaccess looks like this:\n// Create new .htaccess here (for Apache Webserver)     \n    $file_array = array();\n    $file_array[0] = \"Options -Indexes\\n\";\n    $file_array[1] = \"Order Deny,Allow\\n\";\n    $file_array[2] = \"Deny from all\\n\";\n    $file_array[3] = \"Allow from \".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];\n    $filepath = 'files/' . utf8_decode($currentRootFolder) . '/.htaccess'; //decode for unicode\n    file_put_contents($filepath, implode($file_array), LOCK_EX);\nIf the user logout, the .htaccess will be deleted there and the .htaccess in /files is restricting all access\n. I know. but in my project its fine, cause every user got his own root. And yes if users would know it and try to break it with setting custom ips, its just a little chance they find the right folder who maybe have this IP set for. But your solution seems the right way, if it works^^\nThanks for the hint of this.\n. i dont understand the advantage of that feature\n. Ah ok thanks for the info\n. you can use in example dirquota on windows server\n. ```\n/\n * Calculate the full size of a directory\n \n * @author      Jonas John\n * @version     0.2\n * @link        http://www.jonasjohn.de/snippets/php/dir-size.htm\n * @param       string   $DirectoryPath    Directory path\n /\nfunction CalcDirectorySize($DirectoryPath) {\n// I reccomend using a normalize_path function here\n// to make sure $DirectoryPath contains an ending slash\n// (-> http://www.jonasjohn.de/snippets/php/normalize-path.htm)\n// To display a good looking size you can use a readable_filesize\n// function.\n// (-> http://www.jonasjohn.de/snippets/php/readable-filesize.htm)\n$Size = 0;\n$Dir = opendir($DirectoryPath);\nif (!$Dir)\n    return -1;\nwhile (($File = readdir($Dir)) !== false) {\n// Skip file pointers\nif ($File[0] == '.') continue;\n\n// Go recursive down, or add the file size\nif (is_dir($DirectoryPath . $File))            \n    $Size += CalcDirectorySize($DirectoryPath . $File . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);\nelse \n    $Size += filesize($DirectoryPath . $File);\n\n}\nclosedir($Dir);\nreturn $Size;\n}\n```\nThis function could be used for. bind it on upload command in connector.php\n. Make the function available in connector.php (paste there or include). Try to bind it on upload command in connector.php ;)\n$opts = array(\n    'bind' => array(\n        'upload' => 'CalcDirectorySize'\n    ),\n    'roots' => array(\nThe function will be called with $cmd, $result, $args, $elfinder. You have to rewrite the function on top ($DirectoryPath have to be changed) and check where to parse the DirectoryPath Info from.\n. Your array is wrong, you have to name it 'bind' and dont give the function own parameters, it will automatically called with $cmd, $result, $args, $elfinder like the wiki said. Further its not nested in the 'roots' area it is next to.\nSo build your $opts array like i posted above to call the function on upload\n. use php variable like $_SESSION for that and a login page to set it\n. with ajax you can modify the html of client side but not the php serverside which is needed. To modify the connector.php you have to set a variable in root which must be changed and reload the site. How you fill your php variable is your choice. you can easy integrate a button (form) in this windows and action goes to another php file who set your variable as you want.\nanybody correct me if iam wrong ;)\nIf its possible i think it would be a great security issue\n. I think you need a php function what the Server have to do on Click and modify JavaScript to get the contextmenu Option for.\n. You can test this:\n```\nprotected function cacheDir($path) {\n    $this->dirsCache[$path] = array();\nif (preg_match('/\\s|\\'|\\\"/', $path)) {\n    foreach (ftp_nlist($this->connect, $path) as $p) {\n        $p = $path.'/'.basename($p);\n        if (($stat = $this->_stat($p)) &&empty($stat['hidden'])) {\n            // $files[] = $stat;\n            $this->dirsCache[$path][] = $p;\n        }\n    }\n    return;\n}\nforeach (ftp_rawlist($this->connect, $path) as $raw) {\n    if (($stat = $this->parseRaw($raw))) {\n        $p    = $path.'/'.$stat['name'];\n        $stat = $this->updateCache($p, $stat);\n        if (empty($stat['hidden'])) {\n            // $files[] = $stat;\n            $this->dirsCache[$path][] = $p;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nOr check this:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/445\nWorks great to me.\n. If i upload a Video to Youtube with elFinder, where is the Video description defined?\nAnyway nice Work :)\n. Iam running elfinder in Server 2008 R2 64 Bit without problems... tested with Apache and IIS, PHP 5.3 & 5.4\n. i set the max execution time to 600 cause a upload, extract or archive needs some time and would be aborted if execution time arrives. Someone can correct me if iam wrong, but that was a result from my tests.\nSo here my spezial php settings for elfinder:\nupload_max_filesize = 4G\npost_max_size = 4.5G\nopen_basedir -> delete if exists\nmax_input_time = 600 (10 Minutes time for upload,extract or archive)\nmemory_limit = 512M\n. Can you check if .jpg mime is defined in your webserver settings? Can you test .bmp or .png or .gif?\nwhy you dont have thumbnails? webserver have access to the tmb folder? \"tmbPath\" and \"tmbURL\" is defined in your connector.php\ntested 'imgLib' => 'auto' ?\ntested 'mimeDetect' => 'internal' ?\n. You use the open-dialog box to drag in files, instead of using just the dropzone without the button upload?\n. Thats right, Drag & Drop with Folders dont work. Would be great to get this feature working.\n. can you make a pull request with your changes, nao-pon? I need to manually merge in my project. It will be hard for me to find the necessary changes in the whole files\n. i have not seen 2.1 till now, i have to check this in future weeks. thanks for your reply\n. Try following settings in your php.ini\nupload_max_filesize = 4G\npost_max_size = 4.5G\nopen_basedir -> delete if exists\nmax_input_time = 600 (10 Minutes time for upload,extract or archive)\nmemory_limit = 512M\n. Which Webserver you use?\nI need a web.config modification for my IIS called \"RequestFiltering\", who have restricted.\n<security>\n        <requestFiltering allowDoubleEscaping=\"true\">\n            <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength=\"4294967295\" />\n            <fileExtensions>\n            </fileExtensions>\n        </requestFiltering>\n    </security>\n4294967295 is maximum allowed number and as result, it restricts around 4GB now.\nFurther you can check the connector.php and if option uploadMaxSize not exists you can set it:\n'uploadMaxSize' => '4G'\n. i have opened the limit in my iis to max of 4,7 GB works fine\n. This is the minified Version of all the js files in Code Section.\nYou have to compile it on your own. Look at wiki.\n. you can copy content of all js files in one file manually\n. I use the unminified version too, works well.\n. I got it working for download with this:\nif ( $.inArray('download',this.fm.options.allowShortcuts) !== -1 ) {\n    this.shortcuts = [{\n        pattern     : 'shift+enter'\n    }];\n}\nNow use this for all other shortcuts\n// i have got this working for all shortcuts, i can try to make a pull request for all needed changes\n. Here we go https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/588\n. What means nothing? can you make a screenshot?\n. Ok thats right, you only get the popup if you select a item in mainwindow, not in the tree\nto get this working someone else have to help here, iam not able to do this.\n// Its funny, in contextmenu the function works for the tree\n. I have tested it, but now i get only informations from selected item in tree but i select item in mainwindow.\n. First of all, we need a new Connector Option \"category\" -> This is added in elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php and in protected $options.\nThen the maingoal is, that every Root who have set a categoryname as \"category\" option, will assigned to it in the tree....\nI stuck at this, seems to be a big part in the javascript to build the tree. \n. WWW_ROOT and FULL_BASE_URL are known variables?\ncheck default config (connector.php) with the \"files\" folder\n. wow good job, thank you very much. \nWorks great, only thing i would like are the icons on root too :)\nHere is a sreenshot from what is done actually:\n\n. your are right, restrictions are on content from root and not on root itself, so a icon is not good to display this way. Better to make it possible to choose a custom icon for roots in any way.\nthanks for your reply\n. thank you looks great, i can test this next week :)\n. Tested and works fine, but looks little bit faulty in tree if locked = true and write = false. In this case both icons are shown centered at the icon.\nits better to show locked icon in tree, if write or read is not false?\n. You are right, the Client Option \"dragUploadAllow : false\" dont work as expected.\ni have fixed it like this:\nif (this.transport.upload == 'iframe') {\n    this.transport.upload = $.proxy(this.uploads.iframe, this);\n} else if (typeof(this.transport.upload) == 'function') {\n    this.dragUpload = !!this.options.dragUploadAllow;\n} else if (this.xhrUpload) {\n    this.transport.upload = $.proxy(this.uploads.xhr, this);\n    this.dragUpload = true;\n} else {\n    this.transport.upload = $.proxy(this.uploads.iframe, this);\n}\nchange it to:\nif (this.transport.upload == 'iframe') {\n    this.transport.upload = $.proxy(this.uploads.iframe, this);\n} else if (typeof(this.transport.upload) == 'function') {\n    this.dragUpload = !!this.options.dragUploadAllow;\n} else if (this.xhrUpload) {\n    this.transport.upload = $.proxy(this.uploads.xhr, this);\n    if (this.options.dragUploadAllow != false) {\n        this.dragUpload = true;\n    }\n} else {\n    this.transport.upload = $.proxy(this.uploads.iframe, this);\n}\ni can make a pull request for\nHere it is:\nhttps://github.com/ChuckNorrison/elFinder/commit/8dda8ab8d956abb1c4ea080902fcba174ae1c644\nI dont understand the pull request system, he updated my other pull request with it... all my individual changes are now in https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/588 :(\nIf someone can explain me how to control that stuff to pull specified changes and not all, i can stop this chaos... iam sorry \n. OK seems the better solution :) I will test these branches in future, thx :P\n. Tested and works great, thanks again :)\n. FTP Driver is the only way if you use Webserver on Windows Filesystem\n. you fix the unicode content in files? I think its just a filename thing discussion here but not the real problem... please test it with exe file if its executable after download with elfinder.\n. you can make it on linux like explained in the wiki, but i got problems with it too and cant build the minified version with it.\n. this is restricted to the read attribute in root options. You can set a pattern matching the files you want to restrict.\n'attributes'    => array(\n                array(\n                    'pattern' => '/.+/', // Read+Write Settings for all Folders and Files\n                    'read'  => true,\n                    'write' => true,\n                    'locked' => false\n                    )\n            ),\n\n'attributes'    => array(\n                array(\n                    'pattern' => '/.(Name123|Name\\.[A-z0-9\\.\\-\\ \\\u00e4\\\u00c4\\\u00fc\\\u00dc\\\u00f6\\\u00d6]+)$/', // Access for Folders and Files named \"Name123\" or \"Name.*\" without subs\n                    'read'  => true,\n                    'write' => true, \n                    'locked' => false\n                    )\n            ),\n\n'attributes'    => array(\n                array(\n                    'pattern' => '/.(Name123|Name\\.[A-z0-9\\.\\-\\ \\\u00e4\\\u00c4\\\u00fc\\\u00dc\\\u00f6\\\u00d6]+)/', // Access for Folders and Files named \"Name123\" or \"Name.*\" with subs\n                    'read'  => true,\n                    'write' => true, \n                    'locked' => false\n                    )\n            ),\n. If you set read to false and use the exact name with filetype like name1.png then just name1.png is restricted, or not?\n. Sorry i cant help you with this :(\n. check your  jquery\n. fine you have resolved your problem already...\nThis DTD contains all HTML elements and attributes, but does NOT INCLUDE presentational or deprecated elements (like font). Framesets are not allowed.\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp\n. you try to create archive? if you cant, i think you have to allow 7z.exe (Windows Server) in php.iniand place it with dll in system32 to get it run with your elfinder which dont use fullpath for.\nDont know how to allow \"7za\" on Linux Server with your php.ini (you found the parts in your volume.class.php)\n. 1. search for 7za in your volume driver php file. \n2. replace 7za with 7z.exe\n3. download 7-zip for windows\n4. copy 7z.exe and 7z.dll to your system32\ni posted the code here:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/661\n. Other archives are working? If not, you installed 7-Zip? You need the 7z.exe in your Systemroot. Further its needed to edit the right volume driver. In my Example i worked with the FTP Driver. In your case possible the localfilesystem driver.\nCheck if you can use 7z.exe within php. to test 7-zip with php use this in i.e.:\nexec(\"7z x -trar -y -oc:\\\\youroutputdir c:\\\\yourarchive.rar\", $result);\nprint_r($result);\n. on which filesystem is your webserver running? On NTFS the json get UTF-16 in and konvert in UTF-8. At this step special chars or unicode chars will be broken. Only solution i found is to use a ftp server and the ftp driver.\n. i would recommend to archive the folder first and then download the archive.\n. check the nightly build from nao-pon\nhttps://github.com/nao-pon/elFinder-nightly\n. Here the function who create the filename:\n```\n/**** thumbnails *****/\n/\n * Return thumbnail file name for required file\n *\n * @param  array  $stat  file stat\n * @return string\n * @author Dmitry (dio) Levashov\n /\nprotected function tmbname($stat) {\n    return $stat['hash'].$stat['ts'].'.png';\n}\n```\nFound in elFinder.Volumedriver.class.php\nThe array $stat is build i.e. in the elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php in the Function _stat($path).\n$stat looks like this:\n$stat['mime']  = 'symlink-broken';\n$stat['read']  = false;\n$stat['write'] = false;\n$stat['size']  = 0;\n$stat['alias']  = $this->_path($target);\n$stat['target'] = $target;\n$stat['ts']    = filemtime($path);\nIn Function updateCache($path, $stat) the $stat['hash'] is filled (Found in elFinder.Volumedriver.class.php)\n$stat['hash'] = $this->encode($path);\n\nAfter all that foundings you finally just need array with 'hash' and 'ts' like this:\n$s['ts']    = filemtime($path);\n$s['hash'] = $this->encode($path);\nthen you have your thumbnailname $s['hash'].$s['ts'].'.png';\n\nOther Solution could be use of gettmb($path, $stat) Function in elFinder.Volumedriver.class.php\n. this is fixed with #266. Android 2.3 not supported.\nThanks\n. php ssh2 seems not a great solution to get a secured connection. but this could be an option: http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/\nbut if your webserver is the same as your ftp server, it dont cares, cause its not visible in network. I dont tested different server for ftp yet. i think there are some other issues in that case...\n. I will test this soon. \nSame usage in connector.php like the old ftp driver? Cant find host user and pw in your init function\nbtw. I would recommend you to check my elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php. Yours is buggy in many ways.\n. There isnt any special in elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php, just some missing stuff like categorys, icons  and bugfixes like unicode problems. anyway it doesnt matter, should work too. Thanks for your work ;)\n. with ftp driver the problem should not exists on windows filesystem and unicode\n. my thumbs are working fine, its not a bug. You have to check you connector config and webserver config.\nhere example how it should work.. your path seems wrong\n'tmbPath'      => '../files/ftptmb',\n 'tmbURL'       => dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) . '/../files/ftptmb',\n 'tmpPath'       => '/../files/tmp',\n. fluidmindorg have posted a real working solution in #445 \nIam using FTP Driver in productive environments and it did well after tweaking a bit. You can find a working driver in my repo: https://github.com/ChuckNorrison/elFinder\n. Try connector configuration \"attributes\"  \n'attributes'    => array(\n    array(\n                'pattern' => '/.(Pictures+)/', // Access for Folders named \"Pictures\" and his subfolders\n                'read'  => true,\n                'write' => true, \n                'locked' => true\n    );\n),\nWith that connector config you can read, write, but not delete cause its locked\n. Here is a example how i log upload of files with the bind method\ntry this:\n```\nfunction logUpload($cmd, $result) {\n    $files = $result['added'];\n    foreach ($files as $file) {\n            $name = $file['name'];\n            file_put_contents(\"../files/logUpload.log\", date('Y-m-d H:i:s').\" \".$_SESSION[\"username\"].\" \".$file['name'].\" \" .     round($file['size'] / 1024) .\" KB \\r\\n\", FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);\n    }  \n    return true;\n}\n$opts = array(\n    //'debug' => true,\n    'bind' => array(\n        'getfile upload' => 'logUpload'\n    ),\n    'roots' => array(\n```\n. I think uploadDeny dont accept the option \"all\". you try not to use uploadDeny? \nFurther you have to set the options in the roots array.\ni think this could work:\n$opts = array(\n    // 'debug' => true,\n    'roots' => array(\n        array(\n            'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',   // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n            'path'          => $_SESSION['path'], //'../files/',         // path to files (REQUIRED)\n            'URL'           => $_SESSION['outputPath'], //dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) . '/../files/', // URL to files (REQUIRED)\n            'accessControl' => 'access'             // disable and hide dot starting files (OPTIONAL)\n            'arc'         => '7za',\n            'uploadAllow' => array('image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/gif', 'application/zip')\n        )\n    ), \n);\n. Same issue with safari browser on windows os?\n. with no informations i cant find the problem ;)\nyou try using elfinder with default settings? then the failure have to be in your webserver configuration... no permissions on the files folder?\n. invalid backend response happens if webserver dont have access to the \"../files\" folder.DATA is not JSON can happen if you have problems with UTF-8 charset i think...\n// you use mysql driver? sorry i dont have experience with that driver... i think i cant help you with this.\n. you can search your php.ini for the option \"default_charset\". In my case this is not active, but it could be a problem if it is set to other charset than utf-8.\nyour html file which elfinder loads, the head needs this:\n    \nbut i think the problem is in the permissions from the files folder...\n. in Windows and IIS Webserver the user IUSR needs fullaccess to the folder files in ntfs rights management... In windows and xampp there is no change needed.\nin linux and apache... i dont know. what webserver and operating system are you using?\n. I can define which file extensions are allowed in my webserver config (IIS Windows)\nFurther you can use connector options:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-uploadAllow\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#wiki-uploadDeny\n.

You have to look whats up with \n$this->load->model(\"Mod_grupo\"); \n$dados['conteudo'] = $this->Mod_grupo->retorno();\nits unknown for me. function retorno() returns more than expected if i got it right. Check the failure there. Its not elfinder part. So the question of multiple roots got answered i think.\n. then driver in roots seems not exist... too much informations here\n. I would see the failure in system of ios than in elfinder. i would suggest to open a ticket in a apple dev board for this problem.\n. i would suggest following connector option:\n'treeDeep'      => 1\nIam using more than 10+ multiple roots and it works fine, till i open a folder with 1000+ subfolders.. then my local browser eats 200mb ram for 2 -3 min and freezes.. then it works. but i think thats another problem to workaround.\noptional you can check connector option:\n'checkSubfolders' => false\n. With one root -> connector.php needs 1,60s\nWith 11 roots -> connector.php needs 1,80s\nBut my connectore.php is really huge and i build many loops to mount roots dynamically...\nAnd iam using a tweaked ftp driver on windows file system... if you are interested in, check my repo: \nhttps://github.com/ChuckNorrison/elFinder\n. Which language?\n. Give me a moment :)\n// It works great, thanks\n. i tested with files in root, cause how should i access files outside of the mounted root (except with hardlinks and faulty webserver config..  that would be a big security issue)\n. you have defined tmp and url options in connector.php? your webserver have access on the folder?\n// i think you should set following options:\n'tmbPath'\n'tmbURL'\n'tmpPath'\n'imgLib'        => 'auto',\n'mimeDetect'    => 'internal',\n. unicode chars got escaped. could also be done with htmlspecialchars with php... \non which webserver you run elfinder, windows or linux? If windows, there is no solution with localfilesystem driver, then you should use ftp driver. But the default ftp driver here is little bit useless, i got a good working one. On Server i use filezilla.\nIf you have a linux webserver, you should check charset in php.ini and charset in meta tag\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n. iam using 2.0rc and got many problems with localfilesystem driver and webserver on windows filesystem. Seems the same problem... i dont know.\n. This feature is deprecated and not available till PHP 5.4. So my hint to the php.ini wasnt that bad :)\n. Its not really a failure, cause there is a seperate function \"dublicate\". \nThe correct way would be to use the function in case of copy & paste in the same folder for renaming the right way... but i didnt test your solution yet.\n. In your message the $1 in my case is the file/folder name.\ncopy / paste is working fine if you paste in different folder. The only better solution for the same folder than the message (which is not wrong) would be to rename the file automatically like dublicate function would do it. \nYour solution works like this?\n. Ok i tested it, great job it works well like it should be :) Sorry for misunderstood\n. I would recommend to use following options in your connector.php\n'tmbPath'\n'tmbURL'\n'tmpPath'\n'imgLib' => 'auto',\n'mimeDetect' => 'internal',\n. you can work with connector.php as you want\n. You have to build a loginsystem around elfinder... \n. thanks for implementing jQuery UI Touch Punch. I will test the drag and drop soon, but as i see  the selectable function of the UI is much more interesting on elfinder. Usability of file selection on mobiles is horrible.\n. looks interesting, i worked with filezilla, but love to use FTP with IIS. I will test it, thanks :) \n. ",

Any way to upload large files using elfinder as increase all the necessary setting in php to upload large files but nothing work .\nThanks\n. ",
    "staticint": "$('<div/>').dialogelfinder(opts) worked without issues.\nThanks.\n. I should mention this is using a site with https.\n. So it looks like 0x0AFF is being tacked on to the front of the file during download.  Upload doesn't have this problem.\n. Ok so it is actually only one extra byte in the beginning of the file 0x0A and it is on all non-text files.  The controller is the default one i.e. latest on github.  The php file I use to start the controller has no extra spaces at the bottom of the file.  I am running multiple instance of elfinder2.0 on the same page but I haven't checked to see if reducing the number of instances to 1 makes a difference.  I have tried to simply write the file out in the function:\nprotected function _fopen($path, $mode='rb'){  ...  } which is found in the /php/elfinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php file\nI have tried fpassthru and fread inside the function and the 0x0A is still attached to the front of the file. However if I hex dump the file on the server the 0x0A is not there.\n. so it turns out 0x0A means newline.  Now where is it.\n. So it turns out that 0x0A was from a newline inserted by the old file manager we were using.  Once I replaced it completely life was good.  \n:) cheers\n. Is this different then ticket #209?\n. Unless there is good reason the click event for cwd should not stopImmediatePropagation to allow plug-in functionality on file click events.  Changing the code in the click event to stopPropagation has the effect of stopping click events up the chain while still allowing click events on the file elements.\nUse case.  Custom api plugin does some updating/preprocessing when a file is selected.  This happens by checking the filesSelected() object in elfinder.  Allowing a click event to be appended to elfinder-cwd element ensures the filesSelected() object is updated before processing.  If stopImmediatePropagation is used then the preprocessing never happens.  However with stopPropagation the preprocessing happens and events do not propagate further up the chain.\n. For the first pull request the Idea is that disabled commands should be per instance as you stated but they are not.  When I use the disable option for a command in one instance but include the command in another instance the command is included in both instances.  i.e. the disable option is ignored in the first instance.  \nThis is using the disable option, not the command list option. \nhttp://elrte.org/redmine/projects/3/wiki/Connector_Configuration_EN#Disable-commands\n. So is the disabled option in the client not supported in 2.x?\nSimple test case is to add disabled:[] to options.  Command will still appear if the command file is included.\nAs for the second pull request, the handler options worked much better.  Thanks for the info.\n. So why not allow disabled commands in client?  It is only three lines of code and is alot easier for when only one command needs to be disabled.\n. Hmmm... So if I want to disable one command, say archive for example then I have to do.\ncommands : [ 'open', 'reload', 'home', 'up', 'back', 'forward', 'getfile', 'quicklook','download', 'rm', 'duplicate', 'rename', 'mkdir', 'mkfile', 'upload', 'copy','cut', 'paste', 'edit', 'extract','search', 'info', 'view', 'help','resize', 'sort'],\nIt seems much more user friendly and no extra required functionality to say:\ndisabled:['archive'];\n. I would also argue that this is not duplicate functionality.  Commands allows the addition of new commands.  Disable allows the disabling of default commands.\n. ",

    "bawNg": "JSONP unfortunately has no advantages over JSON AJAX requests with a modified same origin policy. WebSockets are a lot faster, I hope to see this feature implemented in the near future.\n. I would never consider using PHP for such a backend personally, I use a ruby EventMachine based WebSocket server. \nThough I am sure there will be solution for PHP eventually, if there is not one already, I suggest implementing the client-side support first, with a fallback to AJAX for servers that do not support WebSockets.\n. I'm sure some do, most that I use edit by default, which is the most common action. Why has this been closed?\n. I was thinking of an option that allowed you to specify something like \"window\", \"preview\" or \"edit\". But a callback will work, as long as you make sure the internal API that opens files with the default window, preview pane and editor are exposed.\nThanks\n. ",

Press F12 and found out where the black color is coming from. I cant think of any other sulotion right now.\n. it seems i glitched over this part. Thanks a lot.\nregrads\n. take a look at pattenrs:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options#general-usage-example\nnot sure if its usefull but this was my first thought\n. made a work around in the elFinderConnector like this:\nsetlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE');\nfunction array_walk_deep(&$items){\n    foreach ($items as &$item) {\n        if(is_array($item)) {\n          array_walk_deep($item);\n         } else {\n            if (!strpos($item ,'\u00f6')) {\n                $item = iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT', utf8_encode($item)) ;\n            }\n}\n}\n}\narray_walk_deep($data);\nchanges \u00f6-> oe this actually works for now. \n. usually elfinder automaticale renames the file \"filename-1\" -2 -3 so on..\n. the thing is its recognized as button click, ill get ti the part where the header is sent. Strange problem.\n. it seems that its getting slower with every root that i add. With only 1 root directory im at 90-123ms while navigating trough the structure. But if i include one more it gors up to 230 , almost double u could say.\n. how many ms are your requests long? im still far away from 80-90 like on the elfinder site. Even thou im using the localsystem driver\noh and isnt  'treeDeep'      => 1 default setting anyhow?\nedit:\nto be honest i dont feel any change when i set treedeep to 1 or treedeep to 7\n. in the localfilesystemdriver:\n```\nprotected function _save($fp, $dir, $name, $stat) {\n    $path = $dir.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$name;\nif (!($target = @fopen($path, 'wb'))) {\n    return false;\n}\n\nwhile (!feof($fp)) {\n    fwrite($target, fread($fp, 8192));\n}\nfclose($target);\n@chmod($path, $this->options['fileMode']);\nclearstatcache();\nreturn $path;\n\n}\n```\ni guess in the $path is what you are looking for, i think there should be the path to your image, after its returned u just call your own function if the extension is jpg? or when ever you need it\n. are your files inside the root directory our outside? cause it seems i found the problem... \ni need to set the URL => '' to make it work, but i cant do that for files outside of root :S\n. i made it work :D\nbut imo isnt better that the files are outside of the root directory so they cant be hotlinked? instead making a get_file.php?=test.png     and then in the php file i just make the full path and read the file?\nbtw thats how i did it now.\nanyhow office reader cool tool isn it?

My idea was writing tests which will always be run when something was modified to assert that some properties/functions of elFinder like the width of the window, the position of some elements or creating a folder has the correct values/expected values. If it fails a warning would be sent to let one knows that something went wrong.\nIt is also possible to test APIs and not only UI elements. The other thing is, if the automated tests can be written in JS, would it be more interesting for your team?\nAm 28.06.2012 um 14:41 schrieb Troex Nevelin:\n\nHello, I've seen your email and this pull request. I like idea of unit tests for elFinder but I need to say nobody in our team have ever used PHPUnit, and I hardly understand what you are trying to test. Also PHP code looks very cozy to me and as I understand this intends to run elFinder in browser and test some basic user behaviour? If it is so it's definitely not we want to.\nAlso PHP is secondary importance language in elFinder, so any build/test code should be written in javascript/nodejs, like your build system.\nIf someday we would like to write tests for elFinder, they would test first our json API because PHP is only one of many other connectors. I have no idea how we would test js ui, but we probably take a look how it's done in jquery and other major js projects.\nCurrently we don't have time and manpower to write and maintain unit tests so I can't pull your request.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/314#issuecomment-6628711\n. Hi,\n\nI have thought about your comments according to JSON API testing. \nThere is a programming language called cucumber which provides readable code for unit testing. I would like to support elfinders project in writing tests in cucumber for testing elfinders' json apis.\nI also would like to support the project for a longer term.\nWhat do you think about it?\nAm 01.07.2012 um 15:51 schrieb Troex Nevelin:\n\nIt's a hard question, because we never used unit testing, so we lived and programmed for many year without it and I don't think we will just start doing it. In total our team spent not more than 10 man hours a week working on elFinder, and there is a lot of more important things to do from our view and we are absolutely not ready to implement it our self.\nIf you have interest, want write and maintain unit test code that is great and we can cooperate this way, but if this is one time commit I don't see any profit for elFinder\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/pull/314#issuecomment-6693611\n. \n",

OK Naoki, \nI think that it work as expected but I am not soo lucky. Why? You used 3rd party library which is dependent on another 3rd party libs.\nIn final Dropbox 2 driver needs next 125kb + 655kb depend source code. Ohh. \nIn my another project I used very simple DropBox 2 class with 25kb of size: \nhttps://github.com/f4bsch/DropPHP/tree/api-v2 , without dependencies.\nI understand that its very very simple use 3rd party code, but solutions like this is very expensive for any project. \nKunnu DB lib is very early version v0.1.x ! Looks good how complex it is, but is it needed for EF?\nWhen developers will using solutions like this, their projects will looks like big pile of mess. \nFor only one functionality its to much code and files.\nOtherwise thank you for your very good work.. Thats nice, but images are always stored remotely. I want copy images to local files storage after I choose it.\n. Is anywhere some example howto do it automaticaly after I choose any remote image? Please.\n. Not processed by : .done(function(copy, paste)\nI tested file from Dropbox.\nPasted file nowhere.\n. I found what is the problem.\nvar localId = 'l2_'; //l2_\nvar localTargetHash = localId + 'Lw'; // 'Lw' = '/' = root\nYou wrote example for fixed second local location. \nI changed for my locations, but it is not dynamically. Its fixed. And mainly localTargetHash is different manytimes.\nWhat about solution copy it to temp folder and get it from there?\n. I can confirm another issue. After I close jQuery dialog and in \nonclose event I destroy elfinder instance by elfinder.destroy(); elfinder instance still exists.\nAfter I reopen / reinitialize elfinder I miss search box on top right place.\nAnd more functionality is broken, now I see that no right scrollbal not visible, etc.\n\n. My code is like this:\nvar wHeight = jQuery(window).height();\n    var fmHeight = wHeight * 0.85;\n    filemanagerDialog = jQuery('<div id=\"filemanagerDialog\"\\>').dialog({\n        modal: true, \n        width: \"85%\",\n        height: fmHeight,\n        title: \"\", \n        zIndex: 99999,\n        create: function (event, ui) {\n            if(elfinder) {\n                elfinder.destroy();\n                elfinder = null;\n            }\n            elfinder = jQuery(this).elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\n        },\n        close: function(event, ui) { \n            if(elfinder) {\n                elfinder.destroy();\n                elfinder = null;\n            }\n            filemanagerDialog.dialog(\"close\");\n            filemanagerDialog.remove();\n        } \n    });\n.

Please install PHPStorm EAP version which is free and after \"Inspect code\" you will see many many warnings which is good to fix it. Before Inspection is good to install some PHP plugins in PHPStorm settings. Coding with this IDE is really funny. Believe me.. Great. Install this Settings -> Plugins: \"Php Inspections (EA Extended)\", it will find many other warnings and bugs. And please be carefully, sometimes IDE wants to help fix it automatically by button(with yellow bulb) when you browse Inspector results , but some auto-fixes works bad. Soo it is good to find issues and fix it by recommendations but by hands.\nFor example: Inspection recommend replace == to ===, but at some situations code types are not strict and code can stop work properly., etc...\nAny help in future is not problem from me. I believe that you will like it and never use other IDE.. And I forget, that you can get free license of phpStorm when you work on open source.\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/\n. Please make another changes on all extract(...) like this example:\n/**\n* @var string $quotedPath\n* @var string $coalesce\n* @var string $interlace\n* @var string $deconstruct\n* @var string $quotedDstPath\n*/\nextract($this->imageMagickConvertPrepare($path, $destformat, $jpgQuality, $s), EXTR_OVERWRITE);.

But it adds DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR to the end of 'path'.  If you are on windows and use forward slashes, it would be comparing, for example, '../root\\' and '../root/folder' and returning false.  On a linux server I assume it would only work correctly if forward slashes are used.\n. ",

Hi Chuck. I have a fix for the problem this script has with names containing spaces.\nFirst, you're correct commenting out line 325 (it's 325 in the RC1 copy anyway, might be different in your copy) does not fix this problem. However, there IS a problem with line 325: the FTP server is returning the full path to the file, but the code is assuming that it has only returned the filename. So, rather than commenting out line 325, change it to this:\n$p = $path.'/'.basename($p);\nDon't do the same thing to line 335, since $stat['name'] is, indeed, only the filename.\nHowever, do go down to line 624 and add the basename around $p there:\nif (($stat = $this->stat($path.'/'.basename($p))) && $stat['mime'] == 'directory') {\nNow to fix the true culprit here:\nIn the parseRaw() method (at line 228), each line of the raw text directory listing from the FTP server is being split into its parts at each space ( preg_split(\"/\\s+/\", $raw, 9) ). That, of course, splits file names that have spaces in them. A far more robust option is to use a nice regular expression for those lines.\nCurrently, lines 228-240 look like this:\n```\nprotected function parseRaw($raw) {\n    $info = preg_split(\"/\\s+/\", $raw, 9);\n    $stat = array();\nif (count($info) < 9 || $info[8] == '.' || $info[8] == '..') {\n    return false;\n}\n\nif (!isset($this->ftpOsUnix)) {\n    $this->ftpOsUnix = !preg_match('/\\d/', substr($info[0], 0, 1));\n}\n\nif ($this->ftpOsUnix) {\n\n```\nReplace ALL those lines with the following:\n```\nprotected function parseRaw($raw) {\n    $stat = array();\n/*\n * Check to see if what was returned matches a standard unix ls listing\n */\nif (preg_match('/^([a-z\\-]{10}) +(\\d+) +(\\w+) +(\\w+) +(\\d+) +(\\w+) +(\\w+) +([\\d\\:]+) +(.+)/', $raw, $info)) {\n    $this->ftpOsUnix = true;\n\n    // Remove the regex pattern in the first element of the array\n    array_shift($info);\n\n```\nAlso, to fix another bug that might (depending on the FTP server) cause the modified times to be reported as \"unknown\", in the _stat method, look for these lines:\nif (is_array($raw) && count($raw) > 1 && substr(trim($raw[0]), 0, 1) == 2) {\n$parts = explode(';', trim($raw[1]));\nand add the following conditional between then, so the result is this:\nif (is_array($raw) && count($raw) > 1 && substr(trim($raw[0]), 0, 1) == 2) {\n    if (substr($raw[1], 0, 4) == '250-') {\n        $raw[1] = substr($raw[1], 4);\n    }\n$parts = explode(';', trim($raw[1]));\n. No problem. I'm trying to use elFinder for FTP too, so I needed to fix this bug.\nI'm not too fond of using the raw output of a LIST command, though. If elFinder is going to depend on the RFC 3659 extensions anyway (it's already using the MLST command for individual files), it ought to use the MLSD command instead. When I get the time I might try replacing the ftp_rawlist commands with an MLSD command.\n. ",

My solution was to change the dialog opts to 'modal:true' and NOT send a 'notice' on the 'request'.  Making it modal prevents the keystrokes from being stolen and sending a 'notice' in the request (Doing something...) tends to crash the page so when the Info dialog is dismissed the page is static, no longer interactive (as if the modal dialog were still open).\n. FWIW, this is not a simple task...I've done it, but required adding/writing a new 'command' javascript file, then updating the elFinder.options.js file to include the new command, and also adding the command to the elFinder.class.php file, The bulk of the work/writing is in the command javascript.\n. FWIW, there are some other areas where the DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR constant is used which makes some things work on unix servers and some things work on windows servers, but not both...e.g., entering a full path as the tmbPath...work-around is to create the path as a variable using DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR as the separator.\n@@@ php\n    'tmbPath'         => BASE .

The entire folder 'images' is locked...is it possible you are locking it in the configuration setup for that driver? https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Simple-file-permissions-control \n. Whichever php file you use as the 'connector'.  The default one if in /php/connector.php (/php/connector.minimal.php does NOT have this example setting)\n. Sorry for the confusion.  Looking at your attached image, you'll notice the 'locked' icon superimposed on each of the files and folders.  This indicates the folders are locked/read-only...therefore elFinder will not allow you to upload a new file, nor change any of the existing files.\nThe settings which may control this are found in the bottom of the 'php/connector.php' file.  There is an array variable called '$opts' which contains many lines most of which are commented out in the original file.  Within the definition for that variable, there is an item named 'attributes' which itself is an array using a regex expression which then applies file attributes to included files (read, write, hidden, & locked).\n. In both 7.20 and 9.38 beta, there is a 'command' of 'l' to list an archive, but no switch '-l'.  So for lines line #3267 (above), the correct argc value should be\n```\n'a -tzip'\nand NOT\n```\n'a -tzip -l'\n. Pure guess here, but the folder is probably 'locked' (with a lock icon superimposed).  meaning write is false...this is normally set in the 'connecter' php file\n. (w/ v2.1) What OS is the server? (Windows/Linux)...to work on Windows, you'd need to have 7Zip installed and I believe there is a 'switch' issue where elFinder calls the 7za.exe with an invalid switch.\n. See ticket #957, remove the -l as it is not (no longer?) a valid 7za.exe switch.\n. I think this is something that has crept into the editor code (along with CKEditor).  According to the api, you only pass the url and the editor should be getting the dimensions itself.  To fix a similar situation with CKEditor's newer image2 plugin, I had to write additional code to directly place the image dimensions into it's insert graphic dialog.  I had not gotten around to coding a fix for TinyMCE though.\n. Note this issue is fixed in TinyMCE v4.1.9 (according to their changelog)\n. My guess is you MUST set tmbURL if URL is not set...https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#tmbURL\nCode logic in elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php ~line 76 bumps to use 'URL' if 'tmbURL' is not set.  Look like there might need to be additional logic for if both tmpURL AND URL are not set\n. Are you getting any error messages? Can you display the files, just not the thumbnails? Do you have the 'roots' array set up correctly with path, URL?  What type of OS were you running locally, Windows or Linux based (DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR)?  I had to debug several different scenarios with our implementation.\n. What is not working?  The url is not being returned?  Or is it the noted issue where the image dimensions are not filled out?  Using the TinyMCE 'file_browser_callback' is known to not change the dimensions.\nIf that's the case and you are following the wiki article 'Integration with TinyMCE 4.x' at https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Integration-with-TinyMCE-4.x you could add/change this code fragment within the FileBrowserDialogue.mySubmit() function\n``` javascript\n      // pass selected file path to TinyMCE\n      parent.tinymce.activeEditor.windowManager.getParams().setUrl(URL);\n      var t = parent.tinymce.activeEditor.windowManager.windows[0];\n      t.find('#src').fire('change');\n  // close popup window\n  parent.tinymce.activeEditor.windowManager.close();\n\n```\nI've updated the wiki article to include this...HOWEVER the BEST bet is to switch to using the TinyMCE 'file_browser_callback' function which I'll also attempt to 'add to' the wiki article.\n. Will probably work (I have a custom 'open' command to circumvent the issue), but the ticket was opened since out-of-the-box, it is a security issue which might sneak by the implementor.\n. Though it's working in the v2.1 demo, I get the error as Fatal error: Function name must be a string in elFinder\\php\\elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php on line 15\n. This appears to be a php v5.3 issue\n. FWIW, $_REQUEST is a mashup of both $_GET and $_POST in modern php versions\n. Maybe a partial implementation would be to:\n- Allow the cwd tree to be fully hidden (with an icon to expand/collapse?), currently has a minimum/maximum width, but is resizable (there is an option to put the 'up folder level' entry into the file pane I believe)\n- Allow the toolbar to be fully hidden (with an icon to expand/collapse)\n. FYI, A way to remove the 'Page/Document has Expired' message in the browser when trying to go 'back' from a page in the php code\nini_set('session.cache_limiter','public');\nsession_cache_limiter(false);\n. I found a workaround within the connector using octdec(DIR_DEFAULT_MODE_STR + 0)\n. Why allow someone to create a new directory and not be able to use it...defies the unix permissions logic...e.g., the permissions used to create the folder are inherited by the new folder and it's (future) contents???\n. This may not be the case, but if PHP has spit out any warnings/errors from like XDebug, it'll mess pu the JSON record and appear as bad JSON. In the Browser Developer, Network Tab you might try selecting 'XHR' instead of 'JS' filter, reloading elFinder and when you see the url being called via AJAX, you can click on it and be able to see the raw response, a preview, headers, etc...\n. or is the fix to turn OFF 'uploadOverwrite'?. I've had issues in the past with using different test (windows) and production (Linux) servers. You may need to change the '/' in all paths to DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR like this\nphp\n'tmbPath'         => BASE . 'tmp' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'elfinder',. Perhaps the fix given to me wasn't the real fix...here is the payload:\nlocalhost/connector.php?cmd=open&target=l1_asdl%20. This seems to only occur when 'debug' is turned ON (where the output is not escaped). With a test setup \n```\nhttp://localhost/elFinder/php/connector.php?cmd=open&target=l1_asdl%20. 1. extract elFinder into your web folder into folder named 'elFinder'\n2. rename php/connector.php.dist to connector.php\n3. browse to the above url in your browser\nThe issue will not appear with connector.minimal.php.dist since debug is not passed to elFinderConnector. It appears the issue is if you force json output as text/html.. Looks like my issue relates to the (poor) example using '.trash' for the folder name and the 'access' function locks read & write access to dot files?\nAlso, is there an easier way of determining the 'trashHash' option value? I had to load elFinder and then use the debug view and tracing javascript to determine the hash value of the trash volume. E.g., the send to trash worked, but needed the full trashHash root to get restore to work.\nI also noted the trash folder MUST already exist to mount the trash volume. Though subfolders are automatically created, the main folder must exist at startup.. option configuration is\n```\n    'roots'  => array(\n        array(\n            'id'              => 'exp2',\n            'driver'          => 'Exponent',  // custom volume driver\n            'path'            => BASE .

    "sbillard": "Just to note, the nigtly c60a0917daea2370b55158fb89304237418fe does not work with jQuery 1.8.3. Specifically the delete dialog box (and others) does not appear when pressing the delete button.\n. I am traveling currently. I will try this build as soon as I can.\n. I have now tested with the latest 2.x nightly build. No problem with jQuery 1.8.3.\n. Sorry to have left this open without a solution. Things are working now, but I don't remember what the correction was.\n. I have clicked on the image. But in my case clicking on it does not enable the \"select files\" button. So I guess the question is what allows that button to be enabled?\n. Sorry for not responding more quickly. I must have missed your comment originally. I have used IE as the browser so far.\nI looked at the elfineder.html with the nightly build. Maybe I misunderstood, is there somewhere that shows the adjustments you made? Also, what is the schedule for the 2-x code? I am not in a particular hurry, the release schedule I would like to meet for the Zenphoto code is June-July this year.\n. I have tried elfinder-2.x-24eee26 now, both with IE and with FireFox. No joy, the selector button does not get enabled.  Firefox does not show any Javascript errors. But maybe that is because elfinder is in the TinyMCE popup window. What version of jQuery are you using? I am using jquery 1.8.3 and jqueryui 1.9.1.\nI should point out that all the other functions seem to be working. The proper set of buttons are enabled when clicking on folders or images or non-image files. Just the selector button does not get enabled. It really makes me think that there is something wrong with my configuration for tinyMCE.\nhere is the code I have for the tinyMCE file_browser_callback:\nfunction elFinderBrowser (field_name, url, type, win) {\n  var elfinder_url = '<?php echo FULLWEBPATH.'/'.ZENFOLDER.'/'.PLUGIN_FOLDER; ?>/elfinder/elfinder.php?XSRFToken=<?php echo getXSRFToken('elFinder'); ?>';    // use an absolute path!\n  tinyMCE.activeEditor.windowManager.open({\n    file: elfinder_url,\n    title: 'elFinder 2.0',\n    width: 900,\n    height: 450,\n    resizable: 'yes',\n    inline: 'yes',    // This parameter only has an effect if you use the inlinepopups plugin!\n    popup_css: false, // Disable TinyMCE's default popup CSS\n    close_previous: 'no'\n  }, {\n    window: win,\n    input: field_name\n  });\n  return false;\n}\n. That has helped. I did find the callback was missing. Now I get the selector, but tinyMCE reports [object,Object] as the url. I seem to remember seeing something about this somewhere else.\nthe ready function is now:\n$().ready(function() {\n var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n  lang: '<?php echo $locale; ?>',   // language (OPTIONAL)\n  customData: {'XSRFToken':'<?php echo getXSRFToken('elFinder'); ?>'},\n  url : '<?php echo WEBPATH.'/'.ZENFOLDER.'/'.PLUGIN_FOLDER.'/elFinder/'; ?>php/connector_zp.php',              // connector URL (REQUIRED)\n  getFileCallback: function(url) { // editor callback\n   FileBrowserDialogue.mySubmit(url); // pass selected file path to TinyMCE\n  }\n }).elfinder('instance');\n});\n. That's done it! All is working now. Thank you very much for your patience. This will make a good addition to our Zenphoto gallery product.\n. This implementation is in the 1.4.5 brach, just so you know.\nThere is one strange thing, though. Not elFinder, but maybe you have seen it. The tinyMCE popup window does not correctly show the image. But if I simply add then remove a space from the front of the URL while in the popup window the image displays correctly. Of course, it is always correct once inserted into the document.\n. Sorry, no site available to show this. I think it is a TinyMCE issue anyway. Tried it in FireFox and nothing shows in the preview at all.\n. Thanks for the FIreFox suggestion. That did show that I missed a spot where the URL object was used. All is working now!\n. did not work for me. But maybe I do not understand exactly what this is. Is it the value set to the \"addributes\" option?\n. Got it. Works great now. Thanks much for your help.\n. ",

I didn't found this problem before. But for me it's really interesting, why it happen.. So, probaby bind is stopping (?).\n. IMHO there is an error with bind implementation, but I'm not 100% sure... Implemented bind is working after action, so file names should be always rename. Maybe it's not working if renamed new filename still exists (?). It's question for AUTHORS :)\n. So, best way is replacing this file (default?) in that case. Any idea how to do it?\n. @matoni555 I'm crying but it's not working for me (ver 2012-04). After file upload \"incorrect backend answer\" (in Polish). But, when I refresh a window - file seems to be uploaded. Filename isn't sanitized :( I will try leatest one elFinder version. I am in love with elfinder and I'm using it with CKE but f... sanitize isn't working :/\nupdate: I've just used nightly build (elfinder-2.x_n-38cf7c3.zip), and it's fine, but for polish characters your clear_spec_char function isn't working. So after change this function - everything seems working GREAT!\nThanks!\n. @matoni555 have done good work. His modify working great for me now. Only one problem is not highlighting files after upload (because orginal filename is not output filename). But I'm using it for 3 months and I like it :) \n. In case of file upload, you've got option: uploadOverwrite, but without popup, choice have to be declared permanent. It is simple for users. No confusing them ;)\n. Number are timestamp or random, it's a way to makes browser always \"refresh\". If you want to make img always refreshig, you can write img src=\"filename.ext?rand=rand\" or simple img src=\"filename.ext?rand\". \nThese numbers can be generated (I suppose) by Jquery load function, with setting ajax cache = false. I'm pretty sure...\nBut still I can't understand what was a question? Additional you shouldn't show us browser resoponse, true params you can see only in source php, not in compiled source.\n. Ok, I've found it. At the end of the function should be:\nreturn true;\nClosed.\n. Hm.. now I see, it's not necesery. Files can be deleted by anybody. It's ok for me. Invalid issue.. :)\n. I've checked twice both versions:\n- elfinder-2.x_n-d3db2b3\n- elfinder-2.x-6b6c74d\nbut there is no change in search function. So with one? \n. \nhm.... I've done it. In your's demo is no difference. \nI've wrote \"win\" in search field, nothing happens. Should be filter automatically to \"Winter.jpg\" without using Enter.\n. WinXP.\nChrome 24.0.1312.56 m (JS console is clear)\nFirefox 16.0.2, 18.0.1\nIE 8 (error line 3, character 56618)\nIm just writing text in Search input, nothing more (no enter after). Your's url: http://hypweb.net/elFinder-nightly/demo/2.x/elfinder.html\nDon't work.\n. Yes, my suggestion was \"don't use Enter anymore\". It's easier, exactly accordind to name of issue.\n. I agree. Should be any way to do bind before some actions.\n. Everything fine, but who need this feature? You have to now that simple file size (for sending) is declared by your's server. So chuncking can make only smaller files than your 1 file. If I know what you mean, but I not sure :)\nSo if you wan't to send 100MB file (for chuncking [?]) and create later 10 files with size 10 MB each, your's server  POST size limit, must be 100MB or more. \nFinally, file chunking [?]  is useless. Gives you nothing. If I know what you mean... \n. For uploading big files you should always use FTP, not web browser based applications... Maybe it's only my opinion, or maybe not. There was a lot of problems with big files and web browsers. For many reasons, you shoudn't use web browser apps for do it.\n. Great job!\n. Don't use IE anymore :+1: \n. I've found it ... #440 , wiki should be updated:\ngetFileCallback : function(file) {\n                window.opener.CKEDITOR.tools.callFunction(funcNum, file.url);\n                window.close();\n            },\n\"file\" => \"file.url\"\n. So you should only modify function function cs_utf2ascii($s) { .. } it's not perfect function. For me not working too. I'm using:\nfunction clear_spec_char($string){\n$string = iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT', $string);\n$string = strtolower($string);\n$string = strtr($string, array('&' => '-', '\"' => '-', '&'.'#039;' => '-', '<' => '-', '>' => '-', '\\'' => '-'));\n$string = preg_replace('/^[^a-z0-9]{0,}(.*?)[^a-z0-9]{0,}$/si', '\\1', $string);\n$string = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9.-]/', '-', $string);\n$string = preg_replace('/[-]{2,}/', '-', $string);\nreturn $string;\n}\nso.. try try try :) setlocale is only small part of problem. There is also client (browser) encoding and others.\n. answer: Issue #466 \n. This is not working for now. Find nigtly version and then, modify some files from MIDDLE of topic #466 @matoni555.

I'm using this file with success and no apache errors. </p>\n<p>```\n        <!-- elFinder JS (REQUIRED) -->\n        <script src=\"js/elfinder.min.js\">\n    <!-- elFinder translation (OPTIONAL) -->\n    <script src=\"js/i18n/elfinder.pl.js\"></script>\n\n```\nSo if you got any problem with including script files - it's not elfinder bug, but it's problem with your server configuration. Try also to use absolute path beginning from root slash (eg. /js/elfinder/js/i18n...).\n. What about duplicate? It's not working in that case. File name contains unwanted characters. I was trying to add \"duplicate.pre\" (?) - it wasn't working :)\n. Get nightly version. Nao-pon solution is working fine. \n. 1) try to update elfinder - nightly build\n2) show us print screen with context of this message, file / line numer with error (chrome console).\nIn case of your description - everything is possible...\n. Ok, now I'm sure. These files was made \"onclick\" big zip files. There was some errors with callback function, destroy wasn't executed.\n. 2.1 nightly, working code:\n'attributes' => array(\n        array(\n            'pattern' => '/^./',\n            'read'    => true,\n            'write'   => false,\n        'hidden'   => false,\n            'locked'  => false\n        )\n      )\n. Alert(file) should do that in backend function. \ngetFileCallback: function(file) {\n          window.open(file,'_blank');                \n          },\n. I have used 2.1 with ftp without any problems. Config example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17446086/elfinder-errunknowncmd-ftp-integration\n. It's alive! There is many nightly builds made by nao-pon. \"375 open tickets without any concerted effort\" - tickes != serious problems. Chromium project has 62967 opened issues, but more than 40 percent of people are using google chrome ;]\nnao-pan - thank you for your good job! Elfinder IMHO it the best web based file explorer.\n. Clear cookies before, because sort and view are saved in cookie IMHO.\n. Clear cookies before, because sort and view are saved in cookie IMHO.\n. Elfinder sorts by one column only. I think for 95% of people that's enough.\n. I have got the same problem on Debian (ext3 partition)...\n. On left click, by initialize elfinder with callback. Additional, path in connector should begin with http, or you can add http and host like string in JS (example: alert('http://host'+file)). \ngetFileCallback: function(file) {\n          alert(file);\n          },\n.

This method is working fine for me. Your folder is \"TEST\" (case sensitive on linux server). Try also /TEST$/, in my case:\n'attributes' => array(\n        array(\n            'pattern' => '/am$/', //You can also set permissions for file types by adding, for example, .jpg inside pattern.\n            'read'    => true,\n            'write'   => false,\n        'hidden'   => true,\n            'locked'  => true\n        )\n      )\n. In CKEditor you can call for file explorer only for SINGLE file (hyperlink, image). So I'm not sure but I think it's not possible to do. You should ask CKE developers for possibility...\n.

I doesn't help. It looks like it has been ignored. I can see that temp files are still created in \"/tmp\". I have tried also to do:\nini_set('upload_tmp_dir','/home/my_dir/');\nat first line of private function getTempDir($volumeTempPath = null)... Temp is still created in '/tmp'.\n. I'm using 2.1, now I tried also with nightly, without sucess... Still the same, elFinfer ignore my tmpPath ( of course 777 privilages).\n. So, @nao-pon what is a difference now between config \"tmpPath\" and \"uploadTempPath\" ?\nAnd new option also not working for me :( \n\n'driver'        => 'LocalFileSystem',   // driver for accessing file system (REQUIRED)\n'path'          => '/home/jordanftp',         // path to files (REQUIRED)    \n'utf8fix'    => true,\n'fileMode'     => 0666,         // new files mode\n 'dirMode'      => 0777,         // new folders mode\n 'tmbPathMode'      => 0777,\n 'uploadTempPath' => '/home/nnbt/_tmp',\n. ok, thanks. But, now I replaced it to main options:\n$opts = array(\n    // 'debug' => true,\n    'bind' => array(\n            'mkdir.pre mkfile.pre rename.pre' => array(\n                'Plugin.Sanitizer.cmdPreprocess'\n            ),\n            'upload.presave' => array(\n                'Plugin.Sanitizer.onUpLoadPreSave'\n            )\n        ),\n  'uploadTempPath' => '/home/nnbt/_tmp',\n  'roots' => array(\nand temp files are created still in /tmp :( Maybe it's not possible to change without global settings in php.ini ? ini_set('upload_tmp_dir','/home/my_dir/') is also ignored by my server. After that sys_get_temp_dir() still return \"/tmp\"...\n. How to debug errors in elFinder ?\n. Thank you. It was working fine \"uploadTempPath\" is working (but only for chunking). Firstly php send temp files to \"upload_tmp_dir\" in php.ini and then to \"uploadTempPath\". I have got also problem with files >2GB this is problem with 32bit OS probably. @nao-pon Thank you very much!\n. It works great! Thank you very much @nao-pon and Happy New Year :)\n. Thank you! \n. Is that possible to get any dialog (option) before overwite (without name change) ?\n. I've never seen this ask (form) before :) I didn't set uploadOverwite yet and I had always overwitten file without any ask :) thanks again.\n. @nao-pon - dialog window will be open correct with 'uploadOverwrite' => true without Sanitizer.\nIf I upload file \"test-1-a.txt\" twice - Elfinder is asking for overwite. \nBut when I was trying to upload file \"test 1 a.txt\" twice - using Sanitizer - ask window (dialog) will not shown (file was overwitten without any question) because file after upload was \"test-1-a.txt\" and second one is \"test 1 a.txt\". It should be comparision between existing file vs. uploaded after Sanitizer.\nI would like to get info about overwite working on send sanitized file name = existing files.\nIs that possible? \n. Great! It's working fine! :) Thank you!\n. It seems to be working on reversed order now because first occurance for path is only used if I have right (elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:3595) ?  ...\nphp\n'attributes' => array(\n            array(\n            'pattern' => '/marketing/', \n            'read'    => true,\n            'write'   => true,\n            'locked'  => false,\n            'hidden'  => false\n            ),\n        array(\n                'pattern' => '/^./', //You can also set permissions for file types by adding, for example, .jpg inside pattern.\n                'read'    => true,\n                'write'   => false,\n                        'hidden'   => false,\n                'locked'  => true\n                  )\n      ).

Prevents directory traveral.\nif($path !== $this->root && strpos(realpath($path), realpath($this->root).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR) !== 0){\n    return $stat;\n}\nThis prevents files resolving outside the root being detected.\nI'll submit a pull request for it.\n. @ChuckNorrison I don't think this is safe.\nThis restricts it by IP. If the user's computer is compromised it breaks. If the same IP is used by many computers (think corporate proxies with 1000's of users on 1 IP) every other computer with that IP can come in. If the script somehow crashes and the file is not deleted the .htaccess may stay there for some time. If more than one admin user accesses the script at the same time the one that visits last locks the other out.\nBesides, you can still use your script in combination with my pull-request.\n. @ChuckNorrison Well for our solution it's part of a CMS and only intended for the admin panel. So we also needed an additional piece of code in connect.php to validate the user is logged in to our CMS with admin permissions. But there's no harm in the additional security implemented in elFinder. Like when the user's computer is compromised or a sessions is hijacked or the account is compromised by phishing. Still, for your case the most dangerous part is re-using the same IP. School and business networks as well as open hotspots would break an IP filter aproach. Best have another look to see if it is suitable for your setup :]\ntl;dr\nThis pull-request will make elFinder more secure. But you'll still need to take extra precautions based on your setup. Generally IP filters are not strong enough for security.\n. dropbox-php is not maintained since 2012. It mayb be worthwhile to find a modern libarary.

Get info returns the image dimensions without loading the entire image on the client side. \nThanks for considering this.. One idea would be to create a 400px wide preview image temporarily and serving it to the client as needed. It doesn't have to be stored on the server.. Our clients are usually in developing countries with networks speeds that vary from 2mb/s and up. Images range from 3-5 mb. At that speed, a 4mb jpg could take up to 15 seconds to load on the client side.\nCompare that with creating a 10kb preview jpg temporarily server side, sending it to the client side. Total time would be a lot less. \nOur organization helps minority people groups in remote parts of the world create and maintain websites for the promotion of literacy, language and culture. \nThanks for considering this..

    "andrew2221": "Hi. The OP's question I think is relevant to all of us, who does need to use the created thumbnails. After some digging, based on ChuckNorrison's suggestion, I found a relatively easy \"patch\".  So on behalf of everyone who needs this: \n1. search for the function tmbname($stat) in the class elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php\n2. replace the return value with this: current(explode('.', $stat['name'])).'.png';\nThis way the created thumbnails will have the same name as the original image (of course with .png extension).\nIf that will arise security questions/problems, I don't know. Hope it does help.\n. I'm glad it actually helped someone.. :)\n. Hi,\nCan you be a bit more specific, where do you expect the thumbnails to show up? If inside elFinder itself, then it could be a folder permission problem, or php server settings (e.g. suhosin). Also, I don't know if it's a typo or not, but the function name I mentioned was \"tmbname\", while you wrote \"rmbname\". Double-check it to be sure.\n. Great. :) Keep it up.\n. ",

    "donShakespeare": "\nHi. The OP's question I think is relevant to all of us, who does need to use the created thumbnails. After some digging,  ... So on behalf of everyone who needs this:\n\nGreat solution. @andrew2221 \nMaybe the thinking behind the unreadable hash was/is that the thumbnails are for caching purposes strictly for use of elFinder.\nIf that is the case, is there a plugin to create thumbnails alongside these elFinder-own thumbnails?\nBut seeing that tmb has several settings crop, size, etc etc, it seems highly unlikely that elFinder auto-generated thumbnails was not intended to be used by users.\nSo, question: can @andrew2221 solution be implemented without hacking the core, since, in my setup I don't have access to the core and can't direct end-users to do the alteration?\nCan this function be extended at runtime @troex ?\nprotected function tmbname($stat) {\n  //return $stat['hash'].$stat['ts'].'.png';\n  return current(explode('.', $stat['name'])).'.png';\n}\nI'll go try to write a plugin for this.\nThanks all.. Ah, I found it. For anyone still interested. Toss this in your connector.\nBe aware, that according to your setup, if roots or folders are sharing the same tmb folder, you will have thumbnail issues. \nThat is, if Folder A and Folder B have images with the same name mango.gif,\nand if both sharing the same tmb folder, you will see mango.png in both folders.\nOf course you can add some hash to distinguish files. To solve the root issue (not the different folders in same root), try :\nreturn current(explode('.', $stat['name'])) . \"_\" . explode('_', $stat['hash'])[0].'.png';\nToss this in your connector\nclass elFinderVolumeAwesomeFileSystem extends elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem\n{\n    protected function tmbname($stat) {\n      //return $stat['hash'].$stat['ts'].'.png'; //original\n      return current(explode('.', $stat['name'])).'.png'; //according to this thread\n      //return current(explode('.', $stat['name'])) . \"_\" . explode('_', $stat['hash'])[0].'.png'; //append root id\n    }\n}\nAnd then change\n'driver'        => 'AwesomeFileSystem',\n'path'          => '/etc/example/',\n'tmbPath'    => 'whatever'\nSee https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1962\nand\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1795#issuecomment-265627105\n. Are you integrating with a CMS or what? How are your users managed?\n. Good feature. Would there be one Recycle bin for each volume?. If you set read to false (in either accesControl or attributes, the file will not be shown. That is how precisely the .tmb folders are hidden from view.\n. eFinder 2.21. Is it official startPath is dead and deprecated, and replaced by startPathHash?. Still having trouble with startPath which worked perfectly all this while.\nI resorted to startPathHash but now it won't open the tree nav to correct folder.\nThat is, if the path is two or more levels deep, the tree nav will not open.\nAny ideas?\n@mcarpenterjr did you ever get startPath to work again?. This also affects the nightly build\nVersion: 2.1.21 (2.1-src Nightly: 443b156), protocol version: 2.1\njQuery/jQuery UI: 3.1.1/1.12.1. @nao-pon  Thanks for checking, sir. I will return to do some more homework.\nGreat salutations for all your work here.. Depending on your environment, the task could be much easier. Try passing a value via URL parameter to the connector, then do some logic there to show what roots depending on what value of\n elfinder.html?roots=a\nelfinder.html?roots=b. Perfect! Case 1 solved all my issues. All the themes are working.\nI did not know about case 1 but I have fought with case 2 and some CSS is applied wrongly.\nThanks for the excellent help.. Excellent! Thank you. Makes a world of difference now.\n\n\nWill this remain as acceptedDirname or acceptedDirName\n\n\nWill there be corresponding changes in the JS ui to return Invalid folder name instead of Invalid file name?\n\n\nWill the wonderful Sanitizer Plugin also have this feature?\nprivate function sanitizeFolderName($filename, $opts, $allows = array()) {\n  $targets = $allows? array_diff($opts['targets'], $allows) : $opts['targets'];\n  return str_replace($targets, $opts['replace'], $filename);\n}\nor at atleast\nprivate function sanitizeFileName($filename, $origin, $opts, $allows = array()) {\n  if($origin != \"folder\"){\n    $targets = $allows? array_diff($opts['targets'], $allows) : $opts['targets'];\n    return str_replace($targets, $opts['replace'], $filename);\n  }\n}. Works beautifully!\n\n\nI noticed this code errInvDirame not translating; is that something that will be fixed when the release is made? (Invalid folder name)\n```\nUnable to rename \"myFolder\".\nerrInvDirame. Thanks.\nI tried that. The mother CMS/htaccess still redirects it.\nI reckon that the best solution would be to able to alter the parameter name before it is sent to backend.. \nMy connector file is not an actual physical file, but rendered by MODX CMS.\nEverything works superbly with requestType: post\nXHR finished loading: POST \"http://localhost:81/DEV/elfinder.html\nExcept when there is a q sent by post or get.\nelfinder.html    ....  POST    ....    404    .... xhr    .... Other    ....   34.3\u2009KB\nIf I go into my CMS and modify the request param to q_private\nAnd change its htaccess rule to ...\n```\nThe Friendly URLs part\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule ^(.)$ index.php?q_private=$1 [L,QSA]\n``\n... then elFinder extended search works perfectly when enter is pressed.. This approach works flawlessly withrequestType: get**Edit: withget` the same issues.*\nBut returns a consistent error with requestType:post (with or without the CMS htaccess rewrite)\nToo bad, because post is great for basic hiding of url parameters. \nInvalid parameters for command \"search\"\n\n. That is exactly it! @nao-pon . The missing piece!\nExcellent victory!\nMany thanks to you, this conflict is now simply non-existent.\nFINAL CODE\nIn your Client config (JS)\njs\nrequestType: 'post', // post or get (optional)\n//...\n// Start elFinder (REQUIRED)\nstart = function(elFinder) {\n    //...\n    // load jQueryUI CSS\n    $(function() {\n        //...\n        // Make elFinder (REQUIRED)\n        var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\n        var elf_request = elf.request;\n        elf.request = function(opts) {\n            if (opts.data && opts.data.cmd && opts.data.cmd === 'search') { //fire only when search request is made\n                opts.data.q_my_own_parameter = opts.data.q; //swap in your own parameter\n                delete opts.data.q; //remove the conflict to survive htaccess redirect\n            }\n            return elf_request.call(elf, opts); //continue business as usual - send the info to backend\n        };\n    });\n},\nIn your Connector (PHP)\n```php\n//since elFinder needs back the &q parameter, \n//you can safely reassign it here because the htaccess is done with redirecting\n//Conflict resolved!!!!!!\nif (isset($_POST['q_my_own_parameter'])) { //if client JS requestType is 'post'\n    $_POST['q'] = $_POST['q_my_own_parameter'];\n}\nif (isset($_GET['q_my_own_parameter'])) {  //if client JS requestType is 'get'\n    $_GET['q'] = $_GET['q_my_own_parameter'];\n}\n//...\n$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));\n$connector->run();\n. @SquawkWoof have you tested this with multiple roots?.  header component?  please explain.. I am sure there is a simpler way to do things on elfinder load, but this is my working solution thus farjavascript\nvar myElfinderTweaks = function(){\n    $(\".elfinder-path\").before($('.elfinder-button-search'));\n    //place the path DIV wherever you want\n    //and style to your taste\n    //at this point you can move anything you want like search box etc etc\n};\nvar is_volumeReady = function(){\n    var taskCounter = 0;\n    var taskTries = 0;\n    var volChecker = setInterval(function(){\n        var loadedVolumeEmpty = $(\".elfinder-cwd-wrapper-empty:visible\").length;\n        var loadedVolumeFull = $(\".elfinder-cwd-file:visible\").length;\n        taskTries++;\n        if(loadedVolumeEmpty || loadedVolumeFull){\n            taskCounter++;\n            myElfinderTweaks();\n        }\n        if(taskCounter == 1 || taskTries > 50){clearInterval(volChecker);}\n    },2000);\n};\nvar elf = $('#elfinder').hide().elfinder(opts).delay(500).fadeIn(\"fast\",is_volumeReady).elfinder('instance');\n```. The problem with this is that if you navigate to a volume that requires special ui, e.g Flysystem SFTP, elFinder will refresh/rebuild your toolbar, and all changes would be lost.\nIf there is a callback in elFinder for when you switch Volumes, then you could re-attach your tweaks at that time.. Here is the official way of moving things around, faster and smoother https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1978#issuecomment-296189660\n\nUse bind . e,g\njavascript\n                var elf = $('#elfinder').elfinder(opts).elfinder('instance');\n                elf.bind('toolbarload', function() {\n                    myCustomTweaks();\n                    elf.trigger('uiresize');\n                    // alert(\"toolbar_refreshed\"); //debug\n                });. Right now, I succeeded in doing this. Maybe this is the correct way, and this is not a feature or issue at all.\nphp\nclass elFinderVolumeFlysystem extends \\Barryvdh\\elFinderFlysystemDriver\\Driver {\n    protected $driverId = 'l';\n}\nIn case anyone is wondering, this is the use scenario:\nstartPathHash: 'l' + myVol + '_' + btoa(myFolder).replace(/\\+/g, '-').replace(/\\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '.').replace(/\\.+$/, '')) : '',. Works perfectly! Thanks.. Perfect. This official way is best. Now I am going to learn all the other events\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1972#issue-222624708. Oops, @nao-pon this fails for the Recycle Group.\nFor some reason I lose my toolbar because the toolbarload means nothing to the Recycle section\nI have to put that logic in load and some how find a way to prevent the script from firing every time a load is made.. I think you might be in luck ...\n[{\"pattern\":\"/\\.(?:gitignore|zip)$/\",\"hidden\":true}]\nelFinder Attributes\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#attributes. @dleffler don't forget to add restore to your command list in the main JS file. >Also, is there an easier way of determining the 'trashHash' option value? I had to load elFinder and then use the debug view and tracing javascript to determine the hash value of the trash volume. E.g., the send to trash worked, but needed the full trashHash root to get restore to work.\nTemporarily turn on useBrowserHistory in your elFinder opts main.js\n\n. Please share your setup. My restore does not work one bit. Thanks. I missed a T in 'trashHash'       => 'tt1_XA',. We also got to watch out:\nIf say, Volume1 has filename rules acceptedName / acceptedDirname, e,g all files must have extension ...\nand you delete LICENSE text file that has extension ...\nWhen you restore that file, it will fail, because when the file is restored, all rules including acceptedName will be checked. The restored file is basically being treated as an copied/pasted/uploaded file.

The restored file is basically being treated as an copied/pasted/uploaded file. An easy way would be to use a modal which loads elFinder in iframe.\nYou can then use parent.myFunction() to close(destroy/hide) the iframe modal and return the selected image url to parent page.\nIn fact this is similar to how TinyMCE handles it.\nTo prevent elFinder from reloading from scratch each time you hit the button, it will be good to use some logic to check if the iframe already exists, if it does, .show() it, if it does not, create it\n```javascript\n//elFinder main.js file (in the modal iframe)\ngetFileCallback: function(file) {\n    var returnUrl = file.url;\n    parent.getElfinderUrl(returnUrl);\n}\n//parent page\nfunction getElfinderUrl(url){\n    $(\"input.elfinder\").val(url);\n    $(\"iframe.elfinder\").hide(); // or .remove()\n}\n//parent page\n$(\"button.elfinder\").on(\"click\", function(){\n    if($(\"iframe.elfinder\").length){\n        if(!$(\"iframe.elfinder\").is(\":visible\")){\n          $(\"iframe.elfinder\").show();\n        }\n    }\n    else{\n        $(\"\").appendTo(\"body\"); // use CSS to make look like a proper modal\n    }\n});\n//add a modal close button somewhere with the same idea\n. You are right, just use\n`'driver' => 'MyLocalFileSystem'`. Okay, after a while I made this optional by\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/26374134javascript\nload = function() {\n    if(typeof jQuery != \"undefined\"){\n        define('jquery', function() { return jQuery; }); //tell requireJS to not load jQuery\n    }\n    if(jQuery && typeof jQuery.ui != \"undefined\"){\n        define('jquery-ui', function() { return jQuery.ui; }); //tell requireJS to not load jQueryUI\n    }\n    require(\n       //...\n    );\n},\n// config of RequireJS (REQUIRED)\nrequire.config({\n    //...\n    paths: {\n        'jquery': '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min', //leave this alone\n        'jquery-ui': '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min', //leave this alone\n        //...\n    }\n});\n// load JavaScripts (REQUIRED)\nload();\n```.

    "plashenkov": "Is quote a unicode char?\nEscaped are double quotes, single quotes and slashes. They are all non-unicode chars.\nIn 2.0rc which is available for download from official page, there was no such issue.\n. Yes, there are errors with unicode filenames on Windows, etc, but this problem is not connected with Unicode (if I understand right). Simply \" becomes \\\", ' becomes \\', \\ becomes \\, and then \\\\, and then \\\\\\\\, etc.\n. I found the cause of this error: my local web server was configured with magic_quotes_gpc=on by default, and this is why all quotes and slashes are escaped in the POST requests to elFinder connector.\nWell, as far as it is very important to save file contents without corruption or modifications, what do you think, does it make sense to include this solution into elFinder's connector code?\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3006407/slash-before-every-quote-problem\n. Well, maybe. :smile: Thank you!\n. I found that fm.parents() function returns array of file parents as well as the file itself. We need only the file parents, without the file itself. fparents.pop(); does the trick, and after that duplicating via copy-paste will successfully work.\n``` javascript\nfparents = fm.parents(file.hash);\nfparents.pop();\nif ($.inArray(dst.hash, fparents) !== -1) {\nif ($.map(fparents, function(h) { var d = fm.file(h); return d.phash == dst.hash && d.name == file.name ? d : null }).length) {\n    return !dfrd.reject(['errReplByChild', file.name]);\n}\n\n}\n```\n. When you copy and paste the files, this is the strange explanation: \"The folder \u201c$1\u201d can\u2019t be replaced by an item it contains.\" It is irrelevant.\nAnd just one line fixes duplicate via copy and paste. This means that developers planned that duplication will be used in such way. And this is very intuitive way. I am sure this was just a little oversight -- they forgot to remove the item itself from the parents array.\n. You did not try yet? Just one little line: fparents.pop();\n. It is obvious that $1 will be the file/folder name. But you copy and paste a file in the same folder, and message speaks about replacing folder by an item from inside it. You really do not see the absurdity?\n. No problem, thank you very much.\n. I have also another fixes and improvements. I will post them too if you want.\n. ",

    "megadr01d": "@nao-pon Thanks for implementing the Save and Save & Close buttons in the nightly 2.1.\n. @ERROPiX Sorry to bother, is that CodeMirror integration?\n. I actually prefer Ace, it's what Codiad uses. Is it easy to integrate? If it's simple and you find the time to share the relevant config, drop me a line on megadroid [at] microvoid [dot] in. Otherwise, thanks anyway for the info.\n. > maybe add it wiki later if @nao-pon accept!\nThat would be a valuable contribution to the HOWTOs.\nThanks a lot, man. I'm gonna try it out and let you know the results.\n. @ERROPiX In v2.1 nightly, I got it working with a few modifications. I had to remove console.debug(fm); and change the editor var to something like this.AceEditor (so the save buttons would work). I always get some kind of error in the console with switch( file.mime ) so I couldn't get the mode to change dynamically according to the MIME type. Everything else worked OK.\nAnyway, I found CodeMirror is easier to integrate and I'm happy with it. Thanks again for the useful pointers to integrate both editors.\n. @ERROPiX Check this tip if you want an easier way to integrate mode auto-detection. Tested with elFinder 2.1 and latest Ace.\n. I'm not getting any error in OS X 10.9, Safari 7.1.6 but I found that if I select a file and drag it just a bit (like dragging to the same folder the file is in), the selection gets stuck. So, If I select a second file, I get 2 blue selections. I have to click again on the first file to release the sticky selection.\n. @nao-pon Thanks, just to report that I'm not getting any console warnings in Safari 7.1.6 so it seems fixed on my end.\n. > Can you add display of linux permissions (drwxr-xr-x or -rwxr-xr-x ...)?\nI would add the octal representation, eg. drwxr-xr-x (755) but although I would like this, it would have to accommodate windows and unix type permissions. ~~and without a way to actually change permissions, it would not be of much use~~ Permissions can always be changed in local FTP client, SSH session or online terminal emulator.\n\nFTP driver is supported owner. But LocalFileSystem driver didn't have\n\nWhat about the group? It's common for FTP listings to show user/group, eg. admin/nobody.\n. OK, I just saw this PR.\n. @nao-pon Thank you sir! This is highly appreciated. Since I don't use elFinder internal permissions (everything is read and write because I'm the only one accessing it), UNIX permissions are most useful.\nJust found a small bug. After applying new permissions I have to to reload elFinder (toolbar button) for the permissions column to refresh, but then the contextual menu stops working on files (the cwd contextual menu works). Only after reloading elFinder a second time I can access the contextual menu again.\n[EDIT] Is there a setting to choose between permission representations, like 0755, 755, rwxr-xr-x or both rwxr-xr-x (755)?\n. @nao-pon Thanks a lot my friend. It now refreshes the new permissions automatically. Is it too much to ask for a third option to be fileModeStyle: 'both' or fileModeStyle: ['string', 'octal'], eg. rwxr-xr-x (755)?\n\nI have to to reload elFinder (toolbar button) for the permissions column to refresh, but then the contextual menu stops working on files (the cwd contextual menu works). Only after reloading elFinder a second time I can access the contextual menu again.\n\nAlso, I created a new issue concerning the contextual menu bug. I think the problem may be in the Reload function.\n. @nao-pon  +:100:!\nAmazing. You even added values for different columns. Working great. =)\nThank you for your dedication and amazing developing skills.\n. v2.1 allows that. the upload dialog allows dragging and drop or pasting links.\n. Notifying @nao-pon. I think this is a great addition to the code and prevents some users posting that elFinder can't find the backend.\n. In the connector configuration, check the attributes option and set read to false on your upload folder.\nOr use .htpasswd.\n. I'd say @nao-pon 2.1 nightly is pretty stable.\n. @nao-pon :+1: About time! Great news.\n. Try to use a relative path from your path setting, eg.\nphp\n'path'    => '/home/webspace/public_html',\n'tmpPath' => '../../../tmp' // OR\n'tmpPath' => '../../../home/mytmpdir' // OR\n'tmpPath' => '../../mytmpdir'\n. If you're using v2.0, try v2.1 nightly. tmpPath is actually only included in 2.1's Wiki so maybe it was fixed.\n. There was an issue with symlinks that was fixed in May, for the 2.1 nightly build.\nI don't know what version are you on, but I can confirm symlinks show up correctly in the latest 2.1.\n\n. @nao-pon Super-fast!\n. https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Client-configuration-options#allowShortcuts\n.

Surely that should get the focus. \nAlso I tried setting\nenableAlways : true \nwith no luck.\nI would love to get this working, so any insight would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n. Works for me on the demo, so something in my use-case must be stealing the focus.  I am wrapping the component in Vaadin...\n. execShortcut is not getting called until after I manually execute a command.  Must be a jquery issue, as execShortcut is definitely getting registered.\nAlso, opening the context menu is enough to get the callback working.\nNo keyboard events are sent from jquery until after I run a command by clicking a command button.\n. jquery.dispatch is not getting called with the keydown event, so something is disabling, or re-enabling the on('keydown').  The click event works fine. \n. Hi Nao-Pon,\nI spend a few hours on this today.  \nFirst i thought it was because I had 2 jquery libraries, but dealing with that did not solve the problem.  Then I thought it might be related to jquery v2.2.  Next, I thought my issue was that there was another library calling $(document).keyup instead of $(document).on('keyup').  That did not solve the issue.\nThe other library's keyup handler was is getting called, while the elFinder handler was not.\nOnce I executed any elFinder command, the situation was reversed and elFinder received the event instead.\nSo this breaks it\n$(document).on('keyup', function (e) {\n     console.info('key up called on external handler');\n});`\nand this fixes it.\n$(document).on('keydown', function (e) {\n     console.info('key down called on external handler');\n});`\nBottom Line:  Registering a keyup listener causes the issue.  Perhaps that needs to be handled when initially setting up handlers in elFinder?\nThank you so much for your attention on this.  Please let me know if you can repeat this.\n. Actually, that did not fix the problem.  Still can't figure this one out. :(\nI am running it inside an iframe.  Maybe that's the issue...\n. OK.  Got it.\nThe issue happens when running in elFinder inside an iframe.\nPutting this in index.html, it does not get called until a command is executed.  Then it works from that point on.\n$(document).on('keydown', function (e) {\n   console.info(e);\n});\nThis works.\n$(top.document).on('keydown', function (e) {\n                console.info(e);\n });\nThis was my quick hack.\n// attach events to document\n    $(top.document)\n        // disable elfinder on click outside elfinder\n        .on('click.'+namespace, function(e) { enabled && !$(e.target).closest(node).length && self.disable(); })\n        // exec shortcuts\n        .on(keydown+' '+keypress, execShortcut);\nSo the not-breaking solution may be to add  topDocument to the options, with a default value of document.  And then bind events to that.\n. Yes, when my iframe closes, the keyboard input on spaces and return is completely broken.  Thats why I called it a 'hack'.  I think It may also break the preview window nav controls.\n. +1  Nice Work Naoki!\n. I would like to specify, as a config option, that the finder must always be in full screen mode, with no user-controlled option to restore it.\n. I only want all the icon, keyboard shortcuts, and help references gone, and open full screen by default on launch.\n. Basically I want 'the works' less the expand icon. I thought there was also a keyboard shortcut but I can't seem to find it now.\nAlthough I can just comment the expand icon out of the source, I thought it would be nice for a user to just do declare\nfullScreen:[always | start | default]\nand not have to worry about anything else.\n. Here's a screen shot.  I want all these actions gone.  I already have it starting in 'full screen' mode.  My issue is more about removing access any 'reinstate; items, while setting fullscreen on startup, using a single option.\nIn this example, full screen is not 'full user window'.  Its 100% of it's parent.  I don't want the user to be able to restore it.\n\n. Maybe I should not be saying 'Full Screen'...\n. The $(window).resize(...) along with adding allowFullScreen to the iframe<iframe ... allowFullScreen='true' /> fixed all my issues.  Now the full screen function works, and that is an added bonus, because before these changes, pressing full screen would restore my 100% sized elFinder to a less-than-full-sized div.\nThank you Naoki.\n. This is what shows up for me (mac - chrome - Version 54.0.2840.87 (64-bit).  If I don't move the preview window from the center, you don't even see the confirm dialog.\n\n.

    "lokothodida": "I would consider taking this a step further and modifying the elFinder source JS files to be modules as well: the main elFinder entry point (elFinder.js) would be written as a UMD module, but the other source files can be AMD/CommonJS/ES6 etc. The major benefit is that regardless of which module system is chosen, Browserify can be used to compile those modules, making the build stage simpler than it currently is. It  would also help to make the dependencies in a given module very explicit, and hopefully allow for current monolithic source files to be broken into smaller, more manageable modules.\n. You can do it from the client-side with the onlyMimes property:\njavascript\n$('.elfinder').elfinder({\n  // ...\n  onlyMimes: ['image'], // restricts to images\n  // ...\n});\n. Here is a cleaned up version of the elfinder.src.html file that you or others might find useful.\n. What is the reason for preventing confirmation dialogs from appearing? It seems a bit dangerous from a UI perspective to prevent the user from stopping accidental actions.\n. Ok. How have you added the external actions?\n. So I haven't tried this yet, but you might want to give it a shot.\nThe js/commands/rm.js file defines the delete command for the front-end. It has some code in it that triggers the dialog.\nSo if you're willing to modify the core just for your own project, you can remove/comment out the fm.confirm(/* */) stuff and replace it with what is defined on the accept callback. This would remove the confirmation dialog any time a file is deleted.\nI can think of a way that this could be added to the core with a configuration parameter on elFinder, but I'm not too sure if its a feature that the developers would want.\n. Or (and this too is untested), so you don't change the functionality of the normal rm action, you can copy the rm.js file (removing the confirm dialog section) and give the command a unique name:\njavascript\n// rmcustom.js\nelFinder.prototype.commands.rmcustom = function() {\n  // ...\n};\nLoad that script after the elFinder core has loaded:\nhtml\n<!-- elfinder core, then: -->\n<script src=\"js/commands/rmcustom.js\"></script>\nAdd that command to the elfinder configuration\njavascript\n  commands: [ /* your basic commands, then: */ 'rmcustom' ]\nThen use the elfinder instance to execute your new command\n``` javascript\nvar instance = $('.elfinder').elfinder('instance');\n// ...\nvar myCustomCallback = function() {\n  var hashes = / get the hashes for the files that need to be deleted /;\n  instance.exec('rmcustom', hashes);\n};\n```\nRunning myCustomCallback when you need to (I'm guessing it's on a click event?).\nI'm not sure of the best way to get the hashes, though. In terms of the client event callbacks, the select callback has an array of the currently selected files on the event parameter (event.data.selected), so you may need to use that callback to set the data somewhere, then get that data in your custom callback.\n. I know what you mean.\nTry out the above hacks to see that they actually work. Perhaps ask @nao-pon if he thinks it would be reasonable functionality to add to the core. If he does, I could probably implement it without too much hassle. Something like:\njavascript\ncommandsOptions: {\n  // 'delete' action\n  rm: {\n    // disable the confirmation dialog\n    dialog: false\n  }\n}\n. I've created a branch to try and add this functionality.\n- Changes to js/elFinder.options.js\n- Changes to js/commands/rm.js\nAgain, not tested them yet. Do you want to try it out?\n. The Adding file description to Properties dialog wiki page describes what you are trying to do. It's not an elegant solution however, as it involves editing the elFinder Javascript source code.\n. There is now a 2.1 draft of this functionality which lets you achieve this in the recent update of elFinder 2.1 without editing the Javascript source code (the PHP is identical to before).\n. I've added your changes as a pull request.\nAs for advice for simple edits to any Github project: if you are certain that you are making changes that will not break the project (i.e. the changes require little to no testing), you can edit files directly off of Github (without needing to install anything on your local machine). By clicking on a file and then clicking the pencil icon in the top right corner of it you can edit the file:\n\nor by clicking on the + near the top of the current directory's breadcrumb trail, you can create a new file in that directory:\n\nThis will automatically create a new fork of the project in a repository under your own account, and you can make all of the changes that you want there:\n\nThen once you are finished, you create a pull request.\n. :+1: Changed to getClass.\n. :+1: Makes sense (especially since startDir/startPath are likely to make users pass the raw path rather than the hash). As long as it doesn't confuse those looking at the connector API, I'm happy.\n. :+1: Done\n. Just putting out a sketch of how it could be implemented in a future release (without having looked too hard at the PHP connector), since there hasn't been much of a discussion on how to do this with 2.x+'s multi-root volumes:\n- Have a local temp/trash directory that holds information about deleted files\n  - For local file systems its easiest to just have the the folders/files themselves, but for other volumes it is probably best to store pseudo-information about the file/directory\n- Have a volume \"Recycle Bin\" that points to said temp/trash directory\n- Have the immediate sub-volumes/directories of the \"Recycle Bin\" volume correspond to the main volumes, e.g.\n- Volume 1\n- Volume 2\n- Volume 3\n- Recycle Bin\n  - Volume 1\n  - Volume 2\n  - Volume 3\n- Implement the connectors for each of the main volumes such that they have a \"Recycle\" action, which sends the appropriate amount of information to corresponding sub-volume in the temp/trash directory\n- Also implement a \"Restore From\" action for each connector, which takes information about a deleted file/directory and restores it in that volume\n- Then implement the \"Recycle Bin\" connector so that it has a \"restore\" action, which takes information about a given file and its volume and executes the \"Restore From\" action on that volume\n.

    "Offerel": "Ahhh. I see. Thx for the hint. It works now as expected.\n. That was my first thought also, but this wasn't the case. All permissions are correct. I use the same path with SabreDAV and this was no Problem. I have restarted my server instances today and the Problem doesn't occur again, i haven't changed anything in the config or elfinder files. The only thing i could think about, is some caching problem, since i use caching really heavily on my Raspberry Pi to gain a little bit more speed.\nSince the Problem seems to be gone now, i close this request. If it occurs again, i reopen it with more infos.. i try my luck in the evening and report if it works. main reason is, that i have a relative strict CSP Header definition on my own nginx server and me and my family are the only person's who use this server currently.\nBTW: i would like you to know, that i have made a experimental plugin for Roundcube Webmailer, which includes elFinder directly in to Roundcube. It was in first place only for my personal needs, but i think it's ok to share it with the community. You can find it at https://github.com/Offerel/roundcube_storage . The plugin works here as a kind of replacement for Dropbox or Google Drive, but in this context it works on the own server, with WebDAV access.. Great, i change this in a next release. Currently I'm in the hospital, my gallbladder must be removed urgently. I had the additional idea, that i could use elfinder also for adding and saving attachments from and within the webmail GUI. I will try to implement this. However the current implementation was a first start. With this and my calendar plugin, Roundcube works really fast and better as a Nextcloud instance on the same hardware.. Just let you know I'm back. There are now 2 new versions of the plugin. The version of just now adds the function to select attachments directly from elFinder and attach them to the mail.\nA kind of notebook function is now planned. You should be able to create and change notes in HTML format with tinyMCE and elFinder. If I have the time for Android, there will be a companion app for Android. I've just never been into Android development before.. One question to this topic. I have checked out now elFinder-2.1.31 and want to try a local ckeditor. But now, when i rightclick on a html file, there is no edit-submenu. Is this a bug?. ahh this works better. Sorry for this late reply but my good old Rasperry Pi died at the weekend and i could by today a new one. I try now to config my local CKEditor . I don't know, what do you mean with \"content of the server error\". I see only this error message in the access.log and not in error.log of nginx. However all other http 500 errors i have seen on my server, i have seen in the error.log. This is the first one, i see exclusively in access.log.\nI cant find anything about the problem in other logfiles like PHP.log or on the website itself or in the Web developer console of Firefox. I get only this message regarding the http 500... if you have any idea, where i can look to identify the problem, your hints are really welcome.. It seems, i have found the problem. Since this was part of a plugin development for roundcube, it seems that a function, a variable or some other thing collides with a name defined in elfinder. I have now renamed my roundcube plugin and rewritten the auth mechanism. This solves the problem. You can find the Roundcube elFinder Plugin at https://github.com/Offerel/roundcube_elfinder . Many thx. But where should i add this snippet? I assume in elfinder.html, somwhere under commandsOptions?. I have now the nightly-build and the above code in elfinder.html. But when i open the Editor, it does not open maximized, instead it opens as before in normal window mode.\nAdditionally there seems to be php error, when i open a subfolder called \"Notes\". In this folder there are my notes in form of mostly html files, some markdown, pdf and pictures and some hidden .-files:\n```\n4 /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php(4477): elFinderVolumeDriver->cacheDir('/media/stick/we...')\n5 /mnt/www/ in /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php on line 4298\n[10-Jan-2018 08:06:05 Europe/Berlin] PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Using $this when not in object context in /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:4298\nStack trace:\n0 /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php(4260): elFinderVolumeDriver::mimetypeInternalDetect('/mnt/www/...')\n1 /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php(711): elFinderVolumeDriver->mimetype('/mnt/www/...')\n2 /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php(3429): elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem->_scandir('/mnt/www/...')\n3 /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php(4199): elFinderVolumeDriver->scandirCE('/mnt/www/...')\n4 /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php(4477): elFinderVolumeDriver->cacheDir('/mnt/www/...')\n5 /media/stick/www in /mnt/www/elfinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php on line 4298\n```\ni get the error only for this special subfolder. Since this is only a subfolder, with the same permissions as the parent folder, i didn't have any idea, where this error comes from.\nUpdate. Not opening maximized was a caching issue. I have now tried this with a new browser instance. there it opens maximized. Sorry for that. But the php error exists there also.\n  . The php error seems to come from hidden .-files. If i create a file with touch /path/to/subfolder/.testfile i get the same error for this folder.. Many thx. Now it works.. Ahh thx for the tip. I have changed editors.default.js to this:\n{\n            // Simple Text (basic textarea editor)\n            info : {\n                name : 'TextArea',\n                useTextAreaEvent : true\n            },\n            mimes : [\n                'text/txt',\n                'text/csv'\n            ],\n            load : function(){},\n            save : function(){}\n        }\nfor the Textarea editor. Now i have only the editor i want. \nBTW: There is a small translation error for TextArea Editor or maybe the translation variable is not available. When you select a html file and look in the Main Toolbar, the word for TextArea is untranslated, where in the RightClick menu it is translated (in my case German). . Ok, thx for that info. In that case, i leave it so that the user can download elFinder separate. . ",

Found the problem!\nThe connector sends to the client the value of upload_max_filesize in the php.ini.

If in your application everything works fine that means you are the lucky man :)\n. Your solution is better than mine. I had not thought about it. Very nice.\nCould you do a one more test?\nFind in elFinder.class.php file method \"search\" (near line 2098) and dump $args variable.\nNext open your file manager, open browser console, type something in search input and choose \"All\" option. Copy respond (dump $args variable) from browser console and paste here.\nThis is my example respond:\narray (size=5)\n  'q' => string 'tulips' (length=5)\n  'mimes' => string '' (length=0)\n  'target' => string 'null' (length=4)\n  'debug' => string '' (length=0)\n  'sessionCloseEarlier' => boolean true\nNote the \"target\" key.

Should I open another ticket for that?\n. I'm on PHP 5.3.3 (Debian 6) and I'm using a custom adapter (extends elFinderVolumeDriver, source is available here: https://github.com/flack/openpsa/blob/master/lib/org/openpsa/documents/elFinderVolumeOpenpsa.php), so maybe this has something to do with it. But it worked fine since at least 2.1.8, until 2.1.16 (2.1.17 doesn't run at all on PHP 5.3, so I don't know if this would also exhibit the problem). Thanks for looking into the issue!\nI've tried removing the midcom::get()->finish(); line, and also completely removing the shutdown function, but the warning still appears . I've bisected the issue now, and it looks like it comes from this commit: 7b8053a3bac1b3602830a04ade5a1f0150b708c1. I've tried setting noSessionCache for the volume, but it didn't help. The problem goes away however when I remove this line: https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php#L675. Yes, that gets rid of the warning. BTW, I've looked a bit around, and I think this may only on PHP 5.3 because of this line:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/elFinderSession.php#L41\nSince I instantiate elFinder from inside my framework, there is already a session running (based on Symfony HTTPFoundation). So my guess would be that in php 5.4+, elFinder detects the running session and doesn't try to start, while on 5.3, session_start() gets called a prints the warning. So another possible workaround would be to change this line:\nhttps://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/blob/master/php/elFinderSession.php#L47\nto look like this:\nphp\n    @session_start();. I think I've found a cleaner solution now than suppressing error output and sent a pull request. @nao-pon looks good!. Looks good, thanks!. @nao-pon is there any special configuration option you have to set to get the additional CSS classes? I just tried this in two different elFinder integrations, and the buttons in the dialog only have CSS classes like this: ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only elfinder-btncnt-3 elfinder-tabstop. I can see the classes in your demo site, but I don't see them in my own setups (e.g. here: http://demo.openpsa2.org/documents/). Tested with jquery UI 1.11.4 and 1.12.1. P.S.: I've also tried with the bundled elfinder.html (no modifications made), and this also only gives me elfinder-btncnt-3 and so on, not semantic classnames like elfinder-confirm-btn-rename. ah, ok, sorry, I didn't see that this was closed via a commit. Thanks @nao-pon !. @nao-pon I tried commenting out all the ini_set calls, but it doesn't make a difference. The thing is, it's some sort of memory corruption AFAICT. For example, it says charset 'p-honorific-suffix', then I reload, and the error becomes charset '\ufffd'. The line that triggers the error in my code looks like this:\nphp\n            $string .= ' ' . $key . '=\"' . htmlspecialchars($val, ENT_COMPAT) . '\"';\nSo I don't set the third parameter either. @nao-pon I have debugged some more, and it is a bit hard to be sure, because sometimes the corruption stays until you restart apache, but I'm now relatively sure that the problem is caused by \nphp\nini_set('internal_encoding', 'UTF-8');\nAt least, if I comment out this line on the latest release and restart Apache, I can't seem to reproduce any longer. This might be related: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71876. ini_set('mbstring.internal_encoding', ''); throws a deprecated error on PHP 7.1, but I don't see the corruption problem with these three. @nao-pon I tested shortly and so far, it looks good. Thanks for fixing!. Thanks for the quick fix!\ni just tested and 0 byte files are listed again with your change. There is still one difference to how it behaved before: In 2.1.40, elFinder would display the mimetypes from my custom driver (i.e. what I return from the _stat() function), and in the new version, everything that is 0 bytes has text/plain. Is that intentional?. @nao-pon looks good, thanks again!. ",

Now I get constantly Error dialog - trying to close one dialog I get another one again and again until I press escape. And sometimes after finally closing Error dialog by escape elfinder gets unresponsive (what is linked with modal mode I suppose)\n. just applied changes @ 667b1d1. Fix works perfectly, thank you, amazing work as always!\n. It works! Thank you for your help and quick response!\n. Thank you for response! This disabling works perfectly for folders in root dir, but does not work for subfolders\n. @nao-pon The change  @ 7a4d820 is already in my code, but It seems it does not solve the problem\n. I use mvc controller. Zipdl is in list of disabled commands:\nOption.cs (20)\nprivate static string[] _disabled = new string[] { \"extract\", \"create\", \"zipdl\" };\nSo download is disabled for folders in root directory, but not disabled for file multiple selection.\nAnd just in case connector configuration:\n```\ndriver.AddRoot(new Root(new DirectoryInfo(@volumePath + folder))\n                    {\n                        Alias = \"Home\", \n                        MaxUploadSizeInMb = 3,\n                        MaxRootSizeInMb = 50,\n                        IsLocked = IdentityService.IsReviewer  && ModelService.CurrentReport.Lock,\n                        IsReadOnly = IdentityService.IsReviewer && ModelService.CurrentReport.Lock,\n                        StartPath = new DirectoryInfo(@volumePath + folder + \"/TestFolder\"),\n                        UploadAllow = new List<string> { \"jpg\", \"xlsx\", \"xls\", \"doc\", \"docx\", \"pdf\", \"png\", \"tif\", \"tiff\", \"jpeg\", \"txt\", \"bmp\"}\n                    });`\n\n```\n. I just tried 2.10.0. Now It allows to download multiple files (in my case without making of zip, that is fine for me). So now no error message and multiple download is working fine. Another problem I mentioned in ticket #1278 has been fixed as well. Great work, mate! Thanks!\n. Just applied these changes and got the issue: if you go to the empty folder and try to create new folder in it, the label 'Folder is empty' stays there and columns all are screwed. Could you pls take a look at this?\n. The code I posted above is a part of elfinder.js. If elfinderdialog does not have modal option, then what is 'modal' options about? When I change that option to 'true' all elfinder dialogs get really modal. \n. Yes, thats correct. I would like to have all dialogs of elfinder modal. Thank you!\n. Elfinderdialog now works good, no unresponsive behavior. But the same issue is with confirmation dialog. If I change option modal to true, elfinder gets hanging after closing confirmation dialog\nconfirm : function(opts) {\n        var self     = this,\n            complete = false,\n            options = {\n                cssClass  : 'elfinder-dialog-confirm',\n                modal     : true,\n                resizable : false,\n                title     : this.i18n(opts.title || 'confirmReq'),\n                buttons   : {},\n                close     : function() { \n                    !complete && opts.cancel.callback();\n                    $(this).elfinderdialog('destroy');\n                }\n            },\n. Another place... If you rename folder in the tree with name which already exists you get error dialog 'File name \"xxx\" already exists', after closing that dialog elfinder gets unresponsive again. If I change modal to false in error call (see code fragment below) then no hanging.\n``````\nif (fm.fileByName(name, file.phash)) {\n                            inError = true;\n                            fm.error([file.mime != 'directory' ? 'errExists' : 'errDirExists', name], {modal: true, close: select});\n                            return false;\n``` }\n``````\n. Ok, in that case there is an error: after replacing one folder by another one the tree still keeps the structure of the old folder (not updating accordingly to the changes)\n. I reproduce that issue on local\n. Thank you! Just applied changes and all work perfectly fine!\n. Setting files to unreadable solves the problem for files. But setting folders to unreadable makes folders unable to open. Is there any other option to disable Copy command for locked folders? Thank you!\n. @nao-pon \n. For me that is fine\n. ",

Files mime types are checked at the server, so try to change the mimeDetect connector option (https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#mimedetect).\nToday i had similar problem, when onlyMimes set to text/css didn't work as expected (filtered out css-files that should not).\nThe problem was at the server side: mime types was determined incorrectly. I changed mimeDetect connector option to internal and it solves the problem (on Windows, didn't check it at *nix yet).\nYou can see what mime types server set for each file by looking into server response. It is the first place where i had started from to find the reason of the problem.\n. @canbozdemir, mimeDetect option is connector option (under root key) and should be set on server side, not in javascript. In my case mimeDetect by default was set to finfo and it caused to incorrect mime types for some files. After setting it to internal my problem was resolved. Just try.\nLook at documentation: https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options-2.1#mimeDetect.\n. @canbozdemir, sorry i'm not familiar with ASP.NET. In my case with backend on PHP mimeDetect option worked out my issue with mime types. For example, without changing this option, by default for css-files server determined mime-types differently: for some css-files it was text/x-c++, for some correct text/css. This issue is all about server. Client just tells a server that it should respond only with files that match specified mime-types.If server determines mime-types wrong \u2014 client will recive wrong files list.\nWhait for @nao-pon, maby he clarify about ASP.NET.\n. @canbozdemir, nothing bro :)\nWait for @nao-pon, he can tell you more than I.\n. @canbozdemir, so, at first place you should discover how your server determines files' mime-types.\nMaybe there is some similar server option, like mimeDetect.

Also I wanted to rename files like 1.jpg, 2.jpg, .......\nBut there isn't any option to do it.\nSo I leave space in name & it say it will be rename like this\n\nBut actually it rename like this\n\n. also there is another bug.\n\nclose that error massage.\nyou can see background files can select now (background disable layer has gone)\n\n. second bug is not present now.\nI'll check if its present special procedure.  . https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/1702\nThis happening again.

So if database not set in connector side and only set list of file/folder in connector side, only cookies saved in browser for only that user, list of that user hidden file/folder & un-hide file/folder that connector send hidden).\nAnd also I think there is two hidden level.\nFirst level is just like above method (connector send file list but api not show it.)\nSecond level is connector doesn't send that file/folder in list but user can open it using elFinder api hash  url (and also only send in it with connector send file list to admin or permission given user) . imagine users have permissions to access .tmb folder(or any other folder) in volume for cleanup it.\nBut it isn't necessary to show always.\nSo default settings for that folder is hidden & user can un-hide & access it when he want to cleanup it.\nthe hidden levels are just suggestion but when think about it, it unnecessary to elfinder.. https://codeload.github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/zip/master\nhttps://codeload.github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/zip/e929d134db2075f5a2f0c959f86d02e6b7fcee30\nalso I try it in chrome incognito mode.

Thanks for the tip, the 2.1 nightly branch has the same problem.  The problem seems to start with the \"Presentation Tips.ppt\" file. Looking at the HTML, the pattern changes on this file. There is a pattern of divs, 1 for each file.  When it gets to the Presentation Tips.ppt file, its div contains divs for all the files that are stacked under it.

Unfortunately adding chmod to the options.commands did not solve the issue.\nI only found a little additional hint whats going on : In internet explorer, pressing refresh, i can see for a very short time the icon in the toolbar, it is the forth image in the file toolbar.png ( orange coloured star), possibly class .elfinder-button-icon-chmod     { background-position: 0  -48px; }.\nNeither in toolbar nor in contextmenu chmod is shown.\n. Hi Naoki,\nI did some debugging and found three things that maybe bugs and one error caused by missing php module posix.  I use elFinder-master from 2016-06-13 15:14\n1)     Documentation says that one has to set StatOwner to true, cause StatOwner by default is false and disables command chmod.\nIn elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php , line 739 statOwner is checked instead of Statowner.

Reason is that f.isowner is false, caused by undefined function posix_getuid() , missingPHP module posix.\nSolution : Installed module php-posix.\nNow chmod apparently works.\nThanks for Your hints , it would be nice if You could check whether the things I found are really bugs and incorporate the changes in the actual release\nBest regards Gerhard\nVon: Naoki Sawada [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nGesendet: Mittwoch, 15.

After furter testing I've found what's going on; hope you can understand my explanation, otherwise I'll set up a test environment.\nI'm adding \"quota\" limit to my volumes, so I've bound actions that change root folder size to a callback function that recalculate volume size.\nMy code is like this:\nphp\n    $root = array(\n        'driver'          => 'LocalFileSystem',\n        'disabled'        => <function that returns 2 different arrays based on the user over-quota status>,\n        'path'            => $path,\n        ...\n    );\n    $opts = array(\n      'roots' => $roots,\n      'bind'  => array(\n         'edit extract mkdir mkfile rm duplicate paste upload put' => 'clear_size_cache',\n      ),\n    );\nFunction clear_size_cache() returns TRUE to force elFinder to update itself.\nWhen the user gets over-quota, elFinder gets a different array of disabled actions.\nToolbar actions are correctly removed, context menu are not.\nAfter a full page refresh will update the context menu correctly.\n. Version 2.1.13.\nWill now try latest master, if it matters.\nI'm wondering if the 'disabled' root parameter affects only the client-side or the server-side too.\nI mean: on my side paste is one of the disabled actions. It disappeared from the toolbar but still present in the context menu (after bind callback is executed not after a full page reload).\nSo I think the action is only hidden and not disabled and the server-side connector will still execute it; if so, what if the client sends a \"specially crafted\" AJAX request with the paste command?\n. Just to be clearer: returning a different list of disabled actions (after an action is executed) affects only the toolbar and not the context menu.\n. Tried with master and have the same behavior.\nAs I wrote in my previous comment my call back already returns TRUE: in fact the toolbar updates but the context menu doesn't.\n. No, open is not disabled, but what I supposed being a bug is in fact a \"misbehavior\".\nI have a sample to show what I mean, but will start another more specific issue.\n. That's fine, but how could I update it after a, say, copy/paste action?\nI mean, paste action will trigger an AJAX request that updated files list.\nIs there a way to add custom data to be sent to the client within the same AJAX request of paste action?\nOr maybe add custom data to each root object (quota value) and update the status bar when user switches between roots?\n. That's good, will try soon.\nThanks.\n.

I have only one PHP function bound to 'open', and this callback function is called correctly.\nHere I set the $results['_volume_size'] element without errors.\nThe issue is at the client side, where js function receives a null e.data value.\nelf.bind('open', function(e) {\n    var size = e.data._volume_size;   // <-- *** e.data IS NULL! ***\n});\nIt seems that the received e.data is always null: I tried open, rm and paste commands.\n. My bad, I forgot the .elfinder('instance') part, so I was binding to something else.\nIt now works but still have another quirk:\nthe additional  appears correctly in status bar then it suddenly disappears.\nI suppose it's because of the true returned by PHP callback that forces elFinder to refresh.\nI tried to bind to sync command but it doesn't work...\nWhich event is raised when returning true from PHP callback?\n. That's exactly what I was looking for: a local storage for custom data sent trough AJAX.\nThanks a lot.\n. Oops, you're right.\nI've cleaned it up too much, now fixed ;)\nPS: elFinder version is 2.1.13\n. Great, will wait next Nightly build then delete my test repo.\nThanks.\n. In 2.1.13 Nightly build (2016-07-17) $volume == false for rm command.\n. Yes it works.\nI only had to change your sample from $arg to $args (in function body).\nThanks\n. ",

Ah, for the blinking animation when a new folder is created, I think I found a way to do it:\n``` \n// First, I created a function based on elFinder's Blink function and then reduce the timing\nfunction blink(elm, mode) {\n    var acts = {\n        slowonce : function(){elm.hide().delay(150).fadeIn(250).delay(100).fadeOut(500);},\n        lookme   : function(){elm.show().fadeOut(100).fadeIn(150);}\n    }, func;\n    mode = mode || 'slowonce';\nfunc = acts[mode] || acts['lookme'];\n\nelm.stop(true, true);\nfunc();\n\n}\n// and then I override the elFinder's blink function through its instance\nelFinderInstance.resources.blink = blink;\n```\nI'm not sure if this is the right way to do this. But this works for me. \ud83d\ude42 \nHowever, I still can't find a way to adjust the animation of expanding/collapsing folder tree.\nCan anyone help me with this?\n.

By extending the \"sort\" command maybe? Or perhaps... set elfinder.ui.tree as null after elfinder is initialized?. ",

(we will try to work on this)\nBut this is why we use a named instance of jQuery and not '$'...\n. @nao-pon \nGoing forward with these tests we commented lines 12064 and 12065 \nin file elfinder.full.js from Version 2.1.14 (2016-07-25)\ndeclared in $.fn.elfindertoolbar = function(fm, opts) \n\nAn this solves the name conflict with Mootools => elFinder works then perfectly\nHow can we help any futher ?\nBest regards\n. @nao-pon Hello,\nIn fact we just commented self.trigger('load');\nThat is calling any 'load' event binded by any library to any element of the DOM tree in current selector.\nThis caused the problem with Mootools.\non('load') seems only used in (12131)\nfm.bind('load', function() {\n    swipeHandle = $('<div class=\"elfinder-toolbar-swipe-handle\"/>').appendTo(fm.getUI());\n    if (swipeHandle.css('pointer-events') !== 'none') {\n        swipeHandle.remove();\n        swipeHandle = null;\n    }\n});\nPerhaps a simple function could do the job ?\n. @nao-pon \nOK, we'll create a sample an then discuss about it\nBest regards\n. @nao-pon \nHello, after a while we come back to this idea...\nI just would like to create a droppable div where a user can drop images (easy)\nThen i'd like to send this image to the server using the elFinder connector using JS.\nAny idea on how to do this ?\n. @nao-pon Hello Nao Pon,\nYes, this is the excellent elFinder user interface.\nWhen you drop images or documents it SENDS data to the elFinder connector.\nThis connector is excellent too !\nWhat i imagine is a simple  accepting drops (so easy to do)\nand i'd like to send this dropped imgae (or doc) to the same elFinder connector.\nThink about a user profile with a picture.\nWe dont want the user to \n- open a dialog (elFinder), \n- select a directory, \n- drop his/her image, \n- select it \n- and validate the dialog.\nWe just want the user to drop his/her picture in the  and its done.\nThe question is :  How do i call the connector, what ajax parameters do i need ?\n. Very nice.\nBut how to obtain an elf instance without display ?\nHere it is bound to #elfinder and must be displayed...\nBest regards. Thank you for your answer @nao-pon .\nBut i'm in the server using PHP and would like to create a connector instance and address it's methods\nRegards. Sorry, i did not notice commands listeners.\nYes it's perfect ;-). ",
    "BitStinker": "Very cool. I see version 2.1.14, but not 2.1.15 in the releases. Am I missing something?\n\n. Perhaps I am not understanding properly. The hash value of the volume is required to fill in phash, but the volume has not yet been mounted when setting up the configuration. How does one assume a volume hash value when it is not yet defined?\n. Works like a charm! \nFor the uninitiated, the hash for the group volume appears to be\n$volume->driverId + $volume->options['id'] + '_Lw'\nwhere the ending \"Lw\" is the hash for \"/\".\n\n. I FTP to the NAS using the elfinder FTP volume. I actually do it to two different NAS boxes. One onsite, the other offsite.. I don't know if it is possible without using FTP. Sorry.. Perfect!\n.

Here is the php code:\n``` php\nprotected function chgref( $args ) {\n    global $qxSQL;\n$cat = substr( $args['target'], 0, 6 );\n\nfile_put_contents( \"chgref.txt\", print_r( $args, true ) );\n$sQ = \"SELECT Ancestors FROM tblProjects WHERE ProjectTag LIKE '%{$cat}%' LIMIT 1\";\nif( $result = $qxSQL->q( $sQ ) ) {\n    if( $row = $result->fetch_row() ) {\n        $a = explode( ',', $row[0] );\n        if( $args['op'] == 'add' )\n            $a[] = $args['ref'];\n        else\n            $a = array_diff( $a, Array( $args['ref'] ) );\n        $a = array_unique( $a );\n        $row[0] = implode( ',', $a );\n        $sQ = \"UPDATE tblProjects SET Ancestors = '{$row[0]}' WHERE ProjectTag LIKE '%{$cat}%';\";\n        $qxSQL->q( $sQ );\n        $this->makeOpts( $args['target'], true ); // make the new elfinder opts\n        if( !session_id() )\n            $this->session->start();\n        $this->sessionWrite();\n        $this->session->start();\n    }\n}\n\n$result = $args;\n\nreturn $result;\n\n}\n```\n.

    "jacceko": "Maybe this is an option - online editor with in url send file:\nhttps://www.sejda.com/developers#web-integration\n. Memory limit and upload limit - is the same, it is the same server with few instalation of php and same user.ini with custom memory limit and upload limit, but I investigate a little more and find out that is not problem with saving file but with reading.  \nJust after saving from in php 5.4 (ok) I change to php 7.0 and then I see that the same file is not possible to read. The same file is possible to read or not depend of php version.  Maybe you know that it can be, because after change to 7.0 icon of the file is different - file is still .docx but icon from typical .docx is changed to .bin ?? (and icon only changed with file saved by zoho, copy of the same file not re-saved with zoho has normal icon). User rights on server for both files are the same.\nLook at screen shot - first re-saved by zoho, second original file without re-save by zoho:\n \nafter change back to the php 5.4 both files is OK again -with docx icon.\n. In php 5.6 or higher  - file type is displayed: Application \nbut on second file with the same extension is displayed: Microsoft Word Document (this not resaved by Zoho)\nHow it recognize mime type if not base of extension ?\n(or it save mime type when upload is made?)\nEdit 1: I check php \"mime_content_type\":\nIn php 5.6 and higher:\ndocx from word: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nresaved in zoho:  application/octet-scream (NOT WORK) - bin icon\nin php 5.4 work OK both version:\ndocx from word: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nresaved in zoho:  application/zip  (BUT IT WORK) -  word icon ok\nEdit 2:\nI find on internet that many person have such problem in another frameworks. \nThen I edit my elFinderVolumeDriverClass.php and after this:\n'docx:application/zip' => 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',\n'xlsx:application/zip' => 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet xlsx',\npptx:application/zip' => 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation',\nadd this:\n'docx:application/octet-stream' => 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',\n'xlsx:application/octet-stream'=> 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet xlsx',\n'pptx:application/octet-stream' => 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation'      \nI found another solution maybe good for future of ElFinder to be sure that in all version of php always every extension work the same. It not base of php magic.mime files , but  based of apache mime type definition file which is easy to download and parse.\nFor example (in example mime.type downloaded file, but it can be local file distributed with ElFinder, and update with update sometimes with ElFinder update)\nfunction generateUpToDateMimeArray($url){\n    $return = array();\n    $mimes = file_get_contents('http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types'); \n    preg_match_all('#^([^\\s]{2,}?)\\s+(.+?)$#ism', $mimes, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);  \n    foreach ($matches as $match){\n        $exts = split(\" \", $match[2]);\n        foreach ($exts as $ext){\n            $return[$ext]=$match[1];\n        }\n    }\n    return $return;\n}\n// usage:\n$typeMime = generateUpToDateMimeArray();\necho $typeMime['gif'];\nEdit 3:\nOr similar class with composer download:\nhttps://github.com/ralouphie/mimey\n        . Work excellent - thanks!. I download newest version (mime work ok for zoho, for google viewer work all type of file with application/postscript too - .ai and .eps now work), but MS Office Viewer not work.\n\nWhen I put both googleDocsMimes with all options and officeOnlineMimes with all options  - work only Google. When I put  googleDocsMimes empty, and officeOnlineMimes full options from example, it not work,  It not show progress circle even! \n(to be sure that is not problem of browser cache I use another browser and for test I change php version)\nI put in my main.js:\n googleDocsMimes :['application/pdf', 'image/tiff', 'application/vnd.ms-office', 'application/msword', 'application/vnd.ms-word', 'application/vnd.ms-excel', 'application/vnd.ms-powerpoint','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation', 'application/postscript'],\n officeOnlineMimes : ['application/msword', 'application/vnd.ms-word', 'application/vnd.ms-excel', 'application/vnd.ms-powerpoint', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet']\ni try too:\n googleDocsMimes : [],\nofficeOnlineMimes : ['application/msword', 'application/vnd.ms-word', 'application/vnd.ms-excel', 'application/vnd.ms-powerpoint', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet']\nI try to put it direct to elFinder.options.js but now luck too.                 . Thanks nightly build - OK  - my fault \nOffice Viewer work excellent - faster then google, big thanks :-). @CodeLyokoXtEAM ask about pdf too, \nPhotopea has best edit options for pdf -not only add elements to pdf but can edit text, images from pdf.. @nmpetkov ask about some image enhancement tools too, this will be possible with this converter.. My idea was such, if I press right button on for example file.jpg in context memu I have: Convert - and submenu for ex: .bmp, gif, png, bmp, tiff.  I click one of it format and conversion is made.\nBy this simplest api below if possible (first or second - by upload or by url):\nhttps://apiv2.online-convert.com/docs/getting_started/job_remote_file.html, \nhttps://apiv2.online-convert.com/docs/getting_started/job_uploading_file.html\nLast option will be: Custom (additionally adjustment) and then when you press custom then it will be open new tab as suggest @nao-pon or iframe like suggest @CodeLyokoXtEAM where you adjust additional convert param like size of image, color etc.\nIs it possible ?. It will be only 3 class for converts the \"format to\" (they are short enough for submenu):\nimages: bmp eps gif exr ico jpg jpeg png svg tga tiff wbmp webp + custom\ndocument: doc docx sxw html odt pdf ppt pptx rtf txt + custom\naudio: acc aiff flac m4a mmf mp3 ogg opus wav wma + custom\nI think that we can ommit: archive converter, ebook converter, webservice or hash generator\nvideo - Custom option only, because too big files etc.\nI can prepare exact matrix which format can convert to which format @nao-pon . Your are fast :-) @nao-pon \n- I only can't see anything on link to \"my developer site\" I see only: aaa\nnothing more (in source is many scripts etc) but on screen (html) is only: aaa\nThen I can't try your solution  . Iframe is better for sure, but from me is the most important is that file will be saved to ElFinder, but not downloaded to disk. I think about usability for user, are you look already at this simple useage too for direct conversion: https://apiv2.online-convert.com/docs/getting_started/job_remote_file.html \nsome onlineconverter bug additionally:\nOnline converter has problem with url with spaces -in this example normally when click convert work, but when go to small link: for ex. change setting of jpg - then special character for space is changed to white space and then not work when try to convert.\n. Thanks a lot for your work :-) @nao-pon . :-). I am happy to see, on dev site working example with saving to ElFinder :-). ",

Here the image with default theme\n\n. @nao-pon, I found that the error occur only when the elfinder container is initially hidden. In my case I'm using elfinder inside bootstrap collapse but you can reproduce the error setting the  elfinder container display property to none and change it in browser developer console. \nI don't know why but you will reproduce the error more easily with a fresh opened browser. In this way the error always occur but if other tabs or windows of the same browser are opened the error occur very randomly.\n. I tried both versions and the error happened:\n\nIf you click in the button while elfinder is 'loading' (with a dialog 'open folder' and progress bar visible) no error occur. You will see the error if you click the button after elfinder is loaded. Try wait about 5 seconds before clicking.... With a small width as in your capture I had dificulty to reproduce the error too. Try with this link: http://output.jsbin.com/kowuqi.\n\nAs you can see in my capture, instead of waiting about 5 seconds you can monitore when the ajax call ends, so you can click,\nIt seems the problem is related with the initial 'loading' dialog header not being removed if the container is hidden. In my capture you see that if I change to a folder that takes a long time to load and you hide elfinder before the loading is complete, when click to show elfinder (after the folder is loaded)  the empty dialog appear.\n.

Hi @AnilaKhan10 !\nI've uploaded elFinder with google-drive-php-client on the folder that you specified. However, it's not public accessible and I couldn't try if it's working. By the way, if you make it public, you should be able to connect to your Google Drive by mounting a new unit via the elFinder UI. \nIf you want to automount the unit, you should follow @nao-pon indications on how to get the refresh token. You have also to configure your folderId and this refresh token in connector.php file.\nFurthermore, change your cPanel credentials because it's not a good idea to expose them anywhere, for instance, here... :)\nHope it works!. I can't help you with this error, the same code works for me. Maybe some missing module on your PHP? \nHave you configured your callback URL when configuring your credentials on Google?\n.

If I use the \"preview\" button, it will play properly in a modal dialog. If I double-click it though, it opens in-line in a new window and will not play. Could you try this on your server and see if it has the same issue? I'm using the Dropbox driver.\n. Ok, that seems to work, although I don't really like the fact that it shows the published link in the new window's URL.\nIs there a way to make it open the file in a new tab, instead of a new window?. Ok, that seems to work, although I don't really like the fact that it shows the published link in the new window's URL.\nIs there a way to make it open the file in a new tab, instead of a new window?. After some more research, it looks like this is happening on line 892 of elFinderVolumeDropbox.class.php. It's using the /shares endpoint of the Dropbox API, which creates a permanent share link. At an absolute minimum, it should be using the /media endpoint instead, which creates a link that is good for 4 hours. Although even for the /media endpoint, the documentation explicitly states:\n\nThis URL should not be used to display content directly in the browser.\n\nAnd that's for the reasons that I mentioned in the OP (anyone sniffing the connection could see a request to that URL and visit it themselves). I think the only real solution is to either:\n1) instead of using the /shares API endpoint to view the file, get the file contents internally using the /files (GET) endpoint, then output it in its entirety to the browser, OR\n2) use the /media endpoint to create a temporary link to the file, then stream the contents to the browser through the connector file\nI think these are the only ways you will have any real security here.. Thanks, I understand now. Is there a way to use a pre-existing API token though, instead of having to register it?. After looking at the source code, I see that in the client configuration you can specify a \"soundpath\" option, which fixed the issue when I set it as the actual path of the sound files. This configuration option is not listed in the Wiki for the Client Configuration Options though, so you may want to add that.. I'm using the \"upload.pre\" callback function to encrypt the file before it is sent to Dropbox. Since it's using base64 encoding after the encryption, the size of the file sent to Dropbox is notably larger than the size of the file that the user was trying to upload. Is there no way to override this check for this kind of use case? I thought that's what the point of the \"upload.pre\" callback was for.. ",

Basically it seems like if it was having issues to process the server response and gets stuck in some odd loop. We do have another background XHR requests on the page that are being called every 10 seconds and those keep coming so it's clearly not killing the browser thread completely just taking up a lot of resources with no real result. I wonder if it might have something to do with the tree syncing and the data we are sending from our backend although we've been running 2.0 for ages and 1.x before that with no similar problems (but again the API changed over time and maybe we have something a bit off in our 2.1 implementation)..

Hi, for initial request the API is present. see file for the initial call response\nelfinder_server-resp.txt\n. Tree dumped, no change.

Then I did git bisect and found that d5ce45b is the first commit with this problem.\nI looked at requests from elFinder client to connector and found that on https://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/ every file upload consists of 2 requests: \"ls\" and then \"upload\" commands. But on my server only the first file upload looks like that (and the first file uploads correctly). All subsequent uploads conist of 4 requests:\n1. cmd=ls\n   target=A_L3Rlc3Q_E\n   intersect[]=1C\n1. cmd=open\n   reload=1\n   target=A_L3Rlc3Q_E\n   tree=1\n   compare\n1. cmd=ls\n   target=A_L3Rlc3Q_E\n   intersect[]=1C\n1. ```\n   -----------------------------148555191713858134561052379747\n   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"cmd\"\nupload\n   -----------------------------148555191713858134561052379747\n   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"target\"\nA_L3Rlc3Q_E\n   -----------------------------148555191713858134561052379747\n   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"upload[]\"; filename=\"1C\"\n   Content-Type: application/octet-stream\n-----------------------------148555191713858134561052379747\n   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"mtime[]\"\n1499745991\n   -----------------------------148555191713858134561052379747\n   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"upload_path[]\"\nA_L3Rlc3Q_E\n   -----------------------------148555191713858134561052379747\n   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"dropWith\"\n0\n   -----------------------------148555191713858134561052379747--\n   ```\nAnd \"open\" request lasts much longer than subsequent \"ls\" and \"upload\". I think there could be some issue with asynchronous handling of responses.\n1. Upload works fine and the file appears in the view.\n1. ElFinder client handles response to the \"open\" command. This command was sent before the \"upload\" command, and the response does not contain new files.\n1. ElFinder client updates the view and uploaded files disappear.\nSo I have 2 questions:\n1. Why elFinder client sends \"open\" command to server? Maybe I should set some client options, or maybe connector sends incorrect response to the first \"open\" command (with \"init\" flag set)?\n1. Why elFinder client sends \"ls\" and \"upload\" commands before it recieves response to the \"open\" command? Maybe I do something wrong?. For now elFinder do not send the open command. Only ls, then upload. All works correctly.. > If the uploading file name is exists in results of ls and CWD does not have that file, elFinder will request the open command and try to keep the CWD up to date.\nFor now I do not see this behavior. I tried:\n1. Clear the folder\n1. Create a file in that folder from server console\n1. Upload a file into that folder with the same name\nElFinder client sent only 2 requests: ls and upload.. Did the same test on 2.1.25:\n1. 1st ls request\n1. 1st ls response\n1. open request\n1. 2nd ls request\n1. 2nd ls response\n1. upload request\n1. upload response\n1. open response. Captured full conversations for 2 cases:\n- subsequent upload of files A and B into empty directory /test\n2.1.25_upload_ab.txt\n2.1.latest_upload_ab.txt\n- upload of file A when it is present on the server, but client does not know about that\n  2.1.25_upload_existing.txt\n2.1.latest_upload_existing.txt\nNow I see at least one bug in the connector: it seems that it does not understand intersect parameter of the ls command.\n. I modified response from connector to match this format. Now ElFinder client works as expected. I think this issue could be closed.\nPlease update the wiki if there are some other errors in API description.. ",

And I am sorry I don't know where to add \"added\" you asked above.\n\n. @nao-pon Can you tell me where to add this \"added\" parameter?

Thanks for reply. . I just tried another one (https://packagist.org/packages/benjamincrozat/laravel-dropbox-driver) and still get the same message.\nAm I wrong to assume elFinder is using mimetype to define files? Because it seems Dropbox v2 is using file extension instead.. Ok this has been fixed in the adapter: https://github.com/spatie/flysystem-dropbox/commit/6af2f52fa14406d03031581a2969fb0d94832fb9. @nao-pon Thanks for quick answer.\nYes we are using FlySystem adaptor. I thought it was issue with it, but when I use it stand alone without involving ElFinder, then we got list of all the files in 2-3 seconds from every locations.\nThe MIME-Type determination can be a way to start digging into it.\nWhat tests can we make in order to exclude issue from ElFinder?. I did another test, just running the command from the adaptor without involving ElFinder:\n$contents = $filesystem->listContents();\n(based on https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/api/)\nAnd I got the data in 2-3s. So I'm thinking something the ElFinder request to the adaptor that makes it READ files instead of LIST files?.

And this is despite the fact that, according to the documentation, it works in place of the standard plug-in image in the same way.\nI will be grateful to any of your advice if this is within the scope of this issue!. @nao-pon, Thank you very much, you are a wonderful man!\nBut there are very few left, and you probably missed something, because D & D again stopped working, the error {error: [\"errCmdParams\", \"upload\"]} returned :'-|.

It's hit and miss with re-logging in without having to enter credentials again but that appears to be unrelated to elfinder.. ultimately you still need the password to login initially so I think that is OK for my intended usage.\nThankyou again for your help, I will be donating this week.. edit: still investigating. The changes do work, thanks for that, but discovered an issue with Safari on the Iphone.\nIf you enter enter a wrong user/pass on the form. Safari opens up the standard basic authentication form rather than saying \"Login failed \"user:pass\" and taking you back to the form login.\nif you enter correct password in basic authen screen, it logs in but then you can't change users unless you close out of Safari.. Yes agreed, thanks again for your prompt responses.. ",

    "ManuSori": "Hi nao!\nI'm not as good at programming in PHP as you are, but from what I'm reviewing and checking, it seems that the server gives me problems because of its age.\nIt's an FTP server mounted on Windows, it's called \"Serv-U\" (serv-u.com) but in version 5.0 (currently serving 15.0).\nI have made two more tests with the demo version of Serv-U (15.0) mounted on Windows, and also with proFTPD in a Debian 9. I haven't had any problems opening folders in either of them. So I'm going to try to put debugging functions in the FTP Class to see if I can get the error message that gives me with the folder permissions.\nIf you come up with any ideas for debugging, I'm all eyes for reading.\nA greeting.. Hi Nao!\nLet me explain, \nI think there is a conflict with the functions that PHP uses to manage the FTP server we have installed. But it's an old-fashioned problem with our server. This server is installed on a 32-bit Windows XP and is 13 years old. So it's absurd to look for a solution for elFinder. I have already proposed to make a server change and update it. There are open source servers that work very well with \"elFinder\" and I don't want headaches for a \u201cfopen\u201d function with an obsolete server.\nAnyway, don't think we're going to change the server for your application. We are going to do so because it is clear that we will continue to have problems of incompatibility.\nIf you want, I'll explain it in the forum, or you can close the conversation. But it doesn't really matter.\nManu Soriano\nDe: Naoki Sawada [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nEnviado el: viernes, 10 de noviembre de 2017 13:23\nPara: Studio-42/elFinder elFinder@noreply.github.com\nCC: ManuSori regiem5@gmail.com; Mention mention@noreply.github.com\nAsunto: Re: [Studio-42/elFinder] Cannot view folder content in FTP Driver (#2248)\n@ManuSori https://github.com/manusori  Did you solve this problem?

I commented all the other libs I use in my app and so it worked. I will investigate how to fix it, thanks and sorry for your time spent on my error.. I thought it was not possible as I did not see listed the \"click\" in your handlers events.\nI will give it a try, thanks.. Meanwhile, I am not very expert programmer as you might see, I would like to debug some \"rename.pre\" I have added to the connector, but I am not able to find a way while using the Firefox \"console web\" on my html page. \nI tried sending from the php some \"echo\", \"print_r\", \"var_dump\" but I do not see them on the console. I also enabled the \"E_ALL\" on the error_reporting, but I suspect the console web is not the right instrument.\nAny suggestion ?. I changed idea and used the dblclick event at the moment. thanks for your help.. Maybe I have not explained properly, let me try to rephrase my question.\nI would like to add in the listview a new column to set a file property.\nIt is a checkbox that I will use onchecked or onunchecked for my scope.\nHope this is possible, if not please answer me anyway. Thanks, appreciated.. @nao-pon \ndo you have any suggestion?\nThanks in advance for your help.. @nao-pon What I want is to have a checkbox for each file in the listview, that I can check or uncheck as I wish and have an event linked to this click. Nothing to do with the selection.\nSomething like this\n\nI would like to be able to run a command on a file with just one click, and not with a click to select and then another click to run my command.\nIt is an HIDE/SHOW layers on a map.. Thanks it works but not completely.\n1) this checkbox should remember its value for the entire session. So if I check a file, then change folder, when I came back that file must be still checked.\n2) It would be perfect, if I can select multiple files and then press once a checkbox to check/uncheck all those selected.\nShould I open a new request?\nthanks a lot for your work and help.. @nao-pon I do not find any documentation/explanation of the sessionStorage you mention above.. @nao-pon \nHi, I almost completed my implementation of these checkbox but testing on mobile they are not showing the tick when checked (it looks like they are disabled, but in reality the bootCallback works).\nCan you fix it?\nthanks. I do not know what happened but I solved it.\n. Again it happened but I am not able to understand why. thanks I will give it a try. thanks so I will close this. I thought this was fixed but it is not.\nI have downloaded the last nightly build but I still see this problem using safari both on mobile as well as in the desktop.\nPlease let me know, thanks.. I updated using the last night library, but I am still having the same problem using Safari (not only with the touch but also on the PC using the mouse).\nThe callback works but it is not showing the tick on the square.\nIf I use Firefox everything is ok.\nCould you please give a try to this:\nhttp://globalterramaps.com/TerraVENEW.html?GEC=5\nthanks.\n. @nao-pon \nI am sorry to reply so late, but I did not get any notification about your answer above.\nI am still having the same problem.\nIn the screen shot above I do not see any checkbox ticked.\nCan you please tick one and resend me the screen shot?\nWe use iPhone 7, iPad, iPad Pro, iPhone 8 with different iOS version, including 12.0.1 and also we used Safari from PC Mac, but NONE of them are able to tick these checkboxs. The operation work but the checkbox is not ticked.\nPlease let me know, I am really sorry having completed my project and I cannot publish it for this reason.\nThanks as usual for your help. . @nao-pon \nAt this point I do not understand anymore how can this be possible.\nDo you think it is a matter of our Safari configuration? \nAre you using Safari? I am asking just to be sure.\n. Sorry, I am able to reproduce your situation. I am sure I can fix it now.\nSorry again.. @nao-pon mine seems to be a Safari checkbox problem.\nIn a particular situation I check/uncheck programmatically those checkbox.\nIt works in Firefox works this command \ncheckbox.checked=true or false \nWith Safari it is not working.\n. In you comments above you mentioned there are strange column size, how can I set a column size programmatically?. I now fixed all about the checkbox thanks a lot.\nYou mean I cannot change column size programmatically?. @nao-pon \nok.\nIs there a way to use the \"view\" vs \"view-list\" switching icon?\nI have created my own command to switch between two different divs, I would like to assign this command to an elfinder toolbar button behaving like the current \"view\" (changing icon when clicked).. sorry my fault. @nao-pon \nIt is happening only in a webview called from the iOS app.\nIt does not happen in Safari from the same mobile device.\nI know the webview browser of iOS app is not 100% like the Safari browser, but I frankly do not know how to debug it.\nDo you have any suggestion?. Thank you anyway\nI hope I solved. ",

To backup and overwrite, select Backup.)\n. studyx.zip\nI have a file structure similar to the attached zip.  If I try to upload any of the folders 2 or more levels deep, nothing happens.  It does not upload the folder.. But if the folder below it has files it still does not upload.  I would think that it would check for files in the sub-directories as well.. @nao-pon I tested the new build and it does fix one of the issues.  However, if you test with the zip file here, you will notice that when you try to upload folder subject05 or subject06, It will start with the \"hurdle\" subfolder.  It should start with subject05 or subject06.  It works as expected when uploading subject16.\nsubject.zip\n. ",
    "iambudi": "My mistake, This is my own error message \ud83d\ude05.. @nao-pon Yes, any sample or reference doc for this?\nUsing 'defaults'      => ['hidden' => true] \nand in the attributes => [] set to which folder with hidden => false.\nIs that the correct way?. The folders are shared among users, not one folder dedicated to one user by root 'path' => '/path/to/files/' assignment.\nI want user to see only specific folder as authorized.\nLet's say i have the following folder structures and authorized to user A and B.\n\nDocuments (A)\nPictures (A, B)\n--- Events (A, B)\n--- --- School (A)\n--- --- Public (B)\n--- --- Others (A,B)\n--- Design (A)\n--- Family (Not A,B)\nDownloads (Not A,B)\nApplications (Not A,B)\n\nSo if user A open elfinder, All the root folders will be hidden and he can see only Documents and Pictures. At the same time user B open elfinder, he can only see folder Pictures.\nThe authorization is not stop there, It would also apply to the Pictures's sub folders.\nSo far for the root folders i use config defaults hidden set to true then i use attribute pattern to handle the sub folders authorization. \nI need your suggest for a better way to handle this. This can make elFinder become more flexible to authorize to any level of sub folders.. @nao-pon Superb!. Working well. Thank you so much.. ",

    "mananjobanputra": "This problem seems to have arrived sometime around Bootstrap 3.33 - prior to that things seemed to work just fine but starting with 3.34 and later things started going south. The problem is that many modern applications use fixed, absolute and relative positioning to lay out their user interface. The above problem occurs when the Modal dialog sits within a container that has any parent that uses either fixed, absolute or relative positioning. The change post 3.34 of bootstrap was that the modal overlay was moved to the DOM root below  while the actual modal dialog content in this case is sitting inside of a separate nested DOM structure.\nYou can solve this issue by below code.\n$('body').on('show.bs.modal','.note-editor .modal', function () {\n        $(this).appendTo(\"body\");\n });.

Made subclass of \"Empty\" cmd and then give title we want to the new command. And then map empty to the new command. Cool. Thanks.. Already did the similar but when user chooses same folder and accepts to overwrite same folder, that uploading process pop-up opens very late. And hence my code gets undesired result.\nCode below:\n    if ($('span.elfinder-notify-msg').is(':visible') && typeof int === 'undefined') {\n        var int = self.setInterval(open_permission_model, 1000);\n        $(\"#openmodel\").hide();\n    } else {\n        $(\"#openmodel\").show();\n        window.clearInterval(int);\n        return false;\n    }\n\nBut I will try your code. Thanks.. @nao-pon Same problem with your example code too. The condition gets false even before starting the actual upload progress. Any alternate way?. @nao-pon Thanks for your time to reply back. But this isn't working. I am getting event.data multiple times when uploading a folder(with other folders and files in it). I write event.data, event.data.added and event.data.added.length in console with above code. See the console log result in screen-shot.\n\nI am using it in Laravel application with Wrapper package so I am not sure this is issue with wrapper. I will check with plain setup of elFinder.. @nao-pon Yes, that is intended but the problem is, to check dialog disappeared or not. Using above code this isn't possible that is why I was asking about event to know that the process of uploading finished for all files and dialog disappeared. But unable to do so.\nUse case: I want to show popup, to folder uploader, to set permissions for each role of my application at the end of upload process finishes. But what happens is, the permission setup pop-up, which I added in bind, gets displayed before upload process finishes. And that is creating problem. I am setting first hash name in pop-up title(i.e. Folder name) and other child folder/file hashes, I set in hidden fields to update permissions for all at once. But without knowing uploading finished event, it is difficult to show final ready pop-up.\nYou can see in the below screen-shot that popup gets displayed though uploading still is in progress as visible in back of the permission pop-up.\n\nI am trying other ways like setting z-index of progress bar higher than the permission pop-up and adding back-drop, etc. But I am not sure how user friendly it would be. Thanks for your support.. Time related condition would not work. I am still getting alert before upload finishes with above code. See screen-shot:\n\n. @nao-pon Yes, demo working well. Upload progress pop-up gets open almost immediately in demo but not in my case. I have server-side implementation so I think the issue is with my code. The problem comes only when I see loader with pointer and screen gets stuck for a while, and I do upload immediately.\nThank you.. ",
    "Nick3523": "Thanks for your answere. \nUnfortunately this doesn't work, but I managed a way to make it work  : \nI simply create an array called $forbidden that contains all folders in finally I do an array_dif between $forbidden and $allowed to keep the true forbbiden folders. \nHere is the code if it may help someone \n```\n function filtrage($allowedFolders) { \n$allfolders = array(\".tmb\",\".quarantine\");  //These are always forbbiden\nforeach(glob('C:/src/datas/*', GLOB_ONLYDIR) as $dir) {\n    array_push($allfolders,basename($dir));\n}\n\n$forbidden = array_diff($allfolders, $allowedFolders ); \nreturn $forbidden;\n\n}\n```\n```\nfunction access($attr, $path, $data, $volume, $isDir, $relpath) {\n   $allowed = array(\"ecran_dynamique\",\"requeteur\",\"@azaz\"); //To get with SQL Query later\n   $forbidden = filtrage($allowed);\n\n$basename = basename($path);\nreturn (in_array($basename, $forbidden)        \n         && strlen($relpath) !== 1)           \n    ? !($attr == 'read' || $attr == 'write') :  null;\n\n}\n```. \n@nao-pon Okay ! Thanks a lot for your help and advices, espcially about the cache, as I will use it with sql queries, it is a great idea to use cache for that :+1: . Thank you for your quick and complete answere @nao-pon-sama ! \nWorks like a charm =D \n. @nao-pon  Thank you for your answere, Not really, because a folder is seen in database as a component, and the name I want to submit, is the name of the provider of this component.\nSo I want to show a popup that asks for the name of the provider, and then store it in the database, is that possible ? If I wanted to create this feature, which files should I see/edit ? \nMany thanks for your help :). Maybe to be more clear, What I want to do is execute a PHP Script after every creation of subfolder (Level 1). \nBut the matter is to execute this script, I have to redirect to this one, What I tried is editing mkdir function and adding : \nheader(\"location: http://www.myscript.com/\"); \nCannot not work, because the header can't open a new page but redirects the actual page, so the function mkdir will not return. \nThe other alternative I tired was by JavaScript, Insering this JS code in the PHP function mkdir :  \n<script type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"Javascript\">window.open('http://www.myscript.com/');</script>\nBut the error \"Data is not in JSON format\" occurs again.\nSo the question would be, how to execute my PHP script right after creation of my subfolder ?\nThanks again =) . @nao-pon  I also thought about bind option, but I don't think that it will work. \nMy PHP script has to interract with client, with an input form, so I have to redirect/popup to the PHP page, and trying to redirect to my script using : \n'bind' => [\n    'mkdir' => [\n        function($cmd, &$result, $args, $elfinder, $volume) {\n            if ($result && !empty($result['added'])) {\n                $newDir = $result['added'][0];\n                $newDirPath = $volume->path($newDir['hash']);\n                header(\"location: http://www.myscript.com/params\");\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n]\nGives me the error : \"Impossible to log to backend. HTTP error 0\". \nI also have the error \"Datas is not in JSON format\" trying to redirect with JavaScript, using \necho \"<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\"language=\\\"Javascript\\\">window.open('http://www.example.com');</script>\";. Maybe another way; Is it possible to create an new error box, but instead of showing the usual message with close button, replace it with a button that opens a new tab, and in this tab I can launch my PHP script, a way like this : \n\nReplace it with : \n\nThe button will not close the box, but open a new tab/popup, And then, in mkdir function : \nreturn $this->setError(elFinder::MY_NEW_ERROR);\nDo you think this is possible ? . After a long thinking, I changed the way I have defined my project, so I will not touch to this function and I will do it in another PHP Page, it is better and easier I think .\nThank you for always answering and helping @nao-pon :smile: .

Could we not have a FULL example using google drive? (with redacted api keys of course)\nI appreciate it is super easy for you and you expect us to know as well, but sometimes knowing which file and exactly in which place, coupled with all the usual issues of programming syntax, make it very hard.\nIdeally there would be a wizard installer ;-)\nMeantime 2 complete files using a google drive would take all the pain away. Please!\nIf there is an FAQ or HowTo somewhere, I am sorry I have missed it.\nThere are so many OUTDATED THREADS going back years, it's hard to know what is current and what isn't and sometimes they even conflict and have false info in them\nCould we just have the two FULL sample files using google drive ?\nOf course I am \"assuming\" only main.js and connector.php need setting to make gdrive work?\nThen non programmers can see where to put their own API details and just be running - which I'm sure is what you really want ;-)\nMany thanks..

I should mention that the 2 $.widget.bridge lines are supposed to resolve the conflict between UI and BS by changing the function names of the UI functions for button and tooltip, but the elFinder fix does not work whether or not those lines are commented out.. Thanks Nao-pon, I'm looking at the noConflict function, but I am not sure how the information you provided helps me and I think the issue should be reopened. I understand that elFinder and Summernote worked together with BS 3.x, but are they to work together with BS 4? I got the impression hat the most wide use of elFinder with an editor was with Summernote, but maybe that is incorrect.\nLooking at that function, the fix in a17467e adds tooltip to the check but it did not seem to solve the issue. Any advise on how to proceed? I am not sure this is a matter of Summernote being adapted to elFinder as elFinder is being used as a plugin to Summernote.. Thanks. That seems to be making progress and makes sense. I get the popup now. On the popup, I immediately get an error that the backend is not found, but that is probably on my end configuring elFinder. I'll look at it more tomorrow.. Ok, so I think I have it working now. Your button fix doesn't work with multiple editors. It always adds content to the first editor because it is going back to the top of the dom and targets the first same class element it encounters.\nI came up with this.\nclick: function () {\n    elfinderDialog($(this).closest('.note-editor').prev('[data-editor=\"summernote\"]'));\n     }\n});\nYou have to add a data attribute to the DIV's or TEXTAREA's being turned into summernote editors. Summernote hides the converted element and inserts the editor just below. This turns out to be the element just before the closest '.note-editor'. With this method, the content will be added to the correct editor.. Hmmmm... That looks like the solution, but implementing this as the plugin to summernote, I am having some difficulty determining how to define the options since there is no $('#elfinder').elfinder(options); statement readily visible. I have the plugin file summernote-ext-elfinder.js but that is pretty much all summernote code and the elfinderDialog(context) function, but no instantiation statement like $('#elfinder').elfinder(options); \nDo you have any hint as to where the definition should go?. Nevermind, I got it. Duh... That worked great.\nfunction elfinderDialog(context){\n        var fm = $('<div/>').dialogelfinder({\n            url : '/test/elFinder/php/connector.jlad.php',\n            lang : 'en',\n            width : 840,\n            height: 450,\n            destroyOnClose : true,\n        useBrowserHistory: false,\n            getFileCallback : function(file, fm) {...\n.

    "daebak74": "@nao-pon thanks for your fast reply I saw that the id is in the list but is not so much helpfull for my case or I should to save in db all the ID and I would to get on fly. Maybe I didn't explain well my problem. In web app I have a db with contacts and for each contact I create in google drive a folder. the folder name of coarse has the unique id of the relative contact. \nSo for example\nDB -> CONTACT 1 -> ID 1 -> FORLDER CONTACT_1\nDB -> CONTACT 2 -> ID 2 -> FORLDER CONTACT_2\nON document load I can get the id and show the relative folder of that contact.\nI belived that was possible to use the hash for get the path but that work only for the file saved on local server and not for file/folder in cloud. so there is a way to get the path without need to save into db ?\nThanks again for your support..  @nao-pon  :( I tried everything to hash but I don't get the result. Maybe I am fused :) Can you tell me what I have to pass in encoding for get the right path. I f I wanna load on Init I need to use the ID saved in DB so the folder \"customer_1\" is \"customer_\" + ID\n<?php\n    $volumeId = 'gd4_';\n        $path = '????'; // without root path\n    $hash = $volumeId . rtrim(strtr(base64_encode($path), '+/=', '-_.'), '.');\n    echo $hash; \n?>\n\nThanks!!!\n. @nao-pon  Ok what i was thinking. If I need to save the Google ID I save directly the elfinder url. Or there is a way to get the elfinder path in callback function and select after init ?\nP.S. By the way would be great to get the Google drive ID from elfinder API :)\nThanks!. @nao-pon both solution need to store the hashed path in DB because in GD we can't get the hash by folder name. \nIn local server or in php or in js we just need to know the folder name for get the path \n$hash = 'L1_' . rtrim(strtr(base64_encode('folder'), '+/=', '-_.'), '.');\nIn GD we need to know the GD id for each folder created so need to store in DB\nOne solution for get onFly the hashed path would be to add a class or data attribute on elfinder rendered tree with the name of folder that in JSON response is cwd->name.\nget the path is fast $('#nav-gd4_Lw .elfinder-navbar-subtree').find('.folder').attr('id');\nFor don't save the path hashed path or GD ID in DB I'll try this direction but I think that could to added in code and be helpfull for others too.\nThanks. @nao-pon re-open this post because I don't understand if is a bug or not.\nAt the end for google drive I decide to save the path hashed in db and with a callback function get from startPathHash. work good.\nBut if I use elfinder.exec('open', 'HASH PATH'); work only for that folders already loaded. And not only for GDRIVE but for the folder on the server too.\nEXAMPLE\nFOLDER LIST\n- SYSTEM (HASH PATH: l1_Lw) -> FOLDER\n-- TEST (HASH PATH: l1_dGVzdA) -> SUB FOLDER\n- MODEL (HASH PATH: l2_Lw) -> FOLDER\nvar elfInstance = $('#elfinder').elfinder(options).elfinder('instance');\nvar btn = $('div').on('click', function() {\n    elfInstance..exec('open', 'l1_dGVzdA');\n});\nIf subfolder Test is already opened manually even if one time on click show the subfolder but as first NO.\nif I use \nvar hash = 'gd3_Lw';\nelFinderInstance.request({\n    data   : {cmd  : 'open', target : hash},\n    notify : {type : 'open', cnt : 1, hideCnt : true},\n    syncOnFail : true,\n    lazy : false\n});\nYes work!

'css/elfinder/elfinder.css'],\nbut css is not loaded.\nWe have checked sources and seemed we found a reason\nIn elfinder.js file when you check this.options.cssAutoLoad property \nthere is the following string (#975):\nif (self.cssloaded === null) { ..\n}\nThis condition is always false because cssloaded property is not null, it is just false\nCan you check this issue?\nOur  ElFinder version is 2.1.43.\nThanks!.

You are right,  if you change line 18 in elfinder.html, the result is no problem.\nBut if you try to make a similar change in elfinder.legacy.html, it doesn't load test.css. Ok, it's clear now.\nBut we still cannot solve our problem.\nCan you give an advice?\nOur applicatioin is written in Yii2 and we use this package https://github.com/alexantr/yii2-elfinder \nto integrate ElFinder in our application.  As you can see in it's code, this package initialize ElFinder similary to way described in elfinder.legacy.htm. We haven't access to package layout, so we cannot load custom css file in html ourself, all what we can - pass to ElFinder any parameters described in ElFinder docs. But  passing of cssAutoLoad property don't work here,\nPlease help.. It works. Thanks!. ",

Thank you\nMuch easier. This happens in Firefox and you can move the selected file or the \"connector.minimal.php\" that appears sometimes but always with size 0 bytes.\nIn Chrome, drag & drop with caps key between directories has no effect.\n. Holding down the Alt key, Ctrl key, Caps key (uppercase key), they are normal gestures that are used for operations with files (copy, move, ... etc).\nI have done some tests with the following results:\n\n\nWhen you drag a file from outside of elfinder (i.e. from the client's file explorer to an elfinder directory)\n-> the behavior is normal in all browsers (upload the file)\n\n\nWhen you drag a file from within elfinder (i.e. from one directory of elfinder to another)\n\ndrag + alt key\nFirefox : causes the \"upload\" of a defective file to the destination directory (*)\nChrome : idem (*)\nSafari : idem (*)\ndrag + uppercase key\nFirefox : causes the \"upload\" of a defective file to the destination directory (*)\nChrome : the drag does not occur, has no effect\nSafari : the drag does not occur, has no effect\ndrag + Ctrl key\nFirefox copy the file correctly\nChrome copy the file correctly\nSafari copy the file correctly\n\n\n\nDevelopment and test environment :\n\nServer    \nDebian 9 + Apache 2.4 + MySQL 5.7 + PHP 5.6 (all updated)\nI have created a new virtual host and I have put a clean, untouched copy of elfinder Versi\u00f3n: 2.1.48 (2.1-src Nightly: 802a690)\nI have changed in the file \"connector.minimal.php\" :\n'uploadDeny'  => array('all'),   ---------->   'uploadDeny' => array(''),\n'uploadAllow' => array('image/x-ms-bmp', ...etc),   ---------->   'uploadAllow' => array('all'),\n\n\nClients\nWindows 7 Professional + Firefox Quantum 65.0.2 + Google Chrome Versi\u00f3n 72.0.3626.121 (Build oficial)\nMac OSX El Capitan + Safari 11.1\nmacOS Mojave + Safari 12.0.3\n\n\n\n(*)\nAs an example, I have passed (\"upload\") a video file called \"video_01.mp4\" from one directory to another and the result has been a defective \"video_01.mp4\" which, in reality, is an html file with the content that I attached (is renamed as \"video_01.txt\").\n(the \"casa.net\" in the file, is the test domain)\nvideo_01.txt\n. The server has the correct URL because when copying or moving files from one directory to another, it works perfectly.\nCopying (uploading) from the client also works well.\nThe malfunction comes when you press \"Shift\" or \"Alt\" when you start dragging between elfinder directories.\nI have modified the Javascript file and I wanted to ask for your opinion.\nWhen you start to drag, 2 events occur in the file \"elfinder.full.js\":\n```\nline 16388: \n.on ('dragstart', function (e) {\n     var dt = e.dataTransfer || e.originalEvent.dataTransfer || null;\n     .... etc\n\nline 17223: \n.dragstart (function (e) {\n    var target = $ (e.data.target),\n        oe = e.data.originalEvent;\n    .... etc\n```\nBut when you press \"Alt\" or \"Shift\" when you start to drag, only that of line 16388 occurs.\nFor this, I modified the source for the case of pressing any key of these when starting the drag as follows:\n```\nline 16388: \n.on ('dragstart', function (e) {\n    // added ini\n    if (e.originalEvent.shiftKey || e.originalEvent.altKey) {\n       e.preventDefault ();\n       e.stopPropagation ();\n       e.originalEvent.preventDefault ();\n       e.originalEvent.stopPropagation ();\n       return;\n    }\n   // added end\n... rest of original code\n```\nIn this way, it seems that everything works correctly and no error occurs.\nDo you think this modification is correct?\nIt is necessary to treat the two events (\"e\" and \"e.originalEvent\") or would it be enough with just one?\nCan this affect the functioning of \"elfinder\"? (in my tests, it goes well).\nThanks for your opinion.\n. ",

Is there a button I am missing?\nOr do You mean, that I have to get the size for every single folder? Even in my my root of /share, there are dozens of folders. This is no way, someone wanna go.\nmacOS has this feature in Finder for years by now. Just CMD+J and one checkbox.(calculate all folder size)...voilla!\nThen You see at one glance exactly what folder is what size, and You are able to sort size column with one Klick.\nOf course You can switch it on and off there to.\nBtw. FreeCommander, And TotalCommander has this feature, and even MidnightCommander (shell mc) can do, if you mark the 1st line (dots) and press spacebar.\nIt would be sooo cool, if I could do that with elFinder instead of opening a terminal via ssh.\nAnd if I do it via Network (Windows or Mac) then copy 1 TB takes a long time, because it all runs over the network.\nAllmost everyone is complaining about FIle Station. With this feature elFinder would be the King of file managers on qnap.\nThere are solutions for this out there:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPUet6Ulfb8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPUet6Ulfb8\nAny hint how to include something like this via Plugin / Extension?\nThe I would do this part and offer the solution to the comunity\nBest regards\nKlaus\n\nAm 07.03.2019 um 16:22 schrieb Naoki Sawada notifications@github.com:\n@KlausHB https://github.com/KlausHB The calculation of the total size of the files contained in the folder is burdensome on the server, so it is calculated only when the user needs it.\nThanks!\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/2864#issuecomment-470568229, or mute the thread https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AKPtMQDQn2WYy6ugRvGvlQyq6LIqosjjks5vUS69gaJpZM4bW7qJ.\n\n\n.
