(I assume this because you're using the INSTALL.txt and cmake)\n\nThe cmake process seems to completely screw the directory structure\n\nYou can avoid that creating a \"build\" directory and running CMake from that directory. In this way the original structure of directories are kept intact and all output files (.obj, .lib, .exe, .pdb) go to \"build\" dir. The first step in INSTALL.txt says something about this: https://github.com/dacap/aseprite/blob/master/INSTALL.txt Anyway there were some problems compiling the project with a Visual Studio solution, so with the new changes in the Git repository you should be able to build the project (VS2010 and cmake 2.8.3). https://github.com/dacap/aseprite/commit/bc2200745544f460d169fa3cc2e4e3c8643b4a0f https://github.com/dacap/aseprite/commits/ (commits of 2010-12-11)\nTell me if you can compile it.

Anyway I think it is not accurately enough when the RGB image contain less than 256 colors.\nI was working for the next release in a replacement of the current RGB palette quantization with the one which comes in jpeglib (which is thread-safe, the current one is not thread-safe and is giving problems to generate image previews in the File Open dialog).\nYour idea to accurately quantize palettes when \"numofcolours < 256\" is very good.

From erdav...@gmail.com on April 03, 2011 10:13:18\nI always work with indexed color, and I never want it to automatically convert to RGBA. What would that mean if I had multiple indexes set to the same color? Aseprite would not be able to tell the difference between these indexes, if I understand correctly.\nOther programs such as Grafx2 are able to read and save which color index number is transparent. Will aseprite be able to read this as well?\n. From davidcapello on April 03, 2011 11:00:02\nYes, the GIF format use indexed color so any user would like to edit GIF files in that way. With the RGBA conversion you loss some information, so the automatic RGBA conversion is a bad thing to do (right now, the development version of ASEPRITE 0.9dev is working in this way).\nI don't know exactly but I think Grafx2 cannot handle GIF animations, and that is where GIF loading process is a problem. With GIF files, each frame can have a different \"transparent index\", that is \"the color that must not be merged with the previous frame\", so it isn't a global transparent index. For example, in the 1st frame the transparent index could be 0, but then in 2nd frame the transparent index could be 1 (and the 0 color could be used to paint black or the color in the first palette entry whatever it is). The final composed animation can use the 256 colors in the screen (something impossible to be done with a global transparent index).\nI think Grafx2 is simulating a global transparent index, it's useful to read/write GIF files created with Grafx2, but you cannot load any kind of GIF file that you can found on Internet. The general idea is to be able to read any animation as you see in the browsers (which is how ASEPRITE 0.9dev is working right now converting GIF files to RGBA).\nThe general idea of this issue is to add some special behaviour in the loading process of GIF files. In the final version of ASEPRITE 0.9, you should be able to load GIF files as indexed images only when: 1) no transparent index is used, 2) a GIF with one frame is loaded, 3) a constant transparent index is used in all frames. In any other cases (e.g. two or mores frames have different transparent index), a warning message with some options should be shown (E.g. Would you like to convert this GIF animation to RGBA?)\nAlso you will be able to change the global transparent index to something different to 0 index.\nAny idea is accepted because I've not started with this issue yet. Thanks for the comments!\nOwner: davidcapello\nLabels: -Priority-Medium Priority-High\n. From erdav...@gmail.com on April 03, 2011 12:46:15\nAh thanks for clearing that up. I never use more than one transparent color for sprites, so I will probably never see that warning message. But if the .gif format can store different transparent indexes per frame, why not support that in aseprite instead of converting to RGBA?\n. From davidcapello on April 03, 2011 14:14:58\nWell, supporting different transparent indexes per frame is just one part of the problem. With GIF files you can (should be able to) select different types of compositions between frames. For example, each frame can be configured to a) replace the previous frames completely, b) merge with the previous frame, c) replace a portion of the previous frame, etc.\nThe (b) case is where the transparent index variations make sense. But anyway ASEPRITE is not prepared to work in that way. GIF files is like a composition between frames (instead of layers). ASEPRITE composites layers, but each frame is unique (the frame is rendered with the content of all layers in the current frame). In GIF files a frame could depend on the content of the previous one and so on. E.g. The last frame could show you parts of the first frame.\nSupporting both compositions (layers+frames) can be a mess (right now onion skinning is a problem with multiple-layers). I think that the GIF trick to composite frames should be automatically done in the saving process only to reduce the final file's size, and not something delegated to the user.\nPS: Something similar is the way as FLI/FLC files work, each frames is a chunk of image-differences that is be merged with the previous frame.\n.

Also, if you release Alt and press it again, the whole popups menus disappears. On Linux (at least GNOME) it does not work in that way.\nI'll implement it in the Windows fashion to offer more versatility.\nSummary: Alt+underlined letter in sub-menus doesn't work\n.

From gonz...@redknightgames.com on June 23, 2014 20:26:44\nOn the subject of Eyedropper and Palette, I would like to propose a few additional quality of life changes.\n1. When sampling a colour from the artwork, if that colour currently exists as a swatch in the palette, then that swatch should be selected. Currently there is a complete disconnect for the same colour when picking from the palette vs sampling from the image, even if you sample the colour you just put down.\n2. The ability to drag and drop swatches around within the palette when rearranging or organising. Currently the only way to do this is by copy and pasting colour values in the editor which can be quite time consuming as palettes are edited or expand (perhaps a previous layout no longer works well and needs to be updated quickly) keeping a tidy palette has the added benefit of increasing productivity because the colours you need will be where you intend them to be so you don't have to go looking for them.\n3. The ability to set a custom default palette with the launch of the program and the opening of any artwork (for projects with strict tone or colour choices or even artists that work in familiar palettes). It just cuts out the middle man of having to select the desired palette from the drop down each time.\n. From davidcapello on June 24, 2014 19:52:36\nAbout this specific point:\n\n\nThe ability to set a custom default palette with the launch of the program\n\n\nYou already can do this: without any document opened (e.g. when you just launch the program), you can click the drop-down menu at the right of \"edit palette\", select a palette and then click \"Set as Default\"\n. From gonz...@redknightgames.com on June 24, 2014 20:20:56\nAh awesome, thanks for that heads up, I had never noticed it before as I usually launch the program by opening the artworks themselves (which causes the palette to be quantized) but that will definitely help when creating any new artworks.\nAlso thanks for getting back to me so quickly, makes me glad to see that my feedback isn't falling into an endless void, never to be read by anyone of note haha.\n.

For example:\n./aseprite.exe --batch --sheet out.png --data out.json test.ase\nThis load test.ase file, and generates a couple of files. The sheet, out.png, contains all frames in a row (like a sprite sheet), and metadata, out.json, has all the animation info (look the attached file in this comment).\nAlso you can use something like this:\n./aseprite.exe --batch --sheet atlas.png --data atlas.json images/.png images/.ase\nThat will create a texture atlas with all your images and animation frames.

From davidcapello on July 24, 2011 08:42:43\nHi Nick. With pixel scaling 1x, you should be able to see your sprite with real screen pixels (see the attached scale1x.png, and compare it with scale2x.png). The problem is that GUI elements are double sized anyway. If you have a tiny resolution, the GUI elements will be 1x too. So internally there are two factors: Screen pixel factor (the one you can select), and the GUI elements scaling (calculated by a special logic). The logic to select the GUI scaling is in the following line: https://github.com/dacap/aseprite/blob/d7491d25ada4acf929b223acb2217099a114818b/src/modules/gui.cpp#L588 I'll fix it for the next version to avoid this confusion (so 1x is 1x for everything).\nStatus: Accepted\nOwner: davidcapello\nLabels: Milestone-0.9  \nAttachment: scale1x.png scale2x.png\n. From nick.wig...@gmail.com on July 24, 2011 09:30:24\nHi David. Thank you -- I had trouble with the scaling because visually it is hard for me to focus on the pixels I'm working on, when the GUI is at a low res, too. In general  it seems a great tool and I'm just starting with it this afternoon. Unlike Cosmigo, it has a sensible interface and less unneeded \"stuff\" hanging around.\nI could look into the source, but building the app might be a bit harder for me. (Only recently jumped back into C++ after a 10 year hiatus), and I've never been strong on the linuxy build processes. Either way, if you're able to include this in the next release, then you have my (additional) thanks in advance.\n.

There are really old ASE versions (I don't remember the exact number) that supported Lua scripting, but then I removed it because it's a lot of work to keep scripts working when big refactor tasks are going on (also Lua syntax sucks).\nI'm thinking in Python because there are a lot of code and libraries out there. I'll be investigating the possibility to create several kind of plugins.\nAnyway, about your specific problem, I think that you need a Makefile with a rule to build your .c files from the .png files.

From maniacal...@gmail.com on June 23, 2012 18:24:33\nAn Idea to add upone this conept: Perhaps have it so that there is a menu option after copying something to paste to a range of frames from a list. \nTo illustrate, say there are twenty layers in an animation, and you wish to put a selected part of the image into the same place on all frames between frame number 6 and frame number twelve.\n. From st...@sprixelsoft.com on April 21, 2013 17:48:58\nSame behaviour needed over here. Drawing/Pasting/Nudging a layer across multiple frames is very important. Animating is much slower than necessary without this.\nie: I've animated a walk, and I have a head that moves along with the body. I've decided I want the head to be sunken down into the shoulders a little. The only way to do this is to go frame by frame and nudge the head down one frame. It would be much nicer to be able to select all the layer itself, and nudge it down one pixel across all frames.\n.

From DocHoncho@gmail.com on November 29, 2013 22:59:48\nI've got a working Grid Color/opacity setting in the \"Grid Settings\" dialog, but actually implementing grid opacity is a whole other ball of wax.\nCurrently, the grid drawing code uses a function in app/color_utils.h which relies on some allegro specific code.  In the get_color_for_allegro() function an alpha(opacity) value of 255 is hard coded.\nI've gotten the color and opacity settings added, and even a beginning to pass an opacity to the function that draws the grid.  However, due to allegro being... allegro, it's not as simple as passing an RGBA color and letting nature take its course.\nI'd forgotten how weird allegro was, and have no clue how to coax alpha transparency out of it.  Tried throwing set_alpha_blender() in there, but I've got a bad feeling that the primitive drawing functions simply ignore all that anyway.\nChanges are at https://github.com/DocHoncho/aseprite/commit/7ca4387586c25c201c2221a284ecf671569fd4ee No pull request for this at this time.

The file gui.xml should be located in C:\\AES\\data\\gui.xml, so your program is not decompressing it right (use some program that keeps the original directories structure, e.g. normal behavior of WinZip, WinRar, or 7zip).\nPS: About \"You can assume I'm not mentally handicapped\", I always assume nothing.\n. From FPS.M...@gmail.com on January 02, 2012 09:54:38\nI extracted it with Peazip (trying out a new piece of software). Trying it with 7zip, and it looks like the entire folder structure was lost by Peazip. I've never seen something so stupid. It runs fine when 7z correctly extracts the folder structure.

From eugene.f...@gmail.com on January 27, 2013 18:30:54\nI've noticed a potentially related problem - apparently, if you're working in less than fullscreen mode and your cursor strays out of the window, it resets the cursor's location relative to ASEPRITE's window.  This can be problematic on a wider screen, as it causes the cursor to jump clear out of the canvas; I've found it can be fixed by clicking out of the window and back in, but it's a minor irritation all the same.\n. From shedosurashu on February 25, 2013 10:26:03\nAny chance of this being fixed anytime soon? It's really bothering me. :)\n. From bowes.ju...@gmail.com on May 27, 2013 07:45:29\nI frequenly experience the pointer disappearing when using aseprite at any window size on multiple displays and switching between programs. I can usually get it back by clicking randomly, then using Undo to repair any damage I did to my drawing.\nSo, a pretty serious issue from my point of view.\n.

From omnigrap...@googlemail.com on May 06, 2012 15:40:23\nYou can try to start ASEPRITE in a separate Xserver like this:\n1. open tty1 with [ctrl]+[alt]+[F1]\n2. run \n$> xinit aseprite -- :1\n(assuming aseprite is in your PATH, else supply the full path)\n3. aseprite should now run on xserver:1 and in fullscreen (maybe supply screen resolution manually)\n4. use [ctrl]+[alt]+[F7] to switch back to your normal window manager and [ctrl]+[alt]+[F8] to switch back to aseprite.\nThis might reduce the lag a little, without needing to switch to xcfe or 2dgnome every time you want to pixel around.\n. From rauter.g...@gmail.com on May 08, 2012 11:46:20\nseems to work great so far, thx for this nice workaround\n. From mrkra...@gmail.com on June 05, 2012 15:27:18\nThe issue for the high cpu usage of the Xserver when running ASEPRITE 0.9.* seems to be the screen scaler used to artifically reduce the resolution of the programm to address the small scale of sprites.\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 even with Xfce the Xserver goes mad when using the default setting \"ScreenScale = 2\". Changing the value to \"1\" makes the programm run without any significant cpu usage by Xserver - and consequently more fluid.\n. From davidcapello on July 16, 2014 20:29:41\nLabels: OS-Linux\n.

From pixelpi...@gmail.com on May 03, 2012 01:21:46\nHey, thanks for retrieving the pixel artwork on the file. Several things I've noticed:\n- the layer \"A\" had the original sketch image, now it's just a translucent grey area\n- the palette was grayscale, now it's just a bunch of black swatches, with just a white and a grey one.\n  Not noticing this to complaint, just wondering if this helps.\nSorry, don't have a previous version of the file... The only additional info I can give you it's the fact that I was using the latest stable version of the software, in Windows 7 64 bit.\n. From davidcapello on May 03, 2012 04:37:02\nOK, thanks Antonio for the information. I'm sorry if you've lost some sprite. I'll try to create several test cases for the image loading/saving procedure.

Or even 32x32 and 16x16 tiles trying to cohabitate in the same map file?\nCould it be possible to set a grid base size and then designate how large each piece should be as it is added to the atlas? For example setting the base to 16x16 so a 32x16 tile would be 2 base units across and 1 base unit high?\nI've tried using PyxelEdit for tile building and found this particular limitation quite frustrating as it prevented me from mixing in stepped tile sizes and forced me to think of everything in a very fixed and blocked way.\n.

From kirby...@gmail.com on July 18, 2012 17:06:53\nAt this point, I actually think something my computer is doing is interfering, rather than it being the logic of the ASEPRITE itself. I've got it to happen just by dragging a selection of all the same color with the mouse. No tablet, no changing the default transparent action for the Marquee tool, no panning.\nI even studied the video frames afterward, used the exact same image, placed my cursor at the exact same position, made a box the exact same size, and tried to drag it to the exact same places and I couldn't replicate. It's probably not worth looking into this unless it affects anyone else. \nIn any case, here's the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXzLhmwZ18Q\n.

Currently you can resize the canvas from borders using \"Sprite > Canvas Size\". A shortcut to select it quickly is \"Alt+S\", to open the \"Sprite\" menu, and then press C key to open \"Canvas Size\" dialog (Alt+S then C). After this you are able to resize from borders.\nAnyway, it could be easy to implement like in mspaint. I'll be testing how it works (and at least add an option to configure this behavior, because can be kind of annoying to draw in borders).\nPS/ Thanks to recommend aseprite to your friend!, that's the spirit we need! :D\nStatus: Accepted\nOwner: davidcapello\n.

In the tool options at the top of the window you can now select the option \"Put Alpha\" and it will draw using your selected color at exactly the alpha level you have selected completely replacing any pixel data on the canvas. Another thing I noticed is that using the color picker it will select the correct base color regardless of the opacity of the chosen pixel. However, there is still not a method (that I've seen) to select the correct opacity level.\n.

If you try the same steps but with an RGB sprite you should obtain the color that you are looking for.\nThe problem is that indexed images are limited to use the palette colors (256 colors, those colors at the left of the screen). If you modify one palette entry (F4 key) with the HSB values that you want, then you will be able to select/draw with that specific palette entry in the sprite.\nRGB and HSB sliders in indexed images are only \"best match\", they try to find for you the closest color in the palette to your needs. But generally, if you are using indexed images, you should be using palette entries instead of RGB/HSB sliders to select the color (anyway you can use RGB/HSB sliders to edit the palette).\nStatus: WontFix\nOwner: davidcapello\n.

From eoin.mcl...@gmail.com on May 11, 2013 12:10:57\nHello gents,\nI hit this same problem and spent some time digging into it. What happens is that when the text entry box starts with a value of \"0,\" then you type in a new value, the colour sliders get updated and then do a setTextF(\"%d\", newColourValue) back on the text entry box. This causes the string to change from (e.g) \"01\" to \"1\", but the text entry box doesn't know that the string has been truncated, so the m_caret is indexing outside the string. On the next keypress, we'll attempt to insert a character past the end of the text.\nI've attached a patch. Here's how I fixed it:\nMake ui::Widget::setTextf virtual\nOverride ui::Widget::setTextf in ui::Entry and call the base implementation\nClamp ui::Entry::m_caret to the length of the string\nEoin\nAttachment: 0001-Issue-185-ASEprtie-crashes-when-editing-the-palette.patch 0002-Issue-185-ASEprtie-crashes-when-editing-the-palette.patch\n.

From eoin.mcl...@gmail.com on May 12, 2013 02:32:25\nCool, that does fix it.\nWhile we're at it, the behaviour of deleting text in the colour value entries feels a little odd. If you backspace, deleting all the text, the empty text box will be replaced with \"0\" but our cursor will be pointing at the start. So things like this sequence feels clunky:\nSet colour value to \"1\"\nPut cursor at end of string\nBackspace (i.e. delete the 1) character\nPress '1' again.\nNow, the value is \"10\", rather than \"1\", which I would have expected. To get the value of \"1\", I need to forward-delete that zero after I've typed some other value.\nMaybe we could also do something like in the attached patch? Though, I haven't vetted all the other code for places set the text in the ui::Entry...\nEoin\nAttachment: 0001-Increment-cursor-if-colour-sliders-have-added-a-char.patch\n.

From davidcapello on February 12, 2013 09:19:34\nWell, it would be great if only one C++ class is needed, but there are several things that must be done for a symmetry painting mode:\n1) This drawing mode modifies the geometry, not colors (as blur/transparency/inks). So this is a new concept. A drawing tool should support special modes with customized \"regions of modified pixels\". E.g. tiled drawing mode is integrated to inks (PointShape::doInkHline) in master branch (as a rectangle) and now is integrated to ToolLoopManager::calculateDirtyArea() in my local dev branch (as a real gfx::Region, not yet pushed to upstream). Anyway this will not be enough for a symmetry painting mode, we should think a little more about the design/interfaces of this kind stuff (the communication between Editor <-> ToolLoopManager <-> ToolLoop).\n2) UI settings for the tool: the drawing mode on/off checkbox and a way to specify the axis/locations of the symmetry (which I whink will be a special EditorState, like SelectBoxState).\n3) The logic to create the symmetry of the shape (which I think is the \"simple part\") and the modified region to refresh all editors in real-time.\nI don't know why you say \"it's quite easy to implement\". If you have some idea to do it in a simple way (as a fully functional feature completely integrated to current aseprite UI/design) I would love to hear about it.\nOwner: davidcapello\n. From arekusan...@gmail.com on February 12, 2013 12:00:36\nWhen I said one class I meant just one class for calculating symmetry points which could easily be incorporated with a pencil tool. I guess I made a mistake since you would need to add UI configuration for symmetry too which would result in more stuff being added since you have 2 types for symmetry painting: circular and mirror mode :)\nWhen it comes to actual drawing on canvas, only thing you would need to modify modify is pixel placement. Let's say you have one pixel position on the screen with X1 and Y1 coordinates. You input those coordinates into symmetry class and it returns an array of X and Y coordinates for mirror/circular reflection points. The only thing which is tricky is when drawing with wider brush (but if you just use pencil method which draws on X, Y for each coordinate I don't think it should be a problem).\nTechnically speaking you can do even more by implementing drawing mirrored ellipses just by sending X and Y coordinates of each part of Ellipse Rect into symmetry class.\nI don't know if you are skilled in Free Pascal Language since I already made a class like that so you can see what I'm talking about :) https://code.google.com/p/pixeller/source/browse/trunk/PixellerLazarus/symmetry.pas There is also a C# version of the class (if that would be more understandable): https://code.google.com/p/pixeller/source/browse/trunk/Pixeller/Pixeller/Tools/Symmetry.cs I made a C++ class file with an example but haven't tested it with real pixel drawing so I'm not sure if it works completely like the pascal version. I guess it could be optimized a bit too, but I'm not that good with C++.\nAttachment: SymmetryCpp.zip\n. From arekusan...@gmail.com on February 12, 2013 12:43:02\nHere is C# painting version as proof. :D\nIt only draws a pixel or a line of width 1 when mousedown + mousemove event is executed.

Rather than having to click the [+] or [-] buttons at the top of the work area.\nA \"paint selection\" option would also be extremely helpful- where it uses the current pencil size to select/deselect, so you could easily just \"draw\" minor selection additions rather than trying to lasso it.\n. From davidcapello on July 06, 2014 06:21:56\nThis issue is quite tricky. Several things:\n1) The current default behavior (as in v1.0) is the most MS Paint-like behavior, which I think is quite useful and handy (and familiar?) most of the time. So we don't have to lost this flexibility.\n2) Anyway, it looks like having scale/rotate handles visible/enabled all the time is not friendly in some situations. There is another related issue to this one ( issue #370 ) to show the rotation pivot by default, I think that we need a button/configuration in the context bar to switch the visibility of all transformation handles by default.\n3) I will try to add some keyboard modifiers to enable those \"universal\" add/remove selection modes. Something similar to Photoshop.\n4) About the \"paint selection\", it's already possible configuring it in the  section of gui.xml (anyway it's too internal stuff). There were an intermediate beta version that included a special ink mode for any tool to paint selection with any tool. I've to figure out how to make this accessible in a easy way (an \"Advanced\" button for sure).\nStatus: Accepted\nOwner: davidcapello\nLabels: Milestone-1.0\n.

From davidcapello on May 13, 2013 17:58:02\nHi @jjmiller33, I think it's because the Ubuntu desktop (I don't know if it's Unity, or GNOME, I'm not quite sure) uses Alt key to move/resize windows (Alt+left click). You can replace the \"Alt\" modifier in the gui.xml file:\n1. copy aseprite/data/gui.xml to ~/.aseprite/gui.xml\n2. open ~/.aseprite/gui.xml (or change aseprite/data/gui.xml directly)\n3. find  element\n4. change \"Alt\" in  with something like \"Z\" or another key\n5. restart aseprite\nI should fix this for the next version on Linux.\nAbout the eraser, if you select the eraser tool (with E key), can you replace foreground color with background color using right-click? or doesn't it work?\nStatus: Accepted\nOwner: davidcapello\n. From jjmille...@gmail.com on August 20, 2013 09:27:13\nHey David sorry for not responding for so long-\nhacking the xml file works great. As a side note I changed the dropper to ctrl and the move to alt, because with a tablet moving can be done from MMB right from the pen (also move is mapped to the spacebar, which is kind of a standard). Many programs use Ctrl for the dropper, that might be a nice overall change.\nThe E doesn't seem to be working, but I'm still a noob with this program so maybe I just don't get it. Hopefully within the next few weeks I can get some more spriting in. I will check it on my macbook to see what happens there.\n.

From davidcapello on November 11, 2013 16:49:53\nActually I enjoy programming in C++ a lot more than in C# (and I program in both languages on a daily basis). So I don't know if that C# branch would help us.\nAlso I'm using my own image processing routines (you can find the raster library here https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/tree/dev/src/raster ). Aseprite uses Allegro only for keyboard/mouse input and screen output, not for internal representation of sprites/documents/images (you can find the sprite editor code to draw the active document in the screen here http://goo.gl/CJttya ).\nI've plans to use pixman in a near future ( https://github.com/aseprite/pixman ) which has blending modes, pixel formats, gradients, etc.\nAnyway you cannot solve this issue using pixman (or several other image processing libraries). To solve this issue we need a better internal representation of images, separated by tiles of 32x32 or something like that. Where a matrix of tiles conform the whole image (so you can process each tile separately). I'm making progress in this direction, but it's a long road, for example, this recent (huge) commit https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/e5ba8e0922e066e7b521b149007a74aa00a9a25b is a refactor to wrap the image access with lock/unlock semantic. So in the future the internal representation of the image doesn't need to be a continuous array of bytes, i.e., we'll be able to use tiles.\n.

Rotating the square brush 90 degrees does not produce the same shape, it has some distortion.\nThe issue, I think, is that the brushes are \"drawn\" using either a polygon (for square) or a line for the line brush.  The program applies the given rotation directly to the points and redraws.  Unfortunately, since the brushes are quite small any floating point inaccuracy introduced while performing the rotation is going to have very noticeable distortion.\nA better way would probably be to use some raster rotation algorithm.  The brush would be initially rendered as a horizontal line and the whole brush bitmap would be rotated.\nStatus: Accepted\nLabels: Milestone-1.0\n.

I suspect it's the result of a disconnect between being a Selection and MovingPixels.  For whatever reason when an image is pasted, it looks like there's a selection but it isn't really treated like one.\nStatus: Accepted\n. From davidcapello on November 30, 2013 13:49:24\nThis problem is because MovingPixelsState contains a PixelsMovement, which contains an UndoTransaction. This undo transaction lock the document in write mode in the whole transformation process of the pasted/moved image. It's quite hard to solve this. There are a \"to do\" item related with this which consist on adding undo to each transformation phase (e.g. you rotate, then scale, the move, there should be three different undo steps).\n.

From matt.e.g...@gmail.com on December 06, 2013 22:46:36\nI am able to open aseprite 0.9.5 in Mavericks (10.9 (13A603)) on my MBP retina. It does have some issues but overall is pretty usable.\nOne issue is when you first open it, there are graphical glitches and the aseprite interface is shifted up and out of the top of the window. cmnd-tabbing away from the app and back seems to fix it.\nAlso when you first open it, aseprite's mosue cursor does not map to the same position as the native cursor, making about the left 150 pixels inaccessible with the mouse. But again, cmnd-tabbing away and back seems to fix this too.\naseprite is definitely a bit buggy in Mavericks, but for the most part it's pretty usable.\n. From DocHoncho@gmail.com on November 21, 2013 22:20:31\nConfirmed on Ubuntu 12.04 (VMWare).\nIt doesn't seem to be limited to just the mouse, the entire application is extremely laggy, making it impossible to do just about anything.\nIf I had to guess I'd say it was an allegro problem.  I seem to recall Allegro requiring a yield_timeslice() function to play nicely with windowing systems.  Haven't used Allegro in years, but the function looks like it's still there in some form.\nLooking in to this some more.\nStatus: Started\nOwner: DocHoncho@gmail.com\n.

From trooper...@gmail.com on December 31, 2013 09:45:05\nI also have this problem on Arch Linux x86_64. The issue seems to me to be related with mouse acceleration. When I move the mouse slowly, the cursor is able to keep up. However, if I move the mouse at a higher speed, the on screen cursor is unable to keep up. There seems to be a certain threshold for what speed Aseprite is able to keep up with the mouse movement and when it falls behind. As was mentioned before, my guess would be that program can't keep up with the mouse events.\n. From mesz...@gmail.com on April 23, 2014 11:49:28\nI found a workaround which fixed the mouse lag for me: changing my mouse polling rate from 1000Hz to 500Hz.\nHere is a general howto: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_Polling_Rate or if you're using a Razer mouse along with razercfg like me, you can set it there.\nFor completeness: I'm using aseprite 0.9.5 (from AUR) on Arch Linux x86_64.\n.

From davidcapello on November 22, 2013 02:51:51\nI was thinking a lot about this issue (rewritting the whole color management), I'll try to write my thoughts later (it will take me some time to think about it).\n. From davidcapello on November 22, 2013 20:52:54\nSome things about this issue.\nThe color management was rewritten several times. I think that I've changed the color bar at least three times. And I haven't found that sweet spot where it does \"just the right thing\". So this is The Issue that I want to fix from the very early years of ASE/Aseprite. \nThere were an ASE version (v0.3.1) where you were capable to select RGBA colors. Then I changed it to RGB (opaque colors) and added the Opacity sliders (to be more \"user friendly\"). Finally I saw that the RGBA is \"a must\" to modify pixels in a controlled way, and the Opacity slider cannot solve all the problems. (I've found myself using color curves, F9 key, to modify Alpha values in the skin.png, such a pain).\nBasically this is a problem between \"simple UX\" vs \"versatility\" vs \"user expectation\" (and \"Photoshop users expectation\"). At the moment, my point of view is that Opacity slider is not as useful in pixel art as it is in photo retouching software, so it's much better to have and handle RGBA color entries in the palette/color bar. (Also there are PNG files with Indexed color that use different Alpha values in each palette entry, they are not correctly loaded on Aseprite.)\nIn conclusion, both things are necessary: RGBA in color selection/palette, and the opacity slider. So we must put Alpha back to color selection. Anyway it is a huge change. I can think about several places to touch/things to do:\n- First of all, app::Color doesn't have Alpha, so we have to add the Alpha channel right there (independently from app::Color::m_type, the alpha must be outside app::Color::m_value union, so it's another field).\n- In every single place where an app::Color is used (find/grep), we've to check that its Alpha isn't ignored.\n- All places where Opacity is consulted (app::IToolSettings::getOpacity()), we have to merge the Alpha of the active color with the Opacity slider (e.g. we can use INT_MULT(alpha, opacity, tmpvalue) macro defined in raster/blend.h).\n- Take care of Alpha in sprite and palette serialization (almost all palette formats do not support Alpha per color entry). So we will need some warning messages.\n- The editor's MovingPixelsState state uses a special color to know what is the \"transparent color\" of the selection, that should be reviewed (e.g. can a semi-transparent color be completelly ignored in the paste operation?). (~~This transparent color must be moved to the new ContextBar, this is a thing \"to do\", at least in my head~~ it's already done.)\n- Review the replace color command.\n- Finally -maybe not yet in this issue- we've to add support to save Indexed PNG files with Alpha.\nSurely a lot of things are missing in this short list, but I think it's a monumental task (I don't want to delay 0.9.6 with this issue, the timeline is high-priority). Maybe we can divide the task in several steps so you can do something with a smaller impact at the very beginning.\nLabels: Milestone-1.0\n. From DocHoncho@gmail.com on November 22, 2013 21:33:30\nIndeed, I started looking into some of the required changes, starting with the sliders, then into Color, and kind of getting bogged down in there.\nI've got a branch with a few changes, but not being sure whether opaque Rgb was to be kept I opted to add Rgba as a separate color type with its own m_value struct. \nI didn't really do a whole lot so I'll go ahead and set that branch aside for now.\n.

Anyway it's good to have it here in the tracker.\nTo fix this problem we need alpha support for ui::Window (compositable windows). It means: a flag that says \"this window should be painted with a special background, that special background is all the widgets overlapped by the window\", so a double-buffered technique is need in that case.\nThe main problem: we cannot do this until all widgets use onPaint() event. There are widgets that draw directly on ji_screen/Allegro screen when they receive a kPaint message, so we cannot draw those widget in the \"temporary background\" yet.\n.

The 100x100 sprite will cease to move upwards within the mini editor once it is about ~44 pixels from the bottom despite the space between the top border and the top of the sprite growing.

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you on this one.\nThe desktop crash is completely absent in \"aseprite-1.0.0-beta2\" but on the other hand, I cannot navigate down into folders in the open/save dialog. Going up through folders (via the up arrow) works just fine, as well as clicking files in the \"recent path\" dialog, but I can't double-click folders to enter them or double-click files to save them. Clicking \"OK\" to save a file works, though, as well as manually opening files by clicking on their icons outside of ASEprite.\n. From davidcapello on May 05, 2014 14:50:59\nHi! Have you try the new RC1? (aseprite-1.0.0-rc1). The double-click issues should be gone. I've sent an update via email. Good luck!\n. From davidcapello on July 10, 2014 21:00:16\nStatus: Fixed\n. From kirby...@gmail.com on March 01, 2014 14:31:22\nRelated enough to put here. A lot of times I tried to draw, and no marks were made because my opacity was 0. I wondered how it kept getting set to 0. I figured it out, it's because just moving the mouse over any number input dialog gives it focus. So if my mouse drifted over opacity and I pressed space to pan, opacity got set to 0.\n.

From DragonDe...@gmail.com on April 09, 2014 18:35:52\nInteresting that I just go your reply, as I was checking my inbox right after ASEprite quit on me again. I've downloaded the beta and WHOA that little bit of GUI makes a big difference! And there's a scroll bar! And you can change the screen scale without editing the .txt file! Great job, man, really exceeded my expectations!!! :D\nI'll go ahead and give this new ASEprite a spin for a few days and tell if you if it's a bit more stable. The crashes were happening at random so I really won't be able to tell if they're fixed unless I use the program for a bit.\n. From DragonDe...@gmail.com on April 10, 2014 13:53:23\nFirst off, I gotta say. This new ASEprite has so many amazing features! Freehand trace? Timeline editor? All stuff you wouldn't know to how use at first, but once you get the hang of it you don't know how you'd live without it! Now, onto the bugs...\nASEprite hasn't crashed at random on me after a day's usage and there's no \"Error closing ASE. (uncaught exception)\", but now it crashes when I try to save my file and click \"desktop\" from the top pulldown menu. It doesn't seem to crash when I try clicking any other location or try to reach the desktop by clicking the up arrow. And when I try to open the program after it's crashed (no matter how), many of the files in my \"Open Recent\" menu are forgotten and the palette editor is scrunched to only show a single column. I can manually drag it to show the usual 4 columns, but it still resets every time I crash. I think the 1-column palette editor bug has to do with the 1:1 screen scale.\nThe right-click cancel functionality isn't working when I use the replace tool. What I mean by this is that if I'm replacing a color and I don't like the replaced color, then I can left-click if I still have the right-click held down and it will undo the replace mid-stroke. This is a function ASEprite v0.9.5 and even MS Paint has so I assume this is a bug...\nFinally, when I make a selection and press the delete key, it removes the entire layer.\n. From davidcapello on April 17, 2014 13:11:42\nThat bug clicking the \"Desktop\" folder in the pulldown menu is high-priority. It happened to me one time, and I have another bug report related to that. If you know how to reproduce it, I would like to send you a special Aseprite version to test the bug again.\n\nI think the 1-column palette editor bug has to do with the 1:1 screen scale.\n\nYeah, it is already fixed for the next release.\n\nThe right-click cancel functionality isn't working when I use the replace tool\n\nFixed too. Thanks to report it. (Commit: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/138d2f1db8af489515dedd924588223b288b58b1 )\n\nFinally, when I make a selection and press the delete key, it removes the entire layer.\n\nI will check that.

From davidcapello on May 05, 2014 19:58:14\nDo you mean that you cannot change/use the other colors? I think that the issue here is that the new default palette used by Aseprite contains 32 colors only.\nMaybe I should consider a new default color palette with 256 colors to avoid confusion.\nStatus: Accepted\nOwner: davidcapello\nLabels: -Priority-Medium Priority-Low\n. From photos...@gmail.com on May 05, 2014 22:08:46\nYes I am able to change colors using the editor. It would be nice if 256 was an option under available palettes as there's certainly room for more.\n. From photos...@gmail.com on May 07, 2014 14:53:00\nAnother idea: I came across an earlier version (trailer on project home) that has larger color icons in the palette area - would it be possible to use the large icon mode for when the number of colors in a palette does not exceed the space required? So for 256 the colors would display as before taking up the entire palette space and at the same time a 32 color palette would also fill up the space but with larger icons?\n.

From kirby...@gmail.com on June 10, 2014 18:21:49\nHey, I make homebrew NES games so of course I gotta comment here. There isn't really such thing as a perfect RGB palette for NES for technical reasons. For what my opinion is worth, YY-CHR's palette actually isn't close either, though. \nI made this image a while ago to show the woes of trying to create NES graphics: http://i.imgur.com/X0WVoCN.png That's an identical scene from a quick rom I made in a bunch of different emulators. (Credit where credit is due. The graphics themselves are adapted from a mockup by ptoing that can be found here: http://www.pixeljoint.com/pixelart/80652.htm)I could also take a picture of this same scene on my TV on a real NES and it'd still be different... \nAnyway, if recommendations are being made I recommend this palette: http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php Here is a topic of the work that went into the palette generator to make it as accurate as possible: http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=8209 The colors it generates by default are the closest to what my actual NES displays on most TVs I've tried it on. There are eight palettes because the NES has 3 bits that control which colors (R, G, or B) are \"emphasized\" in the palette. The top is nothing emphasized as most games have it. (Which is all that should be included in the palette, or people will mix colors from differently emphasized palettes.) This is the palette I use to make graphics for my homebrew games, and even though it's the most accurate I've found, I still sometimes choose colors and then see how different they look on the actual console and every emulator... That's the road. Then, NES in PAL regions has a much brighter and saturated palette. You can't win.\nAnyway, that was quite a rant. TL;DR: Dude who makes NES homebrew recommends this one: http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php\n. From kirby...@gmail.com on June 10, 2014 18:33:09\nAnd I accidentally deleted my \"woes of trying to create NES graphics\" image. Here's a mirror: http://i.imgur.com/Gnvj4bN.png And now I'll shut up.\n. From DragonDe...@gmail.com on June 10, 2014 19:06:57\nAh, yes! I've heard of that palette generator! I've actually used it myself (default settings) and I think it's way better than most NES palettes out there. It'd be my second recommendation based on just \"looking good\", but it'd be my first recommendation as far as balancing authenticity and \"looking good\". I think that'd be a great one to choose. I think that palette, balanced on it's side like my palette setup, would be perfect for ASEprite.\n. From davidcapello on August 05, 2014 04:36:05\nHi there! Thanks for the discussion here. I have to say that I would like to include the DragonDePlatino's NES.gpl as an replacement for the current NES palette.\nI didn't know about that palette generator, but if you people think that other palette for NES should be included (e.g. the generator with default settings), I'm open to include other .gpl files too.\nStatus: Accepted\nOwner: davidcapello\nLabels: Milestone-1.0\n.

    "dacap": "Review performance (and bg worker thread/progress bar when quantizing RGB images in File > Open) for v1.1. Actually the UI is completely blocked.\n. The quantization works ok (now in the palette-with-alpha branch it works for color with alpha too).\n. Fixed\n. There are new command line options to export a texture atlas: --sheet-pack, --sheet-width, --sheet-height. Anyway we cannot choose other formats yet (and there is no GUI at the moment, just the CLI).\n. Hi @Cerno-b, I know TexturePacker, but I've never tried it. Each time I think about this, the scripting capability appears on my mind and it's good to know that you though the same (possible) solution.\nAnyway a integrated template system would be the best solution (and possibility to use the template system from scripts).\nThis is related to #126, #138, #382, #475 \n. Some tasks:\n- [ ] find a template engine for C++ (e.g. ctemplates, or see this comment)\n- [ ] depending on the templating engine, document how to create new templates\n- [ ] create two templates for current json-array and json-hash outputs\n- [ ] create a couple of new templates for cocos2d-x plists\n- [ ] change the CLI option to choose the template name\n- [ ] change the GUI option to choose the template name\n. > Problem 1: Designer must remember to uniquely tag the animations across all ase files\nHi @dagostinelli, indeed I've never thought about --list-tags and --list-layers with multiple files. They are options to be used independently for each file. E.g. when you want to list the tags of jay.ase file you should use --list-tags for jay.ase only. Then you can post-process all resulting JSON files to create your own JSON data for your game.\nFor example:\naseprite -b jay.ase   --list-tags --list-layers --data jay.json\naseprite -b robin.ase --list-tags --list-layers --data robin.json\naseprite -b smile.ase --list-tags --list-layers --data smile.json\nnode generate-data.js\nWhere generate-data.js will merge all JSON data in one output-data.json file.\n\nHow about creating a section called \"sprites\" with a list of \"Sprite\" objects?  Each Sprite object would contain a name, a list of frameTags (and layers and so on) that go with.  This would let us avoid prefixing the tags.  Perhaps the sprite name can come from the command line or the .ase file name.\n\nIt might be a good solution when multiple sprites are specified --sheet, I'll take note about this. Anyway I'm not sure if it would be good to change the current format, it might break compatibility. Maybe other --format when templates are already available. (Also there is some progress in a scripting API, which might be the latest replacement for all command line options.)\n\nProblem 2: Ineffective ID numbers to lookup frames of the animation\n\nI'd prefer the sprites section or identifying frames from the frameTag name. I don't think that a frame number should be a string.\n\nProblem 3 Locating the static sprite by name as an ugly name\n\nTo fix this I think you might use the --filename-format option. For example:\naseprite -b --filename-format \"{title}\" jay.ase robin.ase smile.ase --trim --sheet-pack --sheet atlas.png --data atlas.json\n. https://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/0/1741105805742397201/. Related to #126 \n. I think a list of fonts could be built in a background thread when the text tool is used/selected by first time (the most common case is that the user will not use the text tool). This list could be cached and when the text tool is used again in other session, the cached list is loaded while a background thread search for new fonts.\n. A partial implementation will be available for the next release. It's not an interactive tool, but we'll be able to insert text (T key as shortcut):\n\n. See #721 and #722 \n. With v1.0.3 we can change the opacity of several cels (using the status bar slider), the X/Y position (Ctrl+drag-and-drop), or delete several frames. Anyway we still cannot draw in several frames at the simultaneously.\n. As we have #99 available, this feature will not be implemented.\n. This should be tested again with the latest version which uses the new backend.. It looks like none of Alt modifiers (left and right Alt+N) are working on Linux.\n. See #796\n. > could be implemented using a drawing mode\nSure! Indeed there is already some (commented) code. Also I think there were some 1.0 beta (0.9.6) that included a Shading mode in the combobox where \"Default / Set Alpha / Lock Alpha\" ink\n\nyou could automatically go into that mode when that gradient is selected.\n\nThat's a good idea.\n\nsome sort of split area in the palette panel?\n\nExactly.\n\nHighlighting should work through the use of the left mouse button, while the right mouse would shade, moving the index within the ramp up or down accordingly.\n\n:+1:\n. Fixed\n. > Using Left/Rightclick to move the ramp up and down works well with a mouse, however it proves to be difficult when using a stylus. Having a button(hotkey e.g. x like the color left/right flip) to flip the order of the selected color ramp so you can remain using the stylus would be a great improvement.\nI was thinking that in Shading mode, X key could swap the whole gradient.\n\nI found it weird that the shading tool works only on any of the colors in the ramp. \nIt would be cool to get a check box so it also works on any color/transparency, where it starts with either end of the ramp, depending on which direction you start from (left/right).\n\nThe good thing about the current mode is that you can be safe that colors that aren't in the gradient aren't modified. One question, in this new mode, if I press left key above a color outside the gradient, do I paint with the right-most color in the gradient?\n\nThe selection of colors are always sorted in order of the color index instead of the color selection order, which makes it difficult to get the color progression you want. It would be appreciated if you could drag-drop/rearrange the colors in the selected ramp to get the progression how you like it.\n\n:+1: It's planned but didn't make the first version of the shading widget.\n\nWhen working with different custom ramps in one image it can be quite the hassle to either sort the palette so the selection is lined up (if at all possible) or to reorder/rearrange the palette every time you want to change your ramp. For that it would be good to have drop down history on the ramp you can select previously created ramps (either saved per .ase or palette file)\n\n:+1: I thought exactly same but it wasn't included in the final release. It's probably related to #787 \n. It would be great to be able to tweening cel position, rotation, scale, or create new style of \"path\" layers with polygons that can be transformed frame by frame (and autotweened)\n. We could include a tweening of tool parameters. E.g. Two points in one frame, and other two points in other frame, so we can draw a line on each frame interpolating those points. Anyway a path layer (#814) with keyframes and interpolation curves would be more powerful (and non-destructive).\n. The Ctrl key will not be implemented (at least, not at this moment).\n. The Frame > New Empty Frame (Alt+B) menu option partially fix this issue. Anyway I don't know if this option could be easily integrated without adding more UI complexity now that a new concept of continuous layers (linked cels) is being implemented:\n\n. Fixed\n. Fixed for v1.1-beta3\n. There will be an option in Edit > Preferences > Experimental > Flash layer to enable this behavior.\n. This issue should be fixed with the new INSTALL.md instructions, and the crash with these commits: daa7adde147c1024c94fbd246ef7c765064dda07 and 354d945b49fa463634fefe1dbd7d5aeb9aed22b4\n. This should be fixed from long time ago. I'll review the issue and test again.\nNote: we should add an alert if the file format doesn't support palettes with 8-bits resolution for each RGB component.\n. It's already fixed.\n. The \"Snap to Grid\" shortcut is Shift+S actually\n. A lot of people is asking for multi-language support (Japanese and Chinese mainly). So this issue should be reprioritized in some way. (Internal Note: Unicode chars should be rendered using FreeType library with an Unicode font, like Arial Unicode.)\n. Hi @NeoKune, the only problem I see at the moment (compared with other languages) is the usage of (Unicode) characters that are not in the pixel-art font. That means that we will need a bigger (TrueType) font (e.g. Arial Unicode). Doing so we will need bigger user interface (menus/buttons/etc) to fit the new font size.\n. I've started working on this issue (mainly the part to render Unicode characters so we can see file names correctly)\n. Next version will have support to create extensions with new languages. Example. I'll close this issue because most of the work is already done in v1.2. The only missing thing is discovering strings that need translation which I think it will be a progressive development (just like finding stuff that is missing in the theme customization).. I've added the StartupWMClass information in the .desktop file released in the official .deb.\n. Thanks @Mailaender \n. @sam-baker what operating system are you running? windows? macos? what specific OS version? I don't have other reports about this on 1.1.13 or beta7. @sam-baker some time ago people had issues with Wacom tablets, but they were related to the \"old backend\", some possible solutions are in the FAQ: https://www.aseprite.org/faq/#i-have-a-lag-using-my-pen-is-there-any-solution\nAnyway, are you using the regular Aseprite.exe right? or the Aseprite-old-backend.exe? The new backend (Aseprite.exe) tries to load wintab32.dll from your system, which is a dll used to get events directly from the Wacom tablet (which should avoid this delay that you're experiencing).. OS X menus will be added in v1.1.\n. @irskep actually the menu is not as important as another feature (that requires the menu):\nhttps://community.aseprite.org/t/make-hide-aseprite-cmd-h-and-alikes-available-on-macos/279\nSo implementing \u2318H and \u2318M requires the native menu, and something nice would have the entire menu available in the top bar (and options to show/hide the pixel art UI menu).. This is already done\n. > Maybe aseprite could look for a specially named file in the target directory and then run it on save/export if it exists.\nSome time ago I was thinking about the same possibility to customize save behavior/some  kind of plugin for each sprite. But I think #126 (planed for v1.2) will include a better opportunity to add code snippets to create post-save hooks for a set of sprites.\n. The new backend will be implemented using Skia library, we've started some work in 0350ac4bbed19f326d35b23fd56b04f1670fd4f8\n. We are in a kind of deadlock with Allegro 4:\n1. Allegro 4 needs OS X SDK 10.4 to be compiled correctly (because it uses QuickDraw)\n2. And we need a modern OS X SDK to provide touch events (and better integration with OS X)\nOn Windows there are still one odd crash report where a DirectDraw surface wasn't restored (probably fixed here), and on Linux we have lag problems with the mouse.\nThe solution we are working on is this:\n1. Use Skia for drawing primitives (and hardware acceleration if needed)\n2. Use direct API to handle Win32/OS X/X11 windows and events.\n. > Is this still being pursued?\nYes, I'm working on the Linux port but it's progressing slowly. The main issue with libraries like SDL2, Allegro, SFML, etc. is that they are focused on game programming, and not in application programming. And through all these years I reached to the conclusion that you need full control of mouse and keyboard messages (and all window messages in particular, e.g. to give proper support to pen/stylus).\nThe basic idea is that we should control all windows/keyboard/mouse messages from our side, and use Skia to draw on the screen (the same is done on chrome, all chrome-based apps, sublime text, etc.).\n\nI ask because I think that since adding skia the build process has gotten a lot harder\n\nYes, I think exactly the same (and I have to compile Skia several times in several platform, and each time I have to update the Skia version is A LOT of work, even the API is unstable from version to version). Anyway, I think there is no other graphics library with so much effort to be improved as in Skia (Google has a lot of performance controls, metrics, etc.).\nSo at this moment, the idea is to continue using Skia, but I have plans (in a distant future) to replace it with our own rendering functions (based on each OS APIs).. Another idea is to give support for several graphics libraries. E.g. we control all window/mouse/keys events, but we use several back-end libraries just to render graphics (e.g. SDL2, Allegro, SFML, etc.).\n\nPros: +give the chance to change the back-end on runtime +best performance on each platform +possibilities of compilation/run on more machines\nCons: -maintenance hell. > But what made it the choice over Allegro 5, SFML, and SDL2?\n\nI will quote a part of my previous message \"through all these years I reached to the conclusion that you need full control of mouse and keyboard messages (and all window messages in particular, e.g. to give proper support to pen/stylus).\"\nSo basically after seeing all the problems with Allegro 4 in these 17 years of development, I didn't want to make the same mistake again, so all the backend (she module) is programmed by us and for Aseprite specifically, and Skia is used only for graphics. This is the only way to have 100% control to fix issues with the keyboard, mouse, stylus, etc.\nMy future idea is that after removing Allegro 4 (which is used only on Linux at the moment), we'll be able to add new UI effects implemented through Skia.. Eraser already works correctly with opacity < 255.\n. Implemented in anticrash branch (it will be soon merged to master)\n. Hi @zed9h, I thought about this issue and a possible/simple approach is to show the cel preview in the Preview window, it means: when we move the mouse over the timeline, the Preview window render the sprite with that specific Cel visible only. This behavior should be configurable through a checkbox in the timeline configuration dialog and a bool in pref.xml, or we might have a combobox with different kind of previews: in Preview window, as a floating Image, or in the same Timeline with bigger boxes (this last option is complex and requires another configuration parameter to create a bigger Timeline).\n. Anyway I've to say that I've modified several things in the Timeline in my private branches (mainly to support layer groups/folder). E.g. LayerIndex will disappear because it doesn't make sense to have a fixed index for layers when the layer order depends on things like \"a layer group/folder is open/closed expanded/collapsed.\" So my advice is that you don't touch too much code in the timeline as it might change a lot in a near future.\n. Oh I've just wrote a comment here.\nOne PR for one thing will be a nice thing to do.\n. One extra thing, I'll try to add an option to zoom the timeline in the same way as in the sprite editor. In this way the timeline could be bigger and we'd be able to show thumbnails in the same timeline cels (in this way there is no need for an option to show thumbnails in timeline, they should be shown automatically when it's zoomed in).\n. I've just added a zoom factor, and Timeline dimensions are now in Timeline member functions instead of macros.\n. > mipmaps are normally used with trilinear interpolation\nDo you mean something like bicubic interpolation?\n\nThe box sampling I implemented is the fast variant\n\nOK, I take your word \ud83d\ude04 \n\nprocessing time: generate two (cel->16x16->11x11) or three (cel=>[16x16,32x32]->11x11) scales, in place of one (cel->11x11), will probably be slower, specially because of the overhead of all the intermediate images;\n\nI meant this: in case that we need to show a thumbnail in a 11x11 area, we ask for 11x11 thumbnail to the generator, but it can decide return us a \"best fit\" already generated, e.g., 16x16. This might be useful when we zoom the timeline, we can use the same 16x16 thumbnail for several timeline zoom, when it gets bigger, e.g. 24x24, we can generate the 32x32 version of thumbnails. Anyway I'm not sure about this and it will add a complexity that we can leave for a future implementation.\n\ninterface sluggishness: I could do a background thumb generation on another thread.\n\nNot exactly. To generate a thumbnail in a background thread we have to lock the document:\n1. lock the whole document\n2. copy the cel data in the background thread as fast as possible\n3. unlock the document\n4. the background thread can generate the thumbnail and discard the data\nThere is no mechanism (yet) to lock just one cel. I've plans to create a lock by ROI (region of interest), but it will take time (in a similar way how a database manager locks tables and records).\nAs a first try, we should avoid using background threads.\n\nI will give it a try with the checkered background on all surfaces it may work better than I thought.\n\nPlease give it a try because as far as I remember, Photoshop doesn't look like it needs a special background color for thumbnails (something I think that should work out-of-the-box).\n. As a first step for v1.0 this can be as simple as a \"star\" or marker. Then we can add label/colors, and finally different loop sections/export to different files.\nAlso, check #491 feature so it would be great to be able to select the current loop range (from the previous/current label to the next one).\n. Already in master branch. The UI and load/save into/from .aseprite files is already done. We need a possibility to use frame tags in export processes (#607)\n. Brushes could be created from the current selection (with a new button in the context bar, like a Grab Brush)\n. Actually there is a problem to implement this feature: When we rotate the selected cel area, we don't know what pivot point to use. Should we enter into a MovingPixelsState?\n. Actually, the Flip V/H should be working for the selection (the rotation is missing). Select a region of your sprite and press Shift+V or Shift+H or Edit > Flip. Anyway I've detected a bug, where the Flip doesn't work if the cel position/origin is not 0,0.\n. This might be related to interlaced pngs, fixed in 7750982af6159d0bcb01336da915d93c88318886\n. This feature was implemented as #188 \n. I've started working on a new library a few weeks ago to solve this: clip\n. For Linux clipboard support see #1100\n. To pick colors now we can use the \"grab alpha\" from #134 \n. @watercolorhearts remember that you can use custom brushes to simulate patterns: https://imgur.com/2ke4Xgw . Currently we can change the brush size with + and - keys.\n[ and ] can be problematic for other keyboard layouts (e.g. Spanish keyboards). Anyway we could add the shortcuts anyway and see what does Photoshop in case of international keyboard layouts.\n. Hi @brunosxs, you should be able to configure these commands from Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts, in the Commands section there is Brush: Decrement Size and Brush: Increment Size. I hope it works!\n. I'll close this issue because we can already configure keys to change the brush size. Please follow #970 in case you want to configure mouse wheel + key modifier to change the brush size.\n. This is already fixed in v1.x series\n. Aseprite v1.0.6 version will have a --save-as command line option so we will be able to convert images from the command line.\n. A couple of years ago I talked in the openraster IRC (or a related IRC, I don't remember), and it was not so \"open\" the possibility to extend the format to support Aseprite structure. Also, the OpenRaster support is in #115\n. Anyway a future .zip format could be based on OpenRaster (unofficially extended).\n. Some points here. There are people that:\n1. would prefer more readability (e.g. a .zip like format to create external tools to read/transform .aseprite files),\n2. prefer better compression ratios in version control repositories (e.g. git), which means \"don't use zlib to compress pixels\",\n3. prefer to save versions (or undo history) of the sprite inside the same .aseprite file\nWe have to make choices here and discard what is not possible.\n. Fixed with 291e9c7ddef268451cd67217cfd3dcf8e5ca4e92 and 96ca735ed51f86ff7ab9ab29512e7efb4c7a5601. Already fixed in v1.0\n. See #796.\n. There are too much people requesting this feature so I'll try to implement it for v1.1.\n. I'll close this issue because several internal changed were made in the selection handling from v0.9.5.\n. All this is already implemented from v1.0.0 (even in v0.9.5 this functionality is available)\n. Possible shortcuts:\n- Shift key for union\n- Alt key for subtraction\n(the icon in the context bar should change when these keys are pressed)\n. This is the default ink from v1.0 (Alpha Compositing)\n. Err, the incremental painting isn't available in one single stroke (e.g. like in the Spray tool).\n. Actually we can scroll with Space bar + arrow keys.\n. Cels already have opacity, but it would be great to have a general opacity for the whole layer (which affects or changes the opacity of every cel in the layer).\n. Reference: http://imgur.com/Xv5LMTV\n. These use cases are already possible\n. Fixed for v1.1-beta3\n. It's already fixed (Aseprites saves settings in AppData folder now)\n. I've checked and this issue is fixed (at least from v1.1.4.1)\n. This is a Linux issue. Alt key move windows so we should configure other modifier for the eyedropper.\n. See #796 \n. Cannot be reproduced in v1.2.8, macOS 10.13.3. Maybe fixed in 1.0. Frames can be created in hidden and locked layers.\n. Now a rotated line brush is not thicker, but it leaves gaps (issue #728)\n. Needs #139 \n. This is the old issue fixed a lot of years ago with the modified Allegro version which now is gone, because we have the new laf library + skia backend.. Probably already fixed bug, we can reopen it if this reappears.. Fixed with commit d3dbc11451fed7166e08d64bcbe70d7721290a59\n. Already implemented.\n. Thanks @Mailaender\n. Fixed\n. It's already possible doing copy & paste or using drag-and-drop in the timeline moving the first frame passing the end of the animation. E.g. http://imgur.com/OcIjFXQ\n. Thank you @sirblackheart :+1:\n. Fixed\n. Sorry, I wasn't able to see to this issue. Anyway we have plans to change the backend library in the near future, so the cursor issues should be gone anyway. (Check issue #466)\n. Hi there! I'll add this change soon to the master branch. Thanks @rnlf \n. @rnlf do you have Pixel perfect checkbox enabled? Does it happen with other tools (e.g. Line or Rectangle)?\n. I've included the change to X_MAX_EVENTS. Anyway the final fix to this bug will be when the Skia port is ready on Linux (#139)\n. @farvardin hi! did you compile Aseprite on Release or Debug mode? (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RelWithDebInfo option in cmake)\n. You can check the value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE using cmake-gui . in the build dir (the same place where you ran cmake) or opening the CMakeCache.txt text file that is inside the same build dir.\n. OK, so it's another issue them \ud83d\ude05 \nIn these days I'll try to advance with the new back-end for Linux which is the only one that is still using Allegro (#139) which is aimed to improve the general performance.\n. Hi @Decap, I'm not sure if I can mute this for you, but see that you have the link to mute the thread in the same email at the bottom.\n. Implemented: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/48541af433e0f0d322fe1dbfeed1565a3d0ba456\n. There is a new --sheet-pack argument to create a compressed texture atlas from all the specified images in the command line. Ref: c9c8c6308f71b25b3584f24dfdd07eb0c57a0da6\n. New concept of continuous layers was implemented in 52003da72163e388930d45c9d894c1f881d93372:\n\nThis should fix several issues like #269, #389, part of #439. (And review #99.)\n. This was an old non-problem (v8 was never required to compile Aseprite).\n. This is already fixed in v1.1-beta5\n. Hi @oceanhahn, I'll contact you soon.\n. Hi @Jasozz, are you using v0.9.5? Contact me at support@aseprite.org, send me your .ase file and I'll see if I can repair it.\n. @Jasozz this bug is already fixed in v1.0; I'll take a look to your file this night or tomorrow (I want to prepare a new release in these days and it will take some time)\n. The \"preview\" part will be reviewed in v1.2.\n. That's right @sirblackheart, thank you!\n. With \"Set Alpha\" and \"Lock Alpha\" inks we can achieve the first part. The second part will be implemented with mask layers #459 \n. Dup #135 (the command key is already implemented in 1.0.5)\n. This is fixed from v1.0\n. References: #1209, #1223, #1224, #1288\n. This is already implemented in the Skia port.. Fixed\n. Tabs implementation will change for v1.1. Currently it does not make to split views and keep the same tabs area. In the future, we will be able to see a group of tabs for each split area (with the possibility to drag and drop tabs between those areas).\n. I close as this issue doesn't apply to the new workspace/draggable tabs system.\n. Issue #217 is already implemented and this feature not. So I'm reopening.\n. At the moment Edit > FX > Convolution Matrix > outline transparent layer is the only thing we have\n. Hi @antares38, do you mean a shortcut to apply a specific convolution matrix?\n. :+1:\n. Note: This could be done with a scripting API\n. The last export is Ctrl+Shift+X and now the Import Sprite Sheet is Ctrl+I (see  7144457249032e1d4bb642235c39175ad4aec704)\n. Fixed with 0aea78318a98180da96a1259962ea709b82d64bd\nYou can move the selection content with arrow keys, or selection boundaries with Alt+arrow keys.\n. Implemented with: c704d2053487909c48b97f8e112254c86e161dbf e850c8dbb0c6c687447d512c54182416102e6330 6064debe138d5b4553ee0f4462174b24f6655a1c ff66ea025cf2a4da14a542cbd2eda3dba770d90f 8eb8122bc07a16f6c09768d91a8de9065fed77d1 ccb86ff08bff88608eeb2baf1e1dc3866366fef5 35623cae88c87056a6c4edb45a21b637030029d5 6862e028056404834821a40485608270a796fb2a 8f8291a39bb88ec16c2b43e3813aa959b04b4885  37781c99ea2807a396229b0478eb938462d12a21 4c8ef458c94301759c96ff3dcffdcf506c690bf5 (maybe other commits)\n. This feature could be used to keep unsaved work on disk and restore it when the program is opened again (we need some kind of \"save session periodically\" and \"load session\" API). Maybe we don't need another process to do this kind of work. We could have another thread receiving data about user modifications and saving that data on disk immediately. Then the data on disk could be used to restore the whole session when the program is reopened.\n. Refer to #151 \n. This is already possible with frame tags.\n. This will be continue in #707 \n. Maybe related to #436. IDirectDrawSurface2::Restore() fails when a monitor is plugged or unplugged: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/src/allegro/src/win/wddbmpl.c#L122\n. This issue is fixed with the new possibility to load palettes from the main screen. About the color entries size in the color bar, see issue #259\n. Already implemented\n. This is fixed from v1.0\n. Yes, it's related to the patched Allegro version. I'll close this issue.\n. This issue is already implemented. The \"animation speed\" is now in #595\n. @elvisish hi there! I'll try to add this feature in v1.2 (maybe first beta), in a couple of weeks\n. @elvisish ^_^ I'm working on layer groups actually (quite hard to refactor the code); I'll try to work on this feature in parallel so we can get both features in the first v1.2-beta1 ;)\n. @elvisish thanks for the reminder \ud83d\ude05  I hope this will be available for v1.2 (which will be the next release, no more v1.1). @elvisish \ud83d\ude22  not yet (I moved several issues to the next beta just to avoid delaying v1.2-beta8 more). The first commit for this feature will include raw gradients (no dither methods yet, that in a second commit). Zoom controls should include a slider and a text entry box so the user can put the zoom % manually.\n. Should be fixed with c21a84c9c92db3262a865f997b6b9b0010e68920\n. Note: the transformation should be done in a temporal \"floating\" layer that should be part of the sprite. In this way we don't need to do all transformations in a whole \"undo transaction\".\n. Related issues to this one #690 and #275 \n. This change is too big for v1.1\n. We weren't able to reproduce the issue again, so I'll close this issue.\n. Several bugs were fixed from v0.9.5.\n. Duplicate: #253\n. I wasn't able to reproduce this bug. Maybe related to #443 and 3bbdb80461c6ebff3bc9915fc1383fc4f6b8e0fa\n. I'm quite sure this issue was fixed with in a767eb187d73a7218554347eab5d029ed73e5485 (released in official v1.0.3)\nNote: setTextf() is used in ui::Entry() constructor, and now we are using setText() which isn't a printf-like function.\n. This is already implemented for the next version (see #732)\n. I'm already working on this.\n. This is already possible in the Skia port (#139)\n. There is already some work-in-progress for this feature (I think it will appear on v1.2 beta2).\nhttps://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/741271831840194560\n. Implemented, this will be included in the next v1.2-beta2\n. @nakedpony I'm still thinking about this (as well as the Export Sprite Sheet when \"Selected layers\" are chosen). I think this is highly related to #1174\n. Maybe something like {layer} (the same as {layer0} for the first level), {layer1}, {layer2} etc. What do you think?\n. I was thinking and they are two different things. #1174 talks about a way to filter layers by name (I still need a syntax children, e.g. --layer \"parent > child\" to pick just one children).\nThe other one is about --filename-format or --save-as: For example --save-as {layer}-{layer1}-{frame}.png to save each frame of each layer with filenames like TopLevelLayerName-FirstChild-0.png,  TopLevelLayerName-SecondChild-0.png, etc.\nAnyway I'm not yet sure about this {layer1} syntax. Maybe {layer} should be always the layer name (in case we want to save all layers/groups/children with its layer name --save-as {layer}.png should work). And we could add new terms like {group} to indicate the name of the first parent group, {surgroup} for the parent of the parent, etc.\n. @nakedpony about the improvement \"if every layer could be exported separately to multiple tags,\" I'm not sure if I understood this correctly, but actually on v1.2-beta1 you can use something like:\naseprite -b myfile.ase --save-as '{layer}-{tag}-{frame}.png'\nOr maybe you want all frames of each \"layer+tag\" combination in one .png? In that case I'm thinking that we might have something like:\naseprite -b myfile.ase --sheet '{layer}-{tag}.png' --data '{layer}-{tag}.json'\n(Not yet implemented.)\n. About the group identifiers, I've found an alternative:\n- {layer} identifies the current layer (it can be a group or layer)\n- {group} identifies the first parent/group\n- {parent1}={parent}={group}\n- {parent2} the parent of the parent, etc.\n- {topgroup} the first group in the hierarchy of the current layer\n- {topgroup1}={topgroup}\n- {topgroup2} the child of the first group, etc.\nI'll just add {group} for the first iteration (v1.2-beta2).\n. I'm implementing this and more tricky scenarios are appearing. For example, if we have this structure:\n\nWe might try to use:\naseprite -b player.ase --save-as player-{group}-{layer}.gif\nIn this case, I'm sure that this should generate at least 4 files:\nplayer-head-eyes.gif\nplayer-head-shape.gif\nplayer-body-arms.gif\nplayer-body-shape.gif\nBut I'm not quite sure about the other layers (the groups). Should it generate the following files?\nplayer--head.gif\nplayer--body.gif\nOr these other files?\nplayer-head-head.gif\nplayer-body-body.gif\nI think that in this case it should generate 4 files and nothing else. And if we use the following command:\naseprite -b player.ase --save-as player-{group}.gif\nIt generates the following files:\nplayer-head.gif\nplayer-body.gif\nThere are a lot of tricky combinations and I'm not so sure what to do on each case. I'll thinking more about this and try to find a \"good enough implementation\" for the first version.\n. There is a part of this issue that wasn't yet implemented and I'll try to implement for v1.2-beta3, #1238 \n. A new --save-as parameter was added. Also now we can split layers with a --split-layers parameter, but it only works for sprite sheets at the moment. Ref: ce962f4999e4b52dace5a4d263c96c2fbbf17e45\n. I'm not sure if I understood the original feature, but the general idea would be:\n1. Be able to associate a mask layer to a regular layer (or group layer)\n2. The mask layer should be editable like a grayscale/background layer (8-bit), grayscale levels from 0 to 255.\n3. As a special case, the mask layer might be the composition of several other layers (i.e. the mask layer might be a group layer)\n. In the community: https://community.aseprite.org/t/layer-mask-for-color-and-transparency/311. See #454 \n. We are using giflib 5.1.0 to compile Aseprite (min requirement). About the O_BINARY I accept patches.\n. I'm using VS2012 and Clang to compile official versions of Aseprite.\n. Already implemented in #527 \n. Hi there! Currently you can load (File > Open) a sequence of images. For example, if they are named image00.png, image01.png, image02.png, etc. Also you can load a .gif file. Anyway there is no easy way to import the sequence to your own animation in v1.0.2, but v1.0.3 will include an option to copy and paste frames between animations, so the \"import\" will be possible. (I'm not quite sure if this satisfied the issue :smile:)\n. Wow that's an impressive run cycle! Keep in touch, I think this week will be v1.0.3 available. And remember that you can create issues to discuss mockups or UI aspects here in GitHub, or you can contact me directly to support@aseprite.org, whatever make you feel more comfortable. Best regards!\n. There are some comments about possible extra settings for the full-screen mode here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/1/357284767254601886/\n. Hi @msisinni, would you mind to put the color names in the gpl file? I'm planning to add color names in v1.1 so that would help a lot. Thanks!\n. Thanks for your work @msisinni :+1: \n. Hi @hiramgeeks, I wasn't able to look at this issue with detail yet, but after v1.0.3 release it's the first thing to do. In these years I was porting a lot of code from Allegro to other layers (src/ui and src/she), but there are a lot of work to be done yet (also, the modified version of Allegro 4 has several tweaks for Windows and Mac OS X, so I'm highly considering to port QuickDraw code to Quartz)\n. Related to #139 \n. I've just tested Aseprite on the official Yosemite release and it works. Maybe QuickDraw wasn't removed from Yosemite after all. Could someone else confirm that Aseprite is running correctly on Yosemite?\n. @bassarisse yeah, the cursor is not working quite good, I need to review it completely on OS X.\n@fserb are you using OS X 10.4u SDK? you need that SDK to compile it (see INSTALL)\nThanks to all for the testing!\n. hi @derloopkat, ok, I'll change the \"stop at grid\" unchecked by default which is the common behavior on common painting programs\n\n. Oh no, the \"Context\" column is something that indicates where/when the shortcut will be available. In what context, e.g. when we have the selection tool in the sprite editor (SelectionTool), or moving/transforming pixels (TranslatingSelection/ScalingSelection), etc.. I think it's already fixed in v1.0.3 (maybe issue #443). What specific commit are you using? (1.0.2-dev is a non-official version, so I need to know the specific commit) Could you test with v1.0.3?\n. The Mac OS X port is already working in this way and is something I'd really love to see working in the Windows side.\n. This feature is needed for the Steam release:\n- when we double-click a .ase file, a new Aseprite.exe is launched\n- if there is a Aseprite.exe running, we've to send a command to this instance to open the file, then we are done (we can close the second instance)\n- if we are the first Aseprite.exe instance running, we check if we are installed on Steam, in that case we've to launch the appid and close this instance (so the app is initialized from Steam).\n- the first running instance has to start in a \"server\" mode, so other instances can send commands to this instance (e.g. like open a file)\nThis IPC could be used to solve #533 too.\n. This can be solved on Windows using DDE. This is an old technology, but it looks like Microsoft Office is still using it, so we can go for it.\nNote: The Allegro port cannot handle DDE messages correctly, it looks like only the Skia port will be able to fix this issue. Anyway in the future, when we implement a full COM server, we can remove the DDE processing.\n. This fix will be available for first time in the beta branch of the Steam release. (It means, using the Skia branch + special registry keys to use DDE.)\n. I'm reopening this issue to add Linux support.\n. This should be working on Windows too, did you use the installer or the portable version? did you associate the .aseprite file format with Aseprite manually?. @daisyowl you can check the details of the #1070 issue to see how to associate other files as the .aseprite type. Related to #175, #418, and #1387 \n. Fixed with 0bab4e7ae7224181500b183d0c820248f3a3c949 and 2a15c58b5b78f0695a9651e599bbf8393809bf28. Thanks @benob, commit 886ff676f6cc9e1a477a52dc9984d2d87970c0f4\n. Hi there! Is this problem on Windows platform?\n. Would you like to try a beta just to see if this issue is fixed? (contact me at support@aseprite.org)\n. Glad to hear that, thanks for your help!\n. Are you trying in the background layer? I was testing and you can replace colors with transparency but it only works in transparent layers.\n. Hi there, could you please add an if() statement? we need CMP0046 for cmake 3.0\n. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Related to this, the Replace Color dialog might be non-modal, inside the color bar, or both (dockable)\n\n. Related to #707 \n. The \"Save copy as\" dialog already have a scale field. Anyway it would be great if encoders can receive an Image iterator that scale pixels \"on the fly\" (so we don't have to use extra memory to resize the sprite and undo it).\n. Done in d1d49c5038cd0fa9f427de33cf5ea638eb8f119f\n. Related to t/1181\nAbout the .ase spec: We might extend the frame duration to two WORD fields to include the decimal portion of a FIXED point number in the frame chunk.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. The PR was merged with master branch, not with 1.0. The main development is master, but 1.0 was created because several refactors that I didn't want to include on 1.0 branch. Please use master (last merge with 1.0 should work)\n. Invalid issue\n. Hi! At the moment we cannot use Xcode because it doesn't support the 10.4 SDK, so you need to compile with Unix Makefiles. Hopefully we'll be using a more recent SDK in the near future.\n. Already available in master branch\n. Hi @tobihan, could you please check if 97d42de6962d370a8880dc65e60896b37851b8a5 fixes this issue.\n. The shortcut will be Alt+Shift+G\n. Yeah, really annoying thing (I think it is a regression bug in v1.0.5 or v1.0.4). Anyway, to be fixed for 1.0.6 or 1.1 asap\n. You're right (it was added in my .git/info/exclude for a long time). Thanks for the report. I'll push a fix tonight.\n. Hi again! I didn't compile the last commits with clang or gcc yet, try to avoid the bleeding edge. I'll push a fix soon.\n. Dup #71\n. Yeah, I forgot to compile tests. I'll push a fix in a minute.\n. Done. Thanks for the report!\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Great! Thank you both\n. I'll take a look at these functions soon. Thanks for the log.\n. Some possibilities requested by other people:\n\nSource\n. Related to #250. Available variables for the format:\n- {fullname}: full file name with path and extension\n- {path}: directory where the file is located (without trailing /)\n- {name}: file name and extension (without path)\n- {title}: file name only, without extension and without path\n- {extension}: extension only (without .)\n- {layer}: layer name\n- {frame}: frame number (starting from 0)\n- {frame1}: frame number (starting from 1)\n- {frame00}: frame number (starting from 00)\n- {frame001}: frame number (starting from 001)\n- etc.\n. Nice :+1: Thanks for the report anyway!\n. We're using Git submodules now. You should do a\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\nTo clone simpleini and pixman submodules.\n. Hi, could you review the patch for platform that don't use the shared version of libpng (i.e. Windows and OS X)? I'm getting the following error: (png.h is not found in include directories)\n\\aseprite\\src\\app\\file\\png_format.cpp(35) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'png.h': No such file or directory\n. I think we can check USE_SHARED_LIBPNG variable.\n. Hi @hasufell, I'd like to review this PR. Would you like to sign our CLA?\n. These issues should be fixed in the ci branch.\n. Hi there! Actually onion skinning is useful when you've to draw the outline of your animation. It's quite hard to use onion skinning for opaque pixel art figures. Anyway I'll leave this issue open and add the extra option to control the order of rendering. But there is another related problem: Previous versions of Aseprite had the behavior you said, but it wasn't useful in most situations, i.e., when the background layer is visible. As you can see, onion skinning is a tricky issue, you have to provide options for all special cases.\n. If someone want to give a try to this change before the next release, please contact me at support@aseprite.org and I'll package a special build for you.\n. Now we will be able to Auto Select Layers from the Move tool using Ctrl key (or Command key on Mac OS X)\n. See #454 \n. Actually, I recommend you to use the command line to automatically convert & scale your images: http://www.aseprite.org/cli/#Resize-one-sprite-to-several-dimensions\nDup: #493\n. Hi @vaultec, this feature isn't yet in the program. I'm not sure if this will be included in v1.1 or v1.2, but it will be available in a near future.\n. As it's one of the most requested features, a simple version of this might appear in v1.1.\n. @robertocaldas I'd love to have this as soon as possible, maybe next week? :eyes: \n. This feature needs a lot of internal work to be done correctly (e.g. make any layer a reference layer so we can support animation references). The work needed for this is quite related to this feature #593 and it might be a good idea to prepare everything for #454 and #459 \nI think this will be the first feature opening v1.2 which I'd like to make it available on Steam beta branch. And as a first step, I'll make it something really simple: Select another file as reference from the Sprite > Properties. If I have enough time, I'll try to release the official release with fixes, and the beta branch on Steam.\n. As in one of my previous comments this will take some time. Mainly because it needs some special UI to move/scale the overlay in the desired location and a new render code. (Back in those days I thought it would be easy enough to be implemented quickly, but I was wrong.)\n. I'll start working on this right now \ud83d\ude2e \n. Pretty close, coming soon on v1.2-beta4:\n\n. \n. @bantonioch hola, actualmente aseprite est\u00e1 en v1.2-beta3, esta nueva caracter\u00edstica aparecer\u00e1 en v1.2-beta4.\n@bantonioch hi, actually aseprite is in v1.2-beta3, this new feature will appear in v1.2-beta4.\n. There is one case about this issue that worries me most: An indexed sprite with a RGB reference layer. The actual code converts the RGB reference to indexed, but this is not what a regular user would expect. The program should show the RGB reference image as it were RGB (without taking care about the indexed palette). This case needs that a sprite may contain different color modes on each layer (e.g. an indexed layer, and a rgb layer).\nI'll see that will be available as a first version of this feature to avoid introduced bugs or unexpected behaviors.\n. Will be available in next release (I hope this week). Merged impl in bc1ad97fb5eb927c4e6788ddaf8a0759b11a2aae\nFuture work in #1321\n. Hi @charyoshi, first of all you need the beta version. After that you will be able to use the Layer > Add Reference Layer menu option to select your own .png or .gif image as a background reference layer.. The ~~OS X~~ Linux version is the most problematic, which actually we cannot run two instances of the program (trial and full).\n. We should add support for OS X clipboard support so users can copy and paste or transfer sprites from trial version to full version.\n. Related to #172 and the clip library. We need to use custom clipboard formats to fix this issue.\n. For Linux clipboard support see #1100\n. I'm reopening this issue because we should add support for custom clipboard format to copy and paste layers between different instances (e.g. trial -> full version).\n. Hi there! What cmake version are you using? Which flags did you use to run cmake? E.g.\ncmake /home/yourplace/aseprite-clone -G \"Unix Makefiles\"\n(without any extra flag should do the work)\n. No more feedback given.\n. Nice catch! (I think I'll rewrite the whole README.md soon). Thanks! :)\n. Thanks again! (I love PR related to text files, they don't need testing :)\n. Hi there! is the mini-editor what you are looking for?\n\n. It looks related to issue #475 (record macros/actions). Anyway I was having a similar idea but for a completely different purpose: #381 - recover the whole work after a crash (or reproducing a crash). I'll leave this issue open for review when those issues are implemented.\n. I'm thinking that this issue can be a great way to improve testing and avoid regression bugs.\n. Hi there! This is a known issue. Thanks for reporting it as a issue. Currently cmake is not generating Visual Studio solutions correctly. So you should use the \"NMake Makefiles\" generator (or \"Ninja\" generator):\ncmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" aseprite-dir\n. It's reproducible only when we use dual monitors.\n. Thanks for the bug report! The fix will be released in v1.0.8 soon, I'll wait a couple of days just in case there are other critical bugs.\n. This is Ilija's idea to show fg, bg, and transparent color in the color bar:\n\n(fg is the white outline, bg is the dotted outline, and the dot is the transparent color)\n. We could use the transparent color (dot) in the color bar for both concepts: as the sprite/layers transparent color (Sprite > Properties > Transparent Color) and as the current selection transparent color (Context Bar > Transparent Color). This dot could be temporally changed to other color when we're moving a selection, and go back automatically to the sprite transparent color when we finally paste the selection. Also, could be a special palette entry to specify \"none\" so we can move completely opaque selections.\n. This bug is critical because users expects to move index 0 when they move the selection.\n. Move tool can move even hidden layers (when \"Auto select layer\" is not checked). It's another bug.\n. Thanks @vmrob for the help\nAs a side note, something that I don't like about GitHub, is that if you download the source code version with the Download ZIP button, subrepositories are not included in the .zip. So the zip is almost worthless.\n. I've already done some tests about this real-time dithering:\n\nAnyway it's relatively easy to dither the final render result with the current code, but that is useless, we need to dither an intermediate phase/image in the render code. The steps are:\n1. Render the sprite in one image (image A)\n2. Dither image A\n   1 Render the transparent grid in other image B\n3. Composite the background + dithered image (A+B)\n4. Blit the result in the screen\nFor this we need to rewrite the whole rendering code.\nAlso, with a new rendering code we could cache the rendered image A, and reuse it to improve the animation playback performance.\n. Are you trying the v1.0.6 tag? Can you try v1.0.8.1? or the 1.0 or master branch HEADs? This problem should be fixed with commit e0264787c62ab8cc05014be734080f391f8b4b75\nPlease confirm me if you are able to compile in those versions so I close this issue as duplicated of #541\n. Won't fix. Unable to reproduce.\n. Requested here too: https://community.aseprite.org/t/flip-view-horizontally/1663\n. Fixed\n. It looks like this issue was not included in the release (not even in commits/branches). Maybe it's in a stash, I've to find where the implementation is. :open_mouth: \n. I'll try to review this issue for the next release, #145 at least.. In case of linked cels, if the cel is completely empty and we're going to remove it automatically, should we remove all links too? I think we should but it might result in something unexpected for the user.\n. There is a temporary solution: http://imgur.com/3oSv3ZD\n. There are situations that the automatic-remap cannot be done and should popup a manual remap dialog. For example, now palettes can contain (e.g.) 16 colors, if we've used all those colors in the image, and then we remove the color with index 1, we've 15 colors, \u00bfwhere should we remap that index 1 to?\n. Fixed\n. Commit 90f988d92874c79a601bbe4aa242f441cfd83bd4\n. Hi @wiebow, actually this feature doesn't have a high priority. Anyway you can :+1: it so we can keep track of how much interest there is about it.\n. I'll start working on this.\n. Some progress in this feature: https://twitter.com/aseprite/status/734869697896845312/photo/1\n. This will be released in v1.2-beta1 in a couple of weeks\n. Thanks for your contribution @Mailaender!\n. From v1.1 the rendering code (used in the Editor and in save/export) was integrated and the Export Sprite Sheet exports only visible layers. Anyway an option to select which layers to export would be great. Something like:\n1. Visible layers\n2. Selected layers\n3. All layers\n. Thanks for your contribution @whitingjp!\n. It's the correct color.h :smile: I've move the render code from doc to render namespace, so the it looks like gcc cannot disambiguate the problem now. Thanks for the contribution @whitingjp!\n. Should be fixed with #572 \n. Hi there! Today I've merged two pull requests to fix these problems: #571 and #572. About the source code, at the moment the only way to get the full source code is using Git and submodules. The process is described in the CONTRIBUTING file\n. In Photoshop (on Windows) Alt transform from center, Shift scale with square aspect, and Ctrl make a perspective or horz/vert skew.\n. Hi @DragonDePlatino! That's true. Now grid settings are saved in a per-file basis and we cannot set the default grid size. At this moment, my recommendation is that you could create a template.ase with a 24x24 grid (the settings will be kept for that specific file). And then, when you want to create a new file, open template.ase and then you can use Save As....\n. Actually this is already working again using View > Grid > Grid Settings when there is no other document opened (e.g. on the Home tab).\n. It can be done with pins in the new home tab (#380) \n. The \"Sprite Size\" dialog could contain some of those algorithms (as well as the \"Save As\" dialog, maybe related to #493)\n. You're welcome @GRRRRRRRRRR and thanks to @aaptel for the help!\n. Hi there! This is possible. Cels can be moved outside the sprite bounds. It's an expected behavior. So basically a Cel position can be in the -32767 <= x  <= 32767 range.\n. Don't worry, I'll add more information about the Cel position (SIGNED WORD) in ase.txt file. About the palettes, from the Introduction section:\nColor palettes are in FLI color chunks (it could be type=11 or type=4). For color\ndepths more than 8bpp, palettes are optional. See fli.txt for details.\nI think it would be better if we've the palette chunk in the same ase.txt just to avoid confusion or the need of fli.txt file. Thanks for your help.\n. Hi @gcmartijn! Have you try the Command Line Interface? I think that you could create a .bat/.sh file to export each layer. Let me know if it does help.\n. :+1: I'll close this issue. You can create then a new one if you need some improvement.\n. Hi! I'll try to add this new option in v1.0. About v1.1, would you like to try a beta? Send me an email to support@aseprite.org ;)\n. Hi @bberak, via the UI you can specify it in the GIF alert just after selecting the gif file:\n\nThere is no option via CLI at the moment \ud83d\ude22 I'll take note about this in my to-do list.\nA possible workaround would be to indicate a long delay in the last frame.. Nice catch! ^_^\n. Hi! Maybe that flag is wrong. What gcc --version does Ubuntu include? Could you try -std=c++11 or -std=c++0x here?\n. Unix Makefiles should be fine. Did you try to change -std=gnu++11 with -std=c++11 or -std=c++0x?\nhttps://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/src/CMakeLists.txt#L154\nif(UNIX)\n  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wall -Wno-switch -std=gnu++11\")\nendif()\n. Hi @Bloodyaugust. I've see this issue and as the C++11 support in 4.6 is not as complete as gcc 4.8, you should use gcc 4.8. You can install gcc-4.8 package:\nsudo apt-get install g++-4.8\nAnd then, before you run cmake:\nexport CXX=\"g++-4.8\"\n. Thanks for reporting this. I don't have a retina display to test it, so I will need some help in this one. Would you like to contact me at support@aseprite.org?\n. Another thing, could you try to change Edit > Preferences > Screen Scale to 1:1 just to test how it works?\n. It's probable that if the application is not inside a bundle with a Info.plist, OS X thinks that the app is high-DPI aware (supports retina display). And if it has a Info.plist, it isn't high-DPI aware (there is a special Info.plist property to specify this explicitly).\nI don't know if there is a possibility to specify a Info.plist outside an app bundle. Anyway I'm thinking that the next version v1.1 should be high-DPI aware. At the moment my recommendation for you is to do a \"post compilation\" process, copying the generated Aseprite binary inside the trial app bundle.\n. Thanks for the extra info @CharlesLillo \n. Fixed\n. Should be fixed with latest changes in master branch\n. Hi there! I think that \"Native mouse cursor\" feature should be disabled/hidden on Linux, it was created for Windows and Mac OS X. Mainly because I don't have a real PC with Linux installed on it, so I cannot test how the native cursor works (VMs are tricky to reproduce mouse UI issues).\n. I'll close this issue. Thanks @GeertJohan.\n. Thank you! I always write \"main\" when I want to write \"mind\" :smile: \n. Should be fixed in the master branch\n. Fixed\n. Hi @blackmiaool, sorry that I didn't reply about this yet, I'll take a time to review this PR and tell you more about it soon. Thanks for your help!\n. :smile: I'm on it just right now. Fixing some conflicts in the merge and testing your change. Soon it'll be integrated in master branch.\n. I've tested this change and it fixes (at least for the last master commit  b4d3e5681e80c3d1783592653be2050a51332718) a flicker in the status bar when selecting cels in the timeline (the flicker is in frames and layers anyway). I've fixed this problem in other way (checking if the specific widget has the mouse before we update the status bar). Thanks for your contribution anyway.\n. The current master is compiling on Ubuntu, are you getting some error?\n. I'll check later just in case. The whole base/ library should include <cstring> instead of <string.h>\n. What Linux distro and specific gcc version are you using?\n. Hi @gerroon, could you try the latest commit in master branch? I think it should work in that distro, anyway I'll create a VM tomorrow with Debian to give it a try.\n. At the moment you can drag-and-drop files to the Aseprite icon in the dock bar and it should be open on Aseprite.\n. Integration with Finder will be implemented in #834 \n. Hi there, if you don't want to pay for something, you don't need to justify yourself, don't worry, I'll not feel bad about it :smile:\nThe source code is available for programmers (C++ programmers). Open source is open for people who knows how to fix/change things, that is the whole case of the \"freedom\" in code, in other case we are just lying to ourselves. If you cannot see and change the code anyway (because lack of knowledge), open source is just not \"open\".\nI think that I've spent an incredible amount of time making Aseprite compilable in 3 platforms and give a product fully open source. But sometimes I cannot test all toolchains, and something will be wrong (e.g. I compile regularly only on Windows, and I use Ninja/makefiles, I don't use Visual Studio solutions/IDE to compile). In those cases, I expect help from other people. It's quite hard to keep the master (or any) branch clean/compilable when you are developing (even when you make tags, when a release is more important for customers than a compilable repository).\nI would like to ask you some questions. Do you think that the time you have spent compiling the program is more valuable that the years I've spent programming the product? Do you really think that modifying a couple of lines in some scripts worth something? Do you think you can give customer support, add new features, and fixing bugs? Do you really think that the whole point of a product is just the \"compiling\" process? Please say \"no\", please, I'll be depressed some days in other case :disappointed: \nI'll tell you something because I fell like you think that I've made the compilation process \"difficult\" on purpose: I've done a lot (A LOT) to make Aseprite easily compilable. Even sometimes I've taken decisions (stupid decisions) driven just by the whole idea to make a \"easily compilable\" program. Some of those decisions are:\n- I avoided Boost libraries (a huge set of C++ libraries)\n- I've included all third party libraries in the same repository (something you should not expect in other open source programs)\nI think that you aren't a C++ programmer, otherwise (just because those two items) you should be grateful to me. I hope you can see the work behind Aseprite, and that sometimes is more important to give a good end-user product instead of a zero-error-compiling-process (E.g. in my list of priorities, bugs in the product are more important than bugs in the compiling process, so I've to dedicate more time fixing bugs in the product).\nAbout some specific points:\n\nStrange that the developer did not do this...\n\nI don't use the cmake GUI tool, so my change was enough to create a working solution from the command line (sorry it didn't work with the cmake GUI tool). And please notice that this change was not needed for me (I compile with Makefiles anyway), so basically I was doing something for other person (and it worked for that person at the moment).\n\ndonations weren't working? what? where was i able to donate before? surely i'm not the only one who finds this a little suspicious...\n\nWe're still accepting donations, and there are two links inside the program to donate (Support this project at the status bar, and Help > Donate menu) and I've made a Pledgie campain. Nothing worked. Basically it's quite hard to live with donations (at least 12 years show me that). Moreover, it's hard to live selling a product, if knowing that makes you happy.\nP.S. In the future I'll be making more intelligent decisions, so expect to compile all third party libraries by hand, I've to update all of them, and I'll not be including their source code anymore in the repository. Just to avoid third party (security) bugs.\n. > Sorry for being so harsh.\nDon't worry at all :+1: \n\n\nDo you think you can give customer support, add new features, and fixing bugs?\n\nI do it for a living, so yes?\n\nWell, I was talking about Aseprite customer support, new features, and bug fixing :smile: \n\nCMake from command line still uses the same CMakeList scripts,\ndoesn't it?\n\nIt should, so it's a really strange behavior. Maybe cmake GUI prefers option() values instead of inline set() as default values to fill the CMakeCache.txt file. I'll give a try to the whole solution creation process using the command line and the GUI, and try your change, maybe that set(BUILD_RELEASE_DEBUG_DIRS ON) is better than set(BUILD_RELEASE_DEBUG_DIRS 1).\n\nI'm familiar enough with C/C++ to call myself a C++ programmer.\n\nSo you know, C++ toolchains are a complete mess, it's a pity, but is the current state-of-the-art :sob:\n\nI broke down the steps [...], but I know what it's like to get a bug report that only says: \"It's broken, and not working, fix it!\".  I didn't want to do that. [...] But I wanted to make a point as well (I'm sorry for that)\n\nDon't worry. You can share with me any opinion you like, but I'd prefer them in comments, or tweets, or emails (or a link to a specific blog post). I know you wanted to describe the whole thinking process, anyway I'd prefer short issues and to the point: problem+fix-business issues :wink:\n\nI'm going to donate anyway.  I was thinking about it all day yesterday.  I think you deserve it, especially for reading my post and replying with all this (thank you).\n\nThank you! Anyway you'll prefer to buy it: https://gumroad.com/l/aseprite\nIf you need to use PayPal, contact me at support@aseprite.org\n\nWhat strikes me as \"unethical\" is that you're not actually selling anything. You're just selling a different format of information, an extra step in the development lifecycle.\n\nI'm selling several things. Code signing certificates aren't cheap. Also I'm using a clean Windows virtual machine to create official binaries and an untouched MacBook to compile both binaries (to avoid viruses). This build \"infrastructure\" isn't cheap. I'm a registered Apple developer, and member of BizSpark program, that means in the future I'll renew a MSDN subscription :cry: \n\nheck I make a worthless sum at my current job, which is why I'm considering a different career.\n\nYou shouldn't give up if you really like to program. Don't give up!\n\nThat said, it's not my place to tell you how to do business. I'm just giving you my thoughts on the subject.\n\nI appreciate them. If that is your concern, Aseprite is actually my only job (more info), so it's working pretty well, it could be a lot better, but I can afford a life with it.\nBest regards and thanks to share your thoughts!\n. Done. It was giving problems again so I've included your fix. I think this is a new cmake behavior (maybe 3.0), but I cannot tell for sure why this problem appeared again.\n\nIf I spot anything else that I think I can fix, I'll be sure to let you know (with a little more tact next time. ;).\n\nAnd every contribution will be welcome!\n\nYou made an awesome application - there's a reason I came back to download it again. ;)\n\nThanks for your kind words!\n. Hi @AsukaLangleyfag, there is a fix for this issue already in the master branch (commit 2c408e4c98b9cc0d775309f17100cd0b882f4671). See #606 for more information.\n. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Hi @gra0009, thanks to report this issue. I'll be testing it soon. (I've a intuos pen to test it.)\n. Finally fixed with 56e663bca437c39e463e21d3bbcc0493bcfbf783 (Linux will be supported in a near future)\n. Hi @Xodetaetl, I'll leave a note on #139 about this.. @dudewithgames if you are on Windows or macOS, the eraser tip should be recognized, are you on Linux?. hi @Blathers, could you please try the --debug parameter? Check this then send me the Output.txt file to support@aseprite.org. Hi @Nsheppard01, know issue about prepackaged Linux version on Debian-based distros. More info\n. Hi @gcmartijn, have you tried using --trim option? It might be useful to compact your data (anyway you will need the --data file.json to know the trimmed rectangles).\n. Hi @MrHalfman, see #550, it's the same problem.\n. Hi @grozen. It happens when we draw in a cel and then move it (with Move tool, V key, or Ctrl+drag). As cels can be bigger than the sprite canvas, when we move it, the content that is not visible still does exist. It was done in this way to support scrolling a cel over time (something possible in the early versions of Aseprite). Anyway I think that will never be supported again so I should remove this behavior. I will think about it (because it can be useful for rotation too).\n. Hi @martinkg, Aseprite doesn't use V8 at this moment (this was added just for testing scripting capabilities). You can (and should) ignore this warning. (Also I'm planning to remove V8 completely and start testing mruby for scripting.)\n. Hi @martinkg, see #550, it's the same problem.\n. Sorry, what is that package.spec thing? (I'm not familiar with Fedora) and how does it affect an unrelated Git clone/directory?\n. OK. I'll close this issue as it looks like a specific problem packing Aseprite for Fedora.\n. Hi @martinkg. I would prefer just one issue for all these problems related to Fedora :smile: (at least I think that you can comment on closed issues anyway and I can reopen them if it's needed).\nI don't compile on Linux regularly (I compile on Ubuntu from time to time), so I will try to do my best guessing this problem: It looks like google test library doesn't work with that specific gcc version, I can recommend you to just compile aseprite (make aseprite) so you can avoid compiling tests.\n. I'll try to compile Aseprite on Fedora today, so I'll see this issue and #696.\n. Hi @PixelBangs, I've tested this in a Win8 -> Win8 remote desktop session and it works.\nWhat screen configuration (width, height, bits per pixel) are you using for the remote session?\n. Please comment this issue if you are able to reproduce this problem with the latest version (v1.1.6).\n. Test this with the Skia back-end #139 \n. Thanks @msiedlarek !\n. Hi @Mailaender, sorry about that, I've a personal TODO item to fix this. Try to compile with the ENABLE_UPDATER flag on.\n. Hi @KasumiArai, there is a new way to change the default palette: http://i.imgur.com/UbtXi95.gifv\nAnyway I'm thinking that something was lost with this new behavior. It's not possible to set as default a palette that is outside Program files\\Aseprite\\data\\palettes folder.\nI'll leave this issue open to add an option to make the current palette as default palette (and the palette will be copied to the user's configuration directory, so it's not lost).\n. Fixed\n. Nice catch. I'll disable that command when there is no cel. (And I'll try to add some kind of feedback to show why each command is disabled.)\n. I've added #631 related to this issue\n. (Related new problem on issue #669)\n. It might be useful to export pixel-art that uses blend modes, shadows, lighting effects, etc.\nE.g. https://twitter.com/Uknowleo/status/780113597129191424\n. Requested here too: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/1/2425614539586488144/\n. Not yet \ud83d\ude22 but I was thinking that a possible workaround would be to distribute a ffmpeg.exe and use it from Aseprite to convert .png files to .avi/.mp4 from the UI.. I think this should be already fixed in master branch\n. Would be this possible using native menus?\n. Hi there! It's planned :smile: it didn't make the first betas, but it will be included in the next beta for sure!\n(And Alt+drag and drop for Mac OS X)\n. Issue #61 is related to this one if we can implement the full screen preview as an EditorState.\n. Hi @Dovaa, we are not distributing official Linux builds at this moment. More information here.\n. Hi @Kelvin-Shadewing, if you have saved your work, the original file should contain the state when you saved it. The recovery data is special data saved in %AppData%/Aseprite/sessions folder.\nI think that it might generate some confusion the distinction between the original file you open/save, and the recovery data that is internal stuff (that is saved automatically each 2 minutes). When the \"Data Recovery\" feature is used, the data is loaded from the internal sessions folder (the original file is not even looked).\nI'll try to find a way to recover different versions: the original file, and couple of automatic saved versions from the data recovery internal folder.\n. I think you could try to change the screen scale option to 1:1 from Edit > Preferences: http://www.aseprite.org/faq/#Why-do-I-see-double-sized-pixels\n. If you are on Linux the only (official) way to get the new version is compiling it (we don't distribute official packages for Linux, sorry). The improvements are listed in the release notes page (you can start looking from the bottom of the page to see what was introduced in v1.0)\n. @vegeta897 hi there! I don't have plans to remove the UI Elements Scaling option, also I've two things to say about this: 1) I'd like to improve it a little bit (there are some UI elements that don't look 100% accurate/same as in 100% scaling), and 2) I've plans for a new skin/theme for bigger resolutions/non-pixelated.\n. Just in case @lemonplz, if it doesn't work, try to create a new \"build\" directory from scratch, a re-run cmake aseprite-folder -G \"Unix Makefiles\"\n. The source code zip created by automatically by github is useless as they don't contain the third party code. I've already contacted to GitHub about this. At the moment cloning the repository with submodules is the only way to get source code with its dependencies.\n. Hi there! In your example you have used an array of dictionaries with one key <-> value. I see JSON files like these where it's an array of objects (with a \"filename\" to identify each item).\nAs there are so many formats as possible, I'm thinking that a template system could be the best option. (I don't know the most common texture atlas formats, Unity 2D, cocos 2d, haxeflixel, etc. I'd need to find some reference.)\n. I'll add the json array format, but as in my previous comment: an array of objects with filename attribute. For your example, the output would be something like this:\n{\"frames\":[\n{\n\"filename\":\"ground\",\n\"frame\": { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"w\": 2048, \"h\": 417 },\n\"rotated\": false,\n\"trimmed\": true,\n\"spriteSourceSize\": { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 351, \"w\": 2048, \"h\": 417 },\n\"sourceSize\": { \"w\": 2048, \"h\": 768 },\n\"duration\": 100\n},\n{\n\"filename\": \"air\",\n\"frame\": { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 417, \"w\": 2048, \"h\": 376 },\n\"rotated\": false,\n\"trimmed\": true,\n\"spriteSourceSize\": { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"w\": 2048, \"h\": 376 },\n\"sourceSize\": { \"w\": 2048, \"h\": 768 },\n\"duration\": 100\n}\n]}\n. But it looks like the \"standard\" attribute is called filename (not name or layername). I would like to implement this in the most generic way. Then we can use the filename as the layer name (--filename-format {layer}, or {layer}-{frame} or whatever we need.\nI'll add a --format option. It'll be json-hash by default, but we can use json-array. The format will be almost the same. The expected output for a --format json-hash and --format json-array output.\n. Hi there! The original/expected behavior was (9db66ce6b246acd19d6986c0643dac273da1dae4) this:\n- Paste in the original location if that location is visible.\n- In other case center to the viewport.\nBut it was buggy. Now I've a new implementation.\n. Hi @oceanhahn, if you are on Windows, you can get this behavior from v1.1-beta2 using the native dialog to select files (activate it from Edit > Preferences > Experimental > Use native file dialog)\n. \n. Thanks @agateau !\n. Included in #420 \n. Nice catch! I've never clicked a menu to closed it :smile: and yeah, menus work as you said.\n. The last one. I was thinking to implement that View > Home should focus/jump the Home tab when it's not selected. (And do nothing if it's visible and selected.)\nRecommendation: Instead of making getHomeView() public, you could try to add a new public member function to MainWindow, something like MainWindow::selectHomeView()\n. Fixed with #653\n. Replace the commit message (you will need to amend the commit and do a push --force). Use some message like \"Select Home tab when it's not selected in HomeCommand\"\n. Just as a note, it's not necessary to close a PR and open another, you can amend the commit and push ---force it (the PR is updated)\n. It looks good, tomorrow I'll test it and merge it (11:40pm here)\n. It's low priority, but if you want to fix it, go for it :sweat_smile: \n. Fixed\n. I think that commit 4f33bef43ce33b008c0ab55b3259eb2e15874680 should fix that problem (pull from master branch)\n. Hi there, you are using Indexed color. The first color palette is the transparent one by default. You can change this index in Sprite > Properties, or you can use RGB color mode (You can choose RGB in File > New)\n. No problem :wink: \n. From some time ago I'm thinking that RGB mode should be the default color mode, as it looks like the expected behavior mode (RGB mode is more like MS Paint or Photoshop, a more user-friendly approach). Nowadays I'm not quite sure. (It's like Indexed mode is related to a specific old-hardware representation which new users don't care about.)\n@imakeretrogames there is some information here: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/color#Indexed but it's hard to figure out the relationship between the transparent index, transparent layers, and indexed mode. I'll see how I can improve this aspect (maybe related to #740).\n@Async0x42 I think that the Color bar/palette could show the transparent index as \"transparent\" when a transparent layer is selected, e.g. \n\nAnyway I'm open to new ideas in these aspects. What do you think about RGB being the default color mode?\n. As a temporal solution you could use Frame > Constant Frame Rate and set a value equal to 1000 / FPS (for example, for 24 FPS, 1000 / 24 \u2248 41.\n. Thanks to report this. In some way I've found this bug a couple of times and never remembered to add it in my personal TODO list.\n. Fixed\n. Thanks for reporting this @agateau, I'll fix compiling issues before I tag. At least I'll try to compile on gcc before I tag. The general idea from now on will be to keep tags compilable on three compilers.\nAnother approach that I'm thinking of is not pushing commits until I reach a new release. Which looks pretty reasonable because I'm getting too much compiling issues reported.\n. I've considered Travis but anyway I don't have gcc at hand (on Windows) to fix a compilation problem quickly. At the moment the compiler priorities are VS, clang, gcc. I work daily with VS and compile in clang in periods of two or three days. (I almost never compile in gcc.)\nMy priorities are: customer support, bug fixing, new features, and at the end, compiling problems.\n. I'd love to receive pull requests for this kind of issues :heart_eyes:\n(After v1.1-beta3, I'll start dedicating some time to Linux binaries)\n. Anyway I'm not quite sure about this one. I'd prefer #631 \n. Thanks again @agateau :+1: \n. Fixed. There are some issues yet, mainly related to remapping colors that where deleted, as now the palette size can change. Related to issue #563 \n. Hi @Nsheppard01, just in case, did you compile the debug or release version? You can check this in your build directory, there is a CMakeCache.txt file. If you have this line:\nCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug\nIn that file, you have compiled the debug version (which is much slower than the official version). Change that to:\nCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RelWithDebInfo\nIf you have compiled the release version it's related to other issue that we can start look at.\n. Yeah, you should change that line to:\nCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RelWithDebInfo\n(It's strange that it's in Profile, anyway, the RelWithDebInfo should be faster.)\n. Yes.\n. :+1: I'm glad it worked. And sorry for the compiling process. In these days I'm trying to see how to create a Linux package (it will take some time).\n. Yes, it's exactly this problem.\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Hi @agateau, I'm not quite sure about this descending order of sessions. I was thinking in an ascending order just to know what sprites should be restored (were lost) first. The idea is that a session should be deleted after it's recovered.\n. I think that we should fix that curl-related problem. Maybe a setlongjmp is missing.\n. > I expected recovered sessions would automatically delete themselves when recovered. This is what happens in other creation software, no?\nYeah. The best way would be something like this: All sprites from a crash sessions are recovered and the session is deleted (automatically). Anyway as the data recovery is in an early development stage, the program could crash when the session is being recovered. (Luckily I've never experienced this, but I think it could happen, e.g. a lot of images to recover, an huge animation with lot of frames, or invalid data, bugs, bad_allocs, etc. several situations that are not fully contemplated.)\nAnyway, as you see, is something to improve.\n\nRegarding the curl-related problem [...] Have you experienced it as well?\n\nNo, I haven't. Are you on Linux, right? Are you using a shared libcurl version?  Or just the one included in third_party dir? I've to update the source code of the curl library (converting it to a submodule).\n. I'll take a look to the curl issue (issue #679)\n. Probably I'll modify the way data recovery sessions are being shown. I don't like the current UI so maybe a grid or something similar, I'll see how to solve it (If I made a grid, it's pretty sure it will used for the keyboard shortcuts dialog too.)\nIt would be nice to have a \"Date\" column that we can click and re-sort the grid.\n. Hi @rcorre, at this moment keyboard modifiers with mouse wheel are not configurable. I think 'Action Modifiers' is a good place too. Planned for v1.1\n. Other possibility: key+mouse wheel to change tool alpha value (or maybe alpha component of current foreground color)\nhttps://twitter.com/Skaz_/status/930806961053904896\n. (Internal note: I've added some debug checks about this issue in 71efdfdf762dcfe3a34b7660fcef078a8930e81c)\n. I've found the real problem here. I'll push a fix in a couple of minutes.\n. Hi @saint11, actually you can configure the onion skin range dragging the onion skin range indicators: http://www.aseprite.org/assets/images/frames-and-layers.gif\nAbout \"onion skin loops animation\", see the issue #555\n. Yeah, I'll keep issue #555 open, and I'll try to take a look to that one tomorrow :wink: \n. Related to #68\n. Note for dev: if we add a custom item in the file selector, remember to customize native dialogs #321\n. \n. Duplicated #529\n. Hi @oceanhahn, this is something I thought about it. There is a \"projects\" feature (#126) that should save all this information and more. Anyway as we could save grid settings inside .ase files I'll leave this issue open to be reviewed for v1.1 milestone.\n. A similar situation happens on Photoshop: Until you don't finish the transformation, you cannot do anything else in the program (almost every single command is disabled)\n. See #275 \n. Fixed\n. Hi @Nsheppard01. If a compiled version (dev) matches a beta version, (in this case both are v1.1.0), the compiled version will say it's updated. You have to compile it regularly to keep it updated.\n. To recompile you can update your copy source code:\ngit pull origin master\ngit submodule update --init\nAnd run make from your build directory.\nOr you can just start the whole process again recloning the repository as in INSTALL.md\n. And after the compilation the result will be in your build/bin/ directory (the old aseprite will be overwritten)\n. It looks like a wrong call to find the shared version of gtest library in https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/third_party/CMakeLists.txt#L39\nI'll fix this later, anyway you should be able to compile it without the shared version. As gtest was converted to a submodule, try to do:\ngit submodule update --init\nAfter that, third_party/gtest/CMakeLists.txt should exist (as this line requires)\nThanks to report the issue!\n. Hi @Mailaender, I'm testing travis in ci branch, maybe it will be merged to master today if everything goes right. Hope it helps.\n. Done. Travis is already configured in master to build four configurations: gcc/clang and shared/not-shared libraries. Hope it helps!\n. Hi @Ragzouken, actually Aseprite handles palettes of 256 colors only (even when you see 16 colors in the palette, so all the black entries are part of the palette too). So when there isn't a selected color range, the whole palette (256 colors) is sorted.\nTo temporally fix this situation you can select the first (e.g.) 16 colors and then use \"Sort by\" to sort the selected range only (and not all those black entries in the 256 color palette). Anyway I'll leave this issue open to fix this problem and finally add support for palettes with less than 256 colors.\n. This will be fixed with #668 \n. This is fixed for the next release v1.1\n. Hi @martinkg, I've marked this issue as fixed. But if you find it's not fixed yet, you can reopen it.\n. We cannot reproduce the issue.\n. Thanks for the PR! :+1:\nFrom: https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/gimp-palette-solarized\n. I'm pretty sure this could be related to the bug fixed in this commit 59cdae77159683f7662f405f1cf2450a6920599f\nFrom your email, I saw that your file has .txt extension. If you rename it to .gpl it should work.\n. Hi @Nsheppard01, I'll close this PR. Some points:\n- Don't worry about white spaces in current palettes or Name: property, I'll add these properties in case the program starts using them.\n- It looks like the solarize palette doesn't have a black entry in index 0\n- I'll prefer one PR for each logic change (instead of adding several unrelated changes to one PR)\n- I'm not quite sure to start adding a lot of palettes. I'll take a look to the x11 and monokai later, but I'd prefer pixel-art related palettes.\n. That would be great @Nsheppard01!\n. Hi @Nsheppard01, could you sign our CLA?\n. Hi Eric, it looks like you have run cmake for the aseprite\\src folder instead of aseprite folder:\nC:\\aseprite\\src\\build\nshould be\nC:\\aseprite\\build\nIf you ran cmake ..\n. Fixed\n. Disabled by default:\n\n. This is a work-in-progress:\n\n. I'll review this stuff later (at least I hope to add some kind of color harmonies for v1.1.0, in other case it will appear on v1.1.1)\n. I've done something for the next version (RGB only, RYB will be available in v1.1.1 or v1.1.2, we'll see):\n\n. Something like Photoshop color picker should be available too: \n\n. We can implement a RYB color wheel applying a color curve to the hue component http://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/1748/function-to-convert-hsv-angle-to-ryb-angle\n. Another color picker was proposed: http://www.husl-colors.org/\n. Hi @PassiveAggressor, yeah, at least the saturation slider would be really useful in the color wheel. I don't know if it will be make v1.1.3 as I would like to release a patch today with this new color selector:\n\n. > That selector looks even better. Maybe it could have a horizontal \"slider\" for alpha underneath that hue \"slider\" ?\nI think an alpha slider could be a good option for all color pickers. I've to think about a new UI that can be mixed with the current color spectrum/wheel/tints + foreground/background color chooser.\n. For next version: New saturation and alpha sliders:\n\nThere are HSL sliders too:\n\nThe color selector still needs works and an unification with RGB/HSV sliders and the palette editor.. Hi @farnold. Actually the Windows port does't use the poll mechanism for the mouse, so the same behavior needed to be ported to OS X. So thanks for this patch! I'll be testing and merging this PR soon.\nMeanwhile, could you sign our CLA? Thanks again!\n. > You're welcome!\n\nWell then it's for all the other platforms using allegro4. ;)\n\nYeee :smile: \n\nCLA is signed\n\nExcellent, it looks fine. I'll need the email to cla@aseprite.org too (sorry for the inconvenience)\n. Hi @Nsheppard01, by default Aseprite should ignore the pen pressure. If you've tried to use a pen with v1.0.9 or v1.1 on Windows, it should work ok (without detecting pen pressure anyway). There are some know issues associated with Wacom driver and Windows Ink\n. Requested here too:\n* https://community.aseprite.org/t/does-or-will-aseprite-support-pressure-sensitivity/1077\nand several other places.. I think I'll gray out the option, because it can be confusing if there are tags in frames  (E.g. should it reverse the whole animation or just the tagged frames?\n. Fixed\n. From Steam forums:\n\nRight now, even if you don't have full-on isometric-recognition mode implemented, could you at least please add (x-delta, y-delta) options for the Tiling mode? Something as simple as that would help with isometric tile editing immensely, and I don't think it should be too difficult to implement.\n. On the community forum too.. Other from the forum. Nobody is working on this one at the moment @jaybill, if you have some mockups about this they will be welcome \ud83d\udc4d I think the first idea that came to my mind is the possibility to create isometric grids (like the regular grid), where snap to grid should work in those new kind of isometric grids.. Hi @SolarLune, you have two options: one using --list-slices and --data in the CLI or using a special .aseprite-data file e.g. your sprite is player.ase you can create a player.aseprite-data with this content:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<sprite>\n  <slices />\n</sprite>\nThis is an undocumented feature, I need to write more details about this.\nEDIT: Tomorrow I'll test the Slices checkbox in the export dialog just in case, something might not be working (did you try using other checkbox like layers too?). > * View -> Show -> Slices Names / Slices UserData / Slices Info\n\ud83d\udc4d \n\n\nallow CTRL to show visible slices names (with user data next row)\n\n\nNot sure about this one (because it mixes with the Move tool). Also the Move tool requires some extra functionality to move slices too (the same for selection transformation).\n\n\nmove them to Slices Layer to allow hide/show groups of slices (leave global slices as special case)\nallow to open list of slices inside Slices Layer and edit their keyframes\nadd \"Hide Slice\" option to slice context popup menu\n\n\nThere are plans to integrate Slices in the Timeline in that way but it was too much work for v1.2 so it was never done. It's planned for 1.3.\n\n\nallow select multiple slices & edit their merged properties (name, user data, x/y/w/h, etc)\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d requested several times by other users too\n\n\nallow hide/delete multiple slices and \"Select All Slices\" (Ctrl+A in Slice Tool mode?)\nallow CTRL+C/X/V for slices\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d \n\n\nhighlight clicked slice, allow click next slice at same point (for intersecting slices) with click-without-drag and then move/resize this one slice with click-and-drag (also highlighting whle dragging/resizing)\n\n\nI'll see the exact details about selecting one slice/multiple slices later.. Actually as slices can have width=1 and height=1 they can already act like a hotspot, so I'm not sure if this feature will be implemented, maybe just like an alternative kind of slice, for example there can be three kind of slices:\n\nregular slice (just a rectangle)\n9-slices kind (a rectangle + an inner rectangle)\na hotspot (just one pixel, xy-position, no width, no height). Actually the slices need some work to be completely finished. For example, the timeline should show slices like a layer group, so they can be edited like cels and we can detect when the slice changes from position on each frame. The current implementation is most for a static image than an animation (also I've to think a little more about these \"keyframes\" structure and how to save them in .aseprite files, because these structures might be useful for a lot of future things like tweening)\n\nThe current Keyframes implementation is used in such a way that a Slice keeps going until a new keyframe (Keyframes::Key) appears. In the future this might change as in your implementation (one keyframe is just \"one shot\", or a continuous thing like continuous layers). I need to think more about it so there is no progress on this one yet.. As a specific recommendation I'll tell you that you should use just two hit boxes:\n\nOne for defending/hit the player\nOther for attack/hit the opponent\n\nAnd you can use two or three in case the attack is a long kick etc.\nIf you start specifing too much boxes it will get too complex (and you might use pixel perfect collision anyway, which is not desired for fight games). Here some examples of the reduced number of boxes.. Hi @winterheart, in which platform is this change needed? (so I can test it)\nI'm aware of some of these underlinking issues with gcc on Linux, but right now should be fixed (at least the compilation should be working). I'm thinking in a more proper change. i.e. adding target_link_libraries to all sub-libraries (she, base, gfx, css, undo, etc.).\n. OK, I'll create a special branch (named link-fixes) with dependencies between all libraries, could you pull it when it's available to test it? I'll comment this PR when I push it.\nThanks for your help!\n. I've just created link-fixes branch. I hope it works. I've tested on Windows and Ubuntu 14.04 32bits. I'll see if it works correctly on Travis and test it on Mac this week.\n. Thanks for your help @winterheart, I've merged the branch to master so I'll close this PR.\n. Hi @guawoo, if you have some log or build output I might give you a hand with this issue.\n. This issue is related to #245 and #175\n. Other gif files to test http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/anim_basics/\n. Hi @KasumiArai! Thanks for reporting this issue. I'm aware to some issues related to the combination between different sprite transparent colors and selection transparent colors (e.g. #546, which maybe it's already fixed). It's good to have this well documented.\n. Hi @TheKK, you can go for it! You can start looking at MovingCelState::onMouseUp\n. Fixed with addddf78a5a59ca385ea0bfccb2e08489cc0419c and 868376380f019cb90fed1db48bc22a0e52712767 (the whole user-data merge)\n. Preview:\n\n. @Nsheppard01 hi there! do you mean the selection in the canvas? e.g. select a rectangle with Marquee tool, select a set of cels in the Timeline, and copy/paste only the selected rectangle of selected cels.\n. Preview:\n\n. I'll review this issue later. About this specific part:\n\ni undo'd to the very beginning of the image since i loaded it, just to see the progress i made, and accidentally painted in the image when changing focus, making it impossible to redo back to the current one.\n\nYou can enable a non-linear history to avoid this kind of problems (Edit > Preferences > Undo > Allow non-linear history checkbox)\nHere a video about how this works in Photoshop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8j5DXUDPys (it's not easy enough to see how it works when you don't have a History panel)\n. Similar feature in #539\n. The history panel is planned but I don't have an issue for that. I've just created it: #739\n. \n. This could be done for regular Rectangle, Line, and Ellipse tools too.\n. Maybe related to #532\n. Hi @Async0x42, a minor known-issue (the progress bar is a slider really). Anyway it's a strange behavior, I'll fix this.\n. Fixed with 77d8024026b28cfbdcdc5adf906387594cd46bb0\n. It's related to #415 and #607 \n. The linked icon was added to avoid linked cels by default and to keep compatibility with v1.0 behavior. There are several commands affected by the icon. For example when a new frame is added (Frame > New Frame), or copying cels (or frames) using drag-and-drop, or \"Copy Cel in Next Frame\".\nIn case we remove the icon, copying cels/frames with drag-and-drop could keep the same link/unlink state of the original cels. But the problematic commands are 'New Frame' and 'Copy Cel in Next Frame'. I'm not quite sure to have these commands available:\n- New Frame\n- New Linked Frame\n- Copy Cel in Next Frame\n- Link Cel in Next Frame\nFor example, without the icon, if we have a static background layer, we lost the functionality to keep it always linked whatever command we use (New Frame or New Linked Frame).\nProbably, you just need a new command (Link Cel in Next Frame) to copy all cels forcing links (ignoring the layer icon).\n. @enol Here a mockup how this new command (Alt+Shift+M?) could work (please make comments about it):\n\nI'm not quite sure how this command should be called (Copy Cel Block? Copy Cel in Next Frame and rename the current one to Link Cel in Next Frame? what about non-continuous/unlink layers when Link Cel in Next Frame is used?).\n@Async0x42 I'll add that option in the popup menu. And see how it works with the other options in the popup too.\n. Let's make a summary about these commands just to avoid confusion and see how they differ:\n- Duplicate Cels (Alt+D)\n  \n- Duplicate Linked Cels (Alt+Shift+D and Alt+M) (it's the old Copy Cel in Next Frame)\n  \n\nis there a need for separate commands? I think ideally, if you have a block range of cells selected and call the command, it should duplicate the range, but if you have a single cell selected, and call the same command, it should duplicate just that cell.\n\nBoth commands works in that way. But they differ in how the copy is made.\n. > A separate command for duplicating LINKED vs unlinked, I totally agree with!\n:+1: :smile: \n. @tony Well, in this issue I was talking about \"rulers\" as draggable \"guides\" really :smile: Maybe these are two different features. Let's use your naming conventions here.\n- I think #789 can be solved with a checkbox/option in Preferences, as rulers could be disabled anyway.\n- Also I'm not 100% sure if guides will replace the purpose of multiple-grids (as they could be easier to configure, would modify \"snap to grid\" behavior, and be modified by \"show grid\" option.)\n. Hi Ben, this bug should be already fixed with 14601dd94fdbf7db63b0db73a2447e88bde5362d,\nwould you like to contact me at support@aseprite.org so I can send you a special beta to try the fix?\nThanks for reporting this issue!\n. Duplicated #275 \nI'll try to fix this today. It's a long standing bug and the most confusing. You can use Shift+V and Shift+H to flip the selection.\n. Related issue #690\n. Actually the \"Remap\" button (in the latest in-development version) does that: It tries to match colors finding which one fit best:\n\nI think the \"Create Palette from Current Sprite\" option (which is only available on RGBA images) could be available for Indexed images too (to create a reduced version of the palette and Remap):\n\nRelated to #563 and #552\n. I'm using LiCEcap, a great little utility.\n. Actually we can add new colors:\n- clicking the warning icon http://imgur.com/g444Ho2\n- or with drag-and-drop http://imgur.com/2eiZceh\nAnd we can delete colors selecting a color (or several colors) and then Edit > Clear (or pressing Delete or Backspace keys).\nAnyway I've asked several times for this, so I'll see if we can have a more intuitive way.\n. \n. This is an extreme situation, I'll review this for v1.1.1. (There are several things that can fail when we lost the data/ directory)\n. I'll try to fix this for the next version.. Really strange bug. Nice catch. I'll take care of this now. Other way to reproduce it:\n1. Create an RGB image and an Indexed image\n2. Drag one tab to a side\n3. Make a selection in one sprite and move it\n4. Middle-click the other sprite to select/scroll it\n5. Select Pencil tool (with B shortcut) and start drawing\nNote for dev: The problem appears when other (visible) editor is in MovingPixelsState.\n. It was really hard to find this bug. Thanks for the report!\n. Other feature (including this one) is that the Select > Color Range option should have the Union/Subtract/Intersect options.\n. Added different selection modes (replace/add/subtract/intersection) to Select > Color Range command:\n\n. > Also, I think that if you reduce colours first, then switch to Indexed, the remap button should show up (if there are colours in the image, that don't exist in the palette)\nWhen a RGB sprite is converted to Indexed the \"remap\" is done automatically with the current palette. So I think there is no need for the \"Remap\" button in that case.\n. Hi, do you mean that you want to define two loops in the same animation? (I think that I don't understand the \"run simultaneously\" and \"at their own frequency\" parts).\nActually you can define two tags (which acts like loops in the Preview window, F7 key):\n\n(anyway two overlapping tags is not something easy to handle right now, I've added this issue #768)\nOther option is to duplicate the first 5 frames in a linked way:\n\n. At the moment that's possible only using linked cels. I think I can mark this issue as duplicated, see #593\n. Using linked cels you can create two layers:\n1. For the windmill animation (this one with cels 1-5 linked to cels 6-10), and\n2. Other layer with the flock animation\n. Hi @KasumiArai, yeah, several things to improve the color bar with an \"auto scroll\".\n. Just a little trick I was using is to resize the palette entries with Ctrl+mouse wheel (above the palette), so we can zoom out, drag-and-drop the handle to resize the palette, and then zoom in again with Ctrl+wheel.\n. This is not fully fixed in v1.1.0.1 (there is no autoscroll), but the drag-and-drop is easier.\n. Hi @Mailaender, I'd prefer to avoid specific proprietary file formats inside Aseprite code, anyway I think that this kind of situations could be solved with a plugin API/SDK (related to #54). So you could have your own .dll to load/save in this SHP format.\nMaybe we can discuss the API here. It should be a SDK with stable ABI (e.g. C functions/structs). Could be this enough for your requirement?\n. Hi @Phrohdoh, yes, all parsers are written in C++ (https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/tree/master/src/app/file). Anyway these parsers use a unstable/internal API (which I'm planning to modify #379).\nI think that we have these possible ways to implement a plugin API:\n- A stable plugin SDK so anyone can compile its own C (or C++) DLL to load/save custom file formats. (portable between Win/Mac/Linux)\n- A COM API (typelib interfaces) so Aseprite can consume COM objects to load/save custom formats (DLLs could be done in C, C++ or C#) (Windows only, or maybe portable with mono, I'm not sure)\n- With a JavaScript API (https://github.com/aseprite/api-draft)\n. Hi @kyrieru, actually you can change the default pivot visibility status/location from this little button/menu: http://imgur.com/d2l7fvp\nAt the moment we cannot put the pivot in some specific place and assign that position as the default one, so I'll leave this issue open for the future.\n. Confirmed, it looks like arrow keys doesn't work when the selection is rotated.\n. This will be the first step to create a library (docio) to encapsulate all the code to load/save files into a specific module.\n. It's a good idea :+1: \n. \n. Sorry, I didn't think about it too well. Maybe in this way:\n\n. Hi @oceanhahn ^_^ I'll take a look at these issues next week. I was hoping to release a new version today but a specific issue (issue 1080) is taking me a lot of time \ud83d\ude2d \n. I'll start working on this one (mainly the focus problem). About the zoom limits, I'm not so sure, as now the mouse wheel acceleration on OS X is fixed in someway it might not be required, but maybe it might be useful for other people/other scenarios.\n. This issue might be more important because in the next version v1.2.9 we will be able to change Alpha/HSL/HSV values with the mouse wheel (and there is no way to customize steps for the mouse wheel). Related to #970 and https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/680#issuecomment-344721509 . Hi @Async0x42, indeed, this was intentional to fix visual artifacts on resizing (32b12d17dabfd49658329b4d6170d80310fc47d5) :smile:\nI will see what I can do to improve the performance when the window is resized.\n. Maybe an option/checkbox in the pivot menu (http://imgur.com/d2l7fvp)\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Also, this problem happens when we \"pin\" a file in the Aseprite's task bar icon and click that file from the Aseprite's task bar menu\n. Fixed\n. I've a personal \"to-do\" item to do this. This is the weirdest widget and maybe the most important one to have tooltips. Also I'd like to change the buttons style. Something like this:\n\n. Fixed\n. Actually there are several things that would be great to automatically configured through a keystroke. For example, brushes can be changed with Alt+1, Alt+2, etc. but I think that we should be able to bind one of these shortcuts (e.g. Alt+1) into a specific set of options.\nFor example:\n- Alt+1 change brush size=1px, ink=simple ink\n- Alt+2 change ink=shading, and selected color range  [3,4,5] indexes.\n  etc.\nThese Alt+1,2,3,4... shortcuts should be configurable using a special UI with options like:\n- Brush: Don't change / Use this: [ OPTIONS ]\n- FG color: Don't change / Use this: [ FG ]\n- BG color: Don't change / Use this: [ BG ]\n- Ink mode, opacity, etc.\n. This might be related to #475, we could assign \"macros\" to keys, so steps would be something like:\n1. Record macro\n2. Select an ink, brush size, or other things/tasks (e.g. switching a specific layer visibility, executing a command, etc.)\n3. Stop the macro-recording\n4. Assign a specific key to that macro\n. Things missing to close this issue:\n1. default shortcuts (we have already the commands that can be customized by the user)\n2. \"quick peek\" modifier to change the ink type temporally when the key/modifier is pressed\nI'm not sure about default shortcuts to change the ink type. The preferred way to switch between brushes/ink types will be Alt+1, Alt+2, etc. which should be implemented soon (see #904).\nAlso, the \"quick peek\" behavior is a little complex to be implemented for v1.1, I think it should be separated to other issue.\n. I'll move this for v1.2 as I think after #904 this feature will not be required anymore.\n. This is a good idea. Anyway I'd like to avoid confusion when the user creates a new image so we have to be careful here.\nFor example, if I create a 8x8 image and see the huge canvas, I could think that I missed the width x height numbers. In other words, it must be really clear that I'm seeing a 8x8 pixels and not something bigger. Some solution for this problem, could be to show the tiny image and auto-zoom-in it with some kind of animation.\n. Implemented in #1028 \n. Related to #861 in some way\n. More discussion in #1105\n. This problem happens in transparent layers of RGB images only.\n. Hi @sirblackheart, don't worry about travis. The PR looks good so far. I'll make some comments and test it soon.\n. I got the following warnings on VC 2013:\nwebp_format.cpp(128) : warning C4800: 'int' : forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)\nwebp_format.cpp(320) : warning C4244: 'argument' : conversion from 'float' to 'int', possible loss of data\nwebp_format.cpp(320) : warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'int' to 'float', possible loss of data\nwebp_format.cpp(328) : warning C4800: 'int' : forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)\nwebp_format.cpp(330) : warning C4244: 'argument' : conversion from 'float' to 'int', possible loss of data\nwebp_format.cpp(338) : warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'int' to 'float', possible loss of data\nwebp_format.cpp(344) : warning C4244: 'argument' : conversion from 'float' to 'int', possible loss of data\nAbout other issue, I'm not an huge fan of auto keyword. I've used it for iterators mainly. Here I think we can use Image* and long in their respective cases.\n. Looks great :+1: Thanks for your effort Gabriel! I will merge it. Do you think we should close #273?\n. Thanks for the patch @sirblackheart, I'll take a look in these days. (Just a comment, should we use Windows or Win text in the key string?)\n. Meanwhile (just a rant) I wonder why Window Manager developers (GNOME, KDE, Xfce, fluxbox, IceWM, etc) don't change the default modifier to the Win key instead of the Alt key. I see this as the most incompatible thing with PC/Windows programs (and even with OS X apps too). Almost all graphics programs that I know use Alt modifier.\nIndeed, the Win key is just perfect for this case. E.g. Win key+mouse drag: resizes the window.\nWin key = everything related to the window manager.\nAnyway, I think that some day the world will be better. When text files with CRLF and tabs don't exist anymore, and window managers don't grab the Alt modifier.\nPossible solution\n\n(that should be provided by window manager developers)\n\nThere should be a library to get the state of the Alt modifier on each window manager, so we can know if the Alt key is used by the WM or not. If it is we could give alternative keyboard shortcuts.\nOr a better (and straightforward) solution would be: WMs should do the same that major OS vendors do: Just leave the Alt key for apps.\n/endofrant (sorry)\n. I'm not used to the Super denomination (mainly because I've never customized a WM and I almost do console work on Linux). I find quite interesting that there is a Ubuntu page talking about What is the \"Super\" key?\nYou people know better than me, should we call this Win or Super on Linux?\n. > I think if you start to do any key mapping on linux you probably have to learn/know what the super key is.\nCompletely agree on this one. I've a little idea. I'll merge the PR and then add tooltip to the \"Super\" checkbox.\n. As a side note: I have a private branch with some changes for the whole keyboard behavior (e.g. to fix AltGr+[ in Spanish keyboard and several keystrokes combinations). But it needs more work and testing on the three platforms (Win, OSX, Linux). Also I'm waiting to discard the Allegro back-end to continue that branch.\n. Yesterday I've started working on the branch to fix all keyboard issues with international keyboard (e.g. altgr+[), etc. Coming soon in v1.1.10.\n. See #454 \n. @sirblackheart do you know why this could happen?\n. Thanks @sirblackheart for the help!\n. I've added a flag to disable webp format by default until the libwebp code is updated to the patched version.\n. :+1: ok, after the new release of webp we can update the submodule and enable webp by default\n. I was contacted for the same bug. A temporal solution is converting the layer to Background (Edit > Background from Layer... as you said ^_^)\n. Thanks @green-big-frog\n. This is strange, I'm running v1.0.9 on Windows 10, 64-bit.\nCould you send me your configuration file? http://imgur.com/PRZ4AaZ\n. Probably related to a broken internal state in the driver or Windows. Re-starting Windows should fix the problem.\n. Hi there! Also if @ImbaKnugel could include/upload the complete output/log of the compilation process that would be great. Something like:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite\nmkdir aseprite/build && cd aseprite/build\ncmake .. && make > compilation-log.txt\n. (needs more info)\n. I think by default Aseprite should ignore hidden layers, so I think I'll add a --show-all-layers flag to export everything.\n. I think the --list-tags option already fixed this issue.. This must be reviewed with the new back-end for v1.2 #139 \n. This should be fixed in v1.1.9 with 2d2fb0038afe8e57280aff21d5f65ddce10c2e2e\n. That's right, I'll try to fix it right away.\n. Looks good @Fojar, thanks!\n. Hi @noxoc, you should be able to see the first frame when you are in the last one if you activate a loop section (e.g. select all frames and press F2 key or View > Set Loop Section). It's available since v1.1.\nRelated to issue #555\n. Hi there, I think 1bb0bca361b8eed4350df9ee8ec544a2eb8e4bd9 should fix this problem.\n. I'll see what we can do with this issue (maybe for v1.1.2). It should support any N number of angles.\n. Related to #59, #77 and #377 \n. Hi @kles4enko, at the moment is not high priority, but I would love to create a RPM package.\nIn these days I'm working on #139 because I've to fix Linux mouse performance issues before, and other OS X problems (e.g. adding better support for trackpad).\n. Hi @sirblackheart, don't worry about it. It's more like a internal thing I've to do (integrated with my build scripts and vagrant). I don't remember why I didn't use CPack at the moment, but anyway the build process is quite complex/customized (e.g. it needs code signing, and on Windows special Inno Setup scripts). So I prefer to have full control of the package.\n. I think this shouldn't happen anymore because we're using a patched freetype2 version\n. Hi @oceanhahn! Flood fill should work as previous Aseprite versions by default (with Contiguous option checked). Are you working with one layer or multiple layers? The edge detection works only for the current layer (detecting edges in the current layer). If you are working with one layer, it's probable that you've found a bug.\n. Thanks for the great explanation! The selection should act like another edge for the flood fill. (I've checked Photoshop just out of curiosity and it works correctly :smile: )\n. Ctrl+Shift+C is Save Copy As on Aseprite, I'm not sure if we should change the shortcut to other thing and make Ctrl+Shift+C execute this Copy Merged action. What do you think people?\n. A possibility:\n- Ctrl+Shift+A: It's File > Save Copy As\n- Ctrl+Shift+C: The new Edit > Copy Merged\n. It might be Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S\n. I suppose Save Copy As is used quite often to export an .ase image as a .gif file (and e.g. with a automatic 200% resize)\n. Actually there is already Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K to change keyboard shortcuts, and it looks like Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S is even easier to press in the keyboard.\n. Hi @grisevg, actually I'm not sure what would be the final solution to this problem. It is related to the Visual Studio project which cmake generates (for NMake or Ninja makefiles it should work correctly). I'll try to update the libcurl code to finally fix this issue (reported in #606, #608, and #788).\n. Confirmed, thanks to report it @numanair :+1: \n. Next version will include a scrollbar (I'll try to release it this week). Anyway I'm working on this issue: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/139#issuecomment-145249486 to add trackpad support\n. :smile: thanks for your kind words in these days I'll start working on a possible port to iPad, but I need to rethink the user experience a little for touch devices\n. :smile_cat: \n. Hi @ryleigh, I'm giving a try here and it's working, it might be possible that the program is crashing when it's being closed. Could you please check if other settings are saved? You could see the settings in $HOME/.config/aseprite/aseprite.inifile (Edit > Preferences > Locate Configuration File).\nThe default settings for background in the aseprite.ini looks like this:\n[bg]\ntype = 0\nzoom = true\ncolor1 = rgb{128,128,128,255}\ncolor2 = rgb{192,192,192,255}\n. Could you please check if selecting RGB or HSV color does work? I think there is a problem saving/loading gray colors.\n. Hi @x421, does your sprite have a Background layer? is 'blue' the current background color? could you please send me the .ase file to support@aseprite.org?\n. Thanks for the file @x421, I've just saw that you are using an Indexed image. If you convert it to RGBA (Sprite > Color Mode > RGB Color) before you export the sprite, it should work. Actually layers with blending modes + transparent opacity are not exported correctly if the sprite is Indexed. So I recommend you that if you want to use blend modes, you keep using RGBA sprites.\n. I'll leave this issue open to add an automatic conversion from Indexed to RGBA when we export an Indexed image with blending modes. A dialog should be shown with these options:\nThe indexed sprite is using blending modes, what do you want to do?\n* Export as RGBA\n* Export with a new special palette\n. Requested here too: https://community.aseprite.org/t/feature-request-another-export-option-color-mode/2781. Hi @Ashedragon, it looks like pthread library is not found. I think that your-cmake-build-dir/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log file should contain the exact C program that is failing. Could you please attach the file to this issue?\n. More info needed.\n. Hi @madgarden, using Alt modifier the selection should conform to snap to grid. Anyway I don't know if this should be the default behavior.\n. @elvisish I'm not working on this at the moment, but I might give some priority to this (I'd love to see thumbnails on Windows File Explorer and macOS Finder too). I'm working on this one for Windows as first step (I already have something working in my local copy). It needs some cleanup and will upload the changes soon.. I've just released a little beta to get thumbnails on Windows Explorer (this should be included with Aseprite in a near future version):\nhttps://www.aseprite.org/thumbnails/\nCommit: 1898ce2886415e310d4e0177fa6104c4a026eb00. I don't know SageThumb. It might have some kind of conflict because Photoshop use .ase as one of their file format. Try renaming to .aseprite and see if the thumbnail appears or restart windows just in case then.. @elvisish can you uninstall sagethumbs temporally and try my extension to check if it works? In other case, try using the .aseprite extension in your files instead of .ase . Hi @GymbylCoding, it's a tricky issue but maybe when #139 is done it will be possible to improve the preview process (e.g. with OpenGL acceleration).\n. Maybe related to #175 \n. Added #849 about the search field in shortcut window\n. @cheeaun you can drag-and-drop layers (there is no shortcut but it's possible to move layers): http://www.aseprite.org/docs/move-layers/\n. @cheeaun you're welcome! :smile:\n. Hi @Fojar, a PR would be great as I didn't see this issue yet.\n. Hi! Actually \"Insert Text\" copies the text into the clipboard and then uses the same \"Paste\" behaviour. I'll try to fix this because as you noticed, it's not expected to the user to lost its previous clipboard content.\n. Hi @Nsheppard01, at the moment this is not possible. There is an issue which includes something similar: #593 (in #767 something similar was requested)\n. Hi @Fojar, I'll make some comments in the commits. (I haven't tested it yet.)\n. Could you squash both commits (and maybe the extra change) in just one commit?\n. As a side note, after I merge this PR, I'd love to change the random number generator with some of the new standard generators (e.g. Mersenne Twister). But that is something I'll add after this PR.\n. (Other note, don't worry about the Travis failed check, it was my fail with the freetype2 repository. It should be fixed now.)\n. >  I'll have to make a new PR for that, correct?\nNot really, you can use git push --force to overwrite your old commits in your branch.\n. :+1: :smile: \n. Thanks again @Fojar! I've tested/compiled on Win/OSX/Linux and it works!\n. Hi @oceanhahn, I think you are looking for something like #787\nAnyway you add the possibility to select different inks with modifiers like Control or Shift.\n. Hi @oceanhahn, this is the list of planned tasks to be done for the next release v1.1.1 to avoid delaying it even more (there are important fixes that I'd like to release ASAP).\nThe idea is to release v1.1.1 this week, if I've time to fix more issues (like #823) I'll try it, in other case it will be for v1.1.2 (Actually v1.1 serie is already quite big, it contains features from v1.3, so I think I'll move all new features to v1.2 and keep bug fixes on v1.1 series to release fixes sooner.)\n. Hi @JoEschner, the tags information can be exported using --data and --list-tags options from the command line. I'll add the option in the UI (File > Export Sprite Sheet) in v1.1.2.\n. @JoEschner You can use --filename-format to change the way naming is formatted in the JSON output.\n. Dup #127 \n. Hi @blackmiaool, it's not possible at the moment but that would be a nice project. Some time ago I was thinking about the possibility to create a C++ library to load .ase files, and compile it with emscripten to see how it works on JS.\n. Actually you can convert .ase files to .gif using the command line:\naseprite.exe --batch myfile.ase --save-as myfile.gif\n(more)\n. In that case you need a lot of Aseprite code. The .gif encode/decode process is so complex that I'd like to write a blog post about it later. On the other hand, .ase files can contain several layers, and you have to composite those layers with different blending modes and opacities (and using the sprite color palette, or a optimized color palette). Almost the whole render process must be reproduced.\n. (It's related to #379)\n. Related to #244, #415, #607, #645 \n. Fixed\n. Thanks!\n. It's not a bug, but also not something desirable. When the \"Remap\" button appears the palette area is smaller, so the scrollbar is needed. A possible solution could be changing the \"Remap\" button position.\n. I though about it when I was testing the symmetry tool, and I decided to wait some user feedback while I see how to create the UI for this even/odd symmetry switching. This should be included in the next version.\n. I'm thinking that the symmetry rule might snap at the start of each pixel and in the middle of each pixel. The problem with this is that to create the \"odd number\" symmetry you have to zoom in.\n. Related to #85 item, X key should reverse the gradient.\n. At the moment one alternative (on Windows) is to use the Native file selector. You can enable it from Edit > Preferences > Experimental > Use native file dialog.\n. Hi @TeddyDD, just in case, the error says that you need package harfbuzz-icu with version >= 0.9.18. Could you check your libharfbuzz-icu0 package version?\n. There will not be a default shortcut at the moment, but it'll be configurable: \n\n. Fixed\n. I'll add a check/way to revert/reset the UI scaling if it's too small to see the whole settings dialog. Also this problem is related with other one: If the main window is too small (or the scale is too big), the context bar could be to narrow to show all options. We need an adaptative/responsive layout for UI controls.\n. Yes, I wasn't able to reproduce this bug yet. The only thing I can think of is that as the UI Scaling doesn't change until we restart the program, if we modify its value and then we forgot about it, restarting the program will show the new UI Scaling factor. So it can be confusing. But as you said, it's highly probable that the value is changed automatically by some problem in the code.\n. Hi @desult, in v1.1.8 or v1.2-beta2, you should see a red flag at the top-right corner to reset the UI screen scaling settings. Anyway, if you don't see it, you can reset the preferences with this method:  http://www.aseprite.org/docs/reset-preferences/\n. Hi @TheKK, I think the symmetry line shouldn't be visible in the preview. I'm pushing a fix for #851 in a second. Anyway I'll review this patch because it can be useful in other way.\n. It should be fixed with #1082\n. Hi @Mailaender, please check that this commit doesn't pass the Travis CI build https://travis-ci.org/aseprite/aseprite/builds/91203332\n. This should be fixed with #1035\n. Thanks @jpnk for the contribution!\n. Hi @sanvishal, are you using the official version v1.1.1?\n. Contact us at support@aseprite.org in case you are getting this problem with the official version v1.1.1. If it's your own compilation, you can share with us the compilation log.\n. First result on Google says that it could be related to a virus: https://www.reddit.com/r/TPPcrack/comments/3k86cl/error_idcodecvtddhstd2volocale2a_not_found_in_dll/\n. Did it work before? The first thing I thought about is the a C runtime.\n. I think you should contact the person who compiled it. He/she might help you with this issue. Anyway it's highly probable that it's related to a missing runtime dll (e.g. MSVCP110.dll)\n. Hi @bfod, thanks for your kind words.\nAbout the feature, I think it could be really confusing a brush that draw in several frames at the same time. Anyway I think that you are looking for something like #593, or #767 \n. Hmm now that make sense :smile: And it might be not as hard as I thought to implement.\n. Related to an task item in #85, we should be able to drag-and-drop colors in the shading field. (Also it should be a combobox, so we have an history of used shades.)\n. Implemented in 0f8997b3df1572a2e6bd6ea17ad35e949c3d9567\n. Hi @TheKK, the problem is still present in master branch. Symmetry handles are not visible when the sprite is bigger than the viewport (e.g. you zoom in). A possible solution as @jpnk said is to keep symmetry handles in the viewport boundaries. (It shouldn't be so hard to fix this issue modifying StandbyState::Decorator::getSymmetryHandles.)\n. @TheKK the issue is tricky. I was testing and the problem is that symmetry handles move along the scroll (their position changes when the scroll changes). It's a situation that isn't found in other Editor's states. I was trying to fix this problem but I'll need more time.\n. @TheKK now you can create a PR to fix this issue, the commit 562106c6f0263468d6a427a7b2a614145c61cb2b fix the scroll issue\n. It's a known issue but too risky to fix it on v1.1 (it needs a special behavior to do this)\n. Hi @ArekX, I've decided to add a simple symmetry mode for the first iteration (v1.1.1). But in the future we could have other kind of symmetries (even multiple symmetries at the same time).\n. The first item is #1011\n. I thought the same thing (as the brush size already has a px suffix) but then forgot to implement :sweat_smile: \n. A \"little\" problem, as by default the Width field is focused, the prefix is not being shown:\n\nMaybe the px suffix should be right-aligned and always-visible.\n. I left the px suffix in the same position but it's always visible. Anyway I'm not 100% sure about this change.\n. Hi @ryleigh, you should be able to specify image_1.png as filename and it will start from 1.\n. Hi @oceanhahn, thanks for bring this back. I've just tested and it's quite annoying, I'll try to fix this for the next v1.1 version.\n. Hi @Chilaquiles, sorry, I didn't understand what the specific problem is in this case. Could you please give me a list of steps to reproduce it?  :sweat_smile: \n. Dup #556\n. @lazcht sorry but I'm not sure if I understood the GIF \ud83d\ude05 Are you using , and . keys to move through frames? or the arrow keys? See that there is a difference between arrow keys (that do not loop the tag) and , and . keys that they do loop inside the tag:\n\n. Dup #138 \n. Hi! As @KasumiArai said, you can drag the selection border to drag layers and frames: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/move-layers/\nAnyway I suppose that it's quite hard to drag the borders when you are using your finger/a touch device.\n. @robochase6000 yeah, you're right, I'll add a link in Layers page to Move Layers\n. Unify with #1252 . > The only thing which not very clear to me is the behaviour of item 6. What should moving tool do when auto-select-layer is on and we have multiple cels selected?\nI think that in this case the new layer/cel should be selected, and the previous Timeline selection should be disabled (so we move only one cel). Anyway there are three different cases:\nWhat happen if we have auto-select and:\n6.1. we move the current cel which is inside the Timeline selection range\n6.2. we move other cel that is inside the Timeline selection range\n6.3. we autoselect/move a cel that is outside the Timeline selection range\nFor 6.3 I think what I said: we should disable the Timeline selection and move only the new auto-selected cel. Anyway 6.1 and 6.2 are trickier.\nI'll test this PR and see how it works. We can solve these extra issues later.\n. At the moment we can use both ways. Transaction::execute is preferred, but if you find convenient to use some DocumentApi member function, you can use it.\nIn a future the DocumentApi should be completely replaced with other Cmds.\n. Dup #477. I moved this feature from v1.2 to v1.1.\n. I'm not sure about this solution. Should we add new commands or a user-defined configuration flag to modify GotoPreviousFrame/GotoNextFrame behavior?\n. > I just found that we can pass parameters to commands :P \n:smile: Anyway in this case I'm not talking about command parameters.\nI'm talking about a preference option in pref.xml that you can check using Preference::instance() and that can be changed from OptionsWindow (options.xml)\nThe UndoCommand is a good example about one command which its behavior changes with a user-defined option.\n. > I think during working I'll need both goto next frame and goto next frame with same tag\nYou are right. Also it was my original idea in #556 :smile: I'll merge this PR, it looks fine as it is (don't worry about command params).\nThanks for your help! :wink: \n. I'll fix it. Don't worry.\n. Thanks @tony! I'll merge this PR, in case you want to contribute some other bigger patch, take a look at our CLA\n. Hi @TheKK, this is a nice catch. Anyway Widget::invalidate doesn't repaint the widget, it only indicates that the whole widget must be repainted when the message loop is processed in the future. (Anyway this line could be the more CPU intensive, I'll profile it.)\n. Thanks @TheKK!\n. Thanks @tony, I'll merge this PR, I'm not sure about the C key, I might change it later (to something like Shift+C or Space+C)\n. Yeah, now it looks better :smile: Thanks for the patch!\n. The new item for --filename-format is {tagframe}\n. Nice fix. I didn't notice it on Windows, it surely depends on the specific C runtime implementation. Thanks again @TheKK!\n. I'm used to create the build directory outside the source code. But I think this is a good idea for regular users that follow the INSTALL.md guide. Thanks again @tony!\n. Hi @bfloch. The frame tags is a new feature from v1.1-beta1 and we're adding missing parts to the CLI progressively (the UI is priority).\n1. To export merged layers it should be: -b player.ase --filename-format \"{path}/{title}_{tag}.{extension}\" --save-as player.png\n2. To export split layers it should be: -b --split-layers player.ase --filename-format \"{path}/{title}_{layer}_{tag}_{frame001}.{extension}\" --save-as player.png\nBoth commands have issues:\n1. {frame} is the global frame, not local to the tag, #894 indicates that we need this new \"local frame\" or \"tag frame\" (e.g. {tagframe})\n2. --split-layers is removing tags in some way (so instead of _{tag}_ we get __)\nI'll fix these issues ASAP and there will be a v1.1.2 this week.\nNote: About redesigning the CLI, I'm not sure that would be a good idea, at least backward compatibility must be kept, and having two CLIs is not something I'd love to see. I've create this issue in case someone want to help with a better CLI.\n. @hepari actually it's not possible, but I'd like to add this soon (maybe in v1.1.5.5), keep in touch\n. I was working on this issue, but the change is so big that I'd prefer to include this in the v1.2 beta branch. I'll try to make it available on Steam beta branch maybe next week (or a couple of weeks with other new features). Keep in touch.\n. This will be available in v1.2-beta1.\n. I have been there :smile:\nSometime back I tried to get rid of aseprite.log file when -v is not specified (I remember creating AppOptions class before App for that purpose, and log argument in ResourceFinder). I don't know why I abandoned the task. I'll dedicate some minutes to see what can be done. (Maybe we can merge app::CoreModules and app::Modules.)\n. I don't remember exactly why I split Modules into CoreModules\n. I've push a new branch logger-as-first-module, if you want to take a look.\n. > I believe CoreModules makes dependency relation more clear, at least to me. Otherwise it would be hard to find out which module should be created first without digging into lots of codes.\nActually CoreModules is a private class/member of App instance. So it has the same scope as Modules. Basically CoreModules and Modules looks the same to me.\nAbout the order of initialization of modules, it's given by the order of members in Modules class, which I think it's better than having modules distributed in two classes.\n\nIs this your original idea about creating CoreModuls?\n\nI think that I remember why I've created CoreModules in the first place. The key is in the App::preferences() member. When we call the Modules constructor (m_modules = new Modules) it's probable that some module will look at the Preferences singleton (App::instance()->preferences()), and as m_modules = ... is not yet executed (because we're processing the right-hand side of the statement, the new Modules) we don't have a valid m_modules member yet (so it's nullptr until all modules are constructed).\n\nAnd do you think keeping CoreModules would be a good idea?\n\nI'm not sure if it's longer necessary. Tomorrow I'll debug some code to see who needs the Preferences instance in Modules initialization. And if it's better to handle this in other way (e.g. without using singletons on initialization as first step.)\n. Thanks for the patch @TheKK!\n. Anyway remember that #126 will be the preferred way in the future to export sprites. (And the CLI could be something much simpler like aseprite --batch mygame.aseproject)\n. With a project, we should be able to see the list of sprites in our project folder(s), right click one file/sprite, add specific export actions for that file (save as/export sprite sheet), and the export should be added to a \"list of tasks.\" Finally, this \"list of tasks\" could be processed with one \"compile/run\" button in the UI, or via --batch projectname. Note: It should work like make comparing modified file dates, and we might have a --force option to regenerate everything.\n. Next version will have this issue fixed.. It looks like it's fixed. But I don't remember when I fixed it :sweat_smile: \n. I'll close this issue as I wasn't able to reproduce it anymore.\n. Hi @kyrieru, you can use ~~Edit~~ Select > Reselect menu to show the selection again (Ctrl+Shift+D shortcut). I know it isn't optimal to delete the same area in several frames, but it a good option.\n. > It's select > reselect, btw\nOh yeah, sorry :sweat_smile: \n. I think the current behavior is more MS Paint-like, and the persistent selection is more Photoshop-like. Maybe an option in Preferences to change this behavior would be enough.\n. Hi @Ivoah, could you try to install harfbuzz-icu package?\nE.g.\nbrew install harfbuzz-icu\n. Hi @Ivoah, did you try with brew install harfbuzz?\nIt's strange because I didn't installed it, but maybe I've it installed for some reason.\n. It's a problem in freetype2's CMakeLists.txt, I'll update the submodule in a moment. \n(Note: I can compile Aseprite because I don't have harfbuzz library installed in the first place.)\n. Remember to execute\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nAfter you pull the new changes. And please @Ivoah confirm me if this does fix the compilation problem.\n. @Ivoah it looks like you miss -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=i386 parameter when cmake was invoked. Could you please try these parameters?\n-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=i386\n-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:STRING=10.4\n-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT:STRING=/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk\n. @Ivoah now I think it's other problem. I'll see if there is a way to disable harfbuzz\n. @Ivoah try using -DWITH_HarfBuzz=OFF when you call cmake (which is a new flag introduced in freetype2)\n. :+1: I'm glad it worked :smile: \n. > Slightly off-topic, but how would I package it into an app, so I can run it in half res mode?\nI don't know if fully understand what you are looking for, but you can use the .app bundle in the trial and replace the aseprite executable with your version.\n. :+1:\n. Hi @TheKK, a long time ago I thought about this feature and I knew that something could not work correctly with this Apply button. Right now I cannot remember what exactly. Anyway I'll be testing this soon so we can merge/close the PR.\n. Thanks @Bobhostern for reporting this issue!\n. In someway related to https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1024#issuecomment-200535172\n. I'll add this today in v1.2.2 (but the when the tab bar is \"full\" part will be for other version). @oceanhahn it was a long wait, today you have this feature in v1.2.2 \ud83d\udc74 \ud83d\ude04 . Don't worry. I'm going to review this issue for v1.1.2 next week.\n. Hi @GeertJohan, could you please check if this is fixed? I'm compiling master in a virtual machine and it doesn't look fixed :sweat_smile: \n. @GeertJohan I think that you might have \"Edit > Preferences > Experimental > Use native mouse cursor\" enabled and that's why you don't see the software cursor below the hardware one.\n. This bug can be fixed installing libxcursor-dev in your system. I'll make a note in INSTALL.md that this dependency is necessary to avoid this issue.\n. Something like #853?\n. :+1: \n. Related to #768\n. I was thinking about this issue, and I came with this possible solution:\n- Moving the mouse over the tags they should expand and you can click one tag from the list to make it active/current\n- Right-clicking a tag should popup a menu with options like Properties / Remove / etc\n\n. @Tranberry yesterday I was seeing the animation again and thought \"this should not work in this way\": the tag that is being focused by the mouse should stay in the same place, and a popup with the other tags should appear above. I'll create another mockup soon.\n. I'm working on this issue, here some screenshots:\n\n\nI think the @oceanhahn idea about collapse/expand the view might be useful (e.g. to hide all overlapped text labels). @oceanhahn yeah, I'm trying to color the brackets too (some difficulties here). @oceanhahn I can use the she::Surface::drawColoredRgbaSurface function to draw a \"theme/skin part\" with a specific color (black is converted to the color, and alpha channel is kept), the UI uses RGBA (not indexed color). There are two implementations of drawColoredRgbaSurface:\n A generic (slow) one: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/47f3d540b7a2d961cd13193f4ad2019739adbb86/src/she/common/generic_surface.h#L58\n And the Skia one with a color filter: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/27bc151a37d083b5e608d3eddc2f2aaca43d92c2/src/she/skia/skia_surface.h#L430. \n. @oceanhahn there will not be v1.1.x versions because the code was too different to the beta version \ud83d\ude1e   the next version will be v1.2-beta8 (available through Humble Bundle, Gumroad and itch.io too). I think so, anyway after v1.2-beta8 I'd like to fix as many bugs as possible to make v1.2 stable ASAP.. In the community: https://community.aseprite.org/t/298. I think you are looking for Duplicate Linked Cel(s). Anyway I have to admit that Duplicated Cel(s) and Duplicated Linked Cel(s) are really confusing. Something I have to think about it.. Hi @paulmuad-dib, sorry for the late response in this issue. Are you using the command line to export files? Do you mean something like --filename-format?\n. I'll see if this fixes #978 \n. Thanks for this @TheKK, I'm just rewriting the \"active tool\" logic and I'm just testing the context bar so I've just merged your change.\n. Related to #172 \n. For Linux clipboard support see #1100\n. It should be fixed with #139 \n. Hi @HawkenKing, would you like to contact me at support@aseprite.org about this issue.\n. It should already fixed with the new Skia back-end.\n. @Segmented hi! could you please check if using the Simple Crosshair in preferences does it help?\n\n. I think this bug should be already fixed.\n. Hi @iUltimateLP, are you using the master branch version or the latest official one (v1.1.1)? I'll push a fix right now on master branch in case you can test it. (I'm working in some modifications in the scrolling code so it's unstable at the moment, e.g. the whole sprite editor is redrawn when we scroll.)\n. It's a problem in freetype2's CMakeLists.txt, I'll update the submodule in a moment. \nI know I can compile Aseprite because I don't have harfbuzz library installed.\nDup #909\n. Remember to execute\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nAfter you pull the new changes.\n. You need a DirectX SDK or Windows SDK 8.1 with dxguid.lib. I have the DXGUID_LIBRARY variable with this value on CMakeCache.txt:\nDXGUID_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/8.1/Lib/winv6.3/um/x86/dxguid.lib\nI'm not sure but I think VS2013 should include this SDK. Please find dxguid.lib in your file system and see if you can configure the path manually in your G:\\dev\\cpp\\Editors\\Aseprite\\aseprite\\build\\CMakeCache.txt file.\n. But does C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/8.1/Lib/winv6.3/um/x86/dxguid.lib exist in your file system?\n. Hi @bantonioch, that's not common. When it reaches that point a little C program is compiled to know the CPU endianness. I think you might try to see the cmake logs in the build directory to know what it's doing. I'll install cmake 3.5 just in case this is a new issue with cmake.\n. Maybe related to #707 \n. I guess there are two opportunities for \"to a SVG\" conversion:\n\nExport pixels like squares (easy to be done)\nCreate a vectorized version of the image (using an image tracing algorithm)\n. @markthewolf90 if you want, you can share an example of png -> expected svg output and I'll try to do something about this.. @its-kyle-yo I'm not working on this one, but I'll try to add something for v1.2.10.. Hi @3rr3s3v3n \n\n\nthe install procedure fails\n\nDo you have some kind of log or screenshot about this problem? Did you find the MacOSX10.4.Universal.pkg file?\n. @3rr3s3v3n as @tony said, you can find MacOSX10.4.Universal.pkg inside \"Xcode 3.1 Developer Tools\" as it's described in INSTALL.md\n\nwhy use 10.4 SDK\n\nBecause Allegro 4 needs 10.4 to be compiled. Future versions (1.2) will use the latest SDK.\n. This should be fixed in v1.2.10-beta2 which includes color management: https://community.aseprite.org/t/aseprite-v1-2-10-beta2/2171 . Hi @Secretmapper, I think what you are looking for is the Resize field inside File > Save Copy As menu option. Please confirm if this is enough (and then we close this issue).\nOther option is to export automatically from a .bat file.\n. You're welcome!\nAnd +1 for a scale factor in Export Sprite Sheet (it will be implemented in #493)\n. Hi @pk-nb, the Allegro 4 backend (e.g. the system.m file you linked) is deprecated. v1.1 series will be the latest ones with this backend. From v1.2 we will use the Skia backend (which is already working in some ways). You can find a better trackpad support on that branch. And some code to receive NSEvents and convert them to she::Events is inside OSXView. That is the code that we'll maintain/improve from now on.\nAnyway there are no instructions on yet to compile the Skia port correctly, but you should use the USE_SKIA_BACKEND=ON and USE_ALLEG4_BACKEND=OFF, and point the SKIA_DIR variable to a correctly compiled version of Skia library (branch m48 if I remember correctly).\n. This issue was fixed in #438 with f5c43267fca6770611b842d97410e5baadcda8be for some widgets. But the sprite editor doesn't interpret the Ctrl+click as right-click (because Ctrl is already a modifier to change to the Hand tool).\n. Already added. It will be available in v1.1.2 (5dc149d30834c417280f4285136cc67bb0ebbed6) :wink: \n. \n. This is the third time that I'm contacted about this issue and the Skia port (#139) fixes it. I'll be testing the Skia port for OS X. It might be ready for v1.1.2 instead of v1.2.\n. Contact me at support@aseprite.org\n. It's fixed with the new backend #139\n. Internal note: This issue will need some redesign of the \"ink processing\" classes. We need a mix between the BrushInkProcessing and other inks (e.g. the TransparentInkProcessing or ShadingInkProcessing). It's like the BrushInkProcessing should act as a source of colors for the other inks. So by default we have a \"solid color\" source (the foreground color) for other inks, and with a custom brush we have a \"multiple color source\".\n. Hi @not-surt, the cursor should disappear when the mouse leaves the window, it should work on Windows and OS X, but I think there are some special cases where the cursor isn't hidden. Are you on Linux?\n. Does it happen when you just move the mouse and the Aseprite window is active? Or are there other situations? E.g. when you press Alt+key to change to other window, or you move the mouse over Aseprite window and it isn't the active window, etc.\n. Also, could you please tell me what window managers still have this problem now? I'm testing on Ubuntu 14.04 (compiz), and it looks to work just fine.\n. I'll push a fix for this issue in a moment.\n. I'll leave this for #139 \n. As with other platforms, we don't distribute installation scripts (e.g. windows installer, OS X bundle, etc.) Anyway these can be obtained from the trial versions.\n. I though about it. I'm not sure if all settings should be sync or if there should be a list of groups to be synced (e.g. maybe we don't want to sync the \"zoom with mouse wheel\" because we use the trackpad on OS X, and a mouse on a PC desktop)\n. No, it's the same setting. Maybe I should see if I can differentiate a mouse wheel event (apple magic touch event) from the trackpad touch.\n. Nice catch :+1: \n. It's a related issue. I'll push a fix now and release a beta on Steam today. Thanks for your help! :wink: \n. Hi @Async0x42, actually the old cog icon was a little confusing (the icon area is too small to draw a cog). I'm not 100% sure about the new eye icon, so I'm open to new ideas.\n. I like it, I prefer the first one.\n. Hi there! This issue might be solved when #139 is finished. Not for v1.1.2, but maybe in a v1.1.3 or v1.2 (the v1.1 branch got a lot of new issues anyway, I think I'll jump to v1.2 soon anyway.)\nThis is in someway strange because I cannot reproduce the lag. Anyway I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 on virtual machine (I don't know if that should be better or worse).\n. Thanks for the info @LiquidityC \nI'll close this issue but it might be re-opened in the future if someone else confirm that the bug still persists.\n. Hi @GizmoCodes, could you please create another issue specific to Fedora with a video about how slow it is running? Also it would be great to know if you've compiled Aseprite with debug flags or release flags, and what specific commit you are using\n. P.S. I forgot, please @GizmoCodes read our code of conduct\n. Hi @pennaverde, it's already planned in #250, but it needs #139 first (which is a work-in-progress) to support multiple windows on the screen. It's something I'd love to have soon.\n. Hi there! I've noticed the same problem. It's highly probable that it was introduced in the new-scroll branch merge e985227d954565c2b9094d3d1ea8121661b07352\n. Internal note: the problem is visible only on widgets inside a ui::Viewport that contains sub-children. E.g. it's in all ui::ListBoxes: palettes, recent files/folders, news, keyboard shortcuts, etc. The problem isn't present in the sprite editor and files list because they are just one big widget (they don't have sub-children).\n. Thanks @KasumiArai for reporting this problem. I'll try to fix it right now.\n. Hi @KasumiArai! In this case, I'm not sure what it should be done. Let's see:\n1. When we rotate the selection, the editor changes to a \"moving selection\" state (see how the context/top bar changes to another state, where a :white_check_mark: and :negative_squared_cross_mark: )\n2. The selection can be now moved, and the flip actions changes this \"floating selection\" (which is rotated).\nThe problem here is that if we grab the selection, rotate it, and drop it, then when you flip it, the new selection will take the whole content of the area. Here is an example of the possible new behavior:\n\nI think a possible solution would be to rotate the selection first, copy the rotated content as the original image, so the rotated content start with an angle = 0\u00ba. In this case flipping the area will work as expected. (Anyway if we rotate the selection using the mouse, and then we use flip commands, they will work just as they are working now.)\n. Hi @DaanHaaz, I'm thinking to add a confirmation dialog before we save a sequence of images. Something like: Do you really want to save the following files: frame1.png, frame2.png, .... This is not a complete fix for your problem, but at least you'll know that you've pressed Ctrl+S instead of Ctrl+E\nBy what you said it looks like you are using Import Sprite Sheet and Export Sprite Sheet to edit animations. My recommendation is that you should work with .aseprite files. In this way you have the original animation in one file, and you can export the sprite sheet with Ctrl+E (at least you don't need to import it anymore). Also this workflow will be improved when #138 and #126 are ready.\n. Sorry, the warning message is already implemented for the next release: commit 978145ba7a5ad0b1f2909a6cfa0d1406126985cf fixing #902\n. Manga Studio have several options to customize the paint bucket: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owAOJ-Q5sws\n. Related issues #177 (the same feature is requested in the comments) and #680 (customization of key modifier + mouse wheel)\n. Related to https://community.aseprite.org/t/changing-brush-size-using-keyb-mouse/668. Hi @Busimus, are you using the Allegro library included in the Github repository or the Allegro (shared) library installed on your system version? (You can check this resizing the Aseprite window, if you can resize the window, you are using the one included in the Github repo.)\n.  I'll be seeing this issue today so I can release the Linux version.\n. Hi @saint11! Some work is already in progress to improve the color picker is in #707, something like this should be included (also I'm thinking about a possible scripting API for customized color pickers, but maybe too much).\n. :+1: I'll take a look to this PR and others in these days.\n. Check this: https://github.com/Viza74/c64helperscriptsforaseprite\n. At the moment Select > Color Range (and selecting the \"Mask\" as color) is an alternative.\n. Actually I'm planning to prioritize this one, it might be available sooner than you expect.. Just in case I'm already working on this one:\nhttps://twitter.com/aseprite/status/1092884555126763521\nThe basic idea is that we should be able to:\n\nCreate a new \"tilemap layer\" using a new Layer > Add Tilemap Layer menu option\nWhen the active layer is a \"tilemap layer\", this will show some extra controls in the color bar (\"Tiles\" and \"Auto\" buttons at the moment, but that might change in the future)\nThen we can draw as in a regular layer, and tiles will be created automatically (when \"Auto\" button pressed)\nShift+Tab will switch between color palette <-> tiles\nClicking a tile will enable us to put tiles in the canvas (right-click might pick tiles from the canvas, or just act like the right-click default behavior, just like FG/BG colors, we could have a FG/BG tile, or FG/right-click behavior)\nWhen the \"Auto\" mode is unpressed, we can edit tiles manually (no new tiles are generated automatically)\nWe should be able to reference different tilesets from each tilemap layer, anyway each tilemap layer will have one layer-specific tileset to create those automatic tiles when the \"Auto\" mode is enabled.\n\nIn general terms, this new tilemap layer should work as the regular layer by default. And the special modes should start giving us more options (like putting tiles, modifying all instances of the same tiles, etc.).. Hi @EyeGem!\n\nDo you mean old tiles not removed from this layer-specific tileset when they entirely removed from Tilemap Layer itself?\n\nThere should be two possibilities: 1) Keep tiles intact and just add new tiles (+ offer a button to clear unused tiles automatically), 2) Clear unused tiles automatically too.\n\nAnd editor will keep order of tileset tiles until moved/edited by user just like colors of palette?\n\nThe user will be able to disable the \"Auto\" mode for the layer tileset (a tilemap layer will have only one \"auto\" tileset that can be enabled/disabled, any other referenced tileset will not be automatically handled = be in this \"auto\" mode).\n\nwe can load tiles to tileset from external tileset file (auto split by tiles size) once and then use them to draw map and later export tilemaps with exact tiles order saved?\n\nYes, the final version of the tilemap editor should give us the chance to reference several tilesets (from external .aseprite files too) and use tiles from those tilesets in one or several layer tilemaps.\n\nHope tile width and height are Tilemap Layer properties then and could be any\n\nYes, the only limitation will be that the \"tileset specs\" (tile width/height) should match with the layer tilemap specs. Anyway you will be able to have several layer tilemaps in the same files with different specs.\nAbout animated tilemaps: each frame in a layer tilemap will be a different tilemaps (so you could reference the same tilesets/tiles on each frame or vary only one tile, etc.). I still have to think about the persistence details and memory usage implications for huge tilemaps, but we should save tilemaps differences only for animations.\nIf I find something really complicated in the process, I'll try to push things forward for future versions and have a more basic version in the first v1.3-beta.. > To keep things simple it could be really preferable to just have one single tileset inside each Tilemap Layer\nIt was my original idea (and maybe the most simple way to go). By default it will almost in that way: each tilemap layer = one tileset. Anyway, if that is locked in that way it might be harder to share tilesets between several tilemap layers (which could be a popular use case).\nAnother possibility would be a double indirection: E.g. one tilemap tile could be an index that reference the layer tileset which itself is another reference to other tilesets. Not yet sure.\n\ngive user tools to copy images from external tilesets into this single tileset\n\nI'm not sure that \"copy\" is the right word here \ud83e\udd14 It will be possible to copy tiles from other tilesets (in the same way we copy colors from one palette to another), but I think it would preferable to \"link\" them in some way most of the time. This means: one tile (or tileset) that can be shared between different layers (and files), e.g. for different tilemap levels that use the same tileset.\nThe details about how to lock/unlock tiles (content and index) weren't implemented yet, so that will need some hard thought.\nI have to test what would be the best UX. In the current implementation, each pixel in the tilemap is a 32-bit value where it contains a tile index, a tileset index, and some flags (flip/rotation). The tileset index should be almost always = to the layer tileset, but if the user: 1) selects another tileset, 2) click a tile and, 3) put the tile in the canvas (layer tilemap), that specific tile in the tilemap will reference that tileset. (it must be a very explicit operation, so generally, layers should reference its own tileset most of the time). Yesterday I was thinking more about this, and I finally will back to my previous simpler design (more related with what @EyeGem said):\n\nOne Tilemap Layer => One Tileset\n\nWhy? Because it'll make a lot easier the user experience and if we need different tilesets to be used in the same sprite, we can create several tilemap layers anyway (and group them in Layer groups, etc.). So basically we'll have the tool to use several tilesets in the same sprite: using several tilemap layers. So it would be redundant (and a lot harder UX) to use multiple tilesets in the same layer.\nAbout variable tile sizes: It's planned that each tilemap layer (and its tileset) will have its own tiles spec (grid/tile width/height), so basically we will be able to mix different kind of tiles in the same sprite because we will be able to create different tilemap layers with different tile specs.\nAnd finally, about overlapping tiles, I'm experimenting with some interesting stuff, I don't promise nothing, but there might be really big surprises about this one.. @awesomez about the metatiles, how the information is exported? in the 8x8 tiles information? For example, if tiles looks like 16x16 but are just constructions/combinations of smaller 8x8 tiles, and that's the tilemap information consumed by the game (indexes from a 8x8 tiles tileset), I think that the only requirement for \"metatiles\" is an easy way to group small tiles in a kind of palette/sandbox area were we can arrange 8x8 tiles in 16x16 groups and then we can grab those objects/bigger tiles and put then as a group in the canvas (but the 8x8 tiles information is always the real information kept in the tilemap).\nThere are plans to offer this kind of grouping of tiles to easily put bigger objects in the canvas, it should not be specific to metatiles, but it should be useful for metatiles.\nIn anycase, this is not planned for the first version (already the first version will contain so many changes that I would prefer a basic tilemap editor first, and then grow the feature from there).. @awesomez the most important question is what information is needed by the game. If the game consume a tilemap + tileset with tiles with 8x8, it could be done. In case that the needed information is some specific interpretation of the bits in the tilemap, then some .aseprite <-> your tilemap conversion will be needed (e.g. with custom scripts). At the moment there are no plans to support all possible scenarios with the tilemap editor.\nAnyway I'm not sure that I understood correctly the internals. If you know an article that talks about all this stuff, it will be greatly appreciated. The most important thing is \"what data does the game need?\", because that will enable different ways to solve this problem. For example, I have some idea to link tilesets between documents which could create hierarchies of tiles, but the information might not be easily \"readable\" by a game engine.. Correct me if I'm wrong:\n\nA tilemap is a grid where each tile points to a tileset (let's call it tileset A) with tiles of 16x16\nEach 16x16 tile in the tileset A is 4 tiles/indexes to another tileset B with tiles of 8x8\nAnd each tile in tileset B are 4 tiles from a tileset C with tiles of 4x4\n\nIf that is correct, a possible way would be that a tilemap layer could have its tileset pointing to another .aseprite file which can contain the composition of the tiles (and the .aseprite file can contain several layers, tilemaps with smaller tiles, etc.). Anyway the hard part would be to edit all the hierarchy (editing the bigger 16x16 tile should touch 3 files at the same time).. @not-surt if I get it correctly, I think it's the idea I have in mind: a tilemap has a \"tileset source\", it can be \"its own tileset\", or an \"external tileset\" (here we can call this external tileset as \"metatileset\"). The external tileset can point to another sprite + a grid/slices to extract the tiles in the set. What's the problem? Maybe too much freedom to specify the tileset tiles, I was thinking that the sprite could composite the tileset with any number of layers/etc., but that might be impossible to solve when we must do a reverse matching of layers when we edit pixels in the bigger tilemap (the \"metatilemap\").\nStill need to think more about this use case and how to solve it with a nice UX.. > copying groups of smallest tiles and placing them grouped with some automatic assistance\nI think the difference is that tilemaps of 16x16 have indexes to a tileset of 16x16 tiles, no to 4x4 tiles. So basically metatiles is not only a way to composite bigger tiles with smaller ones (hierarchy of tiles) but it is also a way to compress tilemap data (because tilemaps reference only to their own level of tiles using smaller index numbers).. > But composition of different sizes could be easily done with several Tilemap Layers, 16x16 as bkg, 8x8 over it and 4x4 over 8x8. The only thing will be images sharing between those layers.\nI'm not sure if an arrangement of three tilemaps in that way could solve the metatiles problem correctly. From what was said, something like this is needed (in this case for only two levels/tilesets):\n\nWe could provide a completely automatic way to generate the 8x8 (or 4x4) tilemaps from the 16x16 images tilemap using some special export functions (something similar to this script).\nAnyway I'm not sure what level of control over each tileset level is required (I suppose total control), in our example, we should be able to re-arrange the tiles in the 8x8 tileset in any order and the final visible result should be the same without modifying the data of the tilemap A, but the tileset/tilemap B data in the 8x8 level should be completely different. E.g.\n\n. It should be fixed with #924 \n. This issue should be fixed in v1.1.4 with 0605166cc6e5c5631add77ba1246ab9f9e1b3434\n. Related to #810 \n. This should be fixed in v1.1.9 with 2d2fb0038afe8e57280aff21d5f65ddce10c2e2e\n. Hi @Cerno-b, it looks like color curve modifications are not updated when the preview checkbox is deactivated. But it seems to work when it's activated:\n\n. I'm closing this issue because I wasn't able to reproduce it with those specific steps.\n. I'll close this issue as there are not reproducible steps and there weren't other bug reports about this same issue. I suspect it might be related to some random problem/bug in the Windows Explorer (as the Windows Explorer is the one that controls the taskbar).\n. Hi @arcooke, it looks like there are a couple of Steam client bugs here. I didn't provide Linux binaries yet, and they show Aseprite on the software listing (that's why there is a missing executable, it's not ready yet).\nAbout the second problem, there is a checkbox in the internal Steam website to indicate that Aseprite depends on VC runtimes, and I find quite interesting that the Steam client is downloading they anyway on Linux (should be a kind of filter or something).\nI think that these issues should be reported at: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues But I'll look at this later. Thanks for reporting these problems!\n. Hi @Viomi, ok, I'll close this issue and take a look at the INSTALL.md which need a rewrite.\n. Follow  #971 I'll be working on this today.\n. See #578\n. It looks like FreeBSD includes dl functions in the libc. I'll push a fix in a moment.\n. Thanks @sirblackheart for your help. Yes, it's a problem with some Linux window manager. I'll leave #796 open and mark this and #205 as duplicate.\n. Hi @devil-tamachan, could you please give me more details about this? What file format would need this flag? Do you have a patch for an extra file format to use these options?\nI generally add things that are used in the program and remove all dead code, so I need some kind of use case for this.\n. Why doesn't load_widget work? Are you using the command line? or UI? What error do you have? I don't think the flag will be useful in this case, you might check if the UI is available (fop->context()->isUIAvailable()). Also would you contribute this patch as a PR? Or how you will distribute this patch?\n. Some points about this:\n1. You will need to sign our CLA to contribute a PR\n2. Instead of using the load_widget function, you can use the auto-generated widget (see gif format, #include \"gif_options.xml.h\" and how the GifOptions is autogenerated in build/src/app/gif_options.xml.h)\n3. Debug the line that is freezing the program\n4. There is a lot of things to do in a code review for that code, please keep it clean, I guest you have in this state because is a temporal copy.\n5. Use English comments\n6. Use the same coding style that in other files (e.g. see fli_format.cpp).\n7. And what is the adw format? What other program support this file format? Is this a common file format?\n. As an alternative you could try to use your own implementation to decode az/adw/this file format. Anyway I don't think AzDrawing is globally known (e.g. as gif/png files)\n. Thanks @sirblackheart! :beers: \n. I'll make some comments in the code in a moment. The only thing that will require a lot of testing before I merge this PR are the dependencies (which are really hard to solve/test on .deb files for 32-bit, 64-bit, and Steam)\n\nI noticed, that current folder string is empty in https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/src/app/commands/cmd_open_file.cpp#L117\nso i can not reproduce the behavior of the Aseprite dialog when opening a file. Aseprites own dialog stays in the same folder where the last file was opened.\n\nMaybe a static/global std::string g_lastUsedDir might solve this.\n\nAnd i am sorry for the wrong variables in my last pull request, normally i test my branch in Linux, Windows and OS X, but because of some manual reading of changes i made the mistakes and forgot to test again on Windows. Again i am sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nNo problem :+1:\n. Hi @oceanhahn, why are you using this option so much? I'm asking because we might find other feature that is better than all these options to improve your workflow.\nFor example, I'd like to add a \"slice\" tool where you can select multiple rectangles from one sprite that can be exported to different files with just one click.\n. (related in some way to #475)\n. Hi @Kirozen, could you please sign our CLA?\n. Thanks @Kirozen! I'll merge this PR right now.\n. Hi @Kelvin-Shadewing, the option now is the little \"burger\" palette menu: http://imgur.com/5TPFdoe\n. > You closed the issue when I had more to say.\nSorry, but I close issues that seems to be already solved. Anyway you can continue commenting on a closed issue and I can reopen (and change the issue title) it if it's necessary.\n\nWhy did you bother moving it like that?\n\nTo remove clutter from the Palette Editor (in the future I'd like to merge the palette editor with the color selector, but I'm not yet sure how to do it).\nI see that it's not possible to assign a keyboard shortcuts to the color quantization, so I'll fix that. That should be a good option for you (at least that is what I think). Also, there is an idea to add a color quantization in the same RGB -> Indexed dialog (just in case you use the quantization just before the conversion).\nI think there are several things to do on this issue:\n- [x] Add the possibility to associate a keyboard shortcut to the color quantization (so we can open the dialog directly)\n- [ ] If the color bar is too small, show buttons stacked vertically or in other way so the burger icon is visible\n- [ ] Add a command/keyboard shortcut to show the palette menu popup (it might be Alt+P)\n. I think that we should go for the native thumbnails approach.\nThere are three major refactors I'd like to do after v1.1.x series:\n1. Move code to load/save .ase images into a special library (libase or something like that)\n2. Move all code to load/save all supported formats into iff library (which will use libase).\n3. Merge base, gfx, she, ui, and maybe other modules into a common library to create portable desktop applications (it's probable that she will be renamed to low, and everything will be inside a new repository/namespace named laf)\nThe last point is a key component. My long term goal with Aseprite is to create a C++ library to develop applications. And inside this library should be a component to create thumbnails in a portable way (Windows Explorer, OS X Finder, and Linux file manager/gdk).\nIn the best case scenario, all the code inside app should be the only code for Aseprite. And it should provide the glue between libase and laf's thumbnail generator.\n. Thanks for your help Gabriel, I'll merge this PR. I didn't test it on Linux yet, but as it's disabled by default, it doesn't look like an issue to already have this merged.\n. Hi @Disinterpreter, the Esc key cancels the tool, but it looks like it doesn't refresh the editor. I'll mark this as a bug.\n. Just as a side note, you can cancel the curve tool (or any other tool) pressing the other mouse button (e.g. you start drawing pressing left mouse button, and you want to cancel, so you can press the right button, and then release both buttons).\n. This is a known issue. When you click a color in the colorbar, the brush itself is modified, so if you select the same color, the brush is \"destroyed\" (because both colors were replaced with the same one).\nA solution would be to keep the original brush and colors are replaced from there.\n. Fixed, this will be available on v1.1.5\n. Hi @KasumiArai, quite complex to be fixed, but I'll see what we can do. (It looks like UI editor information should be saved in undo steps.)\n. I'm going to fix this one in the following way: The last painted color will be a data stored in the sprite (i.e. shared between all editors), so the undo information will save/restore that last point information.. :open_mouth: it happens on Windows too. I'll fix this ASAP\n\nFeels like I'm winning a game of Solitaire every time I move the window, can't complain.\n\n:smile: \n. Anyway it behaves randomly. Sometimes it happens and other times it doesn't happen.\n. Hi @allkhor, are you using the official release? or a compiled one?\n. Has your mouse high resolution? (I'm trying to understand why moving the canvas is slow with the mouse but not with the wacom pen)\n. The rendering issues should be related to this commit https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/1588e834c3838ffda630abc21bb70c2d4fd75d4d\nspecifically these lines:\nhttps://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/1588e834c3838ffda630abc21bb70c2d4fd75d4d#diff-fa5a5001ac6008c80a38b2326237bfe8R624\nand\nhttps://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/1588e834c3838ffda630abc21bb70c2d4fd75d4d#diff-fa5a5001ac6008c80a38b2326237bfe8R1467\nWhen a widget is moved, its position (bounds) change, so paint messages in the queue are invalid and they're removed. It means that if we flood the message queue with mouse messages, paint messages aren't processed because they are invalidated by mouse messages. It was done to fix scrolling issues in the sprite editor/scrollable widgets (to blit/move/re-use still valid screen regions).\nI'll see how to fix this issue, maybe window movement and splitters should flush drawing messages to update the screen as fast as possible.\n. @geckojsc Could you please give a try to this issue on Windows with the new v1.1.4 release (the official one, which is compiled with Skia)?\n. @geckojsc glad to hear that Jeremy! And thanks for your support :beers:\nThis issue should be fixed when the Skia port is ready for Linux.\n. Hi @HansLehnert, could you give a try to the Skia back-end? It should fix the issue. (See instructions INSTALL.md about how to compile Aseprite with the Skia back-end.)\n. eb0f046dc7f975fae6922daf2e7b6d5e3ed62c58 has fixed some UI problems, and also reduced this issue a little, anyway still visible on Alleg/Linux port. I'm planning this part of the issue:\n\nI'm often switching between indexed and rgb colors. It would be pretty handy if we could get the Create Palette from current Sprite dialog prompt when we switch to indexed mode.\nI don't think it would get in the way and would maybe clarify what's happening with users new to indexed mode.\n\nFor v1.1.4 or v1.1.5.\n. Hi @batmanasb, could you please check the latest release v1.1.5.1 to see if this issue is fixed?\n. I'll try to create a Mint VM to reproduce this. On Ubuntu it works correctly. Does Mint include xdg-open command line utility?\n. Related to #710 too (e.g. a pencil with pen pressure + antialiasing)\n. Requested in the community website too: https://community.aseprite.org/t/antialiasing-filter/700. Hi @Bobhostern, in which Linux distribution you're compiling?\n. Finally fixed: http://www.aseprite.org/pronunciation/ \ud83d\ude04 \n. Hi @Nsheppard01, this PR is in conflict with the current master branch, anyway next week I'll try to fix the conflict and merge it. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Well, I've already merged the PR :smile:. Thanks for the contribution!\n. It's strange because it looks like you have libx11-dev installed, but it's incompatible in some way. Maybe it's a x86_64 version of the library and the current compiler is x86 arch (i386). Would you mind to share the CMakeCache.txt file inside the build directory?\n. Hi @alivegames, I'll review this bug today. Anyway, please contact me at support@aseprite.org in case you would like to download v1.1.1.\n. Note: this bug was introduced in 978145ba7a5ad0b1f2909a6cfa0d1406126985cf when #902 was fixed\n. This fix will be released in v1.1.4.\n. I've fixed this one, but I'm still thinking, should the focus be kept in the sliders? E.g. we click the Red slider, then press tab and we focus the Red text field, pressing Tab again the focus goes to the Blue slider, and pressing Tab again we focus the Blue text field.\nAs you said, it would be better if only text fields keep the focus. Right?\n. I've noticed that on Photoshop, Tab key cycles only through text fields, and sliders don't get focused. And the way to make single-increments/decrements is using up/down arrow keys. It looks like a nice solution (touching sliders don't affect keyboard focus, so we can still press Tab to switch timeline, and only when we are on text fields Tab key starts to behave differently, and we don't lost the capacity to make single digits adjustments).\nNext week I'll make the final tweaks to this fix.\n. ^_^ I'll see what I finally do. I was writing a blog post to unify color selectors + palette editor + color bar (#492 #1102) but I need to think more about it.\n. The default palette of old Aseprite versions was the VGA palette. I don't think it's a pixel-art related palette, but it'd be good to have it back again anyway.\n. Yes, it looks good to me. Could you please check if the values are the same as in the default Allegro palette? (values in the Allegro palette are in [0,63] range, so they must be:\nvga-15h.gpl value = Allegro value * 255 / 63\n. We can keep it as black. Thanks for take time about this, would you like to create a PR? I can add the gpl file directly anyway.\n. Hi @Nsheppard01, could the WebSafeColors.gpl file be renamed to web-safe-colors.gpl? You can ammend your commit and use push --force to change this pull request content.\n. Don't worry, I'll merge this as it is.\n. I thought about this feature several times, but I've never decided to include it as we can press Ctrl+N (the default size is the clipboard image size), Enter, Ctrl+V.\nAnyway, sometimes I find a little uncomfortable to see the clipboard image size in File > New instead of the latest used image size.\nI think that there are several things we can do with this:\n- [ ] Add a command (that can be invoked with a keystroke) to create the new sprite with the clipboard content. On the GIMP the shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+V\n- [ ] If the clipboard contains an image, we might add a little clipboard tab so when it's pressed a new file is created with the clipboard content\n- [ ] Add an option in settings to avoid changing the default size in File > New depending on the clipboard content\n. @oceanhahn I was thinking in something like this:\n\ninstead of a tab. When the icon is clicked a new document with the clipboard content is created.\n. (and I have to review #996 yet)\n. > Would there be an Edit menu option as well and that icon would be a shortcut to it\nYes, at least the icon should be a shortcut for something else that might be called with a keyboard shortcut.\n. Maybe an Edit > Paste as New Sprite menu (related to #672 too)\n. Hi @slick1015, I think I can merge this issue with #707.\nFor the first color picker, you can use the new Color tint/shade/tone selector. There are no discrete steps as in Pyxel Edit but you can create tints and shades in a similar way.\nThe color wheel is already included :smile:\n. Hi @KasumiArai, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly, but is missing some option to remove the \"shift\" modifier as a \"ratio lock\" to select? right?\nFor example, here we have the \"ratio lock\" when we scale the selection:\n\nBut we still need the Selection Tool: Maintain Aspect Ratio item.\n. I'll try to release v1.1.4-beta2 this week on Steam with this feature.\n. \n. I've updated my Xcode and got the same problem. I'll try to fix it, anyway the Allegro port will be deprecated/removed soon. So if I'm not able to fix this problem, I'll update the INSTALL.md instructions and the new official back-end (at least on OS X) will be the Skia one. (And v1.1.4 will use the Skia back-end)\n. I will close this issue as we'll not use the Allegro back-end on OS X anymore. Refer to the INSTALL.md file to know how to compile Aseprite with the new Skia back-end.\n. Skia is a graphics library only (it can use CPU or GPU/OpenGL or DirectX through ANGLE), it doesn't have functions/classes to create windows, handle keyboard or mouse input, etc. Those other libraries (SDL2, Allegro, SFML, etc.) gives you a way to handle all this stuff (graphics+input) in a game-oriented way which doesn't work so well with applications. So in our case, with the \"Skia\" backend, Aseprite handles all windows/keyboard/mouse events, and Skia is used to draw graphics.\n. It looks good to me. Anyway I'll make some tests before merging it.\n. I will change --shrink-to widthxheight to --shrink-to width,height and the same for --frame-range from,to (as --crop x,y,width,height)\n. As a side note: I think that, in a near future, we could have a:\naseprite thumbnail file.ase file.png\ncommand option to avoid loading all frames from .ase files to generate a thumbnail. Related to #901 \n. I was thinking and I'll add these files in the repository. Maybe in a misc or installation directory.\n. Is Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts... what you are looking for?\n. The filtering/searching field is available since v1.1.2. Closing this issue.\n. Hi James, go back to Edit > Preferences and change the \"Screen Scaling\" option to 200%. I'll release a patch soon.\n. (Note for future reference: If I remember correctly, this bug was fixed in 1d7184dd37461d2cc163a0a87eb7593f26e68714)\n. Hi @winterheart, would you like to sign our CLA?\n. Thanks for your contributions @winterheart!\n. Hi @Mailaender, sorry but we don't use Allegro to load/save files. LBM is not supported and there are no plans to support it. I'll leave this open just in case more people want to load LBM files.\nAs an extra note, we use these decoder/encoders: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/tree/master/src/app/file\n. It is as @coffee-lord said, if you've used the v1.1.3 tag (or v1.1.3 source file zip) it doesn't included the fix. I'll add a new tag for the commit used in the official Linux distribution to avoid confusion.\n. Hi @jameswilddev, thanks for reporting this issue. I saw that you are (probably) using the Steam version, could you please try if this bug happens in the beta version?\n. I've tested adding a manifest and it doesn't fix the issue. I'll be investigating what is missing yet.\n. @vncastanheira I didn't know that the application freezing on close. Can you reproduce the problem? debug it? Or do you have a crash report?\n. Done, the manifest really fixed this issue, but we need a specific value (True/PM) (that is compatible with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10).\n. Thanks @winterheart!\n. I'll be converting some third_party libs into submodules (zlib and libpng are the next ones). The only problem with libcurl is that the official git repository is too big, so I think I'll create a small mirror of it (only uncompressed .zip content)\n. I'm waiting for this kind of app bundle feature on Linux from long time ago. I didn't expect it was so advanced. I've to take a look to this technology. Also I'd love to see how Steam is going to use this.\n. I've to start working on an AppImage for the next version. Giving more priority to this one.. Thanks for this @winterheart \n. Actually (as I commented in the other issue) you can already create custom brushes and associate them to a keyboard shortcut (Alt+1, Alt+2, etc. shortcuts by default). Take a look at: http://imgur.com/2ke4Xgw\n. Oh sorry  @SleepyEleven, the whole time I was reading \"custom brushes\" instead of \"custom buttons\" :sweat_smile: I'll take a look to this feature in these days.\n. Related to #475 \n. You could give a try to the new scripting capabilities.. Hi @SleepyEleven, you might try to use a custom brush (Edit > New Brush menu, or Ctrl+B), select the group of pixels you want to copy, then use the line tool (L key), and draw a straight line (Shift locks the X/Y axis). Demo about custom brushes: http://imgur.com/2ke4Xgw\n. Hi @sirblackheart, I'll review this tomorrow. Would you like to rename the folder to desktop?\n. You can just use MIT license if you want, no deed for dual license in that case. (Note: I'm not sure if I'll be able to test this until next week, as I'd like to release a new update this week.)\n. Thanks @sirblackheart I'll merge this and disable the integration by default, just in case. We can enable it later.\n. Actually we are using WinMain, and GetCommandLineW in the Alleg4 back-end and CommandLineToArgvW in the Skia side. It looks like setargv.obj works for main() (and I suppose -ENTRY:\"mainCRTStartup\" linking flag). We could try to change the entry point to wmain() and linking to wsetargv.obj to fix this issue.\n. I'll try to get a look at this issue for v1.2 (as I'm refactoring the CLI processing).\nNote for development: See CommandLineToArgvW function.\n. Hi @AndyGFX. I guess that you are using an Indexed image with blend modes (as the ACDSee quick view status bar shows that the png has 8bpp, it means it's indexed). You might try to use RGB color mode instead (Sprite > Color Mode > RGB). More info about color modes here: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/color/\n. Hi @geckojsc, it looks quite strange. I've never saw something similar. I see that you are using the compiled version, do you compile with the Allegro back-end or Skia? I see that you have a lot of applications open, something else is using DirectX? Have you tried to restart Windows and test this issue having only Aseprite open?\n. I recommend the chrome/m50 branch of Skia. Anyway it's good to know that there is an option in the Nvidia panel to fix the issue. If you want to give a try to the Skia port (compiling it or using the beta branch in the Steam client) you can leave the issue open, if you aren't going to try the Skia branch, you can close it (the issue can be opened in a future if it re-appears).\n. I think you will need awk to compile libpng. You can use the MozillaBuild package.\n. Contacted again about this issue, this might be related because the repo clones/checkouts (mainly the libpng checkout) are using a Windows-like (CRLF) End Of Line (EOL) and the .zip contains Unix-like (LF) EOL.\nA possible option that you might try is disabling the automatic-CRLF conversion before cloning:\ngit config core.autocrlf\n\nAnd then start again:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite.git\n\n. Hi @bitinn, thanks for reporting this! please contact me at support@aseprite.org and I'll see if I can send you some special build tomorrow so we can find the problem.\n. I've just updated the Steam version. This issue should be fixed now.\n. Hi @moogDE, thanks for the PR. Anyway I modified that section with a more accurate description (e.g. now we can just download the source code from a zip file). See 392eacdb6ad453eb68ff253a94aa9267b1f1b194\n. Hi @bitinn, It's already fixed on #1057, it will released this week (there are other crash reports I'd like to see if I can fix before the new version)\n. The fix is already available in v1.1.4.1 (on Steam, Gumroad, itch.io, and Humble Bundle)\n. Hi @RomainGiraud, would you like to sign our CLA?\n. Thanks for the contribution @RomainGiraud \n. (Highly probable that this crash was introduced with 27b55030e26e93c5e8d9e7e21206c8709d46ff22 fix.)\n. Yeah, it's a known issue. Keyboard shortcuts with Unicode characters or special symbols aren't working as expected. I've a private branch that I've to bring back to master to continue. Anyway I want to finish the X11 Skia port first, remove Allegro back-end, and fix the keyboard. I'll write a task list in #139 \n. Hi @tony, we don't support the Allegro port anymore on OS X, as in #1029, with Xcode 7.3 there is a bug linking the executable. It might have a fix, but anyway as I was planning to move everything to the Skia port I've decided to finally abandon the Allegro back-end (which required OS X 10.4u SDK, a pretty old one).\nIn this case, you are trying to compile the Allegro port with OS X 10.11 SDK, something that isn't possible.\n. Hi @TheConfuZzledDude, it's strange but I thought that this issue was duplicated. At least in my head I've this already planned (internally a sprite can have multiple color palettes, but there is no User Interface to do that).\n. There are some work-in-progress about this one, internally it's supported, but the most difficult part is the UI (which needs some redesign of the Timeline to show the palette changes like a new layers). Hi @Nsheppard01, how did you associated other file formats to Aseprite? What operating system are you using (Win, OSX, Linux)?\n. This issue is already solved from v1.1.4 (#477) for Windows and OS X. What operating system you are using (Win, OS X, Linux)?\n. I've just reopen #477 to add Linux support\n. @Nsheppard01 did you set the file association by hand on Windows? On Windows there are special registry directives to open files through DDE instead of the command line:\n```\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.ase\n  (Default) = \"AsepriteFile\"\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.aseprite\n  (Default) = \"AsepriteFile\"\n\"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AsepriteFile\n  (Default) = \"Aseprite Sprite\"\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AsepriteFile\\DefaultIcon\n   (Default) = \"%INSTALLDIR%\\Aseprite.EXE,2\"\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AsepriteFile\\shell\\open\\command\n  (Default) = \"\\\"%INSTALLDIR%\\Aseprite.EXE\\\"\"\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AsepriteFile\\shell\\open\\ddeexec\n  (Default) = \"[open(\\\"%1\\\")]\"\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AsepriteFile\\shell\\open\\ddeexec\\application\n  (Default) = \"Aseprite\"\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AsepriteFile\\shell\\open\\ddeexec\\topic\n  (Default) = \"system\"\n```\n. The default association that the Windows Explorer does is to open files through the command line. This prevents using the same Aseprite instance to open the file.\nThe file association that the Aseprite installer and Aseprite on Steam create is through the special DDE mechanism to detect existent instances. (E.g. this is the way which Microsoft Office opens documents in the running instance of Word or Excel.)\nSo this issue is solved (on Windows) through the installation process.\n. Are we talking about .ase files? Or are we talking about other type of files (e.g. .png files)? Because it only applies to .ase (or .aseprite files). You might try the following:\n1. Open the registry editor and delete the AsepriteFile folder inside HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\n2. Reinstall latest Aseprite (v1.1.7) from the installer (or uninstall/reinstall it from Steam)\n3. Try to double click a .ase or .aseprite file from Windows explorer.\n. If this doesn't work, please try to export the content of AsepriteFile folder in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT using the registry editor and send me a copy of the .reg file at support@aseprite.org\n. You can configure .png and .jpg extensions in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT like the .ase extension, setting the (Default) value to AsepriteFile. Anyway I think that there are some options to solve this in future versions:\n1. The installer could have more check-boxes to associate other files with Aseprite\n2. The Edit > Preferences dialog could contain check-boxes to associate files with Aseprite\n. You're right, I'll investigate if there is an easy option to add an \"Open with Aseprite\" option in other file types (png, jpg, etc.), in that way there is no need to lost the photo viewer association.\n. Hi @Senpai-Artorias, I think you are running:\ncmake -G Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\nWhen you should be running:\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\"\nAnyway I recommend you \"nmake\", as you will not need to open Visual Studio. E.g.\ncmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\"\nAnd then you can compile Aseprite using:\nnmake aseprite\n. Do you have cmake installed?\n. I think you don't have cmake in the PATH environment variable. You can execute this:\nset PATH=C:\\cmake\\bin;%PATH%\nAnd then run cmake to check that the command is available.\nAnyway, before running cmake with all parameters, you must be sure that you are running the Visual Studio command line tools, you can execute:\ncall \"%VS140COMNTOOLS%\\vsvars32.bat\"\nSo you will have the Visual Studio compiler (and nmake) available in the command line. After all this, try again the cmake command with the parameters.\n. Two things: 1) You have to execute cmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" .. (the .. is important as it indicates the directory where the source code is. 2) Please execute cl (just that and press enter) to know if the C compiler is in the command line.\nIf you have executed\ncall \"%VS140COMNTOOLS%\\vsvars32.bat\"\nAnd the compiler (cl) is not in the command line, it's probable that you don't have Visual Studio 2015 installed.\nAnyway I'll stop this issue here, as basically the source code is available for developers.\n. Hi @winterheart, thanks for these changes. They look great. I'll make a comment just in one line...\n. Hi there! Thanks @sirblackheart, yes, it's the same issue. I'll make Skia the default back-end on OS X because the Allegro one isn't supported anymore.\n. Thanks @winterheart!\n. Not sure when this was fixed, but it's already fixed.. Hi @hepari, actually that can be done but using the command line interface: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/cli/#filename-format\n. Can you try:\n%ASEPRITE% -b EyeballB1.ase --save-as output0\\frame01.png\n%ASEPRITE% -b EyeballB1.ase --filename-format \"{title}-{tag}{tagframe01}.{extension}\" --save-as EyeballB1.png\n. I'll be seeing this issue soon, I think some options like:\n1. All frames\n2. Selected frames\n3. Active frame\n4. Frame tag\n. The only problem I see with this issue is that there will be several alternatives (even more with the next v1.2-beta2 that will allow selection of non-adjacent frames), some examples:\n1. Save all frames with names filename1.png, filename2.png, etc.\n2. Save selected frames or frame tag with filename1.png, filename2.png, etc. ~~or with the specific number (e.g. if we select frame 3, 6, and 9, then we would like to save filename3.png, filename6.png, filename9.png, instead of filename1.png, filename2.png, filename3.png).~~ We can avoid this second case just for simplicity, so frames will be always saved sequentially from the first filenameN.png, to filenameN+1.png, etc.\n3. Active frame should be saved with the specific given filename (or maybe we want to export just the current frame without worrying about the active frame number). So if we are in frame 3 and press \"save active frame\" it just update the filename3.png, and if we are in frame 5, it updates filename5.png, etc.\n. \n. This will be available in the next v1.2-beta2\n. @Dairnon actually that's possible using the CLI:\naseprite.exe -b animations.ase --save-as animation-{tag}.gif\n\n. (same as #1066 and #1074)\nPlease refer to the dependencies section in the INSTALL.md file: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/INSTALL.md#dependencies\nSkia is not included in the third_party directory and must be compiled separately. It's a huge library with a customized build system (it doesn't use cmake at this moment, but there is some progress in that area).\nAbout SDL, the idea is to have just one back-end with all the instructions to create windows and handle events customized. Generally, these libraries like Allegro, SDL2, SFML, etc. are game oriented, so they don't have stuff to handle file events (dropping a file in the window), or pen pressure, or vertical/horizontal scroll with trackpads (which is a really tricky issue on Windows), etc.\nSo basically we must write all the code to create a Windows, and we can use Skia to draw stuff in the graphics context.\n. Hmm this is strange. I didn't get those errors on OS X (same options as you). Please try compiling with:\nninja -C out/Debug dm\nAnd let me know. Other option, I've used export:\nexport GYP_DEFINES='skia_gpu=0'\nBut I don't think that affects the ninja command.\n. It looks like a library was compiled with GPU support. Could you please try to clean the Skia build (ninja clean), and compile it again (and maybe reconfigure it again with sync-and-gyp)\n. :+1: I'm glad you were able to compiled :wink: looking for your feedback\n. Hi people, did you try the aseprite-m55 branch? We're using that one for compiling the master version.. @locoruiz are you trying to compile master? beta? or v1.1.9? because there is no more SKIA_OPTS_AVX2_LIBRARY variable in the she/CMakeLists.txt file. @locoruiz yeah, that's the problem. v1.1.9 requires Skia's aseprite-m53 branch. You can follow the INSTALL.md instructions from the v1.1.9 source code, because the INSTALL.md in the master branch is for the master branch (not for v1.1.9). If you've already compiled aseprite-m55 branch, you might try to clone and compile Aseprite's master branch.. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but:\nAseprite v1.1.9 <-> requires Skia aseprite-m53\nAseprite master <-> requires Skia aseprite-m55. @locoruiz v1.1.9 is the latest released version, master (and beta) are the development branches.\nGracias por las palabras! Saludos desde Argentina! \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks @winterheart\n. Related to #139 \n. Reported here too. cc @winterheart \n. @winterheart Yes, Aseprite supports WinXP (there are still a couple of WinXP users out there, and it wasn't quite easy to do it, I'm using a modified Skia branch just to compile everything statically and support WinXP).\nI'll take a look to this issue, if I don't find a quick solution, I'll rollback the change.\n. I'm using cmake 3.5.0, I'll update to cmake 3.5.2 to see if I can reproduce this issue.\n. @winterheart I don't think that the test should be moved, I'll try to move the subsystem flag to the Aseprite target only, and that should fix the issue (at least that is what I think)\n. It's strange because I cannot reproduce the issue.\n@sarcasmloading: did you try to create a completely new `build'  folder (removing all the content it contain before, not just the cache)? I'm asking this because on this comment you said that @winterheart solution didn't work, but it looks like the only cause this error might happen. :/\n. > we can't find a solution I'll probably reinstall Windows\n:smile: I don't think that would be necessary (at least for this issue)\n. I wasn't able to reproduce the issue (not even with x86 and x64 toolchains). I'll continue with other issues and leave this.\n@winterheart if you can reproduce the issue, send a PR if you can fix it, but if you aren't able to reproduce the issue, I'm not sure if we should do a change. what do you think?\n. Meanwhile, @sarcasmloading, you can try to completely remove these lines:\n```\nif (CMAKE_CL_64)\n    # 64 bits\n    set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} /MACHINE:X64\")\n  else()\n    # Add support for Windows XP with 5.01 subsystem\n    set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} /MACHINE:X86 /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01\")\n  endif()\n```\nFrom src\\CMakeLists.txt, start from a clean build, and send us the log files.\n. I add the SUBSYSTEM manually in my building scripts, so it's not needed in the CMakeLists.txt definitions. We can remove those lines. (Also VS2015 is the supported platform to compile Aseprite, and it doesn't run on WinXP, so I don't think that someone compiling Aseprite would need WinXP support anyway.)\n. @sarcasmloading please try the master branch, because I've merged a fix from @winterheart for this issue\n. Hi @mpolynskyi, as a first step, I think you didn't clone the repository recursively, see this:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite.git\nAfter that, I think you will have this same issue #1026, check the solution there and tell me if that works.\n. You're welcome. Now you can try the solution in #788\n. Thanks for this @winterheart\nThe only thing I'm still thinking about this is why I wasn't able to reproduce this problem. I'll check later in my production VM to see if something else is needed for the WinXP compilation, but I think it should work as it is.\n. Hi @zwik and @OrenjiAkira, seeing this I've detected an error in INSTALL.md, the argument isn't USE_SKIA_ALLEG4, it's USE_ALLEG4_BACKEND. I've updated the instructions in 7c9b9eacea733ea79458937cab5a9e579d5b3cfd\nI hope it helps\n. @zwik don't use the Debug version of Skia, it will be really slow, use the Release one\n. From your last log @zwik, it looks like your Skia version was compiled with gpu support.\n. @zwik See if echo $GYP_DEFINES prints skia_gpu=0, if not, you should use export GYP_DEFINES=skia_gpu=0 before sync-and-gyp command.\n. This bug might be fixed with this commit fda9abce334501f71041d371683b0751c11afbdd\nIt only happened when the program was executed the very first time on OS X or if the window couldn't be created with the configured size (e.g. if the window was closed in a second monitor, then the monitor is disconnected and the program is re-opened in the smaller monitor).\nI'll close this issue but it might re-appear after v1.1.5.5.\n. Hi @KasumiArai, yeah, I'm not sure about this behavior, this should be optional and not enabled by default (and maybe only available when onion skinning is for current layer only, as with multiple layers might be a little messy).\n. I've created a little file to test this (3groups.aseprite.zip), with the new option, if we are in frame 5 in layer 1, we should see the frame 3 and frame 7 onion skinned.\n. This issue brings me a lot to think about. In one side we could explain all the possibilities (e.g. \"you can use make, or ninja, or vs projects, etc.\") and all the steps needed to use each alternative. On the other side we could just give a unique list of steps for \"non-programmers\".\nWhat I think about this? It's quite a tricky situation.\nLooking at the amount of recent issues reported to compile Aseprite, it seems that a very low percentage of (C++) programmers are trying to compile Aseprite. We're having a lot of noise with compilations issues.\nAt the moment, my preference is that INSTALL.md should be focused to programmers.\n. > I had to go on an expedition to figure out why skia wouldn't build correctly for me\nYes, me too, its build system is the most tricky part. Actually the only requirement for Aseprite is that GYP_DEFINES must be skia_gpu when you compile Skia. Anyway I've compiled Skia so many times that I don't even remember the original instructions or in which state is the official documentation, so my opinions are really biased.\n\nIncorporate skia adds a big step to building aseprite, probably bigger than configuring and building aseprite itself. I think the increase in the issues is caused by the skia migration - and that docs are a way to decrease the noise.\n\nYeah. I was having the idea to clean up the whole INSTALL.md when I completely remove the Allegro back-end, but seeing the current state, I think you are right, we should add the \"how to compile Skia\" section in INSTALL (at least to reduce the number of future issue reports).\nCould you please move the \"skia\" section at the end and add a subsection for OSX/Linux,etc? I'll write the Windows instructions then.\n. Also I'm seriously thinking that Ninja should be almost mandatory (if someone wants to use other build system, is because he/she knows about CMake)\n. It's fine. I'll continue from here and see if I can make this even more simple. Thanks for the help @tony \n. @tony I've just updated the INSTALL.md instructions with cab10fba1e1ffaed218cfb3856d70b1b5fad5c4d if you can give it a look that would be great, I hope this helps reducing the number of issue reports\n. Hi @KashouC, I've contacted several times for this same issue. Thanks for the mockup and I'll review if something similar can be included in v1.2. If I start working on this issue, I'll write some alternatives ideas here.\n. Hi @Nsheppard01, actually there is a way to generate a reduced palette from this menu: http://imgur.com/IfrVyfd\n. Hi @kyrieru, I'm not sure how are you copying frames, are you using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V? I've to review the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V in the same document. You might find a more accurate behavior using the drag-and-drop operation to copy frames. http://www.aseprite.org/docs/copy-frames/\n. There is a crash related to copy & paste frames in the same sprite. I'll see this issue. (There is no known issue at this moment about copying frames using drag-and-drop, only using copy & paste.)\n. Hi @bodhiBit, I always wanted to unify both color selectors. The most \"intuitive\" behavior I thought about, is that when the Palette Editor is visible/enable, color selector/picker edits colors instead of selecting colors/showing warning icon to add colors. In this way we can switch between those two modes (edit/add as you said).\n. > Is there any particular reason to have that many color pickers..?\nJust legacy design decisions.\nI'll be discussing a possible UI design to create the unified color selector. The only thing I'm sure right now is that F4 (\"Edit Palette\") should change the mode in color selectors behaves. E.g. When the \"Edit Palette\" button isn't activated, color selectors should behave as they behave right now. When the \"Edit Palette\" is activated, color selectors should change palette colors.\nThe only problem is to unify RGB and HSB sliders/text entries in the same color-bar widget.\n. Hi @SamanthaeG, are you on Windows using the official version? Could you please send me the crash report?\nAlso, there is a 'data recovery' function you might use to recover your work:\n\n. This will be fixed in v1.2-beta1\n. I think that the best way to do something like that at this moment would be to move a tab at the left/right side which contain those reference images: http://imgur.com/WiXPPgg\n. Maybe related but easier to reproduce in 1.1.5:\n\nIf we move a section that changes the cel position and have transparent pixels at the top/left sides, the undo will not restore it correctly.\n. Known issue. Quite hard to fix. Low priority but still a little annoying.\n. Known issue. Thanks for reporting this with so much details. Actually this issue will be even more visible in the next release where we can enable layer edges:\n\n. This issue is related to #559, after we edit a layer, we should automatically trim pixels.\n. The commit 5d8af3ca36b996219b72d0313134612440755acb fixed the \"buggy\" part of this issue. Which means that now we can make files smaller manually erasing pixels (because cels will be get smaller and smaller). But there is no command to remove/crop all unseen areas automatically. That should be a new command. \n. This might be related to #804\n. Here the problem is that Save Copy As uses the Resize command and then undo it to restore the sprite. I think this could be temporally fixed activating the nonlinear history:\n\nThe \"real\" fix is commented here\n. I'll try to take a look at this issue right now.\n. I was thinking about this too. Maybe a little floppy disk (like in Word or Excel) that appears when the background backup is being made (i.e. the document is locked). Also the dialog box could be replaced with a (less invasive) tooltip.\n. Thanks for this @dvlpstrcrispin \n. Hi @trollworkout, do you have a crash report? They contain a stack trace which are really helpful to fix this kind of problems.\n. Are you updating the /data directory inside Aseprite.app bundle? The compilation process correctly copies the data/ directory in build/bin/data, but here I think you are doing a manual step, copying the aseprite binary inside the bundle, but not updating the data.\n. Ok, please close the issue if you find a solution.\n. Hi @KarurosuBG, did you download the full source code? Instructions: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/INSTALL.md#get-the-source-code\n. Hi @KarurosuBG, contact me at support@aseprite.org\n. Dev Note: I'll leave this for v1.2-beta3, as it requires a ExportSpriteSheetWindow refactor to reuse the DocumentExporter to calculate the sprite sheet size, etc. Some work was already done.\n. Hi @PixelScum, do you mean that when you pick a color with eyedropper the color is given as RGB but you would prefer HSB? That is possible using this option in the context bar:\n\nAnyway I'm not sure if that is exactly what you are looking for.\n. Thanks @KasumiArai for the help with this one\n. Hi @KasumiArai, this bug is already fixed in my local copy (originally reported here: https://twitter.com/Legacydev_/status/728537736550944772) It's a regression introduced when we switched the clipboard management to the clip library to support OS X copy/paste.\nThe problem only appears when Windows is running on 32bpp. It's because Windows doesn't include alpha/transparent information in the image. If you paste the image on MSPaint, copy it again, the image is converted to 24bpp an then you will be able to paste the screenshot on Aseprite.\nReference commit 160418daeade414c89509ac9c3845d9df4708261\n. Hi @Cerno-b, I remember when I was implementing this, I think the max(dx,dy) feels a little weird in some cases (maybe too hard to make the selection smaller). Then I look at Photoshop and see that they use min(dx,dy). Maybe it's time to review this.\n. Hi @trollworkout, are you on Windows, OS X, or Linux? where are you trying to create a folder and with what name?\n. Thanks for the hint @trollworkout, I'll write something about this in the FAQ.\n. I think I'll add a little check in the program to show an alert dialog if the ~/.config is not a directory.\n. Finally I've changed the configuration folder to ~/Library/Application Support/Aseprite (#1165) so this issue is fixed in other way (I guess \ud83d\ude05 )\n. Thanks for the details @Cerno-b, I've implemented this for the next release v1.1.5.3\n. @Cerno-b it's already available ^_^ (v1.1.5.4 is the latest version available)\n. Hi @Ashedragon, are you using the Allegro back-end or skia back-end? Could you please give a try to the Skia back-end to see if this issue is fixed (the Allegro back-end is the default one in the compilation process because it makes it easier to compile Aseprite, but it will be removed in a near future because a lot of other issues are fixed with the Skia back-end)\n. @Ashedragon it looks like depot_tools is prepared for x64 architectures, would you like to try replacing the ninja.exe executable with the x86 version? https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases\n. OK, I'll close this issue, we can reopen this in case that it appears with the Skia back-end. :+1:\n. This should be fixed with: cee3c246bbf0b81841b58c5c1f2ec219490a0f42 and c12100dedb28e96dcdd399a12e146c532ff75fee\n. Hi @dylanaco, are you on Windows, OS X, or Linux (a specific distribution)?\n. As a side note, Aseprite cannot be updated from Aseprite itself, you must download the new version manually. The only way to keep Aseprite automatically updated is using the Steam version or the itch.io app (which I've tested it yet anyway).\n. @dylanaco Aseprite uses the default web browser associated with http protocol (like running start http://www.google.com/ on the command line)\n. Do you have a default web browser configured?\n. That is a system wide configuration. The default web browsers configured on Windows. You can test your default browser pressing Windows key + R and enter a URL like http://www.google.com\n. OK. I'll close this issue, we can re-open it if after you configure a default browser it still happens.\n. This issue looks like already fixed in v1.1.6.\n. Hi @acter, sorry, I don't understand this issue. Is the compilation process still running?\n. Hi @yuigoto, it looks like Visual Studio 2013 doesn't include uint32_t by default. You could try to install Visual Studio 2015 to see if you can compile this.\n. Hi @kinow, actually this is an expected behavior, you can add frames to displace cels. The duplication is done just copying cels at the right side.\n. Hi @kinow thanks for giving a try to this. Anyway I would prefer the current behavior as it is (it might have a configuration setting in the future or more commands to displace cels, for people who want to displace cels instead of replacing.) As I said before, you can add/duplicate frames using Frame > New Frame menu (Alt+N keyboard shortcut).\n. Hi @paulguy, next time you got stuck with the eyedropper tool, please try to press and release the Alt key, I suspect that it might be the cause (i.e. the program never received an event that the Alt key was released).\n. Note: this issue should be fixed with the new back-end on Linux #139 \n. On other platforms (e.g. Windows), this can happen if we assign a key like as a shortcut for eyedropper (quick).\n. Hi @Mailaender, actually we already distribute a.desktopfile with the Aseprite.deb` package. I'll merge this anyway (to fix future duplicate issues e.g. #952). And then add merge your .desktop with my own.\nWould you like to sign our CLA?\n. Thanks @Mailaender\n. I've pushed a (possible) fix for this issue. In case someone want to give it a try.\n. About this one. The idea is that is_same_pixel shouldn't be compiled in the generic case (it's specialized for every type ImageTraits). What compiler is giving the warning? Does it give a warning for convert_to too?\n. OK, I'll merge it, I guess convert_to doesn't require the same return statement because its return value is a template parameter.\n. Thanks, I'll merge this too\n. The next official release (v1.1.10, skia back-end) should not have this issue.\nI'll close this issue because it's related to the deprecated Allegro back-end (v0.9.5, or v1.1.9-dev with Allegro)\n. Hi @winterheart, those tests shouldn't be compiled with the she library. I think we should fix that problem first.\n. Yes, I think that might be a possible solution (to overwrite the given BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON), because our libraries must be compiled statically.\n. Fixed, this will be included in v1.2-beta1\n. Hi @kloworks, do you mean something like this: https://twitter.com/aseprite/status/738412076473946112\n. I'm not sure about this one, but I'll leave this issue open to know how to implement the UI.\nActually you can select a whole range of cels, right-click and select \"Link\" to achieve something similar:\n\n. Hi @SolarLune, I recommend you to use the Ellipses tool for bigger shapes:\n\n. I close it for you ;)\n. Hi @JosefKuchar, no I'm not working on this in case you want to take a look at this issue.\n. @JosefKuchar as a note, I think this option should be inside Edit > FX > Noise menu\n. Already an user is working on this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TackRadGames/status/1058527300449378305\nhttps://el-falso.itch.io/aseprite-lua-scripts. Hi @alexander-b, are you on Windows, OS X, or Linux?\n. This problem happens on RGB images (not in Indexed images). I'll try to fix this for v1.1.\n. Hi @DeVoePack, are you on Windows or OS X?\n\nOn Windows you have to do something like this:\n@set PATH=\"C:\\Program Files\\Aseprite\";%PATH%\nOr\n@set PATH=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Aseprite\";%PATH%\nOn OS X:\nexport PATH=/Applications/Aseprite.app/Contents/MacOS/:$PATH\nIn case that you've used the official installers. On Steam the locations are different:\nC:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Aseprite\n~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Aseprite/Aseprite.app/Contents/MacOS\n. Quite complex problem to solve (mainly for bigger brushes)\n. Hi @RussellSprouts, you can already export tags information in JSON data using the CLI: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/cli/#list-tags\nI hope it helps!\n. Hi @RussellSprouts, what version are you using? Here is an example of JSON output:\n{ \"frames\": { ... },\n \"meta\": {\n  ...,\n  \"frameTags\": [\n   { \"name\": \"walk\", \"from\": 0, \"to\": 2, \"direction\": \"forward\" },\n   { \"name\": \"run\", \"from\": 3, \"to\": 4, \"direction\": \"forward\" }\n  ]\n }\n}\n. You're welcome! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Hi @Kiloku, actually you can do something like that using the Move tool when several layers are selected in the Timeline: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/move-tool/#move-multiple-cels\n. Yeah, that's true and that's is why I didn't close the issue \ud83d\ude05  I'm just working in something (#454) that might enable this Ctrl+click behavior to select multiple non-adjacent layers (as layer groups needs new special ways to handle the layer selection).\n. Implemented, this will be included in the next v1.2-beta2\n. Hi @winterheart, I'll merge this PR and make some changes after that. Thanks!\n. Hi @KasumiArai, I think it's related to the whitespace in \"Run Cycle\", could you please try to use a RunCycle tag and see if it works?\nAs a side note, the --split-tags will be available in v1.2 first beta (already working in my local copy). Also there will be an automatic --split-layer/tags when --save-as is used with something like --save-as my-file-{layer}-{tag}.gif\n. Sorry @KasumiArai, my mistake. This will work on v1.2 beta1. I'm think that I'll release a beta on Steam without layer groups so I people can start testing this earlier.\n. Hi @KasumiArai, I've included this checkbox:\n\n. Hi @ranmaru90, it looks like the cmake command was executed correctly, did you try executing ninja aseprite after that? (the third step in the compiling section)\n. It looks like the cmake command used your mingw installation instead of VS2015, you might try to remove mingw from the PATH or use cmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" and then nmake aseprite instead of ninja\n. I thought that there were an issue related to this (as this feature was requested before), but I didn't find it. I would like this for v1.2.\n. Ohh themes! your comment makes me remember that I've a patch for this UI that I forgot.\nThis UI requires a redesign (related to #712). Themes should be separated between \"official\" and \"user\" themes, and the Open Folder button should be replaced with other buttons to open each theme folder, or official/user folders. Also we should be able to copy a theme to the \"user\" folder. I'll see if this can be available for v1.1.7.\n. Related to #518 and #1052\n. Hi @lrtvri! You gave me a simple idea for a first draft of this feature. I'll be try to add something really simple for next v1.1.\n. \n. This issue should be fixed with 19545c12e3d47b9b6a31f91f5e083d4847890aaf and native cursors on OS X ( 162cee28704ee052341334cfd763e87a0b82ec52 ) and Windows ( 507e0f152b2f49a7434d5d8c5e93b33489b74d77 )\n. Related: this discussion and this\n. It shouldn't have been closed, but maybe @panteleevnikita wanted to close it.. I'll reopen this one\n. Hi @xSke, MinGW isn't supported. Only Visual Studio 2015 is used to compile the Windows version (I think MinGW isn't supported on Skia too). \n. Hi @davidtme, not at this moment, but I'll try to add this to v1.2.\n. This will be released on v1.2-beta2\n. It looks like Paint of Persia is making some noise in these days :smile:\n. This feature might be related to #532, I personally think that a better technique for rotoscoping might be something like what licecap does: We should be able to capture a chunk of screen/video and convert it as a \"overlay image as reference\" for our animation.\n. See #970\n. Hi @zed9h, could this use the same png encoder/decoder to avoid duplicating the whole code? I see that it opens an XML file and a png file, so to load the png file you might try to use the png decoder (or calling load_document() to load the png file as a temporal doc::Sprite/app::Document).\nAlso could you please sign our CLA?\n. I'll take a look at this on next Tuesday. At the moment I recommend you to use load_document() if it's possible, so we can avoid modifying the actual png encoder/decoder (the code review from my side would be too much work if you refactor the code).\nYou can use Document* tmpDoc = load_document(nullptr, pngfilename) to \"subload\" the png file, and save_document(nullptr, tmpDoc) to save the png file.\n. @zed9h Remember that there is an email required in the CLA signing process too.\n. As a side note, I'll need several .anim files to test these routines (original files generated with Pixly), because I don't have an Android device and cannot install Pixly. You can send me some test files at support@aseprite.org (I'll add them into an internal test suite I use for decoders/encoders)\n. Mhh, I think it's a bug in the code that check conditions in file.cpp. I'll be working in a fix for this so FILE*PALETTE* flags are checked only for Indexed images. (But I've to think more about those situations.)\nThe FILE_SUPPORT_BIG_PALETTES is in case the file format can save a color palette with more than 256 colors.\nYou can leave the flags and I'll then modify when the fix is done. Don't worry about that.\n. Finally I got a crash saving this file:\n\nCould you please check this issue?\n. Returning to this one: I'll finally remove FILE_SUPPORT_BIG_PALETTES and FILE_SUPPORT_PALETTE_WITH_ALPHA flags from .anim format as this format doesn't support these features (and the user must be warned that the palette will be lost). I've added the new issue #1182 how to fix the issues commented here.\n. > BTW, I didn't explain it properly here, the \"collums\" (sic) are on the official Pixly format, nothing I could do about it\n\ud83d\udc4d   yeah, that's what I thought\n. Hi @alivegames, are you on Windows?\n. You can use regedit and set HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.png default value to AsepriteFile (you can check HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.ase to see an example). I can record you a little video-tutorial in a couple of days in case you don't know how to edit the registry with regedit.\n. You're welcome \ud83d\ude09 \n. About the observable directory, it's because you have to do a git submodule update --init as a new submodule is in the repository.\n. Anyway I'll apply this PR as a patch.\n. Merged as a patch 99bd10dfbdb9d2579d57f0640db9526a988e6a2d\n. The second issue is duplicated from #1006. For the mouse lag you can check this issue #957\n. Please follow #1006. Hi @JosefKuchar this problem was already reported here: #1049, I'll try to find a solution for next v1.1.6\n. There are some methods like this one: http://superuser.com/a/460648/85654\nAnyway I'll release a new version soon with the fix.\n. @JosefKuchar please give a try to the new v1.1.6 to check if it fixes this issue\n. @JosefKuchar it's only fixed on the skia back-end (as the fix needs a special WinMain function)\n. Hi @OrenjiAkira, actually I don't include Skia as a submodule because these two reasons:\n1. We use cmake and Skia uses gyp. There is some work going on to compile Skia with cmake, but it's experimental so I didn't give it a try yet. Even more, they use their own depot_tools (to sync sub-dependencies, building, etc.).\n2. Skia is too big and I prefer to keep it outside the Aseprite compilation. (Skia depends on clang and llvm, huge dependencies, it takes a long time to clone the whole repository.)\nAlso big dependencies make the day-to-day compilation slower. So we should try to avoid adding more dependencies in third_party/ directory. Anyway thanks for commenting about this issue \ud83d\ude09 \n. Actually there is a step by step guide in INSTALL.md to compile Skia on Windows and OS X (which could be converted into a .bat or .sh files I guess). The Linux version isn't there because there are no Skia port on Linux yet, but I'll add it soon.\n. This will be available in the next release. The only thing I have to think about now is a way to target filters/effects that modify color (like \"Invert\" or this new \"Hue/Saturation\") to pixels or to the color palette. For example, by default, it looks like this Hue/Saturation feature should modify pixels on RGB sprites, but should modify palette entries on Indexed sprites. Or if we are in an indexed image with an active pixels selection, the filter should modify pixels instead of palette entries.. Hi @zed9h! Thanks for taking a try to this issue. It will take me some time to review these PRs. Anyway I'll try to make some comments in a quick glance now and then review it in more detail.\nAbout the UI, the popup is pretty close to what I was looking for (before the preview on the same 'Preview' window). I like it so far. On the other side, the preview on the same timeline should be configurable with a separated option or automatically enabled when I add an option in the future to make timeline boxes bigger. I'm not sure about the eye in the same Timeline, I think the thumbnails options might be visible in the timeline configuration popup here:\n\nAnd we could add a new Command to switch the preview status (a command similar to ShowOnionSkinCommand).\nP.S. I got a crash (an assert failed) when a thumbnail (maybe alpha != 255) was going to be pop-upped (on drawCelOverlay):\nThread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n0   libsystem_kernel.dylib          0x00007fff98b82f06 __pthread_kill + 10\n1   libsystem_pthread.dylib         0x00007fff8d04d4ec pthread_kill + 90\n2   libsystem_c.dylib               0x00007fff927556e7 abort + 129\n3   aseprite                        0x0000000104d2a420 base_assert(char const*, char const*, int) + 1040 (debug.cpp:51)\n4   aseprite                        0x0000000104277e4b doc::ImageBits<doc::RgbTraits>::ImageBits(doc::Image*, gfx::RectT<int> const&) + 171 (image_bits.h:37)\n5   aseprite                        0x0000000104277d95 doc::ImageBits<doc::RgbTraits>::ImageBits(doc::Image*, gfx::RectT<int> const&) + 37 (image_bits.h:39)\n6   aseprite                        0x0000000104277cf7 doc::ImageBits<doc::RgbTraits> doc::Image::lockBits<doc::RgbTraits>(doc::Image::LockType, gfx::RectT<int> const&) const + 39 (image.h:60)\n7   aseprite                        0x00000001043af359 doc::LockImageBits<doc::RgbTraits>::LockImageBits(doc::Image const*, gfx::RectT<int> const&) + 41 (image_bits.h:119)\n8   aseprite                        0x00000001043af185 doc::LockImageBits<doc::RgbTraits>::LockImageBits(doc::Image const*, gfx::RectT<int> const&) + 37 (image_bits.h:119)\n9   aseprite                        0x00000001046ac28c void doc::algorithm::image_scale_tpl<doc::RgbTraits, unsigned int (*)(unsigned int, unsigned int)>(doc::Image*, doc::Image const*, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, unsigned int (*)(unsigned int, unsigned int)) + 172 (rotate.cpp:49)\n10  aseprite                        0x00000001046abf91 doc::algorithm::scale_image(doc::Image*, doc::Image const*, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int) + 433 (rotate.cpp:128)\n11  aseprite                        0x00000001045ccd32 app::Timeline::drawCelOverlay(ui::Graphics*, doc::LayerIndex, int) + 1714 (timeline.cpp:1637)\n12  aseprite                        0x00000001045c81a0 app::Timeline::onPaint(ui::PaintEvent&) + 3824 (timeline.cpp:1061)\n13  aseprite                        0x00000001047e9029 ui::Widget::paintEvent(ui::Graphics*) + 569 (widget.cpp:1007)\n14  aseprite                        0x00000001047ea832 ui::Widget::onProcessMessage(ui::Message*) + 978 (widget.cpp:1307)\n15  aseprite                        0x00000001045c20f6 app::Timeline::onProcessMessage(ui::Message*) + 12342 (timeline.cpp:920)\n16  aseprite                        0x00000001047e95aa ui::Widget::sendMessage(ui::Message*) + 106 (widget.cpp:1109)\n17  aseprite                        0x00000001047ba083 ui::Manager::pumpQueue() + 1283 (manager.cpp:1331)\n18  aseprite                        0x00000001047b4e09 ui::Manager::dispatchMessages() + 25 (manager.cpp:584)\n19  aseprite                        0x00000001047ca8a3 ui::MessageLoop::pumpMessages() + 83 (message_loop.cpp:29)\n20  aseprite                        0x00000001047b52ac ui::Manager::run() + 140 (manager.cpp:167)\n21  aseprite                        0x0000000104260aa4 app::App::run() + 404 (app.cpp:695)\n22  aseprite                        0x00000001042572ce app_main(int, char**) + 878 (main.cpp:85)\n23  aseprite                        0x000000010480402d main + 125 (she.cpp:83)\n24  aseprite                        0x0000000104256f54 start + 52\n. About the thumbnail, it shouldn't be inside the doc::Image. It's better if it's a completely separated structure/class that only handle thumbnails. It might be separated from the Timeline with a nice API to access and update thumbnails. Also this cache object should be able to destroy thumbnails automatically using a document observer.\n. > you think it should be on App, listen to the modification of Cel images and automatically generate the thumbs, even if they were not seen yet, or the Timeline should request the App to create them on demand?\nThe Timeline should request to the cache that it requires a new thumbnail, the App should know almost nothing about the thumbnail cache (the App controls only the lifetime of the cache), but you can request the cache object from the App instance/singleton. I'll check the latest changes.\n. > one thing I was not sure were if I had to call doc()->notifyGeneralUpdate() on every change callback\nThe general update notification is used to know if the document/sprite/model structure has changed. In this case it shouldn't be necessary to call it because we're changing UI configuration only.\n\nand also don't know if I had to use migrate on the pref.xml.\n\nThe migrate field is used to migrate old field names to new ones, so you shouldn't use them for new configuration fields/options.\n\nPS: I did a ShowCelPreviewThumbCommand and placed on F6 (close to the ShowOnionSkin on F3)\n\nThinking about this one, why we don't call the whole thing \"timeline thumbnails\" instead of \"cel previews\"? In this way the thumbnails could be appear for cels, frames, and layers. So the \"cel_preview\" section in pref.xml could be called just \"thumbnails\".\n. About the Thumb and Zoom terms in the UI and preference variables (without checking out the code and seeing the UI) I'm not sure what does they mean.\n. > How should I notify the timeline to update the thumbnails?\nIt looks like the Timeline should listen to changes in the thumbnails preferences. See that the thumbnails is something in the UI layer, nothing to do with the sprite model (\"doc\" namespace), e.g. a general update notification would redraw the sprite editor, which isn't required when we switch the thumbnails configuration (only the timeline depends on thumbnails configuration).\nHere you might start listening changes in docPref.thumbnails/docPref.celPreview pref section, and here you might disconnect the signal slots (use a base::ScopedConnection for this).\n. I'll make some general comments now and leave a full review for the next week so you can work on this:\n1. The cache class should be in other file (TimelineThumbnailsCache, timeline_thumbnails_cache.cpp/h or something similar). I've a pending refactor for the Timeline to put the whole implementation in a  src/app/ui/timeline/, but that will be for a future version.\n2. Try to avoid exposing the cache class functionality/internal implementation to the timeline as much as possible. The best cache API would be something like cache.getThumbnail(cel) or cache.setThumbnail(cel) (I'm not sure if the Timeline should know more than that about the cache.)\n3. You can use the Object::version() field to know if the thumbnail should be regenerated.\n4. The DocSurfaceCacheRecentlyUsed is a std::multimap, is this needed? I see the code quickly and the map is not accessed by the key (timestamp). I think you are using this to sort items by timestamp (but it looks like the order is not guaranteed)\n. > I saw that the documents are managed at UIContext, so is it OK to place the cache class as a member of it? Then I can addObserver on it to listen to removeDocument (to clean the document), as well as onChange of the thumbnail prefs, and I was thinking in use the context's onActiveSiteChange to (clean the cel being drawn), but it may not be necessary with the version.\nIf the cache is inside the UIContext you don't even need to observe the context (the UIContext can should be able to update the cache from UIContext::onRemoveDocument). Anyway I'm not 100% sure, but you can give a try and put the cache inside IUContext instead of App.\n\nThe only thing I was not sure were if the cache should generate the surface, or if it should be timeline and just store on the cache.\n\nSame here :smile: I added the setThumbnail() just because the Timeline knows the configuration to generate the thumbnail, but the generation might be in the timeline, in the cache, or even other specific function/class to do so.\n\nBut your suggestion gave me an idea, to index the cache by thumb size as well, so it could be safely used by anyone.\n\nOK, in case you create a generic thumbnails cache for doc::Objects you can give it a generic name without Timeline on it (i.e. just Thumbnails). And I can rename the current ThumbnailGenerator into something else like FSThumbnails.\n\n\n4) The DocSurfaceCacheRecentlyUsed is a std::multimap, is this needed? I see the code quickly and the map is not accessed by the key (timestamp). I think you are using this to sort items by timestamp (but it looks like the order is not guaranteed)\n\nThe order is guaranteed, just not necessarily the stable ordering (items of the same timestamp to be always ordered the same way). Also not sure I required a multimap, but the semantics seemed right.\n\nOK. Anyway if you can avoid using a multimap that would be better (as it's not used in other places in the code; you might try a map, a priority_queue, or just sort).\n. One final thing about this (them I'll review this next week): I think we should remove the quality parameter, or at least, remove the \"rot sprite\" possibility to create thumbnails. Mainly because \"rot sprite\" is really slow and uses a lot of memory and it'll be a real issue for big sprites (try editing 2048x2048 opaque sprites and see the performance of thumbnails when they are generated).\nA personal recommendation: You could leave this PR just to add thumbnails into the Timeline, the thumbnails cache can be added them in a future PR. (Also I'd like to work on that merging the current thumbnail generation with a new one for documents/layers/cels, with the possibility to generate thumbnails on a background thread in an async way.)\n. > I will draw a diagram to explain the design decisions and then we discuss naming and this layered structure (btw, I avoided using Layer and instead used Tier to avoid further confusion).\nThere is no need for a diagram, just a little explanation why the hierarchy and each class is needed is enough. As I see it, it looks like removing the whole hierarchy and virtual methods the code still works (I might be wrong).\n. Please see that I'm reviewing this PR without seeing the other ones. I prefer to manage this in simple PRs. So we'll first try to clean-up this one, and then advance over the other PRs.\n. I was testing the UI. It looks a little messy. Anyway I think we could merge the PR soon in a separate branch and then we can work more in the UI aspect.\n. About thumbnails.h, the content of the file could be something like this:\n```\nifndef APP_THUMBNAILS_H_INCLUDED\ndefine APP_THUMBNAILS_H_INCLUDED\npragma once\ninclude \"gfx/rect.h\"\nnamespace doc {\n  class Cel;\n}\nnamespace she {\n  class Surface;\n}\nnamespace app {\n  namespace thumb {\nshe::Surface* get_thumbnail(const doc::Cel* cel, const gfx::Rect& bounds);\n\n} // thumb\n} // app\nendif\n```\nYou can get the app::Document from the cel (cel->sprite()->document())\n. Applying this patch with git apply generates some warnings:\n```\n1187.patch:596: trailing whitespace.\n1187.patch:842: trailing whitespace.\n      thumb_img, image, \n1187.patch:844: trailing whitespace.\n      0, \n1187.patch:949: trailing whitespace.\n      thumb_img, scale_img, \n1187.patch:957: trailing whitespace.\n      x, \nwarning: squelched 55 whitespace errors\nwarning: 60 lines add whitespace errors.\n```\n. Mmh, I think those warnings are about intermediate PATCHs, I'll squash everything and see the final result. Don't worry about my previous comment. \n. Merged in timeline-thumbnails branch. Please @zed9h, check the changes in 942300e3502f195195be4185018a6ba2ec29c765 just to see some minor adjustments I made. \nAlso there are two big issue to solve: \n1. Timeline::drawCelOverlay and app::thumb::get_cel_thumbnail contain duplicate code. Why we cannot use get_cel_thumbnail() on drawCelOverlay?\n2. I've found a crash: create a new image with Ctrl+N, close it with Ctrl+W, create a new image with Ctrl+N\nThread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n0   ???                             0x00007f9012e10010 0 + 140256768753680\n1   aseprite                        0x000000010825c935 app::Timeline::updateUsingEditor(app::Editor*) + 581 (timeline.cpp:226)\n2   aseprite                        0x0000000108282070 app::UIContext::setActiveView(app::DocumentView*) + 560 (ui_context.cpp:108)\n3   aseprite                        0x00000001081d4f69 app::MainWindow::onActiveViewChange() + 57 (main_window.cpp:260)\n4   aseprite                        0x00000001081d79e5 obs::slot0_mem<void, app::MainWindow>::operator()() + 101 (slot.h:115)\n5   aseprite                        0x0000000107ef32d8 obs::signal0<void>::operator()() + 216 (signal.h:207)\n6   aseprite                        0x0000000108278a08 app::Workspace::setActiveView(app::WorkspaceView*) + 184 (workspace.cpp:98)\n7   aseprite                        0x000000010827875d app::Workspace::addViewToPanel(app::WorkspacePanel*, app::WorkspaceView*, bool, int) + 493 (workspace.cpp:264)\n8   aseprite                        0x000000010827855b app::Workspace::addView(app::WorkspaceView*, int) + 59 (workspace.cpp:66)\n9   aseprite                        0x000000010828291d app::UIContext::onAddDocument(doc::Document*) + 301 (ui_context.cpp:199)\n10  aseprite                        0x000000010836c3b6 void obs::observers<doc::DocumentsObserver>::notify_observers<doc::Document*>(void (doc::DocumentsObserver::*)(doc::Document*), doc::Document*) + 374 (observers.h:37)\n11  aseprite                        0x000000010836c22c void obs::observable<doc::DocumentsObserver>::notify_observers<doc::Document*>(void (doc::DocumentsObserver::*)(doc::Document*), doc::Document*) + 92 (observable.h:34)\n12  aseprite                        0x000000010836a13c void base::Observable<doc::DocumentsObserver>::notifyObservers<doc::Document*>(void (doc::DocumentsObserver::*)(doc::Document*), doc::Document*) + 92 (observable.h:35)\n13  aseprite                        0x0000000108367536 doc::Documents::add(doc::Document*) + 918 (documents.cpp:63)\n14  aseprite                        0x0000000108365746 doc::Document::setContext(doc::Context*) + 102 (document.cpp:40)\n15  aseprite                        0x0000000107f90c68 app::NewFileCommand::onExecute(app::Context*) + 3816 (cmd_new_file.cpp:180)\n16  aseprite                        0x0000000107fe02ff app::Command::execute(app::Context*) + 47 (command.cpp:64)\n17  aseprite                        0x0000000108006c46 app::Context::executeCommand(app::Command*, app::Params const&) + 2022 (context.cpp:77)\n18  aseprite                        0x0000000108079983 app::CustomizedGuiManager::onProcessMessage(ui::Message*) + 4579 (gui.cpp:457)\n19  aseprite                        0x000000010848540a ui::Widget::sendMessage(ui::Message*) + 106 (widget.cpp:1109)\n20  aseprite                        0x000000010845636d ui::Manager::pumpQueue() + 1469 (manager.cpp:1344)\n21  aseprite                        0x0000000108451039 ui::Manager::dispatchMessages() + 25 (manager.cpp:584)\n22  aseprite                        0x0000000108466703 ui::MessageLoop::pumpMessages() + 83 (message_loop.cpp:29)\n23  aseprite                        0x00000001084514dc ui::Manager::run() + 140 (manager.cpp:167)\n24  aseprite                        0x0000000107ef08c4 app::App::run() + 404 (app.cpp:695)\n25  aseprite                        0x0000000107ee710e app_main(int, char**) + 878 (main.cpp:85)\n26  aseprite                        0x000000010849ffbd main + 125 (she.cpp:83)\n27  aseprite                        0x0000000107ee6d94 start + 52\n. See #810\n. @thezakman yes, this will be available on v1.2.. Maybe related to #524\n. Hi @HarrievG, I think you are looking for the --split-layers option from the CLI when a sprite sheet is generated with the --sheet option. There is no UI yet for this. And this might be related to #126 and #901\n. Thanks @Mailaender \n. I think I've solved this issue. The problem is that Alt key switches to the eyedropper tool temporally, so the new brush is selected for the eyedropper, which doesn't make sense in the first place. It's strange that it works in one machine and in the other none. Anyway, v1.1.8 will show have this fix.\n. @jameswilddev hi James, actually do you know an open source program that works correctly with Windows precision touchpad? (e.g. Blender, Krita, GIMP, etc.)\n. I think there are a couple of things here:\n1. Be able to select portions of the sprite using right-click (new option in Edit > Preferences > Editor > Right-click)\n2. Be able to select/transform several cels at the same time (#1172) \n. See #371 \n. Hi @JosefKuchar, actually I prefer to use OS X until macOS is more common. Thanks anyway for the patch!\n. See #1102\nActually we've a way to view real-time color changes on Indexed images using the palette editor (F4) with the HSB slider:\n\nBut the problem as you said is that we cannot use the Photoshop-like color selector. On #1102 we should provide an unified way to select color and change palette color.\n. I think the copy & paste issue should be fixed thanks to @zed9h in the next release. About the .pal file format, do you have some of those files? or the format specs?\n. > Slightly related, it'd be nice if import sprite sheet had a \"use grid\" button. I found this while manually keying grid values only to realize the locations of the fields didn't match.\nThe default values in Import Sprite Sheet might be the active grid values.\n. I'd prefer to go in little steps. One PR for one specific thing. First, we should fix the issues in #1187 (e.g. you can create one PR with two commits, one to fix the code duplication, other commit to fix the crash). Then there are some things I'd like to discuss about the UI. (Actually there are too much configuration, e.g. background color for overlay, and I think we can simplify it.) After those changes, we can start adding the cache stuff.\nAs a side note: I squash commits if they don't look \"clean\", or do \"just one thing\", or the PR includes several commits adding and removing the same lines. I don't have a specific style/format for commits, but with a short line for the commit it would be enough. If you have to say \"this commit does x and y\" it means the commit is doing more things that it should (why x and y cannot be separated in one commit for x, and other commit for y?). I generally made that mistake myself, but we should try to avoid adding two or more \"logical\" changes in the same commit (e.g. \"fix issue X, Y, and Z, and refactor some classes\" is something really bad because can introduce several bugs at once).\nOther minor comment: Do not prefix all commits with the branch name (e.g. \"cel-preview\"). The branch name already says what it's about, and when we merge the branch, it's will act like a summary of the all the changes related to \"cel preview\". (Again, these considerations are useful for: 1) it'll be easier for me to review each commit, instead of the all final changes, 2) all commits will be include merging the branch instead of squashing all commits in one big patch).\nP.S. Sorry for all this back and forth in the review process, but I should warned you about the complexity of #152 (not one of the best issues for newcomers). Personally I find quite difficult to implement new features because I have to think about several points: 1) avoid introducing new bugs, 2) avoid UI cluttering, 3) refactor code to avoid complexity, 4) all new merges will be a new chunk of code to be maintained (by myself in the general case).\n. Thanks @zed9h for this. I've merged the change in timeline-thumbnails branch.\n. > - remove the quality option (hardcode the bilinear scaler)\nI would prefer Nearest-neighbor in a first version.\n\n\nreplace the bilinear scaler with a custom box sampling\n\n\nLet's leave this for a future. In my mind, I think thumbnails should be generated in three or four possible sizes as fast as possible with a specific algorithm (e.g. 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128), and when we request a thumbnail, the best-fit should be returned and then resized/scaled when the she::Surface is drawn on the display to the specific size we want (e.g. if we want to draw a 40x40, it might be enough to use the 32x32 thumbnail, or 64x64 thumbnail in case it's already generated).\n\n\nprovide a better feedback about how the overlay would look with the selected settings\n\n\nI would like to remove all kind of configuration about the overlay (even background color). As I'd prefer to show the checked background in the overlay instead of a custom/transparent color.\n\n\nseparate the preferences of the overlay and the thumbnails\n\n\nI would prefer to remove as much configuration as possible. And if something must be configured, I think a global configuration in Edit > Preferences > Timeline would be a better place.\n. Hi @pheuberger, I'll see this PR in these days. About the Columns parameter, Aseprite doesn't process it, anyway it's good to have it in the file (maybe in the future we can load the parameter and adjust the palette view).\n. This palette is a 6-bit RGB palette. This is related to #974, which should offer in a future a way to automatically handle RGB colors with a limited set of bits (6-bit, 12-bit, etc.). Anyway I'll merge this PR because it matches the master system color possibilities.\n. Hi @Beartis, I'll be testing some raw pixels and RLE algorithms to known how git repositories compress data etc. and what would be the best decision.\nThis issue is related to #183 (the redesign of .aseprite format)\n. Hi @Ashedragon, are you using the Skia back-end or the Allegro one?\n. Hi @paulguy, it's as @KasumiArai said.\nOn Aseprite (as on Photoshop) you can have a special \"Background\" layer (and just one) in the sprite, which doesn't allow transparent pixels. In case you want transparent pixels, you need to convert the background to a regular layer (using Layer > Layer from Background option, or right-clicking as @KasumiArai said).\nYou can find more information here: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/layers/#background-layer\n. The same problem is present in the following cases too:\n1. when we delete the cel using Ctrl+A and then Delete key.\n2. or we select all Ctrl+A and cut the selection Ctrl+X\n3. or if we flip an empty area and it delete the whole cel content. \nInternal note: everything that uses cmd::TrimCel might generate this bug.\n. The only \"bad\" side of fixing this issue is that deleting the whole content of a cel (i.e. when the cel is empty), all linked cels will be deleted with it. For example, if we use Ctrl+A and Ctrl+X to cut the whole cel content, all links will disappear.\n. Hi @DaanHaaz, as @zed9h, linked cels is the way to modify several pixels in several frames at the same time. Linked cels are created in continuous layers, originally from #99 \n. Hi @nobuyukinyuu sorry I missed this one. I'll take note about this issue on my to-do list to see it soon.. What I'm seeing is that test.ase file uses index 5 (which is out of the palette range). You should use index 0 for the background/transparent color. Here I attached an fixed version.\ntest.ase.zip\n. Hi @SolarLune, actually Aseprite opens sprite in the current instance (at least on Windows and OS X). What OS are you using? what Aseprite version?\n. I've just reopen #477 to add Linux support\n. This issue is related to #1100, and I've just added this new issue #1219\n. Hi @numanair, what OS are you using? Windows? Linux? or OS X?\n. Did you compile it with the Allegro back-end or Skia back-end?\n. Hi @zed9h, sorry that I wasn't able to review these PRs yet. I'm trying to finish the layer groups feature and continue with this after that.\n. Hi @zed9h I'll review these PRs and the timeline branch soon, I'll try to merge all this in the beta branch.\n. I've just merged timeline-thumbnails branch (8b9c5f4f27e4b57ae5a7b1a2321256c7bd4e1bfe) and this PR (b41ad4dd2133649fe0359b710324c29ee3343044) I'll review the rendering code this week to see those crashes/issues you was having. I'm going to the next PR now.\n. Good ideas here that I was thinking off: +1 keeping the linked-cels indicators, +1 smaller width on layer eyes/padlock. It was quite hard to make the merge of both PRs+beta \ud83d\ude05  but I think everything is merged correctly (please tell me if you find something wrong).\nFrom now on all future work can be done in beta branch (I'll remove the timeline-thumbnails branch). I'll create issues about this new timeline so we know what can be fixed/improved from here, and you can know if I'm working in something related to this.\n. Merged here 8da12cde1ddee4b7b6d8fc0aa9cde31b9227d89f\n. This issue + #1157 will give us the possibility to select multiple (non-adjacent) layers and merge them.\nMore discussion here: https://community.aseprite.org/t/wish-flatten-selected-layers/163. Flatten will merge selected layers in the timeline if the range is enabled (the thick border in the timeline) or merge all layers if there is no thick border in the timeline. We'll be able to flat just one group too and a new menu option Layer > Flatten Visible Layers was added too.. It looks like cmake isn't detecting the ninja version, it says The detected version of Ninja () is less than the version of Ninja required by CMake (1.3), the ninja version should be inside the parenthesis ().\n. You might try to download the latest ninja release and try compiling Aseprite again in a new/fresh/clean/empty build dir.\n. @a00958821 did the latest ninja version fix this issue?\n. @KasumiArai Are you on a 16-bit screen resolution?\n. I'll take a look at this issue tomorrow\n. I was able to reproduce the issue, I'll take this one.\n. @KasumiArai you're welcome! these bug reports related to clipboard issues are of great help to improve the clip open source project (which can be used by other developers, so it's nice to be able to test the code in different environments). So basically, thank you! \ud83d\ude04 \n. @Entropy125 you can +1 the issue (generally I sort issues by the number of \ud83d\udc4d  to see what would be nice to implement next)\n. Related to #707 and #1102 \n. This will be available in the next release.. Hi @gcmartijn \nOn the case of --split-layers, the option must be used before specifying the .ase file. I'm not sure if the option is well documented, here or here, the documentation says:\n\nImport each layer of the next given sprite as a separated image in the sheet\n\nAnd\n\nSplits the next document layers\n\n\nAs a side note, I saw that you've used the --shape-padding argument without a <value>, that option must be used with an integer value (e.g. --shape-padding 2 to add a padding of 2). It needs better documentation (in the Options section it's more clear the extra <value> parameter).\n\nAbout the --format json-array, I'm not sure what's happening in that one, I'll test this tomorrow. Anyway you can give a try to the beta branch on Steam, it has a --preview parameter to print/show/check what Aseprite will do on the console.\n. Sorry for this back and forth @Mailaender, this weekend I've decided to remove GPL license with a the EULA for Aseprite which is incompatible with Linux distributions. Soon I'll publish my thoughts about this.\n. I'll investigate the possibility to distribute an AppImage so we can release one package for all distributions.\n. @probonopd thanks for the help with this one, I'll take a look at it on Monday and see if I can start packaging it as an AppImage next week.\n. Thanks for this bug report @KasumiArai, I'm just modifying these operations for v1.2 (with layers groups). I think it will need a special patch for v1.1 anyway.\n. Hi @oxysoft! is it 6~8 millisecond delay? That looks even better than one frame drop at 60 FPS.\nI suppose that if the program is unusable the delay must be bigger than that. Do you have a high-DPI mouse or a pen? What screen resolution are you using? Would you like to try other Screen Scaling factor in Edit > Preferences > General > Screen Scaling option? Or reducing the window size?\n. > edit: I might add also that there seems to be pretty severe cursor tearing, it just goes invisible when I move it really fast\nYes, UI drawing message events (i.e. drawing the mouse cursor) are not processed immediately so we can give more priority to mouse input events (in case that there are mouse events in the events queue).\nIn any case, I see some problems with this issue:\n1. we could use native cursors for everything, but one of the most important aspect of Aseprite (the crosshair cursor/brush preview) would be lost\n2. if we add an option to disable the crosshair, it would be the same for the drawing process, the screen must be updated to show the painted area \n3. we have plans to change the painting processing into a background task, so mouse input can be as fast as you want while a background task consume those input\nAnyway, I don't find this issue a high-priority (someone rarely will need to move the mouse faster than 60fps to paint pixel-art), but I'll try to add some options to completely disable the crosshair or try to find a fix to this in other ways.\nMeanwhile, could you please record a video with the delay, and drawing in the sprite editor (e.g. moving the mouse at different velocities)? I suspect that the delay should be higher than you might think. Also what CPU are you using?\n. @theFroh hi there! yes, that is the first point in my previous comment, the problem is that the crosshair cursor/brush preview cannot be solved with custom hardware/native cursors \ud83d\ude22 \nMy long term plan is to use shaders for the crosshair cursor, there are some steps/tasks:\n1. Use custom hardware/native cursors instead of a software overlay\n2. Add an option to disable the crosshair cursor and use a native cursor alternative\n3. Use shaders to replicate the current crosshair cursor\n4. Use a background renderer to update the brush preview and send a signal to the Editor when it's ready to paint in the screen\n. > Also note that when moving the canvas around with middle mouse button, it lags intensely. I'm not sure if that's related but that's also unacceptable.\nYour CPU looks quite good, so it's strange what you are experiencing. I'm suspecting of other thing... maybe some other program is generating more mouse events than necessary or is interfering with the regular behavior of Aseprite, e.g. there are drivers that generate constant mouse events on Windows (years ago I got some bug reports where Aseprite behaves slow but after restarting the machine it just run smoothly). Check the CPU usage of other processes (just in case) in the Window Task Manager while you use Aseprite.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"crosshair cursor/brush preview cannot be solved with custom hardware/native cursors\"?\n\nTake a look:\n\nThe crosshair could be replaced with a simple custom native cursor (anyway we'd lose the black/white negative with it), but the brush preview is impossible to be replaced (as it uses the same Editor render engine/active tool/ink configuration to show the preview).\n. > This way, you have the OS' native cursor rendering on top and the preview rendering below.\nYes (my second point here), anyway the brush preview will still have the same delay.\n\nAlso if it can be of any use, when I open a window like the preference window, and I move it around, there are some problems...\n\nYeah, I'd expect all kind of problems moving the mouse in this scenario.\nJust to check, you might try to disable the brush preview (uncheck View > Show > Brush Preview option). It might improve a little bit the performance, but not an huge difference.\n. > I wasn't actually testing the mouse delay on a canvas, I was on the home tab with the main cursor so it's irrelevant. The delay is there even on the home tab when there is no preview!!\nI got it, just saying if you wanna to give it a try.\nI'll try to experiment with some changes next week with this issue.\n. Some news about this issue:\n1. Now we use native custom cursors on Windows and OS X\n2. We have new options for cursors:\n\n. Hi there, you've to enable the \"Contiguous\" checkbox:\n\n. Related to #1172\n. I've found this error message too (maybe because the palette is too small):\n\nI'll fix this right now.\n. @jameswilddev at this moment padding doesn't work when we pack the sheet. I'll see if I can do something about this issue.\n. I'll try to take a look at this issue for next release (which I hope to release this week).\nAs a side note: I think this bug is a recurrent \"regression\" (a bug that re-appear time by time). I'll start preparing a testing suite to avoid this kind of regression. Thanks for reporting!\n. Hi @cookiengineer, thanks for creating this. I'm writing a blog post about this and I'll post the link here soon.\n. I've just posted comments about this in the Aseprite devblog: http://dev.aseprite.org/post/149797781837/new-source-code-license\n. @davexunit actually there is already a fork in https://github.com/aseprite-gpl/aseprite and sorry to make you feel oppressed \ud83d\ude22 \n. @davexunit yes, I think Linux distributions could start using the new fork (I think I might help in the fork in some near future too, e.g. to keep compatibility between .ase file format). Please remember my advices in the blog post: http://dev.aseprite.org/post/149797781837/new-source-code-license\n. As a side note, I've just sent an email to contributors in case they want their changes outside this repository. I know I could use the CLA to sublicense the changes, but the CLA wasn't originally made for this (my original idea was just to create an iPhone/iPad version, because the Apple Store doesn't allow GPL code).\n. Thanks for your words @MarcoEstevez \n. > the only real misstep here was not mentioning that the license would be changing some time in advance\nHi @oceanhahn, you are right. It was my mistake to not ask contributors about the license change.\n\nWhy not have a dual licensed model in aseprite with a popup on first start?\n- GPL for free software users that want to create an open source game.\n- EULA and paid license option for guys that want to build a paid game or app with it.\n\nHi @cookiengineer, that seems like a good idea. Anyway as I said in my post, I don't agree anymore with the GPL.\n\nGoing proprietary seems like an excessive reaction to a potentially fixable problem.\n\nHi @eska014, I agree with everything you said. The only thing is that I've changed my mind about GPL in these days. And the problems are described in the post in the \"So why not GPL?\".\n\nStill I disagree that Linux users do not contribute at all. As Linux user, I made some small improvements in build subsystem to make benefits to all platforms.\n\nHi @winterheart, I think that Linux programmers (let say, Linux users that can program) are of great help. They are the best. The issue I'm seeing is that Linux distributions do not make a way that regular end-users (let's say non-programmers) can give useful information to fix problems.\nAnd finally thanks to all the kind words.\n. > so why care about those users at all, who are not programmers and will not contribute to your work anyway?\nHi @jarfil, in that case users at least know that \"there is a cost.\" It's not just \"free\" to get the program. You pay for it, or you compile it, or you get it in some \"ilegal\" way (which is another kind of \"cost\" in case he/she wants to take the risk). Linux distributions remove that \"cost\" completely, giving the sensation that software is like something \"disposable\" (no cost, no consequences). Thanks for sharing your thoughts.\n\n@dacap Keep up the great work and do with your baby what you want!\n\nHi @Download, thanks for your kind words!\n. People, I'd like to say a few things:\n1. To thank you all for the conversation.\n2. I think that @akien-mga has the best intentions with the fork, so I hope both projects can continue with their objectives.\n3. I just want to program software, I'm not sure when all this become so bureaucratic but it sucks, I'm not a lawyer and I really think I would lose any kind of trial no matter what I do.\n4. I've stopped watching aseprite-gpl because I don't want to be influenced by their decisions or patches, please @akien-mga (or someone in the project) send me a line in case you think that some issue needs my attention.\n. @Silent-Hunter hi Silent Hunter, I'm thinking that I might offer a \"distribution\" exception for platforms that are completely unsupported. Actually I'm doing that for schools or institutions that want to redistribute Aseprite freely in their classroom.\n. Hi @jameswilddev, about this bug, I'm still not yet sure how to fix this issue properly. In this specific case, as the empty frame is outside the tag, it looks like we should completely ignore the empty frame and tag b should adjusted to the range from 1 to 2 (range [1,2]).\nAnyway what happens if the empty frame is inside the tag a (i.e. a tag has two frames, [0,1] range)?\n\nShould tag a be adjusted to [0,0] range when the frame 1 is trimmed/discarded because it's empty? Or should tag a include the empty frame and in that case the JSON array include an empty frame too (which I'm not sure how it should be specified)?\n. I'm still thinking about this. In your specific case the frame tags from/to fields should be adjusted as you said, but in the second case I gave, where the empty frame is inside the frame tag, the frame could be kept with an empty/invalid frame and spriteSourceSize fields (0,0,0,0):\n...\n    {\n    \"filename\": \"player 1.ase\",\n    \"frame\": { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"w\": 0, \"h\": 0 },\n    \"rotated\": false,\n    \"trimmed\": true,\n    \"spriteSourceSize\": { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"w\": 0, \"h\": 0 },\n    \"sourceSize\": { \"w\": 64, \"h\": 64 },\n    \"duration\": 100\n   }\n...\n  \"frameTags\": [\n   { \"name\": \"a\", \"from\": 0, \"to\": 1, \"direction\": \"forward\" },\n   { \"name\": \"b\", \"from\": 2, \"to\": 3, \"direction\": \"forward\" }\n  ]\n...\nAnyway, in a second thought I'm thinking that information about empty frames might useful in all cases (even in your own case). (e.g. to known the frame duration). Maybe --ignore-empty option might be useful to completely discard the empty frames in these cases. I've to think more about this issue.\n. Hi @jameswilddev, in the next release you will be able to fix this issue using --ignore-empty parameter in your command line.\n. Hi @Nodragem, the --palette is an old parameter used to change the default palette of the program (almost useless nowadays). You are the second user that found the same problem so I'll change the meaning of --palette parameter so we can change the palette and save the sprite with different palettes (it makes a lot more sense).\nAnyway, there is a quite \"hidden\" feature that I made some time ago for that other user. You might try to use the script inside the attached .zip (save-with-other-palette-test.zip) and execute Aseprite in this way:\n./aseprite -b --script test.js\nSee the content of the test.js file. You will see that it's straight forward to change it for your needs. I hope you find it useful for your specific case.\n. This will be available in v1.2-beta2. An example for the future usage syntax:\naseprite -b test.bmp --palette pal2.bmp --save-as test2.bmp\n. You're welcome! The --script is a little hidden because there is no official API yet, as you said, it can simulate just a few commands (also it's quite easy to crash Aseprite using the API incorrectly). There is some features with more priority at this moment like #126 and #475 which I think would be better for most users.\n. More or less. Actions could be recorded in an XML file to execute UI commands, which then are easier to be modified/edited (so then you can edit your macro/actions step by step). Instead the API is a more text-based/scripting like set of functions that might be bigger than the available UI commands, also it could be then impossible to edit the script step by step from the UI (because that would be like refactoring the JavaScript code).\n. Hi @iamPHEN, thanks for the comment, you're right! We need a new SIGNED WORD type for XY positions.\nAs a side note, I'd like to move the .ase encoder/decoder to the (right now empty) iff module, so people can start using the same code the Aseprite use to load/save sprites in their our projects. Anyway I've to design the API yet (I've several API models for this, but I've never start moving code), so it would be nice to know your specific use case so I can consider your needs in the API.\nThanks again!\n. Hi @blinry, it's strange. It should show the Export Sprite Sheet by default when no previous export was made. Do you get that message when you create a new sprite and use Repeat Last Export?\n. I think I've the steps to reproduce this issue:\n1. Create a new sprite with Ctrl+N and Enter\n2. Then Ctrl+Shift+X to execute Repeat Last Export (this will open the export sprite sheet dialog)\n3. Click the Output file checkbox and press Export (the first sprite Sprite-0001-png.ini file is created with texture_filename = **filename**)\n4. Then we create a new sprite Ctrl+N and Enter\n5. We press Ctrl+Shift+X to export and the error appears\nThanks for your help! I'll try to fix this issue.\n. I think this is related to a \"hidden brush size\" used in the flood fill. E.g. If choose the paint bucket tool, and then you press the - key several times, this will reduce the brush size to 1 pixel (you cannot see the brush size when the paint bucket is selected, but it's a hidden parameter), and then it should start working correctly.\nI'll fix this ASAP.\n. Yes, some options from the File > Export menu should use #1080, see this comment https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1080#issuecomment-244763783\n. Hi @SanjithKanagavel, what exact Skia version/commit are you using? (we compiling with the chrome/m53 branch actually)\n. You can use that one (our fork is exactly the same), but you have to switch to the chrome/m53 branch in your local Skia clone.\n. In the Skia directory, you should use git checkout chrome/m53 and then resync (python bin/sync-and-gyp). I hope it helps!\n. You might try to clone Skia again, checkout the branch, and then regenerate the configuration files. I remember one time that I tried to reconfigure the directory changing the branch after a previous compilation with the invalid branch and I wasn't able to do it (I don't remember if it was exactly the same error, but you might give it a shot).\n. > Does v1.1.7 use skia 53 branch ??\nYes, v1.1.7 is the first version using skia 53.\n. Hi @Ashedragon, you can turn off the default setting closing all files (or going to the \"Home\" tab) and selecting View > Show > Layer Edges.\n. Yes, the default settings from View menu are really hidden. I think the View menu could be disabled when there is no document, and default settings should be in the Preferences.\n. Hi @blurymind, I've plans to create a port for iOS and Android, but I didn't start programming nothing yet. After I release v1.2-beta2 I'll start organising the code to do something about this.\n. I need to get one of those galaxy notes... (not the one that explode \ud83d\ude05 )\n. > Technically you could do it on any touch device, it's just nicer on galaxy\n\nnotes because they come with wacom pens\n\nI didn't know that galaxy notes include a wacom pen (I think it was just a \"samsung a pen\"), that sounds interesting \ud83d\ude2e \n. @brunosxs actually the mobile UI will be a complete different project to Aseprite desktop, I'll use most of the actual C++ logic to modify/render sprites/frames/layers, etc. but the actual desktop UI doesn't make too much sense on mobile (anyway I think that a \"classic mode\" option should be available just in case for people expecting the same experience if they have a pen).\n. Sorry but I'll lock this issue, I'm interested in a mobile version, but it will be available when a substantial portion of my life can be dedicated to it.. Hi @FOSSBOSS, we've changed the GPL to the new Aseprite EULA (there is a discussion about this in the comments section in the same commit and in issue #1242).\nAbout the contributions, I generally do a mention on each release in the release notes (search for \"thanks\"). If you think that a specific contribution should have a special mention in the About dialog or README file, please let me know.\n. Please check the aseprite-gpl fork, they already have done something like that.\n. Hi @Skrylar, could you please tell me in who can I trust? Free Software Foundation? Linux distributions? All these years I've made everything to make a living from Aseprite, no one came to me and said \"I think you've done a great work and I'd like to help you keeping Aseprite in the way it is.\" Also, I didn't (and don't) feel part of a community. I don't even know what this \"community\"  thing means (along this years, I was contacted by a specific \"community\" two times, just to be insulted).\nI'm sorry if you lost the trust on me, I've lost the trust in the \"community\" (whoever it is, wherever it is, whatever that means). I trust in certain people that helped in these years and gave me encouraging words, people that want to create things and continue using Aseprite. I'll continue working for them.\n. > Get in touch with others who are in this space (ex. Paul Davis.) Ask the software centers to transfer ownership to you (Ubuntu Software Center.) Ask Debian et all to iceweasel (or, inform them the trademark exists.) Ask people to buy the program on the binary builds (repackagers don't actually cut this part out.)\nYes, I should have done that.\n. Hi @KasumiArai! This regression was introduced in 18b4008c6f76cc57fc166be01e201ebc0d0d7377 to fix this bug\nThe issue here is that the transparent color is being draw/copied as part of the brush (because the brush is created with a box):\n\nYou could try to create the brush with the exact shape from the selection (e.g. using the Magic Wand tool and then Ctrl+B) and it should work as expected:\n\nI think this issue should be finally fixed implementing #945, so with \"Simple Ink\" the transparent color should act like the old behavior (compositing alpha), and with the \"Copy Alpha-Color\" ink it should act with the new behavior (replacing alpha).\n. > I understand the simple ink, but I also get this behavior with Alpha Compositing which I believe does not make alpha 0 behave as the eraser. #945 may cover that, but I'm mentioning this just in case.\nActually the ink mode is almost completely ignored with a custom brush (#945 should fix this). The \"Simple Ink\" should work as you expected (old behavior en v1.1.5), and the \"Copy Alpha+Color\" should work as it's working now in v1.1.8.\n\nthere's three alphas, though. The Opacity Value, the Alpha Value of the brush's pixels, and the Alpha value of the foreground color.\n\nIndeed there are four alphas: the opacity value, alpha in brush pixels, alpha en foreground, and the new \"mask bitmap\" (which is the original selection used to create the brush).\n\nI suppose the thing is that brush never blends with itself, so why the magic wand tool thing works is that it takes those pixels out of the equation. A transparent pixel meanwhile is still \"drawn\" so it will overwrite the current stroke because the current stroke cannot blend with the current stroke. Is this correct?\n\nYes, it's correct.\n\nI guess ideally I'd like transparent pixels to be treated as not there in Alpha Compositing like pixels that were eliminated from the selection that created the brush. Simple ink could still \"bring them back\" so to speak.\n\nActually Simple Ink acts like Alpha Compositing with Opacity=foreground color alpha. So Simple ink and Alpha compositing with custom brushes should act like in v1.1.5. And \"Copy Alpha+Color\" is the only one that should copy the alpha value directly.\n. I forgot, there is some documentation in the website about ink modes: http://www.aseprite.org/docs/ink/\n. I'll see how to improve the docs, maybe one gif for each case.\n. I was trying to fix this for the next release, but the painting is not working correctly for brushes with alpha != 255 (this is from v1.1.7):\n\nLeaving this for other release.\n. With \"snap to grid\" enabled, this is really noticeable/reproducible.\n. This bug is the same as #1315, already fixed for next v1.1.10.\n. Hi @talecrafter, I think it's a good idea. I'll try to include this in the next beta.\nAt the moment, in v1.2-beta2, you might try to use two groups, one for mark/guides, and other group for the sprite itself, then you can ignore marks using --layer groupname (or --layer groupname/* to make visible all children in that group and hide all other groups).\n. This is already available in the new Aseprite v1.2-beta3\n. It is a bug :( I've created some unit tests for this but I need to test it more with files with a mix of hidden/visible layers. Reopening the issue.\nAnyway, I'm thinking that I might give more priority to batch export using projects #126 or post-save hooks #138 \n. Hi @yurivict, I think you have an old clang version. Here I'm using Xcode 8.0, Mac OS X SDK 10.12 and my clang --version:\nApple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.38)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin\nBefore this I was compiling Aseprite with the clang version in Xcode 7.0 and SDK 10.11, that one should work too.\n. Oh you are on FreeBSD, it might be related to the libc++ version, but I'm not sure. Are you using libstdc++ or libc++?\n. Next week I'll take a look to this issue running a FreeBSD VM.\n. I'll take a look at this issue today.\n. Hi @yurivict, I was just able to compile the master branch from Aseprite on FreeBSD 11.0 with clang 3.8, I've used the steps from INSTALL.md:\n\nI recommend you to clone the master branch, and follow the steps on INSTALL.md to compile Aseprite (don't use ports or nothing extra). And you can install dependencies using pkg install.\n. hi @zed9h, here I've just written down some tasks to improve the thumbnails, if you are going to take one of these items, please make a comment here \ud83d\udc4d  (I'll do the same if I start working on one of these items)\n. > Cool, so, you liked this solution? \nI liked the solution so far. Other possibility would be to move the thumbnail inside the cels-box, but I'm not 100% sure about this:\n\n\nIt's nice but, I still miss the thumbs on the small timeline. \n\nDo you mean something like this:\n\nWe can still have small thumbnails using the Force checkbox in the timeline options.\n\nAnother idea: the overlay could be hidden by default when the timeline is larger.\n\nI'll think more about this, I've to see how it works with different approaches (e.g. different positions for the overlay).\n\nThis week were too busy, I will try to take a look at it in the next couple of weeks.\n\nNo problem. Just please make a comment if you start with some of the tasks, I'll do the same.\n. > What about test it, before the task \"linked cels could be shown in the following way\"?\nYes, I'll update the issue.\n. I'll be seeing some items of this issue because I'm trying to implement #1342 . Hi @lewislepton, I'm marking this issue as duplicated of #493. The automatic resize on Save Copy As is already possible, but it's not yet possible in Export Sprite Sheet. As a temporary workaround you can use the CLI (command line interface) to load your sprite, scale it, and export it automatically from a .bat:\naseprite -b player.ase --scale 2 --sheet player-sheet.png --data player-sheet.json\nSome platform-specific details here.\n. Some work already done in bcdf598392a49bf9f3a1885427dcedf33b777af2 and ae67cab015123788c044ad2e0821ee5d12584589. About the repeat tag feature I've found some duplicates too with more information: https://community.aseprite.org/t/loop-section-x-times-then-continue/1910/2?u=dacap. Hi @kyrieru, I'll see this bug. I think the problem is that the copied selection is reset when a frame is added to the sprite. See this case where pasted cels reset the selection too when a new frame is added at the end:\n\n. This will be available in the next version:\n\nUnchecking the option will disable the move-view-when-cursor-at-edge (aka auto-scroll). Hi @tareif, you can reset the zoom in the preview moving the mouse inside the preview window and pressing 1 key.\nAnyway the screen is scaled 200% by default, so you will see everything at x2 when the zoom is 100%. You can change the screen scaling to 100% from Edit > Preferences > General > Screen Scaling.\n. Hi @JosefKuchar, that's not possible at this moment but I'd like to make that possible in a near future. Related to #139 \n. @jacksarick I think it's a pretty big change for someone that want to contribute for the very first time. I would prefer smaller bug fixes first and then trying to contribute to something big.\nAnyway, for some reference, the basic idea is that this statement must be completely ignored from the compilation process (and all the dependencies should be ignored too/not linked, i.e. UI library isn't needed, etc.). New cmake -DENABLE_UI=OFF flag added. Another discussion in t/1351. Hi @handicraftsman, I think a GPL with that restriction isn't GPL anymore.\n. Qt uses unmodified GPL/LGPL licenses. They offer the commercial license just in case your program cannot meet the GPL/LGPL requirements. See section 3.5 in their FAQ: https://www.qt.io/faq/#_Toc453700714\nIn our case the \"use\" of the program wouldn't be completely free anymore with the \"non-commercial\" restriction. So this GPL part:\n\nThis License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.\n\nwouldn't be true anymore. Because you shouldn't be able to run the program for commercial purposes anymore. So this would make the software non-free/non-GPL/or with a modified-GPL license.\nSo basically Qt creates a dual-license model giving the commercial license choice to remove all GPL restrictions to Qt users (the developers). But we cannot do the same because our \"commercial license\" should start with a modified/restricted GPL in the first place for end-users (the main difference here is that our users are not compiling/linking our code with their creations, that are sprites/image files).\n. Fixed with 812e75f61351537f8cf0e80cc42fc66ec3fd39df. Hi @JosefKuchar, do you mean an action that do the same as 1) File > Import Sprite Sheet with grid size, and 2) then File > Save Copy As... > a .gif file, or something similar to that?\n. Something like #977 or #140?\n. That's a nice idea @KasumiArai, I'm not sure if that is the original @JosefKuchar idea, but it might be included anyway.\n. It looks like a nice (and pretty simple) addition to the Import Sprite Sheet UI.\n. LFTM\nI'll add some items to #1271 related to old issues with keyboard+mouse wheel combinations.\n. Are you still experiencing this issue?\nI've plans to change the whole Linux back-end in #139, so in a near time I'll review all issues related to Linux.\n. I've seen your email, please refer to shading documentation to know how it works. You first have to paint an area of a solid color with the Simple Ink, and then use the Shading Ink to displace that color into other colors in the selected gradient/color shades.\n. Fixed, it's https://www.aseprite.org/docs/shading/\n. Hi @SOMA1990, you should zoom in to view the pixel grid (from 400% or more), you can check if the pixel grid is enabled seeing a checkbox in the View > Show > Pixel Grid menu option.\nAlso you can check your pixel grid color settings from Edit > Preferences > Grid & Background. The pixel grid opacity is adjusted automatically depending on the zoom level too.\n. I'll close this issue but we can re-open if my solution didn't work.\n. There were a discussion about this issue in #1261, it's not solved yet.\n. Hi @oceanhahn, I'll see what I can do, it might be something similar to \"Save Brush\" option. I think the whole \"brush\" dialog needs a redesign (the dialog redesign is related to #175 too)\n. \ud83d\ude04  I've tagged this issue with slices tag because I think it's related to #721 (each slice might contain user data: comment, color, etc.). Also it might be related to #481, where each tile in each \"grid-patch\" (and area with a specific grid) could contain a comment/slice. \n. I'm thinking that it looks like several tools (multiple grids #481, rulers #747, and specific regions #30/#721) generates different kind of \"slices.\" For example, a ruler can generate two slices for each side, a grid-region can generate one slice for each tile, and a specific region create just one slice (or two? inside the slice and outside the slice?). I've to think more about how to implement all these features at once.\n. I think duplicate of #1052\n. Hi @goobliata, I've to rewrite the whole Linux back-end in the near future (related to #139), so I'll be reviewing all Linux issues.\n. At this moment I'll include only the possibility to change the initial frame number from the UI to avoid delaying the next release.. Thanks for your contribution @klw0!\n. Hi @pynom, I'm glad you figured out the solution.\nJust a couple of points:\n1. In case you want to use the git repository, remember that you have to clone the repository using git clone --recursive https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite.git (the --recursive flag is important). If you've already cloned the repository, you can use git submodule update --init to download submodules (the command to fix this issue is in the same output, maybe a little hidden).\n2. You can use OS X 10.12 SDK to compile Aseprite too, I've to update the INSTALL.md (I'm using 10.12 from now on too).\n. Duplicate #1169, see this comment\n. Closing this one because #920 already fixed it.. Hi @zmox, sorry I didn't reply here. You can change the UI/Screen scaling from Edit > Preferences > General in case you want this kind of customization (there shouldn't be need to change the skin.xml file).\n. Hi @nakedpony, actually you can export a JSON array using the --format json-array option.\n. Hi @SOMA1990, actually working on #532 I can replicate this problem quite often if we use a whole animation as reference.\nAseprite has a data recovery feature that tries to save all your work using a background task (details about this here), I'm trying to improve this situation implementing:\n1. A visual indication that a background task is doing some work in the background (#1114)\n2. Trying to unlock the sprite (i.e. stop the background task) in case the user wants to draw on the sprite (so the user has more priority that the background task).\nAt the moment you can disable the data recovery feature to avoid this dialog if this is too annoying going to Edit > Preferences > General and unchecking this option:\n\n. There are two things to improve:\n\nIf we split layers, linked cels must be exported just once in the sprite sheet and JSON data should point to the same region\nIf we don't split layers, and two (merged) frames are exactly the same, the data must be reused.\n\nI guess this behavior should be optional (and on by default). Hi @nosh247, this is possible selecting several cels and moving them with the Move tool.\nBut in future versions we should be able to move whole group layer (Layer > New Group on beta version) and all children should move/be transformed in the same proportion. Related to #454 and #1172\n. Hi @fredgirl77, I've just try a fresh clone/compilation. Could you give a try cloning Aseprite again into other directory? (remember the --recursive parameter)\n. Other ideas that gave me another user via Facebook:\n- provide an easy/quick way to change the brush size while playing animation too (related to #970)\n- provide a way to start the animation from the first frame: stop when we release mouse button, and start again from the first frame when we release it, combined with the \"start when mouse button is pressed.\n. You can use --all-layers option.. @lrtvri that's a possible solution to avoid editing the same file from different instances, anyway if the user modifies the file from the file manager (with aseprite closed), we have to check that the .undo file still makes sense for the file on disk\n. You can use --save-as out_{layer}.png (and in this case the --split-layers is done implicitly because {layer} was used in the filename.. Hi @Uhkam, something like #853?\n. No problem about the duplicate post (it's common, sometimes I post a duplicates \ud83d\ude04 )\n. Hi @Bigmacbook, it looks like cmake didn't find your MSVC compiler. Please setup your environment variables first in the command line:\ncall \"%VS140COMNTOOLS%\\vsvars32.bat\"\n\n. Nice catch!. Please refer to #1320. Thanks @winterheart!. I've just added the extension in the file selector too with 3b7f48224ccb49e918b211ee9beed6dbacedd1ab. Related to #424 and #1459. You're welcome! \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @OriginalAdric, it's because you are using the x64 compiler. I generally compile with the x86 (32bit) compiler but this issue must be fixed.. Hi @kyrieru, actually this is a feature in my personal to-do list. I though there was already an issue about this, but I didn't find it.\nThe main idea is to create an alternative UI to manipulate the same internal cel structures. For example, in this case:\n\nWe would have 6 frames with different durations and linked cels in the regular UI:\n\nSo moving/changing the size of each \"cel block\" in the time-based timeline would change the duration of each \"real cel\" and create/delete linked cels/sections automatically.. @oceanhahn yeah, and we can use linked cels to make frames even longer and combine them with other frames; the trick is to automatically adjust frames durations and create/delete linked cels each time we modify one frame-block in the time-based timeline.. @oceanhahn I think the export process would be a different story, for example, when you use time-based timeline, is because: 1) you are creating just a gif-like animation, or 2) you want the time-based information in the JSON data.\nThe export to a sequence of .png files would be really messy (maybe forbidden).. @kyrieru sorry, I'm a little confused by the image. What do represent those transparent rectangles? or the vertical lines?\n\nThat said, it's difficult to know how practical of a suggestion any of this is.\n\nYou should think in terms of user-friendly and backward-compatibility always, the problem is that, as you said, we generally don't know how practical something will be until we used it. So sometimes the important thing is to create a prototype as fast as possible and discard it as fast as possible if it doesn't work.\nThen internal details are mostly managed by me, and we can always find a way to adapt the code to something new. It doesn't matter how much time it will take as how much improvement it will make to the user daily experience.\n\nYou really are exceptional in that regard, compared to other devs.\n\nThank you. I think it's because: 1) I'm working full-time on Aseprite so I have plenty of time to think about it, 2) I implement huge changes that only someone crazy like me would approve (e.g. layers groups, which was a massive number of changes).\n\nIs there anything related to the timeline that you explicitly don't want to do, or any limitations that you would have to work with?\n\nNo. Maybe I'd like to avoid #593 because the scope is too big (it affects almost every single aspect of the UI/sprite editor/timeline/etc.) and there are a lot of other issues before that one. But I think I'd finally implement that one too (as it's quite related to/useful for #532).\nAnyway I'll finally filter or give more priority to things depending on its user-friendliness or the number of people requesting it, (Sometimes I change priorities of features just to avoid getting more user requests about it, as it's easier to program something than to give support about the non-existence of that something \ud83d\ude04 )\nFinally we should always think on progressive disclosure, so the program doesn't start getting bloated.. I'm going to try to implement the time-based timeline. Anyway the independent animation for each layer is more related to #593 . Maybe related to #1498 (so we could use a more Windows-like selection mode to 1) click first frame, 2) scroll, 3) Shift+click other frame to select the whole range) . Related to #139 . Hi @TheSilvus, actually from Edit > Preferences > Background, you can change the background settings:\n\nAbout point 1) I think unchecking \"Apply Zoom\" will behave as you expect, but I'm not 100% because I don't know how it's implemented on GIMP.. Hi @qbart, as @Bobhostern said, the \"Set Loop Section\" doesn't have nothing special about it. It's just a shortcut to create a tag named \"Loop\". From the Aseprite point of view, all tags are loops. (Although you can change the playback method to \"Play Once\" right-clicking the play button, it's just an UI option, this property is not related to the sprite/tag itself.)\nSo basically, each animation is handled as a loop or not in your game.. Fixed the problem described by @HolyBlackCat in dfa90d15c8e7cf49dc2ecfd9b57feac064999a20. Now I'll work on the main bug.. It looks like 0a68c4626db4a8f1b26a2d1fd10ff0c07b165d1c doesn't fix the rendering issues when \"apply zoom\" is disabled on 16x16 or other sizes. Still reviewing this issue.. Hi @fredgirl77, I had this issue in some intermediate commits, but the latest master should have this issue fixed (mainly by this commit 763c9ce9578676f25310621cdbec55d8ca40a52c). Hi @Bobhostern, it's strange because 4fada3aa00c9b35425913a5b318472d802030835 just fixed that problem. In your first screenshot you might be running the commit related to v1.1.10 without the 4fada3aa00c9b35425913a5b318472d802030835 patch. Also 6dc2b5284ec3ebd8066f0e1cfb5ec53b1290c6db doesn't fix this problem, but it includes 4fada3aa00c9b35425913a5b318472d802030835 in a previous master -> beta merge (you can check that in the https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commits/beta commits history). @Bobhostern that might happen if you have the non-linear undo history enabled:\n\n. Hi @Bobhostern, the original bug reported by @shin197 is still present (it's an actual problem), the non-linear undo history \"problem\" is just about your specific comment. But the original issue must be fixed yet.. Dup #1005. I'll take a look at this issue tomorrow. Anyway I generally reopen issues when I can reproduce the problem.. Hi @hepari, in that case you could give a try to \"File > Save Copy As\" and select the Active Frame option only (given a specific name to your frame):\n\n. > Does it mean 'case closed'?\n^_^ I'm not sure, I'll leave this issue open just to indicate that this dialog needs some kind of improvement. This is related to #645, #1252, and other issues.. Related to #722 . Duplicate #834. Hi @therealrobster, you already can do this. Try to configure keyboard shortcuts for left/right click trigger (e.g. A for left click, and S for right click):\n\n(I'm closing this issue but you can still make comments and I can re-open the issue if needed)\n. Hi! I'm thinking that this could be another ink (similar to the Shading ink), maybe a Hue/Saturation/Lightness ink, where you have three modes, and each mode move colors -step or +step on the selected channel (hue, saturation, or lightness) using left/right clicks (or keyboard shortcuts).\nThis is related to something I'm thinking in these days, something like a \"super customization\" possibility. For example: the possibility to trigger some complex logic (macro/script) with a key press, e.g. one key could start run a macro which consist in a serie of steps: 1) select this new ink mode, 2) press mouse button, 3) release the mouse button automatically, and then 4) restore the ink mode. (this could be a script or a macro in an extension #1403, related to #475 too). Hi @SolarLune, you can use contiguous layers and copy cels to create links instead of copies with Alt+drag-and-drop:\n\n. Hi @scofano, do you mean to change the window width x height size right? so we could have a sense about how much device space the image would use.. Hi @piratesephiroth, about the Ninja issue, you might try: 1) removing gcc path from the PATH environment variable or, 2) using:\nset CC=cl\nset CXX=cl\n\nSource: https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2012-September/051986.html. Related to #454, #1172, #1238, #1318. Hi @romulo-Ferreira, are you shrinking a selection? Aseprite uses nearest-neighbor interpolation for scaling/rotating, which tend to be better for pixel-art but it might produce worse results for resizing photos. What kind of image are you trying to resize?. A possible algorithm: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/1/142260718946422058/. @Saphiresurf please \ud83d\udc4d  the issue in that case (I generally search for features with the most \ud83d\udc4d  to implement). Hi @h0rdak, actually I'm not sure how the \"ninja install\" command might work as CMakeLists.txt files are not prepared to do so (I never use \"ninja install\", the executable is on the build/bin directory).. \n. Fixed in 7dbff3daa65a69ee1a0ac73a5e75d805c6a14bee and fb2ee91c92ff227a72ae6e4f697bfeb9e06f8005 (#348). Thanks for this change too!. Hi @kyrieru, actually the File > Save Copy As works like an export option.. Hi @fayer3, I've just fixed this problem for the next release (b6744d03f3364477bcb00392a22d16ea46659845). I'll see if I can include other fixes and this week we should have the new version available.. Hi everybody, could you please tell me what desktop resolution, screen scaling, and ui scaling (Edit > Preferences > General) are you using? is this problem new or was it in 1.2-beta7 too?. @allrod5 thanks for your information! About UI Scaling, try to set Screen Scaling at 100% and UI Scaling at 200% and restart the program (the new UI Scaling factor will be set in the next initialization). Thanks @robinjam, I've just merged this PR. Made some changes in the formula to calculate the colors in the wheel and added an indicator to show the picked color in the wheel.. Before:\n\nAfter:\n\n. Related to #475, #874, #1172, and #1364.\nDev note: This is related to symmetry issue because when symmetry is enabled, if we transform a portion of the sprite, the same transformation should be applied to other area in an inverse direction; something similar for multiple layers (the same transformation in several layers).. It might be related to using two different instances of Aseprite opened. E.g. you changes settings in one Aseprite instance and close it, then you close other Aseprite instance, this one might overwrite the former instance preferences.. Thanks to the help of legacydev_ we've found this bug. The fix will be released in the final v1.2.\nEDIT: sorry, I didn't notice that you @KashouC are legacydev_ \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @oceanhahn, did you try the new Save Copy As dialog on the beta version? http://imgur.com/HqUWr50 it contains the possibility to save/export selected frames only.. @oceanhahn please send me an email at support@aseprite.org in case you want a Steam key, your Gumroad purchase gives you access to a Steam key too :wink:. I think this one is already fixed.. Hi @kyrieru, you can get the list of frame duration exporting a JSON sprite sheet (--data option) with the command line interface:\naseprite -b yourfile.ase --format json-array --data yourfile.json\n\nThen you can process the yourfile.json file (which looks something like this). I hope it helps!. Hi @oceanhahn, I didn't read this issue yet, but this is a known issue. The color quantization algorithm is not good enough. As a recommendation for future issue reports, please try to write them as short as possible \ud83d\ude05 . I've received several error reports about this RGB -> Indexed conversion but generally it's reported as a \"GIF export problem\", where a RGB sprite with more than 256 colors + layers w/blend modes + different alpha values are used. So the problem is in our createOptimizedPalette algorithm which uses median cut. I've to investigate the possibility to use other color quantization algorithms.. > I tried searching the Issues stack, too, but I guess my phrases weren't very good. \ud83d\udca9\nDon't worry! It was a problem reported via email and facebook, so it's good to have this issue here on github \ud83d\ude09 . No progress yet on this issue, but I can give some priority for some sooner version.. Reported here too:\nhttps://community.aseprite.org/t/converting-to-index-color-gives-incorrect-results/2200\nhttps://community.aseprite.org/t/flashing-colors-when-exported-as-gif/2500\n. Hi @jjhaggar, some time ago I was thinking in a bi-directional template mechanism (I think it was to export/import JSON sprite sheet data). I'll think about this, maybe it's related to #126 feature, where exports/imports could be expressed in a graphical way and processed with one click.. Hi @ioncodes, your build system is violating the Aseprite EULA. You should remove your builds from Internet ASAP.. Hi @Sarseo, I recommend you to see the beta branch .ase file referece: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/beta/docs/ase-file-specs.md (which include more information about Groups, Reference Layers, etc.). I'd love to add video export support in a future, mainly on platforms that have a native API to export to video (related to #629).. Hi @Bohjo, I've just close this issue. You can reopen it again if you came with another corrupted file (it might be related to an Aseprite bug).. Yeah, the line algorithm was fixed but it still needs more angle snapping (new issue #1641 same as this I guess). Hi @Xeyler, actually the beta version does have an option to save the active/selected frame(s).. Hi @goobliata, I'll take a look at this issue soon. I've to see if I can reproduce it first with my own touchpad. Do you know the touchpad driver which you are using? Or the specific notebook model, I could try to find something similar.. This might be the same issue as in #1401, for example, when I press the Z key, the touchpad is disabled for (I guess) a second, so I can click (on touchpad) several times and the Zoom tool doesn't work. Just after one second the touchpad starts responding again.. Hi @winterheart, this patch isn't passing the Travis build, maybe it needs an apt-get install cmark or something like that.. Hi @winterheart, thanks for this. I'll merge it now.. I'll try to improve the performance of filters (including Replace Color) for the next version.. Hi @goobliata, same problem here. It's related to the touchpad driver. The driver disables the touchpad when non-modifiers keys are pressed (and Space bar is not a modifier key, just Alt, Shift, Ctrl, Windows key and Menu key). It happens system-wide.\nHere a screenshot of my driver: (Synaptics TouchPad V7.5):\n\nThis is a general Windows issue:\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/399341/touchpad-does-not-respond-when-i-am-holding-key-on-the-keyboard and I don't think it can be fixed (e.g. Photoshop has the same issue).. This might be a solution for Dell: http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19461214. @hawkins Initially extensions should be basic stuff (themes, fonts, shortcuts, languages, import/export plugins). More complex stuff could be added in the future after some iterations but I don't promise it. Generally extensions = more maintenance = code complexity = more bugs (and third party bugs). So we have to go step by step.\n. @codecat there is no API to get information from the sprite yet, but something in the future will be available (you can follow this project: https://github.com/aseprite/api ). For devs: please review this issue after #139 . @lonesurvivor can you check if this is still reproducible in the beta version?. Please refer to #1006. Just checking, it's strange that the bug doesn't occur on the stable version and only in the beta version. Did you compile the beta version? Are you compiling it with debug information?. Hi @KashouC, actually there are a couple of options in Edit > Preferences > Editor:\n\nAnyway none of these modified the Zoom tool (Z key) behavior, only the mouse wheel or the 1-6 keys.. The zoom behavior needs some tweaks. It needs more customization, anyway I'd like to fix the default behavior.\nOn Photoshop it works as in Aseprite if an \"Overscroll\" option is enabled (so we start suffering on Photoshop the \"out of center\" behavior that Aseprite has). Anyway the default behavior (without this overscroll option) has some differences:\n\nZoom in: If the editor area is bigger than the image, the zoom is from the center, and when the image is bigger than the editor the zoom is from the mouse position.\nZoom out: Like Aseprite, but after the mouse is released (and if the editor is bigger than the image) the image is centered\n\nI will check how it works giving the possibility to zoom out from the center.. Hi @Alloyed, you might try using the --filename-format CLI option. You can use something like\naseprite --filename-format \"{title}.{extension}\" --data a.json --sheet /b/b.png. Hi @eevee, known issue related to #139 . Somehow related to #1395. The first part of this issue is fixed with 88e059669229eea4be8f9c425617cca904d25f4d, but brushes still need some work. Anyway I'm not sure how the brush problem could be fixed. For example, the left side (as it works right now) looks like can be converted in something like the right side:\n\n\nBut what we do in this case?\n. This might be related to #1268 and this discussion.. Hi @TheMostCuriousThing, thanks for reporting this error. It's a known issue but I've never create the issue on GitHub, it's good to have it here now. I'll try to fix this for the next release.. It might be related to #126 . Hi @metroidchild, sorry but we don't support mingw, please try with Visual Studio on Windows following the INSTALL.md instructions.. Hi @steamb23, it's a known issue but quite hard to fix.\nSome years ago the \"remap\" feature was implemented in such a way to track these drag-and-drop modifications. Then I decided that an easier way would be to just try to match the old colors with the new colors (e.g. to solve a remap when a completely new color palette is loaded/replaced). The problem (as you see) is when the color palette contains duplicated color entries as in your example.\nI think that we need a mixed solution to solve both cases.. I didn't comment about this feature yet, but I liked it. This option could be grouped with other options to clear background with Background color in transparent layers or as the current behavior.. Hi @Snky, did you try the View > Timeline menu option?. Hi @KasumiArai, thanks for this bug report. I'm suspecting that this my be due to: 1) a networking filesystem (e.g. accessing a folder through the network), or 2) a Windows Explorer extension (e.g. TortoiseHg or something similar). Do you have some extension/special program installed on your Windows Vista? Maybe a program that extends the Windows Explorer in someway?. Thanks @tyllerj, I was able to reproduce it. I'll fix it for the next version.. Hi @frarees, it's strange because I wasn't able to reproduce it on v1.1.13 and macOS 10.12.13:\n\n\ud83e\udd14  Can you always reproduce it? Do you have a special sprite where you are able to reproduce? Can you share that .ase file? (e.g. sending it to support@aseprite.org). I've tested the invalid version and I can reproduce the problem now. Seeing that the problem is visible in Chrome too, I'm pretty sure this is related to FreeType rendering algorithm. I'm not sure if we'd be able to fix this.. Related to one item in #1387. Hi @frarees, it's strange that you have to check the Zoom sliding two fingers up or down option to zoom with the wheel. Definitely it looks like Logitech's driver (?) is converting mouse wheel into trackpad event to scroll (slide two fingers).\nDoes Logitech give you some settings for the mouse? E.g. like Wacom:\n\n. Did you try enabling/disabling \"smooth scrolling\" option?. Related to #139 . Related to #68 and #684 . Requested here too: https://community.aseprite.org/t/ruler-lines-when-selecting/805. Duplicate #970. Hi @kyle-mathis, did you try to run ninja aseprite after that. It looks like the cmake command worked (from what I can see in the cmake output).. As a side note: you can select all frames, press Alt+I to reverse all frames, save copy as, and then press Alt+I to reverse all frames again.. Related to #1505 in some way . Already implemented in #1505 . Sorry, this is about sprite sheets \ud83d\ude22 . Please refer to #1320 for this feature. Hi @pretzelhands, did you update your repo with git submodule update --init --recursive?. Hi @mako and @pretzelhands, I've just committed a change that might fix this issue.. @mako you're welcome, thanks for testing, I'll close this issue but if the problem re-appears you can still comment and I can reopen it.. Hi @michidk, I was able to load the theme on macOS:\n\nMaybe this is a problem related to the Windows version, I'll test it on Windows later.. @michidk no, v1.1.13 is the latest (stable) one. Related to #139 and #518. Please follow #1006. Related to #1400. This should be fixed since v1.2-beta8 (f381cb972cdc83db9b19c10ede0af6f8fc3d7336). At the moment it works as you would like using the Opaque option on an Indexed image (doesn't work for RGBA images):\n\n. > Would it be possible to add it to RGBA images?\nNot for the next version but I'll try to look at this issue later.. Actually that is an expected behavior \ud83e\udd14  If the center of the copied area is outside the canvas, when we paste it will be pasted in the center of the canvas instead of the original position (just to show to the user some feedback that the paste operation worked) . > I don't think there's a need to change the copy and paste location of an image just because it's off canvas.\nThe problem here is that if we don't paste the clipboard content in the center of the editor's viewport, the user might never notice that he/she paste something (and that might be a problem for pixels with 0 < alpha < 255).\nI'm not sure that pasting content outside the viewport would be a nice solution because the user would lost any kind of feedback about the Ctrl+V operation.. I'll show you my case with a gif where the original copied area is not visible anymore:\n\nYou copy, scroll to other area, and paste. If the clipboard is pasted in the original position it would not be visible to the user.. Oh ok! I'll take a look at this issue soon.. Both fixes will be available in the next release.. This fix introduced a regression. Please read this discussion.. Note: Maybe a problem related to Windows and Linux only (as macOS uses \u2318 key). I forgot to say, that a possible temporal solution would be to assign a neutral shortcut for the Move Tool (quick) action:\n\n. Hi @2dchaos, already planned (not next version but soon). In some future, if frames have user data (color and text), frames could be linked just like cels (to link frame properties, data and frame duration). At the moment the only way to scale multiple (all) layers is using Sprite >Sprite Size. Hi @winterheart, I tried to do that but failed. Anyway I think in a near future I will remove the shared configuration (it makes maintenance unnecessarily more complex) and take a more google chrome-like approach.. @skrat you need to clone the repository with submodules. Hi @mooviies, today I'm trying to release a new version so this will wait until next week. Meanwhile could you please sign the CLA?. Thanks @mooviies, I'll check right now because I was able to reproduce the problem on Windows (release mode only).. I'll take a look at this issue next week. Anyway there are several problems with symmetry. I've to refactor the code to make symmetry works at the level of pixels instead of mouse points. For example, if we use a brush like this one: \n\nThe symmetry doesn't work as expected:\n\nSo basically the problem must be fixed at the pixel level (I guess) so that should fix the spray tool problem too.. Hi there! Yeah, sorry for this bug. I've already fixed it and I'm planning to upload an update on Monday (I want to wait just a couple of days just in case if another big issue appears). If you set UI scaling to 100% it should work ok, here some info: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/2/133262487499613719/. Hi @KashouC, two things about this:\n\nAs you found, there is a bug were we cannot set the same keyboard shortcut to select a couple of tools (e.g. to restore the default behavior)\nYeah, I don't like the current way to select the tools when two or more tools share the same keyboard shortcut\n\nTo solve the second point we might:\n\nUse the solution you proposed, but there are one problem: How do we know what is the first tool to be selected? For example, if ellipse and ellipse fill are associated to R key, should the first R select the ellipse or the ellipse fill? (this is already an actual problem, as by default the non-filled ellipse is selected first, and then the filled ellipse, by the order that these tools are listed in the gui.xml, so that might be the possible solution)\nOther possibility is to have a keyboard shortcut to switch tools in the group (i.e. as Photoshop does), so for example (by default) the U key selects a tool in the rect/ellipse group, and Shift+U switch the icon in that group (between rect -> filled rect -> ellipse -> filled ellipse)\n\nI'm not sure yet how to solve this in a proper way, maybe both possibilities.. Known issue, quite difficult to fix. I have considering using a low level layer (Windows and macOS APIs + native controls to get hotkeys) to handle hotkeys/shortcuts/accelerators, but I'll see if this can be fixed in some other way.. Somehow related to the first item in #1604 . Hi @josephan, could you please try converting the Background layer into a transparent layer first (Layer > Layer from Background menu option).. Can you please try 1) close all documents, 2) uncheck View > Show > Auto Guides, 3) restart Aseprite?\n\n. I think it's related to #723. The option is not available yet. The issue #723 is still open.. I'll fix the snap to the corner of the each grid cell for the next version.. I'll close this issue and if someone thinks it needs further discussion can comment (I think people can comment on closed issue \ud83e\udd14 ). I tried to reproduce this:\n\nPressing Shift+P focus the layer name.\nDouble-click focus the layer name.\nRight-click > Properties doesn't focus the name \ud83d\udc48 I'm going to fix this case. Hi there, did you try right-clicking the tag and selecting \"remove tag\"?\n\n\n. @flamendless was you able to reproduce this bug in the latest beta (v1.2-beta9?) or in a more recent commit?. It's the antialias algorithm in the FreeType lib, try using antialias=\"false\" in the <font antialias=\"false\" /> declaration, anyway the result might be worse (several TrueType fonts aren't prepared for tiny resolutions). Maybe the font is too small, please feel free to send me a copy of the font that you are trying to use to support@aseprite.org. Related to the animation support item on #721 . Hmmm I think it's right, here is the code that writes a layer chunk. Remember that a STRING fields has a header of 2 bytes (WORD) with the length of the string (code that write the layer name).. The first two bytes in the layer name is a WORD indicating the string length (in this case should be 5). I see 5 bytes between the opacity and the layer name:\n\\xff \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x05\\x00 Layer\n       1   2   3   4   5\n\nSo opacity is 0xff, then three 0x00 bytes and then the string length. (Which is not just one byte, it's a WORD (2 bytes), so in your file you have \\x05\\x00Layer it is \\x05\\x00 (0x0005) the length of the string Layer.). There's no problem @benmoran56!. Hi @FogRyu, I'll reply here instead of your email at support@aseprite.org\nDid you try the latest version v1.1.13 or v1.2-beta9 (v1.2-beta9 is preferred to  debug this situation as it logs more information about it)?\nAfter installing v1.2-beta9, could you please try to execute Aseprite with the --debug parameter in the command line? https://www.aseprite.org/docs/debug/\nThis should generate a Aseprite-v1.2-beta9-DebugOutput.txt file in your desktop. I'd like to see the content of that file in case that Aseprite doesn't work.. @FogRyu all updates for v1.x series (v1.2, v1.3, etc.) are free for customers! If you bought for a second time I can refund your purchase and send you the original link to get the update. Contact me at support@aseprite.org. You can temporally try to disable the auto-save of recovery data just in case to check if it's related to that: \n\n. > I'll try that. I'm sure the power won't go out in my apartment while it's off or anything.\nI hope so \ud83d\ude04  (make backups of everything and use Dropbox \ud83d\ude05 ). @KashouC \ud83d\udc4d  I'll be testing beta9 on windows in these days (crash reports + this issue) to see if I can reproduce the freeze. Related to #1046 and #475. You could give a try to the new scripting capabilities.. Hi @SvyatoslavRazmyslov, thanks for the PR. I have your emails queued but I didn't find time to answer them yet. Some time ago some people from the CppDepend team contact me with a free key of their product too but I wasn't able to give a try to the product (I don't find time to fix all compiler warnings in the three platforms yet \ud83d\ude1e ).\nI'm using macOS most of the time right now but today I'll give a try to PVS-Studio (if it's not today probably it will wait forever, so it must be today). After that I'll write you an email with my impressions.. Already reported by other user by email too. I'll fix this for beta10.. Hi @MasterOfTheTiger, this is already possible. You might be using a version that is compiled with the official Allegro version. You can check the demo of the official version: https://www.aseprite.org/trial/ and you'll see that you can resize the window.. Duplicate #1324 . \ud83d\udc4d going to close this one right now, thanks for testing! \u2764\ufe0f . Hi @ShiaTheMLGPro, could you please send me your file at support@aseprite.org?. @ShiaTheMLGPro I was not able to view your broken file yet. What kind of image (RGB or indexed, width, height, number of layers and frames) are you trying to edit? can you send me a previous version (working files) of your sprites?. @ShiaTheMLGPro Another thing, could you please try if it's reproducible in the v1.2-beta9 version?. Just trying to figure out what could be go wrong in this situation (I'm testing loading/saving similar images right now), are you saving your images on an external disk? Do you have enough space on that disk? Did the program crash when saving the file? Do you have a red flag on the top-right corner ( http://imgur.com/9MTYI9k )? . I've been testing/stressing the compression/decompression algorithm with thousand of random images, different patterns, several layers, etc. and wasn't able to reproduce a zlib problem (anyway might be a problem in the algorithm itself for a specific pattern, so I don't discard this possibility).\nOn the other side, could you please do a full scan disk to your external HDD? I suspect a couple of things: 1) the disk might contain corrupt sectors, or 2) the file wasn't completely flushed/synced on disk before it was disconnected (in case you connect/disconnect it regularly).. When you say that the \"problem persist\" does it means that if you create a new image, save it, and then load it you see the same error?. The problem is that if the file got corrupted on the HDD, there is no way to recover it. If you \"moved\" the file from your desktop PC to your HDD, the original file might still exists on your desktop PC as a hidden/deleted file, there are some programs to restore deleted files from your disk. Anyway I'm not 100% sure if this is related to a bad sector in your HDD or a bug on Aseprite.. Hi @JBoyAdvance, are you talking about the window size? This is a problem of the version distributed by Debian (and Ubuntu, etc.), already fixed several years ago (related to #192)\nYou can try the official demo version: https://www.aseprite.org/trial/\nAnyway I'm not 100% if we are talking about the same thing here \ud83d\ude05 . 4:3 also requested here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/1/1479856439023096455/. There is a more simple method using the trial version bundle. I'll think about this in the near future and see if I merge this PR, or I add another explanation to create the bundle from the trial version, or I just integrate the bundle generation in the repository/compilation process.. Hi @haxpor, I'm not sure how slate works internally, maybe @jigish, or @mgax, or other slate developer can help about this issue. What does need a window/application to implement to work with slate?. Thanks @mgax for the explanation, I'll give a try to slate and check if this issue is related to the macOS accessibility API (which Aseprite doesn't use).. Hi @Dairnon, do you have some examples of command lines that doesn't work as in older versions? (I try to keep backward compatibility with some automated tests, but it's probable that something is missing)\nI'll add ignore-layer in docs too.. I forgot about the feature/bug itself, I'm not sure if folders should be automatically created (maybe a special --mkdirs parameter or something like that).. This was requested a couple of extra times:\n https://twitter.com/hepari00/status/976166817583509504\n https://community.aseprite.org/t/generate-folder-by-command-line/1540\nI'll try to add this feature/fix in v1.2.9.\n. Duplicated. Related to #518 . Do you have more information about this? For example, what specific commit is your v1.2-dev version? What image are you trying to resize (width, height, color mode, number of layers and frames, etc.) and what size are you trying to reach?. The size doesn't look like something that should hang the program. Did you compile the debug or the release version? (check your CMakeCache.txt file in your build folder). Hi @dxu, actually GIF files support a minimal frame duration of 10ms. It cannot contain less than that (well, it can be 0ms which Aseprite loads as 1ms). It's strange that a frame with less than 20ms has a longer duration after exporting the animation into a GIF. If you can share with me the .ase file and the resulting .gif file you can send them at support@aseprite.org, I'll be the only one seeing the files.\nA possible problem is that Aseprite is saving frames with duration <10ms with 0ms but the player that you are using (maybe a specific browser) is loading the file with a bigger duration (e.g. converting 0ms into 100ms).. Already an user published a script to do some of the resizing algorithms:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ThKasparrr/status/1058806705159581701\n\nhttps://thkaspar.itch.io/nxpa. This PR was merged with commits squashed (d0c1be871a413f649f11c33549b9984f02fb6ea6). Thanks Chris!. I think someone else ask me for the same think but I wasn't able to find the issue. It might be related to #1308 (so Ctrl+T keyboard shortcut could select the extension of all layers).. This will be available in v1.2.7. Some comments about this:\n\n\nOn Windows/Linux will be Ctrl+click, on macOS this will be Command+click\n\nCtrl+click = Replace selection\nCtrl+Shift+click = Add/union selection\nCtrl+Alt+click = Subtract selection\nCtrl+Shift+Alt+click = Intersect selection. Hi @dxu, actually this is already fixed for the next release:\n\n\n. Hi @winterheart, I'll take a look at this later. Anyway, the idea behind the ft::open_stream() function is that it uses base::open_file_raw() so you can load ttf fonts with unicode filenames. From what I see, that functionality would be lost with this patch, is that right?. I would prefer to use the FILE interface because it avoids to load the entire file on memory (at least that is what I think, I'm not 100% sure) and Arial Unicode.ttf is 23.3 MB on macOS.\nFrom my point of view this is an issue on the freetype2 library, because their solution to create a customize FT_Stream requires their internal header files (and these files shouldn't internal in the first place). Maybe a freetype2 patch?. Hi @winterheart, sorry for my late response on this one, I'll try to review this after fixing some serious issues on Windows 10 for Surface devices.. Thanks @winterheart, finally merged this PR.. Hi @mweitzel, you can try using --format json-array to preserve the order of frames. I think that should work.. There will be a new Switch Nonactive Layers Opacity command available in v1.2.5, no default keyboard shortcut, but you will be able to configure it from Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts..... I think the \"Thumbnails\" checkbox is confusing. It was expected to be used only to hide/show thumbnails options, but I think that as you said, the user would expect to completely disable thumbnails unchecking this checkbox. I'll take a look to this issue.. It looks like a dependency introduced by libarchive. We use this library now to uncompress .zip files. I think I might compile it without Bcrypt.dll dependency as I'd like to maintain compatibility with Vista (and XP if it's possible). Taking note about this issue.. OK, please give a try with Visual Studio and see if you can compile it.. Hi @KashouC, do you mean the number of shades on a gradient without dithering, right?. I'm thinking that a possible solution might be using a configurable Color Curve (which can act like a gamma too). A simple mode should include only \"steps\", and an advanced mode should include a way to edit the color curve (a color curve is just a f(x) function that converts a 0...255 value to another 0..255 value).. Hi @daisyowl, this issue is already solved in the beta version.\nTry the beta version\nDuplicated #920. Hi @oceanhahn, yeah I've to put it back, here a discussion about it. The idea is key A should switch the edit mode, F4 should switch edit mode+show/hide popup (anyway it will be configurable, you should be able to configure keys to just show/hide the popup or/and switch edit mode). Also related to the new feature requested here #1526. Working on this one:\nFor one frame:\n\nWhen several frames are selected (same when the focus is above a Tag):\n\nReference: frame [firstFrame...lastFrame] frameDuration [selectedRangeDuration]/totalDuration\n. I'll cherry pick this change for v1.2.9, it is almost lost in a beta branch that I've already delayed a lot.. Already available in v1.2.9-beta2 in Steam beta branch. Hi @hepari, I'll close this issue but if you see that it happens again or you can reproduce it, please fell free to comment this issue again.. I've tested this in v1.2-beta12 macOS and it works. Anyway I'll try to give a try into Windows 10 but next week.. Hi @needforbleed, actually it's not possible to save the opacity information on several formats (e.g. jpeg, bmp, pcx, etc.). PNG files are a good option to save the alpha/opacity channel (anyway all layers will be merged, because PNG files don't support layers).\nIn case you want to save each layer as a different file, you can use the command line.. Duplicate #974 . I was able to reproduce it in some way (it doesn't use 100% CPU, but it uses 1% to 2% constantly). It's because the marching ants effect, it constantly redraw the timeline. I'll see how I can improve this situation.. You can also use the Escape key too to just remove the marching ants.. Thanks for reporting this @hepari! I hope to have the fix ready for the final v1.2.. Maybe a bug on v1.1.13, in v1.2-beta12 seems already fixed.. Requested here too: https://community.aseprite.org/t/100-instead-of-256/1916. Hi @KashouC, a temporal fix could be configuring the Eyedropper to use HSL mode:\n\n. Related to #1498 . Hi @oceanhahn, the relative mode was replaced with the new Hue/Saturation command (Edit > Adjust Hue/Saturation or Ctrl+U). You can select several color palette entries and then Adjust Hue/Saturation.. Hi @Warped2713, this happens because Aseprite tries to load the whole sequence of Pn.png files as an animation automatically. So in your first line:\naseprite -b P1.png P2.png P3.png P4.png --sheet Test.png\n\nIt loads 4 animations:\n\nP1.png (which will contain 4 frames: P1, P2, P3, P4)\nP2.png (which will contain 3 frames: P2, P3, P4)\nP3.png (which will contain 2 frames: P3, P4)\nP4.png (which will contain 1 frames: P4)\n\nTo avoid this, you can use:\naseprite -b --oneframe P1.png P2.png P3.png P4.png --sheet Test.png\n\nOr\naseprite -b --frame-range 0,0 P1.png P2.png P3.png P4.png --sheet Test.png\n\nAnyway this issue was report some time ago by other user via email. It's a common situation and I think that if the first specified file name (P1.png) loads P2.png, P3.png, and P4.png automatically, those files should be ignored in the command line.\n. Duplicate #1410. Hi @bloggy, do you have more details about this? Actually I don't understand if you call \"shader effect\" to the spray tool or to the \"shading ink\". Actually this was implemented in this way by design just to have a way to discard the custom brush. Anyway I guess the expected behavior would be to keep the custom brush and change its color.\nRelated: We should have a button in the context bar to discard the custom brush and go back to normal brushes (the same that Esc keyboard shortcut does).. I wasn't able to reproduce this issue, but I'll need more time to test and see if the G key just stop working.. I don't remember if we talk about this in the chat, but I think a modifier like Shift key should make circle-like curves with the Curve tool (just like Shift key snap the angle with the Line tool).. Duplicate #1100. Known issue, it's because the brush size is set to 2px for the selection tool (but you cannot see the brush size in the context bar, it's a bug). Press the - (minus) key to reduce the brush size to 1px and you will see that this should be fixed. (This bug is already fixed for the next release.). Hi @cebolan, thanks for this PR. Would you mind to sign our CLA?. Thanks @cebolan, I've just merged your patch. I'm not sure if this option should be on View menu or Frame menu (below the Frame > Play Animation). Is this reproducible on Aseprite v1.2.4?. Related to #996 and #475 in some way (e.g. we should be able to record the steps and reproduce them).. Thanks @KashouC, I'll take a look at this. For me the \"Rewind on Stop\" should go back to the exact frame where the animation was started/play button was pressed.. I think this was annotated in other place, but I didn't find the other issue/to-do item. Nice to have this here.. Doesn't look too complex and it might be easy to avoid when all palette entries are opaque. +1 for the next release. I forgot about this one, will fix this for v1.2.1. Maybe related to #593 and #720 e.g. we want two or more instances of the same sprite in a different layer stack order.. Hi there! Actually you can use any of both sites. Thanks for this feature requests, I'll take a look in the community site: https://community.aseprite.org/t/allow-to-group-colors-in-a-palette/445. I'm opening this issue to continue the development discussion from here.. @pazon12 maybe a sprite could have a link to another .aseprite file that contains the palette. So palettes can be stored in any file and files can link other palettes. (anyway this is close to the projects feature). Thanks for the tip @mysterycoconut, I'll take a look to this issue in these weeks.. I'm already making some progress on this issue:\n\n\n. Known issue, this will be fixed with a patch today.\nhttps://community.aseprite.org/t/i-cant-input-f-when-renaming-layer/480\n. The Linux version needs some love, I'm taking note about this one.. You might try the --trim parameter in the latest version (v1.2.4) and see if it's useful for your case.. Hi @AndyGFX, are you trying to drop a file from the Windows Explorer or from the web browser?\nThe drag and drop of images directly from the browser never worked.. @danieldiggle did you try the latest 1.2.4 version?. Related to #459. Hi @KasumiArai, this is related to this bug fixing:\nhttps://community.aseprite.org/t/marquee-tool-add-subtract-to-selection/470/9\nI'll revert part of the behavior and add a new option in Edit > Preferences > Selection to switch to the new behavior (at least for the Add selection mode).. The new option (checked by default):\n\n. related to #518 and #250 . Two issues here:\n\nAseprite was never able to save indexed images as jpg (it should do a \u201cto rgb\u201d conversion on the fly)\nThe dialog says \u201cError\u201d and not \u201cWarning\u201d, you cannot continue, the \u201cDo you...?\u201d question is wrong, in this case we just cannot continue (until we resolve the first issue) . Related to #830 . A simple fix could be done for jpg only, the real fix should include a way to get the RGBA information in real-time when we need it (a background conversion of the indexed -> rgba by FileOp class).. Could you please check if this is reproducible in 1.2.4 (several crashes were fixed). Sorry the late response in this one. Is this still not working on v1.2.4? Did you try resizing the window?. Thanks for the feedback both of you! That's sound strange, something to check in a future when the new back-end for Linux is ready #139 too . I cannot reproduce it yet, but I think it might be related to the data recovery feature that is trying to save the background information while we move the selection. I'll be checking this one.. This will be available in the first v1.3 beta. Hi @amzeratul, I'll be working on this issue today as it was already reported by a couple of other users. I have a Surface Pro to test it so a fix might appears next week ASAP.. It looks like your build directory (CMakeCache.txt inside it exactly) is broken. Mainly pointing to an non-existent macOS SDK, this is the key message:\n```\n  Ignoring CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT value:\n   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.12.sdk\n\nbecause the directory does not exist.\n``\nIt can happen that your macOS updated your Xcode installation and now the SDK is MacOSX10.13.sdk. You can delete yourbuilddir and start over, or open theCMakeCache.txtand replaceMacOSX10.12.sdkwithMacOSX10.13.sdk`.. Oh no no you don't want to do that \ud83d\ude28 . You're messing your macOS SDK installation, Xcode might got confused with your SDKs (this 10.12 is not 10.12, is 10.13 now, why this is 10.12?). Anyway if you don't use your Mac for developing regularly, you can do whatever you want with it.. There is no GPU acceleration, and you might have compiled the debug version.. @yvanc did you was able to compile it? anyway I've no plans to deal with antiviruses exceptions in the compilation process, generally you should disable the antivirus in building folders (mainly to accelerate the building process). (I'll close this issue but you can continue writing comments about how you solve this issue). @tony I know the Skia situation is not ideal, but seeing all the work Google is doing on Skia (which is used on Chrome) I don't think in a better library with more maintenance than Skia at the moment.. Aseprite loads/saves the palette only for Indexed images, and for RGB images it auto-generates the palette. I guess you are saving a palette inside a RGB png, I'm not sure if that is correct, I have to do some testing (e.g. how an RGB png + palette inside is shown in the browser when the RGB image contains more colors than the palette).\nMy recommendation at the moment: save your files as 8-bit indexed files (PNG_COLOR_TYPE_PALETTE color type) to preserve the palette.. > I'm saving with Color Mode as Indexed via Aseprite. They are saved as 8-bit index files already.\nFrom what I can see in this image it's an RGB image, not an indexed one. I'm saying that you should save the png file as an indexed image from your tool (not from Aseprite).\nAnyway I'm not sure if I understood correctly what you want to achieve with Aseprite. If you are saving indexed images and you expect that Aseprite should optimize/remove unused palette entries, that will not happen: Aseprite will keep the original palette (because gamedevs expect to use the original indexes, not an optimized indexed version with remapped indexes).. Could you please compare your code with Aseprite code?\nLoad: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/src/app/file/png_format.cpp#L62\nSave: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/src/app/file/png_format.cpp#L345\nIt's using libpng so you might find what is the exact problem.. Glad it was useful to fix your code!. Related to #1453 and #1512 . Both fixes to be released on v1.2.5. Taking note about this one. A temporary fix would be to use the CLI from the C:\\Users\\Saxxon\\Documents\\ directory in this case (which it looks will generated your desired output):\nC:\\>cd C:\\Users\\Saxxon\\Documents\nC:\\Users\\Saxxon\\Documents>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Aseprite\\aseprite.exe\" -b Sprite-0002.ase --data Sprite-0002.json --sheet Sprite-0002.png. Do you have some log file? Travis is building on Linux and it looks like it's working.. @cyraid did you try creating a new build folder from scratch?. do you have some console output? that would be really helpful . Did you update the submodules?\ngit submodule update --recursive. The important part in the console output was this:\n\n```\nCMake Error at third_party/CMakeLists.txt:43 (add_subdirectory):\n  The source directory\n/home/******/Development/aseprite-src/third_party/giflib\n\ndoes not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.\n```\nWhich means that the giflib directory inside third_party didn't contain a CMakeLists.txt file (so maybe the giflib dir was outdated or need to be removed, because it was replaced with a submodule \"recently\"). Hi @vosspl, thanks for this PR. Please check our CLA signing process.. Hi @vosspl, sorry for the late response. I've verified the icon with Visual Studio and ase.ico includes a strange image:\n\n(Also 128x128 and 256x256 images are 512x512 images.)\nAnyway don't worry, I've recreated the images and include the bigger version (128x128 and 256x256) in the current .ico in this commit: 543752d7084d348f4e9b6bbe52de51dac833bb15\nI'll wait for the 512x512 until I can give a try to other .ico editor and testing this on Windows Vista.\nThanks for your help anyway and for reporting this issue!. Hi @opeter, thanks for this PR. Please check our CLA signing process.. @opeter sorry for the late response in this one, I wasn't able to test the change in Ubuntu but I'll try to do it today.. As I cannot test XFS filesystem or exFAT right now, I'll merge the patch, I've tried on Ext4 and it works as usual so basically it can only fix things. Thanks for the contribution @opeter. . Cherry picked here 70f0496cd94741f3dc2ad4a962221807edbc89c7 . \ud83e\udd14  This one is a little tricky. It might trigger the \"select layer\" accidentally using ctrl+click when we just want to copy the layer. On macOS this is not a problem because the Command key is the one used for the Move tool. On Windows and Linux we have this overlapping.\nI'm not yet sure what to do with this one.. Actually this is a little tricky. The algorithm to collect colors from the image should be modified or the performance would decrease significantly to keep the order. I might add an option for the user, a checkbox [x] keep color order even for more than 256 colors.. Hi @KashouC, actually, there is no selection command that re-enable the View > Show > Selection Edges option automatically.\nThis brings several issues:\n\nThe edge boundaries generation is slow/locks the UI when the selection is too irregular (this might be fixed calculating the boundaries in a background thread, long time ago I tried to do this, but never finish the implementation)\nIf the resulting edges are too irregular, it will be too visually noisy to work with (this might be a case for a new option to show the selection only when it is simple enough, e.g. one or two rectangles)\nI was just testing and found a crash selecting with the magic wand and using an undo limit of 1MB (the crash happens when the undo history is too big and we have to start deleting old undo states).\n\nSo several things to be fixed.. Thanks for that video! My mistake here. It looks like I tried to replicate the Photoshop behavior, and now I'm not sure if that should work in that way \ud83d\ude05 \nLet's make Ctrl+A re-enable the selection as you said originally. And maybe a new option to disable this \"show selection edges automatically\".. Yeah, actually this is a problem in my build pipeline. The first thing that I do is creating the Source.zip file from the Git content, then, I use that zip to build on each platform (the build process includes a script that modify the version). In a future I'll modify this so the version is updated before the compression.. I guess this is the same as the one discussed here #1024. Do you have some kind of undo limit? Check Edit > Preferences > Undo > Undo Limit (uncheck the option to have \"infinite\" undo). When you say \"lost all my work\", do you mean the program crashes?\nRight now I'm investigating about a issue using the selection tool and the Undo Limit, and the program does crashes in certain situations. Please confirm me if you have the Undo Limit option enabled with some specific value.. I think this is because the Window Manager is using Alt key to do other thing. Can you confirm me if Alt key does change to the tool but then clicking in the window just move the window? Or the Alt key does absolutely nothing?\nIn my Ubuntu installation, I've set the Windows key to be the key to move/resize windows with the mouse (so Win+mouse buttons will modify the window position/size, this by default is Alt+mouse buttons on Ubuntu).. I have to review this because we might not need the dxguid library anymore (it was something for the Allegro port).. Duplicate #578 . Yes, there are several keys competing when we use the selection:\n\nWith the Shift key we can switch to the \"Add\" selection mode, we press the mouse button, and then the Shift key starts acting to select a square. The solution at this moment is releasing the Shift key after we used it initially to start the \"Add\" selection mode. So: Press Shift, press mouse button, release Shift key, move the mouse, and then release the mouse button.\nThe Alt+Shift is a little tricky, to select the subtraction mode we have to press Shift key, and then Alt key. If we press Alt key first, the eyedropper tool is selected (which can be useful to change the background color used in a cut operation, there were an issue where this was discussed, I cannot remember). So: Press Shift, then press Alt, press the mouse button, now you are in Subtraction mode (if you press Alt key first, the Eyedropper is selected). As an alternative method, you can use the right click to subtract selection areas.\n\nI'm still not sure how to solve these UI problems.\n. It looks like it doesn't work with the English keyboard layout (I use the Spanish keyboard layout, and it's working with that layout). A fix for v1.2.6 planned.. Were you able to update the submodule? or do a new clone from scratch?. \ud83e\udd14  it looks more like a Git issue than an Aseprite issue, if it happens other time, you can add more information (you can use this same issue, even if it's closed).. - [x] Radial gradient requested on Steam too: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/1/3182216552785250054/\n- [x] About \"sprite invertion\", do you mean flipping the image horizontally or vertically? (e.g. Edit > Flip Horizontal/Vertical, or Sprite > Canvas > Flip) or to invert colors? (e.g. Edit > Invert...)\n- [ ] More colors in gradient: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/0/1495615865217629531/ and https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1522\n. Thanks @SagePtr . Hi @jdeeny, thanks for your contribution, you will need to sign our CLA to continue. I'll check the fix later and see how it works.. Hi @jdeeny, this solution has a problem where the palette color is not updated when the hex value is edited (in Palette Edit mode, F4 key). I'll try to fix the original problem generating the signal anyway so the palette can be edited changing the hex value.. Finally fixed in 5d9bbe6651620d1490438abe0a5282286b08e5b8 . It looks like you are using the x86 compiler on a x64 machine. You should start the command line with the proper compiler (for a host 64 bit). I'm not in a Windows machine right now. Some info:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-enable-a-64-bit-visual-cpp-toolset-on-the-command-line\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts\n. Hi @orelbon, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly, what does it mean to change the \"color property\" of a palette color?. Thanks @winterheart, I didn't know the ExternalProject_Add function. I'll make some comments in the code.. I think this is the original requested from #1395. At the moment I'm not sure what angles would make sense:\n\nI might add just one extra angle and leave this one for a future and try to release tomorrow the new version. We'll see.. Hi @codedcosmos,\n\nyou can see #1118,\nyou can use the CLI with the --save-as dog{tag}/dog{tagframe1}.png\n\nMore info:\nhttps://www.aseprite.org/docs/cli/#save-as\nhttps://www.aseprite.org/docs/cli/#filename-format\nhttps://www.aseprite.org/docs/cli/#split-tags\n. Hi @noqqe, could you please send me the .ase file to support@aseprite.org? did the file contained a lot of files or layer folders? or just a plain list of layers?. @vovchisko are you using Aseprite v1.2.9? This should be fixed in v1.2.10-beta4. Are you using the eyedropper? or what color picker specific? With the eyedropper, you have several options in the context bar:\n\nYou can select RGB+Alpha to force the RGB sliders.. ~~At the moment the only possible way is using the new scripting capabilities.~~ Oh sorry, you was asking for source code.. @yuxshao I've been working in a new algorithm but never finished it. I'll try your PR in these days, it looks good for me (maybe in a future I'll replace all algorithms, but that's a long term solution).. Actually this can be done but you have to File > Save As, or File > Export with a filename like name01.png, or name001.png, etc.. >  I think it would be great if you could treat them as objects on a special layer on top of the layer list.\nI had the same idea for the \"animation support\" in #721. My idea is to handle slice keyframes like cels in the timeline. So there should be a \"slices\" folder with each slice in there and we should be able to manipulate the keyframes of each slice (this will be for v1.3 but requires several changes in the timeline code that might introduce new bugs).\n\nSlice Name Popup on Mouse Hover\n\nIt's a good idea, maybe related to this topic where sometimes we don't know in which layer we are going to draw (so the layer/slice name as a floating text might be a possible idea).\nAbout the other ideas, they looks great! thanks for posting this.. This week I'll release v1.2.7. I've to check several crash report that I've been receiving in these months and try to fix them for the release, but I'd love to have v1.2.7 ready for this week.. @Gasparoken please contact me before you start working on this issue. It looks like a problem where the skia repo wasn't completely synced. Try running\npython tools/git-sync-deps\n\nagain in the skia directory until it doesn't fail.. Hi @KashouC, yeah, some time ago I though about it and some possible UI indicator should be added to see where the frame could be drop (+ some text in the status bar like layers group). I'll see what I can do.. Dragging tag edges was an idea from the very beginning (just like dragging onion skin edges) but never had time to implement \ud83d\ude05  Also mentioned in #1275. Done c3a0c00a623ea748aa091fb4517769a8bdc5deb7 \ud83d\udc4d . Known issue. The \"key\" color (border/bg color) is read from the top-left corder. A possible solution would be to identify if there are two or three corners with the same color, and reduce the edge/corner from that side. I've to think in the details about this, but should not be too hard to make it looks like it works correctly.. Fixed with #1661 . Thanks @yuxshao for this fix, I'll give a try and merge the PR soon.. @yuxshao I've just merged the PR, thanks for the patch!. It looks like you've compiled Aseprite, you can debug the problem pressing the \"debug with Native Only\" or send me a screenshot after pressing that link, it should show the exact code line where the program crashes.. Do you have some exact steps to reproduce this crash? What is the structure of your sprite (layers/groups)? Did you move a layer inside/outside a group or something like that?. I was able to reproduce it! thanks for the video and help. At the moment it looks like a problem in v1.3-dev, because I wasn't able to reproduce the problem on v1.2.6.. Pretty sure this regression was introduced in d59fd204892b193a72d374053c22b522ac151f7e (where now Timeline::hitTest() can return a Timeline::Hit::layer = -1) trying to fix other bug\nSoon I'll commit a patch for this.. Hi @Shiroifuyu, please check the latest commit 6012f2389f1c9903dca7f5ad35738e5f8ce6186f which should fix this issue.. Thanks for reporting this! Just in case, there is a MIT licensed .ase decoder in the dio module.. At the moment I'm not sure if merging this PR or using a new implementation (in addition to add rotated ellipses). I've just merged this, and I'll make the minor fixes in the review. Don't worry and thanks for the PR @yuxshao!. This was already discussed a couple of years ago and at the moment I'm not planning to make any change in the short term.\n\nThere is also a non-enforceable restriction on reverse engineering (I don't know the rationale behind having it in the EULA).\n\nThis is because it's a generic EULA. I use the official distributed Aseprite-v...-Source.zip files to compile official distributions anyway so there is no extra code in the binary.\n\ne.g. distributing snap or AppImage that would build Aseprite directly\n\nThe automatic compilation process by third party scripts (this is, if you don't follow the INSTALL.md guide) is not considered that you have compiled the source code. This is a weak point in the EULA which is not well defined (i.e. what does it means that \"you may only compile\" in the 2.g point?).\nAt the moment I don't want to make a great deal about it. So if some distribution or people are using these \"shortcuts\" to compile Aseprite, it's ok.\n\nHope you'll reconsider the decision.\n\nAt the moment I'll not use the GPL. (I've switched all my open source projects from GPL to MIT too, more freedom for the user and the developer.)\nMaybe in a far future this will be converted to a fully open source license, but that might means something like \"I've just stopped working on this, so now it's all yours\", which could be the worst possible signal for the users (i.e. the program has been abandoned). My plans right now: continue working on Aseprite as much as possible (maybe 10, 15, or 20 years more with this).\nThe EULA might change in the future for the better, so it includes your use cases e.g. personal usage might include family usage too, so you can distribute in your family circle. Something to be considered.. A couple of years ago I've already took a decision about this issue. And I don't think you are in the position to say that GPL is the best EULA for Aseprite (or for any kind of software where you were not involved). If you want, you can license your own software with whatever license you want, and that is just fine, because you wrote your software, but you have to respect the decision of other developers.\nAnd personally, I don't think that writing non-free software is a way to disrespect your users, there are a lot of way to respect and disrespect users. That's the FSF point of view, and I don't agree with it. I guess the FSF should start respecting developers first.. I'm not sure if this is related to Snap to Grid or is the same issue that #1412. I must say \"no\" because 1) I don't know what is the rationale behind this, and 2) the \"or later\" clause gives a lot of control/power to the FSF which is the institution that creates/writes new GPLs. So the answer is no.. I think that you can integrate GPLv3 code in GPLv2 code. I don't remember where I read this but I think the normal way to continue working on GPLv2 code with GPLv3 code is just integrating the GPLv3 code. Basically the new written source code is licensed in GPLv3, so it contains the new clauses.\nAnyway, I'll be working on the clip library to add support for Linux in these days, so stay tuned.. May be related to: https://community.aseprite.org/t/export-sprite-sheet-black-background-and-outlines-changed/235. Fixed in c59f03a7a0513133aba1f2bbf793d37332a5747d . I guess the problem appears when the zoom is 50% or less. This is because Aseprite doesn't use some kind of interpolation to render pixels on lower zoom levels. I'll see to add some kind of interpolation when the zoom is reduced.. I've been working in a new method to render the editor canvas using some antialiasing when zoom < 100% (and fix #1489 + should work with any level of zoom, i.e. smooth zoom). More news about this soon. Preview\n. \n. Aseprite requires X11 for the Unix-like port.. This is already implemented in v1.2.10-beta4: https://community.aseprite.org/t/feature-request-intersect-with-selection-tool/1797/12. Hi @Tyrannosaurus1234, this is an issue on the Linux port (that still uses Allegro library). There are plans to use a hardware cursor on Linux too (Windows and macOS are already done). This is related to #139 . I think duplicate to #593 (related to all composition issues).\nAs first step my plan is to implement #1321 which should have the possibility to use linked .ase files for reference layers, so then the next step is just using linked .ase files. Also I was thinking in these days about the possibility to use slices or just a part of a linked .ase file, so this could enable some of the tilemap editor features.. There are plans to do something like this (you can find all composition and tilemap issues).\nThe task is monumental, so I would recommend you to start working in something else first (fixing a bug, some small feature), because it's almost impossible that I'll accept as a first PR something so big (the review process would be almost impossible to handle for me).\nI'm already working in the tilemap editor and fixing the reference layer, so stuff that I'm already working on will allow linking .aseprite files, so I don't know if it makes sense to start working on this.. Sorry but the idea of the official distribution is to have almost no dependencies so Aseprite can be used in most distributions.. Oh sorry again \ud83d\ude04, I guess you are talking about adding these options in the CMakeLists.txt!. Yeah, I guess this option should be removed. There were plans to create a mini webserver to request information about sprites directly to Aseprite, but then I abandoned the idea. Maybe for a future.. Webserver was removed in f8cb1db917a18a9ed7c94eea16672a51b913338a. Hi @goobliata, I'll add another default extension for sprite sheets (and maybe for File > Export too). The issue here is that (I guess) most people will like to default to .ase (or .aseprite) in File > Save, and to .png in File > Export Sprite Sheet.\nAbout File > Export, at the moment it uses png when we're trying to export a static file, or .gif when we try to export an animation. I guess this should be configurable too.. \n. @Torguen there is not difference (just like .jpeg and .jpg), but .aseprite is preferred because Photoshop uses .ase for its Adobe Swatch Exchange file.. Known issues @KashouC. The rotation affects the behavior of both tools in significant ways. Related in some way with the \"Alternative mode to create planned rectangle/ellipse shapes before the final fill/stroke\" item in #1387 . Hi @mPolr, at the moment I'm thinking that handling translations through extensions might be a best option than integrating the translations into Aseprite code. Check these:\n\nJapanese\nKorean\n\nAs I cannot evaluate PRs in other languages correctly, I guess it would work better if the translation is decentralized in a language specific group. (e.g. you could create the Russian translation and distribute it through https://itch.io)\n. There is a change in 1.2.7 where we can replace color (or apply any filter) in the selected cels in the timeline:\nhttps://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/976053554552164352\nAnyway it is not an optimal solution and there are some bugs, so the button will come back (next week 1.2.7.4). I'll label this as wontfix just because the PATH shouldn't include information about other compilers, or this is a cmake issue. Anyway it's nice to have the issue open just in case other people has this same problem knows the solution.. You might try using --ignore-layer to exclude a specific group, but you should know the name of each group on each sprite \ud83d\ude22 . Should be the frames duplicated right after the last selected frame?. Hi @KashouC, no intentional change on this. I'll take a look.. Just in case, are there some special cases where the undo is slower? e.g. undoing changes in the timeline (new frames/delete frames/layers, etc.) or the canvas, etc.. I guess it's related to the \"color selector\" area (and worse if it's a color wheel):\n\n. I'm going to fix this implementing the idea of this issue #1516. @KashouC please check the v1.2.8 version, the color wheel shouldn't be an issue now on undo/redo. I'll see if I can add something in the next release. Sometime ago I thought about this but delay the feature until some user ask for it \ud83d\ude05 \nAbout this bug:\n\nOn a side note: The sliders are 1px shorter for HSV (I didn't wanted to create another issue for such a small bug)\nActually that is because the \"V\" key of HSV is a little bigger than the other letters, and the layout of labels+sliders is automatically calculated with the width of the letters, something tricky to fix in this case. (I might fix it making RGB and HSL sliders shorter \ud83d\ude2c). \n. The New File dialog displays the clipboard image width/height by default if the clipboard contains an image. If the clipboard doesn't contain an image, the dialog will display the latest used size. If you want to create several images of the same time, my personal recommendation are:\n\n\nCreate several sprites with the same size from the very beginning\nOr just create a template.aseprite file, so each time you need to create a new sprite, just open your template (or drag and drop it to Aseprite) and you will start with your preferred size.. Hi @yurivict, I've removed the flag because I cannot test it in all Linux distributions at the moment. The new change is that Aseprite needs some extra libraries now (that are in the webp code but I'm not sure if they are distributed with webp package):\n\nCheck: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L230\nset(WEBP_LIBRARIES webp webpdemux webpmux)\n\nIf webpdemux and webpmux libraries are distributed with webp, we can add the flag back. Anyway I would prefer that a FreeBSD user (that can check if the change work) introduce the fix with a PR.. I'll give a try to find_library for each individual library.. @yurivict I've tested using the shared webp included in Ubuntu 14.04 but it failed. You can give a try to the shared-webp branch.. I guess the problem here is because the native macOS menu. See that Left and Right arrows are associated with Frame > Jump to > Previous/Next Frame menu items and , and . are not (you will see that the macOS menu bar doesn't flashes when you use , and . but it does when you use Left/Right arrows.). Known about it, never give a try (mainly because it wasn't widely adopted by web browsers \ud83d\ude22). It looks like since last year Chrome supports APNG too.. In the community. You can drag-and-drop the selection edges (you just have to put the mouse in the edge):\n\n. HI @mchiasson, are you using File > Export with the \"Export for Twitter\" option enabled?. We have to check if this is still reproducible.. @niedzielski we've tried to reproduce this issue but it looks like it doesn't exist anymore in the beta version, could you give a try to Aseprite v1.2.10-beta4?. This is possible using the Skia backend.. Does elementaryOS use Ctrl key for something in special? (e.g. old version of Ubuntu used Alt key + mouse click to drag windows or resize). Thanks @tcyrus, I've fixed this reordering memset after the check just to avoid using calloc (just in case in the future I use config.h and base_malloc).. hi @sky13d, did you try to post an issue or can I remove this?. Hi @userid0, these commands are for the Windows command line (cmd.exe). Double-quotes \"\" is the escape sequence to specify a single quote \" inside a string \"...\" in cmd.exe. Are you using Bash or something similar? I've to test the commands again on Windows.. I'll give a try to this tomorrow. I hope Microsoft didn't change the way cmd.exe works.. There are several issues, everything labeled with tilemap \ud83d\udc4d . I'll leave this other link about tile bitmasking.. For a moment I thought it was related to an invalid SKIA_DIR (SKIA_DIR=C:\\deps=skia). Hi @FunkTank, I'll try to reproduce this issue here in my PC.. A couple of things:\n\nInternally, the code actually supports different palettes on each frame, because from long time I wanted to add support for color cycling animations. Furthermore, the original mockup of the timeline included a row for the palette changes.\nGIF files should be encoded/decoded in two possibles ways: a) with one palette per frame or palette changes (to solve this issue), b) like right now, the file is converted to/from RGB when there are more than 256 colors because GIF files can contain more than 256 colors in one frame.. Oh yeah, the RGB -> Indexed quantization is terrible. I'll try to fix this for 1.2.9.\n\nAs a side note @oceanhahn, you can avoid adding \"bug\" or \"feature request\" to the title of the issue \ud83d\ude1d . I've added critical priority but this issue might be split on two:\n\nfixing the gif quatization (critical priority)\nadd color cycling animation support (#1067) (not critical). As @KashouC said, it's the expected behavior (or maybe I'm not aware of something else). I think the INSTALL.md in v1.2.8 is out dated. In the latest INSTALL.md (master branch), the branch to compile Skia is aseprite-m67 (instead of aseprite-m62 as in v1.2.8). I think with Skia in branch aseprite-m67, Aseprite should compile directly without this workaround.. hi @nenodias, could you please include the output from the console?\n\n@KashouC I think I should add an option to completely ignore libcurl and all code that depends on libcurl.. I always make that mistake (completelly instead of completely). I'll take a look to this.. I can reproduce it:\n\nSelect a rectangle with the Rectangular Marquee\nMove the selection outside the sprite canvas (you can move just the selection edges dragging the edges)\nDeselect (Ctrl+D)\nReplace Color shows the given error\n\nIn your video, after selecting other area (inside the canvas), and deselecting it, the Replace Color started to work again. (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+D is a workaround too.) I'm going to fix it right now.. Something similar was requested here: https://twitter.com/johanwendin/status/1025384484793982978\nand https://community.aseprite.org/t/repeat-cels-looping-backgrounds-concept/844 and #1275\nNot sure yet how much configuration make it available for tags, but a repeat count for sure.. This is sadly true. I'm not sure how to solve this, but something to think about it (the simplest solution would be a padlock to just lock the timeline or colorbar selection, or a way to change how the selection works/disable automatic-disappearance). I like both solutions actually. I think it does make sense this kind of behavior (as \"Ctrl+click\" actually is already to keep the selection, it could be combined between timeline + color bar). Anyway I guess filters dialogs should be semi non-modal, i.e. make the timeline available for clicking/selecting too.. Also I'm thinking that maybe an \"Apply\" button would be great, so we can change color bar and/or timeline selection and continue modifying hue/saturation/replace color/etc.. I see that there are a lot of interesting use cases to think about here. I guess for v1.2 I'll try to implement @KasumiArai solution as it might be the easiest one (anyway I have to tested it, I'm not completely aware of the internal implications of having both selections (colorbar+timeline) enabled).. I'm thinking in a possible solution for the future:\n\nThere is an menu option View > Duplicate View which could be called View > New View in the future\nIf we select a range in the Timeline and use View > New View we could see only the selected layers/frames/cels, this means that \"New View\" should create a subset sprite of the original one (everything linked from the original sprite, you modify the subset and you're modifying the original sprite in fact)\nAll the filters could be used with the \"All\" option to replace colors in the current subset\n\nA problem with this: You don't see colors in context of the whole sprite \ud83d\ude22 . This is a possibility for v1.2.9: https://imgur.com/parmUzb (maybe in this case the palette shouldn't be modified at the end, only the colors in the pixels of the selected range in the timeline). > relevant cels have a different background colour\nYeah, it will be much better if we show the selection only for the cels that will be changed by a filter like Hue/saturation or replace color, etc.. @oceanhahn contact me at support@aseprite.org, I might prepare an alpha version with this change just to get some feedback, the same for @KashouC and @KasumiArai . I'll put the beta in Steam's beta branch. > I find myself wanting to click the next cel instead of the frame number \nSame feeling here \ud83d\udc4d . > Is there a way to keep the unincluded cels on selected layers and frames at the second-dimmer colour? Perhaps this is intended and the current appearance is a bug.\nI've changed the look on purpose. But I don't like it. We might need another color, but not sure yet (I have to give another try).\n\nDuplicating frames by CTRL-LMB-dragging them in the Timeline causes irrelevant cels in the new (duplicate) frames to be lit using the dimmer of the two Timeline selection colours; deselects all but one layer\n\n+1 Something to be fixed.\n\nCTRL- and SHIFT-LMB both select frames from the Timeline, but only SHIFT-LMB selects layers. CTRL-LMB probably ought to select layers as well.\n\nNot yet sure, I think Ctrl+click should start copying. So maybe shift+click should be the only way to increment selection (just like the rectangular marquee works on the canvas).\n\nIt is not possible to select frames on the Timeline within a preexisting range. For instance, if frames 3 and 10 are selected, CTRL- or SHIFT-LMB on intervening frames (4~9) does not select those frames.\n\nActually I'm testing on Linux and I can click in frames inside the preexisting range with Shift+left mouse button. (Ctrl+click doesn't work, but Shift+click does work.)\n\nWhen multiple layers are selected, it would be handy if the various layer options (lock, show/hide, link new frames..) for all selected layers could be toggled with a single click, perhaps using the icon at the top of the layers list or by holding SHIFT or CTRL.\n\nI've to check if this is already working on an internal v1.3-beta branch I have. But if the idea is not already included for a future beta, it might be implemented anyway as you said.\n\nAs a thought, when multiple selected frames or layers are moved, perhaps they ought to maintain their spacing relative to one another, rather than piling up at the end of the new location? It is a bit hard to predict how frames and layers move this way.\n\nI think this should be solved with the possibility to select/move different range of cels #1510. In v1.2.9 this is not possible, we can select multiple cels shift+clicking layers and frames, but not cels. So moving frames should behave as it behaves (moves everything to the same location), but moving cels should move everything as a fixed block.\n\nIt may be difficult to work out how these frame moves will interact with frame tags\n\nRelated to #1656\n. > Are we making a distinction between CTRL-LMB-Drag and CTRL-LMB here, or are they handled the same way?\n:thinking: I guess that we can make a distintion, but it will complicate a little the code, so low priority at the moment.\n\n\nCtrl+click doesn't work, but Shift+click does work.\nRechecked. SHIFT-LMB does work.\n\n\n:+1: . > losing the lighter-shade row and column backgrounds for irrelevant cels on selected layers and frames is a bit disconcerting\nI didn't find a good way to fix this. With an extra color shade it's too confusing (too many shades). Maybe the timeline could have the same look as 1.2.8 when there isn't a selection of multiple frames, and be like 1.2.9 when there are multiple layers/frames.. > I suppose what I am imagining is something like this\nYeah, I did something like that. There are too many shades, anyway I don't like the 1.2.9-beta1 look, the final result might be something similar to your screenshot.. Fixing this:\n\nDuplicating frames by CTRL-LMB-dragging them in the Timeline causes irrelevant cels in the new (duplicate) frames to be lit using the dimmer of the two Timeline selection colours\n\nBring the following issue too:\n\nwhen multiple selected frames or layers are moved, perhaps they ought to maintain their spacing relative to one another, rather than piling up at the end of the new location? It is a bit hard to predict how frames and layers move this way.\n\nI guess that moving/copying multiple frames + layers will act like moving/copying a block.. I've updated the Steam beta branch with some changes about this.. hi @star0422, sorry but, what are you trying to do?. Related to #722 . Hi @DexterIV, I'll review this PR soon, meanwhile, would you mind to sign the CLA?. Thanks @DexterIV! It works just fine.. I've to take a look to this issue. I don't remember compiling the latest version of Skia, so it might be something of the m67 version.. You should not compile Aseprite with MinGW in your PATH. We support MSVC only.. I guess that we could consider this a cmake bug or a zlib. In the zlib CMakeLists.txt there is this code:\nif(MINGW)\n    # This gets us DLL resource information when compiling on MinGW.\n    if(NOT CMAKE_RC_COMPILER)\n        set(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER windres.exe)\n    endif()\n...\nI don't know why cmake puts MINGW = true in this case, but as I said, I don't have plans to support a mixed compilation (MinGW shouldn't be in the PATH). Sorry.. Did you compile Aseprite with the Allegro backend or Skia backend?. Actually the Allegro port on Windows is not maintained anymore (the official version is the Skia one), so I'm not sure if it does work correctly. I should remove it directly from Windows (after I move the Linux port to Skia, the Allegro code will be finally completely removed, #139).. You can give a try to the Skia port and see if it crashes when you lock/unlock your session.. I'll close this issue but tell me if the problem continues with the Skia version.. This problem happens only with the \"Loop\" tag. Going to fix for v1.2.9. Hi there, is there any other output/compilation error?. Nice catch. The worst thing is that we cannot exit from that state, the sprite is locked forever. EDIT: Oh I see that you exit the state pressing the Alt key... maybe?. Hi @ppfoot, did you compile with the Allegro back-end? Because these kind of problems shouldn't be an issue with the Skia back-end (the Wacom driver should work just fine in the Skia back-end).. I'll close this issue at the moment but you can just comment here in case that you find some problems with the Skia version too.. I think someone asked for this same feature before. It might be easy to implement for the next version.\nNote for developer: we can use this library https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr\n. A simple version will be available in the next release! \ud83d\udc4d . You can write 30*2 and you will get 60 (e.g. if you want to resize x2), or 1000/60 and you will get 33 (e.g. if you want to use Frame > Constant Frame Rate and use 60 fps). Yeah, never had the time to really fixed it. I'll give a try.. Already some work in progress for v1.2.10-beta.\nPatch for macOS https://github.com/aseprite/laf/commit/30481c99dcd37a1abf2f098c49a3822f4c5c6153, we still need to work on Windows and Linux ports.. This kind of issue happen if you compile Skia for x86 or x64 platform and Aseprite for the other platform. Both must be compiled for x86, or for x64 (you cannot combine them).. Thanks @Vcoder89, finally fixed with b767b1868a2b53eafcd259079238fd4104d260a8 which is a reduced version of your patch \ud83d\udc4d thanks for your help!. Known issue. We have to add support for IMEs. Related to #139 . When the issue was implemented by @Gasparoken, he told me about the randomness of the aspect ratio values when the line is too big, which is true. The numbers jumps like crazy:\n\nI don't know what to show in these cases, but from the regular user standpoint, it looks like a bug. Anyway maybe we cannot do nothing about it (or add an option to show/hide the aspect ratio and hide it by default).. There is something already available here:\nhttps://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/tree/master/src/desktop/linux\nUsing a script that calls aseprite. I'll see if I can finally integrate this in the distributed .deb and the Steam installation.. Some time ago there was a discussion about this in the community site.. @huwpascoe a similar idea was proposed here: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/496#issuecomment-379603728. Maybe Shift+Enter could be the default hotkey?. Maybe related to #475.\nAlso GotoPrevious/NextFrameCommand could include a step parameter and we should be able to create a special .aseprite-keys files with these commands with step=5 to our keys.. Actually the Keyboard Shortcuts pane/dialog could show the steps/how many frames correctly, but the only problem (which I would like to fix in a near future) is to be able to change command parameters from the same UI (in this case, the number of frames to jump). It's a lot of customization for the user, so it needs a good UI to avoid adding incorrect commands (at the moment this can be done editing the user.aseprite-keys file in the AppData/Aseprite folder).. Yeah, known issue. At the moment, on macOS you can use the trackpad to scroll, or on other platforms the mouse wheel, but it's just a workaround.. This one was easy \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @KashouC, actually something like that is possible but there is no easy way to do it. You have to modify the data/gui.xml file manually. After the <tool id=\"pencil\" ...> section you might try to add something like this:\n<tool id=\"sel_pencil\"\n            text=\"Selection Pencil\"\n            ink=\"selection\"\n            controller=\"freehand\"\n            pointshape=\"brush\"\n            intertwine=\"as_lines\"\n            tracepolicy=\"accumulate\" />\nThe bad side that I see right now is that the brush size is not shown in this case, so it's something to be fixed in the future, also I might add a new \"Ink\" mode for this kind of behavior:\n\nMore info about the internals here: https://dev.aseprite.org/2015/06/06/the-tool-loop/. There are plans to add customization for the mouse wheel (#680, #970), I'll try to add this for v1.2.9.. Actually I was just testing and you can use Ctrl+mouse wheel to move between frames.. Related to #967 and #1197.\nLet me see if I get it right, e.g. when we have the Pencil tool selected:\n\nIf you left-click/drag with left mouse button, you paint with the Foreground color.\nIf you right-click one pixel (mouse button down and up in the same pixel), it uses Eyedropper for that pixel and you are still in Pencil tool to draw with left mouse button.\nIf you push right mouse button, drag it, and release it, it should behave like the Rectangular Marquee tool, temporarily switch to the Rectangular Marquee, until you right-click again one pixel (which should only deselect and go back to the Pencil tool, without calling the Eyedropper)\nSomething similar could be done with Ctrl+right mouse button and the Lasso tool as specified in #1197.\n\n. So when you use right mouse button to do a rectangular selection, after releasing the right mouse button you start dragging the selection, it looks like there is no chance for scaling/rotation (as you said in a previous post). Can you confirm if it is only translation? I guess that the selection is dragged until you press the left mouse button or the right mouse button again. (or I don't know if they have different behaviors).\nI really have to install GraphicsGale to check how this mode works.\nAnyway there are a lot of possible combinations for this kind of stuff, this might be a possible candidate for #1403 \n. Duplicate of #598, do you have two extra buttons or more? I have a 5 buttons mouse and there are plans to make easily assignable mouse buttons to actions like: trigger a specific tool, or a specific command, or a specific color.. Maybe something to fix in the UI that it's not clear (there is a warning about possible losing of data when saving to png). I think you are looking for File > Export, which doesn't change the filename, instead of File > Save As.... I'll leave the issue open with another title: the idea is that the UI at the moment is a little confusing, because when you save the sprite with a format that loses information (e.g. a png) the layers are still visible in the timeline, but they have been flattened in the png file, so there is a mismatch between what you see in Aseprite and what you have in the disk (and the sprite is marked \"as saved\").. Related to #772, some scroll issues to solve. Hi there! It looks like you have compiled the version with the Allegro back-end on Windows, please try to compile with the Skia back-end because the official version is compiled with the Skia back-end. Check the trial version to compare your version with the official one.\nAlso check if you have compiled with the Release configuration (instead of Debug).. Please check #1797, did you use the Skia back-end?. Hi @Rotekoppen, can you paste the output in the console/terminal?. It looks like the compiler (MSVC) is not set in your command line, you have to start the Visual Studio command line so the cl.exe and link.exe programs are available from the command line. You can check this trying to execute cl or link in the command line, if the command is not found, you are not using the Visual studio command line.. Do you have the Skia library compiled in C:\\deps\\skia directory? From the log it looks like the library wasn't found in that directory.. They should be in C:\\deps\\skia, but don't worry, you can run cmake with -DSKIA_DIR=C:\\deps\\skia\\skia and see if it works. I wasn't able to test this patch, but from a quick peek I can say that we must not change the scroll or invalidate the widget in the same Timeline::onPaint() event handler (also, it looks like it might generate an infinite paint/invalidation/validation/paint cycle until we stop dragging the colors).. @vcoder89 just in case, @gasparoken already has a fix for this issue and he\u2019ll create a new PR soon . Thanks @MelNichols!. Maybe introduced in v1.0.3 (year 2014, 877d498160576a3563c634f78b6bfe986bf1108e), basically some users were asking to have the possibility to deselect with one click (like some other programs). . You're right! I forgot the Add mode. I guess that in Add mode and Subtraction mode, one single click could add/subtract that click to/from the selection.. @Nikitaw99 when I wrote the INSTALL.md guide I didn't have the Visual Studio installer at hand (MS changes the installer by time to time, so instructions might be different on each 2015/7 version), but basically, if you are gonna to compile a C++ program, you need the C++ compiler.. @mariosonic500 you can use the A key to switch the palette editing function. Basically if this padlock is unlocked, it means that the palette can be edited:\n\n. \ud83d\udc4d looks good. The final binary should be available in the bin folder inside the build folder.. I'll take a look to this issue, maybe a recent change breaks the build process.. This is definitely a problem in the master branch, give a try to the last release, you should be able to compile it.\nThis is related to https://github.com/dacap/clip/issues/19 and several changes I did in the CMakeLists.txt files in these days.. Actually if you have the Edit > Preferences > Editor > Auto-scroll on editor edges option checked, moving the mouse at the edge of the editor should scroll, anyway it might be a good idea to have an alternative way to scroll (like with the Spacebar) \ud83d\udc4d . That's true! I'll fix this.. Sometime ago someone else asked for the same thing, I think it's important to preserve the links, not yet sure how to fix it, but I like the idea about the temporary state of empty cels before losing the focus.. Related to this issue, is the File > New command. I'd like to create a new empty temporal cel as the first frame of a new sprite with a transparent layer.\nAt the moment, the \"only way\" (maybe there are other unknown ways) to get a cel of the whole canvas size with the transparent color is when we create a transparent sprite, but after we draw something, the cel is shrunken to the non-transparent pixels. I think this empty cel of the size of the canvas (which is expected in several tests and now Lua scripts), could be a cel with this \"temporal linked state\".. Sorry but I'm not sure what this issue is about \ud83d\ude22 . This is strange but I'm testing on macOS and Shift+click does works for the Eraser. I'll give a try to this on Windows next week.. Hi @Torgue945, do you know the name of the font (.ttf file) in your system that contains Chinese characters? By default Aseprite tries to use Arial Unicode (arialuni.ttf) for Chinese, but might be good to know an alternative that is installed by default on Windows 7.. Cherry picked in 93d0b94929d8260c0a70aaa4b187e2641915d40b with some changes:\n\nReplaced the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+N to Shift+Space+N (because Ctrl+Shift+N will be used in the future to create projects)\nRemoved some trailing whitespaces in NewLayerCommand::onGetFriendlyName().\n. This was fixed with #1950. Thanks for reporting this @theTreadlight, I'll take a look later. Lamentably the Linux clipboard is new (and almost experimental yet) because the interaction depends too much between who owns the clipboard (e.g. Firefox, or the print screen app, etc.) and who receives the data (Aseprite in this case). It might depends on the specific X11 server impl (or wayland impl) too.. As in my previous comment, the clipboard on Linux depends on several factors, mainly the X11 server (or wayland) and the programs that are interacting with the clipboard (so it might be an issue on Aseprite, Firefox, or the X11 on Mint from @theTreadlight, etc.). At the moment, if you press F2 two times (one to create the loop, the second to open the Loop tag properties). This is a fast way to create a loop and rename the loop quickly, it's not as fast as the automatic numbering but it's close enough.. P.S. Maybe this issue could be solved with a script (Aseprite v1.2.10-beta2 introduced Lua scripts), I'll try to write a script for this later.. Sorry about this, but at the moment I'll mark all Allegro-related issues with the wontfix label, because we've just removed the Allegro backend (Aseprite v1.2.10-beta2 is not using Allegro anymore on Linux)..

On the Surface, touch gestures work in this way (two fingers: zoom + scale), with Wacom Aseprite should provide a similar experience. Your solution is a possible workaround.. * Ignoring 3246b09bc591c598aef654a4b9d2b5785ef9105f because it was already included in e0c1c3c1d3180cacf37eac62f80ae517881eed22\n This one 2fb7d4f4e36c882431f4bba4ed960f01ba775c68 was cherry picked here 6eaebefb90cd04062f4d8d22682e166c0e1d3ffc\n And 9915becd9b37a8e669e342d7d35ccb05b94a61a2 was cherry picked here 7b4609d2d1d1ef2b5df9454633d1219379770b45 with some extra formatting to match the original code block. This might be implemented with a script on Aseprite v1.2.10-beta2 using the os.execute() function.. Actually we don't support MinGW toolchain (mainly because we don't use the Allegro back-end anymore, and was finally removed for the next v1.2.10 version), and I think Skia cannot be compiled with MinGW (but I'm not sure about this).. Actually in the INSTALL.md Visual Studio is named as a dependency, anyway it's true that cmake does some crazy things like getting the first compiler that it wants.\nI'm not sure how we could solve this, maybe some extra parameter in the cmake command line that avoid using mingw, or some extra instructions to remove mingw from the PATH.. Yeah, I'll see if I can add something about this, anyway I would love to find a easy way (something provided for cmake, I think setting CC and CXX env vars might a possible solution, but are hard to set to a correct value for MSVC).. The gn command must be executed in the Skia directory. Remember to include depot_tools dir in the PATH (you must follow the exact steps as in the INSTALL.md guide). Yeah, actually the clipboard in the timeline (and the palette) is not handled as well as I would like (better feedback, using the real operating system clipboard so we can copy and paste between different Aseprite instances, etc.). I'll check this issue and all surface related issue \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for the video too \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude03 . OK @Diarandor, I'll close this issue. There is one missing part which is the \"export each tag in a row\", there is an issue about that too #1118 . @Gasparoken you are including other commits on this PR (in the previous PR something similar happened); you will need to send the PR only with one commit from some point of the Aseprite master branch (not from your a derived branch which is not part of the master branch).. Cherry picked in 336407fab6855f638df3448b7ecd51d273d6157d with some modifications.. Ok, so by default the status bar could show the \"filename [ + selection size ] + sprite size\" if there is a active sprite selected (or for example when we move the mouse over a sprite tab we can include this information).. Always planned but never had time to implement, duplicate #1275. :open_mouth: Never noticed that, you're right!. Hi @oceanhahn, I think you've already reported this here #1780, it's fixed for the next release v1.2.10-beta1 to be released soon (hope next week). Known issue, anyway it's nice to have this reported here.. Related to #1111 . Did you try to compile a specific commit (which one) AND v1.2.9? what was the full console output of the cmake command on each case?. The version number in the source.zip doesn't matches the version number in the config.h. This is because we zip the source code as it is and update the version before we compile. So basically you have the equivalent to the v1.2.9 version (but compiled from source code).. If you are going to compile the master branch (not the v1.2.9 zip), then yes, you need to compile Skia first. Please check the steps correctly from the INSTALL.md file, you need the depot_tools first (where is the gn tool). Also there are other steps to sync dependencies for skia.. I'll add libfontconfig1-dev and libgl1-mesa-dev in the INSTALL.md dependencies for Ubuntu (never had the time to find the exact package names). \ud83d\udc4d cherry picked c05c3dad43e34dda854a39ebfa13d59529767466. Thanks @daisyowl for reporting this, I've just fixed it \ud83d\udc4d. Hi @daisyowl, are all frames inside a tag? or you aren't using tags? did you try using just {frame} instead of {tagframe}?. Sorry, definitely it's a bug, I'll try to fix this ASAP for v1.2.10.. \ud83d\udc4d I'm linking a screenshot from tile-extruder:\n. I think this should be fixed for Aseprite v1.2.10 with this commit 6b7ba57ba2ecbbd0b38bffc7d0ab752bbdce49b4 (this problem might be because the fonts is installed in the user Library/Fonts directory and not in the system, and Aseprite v1.2.9 is not loading the user fonts correctly). Soon, in the best case, today I might release a beta version on Steam. Basically the issue that is blocking everything is #1576, but I think it's already in a releasable state for a first version.. Related to  #1767 and  #139. This is a known issue and working in this way by-design, check this post:\nhttps://community.aseprite.org/t/straight-line-with-line-tool-or-pencil-tool-is-a-bit-off/1045/2?u=dacap\nAnyway I might revert this to make Aseprite works more like other programs work. The commit 88e059669229eea4be8f9c425617cca904d25f4d was made to fix #1395, but I think only a line with some specific steps were fixed (and not all cases).. I think I'll restore the old behavior and add an experimental option to keep the old line behavior just in case.. Install libgl1-mesa-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) package or mesa-libGL-devel (Fedora). Actually as this is an internal compiler error, I cannot do much about it. You can try to free some memory, or restart the computer, and run again the command, but if the problem persists, the only solution could be to use another compiler or other version of the same compiler.. Nice to hear that, actually the best way to compile Aseprite is using all the embedded third party libraries (without -DUSE_SHARED_* options).. I think this is a duplicate of #1889. Some other users find the double-click hard to execute: https://twitter.com/deepnightfr/status/1049644157722071045\nI think the issues is this: it's hard to trigger when one want to execute it, and too easy to trigger when one doesn't want, basically, it has an erratic behavior.\nI'm not sure if we need a way to disable the double-click to select a grid cell, or a way to disable it completely in the editor, and create an alternative way to trigger the double-click action (e.g. with a key or an on-screen button). It's a nice idea \ud83d\udc4d . @Gasparoken Some general comments that I thought about:\n\nWe could remove image_palette and use fop-> sequenceGetColor directly in the indexed case.\nThe fprintf that prints colors is duplicated in several places, you could create a simple lambda function to print colors, something like this:\n   c++\n   auto printcol = [f](int x, int y, int r, int g, int b, int a) {\n     fprintf(f, \"<rect x=\\\"%d\\\" y=\\\"%d\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" fill=\\\"#%02X%02X%02X\\\" \",\n             x, y, r, g, b);\n     if (a != 255) {\n       fprintf(f, \"opacity=\\\"%f\\\" \", (float)a / 255.0);\n     }\n     fprintf(f, \"/>\\n\");\n   }\n   And use printcol on each case like:\n   c++\n   printcol(x, y, rgba_getr(c), rgba_getg(c), rgba_getb(c), rgba_geta(c));\n\nIn the indexed case, don't fill with the background color, it might not be the most common color in the image (we could improve then calculating an histogram of the image but we'll not do this at the moment).\n. Cherry-picked here 7564fee319c0e09cdff08e2b8a0e50cd886f8931. As the message says, it looks like you have to update all submodules:\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n. Check if you have the laf/CMakeLists.txt directory inside the Aseprite cloned folder. If not, I recommend you to download the latest release of the source code, and follow the instructions (INSTALL.md file) of that specific version to compile Aseprite.. Hi @josh-perry, did you try using --list-tags option?. No problem @josh-perry \ud83d\udc4d glad it continues working \ud83d\udc31 . @Aphrodites1995 you will need to provide more information, like what version are you trying to compile of the source code (commit hash, or .zip), what specific INSTALL.md instructions are you following (on each version the instructions are different, so this is relevant), and what Skia version did you try to compile.. Hi @Enosade, before the v1.2.10-beta2 release a couple of days ago, I tried to compile aseprite-m71 branch and got the same program, after executing git-sync-deps --help I saw that we can specify the git executable in the GIT_EXECUTABLE environment variable, so don't remember what value I put on GIT_EXECUTABLE, but you can try:\nset GIT_EXECUTABLE=git.bat\npython git-sync-deps\nOr try the full path to a set GIT_EXECUTABLE=C:\\...fullpath...\\git.bat (I remember that I've used the full path to a git.bat file in my file system, but maybe just git.bat without path might work)\n. Sorry, it's python tools/git-sync-deps like in the original INSTALL.md instructions.. Yeah \ud83d\udc4d something in my to-do list for the final version is support for multiple monitor with different color profiles (when we move the window from one monitor to another, the color space can change, so we've to update the surface).\n\n\nYou can check if moving the window to the other monitor, and resizing the window does update the color profile correctly. The same when you change the color profile, but it might not work anyway (I think the color space is taken from the main screen only, not the display where the window is located). did you download the depot_tools?. @Delta456 if you're thinking to add support python 3 support to skia, please contact Skia developers; our branch contains minimal patches for skia (in a perfect world I would like to avoid patching Skia, but that's not possible yet \ud83d\ude22). Skia must be compiled with depot_tools in the PATH environment, and (I think) depot_tools includes python 2.7. You can check that in INSTALL.md the depot_tools is always mentioned.. I think this could be fixed adding a simple & at the end of this line:\nThis:\n  ret = std::system((\"xdg-open \\\"\" + file + \"\\\"\").c_str());\n\nTo:\n  ret = std::system((\"xdg-open \\\"\" + file + \"\\\" &\").c_str());. I'm not sure, but maybe a zoom slider that can be used while we are drawing would be good for this. For example, if we have a mouse + keyboard, to make a precise line we can use the 1,2,3,4,5,6 keys to change the zoom quickly and put the line in the right position.\n\nOther possibility would be to draw lines/rectangles with transformation like one item in #1387:\n\n[ ] Alternative mode to create planned rectangle/ellipse shapes before the final fill/stroke. (Ref 1, Ref 2, Ref 3)\n. Thanks for reporting this @markopolojorgensen. The new beta contains a complete new backend that handles all the keyboard/mouse/display events, so this kind of issues can arise, taking note to fix this ASAP for the next beta.. \ud83d\udc4d I've cherry picked with a modified commit message, but everything looks fine.. The only missing part of this issue is exposing the behavior in the CLI with an argument like --trim-by-grid. This is a recommendation for the future: don't use branch names with ( or ), because they don't work well in the shell (e.g. we need to add quotes to every git command e.g. git checkout -b \"Gasparoken-status-bar-default-text-(fix-#1874)\" master. Cherry picked b3771472c3d1143414a7e9bc294c42e4755e9ad1 with minor changes.. Similar to this idea:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/890290936277762049\n. After compiling Skia, when you run cmake for Aseprite, you've to provide the SKIA_DIR, check the macOS details section from your INSTALL.md file.. I think here the problem is that using example1.png will load the whole sequence of files (example2.png, example3.png, example4.png, etc.). You try using the -oneframe argument to avoid this or frame-range 0,0. I'll take a look to this one!. \ud83d\udc4d cherry picked c1b61fedbf718cc48adcb51e3b6f3456f426f1d7 . From INSTALL.md file in v1.2.9 you need aseprite-m67 branch from https://github.com/aseprite/skia, anyway, I would recommend you to use the latest version of Aseprite (1.2.10-beta3, or the master branch) and use Skia aseprite-m71 branch. Hi @heyitsmeuralex. Actually a couple of issues: 1) the WM_CLASS = allegro should not appear anymore (as the Allegro back-end was removed from the master branch, it looks like you are running an old version compiled with allegro), and 2) Anyway I've tested the latest version and it doesn't provide a WM_CLASS.\nSo I'll try to fix the .desktop file distributed in .deb packages and the WM_CLASS property so all windows are grouped/handled correctly in some window managers.. \ud83d\ude22oh thanks for reporting this, I'll prepare a fix next week. Thanks @rajivmg, I'll merge this one tomorrow and I guess it will be available in 1.2.10-beta4 (which must be released next week because some regressions in beta3).. Hi @xentripetal, there are no plans to add support to other file formats of third-party sprite editors (at least not formats that are not widely used, maybe in the future I could add support for TiledMap or PyxelEdit formats).\nMy recommendation for this case is that you could create a .lua script to load/save pixaki files (using io.open()), that would be easier to program (because you don't need to use C++).. Added in 91c5ed8fd41666f4114830c530ccef721aae2750 with some comments in a2648c26bf802d221d1e7a49dbb63b8fffdd1280 \ud83d\udc4d . It's probable that you have saved a file on Windows with Aseprite v1.2.10-beta4, which creates the chunk 8199 (0x2007, the color profile chunk), and then opened the file with v1.2.9.. Known issue on the latest beta, already fixed as @KashouC said, I think it was fixed with 53f2b4a121fa0ee1b8023e3515399ae9721ae252 . At the moment the gtk+ file selector is disabled because it creates a hard dependency with gtk+ and gdk libraries. A possible solution in the future would be load gtk+ functions dynamically.. I see that that project has the same issue: it depends directly on the gtk header files/library.. \ud83d\udc4d Some idea I hear about some time ago too. Probably related to #1575 . Actually Alt+C, Alt+S, and Alt+N should work (the \"naked\" shortcut like C, S, and N are not enabled because are too easy to press).. Hi @oceanhahn, this might be because the filter is being applied in an empty cel (or a cel that is almost transparent in the area).\nDoes your sprite contains several layers? or just one layer? is the brightness/contrast filter applied to several layers (e.g. when \"All\" option is selected).\nIt might happen that the preview layer is displayed correctly and applied correctly because the filter is applied to just one layer, but after applying the filter, if there is another layer above, maybe all its pixels are set to a black color. (check if you can remove the content of the other layer and leave only the content in the layer that you was previewed correctly).. I have Mojave 10.14.1 (still not updated to 10.14.2) and the Alt key works, I'll give a try to 10.14.2 next week, just in case. Try to reset all your keyboard shortcuts from Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts > Reset (you can Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts > Export them before just in case and send it to me to support@aseprite.org ).. I've updated to 10.14.2 but the Alt key is working correctly. Do you have some special driver/device? (magic mouse, wacom stylus, etc.). Nice to hear that the issue is solved! \ud83d\ude04 . Can someone check if disabling the native clipboard fix this issue?\n\n. You might try updating the master branch to the latest commit (fed1b19050177e839e21b2ac5c295f2c602570dd and calling git submodule update --init --recursive too) which includes a XInitThreads() call. It would be great if you can help me testing this change \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @sherjilozair, as @KashouC said, this is related to the non-linear history. This option is not the default one (so I'm not sure how it was enabled/checked in your case), so by default the program behave as a regular linear history.\nAnyway, Photoshop has a similar option for non-linear history as Aseprite does, and it is easier to understand when the Undo History window is visible:\n\nAnyway as @KashouC said, unchecking the option should go back to the default behavior/well-known linear undo history.. Maybe related to #1463. Known issue, something to be fixed soon. Check this:\nhttps://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1626#issuecomment-360795100\n. I cannot reproduce this issue either. How are you launching/starting Aseprite? Do you have some special keyboard? what Mac hardware are you using? (MacBook, iMac, etc.). Same issue as the other one, I didn't know that it was about the native file dialog, I was able to reproduce it in the native dialog \ud83d\udc4d . I'm trying to reproduce this but I'm not able, do you know in what state the program should be to see the disabled system menu?. Oh if it's related to the native file dialog it can have problems (because the feature is still experimental, it's not working correctly on macOS).. Thanks @SupSuper, I'll take a look to this PR soon.. Cherry-picked here 3dc76d08c4152249485a3ce84f939fecb04f374a \nI've removed some changes in the theme.xml which were unrelated with the feature..

(Maybe this issue might appear if libturbo is installed in the system, but I'm not sure.). Oh I see that skia_use_system_libjpeg_turbo=false is already there, so not sure why skia_use_libjpeg_turbo=false is needed.. Hi @lrasomattos, so instead of extruding each frame, we should extrude each grid tile, right? Sounds like a nice option. I think it can be useful to combine with other option (e.g. adding padding to grid tiles, etc.).\nWith this option I guess that each grid tile and each frame of the animation counts like a different item to extrude in the final sprite sheet.. Hi @tiskolin, that's strange, the blur tool shouldn't be slow even in that or bigger resolution. Can you give a try to the beta version just in case? It uses a complete different way to handle mouse events on Linux.. Glad you figured out, at the moment this behavior is intentional as you saw when the opacity is < 255.. Hi @snarlynarwhal, are you using --split-layers with --save-as? or with --sheet? Could you please copy the exact command line that you are using?\n. I'll add something about it in the docs, also, if I remember correctly, I think that you can combine --split-layers with -all-layers in case that you want to export all layers.. Merged d4607e889b8506d2a996b52850e58657f5fae5fa.\nThere is one critical thing to fix in this Import Sprite Sheet dialog: The padding rulers should be moved when a border is moved:\n\nWhen padding > 0 it's wrong, because the padding ruler is not moved, but in the second case it's right, when padding = 0, because \"it looks like\" the padding rulers is moved with the border (anyway, in that case there is no padding, padding = 0, so there is no ruler to move)..

Compiled versions should always have -dev suffix to avoid confusion when we give support. So if the title bar says -dev, I have to ask for the commit number, if it says v1.2.9 I know that I can test the issue with my copy of v1.2.9..

Hi @rscotchmer, in case you want to make a contribution, please check the CLA signing process first.\nAbout this specific issue, my idea is to have a button set (*) with a couple of buttons in this menu:\n\nto switch between both options (4-connected pixels, 8-connected pixels). \n(*) The button set must be something similar to the ones in the brush options menu:\n\nbut it can have a couple of icons to show the connection of pixels (+ tooltips).\n. Please try to use commit -amend and push -force to make easier the merge and avoid a lot of little commits.\nPlease also give you a time for testing. . From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA#Header it looks like the TGA header contains some special bits to indicate if the image has or not the alpha channel (and that should determine if the resulting layer should be a background layer or a transparent one):\n\nImage specification (field 5) has six subfields:\nX-origin (2 bytes): absolute coordinate of lower-left corner for displays where origin is at the lower left\nY-origin (2 bytes): as for X-origin\nImage width (2 bytes): width in pixels\nImage height (2 bytes): height in pixels\nPixel depth (1 byte): bits per pixel\nImage descriptor (1 byte): bits 3-0 give the alpha channel depth, bits 5-4 give direction\n\nThis shows us an extra bug where we are saving TGA files incorrectly for opaque sprites (including the alpha channel when we shouldn't).\nMaybe this PR could fix:\n\nthe onLoad: calling fop->sequenceSetHasAlpha(true); when the descriptor_bits has bits related to the alpha channel ((descriptor_bits & 0xf) == 8).\nthe onSave: save the alpha depth (8) only if the sprite is RGB and is not opaque.. It works great \ud83d\udc4d  cherry picked 5cb0adc46a32fe9be269ac470a410ae2a337899e. Just in case, we don't support MinGW, on Windows you have to use Visual Studio 2017.. Oh yeah, that should be the issue, because there are some MinGW-related paths in the error console (e.g. C:\\PROGRA1\\HASKEL1\\847A5C~1.3\\mingw\\bin\\cc.exe).. Actually this is already available in Aseprite v1.2.10-beta4. Yes, it's.. Hi @franzrogar, thanks for this! as you see there are some missing characters in the minifont. I was planning to create this translation as an external package but never had enough time \ud83d\ude2d Could you please send a PR to https://github.com/aseprite/spanish-extension and check the contributing guide to sign the CLA.\n\nAnd I'll check these issues (no promises for next release). hi @KelvinShadewing, can I ask from where are you pasting content? sometimes on Linux it depends what content you copy & paste. You can also try disabling the native clipboard option just in case you are only copying/pasting content inside Aseprite:\n\n. I'll merge this commit with some minor changes and then do other commits to fixes tests and other minor things.. Merged in f53544842cd2bb7545c00810e427cf88e196bb91 with minor changes. I'll fix the render_tests which is throwing an error.. Would you like to add \"override\" on this one? (like onLoadParams and onExecute). (PS. thanks for the patch :smile:)\n. No problem :+1: I'm here to review these commits and help you :wink:\n. Rename this to isHomeSelected()\n. Hmm, I think I've to rename that function too. Just as a side note, there are several refactors that I should do but I've never time to do them. And sometimes, there are ways to do the same thing in two different ways (because a refactored-better way was created, but it didn't invalidate the old one). I've to write a document about that.\n. Is this really needed? The onEnabled() condition should filter this case. (Anyway you may have added this for some special case.)\n. Nice catch. I think this is a bigger problem. I think that several other commands could be affected by this kind of scenario (Home tab is selected, and we use a command that uses the active document view or expects current_editor != nullptr when it isn't).\nThe real solution is to completely remove the current_editor global variable (maybe this is the older global variable in Aseprite, and the more postponed refactor that I've to do).\nAnyway, I'll merge this PR, just one thing: Could you change the commit message to something like \"Fix crash using NewBrush when Home tab is selected\"\n. I'll try to find other solution, because a lot of commands can be executed when the Home is selected and a document in other tab.\n. You can put 2015 and your name here :+1: the same for the webp_format.cpp file.\n. You can use the auto-generated widget here. The .h is generated in your_build_dir/src/app/generated_webp_options.h and you can use it in this way:\n```\ninclude \"generated_webp_options.h\"\n...\napp::gen::WebpOptions window;\n...\n```\nYou can find here an example.\n. You can use base_malloc() or a std::vector directly (the last one is preferred, you don't need to worry about base_free()).\n. I'm not sure about this array of pairs + a map. Is this just to show error messages? Could we have a function with a switch/case to convert WebPEncodingError codes to const char* strings (not even std::string)?\n. Is this function needed?\n. You can use base::convert_to<int>()\n. Sorry, it looks like a GitHub UI problem. I clicked the ToString() line. It looks like nobody is using it (anyway you can use convert_to<std::string>() if needed)\n. Rename to \"m_pointRemainder\" (similar to \"m_subPointShape\", we use \"m_\" prefix for member variables)\n. Great catch! :smile: \n. I didn't check this in runtime, but I think tag can be nullptr, so this line crashes if the command is used in animations without tags.\n. Why __FREEBSD__ instead of __FreeBSD__? Is it __FreeBSD__ or __FREEBSD__?\n. Is this required in OS X? why isn't this inside __FreeBSD__? Also this line needs a correct indentation.\n. I'd prefer this in a Linux Details section (like the Mac OS X details). Anyway we've to change build/bin/aseprite.exe to something like C:\\...\\aseprite-source\\build\\bin\\aseprite.exe\n. I think cmake-gui could be named too (the command line is cmake-gui .). Also some links to cmake-gui and ccmake docs could be included.\n. This line wasn't modified (more than indentation)\n. Also a std::string doesn't need to be initialized with an empty string (as it's already initialized empty).\n. Oh sorry, I was reviewing the \"Files changed\" tab (it's like a squashed version of all commits in the PR)\n. This is a circular dependency: app-lib depends on she, so she cannot depend on app-lib. In case we need the thumbnail generator in the she side, we should think about a interface that can provide she and must be implemented by the app to generate thumbnails.\n. Could you please try <cstdio> and <climits> instead of the C version of these header files (and group them below with <cstdlib> and <ctime>) to see if they work on FreeBSD?\n. This is the only change I think it's not needed (because net-lib already depends on ${CURL_LIBRARIES} in the next commit). I'll merge all the changes and revert this commit to see what happens. Please tell me if it's needed again for some specific scenario.\n. I just saw that this should be LIBJPEG_DIR instead of LIBJPEG_DIRS, I'll push a fix.\n. You can remove this line (looks like a copy & paste from FindDXGuid.cmake)\n. You can remove virtual and add override at the end in these two lines.\n. About this Gabriel, I'll re-license this to MIT in a near future in case this code is moved to laf library: https://github.com/aseprite/laf\n. I think we should add target_link_libraries(base-lib ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}) in the base/CMakeLists.txt instead of adding it here. (So any application linked with base-lib will be linked with threads libs.)\n. I'm not planning to add a section to build Skia, sorry\n. This paragraph should be after the sudo apt-get install libxcursor-dev\n. We could put here something like \"We use Ninja as the preferred build system, you can install it using:\".\n. I'm not sure about this section. It adds a lot of noise.\n. >  is linking to the installation instructions on the Skia website OK?\nYes, that's is what I think we should do. Linking to the official instructions. (In that way we don't need to keep them in sync)\n. Is this totalCollumns or totalColumns?\n. visible can be a std::vector, e.g.\nstd::vector<int> visible(layerCount, 0);\n. You can add a new Copyright (C) 2016 [your name] here.\n. What happen if PixlyAnimation element does not exist?\n. Same here, what happen if Info element does not exist? (Or the attributes in the following lines, layerCount, frameWidth, frameHeight?)\n. You should use base::convert_to<int>(...) to convert from std::string/const char* to int\n. Add (and ) in the right-side expression:\nvisible[(int)layer_index] += (std::string(visible_str) == \"true\");\n. There is no need to check needAlpha. Also, you can remove the pixelFormat() check if you remove the FILE_SUPPORT_GRAY, FILE_SUPPORT_GRAYA, and FILE_SUPPORT_INDEXED from onGetFlags() (and you should remove those constants from onGetFlags() as this format doesn't support Grayscale, Indexed)\n. Remove FILE_SUPPORT_PALETTE_WITH_ALPHA too as this format doesn't support indexed images with color palettes (with alpha or without alpha).\n. As a minor detail, you can #include <cstdio>, <cstdlib>, and <cmath> here.\n. I see that these throw can generate some leaks (mainly the png structures that are not freed). Anyway, don't worry, I'll integrate this with the png encoder/decoder later. I'll merge this code as it is.\n. Oh sorry, I've just saw the try{}catch block to avoid leaks.\n. Minor issue, we use this style: (0, 0, 0, 0)\n. Minor issue, we use this style for else:\nif (...) {\n}\nelse {\n}\n. Move all cache handling code into a new class (e.g. inside ThumbCache).\n. ThumbCache might be a separate class instead a typedef in other file outside the timeline. There is already a ThumbnailGenerator to generate thumbnails for file names, so this ThumbCache should be something different.\n. The cache might be inside the app::App object.\n. m_celPreviewThumbCache contains SharedPtr but they are deleted with delete, and a she::Surface should be deleted with its dispose member.\n. Replace all this logic to compare two images with count_diff_between_images (from doc/primitives.h). You can see an example about how to use in the fli format.\n. Avoid goto with bool flags and break if it's possible (I'm not sure if it would be necessary after using (count_diff_between_images).\n. Don't throw a string. It should be throw Exception(...)\n. No need to check this after a successful load_document with a png file (and lets hope it always behaves in the same way \ud83d\ude05 ).\n. This is a minor issue, you can remove these lines in case you create other commit for this file.\n. Could we replace these x, y, w, h with a gfx::Rect?\n. I think it would be nice to enclose this ? expressions with a ( and ). E.g.\ndouble zoom = (z0 > 1 ? 1 : z0);\n. This might be replaced with z0 = MIN(zw, zh);\n. You can remove these extra blank lines between { and }.\n. I think this \"quality\" parameter might be displayed as a combo-box as in the resize dialog (see this and this).\n. It might be text=\"Thumbnails:\"\n. You can remove the \"zED\" part from copyright (I'm not sure about the legal validity about that)\n. About this, I really like the idea about the thumb namespace :+1:\n. It would be nice if you can comment in the issue about your design decisions. At a quick glance, I don't understand why there is a full hierarchy of classes here (Tier, Data, Directory, Surface, Image, Document, Cache). Also try to use other class names, I know that thumb namespace avoid name collisions, but it make harder to read the code. (And example of something we're dealing with: doc::Document vs app::Document, something I've to refactor because it's a pain to deal with both classes.)\n. Could this Dimension type be replaced with a gfx::Size? Because it looks like it's acting as a gfx::Size\n. It looks like this class isn't necessary (there is no state), why don't we convert these generate/fetch into a couple of (non-member) functions?\n. It looks like generate() is used only inside thumbnails.cpp, so there is no real need to put this function in the .h. (It should be in an anonymous namespace inside thumbnails.cpp.) The same goes for Request class as generate() is the only function using that class.\n. We are using an implicit order of members, see that member variables are here, but member functions are before the variables.  (In other words, we are not mixing vars and functions in the private: section of the class.)\n. Remove this change.\n. It looks like UIContext doesn't need thumbnails.h\n. No need to remove the copyright notice (my comment about the thumbnails.h content was just illustrative \ud83d\ude04 )\n. Definitely I'd like this function to be called app::thumb::get_cel_thumbnail (easier to grep). In a future I'll move the file system thumbnails into the app::thumb namespace and we can have something like app::thumb::get_file_thumbnail.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hi @Mailaender, actually Aseprite is distributed under GPL-2.0, I'm thinking to change it to GPL-3.0 but at this moment it's 2.0.\n. We might include other screenshot for this store.\n. We could add a paragraph saying something like \"You can contribute to the official development buying a copy of Aseprite from its website.\"\n. Here we can add a // TODO move this to theme dimensions or include a patch moving this as a Timeline static member (Timeline::m_baseSize?) and initialize it with m_baseSize = skinTheme()->dimensions.timelineBaseSize() (adding this timeline_base_size element in skin.xml at the <dimensions>)\n. Maybe here we can add a filter\n```\nzoom = MID(1.0, zoom, 10.0);\nif (zoom == m_zoom)\n  return;\nm_zoom = zoom;\n...\n```\nBut I'm not 100% sure.\n. Wrap this with\nif (dz) {\n  double next_zoom = m_zoom + (dz < 0 ? -1 : 1);\n  setZoomAndUpdate(next_zoom);\n}\nOn OS X dz can be 0 (mouse wheel has an acceleration threshold, I think wheelDelta() point should be a gfx::Point<double> in a near future). Anyway without this if (dz) the zoom makes some jumps between -1 and 1.\n\nAlso I think the dz sign is inverted (it should be m_zoom + (dz < 0 ? 1: -1)), compare this behavior zooming with the mouse wheel on the sprite editor.\n. I think the kKeyEsc should call onCommitChange() too, because it acts like a shortcut to close the dialog, but not to cancel the changes in the dialog (e.g. we quickly change the layer name and press Esc doesn't mean that we want to discard the layer name change).\nI think esc should act exactly like kKeyEnter. So this could be just:\ncase kKeyEnter:\ncase kKeyEsc:\n   onCommitChange();\n   closeWindow(this)...\n. Same here.\n. I think here we should use the distance d (distance with the center of the wheel), and the angle a (which is already calculated below as double a = std::atan2(-v, u)) instead of x and y (as it's now it looks like a box instead of a wheel). Inside this condition we should be calculating the normal map color depending on d and a.. If the color model is NORMAL_MAP, we could just avoid adding none, complementary, monochromatic, etc. menu items inside menu variable.. It looks like this line is indented with a tab char, we use 2 spaces for indentation.. Minor style change:\nfor (auto layer : selLayers) {\n  if (layer && layer->isVisible()). Same style that above.. Actually now the command doesn't work for the single layer case. This is the case when `selLayers` is empty and `writer.layer()` is the current layer (this happens when we select a layer and then click the sprite editor, the selection outline in the timeline disappears).\n\nYou can use something like this here (and in onChecked):\nSelectedLayers selLayers;\nauto range = App::instance()->timeline()->range();\nif (range.enabled()) {\n  selLayers = range.selectedLayers();\n}\nelse {\n  selLayers.insert(writer.layer());\n}\n\n. No problem. I should add a function to get the real set of selected layers and avoid this kind of problems in the future and simplify code (also this little code is duplicated in several places, the writer.site() should have a function to solve this for us already).. Don't worry, you can now copy the lines, I'll see how to do it right (or if you want, you can then create then another PR for that refactor).. Does it work on Windows? (where the extension is .lib instead of .a). Also why we use libcmark and not libcmark_static?. Is this <INSTALL_DIR> in the parameters right? or in this way we avoid installing cmark files?. Just seeing the .a again, is a portable way to do this?. Instead of using pointers here you can use references (int rx, int ry, int& x, int& y). Same here: (int rx, int ry, int& x, int& y) and no need for the next line int &x = *px, &y = *py;. This should be layer_t newLayer =. This should be frame_t newFrame =. We can remove this blank line. Did something changed in these lines?(I think only whitespace was modified here). same here, this line didn't changed.. Align pref= with text=. Use statusbar->setStatusText(0, msg.c_str()); here.. I have removed the migrate attribute. The migrate attribute is used to transform old options used in get/set_config_string functions to the new pref.xml file format. As this is a new option, it doesn't need a migrate (the given Options.show_tooltip never existed).. There were some issues with End-Of-Lines characters (it looks like options.xml uses CRLF and this modified line was using only LF). I've fixed this in the final commit.. There is a second call of get_pixel() here. (put/get_pixel functions are slow, try to call them as few times as possible inside for loops).\nsuggestion\n          alpha = graya_geta(c);. We can use the fast versions of get_pixel() on each case (something the tga_format.cpp is not using \ud83d\ude22)\nsuggestion\n          c = get_pixel_fast<RgbTraits>(image, x, y);. suggestion\n          c = get_pixel_fast<IndexedTraits>(image, x, y);. See comment below, here we must keep the get_pixel value to avoid calling get_pixel two times. And we can use v to store the grayscale value:\nsuggestion\n          c = get_pixel_fast<GrayscaleTraits>(image, x, y);\n          auto v = graya_getv(c);. suggestion\n          fprintf(f, \"%02X%02X%02X\\\" \", v, v, v);. Remove this float opacity; definition, this variable is already defined above.\nsuggestion. Minor format change, missing whitespace: \nsuggestion\n    for (y=0; y<256; y++) {. The background color is not always black (#000000). You have to use the palette color.. You can \"cache\" the transparent color value into a constant local \"variable\", something like:\nconst color_t mask_color = fop->document()->sprite()->transparentColor();\n....\nfor (...)\n   ...\n   if (c != mask_color) { .... m_mode can be a app::gen::SymmetryMode. The default m_mode must be app::gen::SymmetryMode::NONE, which actually is (see the else case below). So you can remove this line and line 57.. No need for XOR here (just m_mode = ...).. The docPref.symmetry.mode must not be modified if m_mode is NONE.\nYou can also use something like docPref.symmetry.mode(docPref.symmetry.mode() ^ m_mode) to change the preference value (instead of setValue, see that Option::operator() is overloaded without arguments to get the value, and with an argument to set a value).. Inside this else we can do the XOR of the docPref symmetry mode depending on the m_mode value. (because when m_mode is NONE, we don't even need the docPref variable).. suggestion\n    int padW = horizontalPadding()->textInt();\nMinor change, the indentation needs a couple of white spaces.. suggestion\n    int padH = verticalPadding()->textInt();. I think this condition is always true, because when we are in the ImportSpriteSheetWindow, if m_editor != nullptr it means that we have changed the state of m_editor to SelectBoxState (from ImportSpriteSheetWindow::captureEditor()) with this PaddingRulers flag enabled. A possible nice change would be to have an assert:\nASSERT(int(boxState->getFlags()) & int(SelectBoxState::Flags::PaddingRulers));\nAnyway as the next line (boxState->setPaddingBounds()) already does this, we can just remove this line/if-condition.\nAnother note: About the code that was already there, I'm not sure why I put a check if (SelectBoxState* boxState = dynamic_cast<SelectBoxState*>(state.get())), it's like the state could be different to SelectBoxState in some special cases when m_editor != nullptr, but I don't remember why I put that check.. suggestion\n    gfx::Size padding(0, 0);\nAs we talked, we can use gfx::Size directly here.. Minor change: I don't like the style of these lines \ud83d\ude2cthey could be just:\nif (padXTips.back() + padding.w < sp.x2()) {\n                  if (y + padding.h > sp.y2())\n                    render->fillRect(dark, gfx::Rect(padXTips.back() + padding.w, y,\n                                                     sp.x2() - padXTips.back() - padding.w,\n                                                     sp.y2() - y));\n                  else\n                    render->fillRect(dark, gfx::Rect(padXTips.back() + padding.w, y,\n                                                     sp.x2() - padXTips.back() - padding.w,\n                                                     padding.h));\n                } \nSame for other cases below.. suggestion\n    virtual void onChangePadding(const gfx::Size& padding) { }\nJust gfx::Size with a #include \"gfx/fwd.h\" above.. suggestion\n    void setPaddingBounds(const gfx::Size& padding);. suggestion\n    gfx::Size getPaddingBounds() const;. I don't like 100% that this function receives the padding as an input/output parameter (because the padding argument will be modified). In the best case the padding should be const gfx::Size& and the < 0 check should be in ImportSpriteSheetWindow::getPaddingFromEntries().\nsuggestion\nvoid SelectBoxState::setPaddingBounds(const gfx::Size& padding). There is no need to change the text of the horizontalPadding field:\nsuggestion\nIt's better if we avoid modifying data when a get member functions is called.. suggestion. I think these padding.w < 0 checks should be in getPaddingBounds(), so you can move \nif (padding.w < 0)\n      padding.w = 0;\n    if (padding.h < 0)\n      padding.h = 0;\ninside getPaddingBounds() before calling gfx::Size(w, h) constructor with negative w and h values (side note: indeed, a gfx::Size() should be a gfx::SizeT<unsigned int>, to avoid using negative numbers, but that is a different history for other time).. Check if this new addition doesn't add a new problem saving indexed files that contain palette entries with alpha (because TGA files doesn't support palettes with alpha, a least, that is what I remember). For example, the warning must be shown if the file is indexed and contain entries with alpha.. This option can be called trim_by_grid (in the future might be a possible split_grid so we have to avoid confusion)\nsuggestion\n      <option id=\"trim_by_grid\" type=\"bool\" default=\"false\" />. This can be called:\nsuggestion\ntrim_by_grid = by Grid. This should be called:\nsuggestion\n  Param<bool> trimByGrid { this, false, \"trimByGrid\" };\nAlso I'm not sure if the trim parameter should be enabled automatically if trimByGrid is specified.. Several changes here are not required (like two consecutive <boxfiller />s, or the cell_align=\"left\" which does nothing because cell_* attributes are useful only when the direct parent XML element is a <grid>).\nYou can replace this with:\nxml\n    <vbox>\n      <check id=\"padding_enabled\" text=\"@.padding\" />\n      <check id=\"trim_enabled\" text=\"@.trim\" />\n      <hbox id=\"trim_container\">\n        <boxfiller />\n        <check id=\"grid_trim_enabled\" text=\"@.trim_by_grid\" />\n      </hbox>\n      <check id=\"extrude_enabled\" text=\"@.extrude\" />\n    </vbox>\nRemoving the <grid> (And using a <hbox> as the trim_container). Too long lines here, and we can use the origin() and point2() member functions from gfx::Rect as the starting/ending points:\nc++\n            gfx::Point posTopLeft =\n              snap_to_grid(docPref.grid.bounds(),\n                           frameBounds.origin(),\n                           PreferSnapTo::FloorGrid);\n            gfx::Point posBottomRight =\n              snap_to_grid(docPref.grid.bounds(),\n                           frameBounds.point2(),\n                           PreferSnapTo::CeilGrid);\n            frameBounds = gfx::Rect(posTopLeft, posBottomRight);. Not sure if this new PreferSnapTo::CeilGrid mode is required or when it's required. Do you have an image/test for this case? Any difference if we use this version in DocExporter::captureSamples()?\nc++\n            gfx::Point posBottomRight =\n              snap_to_grid(docPref.grid.bounds(),\n                           frameBounds.point2()\n                           + gfx::Point(docPref.grid.bounds().size()),\n                           PreferSnapTo::FloorGrid);. Nice example \ud83d\udc4d I'll try to merge the PR today. LFTM. Remove these two empty lines.. I think that instead of getting the direction we can the delta directly:\nc++\ngfx::Point delta = moveMaskCmd->getDelta(UIContext::instance());\nm_pixelsMovement->shift(delta.x, delta.y);. Can we just keep the old code to create the image copy?\nc++\n// To simplify the algorithm we use a copy of the original image, we\n// could avoid this copy swapping rows and columns.\nImageRef crop(crop_image(image, bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.w, bounds.h,\n                         image->maskColor()));\nAlso there is a memory leak here because the imageTmp is a raw pointer (Image*, which requires a manual delete which is missing). Use a smart pointer in these cases (ImageRef) like in the old code (I would use most of the old code as possible).. Memory leak. Use ImageRef imageToShift(...);. I'll suppose that this is right \ud83d\ude05 . Use an ImageRef preferably so no (ImageRef) cast is needed below (which for smart pointers like ImageRef, it's better if we use the ImageRef(...) syntax instead of the old C-like syntax (ImageRef)rawPointer). . Unused variable, initialCelPos can be removed.. Memory leak. Use ImageRef compImage(...);.. The union of two rectangles can be calculated with the gfx::Rect::operator|() (which is a shortcut for gfx::Rect::createUnion):\nc++\ngfx::Rect compCelBounds = cel->bounds() | mask->bounds();\nIn that way I think you can remove minX/Y and maxX/Y variables.. Simplify:\nsuggestion\n  gfx::Rect newBounds = compImage->bounds();\nSee that Image::bounds() (gfx::ImageSpec::bounds()) already creates a new rectangle with origin = gfx::Point(0,0).. Generally we would prefer all incrementVersion() calls to be inside app::cmd classes, but there are some exceptions. Just add a comment:\nsuggestion\n  finalImage->incrementVersion(); // TODO this should be in app::cmd module. As we talked in the email, I think here we can call m_exporter->setTrimCels(true); too.. Move this to the .cpp file because in the .h we require only a forward declaration of Cel (see comment below).. Add doc::Cel forward declaration:\nsuggestion\n  class Cel;\n  class Image;. Remove the //, gfx::Rect &finalBounds); comment:\nsuggestion\n    void shift_image_with_mask(Cel* cel, const Mask* mask, int dx, int dy);. We can remove the else case because maskCelGap.x is already initialized = 0.. Same here.. This can be simplified:\nc++\nimageToShift->copy(compImage.get(), gfx::Clip(0, 0, maskedBounds));\nBecause imageToShift->bounds().w == maskedBounds.w and imageToShift->bounds().h == maskedBounds.h. There are a couple of extra whitespaces in these lines (). Minor change, we can store paddingEnabled()->isSelected() in a variable and use it inside the function:\nsuggestion\n    const bool state = paddingEnabled()->isSelected();\n    horizontalPaddingLabel()->setVisible(state);. About this field you have two options:\n\nRemove it from this PR (because it's not used)\nOr complete this PR with the trim-by-grid support for --save-as. It would be better if this newBlend value is passed as an argument in this run() function, because this is executed in a background thread (not the UI main thread), and I'm not sure if the Preferences class is thread-safe.. Same here as in the cmd_change_pixel_format.cpp, this lambda is executed in a background thread, I'm not even sure that the code is already thread-safe, but anyway, just in case we can move the newBlend outside. You could replace it with something like:\nc++\nconst bool newBlend = Preferences::instance().experimental.newBlend();\n...\njob.startJobWithCallback(\n  [this, &job, flatten, newBlend] {\n    ...\n    job.tx()(new cmd::FlattenLayers(sprite, selLayers, newBlend));\n.... \n",
    "Cerno-b": "What I would really like to see is the option to export sprite sheets into most standard sprite sheet formats of different game dev libs. It would be a bit of effort to get all the variants to run smoothly, but you would be quite the boss for offering that functionality.\nThere is a tool that can do this, called TexturePacker. If you try the free version you can get an overview of the formats it supports. \nI was trying to use that tool to export to cocos2d-x's plist format, which has two different sprite sheet versions: One for a collection of frames and one for animation of these frames. Unfortunately TexturePacker only supports the first one, so there is literally no tool available on Windows platforms that is able to write cocos2d-x compatible animation.\nI'm about to roll my own converter from Aseprite's json format to cocos2d-x's animation format, but it would be really cool if you could offer different formats for the most popular libs. Again, please take a look at what TexturePacker has to offer to get an overview about how much effort that would introduce. \nMaybe you can implement some way for the community to write own converters with a scripting language of your choice. That way everyone can contribute with their own converter function and you would have much less effort maintaining the conversion if the format should change.\nI might be able to help out with the conversion to cocos2d-x since the format is quite straightforward (basically xml based key-value pairs).\n. I really like the idea of doing this via templates since it's a great way to handle for non-programmers. It might be neat to offer some place where people can put and rate their templates for different gaming libs. (e.g. wiki on the aseprite website or external online resource).\nConcerning cocos-2d-x, I read into the matter some more and apparently you need two plist files for your animation. One contains the frame images including sizes and meta information, the other is just a collection that groups frame images into an animation and ties them to a name and a frame rate.\nIt's actually less fancy than I initially thought, since apparently you can only set the frame rate globally, not per frame. Anyway, my point is that the template mechanism should allow outputting multiple files.\nJust as a starting point, the following information would have to be exposed to the template engine to create cocos2d-x animation files: \nframe file:\n- frame name (usually generated from sprite map name and a number)\n- position and size of each frame in the sprite map\n- image size of each frame (would be the same for all frames in your case)\n- pixel format (e.g. RGBA8888)\n- sprite map size\nanimation file:\n- animation delay\n- animation name (e.g. loop names). The file can contain multiple animations (i.e. each Aseprite loop can become a separate animation)\n- list of frame names (see above) that make up the animation\nThere are some more values that can be filled (e.g. rotation if you want to pack your sprite map tightly), but from my limited understanding they can be left as default.\nI'm just starting off with cocos-2d so take everything with a grain of salt. It's possible that people tend to write their animation.plist files by hand since the format is not very complex. It's also possible that they organize their images in multiple sprite maps but use one large animation.plist for the whole game.\nMaybe someone more proficient in cocos2d can comment on this.\n. What's your reason why the Ctrl key function will not be implemented? I would find this quite useful, since I often link cels that are not adjacent to each other and as far as I know the only way to do this is to move them next to each other, link them and move them to their appropriate position. Or am I missing something?\n. Thanks a lot, I haven't used the \"linked cells\" mode so I kind of missed that feature. This helps greatly, thanks!\nBy the way, coming from Photoshop, I love Aseprite for pixel work and animation!\n. Also when dragging multiple files into the tool it would be nice to have a dialog that asks whether to import as separate files, one multi-layer file or one multi-frame file (the last one could replace the pretty cool automatic recognition of consecutive numbers in file names that unfortunately does not work if there are gaps in the numbers)\n. I think what would help here is to hide the handles if the user presses SHIFT for adding to the selection. You already hide the handles when ALT is pressed for the color picker. \nI assume one rationale here might be that SHIFT is used to maintain aspect ratio for resizing et al., but it would still be possible to do that by pressing SHIFT after the handle is clicked and thus the resize is initiated.\n. Sorely missing this feature. I come from photoshop and use Aseprite for pixel art because it's so much better suited for the task, but man copying \"what you see\" is really handy if you keep character parts on separate layers and want to move some of them to a separate image to try out some things. \nIn Photoshop it's Ctrl-Shift-C which is not yet taken in Aseprite as far as I know.\n. Not on my PC right now, but is there some combination with S still free? Like CTRL+Shift+S? I think having all save options mapped to various combinations of S might be intuitive. \nThe important part is that the feature exists, the keymapping may be changed indiviually (although I advocate sensible default mappings of course)\n. Hm, that seems a little inconvenient. :/\nMaybe that function doesn't really need a default shortcut after all? \nDon't know how often people use it though.\n. I see. Then Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S would be too complex I guess. I'll think about this some more when I can look at the tool again, but as I said, it's probably not an issue I would lose any sleep over.\n. What you could do is to allow saving as a special image format that embeds the ase data in a png container which uses a flattened version of the first frame as image information. The file ending would be png, and it would could be opened in any image editor, or be displayed in a browser, but still retain the original ase information that allows to open the file in Aseprite with all layer information intact.\nThey used this technique in the game Spore in which players could create custom creatures. The game data of the creatures was embedded in a png file whose image part contained a picture of the monster. This allowed for convenient sharing of the players' creations. Really neat feature for a somewhat disappointing game.\n. Some more information on that:\nhttp://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/06/16/how-is-spore-hiding.html\n. Please allow saving a subset of frames as well. This is especially useful for people who keep all animation loops in a single file but want to save each loop's frames using different file names (char_walk, char_jump, etc).\nI thought it might be nice if you had an menu item \"Save frames as...\" The following dialog would be the standard \"save as...\" dialog with an additional dropbox where the user could either select the loop name they want to save, or a single frame, as oceanhahn requested. This would also allow saving an animation in reverse if the loop was defined as a reverse loop. \nIt would also be nice to give this dialog the option to save all loops according to their names, which would greatly simplify updating all exported loops, as you could save char_walk1, char_walk2, char_jump1, char_jump2, etc. with one click as long as you have the loops properly defined.\n. What do you mean exactly? I can copy paste from Photoshop without problems (Windows 7, Photoshop CS2). Care to elaborate what doesn't work for you?\n. It would be really helpful if there was a way to bind color changes to certain keys, e.g. increase hue by 3%, that would allow switching to different shades of my current color quickly. May be a bit too complex to implement and too fiddly to configure for many people.\n. Wow, you're fast! Looking forward to the next release then :)\n. I haven't been at my PC for a while, that's good news!\n. ",
    "dagostinelli": "I'd like to suggest that this be raised a bit higher in priority.   The current state of the texture atlas export is of limited use.  Let me explain.... \nImagine 3 sprites.  2 animated birds flapping their wings.  1 smiling face, not animated.\naseprite -b jay.ase robin.ase smile.ase --trim --sheet-pack --list-tags --list-layers --sheet atlas.png --data atlas.json\nThe result is as follows:\natlas.txt\nProblem 1: Designer must remember to uniquely tag the animations across all ase files (minor)\nAt first I named my animations \"flying\" in both .ase files.  I could also have \"idle\" and \"pecking\".  The sprite sheet packer gave me two animations both named \"flying\".  It was impossible to then figure out which frames to go grab with this.  So going back to the .ase files, I renamed the tags with a prefix and ended up with \"jay_flying\" and \"robin_flying\".  This at least gives me a prefix.  But that brings me to Problem 2.\n(also Layers are mixed together making them tough to match to their original sprite)\nSuggestion for Problem 1 How about creating a section called \"sprites\" with a list of \"Sprite\" objects?  Each Sprite object would contain a name, a list of frameTags (and layers and so on) that go with.  This would let us avoid prefixing the tags.  Perhaps the sprite name can come from the command line or the .ase file name.\nProblem 2: Ineffective ID numbers to lookup frames of the animation\nLooking at frameTags, I have \"jay_flying\" and \"robin_flying\".  The frame for the jay flying are frames 0 to 5.  Using this information is barely enough to uniquely identify the frames of the animation.  You have to know that the files are called \"robin\", so they match the frameTag prefixed with \"robin\".  But that's only because I solved Problem 1 like this.\nSuggestion for Problem 2 How about uniquely ID every frame in the file and then specify the list of unique frame IDs under the frameTag.  Like so:\n\"frameTags\": [\n   { \"name\": \"jay_flying\", \"frames\": [\"jay_001\", \"jay_002\", \"jay_003\"], \"direction\": \"forward\" },\n   ...\n  ]\nProblem 3 Locating the static sprite by name as an ugly name\nThis is more of a preference.  The non-animated sprites are ID'd using their literal file name.  In this case \"smile.ase\" is ID'd as \"smile.ase\" in the JSON.  I'd like it to be just \"smile\".  (Minor thing)\n. ",

This is already in. #315\n\n. I was a bit perplexed by this as well. If I just draw a selection, I can use that menu to manipulate it. But if I move it or paste it, those functions become disabled.\n. Other alternatives to consider:\n- An option in the new image dialog to auto-zoom upon creation\n- An option in the program settings that is off by default, so a user knows what's happening since they intentionally enabled this behavior\n. Oh my god, are you telling me I'll be able to make pixel art in bed and on the toilet? My life is complete.\n. I find myself running into this issue all the time. Right now my workaround is to change the image mode to RGB, fix my palette, then change back to indexed.

    "megaweezl": "I think, more than a tool this feature could be implemented using a drawing mode to be able to use it with the existing the pencil, box and circle tools.\nSince you have to pre-define a gradient or ramp beforehand anyways, you could automatically go into that mode when that gradient is selected.\nYou want the highlights or shadings to be taken from a predefined ramp to get the results you expect, so that would be a core requirement for this. A way to order the ramp manually would also be fairly important to get the expected results.\nIn our conversation you mentioned a bucket, which i assume is some sort of split area in the palette panel? This could work fairly well!\nHighlighting should work through the use of the left mouse button, while the right mouse would shade, moving the index within the ramp up or down accordingly.\n. Great work so far. Works as well as expected!\nLet me express few desires and suggestions in terms of workflow and usability:\nUsing Left/Rightclick to move the ramp up and down works well with a mouse, however it proves to be difficult when using a stylus. Having a button(hotkey e.g. x like the color left/right flip) to flip the order of the selected color ramp so you can remain using the stylus would be a great improvement.\nI found it weird that the shading tool works only on any of the colors in the ramp. \nIt would be cool to get a check box so it also works on any color/transparency, where it starts with either end of the ramp, depending on which direction you start from (left/right).\nThe selection of colors are always sorted in order of the color index instead of the color selection order, which makes it difficult to get the color progression you want. It would be appreciated if you could drag-drop/rearrange the colors in the selected ramp to get the progression how you like it.\nWhen working with different custom ramps in one image it can be quite the hassle to either sort the palette so the selection is lined up (if at all possible) or to reorder/rearrange the palette every time you want to change your ramp. For that it would be good to have drop down history on the ramp you can select previously created ramps (either saved per .ase or palette file)\nThanks for the great work. Really love the feature so far <3\n. > I was thinking that in Shading mode, X key could swap the whole gradient.\nExcellent!\n\nif I press left key above a color outside the gradient, do I paint with the right-most color in the gradient?\n\nYeah, I'd imagine it starts on the right most color and works its way up, and vice versa for the right click respectively.\nIn fact i personally find it confusing that left click works from right to left side in the gradient. even if left/right click coincides with the direction on the gradient, i'd imagine it more like left click works forward on the gradient. it feels more intuitive to me if the default action works left to right. it doesn't really matter with the x-swap though.\n. Oh great. Didnt spot that issue when i browsed the list, thanks.\nWill give the nonlinear history a try!\nIs a history panel planned, since you mentioned it?\n. Thanks man, i didnt even think of using the bucket fill, that is excellent and works even better in some circumstances where you have irregular shapes. cool!\nAs for usability, i could imagine having a recolor ink, similar to the shading ink, you pick colors for one gradient, but you also pick a second gradient, right/left click either swaps the colors from one gradient to the other or viceversa. you then have the freedom to use any brush you want, and use selections where necessary.\nOh this brings me to another point i was discussing with a friend.\nSuppose the colors you want to pick for a gradient are scrambled away in a huge palette, theres no decent or quick way to find them to add to a gradient. I reckon it would be much faster and smoother if you could ALT+SHIFT for selecting/toggling the colors in the palette view while picking them from the image. This is still index mode related, right? RIGHT? :)\n. ",
    "maanemann": "It's been over two years, github says, have you been working on this feature? It would take Aseprite to the next level! I really hope you have, or have it on the agenda. Please please please.... First comment: https://pixelation.org/index.php?topic=21183.0\nIMO Photoshop is a pain in the brain to animate in, it's unstable (when starting to animate), unhandy and lacks fundamental features, like moving more than one graphic at once (!) when using timeline instead of frame-based animation, which is necessary for tweening. So if Aseprite got a tweening feature, like adjusting parameters over several frames as described above, eg. position and rotation \u2013 the angels would sing.. I know it's an old thread, but I hope you get to add this feature one day, I miss the pressure sensitivity when drawing. There isn't any support for it now is there? I don't get any and can't find it anywhere, maybe AkashaRepo got it universally from a driver or so? Except for size/opacity, controlling the palette or one or more colour values with pressure would be really cool, it's an idea I've thought of before. You could use it for shade/highligt, as you said dacap, or colour temperature, saturation etc. or several combined!\nI gotta add that I'm very impressed with Aseprite, there's really put a lot of effort into all the details in both functionality and design. You've rethought a lot of the aspects of digital drawing, really cool!. This would be awesome, especially if it could be done to third party themes as well. I really like a bright theme like Unity's non-pro standard, but seems everybody else likes it dark, so this way I could get it just like wanted. Would be cool if individual colours and maybe font, sizes etc. could be edited on various panels and such, like in old Windows systems :D\n\n. ",

I opened this issue and I consider the planned continuous cels/new empty frame solutions for it. It can be marked closed if no other users are subscribed to this to voice their want of this exact implementation. No one else had starred the old one on google code.\n. For draw/paste on all frames, I realized an initial feature could be to just create a layer that has every frame linked to one new cel. (\"New Linked Layer.\") Then the user could draw on it (or paste on it or whatever) and merge down. That's essentially drawing on all frames, it's just that creating a linked layer manually can be hard if you have 100 frames. \n. Nsheppard01, you did not specify which version of the program you are using. (I assume 0.9.5?) If you locate your Aseprite settings file (~/.asepriterc on linux?) you should find a setting \"ScreenScale = 2\" which you can edit and save as \"ScreenScale = 1\" Reload the program and you will get 1:1 pixels.\n. I'll also put a vote toward RGB default color mode. The transparent index being displayed as transparent in the color bar is good as well. Both, not one or the other. :)\n. My favorite triangle color picker:\n\nSimilar setup with a square: \n\n(The diamond patterns are just artifacts from so many colors in the gif, of course.)\nI find hue circle color pickers like the above most intuitive, personally.\n. Thanks! Another related thing might be a relative entry button like the Palette Editor (F4) has. \nPalette of 16 colors. Click relative. Type 4. Get 20 colors.\nPalette of 16 colors. Click relative. Type -4. Get 12 colors.\n. One suggestion I might have is a checkbox to do it based on the image's resolution. (3 pixels would make the center draw one pixel, 4 pixels would make the center draw 2)\nAdmittedly things get weird once you move the symmetry line from the center... Maybe a radio box. one pix center, two pix center, resolution based.\n. This happens to me occasionally as well, but I've never come up with a repeatable way to make it happen.\n. About 2: To move a layer, click the layer, then click and drag the yellow border. Clicking and dragging on the layers window allows you to select multiple layers to move, so it's clicking and dragging the yellow border that actually moves them.\n. Can confirm it happens on Windows as well.\n. Probably related, but if not I'll create a new issue. You also can't lock creation of shapes to \"square\" by holding shift if the action was started without holding shift, nor stop them from being \"square\" by releaseing shift if they were started while holding shift.. Same with control (start from center). \nWhatever's held down when the selection (or shape drawing) starts is locked regardless of pressing or releasing the keys mid action.\n. I actually really like that idea for settings.\n. I'm aware of workarounds, this is one of the things I've known about but kept forgetting to report. I just think it's a problem when \"flip horizontal\" doesn't flip horizontally, moreso than masked pixels getting added. Edit: Hmm... It's very possible I misunderstood. Do you mean copying the image internally rather than the user copying? Because copying and pasting to flip is usually what I do end up doing.\nAdding to the selection also creates behavior like your edit (things that were underneath the mask become part of the selection), and I'm pretty okay with that. Generally due to this I do transformations away from other pixels, but I wanted to keep the gif filesize down.\nUnderstanding it's far away, but I would guess Issue #424 would allow a true horizontal flip of a rotated selection without also adding masked pixels to it? #579 would do it too, so I suppose it's a next milestone thing. \n. Block tile copy is an absolute must. (That is selecting multiple and pasting multiple tile indices. Pyxel Edit still lacks this, and it's my main problem with its workflow.) \nIt would be cool if this paired well with issue #974, or at least had a feature found in D-pixel. It allows you to work with tiles in a palettized way. Say you have a range size of say... 4 and draw a tile using indices 4, 5, 6 and 7. You place a duplicate of this tile to the right. You then draw on the left one using color 8. It remaps index 4 to 8, 5 to 9, 6 to 10 and 7 to 11, but only for the left tile. Meanwhile the stroke you made is still made on the identical right tile using color 4. So there's one tile in the tileset, but it can be displayed with two different palettes. Useful for retro stuff. A range equal to the current palette size would end up being \"normal\" painting behavior.\nYou can see a gif here, it's probably better than the text explanation: \n\nWhat D-Pixel lacks that Pyxel Edit has is seeing the stroke you're making across all tiles the stroke has touched. D-Pixel lets you see the stroke, but if you make say... one continuous stroke across two of the same tile, both tiles will look different until you release click and it applies both sets of pixels that overlapped each tile in the map to the actual tile. You can see this above when a line is drawn on the white background. Ideally all of those white tiles would update during the stroke itself so it's never possible for two of the same tile to look different.\nThis is also a must. The palette stuff would be cool, but is not a must to me. \n. You are understanding correctly. \n\nThis cannot be unbound from shift. \n. Yes, it's in save copy as.\n\n. Please make this a checkbox option on the onion skin options screen, as there are definitely times where I wouldn't prefer it. \nEdit: Probably something you'd have thought of, but I just realized this probably needs to conditionally change the click and drag UI for changing the frame range of the onion skin based on linked frames.\n. There is a HSB style option: \n\n. Good to hear! I was worried it was some weird thing with my PC setup. \n. ~~F\u0336o\u0336u\u0336n\u0336d\u0336 \u0336w\u0336h\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 \u0336s\u0336e\u0336e\u0336m\u0336s\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336b\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336 \u0336m\u0336o\u0336r\u0336e\u0336 \u0336c\u0336o\u0336n\u0336s\u0336i\u0336s\u0336t\u0336e\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336w\u0336a\u0336y\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336i\u0336s\u0336.\u0336~~\nEdit2: Or not. seems to only be consistent from the state it's in, not from boot. The only clue I've found is that sometimes a line from the selection preview (the pixels in the rectangle while you're making a selection, not the marching ants after you have finished) is drawn on a view of an image you're not making the selection on.\n\nCPU usage spikes seem to help make it happen.\nThree views. Two are the same indexed image, one is an RGB image. Choose the Marquee Tool. Create a selection by clicking one of the tabs representing the indexed image. Deselect. Now click and drag to start a selection in the other view representing the indexed image. (The click that starts the selection should be the same click that makes that view active or it doesn't happen.) The RGB view will graphically glitch.\n\nEdit: This was on Aseprite v1.2-beta7 Steam, Windows Vista 32 Bit. I had previously tried single word tags, which is what caused me to try the exact example. For completeness (both with and without quotes surrounding the tag): \n\nrun-cycle.gif and run-cycle2.gif are identical files that contain all the frames rather than just the ones with the tag specified.\n. 1 is issue #967 \n. Lasso tool is more precise, but the benefit to the box tool is speed. It's not just a tileset thing. I could draw a whole rectangle to get a rectangle with the lasso, or draw just a line to get a rectangle with the rectangle tool. I very rarely use lasso, even for organic things due to fewer arm/mouse movements. \nI certainly wouldn't mind having both, but don't want them to switch automatically based on say, a \"tile mode\" state because that's not intuitive. You can already double click to select a whole tile (based on grid size), so you may prefer to have lasso mode all the time, and double click when you want a full tile.\n. You can do this using the convolution matrix's outlining with a few caveats. Mainly only RGB mode. (It's finicky in indexed) It uses black, not the current color and is put a pixel outside not inset. Still, check it out. \n\nEdit: To do just one frame, you can use the magic wand, and a global fill.\n \nThe only caveat here is that you can only do one frame. It's inset, etc.\nBeyond these workarounds, I think an autooutline quick tool might fit well into the fill tool (click the solid color, and it uses the color on each pixel where the fill \"ends\"). That of course would not apply across all frames. \n. A layer can be a background or a layer. \"Layer\" layers can be transparent, \"Background\" layers can't. Right click the background layer and select \"Layer from Background\". The reason for the layer types is it allows either 256 colors or 255 and transparency. The layer type also effects the behavior of the eraser tool. (Since transparency is not allowed on a \"background\" layer)\nSprite, Properties will let you set the palette entry used for transparent in an indexed image.\nSprite, Canvas Size will expand the canvas with transparency around a \"layer\" layer. \nThe fill tool with simple ink should allow you to fill with transparent color on a \"layer\" layer,\n. Ah. Indeed I was on 16bit color, sorry. I use it less than before these days, so  I thought it was still 32bit.\n. Thanks! It is not lost on me how much of an edge case this is, so I really appreciate you taking the time to fix it when it won't affect many others.\n. It could also be tolerance: \n\n. I understand the simple ink, but I also get this behavior with Alpha Compositing which I believe does not make alpha 0 behave as the eraser. #945 may cover that, but I'm mentioning this just in case. \nEdit: Mmm... there's three alphas, though. The Opacity Value, the Alpha Value of the brush's pixels, and the Alpha value of the foreground color. I suppose the thing is that brush never blends with itself, so why the magic wand tool thing works is that it takes those pixels out of the equation. A transparent pixel meanwhile is still \"drawn\" so it will overwrite the current stroke because the current stroke cannot blend with the current stroke. Is this correct? I guess ideally I'd like transparent pixels to be treated as not there in Alpha Compositing like pixels that were eliminated from the selection that created the brush. Simple ink could still \"bring them back\" so to speak. I now have to think about if that was was caused the Legacydev_ bug. I should look at the code, it's all pretty interesting. Sorry for mini brain dump.\n. I had read that page, which is where I got Simple Ink \"bringing back pixels\" to use as the eraser. \nBasically when I read, what I got from it was that a fully transparent pixel (that was still part of the selection) would act as the eraser. What I think I've learned from this discussion is that pixels of the brush (whether they have alpha values, or whether they are part of the mask bitmap, or anything else that can be different) would not make a difference between simple ink and alpha compositing. \nThe difference between the two is solely that when the alpha value of the selected color itself i.e. here: \n\nis zero, simple ink will erase, and alpha compositing won't. I even realize that the documentation does specifically state foreground color, so I'm not even sure how to change it in a concise way where I'd have understood correctly. But I get it now. (Unless the above explanation is wrong >_>)\n. I've just seen a request for this:\n\nThe blended result of all layers for that frame, rather than cels. It could save visual space too, since it's one image regardless of layers. . I subscribed because I read it as\nOpen this:\n\nExport this:\n\nI've printscreened the grid numerous times for restriction demonstration purposes unrelated to want of tilemap features.\n. https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/docs/ase-file-specs.md\nIt's also included with some distrubutions in docs/files/ase.txt. . Probably because the fill bucket is destructive and that preview is non destructive. i.e. using that preview won't eliminate your redo buffer, but using the fill bucket will.\nIt's doing it line by line in the preview so as not to use a lot of memory while not actually changing the image itself. If you hit OK (or pressed enter), the preview generation would be interrupted and the change would be instant (or at least not very slow) just like the fill tool because OK commits to an actual change rather than a preview of one. \nShorter: You'd basically need two copies of the image in memory to non destructively preview at the same speed. Or I guess a second undo stack which could be applied on cancel.... No networked folders, no explorer extensions. Edit: On second thought, dropbox probably qualifies as an explorer extension.\nAnd further edit: Closing it stops \"synced\" overlays from being drawn. Aseprite behaves the same, in that case. I'd rather not fully uninstall dropbox. The \"Licecap\" folder from the video isn't synced or special in any other way I can think of. Another computer (Windows 10, 64 bit) also with dropbox active does not seem to have the problem. If I think of something else along these lines, I shall update. . Maybe only slightly related, but it'd be cool to keep at least one axis if off screen (if possible) as well. Here's a case where that would have been nice:\n. Yes, I know. If you frequently sort palettes, the extra blacks would get sent to the beginning in a lot of cases. (And yes, there's a workaround for that too, by just moving them after the sort, or selecting them beforehand but the whole goal is to be doing things without extra steps as a workaround.)\nExpanding to fill spare indices is just to describe behavior when one does that, the common case would be just doing the next free color. . A workaround: If you click and drag it slightly, it won't close until you click the button.\n\n. Yeah, dragging tag edges actually sounds excellent.. If I'm understanding correctly, you just want to quickly add sampled colors to a palette? You can definitely do it WAY faster than you described right now. Your suggestions would make it faster, but for now:\nAssign a hotkey to \"Add Foreground Color to Palette\". Also assign hotkeys to \"Go to Next Tab\" and \"Go to Previous Tab\". Sample from one image, go back to the other, press the key. \n\nAssuming you don't have two images, it's even faster. Color sample, press the hotkey.\n\nEdit: Even faster (almost exactly what you describe if I'm understanding correctly), but requires a specific hotkey setup. Color Picker is alt by default. I made the hotkey for add foreground color to palette alt+K. Hold down alt+K and click for magic.\n\nYou can even click and drag. (But if you're using a tablet doing the above is likely to cause many unwanted colors to be added.)\n. You can move multiple cels at the same time by selecting them in the timeline and clicking and dragging on the canvas with the move tool.\n (This cannot be done with cels in the background layer)\nBeyond that, there's another issue: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1172. Is File, Export Sprite Sheet what you want?. As a temporary workaround:  Sprite->Canvas Size set to some arbitrarily large value (that you know is larger than all the frames), then use Sprite->Trim. This works because Aseprite still loads the \"offcanvas\" parts of the images if you load in a sequence.. How's control click sound? If there's an active color selection, control click the timeline. If there's an active timeline selection, control click the palette.\nControl+Click is already how you select non contiguous frames, and it does have history as adding something to an existing selection without getting rid of it. (As in Windows explorer). If you have 16x16 tiles, you can make an image that's some amount of tiles long/tall more easily. 16*200 for width 16*40 for height. . This is the quick support that makes Aseprite great! Yeah, I wasn't married to the idea of any particular hotkey or even needing a default one, but shift+enter is a fabulous choice.. The top left pixel is used as the color to trim away. Any color that's not that color is not trimmed. So all transparent pixels to the right and below your white pixel keep the image from being trimmed. \nIf you made the top row and left column entirely white, they would would get trimmed because there are no longer pixels that aren't the top left color preventing that row and that column from being removed. \nTo see how this ends up working out, try trimming this image multiple times:\n\nIt keeps getting smaller because the top left pixel (the color to be trimmed) keeps changing. .

Okay, finally got it to build, but you amassed quite a lot of regressions since 0.8 in the build system. https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/310818 Maybe continuous integration with @travis-ci might help.\n.

That sounds like a sane design decision. I am more like dreaming at the moment and probably also lacking skill a bit, but there is lot's of pre-existing code https://code.google.com/p/xcc/ and the file formats have been fully reverse engineered already.\n.

Ha ha o man, this takes me waaaaay back! :y \nIt has been a long ride, my man. \ud83d\ude06 . I think Flash and Illustrator have (had?) really good n-gon and star-shape tools. You could double-click on the tool icon to specify the number of sides/points, then draw as usual. (I think star shapes were drawn radially, dragging to the desired radius and moving the mouse to set rotation.)\n. Oh, I found what's happening.\nThe flood fill tool seems to be filling all of the valid pixels it can see from the unselected layer, then only filling the pixels within the selection. When the flood fill tool determines which pixels to change, it looks at everything it can \"see\" not including the selection boundaries.\nThis is different from what I would expect (and it may just be me), which is that it would evaluate only the 'flood-able' pixels within the selection-- that is, the edges of a selected area, as well as any pixels within it, act as barriers to flood-fill.\nAttached are two screencaptures of flood-fill in action: the lefthand one shows a flood within a selection within a closed shape (behaving as expected): the fill only floods the interior space of the closed shape. The righthand figure shows a flood within a selection, within an open shape. When the flood evaluates which pixels to fill, it looks at the  whole image and not just the pixels in the marquee. When it actually fills pixels, though, it only changes the ones in the selection. I would have expected it to stop flooding at the edge of the selection, rather than to compute every pixel and only alter the selected ones. :kissing: \nAnyway, I don't know how hard that would be to fix, or if that's even what's going on. I hope this helps! :D \n(For reference, I have multiple layers, but the fill and enclosure are both on the same one.)\n(continues below image...)\n\nThe outcome I want is for fill to flood the middle section of the figure, as on the left, even if the whole figure is open beyond the selection area. (Of course, if there is a gap inside the selected area, flood-fill ought to still flood through it, filling all \"visible\" pixels -inside- the selection!)\n. In short, it looks like it's flooding the unselected image, then applying just the selected portion to the view. \nI would have expected it to flood the selection only, ignoring all pixels beyond the selected space, in this operation.\nIt also looks like an old issue, since my legacy install of 0.9.5 does exactly the same thing! :0\nI've revised the issue title to reflect this.\n. I use Save Copy As for a bunch of different things, but I don't usually use the hotkey to get there. For copy-saves I used often, I generally use Export instead.\nI'm glad this has gained traction, though! :D Looking forward to it!\n. Out of curiousity, are these checklists a selection of some of the bugs, features, and tools selected for the next release, or is it meant to be exhaustive of all of the issues we can expect to see cleared for v1.1? :)\n(I ask because I'm curious about the fate of my Issue #823.. ;) )\n. That's what I'm after, too. ;). Bumping for mirrored selection movement. :D . Hey again, just wondering if there was any view of this bug getting sorted out on the horizon. ^^;\n. Thanks for taking care of this for me! :D\n. Just want to give this thought a bump! :D\n. Aw. Well! Still looking forward to this! :D. Well worth the wait! Thanks! \ud83c\udf89 . The basic purpose I'd thought for collapsing the tag/loop area is so that, if the total height of the tags became too deep (that is, it imposed too greatly upon the graphic editor space), the user could press a button to roll them up (and, later, press it again to restore them). Basically, it just hustles them out of the way when they aren't needed and brings them back with a single click, in much the same way that [Tab] hides and reveals the entire pane.\nI'm not super-sure how useful it might be considering that, to be meaningfully cumbersome, there would probably have be be at least three stacked sets of layers (fewer, I suppose, if ASEprite is running in a smallish window or on a small or low-res screen), but it might be nice to be able to switch between a full profile of loop labels and a compressed one during viewing.\nI do agree that the tags are important; my reasoning is just that the more simple and uncomplicated options a user has for viewing their data, the more robust the UI environment becomes. :D\nIn any case, the \"Collapse\" button doesn't hide the loop labels and leave them hidden; there'd be a corresponding \"Reveal\" button that expands the pane back to the larger size.\nI look forward to hearing more about what you think!\n. Mm. That was my issue to begin with (or rather, what prompted me to create this particular issue thread), actually. I had noted the pulldown menu, but the shadow is a really good addition. :D\nIt would be nice to have the context menu version when the labels area is collapsed but still be able to expand it to see everything at once, but that could represent a lot of extra work for something that may not come up that often...\n. @dacap I really like that idea, too. :D\n. I'm with @SolarLune on having the other tags' range brackets visible, but shaded.\n. @dacap Really liking what I'm seeing so far! :D \nAs a suggestion, though, maybe it would be worth considering colouring the tag brackets, too? It would make the beginnings of one tag and the ends of others a bit easier to distinguish, from oneanother, I think.\nI tried doing something like that in my mockup at the top of this issue but I'm not sure how hard that would be to actually create software for... @dacap Out of curiosity, how are you thinking of going about recolouring the lines? Palette swap?. @dacap Very cool; I'm absolutely looking forward to seeing this in action! Thanks for sharing the specifics, too! :D. I still think the popup-tags idea is a good one too, perhaps when the tags are in a collapsed state. I'm not sure how it would work for tags that overlap but have offset starting and ending frames, but I'm still excited to see how it'll all come together.\nThanks for investing so much effort in this! :D. Oh man, is it going to be in 1.1.14? :grinning: . Aa, I see, so the next updates in the stable branch won't be until v1.2?. Cool-- really looking forward to it! :D. Great, thanks! Sorry to repeat it if this was already open somewhere else. :D\n. Woah, that'd be three years ahead of schedule! ;). It comes up fairly often for me because I'm in a bit of a habit of creating multiple objects (decor props, for instance) in a single workspace, then dividing them into separate files once I have them all looking the way I like them. Usually, the palette I'm using on the home image includes more colours than are in use in any single object divided from it, so I prefer to quantize the 'child' files individually. \n(Trimming is just an easier way for me to get the object's exact size than fiddling the object's selection area at the source. This does not represent as much of a time sink as the quantization and colour mode setting does.)\nA completely different alternative to this could be creating something like Photoshop's macro recorder, that allows us to record a set of actions then replay them by rote to different documents on-the-spot. It might be a bit harder to make work and would be a bit (a lot) finnickier, but it would certainly eliminate the need for a lot of these fixed \"Repeat\"-style functions.\nI really like the idea of your Slice tool, though! When the slices are committed to new files, would there be a way to set options for the output files (colour mode, naming nomenclature, etc.), or would they all simply inherit the parameters from the source? It would be nice if we could create a persistent \"Slice Layer\" that remembers our selections for reuse, if you do that route, but I can't picture how it would work interface-wise in my head. I imagine you'd know about that stuff better than I would, though! :D\n. My preference in these things is usually to have as many options available as possible in panes and prompts (without them becoming cluttered) that may be set and configured once, then recalled with a single menu call when they're needed again, but I also appreciate that this may not be a common desire and that there is merit in keeping those panes fairly simple...\n. I think you can comment on issues even after they've been closed. \nWhat was the number of the previous issue? I'd like to read it.\n. Hm. It is literally the previous issue.\nWell, I'm embarrassed! :y \nThanks.\n. This is not intended as an end solution to your problem, but here's (maybe) a slight improvement to your shading-rect workaround: select the region you want to reindex (by whatever means) and use the Flood Fill tool in discontinuous mode, with tolerance set to 255. Click as exactly as many times as needed, which should be the same as the number of colours you're cycling out. (Extra clicks will cause pixels with index n-1 to run together with pixels with index n! Which you can then undo...).\nMaybe you've already tried this method since all I did to come up with it was combine two techniques you'd already mentioned; I wasn't sure if you'd experimented with tolerance as well. It's a bit more flexible than using Draw: Rectangle since the selection tools are a lot more robust (Magic Wand in particular, especially in combination with Stop at Grid!) and you do not need to re-select the rectangle area for every index increment you wish to make. It is also a little harder to hit pixels you want left alone.\n\n(The quality of the gif is sort of crap, and for this I apologize. It's my first time using LICEcap, so...)\nI agree that it would be nice to have somewhat finer control for selective palette replacements over ranges of pixels (rather than whole-documents), but I'm at a bit of a loss for how to construct an interface for it. Do you have any thoughts on what it might look like?\n. I would love to see this, too!\n. When you say \"scrub,\" you're talking about scrolling through the hue degrees, right?\n. Any progress on this low-impact bug? :D \n. If it was me, I'd probably cycle through the sliders, then through the fields, rather than through colour channels. My reasoning being that when I tab through text fields, I usually expect to be able to enter a value, then enter the next immediately afterwards. Whether I'm using a slider or a text input, once I settle on a value, I usually move directly on to the next channel, rather than having to tab twice to get to the next data element. I would not consider this extra keystroke to be a nuisance mind you, but perhaps trivially less expectable.\nIt might be useful to let the sliders have focus since using arrow keys to make single-increment adjustments could  be useful to people sometimes. But since you're asking me, I'd cycle the fields through whatever channels you're using, then the sliders through those channels.\nThanks for the fix! :D\n. I was wondering about which arrow keys would change values. up/down makes sense in terms of numbers, but left/right kind of seems more intuitive for the sliders themselves. If you want to get really sneaky, you could set it up so that up/down increments values when the fields have focus (since left/right ought to move the cursor) and left/right (or left-down/right-up) increment/decrement values when the sliders have focus.\nI kind of like the idea of the sliders being able to have focus, and receiving it when you click them, but that's just me, and I'm sure there are a hell of other things you'd rather do than set up that kind of thing. XD\n. It would be nice if the palette editor and colour selectors were maybe the same tool but I also use 8P images almost exclusively, so it's a bigger deal to me since making temporary/single-use colour choices is a non-issue. 24b images are a different situation for that kind of thing. :y \nI look forward to reading about it once you get it sorted out! :D\n. This almost already exists with Edit / New Sprite from Selection ([Ctrl] + [Alt] + N).\nIt's not the same because it only copies from whatever is selected (if anything) in your current viewport, rather than from the clipboard, so it won't replace what you want. But it's close, maybe?\nHope it helps you, at least for now!\n. Perhaps we can roll all of those together and add a check box to the New Sprite pane that gives the option to create New from Clipboard, which locks the width/height fields to the clipboard contents and pastes the clipboard contents automatically upon creation. This way, colour mode and background fill options could also be applied to the new image as well, possibly.\nA hotkey could be created that calls New Sprite with that option checked and invokes it automatically, maybe.\nIt might be nice to roll in some of the things I mentioned in #996 as well, possibly?\nI feel like the New Sprite pane could be expanded to include a lot of really useful options without becoming cluttered and present them in a place where they are accessible with only one or two clicks, as well as being in a place where they'll be noticed and used without getting underfoot.\nMaybe a submenu could be added as File > New from.. > Selection..., Selection Again, Clipboard..., Clipboard Again, Layer, (etc.), in which New Sprite is called preset with whatever the relevant image sizes and modes are and pastes the appropriate source data into the new image on creation, or reuses the previous settings (with the current data source) if an \"Again\" function is called.\nFood for thought!\n. I do like the idea of a Clipboard tab, though! If you go that route, could the tab also be detachable/floating in the same way the Preview pane is?\n. @dacap Aa, I see. That makes sense, although I worry slightly that it could get crowded in the tab bar if we keep a lot of projects open at once or keep Aseprite open in a smaller window, rather than fullscreen. Still, I like it!\nWould there be an Edit menu option as well and that icon would be a shortcut to it, or were you thinking that the tab-bar icon would be the only means to paste directly to a new file?\n. Woah, why was this closed? o.o\nDid it get put into a beta branch or something?. I guess so. :1 \nI would still like to see diagonal/angular symmetry. Should I open a new issue, or just leave it be?. Cool, thanks!\nI thought I had seen another post about angular symmetry, but it would be great to see at least \u00b145\u00b0 mirroring, if a rotatable plane is too much to consider. :D . You know, I can appreciate how these shitstorms get going? Developers start these projects as labours of love, and throw some boilerplate license on it. Keeners add their bit, it gets rolled together, and turns into something more than it might have been otherwise. But that's the sort of development base it has: keeners. It's a rare thing that a developer also enjoys disassembling the fine, exploitive nuance of copyright law at all, let alone at the outset of a personal-project-cum-open-source-product. And because the thing called \"intellectual property\" is such a racid topic among enthusiasts, even the slightest whisper of it can trigger an overblown, paranoid reaction.\nUsers feel as though something of theirs is being stolen from them-- if they've also contributed to the project, they may feel this way with good reason. The nature of Open Source projects can create a sense of security that only sometimes really exists. Some others may resent the very thought of an open source franchise moving away from the movement, even slightly, without having even the slightest investment in that product to begin with. The vast majority of users never notice-- when was the last time anyone actually read their software licensing agreement? To the end? (If you raised your hand, I admit that I am impressed.) They have a right to be paranoid since property theft is a crime perpetrated by gigantic multinationals and super-smalltimers alike. But their reactions can be quite extreme in less-graceful instances (n.b.: Nobody in this case, that I've seen, has been so awful, just for the record).\nDevelopers, especially hobbyist developers, on the other hand, usually (not always!) just want to try to keep the scope of a growing project under control and to maybe try and capitalize on their efforts a little better, and in these cases, it comes down the attitude of the project administrators. In this case, I trust @dacap to not go full-Ebaum's on this one (ha ha how is that for a dated reference? :v ), but I can completely appreciate how others would not be so generous. \nI've also paid my few dollars. All I really do here is report issues, make suggestions, and try to improve the docs. I don't have as much skin in the game. :I\nIn any case, if you ask me (and nobody did), the only real misstep here was not mentioning that the license would be changing some time in advance. License management for any open-source project is not some tepid swimming pool to dip your toe into, it is a howling acid waterfall that drops you off a cliff and sucks you under. The more you prepare for it, the less chaotic and unpredictable it becomes. Somewhat.\nIt's better to sort out sooner and with as much collaboration as possible, and there are things we cannot imagine anyone caring about that can unexpectedly-- unexpectably-- turn into huge stumbling blocks. \"The best time to plant a tree is twenty five years ago. The second best time is now.\"\nAnyhoo, it's nice to see a project grow from humble beginnings, and it's not like the Open Source splinters will vanish. I hope both the EULA and GPL versions both thrive and grow; it's not like there isn't room enough for them both.\nWe're all on the same side here.\n. Woah ha ha o wow that was way more lecturing than I had intended it to be. x_x\ntl;dr: It seems to me more reasonable to think of the open-source version losing @dacap as a contributor than to think of the entire ASEprite project vanishing from the realm of open-source'dness.\nThe license change probably should have been given with a bit of notice, though. Hindsight.\nLooking forward to more updates.\n. @zed9h I feel like the electric company analogy was a response to the rather melodramatic rights-trampled-upon remark by @davexunit. Probably you know that, though?\n. @zed9h We're agreed, then! :smiley: \n. @cookiengineer Makes sense to me, but it's not my project we're talking about here. ;) \nWhat does @dacap think?\n. The workaround I use for that at the moment is either to Copy Merged to a new file and save or export that, or use New Sprite From Selection and save that (which transfers colour data like palette and mode state but neglects layers other than current). If you need to save through frames, cropping I guess is the only way to go, and yes, it is a bummer. :1 \nBeing able to save a selection directly to a new file would be nice, especially if it could save through layers and frames! :D . I accidentally reposted this issue, but I'm wondering if anyone in this discussion has mentioned how transparent custom brush pixels seem to behave differently in indexed mode compared with RGB mode?\nMaybe it's relevant; maybe not.\n\n. Regarding \"keyboard+mouse wheel combinations\":\nI would love to have the option (Preferences/Timeline) of swapping the MouseWheel (verticaly scroll/Layers) and SHIFT-MouseWheel (horizontal scroll/Frames) behaviour on MW over the Timeline. I tend to fiddle Frames more often than Layers, and being able to scroll more casually (which is, without SHIFT) would be nice.. Man, how did I miss that?\nSorry for the duplicate. x_x\n. I would love to see something like this, too. :D\n. I was about to make a post suggesting a tool that would allow users to place text notes anywhere on the workspace, in the style of post-it notes. I think Photoshop already has the feature but I cannot remember exactly.\nAnyway, I was reminded of this and I thought I would give it a bump. :D. Good to know! I'm gonna hold out for an expanded menu option, though. ;)\n. Cool, thanks! If you find the time in the future to consider the other options, that would be great, but the UI enumeration really is the important thing. :D. Looks good, but it doesn't play nice with Tag Properties just yet~ :0. Related to Issue 920.\n. I'd actually like to see something like this as a way to link duplicate cels (frame-layer elements) on the timeline, if they're independent of each other. That way, duplicate frames (frames with complete sets of duplicate cels) would be optimized, but individual layers could still be modified my making specific cels unique later.\nIt would also make cel copying a bit more powerful, potentially. ASEprite already has cel instantiation between nonadjacent frames (!) so being able to have the software automatically find and link duplicate frames could be a really useful compliment to it.\nLinked cels is not the same thing as linked frames, but I think it might be a more useful option.\nI don't want to change this suggestion, though; it's just something it made me think of. ^^\n. I'd interpreted \"duplicate frames\" as any pair of frames with perfectly identical pixel data between them when their layers are merged, but I may be misunderstanding you. ^^;. That actually sounds really amazing. :D\n. Cool, thanks!. I'm really interested to see how this would look in action, too, given that each frame can have a unique duration. Do I see that represented in your sample on frames 2 (prolonged) and 4 (shortened), @dacap? :D \n@kyrieru - I think you can get something similar to that now by manipulating frame durations. Have your character attack on one layer and link up all of the frames for each of the three parts over ten frames. At the end of each part, duplicate the frame and alter the frame duration in the first half (it's in Frame Properties in the frame context menu on the timeline, if you've never used it) to end when you want it to, then modify the duration of the next half frame to make up the difference. \nIt's cumbersome and choppy and kind of unpleasant to work with, and you can't tell at a glance how long a frame is (like you can in @dacap's version), but if you need a solution right now, you could try that.\nI'm definitely looking forward to the time-based implementation, though! :D . @dacap I can see how that would become particularly messy during export, too. :s \nI imagine that's a huge problem when more than two active layers are involved.. I suppose it's possible to do a png-sequence by including frame durations in their filenames (\"swordswing0_10.48x63.140ms.png\", for instance)..? (Assuming that the timeline architecture is still based on frame-durations..) It obviously won't produce a proper animation and it's not super-de-duper elegant, but it would at least be easier for other software to interpret, potentially.\nFrame-sequence filename nomenclature options would have to be expanded fairly substantially, I think, if you wanted to do this, I guess?\nProbably if you're playing with that sort of timeline, though, you're interested in a gif, yeah. :y. I actually just noticed now that this may already be in v1.2-b2, so possibly nevermind?? ^^;. I poked around a little and my guess is that this new attribute docPref.timeline.firstFrame() should probably be applied to the from and to values in this line? \nHope that helps (and maybe it doesn't)!. Thanks! :tada: . I could really get behind something like this, too. Continuously having to reset the pivot is a bit frustrating.. Ah, no I haven't. I'm using the Gumroad version, so I don't have quick access to the beta branch.\nThe screencap you linked looks like what I'm after, though!\nThanks!. I think I actually have a Steam key already loaded for it, I just use the freestanding version because Steam and Windows don't play nice. ;). Incidentally, when Wrap Through Frames mode is on but I'm not in a tag, it might be nice if onionskin frames cycled through from the first and last frames on the timeline, as well! :D. Incidentally, I think this bug may have an even more peculiar problem where it approximates colours near (0,0,0) to the transparency colour key, which is usually set to (0,0,0,0). I have not confirmed this, but I have had files mysteriously 'lose' very dark shades to blank (transparent) pixels in the past, and I think that this is the cause.... Aa, sorry, that's good advice. I'm used to people wanting as much as I can explain and this is the result. :sweat: \nI tried searching the Issues stack, too, but I guess my phrases weren't very good. :hankey: \nThe short of it is that RGB to Indexed conversion is approximating colours that are already in the destination palette.\nI shall try harder to be curt next time! :sweat_smile: . Has this been resolved yet? I could really do with a workaround. ^^;. Has there been any headway on this one? ^^;;. That would be fantastic, thank you! :D. Argh, crap! I searched for other \"spray can jitter\" issues and Git came back with nothing, then right after I post this issue, I find this older one in my own issues list.\nSorry! That's really embarrassing; I'm not sure how this could have happened. :hankey: . I will copy my note from #1667 to here just so that you might be able to find it:\nThis is a weird problem that occurs when all of the following conditions are true:\n\nThe current file is in the Indexed colour mode.\nThe Mask colour is set to Index 0 in Sprite properties.\nIndex 0 has its alpha value set to exactly zero.\n\nIf Index 0's alpha level is anything other than zero, or the Mask is set to an index value other than 0, or the graphic is not in indexed mode, the bug does not occur, even if the current mask index (which is not zero) does have an alpha of exactly zero (ha ha what??).\nIt took a lot of fiddling to discover why, too, I will have you know! XD\nIt is possible that there are other elements I did not discover.. That sounds like a good idea for a selection reticule over the cursor, but for the three inactive corners of a rectangle? It sounds like kind of a mess, especially in tiled mode. :s Maybe as a third Cursor/Crosshair Type preference? \nIt might be nice to have the option of a selection cursor that extends all the way to the edges of the work area, though, especially in Lasso Selection mode.. Aa, an option would be great, I agree. :D. Also, perhaps the background checkerboard size could have customizable sizes instead of just squares in the first five powers of two? Having the checkerboard fall out of phase with the grid is super-de-duper hard on the eyes. :s \n\n\ud83d\udd3c For instance, this 16x16px. checkerboard under a 64x36px. grid and yikes. =_=;\n. Aa. That's a little harder to reach but I can just fiddle my hotkeys.\nThanks for letting me know! :D . Any chance this might become a possibility for 1.3? :3 . I guess this is as good a time as any to ask if bumping issues is kosher here. :y . I feel like what you're requesting here is an Arc Tool, which I would also love to see in ASE sometime soon. :D \nArc tools are notoriously tricky to make, though, especially when you add to it the option of having an arc that represents a segment of a circle that doesn't begin at a ninety-degree angle. I remember that Flash had a really elegant solution to this kind of situation using a dialogue box the user could input arc parameters (starting angle, terminal angle, for instance) in to, as an option.\nIn any case, thank you for suggesting this!. Aa, that is true: there are already the \"Play Animation\" and some frame rate commands in there as well, so Frame is also a good home for it. :D\nIn truth, the destination isn't as important to me as accessibility. Frame is probably a better pick; I only suggested View because there were already onionskin and loop settings there (and I hadn't thought to give Frame close inspection). \ud83d\ude05 . Pleased to be of service~ <3. If it helps you to know it for the meantime, the Shading brush mode will let you increment and decrement colours in a specified sequence from your palette. :D \nIt even works outside of 8-bit/indexed colour mode! But you can only use the colours from the picker.\nBecause you can choose the sequence of the colour gradient, there are situations where this is a bit more powerful than a lighten/darken tool, but because it only functions with the colours selected from a relatively limited palette, and in relation to the pixels under the brush/shape tool you have active, it has limitations that a specific lighten/darken tool would not.\nAnyway, this is not me telling you your idea already exists! I also think the new tool would be useful!\nBut as a temporary alternative that might suit your needs for now, here is one potential solution. :)\nHope that helps! :D. This issue is related to the bug described in #1632.. This is a weird problem that occurs when all of the following conditions are true:\n\nThe current file is in the Indexed colour mode.\nThe Mask colour is set to Index 0 in Sprite properties.\nIndex 0 has its alpha value set to exactly zero.\n\nIf Index 0's alpha level is anything other than zero, or the Mask is set to an index value other than 0, or the graphic is not in indexed mode, the bug does not occur, even if the current mask index (which is not zero) does have an alpha of exactly zero (ha ha what??).\nIt took a lot of fiddling to discover why, too, I will have you know! XD\nIt is possible that there are other elements I did not discover.. That is more or less what I mean, yeah.\nI would still like to have to tool but that does save me a lot of effort.\nI am a little surprised I missed it considering that it is the second option in the hotkey pane. Oops. \ud83d\ude13 \nAnyway, thanks; that helps a lot!. Aa, I thought that that might have been the case.\nMaybe someday, then, in that faroff place called 1.3. ;3\nThanks for considering it, though! :D. \ud83c\udf89 \nFantastic, thank you! :D. Regarding 2b: I suspect there is a bug here then, as the .gifs I export with ASEprite have some rather extreme quantization errors when I save them in RGB mode.\nCompare these two images derived from the same 24-frame, RGB-mode animation loop:\n\n\ud83d\udd3c The first .gif is a 32-frame screencapture recording made with LICEcap of an animation playing normally in ASEprite. It is 841x524px. and about 408kB.\n\n\ud83d\udd3c The second is a 24-frame .gif format graphic exported directly from ASEprite. 800x496px. but more than five times the size at 2,140kB. Note the palette disagreements between frames on colours which do not change in the original.\nIt looks a lot like the image has been converted to 8P mode, quantizing each frame individually (which would make sense if no frame had more than 256 colours), but then saving in RGB mode anyway.\n\ud83d\udd3d To make matters stranger, when I reopen the exported .gif file in ASEprite and convert it to 8P mode manually, the colours in the image are quantized again, deviating even farther from their original colours. \n\nIt seems that, currently, image data is being quantized regardless of total or per-frame colour count (rather than only when it is less than 257) and then saved in whatever colour mode the Editor is set to.. What gets me is that it seems to be running RGB -> Indexed -> RGB before it saves .gifs; cause: unknown. It would make sense if the palette was small but obviously this is not the case.\nWhen I open the .gif, it opens in RGB mode, even though the colours are clearly distorted. \ud83d\ude15 \nAs to my issue titles, I will try to pare them down a bit from here on out. \ud83d\ude09 . Aa, I have encountered this issue and would also like to see this fixed. It was a side effect I forgot to mention in #1549 as well. :1 . I know this is an issue specifically related to RGB mode but it might be worth considering how a revised control scheme might relate to any future per-frame palette feature..\nIf we are eventually given the ability to modify palettes on a per-frame basis, then \"Replace Colour\" would need to be revised in a way that considers whether colours are replaced/altered by-index (changing whatever colour is in a given index slot to the new value), or by-value (replacing a specific colour-- \"Red\", \"#a566c0\", \"(255,0,255)\", et cetera-- with the new one, regardless of index value).\nAnyway, I do not expect the solution to this issue to include the per-frame palette option. It just may be worth considering this bit of extensibility. ^^ . This is kind of an aside but if we have specific-layer and specific-frame selections, perhaps the Timeline could be altered so that all relevant cels have a different background colour? The light-grey background and dark-grey current layer/frame setup is good for now, but it would be nice if intersecting cels were made some third thing; a dark red, maybe?\nThis is not strictly necessary; it would just make it more obvious which cels are actually included in whatever operations we perform, which would speed things up and perhaps help avoid errors in complicated documents.. In truth, it is something I kind of wish I had right now, even outside the context of multi-cel operations. XD. > Not yet sure, I think Ctrl+click should start copying. So maybe shift+click should be the only way to increment selection (just like the rectangular marquee works on the canvas).\nAre we making a distinction between CTRL-LMB-Drag and CTRL-LMB here, or are they handled the same way? (Non-CTRL) LMB-drag behaves differently from LMB-click (kind of), so I had assumed that they were different enough that it would be all right for them to do different things in this way. I am totally prepared to be wrong, though! \n\nActually I'm testing on Linux and I can click in frames inside the preexisting range with Shift+left mouse button. (Ctrl+click doesn't work, but Shift+click does work.)\n\nRechecked. SHIFT-LMB does work. My bad; I probably got the whole CTRL- vs. CHIFT-LMB-layer selection thing mixed up in my thoughts. x_x\nThanks for the speedy response!.  > I didn't find a good way to fix this. With an extra color shade it's too confusing (too many shades).\nI suppose what I am imagining is something like this:\n\nThe red cel being the intersection of the current frame and active layer.\n(It does not have to be red. XD )\nOr even throwing that yellow outline around relevant frames. I feel like that might get too busy after a while, but it would be very clear which frames were and were not included and would not require an expanded colour table for the Timeline.\nNot exactly, anyway.. <<;. I have this other mockup, if you are interested in that look.\nI do not like this version as much as the first, I think, for reason that it adds _even more colours to something you feel is too varied already. But here it is anyway, for your consideration:\n\nI am not 100% on this colour scheme but you get the idea. ^^;. I have updated the top post in this thread to include a checklist, if that makes things easier for you.\nI do not know what you define as \"complete,\" so the boxes have been left unchecked.\nIf you do not want to curate it, I can do it as changes are moved to the beta or main branches. \ud83d\ude03 . I would also love to see this option.. I can see a lot of useful overlap with #1762 as well.. Mainly, I just wanted to tack this small feature into the longer list on #1321 without dredging up a thing from seven months ago directly (although, looking back on it, that is probably what I ought to have done <_<;;;).\nIn the context of the changes there, this is probably just a matter of adding a function to the Layer menu and three lines of code (create a blank Reference Layer+Paste from clipboard), but on its own it could represent a lot more than that, yes.\nIt would probably be most useful if it came after some revision that allowed Reference Layers to operate in their own colour mode instead of being coerced into an Indexed palette (if the Workspace is in 8P mode).\nBut yeah, pasting into an extant Reference Layer works.\nIt would also probably do to have an option (perhaps RMB on Layer in the Timeline?) that converts normal or background layers to reference layers (and vice-versa, colour quanitization and all).... It would be great to see something like this potentially integrated with #1762. :D . It would be nice to potentially specify how many frames to travel in the Keyboard Shortcuts pane when a new binding is assigned. That way we can retain options for advancing and backtracking a single frame as well as being able to travel several at a time (probably with a SHIFT or CTRL combination on the same keys).. I have to throw you an easy one sometimes.\nI guess. \ud83d\ude12 . Any chance this might see a fix? ^^;. Keyboard shortcut.\nI actually had forgotten about the \"!\" button entirely.\nSeems to work now, but I cannot figure out what the problem might have been.\nMaybe the colour was already in the palette somehow??\nHm. I guess this is a non-issue after all.\nI will reopen it if I can narrow down what happened.\nThanks! :D. Whoops, sorry about that. x_x;. Works in Win10 confirmed.\n(Those are some very Belgian tags you have there. \ud83d\ude1c ). Goddamnit, I did not know Git did not search my closed tickets too, so I missed the old report entirely.\nHa ha. Embarrassing. Sorry for the duplicate! \ud83d\ude13 . Related to #1570.. It looks like that got it!\nI did not know what the [Selected/All] switch did but it makes sense now. I cannot remember which layer I had selected when I made the .gif but it looks like your instructions solved it.\nI will keep an eye on it and let you know if there are any exceptions, but for not it looks like I was just using the tool incorrectly (wrong layer selected? / incorrect layer selection mode).\nWill reopen if I rediscover the problem later.\nThanks again! :D . If there was time, it might be nice to have an option in Preferences or somesuch where we might be able to specify default nomenclature for serial saves or New Sprite From Selection documents, too. :D . Or, actually, failing that kind of solution, are there any quick workarounds, maybe?\nIf I knew what connected the pen tablet input to the Eraser tool (or any tool, I suppose), I might be able to fix it locally.\nThanks again! :D . Possibly related to #1833.. ",
    "irskep": "You probably already have this prioritized, but as a long-time Mac user, native menus are not even on my radar for Aseprite feature requests. The current UI is charming!. ",
    "whizzter": "I was pondering about this (and with other tools also) since i often find myself iterating things in different projects with different needs usually resorting to a makefile or batch file so my flow typically becomes: editor -> run batchfile -> test (or go over if i forgot to run the batchfile!).\nMaybe aseprite could look for a specially named file in the target directory and then run it on save/export if it exists.\nF.ex. saving blah.ase somewhere would run \"aseprite_auto_export.bat blah.ase\" (or aseprite_auto_export.sh on non-windows). That way people could write their own batch export rules or tools in their own languages regardless of whatever scripting language you look into in the future?\n. ",
    "tony": "Is this still being pursued? I ask because I think that since adding skia the build process has gotten a lot harder. It kind of made the on-ramp for me as a contributor harder:\n\nSkia isn't available as a library package on most systems\nI haven't tried building in a few months, but when I did skia didn't snap-in directly with a source build since it requires grabbing depot_tools and building on its own. Recently though, I see it has a \"GN-to-Cmake\" script, which I haven't tried yet.\n\nSDL2, on the other hand, is already packaged as a library on most systems and pretty simple to find/build against with CMake. Here is the C++ wrapper I use with it: https://github.com/libSDL2pp/libSDL2pp. I wasn't around when the decision was made to use Skia. But what made it the choice over Allegro 5, SFML, and SDL2?\n\nAnother idea is to give support for several graphics libraries. E.g. we control all window/mouse/keys events, but we use several back-end libraries just to render graphics (e.g. SDL2, Allegro, SFML, etc.).\n\nI've seen some examples of abstraction to allegro/sdl2/etc. in openttd: https://git.openttd.org/?p=branches/1.7.git;a=tree;f=src/video;h=14caa02f215d822ccb469d111f4c76c732866d92;hb=41937d6e6402fdbfedc926663a880d21deb603db (unfortunately the code itself is GPL'd).\n\nPros: +give the chance to change the back-end on runtime +best performance on each platform +possibilities of compilation/run on more machines\n\nThat would be interesting to see the results of. \n\nCons: -maintenance hell\n\nI have nothing against skia other than it being a barrier of entry when building aseprite from source. As of this day, even Debian doesn't have a package for it, there's been an RFP request back in March 2016. Nothing in homebrew or freebsd ports at this time exists.\nOn the other hand, sfml, sdl2, and allegro are packaged across linux distros, homebrew and bsd ports, and could make the source easier to build from. Either one of them IMO would lower the barrier to contribute.. I understand the perspective better since the point on input/events was reiterated.\nOriginally, I was thinking maybe SDL2 would be an OK compromise since it's geared toward events/drawing primarily, it even has some code for handling stuff like stylus/touch (though I don't see support for stuff like tilt). I guess even SDL2 would be too high level since it manages the window and events.\nI'm still stuck with skia making the project harder to build.. @dacap IMO this is a prereq for #789 (or anything else that follows in a similar spirit to it) It'd hard to have a sense of scale without a ruler.\nI like the idea of rulers, then also guides.\nBy #481, do you think that draggable \"guides\" would eliminate the need for multiple grids?\n (source: https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/grid-guides.html)\n. (By the way, using a tiled window manager, works great tiled and untiled.)\n. @TheKK is this better\n. @dacap I'm fine w/ changing the default key.  I think Shift-C seems nice.\n. @dacap better now\n. Tested Jan 2nd, 2016 on El Capitan (10.11):\nDownload xcode314_2809_developerdvd.dmg from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/.

Hi, I made a PR clarifying OS X build instructions.  This is intended clear up ambiguity introduced in the current instructions.\nSee it in situ @ https://github.com/tony/aseprite/blob/install-rewrite/INSTALL.md\n@dvlpstrcrispin\nCan you double check skia was built from chrome/m50 branch?\n\nAlso the chrome/m50 branch for skia is no longer there it seems...\n\nIts still there. Do you not see it in git branch -la?\nThe remote still has it, https://github.com/google/skia/tree/chrome/m50.\n\nSKIA_DIR to point to the checkout directory. However in the \"Mac OS X\" section he tells to point SKIA_DIR to a compiled version.\n\nAt the current time (7c9b9ea, April 2016) SKIA_DIR points to your skia checkout (the root of the project), not out/Debug or out/Release. See the src/she/CMakeLists.txt. -DSKIA_DIR will end up being used to look for the built out/{Debug,Release} inside.\nBy \"compiled version\", its meant that skia should be compiled there before hand, since it'll be looking for the build files that end up in the out/ of the skia project.\n. @zwik   When I had that same error, I ended up using a scratch repo to fix the problem, so I never isolated why that happened.\nTry doing a ninja clean and rebuilding.  If that doesn't work, you may need to clean out the skia files (something like git clean -d -x -f if you wanted to be aggressive). Then rerun skia instructions from scratch.   Then after that, try to run ninja for aseprite.\n. @OrenjiAkira Yes, the ninja -C out/Release dm inside of the skia checkout compiles the skia libs for you.\n. When you look in your history, did you use ninja -C out/Debug dm or ninja -C out/Release dm?\nI notice my instruction use ninja -C out/Debug dm.\nIf you used ninja -C out/Debug dm, can you try ninja -C out/Release dm, then run ninja again for aseprite?\nIf you used ninja -C out/Release dm, can you try ninja -C out/Debug dm, then run ninja again for aseprite?\n. @zwik what version of OS X are you on?  What version of ninja, cmake?\nCan you get the git rev-parse HEAD for skia and aseprite?\nRe: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1089#issuecomment-214908250\nAre you sure you're doing the export GYP_DEFINES='skia_gpu=0'?  Does the terminal you built skia have any output to echo $GPU_DEFINES?\n. @dacap heh, yes. Ideally the issues should be for development related tasks (being a tracker), not Q&A. You wouldn't but a Q&A on bugzilla. \nI've seen Google Groups used as a place to divert discussion for that.\nYou can use GitHub wiki for community-based documentation. skia keeps per-platform instructions in their repo on their website: https://github.com/google/skia/tree/master/site/user/quick\n\nLooking at the amount of recent issues reported to compile Aseprite, it seems that a very low percentage of (C++) programmers are trying to compile Aseprite. We're having a lot of noise with compilations issues.\n\nSomeone being a C++ programmer, whatever standard that would be to you, wouldn't make everything inherently obvious and unambiguous. I had to go on an expedition to figure out why skia wouldn't build correctly for me, that the CMake can't be used to build without GPU support. So that I had to go grab depot_tools.  You could blame it on me seeing a CMakeLists.txt and assuming it works - and not reading cmake/readme.md that says its only experimental.\nIncorporate skia adds a big step to building aseprite, probably bigger than configuring and building aseprite itself. I think the increase in the issues is caused by the skia migration - and that docs are a way to decrease the noise.\n. > Also I'm seriously thinking that Ninja should be almost mandatory (if someone wants to use other build system, is because he/she knows about CMake)\nI concur, I'll update to reflect that.\n. @dacap how about now?\n. yeoopo\n. @MattGuerrette bingo\nSee all this drama caused?  See how @dacap, the guy who did >95% of the work getting mobbed?\nLook at this: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/graphs/contributors, just 27 contributors. Over all those years.\nThe moral of the story, what this message sends: pick GPL, build your project in good faith, and be prepared to get floored.\nWhat a backwards way to treat a person who devoted a good deal of their life to a project.  Can you imagine for a second how it feels?\nIn many cases, the people complaining aren't contributors at all.\nPeople who keep talking about \"freedom\". As a fellow open source programmer who used to cargo cult GPL longer than a decade ago, I want you to ask confront honestly what GPL gives you and what you lose.\n1. See how permissive licenses end up getting you the same net-result in the end (seeing the source, contributions back), examples: I can build a memstick image in freebsd right now, kernel, base system and all, from the source. (for those who use linux and not bsd, basically equivalent to a base linux distro install, with build tools/headers, without X), look at the python/node ecosystem, mostly permissive licensed, heavy reciprocity\n2. See how GPL's side effects complicate projects - LLVM and Clang, Linux and ZFS. I've also probably helped 10 or so projects convert from (L)GPL to permissive licenses, the gray hairs involved.. by the time the conversion was complete 3/4 of the time I moved onto something else.\nLet this be a lesson to people who pick GPL, the values it espouses are great, but the license in itself has so many side effects that burn projects in the long run.\nI'm fine with any license change @dacap wants.\n. (@dacap I'm begging for an alternative to skia. >_< Something that can just work with CMake. It really is a nightmare to building from source and patching. I never got a single build working since the Skia switch happened. I can't imagine Skia's benefits helping more than the headaches it brings to the build process, but then maybe it's me. I don't know :smile:). Why not? Its a source of confusion when building the project. The library dependency, unlike allegro, isn't available through package managers. It also requires a third party tool (depot tools).\nIn lieu of that, is linking to the installation instructions on the Skia website OK?\n. I will consolidate this section.\nI don't like the noise either - I'd rather keep it brief (because adding this also means there's more to update if a detail changes). I'm trying to balance that and potential ambiguity for newcomers - some of which are not familiar with build systems like CMake.\n. ",
    "zed9h": "@dacap I am willing to make a preview of the cel's image (this issue is about it, right?). It may be toggleable to be drawn at the timeline; at some window on cel select; or at an overlay on cel mouse over -- not sure which one yet. If you had explored this path already drop me a note.\n. In terms of productivity on complex sprites, the image on the timeline is pretty useful to find the cel quickly, but to see the details it's good to have the larger preview. \nTo get used to the timeline I think I will do the preview window first, then I will try to put the images on the small timeline, and at last make a larger timeline. Let's see how I go.\n. Hunnn, it figures, I saw some folder stuff on the file formats and realized that it could appear sometime. \nOK, I will keep that in mind, and try to stay away from structures that shape the timeline. I will try to keep myself on the mouse events handlers and maybe the cel draw, but will not try to make a larger timeline for now.\n. I chose to control the lifetime of the cache with the scope of the items on layered maps, and the decision of the classes in between. Each tier with it's own authority to use erase on all thing below it, and the destructors would do the job of cleaning up, so:\n1. the Cache tier is responsible to keep the count of surfaces under a maximum, and also listen for removal of documents with the help of the UIContext (inter-document changes);\n2. the Document tier listen to changes in the document preferences (intra-document changes);\n3. the Image tier verify if the version and clean all surfaces cached under it ,if it changed;\n4. the Surface tier is were the data resides, and is responsible to generate, dispose and count it.\nThe Request and Tag help out with this passing of parameters between the tiers, the first initializes what would be required and the second helps to organize the data (for instance, when it was last used), it's a materialization of the more volatile Request.\n. Hi @dacap, any preferences on the order to apply those changes?\nWhat about send 3 more PRs:\n- [PR1] preferences\n  - connection from the preferences to the conf popup so the cmd keypress would change the checkbox\n  - remove the quality option (hardcode the bilinear scaler)\n  - provide a better feedback about how the overlay would look with the selected settings\n    - separate the preferences of the overlay and the thumbnails\n    - connection with the overlay prefs to display it's looks while they the settings are changed \n- [PR2] quality\n  - replace the bilinear scaler with a custom box sampling\n- [PR3] cache\n  - thumbnail cache structures\n  - hooks to cache clear \n. ### Surface Generation\nYour suggestion is like a mipmap, but mipmaps are normally used with trilinear interpolation, and would require a decent downscale to begin with; a nearest-neighbor to generate the mipmap, and another nearest-neighbor to generate the final surface would look terrible, specially for line drawings. Take a look:\n\nThe box sampling I implemented is the fast variant, that doesn't factor in the difference in weight of the border of the boxes sampled; it's for downscale what the nearest-neighbor is for upscale.\nIf your worries are about:\n- memory usage: the cache is handling the surface  count, and could handle the memory usage as well;\n- processing time: generate two (cel->16x16->11x11) or three (cel=>[16x16,32x32]->11x11) scales, in place of one (cel->11x11), will probably be slower, specially because of the overhead of all the intermediate images; \n- interface sluggishness: I could do a background thumb generation on another thread.\nPreferences\nMaybe zooming the timeline will fix a lot of the problems of the small thumbnails, I will try that out and see what preferences I can get rid of.\nJust to explain my rationale:\nI agree that the overlay does not need the background color, this setting is mainly for the thumbnails; from my tests, for such small images to look sharp on the background, it really depends on what colors it uses:\n- it's non trivial to select a background color automatically;\n- choose an arbitrary color can completely hide some images;\n- and there is no space for the checkered background on a small thumbnail.\nIt is also on the overlay because I embed the background color on the surface, to have one less draw call, and to cache it with the thumbnail images without concern.\nI will give it a try with the checkered background on all surfaces it may work better than I thought.\n. ### Performance\nYeah... the thread thing is a bit more complicated than I anticipated, but there's another option: we could just throttle the generation (e.g., to a maximum time spent per second), and set a timer to invalidate the widget that requested them, when triggered it would process more surfaces, until all the thumbs were generated and served from the cache.\nQuality\nTrilinear is the linear interpolation of the two bilinear interpolations between the two images closer to the size of the output image. It's good because one probably generated those intermediary images ahead of time with a better downscaler, but it's not that good for real-time scaling of arbitrary source images. Bicubic samples more pixels (4x4) than bilinear (2x2), but does not solve the problem of the down-sampling, it's nice for up-scaling or small changes in size, and seems specially good for sub-pixel translations.\nI didn't meant that my version was the fastest possible, just that I choose the simplest of the two usual variants :P. I would really recommend using it for thumbnails, it's not perfect, but is a good performance / quality compromise.\nPreferences\nThe idea of showing the thumbnails only if the timeline is zoomed is interesting. I did a slider to zoom the timeline, and changed the headers so they did not zoom, to simulate a more realistic usage, and I missed the thumbnails with small cels, because they are particularly useful on large timelines and those are more manageable with more cels visible on the screen, both things work well together, small cels with thumbnails. So even if the default could be like your suggestion, it would be interesting to have the option to always show the thumbnails.\nWhat about this combobox on the thumbnail preferences: \n- Show when zoomed (default)\n- Always show\n- Never show\nI am also thinking in a way to remove the opacity setting; it's there to make the cel linking symbols visible, but if there is more space on the timeline they could be over the thumbnails. For small thumbnails it could be shown on the overlay only. What about this behavior?\nThe checkered background is working nicer than I expected, not as sharp as a hand picked solid background color, but as the checkered background colors are configurable, and the default is ok for most images, that is a pretty nice solution.\n. @dacap, maybe It would be cleaner if I create a helper to decode/encode the PNG for both file formats, but first I will work on the Pixly format save, which will add more value upfront.\nPS: I will read the CLA.\n. I signed the CLA and finished the Pixly file save; the code ended up much simpler than the original PNG format, because it only handle RGBA, take a look if you think it worth the generalization of the codec. For me it was easier to handle a standard lib code than aseprite internal structure, even when I found the latter pretty clear and organized.\n. @dacap Great points, I placed many more check()s and improved the error messages. I will send some good files and some bad ones to test the exceptions.\n. If I remove the FILE_SUPPORT_PALETTE_WITH_ALPHA and the auto-generated palette has some alpha on it, there will be a warning every time the file is saved, so I think I will need to keep this flag, even if the palette will not be saved. I also added FILE_SUPPORT_BIG_PALETTES for the same reason. (Not really sure if this is the right way to go.)\nI cleaned up some includes that seemed unnecessary.\n. As I suspected when I saw the line of the error, the cel image can be smaller than the sprite size, I will compensate for that.\n. Of course, if the palette is user created there should be a warning.\n@dacap BTW, I didn't explain it properly here, the \"collums\" (sic) are on the official Pixly format, nothing I could do about it.\n. Good one, I almost sent the patch on a message on the last PR :)\n. Fixed the crash, it was due to an aspect ratio issue; I also improved the quality and alignment of the thumbs, but now it really needs that cache and some options to customize speed vs quality.\nI will first work on the options, then learn about the document observer. @dacap, you think it should be on App, listen to the modification of Cel images and automatically generate the thumbs, even if they were not seen yet, or the Timeline should request the App to create them on demand?\n. @dacap, I also added the size of the overlay to the prefs, and rearranged it's layout to better use the space.\nThe preferences and gui systems are pretty nice to work with, but one thing I was not sure were if I had to call doc()->notifyGeneralUpdate() on every change callback and also don't know if I had to use migrate on the pref.xml.\nIt seems only the cache is missing now.\nPS: I did a ShowCelPreviewThumbCommand on F6 (near ShowOnionSkin on F3 and TogglePreview on F7)\n. > About the Thumb and Zoom terms in the UI and preference variables (without checking out the code and seeing the UI) I'm not sure what does they mean.\nI am not really satisfied with the naming too. Not really sure what to call the overlay.\n\nThe general update notification is used to know if the document/sprite/model structure has changed. In this case it shouldn't be necessary to call it because we're changing UI configuration only.\n\nHow should I notify the timeline to update the thumbnails?\n. > Here you might start listening changes in docPref.thumbnails/docPref.celPreview pref section, and here you might disconnect the signal slots (use a base::ScopedConnection for this).\nOK, nice.\n. (I was writing about this, but you were quicker than me :)\n\n1) The cache class should be in other file (TimelineThumbnailsCache, timeline_thumbnails_cache.cpp/h or something similar). I've a pending refactor for the Timeline to put the whole implementation in a src/app/ui/timeline/, but that will be for a future version.\n\nSure, sure, it's a bit of a boilerplate right now. I was looking for the place to put the new class.\nI saw that the documents are managed at UIContext, so is it OK to place the cache class as a member of it? Then I can addObserver on it to listen to removeDocument (to clean the document), as well as onChange of the thumbnail prefs, and I was thinking in use the context's onActiveSiteChange to (clean the cel being drawn), but it may not be necessary with the version.\n\n2) Try to avoid exposing the cache class functionality/internal implementation to the timeline as much as possible. The best cache API would be something like cache.getThumbnail(cel) or cache.setThumbnail(cel) (I'm not sure if the Timeline should know more than that about the cache.)\n\nFor sure, now that it's working I have a better idea of the interface I will need. The only thing I was not sure were if the cache should generate the surface, or if it should be timeline and just store on the cache. But your suggestion gave me an idea, to index the cache by thumb size as well, so it could be safely used by anyone.\n\n3) You can use the Object::version() field to know if the thumbnail should be regenerated.\n\nGreat! That was what I was looking for. I was trying to track each individual image with the events from the DocumentObserver, but onRemoveFrame is called after the cels were deleted, and onImagePixelsModified is not called by anyone. The version could be perfect.\n\n4) The DocSurfaceCacheRecentlyUsed is a std::multimap, is this needed? I see the code quickly and the map is not accessed by the key (timestamp). I think you are using this to sort items by timestamp (but it looks like the order is not guaranteed)\n\nThe order is guaranteed, just not necessarily the stable ordering (items of the same timestamp to be always ordered the same way). Also not sure I required a multimap, but the semantics seemed right.\n. I was a bit confused with app::Document vs doc::Document, but once I realized the meaning of the namespaces it were all fine and I ended up following the trend. I will draw a diagram to explain the design decisions and then we discuss naming and this layered structure (btw, I avoided using Layer and instead used Tier to avoid further confusion).\nYes, rotsprite is bringing more problems than solutions, as it's only slightly better than nearest neighbor and orders of magnitude slower in this scenery. Thinking more generally about the performance concerns, I was thinking about to place this thumb Requests in a queue on separate thread to avoid the problems of slow cache generation, where at first I would return a empty thumb, that later would be filled with the scaled pixels. I would need to notify the widget that requested it, somehow, that it's done, possibly by passing a pointer to it on the Request and calling invalidade when it's request is completely satisfied.\nIt's pretty easy to make the cache a separate PR, I will just remove all the Tiers except the Data one. I will do that and we talk about the cache and performance on the second PR.\n. I chose to control the lifetime of the cache with the scope of the items on layered maps, and the decision of the classes in between. Each Tier with it's own authority to use erase on all thing below it, and the destructors would do the job of cleaning up, so:\n1. the Cache tier is responsible to keep the count of surfaces under a maximum, and also listen for removal of documents with the help of the UIContext (inter-document changes);\n2. the Document tier listen to changes in the document preferences (intra-document changes);\n3. the Image tier verify if the version and clean all surfaces cached under it ,if it changed;\n4. the Surface tier is were the data resides, and is responsible to generate, dispose and count it.\nThe Request and Tag help out with this passing of parameters between the Tiers, the first initializes what would be required and the second helps to categorize the Data (for instance, when ir was last used), it's a materialization of the more volatile Request.\nThe interfaces at the beginning (Tier, Directory and Data) were to help thinking about and implementing it consistently, they are not really necessary, could turn into a documentation.\n. I removed the rotsprite option, removed the abstract classes from thumb namespace and used their names as suffixes of the other ones, I also copied the outline of the design decisions to the issue #152, because the cache code is on #1203 now.\n. See if it was what you meant; when you merge it, I will merge on the second PR.\n. Sure :)\nI did it in a hurry, didn't even noticed that I removed the copyright.\n. I believe both are fixed on my last PR, I will merge it all on a pseudogames/timeline-thumbnails branch.\n. @dacap I switched to debug and noticed an assert failing on the Pixly load, the code is not wrong, but the assert is also reasonable:\n``` c++\n        uint32_t src_begin = (uint32_t)sheet->getPixelAddress(x0           , y0_down);\n        uint32_t src_end   = (uint32_t)sheet->getPixelAddress(x0+frameWidth, y0_down);\n        uint32_t dst_begin = (uint32_t)image->getPixelAddress(0, y);\n    std::copy(src_begin, src_end, dst_begin);\n\n```\nc++\n    uint8_t* getPixelAddress(int x, int y) const override {\n      ASSERT(x >= 0 && x < width());\n      ASSERT(y >= 0 && y < height());\nAs I am only handling RGBA, here is a simple patch to fix it:\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/src/app/file/pixly_format.cpp b/src/app/file/pixly_format.cpp\nindex 75a1e87..a38c03a 100644\n--- a/src/app/file/pixly_format.cpp\n+++ b/src/app/file/pixly_format.cpp\n@@ -173,8 +173,8 @@ bool PixlyFormat::onLoad(FileOp fop)\n       for (int y = 0; y < frameHeight; y++) {\n         // RGB_ALPHA\n         int y0_down = sheetHeight-1 - y0_up - (frameHeight-1) + y;\n-        uint32_t src_begin = (uint32_t)sheet->getPixelAddress(x0           , y0_down);\n-        uint32_t src_end   = (uint32_t)sheet->getPixelAddress(x0+frameWidth, y0_down);\n+        uint32_t src_begin = (uint32_t)sheet->getPixelAddress(x0, y0_down);\n+        uint32_t src_end   = src_begin + frameWidth;\n         uint32_t dst_begin = (uint32_t)image->getPixelAddress(0, y);\n     std::copy(src_begin, src_end, dst_begin);\n\n@@ -328,7 +328,7 @@ bool PixlyFormat::onSave(FileOp fop)\n             // RGB_ALPHA\n             int y0_down = (sheetHeight - 1) - y0 - (frameHeight - 1) + celY + y;\n             uint32_t src_begin = (uint32_t)image->getPixelAddress(0, y);\n-            uint32_t src_end   = (uint32_t)image->getPixelAddress(celWidth, y);\n+            uint32_t src_end   = src_begin + celWidth;\n             uint32_t dst_begin = (uint32_t)sheet->getPixelAddress(x0 + celX, y0_down);\n         std::copy(src_begin, src_end, dst_begin);\n\n```\nIf you prefer a pull request let me know.\n.

Sorry, didn't explain it properly, those two issues you noticed were the last things I did on cel-preview3, and unfortunately they could not be cherry picked. The difficulty I'm in is that your requests are in the reverse order of my implementation, mostly because it was rather exploratory -- for instance, it took some time to realize how the connections worked.\nThe prefix on the commits were because at some point I was working on my master, specially when there were the Pixly ones too, and I was not really sure  how the work flow would go, but as the things got bigger and I started working on branches, I kept prefixing out of habit.\nI sure understand your point; such a large, long-standing code must be treated with respect. I think the only clean way to go with this changes is to re-implement it step by step, it would take much longer, but would be better for the process and the final quality.\nGood you pointed it all out, I will start another PR with only those two commits.\n. Redirect to #1209 \n. Take a look at linked cels, this with layers may do what you want.\n. @dacap, no problem.\nI opened #1224 too, with some experimentations we didn't discussed yet, so you can see what you think. It's a proposal to remove transparency at the expense of enlarging the timeline. After we finish this PR and comment on #1224, I will merge and clean it, for a proper submission.\n. OK, let me know what do you think, specially about #1224.\n. I committed some experimental things about the zoom with a layout that allowed to remove the opacity without hiding the cel linking styles:\n\nUnfortunately this solution uses more vertical space, but that's how the cel linking looks better. \nI tried with it over the thumbs and it hides too much of them and mixes with the drawings.\nNotice that the checkered background is at #1223 \n. I could not reproduce on Windows 10 64-bit with a 32-bit color display, using the latest from git.\n. I am a recent contributor, and will continue to contribute, even without GPL, because the CLA is not that bad, and @dacap is doing such a good work as a maintainer and designer, that I don't see any reasonable alternative.\nBut @MarcoEstevez, let's not forget the purpose of the open source licenses: imagine if ffmpeg or linux got pulled off by the maintainer, after thousands of contributors giving away their work for years to the public benefit. It's specially true if multiple enterprises are contributing to a common project.\nIf we use the argument about the electric bill literally, the maintainer would have to pay for all contributions, and all the discussion about common good could be thrown out of the window.\n. @oceanhahn, there is no oppression here, the GPL grants enough protection to equalize the sides and make the rules of the game pretty clear. Now I am taking some risk here, being not protected by it, but the CLA is reasonable, as I said, and I am trusting @dacap, because he is doing this great work so consistently for such a long time. I also don't feel it's a crime to try novel ways to earn a living with his work, that, as you put it, is clearly a work of love and I also respect the fact the he is still keeping the source open.\n. Cool, so, you liked this solution? \nIt's nice but, I still miss the thumbs on the small timeline. \nAnother idea: the overlay could be hidden by default when the timeline is larger.\nThis week were too busy, I will try to take a look at it in the next couple of weeks.\n. > Do you mean something like this:\n\n\n\nYes, something like this, because the highest usefulness of the thumbnails is for large timelines, where there's also little space to spare.\n\nOther possibility would be to move the thumbnail inside the cels-box, but I'm not 100% sure about this:\n\n\nThis seems to be the very best solution! And could work with the small thumbs too.\nWhat about test it, before the task \"linked cels could be shown in the following way\"?\nIf I start any of these tasks I tell you.\n. Taking a look at this:\n- vertical scroll jumps in big chunks when we have a big zoom (e.g. Zoom = 10)\n- add zoom with ctrl+mouse wheel (using alt actually, ctrl is used)\n. Doing that I also changed this:\n-  zoom is reset each time after we paint (e.g. on OS X we can change zoom with mouse wheel, after doing that, if we paint, the zoom is reset to the configured zoom level in preferences)\n- when we change zoom with mouse wheel we must update the scroll area\non the PR above.\n. Nice idea, I will try to find some time to work on these items.. I think I fixed all the issues.\n. Not sure if it would pay off to have a dependency like ffmpeg on aseprite, specially since you could easily convert the gif to video, with ffmpeg -i exported.gif exported.mp4, or even online on https://cloudconvert.com/gif-to-webm. The ffmpeg for windows are here: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ ...you could use that line on the cmd prompt, but you are probably better off with something like http://shedworx.com/smartconverter. If I do this I will have to initialize these values somewhere else:\ncpp\n  m_thumbnailsOverlayDirection = gfx::Point(int(frameBoxWidth()*1.0), int(frameBoxWidth()*0.5));\n  m_thumbnailsOverlayVisible = false;\n.

In Blender, the Circle Select is a special mode so the behavior of the wheel changes, but in Aseprite it is a normal mode in which many users may expect to still zoom in/out with the mouse wheel, so a modifier such a shift + wheel as suggested by rcorre seems appropriate.\nAlternatively, you could let us customize mouse shortcuts, but since customizable mouse shortcuts for mouse buttons alone is rare in applications (Jetbrains' IDEs come to mind), I guess that customizable mouse wheel shortcuts are quite hard to implement. And I guess that office automation apps such as Karabiner on Mac and X-Mouse Button Control on Windows do not entirely solve the problem, since they tend to consider mouse wheel scrolls as a single action, making it hard to consider the amount of scrolling. That said, mapping \"scroll up\" to \"+\" under some circumstances may work since we change the size one pixel at a time anyway.\n. ",

That might not be possible, though, considering layers are how depth is sorted (so how exactly to deal with overlapping \"objects\" might be awkward).\nIt also sounds like it would work well with the #977 Tilemap feature.\n.

I guess I'll wait - seems like that file would basically just be empty tagged like that...? Not sure if I get what it's supposed to do. A write-up would be helpful (though I usually get by with the GUI, so no rush, for me).\n\nsomething might not be working (did you try using other checkbox like layers too?)\n\nYeah, the other options work, but just not the Slices option.. Hey, just wanted to pop up in here and ask if slices could serve the purpose of defining hitboxes / specific important zones when implemented? Or is that a different concept?. Yo, thanks for the expansion on the data. From @dacap's explanation in #1651, he's got a good grasp of the idea of properly implementing slice animations, in a sense, which is great!. OK, I just tried exporting Slices again and it seems like they're being exported in JSON from the sprite now, which is great. Thanks, @dacap!\n@oceanhahn I don't know if you never got the answer, but basically, it's a way to define rectangles that can be exported from your animation along with your actual image. So this could be used for hitboxes, collision areas for tiles, etc. EDIT: Looks like it could also be used for things like separating an image out (so, for example, for GUI, which is inventive). Check out a bit of a discussion about it here: https://community.aseprite.org/t/slice-tool-how-does-it-work/143/4. Also interested in this.\n@dacap Your solution looks pretty simple! I might recommend making the shadowed tag have brackets pointing to the frame like the foreground one, just darkened according to the color of the tag. \nOtherwise, it seems fine to me!\n. Whoa, cool, that's way better already.. I also noticed this just today. Thanks for the tip on using a different tool as a workaround in the meantime.\n. Ah, I guess that'd work fine. Thanks! Should I close this, then?\n. Hey, I just popped up to ask this, too.

Would it be possible to add it to RGBA images?. OK. Thanks!. Hmm, still feels like a bug to me, as it's disorienting (to me, anyway) to have the copied sprite suddenly move to the center of the image / view. The user should know where the copy happened because they initiated it. I don't think there's a need to change the copy and paste location of an image just because it's off canvas.. The pasted item has the floating box surrounding it, though - that shows that they pasted something. If you wanted to, you could just add an additional indicator that shows that something was pasted.. OK, that makes sense - I'm talking about copying something that's off canvas, not off-screen. Here's an example of what I'm talking about:\n\nNotice after each paste that the copied area moves back to the canvas. That's a bit disorienting if you want to do something across multiple frames (like scroll a sprite across the canvas in an animation).. ",

    "raetiacorvus": "Can be closed as duplicate of #796 \n. This bug should be closed, as current master compiles without problems with clang 3.6.2.\n. @Eiyeron there is probably no real solution till #139 gets fixed and aseprites port to skia is finished. You can try several workarounds to raise performance, look at this thread and #76 for some. Additionally you could try to use libinput package on arch it slightly reduced the lag in my case.\n. @dacap i think this can be closed as the current version for windows is already distributed with an installer.\n. This is still happening if you keep the middle mouse button pressed the whole time, means before alt tabbing, while alt tabbing and after one has switched to another window. If at that point you still hold the middle mouse button, aseprite still captures the cursor. \n. Hi @martinkg ,\ni could not reproduce this error with a clean docker F22 image, can you retry to build aseprite without rpmbuild, so we can make sure the error does not come from that:\nshell\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite\nmkdir aseprite/build && cd aseprite/build\ncmake .. && make\nand could you post a link to the spec file you are using for rmpbuild?\n. @martinkg, the fpaste is password protected\n. Ok i tested it and it really seems to be related how rpmbuild works. i could not reproduce the error outside of its build environment so it is probably some variable it passes or some path it sets. I noticed that the %build part works without problems as it does not compile the tests. The error is reported the moment make install is called in the %install part as it re compiles all targets for the installation, including the test part.\nIf you really need a rpm maybe you can try to use CPack: https://schneide.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/build-a-rpm-package-using-cmake/\n. I could not reproduce this on arch 64 bit, and also not in a docker debian container which is debian:jessie. What cmake switches do you use?\n. The travis builds failed do to the split_filename_tests bug. Is it possible to redo it without another pull request?\n. Thanks for having the patience to review my code. I think we should keep #273 open till i get the  extended format implemented.\n. Sorry for the many commits, i did amends and did not know github would behave this way.\nFor further steps it is probably best to take a look how Inkscape handles this.\nSo it would be probably best to inform linux users about the alt key issue in some form and how they can handle the problem.\nInkscape has a FAQ entry in its wiki that describes how they can either change the modifier key in Inkscape or how to change the Window Action Key in some of the more popular WMs.\nExample in the Inkscape Wiki\n. Sure Win is fine and probably nicer on the eye, i was unsure which to choose between Win and Windows. So with my next commit I switched to Win for Windows and to Super for Linux.\n. As Aseprite already has the nice feature to import and export Keyboard Shortcuts, maybe Aseprite should just ship with an alternative version of the Keyboard Shortcuts as importable.\n. I am mostly operating on Gnome-Shell as my WM and it uses Super for the Win Key in its Settings. As it seems so does Openbox. Wikipedia article on the super key. I think if you start to do any key mapping on linux you probably have to learn/know what the super key is. Alternatively both names could be shown on linux at least in the select accelelerator dialog or just make it clearer by moving it in the right order like the cmd modifier in the add accelerator dialog or both?\n\n. this seems to be a problem with gcc 5.1 and libwebp as you can see here http://sourceforge.net/p/freeimage/discussion/36110/thread/605ef8e4/\ni reported the issue upstream on the webp issues tracker\n@x421 till this is fixed upsteam you could use libwebp as shared lib (dnf install libwebp-devel and switch line 43 in the CMakeLists.txt to on) or use llvm/clang as compiler.\nEdit: Or rather don't use clang/llvm on Fedora 22 as it seems to have problems. Use the shared lib for now.\n. Just for the info there is already a patch available upstream. you could also just apply that for now.\n. actually the fixes are already merged in libwebp master\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/+/eebaf97f5a1cb713d81d311308d8a48c124e5aef\n. Telling your linux distribution and compiler when having problems compiling/linking helps a lot to reproduce your error and find a possible solution.\n. I could not reproduce those errors on a minimal arch docker image.  I also had no problem building aseprite on my personal system, which is also arch linux. Neither gcc nor clang did throw a linking error for the current master. Could the errors be related to some personal settings or environment variables? Did you pass some specific cmake parameters?\nFollowing are the commands i used after starting a base/devel docker container, which is the same as a minimal arch installation. It compiled and linked without errors.\n``` shell\npacman-key --refresh-keys\npacman --noconfirm -Syu\npacman-db-upgrade\npacman --noconfirm --needed -S base-devel cmake git libx11\ngit clone https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite\nmkdir aseprite/build && cd aseprite/build\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\ncmake .. && make -j4\n```\n. A sorry i forgot to ask. Which version of the source are you trying to compile? Or are you trying to compile the AUR version? https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=aseprite\n. @dacap i can take a look at it if you want. As mentioned in #698 it should be possible to integrate the process directly into cmake.\nhttps://schneide.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/build-a-rpm-package-using-cmake/\n. ### Notes on thumbnails on linux:\nGenerally there exists the Freedesktop Thumbnail Managing Standard which should be followed. In short thumbails are kept in the $XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails which defaults to ~/.cache/thumbnails if $XDG_CACHE_HOME is not set. There are two thumbnail sizes, large (256x256) and small (128x128). Files are png with some extra attributes like path to original file and last modified. The filename is a md5 hash on the uri of the original file.\nTo get a thumbnail generator on Ubuntu/Gnome you just have to write a entry file in .../share/thumbnailers\nhere as example of evince thumbnailer for pdf:\n[Thumbnailer Entry]\nTryExec=evince-thumbnailer\nExec=evince-thumbnailer -s %s %u %o\nMimeType=application/pdf;application/x-bzpdf;application/x-gzpdf;\nKDE seems to use something similar located in .../share/kservices5/\nShort solution for this probably is to extend aseprites command line mode with a xdg thumbnailer mode, which would solve thumbnail generation outside of the app usage. Those thumbnailers normally are only called when a folder containing the files to be thumbnailed is opened with the file browser.\nSo there is still need to handle thumbnail generation from within aseprite when using a native linux file dialog.\nIgnoring KDE as target platform, it is the possibility to just use GnomeDesktopThumbnailFactory  for thumbnail management but that creates a dependencie on libgnome-desktop.\nThen there is also tumbler which makes thumbnail management available over dbus according to this spec draft. While sounding nice, it seems to be the only thumbnailer that implements those so far.\nBut it is probably best to implement a independent thumbnail management in aseprite to prevent having any strong platform specific (Gnome, KDE, XFCE etc..) dependencies.\n. maybe something in this direction?\n\n\n. I can confirm that this greatly improves mouse performance on archlinux/wayland(1.10)/libinput(1.2). It still is not as smooth as the cursor acts outside the aseprite window but makes aseprite finally usable on linux for me.\n. Probably duplicate of #205 and related to #796. Try to assign a different key then alt if your window manager reservers it for other operations or change te usage of alt in your wm.\nThe keyboard shortcut is located under Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts->Tools->Eyedropper Tool (quick)\n. Well i just tried to get this running on Ubuntu 14.04 and it looks rather bad. This will probably be a 16.04 onward feature only.\n. Here some preview of the current state on gnome and ubuntu 15.10. What is probably still disturbing, is that aseprites menu stays open while the dialog is open. And like the last commit mentiones, further testing would have to be done how far the glib support is backward compatible. As a next stepp a preview widget would probably be nice.\n\n\n. > I'd like to read it.\n998\n. Short update on running this on other distros:\n- Running fine:\n  - Ubuntu >= 16.04\n  - ArchLinux\n- Running fine with glib flag:\n  - Ubuntu 15.10\n  - Fedora 22\n- Running with glib flag but into problems:\n  - Debian 8.3 (The dialog does not disappear on any action like open or cancel, i had this problem on newer versions when the dialog was not running in the context of a gtk app)\n- Not Running:\n  - Ubuntu <= 14.04\n  - Debian 7\n. Here some thoughts on the whole thumbnail situation:\nThere are two possibilities and maybe a combination of both.\nUse aseprites own thumbnailer for preview, which is already working with this, lets call it proof of concept. The upside of that is, that we have a better what you see is what you get preview. Also we have support for all formats that aseprite supports. The downside is the relative high loading time when first generating the thumbnail before we can access the cached version. Currently the UI is blocked when loading, but this could be changed. Still aseprites thumbnail loader is slower then just loading a png directly into Gdk::pixbuf.\nWhich gets us to the alternative approach. Using the built in gtk::image and gdk::pixbuf support we get fast preview and thumbnails for image formats supported by the gdk version the distribution provided.  Also we would get easy animation support for gifs and similar. The downside of this approach is that this excludes exotic formats and aseprites own format. It should possible to write own pixbuf loaders for gdk tough.\nSo one approach for now could be to use gtks native previews for a fast preview and only rely on aseprites own thumbnailer if the system does not support the file format. And for a later project it could be looked into getting together a \"libase\" which could be used to put together a gdk pixbuf loader but also for a gnome thumbnailer to get ase thumbnails in nautilus.\nWhat is you opinion on this?\n. Ok i reverted this to basic gtk image opening for now and will open a seperate bug/feature to write down some notes on thumbnail generation on linux.\n. Set the DXGUID_LIBRARY to the path of dxguid.lib. In my case that is C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)/Lib/x86/dxguid.lib for example.\nClick configure again and then generate.\nAdditionaly you probably have to add dxguid.lib in Linker -> Input ->  Additional Dependencies to the aseprite project.\n. probably duplicate of #1006 \n. I can confirm this regression when building with -DUSE_SHARED_CURL=OFF\n\nmy /usr/include/openssl/opensslconf.h\n\nYour shared lib headers should not matter when building with shared curl off.\nReplacing current thirdparty/curl with upstream curl and changing the include dirs line to set(CURL_INCLUDE_DIRS ${CURL_DIR}/include/curl)seems to fix this.\n. I hope this solves the licencing situation. I forgot to mention, the kde/qt thumbnailer also needs the cmake ECM Moduel. This should be the extra-cmake-modules package on ubuntu. \n. I tested the gnome thumbnailer under archlinux and opensuse tumbleweed with both running gnome-shell and the whole gnome stack so far. The kde thumbnailer has been tested on the current beta of kubuntu. At least on kubuntu cmake needs the paramter -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=on so the correct ${PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR}variable for the kde thumbnailer is set.\n. Power Shell should support globbing, could you try if it works with that? No problems with globbing on linux for me.\n. @JosephMichels if you feel comfortable using a unix shell on windows, you could use something like MSYS2  as a workaround for now. Just tested globbing with aseprite and it seems to work without problems.\n. duplicate of #1043 ?\n. ../lib/libcurl.a(ssluse.c.o): In function `ossl_connect_step1':\n/home/joshua/Workspaces/aseprite/third_party/curl/lib/ssluse.c:1473: undefined reference to `SSLv3_client_method'\nit is the same error. compiling with -DUSE_SHARED_CURL=ON meaning dynamic linked curl works for now.\nIf you really need to have the curl lib linked statically you can do as described in this comment  \n. With current master on linux i do not get a crash with unicodes but for some i am not really able to set them. I can enter them but they do not show up in the keyboard shortcuts after pressing ok in the accelerator add dialog. For example i can not use  german umlaut characters \u00f6 \u00e4 \u00fc. It should be also noted, that they show up when combing them with a modifier but do not trigger. This may be because for example alt+\u00f6 sends the character ;. Not sure if this is related to this bug or if i should open another one. Could also be that this will be solved with skia?\n. @Senpai-Artorias Maybe try cmakes gui if you have problems on the command line?\n. maybe because of #1066 ?\n. Right click the aseprite project and select properties then add the dxguid.lib to the linker.\n\nAdditionaly you probably have to add dxguid.lib in Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies to the aseprite project.\n. That is rather strange any project under the solution should have a full properties windows like this\n\n\ncould this be a restriction of the community edition of vs 2015?\n. #1026 #1087 \n. @shackra take a look at blend_internals.h\nit does indeed use the header from the third_party folder and you shared option in not relevant here.\nI suspect you did not do a git clone --recursive and are missing the pixman-combine-32.h for that reason. You always can init the sub-modules with git submodule --init --recursive.\n. Both the ProgressReport and FileWriter function are hooked into the libwebp encoder which then calls them while encoding. As soon as bytes to write are ready it directly writes them into the file. It also calls ProgressReport to update on its progress.\n. like noted in the commit this was a tab removed in a file using spaces for indentation\n. ",

Don't think Aseprite should be jack-of-all-trades here, because wishes will just grow and grow. There are lot of other things possibly required from such support: clipmasks/z-masks, 2D/3D tilemaps, animated voxel/point-cloud sources for isometric tiles/sprites, objects/locations placement with parameters and objects presets archetypes hierarchy, animated scenes timelines for sprites/objects/hints, different lighting/shadows support, advanced grids (hex-grids, walls-and-columns-around-cell grids, etc.). Just too many of them. But simple and clean Super Tiling support will be just OK. Better create another editor or mode for ATnT (Advanced Tiles & Tilemaps) =)\n. 2not-surt: And you can create isometric tiles (not tilemaps) in Aseprite using hint guides layer. Frames will be different sprites (or sometimes \"frames\"). Layers will help create complex tiles with layered layouts. And then use this tileset in tilemap/level editors, not image editor. Simple tiles is special case specifically because they do not overlap.\n. About blocks for Super Tiling I proposed at http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/1/405692224243720164/\nCopying blocks of tiles could be done by selecting tiles in Tileset window with Ctrl+click (they should be organized there for this, like 2x3 tiles for tree and etc.) or with Tiiling Pen on image layer with Ctrl+Alt+clicks, and then Ctrl+C to copy all selected tiles as image. Yes just an image. Then Ctrl+V to insert it. If current tool is Tiling Pen then Ctrl+V should insert it aligned to grid automatically and then movable with auto-aligning.\nAlso Ctrl+drag (Tileset window) and Ctrl+Alt+drag (image layer) could select/deselect tiles in rectangular block,yes.\n. 2dacap: about \"create a new kind of image that can reference different tiles/doc::Image on each area and with different rotation/flipping. (doc::TiledImage?)\"\nJust to clarify: for Super Tiling you don't need special kind of image. Only special kind of operations. It's perfectly possible to allow select existing files in Tileset window (and layer inside file for .ase files). And make combo list of such files with (+) and (X) buttons somewhere to add new and remove unwanted. And auto-select file and layer from this combo list then switching between layers of main image (restoring lastly selected file/layer for this layer).\n. For any tile WxH it's possible to calculate hash value using, for example, this function:\nub4 one_at_a_time(char *key, ub4 len)\n{\n  ub4   hash, i;\n  for (hash=0, i=0; i < len; ++i)\n  {\n    hash += key[i];\n    hash += (hash << 10);\n    hash ^= (hash >> 6);\n  }\n  hash += (hash << 3);\n  hash ^= (hash >> 11);\n  hash += (hash << 15);\n  return (hash & mask);\n} \nFrom: http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html\nIt's also possible to calculate hash values for flipped/rotated versions of same tile, because hash function is order-dependent.\nThese hash values could be used to create hashtable lookup of N lists, N = 2*max_tiles. Simply put tile index (and flip/rotate flags) into list with index = hash_value % N. Then when you need to find matching tile simply calculate hash value for your tile and lookup into same list and compare tile pixels only against those tiles in list (with flipped/rotated flags affecting comparison), not against all tiles of tileset.\nmax_tiles could be estimated as = ( tileset_width / tile_width + 1 ) * ( tileset_height / tile_height + 1 )\n. One worst case scenario estimation:\n1) image 8192x8192 designed with tiles grid 16x16, thus 512x512 tiles, 256K tiles total\n2) tileset 128x1024 with same tile size 16x16, i.e. 8x64 tiles = 512 tiles\n3) all image tiles same (for example, black), thus same hash value\n4) all tileset tiles same (for example, black), thus same hash value\n5) hash function for 16x16 = 256 bytes ~ max. 3000 processor ticks (for Indexed mode)\n6) let us have CPU 1Ghz\n7) 512 * 3000 * 8 ~ 12M ticks to calculate hash values for tileset (4 rotates with flips) ~ around 10ms\n8) 256K * 3000 = 768M ticks to calculate hash values for whole image ~ less than 1 sec\n9) 512 tiles in list for same hash value, compare every tile 512 times, 256K * 512 * ~1000(memcmp) = ~128G ticks ~ 100 sec ... hmm, slow =)\n10) to optimize don't add to hashtable same tiles, extra 511 comparisons, 511 * ~1000 ~ 512K ~ 0.5ms\n11) thus only 1 tile in list, thus  256K * ~1000 = 256M ~ 200ms\nAnd this 1.5 sec operation is rare operation only for special second click in Tileset window to select all tile instances in main image (including flipped/rotated) and edit them all. All other operations do not operate over full image. And this was really bad case scenario where hashtable failed because of all tiles were the same.\n. > ... anyway each tilemap layer will have one layer-specific tileset to create those automatic tiles when the \"Auto\" mode is enabled\nDo you mean old tiles not removed from this layer-specific tileset when they entirely removed from Tilemap Layer itself? And editor will keep order of tileset tiles until moved/edited by user just like colors of palette? Hmm... and we can load tiles to tileset from external tileset file (auto split by tiles size) once and then use them to draw map and later export tilemaps with exact tiles order saved? Sounds interesting. Hope tile width and height are Tilemap Layer properties then and could be any, for example 20x25 --- there're cases where art like this looks best. And image right and bottom not-full-tile-size edges should be ignored maybe. And we could mix different tiled layers, like 8x8 for physics, 16x16 for platforms and 32x32 for backgrounds. Also if add exporting of animated tilemaps (tiles indices) and maybe even with encode-only-changes-different-from-prev-frame mode it will be something like animated cutscene packing and partial image animations used in good old games.. > the final version of the tilemap editor should give us the chance to reference several tilesets (from external .aseprite files too) and use tiles from those tilesets in one or several layer tilemaps.\nTo keep things simple it could be really preferable to just have one single tileset inside each Tilemap Layer data and give user tools to copy images from external tilesets into this single tileset, so that exporting tilemap may produce simple indexes of tiles and those indices not broken even by \"Auto clear unused tiles\" option or \"Now clear unused tiles\" button, so tileset should really have used/not used bit flag for each tile and allow free moving of tiles inside tileset, it's often really useful to arrange tiles in tileset in specific manner, so those unused-flagged tiles around arranged tiles will be helpful.. > if that is locked in that way it might be harder to share tilesets between several tilemap layers (which could be a popular use case)\nWhile it's true, referencing external files and updating on them changed could be problematic without accurate relative paths policy and there appear set of sitations to handle somehow correctly --- when external file is not available anymore, when it was just moved nearby, when its format or content sizes has changed, etc. This is why it's really better to keep tiles inside one file and allow just two use cases: 1) always export custom tiles for each tilemap in your project and 2) load/reload tiles from external file into layer's tileset, keep their order and use them to export just tilemap indexes alone, using same exported  tileset in project i.e. export tilemap and export tileset should be two separate operations.. > Another possibility would be a double indirection: E.g. one tilemap tile could be an index that reference the layer tileset which itself is another reference to other tilesets\nThus adding \"Export tileset information\" operation in addition to \"Export tileset images\" (as ase or sprite sheet) and \"Export tilemap(s) data\" (indices only, multi-format desired here: plain binary, xml, TMX, etc.).. > but I think it would preferable to \"link\" them in some way most of the time\nIt's really question of induced complexity -- keep it simple and intuitive sprite editor with simple, but powerful tiling features or try to make it complex tilemapper. Instead or complex referencing it's possible to use external tilesets by loading (and maybe ref-file-reloading if parameters still matching) them into Tilemap Layer tileset data on user demand only. Yep, no complex tilesets from several sources while still referencing all of them are possible this way, but... is it really required?. > The details about how to lock/unlock tiles (content and index) weren't implemented yet, so that will need some hard thought\nSimpler is better here too, I think. All tiles in tileset should have permanent index by default. The only way to rearrange tiles should be by user actions, not automatically, not even in \"Auto\" mode --- which should only add new tiles, not trying to automatically delete or move existing ones without explicit \"Remove unused tiles\" and \"Defragment tileset\" operations executed by user only.. Although it may be not really artist-friendly to force them to keep tileset stable... maybe multi-referencing is better from this point of view. But... this way we will definitely need \"Export resulting tileset from all sources as multiframe ase / sprite sheet\" operation to allow easier final use.. > to allow tile sizes to be variable within an image as derived from their source Aseprite files. E.g., I may have a tree tile that's 48px x 64px, a water tile that's 8px x 3px, and a player tile that's 12px x 8px\nGenerally it's bad idea to turn sprite editor into feature-complete map editor, just because you will need so many more features and will lose its simplicity. While Tilemap Layer could be represented as map of cells internally, it's still better to represent it as pure image and allow image editing tools to modify it. It's always better to make best map editor on your own in your game (just because it will have all features you need) and leave sprite editor with simpler tasks, like image tiling (not necessarily for maps, it could be used for big tiled/partially-animated sprites too) and tagging any image with named per-frame animated rect/circle shapes (and also can use those shapes as animation guides which will be just cool). Anything like map of cells with overlapping tiles, floors or stacked-in-column tiles is just not sprite editor tasks, maybe David can create separate map editor for those =). > each pixel in the tilemap is a 32-bit value where it contains a tile index, a tileset index, and some flags (flip/rotation)\nThere are cases when we need more than 256 tiles, maybe up to 4096, considering animations. Thus 12 bits + 3 bits for flips/rot90 + 1 free bit = 16 bits or aligned happiness ^__^. Should magic like palette offset (by 8 colors? 256/8=32=5 bits) for each tile be considered excessive?. > The important thing is to look at each \"tile\" as a HIERARCHY of more-detailed parts (usually no more than 2 levels of detail deep, but provide 3 just to be safe)\nMaybe just Ctrl+click select shape of tiles from tileset and plotting them as whole would suffice? And also be able to Ctrl+click select shape of tiles from tilemap itself and copy/cut/paste them? Or add metatiling level to Tilemap Layer props and also have arrangement palettes for metatiling levels? Hmm.... > The concept of tile subdivision levels for a given \"Tileset Layer\" would make loading these kinds of tiles into game engines (using native Aseprite files) much easier programmatically, since each tile in a single Tileset Layer could be assumed to have a certain number of subdivision levels (3), and these could then be linked data-wise\nI think instead of tile subdivision levels it will be better to have arbitrary number of tile meta levels with separate meta-tileset for each level based on previous level tileset, ability to export any meta-tileset and any meta-level tilemap, work with meta-tileset and meta-tilemap (by selecting current meta-level) and (yes) allow to 1) edit lowest level tiles to affect all meta-tiles, 2) edit meta-tiles by arranging lower level tiles and 3) option to duplicate any level tile with auto duplication of higher levels meta-tiles that was using that tile. And yes, when adding meta-level you can setup its multiplication factors from simplest 1x2, 2x1 or 2x2 tiles to anything like 8x8 and etc. as you need in your project.\nOf course this is advanced feature, let's call it METATILES and we can always add it atop of basic functionality.. @awesomez\n\nI know that's a lot to read, but it pretty much describes the whole system from start to finish. Let me know if I've missed something.\n\nYou should really show brief-but-complete graphical illustration (diagram) of wanted structure (what inside what and how edited). And write short description of it without supplementary details like controls/etc. (those could be read after structure was understood). Because it's really hard to fully understand what you want now.. @awesomez I think I finally quite understood first part of your descrption. It's a lot of redundant text there, but general idea is that you can edit canvas with parts of tileset images, with palette of those \"sub-tiles\" automatically reduced to remove duplicates, so it's easier to grab them and place them anywhere you want. Right?\nIf right that could be implemented vice versa, with smallest 4x4 tiles being basic tile size and 8x8 and 16x16 (and more) being meta-levels in that you can grab/place whole meta-tiles with or without palette of them, but then switch to smaller level and work there too. In essence it's just copying groups of smallest tiles and placing them grouped with some automatic assistance And this approach is compatible with overlapping tiles (at lowest for example 4x4 level, only if you want them to overlap). Of course you'll need export meta-tilemap operation, but it's just operation that automates export of meta-tiles-based tilemap, while Tilemap Layer itself will not contain any meta-levels, just simple tilemap of 4x4 tiles. Cool?. @dacap But composition of different sizes could be easily done with several Tilemap Layers, 16x16 as bkg, 8x8 over it and 4x4 over 8x8. The only thing will be images sharing between those layers. But it could be done with right exporter options (export from several layers as meta-tiles). Except for transparency override, yup.... @dacap Could you comment on options below?\nExternal tileset option A: external image or .ase/.gif file with sprite sheet split to tiles with Tilemap Layer tile width and  height (no overlapped tiles, animated tiles possible) <-- overlapped tiles also possible if extra params provided (width and height of tile area and x/y of tile origin)\nExternal tileset option B: external .ase/.gif file with frames used as tiles and optionally tile rect taken from slice  (allows overlapped tiles) <-- meta-tiles friendly because of same Tilemap Layer inside external tileset could be used to arrange different patterns, also layered tiles possible (flattened on being imported for render)\nExternal tileset option C: external .ase file with layers used as tiles and optionally tile rect taken from slice (allows animated overlapped tiles in cost of many layers) <- still meta-tiles friendly with many more possibilities (and problems)\nExternal tileset option D: external .ase file with selected Tilemap Layer tileset (how to index layer reliably?) <-- not very good? also no overlapped or animated tiles, better just export it and use options A-C\nMore options possble? Could all of these be supported? (in Tilemap Layer props by selecting type of tileset: internal / external sheet / external frames / external layers )\nAlso: animated tiles != animated tilemap, both could be useful \nAlso: it's really safer to allow to press \"Update tileset\" manually for external tilesets and maybe provide \"Try update dynamically (on open/traced changes)\" checkbox than to always reload them dynamically. And this will let us generally keep all imported tileset data inside .ase file both for internal and external tilesets. And provide another checkbox \"Don't store external tileset data\" for optimized usages (will force dynamic import on open).. ",

Ableton Live uses Skin, Hue, Brightness and Saturation \"easy\" setup. \nThe Hue can be used to create different theme (skin) colors for buttons etc on the fly.\n\n. Here is the system in action. \n\n\nUsing licecap btw on osx \ud83d\ude04 \n. interesting.\n. i want to avoid duplication so i want something like the first option. (actually i didn't know you can define more than one tag. i guess when i did that they overlapped).\nso let's say i have a windmill (frames 1-5) and a flock of birds (frames 1-10). when i press the play button in the preview window i want to see this:\n- the windmill animation plays to its end, the flock animation goes through its first 5 frames,\n- the windmill animation goes back to its first frame, the flock animation goes to its 6th frame,\n- both animations play to their end and go back to the start,\n- and so on...\n. here's a rough idea i wanted to share:\n- the timeline widget contains tabs corresponding to different frame tags. each tab displays the same timeline but differently.\n- you start with a default tab corresponding to the animation that's gonna play when you press Enter.\n- then you select some cells on one or more layers (or frames if you're selecting from all the layers) and press F2 to create a new frame tag. this will create a new tab for that tag.\n- on each tab created this way all unrelated cells and layers are greyed out.\n- on the default tab all the cells that belong to a frame tag are (possibly) colorcoded and trying to change them causes a switch to the corresponding tab. since all the tabs display the same timeline the switch shouldn't be too disorienting.\n- ultimately as you move all separate animations into individual tabs the default tab becomes a map of your entire composite animation.\nagain, this is a very rough idea but i hope it makes it easier to create the kind of composite animation i described in #767. \n. i think the buttons should go in this order:\n```\nImport\nExport\nReset\n\nCancel\nOk\n```\n. another variant\n\n.

Thanks @dacap! :smile:\n. @Async0x42 a preview box would be fine for visual feedback but you still need to adjust the axis with enough accuracy - for that you need to zoom in.\n\nalternatively the snap modes could be mapped to mouse buttons:\n- the left one snaps to pixel borders,\n- the right one to their centers.\nyou only need to add a tooltip describing this to axis handles\n. this might be related then:\nwhen you select something in no-symmetry mode and then switch to a symmetry mode and move the selection, the corresponding pixels on the other side of the axis don't move.\n. when there are several symmetrical objects on the canvas and they all have different symmetries it might be reasonable to put each on a separate layer and associate the corresponding symmetry mode and axis position with that layer.\n@ArekX there's also radial symmetry.\n. maybe the numbers should also be right-aligned. so that they're always right next to the suffix.\n. yep, feel free to close this one.\n. @oceanhahn i'm not sure about collapsing the tag area - tags/animations are of the same importance as layers. they are the third dimension, after layers and frames.\nmaybe if the tag area grows too big let the user collapse it into a selector (a dropdown list?). i need to reflect on this some more.\n. that's an interesting idea about [Tab]. +[Tab] could be used to toggle the state of the tag area.\nwhen overlapping tags are collapsed into a single row they look really messy when not colorcoded. what makes it worse is that you can't click on an overlapped tag to bring it to the foreground.\nmaybe when two overlapping tags start on the same frame, when you click on the foreground one the tag area is temporarily expanded to let you select the right tag. also such tags that cover other tags could be marked somehow e.g. the shadowed tags could stick out from behind them by a couple of pixels.\n. this is how tags could work wrt clicking (disregarding overlapping issues):\n- when you left-click a tag it is marked as current. this is roughly equivalent to selecting its frames and pressing . if you left-click it again the mark is removed.\n- when you right-click a tag a dialog with its properties is brought up.\nwhen a tag is selected as current you can delete it with .\n. I still experience lag from cursor movement on OSX 10.10.5 with v1.1.9.\n. Yep that helps thanks! Perhaps that should be a default setting on the mac.\n.

Solution 'Aseprite' > aseprite > Properties > Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies (open dropdown) > Edit > Add dxguid.lib\nThat's my solution\n. Actually, sorry about this. Was reading #1087, had same problem. Nevermind.\n. I noticed that too. I am using 1.1.4.0 and not the latest. For me it leaves pieces of the cursor like a trail of little dots or lines. It goes away after a while , however. I am not sure how this is triggered or how it goes away. \n. @dacap It simply crashes to desktop without a crash report pretty odd. I am currently recompiling from repo code instead of last release + investigating why no crash report perhaps reporting was disabled on my system. I will post here when I find out more.\n. @dacap I have compiled the code from the repo and tried to run it and same issue. \n\nI had my crash reporting disabled . Re-enabled it and here is what it says\nhttp://pastebin.com/3eJy2K77\n. @dacap oh .. I think I know what the problem is\n. @dacap  works ! You were right . I did not copy data correctly. Sorry about the trouble.\n. @dacap What happened was my ~/.config folder was changed to a file by something. I have to figure it out. So aseprite was not able to create ~/.config/aseprite folder for it's settings.  Is not really a bug as much as is  this unique situation should be documented in Q & A for other users. \nI am on OSX\n. Thank you @dacap . \n. Not sure how this is related, but I got a similiar effect:\nThe OS is Windows 10 too and I am also using the german keyboard layout.\nAfter some time (was not able to reproduce the exact moment yet) all keys stop working here. Built it myselft on the master yesterday (1.1.9-dev, with allegro).\nSo even bindings like \"b\" for the pencil tool can not be used anymore. \n. I am on GNU+Linux, and I built HEAD today with default cmake options. I updated from the 1.1.3 tag today, which also had the same issue for me.\n. @dacap\n\nOpen Folder from themes  still pointing to .config \ud83d\ude06 \nRegardless thank you for this \ud83d\udc4d  I was having issues with my brew update messing up config on every update now it should be perfect. \n. @dacap  \ud83d\ude04 Yeah! I admit it \ud83d\ude06  \nI like you idea  even better actually. Screen animation capture straight to new blank project with anim frames already set up one frame for each frame in the anim as bg overlay you can draw on top of. \nBtw i use licecap on osx and is fantastic. \nYou could also import gif anims to new anim project as  background and use another program to make screen caps but is not very easy to find programs to do screen capture. I think there is nothing for linux  atm for ex.\n. Usually [ and ]are used to change brush size on the fly in most programs. Sometimes even 1 ... 0\n. @dacap I actually had that mouse problem earlier, which is why I compiled it. Now it doesn't drift or slide but just has really low fps and looks choppy, so I think it's a different problem. To add to this, switching tabs and opening menus seems very smooth, its just the mouse pointer.\nI'll have to wait for the skia-backend for Linux to fix the other one. \n. I deff support this.\n. This is such a core feature, I was surprised it wasn't already implemented. As is, I have to export my sprites, color adjust them, then import them whenever I find the colors are just a bit too bright or the colors are collectively off from what I'm going for. It can be time consuming, but not nearly as time consuming as replacing all the pixels one color at a time on a large project in Aseprite alone.\nThis is basically the one feature that's preventing me from fully embracing Aseprite and what put me on the fence about getting it at first.\nWhen implemented, would be nice if you could adjust layer by layer or every layer.. @oceanhahn Glad is not just me :D I don't think there is any 2d image editor that allows you to comment part of a 2d image. IF this is implemented this would be the first program to do this.\n. @dacap I think easiest way to implement this specific system an array of user data objects each one having notes and an x y relative to grid cell location. But if you wanna implement the other system with slices I don't know you need multiple grid systems.\n. You know better :D \n. For the slices one simple idea that comes to mind is simply have  the slices as well as their grids based on the main grid. You select  select multiple cells/grids and turn them into a slice then you can subdivide them into _0.25 0.5 1_ 2  *4 (etc) of the main grid . Of course other multiples even entered by hand could work. This way you can build tileset pieces   based on your main tileset specs.\n. Edit: then you overlay the slieces in like a 2 pass system ON top of your drawing canvas.  Then when you manipualte the canvas and your mouse is over a sliece then you grab your data from the slice rather than from the canvas.\n. Yup, exactly like that @dacap.\nSorry for making a thread about the same suggestion then.\n. ",

It seems that only filling the grid-tile when the grid is visible can be bewildering if you're on a 1x1 grid, especially using the app for the first time.

    "Async0x42": "While I haven't run into this issue before since I didn't use the grid yet, I can agree that this would've been really confusing on a small grid without reading this first, an option somewhere would be good, with a way to inform the user if the option isn't in an obvious place when selecting the grid/bucket\n. Same issue here, googling a few different things finally led me to this answer. Perhaps there should be some sort of UI info describing this in the application? Now that I know, it won't trouble me, but perhaps useful for any new users who aren't familiar with indexed palettes.\n. RGB as the default was the expected behavior for me at least, when I first used Aseprite, though it was nice to learn about indexed colors and I could see it being useful for certain situations! I definitely like having Indexed Colors there as an option.\nI like the idea of making the bottom color bar/palette show as transparent when selected. When I was confused about why the first color was never drawing, I looked a few times at the selection bar in the bottom-left to see if it was transparent, and it wasn't, so I was totally lost.\n. Graying and/or disabling would be good, at least then you know those options exist\n. Oh thanks, this can be closed then. I was looking in the documentation about this and didn't see it, that tooltip slipped my mind since I only checked the option my first time launching Aseprite.\n. Somewhat related to this I think, but it'd be great to select a range of cells, right click, and choose \"link these cells\", and it'll link them all based on the first cell. I like the linking system, but linking it frame by frame for an existing animation feels clunky since there's no bulk way to do this.\nAlso, for the hot keys mentioned above, could they also be placed in the right click context menu on the cell? (Copy cell linked to next frame, copy cell unlinked to next frame). Hot keys are great at times, but context menus should reflect available actions I think.\n. New option works great, thanks! Looking forward to more commands being added to the context menus if they fit in (Glad I switched from the betas to compiling it, the new features are really nice!)\nMy opinion for the new command referenced above, how about \"Duplicate Cell Block\" (and maybe renaming the old ones to Duplicate Cell? Idea, maybe not best though). When you say 'copy' it sounds to me like you'll be manually pasting it (inserting) wherever, but duplicate cell block sounds like it'll happen immediately.\nThinking on that a bit more, is there a need for separate commands? I think ideally, if you have a block range of cells selected and call the command, it should duplicate the range, but if you have a single cell selected, and call the same command, it should duplicate just that cell.\n. Both of those command names look good to me at least (though duplicate cells or duplicate cell block for multiple)\nAbout the separate commands, I think I misunderstood @dacap when he said rename the old function. A separate command for duplicating LINKED vs unlinked, I totally agree with!\nI had thought the intention was to have a command for duplicating a single cell, and have a totally separate command for duplicating multiple cells. I had meant those two functions should be merged, not linked vs unlinked though.\nEdit: Slow typing on my phone to reply, you got here before I submitted @dacap, thanks for clearing that up, I definitely misunderstood the earlier post!\n. This would be great, I often find myself drawing lines on a separate layer to help with drawing things.\n. Looks great for both indexed and rgb! (What do you use for recording Aseprite and then to a gif by the way?)\n. Maybe a right-click \"insert empty palette cell\" and \"remove cell from palette\" in the context menu?\n. Ah right, that makes sense not to need a remap when switching to indexed.\nIf you reduce the palette size while in indexed, the remap shows, but if you then CTRL+Z to undo the palette change, the Remap button still exists, even though the undo made it so there was no palette change. (as seen in the original post gif)\nEdit: Oops, I should have read my original post again, as I thought it applied to this, I'll create a new issue since it's similar but actually a different bug from what I wrote in the description for this one. (https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/783)\n. If the COM way would allow non-windows platforms via mono, I think that'd be a good bet to open up plugin development to a wider variety of developers (C#), but it may not be good if it restricts the feature to a specific platform.\n. This last image looks good, with OK and Cancel on the bottom of the dialog\n. Both are good, but I think this one causes a little too much white-space in the left box (since it's unlikely to be filled with categories I think), and the buttons being lower the the main list box causes the Reset button to draw my eye to it too much, so I prefer dacaps version. I'm not an artist though, just my personal thought!\n. That makes sense, and an animation to zoom in or out sounds like it'd solve the issue well.\n. I think an option to autozoom in the settings would be best, it's not likely an option people will change often, so better not clutter the new image dialog.\nThen, if enabled, has a zoom in or out effect (depending on image size), like dacap mentioned earlier.\nWhether the option is enabled or disabled by default, I think should be based on whichever @dacap thinks the more-common case for users would be (it's just a checkbox for me, so doesn't matter)\n. The tool snapping at both the pixel and half pixel sounds the most intuitive to me, without adding more options and cluttering things.\nWould there be a way to have a small zoomed in preview box, showing a range of pixels around the the splitter while adjusting it? Then you can avoid the user zooming in, first, to do half pixels.\n. Just for further input, I actually ran into the same issue yesterday and was confused, expecting the selection to persist through deletes\n. I think that'd be a good solution\n. Actually, to me this'd be a nice little feature as well. I use Notepad++ and it's really convenient.\n. I think these are really clear as to the function of them. Personally, I think the second one might be better than the first, the first one the 3 slider rectangles might stick out a little too much because of that colour (or maybe they just need to be a px or two less in height), but it could just be me (and I'm not totally sure I like #2 more than #1!)\n. This also happens to me on Windows 10, however I noticed it in the keyboard shortcuts list\n. ",

I'll report back when I have time to test the new build extensively and see if the problem still occurs.\n.

However, I wasn't suggesting this in relation to brushes. I was thinking that this would be more for various other actions and menus. For instance, say one wished they had buttons on the screen for both rotate cw and rotate ccw. First they would draw up two buttons to represent those actions, they would then place those images on the theoretical \"custom button sprite sheet\", which could be called \"sheet2.png\" or what not. They could then open the custom button menu where they could be prompted to create a shortcut button or a macro button. In this case they would click shortcut, after which they would be redirected to the keyboard shortcuts  menu. They would select rotate cw from the list where they could then be brought to a window where the sprite sheet would be displayed and they could select the image they created for the button. That button could then be placed in a designated custom button docker located where the user would like it. Though, that could only happen after the docker business is sorted out. This sort of thing would be great for people who aren't into keyboard shortcuts or those who don't have access to one on their tablet. I was just throwing it out there for consideration but it's not something I would expect to see anytime soon, if at all. In any case, I appreciate your quick response good sir.

As @nodeus mentioned RETRO-X, it would be very nice and useful to have limitations like the Commodore 64 multicolor mode as Aseprite already has a 2:1 pixel ratio.\nSo in this mode, we not only have this ratio but also a limitation of 4 different colors in an area of 8x8 pixel (a char) and only one of the 16 colors the C64 provide. \nEditors like \"Project One\" (http://csdb.dk/release/?id=86776) or Timanthes (http://csdb.dk/release/?id=75871) have these limitations.

Going to come in handy for rotoscoping and such I'm actually really excited to start working on stuff with this.. Would be /really/ nice to be able to rotate the reference image, too!. Hey just dropping in to say I'd be really interested to see this, too!. Hey! Wanted to update to say I'm still really hoping for a system like this. Gonna provide a usecase just to keep the thread active :).\n\nIn this project here, I've got a room I'm making and I'd love to create my 32x32 carpet tiles in another .ase file/project to keep things clean, so I do!\n\nSo I've got my carpet designed now, and I copy and paste the tiles into my room.ase scene. But oh no! It doesn't look exactly how I'd like it to, so I'm gonna go back into my carpet.ase file, edit it, but now I have to go through the process of copy and pasting it all over again.\nI'm not sure, the idea I'm thinking of is sort of like how you can bring illustrator files into photoshop, change the illustrator file, save it, and it auto updates in the photoshop file. Some sort of dynamic link type thing.\nThis could also be solved with some sort of comp'ing type functionality like After Effects. Instead of seperate project files you \"comp\" layers together (into what's basically a folder). The trick is though that the folder acts like it's own internal seperate project file, then you're able to instance that comp as many times as you want (just copy and paste, they all stay linked). You have the option to resize the comp and all that type of stuff.\nTell me what you think, tbh a dynamic link type of thing between .ase files where you import one into current project, change the imported one and save it, then go back into your main project and find it automatically updated would be fantastic.\nComp'ing is another way to achieve the end product that I'm looking for as well since I'm mostly looking to edit a collection of layers independently, then looking to instance that collection of layers multiple times across the background to make my carpet. Then if I make a change to the root comp/project file it'll reflect that change in all instances on the canvas.\nTell me what you think, my lifes a lil' hectic right now, but I'm open to contributing if you can even point me in the right direction (resources or even just where we might look at implementing such a feature in the source).\nAppreciate your time dacap, thank you!\nEDIT: I'd say Dio seems like a good place to start, but I'm even thinking another Level 3 (3.5 since it actually depends on Level 3 components? haha) component to keep things decoupled that utilizes Dio could be a good idea..

    "bfloch": "That answers my question. I was under the impression using a palette was the problem but this seems to be more logical.\n. The color picker action is great. However as you mentioned without the saturation the color wheel is pretty much unusable.\nThe issue I am facing with the Tint/Shade/Tone picker that the hue selection is not granular enough. I'd have to make the selector big which takes valuable space from the canvas.\nProposing to either make the hue bar vertical or even better allow for a modifier that adds more fine grained selection. This is how Blackmagic Design Fusion does it:\nWhen on a slider or similar and you hold shift the drag selection goes in to precision mode, meaning that it follows the mouse only to a fraction (1/10th?) of the rate.\nI also second the alpha request. I could also live with something photoshop-ish like Shift+1-0 being alpha 10% to 100%.\n. If that is the place for discussing it: Yes, I would be in favor of having the CLI a bit reworked simply because so far the interface rarely does what I expect it to do.\nIn case you use the internal json and workflow it might be ok - but if you want to pass your work to something like texture packer and are only interested in automation of the workflows with the CLI it is quite counter-intuitive.\nHere is the use case that I am interested in:\n- Have an .ase represent the animation for a particular character. Suppose player.ase\n- The character has multiple layers and each animation cycle is represented by a tag.\n  So far so good.\n  Now I want with the help of the CLI either\n- Export merged layers for each tag mirrored in the file name: player_tag_001.png ...\n- Export split layers for each tag mirrored in the filename: player_layer_tag_001.png\nUltimately this would be what I want to do as this can be easily send to other external tools, as opposed to using the spritesheet and json data - and as I understand this should be the reason for having a CLI at the first place.\n. Probably related: Neither --frame-tag nor --frame-range seem to work when there is only one frame per tag.\naseprite --batch sogfont_v002.ase --frame-tag \"P\" --frame-range 41,41 --filename-format P_0000.{extension} --layer _CROPBOX --save-as output.png\nThis will still export the hole frame range. So my workaround of reading the data and exporting per tag does not work in this case :-/\n. Best workaround I found is to add an empty frame for each one frame tag and delete it afterwards.\n. ",

Have you started working on this bug?\nI'm interested in this and would like to give this a try :)\n. I think adding a new interface to app::FileFormat for checking specified file header would be one of the proper solution, what do you think @dacap?\n. Have you installed pacakge libharfbuzz in your system?\n. My bad, the package you miss is harfbuzz-icu, you can check if you've installed first.\n. Another possible problem is that pkg-config can't find out the corresponded .pc files. You can try pkg-config --list-all | grep harfbuzz to see if pkg-config works without problem, here's my output:\nshell\n$ pkg-config --list-all | grep harfbuzz\nharfbuzz                    harfbuzz - HarfBuzz text shaping library\nharfbuzz-icu                harfbuzz - HarfBuzz text shaping library ICU integration\nharfbuzz-gobject            harfbuzz - HarfBuzz text shaping library GObject integration\nTo fix this (if this is what you need), simply run export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=SOME_WHERE. In my case (Ubuntu 14.04), I set this value to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:/usr/share/pkgconfig. Or you could find where the .pc file located in your box and use that value.\nHope this would work for you :)\n. Hi, @jpnk\nCould you help me checking if this problem still exist? If so, could you please describe how to reproduce. Thanks :)\n. I gave this a try. The logical part is quite simple (2537b76cda1b76e7e94), but unexpected behaviour from app::Editor::setEditorScroll stuck with me.\n\nThis is what we'll get If we do scrolling via app::Editor::setEditorScroll with argument blitValidRegion as true (I guess this is for performance optimization). Since I'm still not familiar with the architecture and design of aseprite, I think I'll need your advice to solve this, @dacap.\nBtw, this glitch happened if we scroll by:\n- Drag with mouse middle button\n- Hand tool\n- Space + ArrayKey shortcut\nnot happened by:\n- drag the scroll bars of editor view (because it call ui::View::setViewScroll directly)\n. Thanks for your help, @dacap. I'll take a look inside your commit and see what's going on exactly.\n. Btw, do we suppose to use app::Transaction.execute(CMD) rather than app::DocumentApi? (as the comment in src/app/document_api.h said)\nIf so, I think I could fix the minor problem in these files as well and prevent using app::DocumentApi in the future patch.\n. I just found that we can pass parameters to commands :P \nSolution which uses user-defined flag should be better than current one, since lots of duplicated code exist now.\n. I'm not a professional digital artist but I think during working I'll need both goto next frame and goto next frame with same tag as well and might use them frequently. As my opinion, these two commands should be available at the same time. Defined their behaviour with global preference looks not very reasonable to me.\nWhat do you think?\n. Wait! The tag bug is still there!\n. I think it a good start looking at resource_finder.cpp. The problem you found might be caused by different directory tree naming or the implementation of finding/reading file by aseprite.\n. Always a pleasure :)\n. Looks more clear to me :)\n. This might relate to #894.\nCurrently, --frame-tag only affects argument --data and --sheet. As I know --save-as and --sheet perform totally separated actions. (you can use them the same time to get sprite sheet and images for each frames)\nMaybe we can redesign these arguments and commands to make batch actions more intuitive and easy-to-use, like aseprite info --layers --tags or aseprite export --sheet -o XXX.png?\n. I believe CoreModules makes dependency relation more clear, at least to me. Otherwise it would be hard to find out which module should be created first without digging into lots of codes.\nIs this your original idea about creating CoreModuls? And do you think keeping CoreModules would be a good idea?\n. Do you mean after the project features are completed, we could set ouput preference (e.g. output format and commands to run) for entire project and use only aseprite --batch xxx.aseproject to perform it?\n. I think the is caused by casting from double to integer without round (or some have but the others aren't).\n. Always a pleasure!

Various dither patterns would make good presets for this.\nI'd like it if I could choose to apply dithering (either Floyd-Steinberg, Error-Diffusion or Pattern) when converting from RGB to a palette mode.\nYour paletted 'blur' tool is great, but it would be even greater if you could ask it to use pattern dithering to blur edges, treating dithers between two colors as a midpoint-color.\n.

Adding #include \"limits.h\" should suffice.\n. Found one of the problems:\nThere are two files in the \"base\" directory named string.h and time.h, which interfere with the includes of cstring and fnctl.h. A solution is to rename string.h and time.h to string.hpp and time.hpp, and changing all instances of the reference to them to their hpp form.\nYup, that's the cause of our sorrows. The simple rename touchup works.\nI'm preparing a patch, I'll post it when I am done.\n. Yes, I was getting errors about strstr, memcpy, and various string.h (and thus cstring) methods not being declared. Turns out that, at least for me,  was including \"base/string.h\" rather than the system's \"string.h\", due to include paths.\nI'm on an Ubuntu 13.10, using gcc version 4.8.2.\n. The files that are affected are:\n- signal.h -> signal.hpp (wait.h)\n- time.h -> time.hpp (fnctl.h)\n- string.h -> string.hpp (cstring)\n. Maybe implement a scrolling headbar, similar to how Firefox 30~40 (guessing around here) and Eclipse Luna do it: Each tab has a uniform size, and there are arrows on either side of the menu to shift the tab heads, in addition to a drop-down menu to move around quickly.\n. Add some kind of checksum into the .undo file: maybe the format can look like\nUNDO |Version Stuff| |Stuff you don't want checksumed| |Checksum| |Content|\nIf the checksum matches only the content, we have a valid file. If the checksum doesn't match, we have an corrupt file, and if it matches, but the data is messed up, we know it's tampered with.\n. \"Set loop section\" is an alias for creating a tag named \"Loop\" by default over the set of frames selected. Your loop is encoded under \"frameTags\" as \"run\":\n{  \n  \"name\":\"run\",\n  \"from\":4,\n  \"to\":7,\n  \"direction\":\"forward\"\n}\n\nThis is your loop. It's just that the software takes a loop and stores it as a \"tag\".. Oddly enough, the problem disappears (so far) when using the beta version 6dc2b5284ec3ebd8066f0e1cfb5ec53b1290c6db, but maybe because it's at the edge, and there are no newer versions than it.\n. The problem is that I literally had just pulled it yesterday. And the same problem appears in the beta if I edit config.h's VERSION constant from \"1.2-dev\" to \"1.1.10-dev\". Nothing's been fixed, just hidden.. Interesting thing: If you ctrl-Z that, the original segment (from point 1 to 2, the one that was originally ctrl-Z'd) appears.\nVideo speaks louder:\n. Went to the menu, turned it off, opened a new sprite, tried it again, the same thing happened. The original line doesn't reappear, though, so it may be that non-linear history is keeping all the branching, but not the information of each history.\ntc;dr: The pencil tool is keeping the last point it was used at to make a line with Shift, even though it was removed by an undo. The expected behavior is to start from point 3 to create the line, but it instead starts from point 2. Non-linear history may or may not deal with this, but without non-linear history, the previous line doesn't appear.. This may call for a reopening of #1345, or something, but I felt that #1352 was thrown out too quickly, and I couldn't signify that, other than by doing this.. Ok. Thank you.. How about extending the idea into more of a form-like manner, where maybe something like a checklist of items are shown, with the user able to select which frames to use? It solves your problem without resulting in a confusing option labeled \"No\". Or just add the button, but give it a more descriptive name, like \"Current frame\" or such.\nTell me if I'm out of line. I don't really know how to hold code discussions. If this issue has been resolved, could you please close this issue, @Bohjo? It's just a bit of housekeeping, and helps clear out resolved issues from the open list.. @bilgekaan If you want it closed, you can. Just scroll to the bottom, and click \"Comment and Close\".. This issue doesn't appear in v.1.2-beta7 (the latest beta).. v.1.1.13 recently came out, so update, and try it again, unless you really want to use v.1.1.12.. yey!. ",

There's no doubt about that.\n  Everyone's time is valuable.  This was me trying to make a point, so no.  I\n  don't think that at all.\n- Do you really think modifying a couple of lines in some scripts worth\n  something?\n  I do.  It's tiny compared to the work you've done, but it's still a couple\n  lines of scripting that involved troubleshooting and learning to achieve.\n- Do you think you can give customer support, add new features, and fixing\n  bugs?\n  I do it for a living, so yes?\n- Do you really think that the whole point of a product is just the\n  \"compiling\" process?\n  No.  I guess it baffles me that not more people use Visual Studio for\n  compiling.  I could just use the visual C compiler from the command line,\n  but I don't see the value in it.  I'd have to create a build script, which\n  I've done before (vcvars and cl and all that), but my main platform is\n  Windows so I haven't found a need to yet.\nI also tried cmake from the command line (first thing I did next), and it\ndidn't work.  I don't know why it would work for you.  CMake from command\nline still uses the same CMakeList scripts, doesn't it?\nI am a programmer, despite what you think.

I even went as far as making sure my suggested changes\ndid not change any 3rd-party libraries (which only a programmer should know\nnot to do).  You'd have probably gotten something vague or a question\nlacking important details, but I know what it's like to get a bug report\nthat only says: \"It's broken, and not working, fix it!\".  I didn't want to\ndo that.  In fact, if I knew how to contribute directly on github, I\nmight've just done that instead.  But I wanted to make a point as well (I'm\nsorry for that), and obviously you would've discovered something this small\neventually anyway.\nI'm going to donate anyway.  I was thinking about it all day yesterday.  I\nthink you deserve it, especially for reading my post and replying with all\nthis (thank you).\nWhat strikes me as \"unethical\" is that you're not actually selling\nanything.  You're just selling a different format of information, an extra\nstep in the development lifecycle.  I can appreciate you want to make\nsomething for your time - heck I make a worthless sum at my current job,\nwhich is why I'm considering a different career.  I mean it could be worse,\nyou could force an annoying popup in the program, or lock the program down\nafter 30 days, but that's cheap and rude to end users.  But it's also\nsomething that targets artists, whom most would probably not be capable of\ngoing through the process I have.  I know what I've said probably bothers\nyou since you've dedicated such a large amount of time to this project, and\nI have no other alternative I could suggest for earning something for it\nall.

    "KashouC": "Just wanted to add the \"Export\" dialogue as another area where this would be useful. I assume that is the intention but since \"Export\" was only added long after 2015 it might be worth clarifying.. I just want to re-iterate on this issue to please not remove the way it works right now, but add another mode, because I need it to work like it does.\nHowever I would also like seeing it working just like a regular brush as well in addition to the current functionality, as in only incrementing the colors each step per click.. Actually, this is only true while the marquee tool is currently selected and a selection is made. It disables changing layers with hotkeys.\n. I think this is my most common issue still. It's in the way constantly and makes the work flow terribly clunky when working with multiple layers and selections.. As a work-around for those (like me) who had issues with this, you can edit the key bindings file in C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Appdata\\Roaming\\Aseprite\\user.aseprite-keys with Wordpad or Notepad.\nSimply remove the \"Context = \"Normal\" part of the relevant lines, which will make the keybinding always trigger.\nReplace:\n    <key command=\"GotoNextLayer\" Context =\"Normal\" shortcut=\"Up\"  removed=\"true\" />\n    <key command=\"GotoNextLayer\" Context =\"Normal\" shortcut=\"W\" />\n     (The second line and the \"removed\" part only appears if you've changed the default hotkey.)\n\nWith:\n    <key command=\"GotoNextLayer\" shortcut=\"Up\"  removed=\"true\" />\n    <key command=\"GotoNextLayer\" shortcut=\"W\"  />\n    (Same logic applies here.)\n\nThen do the same thing with GotoPreviousLayer, and enjoy unshackled movement while there's a selection.\n. Actually now that I posted the bug report it got saved... I'll get back to you. It might just be the settings saved from before, but it's weird that the \"new document\" settings get reset.. Yeah, I dunno. It works fine now even after a reboot. All I know is that I've had to re-set the settings in the new tab like 8 times the last 3 days.. This isn't something I tend to do as Steam doesn't even launch a new window if you accidentally launch Aseprite again, and this bug keeps reappearing over and over again. I'll try to delete all the file settings in Roaming and see if it stops. Maybe there was something residual from an older version or something.. Oh yes, I know, the minor difference is that I'd like to zoom in towards the mouse but zoom out from the center, both with the wheel, so a mixed setting or just drop down boxes with behaviour for zooming in and out or something, but like I said, very minor.. Thanks.. And in addition it doesn't have the behavior that at least I would expect when you're using larger brush sizes.\nI hope this image explains it properly enough: \nExample.\nFirst line is the line tool behaving correctly, second is with a bigger brush and it does not do what I want it to, and 3 is how it should be IMO.. It's always more difficult than it seems isn't it? Honestly, I'm not sure. I can see both cases being preferable to someone so I guess it's whatever. I'm sure I was just annoyed at it not fitting my specific use-case at the time. :wink: \nThe diagonal line would probably have to be like that. I don't see any other way to do it regardless.. Yeah, I got this as well with Windows 7 x64 on Steam.. I fixed it by editing the default key binds in the GUI file, but while this should maybe be it's own seperate feature request, it would be nice if setting ellipse and ellipse fill to \"R\" for example would ALWAYS select ellipse first, so you know that you always get fill by pressing R twice, instead of having to check every time.. Yeah there are  a lot of different ways to do this, but you probably want it to be as intuitive as possible and not have to add a bunch of extra buttons and stuff so I'm not sure.\nPersonally I think it would be fine if it just depended on which tool comes first in the keybindings basically. Other options include adding a tab for multi-binds where you can select priority, being able to \"re-order\" the tools by dragging in the tool bar, adding some sort of order drop down menu behind the keybinding of binds that are bound to a key used by other tools. Problem is that all of these options are either arbitrary things you'd just have to know about, or overly invasive solutions.\nAlso for setting the same key binding on multiple tools or functions, it would be nice if the program prompted you when you tried to use an occupied key by asking to replace the other bind, keep it, or cancel.. That worked. Thanks.. It actually behaves this way when you use the keyboard shortcut instead of right clicking and picking properties. So might just be a minor bug.. I'll try that. I'm sure the power won't go out in my apartment while it's off or anything.\nGonna take a few days to test.. I'm still not any closer to understanding this bug, but I can tell you that it's not because of the auto-save at the very least. I have also since re-formatted my computer AGAIN so it's definitely not some weird virus in the background.. I'm convinced this bug isn't Aseprite related. It happens in GIMP as well. I can't figure it out though.. This is solved now isn't it?. Just found it when searching if my bug was already submitted. ^^ Figured I'd bump this thread so it could be closed.. That is correct! But even with dithering it would be useful to have a value that limits the amount of \"steps\" between.\nThe function is very useful for designing menus and such but it still has to fit with the rest of the graphics in a game where the palette is limited. Previously I had to do the gradients manually with the select tool and fill, so it's a good addition.. Thank you.. Works for me. The Curve Tool still has one extra click step for curving than making \"arcs\" would need though, if that's a problem.. Wouldn't just cutting (Ctrl+X) and creating a new layer (Shift+N) then pasting work?. What I mean is this. Imagine that one pixel is 5 px wide and high (let's assume it is zoomed in on the screen), so it goes from (1,1) to (5,5). If you begin your stroke from (5,5) it only needs to move one pixel to move over to the next cel. Because of this it's very easy for strokes to end up jittery and (what feels like randomly) move over to other cels a lot.\nThe suggestion is for an option to make the stroke always count as it's starting from (3,3) which is the middle of the pixel cel, even if the mouse is at (5,5), so from the beginning of your stroke you always need the same amount of movement horizontally or vertically for it to move to the next cel.. That's odd. Everything I do selection wise except Ctrl+A re-enables Selection Edges. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIvvpdcNggw\nMade a video to show what I mean just so we are on the same page. . Showing is easier than describing, especially when English is a second language for both of us. ^^\nYeah, I think that is the best solution.. Just wanted to confirm that this happens because of the reference layer when the zoom level is 1200%. No reference layer = no issue.. Ah, probably yeah. I checked for duplicates but couldn't find one searching for \"line tool\".. If possible I'd say all angles, so it just snaps them to \"perfect lines\", but if you need to add them all manually that sounds painful. I think it's a good enough start at least. :+1: . Oh, and maybe this should be it's own post but being able to just drag the tag edges to set start and end position would also be absolutely amazing.. Yeah just when you have one frame selected, you get the copy of it inserted after your current \"selection\" (technically is more like the focused frame I guess, but still), so if you have 4 frames selected when you press new frame, you'd get a copy of those 4 frames inserted after the last selected frame. Might wanna change it into New Frame(s) if you implement it this way I guess.. No, if I just make a new file in both 1.2.6 and in 1.2.7.3 and draw a bunch of lines with the pen, it's definitely slower in 1.2.7.3.\nBut like I said, it's not THAT much slower, but in bigger files I think it starts showing even more. The reason I'm making an issue out of it is that I thought that there's a chance it might be related to the other performance related issues, or just to nip it in the bud in case the issue snowballs for future versions.. Actually this isn't version related at all, but the speed of undoing is related to how big the palette side panel is. If you make it bigger the re-draw or whatever takes much longer, making it sluggish.. Oh wow, yeah, changing from the color wheel to the color spectrum was a huuuge boost in speed.. Yup, fast as lightning now! Good job.. I think this issue will be solved when tile stamping is implemented because you'll be able to paint out some test terrain for whatever autotile formations you need and then just edit the tiles and see it update in real time.. Check under version 1.6 for the tile map editor.\nhttps://www.aseprite.org/roadmap/. If this is what you are referring to, it's likely not a bug, and instead indicates that we're currently in copy mode for the move tool. If you hold Ctrl and then click and drag a selection, you will copy the contents of the selection and paste it where you let go of the mouse button.\n\n. Hi there, you can try this and see if it's a solution for you:\nhttps://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1652#issuecomment-377441600. Hmm, strange. Doesn't feel like something I would do, seeing as it seems you have to move the box completely outside of the canvas. But maybe it happens that I do, who knows.\nEither way, we'll just have to see if this was it, or if there's still something else lurking. Good job until further notice either way! :+1: . Not knowing the back end situation, seeing as I'd like to see the color tool windows have the timeline unlocked for better control when trying to edit multiple cels (it's annoying when maybe you want to pick colors from the middle frame in a selection but you're stuck with picking them from the end or beginning due to how selections work), I'd say maybe selecting multiple colors and opening up a color editing tool would lock in the currently selected color range and keep the timeline operable, if my previous suggestion is doable.. I don't think that sounds very intuitive, but I guess neither is my solution. Personally I'll still support my suggestion, as I feel like if you want to change a range of colors in the palette you'll pick those before you open up the tool, while in the timeline the issue is that you don't have proper control, so sometimes you simply can't select a color because it happens to not be present in the frame selection, while using the replace color tool.\nBut I also feel like each section could be a bit more self-contained. For example I don't think it matters much whether a color selection range lingers in the palette when you click within the canvas, as long as all that we're storing is the cel range and pressing the delete button when the canvas is active just deletes whatever is in the canvas, not the cel range. Kind of like how you can select cels 1-7 in the timeline and are still able to move the canvas around with mouse 3, and then if you press delete after that it deletes the current active cel, not the entire cel selection.\nThat way we could just be able to select a color range, select a timeline range, both while Replace Color or the Hue/Saturation windows are open, while still locking the canvas, if necessary.\nBut I'm sure this requires some overhauling, so not sure how difficult all this is to do in practice. ^^. Sounds good to me. Only addition I'd like to make (but I guess it's semi-off topic) is to be able to change frame without losing the selection. For example, lets say you have an 8 frame long animation, and you brightened it up a bit on one frame, but noticed that you did it on like frame 3 or something, it becomes really difficult to swap between frame 3 and 2 to pick the old color and pick the new color to change it all. Since you have to go to 3, pick the old color, go to 2, pick the new color, make a selection in the timeline, Ctrl+R, and repeat the entire process for every color. \nWorkaround is to add each color to the palette and change it via that, so it's doable, but this is just from the point of view of my workflow. ^^. (Started typing this out in Discord so just copying it over) But in regards to being able to change frames after a selection has been made in the timeline, maybe the selection could persist while we're only operating within the current selection, that way it would be simple to move between the frames, especially if we unlock the timeline while a color tool window is up. It would also make it easier to check a frame within the selection after lets say using the move tool to move the content of multiple frames without having to reselect them.\nThe main issue with this is if you select the entire timeline, you won't be able to deselect it without using the keyboard or painting something in the canvas or pressing some arbitrary button, but not sure that's a real issue.. I find the addition of Shift+Clicking a frame an acceptable solution to move between selected frames for sure. Only change I'd like to see is to be able to freely move between cels in the same fashion, simply to make it more intuitive. I find myself wanting to click the next cel instead of the frame number a lot and it just feels awkward, especially when you have to click the layer name to move down a cel which is like half the screen away from the frame sometimes. Now just having it unlocked with a color tool dialogue open would be good enough for me.\nI also don't think you can remove a frame from the selection in the same fashion that you can add them with Shift+Click.. It MIGHT be possible to do this with slices, but maybe not at the moment. I don't know how to use them but could be something you could look into, or someone with more knowledge could chime in.\nNot sure about the direction vector tbh, but it might be possible to use slices if you import directly from the .ase format, and simply use the slice as origin.. I don't know how exactly the reference layer works now, but I think it should basically just be another project underlayed (is that a word?) under the current one. So you get to pick the size of the reference layer when you create it, and can move it around and resize and zoom it freely etc while you've got the ref layer selected.\nBut I realize this is a lot of groundwork to ask for, so yeah, maybe this is a good start. ^^. Absolutely, but I guess I mean something more like relative size. So a 1x3 circle shows 1:3, and a 3x9 circle also shows 1:3, and a 30x90 circle also shows 1:3.. Could probably just skip figuring out a default hotkey for it as well and just implement the bind itself.. Probably.. Mmm, interesting. I'll check it out, when it's not 2 in the morning. My only issue with an ink is that I'd like to be able to keybind it directly, but now that I look it up it's entirely possible to do just that.. Yeah this is pretty much exactly what I had in mind. Not being able to change the brush size kind of leaves it barely useful though but it's very close.. I'm not arguing for or against this change, it doesn't matter to me and I understand the frustration of having to move all over the keyboard, I just wanted to suggest taking some time to remap the tools you use to the left side of the keyboard. The only time I ever have to move my hand is for Shift+U which is the hue/saturation adjustment tool.\nI even bound things like invert to 3, delete to 4 and increase/decrease brush to 1 and 2.\nThat said I'm sure a mode for this would be helpful too.. Ooh it works like that in replace mode. I always use it in add to selection mode, maybe it could be changed only there since it doesn't deselect with a click there anyway?. Haha, sounds great!. How exactly are you trying to add it to palette? It works just fine for me, with or without it as a keybind or clicking the ! box next to the color.. Oh, false alarm. I'm the one who removed the shift command from the keybinds because I kept accidentally making lines lmao. Never mind. ^^. Just wanted to add that the current solution I'm using works very well tbh. I just have hand tool (quick) on space and ctrl+space is zoom tool (quick) and I think that's the optimal solution for me atm, whether my original post here gets implemented or not. But I think it could still be a good option.. Just helped someone with this issue and it turned out that MinGW from Codeblocks was being used as the compiler for ninja which made the process fail. Uninstalling Codeblocks solved it.\nMy suggestion is just to add a small note in the install.md about it.. I also want to link this issue to https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1568 somewhat. The same issue causes issues elsewhere as well. For example using the ctrl modifier with the pen to get the move tool, to then CTRL+click a layer to go to that layer, almost always results in accidentally moving the layer when working with a tablet because of micro jitter.\nEDIT: Also let me accidentally close the issue. --. I just wanted to update this issue, because the problem is most likely _not with the pen being to jittery. It's likely something else, because clicking and dragging and opening DOES work to open the color picker box, and it feels completely random whether it works or not. I made a video to illustrate it a bit further.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n38SNsWKr7c. When the lock is \"unhinged\" the color of the selected index is edited via the palette editor (F4). Clicking the foreground or background colors in the bottom left will open the same interface.. This is pretty much what you said, but I think the current information that's shown when you mouse over a sprite should be shown at all times for the current active sprite UNLESS there's something else, like mousing over another inactive sprite or what not, that should be displayed.\nExcept mouse position of course since we won't always be mousing over anything. I don't think I have any opinions on any further additions like filename or not. It might get annoying because you won't know where to expect the selection size and sprite size values to show up for example. It can already be kind of hard to find which value is which at a glance because it varies in position so much.. Hmm, alright. Maybe that's helpful for people then. I can only speak from experience and it's always only in the way for me at least. Have to work around it a lot.. Yes. You need Skia to build it, not to run it.. It's strange. I think I'm getting better at it now but for a long time I had severe issues double clicking in menu's in Aseprite with the pen, it just wouldn't register, but getting the double click to work for the grid selection thing is way too easy (like an entire seconds window almost).. Could you perhaps link the timeout to the OS double click timeout so it's the same timing as opening files and such? Not sure how much of a hassle that is cross platform (I assume it is, usually is). But I dunno if that's the issue either so :woman_shrugging: . I think maybe detachable windows are on the bucket list now that we can actually do it? Along with being able to drag tabs over to a seperate window. Either way, the only real places I have problems with the pen UI wise is with sliders in general, including the brush size slider. Showing the numbers above the slider indicator while you're dragging would work too, like a little popup.. Hi there!\nThe Reference Layer currently implemented should work like what you're looking for.\nYou can even move and resize the reference layer using the move tool, which is kind of tricky to find on your own. But if you click and drag the bottom right corner of the reference layer you can resize it, but only with the move tool selected.\nHope it helps!\n\n. Are you certain you haven't saved them in C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Aseprite instead of in the steam folder? It worked for me when I saved them into Aseprite\\data\\palettes in install folder in the steam folder.. Might there be overlapping file names with different extensions?. Hi there. Make sure you are using the right mode with the selection tool. You might have accidentally switched it over to subtract or intersect mode. I use it in add mode but there's also replace which creates an entirely new selection every time you make one.\n\n. I don't know how it works on Ubuntu but on Windows you have to add double \"\"'s to the clang stuff. cc=\"\"clang\"\" cxx=\"\"clang++\"\"\nNot sure if that's what's referred to as escape characters here. I don't know much about this topic or Linux distros, but all I can find is people using single \" tags for the things that need it on Debian. cc=\"clang\". I've also seen the argument is_clang=true and using target_os as well but you'll have to test em out yourself and see, but unless they're in the instructions I doubt they would change anything since this seems to be a syntax error. \nAlso seen people use --args='args here' instead of \"args here\" in relation to debian so I guess that's something you could try but not sure it even matters lmao, but I had issues with simple stuff like spaces after the = so you never know. :man_shrugging: .. So I guess:\ngn gen out/Release --args=\"is_debug=false cc=\"clang\" cxx=\"clang++\" is_official_build=true skia_use_system_expat=false skia_use_system_icu=false skia_use_system_libjpeg_turbo=false skia_use_system_libpng=false skia_use_system_libwebp=false skia_use_system_zlib=false\"\nYou might need a target_cpu=\"x86\" or \"x64\" as well, at least that's what I did on Windows but like I said, what's a Linux?. I saw people talk about that now that you mention it, so maybe that's the way you have to do it. Not sure they'd bother with it otherwise.. If you got it to work properly I'd be interested in what you put in the args.gn file, if you don't mind.. Aight cool, thanks. Just trying to learn how it should be done. ^^\nI guess we can close this thread now if you successfully managed to compile it?. I came to report this. This is a new problem that I just noticed today. Undo has always refreshed the display after each undo step while holding down the hotkey before.\n\nThe 1.3dev version I compiled on the 5th of December works as it should.\nAlso I'm on Windows 7 for reference.. Yeah, you're right. That works.. This isn't exactly a bug as much as it might be a behavior that needs some adjusting.\nSee, when you load in the first file s1.png, Aseprite checks if there's additional files in the folder to load in as an animation, then if you press agree it will load them all in. But when you drag in all of them, it does it for s1.png, then when you click agree it loads in s1.png to s24.png, then it moves on to s2.png and checks the folder if there are files to load in that match that one, which is s2.png to s24.png. So it's checking for the animation for every file you dragged in.\nYou can solve this by just dragging in the s1.png file and it will ask if you want to load the rest.\nI think it could be good that Aseprite checked for if people dragged in all the files already or not when checking for files to avoid this.. You're probably using the non-linear undo setting. I have no idea how that works. Normal undo works the way you think it should so try turning that setting off.\n\n. If you pulled the master branch, 1.3-dev is correct. I guess it's because it's the in development version of 1.3 or something? I don't know the logic lol. \nYou have to go into the 1.2.9 tag to get that version I'd assume.. Mm well in that case I dunno. ^^ Maybe it shows 1.3 anyway, never tried it.. ",

    "todofueunmalentendido": "GRRRREAT!\nI think a good idea for a color selector would be using the color wheel and adding different ways of choosing/looking color harmonies. There is a software called Coolorus.\nhttp://www.coolorus.com/ They have this really simple way of color choosing, based in the color wheel idea.\nDeffinitively there should be a RYB and a RGB/CMYK color wheel.\n\nI've found out most color harmony/scheme theories are based in the RYB wheel, most computer software dont work with this wheel, but instead the RGB one. Would be really neat you could switch between wheels and maybe even find / invent new harmonies with them.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOVXP6ILtrM\nTheres also that triangular HSV representation thats pretty useful.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\nThats actually base ideas, I'll continue investigating other color wheels and ideas.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTSrdGKC6SA\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system\nHope this happens :)\n. Great! It looks really neat!\nI'm so sorry I don't know programming to help out. A friend in the studio we work said maybe he can help or give it a try. For starts, the RGB wheel works great. I think that what could help a lot is to add a RYB wheel, so you could use color theories from painting, into this. Both wheels are slightly different.\nI know for digital artists is easier understanding the RGB wheel, but having both wheels definitively expand the spectrum and possibilities. \nIt could be a great starting point to enhance the color choosing bars, so you could work inmediately with color harmonies. Complementary colors and such. Theres always this misunderstanding in colour harmonies between the RGB wheel and the RYB wheel, you could \"harmonize\" with both, but art has been using the RYB one for centuries, harmonizing their colors with it. Thats whay I think it's importante for digital tools to embrace or at least give the option to work with a RYB wheel, making digital tools a bit more familiar with analog painting (and art history)\nHere I can leave you some articles and stuff about how the RYB color wheel could be formed\n(and other nerdy discussions about colour) :)\nhttps://github.com/bahamas10/ryb/raw/gh-pages/assets/ryb.pdf\nhttp://bahamas10.github.io/ryb/about.html\nhttp://www.daveeddy.com/2014/07/01/red-yellow-and-blue/\nhttp://codepen.io/social_quotient/pen/ExgKG\nGracias hermano :)\n. Hi.\nFound some more info about a possible colour \"harmonizer\" investigating.\nAnyway this should be done in the RYB colour wheel (at least that is what most people and softwares do and recommend when we're talking bout colour harmonies). But here are the grade relations of colours, for every different harmony. It would be great ASE could show you the other colours that \"harmonize\" with the one you picked, in a desired colour harmony.\nWell...

Those kind of pickers are great, perfect for finding shades, tones and tints.

I've found the old backend executable and the issue persists with that as well, in case that information is helpful.. Looks like that is it. If I wait a couple seconds it works. Maybe disabling settings related to \"ignore touchpad movement while typing\" would fix it (in touchpad settings). I'll close this. Thanks.. OK I thought that might be the case. Thanks.. As for the solutions, neither of the two provided in that thread are for what I have, which might be actual Dell hardware rather than Alps or Elantech. Oh well, 'h'and hotkey works well enough!.

In theory this could mean that for a given animation you would be able to do basic hitbox tracking, but all slices are on the screen at once, which could get tricky to manage.\nif you have multiple animations in one file, this is also tricky because any slice introduced has to be available for the ENTIRE file, not just an animation clip, which can lead to really cluttered views. So yes it can, but i think there's a bit of a management game to be played here. ",
    "mdekrey": "This seems like a really useful feature to have for any 2D games; using dynamic hand locations, hitboxes and \"hurtboxes\", etc. based on the animation. While I'm extremely rusty on my C++, I'm considering tackling this one. Before I do, I want to share my thoughts and see if they're reasonable. There's two ways I can imagine this.\nAs an additional layer type. This would be a \"vector\" layer, similar to Photoshop's shape layers, that don't have Cels; instead, they'd have vector data specifying the hot regions (some of which could be 0 width and 0 height, being hot-spots) instead of an ImageRef. This could then be rendered as outlines of certain pixels when the visibility of the layer was on. It would also be exported separately as json-only data when the layer was selected to export on the CLI.\nAs additional data on each Cel. The hot-spots would work as a new set of properties on the cels, adding logic to handle them where cels are handled, but not much more. While this is probably the more straightforward approach, I believe it is worse as far as future extensibility and control for the end user.\nEither way, an additional tool would be added on the right side to interact with the hotspots, with changes to saving and loading documents, rendering, and exports to json. Are there other situations I should take into consideration?\nDoes adding a \"LayerHotspot\" object type sound like a good approach?\n. ",
    "mbStavola": "I see this is tagged for a later milestone, but has any work gone into this already? From just a cursory glance at the code, it seems that a slice already keeps track of what frame it belongs to. Is it just the editor and the export that needs to respect this information?. Ah nice!\nAnd just curious, are there plans to tie the slice to the frame that it was created for in the editor (or maybe that's possible currently and I'm missing something)? I'm basically just trying to use slices for hit/hurt boxes for my sprites, and it gets messy kinda quick. For example:\nHere we add some slices to this X sprite on frame 0:\n\nWhen we flip over to frame 1, the slices from the previous frame still display:\n\nI think that and not being able to duplicate slices are really the only hiccups.\nEDIT: \nAfter poking around the code some more, it seems like it's supposed to work as I want...?\n\n(editor.cpp)\nI'm not too sure what the semantics of getByFrame() are supposed to be, but it looks as though the intended behavior is to return a SliceKey if the Slice was tagged on that frame. It seems more appropriate to just filter the Slice's KeyFrames by whatever the current frame is. (Currently it seems to get the earliest element iterator possible and then just returns it if it's not the last element, I'm not sure I'm following the part correctly at all.)\nI made a na\u00efve \"fix\" like so:\n\n(keyframes.h)\n.. and successfully made the slices respect the frame in the editor. I'm absolutely sure there is a better way to go about this though.\nMy C++ is quite a bit rusty and this is my first time really looking at the Aseprite source, so sorry if I'm totally off here!\n. Am I correct in my assumptions above? I can clean it up and submit a PR if you'd like. . I see! A lot more work to be done, that's for sure.

I can confirm this is still happening, though I didn't even notice it until I read this issue.\nClarifying: The mouse disappears when moving slow or normal speeds. But when moving very quickly (especially when leaving through the titlebar), the cursor doesn't go away.\n(Personally I'd mark this as low priority as it's not really a big issue and doesn't seem to be causing problems, but that's just me.)\n. I'm going to agree with @dacap , the first one is nicer.\n. Same issue, but I figured out how to click.\nIf you hold down right click, then you can tap left click to left click.

I've remapped it next to my delete hotkey, so it should be pretty fast.\nThanks for the help.\n. What about something like this?\n\nAs you scrub across, it would display the position of cells independent of each other, but the image displayed would be a combination of all of them. Then there would need to be a way of linking these smaller sections to other layers, tags, or the timeline, etc. The timing of the smaller section would be scaled to what it's linked to.\nThat said, it's difficult to know how practical of a suggestion any of this is. I'm used to talking to devs who aren't even willing to fix minor problems let alone make major changes, so I'm always afraid that suggestions might be drifting too far from your own goals for Aseprite. You really are exceptional in that regard, compared to other devs.\nIs there anything related to the timeline that you explicitly don't want to do, or any limitations that you would have to work with?. @dacap Aight, thanks for the clarification.\nIn the example I posted, the transparent rectangles and lines represent the progress of the animation. It's the equivalent of this-\n\n..but for each layer, interdependently. It's how it could look if one layer were to play at a different speed than another. \nThe goal would be to enable the user to animate a small number of frames proportionally to a larger number of frames.\nUsage would go like this,\n1. Make a layer with 12 cells/frames. Add \"tag_1\" around them\n2. Make a second layer with 4 cells.\n3. Right click on second layer, \"assign to > tag_1 \"\nSecond layer is now a \"sub-layer\", has per-cell speed, and will make it's duration proportional to whatever it's linked to. Clicking on a position on one layer would show the equivalent position on other layers, based on the speed/number of frames.\n. Though, that doesn't solve the problem of frame-speed.\nAnother way would be to give all layers cell-based speed, and a checkbox that says \"lock timing\". When locked, layers would simply run at the speed of the frames, and when unlocked, they would play independent of it, like in the first picture I posted.\nYou could add the ability to link stuff, on top of that, and you would have the best of both worlds. It's probably simpler to implement without the linking, though.. Ah, my bad. Thanks for the help then.. Thanks for the response. Unfortunately that method wouldn't really speed up the process a whole lot, for my uses.\nFor future reference, someone linked me to this,\nhttps://vuf.github.io/GifFP/\nUsing it with Notepad++ you can get a list like this, which works decently well.\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/2db9a97b1a9b6b480c7a591d29d6b03f.png.

    "oxysoft": "When this is added, we need to be able to right click empty area to return to the brush tool as well.. No, I'd estimate that it is indeed around 6 to 12 milliseconds. Most people will find that okay but to me, that is egregious for 2016 software. My mouse is your standard cheap desktop mice. I've tried other screen scaling factors and it's all the same. Reducing the window size seems to have maybe improved it by 2-3 milliseconds but it's probably just placebo taking effect, it's hard to tell. Of all the configurations I've tried, none of them made the cursor as smooth as the native cursor.\nedit: I might add also that there seems to be pretty severe cursor tearing, it just goes invisible when I move it really fast\n. I've recorded with OBS but it doesn't capture the mouse phasing in and out of view unfortunately. In the recording it appears fine.\nMy CPU is an intel core i7 860 2.80GHz. It's old (2007-2009) but it was a powerful CPU back at the time.\nI think you should let us get rid of the crosshair and any kind of cursor rendered by the application and use all native instead. See Graphics Gale for example. When drawing, it changes the native cursor for a small pencil cursor and it renders under the cursor the changes that would occur were you to click. I personally really don't care for a crosshair, I just want a graphics gale equivalent.\nAlso note that when moving the canvas around with middle mouse button, it lags intensely. I'm not sure if that's related but that's also unacceptable.\nedit: now I don't understand. What do you mean by \"crosshair cursor/brush preview cannot be solved with custom hardware/native cursors\"? It absolutely can. Just use the native cursor for the lil crosshair or a pencil and the preview below is rendered by the software\n. I had someone else try it yesterday and he said he also felt some delay. I tried it a few secs ago on my brother's computer but I noticed some differences\n- The mouse delay still felt present, but a lot less than on my computer, I'd estimate around 2 to 4 milliseconds. His CPU is weaker but his GPU is a bit stronger than mine (GTX 580 vs 660 or 680, can't exactly remember)\n- middle mouse button dragged the canvas around a lot more smoothly than on my computer. On mine it's just a choppy mess\n- The cursor did not phase in and out as I moved the cursor around really quickly. I think it did actually but it was a lot less noticeable, like A LOT less. On mine, I can move it not even that fast and I'll notice the problem.\n\nThe crosshair could be replaced with a simple custom native cursor (anyway we'd lose the black/white negative with it), but the brush preview is impossible to be replaced (as it uses the same Editor render engine/active tool/ink configuration to show the preview).\n\nSo replace it with the native cursor but add a check to not render the crosshair, just the brush preview if you have native cursor enabled? This way, you have the OS' native cursor rendering on top and the preview rendering below. \n. Also if it can be of any use, when I open a window like the preference window, and I move it around, there are some problems with the edges of the window. You know how there are 1px black lines surrounding it? If I move the window to the right for example, the 1px border on the right will kinda flash in and out as I move faster or slowing, the same happens on all side if I move it in circle or kinda just jiggle it. On the other hand, the side opposite to the direction I move the window towards has a bigger outline. I also had some trouble capturing that with OBS which is weird.\n. > Yes (my second point here), anyway the brush preview will still have the same delay.\nOh no, I meant once we sort it out and the delay is fixed. No, actually it could be a good way to demonstrate the problem. If I can get a build with the cursor on top, the native cursor would be smooth and the fake cursor below wouldn't, which could be a good way to record it and show it to you in motion.\n\nJust to check, you might try to disable the brush preview (uncheck View > Show > Brush Preview option). It might improve a little bit the performance, but not an huge difference.\n\nI wasn't actually testing the mouse delay on a canvas, I was on the home tab with the main cursor so it's irrelevant. The delay is there even on the home tab when there is no preview!!\n. I can see how some people might not care about the off vertices, and for that reason I think there should an option as well, to display the crosshair for just the active vertex or for all.. ",

    "astraldata": "I would prefer to use the mouse-wheel roll to change between animation frames -- please allow the option to pick between the two. I rather enjoy the hands-free pixeling workflow this option gives me when animating -- it's a little-known workflow over the masses, but it's very comfortable to roll the wheel to scroll back and forth through the animation -- it's almost like rolling paper with your fingers in traditional animation. I use the RMB-drag to drag a rectangle selection to shift parts of a sprite (such as parts of limbs or head+torso) around, then touch them up a little (to avoid having to re-pixel the /entire/ limb / head / torso) in Graphics Gale to animate larger sprites. Additionally, I do lots of rolling my mouse to swap between frames and grabbing colors (color-picking) with right-click to animate efficiently -- Why shouldn't this one-handed (very comfortable) animation workflow be possible in Aseprite too?\n  . +9000 to KasumiArai -- that sort of tilemap feature would be amazing in Asesprite! D: \n. It's terrible -- this feature is due by 2021 ... and I've needed at least a preliminary version three years ago...  :'(. Indeed lol!\nI currently don't have PyxelEdit, and, personally, I don't care for its pixel workflow in general, but the one feature it has on Aseprite is one I can't get away from -- and that's a tilemap editor. \nI don't care about laying out a level in Aseprite -- I can do that in a game engine (or Tiled. )\nEverything else I want to do with tiles needs a great pixel editor alongside it.\nFor that purpose -- I only want/need a few things: \n\nFirst, a list of editable tile indexes of a specific size that can be selected from and arranged like the color palette already can (in fact, a simple copy/paste of much of the palette arrangement code would do just fine)\nSecond, a (potentially disposable) \"swathe\" space (similar to the \"preview\" window) where I can draw up a preview swathe of tiles (with chosen repetitions / mirrors / flips / rotations) of individual tile indexes\nNext, the swathe would respond, in realtime, to the strokes (and the color changes) you lay out in the main window. The main window itself would display a user-selected number of nearby swathe tiles in the X/Y direction and allow those tiles to be individually and simultaneously edited in the main window, right alongside the currently-selected tile from the swathe.\n\nTo clarify #3 and the imagined workflow in general -- just as the \"Tiled x\" and \"Tiled y\" settings allow repetitions to be displayed and edited in the main window area -- that's essentially what editing in the main window would do with a tile index selected, except with nearby tiles to the one that the user has chosen in the swathe. The swathe will always have 1 index at least, and if you select an index in the list of tiles, it can replace that index in the swathe automatically -- otherwise, selection would usually be done in the swathe palette window where both placement (and selection!) occurs. You would, of course, have a list of tile indexes that would, essentially, just act like the color picker for the most part. Only the first index is considered the origin tile (or perhaps the origin tile /group/) of course.\nI do hope I've described everything here well enough to make it sensible.\nFrom what I can tell from the editor -- the design outlined above will allow much of the code to be copy-pasted from the rest of the editor. -- Not all can be copy/pasted, but enough to have a preliminary display of tiles from a palette in a new preview window at least! -- Which is why this feature is so critical! It's the one thing Graphics Gale doesn't have and the one thing all other -lesser- (imo) pixel editors seem to have -- except with a poor implementation. Aseprite is up there with Gale in terms of user-friendliness, and I just wish it had this one feature to make it a Gale-killer for everything Gale lacks.\n. Thanks for sharing that, haxpor. -- In many cases (at least with pixel art), simple transparency overlays can handle the same problem Wang Tiles seeks to solve (using an uncecessarily-specialized algorithm). \n@dacap \ud83d\udc4d :\nIf Aseprite did anything to help with what Wang Tiles tries to help with, it could be solved in a more useful and general-purpose way:\nFor example, it would be amazing if it would let you auto-merge individual layer-pair combinations sequentially. For example, you could specify that layers 1-4 would be the transparent overlays, and layers 5-22 would be the various combinations that 1-4 would overlay (i.e. 1 overlays 5, then 2 overlays 5, etc.., next 1 overlays 6, then 2 overlays 6... yada yada... you get the point.)\nAnd for a slightly more complex (but infinitely more useful) alternative implementation, it would be nice to specify groups and sort orders of multiple overlays before executing the overlay+merge function. The idea came from when I was more recently playing with  and it made me think of Aseprite ... It would be nice if the auto-combine feature I proposed above based on haxpor's suggestion could do more advanced transparent overlay combining. The idea behind Charas is to pull from a ton of layers of heads/hair/body-styles/accessories/etc. and letting a user combine them into a sprite atlas. I could see it being highly useful to do something like this for character animation too instead of a hard-coded thing like Charas has (perhaps by simply leveraging animation frames and layers simultaneously) to make it easier for an artist to generate automatic overlay + merges on a large variety of sprite combinations and animations. Even if we had to do this on a per-file basis, it would still be so much greater than the manual merging that is required in every other tool...\nJust my two-cents! -- Maybe I'm onto something here though?. If we use any indexed-color picker, please allow us to use an HSL picker too. It's killing me to use HSB to do my indexed-color palettes, since I come from Gale and have always had access to the HSL slider in some form or another in all my other art/animation programs. \nIt's the one thing that's really hurting my color-picking sensibilities in ASEsprite, and it's not something I think I can easily get over when working steadily with indexed palettes as I usually do. :(\n\nAnd regarding the color-bar widget, it's a simple fix:\nYou could simply have a Radio button list of pickers in the picker window that changes the entire window's interface between the RGB/HSB/HSL (<-- yes, HSL) various picker bars, depending on which is selected.\n. Definitely would love this -- Got used to using the one in Gale for color selection, but any way to use HSL would be infinitely appreciated -- especially if it happens soon, and changes the sprite and palette indexes directly on low-color images! \n. Thank you, and I agree -- but with a few important considerations:\nThe lasso tool (as the default drag-selection tool) imo would be a much better option than the box selection tool as default, since I feel this functionality would be used mostly for character/object animation than for tilesets (to which the only use I could see for the box-selection-tool being the default for is this -- and only with grid-snapping enabled, and to which the planned tileset interface should take care of, as far as I'm seeing it).\nThe planned tileset interface/functionality could actually implement the box-selection as default when you're working on tiles though, if easy enough. I would actually think that best, but perhaps with an option to toggle which tool is used the as default selection tool for which interface -- i.e. sometimes tilesets are composed of mostly organic objects, so using a lasso tool there could be somewhat useful as a default in such a case. I would suggest making the toggle easy to get to, so maybe make it a tool drop-down menu toggle perhaps (i.e. in the File/Edit/Etc. menu the default selection tool of choice for the normal editor, followed by a separator, followed by the tileset editor's default right-click selection tool).\n. Ah, nice. Didn't know about the double-click thing. Thanks!\nI definitely agree the box is faster -- but it's also messier. Lots of times, I need the lasso in Gale, but I settle for the box because it's there, still relatively fast, and I became used to it. In the end, it would be better to have a toggle for the lasso OR box tool as the default selection tool. For me, I prefer accuracy when dealing with pixel selections, but for you, maybe the box-selection is more comfortable and therefore faster and more intuitive to use. I'd rather be uncomfortable for a while, personally, and be able to manipulate the pixels exactly where I'd like to than have to clean-up even more than I otherwise would during animation. That's a matter of personal taste in workflows though, so I respect your thoughts on this. I do agree that my suggestion of its implementation would seem a lot more sloppy than a simple toggle in the preferences though as to which you'd rather use. \nI wouldn't use the rectangular marquee tool very often anymore now that I know you can double-click with the lasso to get a full tile. That's just loads of awesome! Makes me love Asesprite even more! I just wish we'd get the right-click selection implemented now! I've just come over from Gale and wish I could just set it aside completely! If it weren't for this one missing feature, I really could! Asesprite has everything I need, but it just doesn't have the solid pixel-art animation workflow Gale has without this! That's a real shame for everything else it has on Gale! D:\n. Allowing the auto-outline command to be applied automatically across all frames would make this perfect for animators who use the silhouette technique to animate with.\n. That is quite interesting that I've missed such a feature lol. I've been using Gale since I started pixel-art, like 13 years ago. I wonder if that's why there's no option to swap between box-selection and lasso-selection as right-click and drag tools -- perhaps the box-selection and the lasso tool work too differently internally? This always seemed like such an oversight! Now it seems like more of a technical issue than anything... or at least I hope so. D:\nI'm always up for multi-tools because I hate having to switch tools/modes by clicking on buttons/etc., so this is a great idea. I really like it when you can make a tool work intuitively for you, even if it has a little learning curve before you finally get the concept. This seems like one of those tools!\n. ",

    "niedzielski": "\nHope tile width and height are Tilemap Layer properties then and could be any\n\nI hope you don't mind me chiming in but this is on my wishlist too! It would be very useful for my purposes to allow tile sizes to be variable within an image as derived from their source Aseprite files. E.g., I may have a tree tile that's 48px x 64px, a water tile that's 8px x 3px, and a player tile that's 12px x 8px.\nI'll also comment on the export format. Almost as important as the feature itself is the format it's exported in. I've been using the binary format for spritesheets to interpret the JSON output which I believe is otherwise undocumented. There are many different options for the format so it has ended up quite specific (here's my current interpretation-- I just mash the frames and meta.slices together). I don't mean to overstate the difficulty of the task to parse but the easier it is to conceptualize and consume the output, the better. One of the reasons I love Aseprite is because the output format is sane and infinitely better than the Tiled Map Editor's.\nFinally, I hope that the faculty for adding slices and metadata will be improved. This would be an invaluable addition to a tilemap editor where one would immediately want to start adding annotations such as speed, palette, level, collision boxes, etc for later interpretation by a program.\nThank you for making such a nice tool! :+1:. I have this same problem with both tags and slices. It's awesome that I can export a bunch of sprites, tags, and slices from multiple source Aseprite files into a single PNG sheet but there's no way to associate tag or slice names to frames per file except by user convention. Frame association works fine when only a single file is packed into the sprite sheet but that almost never happens since it defeats the point. For example, I use the convention in my tag and slice names of \"a tag / slice name is a file stem followed by an animation name\" with a --filename-format '{tag} {frame}'. This is super error prone though because I have to remember it when I'm drawing. I would much rather that each tag and slice include a filename property so that it's part of the format..

    "awesomez": "@dacap \nYou rock, my friend! -- Thank you!\nThat said -- please also keep in mind that \"metatiles\" should be supported early-on too!\nFor example, many SNES games (almost all of them actually) built large sprites out of small 8x8 \"mini tiles\" that referenced (linked) to a particular grouping of 8x8 pixels in a particular 8x8 position on a canvas. From there, they were assembled into larger 16x16 regular tiles (which could be highly-detailed and were varied) because the image could be visualized and edited almost procedurally.\nSee this:\n\n\nThis is the basic \"metatile\" approach (for autotiling terrain):\n\nAbout METATILES:\n\"Metatiles\" have nothing to do with terrain or autotiling though. \n\nDoes THAT look like autotiling to you?\nMetatiles are simply a group of references (or \"links\") to even tinier bits of pixels that may \"tile\" and help vary larger (usually 16x16) tiles by replacing one or two of the 4 (usually 8x8) corners.\nTheir ability to \"autotile\" as terrain is just a convenient use-case for level designers. \nFor artists, being able to \"group\" bits of tinier tiles into a larger \"metatiles\" is an essential function for professional pixel artists due to their ability to quickly (and procedurally) get detailed images by editing only a small part of a larger tile. \nChrono Trigger's backgrounds (above) would never have been possible without the ability to procedurally edit and visualize the whole 16x16 tile (in the context of its scene) AND the tiny bits of each tile, all while being visualizing (and editing!) the 16x16 tile itself while it is being combined with other 16x16 tiles -- all simultaneously!\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nThe important thing is to look at each \"tile\" as a HIERARCHY of more-detailed parts (usually no more than 2 levels of detail deep, but provide 3 just to be safe). \nThese details can themselves be edited, depending upon what level of the hierarchy the artist is working at (with an up/down arrow to toggle the current tile subdivision.) Currently, you only have 1 level of hierarchy -- 16x16, but maybe I need an 8x8 and a 4x4 that autopopulated their lower-level tile links when I created my new 16x16 tile. What if I now want to edit some of the smaller 4x4 segments too for better seamlessness in my tileset? These links should be autogenerated and bitmasks should be used to \"pick\" the links for the two lower-level subdivisions based on the 16x16 tile variation you're currently working on.\nTILE ARRANGEMENT LAYER\nWe should also have a \"Tile Arrangement\" layer that grabs links from \"Tile Layers\" and simply arranges them into larger structures (such as the edge of a mountain with varied edges along its footprint and middle -- see the Chrono Trigger tileset and the mountains.)\nThese \"Tile Arrangement\" layers should actually be able to create weirdly-shaped tiles based around the base tile size (16x16 in this example) and the \"Objects\" created from the \"Tile Arrangements\" just pull in their pixels from the regular \"Tile Layer\" (which will update its details from the 8x8 and 4x4 subdivisions of the basic 16x16 tile when these subdivisions are edited in the viewport.)\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nJust my two-cents as a professional pixel artist. D:\nThank you for finally tackling this aspect -- I just want this tileset editing to be as good as those (unreleased) pixel editors from days of old. :). > Maybe just Ctrl+click select shape of tiles from tileset and plotting them as whole would suffice? And also be able to Ctrl+click select shape of tiles from tilemap itself and copy/cut/paste them?\nThis isn't a bad way to keep it simple UI-wise. \nI was thinking in terms of being able to load these into a game or game engine easily too. The concept of tile subdivision levels for a given \"Tileset Layer\" would make loading these kinds of tiles into game engines (using native Aseprite files) much easier programmatically, since each tile in a single Tileset Layer could be assumed to have a certain number of subdivision levels (3), and these could then be linked data-wise.\nTo speed up the selection of smaller subdivided tiles, the whole tile selection grid should change size (depending on the current tile subdivision level), perhaps through using left-, middle-, or right-clicks to select the 16x16 (subdivision level 0), 8x8 (subdivision level 1), or 4x4 (subdivision level 2) respectively.\nRegarding \"Tile Arrangement\" layers to create an \"Object\" of tiles of any shape:\nIt would definitely be useful to be able to select \"Object\" arrangements consisting of any weird amalgamation of 8x8 + 4x4 + 16x16 tiles (all in the same \"Object\" in a \"set\" of \"Objects\" made of tiles) so that when the 8x8 pixels get updated, the 16x16 version doesn't change (but instead creates a new variation of the \"Object\" in the Tile Arrangement layer and the 16x16 \"tile\" -- That way we could grab various cliff \"Objects\" like the ones shown above in Chrono Trigger tileset, all without needing to redo the graphics for each tiny variation.\nYour UI idea works though -- I just think that, under the hood, it should probably function as I described so that we can get the benefit of having \"procedural\" tile aspects to our tile art like in the art tools from the days of old.. > I think that the only requirement for \"metatiles\" is an easy way to group small tiles in a kind of palette/sandbox area were we can arrange 8x8 tiles in 16x16 groups and then we can grab those objects/bigger tiles and put then as a group in the canvas (but the 8x8 tiles information is always the real information kept in the tilemap).\nThis is backwards from fast, iterative, and procedural. :(\n-- Think \"hierarchical selection tree\", rather than \"drawing atomic groups of tiny pixel-blobs\".\nTo be clear:\nThe information stored should be 16x16 (or whatever the largest base \"chunk\" size is), then 4 bits determine the 8x8 corner of the first 50% subdivision, then the final 4 bits determine the final 4x4 corner from the previous subdivision (the operation occurs on only one of the 8x8 corners). \nThis operation decides the particular group of pixels to be displayed/edited/replaced. \nThis is the way Sonic the Hedgehog stored its HUGE level maps + collision in the world (as well as its massive number of variations of sloped tiledata) just by using tiny 8bit variables in a hierarchical and procedural way. This wouldn't have been possible to display (and interact with) on a 16-bit system without this procedural approach -- and wouldn't you know it? -- procedural art is trending too.\nRegarding the construction of larger \"objects\" out of variations of the 16x16, 8x8, 4x4 tiles: \nThe process to edit/display the tiles would crawl the subdivision levels of the nearest 16x16 tile you've clicked on (in the palette) to select the correct pixels. \nThis is faster if you have lots of 16x16 tile chunks (which can fill up the screen faster and with less memory overhead than tons of 8x8 or 4x4 tiles). \nYou could even have a \"super-subdivision level\" so that you could go up to 32x32 and 64x64 by holding shift + left/middle/right- clicking to select the tiles (rather than down), which would give you a total of 5 different levels of subdivision, saving memory in both realtime games and in Aseprite, while remaining entirely procedural for the artist himself to edit/tweak.\nAlso -- middle/right clicks could be substituted by Ctrl/Alt or Shift + Ctrl/Alt to quickly display all 8x8 and 4x4 chunks (or, with Shift, display 32x32 and 64x64 chunks to be selected via left-click.)\nSo to summarize -- \n-- Have left, middle, right clicks in the palette (by default) select the proper tile -- starting with the main/large pixels (16x16), subdivided pixels lvl1 (8x8), and finally subdivided pixels lvl2 (4x4) of the nearest 16x16 tile or corner, if right-clicking or middle clicking.\nThis is just a \"new\" way of doing pixel art (procedurally) that was used by companies like Square/Enix in the SNES days to create beautiful pixel art iteratively and procedurally (to help it look like a painting) in titles like Chrono Trigger, where the tilesets never look \"human-readable\", since the art tool itself helps the artist iterate procedurally, providing a fast way to throw out tiny edits to tiles (using different sizes), then glob them together in a single canvas, letting artists edit them quickly, updating the whole image (and its constituent tiny tile variations) simultaneously. Then, exporting the \"hand-painted\" map as a brand-new map in the game environment was just icing on the cake.. > Correct me if I'm wrong:\nA tilemap is a grid where each tile points to a tileset (let's call it tileset A) with tiles of 16x16\nEach 16x16 tile in the tileset A is 4 tiles/indexes to another tileset B with tiles of 8x8\nAnd each tile in tileset B are 4 tiles from a tileset C with tiles of 4x4\n\nYou've got it.\nThe idea I had in mind was less-complex (to the user/artist) than the implementation suggested by @not-surt in that the tiles would be grabbed from the source image (the canvas image itself essentially is the tile palette's source image, like it shows in your feature preview video), and all tiles are auto-grabbed from that image upon clicking a button. The button executes a function that grabs all pixels that are different from the base grid size, then sorts them from there based on the base size (16x16 in the example), then subdivides to grab all the identical 8x8, 4x4 tiles and then _super_divides to grab any 32x32 and 64x64 tiles that are identical from the base image according to these tile-sizes).\nTile Arrangement Layers\nThis would automatically genearate you a palette full of metatiles where the pixels that were not identical in the canvas to other groups of pixels (each \"group\" is iterated over based on every super/sub tile size, based around the base tile size) and can now be considered linked to \"tiles/metatiles\" in the newly-generated palette. These palette tiles are based on the canvas image layer (which is now converted to a \"Tile Arrangement\" layer.) This procedure would have been executed to \"grab tiles\" from the canvas, probably via button-click, and makes that canvas a \"Tile Arrangement\" layer, which consists of tiles created by a palette (and also is generated from a regular canvas, which creates the palette itself without duplicating any tiles, as you've already done in your demo video.)\nThis palette could be changed to dynamically display subdivided tiles (8x8/4x4) by holding Ctrl or Alt respectively. To show superdivided tiles, you get (32x32/64x64) by holding SHIFT and then pressing Ctrl or Alt. Upon releasing Ctrl or Alt, the palette returns to showing normal non-subdivided tiles. All tiles can be left-clicked and selected with dragging the mouse (to select multiple tiles at once).\nUnder the hood, the standard drawing layer's canvas (where you pulled your tiles from) would be transformed into a \"Tile Arrangement\" layer that would be provided links to the palette indexes of 16x16 tiles as the base palette, which also includes the pixels from the original canvas (which can still be edited with drawing tools on the \"Tile Arrangement\" layer as if this was still a regular canvas layer). The subdivided and superdivided metatiles also store their pixel data in the tile palettes based on the indexes of their subdivisions/superdivisions. When placing tiles, the \"Tile Arrangement\" layer notes whether they're subdivided/superdivided, and what level of subdivision/superdivision they're at when placed, and references these pixel blobs from the \"Tile Arrangement\" layer itself.\nThis means one can create \"Objects\" out of the tiles on a \"Tile Arrangement\" layer by simply selecting those tiles on the \"Tile Arrangement\" layer. Then, after creating a \"Tile Object\", it will reference the specific palette of tile images and their subdivisions/superdivisions when you draw on them. You can draw new \"Tile Objects\" from many palettes on a \"Tile Arrangement\" layer. \nProcedural Palettes:\nA \"palette\" consists of a base size of tile (16x16), that also includes links to a superdivided (32x32 upto 64x64) and subdivided (8x8 downto 4x4) versions of the drawing-canvas image. The image it pulls from the drawing canvas (Tile Arrangement) layer, which includes the metatile's pixels and the metatile subdivision/superdivision data. This image data will always be the same for all subdivisions/superdivisions in the palette (since it all pulls from the source image). \nRegarding palette UX:\nThe palette can be quickly swapped based on the keys you press (and hold) while selecting tiles using left-click and/or drag.\nThe palette would be mostly dynamic -- i.e. when holding CTRL, 8x8 tiles are displayed, ALT, 4x4 tiles, SHIFT+CTRL, 32x32, and SHIFT+ALT 64x64 (otherwise the palette shows the 16x16 base tile's size and imagery.)\nThe palette's canvas layer (its \"Tile Arrangement\" layer) can be changed by pointing a dropdown to another, separate, \"Tile Arrangement\" layer (i.e. where you draw \"snow\" on top of your tiles in the scene).\nThis ensures you can keep a palette and grab its imagery from \"Tile Arrangement\" layers.\nYou can duplicate the palette too (and all its subdivision levels) and have many \"object palettes\" associated with the palette you're working with, including subdivision/superdivision levels, which are pulled from the \"Tile Arrangement\" layer (and imagery) too. These can be \"stamped\" on a standard canvas (perhaps with a special tile-placement tool that acts just like the palette, to let you use CTRL or ALT to grab from tiles in a particular palette.)\nPalettes could point to external files, but I'd suggest just making them grab from internal pixel layers honestly. Then, when exporting, offer the option to \"compress\" the tileset by removing the \"extra\" tiles from the \"Tile Arrangement\" layer imagery (or giving the user the ability to keep it, assuming they do want to preview what their tileset looks like inside their game engine with the test \"Tile Arrangement\" image. They can \"compress\" it later and save image space when they're ready to ship their game.\n@dacap  --  I know that's a lot to read, but it pretty much describes the whole system from start to finish. Let me know if I've missed something.. > I think the difference is that tilemaps of 16x16 have indexes to a tileset of 16x16 tiles, not to 4x4 tiles. So basically metatiles is not only a way to composite bigger tiles with smaller ones (hierarchy of tiles) but it is also a way to compress tilemap data (because tilemaps reference only to their own level of tiles using smaller index numbers).\n^^^ This. ^^^\n\n\nAnyway I'm not sure what level of control over each tileset level is required (I suppose total control), in our example, we should be able to re-arrange the tiles in the 8x8 tileset in any order and the final visible result should be the same without modifying the data of the tilemap A, but the tileset/tilemap B data in the 8x8 level should be completely different.\n\nThe way I see it, the underlying (internal) indexing should not be visible/modifiable to the user, but instead, the arrangement of tile indexes on each subdivision level should be.\nIn other words, index \"0\" should be whatever tile index the arrangement layer assigns it (internally), but the user-facing index should be whatever the user wants it to be. It could be \"brick\" or \"grass\", but Aseprite shouldn't care -- the internal indexes should be treated as just a clear database reference id; the palette arranged entries (on the other hand) should be the user-arrangement id. Since there's always going to be the same number of tile indexes internally as there are specially-arranged tiles by the user, it really doesn't matter what order the user sets. Internally, the reference always needs to be persistent, and the user is not always going to want that same reference. Therefore, the internal (procedural) tile reference index and the visible (user-facing) palette displaying index for that same tile should be stored separately (and simultaneously) in the file. This allows the user to have total control of palette selection and display while also simultaneously letting Aseprite maintain full control too, to maintain proceduralism.\nNumber of (Useful) Subdivision Levels:\nRegarding the number of levels a user would need to manage subdivisions for -- I have never seen any tile-based game, NES all the way to Playstation, require more than 5 different levels of tile sizes. Whether the base tile size is 64x64 (see Megaman X4 on the Playstation) or 8x8 (various Gameboy games), tiles rarely use more than two or three levels of subdivision. It could be neat to hold Ctrl + Alt to do half-sized tiles too (like 8x16 or 16x8, depending upon whether Ctrl was pressed before Alt, or Alt was pressed before Ctrl). This could make it possible to have horizontal and vertical (non-square) sets of tiles -- and be able to pick from them quickly too. \nAlternate Control for Custom (Non-Square) Tiles:\nUsing the Ctrl or Alt keys to cycle (one-way) through superdivision and subdivision levels could work too, as an alternative method to grabbing specially-arranged tiles (such as 64x16 or 8x32), which could be input manually (if the base subdivisions/superdivisions aren't \"custom\" enough).. @dacap is da-man!! -- Moving between frames using the mousewheel would be an awesome addition!\nThanks a ton man!\nNow if I could only right-click + drag to temporarily select a portion of my sprite with a lasso or box tool, then rotate that portion of my sprite (being able to use \"rotsprite\"), we'd be cooking with fire when making some awesome pixel animation workflows possible~!! \ud83d\udd25 \nThat's really the only two productivity things kicking me in the teeth right now in terms of animation with Aseprite!. Right, but I don't usually zoom when animating -- I keep a steady zoom the entire time I do animation. During animation, scrolling/changing between frames would be infinitely more useful with the mousewheel -- using Ctrl+mousewheel to change zoom levels would be better at that point.\nEither that, or allow me to zoom in the main panel with the mousewheel and scroll frames when rolling the wheel in the timeline area -- or maybe both options?\n--EDIT\nAnimation is a different beast than drawing a pretty pixel art image -- you generally want the image to be stationary while you're drawing so that you can compare the previous frames properly (and don't want to accidentally zoom.)\nMaybe a checkbox toggle in the interface that's easily accessible via shortcut too? -- This option would swap the behavior of the zoom-image / change-frames behavior of my mousewheel. Ctrl+mousewheel would do the opposite behavior.\n. This really depends on your hands and the shape of your fingers as to whether this feels \"natural\" -- I'm a gamer, but standard keyboard controls have never once felt more \"natural\" to me than using the mouse.\nThat being said, being able to assign a keyboard shortcut isn't a bad idea, but as a pixel animator who rarely uses a tablet, I prefer the mouse options.. Fair enough -- I never considered moving the shortcuts to one side of the keyboard, but it makes sense. As I said, I got frustrated trying to animate with the default (keyboard-based) setup and wasn't thinking. I suppose I could do what you suggested in the meantime to keep the keyboard painfulness at a minimum while this gets implemented in some form. \nThe major thing to me is that it requires an extra two actions from me (a set of actions which are way slower, cumulatively, than my current workflow.) \nThe sole \"reason\" of having to press the key is to swap to the marquee, but I also have to click/drag to select, and then move/rotate/scale the part (the only thing I'm trying to do), and then manually swap back to my brush tool after making some tweaks, which will likely require me to swap back over to the marquee again and rinse/repeat a few more times if the changes don't look quite right in the animation. This is especially cumbersome when working with larger sprites that need lots of adjustment of these parts. Graphics Gale makes working with large sprites like this just as easy as small ones because of the mouse-based action is so accessible to the user.\nPerhaps a separate brush/marquee (and brush/lasso) hybrid tool would be easier? \nThis would let one pick colors and perform the marquee/lasso function with the right-click and draw with left-click. The difference would likely be that adding/removing (additional) photoshop-style selections to the current selection (in this mode) wouldn't be possible because it would essentially deselect everything and create an entirely new selection by default. And I'd be okay with that. -- If I wanted that kind of flexibility with my marquee/selection tools, I'd go grab the marquee/selection tools myself.. One slight correction to #3 really quick:\n\nIf you push right mouse button, drag it, and release it, it should behave like the Rectangular Marquee tool, temporarily switch to the Rectangular Marquee, and instantly activate the drag mode of the marquee tool (not just temporarily swap over to it) and upon releasing the right-mouse button, you swap back to the brush tool automatically\n\nBut yep -- that's exactly what I'd be describing here. Thanks for looking into this, @dacap !\nEDIT:\nAlso, regarding #4 there -- it might be nice to add a preference to whether the Ctrl will swap to the lasso or to the marquee tool in this mode, and simply have it toggle between the two if you need one or the other. It's likely you'll need one MOST of the time but never both ALL of the time. In this case, a simple toggle shortcut, button, and/or preference setting might be better. \nSometimes I might want the lasso to be on Ctrl, but then other times I might want the marquee to be the one Ctrl switches to. This would depend upon the work I'm doing and whether I'm working with something like tiles versus organic stuff.\nEDIT 2:\nSorry, had to tweak 3 again... I'm done now lol.\n. ---EDITED FOR CLARITY---\nSorry I wasn't clear on this behavior, @dacap, I didn't realize you hadn't used Gale before.  I don't think \"extensions\" would really work for this kind of thing because it changes how the brush tool itself behaves (i.e. by letting the brush tool itself control the handles of the selection, without having to switch to the marquee tool for that single bit of functionality). This still allows it to BE a brush tool and a marquee tool (to some extent) simultaneously.\nWhat I was trying to explain was this:\nWhen you drag the right mouse button (with the brush tool active), you immediately start drawing the selection marquee. Upon release of the right mouse button, both the brush tool stays AND the selection stays (and you can even start drawing inside of the selection with the brush tool, or you can rotate/scale/etc. the selection while also being able to draw simultaneously. The brush tool is simply aware of the selection controls (almost as if it were the marquee-selection tool itself in Aseprite).\nThe selection itself is a separate object and does not behave any particular way based on what tool is selected/active. \nThe move/rotate/scale controls exist on the selection itself (that sits on the canvas) just like Aseprite's, but the brush tool knows how to ignore painting while manipulating the (persistent) controls, so you can do both painting and rotation/scale simultaneously to some extent. The marquee is only a way to define the area you want to modify. The selection controls stay active on the selection even if the selection tool is not active (i.e. if you're using the brush tool, the selection controls are still active for example)\nAs you should (hopefully) be able to imagine by now, it both temporarily activates the marquee tool AND activates the marquee \"box\" selection action simultaneously, which lets the user go immediately into selecting by dragging the right mouse. \nDragging the right-mouse at any point on the canvas (with the brush tool still selected) activates the above action immediately.  This happens exactly as if the user left-clicks and drags with the marquee tool (except that happens with right-click + drag instead).\nRegarding Graphics Gale...\nThinking on it more, I don't think the tool ever actually changes (aside from temporarily using it to grab width/height coordinates maybe) because the selection is actually a separate object (as mentioned above)..

I have logitech g600 (200 - 8200dpi) when i change dpi(hardware) no affect here. \n. Maybe it happens because mouse has 1000Hz polling rate and  the wacom table has a lower polling rate?\n.

By work i mean that cmake is able to successfully generate the make files.\nAlso the chrome/m50 branch for skia is no longer there it seems...\n. Thanks @tony ! I got it working by now. I was looking wrongly and only saw my local branches for Skia (I felt dumb). I checked out the chrome/m50 branch, built it and Asesprite is now almost succesfully compiled. Also thanks for clearing up the SKIA_DIR var!\nI'm getting one more error while linking the final executable.

Tried again, now with debug for skia and then rebuilding aseprite. Same error. Question, are you guys on the master branch for aseprite or did you checkout a tag?\n. Alright clear, I used the release version before but that also doesn't seem to build aseprite for me.\n. @tony I just threw everything away and start all over again by checking out all the repositories so can't answer right now. But I will asume I will have all the latest when cloning the repositories ;) .\nI'm on OS X 10.11.4, ninja 1.6.0 and cmake 3.5.2\n.

Hmm what python version did you use when running thegn` command?. The default python version in my system is 3+, that's what's causing the issue. The problem is with skia build script (gn). Changing it to be compatible with python3 would take a long time and would break with python2. \nThis issue should be closed now.

Hi, this problem also occurs with other events that open another system app like when clicking on Open Scripts Folder or Open Extensions/Theme Folder. Yes, python was the issue. The command should be python2.7 tools/git-sync-deps. I've realized that this is skia stuffs and has nothing to do with aseprite's code. The solution is to use python2 as system's default python version. . Hmmm i think that requiring the extension or script to be open sourced would be ideal.. ",

To @oceanhahn, somewhat @dacap:\nI kind of can understand that we (speaking of Open Source developers that try to establish a project for a living) need to pay the bills.

If they want to benefit monetarily from your software, they can do so. If they want to build their own hobby projects locally or open source, they can do so, too.\nWhat do you guys think about this?\nGood / Bad / Not working in practice?\n. ",

It also includes feeding those emotions with attacks against the open source community per guilt by association. Insults, zealous accusations and sarcasm are only making this issue worse than it already is\n- The license change process lacked in transparency.\n  It shouldn't have been an issue to make the change along with the blog article, a Twitter message, or anything.\n  Instead I heard about the change in an unrelated IRC channel by word of mouth, days after. No one even seems to have been aware of the change at that point. A blog announcement followed only after the drama started.\n  There's still misunderstandings about the concrete issue that lead to this change, see several people taking about having to 'pay the bills' or 'earning a living' above.\n- Aseprite was the best open source pixel art software.\n  Even in comparison with pixel art tools in general, Aseprite continues to be one of the best. But the loss of freedom is a loss of one of the big pluses of the software\n- Going proprietary seems like an excessive reaction to a potentially fixable problem.\n  It's great that @dacap communicates and details a problem with software distribution and feedback, but changing the licensing to 'fix' it doesn't make sense to me. What communication was there to solve this problem before creating this frustrating licensing situation?\n. ",

    "jarfil": "Hi @dacap, I found your blog post very interesting, but you completely lost me at the \"So why not GPL?\" part.\nI mean, you first talk about \"If someone doesn\u2019t want to (or just cannot) pay for your work, she/he is not a customer\", and then suddenly you turn around and say \"GPL [...] Users have a responsibility, they should be encouraged to contribute\". But you earlier realized that \"your software is not a service\", so why care about those users at all, who are not programmers and will not contribute to your work anyway?\nBy this I'm not trying to say what you should or shouldn't do, it's your code and you do whatever you want, but the reasoning seems contradictory.\n. @Download The GPL is essentially a \"software support business protection license\", no more, no less.\nYou write a piece of software, give it to someone, and get paid for support. If at any point you stop supporting it, you stop getting paid. Which is when anyone else can step in and offer a better support than you do... but, at the same time, can NOT use your code to build something that would lock you our from supporting that same client if they later on decided to switch back to you. You also get all the code written by your competing support businesses, whether your client wants to share it with you, or if they publicly share it as a competitive advantage to distinguish themselves.\nIf your business model is not software support, then there is little reason to use the GPL. On the other hand, if it is software support, then there is little reason not to use it.\n. ",
    "Download": "\nAnd here it is, the work of your entire live got cloned and is not yours anymore...\n\nDon't worry. Nothing will happen. Cloning a project is one press of the Fork button. Actually adding something of value to it is a whole different story. Just wait and see how that fork is going to not do anything but sit there.\n\npick GPL, build your project in good faith, and be prepared to get floored.\n\nThis is so true. The GPL as a license sucks imho.\nWhy?\nBecause the GPL has gone too far the other way. And because it's a license that's based on fear instead of love. And because it explicitly restricts derivatives into using the GPL, making it incompatible with most other OSS licenses. \nEspecially the fear thing. The whole license oozes a fear that someone else might end up making money on GPL'd software. There are needless restrictions against the authors of (derivatives of ) the work. MIT, BSD, ASF etc licenses do not have these restrictions, yet they thrive.\nTake the app store. GPL advocates act as if Apple has something against the GPL or OSS in general, when in fact it is restrictions in the GPL itself that make it essentially incompatible with the app store. And FSF people were threatening to sue, almost forcing Apple into it's current position. Why??? Having followed the FSF and GPL for years, though I respect them for their great early role in OSS, I now feel that they are actually hurting it. No GPL software on the app store isn't good for users. But it's a result of the fears included in the license text itself.\n@dacap Keep up the great work and do with your baby what you want!\nOh and one more thing. The GPL never promises that there will be new versions of the software. Not choosing to publish future versions of the software under the GPL isn't taking anything away from anyone!\n. His present work is already available under the GPL and that won't (can't) change. His new work will also be available for free. The GPL can't claim sole ownership of 'freedom' (though I know that's what they like to do). Yes, software can exists that is free software, even though it's not licensed under the GPL.  Aseprite is now yet another example of such software.\nWant to keep it GPL? Easy. Contribute to the GPL fork.\nBut that's the not happening part. The number 2 contributor to this project made just 25 commits, versus dacap's 4485 commits. The guy that forked this project, @akien-mga, made exactly ZERO commits to this project in it's entire history. He made ONE commit to the fork... the one that restores the GPL license... I wouldn't count on him to keep the project alive. All this 'keep it free' talk is nice, but doing some actual work to help the project is a lot nicer.\n. > Why not have a dual licensed model in aseprite with a popup on first start?\n\n\nGPL for free software users that want to create an open source game.\nEULA and paid license option for guys that want to build a paid game or app with it.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this is not possible. This is one of the reasons why the FSF sucks. They keep saying 'free as in free speech, not as in free beer', but actually, if you study the license, it is free as in free beer. There is no way around it. They make you think you can charge money for the software when actually you can't. \nThe GPL, just like all other Open Source licenses, does not allow discrimination against groups of users. If you make software available under the GPL license then it's available for anyone that accepts the terms in it. Even if they are EA and are making millions. At least the other licenses don't make you think you can somehow keep control.\nThe only way to make money off of GPL software is by dual licensing it. This can only be voluntary (because of the no discrimination rule), so you need customers that have a reason to want to do this. Because the only major restriction in the GPL is the one of reciprocity (quid for quo, if you make derivatives, these too need to be licensed under the GPL) it mostly means you will be targeting 'customers' trying to make a different version of Aseprite itself which they don't want to make available under the GPL... probably not a very big market.\n. > The strong unbalance in the contributors graph is IMO likely due to the CLA. \nNah. This is actually a very typical distribution for most open source projects. They are mostly either one-man-shows, or backed by some corporation that just has staff maintaining it. Linux is a big exception. There are thousands of projects with this distribution graph.... Actually, this one is pretty good with 27 contributors. Most projects have far less.\n. @akien-mga\nApart from the fact that your fork is most likely in fact, illegal, it's also not needed at all.\n\nSince https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite went proprietary on Aug 26th, 2016 (aseprite@5ecc356), this fork and corresponding GitHub organization were created to preserve the last GPLv2 version of the code.\n\nThere is no need to 'preserve' the last GPLv2 version, because that's exactly what Git was built for. Need the last GPLv2 version? Here it is. No fork needed.\nI say your fork is probably illegal because what you did was fork the master, which is now and was when you made the fork, licensed under @dacap 's eula and not under the GPL. Then you broke that eula when you made your changes.\nWhat you should have done was base your fork on v1.1.7. You would also not have to make any changes to the license then. because 1.1.7 is GPL licensed to begin with. \nBut actually, you didn't need to make the fork to begin with. because the last GPL version is safe, right here on GitHub. And there were already 188 forks of this project, so I'd say it was pretty safe already.\n. @akien-mga I stand corrected. \n. I'd say that even if your business is in providing support (for code you wrote), the GPL still is very tricky at best and damaging at worst. The biggest problem is that it's so difficult to do anything else with the code. Once you slap a GPL license on it and start accepting contributions, you basically give up all your rights as a copyright holder to do something else with that code should you later desire. Had you chosen, say, the MIT license, you could do whatever you wanted to with it. And so could others.\nWhat if some client decides he wants to include your code in a bigger product? You will have to inform them that he has to make his product available under the GPL... which he probably won't like. You end up in a situation where you no longer control what you do with your own work... even if you made over 4000 commits and the second largest contributor only made 25 commits. Too bad for you. \nWhy risk that? To prevent others from making millions off of your code? I don't see the advantage.\n. ",
    "est31": "@Download The current EULA of this project and most proprietary licenses are far more restrictive than the GPL is. If you don't like the GPL because of its restrictions, you shouldn't like proprietary licenses either.\nAbout this whole license change: @dacap is the author of this program, and its his decision whether he wants to keep further work under a proprietary license or not. It still makes me sad that his present and future work won't be made available as free software.\nHe seems to blame the distributions for this, and its sad if distros couldn't create a more friendly environment for people like him, so that more chose to stay on a free software path. Donation buttons, or stuff like that, these are very small things! The F-Droid app store has such functionalities.\n. ",
    "akien-mga": "@Download The strong unbalance in the contributors graph is IMO likely due to the CLA. Even though I understand the (IMO pertinent) reasons for having a CLA in the first place, the added bureaucracy and risk of relicensing (like it happened) would likely put off many potential contributors, me included. Being open source does not automagically generates a community of co-developers that will do tons of pull requests, the project itself must be capable of integrating such changes and to foster the various personal motivations that lead to contributing - many developers contribute for the love of free software, and would therefore avoid a project with a CLA that could lead to their work being relicensed under a proprietary EULA. There are of course other motivations, and many CLA-signers already stated that the license change does not bother them and that they will continue to contribute, which is awesome.\nSo no, I was not an aseprite contributor as far as code goes. My contribution was to package aseprite for the Mageia distribution, and to try to do this well.\nPlease read https://github.com/aseprite-gpl/aseprite/issues/1 as to my motivation for creating a fork, I never mentioned that I intended myself to lead the development of a competitive fork.\nYes, I can keep the GPL fork alive as in \"fix some simple bugs and ensure that the code still builds and runs fine for the years to come\", but no, I don't claim that I can produce a better aseprite than @dacap. @dacap created and wrote most of aseprite, and this software is so successful because he has a great vision and strong attention to the workflow - as time goes the proprietary aseprite should become even more awesome, and unless some very dedicated contributors arise, the GPL fork should stall around the current state (which is already a great piece of software IMO, and thus worth preserving).\n. @Download Check your facts, I did not fork the master, but the last GPLv2 commit before the license change. Then I removed the EULA file which does not apply to the source code as distributed under the GPLv2 license. And no, my point is not just to \"preserve\" the code as if it were a static tarball (tarballs exist already for that...), but to give a place for the contributors interested in a GPLv2 version to contribute to.

It looks like there are two points here, so I've separated my responses out.\n1.  I've just read through the change log, and this issue seems to originate in commits following commit 7750982af6159d0bcb01336da915d93c88318886 . To resolve this, the project should have really been forked at that point, creating a Aseprite 1 series and a Aseprite 2 series (or \"sGplrite\" and \"Aseprite Pro\", etc).

See or contact Paul Davis about this; he authors the Ardour package, and he asks people not to simply repack the product and distribute it. They still legally can, and PPAs/the KStudio distro does, but regular distros at large respect it.\n\nIt looks like Aseprite is free just because the distribution made it free (and not because the developer\u2019s decision, the developer is basically inexistent).\n\nBut you actually did.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how is the review system for applications on Ubuntu or other Linux distributions, but I think they don\u2019t have a way to contact the developer before the user makes the review, the review is just based on what was packaged.\n\nPublic repositories (the apt-get parts) don't have review systems, so you must be talking about software centers. If you want to be notified about those, you need to actually go ask them to transfer ownership of the repository over to you. This is not different than the marketplace environment--Apple isn't going to police your brand for you either.\nIf your name is trademarked (and it should be) then Debian et all as well as the Ubuntu Software Center aren't going to package it without permission. If they do, you can ask them to pull it (and opt to take over distribution yourself; where you could have put a price tag on it yourself, and you indeed would get the percentages that you posted a desire for.) You can ask any distro to pull it (because trademark) and simply ask people not to do it. If they do it, they have to \"iceweasel\" which still uses the GPL code while not affecting your brand.\n\nIn an alternative world, open source programs that are being sold, could have a charge, and a % could be for the distribution, other % for the package maintainer, and other % for the developer.\n\nAs I just explained, this already existed. The community itself can't do this for you, because you are the one who owns the trademark and has power of attorney. Ubuntu allows you to charge a fee. elementary's upcoming Houston software center does too. \n\nGPL is about \u201cgiving everything to the user\u201d and asking for nothing. That kind of mentality might contribute to the destruction of the software (or destruction of people). Users have a responsibility, they should be encouraged to contribute as much information as possible to fix bugs, and we have the responsibility to facilitate this process as much as possible.\n\nGPL doesn't stop you from charging (the FSF even advocates buying GPL stuff); what it stops is monopolistic ownership of source code. FSF itself has asked people to buy products from them. Linux distros ask people to buy products from them. Open source GPL software has asked people to download stuff from them. elementary asks people to \"pay what they want\" before supplying ISOs, Ardour asks people to sponsor them when they start it. So even if someone repackages binaries for another distro, the user still gets asked to support the original developer.\nThere are also other considerations, like getting in a Humble Bundle.\nI'm sorry if you feel like the Linux community at large isn't something you can put faith it, though I don't seem to notice you actually did try to integrate with it.\nLet me put it this way: If you didn't provide Apple binaries, and someone put the product on the App store, would it then be Apple's fault that you weren't listed as the developer?  That's exactly the same situation that's happening here. Yes Apple has a means to deal with this situation--others do too.\nHere's what you should have done:\nGet in touch with others who are in this space (ex. Paul Davis.) Ask the software centers to transfer ownership to you (Ubuntu Software Center.) Ask Debian et all to iceweasel (or, inform them the trademark exists.) Ask people to buy the program on the binary builds (repackagers don't actually cut this part out.)\n. ",

    "therealrobster": "Hey there, thanks for the reply @dacap.  This wasn't quite what I meant.  Apologies if I wasn't clearer.\nThe idea is that I could with my left button brush be on say, a green colour.  If I press say L, then it would go slightly lighter shade of green.  If I press L again, it gets another shade lighter.  Each time I press L the shade goes one shade lighter on the selected colour.\nThe alternate is if I pressed say D, and the shade would go darker green.  D again, and another shade of green darker.\nThis way, I can be on ANY colour and just by pressing L and D (or whatever keys are chosen) I can very quickly shade items.\nEDIT: Attached image to show how it could look after painting.\n\n. Just dropping in to see if you think this might end up coming to fruition one day?. This has become one of Krita's most loved tools.  Just checking in, any chance of seeing this in Aseprite?. Sure, so if I for example press L and draw a line.  Then press L again, draw another line.  etc  It will keep drawing one shade lighter than the last time I pressed L.\nThe same for the opposite (D).  It will do a shade darker each time.  \nThis is all based on the colour I choose.  So I may select a nice mid range blue.  Each time I press L and draw it will get lighter and lighter.  Imagine how useful this is for shading work.   \nTake this image for example (not mine)  https://streak.club/img/dXBsb2Fkcy9pbWFnZS81OTg2LnBuZw==/original/HGcl4W.png  You can just keep pressing D as you go to move down a shade level.\nI would not recommend D and L as they're so far apart from each other.  They should be comfortable to have next to each other for moving up and down the shading levels.  I hope that made more sense.... Agreed. When I was writing it out and used that tree image as an example I was considering that.  I guess it could be an option.  How many steps between level changes.  More options = more complication but also allows for a more powerful tool.  I'm sure with testing a happy default could exist.  Then when the tool is selected, just like you have a brush size or brush type option at the top you could have a step count option for any tools that use this option.  I'd imagine you could use it for many.  Pencil, Paint Bucket, Line, Rectangle and Contour.. It does sound good.  For me, as a user painting day to day when on art assets as long as I can press say A to go up a shade and Z to go down a shade then I'm happy.  If it can be tied simply enough to a scripting tool then that's cool also.  Sounds good!. Just checking in to see if this got any love in any recent builds?. ",

    "RandyGaul": "I'm saving with Color Mode as Indexed via Aseprite. They are saved as 8-bit index files already.\nProblem is Aseprite includes unused entries inside of the PLTE chunk of the PNG; this is allowed by the PNG format, but is troublesome for certain use cases. I am currently using this code to post-process a loaded indexed PNG saved via Color Mode->Indexed through Aseprite as a workaround:\n```cpp\ntypedef struct\n{\n    uint8_t r;\n    uint8_t g;\n    uint8_t b;\n    uint8_t a;\n} tdPixel;\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int w;\n    int h;\n    uint8_t* pix;\n    uint8_t palette_len;\n    tdPixel palette[ 256 ];\n} tdIndexedImage;\nuint64_t HashAndRemoveUnusedPaletteEntries(tdIndexedImage* img)\n{\n    int inidices[256] = { 0 };\n    int size = img->w * img->h;\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) inidices[img->pix[i]] = 1;\nint index_map[256];\ntdPixel used_pixels[256];\nint count = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 256; ++i)\n{\n    if (inidices[i])\n    {\n        index_map[i] = count;\n        used_pixels[count++] = img->palette[i];\n    }\n}\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) img->pix[i] = index_map[img->pix[i]];\nimg->palette_len = count;\nfor (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) img->palette[i] = used_pixels[i];\nassert(!memcmp(img->palette, used_pixels, count * sizeof(tdPixel)));\n\nreturn FNV1a(used_pixels, count * sizeof(tdPixel));\n\n}\n```\nCertainly very similar code already exists somewhere in Aseprite, as both the palette editor of Aseprite and the \"Save Palette\" function are not showing unused entries, like in my example images above. Perhaps code for either of these two Aseprite features can be re-used or referenced when saving a PNG with Color Mode->Indexed to remove unused entries from the PLTE chunk of the PNG. Once removed, the indices of the PNG image need to be remapped like in my workaround function.. > From what I can see in this image it's an RGB image, not an indexed one.\nOoh, gotcha! That one was an indexed image, but yes, was saved as an RGBA image. Maybe this is where some confusion came from. Luckily I am not ever using images I am saving with my own tools -- I am only using Aseprite to save images. I made that particular RBGA image just to post here to help explain the problem.\n\nI definitely don't want to remove palette entries that appear in Aseprite's palette editor from the PLTE chunk, just extra ones that do not appear in the editor at all. To be clear in this image, the left-hand side circled is what I would expect to exist inside of the PLTE chunk.\n\nHowever, when I load up this indexed PNG the PLTE chunk contains 15 palette entries, even though in the editor only 5 were showing up. To make it worse, the 5 valid entries are dispersed throughout the 15 entries seemingly randomly. It wouldn't be a big deal if the 5 entries from the image appeared as the first 5 entries in the PLTE chunk.\nIf an artist adds a 6th color to the palette, like this:\n\nThe PLTE chunk in the PNG now contains 18 entries, and not 6. I am asking for the PLTE chunk to contain all 6 colors from the Aseprite palette editor, and no extra ones.\nJust a guess, but it seems like the extra colors in the PLTE chunk were colors I had selected here:\n\nBut never actually placed them in the palette editor.\nUnfortunately my current workaround code I posted earlier will remove this 6th blue color, even though I would love to keep it around. Like you said, artists want to store palettes and keep them in-tact even if not every color was used in a particular image. The problem is currently I have no way to figure out how to keep this 6th color entry just by loading the indexed PNG. There is no way to differentiate the 6th entry from the other extraneous entries.. Ah, I figured it out after looking around in libpng source. Thanks for taking the time to respond! Turns out when I read in the PLTE chunk, the size of the PLTE chunk is number of bytes, which must be divided by 3 to get the number of RGB triplets. It is my error -- I missed this division. This is why the image with 5 entries was reported as 15 upon load, and 6 entries was reported as 18. It was tricky to realize since my code did actually load and display the image correctly, albeit with extra unseen entries. Since the PLTE chunk can have unused entries as defined by the PNG format spec, the only clue was the reported number of entries always being divisible by 3.\nSince you're using libpng when you use png_get_PLTE here, the value is \"PLTE byte length\" / 3. Tracing the call stack from png_get_PLTE I found this line. That num variable eventually gets used in png_set_PLTE here and set to num_palette here. Eventually it gets handed back to Aseprite through png_get_PLTE.. ",

    "yegortimoshenko": "\nThis is because it's a generic EULA. I use the official distributed Aseprite-v...-Source.zip files to compile official distributions anyway so there is no extra code in the binary.\n\nThis is a dangerous restriction. For example, it is not clear whether one can use gdb to trace down a bug without breaking the EULA (probably not, that might count as reverse engineering). It's also not clear whether this clause is compatible with availability of the source code at all.\n\nThe automatic compilation process by third party scripts (this is, if you don't follow the INSTALL.md guide) is not considered that you have compiled the source code. This is a weak point in the EULA which is not well defined (i.e. what does it means that \"you may only compile\" in the 2.g point?).\n\nThis EULA builds up on point that compilation is a time investment. No EULA can enforceably prohibit automated compilation. You could make source code non-redistributable and place somewhere where it can't be automatically fetched, but that would mean abandoning GitHub, and would only add an extra step to automated compilation process.\n\nAt the moment I don't want to make a great deal about it. So if some distribution or people are using these \"shortcuts\" to compile Aseprite, it's ok.\n\nGiven that it's easy to legally circumvent, perhaps it would make sense to not pursue the restriction on distribution at all.\nClearly, people don't distribute such self-compiling version not because of legal reasons, but because they honor your work, and while mostly ignoring your EULA, they respect your intent and want to pay money to the originating developer, i.e. you.\nIt would be nice if you were to respect the users as well.\n\nAt the moment I'll not use the GPL. (I've switched all my open source projects from GPL to MIT too, more freedom for the user and the developer.)\n\nGPL gives freedom to everyone, users and developers alike. Freedom to deny others from freely distributing programs is not really a freedom, it's an exercise of power over other people. See: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html\n\nMaybe in a far future this will be converted to a fully open source license, but that might means something like \"I've just stopped working on this, so now it's all yours\", which could be the worst possible signal for the users (i.e. the program has been abandoned). My plans right now: continue working on Aseprite as much as possible (maybe 10, 15, or 20 years more with this).\n\nWhen software is free, it doesn't mean it has been abandoned and author is no longer interested in enforcing his monopoly on it because it won't be of monetary benefit to him, it only means that author treats users with respect.\nAseprite was under GPL for most of its existence, and no one thought it was abandoned.\n\nThe EULA might change in the future for the better, so it includes your use cases e.g. personal usage might include family usage too, so you can distribute in your family circle. Something to be considered.\n\nGPL is the better EULA. It lifts the circumventable fatal flaw of current EULA, the restriction on distribution of prebuilt binaries, and unlike MIT license, makes sure no one can take business away from you by forking away your code and adding proprietary features.\n\nI hate to be so blunt, but do understand that you are forcing users not to redistribute prebuilt binaries, via state (armed people), because users might suffer consequences if they do. There are numerous alternatives to doing that: for example, ask people not to distribute (and most will respect your request), or make distribution work to your advantage (described above).\nFree software builds on mutual respect and trust, and non-free software builds on power. By imposing EULA, you push the relationship with your users from the former to the latter.\nAlso, I would like to note that I've bought two copies of the program (on Steam), and I wouldn't have bought it if it was proprietary. It saddens me that it has become proprietary, which is why I'm trying to change your mind.. I see. Perhaps you could grant GPLv3-only? The main changes to the license are tivoization clause (i.e. can't run GPLv3-only code on locked down hardware), grace period (if GPLv2 is violated, rights granted by the license are revoked until all copyright holders regrant them, while with GPLv3 there is a period where, if violation is fixed, rights are regranted automatically), and software patent clause (any contributors irrevocably allow to use any patents they might possess to any users of the software).\nThe intent is to try to integrate some LGPLv3 or GPLv3 code into Aseprite. Granting GPLv3 on the old version would allow me to use GTK (or Qt) clipboard code for aseprite/clip without pulling in all other library code, so that I can have clipboard support on Linux (X11) for my use without new dependencies.. > I think that you can integrate GPLv3 code in GPLv2 code.\nUnfortunately, that's only possible if code is under GPLv2-or-later. GPL requires that all source code is available under the same license (which includes license version). See: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility\n\nAnyway, I'll be working on the clip library to add support for Linux in these days, so stay tuned.\n\nI see, thanks!\nHowever, it would still be great to have this code available under GPLv3: X11 clipboard is only one use case (for example, I might also need Wayland clipboard support, which can be mostly copied from Qt or such), and not all code that I might want to change resides in one of your MIT-licensed libraries that I can build GPL'd version with. So, if releasing the old code under GPLv3 is possible, that would be great.\n. ",

For an x64 build use the \"x64 native Tools command prompt\" for both skia and aseprite instead of the one in the instructions.\nFor a 32 build change the target cpu of skia to x86 and use the developer command prompt specified by the instructions.\nThe root cause of this issue was that aseprite is built depending on the environment initialized by the developer tools and the developer tools command that is in the instructions starts in x86, which conflicts with the skia build, that takes an argument..

I use Controls similar as they are in Photoshop:\nMy left hand on the keyboard and use A and D key to move between frames, Space for the Hand-tool (quick) and Ctrl+Space+ leftmouse for Zoom-tool(quick). \nIf you are a gamer, A and D feels very natural, almost like flipping paper pages. And with my right hand, I work with a tablet, so I usually don't have the scroll wheel available. The Preview is always open and playing, so flipping with A and D is more than enough.. Meanwhile, does anyone have a workaround?\nThe thing I constantly need to do is \nI have to delete or flip a small area of a cell, for all cells or most cells of my animation.\nRight now this involves clicking on each cell, selecting lasso tool, drawing a selection of the area I want to flip or delete, press delete.\nUnfortunately, not only can I not do this operation once at how many cells I please, the selection I made with my lasso or rectangular selection tool disappears right after I press delete. So I have to manually make that selection again and again for each and every cell. \nIf you do this once a year on 4 cells it's fine. If you want to work professionally on a few hundred or thousand cells that's simply unfeasible. Even on 20 cells it is quite infuriating.\nSelecting an area within a cell with the selection tool, then a few adjacent cells you want to apply the upcoming delete operation to (selection does not disappears as it would if you would do it the other way round) then pressing delete, also removes unselected parts of the cells, by the way.. Is \"delete\" already implemented like that in v1.2.10-beta4? I mean can I delete multiple Layers at once?. ",

It seems that I should have been using layered frames during these last years instead of layered frameless spritesheets. I can put all NPC (or enemy) directions on each frame, one below the other, and then generate the png spritesheet from there in 1 second. From now on I will always work on framed files, so I won't really need this feature anymore (and therefore it's not urgent for the next version of aseprite).. ",

I can also only use the eraser on the normal wacom pen and the eraser from the other pens such as the airbrush pen doesn't work.\nHere's also a list of things I've tried to fix the issue.\n- Set one of the pen buttons to erase and draw/erase while holding down the button on the pen (didn't work)\n- Disabled Windows Ink (didn't work)\n- Remove the tool from the tablet properties to remove the calibration and other settings (didn't work)\n- Restart the computer (didn't work)\n- Restart the \"Wacom Professional Service\"* service in Window Services while Aseprite is open (works until you re-launch Aseprite)\n*Note: \"Wacom Professional Service\" might also be called \"TabletServicesWacom\" depending on which OS or tablet driver you're using.\nAlso found a weird thing about the possible bug that's always consistent (only if you haven't restarted the wacom tablet service for the temporary fix). If I click out of Aseprite then draw on Aseprite with the eraser side of the pen. It works only once and it doesn't work again until I click out of the application then draw with the eraser side again. This also only works while Windows Ink is enabled.\nI hope this information can lead to a permanent fix..

Could also import a custom icon for the custom tool with an image that is included in the zip file. Also, being able to add to the parameters on the top bar will be, in jmswrnr's words: \"icing on the top\". \nKinda like how you can choose the brush size, tolerance, the contiguous checkbox, etc with the other tools.

    "lrasomattos": "Extruding Tilesets as well (extrude each grid tile)!! \nWe work with Aseprite + Tiled + Unity, and need to go through the whole development with glitchy tiles in Unity, because, although Tiled works with extruded tilesets, it is impossible to edit them quickly and see them updating into our maps. \nFor now we have to use external tools that only extrude the tiles for us. And when we do it, we have to update all the references for Tiled, which is cumbersome during development. So we can only do it before releases.\nIt would be great to just open a tileset.ase edit it, export it and see it update into Tiled already extruded and non glitchy! I have been looking for good editors for tileset textures, and the only reason I'm still looking is because Aseprite doesn't have this option yet. \n. Yes!!\nRemembering that both extrudes/bleed, in between tiles AND in the margins would be really important for seamless tiles.\nAlso I believe it's much better as \"export feature\" instead of an \"edit feature\", but could work as both. Unless you can de-extrude as well, the main idea is to be able to work on tilesets and easily export them extruded, not to keep them extruded which makes it much harder to edit.\nAbout how it would work with animations, I guess what you said is ok. I imagine people won't be making animations when working with tiles, I don't see how it could be useful now... Or if they did, might prefer each frame in a different file.. (Like using one .ase file for many tilesets).\nAlso, I don't know how you handle this normally, but if the preference on how to export the extruded files could be saved per file it would be perfect!\nBy the way, thanks for considering!.

If so, where can I add custom convolution matrices that will persist across updates?\nEDIT:\nI found this code in convolution_matrix_stock.cpp:\ncpp\n  const char *names[] = { \"convmatr.usr\",\n                          \"convmatr.gen\",\n                          \"convmatr.def\", NULL };\nI think this means that a file called \"convmatr.usr\" contains user generated convolution matrices but I don't know where to find that file.\nEDIT:\nI tried creating convmatr.usr and convmatr.gen with test matrices in the same directory as I found convmatr.dat (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Aseprite\\data\\), in %APPDATA%\\Aseprite, and also in %APPDATA%\\Aseprite\\extensions, but nothing worked.  But then I tried upgrading to the beta version (via Steam) and the two files (convmatr.usr and convmatr.gen) in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Aseprite\\data\\ worked!  My guess is that these files are where I am supposed to put my custom convolution matrices; am I correct in that assumption?. ",
    "robotron2084": "oh wow, I can't believe I didn't test that use case. I will code something similar and update the PR.. Got it! I will do my best to follow the style guide.. If that is the better place for this to exist then perhaps I can do that instead. My only thought about that is how best to handle the memory .. I felt a bit dirty const_casting this. I looked for examples of usage with reader.layer() in other commands following the pattern you suggested and didn't find any. I can modify this code to use logic that doesn't cast away the const if you like.. ",
    "dncampo": "IMHO PreferSnapTo::CeilGrid is needed to guarantee the situation of a layer going up to the edge of a grid. For example, look at this sprite of 2 layers:\nLayer 1:\n\nLayer 2:\n\nThe expected output of \"Trim by grid\" should be (I think):\n\nHowever, with the modification you have proposed it produces:\n\nThis is because the layer 1 goes up to the edge of a grid, but there is no need of adding an extra one. Adding + gfx::Point(docPref.grid.bounds().size()), in the snap_to_grid would add the extra grid gap that it is not needed. This is managed in PreferSnapTo::CeilGrid: asking if there is a remainder at the division std::div(point.x-dx.rem, grid.w); (it is the same in the y axis).\n. Done. Done. Done. "
