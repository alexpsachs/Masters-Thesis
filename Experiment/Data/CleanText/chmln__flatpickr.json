    "chmln": "Hi Rafael,\nThe documentation on master repo has been corrected.\nI shall be completing the documentation on the website soon as well.\nThank you for reporting!\n. Hi Rafael,\nYou may now take advantage of the defaultDate option.\nYou can also hardcode self.element.value and then self.redraw().\nAlso, the datepicker now always opens on the selected date (if any), or the defaultDate (if specified), or today's date, when closed and reopened.\n. You might have to refresh the browser cache, I just verified it working on multiple machines.\nLet me know if the problem persists.\n. Hello,\nMake sure you're using the latest version of flatpickr.\nI also made a demo page for this current issue, please verify that its working there.\nThank you. :)\n. I just pushed some changes that should address any issues you might've had.\nCheck it out, update, and let me know :+1: \n. Yes, definitely use self.setDate() for setting dates. \nIt will set the selected date object, and update the input value as per self.config.dateFormat\n. I've addressed some issues in the latest release, please try and let me know if the problem persists.\n. Is there any plans for this kind of feature?\nAlready implemented, along with a few other nifty changes. \nEnjoy\n. Great idea. Will implement in the coming days\n. I've padded days of the next month so it doesn't jump up and down anymore.\nCheers :ok_hand:\n. Thanks for reporting!\nI've just issued a fix. \nIt obviously failed at yr === 1, which should have been checking the month of february.\n. Absolutely. Should be done within a week or so.\n. I'll add the week number tomorrow, the rest is just a matter of layout.\nStay tuned :ok_hand:\n. The layout is radically different so introducing that option is not the way to go unfortunately.\nBut you can still do it.\nHere's a neat way of getting a date's week number. \nYou will probably want to utilize \nnew Date(self.currentYear, self.currentMonth, 1 / 8 / 15 / etc )\nthen add the week number from that date to buildWeekdays()\nReplace array concat with a for loop in buildWeekdays() to show as many weekday labels as you need. Then finally modify the css for table and thead elements to show the thead's inline.\nCheers\n. I've gotten close http://pastebin.com/wbrndPYn\nNow you just gotta align weekdays inline\n. Good call. \nThe calendar is tested and 100% supported on chromium/derivatives, ms edge, and firefox.\nNever had the chance to test behavior in safari as I'm developing from a linux machine, but I will definitely look into it\n. If any new problems with Safari arise, please open a new issue.\nThank you.\n. That's really odd. \nHowever, I couldn't reproduce the bug in any major browser on windows.\nI'll get an OSX VM running to test it myself.\nThanks for the report :thumbsup:\n. There have been some changes to code, please let me know whether the issue is still present\n. I successfully reproduced the bug. will be fixed over the weekend.\nthank you\n. The selection bug is fixed now. \nAnd you're right, dateFormat right now is just used for formatting a picked date from calendar. \nI'll see if its viable to perhaps add a dateInputFormat option.\n. Thanks for the hint about redraw :thumbsup:\nIt was indeed parsing again from a value with a format that javascript's new Date() might not accept, hence the undefined bug.\nEverything should be working correctly now.\n. When preloading it does make more sense to give priority to defaultDate \nas opposed to the value which might be unparseable like in your case. \nI've updated an example on the website to reflect your case. \nPlease verify everything working correctly now.\nAnd thanks for the insight :+1: \n. will be fixed over the weekend. thank you\n. The bug is fixed now. It was easy to reproduce and is verified working now. \nFeel free to download the updated files.\nThanks again for reporting :thumbsup:\n. This might've been the reason for incompatibility with Safari.\nI've just pushed commit 5c17c06e45c366ca3e018497d9835bee60115d1b.\nPlease download the updated .js file(s) and verify that the problem is resolved.\nThank you.\n. Thank you for the insight. \nI've switched to javascript's native utc date implementation.\nPlease see if that resolves the issue\n. Correct. I successfully reproduced the bug myself.\nflatpickr now confirmed working from Amsterdam :star2:\nLet me know if the issue still holds.\nThank you\n. I will publish flatpickr to NPM.\n\nnot a problem that I've created a wrapper\n\nAbsolutely. \nIn fact I'll put up a link to it once I update the homepage\n. Here's the npm package\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/flatpickr\nLet me know if everything works properly.\nThank you\n. I haven't modified the z-index, it is at 100\nHowever, I noticed that flatpickr.min.css has it at 2. \nThis must be related to the css compressor. Fix incoming soon\n. I've switched to gulp-cssmin and z-index in flatpickr.min.css is back to 100 now. \nThank you for the report :thumbsup:\n. Fixed in latest update :)\nThank you for reporting\n. I haven't gotten around to using ember yet, but looks like it is more of an issue with the wrapper/ember rather than the calendar itself, which does work with preloaded values.\nIs there anything in the console?\n@jakkor\n. The calendar is 254px wide and 278px tall, which is small enough even for ancient 320px-wide devices.\nI'd also like to point out that pickadate.js creates an overlay and acts more like a modal window (see below).\n\nI find its better for UX to have the calendar inline. \nAnd even at 320px-wide resolutions, I think input sizes shouldn't be smaller than 255px anyways.\nHowever, if supporting smaller widths is important for your project or you want to make the calendar even smaller, you can easily adjust the slot size in .flatpickr-day at flatpickr_base.less\n. The reason why that happens is because the input and the calendar are wrapped in flatpickr-wrapper which has a relative position, and flatpickr-calendar has\nposition: absolute; top: 100%; left: 0;\nin order to be right below the input. It has absolute positioning so it doesn't make the page jump up and down when opening/closing. So far I haven't found any better solutions\n. I've pushed some commits for responsiveness, please check if the problem is still there\n. There have been major changes to flatpickr's positioning in recent versions.\nIs the issue still relevant ?\n. > But now the calendar popup doesn't follow window resizes. It stays fixed in it's original position. This could be a problem in mobile, when changing from vertical to horizontal layout.\nIndeed. Thanks for letting me know.\nAlready fixed in the latest release\n. Implemented in the latest release. You may find examples and config options on the website.\nIn case of any enhancement ideas or bugs, please open a new issue. \nThank you.\n. Added a border on top, which makes it more noticeable \n\n. I like the idea but I'm gonna leave it at the line for now to look as neutral as possible. (might change my mind later)\nHowever do feel free to adjust the background and color of .flatpickr-time as you wish to match your project color scheme\n. Surely not impossible. I'll most likely switch to am/pm selection by default and additionally provide an option for military time.\nStay tuned\n. And 24-hour dateFormat is still available if needed.\nCheers\n. I've added some background, padding, and border radius resets to avoid or at least minimize some overrides in the future. Thanks for the report.\n. See gulpfile.js:\ngulp.task('less', function () { ...\nJust comment out .pipe(cssmin()).on('error', errorHandler)... and you will get the uncompressed css file.\nI'll also switch to SASS eventually because it seems more popular\n. Fixed. \nThank you for the report, always helpful :+1: \n. I think it only makes sense to use a calendar if it makes date input faster, easier, and avoids scenarios where date isn't typed in correct format etc.\nI think if in certain situations manual input is faster, then there is no need for a calendar.\nI might, however, provide a way to manually control input bindings in the future.\n. It's already possible.\nsee flatpickr.js\nif (selector.nodeName) {\nreturn createInstance(selector);\n}\nSo you can pass either a selector, or the DOM element itself.\n. You could certainly set dateFormat to an empty \"\" string and hide the calendar with CSS, at least for now\n. Added in the latest release\n. Its available at bower as flatpickr-calendar and at npm as flatpickr\n. > available at bower as flatpickr-calendar\nalso\n\nAlso, why not add the css file to \"main\" in the bower.json file so that wiredep can pick it up without overrides?\n\ndone\n. Thanks for the patches!\ncherry picked into e1e6db6bc53c70f1ed13d63bc651f8c47862a48a and 45b26791dd6f54aaf4d4f2d723063d94ac254c8e\n. Please verify the events firing properly now\n. Seems to be working fine, and 1.6.6 is released.\nDespite the createEvent API being obsolete now, I'll keep it for IE11 support until the market share is negligible.\n. \u0417\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430! \nNew option to enable 24 hour time coming very soon.\n. Done. \nYou may now enable 24 hour input by setting time_24hr: false and adjust the output value by setting timeFormat: \"H:i\"\n. @vishnur-github you need to customize dateFormat. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/formatting/. @vishnur-github you're missing altFormat since you're using altInput. Give it the same value as dateFormat and you're good to go. Good idea, but I'm rather hesitant to clutter the calendar UI with extra buttons.\nI'll provide a self.clear() to easily clear self.selectedDateObj, and add an example on the website.\nStay tuned\n. Added in the latest release - see example\n. edit: have you tried using .open() ?\n. Thank you for inspiration. \nI've added custom markup possibility and 4 custom trigger elements: open, close, toggle, and clear.\nCheck out the example on the website!\nIf I left anything unaddressed, feel free to re-open or create a new issue.\n. You have to initialize flatpickr on the following element:\nhtml\n<div class=\"input-group flatpickr\" data-wrap=\"true\" data-clickOpens=\"false\">\nAre you calling flatpickr(\".flatpickr\") ?\n. Thank you for the report.\nDisabled inputs shouldn't have calendars. \nFix coming in the next release, soon.\n. :sunny: Fixed in latest release\n. Thanks for the report!\nAn unnecessary and extra flatpickr object was getting created on altInput.\nAll fixed now :zap:\nhttp://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#defaultdate\nShall any problems arise in the future, please open a new issue.\n. Will definitely add a type='text'.\nI do see a lot of frameworks don't style plain inputs by default.\n. I assume you are using the altInput option ?\n. That's weird, because the directive specifies type text explicitly.\nSeems like rather a problem with ember or the flat-pickr component itself ?\nInput styling is strictly positional and kept to a minimum to be compatible with as many frameworks and environments as possible. Another option from my part is enforcing type text on inputs, but I'm not fond of that either.\n. Yeah, altInput should be just set to true\nSee the example on the website\nI suppose the issue is fixed thanks to @jakkor\nShall any other problems arise, don't hesitate to open a new issue.\nThank you.\n. > Would you mind releasing a version including the onClose code?\ndone\n\nAlso, I see you added Babel. Is the intent to make this into an ES2015 class?\n\nQuite possible. \nRegardless, I aim for all changes to be backwards compatible and will transpile until support is widespread enough\n. Added in v1.7.6\n. IE9 support added and all features verified working.\nIncorporated in the latest release\n. Although everything seemed ok in latest stable firefox, a quick google search reveals that certain versions don't support the innerText property.\nAll instances of innerText have been replaced with innerHTML. :zap:\nPlease verify it working, and I'll draft a new release.\nThank you.\n. Incorporated in the latest release\n. Special minDate value \"today\" was only getting parsed in init().\nObviously, \"today\" is not a valid date string so updating current month/year set those values to NaN.\nI moved parsing to buildDays instead\n. Incorporated into latest release\n. Thanks for the PR!\nAlso see https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/9b910062513a0d6e78b325f76f2db1f346d2cc00\n. Release coming soon.\n. > Would you be interested in some help converting this into an ES2015 class?\nI've already tried it actually, didn't see any practical benefits but quite a few regressions. I saw much more benefit from converting some inner parts (e.g. date formatting) to ES6, and I think that's a better direction.\n\nI think we should write some tests as well\n\nYes, absolutely. I'll incorporate some by the next release and will accept PRs from there\n. Hey, thanks for reporting the issue.\nI've just pushed a new release with improvements that allow passing in time only.\nCheck out the latest release and the updated example.\n. Hey,\nflatpickr works with Vue, without a need for directive.\nI removed the link from readme.\nThanks for the report!\n. Thanks for the report!\nFixed in the latest release\n. Somehow that slipped through. \nFix coming soon, and unit tests on the weekend.\nstay tuned\n. Hello,\nand thanks for reporting the issue!\nThat is certainly not expected behavior. \nAs far as date handling goes, see below:\n\nAll that aside, I could not reproduce the issue.\nIf you could provide a codepen/jsfiddle/etc, I'd have a solution rather sooner than later.\n. For now, due to arbitrary implementations of Date parsers across different browsers, it is necessary that minDate/maxDate are supplied without timezone/time data. Local and UTC date comparisons are pretty much guaranteed to be unreliable.\nObviously, flatpickr could rely on libraries like moment.js etc, but I'd rather not until I figure alternative solutions are non-existent. The aim of this project is to be standalone, lightweight, usable with rich enough functionality for the majority of use cases.\nI will explore solutions, and keep this issue open and updated.\n. https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/9bae58137402c7ff87bb301cd1342457f8437bbc fixed numerous issues. \nPlease check whether the initial problem is still relevant.\nThanks!\n. minDate tested working properly both in UTC (https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/eab4374f59e0122bad7936e566b0e2de9c7065b1#diff-51ad6ed16e74144ae6e17bbd53d35a5bR769) and non-UTC modes :tada:  \nShall any problems arise in the future, feel free to comment and I'll reopen the issue.\nThanks again for the report!\n. If you're just grabbing the date and time from the user and don't care about timezones, the easiest solution I can think of is excluding the timezone information and just provide the date and time.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/bbn3wkLL/2/\nOtherwise, I'd suggest storing the datetime in GMT as a UTC string, which you can obtain by toUTCString() from the date object (which you can grab from onChange (dateObj,dateStr) in flatpickr config).\n. I'll provide an option, something like utc_mode for scenarios like yours, likely in the next release.\nstay tuned\n. Feel free to play with the new UTC option, which should solve your problem.\nShall any issues arise, I'll reopen this thread\n. Thanks for the report!\nFixed and to be included in the newest release (soon). :tada:\nShall any problems or questions arise, feel free to reopen\n. Implemented into latest dev version. Thanks a lot for contribution \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey,\nThanks a lot for the report!\nI successfully reproduced the issue, and it'll be fixed by the next release (very soon).\n. Yes, so far I found the only solution to making a child e.g. .flatpickr-wrapper visible inside an overflow:hidden parent is to give the child position:absolute. This obviously breaks the initial layout. To counter that, I tried dynamically calculating the top position, depending on scrollTop and clientTop etc, but it also has pitfalls.\nIf you know a good way to do it, send a jsfiddle or submit a PR and I'll gladly consider/merge it.\n. Great catch :+1: \nI noticed this exact issue yesterday, and its already fixed as per https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/eab4374f59e0122bad7936e566b0e2de9c7065b1#diff-51ad6ed16e74144ae6e17bbd53d35a5bR382 \nYou can use the latest version until 1.8.3 is released (very soon)\n. Sure would be. \nNo idea how to submit, however:question::grey_question: \n. Submitted :tada:\n. > Adding a robust x-browser date/time parsing library and including that in the project could be helpful. Something like Date.js or Moment should work I suppose.\nYes and that's a very easy solution, but a lot of the moment.js functionality would be unneeded and I'd like to avoid dependencies. \nThat having said, ISO8601 datestrings in format YYYY-MM-DD  (with an hour/time optionally) will be supported 100%. \nFor now, new regex parsing compensates for firefox's backwards date parsing. No problems in other browsers.\n. > Regardless, I don't think that patch fixes all potential issues with this. For one, you should probably wrap Date.parse in a try/catch block, and have a smart fallback if the calendar can't parse the date given. Otherwise, JS errors could prevent other things from happening on the page such as calendar appearing when clicking in the input.\n\nAdditionally, I believe there's nothing in the code that prevents users from typing dates into the input using whatever format they feel like (which they assuredly will do). Without any ability to process those dates, or at least catch the error provided by Date.parse you're going to run into problems.\n\nPretty rare, but I agree with pretty much everything you said.\nI also saw your pull request, gonna merge manually today/tomorrow. \nThanks a lot for input and contribution. \nWill reference this issue as I merge and implement updates.\n. > Using Apple's magic mouse on it is pretty much impossible to scroll just a single year, it just scrolls a bunch of years in a row.\n\nAlso some of our users inadvertently scroll on it and change it when they don't really want to.\n\nWhat about the time picker inputs when enableTime is on ? \nI use input type=\"number\" there. \nI could use it for the year picker as well which would also allow manual input and incrementing by +1/-1\n. > wrap the input\ndo you mean wrap as in the wrap config option or wrap as in creating a wrapper (flatpickr-wrapper) in the DOM around the element? \n. Correct, and that is intended behavior.\nIt gets flatpickr around complex elements, circumventing possible overflow and z-index issues (see #61)\nIs that a problem for your project?\n. Tried to replicate the issue, but everything seems to work properly on my end.\nSee fiddle\n\nPlease provide a broken example in a fiddle so I can investigate and fix the possible issue \ud83d\udc4d \n. Now I see the issue.\nHowever, the latest version seems not to carry those problems.\nReplace the 1.8.4 js with http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.js and everything works properly again.\n. See https://gist.github.com/chmln/ceacabeeb1595adefac911cf01f8e56a\n. All the positioning issues (especially altInput) should be fixed in the latest release\n. Correct, today's date stops getting highlighted as soon as a date is selected/preloaded.\nI'll ensure it is visible always, but perhaps in a bit more subtle manner.\n. > Actually the problem is the demo site using src/flatpickr.js, which does not have transformations.\nCorrect. Demo site is now using the babel-transformed version\nPlease check if the errors are still there. @creep3r @neilbradley \n. Actually, the version field in bower.json is deprecated.\nThe shield in README.md sometimes doesn't work properly. \nPackage itself is fine.\n\n. Scroll on the year with a mouse \ud83d\ude09 \np.s. an even friendlier implementation is coming (see #67)\n. > making this a little more intuitive for users\nabsolutely. \nI'll be posting updates and referencing issue #67 in commits.\nstay tuned for v1.8.5\n. Hello,\nThanks a lot for the report!\nIn the change listener function of cur_year, event.target.value turned out to be a string, thus self.currentYear was being set to a string.\nPushing a commit as we speak and I'll publish a new release asap.\nRegards\n. Fixed \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hello,\nThere is usually only one way that flatpickr is opened - it is triggered by the user.\nAnd since it is opened only after the user has asked for it, the calendar should always be visible.\nI'll increase the z-index to 10000.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue,  and especially for the fiddle.\nPushing a fix as we speak.\n. Here's the same fiddle using the latest version\n. It depends. If you assign the calendar instance to a  variable, you can manually call destroy() e.g.\njs\nvar calendar = flatpickr(\"#calendar\");\ncalendar.destroy();\nIn addition, the old instance gets destroyed when a new one gets created for the same selector. e.g.\n``` js\nvar calendar = flatpickr(\"#calendar\");\n// do something\ncalendar = flatpickr(\"#calendar\"); // old instance is destroyed & new instance is created\n```\n. @inf0rm4tik3r see https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#retrieving-the-flatpickr-instance. > In this way, no matter how we move the input, the picker will follow it.\nI believe the picker in its current implementation still follows the input. \nDid you bump into any problems regarding non-relative positioning ?\n. Just checked out slimscroll. \nProvide me a fiddle and I'll see what I can do :+1: \n. https://plnkr.co/edit/15OowU91xWjV3pW9t65G?p=preview\n. > altInputClass\nYes.\n(unless I come up with a better way)\n. Done\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/76e94febf79f3e36b733aeee1bc74dd394b1935e#diff-51ad6ed16e74144ae6e17bbd53d35a5bR933\n. > But I always get the same error: Uncaught ReferenceError: flatpickr is not defined. Any idea how to correctly use it with webpack?\nIn that case the flatpickr call has to be after document is ready. This depends on the frameworks you possibly use, but usually there is a ready() method available.\nHere's an example using vue.js:\njade\ninput.flatpickr(type='text', data-mindate=\"today\", data-enableTime, placeholder='Due', v-model='due')\nThen for the script\njs\nimport flatpickr from 'flatpickr'\nexport default {\n    ready () {\n        // ...\n        flatpickr(\".flatpickr\");\n    }\n}\n. That'd be in your <template>. \nI use single file components. And obviously convert to HTML if you're not using Jade/Pug :+1: \n\nCuriously I am using vue.js and trying to do a reusable component with flatpickr.\n\nI've been planning to make one but time is unfortunately a finite resource. \n. Hello!\nThat's due to the number input having arrows on the right side, which aren't visible until you hover the element. \nAlso, input elements unfortunately can't be width: auto.\nIf you happen to know a way to center it in a better way, feel free to make a pull request :+1: \n. The capabilities for localization are already there. \nI think the best way to go about translating is to have a .js file for each language in the src folder, where we'd overwrite flatpickr.init.prototype.l10n.\nI definitely need help translating flatpickr into languages other than English and Russian. \nFeel free to make a pull request with flatpickr.l10n.your-native-language.js\n. Hello,\n\nempty input if no value is set by default.\n\nDo you mean clearing the input ?\nInput fields are empty unless they have value or defaultDate\nPlease elaborate on what you're trying to achieve and I'll see what I can do\n. I'm generally aiming for top 10-15 languages.\nFeel free to contribute more if you have time, localization help is very much appreciated :+1: \n. > Why not include firstDayOfWeek in translation?\nCertainly possible. Feel free to make pull requests\n. Incredible stuff. \n. Localization is pretty much complete. \nI might integrate all these into flatpickr so no extra files would have to be included, and provide an option to choose the language.\nDanke!\n. @mgibbs I agree, as most users will need just one language. \nHowever, if I bundled top 5, the added size, minified, would also be negligible. \nBut then most flatpickr users are likely targeting English-speaking audiences.\nI'm going to leave things as they are.\n. No ordinal capability in dateFormat just yet.\nTo be implemented in the next release \ud83c\udf70 \n. Fantastic idea. \nThanks for contributing :+1: \n. Hello,\nThanks for contributing.\nI think its best to keep ordinal numbers as a part of l10n because of the differences in various locales.\nWe can either use arrays to store ordinal days or (preferably) have a function similar to yours. \nI'd go with the function. \n. That's exactly what I had in mind, except the dateFormat function which I can do myself.\nThanks a lot for the idea and your contribution \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hello,\nYes, the default arrows are unicode by default. \nHowever, you can easily override them like I do on the demo page.\n``` js\n// override arrows globally\nflatpickr.init.prototype.defaultConfig.prevArrow = \"\";\nflatpickr.init.prototype.defaultConfig.nextArrow = \"\";\n// make sure to override these arrows before the flatpickr call\nflatpickr(\".calendar\");\n```\n. Hello,\nThanks for contributing. \naltInput, along with a default altFormat exist so users can just throw in data-altinput without having to dive into the formatting documentation.\nA bit redundant ? Maybe. But does it warrant making breaking changes ? Don't think so.\nI'm gonna keep both for now.\n. If you have the flatpickr instance, you should be able to grab directly from altInput e.g. \njs\ncalendar = flatpickr(\"#mycalendar\");\n// ...\nalert( calendar.altInput.value );\n. > You can achieve that using 2 flatpickr inputs, and disabling the start/ending dates via js:\n\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#onchange\n\nYes that's the way to do as of now. I've had a range picker on my mind for a while now, will implement by next release if I think of a decent way to do it\n. Fantastic.\nThanks for contributing :+1: \n. Hello, \nThanks for reporting the issue. \ud83d\udc4d \nThe fix will be included in the latest release, and is already present on the website.\n. Perfect.\nThanks for contributing\n. You have syntax errors in your js.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/bv4adcqh/\n. There is an altInputClass option that precisely targets the problem you're having.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/uqt4qq1a/\n. Yes please\n. Hello,\nThat should be rather easy to implement, as seconds behavior is identical to the one of the minute field.\nStay tuned for the next release\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. @rafael-renan-pacheco it is a  possible solution, but I really dislike the idea of overlaying the calendar. \nIt took me ~10 seconds to find a way to change to a different year.\nThen there's all the clicking around to select the year.\nThen the whole calendar closed after I clicked \"OK\".\nUsing flatpickr, I can simply increment/decrement the input, or scroll, or better yet just type the date out and press enter. \nI'll find a way to properly center and pad the year number instead\n. Please check if this issue is still relevant after https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/79a8e66215bf3748ddfe391d302dcb54d6a17cd8\n. @rafael-renan-pacheco much better than the previous proposed solution. But looks like I've figured the input width out. I'll stick with it unless problems keep persisting.\nYour feedback has been very helpful since the early days.\nI'm gonna close the issue due to no response from the author for a week now.\nFeel free to re-open if the problem is not resolved.\nThank you\n. Hello,\nLink me to the demo, and I'll see what I can do.\n. You can achieve that with a bit of custom scripting and having two flatpickrs with inline:true side by side.\nRest is simply date calculation. I'd suggest utilizing the fp_incr method on Date objects.\nI aim to keep the calendar lightweight, so I unfortunately can't incorporate rather rare use cases.\n. Thanks for contributing :+1: \n. Hello,\nThanks for contributing :+1: \nI believe there is already a French localization present.\nI'd really appreciate if you could add a French ordinal date function, as seen https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js#L913\n. Much appreciated :+1: \n. Merci!\n. Unforunately, this feature requires significant rewrite and is not within the scope of this project.\nThanks for the idea, however \ud83d\udc4d \n. @javeedrahman use showMonths: 2 for multi-month view. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue! :+1: \nThis happens due to the change event that the current year listens to, doesn't fire with every click on the arrows.\nFix incoming.\n. That somehow slipped through.\nAnd thanks!\n. > You can achieve that using 2 flatpickr inputs, 1 for datetime, and 1 for time only.\n\nOr 3 flatpickr inputs, 1 for date, 2 for time range.\n\nYeah, that's the way to go. Use the inline option to reduce the required number of clicks to open the calendar/time pickers. \nI can't think of a user friendly way to incorporate time ranges.\nFeel free to reopen if you have any more questions.\n. @rwwagner90 releasing new version today :cake: \n. Looks good :+1: \nI'll merge and refine over the weekend\n. Fantastic.\nThanks for contributing \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hello,\nfirst:\njs\nflatpickr(\"#myselector\", {\n    minDate: new Date().fp_incr(1)\n}\nsecond: Not possible right now, very possible in the next release.\nthird: https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#disable\n. @SyntaxBlitz Sounds good.\n. Thanks for the idea @SyntaxBlitz \n. Indeed.\nLooking into it\n. > How about selecting the date\nWhen a calendar is open, just press the TAB key \u26a1 \n. Hello,\nThanks for pointing out the issue, I've noticed this problem as well.\nDefinitely some work could be done to make the calendar (and the website) more responsive.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/6bf4659c8f4e3cb42984ed950776ebd1bd153910\n. Should be working correctly now, as seen on demo website.\nPlease reopen if the problem persists.\n. Hello,\nThanks for contributing \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hello,\nThanks for contributing \ud83d\udc4d\nCould you also provide an ordinal function for Polish ?\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js#L946\n. see https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Polish_ordinal_numbers\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. If you use Ionic, I'd suggest sticking with native datetime calendars - both Android and iOS have moreorless decent implementations.\nIf you do want to use flatpickr regardless, you have to include the flatpickr.min.js and flatpickr.min.css in your index.html, then follow the basic example on the demo page.\n. Feel free to reopen the issue if you run into any problems.\n. You're probably missing the function call.\nAdd this to your template, where you want the calendar input to appear:\nhtml\n<input type=text class=flatpickr placeholder=\"Select date\">\nAnd to the bottom of the template:\njs\nflatpickr(\".flatpickr\");\n. Hello,\nThanks for contributing \ud83d\udc4d \nCould you also provide an ordinal function for Dutch ?\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js#L946\n. Dank je!\n. Looks good \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hello,\nThanks for a much needed angular addon. :+1:  Angular 1.x is still quite popular.\nI'll definitely add a link to the README.\nWhat are your thoughts on angular 2 ?\n. @agaurav Much of the source code is already in ES6. \nI converted the plugin to an ES6 class at some point, but there were more cons than pros, so I kept the current implementation.\nAlways interesting to hear some insights. Link will be in readme soon.\nThanks for contributing.\n. Thanks!\n. Hello,\nThanks for pointing out the issue.\nThat is due to the year number having an input event listener.\nI'll see if the behavior could be improved\n. > Already said in #22\n. Hello,\nThanks for contributing :+1:\nCould you also provide an ordinal function ?\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js#L949\n. > so i think this is enough isnt it?\nYes. Just add another commit with the ordinal function and we're good to go :+1: \n. Perfect.\nThank you!\n. Hello,\ndateFormat is not used for parsing date string from value attributes and defaultDate option.\nThe date you put in the value attribute has to be a valid date string. \nReplace the dots with slashes or dashes such as 13/10/2010 or 13-10-2010 and it will work :+1: \n. Correct. I strongly recommend using ISO8601 format YYYY-MM-DD for consistency across browsers.\nFeel free to re-open the issue if you run into other problems.\nThanks!\n. > Already said in #103\n. Looks ok here\n\n. > beginning time of a day should be 00:00, isn't it?\nYes you're right, but I chose 12 because its halfway through the day. \nThat way any hour is at most 12 apart, and its also closer to typical business hours\n. > I didn't set the time,and pick 2016-06-29 to 2016-06-30.\nIt sounds like time picker isn't really necessary in your case, why not use just date pickers ?\nDatetime pickers are for selecting a date and a time. \nMost default the time to user's current time. flatpickr defaults to a sensible time - middle of the day.\nGoing to keep things as they are now, but might consider resetting to 00:00 in the future.\nThanks for contributing \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thanks!\n. Hello,\nYou mean manual date input into the calendar.\nI considered it at some point but then realized that manual input clashes with the purpose of the date picker, that is picking dates without having to type them out.\nYear changing is lightning fast. Changing months - any month is at most 6 clicks away (e.g. from june to december), since months wrap around January. Selecting a date takes a click.\nThat having said, I will still consider manual input, and keep this issue open for now :cake: \nThanks for contributing :+1: \n. Manual date input has been available for over a year now with the allowInput option. If you are experiencing problems with it, please open a new issue.\nThank you.. Hello,\nThe value indeed was hardcoded, and needs to be localized.\nThanks for contributing :+1: \n. Hello,\nThanks for pointing out the issue!\nAlready fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/27106f32a1e770114ca4a3c1be70beffae0b79dc\n. Hello,\nThanks for pointing out the issue! Everything should be working fine now. \nJumping from flatpickr input to another using the TAB key is still broken in IE (after multiple rigorous attempts), so I'm just gonna leave it there since its not a critical issue.\nFeel free to reopen the issue if I missed anything.\n. Hello,\nUnforunately there isn't a nice way to bundle the stylesheet along with the script in webpack..yet.\nYou'll need to require the stylesheet explicitly, e.g.\njs\nrequire(\"flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.css\")\nas seen in https://webpack.github.io/docs/resolving.html\n. Hello,\nFiring onChange sounds good. \nYou can check if the dateobj is null/undefined to catch the clear action\n. I'm completely inept when it comes to RTL.\nPull requests are welcome\n. Hello,\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/tree/master/dist/rtl. Also note that this is the initial version.\nPlease report here if there are any issues. Closing due to inactivity.\nThe RTL versions are not perfect, and while lacking competency in subject I'll happily accept future PRs that fix any issues. :+1: . @kfirba I am revamping the build system. RTL will be included in the next release. Hello,\nThanks for the warm words and your ideas. \ud83d\udc4d \nThe days of previous and next months were initially added for cosmetic purposes, to have a fixed number of rows and provide visual guidance. I can and will make them selectable.\n\nothers were struggling to find a way to switch the month.\n\nI find the arrows in the top left and right corners rather obvious. If they are not obvious enough, you are free to specify the words 'Next' and 'Prev' in prevArrow and nextArrow config options, or better yet, use your own icons as I do on the demo page.\n. Hello,\nYou're correct, thanks for pointing out the typo \ud83d\udd0e \nFixed now, and gonna update the documentation soon\n. Hello,\nusing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar for reference\n99.9% of users aren't going to use a Jalali calendar.\nI aim to keep the calendar lightweight thus I can't unforunately implement this rather specific use case\n. Hello,\nI've explored those options, and found the current way the easiest to use\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue! \nThe proposed solution works perfectly.\n. onChange has two callback params - dateObj and dateStr. \ndateObj is the current selected date object, a javascript Date object.\n dateStr is the date formatted as per the dateFormat option.\n. Both refer to the same object. \nAnd obviously there are likely to be differences, depending on the dateFormat used, and regarding Date parsing inconsistencies across browsers.\nI don't see a point in creating a new Date object from the date string though ?\nIf you need a time stamp or any other information, grab it from the date object. \n. A Date object includes information like timezone, whereas date strings get parsed into local time, hence the difference in the timestamps.\n\nHowever the real value user just input is parameter n\n\nYou should use the date object. Trying to create one from the formatted date string will not always work, may be incorrect if it does work, or may not work at all.\n. I just looked over your code again.\nInstead of \njs\nconst val = (new Date(n)).valueOf();\nYou should have\njs\nconst val = d.valueOf();\n. onChange issues are already fixed in the latest version (releasing soon).\nPlease re-test using https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.js, and reopen the issue if problems persist.\nThank you\n. Hello,\nThanks for the feedback!\nUse this solution until I implement the feature\njs\nflatpickr(\".flatpickr\", {\n  disable: [\n    function(dateObject){\n        var enabledDates = [\"2016/07/16\", \"2016/08/20\"];\n        for(var i = 0; i < enabledDates.length; i++)\n            if(dateObject.getTime() === new Date(enabledDates[i]).getTime())\n                return false;\n        return true;\n    }\n  ]\n});\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/w35mtegh/\n. You must be using a browser that persists the input value on page reload. Input values are not always parseable. \nThis is not an issue with flatpickr. That having said, invalid values shouldn't crash the calendar regardless.\n. What kind of changes would you need to make to the formatDate function?\n. Closing due to inactivity. Feel free to reopen\n. @sijad there are already hooks for months and years, you can use them to update the values immediately. See onMonthChange and onYearChange here https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/events/. Hello,\nThanks for pointing out the issue.\nI've successfully reproduced it myself, and a fix is coming soon.\n. https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/fjmeg996/2/\n. Welcome.\nThanks again for reporting the issue \ud83d\udc4d \n. @parweb  https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/fjmeg996/2/  fixed\n. @parweb welcome. thanks a lot for pointing out the issue\n. @bitcity the flatpickr css used in external resources is from an older version.\nEverything works fine using the latest CSS \nSee http://jsfiddle.net/chmln/894n1gnm/\n. @jaredatch @LuxsysApps I'm planning on restoring the input/calendar wrapper from v1 for static calendar. will keep the issue updated.. Resolved by the re-introduced static option. @ThakkarHardik @youyouzh please create new issues if you experience any problems. thank you. Hello,\nI've already stumbled upon this and its already fixed in the latest revision.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/yLy9qkzp/1/\n. https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/103d280388cc859fd0adfee83c6a1dff652992b2 :v: \n. @iKlsR could not reproduce on the latest release. provide a fiddle ? :+1: \n. > I've also noticed that there a few other options that aren't documented. Should I add them? Or are they meant to undocumented?\nPretty please.\nI've been very busy and documentation has been a little neglected.\nThere are some formatting symbols missing, along with a couple of options.\nHelp is very much appreciated as I spend more time perfecting the calendar\n. Hello,\nThat's definitely a shortcoming. \nHowever, I don't think adding an option like altTimeFormat is a solution. \nI'm most likely going to remove timeFormat, and make it a part of dateFormat/altFormat instead\n. p.s.  make sure to escape the characters in dateFormat.\nInstead of\naltFormat: 'F J, Y at H:i K',\nyou should have\naltFormat: 'F J, Y \\\\a\\\\t H:i K',\n. > Is this what you're meaning? \nYes, because even if a character is not currently a format character, it may become one in the future.\n\nI ask because the example only escapes characters that are format chars.\n\nThe documentation definitely needs some updates. Gonna get to it after the next release :hourglass_flowing_sand: \n. > I'm having the same problem. I have yet to find a full working example of the onChange event in flatpickr. Could someone post one?\nhttp://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#onchange\n\nI've hacked this in:\nvar picker = flatpickr('....', {\n    onChange : function() {\n        picker.calendars[0].input.value = 'test';\n    }\n});\nBut I'm pretty sure that'll break. Is there a cleaner/correct way?\n\nTo target an onChange of a specific calendar, you need its flatpickr instance.\nEither you have something like \njs\nflatpickr(\"#check_in_date\", {\n    onChange: function(dateObj, dateStr) {\n        console.info(dateObj);\n        console.info(dateStr);\n    }\n});\nOr do something like \njs\nvar calendars = flatpickr(\".flatpickr\"); // multiple instances\ncalendars.byID(\"myCalendarID\").config.onChange = function(dateobj, datestr){\n    console.info(dateobj, datestr);\n}\n. You could do it in a few ways.\njs\nvar check_in = flatpickr(\"#check_in_date\");\ncheck_in.config.onChange = function(dateObj, dateStr){\n    // use check_in.input or check_in.element\n}\nOr\njs\nvar calendars = flatpickr(\".flatpickr\"); // multiple instances\nvar specific_calendar = calendars.byID(\"myCalendarID\");\nspecific_calendar.config.onChange = function(dateobj, datestr){\n    console.info(dateobj, datestr);\n    console.info(specific_calendar.input);\n}\n. > Btw, all this won't matter once the dateFormat option supports time. \nIt already does since https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/890698e7ddd9091db072f5a1814584aaf70758fa\n. Thank again for contributing :+1: \n. Plain awesome, everything looks good. \nThanks a bunch, help with docs was much needed\n. > Seems to be the common practice on my other npm included files.\nGood point. Never really noticed it until now. \nMost people using require bundle it and minify it anyway.\n. Hey,\nThanks for pointing out the issue, and the jsbin example.\nInvestigating as we speak\n. Already fixed in latest version, awaiting release.\nI've addressed onChange issues by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/b7a342e14242623b970a91f7d1464b0f2bc91389 and https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/3238376d0966cd71fb70c2c9937de4fe182cfdaa\n. Hello,\nUnfortunately I don't possess any iOS devices which means I can't reproduce these problems myself. Could you please check if there are any errors in the console?\n\nWindows phone with IE-mobile\n\nflatpickr supports IE9 and up. If it doesn't work on IE-mobile, please post the console log so I can investigate and solve the problem.\nEverything works fine on Chrome on Android.\n. Actually, flatpickr is not really meant to be used on mobile devices yet (tablets are ok).\nThe current implementation is for desktop browsers and is not user-friendly enough for mobile.\nHowever, I'm planning mobile compatibility eventually, ideally utilizing native calendar/time inputs.\nWill keep this issue updated.\n. Should be fixed now.\nPlease test if there are any more errors.\nMuch appreciated :+1: \n. rc.4 didn't contain the fix.\nTry reinstalling (rc.5 is out now)\n. Commit https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/22637ccb2d7484df06d3617534df050d8f1b739a simplifies the mobile input logic and fixes a couple of bugs.\nPlease test again with the latest version.\n:facepunch: \n. @zlepper Thank you for the info on browserstack :+1: \nI've applied for a subscription.\nAll iOS issues will be resolved shortly after I gain access.\n. This happens because the modal is initially hidden.\nYou can correct the behavior by setting the static option to true\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/fjmeg996/3/\n. > I can use parseDate option, but your lib is changing my function to a boolean because of parseConfig:226\nfixed\n. Of course. No ETAs, however.\nif you want, you can use the latest version in the meantime\n. Hello,\nI've deliberately made the time picker as simple as possible, avoiding such things exactly.\nIf a user wanted to increment the hours, he'd increment the hours.\nI'm gonna leave the time picker as is.\n. Agreed - the number input implementations across browsers are inconsistent at best - in terms of both design and behavior. \nI will add +- buttons with icons that can be customized.\n\nosx peripherals scrolling with mouse is way too fast.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a mac to play around with scrolling events and behavior. All the scrolling action happens in the timeWrapper function, where I do attempt to stabilize the scrolling amount. \n@mgohin @andrewmclagan I'm also contemplating bundling a few svg icons instead of current unicode versions. They'd increase the css size by a few kilobytes, but the calendar will look much more polished out of the box. Any opinions?\n. > Or at least add an option to replace those templates, for me I would use font-awesome icons, IE is a pain in the ass for svg\nAbsolutely. They will be similar to the prev/next arrow icons, where you can insert your own html for icons.\n. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all have arrows on their inputs and I've restyled them to ensure they display correctly in 2.0.\nI don't find it is worth to reimplement features as of now already existing in latest browsers, or that will exist in the near future (MS Edge)\n. Hello,\nThanks for the warm words, and for contributing! :+1: \n. Not sure why you'd wanna do that but here\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/wL46yhb6/\n. Absolutely. I'll document all the available methods very soon :+1: \n. Hello,\n\nAny thoughts on setting up an hours only time picker?\nI see that setting dateFormat to 'h' for example will stop displaying the minutes, but the time picker still shows minutes, and onChange dateObject still registers a change in minutes. Do you think there should be an option to remove minutes from the picker? or should the picker adapt to what is used in dateFormat?\n\nWhile I wouldn't provide an option, it should certainly be possible. \nAs of now, there isn't a nice way to do it on a per-instance basis.\nBut, with some css work and a few more exposed elements it will be much easier.\nHere's the plan:\n- flex layout for time picker elements, so when one of the elements is hidden, the layout is still flexible and centered\n- expose hourElement, minuteElement, amPm, etc so you'll be able to do something like calendar.minuteElement.style.display = 'none'\n\nPS. what a fantastic project this is\n\n:facepunch: \nStay tuned\n. Obsolete with the new v2.0 syntax\n. Fantastic stuff, props for not only identifying the problem, but also solving it.\nThanks for contributing :+1: \n. @fundon that's a classList polyfill for IE9\n. Definitely not, but I couldn't reproduce it on the demo page.\nHow did you do it?\n. Please check if the issue is resolved \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thank you!\n. Hello,\ntimeFormat has been deprecated. Please use dateFormat instead.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/ggakweff/\n. > When noCalendar options set and enableTime not set \nThen you have neither a calendar nor a datepicker, which is rather pointless.\nI'll make sure it does snot crash self.open, however\n. Thank you :+1: \n. Hello!\nYou're right, there was a problem with manual input that is already resolved and awaiting release (soon).\nIf you need the option right now I can suggest using the latest version until I release a new one.\n. Hello,\nHere's a fiddle incorporating your functions.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/8w4tz7o7/1/\nNote that while UTC mode will have the correct representation, the timezone from getTimezoneOffset()  will still be non-UTC\n. You mean as a format symbol?\n. > As an aside, it'd be great to have a CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repo. I might submit a PR for this issue if I find the time and you're willing to accept it, but I'm not sure what your preference is in terms of building (do I submit the dist files in the PR too?) \nSure, yes, and yes.\n\nWhat the license on my contribution would be.\n\nSame as flatpickr's license - MIT\n. Hello,\nI'm afraid that's out of flatpickr's scope.\nHowever, you can do just about anything with the events API.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/yp2ehykz/\n. Could not reproduce it in Chrome. Are you using Safari?\n\nMy suggestion would be to drop number inputs all-together and go for a validated text-field with manually implemented (DOM) + / - controlls\n\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/174#issuecomment-234452023\n. Is the issue still relevant?\n. Hello,\nHere's a fiddle that accomplishes what you need\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/12rwyrsg/1/\n. Hello,\nI will add an onReady event\n. > Hello.\n\nThank you! You're really fast!\nBut now localisations is broken)\n\nYeah, that's from the upcoming shiny new version of flatpickr. Not too far from release :sunflower: \n\nAnd one another question: is it possible to give ability to change hours/minutes with external elements?\n\nYes\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/a94jsq4z/\n\nFor now even if I'll use wheel to change hours/minutes no events triggers (only when I'll focus out inputs). Is it possible to trigger something like \"update_value_from_calendar\" event manually?..\n\nThe change event won't trigger unless a date is selected and the date differs from the previous. flatpickr v2.0 already has an exposed event API where you can trigger events yourself if you want \n. Hello,\n\ndisable next n workdays;\ndisable weekdays x, y, z on odd weeks, and a, b, c on even weeks;\n\nAlready possible with functions, there plenty of examples on the demo page.\n\ndisable night hours (e.g. only enable 9 - 5);\n\nSounds good.\n\nfeed a list of unavailable times per day, eg: sunday 21 august 2016: 11h30 - 30 min => it should then disable any time picker options in that range.\n\nComplex and will be unused by most users, and thus outside of flatpickr's scope\n. Closing the issue for now.\nI will reference it in a commit when I add customizable min/max time.\nThanks for your ideas \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yes\n. The version on the website is using the exact same code as the npm package. I'm suspecting it could be an npm cache issue.\nTry running npm cache clean before installing again.\n. Hello,\nTheoretically that is possible.\nCould you give me an example where such functionality is needed?\n. Looking into it.\nStay tuned :cake: \n. I'm convinced.\nSomething like minDateTime will be implemented by next release :zap: \n. Hello,\nFew pros of letting user close the calendar himself:\n- when a user selects a date then changes his mind, he doesn't need to reopen the calendar\n- user decides when to close the calendar, and will do whenever he's done, not by an arbitrary decision of a script\nWith a simple click outside the calendar closing it, I see no issues here going forward\n. I'm convinced. Thanks for the input :+1: \n. See #806. Hello,\nYes, an input is necessary.\nflatpickr v2.0+ will likely feature a range picker.\nI'd suggest waiting and implementing it using two inputs if its needed urgently.\n. Hello,\nThat's weird indeed.\nI couldn't reproduce it with a fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/qu8zgxhd/\nI'm guessing absolute positioning is the culprit. The static option should help.\njs\nlet timeSettings = {\n    ...\n    static:true \n};\n. Closing due to inactivity.\nFeel free to re-open as necessary :spaghetti: \n. Hello,\nI think highlighting the current date is enough. \nI'd also like not to complicate the interface and keep it as simple as possible.\nBut hanks for the idea regardless :+1: \n. You could reset the view to the current month using the event API.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/9052f5e7/1/\n. Hello,\nJust noticed it now. To be fixed asap with a new release.\nStay tuned\n. Fixed in v2.0\n. Hello,\nThanks for the suggestion!\nThere are much better-looking ways to clear the date than that.\nI'd like to keep the interface as simple and uncluttered as possible.\n. I don't think its crucial enough to include it in the UI.\nIf you really need one - you may implement one in various ways - if you like that gif just position:absolute an icon over the input\n\nNative HTML5 date fields\n\nExcluding mobile, these are terrible in all aspects\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue!\nI have noticed myself while developing flatpickr 2.0 and its already fixed.\nI strongly suggest upgrading to get the bugfix along with many other improvements.\n. Could not replicate in the most basic fiddle.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/ptckjomz/\nPlease post the code where you instantiate flatpickr, and any relevant event API hooks\n.

Hello,\nFlatpickr is still dedicated to support IE9+.\nAs you may have noticed, there are various ways to instantiate Flatpickr. \nIf you need to support IE < 11, I can suggest two things:\n- Instantiate using doc.getElementById/getelementsbyclassname\n- Use an object instead of data attributes to set options ( dataset is not present in IE9/10 and the polyfill is too heavy to include)\n. Hello,\nWhile that is strange, you could always pass in options with an object\n. Thank you!\n. Can be done using dateFormat/altFormat instead\n. Hello,\nPlease note the new syntax for creating Flatpickr instance(s) - a simple fix in your case.\njs\ndocument.getElementsByClassName(\"datepicker\").flatpickr({\n    altInput: true,\n    altFormat: \"l j M Y\",\n    altInputClass: \"form-control\",\n    dateFormat: \"Y-m-d\",\n    weekNumbers: true,\n    minDate: \"today\",\n    disable: [\n        {\n            from: \"today\",\n            to: new Date().fp_incr(2)\n        },\n        function(date) {\n            return date.getDate()%2 > 0;\n        }\n    ],\n    maxDate: new Date().fp_incr(60)\n});\n. >  But why doesn't the jQuery method (also listed on that page) work?

Hello,\nAbsolutely.\nrequire() already works. Just require(\"flatpickr\") and you're good to go\n. @mgibbs189 is right.

Done.\nThere are now two ways to localize\n1) Including on the webpage after flatpickr.js\n2) In environments e.g. webpack\njs\nimport Flatpickr from 'flatpickr'\nFlatpickr.localize(require('flatpickr/src/flatpickr.l10n.ru.js'));\n. @eZ0 \njs\nconst Flatpickr = require(\"flatpickr\");\n// ....\nconst fpInstance = new Flatpickr(element, config);\nI'm also remaking the docs website which will be much more helpful\n. Here's an example of how I use it in Vue.js/Webpack environment. This is for flatpickr v2.0.\n1) Import the lib\njs\nimport Flatpickr from 'flatpickr'\n2) Then you need to include the styles - I simply grab it from the node_modules directory. This example uses stylus. If you don't, you could simply include the flatpickr.css from dist\nstylus\n@require \"../node_modules/flatpickr/src/style/flatpickr.styl\"\n3) Markup your input using the v-el directive. Here's an example\npug\ninput(\n    type='text',\n    v-el:due-date,\n    ...\n)\n4) Instantiate Flatpickr\n``` js\n    ready () {\n        ...\n        new Flatpickr(this.$els.dueDate, {\n            enableTime: true,\n            dateFormat: \"Y-m-d H:i\",\n            onChange: (dateObj, dateStr) => this.newSet.due = dateStr\n        });\n},\n\n```\n. See #170 \n. Hello,\nThe date string supplied in input's value or the defaultDate option must have days come after months come after years, regardless of your chosen dateFormat\n. @mgibbs189 Thanks for the support and the helpful issue responses :+1: \n. Hello,\nminDate is defined as the minimum date, inclusive, that user can select.\nIt makes sense then, to explicitly show the user the minimum date he can select.\nFrom a UX perspective, going an extra month ahead would be a rather bad practice.\nIt would also be an option that most flatpickr users would not need.\nAppreciate the contribution :+1: \n. > Every other major date picker that I've used (Trent Richardson's JqueryUI date picker and the Eonasdan Bootstrap3 datetimepicker) allow this configuration to be set. \nWith a goal to stay lightweight and simple, flatpickr can't employ config options for specific use cases.\nYou may still achieve what you want, using the flexible APIs.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/9epkzep6/\n. > it keeps the flatpickr height consistent by forcing 6 rows.\nexactly. Before we had the calendar jump up and down depending on the number of days.\nAnd I think its nice to have some days from previous and next months as a guide\n\nthat is quite a lot so can I disable this?\n\ncss\n.flatpickr-days span.nextMonthDay {\n    display: none;\n}\n. Looks good.\nYou could add another button e.g. 'Done' in the right corner, and have clear in the left corner.\n. Please elaborate on the problem and reopen the issue\n. Thank you :+1: \n. https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/8L49x5jp/1/\n. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#options\nSee altInputClass, or data-alt-input-class\n. Hello Michael,\nI had this issue myself in a project that modified the REM size.\nThis is already fixed and published on npm @ flatpickr#next\n. > I'm using cdnjs\nhttps://npmcdn.com/flatpickr@next\n. Thank you :cocktail: \n. https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js#L1146\n. Hello,\nThis is because the only way to trigger date/time input in mobile Safari/Chrome is by user focusing on the input. \nBefore that, I was using a hack to programatically focus on a hidden datetime input. Unfortunately, this only worked in mobile Chrome, and not Safari.\nThe picked date/time is still formatted as per dateFormat, and you may use the event API to display the selected date somewhere else if you want.\n. Thank you! :facepunch: \n. Hello,\nUnfortunately, timezones in JS dates can't be reassigned like days or hours.\nWith flatpickr, despite the timezone remaining unchanged, you still get the correct number of milliseconds.\n\n. Props for the updated test cases :facepunch: \nI had to tweak the time regex and cleanup the code a little bit, but its looking much better now.\nI've also updated the examples on the demo page.\nThank you for contributing\n. js\n...onReady: function(dateObj, dateStr, fp) {\n    fp.altInput.required = \"required\";\n}\n. Hello,\nLooks okay on the demo page.\nShow me your screenshot / demo where it isn't centered properly.\nThank you\n. With flex updates, should be fixed in the latest version.\nFeel free to reopen if the problem persists\n. Hello, \nThanks a lot for reporting this issue, and for contributing. :+1: \nAs you noted correctly, the solution was simply removing month calculation, as it already takes place in changeMonth()\n. A backwards-compatible 2.0 will be released soon\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue.\nLooking into it\n. Could you post the error stack trace?\nThank you\n. Hello,\nProvide the code you use that does not work, and I will help you out.\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue.\nI replicated it successfully and a fix is coming today\n. Hello,\nThe date string supplied in input value must be a parseable date string, with delimiters between Y m d etc.\n\nWhile flatpickr doesn't have advanced datestring parsing capabilities, you may still use the date format you desire, if you really want, by hooking up moment.js or another datestring parsing library (I recommend fecha) and using the parseDate option\n. Hello,\nIn that case, I don't think you need flatpickr's capabilities - a simple select for the month and a number input for the year will do the trick for you.\nBut still, if you'd like to hide the days on the calendar:\ncss\n.flatpickr-rContainer {\n    display: none;\n}\n. Hello,\nIt's up to you to style the inputs - including datetime, which is more often than not ignored by frameworks.\nThe lack of a placeholders is an implementation flaw from browsers, and not the fault of my library.\nEven with all of that in mind, native datepickers are much more usable than even the most responsive desktop counterparts.\nFor now I can only suggest using labels instead of placeholders, and extending input styles to the datetime-local, time types\n. Hello,\nIt should certainly be possible to implement such functionality, ideally through a plugin.\nI glanced over the jqueryUI datepicker plugin source code, and it is really messy (surprise).\nI think adding hooks into functions such as selectDate, updateValue etc would be a good start.\nThe rest wouldn't be too complex.\nThank you for the idea.\nI'll reference this thread in future commits\n. Definitely.\njs\nself.isMobile = !self.config.disableMobile && \nself.config.mode === \"single\" && \n!self.config.disable.length && \n!self.config.enable.length && \n/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\n. @thisislawatts thank you very much for the idea\n. Hello,\nYes, Flatpickr is aimed to support IE9+\nI'm in the process of moving so it might be another day or two until I setup my pc and fix the issue\n. Hello,\nd/m/Y is not a standard date format and thus is not supported by flatpickr.\nAs you've noted, a parseDate function can be used if you need to use such formats.\np.s. if you find moment js too bloated, I recommend https://github.com/taylorhakes/fecha\n. Hello,\ndateFormat has been taken into account for a while now since v2 and all formats should just work.\nI believe this issue is not relevant anymore.\nIf you run into problems with date formats, please don't hesitate to open a new issue.\nThank you.. @vaultdweller123 flatpickr works with any date format since v2. Just make sure you set the dateFormat option to \"d/m/Y\". Thank you for contributing :+1: \n. Hello,\nFantastic job on creating a wrapper for Vue. \nI use Flatpickr in all my Vue projects, with an onChange callback - but this is much cleaner.\nMy only suggestion is to install Flatpickr from npm as a dependency, so you can import the latest version along with localization files and CSS\n. Hello,\nThank you for the idea.\nAlthough I'm very busy currently due to a couple of deadlines approaching for some of my projects, I will have time to work on flatpickr after the weekend.\nWill implement this by the next release of 2.0.\n. See #275 \n. Now possible in time picker mode:\njs\n{\n    noCalendar: true,\n    enableTime: true,\n    minDate: \"2:30 PM\",\n    maxDate: \"9:30 PM\"\n}\nAnd for specific dates:\njs\n{\n    enableTime: true,\n    minDate: \"2017-1-1 2:30 PM\",\n    maxDate: \"2017-1-2 9:30 PM\"\n}. @Hart2014 please open a new issue with a fiddle. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue.\nI'm guessing it is babel adding the strict declaration.\nWill find a way around it to make flatpickr as compatible as possible.\n. Hello,\nTo be honest, I don't find this a necessary, or even very usable to be worth the effort of implementing.\nAlso, a lot of clicking there, and no options of direct input.\nA couple of selects would be much easier to use\n. Now that scrolling is removed, let's make this happen :). Hey all, I wish I could provide an ETA but I can't at the moment. It will be as soon as I can get some chunk of free time, within a month or two. Extremely busy at the moment in my final year at university.\nIf anyone wants to work on this - please go ahead, but keep it plugin-based as flatpickr core should not get any larger.\nThank you all for patience. :). > Is jquery included before flatpickr?\nA fiddle would also be helpful\n. Seems to be an issue with foundation, rather than flatpickr.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/yrg2328b/\n\n. @yzaripova I'd suggest upgrading to v2.0\nThe syntax in 1.9.1 is flatpickr(selector)\nAlso, in your fiddle you're linking to github directly, which results in the script refusing to load - check the console.\n. See http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#disable\n. See #275\n. @jfeust \n\nIs there a reason you are transfering the placeholder value to the hidden input\n\nOf course, its done so that if you have an input say\nhtml\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Select Date\">\nYou get an altInput with the same placeholder, instead of an empty text input element.\nWhile its a shame that IE11 can't handle them, its not a reason to penalize all other users too.. Hello,\nAnd thank you for contributing :+1: \n. Recent commits have addressed a number of issues in IE/Edge.\nPlease verify that everything is working correctly\n. All issues with IE are fixed as of 2.0.1 and the library is compatible down to IE9.\nPlease file a new issue if you encounter any bugs, now or in the future.\nThank you\n. js\nvar calendar = new Flatpickr(document.getElementById(\"flatpickr\"));\ncalendar.config.minDate = new Date();\n// or \ncalendar.set(\"minDate\", new Date());\nAlso see Event API\n. Sounds good\n. @hallaathrad \n\nEdit: The issue seems to be the Date constructor attaches the local time zone as default; while creating an UTC string, well, creates a string but not an object. Perhaps the output from this fp_toUTC() could/should be the UTC miliseconds? This would allow for easy translation to other time zones, methinks.\n\nIf milliseconds are needed, its trivial to just .fp_toUTC().getTime().\n\nCool component, @chmln! Let me grab a beer for you one of these days for this, if you're still in the 6.\n\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/package.json#L59\n. If you'd like to display the date in local time but later somehow use the UTC equivalent, here's an example:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/ov1nw2u2/2/. Hello,\nAlthough lacking some advanced features, the native mobile datetimepickers are much better in terms of design, general ease of use, validating input, etc.\nminuteIncrement is used in timeWrapper(), which is an event handler for mouse scroll events on time inputs. This is obviously unsuitable for mobile devices. minuteIncrement is also not meant to be enforced, so users can input whatever time they need.\nI strongly suggest not enabling disableMobile unless its absolutely necessary\n. There's a way to enforce this now:\n```js\n{\n    enableTime: true,\n    minuteIncrement: 15,\n    onChange (dstr, dobjs, fp) {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            const d = fp.latestSelectedDateObj;\n            const mins = d.getMinutes();\n        if (mins % 15)\n            d.setMinutes(15*Math.round(d.getMinutes() / 15));\n\n        fp.setDate(d, false);\n    }, 1000)\n}\n\n}\n. js\nvar calendar = new Flatpickr(....)\ncalendar.setDate(new Date());\ncalendar.setDate(\"2016-10-20\");\n```\n. > Sorry if I've missed this : Is setDate documented in the API ? I've only seen its usage in the Fiscal Calendar example here.\nUnfortunately no, along with a number of other functions and capabilities. \nWith limited time, I prioritize bugfixes and new features, and as a result documentation is a bit lacking.\nAny help would be appreciated\n. Hello,\nThere seems to be a common misconception about the relationship between dateFormat, and the input date formats. The input date string, retrieved either from the input's value or the defaultDate option, has to follow a certain, logical format. It is independent from dateFormat, which is whatever format you want to use to store or display the selected date. \nFor flatpickr to parse an input date string per dateFormat, I'd need to create a powerful parser, which goes against the simple and lightweight philosophy.\nHaving said that, I like to make flatpickr as accomodating and easy to use as possible, which is why there is support for custom date parsers using the parseDate option. As you've noted, its really the best way to go if you're performing complex date manipulations or need to support custom formats. \n. Hello,\n\nBut in fact, this doesn't work\n\nAre you using IE/Edge? It's a known issue for those. \nOtherwise, please provide an example, since the documentation site uses this method as well without problems\n. Hello,\nIndeed it would be better to append the calendar right after the element.\n. 1.9.1 is an old version and is not maintained. \nI'd strongly recommend updating to 2.0 as the issue is not present in the new version.\n. Thank you for contributing :+1: \n. Hello,\nFixes have been merged in https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/f83b1b1107a15772de14dd39fdee33e6f9c1ce11\nThank you very much for contributing :+1: \n. Hello,\nThank you for reporting the issue.\nCould you please verify that it is resolved now?\n. Hello,\nThank you for reporting the issue.\nShould be fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/c5b12517542322c9b2337b81a02d7bbeca6644b0#diff-51ad6ed16e74144ae6e17bbd53d35a5bR763\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/krbsh0xk/2/\n. Hello,\nCurrently, setting minDate/maxDate in set() will parse the string into a date object.\njs\nif (option === \"minDate\" || option === \"maxDate\") {\n            self.config[option] = parseDate(value);\n            self.redraw();\n        }\nPlease elaborate, ideally with a fiddle.\n. Thank you for contributing :+1: \n. I'll implement some sort of hook API that will let you manipulate the day objects. \nStay tuned :+1: \n. See http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#eventAPI\n. Hello,\nThere is indeed an option to disable the native picker, simply do disableMobile: true.\nIts unfortunate that they don't yet support enabling/disabling dates.\nI will update the documentation with all the options and full API as soon as I get some time\n. @TaylorDennisLee just load the css file. Hello,\n\nI think it would be useful to have the year number input respect the minDate and maxDate options.\n\nSurprisingly, I've never thought about it\nBut yes, absolutely. \n. Already fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/c5b12517542322c9b2337b81a02d7bbeca6644b0\nYou may use the latest dist files if you need the fix ASAP.\nOtherwise, it will be in the next release (very soon)\n. @rwwagner90 tomorrow or saturday\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue.\nIt is now fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/82832643e6db4d815f7563f87665ada5753b4394 and will be incorporated in the next bugfix release tonight.\n. @cconover are you using allowInput: true?. Already fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/a215345d7f01fbea013f47fbc96006e44ad54616 and to be incorporated into the next release\n. Good idea.\nWill merge manually tmrw\n. Hello,\nSorry for the delay.\nPlease take a look at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/tree/adhoc-gti-locale_options and see if any locale files need updating.\nLooks great otherwise :+1: \n. :tada: \n. Input classes are now copied over to altInput automatically.\nThanks for the PR anyways :+1: . Hello,\nWebpack uses require, and flatpickr is exported as a module.\nI've tried packaging as a UMD module, but it didn't play nicely with some globals and I'm not sure if its worth the effort.\n\nRight now importing flatpickr with something like requirejs is pretty difficult, as flatpickr is added to the global >scope, and then when you need something like i10n, then it's pretty much impossible to get working (At least i \nhaven't figured out how)\n\nI'ts been a while since 1.9.1.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#locale. Hello,\nI believe this is due to the 'change' event not being emitted from flatpickr inputs.\n. There are two inputs, as the dateFormat option would not function at all on a datetime-local input due to its specifics (the value has to match certain, limited number of formats).\nThe mobile input can be accessed by the mobileInput property of instance.\n\nalternately assign a unique class name for each input.\n\nSounds good. I will add an extra class for the mobile input.\n. > The onChange method is not called when changing the time.\nonChange isn't called only when a date is not selected. \n- It is always called in timepicker mode\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/56v822bz/\n. The datetime input is initially empty.\nMy reasoning was that the input is still empty when only the time is altered, which is not a 'change' per se\n. > I found it interesting that it does fire the change handler when the mouse wheel is used to change the time, but not when the up/down arrows are clicked.\nThank you for pointing this out. \nWith the latest fix, onChange is debounced when using the mouse wheel, and triggered right away when using the arrows.\nVersion 2.0.1 will be released today incorporating numerous fixes and improvements, including this one.\nThanks again for feedback and reporting these issues\n. Found the issue. https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/3htf1hjw/\nSetting minDate to null or any falsy value works fine.\nBut due to faulty logic in set() an invalid value gets set anyway.\nExpect a release with everything fixed today/tmrw.\nThanks for reporting the issue\n. Exactly what I was planning.\nWill be implemented by next release\n. Thank you :+1: \n. Resolved by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/6c4ae6058639213644965da1d13d915925f732a3\n. Hello @ecoreng,\nUnfortunately, this was necessary as a part of supporting multiple/range date selections.\nI've contemplated passing in the date object as usual in single date selection mode, but that would introduce inconsistency.\n\nit's trivial to just grab the first element in the array.\n. Hello,\n\nFirst of all, thank you for the constructive and substantial proposal.\nUsable range selections on a single input are definitely challenging .\nI do agree with most points.\nThere's a use case, however, for \n\nuser then clicks the same date again, that date is selected as the end-date, thus the \"range\" is really just a single day.\n\nfor datetime ranges, e.g. Oct 8 2PM - Oct 8 4PM\n. Thank you for the feedback :+1: \nRange mode has undertaken a rewrite from scratch.\nPlease let me know if I missed anything.\n. > Another note, for use cases like airbnb where disabled dates can't intersect the selection, beyond custom catch code there is no means to prevent currently.\nRange mode already works with disabled dates, which can't intersect the selection.\nIf you still cant get it working please feel free to open a new issue.\nThank you\np.s. thanks for all your ideas @davidklebanoff \n. Merci!\nBut please make a commit for the gh-pages branch :+1: \n. Hello,\nThank you for reporting the issue, and apologies for the delayed response.\nUnfortunately I don't possess any Apple products.\nDoes a date/time input get created? \nAre there any errors in console?\n. Hello,\nApparently on iOS one has to specify a pattern.\nCould you please check whether this resolves the issue?\nThank you :+1: \n.

Hello,\nI couldn't replicate the issue in the latest version.\nPlease see if its still relevant.\nThank you :+1: \n. The issue occured since config got modified directly, with minDate/maxDate getting set to strings.\nI've implemented getters/setters for minDate/maxDate, and even direct modifications should work properly now. \nPlease verify that the issue is fixed in the latest version, and let me know if I missed anything.\nThank you\n.

Hey @rwwagner90 \nLooks like it was an issue with defaultDate being disabled/out of bounds of mindate/maxdate.\nShould be fixed now.\n. > How goes the process of adding in some of the tests and getting things resolved?\nI've ported pretty much all of the test cases.\nAre any of them still causing trouble as of 2.0.6?\n. Hello,\nWhile onClose may be fired before onChange since onChange is throttled, the date/time is updated in Flatpickr instantly. \nYour save() function should function properly regardless\n. Hello,\nI couldn't quite reproduce the \n\ntoggle(), close() or open() functions - they are not working\n\nAre you calling these methods on a Flatpickr instance?\nAlso. Note that you have \nhtml\ndata-clickOpens=\"false\"\nwhich should really be data-click-opens=\"false\"\nThere is also no data-toggle anywhere in your code.\n\nIf I'm not using static: true - Calendar scrolls down with page.\n\nThis definitely shouldn't happen. Flatpickr is positioned absolutely by default.\nPlease let me know if after fixing the issues mentioned you still can't get it working :+1: \n. > Please let me know if after fixing the issues mentioned you still can't get it working :+1:\n. Hello,\n\nIs this a work in progress\n\nYes, and it'll probably take a few iterations to get it right\n\nshould I report the issues\n\nAbsolutely, unless they already exist :+1: \n. :+1: @docmarionum1 \nThanks for reporting the issue\n. Hello,\nYes, this is a known issue, and simply boils down to the mentioned browsers not supporting dataset.\nI could suggest using strictly objects for config to stay compatible with the broadest possible set of browsers.\n. If you'd really like, you could also polyfill it from https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills#dataset-property-for-use-with-custom-data--attributes\nFlatpickr doesn't do it to avoid bloat\n.

Hello,\nrequire(\"flatpickr\") returns the Flatpickr constructor.\nSee how to use it at https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#env-bundle\n. Thanks a lot for mentioning this.\n\nLooks like author fixed this a few hours ago via d0e3218\n\nYep. A better docs website is also in the works.\n. Hello,\nThanks for keeping the library updated :+1: \nThe link from README.md is still correct I believe.\n. Hello,\nYeah, the docs definitely need an update.\n\nI want to set two specific date(start and end) with mode range\n\nThe defaultDate option should work.\nJust provide an array with two Date objects or datestrings\njs\ndefaultDate: [new Date(), \"2016-10-30\"]\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue.\nNon-single modes are still somewhat work-in-progress\n. Hello,\nLooks like self.input is undefined, meaning your input selector might be faulty.\nDoes .date-picker input exist?\n. Glad you got it working :+1: \n\nthe dStr variable returns undefined and dObj returns an empty array.\n\nCorrect, thats because there aren't any dates selected yet\n. > So if jQuery is available does flatpickr not return as a module? I'm using webpack, for example, but jQuery is loaded as well. Ideally the module would still be returned and jQuery extended, giving the dev the option of how they want to work with it (vanilla or jQuery).\nThe new Flatpickr(element, config) syntax is always available, and Flatpickr is the module.exports.\nAdditionally, if a browser environment or jQuery is detected, helpers are registered for those as well.\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/flatpickr.js#L1880-L1899. > The module way still doesn't work for me. When I \"new Flatpickr(\"element\", {})\", I still got \"Cannot read property 'add' of undefined\" error. JQuery works fine for me. Did I do something wrong?\nelement is an HTML element, not a string.. Thank you!\n. :+1: \n. Hello,\nI believe for such purposes it is more suitable to specify a timestamp for minDate.\nThat way there is no ambiguity in interpretation.\n\"today\" is simply a shortcut for the majority of use cases\n. Closing since this use case can now be accomplished by an onMonthChange hook or onDayCreate et. al.. Hello,\nAbsolutely.\nThere's a dateFormat option for formatting the date (to be sent to the server), and altInput/altFormat for displaying the date however you want\n. Looks good\n.

Hello,\nThank you for the ideas. \n\nWhat do you think about such type of changes for this project?\n\nI agree with most of your points.\nDocs and dev branch are now separate.\nAn appropriate file detailing the simple contribution rules is now also available at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nAlso, generating dist files in merge requests is a surefire way to generate conflicts that prevent a automated merge. I'm not sure what the best course of action is. A possibility is to generate the files only when creating a release.\n\nYes, thats an issue.\nIts now explicitly advised to only commit changes to src and test\n\nadhoc-gti-locale_options. Will this be merged again later on?\n\nYes.\n. Merged :+1: \n. Hello,\n\ntab key support, doing the same job as return key.\n\nI'm not sure about that. \nI belive TAB is mainly used to navigate from one date to another, and the return key logically selects the date.\nCare to elaborate?\nThank you.\n. > In one of our projects, we moved from data_picker to flatpickr,\n:taco: :taco: :taco: \n.

Hello,\nFlatpickr by itself can't parse regional date formats - that includes US, UK, and others.\nYou can just load moment.js or any other date parser, and use the parseDate config option.\ne.g. \njs\n// ...\nnew Flatpickr(inputElement, {\n    parseDate: date => moment(date, \"DD-MM-YYYY\").toDate()\n}\n. Quite puzzling at first. This is why it happens:\n- The div, whose onclick is used to trigger the calendar, is regarded as an outside element - flatpickr closes when you click outside the calendar\n- flatpickr doesn't know that the div is used to open the calendar\nTwo ways around this:\n1. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#example-strap\n2. https://jsfiddle.net/0a3f6Lsf/\n. Hello,\nThat'd be a nice addition for the Event API, and not hard to implement.\nI'll include it in the next release (today)\n.

Fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/51bb31dc7db06ae01b7c35a27eea8cf0dbe8d7e5\n. Hi Matt,\n\nCurrently, flatpickr's range mode doesn't support date + time very well, if at all.\n\nIs there something missing? Seems to work ok.\nOn the other hand, range mode is still undocumented, even though its rather stable now.\n. @mgibbs189 thanks a lot for pointing this out.\nFixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/2dbfd7b82c001240bf9ab5c27fe0c1289037f02b :taco: \nAlso see http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#example-range\n. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#locale\n. Hello,\nThere are onMonthChange and onYearChange hooks, soon to be documented.\nYou could re-use the same function for both hooks.\nSee event API\n. > onMonthChange function does not appear to have access to the dayElem for injecting own content.\nCorrect, because month changes have nothing to do with specific days.\nHowever, this doesn't mean you can't access day elements.\nHere's what you can do:\njs\nonMonthChange: function(dateObj, dateStr, fp) {\n    // do some async ajax request, then..\n    for(let i = 0; i < fp.days.length; i++)\n        // utilize fp.days[i].dateObj\n. Of course. \nFrom the previous example, you'd use fp.currentMonth and possibly fp.currentYear\n. Welcome.\nThis also reminded me to document some instance properties. \nFeel free to open issues if you run into any problems :+1: \n. Looks good :+1: \nThank you for contributing\n. > So can we just host the files in dist folder then abandon the files in src?\nAbsolutely.\n. Hello,\nredraw() is essentially:\njs\nbuildWeekdays();\nupdateNavigationCurrentMonth();\nbuildDays();\nIt basically redraws the days and the current month/year.\nOptions like enableTime also entice adding event listeners and such, and having redraw() handle those would be a lot of effort, selectively unbinding/binding event listeners, adding/destroying nodes, etc.\nYour solution is the way to go for such cases.\n. Hello,\nThank you for the feedback.\nUser experience has been a key focus for flatpickr from the start.\n\nBut when the calendar shows the time inputs via enableTime: true, there is no intuitive next step.\n\nThis one I've found hard to get right. \n- display an icon for time picker? then the time picker can go unnoticed\n- display an \"OK\" button? I find it'd disrupt the style of the calendar and look out of place\n- Launch a time picker after selecting a date? This would be a terrible experience if the user changes mind about a date or time\n. Gotta admit that checkmark is pretty sweet. :cake: \nThink it should always be displayed, or only when the user modifies the time input?\n. Please check out the latest changes https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#example-datetime\nTime input is now hidden initially, and pops out after a date selection - I find that it establishes a rather clear step.\nThe checkmark looks nice, but it adds another layer at the bottom, making the calendar too tall and thin. My primary issue with the checkmark row is that the looks are not stellar - wouldn't even hesitate otherwise. \nSee some examples how this functionality is implemented around the web:\n\n\n\n\nThe last two don't look so bad. \nI'm going to experiment with various layouts before I make any decisions.. > I think the 3rd one down looks quite good with the date and time separated, checkmark at the bottom of both, it also allows for clearer controls on the time input and UI still looks quite refined. Out of curiosity, what datetime picker is that?\nI dig the looks as well. Its from some sort of a PSD UI kit.\n\nI'm going to experiment with various layouts before I make any decisions.. > Looking good.\nMy 2 cents:\nI think the checkbox should always be on its own line, for date ranges and when using the time picker.\nBasically how it was mocked up in #413 (comment)\nMy main thoughts behind this is\nCheck is more prominent\nCheck will be consistent in placement regarding the date picker configuration, which IMO is important. This way if you have multiple date pickers used on your site in different ways, the check is always in the same place and won't \"move around\" for the user.\nCheck could support text via checkText option. For example, if I was implementing this for my users, I'd like to change it to \":heavy_check_mark: Done\", to further guide the users.\nPlacing it on the bottom in all use cases will address all these :)\n\nThis.\nNow here's what's gonna happen:\n- The checkmark is a go when enableTime: false :+1: \n  - For usability purposes, textual part (localized) will be added i.e. \"Done\"\n  - I'm also debating whether the checkmark should be on or off by default in these cases, but rather inclined towards the opt-in approach\n- Aforementioned layout issues. As it stands, the layout of flatpickr is rectangular - narrow and long\n  - this isn't really a problem, but I found it looks much better when closer to a square shape\n    - whether this will be achieved by extra padding or some other means remains to be seen\n- In case of enableTime: true, docs might recommend using the wrap: true option and implementing an 'OK' button of their own \n  - an example will be provided in documentation. @mgibbs189 you'll be able to turn on the checkmark in any scenario with something like enableCheckmark: true\nIts just a matter of figuring out sensible defaults.\n\nI'd argue that time is when the checkbox is MOST useful...\n\nTotally agree.\nI just found no way of having both the checkmark and the time displayed that looks good..yet\n. > IMO the check area is most helpful when the date picker supports multiple actions and don't automatically close on selection (time enabled or date ranges).\nExactly. \nAnd as I mentioned:\n\nyou'll be able to turn on the checkmark in any scenario with something like enableCheckmark: true\n\nRegardless, before a decision is made on this I will introduce the layout improvements first.\nThose could also largely negate my initial concern with adding an extra row. @neokio I'm leaning heavily towards a plugin-based approach. \nSee the confirmDate plugin, which is work-in-progress. And see how plugins work here.\nI will likely include options to enable today, clear, maybe other buttons too.\nRather pressed for time right now due to midterms, but with last one being tomorrow I'll be able to deliver this by next week or so.. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/plugins/#confirmdate. Hello,\nThanks for reporting this @softdev878 , and for your feedback @jaredatch \nFix coming tomorrow in a new release :cake: \n. Fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/51bb31dc7db06ae01b7c35a27eea8cf0dbe8d7e5\n. Shall any problems arise in the future, please feel free to reopen the issue\n. Hi Jared,\nDuring initialization, flatpickr binds to the _flatpickr property of the passed-in element, usually the input.\nI'm guessing the _flatpickr prop isn't preserved when moving the element around.\nTesting this myself as we speak. Haven't tested but suspecting https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/9f0d79234050e45f9becbe843ad94b39d753574b should fix this issue. Is this still relevant @jaredatch?\nThere's also the appendTo option now.. awesome :fist_oncoming: . :+1: Fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/3d17f41505f8e8dcdce4210c8ca4cf7697194d79\n. https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/ed1aeef0f401dc8624fc503a2352481ce64ddd36. Hello,\nThis is intended.\nSee http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#eventsAPI\n\nselectedDates is an array of Date objects selected by the user. When there are no dates selected, the array is empty.. Hello,\n\nThis isn't possible just yet.\nI'll keep the issue open and update as soon as it becomes possible. Also, duplicate of #265 .

Thank you for reporting the issue. :facepunch: \nIts gonna be a great release, and out very soon. Should definitely be possible.\nWill get you a fiddle once I think of a nice way to do it. See https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/6g00xy84/2/. @leahthedestroyer Thank you for the idea :+1: \n. Hello,\nThanks for pointing this out. :+1: \nSince its only used in one place, I've modified the function not to use Math.sign instead. @rsjaq fixed. Hello,\nAlready fixed as of https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/196401b942920e5c7cb82e89a1f8504e20bbe84d\nFeel free to roll back to previous version, and a new release will be coming soon. > Appears to be via Flatpickr.l10ns.default.firstDayOfWeek = 1;\nFrom the demo JS https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/assets/js/site.js\nCorrect. \nI've removed the line and now week starts at Sunday again. Lines https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/flatpickr.js#L1454-L1456 are responsible for the input type, and I can't find anything wrong there :taco: \nLooks like this is the same issue as #482\nPlease check if the demos work fine now. @bambuk6 . Hello,\nThanks for pointing this out.\nI'll hook up a transpiler very soon.. Done.. thanks @jaredatch . @mgibbs189 its similar to the custom date parser support flatpickr already has.\nWe're pretty good with both. + I see no harm in extensibility. > A normal date picker will close after picking the date, unless\ntime picker is configured\ndate range is configured\nYou have time picker enabled, which is why it is not closing.\nPrecisely.\nIf you'd still like to close the calendar on date selection, just fp.close() inside an onChange. Hello,\nYou must be looking at the source file. \nThere are no lambdas at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/dist/l10n/nl.js. Hello Tom,\nThank you for your efforts.\nI would have accepted the PR but at the time a plugin architecture was in the works.\nPlease take a look at the confirmDate plugin here: https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/tree/master/src/plugins/confirmDate\nIts currently compatible only with light themes, and there might be some rough edges.\nSo not quite there visually, but close.\nIf possible, please make commits towards the plugin instead, as I'll be aiming to keep the source as lean as possible.\nThank you :+1: . Hello,\nThe time picker can be activated by enableTime: true option, including in range mode.\nUsability is a different aspect, and still somewhat work-in-progress. should probably automate this somehow\nI'll make a new release soon and hope nobody will notice  :octopus: . Hello Arlene,\nThank you for the warm words. :cake: \nPerhaps something like https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/cva1dtfs/ is what you're looking for?. Sorry for the wait @afabros \nThis will be fixed in the next release.(soon)\nWith a minor change it works in the current version as well\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/xg1f8hpe/\n:+1: . See #450 \nThe docs have also been updated with the patch.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#event-onDayCreate. @ceomanikanta @alfakrai \nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/7hmx5uwe/1/ for some ways you could use onDayCreate.\nFor dates ranges, I suggest you use the range mode.\nLikewise, for multiple date selections, use the multiple mode.\nAll of these fiddles essentially feature \"business logic\", and have more to do with Date usage rather than flatpickr itself.\nBut given the challenges some newcomers may face, I'll add a comprehensive example to the documentation.. There are problems with the implementation.\nThis only works when the date format is exactly the same as the input date.\nIn any other case, the cursor position is lost/wrong\n\nAlso, I think upon hitting either Enter or Tab, the calendar should automatically close (right now it stays open)\n\nThis I will likely implement by next release.. This is trivial to accomplish with a couple of hooks.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/qf2b5yLa/2/. Theoretically, this could be made possible. But should it?\nFrom a UX perspective, you definitely don't want to do this.\nI'd suggest allowing the user to select another datetime with a plus icon or something, or separating date/time inputs, depending on your needs.. Hello,\nHere's a basic fiddle with UTC enabled. \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/p118ekbt/\nFeel free to fork and make modifications to illustrate your problem.\nThank you. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#eventsAPI\nHere's a simple way: https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/p118ekbt/1/. Hello,\nI couldn't replicate this in a fiddle.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/uyrb8qhf/. That explains it.\nThe static mode essentially places the calendar inside label, thus a click on the calendar counts as a click inside label, which in turn focuses on the input, which opens the calendar.. Hello,\nPlease check if this problem is present on the latest version from the master branch.\nDate objects in the latest version are copied by value.. Hello,\nFeatures like disabling specific dates are not available in native datetime pickers, thus the calendar falls back to its non-native version.. > But why not have the option to render Flatpickr in all cases then, so it is consistent.\nThere's an option (yet undocumented, however).\nJust use disableMobile: true and it will always be rendered non-natively.. Also see https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#locale. Just add noCalendar: true to your options. Why not just use media queries?. > Do You mean min/max width? I think it would be inconsistent to use viewport width for styling since flatpickr is using user agent internally to differentiate between mobile and desktop. It could potentially break on some occasions.\nYou're right.\nBut I still don't think this warrants an option, when you could do something like\njs\n{\n    onReady: (dates, dateStr, instance) => {\n        if (instance.isMobile)\n            // add classes to instance.calendarContainer and instance.input\n    }\n}. data-default-date belongs on your element, which is <section class=\"flatpickr\">\nSo you'd have\nhtml\n<section class=\"flatpickr\" data-default-date=\"2017-05-01\">\n    <input data-input>\n    <i class=\"fa fa-calendar cursor\" data-toggle title=\"Change\"></i>\n</section>. I use flatpickr in a module environment and have no problems with \n\nFlatpickr.defaultConfig.time_24hr = true\n\nBut surely a method like that might make things a bit easier, esp. if setting multiple defaults. @jaredatch this is the same issue as #22. Closing as a duplicate of #22. Hey @tonymoxtra \nPlease check if its fixed at https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/. Hello,\nI think it'll be very easy to accomplish with media queries.\nStay tuned. I was under the impression that the clear button didn't work on mobile.\nAfter testing, it appears everything works fine.\nI think an option is unnecessary here - if you'd like to hide any elements, its trivial to use media queries.. Yes, this is due to a dev version getting pushed to docs.\nI've reverted docs to v2.2.4 until all variations of flatpickr work correctly and in all browsers.\nWill keep this open and updated as I iterate on the dev version\n. > This is the normal and default behavior.\n\nMobile devices will show a mobile date input, if supported.\nTo always use flatpickr use disableMobile: true\n\nPretty much this.\nYou may be wondering - why? Simply put, native datetime pickers are much more user-friendly, with native inputs and animations.\nIn case if advanced functionality such as disabling certain dates is required, flatpickr will detect this and run the usual non-native version. Yes, this is a known issue. See https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/22\nI'll try to fix this by the next release, and update the issue #22 . While it'd be nice to have, this feature will go unused for ~99% of users.\nYou are free to fork the calendar and make any changes necessary :+1: . > If that helps, my laptop has a touch screen. The bind() function tests typeof window.ontouchstart !== undefined. My Chrome returns null, hence the documentClick() handler gets attached to touchstart rather than click and so is never called.\nShould be fixed now. Hello,\nShould be resolved by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/1fa002602a409931cce0604a265b82ea19d0cde4\n\n. > Thanks! Will be a new release soon?\nIn the next couple of days, surely. Hello,\nAre there any errors in console?\nUnfortunately I have no means of testing iOS devices\n. Sounds like a transpilation issue.\nPlease check if its fixed now. Looks like flex isn't working. Safari might need a prefix.\nGonna have to steal gf's laptop and check this one out.\nMeanwhile, if you find the cause of the problem, a pull request would be very much appreciated. > As far as I can tell, the reason is that Object.assign in Safari does not work when using element.dataset as a source object. I'm assuming this is because it's a DOMStringMap and this doesn't work with Safari's implementation of Object.assign.\nBrilliant. Thank you.\nShould be resolved by 53af0ba. @md5 could you please log the _flatpickr object?. @tonymoxtra should be resolved now. Kindly open a new issue if any layout problems still persist.\nAlso @davidklebanoff they still haven't gotten back to me since November.. :man_cartwheeling: \n. Function(s) in onChange receive some arguments. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#eventsAPI\nThe instance variable is the corresponding flatpickr instance. @billmn You could always use plain old addEventListener(\"change\", ...) for those inputs. \nflatpickr binds to the _flatpickr property of the element, so you could leverage that. @billmn just modify the config object then.\nSomething like\njs\nconst element = document.querySelector(\"input[name=some_value]\");\nelement._flatpickr.config.onChange = function(dateObj, dateString, flatpickrInstance) .... You're using the wrap option (unneeded in your case with just one input) without specifying the input element.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#example-strap. > Why you use it?\nThere isn't a way to target all versions of IE just by css.\nSo its a hack, among a few others, to counter various layout issues across versions of IE.\nAs for why ch, its the glyph size of 0. I use it as the approximate width of one number.\nCan't use pixels because different fonts have different widths, and ems depend on properties outside of flatpickr's scope.\nIt is also necessary to specify width of the input element because inputs don't have width: auto.\nRegarding your problem with some optimizers, I'm not sure how I can help. \nThe CSS doesn't break because of invalid values - they just get ignored.\n\nIf you need a minified version, its available at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/dist/flatpickr.min.css. Surely.\nIs there a way to detect a Web Component context?. Sounds like its more of an issue with Web Components rather than flatpickr.\nRegardless, please let me know if I can do anything to make flatpickr compatible. Looks like the calendar closes before updating value.\nShould be trivial to fix. selects have been considered, but I've opted for inputs primarily due to their flexibility.\nYou could simply type the birth year, and any birth month is at most 6 months away from the current.\nIf you find the current approach inconvenient, you could always have three selects to select a birth date. Thank you!. Two-letter-name isn't a strict requirement for locales.\nThree letters are sometimes required for better expressiveness.\nAll in all, I don't think its worth the hassle. Hello Paul,\nThanks for the contribution!\nPerformance is one of the main, continuous goals of this project.\nI'm also aware of a few other areas that need optimization, e.g. positionCalendar() in open() and its dependency on expensive getBoundingClientRect().

OK @danielfilho we'll have to debug then.\nPlease log the config object and the instance using the onReady event.\n```js\n{\n   onReady: (dateObjs, dateStr, instance) => { console.log(instance.config); console.info(instance); }\n}. @danielfilho :+1: . awesome :taco:. Hello,\nz-index is still there.\nMake sure you're using the latest css.\nAnd next time please follow the issue format so I know which version of flatpickr you're using. OK so cssnano was at fault thus being only evident in themes and minified css.\nI've turned off its 'optimizations' and will publish a hotfix release soon.\nThanks @robsonsobral . https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/c9359c34b79bc7773a835cb3595eac892682edf3. Hello,\nI couldn't quite guess from the changes what issue exactly is being fixed here.\nPlease provide a description of the issue or a flddle (if possible).\n. Hello,\nThe function for retrieving weeks is indeed customizable.\nJust specify a getWeek config option with your function, which receives a date object as an argument.\nMight want to take a look at the default implementation.\n. Hello,\n\nThis should be a localization option to let every locale translate the week heading\n\nThis has been possible for a while. \nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/flatpickr.js#L647\nHowever, since this option has been added a number of locales (incl. Swedish) haven't been updated with this new property.\nFeel free to submit a pull request with the addition :+1: \n. Thanks! :+1: . This is correct behavior, as the date you're trying to set shouldn't exceed maxDate.\nIts rather easy to circumvent, however.\njs\n{\n    defaultDate: new Date(),\n    maxDate: new Date().getTime() + 1\n}. > Add a helper class to indicate if the field is filled or not.\nSelectors like :invalid and :valid are hard to manipulate manually, if even possible.\nYou could simply bind to onChange and do something like\njs\nonChange: (selectedDates, dateStr, instance) => {\n    instance.input.classList.toggle(\"valid\", dateStr);\n}\n. Resolved by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/5844d85050f34369d8407902961f230a0c93bc5d. Should be resolved now :taco: . Thank you.\nBut next time please only commit the src folder.. Cherry-picked https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/089a7523dbbcf79abe2e5d3c23c180718f31898f\nThanks for contributing! :+1: . Hello,\nThat isn't possible at this point, and unlikely anytime soon due to the sheer amount of refactoring necessary.\nWith that having said, depending on the changes necessary, it might appear in a future v3.0. Hello,\nflatpickr should work with most frameworks, since the inputs properly emit change and input events. \nI use flatpickr with Vue as a 2-line directive.\nI don't use angular2 so its unlikely that I'll create and maintain any components.\nHowever, you're more than welcome to create a wrapper like ember-flatpickr or react-flatpickr, and I'll link to it from the README. :+1: . > flatpickr(this.datepickerEl.nativeElement\nflatpickr is somewhat of a legacy function which takes in a String used as a selector.\nWhat you want is \njs\nnew Flatpickr(this.datepickerEl.nativeElement);. I'll likely also allow the month to be typed in or autocompleted, if it doesn't take a lot of code.\nStay tuned. @LSDD fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/e3e7e9cbc95d63d940cd46eda5a347651f7e6d08\nThanks for reporting the issue :+1: . > the class \"dateIsPicked\" is attempting to be added, it instantly forces the popup/overlay window to close\nThere must be something wrong in your end.\nIf you'd like you could disable the animation with basic CSS.\ncss\n.flatpickr-time {\n    transition: none !important\n}. No problem.\nIf possible, provide a fiddle so that I could help you further.\nThank you. > e.stopPropagation();\n\nPrevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases. \n\nThere is no reason for the event to stop propagating from selectDate().\nSounds more and more like there's faulty logic handling the modal closing behavior.. @kmohrf Yes you're correct.\nAlso @rsjaq the static mode is now what it used to be in v1. Give it another shot. Should be solved by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/e929f9c3ce351d0ab5f34e80b64be8730b953d00. Hello,\nValidators are different and I don't really see a point in supporting all of them.\nIts not necessary per the W3 HTML5 spec to have IDs for every input.\nIf you'd like to add any classes to elements, just hook into onReady().\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#event-onReady. > Moreover, in the current implementation, the  processing is weird IMHO\nYeah, I've thought about this. \nEscape should just close the picker and if a clearing functionality is needed it can be provided using external buttons. Resolved by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/51b70edbd3f3fa799fdb5902add569a5199c4229. Hello,\nd-m-Y is not a format parse-able by flatpickr. \nI suggest setting altInput: true and altFormat: 'd-m-Y' instead.\nSee http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#example-altInput. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#options\nSee appendTo.\nYou could also keep a reference to the calendar instance and call destroy() after the calendar is not needed anymore.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#api-destroy. Hello,\nSome e2e testing is already being conducted e.g. for selectDate() using jest.\nIts rather easy to write test cases in jest so I'd rather not add extra and unnecessary complexity.\nThank you for the suggestion regardless :+1: . Thanks! :+1: . It is  already possible to set the time after selecting the first date and before selecting the second.\nYes, it's not user-friendly, because range mode is not meant to be used with enableTime.\nI strongly advise using two inputs (e.g. from/to) instead.. This is already fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/cf0265be0a8ac8dc58563dbe7c2dfb47ecc94acc and incorporated in v2.3.4. Case 1. flatpickr is above the overlay when it should be hidden below the overlay.\nYour z-indexes are not correct. The overlay should have a z-index higher than flatpickr's.\nCase 2. flatpickr is below the modal when it should be above.\nSeems unlikely from the screenshot. \nIf that's the case, however, your z-indexes are incorrect once again.. @htrampe set picker's z-index to 9\ncss\ndiv.flatpickr-calendar {\n    z-index: 9;\n}. Seems like some backdrop is intervening. I couldn't get the calendar to display in non-static mode at all.\nThis will be fixed by the next release.\nSee http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PWbaeJ. awesome :+1: . Thanks! :+1: . I'm not going to include calendar variants that absolute majority of users will not be using.\nYou can use any subtext and even replace the day text entirely using the flexible APIs.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#event-onDayCreate. This is now possible with the plugin system.\nSee an example here https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/1te5tjjh/2/. Hello,\nThis is quite a narrow use case and thus is better accommodated by a plugin.\nStill, its great that you were able to get flatpickr to work just the way you want it :+1: . >  Is there an option to choose range of dates with different time for beginning and end dates?\nJust mode: 'range' and enableTime: true. \nYou'll have to set the time after selecting the first date, then the second. \n\nThe deficiencies I currently see are:\n- You cannot currently select different times for the same date\n- You cannot later change time for whichever date in the range was selected first, all changes will affect the date chosen last\n\nThe first one is possible.\n\nI'm not aware of a user-friendly way to have a datetime range and allow later modifications to the first selected datetime etc. If you have any ideas, I'm very open to feedback.\nMeanwhile, for datetime ranges, I recommend using two inputs.. > Another problem that I am having with that is that the minDate and maxDate in each instance is not being update when one of them is updated. they start with initial value and won't re-render.\nDo you hook into onChange() and keep the minDate/maxDate updated?\n. Closing due to inactivity.\nKindly re-open the issue if necessary. :+1: \nThank you.. Hello,\nYou can modify default options using e.g. Flatpickr.defaultConfig.enableTime = true;. Hello,\nWhilst convenient, I don't find this particular functionality to warrant the effort required.\nHowever, month selection will definitely be improved. I'm planning to allow either typing the month in, or scrolling on months, or both. \nSee #535. Thanks! :+1:. Is the issue also present in iOS > 7?. Hello,\nI couldn't reproduce this on Safari 7.\nPlease check if the issue persists on the latest version from master, and kindly re-open if necessary:\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/dist/flatpickr.js. Looks awesome! \nVery elegant. I've added it to a new showcase section in the README.\nThanks for using flatpickr :+1: . Hello,\nI don't quite understand the problem.\nPlease elaborate.\nThank you. The calendar days are redrawn after selection, in a matter of milliseconds.\nWhat's the problem?\nIf you make expensive API calls, they certainly don't belong to onDayCreate(). Hello,\nd.m.y is not a standard date format, and you will need a custom date parser if you want to use it.\nI suggest using the default date format, and setting altFormat to d.m.Y instead.\n@nenad007 try this, before any flatpickr(....) calls.\njs\nFlatpickr.defaultConfig.parseDate = function(str) {\n    return moment.utc(str, \"DD.MM.YYYY\").toDate();\n}. Just reproduced myself.\n\nI think on mousedown and on click anywhere it should probably close the first flatpickr, if the mouse is not within it or its input\n\nYes this is the current behavior.\nI'll have to debug the documentClick function.\nThanks for reporting the issue.. flatpickr now works binds to mousedown.\n\nThe only way I have found to reliably reproduce this, is to first click in one flatpickr, then click in a second one but instead of just doing a click, press the button into the flatpickr input, move it out, then release the button outside. This in most cases leaves the first flatpickr open and opens the second one.\n\nThis is now fixed.. It always closes in single mode unless enableTime is true.\nYou could close it manually with close() by adding an onChange listener.. @tenznhok \n\nonChange\njs\nonChange: function(selectedDates, dateStr, instance){\n    if (dateStr)\n        instance.close();\n}. Try \n```js\n      flatpickr(\".flatpickr\", {\n         minDate: new Date().fp_incr(-30),\n         maxDate: new Date(),\n         enableTime: true,\n         altInput: true,\n         altFormat: \"F j, Y h:i K\"\n      });\n\n document.getElementById(\"start\").flatpickt({\n       onChange: function(selectedDates, dateStr, instance){\n            instance.close();\n        }\n }). Yes. This is why the calendar doesn't close right away - it lets the user pick time.\n\nYou asked how to close it right away, and I gave you the solution :taco: . No. The user might want to adjust the time, or change mind about the date etc.\nThis is why it stays open.. Hello,\nThat's a very specific use-case not necessary for everyone.\nThe APIs are exposed and I'm glad you've come up with a solution.\nGoing forward I will implement some lightweight plugin structure to convert these hooks into plugins.. Hello,\nLooks like you're using new Flatpickr(..) and providing a string instead of the element's node.\n\nCreate an input: \nCall Flatpickr in input's class: flatpickr(\".flatpickr\");\n\nI'm unable to reproduce. Please provide a fiddle :+1: . Hello,\nThank you for using flatpickr.\nI'm glad the performance/lightweight mindset resonates with a lot of users.\nAn included date parser has been considered before, but I ultimately opted not to have one. \nHowever, I'm open to solutions if they add less than say 100 lines of source code.\nFor now, libraries like moment.js or the lightweight fecha are recommended instead, along with the parseDate option.\nAnd thank you for the contribution regardless :+1: . Also, I might still adopt this, albeit with some optimizations.. Hello,\nYou don't need id and for to associate an input with a label.\nConsider omitting those for calendar inputs.\nI don't think this particular issue warrants extra code.\nBut thank you for contributing regardless :+1: . Hello,\n\nDo not set altInput\nInitialize flatpickr in Chrome (v. 40.0.2214.93) for Windows 7\n3.Click anywhere in the document\n\nUnfortunately this is really unclear. Not all instances have altInput in docs, for example, and work just fine.\nPlease provide a fiddle, or the code you use to initialize flatpickr.. v2.3.5 is out. Hello Michael,\nI agree that a single input is not sufficient for user-friendly datetime range selection.\n\nAfter selecting a date range (start + end), I should be able to somehow edit the start time.\n\nallowInput: true\nHowever note that flatpickr doesn't require vue.js and thus implementing multi-input ranges without bloating the source code is much harder.\nIdeally, we could have nicer datetime range selections via plugins.\nI'll get back to this after new docs are released.. @alteredstudio yes\n@fboucquez 3-4 weeks\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/678#issuecomment-287193867\n\nI'm planning to make a plugin to enable Airbnb-style range picking.\nMight take a few weeks due to me being incredibly busy with midterms and exams.. Almost ready :tada: \n\n\n. @amnesia7 this is a plugin, and plugins are optional by definition.. @foxdog05000 Yes!\n@marijohannessen by the end of this weekend. Hi all,\nrangePlugin is now available at flatpickr@next.\nFeel free to npm i flatpickr@next to try it out.\np.s. there are two breaking changes in v3:\n- usage of new Flatpickr... deprecated in favor of flatpickr() or new flatpickr()\n- the removal of the utc option.. @vangelis183 not yet, but it will be available this weekend as I update the documentation :+1: . Hey guys, sorry for the delays, I've just gotten back from a vacation..\nThe docs will be updated tonight and I'll add a link here as soon as they're ready.\nThank you for your patience. Here's a quick how-to while I upgrade the docs and release v3.1\nHTML:\n```html\n    Date 1\n      \n\n<label>Date 2\n  <input placeholder=\"Select Date...\" id=\"input2\" />\n</label>\n\n```\nJS:\njs\nflatpickr(\"input\", {\n    plugins: [new rangePlugin({ input: \"#input2\"})]\n});\nPlugin options:\nts\ninterface Config {\n  input?: string | HTMLInputElement;\n}. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/plugins/#rangeplugin-beta. @xcrap please open a new issue for this. I use flatpickr as a module and overwriting default config works just fine.\n@rorc try not using window, see if it makes a difference\njs\nconst Flatpickr = require('flatpickr');\nFlatpickr.defaultConfig.enableTime = true;\nFlatpickr.localize(require('flatpickr/dist/l10n/ru').ru);\nnew Flatpickr(DomElement);. :+1: . Hello,\nSee https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString method which is used on Date objects.\nYou can grab the latest selected date using onChange or the latestSelectedDateObj property of the flatpickr instance.. js\nonChange: function(selectedDates, dateStr, fp) {\n    if (!selectedDates.length)\n        return;\n    const ISODate = selectedDates[0].toISOString(); // iso date str\n    const utcDate =  selectedDates[0].fp_toUTC(); // utc date obj\n}. Hey @lockykeaney \nTry using the multiple mode.\nAnd if you want to add classes to specific days, look into onDayCreate. @lockykeaney \n1. You need to provide date strings in a valid format. Something like \"2015/03/24\" or \"2016-10-20\".\n2. Use onDayCreate to mark the days with fixtures. Hello,\nd/m/Y is not a valid date format.\nPlease pass dates in \"y-m-d hour:minute\" or \"y/m/d hour:minute\" and use the altFormat: \"d/m/Y\" option.. @micku7zu this will break things to non-web-component users.\nYou mentioned using appendTo. What's your use case?. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue.\nI've just pushed a fix for this particular problem.\nPlease let me know if I could do anything else to further improve the keyboard interaction. :+1: \n. @neokio event hooks get converted to arrays only when flatpickr is initialized. There isn't a detector of a hook in set.\nAt https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/flatpickr.js#L1634-L1639 it can't loop over a function. If you pass in an array, it works fine however.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/vj8a7eoh/. @opavader if I start supporting setting events dynamically, I'd have to handle ~10 event listener addition/removal in set(). Its not the way to go.\nIf you want to change the prevArrow html, modify the instance's prevMonthNav.innerHTML. @neokio yeah, the docs are definitely far from perfect;\nGood news: new docs are being written as we speak. Hello,\nWhich flatpickr version are you using?\nThere are issue templates for a reason.\nAnyways, I find this challenging to reproduce using the current version.\n\n. Hello,\nI like the idea, but wouldn't ISO strings be more applicable?\n\nThe toISOString() method returns a string in ISO format (ISO 8601 Extended Format), which can be described as follows: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ. The timezone is always UTC as denoted by the suffix \"Z\".\nThe value returned by toUTCString() is a human readable string in the UTC time zone. The format of the return value may vary according to the platform. The most common return value is a RFC-1123 formatted date stamp, which is a slightly updated version of RFC-822 date stamps.\n. > The toISOString is newer and very old browsers do not support it (see http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) Yes I agree IE8, iOS5.1, Opera 10.1 are ancient. If you already know flatpickr does not work in the old browsers anyway then use the newer toISOString as it is more strictly specified.\nThanks\n\nFeel free to amend your pull request, I'll gladly accept it.\nAnd thank you for contributing :+1: . This has been incorporated for a while now.\nThank you for the effort regardless :+1: . Added in v4.1.5. Hello,\nThat's because the input type is changed to datetime-local, which looks like is unstyled.\nYou simply need to extend your input styles to the [type='datetime-local'] . Hello,\nLooks like its pulling flatpickr's .babelrc, even though it shouldn't.\nInstall https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-remove-strict-mode OR pull dist/flatpickr.js or fix your webpack config.. Hello,\nIn order to parse non-standard date formats such as d/m/Y, flatpickr would need to include a date parser.\nThere isn't one yet, unless I come up with a very lightweight implementation.\nI recommend sticking with default dateFormat, or better yet, ISO date strings.\nOtherwise, you're free to use moment.js, fecha, or any other date parsing library and specify the parseDate config option, e.g.\njs\n{\n    dateFormat: \"d/m/Y\",\n    parseDate: function(dateStr) }\n        return moment(\"d/m/Y\", \"DD/MM/YYYY\").toDate();\n    }\n}. Hello,\nNative calendars do not support disabling specific dates or disabling dates by functions. Its not possible to have both as of now until Android and iOS support this functionality.\nThus I think its better UX to show users that a date is disabled on non-native UI, than to let them pick and then clear their choice, which will definitely confuse users unless you notify them explicitly.\nIf you want to override this default behavior, look into event API. You could hook into onReady and set the input type to datetime-local etc manually.\nIf you'd like to improve the non-native calendar for mobile, I'm very open to suggestions :+1:. Hello,\nOf course. Just use the inline mode. \nYou can use flatpickr on a non-input element, like a div or a p.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#example-inline. You could just hide the input with css.\nAlso, if you can't get react-flatpickr to use a non-input element you could try to use flatpickr directly.\n. Hello,\nThis is too specific of a use case that 99% of users are not going to need.\nAlso, date formats already adjust accordingly on native mobile inputs.\nYou can always implement this yourself.\nI suggest using  onReady: function() {} option to implement your desired functionality.\n. Resolved by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/a3155e0592bb4e74171112cae0f4c5c034315bb5. You mean restrict selection from today to 30 days ahead?. Couldn't reproduce in the latest version.\nPlease provide a fiddle.. As of now, its possible to tab to the calendar input, select a date with tab + enter, then tab to the next input.\nNot ideal behavior, but how would one select a date with keyboard if a TAB skipped the calendar and jumped to the next tabindex?. @cyrilmesvayn Thank you, I really appreciate your ideas (and the fiddles). \nI'd like to make flatpickr as convenient as possible with regards to keyboard-only input.\nUnfortunately tab-index based navigation is far from being perfectly usable.\n\nI was thinking, [TAB] to open the calendar, maybe use [arrow] for days, [Shift + arrow] for months and year, [Enter] selects and close, perhaps? Then tab could be left as intended, switching inputs.\n\nI will definitely consider this.\n\nup/down arrow input for the time-picker only does not work\n\nI've already addressed this in https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/0bc6888f07be409f4da0dbcd4b8f028c571cd9f6\nI'll keep referencing this issue until all keyboard-related problems are resolved.\n:+1: . @cyrilmesvayn thank you for the feedback \ud83d\udc4d \nTabindex seems to work OK with the latest version (https://jsfiddle.net/nmq1gffx/)\nYes, range and time pickers definitely need some work regarding keyboard support.\nThat CSS bug will be squashed also.\nI'll get all those solutions in for v2.4.9 or v2.5.. @Seldaek if I understand correctly, you're using flatpickr in inline mode and it reacts to arrow keys?\n. @Seldaek thanks a lot for your feedback!\nNow in inline mode, arrow navigation won't do anything unless the user is focused on the input and allowInput is disabled.\nThe changes are incorporated in v2.5.3, out just now.. @Seldaek awesome.\n@cyrilmesvayn Are there still any issues with tabindex?\nI've revisited the fiddle and seems to be working as expected. Closing the issue as the original concern has been addressed.\nPlease feel free to open new issues for any specific keyboard-related problems.. Hello,\nI'm not sure if flatpickr is to blame for this.\nDoes the problem go away if you remove flatpickr?. @JamesJGoodwin were you able to resolve this?. @JamesJGoodwin  are there still issues with v3?. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#options\nSee minuteIncrement option.. Hello,\nmin Date() is a date object with the current time and date. flatpickr supports having a minDate with time so that time selection on a minDate is restricted as well.\nIf you want to have minDate of today's date, simply pass in \"today\"\njs\n{\n    minDate: \"today\"\n}. :+1:. Hello,\nLooks like you're using outdated css. The input class is now cur-year.\nThis issue isn't present anywhere else.\nPlease get up to date and let me know if that fixed your issue.\nThank you.. Hello,\nLooks like calling flatpickr(\".flatpickr\"); creates duplicate instances.\nYou can easily fix this by using the new Flatpickr(element, config) syntax.\nI've fixed your script and also made use of the strap mode, so that you can use the calendar icon to toggle flatpickr.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/svz0x1ce/. Hello,\nThis is already fixed in the master version.\nExpect a release within a few hours :+1: .

Hello,\nYes that's definitely possible.\nDue to time constaints its not in the docs yet.\n\nJust use the config options above.\nThank you.\n. Hello,\nYou're quite close. \nIts simply\njs\nFlatpickr.localize(require('assets/i10n/flatpickr.l10n.hr.js').hr);. Hello,\n\nThere might be a better approach to this, but I'm not quite finding it.\n\nThere definitely is. You need to apply flatpickr to the new cloned element directly.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/svz0x1ce/. Its some postcss junk.\nFrankly, I'm re-evaluating the need to have postcss in the first place.\nWill likely phase it out once I conduct multi-browser tests\n. Gone with the removal of postcss. Funny enough, this exact issue bit me during plugin development, when a setDate() from an onChange hook caused stack overflow.\nI think the previous value is more sensible.. @rwwagner90  I'll just close this PR as soon as I revert the behavior. Hello,\n\nFlatpickr.l10ns.default.firstDayOfWeek\n\nThat's the way to go. But make sure it's a number, not a string.. Sounds like Flatpickr isn't loaded yet. \nI'm not too familiar with angular2 internals, but you need to place the code where you know the modules are loaded already.. Closing due to inactivity.\nKindly re-open the issue if necessary.\nThank you.. Hello,\nI couldn't reproduce this with Chrome on my Android.\nPlease elaborate on the issues you're having.\nThank you. Awesome :+1: . https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/themes/. Hello,\nCouldn't reproduce using the latest version.\n\n. Hello,\nPlease provide a fiddle if possible.\n. Thank you for the fiddles.\nSo what exactly isn't working?\nThe npm version is identical to the CDN version.. I use flatpickr in a webpack build without issues.\nAre you importing the css correctly?. Sorry, I'm still quite unsure what the issue is.\nEverything looks fine.\n\n. @dsilverlock in time picker mode the date format is changed to H:i:S.\nThe minDate in OP's example does get parsed correctly, but initial values of the time picker are not updated to reflect the minDate. \nThis should be rather easy to fix.. Hello @JamesJGoodwin \nI'm planning to make a plugin to enable Airbnb-style range picking.\nMight take a few weeks due to me being incredibly busy with midterms and exams.\nWill keep this issue updated.\nThanks for the idea :+1: . Closing in favor of #584 . :+1: . :+1: . Hello,\n\n2.Implement a flag to enable/disable automatic positioning, and place it below the input regardless of viewport dimensions (easy).\n\nThe option (yet undocumented) already exists.\nFor now, just set the position option to either \"above\" or \"below\" to disable automatic positioning.. Closing in favor of #646 . https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/getting-started/. Hello,\nI'd suggest setting config options with an object, where you're less likely to commit typos.\ndata-enabletime=\"true\" should be data-enable-time=\"true\"\nSimilarly, data-timeFormat=\"H:i\" should be data-time-format=\"H:i\". Please upgrade to the latest version and re-open the if the issue persists.. @ThomHurks You can already override locale fields. See https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/hLv6LrgL/\njs\n{\n    locale: {\n    firstDayOfWeek: 3\n    }\n};\nThe use case is too specific to warrant a PR. >  Is it perhaps worth documenting this? Other people would probably also want to use this and may not know it's possible.\nYes, of course :+1: . Unfortunately I've had to neglect documentation, with finals and all.\nBut its super easy to contribute, the docs are in plain markdown.. Hello,\nYou have to use Date objects or have date strings formatted like your dateFormat.\nYour date format uses 24-hour time, while you supplied date strings with AM/PM.\n. > is it possible to disable date and time in rang. and can use in event booking system ???\nFor now its not possible to disable times using the disable option.\nIt will be possible in the next release.. Merging with #750. Hello,\n\nI tried using set() to change minDate inside an onChange() callback when the user chooses the first date\n\nThat's the way to go.\n\nbut this resulted in an infinite loop (i'm using vue-bulma-datepicker).\n\nThis is a known issue that's already been resolved a few releases ago.\nPlease upgrade to the latest version.\n:+1: . @adambiggs see https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/h0ymyc5o/1/\nAlso, https://github.com/jrainlau/vue-flatpickr/blob/2.0/package.json#L13 is ~17 versions behind. @ibarral use this onChange hook.\njs\nnew Flatpickr(yourElement, {\n    onChange: [function(selectedDates){\n        const dateArr = selectedDates.map(date => this.formatDate(date, \"Y-m-d\"));\n    }]\n}. Don't see any problems here\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/vtgs359a/. Hello,\nYes there is! \nSome locales are missing a few fields.\nTo localize \"to\", you'd need to add something like:\njs\nFlatpickr.l10ns.greek.range separator = \" separator \"\nin the locale file.\nSpeaking of which, I don't think there's a Greek locale yet. awesome @stsourlidakis . See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#flatpickr-external-elements. Merging with #706. https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/576. Hello,\nI suggest you extract the dates from selectedDates and post them separately, instead of relying on the input value.\nRegardless, this is beyond flatpickr's scope, at least for now.. Absolutely, was planning to implement this anyway.. See https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/tgt6zemL/. Sure.\nMeanwhile its possible to style arrows without javascript intervention at all.\nE.g.\ncss\n.numInput.flatpickr-hour + .arrowUp {}\n .numInput.flatpickr-hour + .arrowUp + .arrowDown {}\nSame with year/minute/etc. I don't quite understand the issue.\nThere's an issue template for a reason, make use of it please.. minuteIncrement is only used once.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/7swz8uLL/. Hello,\nSupplying the timestamp in an input's value is akin to supplying a date string.\nLuckily, timestamps are easy to detect.\nUntil next release, you may supply the timestamp using the defaultDate option.. @tripflex you'll be able to use \"U\" token by next release. Right now it gets parsed as a timestamp.\nThe \"U\" token stands for Unix time in seconds.\nYou'd use it like:\njs\n{\n    dateFormat: \"U\",\n    defaultDate: \"1491409152\"\n}. Hello,\nI'd use https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange\nBut implementation details are beyond the scope of the library.\n. Thanks @Djules. Hello,\nSure. Put them under 'am' and 'pm' fields: like Flatpickr.l10ns.gr.am. > flatpickr version used: 2.0.0\nPlease upgrade to the latest version and reopen the issue if the problem persists. \ud83d\udc4d . This is already possible.. Duplicate of #585. Hello,\n\nIs it possible to enable the time picker to insert the time when you click on the time itself\n\nOf course.\nJust add some click event listeners in an onReady hook.. @stsourlidakis correct. This still works to retain backwards compatibility and allow users to make the change.\nJust haven't gotten around to updating the docs yet.. @stsourlidakis that'd be awesome \ud83d\udc4d . https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#flatpickr-external-elements. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#disabling-specific-dates\nInside a function, use getDay and if its 0 or 1, return true\n. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#disabling-dates-by-a-function. Hello,\nopen() on mobile devices works only on Android, and even then with a hack.\nI found no way to progamatically display the native picker without the user explicitly focusing on it.\n(.focus() and .click() didn't do anything either).. @theonlypippo Its definitely possible. \nThe picker is absolutely positioned.\nYou could add an onOpen hook, then set top, left, right and any other values yourself.\n. Fixed on master\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/BWEeZx. Hello,\nI couldn't reproduce this on browserstack.\nIs the issue still relevant?. :+1: . Hello,\nCould you please check if this issue is also present in the latest release?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/aj6k3f1v/\nThank you :+1: . Could not reproduce it on a fiddle\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/6pyajLga/1/. Fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/dc3ef94da51058ce0499dda9a1f42bb5d9ed7ca3#diff-51ad6ed16e74144ae6e17bbd53d35a5bR1522\n\nMany thanks for the awesome lib!\n\n:+1: . Hello,\nThe new Flatpickr(...) invocation requires the element to be passed in instead of the string (e.g. \"#weekSelect\").\nI've corrected your fiddle and included both ways of proper invocation.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/bjhucots/1/. @CassySpencer right. The weekSelect css also needs to be included\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/yn42hr99/. Feel free to reopen the issue if you encounter any more problems :cake: . @CassySpencer\nThe fiddle links to the dev version of flatpickr, and the weekSelect plugin wasn't updated yet to work with it until just now.\nWhat to do - just pull the files from the npm package.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/44kzse55/1/\nAbout that warning - if its annoying enough (it is), you could download and use the updated weekSelect from here, temporarily.\nThere will be a new release in 2-3 days and the warning will be gone, so you'll go back to the version from npm again.\n:cactus: \nEdit: scrap waiting. v2.4.9 is out on npm now. Awesome.\nThough I think it'd be best to prevent creating fp.confirmContainer if there's no calendarContainer.\nSomething like this before line 17\njs\nif (!fp.calendarContainer)\n    return;. Go for it :+1: \nYou almost had the perfect solution anyways.. A bit of an investigation shows that at the time of plugin execution, fp.calendarContainer is undefined in any case.\nThe best way to go would be to encapsulate element creation etc in a function, and call it from onReady. Not sure if its necessary to display the days here.\nI was thinking of something more like:\n\n(without the range, that is). @skatt just create some div and append it to fp.rContainer.\nFirst, I'd add some class to fp.calendarContainer like \"monthSelect\". \nThen, you could hide the month name and weekdays by\nstylus\n.flatpickr-calendar.monthSelect\n    span.cur-month, div.flatpickr-weekdays\n        display none\nSecond: hiding days - hook into onParseConfig and set fp.config.noCalendar = true.\nThird: prevent arrows from changing months and change years instead\njs\nfp.prevMonthNav.removeEventListener(\"click\", fp.prevMonthFn);\nfp.nextMonthNav.removeEventListener(\"click\", fp.nextMonthFn);\nThen add your own listeners and just increase/decrease fp.currentYear.\nThe rest should be just a matter of styling.. Hello, \nThank you for your work on the plugin.\nI will soon convert it to typescript and merge into master.. Hey all,\nThis is what the plugin looks like:\n\nI may work on this plugin further in the future, but you can have it now :). > It should be disabled by default when calendar is in an always-open state with the inline option:\nYes, this makes sense. Thanks for the idea.. Hello,\nYes, absolutely, I'd like multi-month views to be possible.\nWhether I'll make it core functionality or a plugin is secondary.\nHowever, I'm rather constrained with time right now due to full-time work thus if you'd like to see the feature sooner rather than waiting I would very much welcome a PR.. Hi all,\nI'm delighted to say that work has already started in this direction.\nIf you wish, you may follow https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/pull/1202 for progress.\nThank you for patience :). @JonTryggvi use showMonths: 1 option (which is now the default. before it would show 2 months by default on that branch).. Awesome, thanks :+1:. Thanks for the notice!\nThe issue is now fixed and v2.5 is out.. @UsmanShahzad respectfully, this project is maintained voluntarily, by myself only, in my free time, in addition to full-time studies, part-time work, and social life. Most flatpickr users understand this and I appreciate their patience.\nAnd while I implement most of the requested features, I don't \"owe\" anything to anyone and don't provide ETAs. . That would be disappointing indeed. I understand the frustration but this isn't a small one-off feature that I could implement fast. Features like this require some rethinking and some internal rewrites, and thus have to wait until I can commit more time to them in 4-5 weeks.\nFor now I'd suggest separating your date and time pickers, and upon selecting a date (onChange) setting minDate and maxDate on the time picker.. @Chinese1904 Absolutely.\nThis feature also enables min and max time to be dynamic, meaning it can be determined by specific dates or even arbitrary functions. Such functionality will be available in simple plugin which I will release soon.\nThis has been a highly anticipated feature and after finding some time to work on it I am very happy to deliver :)\n. @UsmanShahzad The plugin is ready and will be a part of the next release. @MaxZGYL include dist/ie.css for IE\nhtml\n<!--[if IE]>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\".../dist/ie.css\" />\n<![endif]-->. @dannydulai see @mikeskaug's answer. Hi Cassy,\nI've pushed an update so your fiddle should work now.\nJust don't forget to format the weekNumber.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/2g3s56us/\n. Closing due to inactivity, assuming you've got it working.\nFeel free to ask questions if you encounter any problems :+1: . Hello,\nPlease commit to the src/l10n folder.\ndist is for automated builds only.. Awesome :+1: . Hello,\nflatpickr makes inputs readonly, which disables css validation.\n\nvalueAsDate also stops working on input type change.\n\nThere is no need for valueAsDate. One could just extract the Date object from flatpickr.. @jan-dh that would cause the browser's native datepicker to display. . Hello,\nThe commit actually referenced the wrong issue \ud83d\ude06 \nSome css has changed but there are just minor differences.\nTo resolve your problem immediately, try setting animate: false\nThen you may perhaps upgrade your css. @JamesJGoodwin the only change you'd probably need to make is replace flatpickr-days in your css with .flatpickr-days .dayContainer\nI'll close the issue now, but feel free to ask any questions. Hello,\n\nIt would be great, if i could show to user date he chose another day, but still give him opportunity to select only today's and next days date - the way it was set.\n\nI don't quite understand what should flatpickr do in your case?\nYou're right that if defaultDate < minDate it won't get set, but you could set the input value manually. @JamesJGoodwin \njs\n{\n    onReady: function(){\n        if (this.parseDate(your_date_string) < this.parseDate(\"today\")) {\n           this._input.value = your_date_string;\n           alert(\"oh, the date you selected etc..\");\n       }\n}\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/w0z9kj9u/1/\n. Hello,\nRegarding the double calendar - not yet, at least for now. Quite possible in the future.\nThere is however a plugin in-progress for date ranges - see https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/584#issuecomment-289295697\nI will release it in a few days.\nDouble calendar will have to wait for a bit longer.. No problem!\nI'll close the issue but feel free to ask any questions if you need help :+1: . Hello,\nThank you for your contribution!\nThe calculation was still a bit off, and I found it was due to input.offsetHeight.\nHere's what is was before:\n\nAnd now that its correct:\n\n. Thanks @JamesJGoodwin . Hello,\nThis is already possible with some CSS work and the wrap option.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/jcm1azra/1/. @vlastimilmaca Still I'd like to make positioning more flexible. \nThere's a hard coded reference to input in positionCalendar(). \nBy next release, you'll be able to position picker with regards to any element.\nAs far as inputs go, I still think hiding them with CSS is the way to go.. I think https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/pull/782 will be really helpful here. > any memory leaks or if there are any other issues with this approach.\nJust call instance.destroy() in the end and you're golden.. Hello,\nPlease fill out the template, then feel free to reopen the issue. @adambiggs \nThanks for the notice, I'll update the README.\nI've also got a super simple flatpickr directive for vue which I might publish in some sort of an extras repo. Hello,\ndefaultDate is used only for preloading a date.\nIf you'd like to set/modify the selected date(s), use setDate. @JamesJGoodwin You've got the idea right, but the first parameter has to be a string.\ne.g. set(\"minDate\", ...) or set(\"locale\", \"ru\"). @JamesJGoodwin did you get it working?. @voveson absolutely. Hello,\n\nIs there a defaultDate option if mode is set to range?\n\nYes, absolutely.\nJust pass in an array of two Date objects or date strings.\n. Hey @huseyinham \nYou got very close to making it work.\nsetDate() takes a third param where you specify the date format of the string you're passing in.\nSo all you had to do was \njs\nsetDate(this.altInput.value, false, this.config.altFormat);\nYou should also use something like Cleave to enforce the typed format.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/chmln/2r3j0rgs/4/. P.S. flatpickr exposes its date parser and formatter, so you could even avoid moment.js altogether.\n\nFlatpickr.prototype.parseDate(\"2016-10-20\", \"Y-m-d\")\n\nThu Oct 20 2016 00:00:00\n\nFlatpickr.prototype.parseDate(\"31/01/1995\", \"d/m/Y\")\n\nTue Jan 31 1995 00:00:00\n\nFlatpickr.prototype.formatDate(new Date(), \"Y-m-d h:i K\")\n\n\"2017-04-24 11:56 AM\". @huseyinham no problem! I'll close the issue but feel free to ask questions if you need help with anything . @vlledo Not quite sure what your goals are, but you could detect deletion in  onChange whether selDates.length > 0. @inferno7291 on actual mobile devices, there would be a native date picker.\nOtherwise, you need to increase your input width, since the calendar can only go as far as the input.\nNote that the calendar is ~315px wide so you'd have to fit it in with 45px max left+right padding.. Hello,\nJust \njs\npicker._input.setAttribute(\"disabled\", \"disabled\");. @Taeon Yes, that's why I was working with picker._input which is the shortcut for the user-facing input element.\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/jmyOZe. Perhaps they're not as fast.\nSeems ok now.\nhttps://cdnjs.com/libraries/flatpickr. :+1: . Looks good to me :+1: . Hello,\nThank you for contributing :+1: \nI actually believe that it's better to have a separation of concerns, with time choice not affecting date choice and vice versa.\nI also don't think that every time a user increments time past midnight they actually aim to increment their date selection.\nIts awesome that you're comfortable enough with the codebase to submit a PR.\nYour code should be easily portable to a plugin.. Couldn't repro.\nBrowser? fp version?\n. Already fixed #784 \nThe bugfix is out right now in v2.5.9. Thanks for reporting the issue!\nIt was just a misplaced instanceof as a result of refactoring.\nFixed and out in v2.6.0. :+1: . weekNumbers: true doesn't work on mobile. \nThere are no week numbers in any native calendars, unfortunately.. Hi Michael,\nThank you for the suggestions.\n\n\nYou're right that releases can be sporadic and fast, but the reasoning behind it is that I want to get bugfixes out to people as soon as possible. Yes, ideally the unit tests would prevent any bugs from creeping in in the first place.\n\n\nflatpickr does mostly stick to semver.  \n\nflatpickr's version numbers are kind of useless, i.e. there's very little difference between 2.5.7 and 2.6.0.\n\n\n\nThose are patch releases with backwards compatible bugfixes. \nFinally, summer is nearing and I'll be employed starting Monday, so its inevitable I'll be spending less time than usual on personal projects. Consequently, releases will be limited to ~1x a week at most.. Hello,\nThis has been discussed before and ultimately I've opted not to support such functionality in set().\nDynamic handling of options like weekNumbers is not feasible because there's a dozen of such options , and handling all of them would bloat the code.. Awesome :+1: . See https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/584. Hello,\nFrankly, I am going to deprecate the utc option in favour of using standard ISO date format (\"2017-05-06T16:47:00.271Z\") which is much more precise and reliable. \nI strongly advise doing something like \njs\n{\n    dateFormat: \"Z\",\n    altInput: true,\n    altFormat: \"F j, Y h:i K\"\n}\nand not relying on utc.\nThe utc option is just a hack using timezone manipulation and will be deprecated in v3. Hello,\nThere's the noCalendar option for disabling days, enableTime: false for disabling time. \nThe rest can be hidden with CSS. \nIf you'd like to use an option like disableElements, it can always be accomplished with a plugin, without bloating the codebase. Hello,\nIf you'd like to have an inline calendar and disable its use, I could suggest pointer-events: none or adding your own event listener on the calendar and doing preventdefault + stopPropagation.\nAs far as disabling individual dates go, there is the disable option for a reason.\nAllowing the user to select a date then preventing that date from being selected is just bad UX.. Hello,\n$('selector').flatpickr(flatpickr_config) returns an array of flatpickr instances, which would be impossible if flatpickr adhered to the chaining pattern.. This has nothing to do with flatpickr.\nPlaceholders just don't work on input[type='date'] on mobile. Yes, just use closeOnSelect: false. Resolved by 396098259cf5c1e4ee8c0ed31c0b9ad6152178b3. Hello,\nPlease provide a jsfiddle reproducing your issue.\nIt'd be very time consuming to do this myself from a screenshot.. Hello,\naria-label is an attribute for those using accessibility devices.\nIt has nothing to do with altFormat and is hard-coded to provide the most readable date format for those with accessibility needs. \nUser-specified altFormats are not always easily readable and accessible.. @fabien ah ok. I'll make it configurable. But if you're using moment just for date parsing/formatting, I'd recommend ditching it in favor of flatpickr's built-in & lightweight parser/formatter. Hello,\nWithout knowing your config options, its impossible to help.\nThis issue isn't present neither in docs nor the fiddle\nKindly provide a fiddle that reproduces this regression and re-open the issue.\nThank you. Hello,\nenable and disable options can be complex, including multiple functions and to find the first available date could take much longer than anticipated. \nIf you need such functionality, just hook into onReady and do a jumpToDate yourself :+1: . Hello,\nDates are kept timeless for ease of comparison and reasons not pertaining to the range mode.\nI'm rather wary of adding extra config options at this point unless its absolutely necessary and done for functionality that cant be accomplished via pluigins.\nI recommend hooking into onChange and setting the time manually after checking if e.g. fp.selectedDates[1] exists.. Hello,\n\nlet datePicker = Picker(el, options);\n\nYou're missing the new keyword.\nPlease review the usage guide. @softkaikai the calendar listens to the focus event to pop up. \nIf you're blurring the input manually/focusing elsewhere, the input will need to regain focus for the calendar to pop up again.\nIf you'd like to open the calendar manually, please see the docs on methods.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/\nif removing the blur trigger doesn't resolve the problem, or if you have any more questions, please feel free to reopen the issue.. > what is your expected behavior?\nYes, please elaborate\n. Closing due to inactivity.\nKindly re-open the issue if necessary.\nThank you.. Hello,\nThere's a section in docs dedicated to mobile support.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/mobile-support/\nIf these are not sufficient, feel free to ask specific questions.. Hello,\nYou could manually set the date using the setDate method on a flatpickr instance.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange-datestrformat\nsetDate can also take in a custom date format, and you wouldn't even need a custom parseDate in your case. Hello,\nIs this issue still present in v3?\nThank you.. Hello,\nThe flatpickr div is not a child node of the input, thus it will not be removed along with the input.\n\n@theRealBugger try using destroy() method. It may help.\n\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#destroy. No problem running on Win7 + IE10\n\n. Hello,\nI'm guessing you're looking for a way to mark a date as disabled?\nI suggest using onDayCreate and adding a .disabled class to corresponding days.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/events/#ondaycreate. Hello,\n\nI have to click enter key ,so it worked.\nwhy not listen change event on it?\n\nWhile this might be a desirable scenario for you, others might want to opt out of it.\nThis means adding an extra option to already numerous options.\nAs a solution, you could listen to the change event and trigger a setDate() manually.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange-datestrformat. @mkaufger enabling multiple modes at the same time can't be possible due to conflicts between the ways each mode handles date selection etc.\nAs mentioned above, I'd suggest creating 3 flatpickr instances (one for each mode) and showing/hiding appropriate calendar accordingly.. Hello,\nI recognize that this may be a problem for those using custom formatters.\nHowever, there are solutions that don't involve adding extra options.\nI recommend catching those exact date strings in your formatDate(), something like:\njs\nfunction formatDate(dateObj, format) {\n  switch (format) {\n    case \"Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:S\":\n    ....\n  }\n}\n. Hello @ahmadalfy \nI'm guessing you're using node v6 which doesn't support async.\nYes, upgrading to v7 will resolve the issue.. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/plugins/#rangeplugin-beta. Hello,\nThank you for the constructive feedback and bringing light to the issue.\nIt is my goal of making the calendar as easy to use as possible, down to every detail.\nI'll work on incorporating some of your ideas into the next release.\nStay tuned :+1: . Awesome :+1: \nThanks for contributing!. Hello,\nThank you for contributing!\nI'm rather adverse to adding new options unless they're absolutely necessary or part of core functionality.\nMinutes in the time picker can be easily hidden with CSS.\nAdditionally,instead of modifying the source code, consider making a small plugin or just straight up using the rich hooks system.. Hello,\nflatpickr uses plain inputs for displaying date & time.\nIf you wish, you could hide the input and use your own elements to display the date & time, utilizing hooks like onValueUpdate.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/events/. Hello,\nPlease check if the issue is still present in v3.\nThank you.. Fixed in v3. Thanks a lot for the example @jamestenglish \nI'll make it a part of documentation (with some refinements).. @not3 Fixed in v4. Hello,\nmousedown is used for snappy response times.\nIt hasn't been causing any problems. If you run into any bugs, please create a new issue.\nThank you :+1: . Fixed on master.\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/dist/l10n/ro.js. Hello,\ndefaultDate has to follow the same format as dateFormat.\nThen, you can use altInput to display the date however you'd like.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/. Cant repro in v3: https://jsfiddle.net/b21o2rwx/\nPlease reopen if the issue persists.\nThank you. Hello,\nThat is a hack that has nothing to do with flatpickr's capabilities and more to do with w3 spec/browser implementations etc.\nIt may also potentially break functionality for other users.\nYou're free and encouraged to apply this workaround in your projects, but this won't make it to core flatpickr functionality.. Hello @iamgoodbytes \nI couldn't reproduce this in the latest version.\nLooks like https://github.com/crswll/vue-flatpickr/blob/master/assets/flatpickr-en.js is using flatpickr version from August 2016. I'd advise against using this wrapper.\nI use flatpickr in vue myself without any wrappers, and it works just fine since flatpickr calls the change and input events appropriately.\nHere's a simple directive that I use in my project\nhttps://gist.github.com/chmln/e77b52cf0a719e18233ca7948be8fab4. Hello @jschutt \nAbsolutely.\nYou can do it by something like\njs\nnew Flatpickr(..., {\n  onReady: function(_, __, fp) {\n    fp.altInput.classList.add(\"myClass\");\n  }\n});\nIf you'd like to do validation every time after the user selects/changes a date, just use onChange instead of onReady.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/events/\nand https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/\nfor details.. Hello @cyrilmesvayn \nThis is an easy fix.\nOn line 42, instead of \njs\nthis._flatpickr.setDate(e.target.value,;\ndo\njs\nthis._flatpickr.setDate(e.target.value, false);\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/g065szva/11/\nFor details on setDate(), see\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange-datestrformat. Hello,\nI believe flatpickr's implentation is correct as it uses getTime(), which is:\n\nA number representing the milliseconds elapsed between 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC and the given date.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime. Hello,\nThe date string that you're passing in the input's value does not match your dateFormat.\n\nYou're using h, which is 12-hour time, while passing in a 24-hour time (23)\nYou're passing in 2017-04-08 23:00:00.0 instead of something like 2017-04-08 11:00 PM .\n\nHowever, with better parsing of am/pm this could still work.. Hello,\nThis has been a subtle issue from the start and I have not yet found any better solutions.\nIf you are aware of any better ways of dealing with the issue, I'm very open to suggestions :+1: . > I'm very open to suggestions\nwhich then should be a part of a new issue.. Hello,\nThis also looks more like an issue with vue's directives.\nPlease try using the component mentioned above or just flatpickr without directives.\nIf you still run into problems, feel free to reopen the issue.. Hello Arlene,\nThe range plugin now has an input option, letting you create the input yourself.\nYou can do something like\n```html\nDate 1\n  \n\nDate 2\n  \n\n```\njs\nflatpickr(\".flatpickr\", {\n  plugins: [new rangePlugin({ input: \"#input2\" })],\n  altInput: true\n}). Fixed in #989. Hello,\n\"Today\" is not a valid shortcut. \nTry maxDate: \"today\".. Fixed in v3.\nSee also https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/updating-from-v2/. Hello,\nI have noticed this issue myself and am happy to let you know its fixed in v3.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/\nSee also https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/updating-from-v2/. Hello,\nI'm completely unfamiliar with Helical dates, but I'd like it to be possible to implement them via plugins.\nI encourage you to try writing a plugin and submit a PR, after which it could make it into the main repo.\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/tree/master/src/plugins\nAnd https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/plugins/\n. @adriankirchner a better solution just landed in v3.0.5-1 without needing any workarounds. Duplicate of #689 . Hello,\nIndeed that would be a nice feature for python users.\nHowever, I believe it should rather be implemented in a plugin in order not to bloat the core codebase.\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/tree/master/src/plugins for examples.\nYou could submit a PR I'd gladly list it in the main repo.\n. Hello,\nThat is intended behavior to indicate the next logical step for the user.. Hello,\nMake sure you're on latest version of flatpickr.\nAt the time of writing its v3.0.5-1, which was incidentally targeted at calendar width using weekNumbers.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#display-week-numbers. Hey @rwwagner90 \n\nNow setting minDate just disables everything until that date, but does not advance the calendar, so if you set it to years from now, the user has to guess and check when a valid date would be.\n\nAppears to work correctly here?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/aj6k3f1v/42/\n\nAlso, a question. Why did we change Flatpickr to FlatpickrInstance? Seems like an arbitrary change that offers no benefits, but breaks backwards compatibility. Would love to have it be Flatpickr again.\n\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/updating-from-v2/#simplified-invocation. Hello,\nallowInput is the only way to have html5 form validation.\nOn a tangent, flatpickr was created because browsers were terrible at date inputs.\nFrankly, form validation has an ugly ui as well.\nFor the sake of UX (and thus your users), I recommend implementing your own validation. Hello,\nYou could simply loop through elements in fp.days and check if they're all disabled, and if they are, do something like fp.changeMonth(1).\nI'd suggest doing it in onOpen or other hooks.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/events/. Hello,\nThank you for your suggestions.\nFirstly, I dont quite see the point of allowing users to mix & match arrow keys and Tab inside the calendar\n\nI think the tab key shift/tab need to be captured and the proper elements selected.\n\nThis was the behavior before and its not a good idea.\nIt would trap the tab key and made it hard to focus away from the calendar input onto other elements.. Couldn't reproduce. Potentially could be an issue with react-flatpickr?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/jx707gLf/. Hey,\nTry using the positionElement option.\nSee https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mwGVpK. Hello,\nMinification and optimization in this project is handled by uglifyjs.\nFrankly, I have no interest chasing microoptimizations, but if you're aware of better optimization strategies than those used currently, please feel free to open a PR :+1: \n. Yes.\nJust make sure its an array of functions.\n```js\nvar datepicker = new flatpickr('.datepicker', this.configOptions);\ndatepicker.config.onValueUpdate = [ function(selectedDates, dateStr, instance) {\n    alert('whoa!')\n}) ]\n```. Thanks for the notice @Thibaut-B\nwill fix asap. Hey all,\nI'm having trouble reproducing this in IE11.\nSee https://imgur.com/CU4r5Iq\nIs there a specific config that triggers this issue?. Hello,\nIs this still an issue?\nI couldn't replicate it on a fiddle. Fixed in latest release\nNow the input element always gets focused after closing.. Hello @mikeskaug \n\nflatpickr still has the behavior of closing the calendar on any click outside of the calendar\n\nThis one's easy since v3 includes a new option thats not yet documented.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/ydxtjbwr/1/\nPotentially, along with wrap: true you could also utilize clickOpens: false and closeOnSelect: false. @JuanRangel looks like you forgot to specify your dateFormat\nSee @MaximSavin response. Hello,\njQuery detection happens inside flatpickr, so it is necessary that jquery is loaded before flatpickr.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/aj6k3f1v/43/. @rorc I'll need a fiddle or a repo that reproduces the issue in order to fix it.\nThere also have been no changes in how flatpickr works with jquery.. Done. Thanks for the heads up :+1: . > Seems an issue of fastclick .\n. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/. Hello,\nWould it possible to reproduce the issue in a fiddle, or even a repo?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gnokhfob/. Hey @rwwagner90 \nThe defaultDate option exists for passing in Date objects and timestamps.\nParsing the value attribute makes sense as opposed to ignoring it...also making it easy to integrate flatpickr with most forms. Hello,\nYou can't select/preload disabled dates because it'd defeat their purpose.\nYou'll need to filter out your disabled dates to exclude the preloaded date.. Hello,\nThis has already been somewhat discussed at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/pull/745\nI'd really love to implement this but time is a significant constraint. just noticed the ping @ankurk91 \nRe-submit the PR  if you'd like.. Hello,\nThis issue has been brought up multiple times already.\nI will address it by the next release :+1:. Closing this in favor of #893. Hello,\nPlease rebase the commit on top of src/l10n/da.js instead.\nThank you.. Looking into it. Hello,\nPlease provide an example reproducing the issue.\nEverything works correctly on my arch linux box.. Everything appears to work correctly.\nI set defaultDate to '2017-07-08 12:12:14' and the input is empty.\n. Hello,\n\"now\" is not documented anywhere and thus  as an arbitrary string cannot be expected to work.\nPlease use Date.now() instead.. Thanks for the example @DASPRiD. Thanks a lot for the idea! @lilrc . Hello,\nPlease follow the issue template or at least provide an example reproducing the issue.\nThank you.. Hello,\nThis seems like more of an issue with minifiers than flatpickr.\nFor cssnano, you need to set the safe option to true. \nI use uglifyjs for minified builds without problems using default settings. \nIf you still run into problems, please feel free to re-open the issue.. Hello,\n\nIs there any way I can make input to act like toggle? So when I press on input - calendar opens, when I press again on input - calendar closes.\n\nYou could add an  addEventListener to the input and fp.close() if fp.isOpen.\n\nAnd another question. Is there a way to use altFormat with not parsing part of the string? For example I want string to be \"Ordered at Y-m-d\"\n\nYes.\njs\naltFormat: \"\\\\O\\\\r\\\\d\\\\e\\\\r\\\\e\\\\d \\\\a\\\\t Y-m-d\". Hello,\nThat's awesome. :+1: \nIf you end up making a reusable component, provide a link here and I might add it to the readme.. Hello,\n\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined\n    at Vue$3.Vue.$emit (eval at <anonymous> (build.js:723), <anonymous>:2207:15)\n    at Flatpickr.onClose (eval at <anonymous> (build.js:1409), <anonymous>:142:24)\n    at triggerEvent (eval at <anonymous> (build.js:1642), <anonymous>:1557:13)\n    at Flatpickr.close (eval at <anonymous> (build.js:1642), <anonymous>:839:3)\n    at selectDate (eval at <anonymous> (build.js:1642), <anonymous>:1329:30)\n    at HTMLDivElement.eval (eval at <anonymous> (build.js:1642), <anonymous>:200:30)\n\nThis is clearly an issue with vue and not flatpickr itself.\nThere is erroneous code in your onClose callback.\nIf you need extra guidance please forward the problem to websites like stackoverflow. Hello,\nThis would only be possible via plugins.\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/tree/master/src/plugins for examples. Hello,\njs\nconst fp = flatpickr(\".date-min\", {\n    minDate: '2017-07-13'\n });\nfp.setDate(new Date('2017-07-12'))\nThis is intentional. \nThere's no point of minDate if the user can select dates past it.\nIf you need to override minDate, then clear it before using  setDate().\nAlso, regarding \njs\nconst fp2 = flatpickr(\".date-max\", {maxDate: '2017-07-20'});\nfp2.setDate(new Date('2017-07-20'))\nNote that flatpickr regards '2017-07-20' as '2017-07-20 00:00'.\nMeanwhile, \njs\nnew Date('2017-07-20')\n// Wed Jul 19 2017 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)\n...which is less than the date specified above.. Hello,\nYou're recreating the flatpickr instance every time you show the picker.\nThis isn't a problem with flatpickr itself.\nIf you need more guidance, I advise asking on websites like stackoverflow :+1: . @heartles Yes, its here to stay. Along with some options it just needs to be documented. Hello,\nDisabled dates are not selectable by definition.\nThis behavior is appropriate for the vast majority of use cases.\nAllowing to select disabled dates in range mode should be possible by removing the disabled class name from the day elements. one could trivially implement it as a part of a plugin.. Hello @Dreyer \nThanks for the note.\nThis seems more like an issue with jquery validation than flatpickr itself.\nThe only thing I'd perhaps recommend is using onReady instead of onClose as you only need to remove the attribute once.. Thanks @ght. Hello,\nI don't really see anything wrong with the current behavior.\nThe user can't do much wrong - the next month's arrow is disabled, and the year cannot be increased.\nSure, maybe the July month view is not so friendly because only one day is available - but that is an edgecase. . Hello,\nThe time input is displayed immediately after selecting a date.\nIf you want to force-display it at all times, you can do so with one or two lines of css.. Hello,\nThis happens because \"today\" is resolved as today's date at 00:00 while new Date() contains the current hour and minute. And since new Date() > today, the second date gets stripped out.\nYou most likely want to pass in maxDate: new Date().setHours(23, 59, 59) instead to resolve the issue.. Sorry for the late response and please re-open the issue if that doesn't work. :+1: . @ahmedelgabri You forgot to update maxDate from \"today\" to TODAY\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/hv45xrzu/. Hello,\nPlease make a jsfiddle demonstrating the issue, and I'll do whatever possible to help.. Hello,\nI don't see any problems with typing the year into the input.\nIts much faster than having the user go through multiple unnecessary views via plethora of clicks.. Thanks for chiming in @crashkonijn \nYes, it'd be great if users knew they could simply input the date. As a first step, I've added a text cursor to the year input. Next, I'll probably give the year an off-white background to make it stand out.\nIf you've got any more ideas on how to improve this, please feel free to do it right here :). @pirco selects  are possible with plugins, but I've opted against them for many reasons. Selects have limitations. Out of all calendars I've worked with, none had a simple and efficient way of year input. Nearly all of them involve clicking around multiple times to select a year. Year selection should be so user-friendly that its invisible.\n\nwe just need to look for a way to communicate better that It's possible to change the year there.. Hi all,\n\nThanks for the notice.\nI'll have these methods restored by v3.0.7 very soon.. On it. The static methods will be a part of the next release :). Yeah,  these methods slipped by in the big rewrite but no worries. And if you're just using moment for parsing or formatting, you should be able to ditch it for the built-in static methods.. @davidm-public flatpickr has a date format specifically for JSON-stringified ISO dates, you should be able to use that. flstpickr also stores the selected Date objects if you need them. Take a look at the docs if you're curious . Hello,\nflatpickr simply sets the input type to time - the rest is handled by how your browser/os handles the input.\nTry playing with the step attribute of your flatpickr input.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=input+type+time+hide+seconds\n. Looks great, thank you for the effort! :+1:  :+1: . @nfriedly Absolutely. @tw15egan v3.0.7 is out. v3.0.7 is out. Hello,\nYou're right that onChange and onValueUpdate are not always triggered by user input.\nHowever, methods that do trigger these events through code have options to disable event triggering, e.g. setDate() takes a second param  (bool) allowing you to disable firing onChange and others.\nWould using those parameters make onSelect redundant in your case?. > What is the best way to handle time zones with Flatpickr?\n\nLet user pick dates in local time. \nUse the \"Z\" ISO date format which is the de facto standard for storing dates in databases\nApply transformations to the dates before passing them to flatpickr using some external library like https://github.com/smallwins/spacetime or moment.js\n\nI'm still exploring the best way to go about it and whether there's anything flatpickr can do to make dealing with dates less painful. Thanks you for your insight @emilv\nI think this deserves a page on the documentation.. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange-datestrformat. @PieterSwitten sounds like an issue with the weeks plugin. Hello,\nWhich aspects of the time picker did you find hard to use?\nPlease be more specific\n. duplicate of https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/747. Thanks @ankurk91\n@bedakb please reopen if you still experience any issues\n. Thank you for reporting the issue!\nThis will be fixed by v3.0.8\n. @ven007 flatpickr is flexible enough for your use case. \nWhat you need to do is allow the user to create addition date inputs (for every day) and also time inputs for those days.\nHow you accomplish that is beyond the scope of flatpickr.. The month name is scrollable, making it easy to change months fast.\nRegarding a month selector, it could be implemented as a plugin.. > I think it would be great if the input would regain the focus after closing the date picker so that users can 'continue where they left off'. Now, the focus is always 'lost' when using the picker.\nThis is now the behavior in the latest release :tada:.\nTabbing overall is fixed in v4.2.2 out very soon.. Hello,\nThe issue is already fixed in the typescript branch and is due to land within the next few days.\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/pull/1016. Thank you for contributing :+1: :+1: . Hello,\nPlease update your PR against the master branch if you'd like to see this plugin in the repo.\nThank you.. Sounds like a perfect usecase for https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#jumptodate-date\nUse it to set the calendar view to any date you want.. Hello,\nThank you for reporting the issue!\nIts now fixed in the typescript branch and should land within the next week.. Hello,\nset() has its limitations.\none cannot easily switch around, say, from mode: \"range\" to mode: \"multiple\" and so on.\nWhy? Because flatpickr has about four dozen options. Implementing dynamic behavior for all of those and all the possible combinations is not trivial.\nThe recommended way to go about this is to create a new instance, which is cheap and only takes a few ms.. Hello,\nAs mentioned earlier, the font-weight is there simply for visual purposes, rather than emphasis.\nWhile there's work to be done regarding accessibility (which for me is not just a \"feature\", but a requirement), I consider this a non-issue.\nBut thank you for raising concern about it regardless!. Hello,\nOf course that is possible.\nWhile I won't implement it for you, here's how it would work:\n\nonReady() - check if date is preloaded and save it somewhere\nCreate your own \"clear\" button, and use setDate() to reset the selected date to the one saved in step 1\n\nCheck out the documentation for details.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/localization/. Hello,\nWhat do you mean by the server time?\nThe highlighted cell is displaying a date.. Hello,\nflatpickr always lets users pick datetime using their local timezone and time.\nIts not possible to integrate complex datetime manipulation without significantly bloating the library.\nI recommend letting the user pick datetime locally then translate it to other timezones using libraries such as moment.js.. Hello,\nTimezones and date manipulation is outside of flatpickr's scope. \nI recommend using dateFormat: \"Z\" or capturing the date object, then using libraries such as https://github.com/smallwins/spacetime or moment.js to deal with timezones.. Fixed in the TS branch, due to land soon.\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/pull/1016. Hello,\nThings should be much easier very soon because flatpickr has been ported to typescript.\nWatch out for the next release.. v3.1.2 is out with typings included.. Fixed by 3e1edde. Hello,\nPlease provide a jsfiddle so I can reproduce the issue.\nThank you.. Hello,\nSorry for the inconvenience.\nThe static parseDate and formatDate methods will be available by next release.\nThank you.. Hello,\nI don't see any problems.\nmaxDate is inclusive, thus defaultDate must be bigger than maxDate for it to cancel out.. Hello,\nSorry for the lack of attention - flatpickr is currently being rewritten and due to limited time documentation and issues get less attention than usual.\nDid you figure out a solution to the issue?. Hello @WaYdotNET \nflatpickt has latestSelectedDateObj which already does the same thing.\nThanks for contributing!. > Maybe the possible solution could be to move triggering of Change to the end of the function?\nFixed in v4. Hello,\nThat could indeed be a very helpful addition to the range mode.\nHowever, its unlikely to be a part of the core, considering how easy it'd be to implement it as a plugin.\nYou could create the plugin yourself, or wait for me to implement it (which could take considerable time due to busyness).. Hello,\nappendTo wasn't really created for your use case no. 3.\nI believe the static option is what you're looking for.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/hm9ahv97/. @filipemir appendTo is typically used for inline calendars. \n\nIs there an expectation that the element onto which the calendar is appended will never be offset from the body?\n\nCorrect. For relative positioning, there is the static option.. :+1:. Hello,\nI can't replicate it here https://jsfiddle.net/210tfnLq/1/. @rorc you're using wrap: true and didnt mark your input with the data-input attribute.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/210tfnLq/4/. @rorc this seems more like a vue issue now. \nBut try assigning a ref to the section element.\n```vue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    export default {\n        props: ['value', 'params', 'placeholder'],\n        mounted() {\n            this.instance = $(this.$refs.section).flatpickr(_.merge({\n                wrap: true,\n                enableTime: true,\n                dateFormat: 'Y-m-d H:i'\n            }, this.params || {}));\n        }\n    }\n\n```. Hello,\nYou can customize the dateFormat and altFormat options to display the date as you wish.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/options/. Yes, I've fixed this during the typescript migration.\nThanks for opening the issue anyway :+1:. Hello,\nThe today button should be a plugin.\nYou could look at existing plugins and create one as you wish.. Fixed on master. Awesome, thank you :+1:. Hello,\nI see no problems here https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/\nPlease provide a jsfiddle to reproduce the issue. Awesome, thank you!. Hello,\nPlease update your PR against the latest master.\nThank you.. Hello,\nThe parseDate and formatDate methods will be available on the flatpickr function by the next release.\nGlad you're pleased with the plugin :). Hello,\nThe disable option must be an array. \nJust wrap your function in []. Oh. locale should be flatpickrSv.sv instead of flatpickrSv. duplicate of https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/893. Hello,\nDynamically changing options like mode, enableTime, and others is not supported at the moment.\nflatpickr has many options with dozens of possible combinations. To support changing all of those  at any time would significantly bloat the codebase.\nFor now, the best way to solve your problem is to just recreate an instance. \nThank you.. Hello,\nI suggest using the onDayCreate hook and applying style directly to day elements.\nSomething like day.style.color = \"red\"\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/events/#ondaycreate. Fantastic work.\nThank you.. Hello,\nThe issue is already fixed on master.\nA release will be out very soon.. https://unpkg.com/flatpickr/dist/. Hello,\nThis is done on purpose, as time input does nothing if a date is not selected.\nIf you'd like to show it at all times, see https://jsfiddle.net/66cy6omq/. Hello,\nApologies for the breakage.\nGenerally, backwards compatiblity is retained regarding what's documented, but looks like this one slipped away.\nThere isn't much purpose in bumping the semver-major at this point.\n\nThe source code has been re-architected, rewritten and simplified. FlatpickrInstance.prototype has been removed completely in the aforementioned process.\nThank you. The docs are now updated.\nThe suggestion is made under the assumption that plain script tags will not be deployed to production environments. Users should rely on package managers with proper versioning of dependencies instead.. @erjiang that is rather eye-opening. I will definitely mention this in the docs.\n\nThanks! \ud83d\udc4d . @kbuchanan feel free to drop down to v3.0.7 if everything worked fine for you then :)\nOnce you're ready to upgrade, you can install v4.. Fixed on master.\nNew release out soon.. flatpickr.parseDate and flatpickr.formatDate are now always available in v4.2.0. Hello,\nThanks for reporting the issue. \nI've traced it down to the new positionElement option.\nThe issue should be resolved now as of v3.1.3\nPlease re-include the latest version and check if it fixes your problem.. Hello,\nI've released v3.1.5 which contains the dist folder to prevent breakage.\nv4 and onwards, however, I see less purpose in containing and versioning it in the repository.. Fixed in v3.1.4, available right now.. @NekR @AaronHarris sounds good. . Hello,\nThank you for reporting the issue.\nThe error seems to be due to locale files being ES modules now.\nI have updated the documentation https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/localization/. Hello,\nHow are you importing flatpickr?\nIf you're importing from the dist folder, the node module itself shouldn't be typechecked.\nI'll see if including tsconfig.json will fix the errors.. I've included tsconfig.json in v3.1.4.\nPlease check if the issue persists.\nThank you.. @phivan those paths are based on the baseUrl option in the tsconfig, and looks like typescript does not take it into consideration.\nI'll see what can be done.. @vince-koch indeed, it can be resolved that way. But it is not a solution, it is a workaround.\nI will see if typescript folks can do something about this. \nIf not, I will switch to relative paths for the next release.\nPlease use the workaround posted by @Phivan meanwhile.\nThank you all for your patience.. Hi @JamesJGoodwin \nUsing plugins and locales with plain script tags is still possible.\nBefore including the scripts, just add\njs\nwindow.exports = {};\nLike \nhtml\n<script>\nwindow.exports = {};\n</script>\n<script src=\".../rangePlugin.js\"></script>\nI'll add this to documentation shortly.. Hi all,\nAs of v4.0.1, out now, locales and plugins are UMD modules.\nThe window.exports hack is no longer necessary.\nThis means that they can be consumed via both script tags or imports painlessly.\nIts my goal to make flatpickr as easy to use as possible for end-users, and complicating things was not in my plans - its rather just a side effect of such a major overhaul, but it is for the better.\nThank you for your patience.\n. Hello,\nPlease update your PR to commit against the docs branch.\ngh-pages is auto-generated.. Fixed in v4.0.3. Hello,\nThank you for reporting the issue.\nIt is now fixed and published in v4.0.2. Noted.\nWill be addressed within a few patch releases.. Fixed on master by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/fe9a968f74e91c5b991df0c46bb11bd38d88c9c9. Hello @JamesJGoodwin \nThank you for the valuable feedback.\nThe rangePlugin is in beta for a reason.\n\nI'd like to mention that rangePlugin example is not working on example page.\n\nFixed.\nI've just made the following improvements:\n1. defaultDate now works properly - you can now preload dates by passing in an array to defaultDate\n2. Animations are fixed as well\nCould you also clarify what you mean by:\n\nI'd really like to select dates from the very beginning rather then changing already chosen dates by adding the parameter reselect: true in config.\n\nLet's improve the plugin further and I'll make those changes a part of the next release.. @JamesJGoodwin changes made their way into v4.0.4.\nPlease check it out and let me know if anything is missing.. Thanks @ankurk91 \nShould be fixed right now.. Hello,\nThe UTC support was removed due to numerous issues, and a plugin would be the best way to go for implementation. Your current approach is optimal at the moment.\nAlso see the larger discussion at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/975. Hello,\nI have never used yii thus I cannot help you much there.\nFeel free to use script tags or npm/yarn.. Yeah, typescript does complain about the constructor functions sometimes.\nFortunately, you can avoid the new keyword in plugins[] without any repercussions.. Fixed in v4.0.5, available right now.\nThanks for reporting the issue.. I think an error handler would be the best way to go here.\nFrom there, you could parse the error message if you wish.. @begincalendar v4.0.6 is out. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/plugins/#rangeplugin-beta. Hello,\nThank you for the idea.\nWhile I see the benefit of having time_24hr be dependent on locale, I would still opt to preserve current behavior for consistency and instead have users explicitly specify the option.. Thank you for explaining your rationale and use case. I strive to make flatpickr easy to use and thus am more lenient towards consistency \nHowever, it is likely that changes will be made to make your use case easier to implement. . @matthewslaney on a second thought, I'd imagine most European users would be more familiar with the 24hr system. I think its best if the time_24hr field is optionally a part of the locale.. Please elaborate.\nIf you're trying to limit time range for the time picker, you can use minDate and maxDate for that.. https://jsfiddle.net/qnctj3ek/1/. Hello,\nIt appears that bulma removes box-shadow from readonly inputs.\n\nThere are a few solutions:\n\nSet flatpickr config allowInput: true, which will allow user input and remove readonly\nApply custom css to readonly inputs to match non-readonly inputs.\n. Hello,\n\nIt appears that closeFlatpickr() relies on the mousedown event firing on document.\nIn v4 the event is bound to window.document.body, because document is not considered an Element.\nts\nbind(window.document.body, \"mousedown\", onClick(documentClick));\nThis change made effectively no difference for the end user experience, I'd suggest simply adding .body in your function body.\nThank you for reporting this.\nPlease don't hesitate to open new issues if you ever encounter any problems.. Hello,\nYou should customize altFormat to the format you wish.\nAlso, instead of data-altFormat=\"d.m.Y H:i\" it should be data-alt-format=\"d.m.Y H:i\". Hello,\nI see how your situation is different.\nThis issue has been raised before at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/750.\nClosing this as duplicate for now.. Yes, just add an onReady hook and check if there is config.defaultDate.\nSomething like\njs\nonReady: (dates, datestr, f) => f.config.defaultDate && f.setDate(f.config.defaultDate, true)\nI will add an ability to trigger events manually in a future release. Hello,\nThe ability is already there, it just that the Russian locale is missing the translation.\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/l10n/fr.ts and https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/l10n/ru.ts for comparison.. Hello,\nThat's a viable scenario and I think it must be possible to achieve.\nWill keep this issue updated (but no ETAs at this time due to time constraints). Hello!\nselectedDates property is an array of selected dates, but looks like you're treating it as a date object in your function. I'd start there.\nYou can also use flatpickr to format the date as you wish.\nLike:\njs\nfp.formatDate(date, \"Ymd\"); // \"19720201\". Hello,\nYou can already achieve what you want by destroying an existing instance and re-creating it.. Hello,\nThis is an issue with Chromium mobile and flatpickr has nothing to do with it.\nI am not going to incorporate hacks that don't even work to workaround this problem.. Hello,\nYou're right. The dist folder is available in the dist.tar file that's attached to every release.. Hello,\nThank you for bringing attention to the issue.\nThe performance with hundreds of pickers is clearly subpar.\nI believe with some fine-tuning for your usecase the loading time can be reduced significantly.. Fixed on master.\n\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/66szgfcd/. Hello,\nHow are you trying to append it?\nAre you using https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/events/#ondaycreate ?. Glad you figured it out.\nI'd still recommend using onDayCreate, which gives you access to dayElement, but its up to you.. Hello,\nPlease elaborate, ideally with an example so I can find the issue and fix it.\nThank you \ud83d\udc4d . Hello,\nI'm not exactly sure what you're trying to achieve, but I guess that you're trying to use minDate to set the minimum time for the time picker.\nThe problem lies in the difference of dates, which are not visible in the time picker. The date in the time picker is today's date, while the one you were trying to pass in was likely a different one.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/nq06yppg/ for the solution. Hello,\nThanks for reporting this!\nThe typings are a bit of a pain right now (see also #1100), but everything should be fixed by next release.\nI'd suggest finding a workaround, most likely by circumventing type checking if its preventing you from building your project.. Should be fixed in v4.1 out right now. @ghiscoding yes, please report back if it works on angular.\nand thanks for the kind words. . @ghiscoding :( thats unfortunate. Have you tried using require() to import flatpickr instead?\ne.g.\nts\nconst flatpickr = require(\"flatpickr\"). Hello,\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/1094\nflatpickr can't do much about browser vendors not supporting this basic feature (which is frankly unacceptable).\nYou can try hacks such as the css content, but I won't make this a part of the library.. Hello, \nWhat are you trying to do exactly?\nThe proper way to update selected date in flatpickr is to use setDate(). Hello,\nThanks for reporting this.\nI'll investigate and see what can be done.. Hey @kmagilavy \nThe fix is even simpler and doesn't require modifying existing dates.\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/commit/3f2a9acbbe10f4af84e74f8571032c9aae4ce7bb\nThanks a bunch for reporting the issue & for the PR.. Hello,\nYes, toggling some properties like mode and enableTime doesn't work dynamically.\nThis is intentional due to the sheer number of options available making this functionality unfeasible without bloating the codebase.\nI suggest simply recreating the instance, which is cheap.. @loveorigami the rangePlugin doesn't yet check the second input's value, but for now it will work if you use defaultDate option instead. Sounds good.\nThanks for bringing attention to this.. @FyiurAmron correct.\nThis is why docs don't mention setting options with data attributes, they get mixed up way too often.. Hello,\nThanks for reporting this.\nTabbing will be fixed. Positioning can definitely be made optional as well.\nWatch out for the next release.. Sounds good.\nI'll likely just convert them to data attributes.\nThanks for bringing this to attention\ud83d\udc4d . Hello,\nYes, I'm aware that mobile implementation isn't the best, or rather is almost non-existent. Once the plugin is polished and ready, so will mobile support.\n. Thanks for reporting this guys.\nLooks like some kind of a build artifcact.\nI've run a rebuild which fixed the issue and published v4.1.2. Fixed. Published v4.1.3. Hello,\nRegarding two inputs as a solution - try https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/plugins/#rangeplugin-beta. In that case, I suggest adding a clear button to be able to select the dates again.\nSomething like https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#flatpickr-external-elements. Hello,\ndist.tar is available on the releases page (https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/releases)\nIt is not version-controlled on purpose.\nThe npm package also contains the dist folder.. Done :)\nSee the bottom section of https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr\nGlad you enjoyed working with the library . Thanks!. Hi Alex,\nInstead of passing a string to defaultDate, try passing down the date object itself.. @Alex5791 here it is on iphone 6 + ios 8 with {\n  defaultDate: Date.now()\n}\nUnsure what else I can do to help.\nAlso, keep in mind that date.getMonth() is zero-indexed, meaning January is 0 and December is 11/\n\n. Hello,\nWhat you want is the position option, with the value \"above\".\nSee https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/types/options.ts#L193 for details\n. Looking into this.. Hello,\nThe screenshot you're seeing referred to flatpickr v1 at the time, which was tiny (~9.4kb). And while I am very strict about features making into core, the library has obviously grown in size since then due to supporting things like time picking, range/multiple mode, etc.\nThe screenshot will be updated soon, along with the README which is also somewhat outdated.. @gety9 you could always use older versions :)\nAlso, despite all the features we're still far smaller (12kb gzipped + no dependencies) than the competition.. Hello!\nI've just added some time picker examples to docs.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#time-picker-w-limits. That'd be a duplicate of  https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/750\nThis feature is still in development. I finally got some time now so I'll try to get it in by next release :)\n. Hello!\nThanks for reporting this. \nThere seemed to be a few gaps in the am/pm localization. Everything's resolved now and I'll get a release out very shortly.\nThanks again \ud83d\udc4d . Hello,\nThe issue is that flatpickr doesn't reposition itself when its closed, thus when you resize the view it remains in its position which is potentially outside the new width.\nI'll see what can be done.\nP.S. nice calendar styling . @BabkinAleksandr fixed now since closed flatpickr instances now have display:none. @murraycollingwood sorry for your troubles. The release you're on already includes that bugfix. I will get a new release out in a few days, see if that will help resolve your issues.. @murraycollingwood there have been 4 new releases since. Please check if the issue still exists. If it does, I will have it fixed asap. Hello,\nI don't see any issues. \nAfter clicking the link, the calendar closes and the month changes to may 2018.\nWhat problem are you having?. I see.\nchangeMonth() simply changes the current month in the calendar, it doesn't affect the selected date.\nIf you wanna manipulate the date(s), use the selectedDates field which contains the selected dates, add months to it, then update the selected date.\nSomething like https://jsfiddle.net/chmln/3fqd91um/1/\n:)\n. Is it failing at console.error?\nThere's no [-1] anywhere in the flatpickr codebase.\nI need to see more to understand what the issue is and whether flatpickr has anything to do with it.. Hello,\nPlease try this again with the latest release.\nIf that still doesn't work, unfortunately its hard to find time to debug interop with third-party libraries in depth.\nI would guess the issue stems from a minifier of some sort with possibly unsafe optimizations. Otherwise I'd turn to stackoverflow for answers.\nThank you for understanding \ud83d\udc4d . Hello,\n\nbut not working\n\nPlease elaborate.. Hello,\nHere it is in iOS 8 on iPhone 6.\n\nGoing forward, make sure to provide more details about the problem you're experiencing if you expect to receive gratuitous help.. Hello,\nThis isn't really a problem with flatpickr, but I could suggest maybe refreshing the calendar instance every X minutes/hours?\ne.g. \njs\nconst config =  { // config };\nflatpickr(yourInput, config)\nsetInterval(() => flatpickr(yourInput, config), 1000 * 60 * 180 //3 hours);\n. Hello,\nI don't see bugs there - the time picker is not supposed to update the time on ALL dates.\nIf you want to update the time on ALL dates, you can hook into onChange and do so :). @Chinese1904 you're most welcome. I'm glad you found the library useful.. Hello,\nThis happens because instance is destroyed and re-created, and when it is destroyed, the input value is reset to nothing. Is using defaultDate not feasible in your case?. Hello,\nAre you including the CSS?\ndist/flatpickr.css. I see.\nCould you inspect that arrow and ensure that flatpickr's CSS is applying?\n\n. @DanielOlarte no problem. glad it worked out :). Hello,\nThe issue is not with flatpickr but with Vue, since onChange is being called - that's easy to verify with a console.log. See https://jsfiddle.net/hooh7qrf/1/ for the solution too.\nAlso\n\nLooks like Vue doesn't detect a change perhaps bc the array comes from flatpickr.\ndateObj in your fiddle is actually an array. Hello @ankurk91 \n\nThanks for contributing!\n\nIn order to hook into various events in flatpickr we have to pass methods in config.\nThis PR enables another way to hook into them.\n\nWhat use-case does this accommodate? Hooks are arrays which you can modify/push/etc.\nI don't see what problem this is solving.\n. #1096 is now fixed. Hello, \nThanks for contributing!\nFortunately, flatpickr has moved away from directly calling console. Please use the errorHandler option instead, like https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/index.ts#L1916\n. Hello @timrogers \nI've thought about this for a while, and realized that this shouldn't really be an error.\nRangePlugin (which is in alpha) only temporarily doesn't work on mobile, because I haven't gotten around to it yet. \nThere's no need to spam console to force users to disableMobile. If we're gonna do that, we should instead force set disableMobile until the functionality is implemented.\nIn hindsight, I should have given this a bit more thought. If you'd still like to update your PR, that'd be amazing.\nThanks again for contributing \ud83d\udc4d . @KAN16 Check out https://github.com/mjeanroy/bower-npm-resolver\nThere were many reasons to omit dist from the repo.\n\nThere is no need to version the transpiled source\n\nUsers constantly submitted pull requests against the dist folder despite contribution guidelines stressing against this. @KAN16 \n\n\nCan't reproduce this issue. I've just tested it on IE11 and picking dates using arrows work. The fact that it doesn't close on focus is a known bug and will be fixed.\n\nPlease wait until the next release.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/options/ allowInput: true. Hello,\n\nFrom what I understand now IE and Edge implement an obsolete version of the KeyboardEvent spec. Sad, but not very surprising.\nYes, a PR to fix IE this issue would be amazing :). Sounds good.\nIf those are all the changes necessary, I'm all for it. :). js\n{\n    ignoredFocusElements: [window.document.body]\n}. @rcubitto this will be in the next release, out within the next few days.. Hello @IrosTheBeggar \nHave you tried using static: true in options?\nI think that should solve your problem.. Hello,\nYou can either enforce the picker position (to open above or below the input) or show the time input at all times. I'd probably go with the former.\nTry either\njs\n{\n  position: \"above\"\n}\nor\njs\n{\n  onReady () {\n    this.showTimeInput = true;\n  }\n}. Hey @amitnjha \n\nTue Dec 05 2017 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST)\n\nYou're probably passing the date object, instead of the date string.. > can it be made to return the string instead which is being displayed on the textbox?\nThe reproduction link is required for a reason. I have no idea how you're retrieving the date value and thus can't provide much help.. Hello,\nCan't repro this.\nWhat exactly isn't working?\n\n. Hello,\nThank you for pointing out the error, and especially for the link to a correct implementation.\nAs you mentioned, there might be some other edge-cases, but the new implementation should be good enough for now.. Hello,\nThat is a massive example and I frankly don't have the time to dig through it.\nPlease provide a minimal reproduction.\nThank you.. Hello,\nNot quite sure why you're getting that error.\nMake sure the script is imported before you're calling it. :)\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/37p69kua/. Hello,\nPlease take a look at the documentation.\nThere are answers for all of your questions.\nStart from https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#24-hour-time-picker. Hello,\nPerhaps its not working because hooks are collected into an array.\nTry this:\njs\n// once your data is loaded, do this\nfp.config.onDayCreate = [\n  function (dObj, dStr, fp, dayElem) { }\n];\nfp.redraw();. Awesome, thanks! :+1:. Hey @mdesantis \nAfter initialization, the onchange and other hook options are arrays. You should do something like\njs\n// after init\ninstance.config.onChange.push(function() { } );. Its a rather rare scenario so its not documented yet, but I think it should be.\nI'd rather over-document things than have users guessing. https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/localization/. Hello,\nflatpickr does check whether the input is a valid date.\nIts not an exception, but a console warning.\nYou can handle errors yourself if you dont want them in the console.\nUse the errorHandler option.\njs\n{\n  errorHandler: (error) => { \n    // do something\n  }. No problem :+1:. It should really be documented better. @bnjbvr fixed in #1196. Hello,\nI'd just get the latest selected date.\nTry \njs\nfp.latestSelectedDateObj.getDate(). Hello,\nThanks for reporting this.\nI've added a unit test to prevent this from happening ever again.\nv4.2.2 is out as of now with fixed code.. v4.2.2 is out with src/style folder included :). @karolyi I was testing the new prepublish hook that runs tests and a build before publishing to prevent errors like #1184. Hello,\nI couldn't reproduce this.\nMore info would be helpful.. @TrancePaul thanks for the feedback. Will look into it as soon as possible. Hello,\nThank you for the suggestion. \ud83d\udc4d \nHowever, I believe that the appearance of inputs is outside the scope of this library.. @depz your config is missing wrap: true\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#flatpickr-external-elements. To those who are still experiencing problems, if you could provide a repro on jsfiddle, I could take a shot at fixing the issue.  Not much I can do otherwise. @isaacrector If nothing works, try the ignoredFocusElements: [] option and add the bootstrap body element there. A click on any of the elements (or their children) provided in the array won't close the calendar. \nThen you can use something like https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/plugins/#confirmdate to close the calendar instead.. @danielleplatt95 try using the static: true option. Hey all,\nAs I mentioned in https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/1205, scrollwheel support will likely be removed very soon.\nI suggest you keep this PR open until the changes land on master and follow #1205 for progress.. Scrolling now removed from master :)\n@VMBindraban yes, it would be pretty easy to make this a plugin\n. @petermonte  \nI believe there's a solution without adding any extra features.\nCheck this out: https://jsfiddle.net/voqw0pcj/\n\nP.S. that looks great \ud83d\udc4d \nWould you ever be interested releasing that as a theme (with my help of course) ?. @mattkoch614 february 2018 has 28 days, which is why maxDate isn't working as it should. \nChange maxDate to \"2018-02-28\" and it works properly.. @demasseb \nI'd recommend you first try using flatpickr directly, instead of vue-flatpickr-component and see if that fixes the issue. @mjoc1985 @demasseb I would need a minimal repro to establish that this is a problem with flatpickr and not caused by anything else. Not much can be done otherwise.. Thanks for the feedback @demasseb.\nIf you could provide a stack trace, it'd be very valuable. I'd like to fix this edgecase so it doesn't happen to any users in the future.. @tarasleshko that would be too big of a change.\nInstead, https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/747 would make range selections easier.. Work-in-progress\n\n. @JonTryggvi I wouldn't suggest using it just yet for range selections, but its up to you.. Hello,\nThis issue has been discussed in length at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/942\ntl;dr - this is caused by over-aggressive minification by uglify or something like cssnano\nIf nothing works, you can disable animations via animate: false. Hey @plashenkov \nI am actually considering removing scrollwheel support entirely.\nFrom my observations, most users are not even aware of the scrolling functionality (even despite the tooltips).. @tobysommer thanks for the kind words :)\nno precise ETAs, but this will be done very soon.. Fixed by https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/pull/1206. In your if-else blocks, just do instance.set(\"maxTime\", \"00:00\");. @dogansalman its the rangeSeparator key in the locale. See for example https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/l10n/fr.ts#L64\nWhich locale are you using? It would be great to get a PR and add the missing rangeSeparator. Hello @misantronic \nAnd thank you for contributing :)\nI think the best way to solve this problem though is to simply omit tsconfig.json in .npmignore. It doesn't need to be there at all.\nWould you mind updating the PR?. Perfect.. You have to install the flatpickr npm package using https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower-npm-resolver. https://flatpickr.js.org/getting-started/. @cocowalla after initialization, you can check the number of onValueUpdate hooks in your flatpickr instance. The weekSelect plugin provides one.. duplicate of https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/1201. Hello@koddr :)\nYou can either not use altInput OR convert the selected date from one format to another before submission.\nFor that, I'd suggest storing the flatpickr instance in your component.. Hello,\nThis is not possible at the moment.\nHowever, I will consider it for implementation in the future..\nIf you need multiple ranges right now, you could achieve that by adding more calendars on user's demand.. Hello @tlawandi \nThere isn't a way to clear these dates automatically, and I don't think there will be.\nThese options exist for a reason (to limit the date range!) and the existing behavior is satisfactory for the vast majority of users.\nWhat you can do, trivially: before preloading, check min/maxDate. If it falls outside the range, clear out the minDate/maxDate.. Thanks for the insight @sa-lat \nI'll see what can be done. Hello,\nTry upgrading to 4.3.0.\nThat should fix the issue.. formatDate will now accept the locale as the third optional argument :). @bbansal15 I can't really help as you didn't give any information.\nSince this could also be an old bug and you're not willing to update, this would require a lot more time on my part to debug. As much as I'd like to help, my time is very constrained right now.\nI could suggest you take advantage of stackoverflow or other resources.\nBest of luck. Hello @guillaumegarcia13 \nThere are two ways to go:\n\nYou set clickOpens: false and call fp.open() on the flatpickr instance yourself. You can add a clickevent listener to the input manually, etc.\nRemove the autofocus\n\nI think the first one is more appropriate for you.\nMay also want to look into https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/#flatpickr-external-elements. Hello @simshaun \nThanks for contributing!\nI stumbled a much simpler way to check IE11 without amending global interfaces.\nIE11 has navigator.msMaxTouchPoints set to a non-undefined value.\nBy checking this, we can avoid adding ten extra lines to the source.\nCheers. Thank you for finding the cause of the issue and your time :fire: :fire:\nGreat contribution.. Perfect, thanks!. Please look at the examples in the documentation, they should guide you in the right direction.\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/examples/\nIf that doesn't work, please create a new issue with a jsfiddle reproduction link.\nThank you. Thank you!. Fixed in v4.3.0\nHere's a fiddle using v4.2.4 - https://jsfiddle.net/wrsgns5h/\nAnd v4.3.0 (fixed) https://jsfiddle.net/7d4fgwmq/1/. Hey guys,\nAfter some investigation, this looks like bad behavior on Bootstrap's part. flatpickr just does something like dayElement.focus() and hourElement.select() and bootstrap will fire some blur event - causing flatpickr to close.\nNeedless to say, fix incoming :). Hello,\nSee the console log at https://jsfiddle.net/Ls80skzL/ for why that is the case.\nI'd suggest sticking to the same format (I recommend \"Z\") where possible to avoid issues like these.. @Bigdragon13th yes, this is because flatpickr is exported as an es module.\nLets channel the discussion to https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/1199. @Autre31415 a lot of effort was put into proper bundling and typings in v4.4. sorry if it caused breakage, but all is proper now :). Hello,\n\nIs it possible to enable / disable a date on click?\n\nDo you mean to disable a date after selecting it, or is this just a concern with appearance?\nLogically, disabled dates are not meant to be select-able. Otherwise they should not be disabled.. @CptMeatball you're welcome. :). Hello@tyera \nH is the 24-hour token. What you probably want is lowercase h.\nSee https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/formatting/\n:). Hello,\nPlease update the reproduction link. Its required for a reason.\nThank you.. @strongui don't worry about the plugin. Just add your config in the example and I will handle the rest. See https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/formatting/. @strongui tokens are not based on moment or other library. Also, in most cases you don't need to know the tokens in detail. Just use dateFormat: \"Z\" and altInput + altFormat.. Hello @denniskoerner \nThank you for reporting this.\nThe issue lies in the fact that display:none elements have a width of zero, which results in a wrong calculation here.. I have been considering this for a while as well.\nAn org suits the project much better as it expands.. Hello,\nNot all original input attributes are carried over.\nBesides, why use size instead of css width?\nsize is inconsistent across different browsers and their possible font settings.. Awesome. Thanks @dbroytman. @bs-iris The multiple-months branch will be merged in a few days.\nAlso, to generate build, all you need to do is clone the repo and run npm install && npm run build. @KayakinKoder \n```js\n{\n  onReady (_, __, fp) {\n    fp.calendarContainer.classList.add(\"myClass\");\n  }\n}\n. Thanks @imjonrourke for the contribution :)\nI don't think an option is necessary however.\nJust add the disabled class and hide the arrows via display:none by default.\nIf you wanna show the arrows for whatever reason, you can override this with custom CSS.\n. Great work, thanks all for contributing :+1:. @Alfredo-Delgado whenever I get free time. the next release is highly anticipated, but with the plethora of recent changes additional testing is necessary to prevent bugs from creeping into users' production.\nIf I gave an ETA it would be within the next 3-5 days . @CarlNation \nYes. You can use CSS and turn the circle into a square and do anything else as you wish.. In the next release, it will be\njs\n{\n  showMonths: 6\n}. @webinsane this has been available for a few months now. @DevelGitH within the next few days. :). @mammad2c I know :<, I've just been extremely busy + with such a big feature some more testing is necessary. Should be out in a few days. @blairexico does your validator run on the mobile input or your original input?\nAlso, the mobile input is exposed on the instance under the mobileInput key.. @marikv it will be published as soon as possible. I'm ironing out some rough edges.. @liborm85 I will investigate and see if a good solution can be found. Will keep this issue updated. @picktarget just omit the \"new\" keyword. The plugin will work regardless. @Picktarget try\nts\nimport * as  confirmDatePlugin from 'flatpickr/dist/plugins/confirmDate/confirmDate';. @Picktarget the same way. @Picktarget okay, try this:\nts\nimport  confirmDatePlugin from 'flatpickr/src/plugins/confirmDate/confirmDate';\n. @Picktarget No. I will investigate this myself and update the issue when I find a solution :)\nFor now, try using require() instead of importing to avoid type errors.. @Picktarget this is now fixed in v4.4\n. @Picktarget yes. just import it like normal (import flatpickr from \"flatpickr\") and call it like normal. The rest is in the documentation.\nLet me know if you can't figure this out.\nAnd feel free to create new issues if the docs are unclear or if you face other problems :). @feelslike1929 That would be suitable for a plugin. It'd be rather simple too.\nAll you have to do is:\n\nHook into onReady() - https://flatpickr.js.org/events/\nCreate an html element, maybe add buttons/links with ranges\nAdd event listeners to buttons/links and use setDate() to set the range\n\nThis plugin would look something like:\n```ts\nimport { Plugin } from \"flatpickr/dist/types/options\";\nfunction predefinedRangePlugin(): Plugin {\n  return function(fp) {\n    const pluginData = {};\nreturn {\n  onReady() {\n    // keep in mind - \"this\" is bound to the flatpickr instance\n\n    pluginData.predefRanges = this._createElement<HTMLDivElement>(\n      \"div\",\n      \"someClassName\"\n    );\n\n    const weekOne = this._createElement<HTMLAnchorElement>(\n      \"a\",\n      \"someClassName\",\n      \"Set Week 1\"\n    );\n\n    weekOne.addEventListener(\n      \"click\", \n      () => {\n        const start = new Date(this.currentYear, this.currentMonth, 1);\n        const end = new Date(this.currentYear, this.currentMonth, 8);\n        fp.setDate([start, end], false);\n      }\n    );\n\n    // then add some children\n    pluginData.predefRanges.appendChild(weekOne);\n    this.calendarContainer.appendChild(pluginData.predefRanges);\n  },\n};\n\n};\n}\nexport default predefinedRangePlugin;\n```. Hello @stoumann \nPlease consult the documentation.\nThe flatpickr instance always stores date objects in an array.\nhttps://flatpickr.js.org/instance-methods-properties-elements/#selecteddates. @picov Try this:\n1) Set wrap: true\n2) Add a hidden date input inside your container - `\n3) altInput should just work now. Great work, thank you @alexantr. @vannut your fiddle has errors.\nfp_tot is undefined. After fixing it, the fiddle appears to work.. Hello @tyera\nI like this idea. \nThis change is mostly cosmetic anyway - flatpickr tries to stay out of timezones as much as possible.\nWe have previously touched upon such issues - they are painful.\nhttps://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+timezone\n. Hello @tyera \nI believe there are better ways of customizing a locale.\nSomething like:\n```ts\nimport flatpickr from \"flatpickr\";\nimport { english } from \"flatpickr/dist/l10n/default\";\nconst MyEnglish = {\n  ...english,\n  amPM: [\"am\", \"pm\"],\n  // whatever\n};\n//  IF you want to set this locale as default in all flatpickr instances:\nflatpickr.defaultConfig.locale = MyEnglish;\n// done\n// ELSE, to set this locale for only specific instances:\nflatpickr(yourElem, {\n  locale: MyEnglish\n});\n``. @tyera please close the issue if the post above solved your problem. @howareyouo scrolling will be re-added in #1291. @csssxn you can change it dynamically by setting thelocaleoption on the instance after the lang file is loaded. The locale option can be a string, like\"ru\"` or an object.. @skatetdieu That's exactly what I'm planning to do.\nScroll functionality will be re-added as a plugin.. Hello @vuabid \nthat'd be\njs\n{\n  defaultDate: new Date()\n}. @okovpashko Yes, its confusing in your case, but there's  no point in using both defaultDate AND the input value.\nIf you do want to use the input's value, you can include it in defaultDate itself. . Hello @dsbert \nThanks for reporting this, and especially for the hints on how to fix this :)\nI'll get this in for the next release. @ankurk91 works now. Thanks for reporting this @ThomHurks @RedShift1 @Chris1904 \nv4.4.3 is out with the fix. @Chris1904 post your config or get me a repro link . @Chris1904 first thing that stood out for me was the calendar scrolling with the scrollbar - that shouldn't happen. Before we go any further, try using static: true and see if that fixes it.\nOtherwise, did you make any style changes to the calendar? And is the issue present without wrap: true also?. @andy-idp I think its because firefox displays dates in ISO format. Try \njs\nconsole.log(selectedDates.map(d => d.toString()), dateStr);\nand see if that's accurate.. @grzegorz-s if you know Polish, can you make a pull request?. Thanks @grzegorz-s !. @TheFelixR you're comparing strings instead of dates. \nHere's how you should do it: https://jsfiddle.net/7nyryp2b/. @mattlewis92 unfortunately I don't think I can change the typings now without causing more breaking changes for users. \nFrom my understanding, this issue only happens with older TypeScript versions, and therefore affects older @angular/cli versions as well. I have just tested the typings on a fresh ng project and confirmed that they work without errors (both compile-time and runtime).\nSince TypeScript doesn't follow semver, they have changed the way modules work multiple times in 2.x versions from 2.6 and onward. Needless to say, this has caused breakage for my relatively small library, and I imagine the dreadful magnitude of this on older, larger angular-based projects.\nThe only workaround I am aware of right now is using the esModuleInterop flag and possibly allowSyntheticDefaultImports, where typescript/ng upgrades are not feasible.. @MartinKoralek the scrolling functionality is already re-implemented as a plugin, and will be available as soon as the next release is out.. > I believe the issue is actually that the arrow function in this hook is not supported in IE \nYes, IE11 doesn't support arrow functions. You need to use a plain function(){} or transpile your code with babel before deploying to production.. @rbsmidt I will get a release out today . Hello @grzegorztomasiak \nThank you for your kind words.\nYes, there is a way to achieve what you want.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/ctykoy4L/2/. Hey @VD17593 \nYes, the modulo issue will definitely be addressed. I'm not very happy with the input behavior either.\nJust pressed for time right now in the midst of multiple exams :)\n. Hello @vannut \nWhat you probably want is:\n\nsend ajax requests from onMonthChange and onYearChange to query event data\nstore the queried event data somewhere \ncall redraw() after you get the data from the server, which will call onDayCreate\nuse the stored data in onDayCreate to indicate events/occupancy. @maartenmachiels you should move the instance.set part into the this.success(data).done(function () {. . @maartenmachiels you're most welcome :). Fixed @ v4.4.5. Thanks @Kyr !. @nl-finch thanks for the suggestion but I don't know Afrikaans so I can't do much about this right now.\n\nSomeone else (or you) are welcome to chime in and make a PR for the locale.. Fixed by #1334. . @atomiks this sounds like a good case for using the static: true option. Please let me know if that fixes your problem.. @atomiks That should be possible to fix with some CSS. It's still much better than repainting the calendar on every scroll. @peichhorn-arxes thanks for the great issue description and the PR.\nI'm in the midst of exams but I will be done in a few days and will review your work. :+1: . Hey @PieterSwitten @davidwallacejackson \nThanks for reporting this, and sorry about this one slipping through the cracks. \nI will get a new release out as soon as possible.\n:). Hello @projct1 \nCould you please test whether this happens in the latest version as well (v4.4)?. @projct1 couldn't reproduce it. See https://jsfiddle.net/y39gu56n/. Hello @damienlethiec \nThat's interesting, because locale strings like \"fr\" still work in the browser when included as a script.\nI think I know why this happened to you, but let me ask: where does flatpickr come from in your script? \nYou're just importing it via import flatpickr from \"flatpickr\"; right?. @damienlethiec Does this fix the issue for you?\n```js\nimport flatpickr from \"flatpickr\";\nimport \"flatpickr/dist/themes/light.css\";\nwindow.flatpickr = flatpickr;\nimport \"flatpickr/dist/l10n/fr.js\";\nflatpickr(\"#datepicker\", {\n  locale: \"fr\"\n});\n```. Hello @Smaxor5 \nAre you using the range plugin? https://flatpickr.js.org/plugins/#rangeplugin-beta\nIf so, it should populate the second input when you setDate(). If that's not happening, please let me know.. @eduardochiaro thanks for the feedback! this looks like a problem with the rangePlugin - it doesn't react to setDate properly.. @lukasjuhas I'm always open to new ideas on how to enhance the date/time pickers. Would you mind providing more screenshots of this setup?. @ParthWeb I'm not sure - not too familiar with angular. I believe your issue belongs in the  https://github.com/mezoistvan/ng2-flatpickr project instead.. @InnocentPuff this happens because Bootstrap somehow capture's flatpickr's focus events.\nYou can use the static option as a workaround.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/dqegyo1n/1/. Thanks for this insight @nicowiggersiv :+1: . Issue templates exist for a reason. You erased the pre-filled template just to write out seven paragraphs of your shitty little rant and didn't even provide a bug reproduction link.\nBugs happen. They're inevitable, but they're not deliberate. I prize substance over style, but it is inappropriate for you, as a consumer of free open source software, to demand things in such a manner.\nRegarding this focus issue you are having, yeah I will fix it. But next time this snark and entitlement will go straight into the trash.. Hello @aashish-chaubey \nformatDate() is pretty simple. Check this out https://jsfiddle.net/9Lq8bpn8/. Thanks!. @ollierob that's not really a problem with \"today\", if you used say new Date() it would also get stale the next day.\nI don't think this is a problem with flatpickr itself. If you need the calendar to always be up to date, you can do something like:\njs\nsetInterval(() => { fp.set(\"maxDate\", \"today\") }, 3.6e+6);. @ollierob there's a difference. \"today\" has 00:00:00 hours, while new Date() includes user's current date+time. \nHaving a datepicker stay open for days is not a common use case. If you need to always stay updated, you should take care to refresh it from the outside, which is trivial to do.\nBut thank you for the suggestion. :+1: . Just set allowInput: true. See also https://flatpickr.js.org/options/. Hello @ivos \nFrom your main.js, are you importing all the files in dist/l10n?\nBecause I saw this in the stack trace: ./node_modules/flatpickr/dist/l10n ^\\.\\/.*$\n. @divdax I'm guessing the names collided.\n.flatpickr-time is a class used by flatpickr internally for its time input elements. There is no reason to add this class to your input manually. Just use any other class that's not prefixed by flatpickr\n. Hey, thanks for reporting this @johndatserakis\nWill fix this asap. @safer-bwd Yes, this is correct behavior. \nBackspace or Delete on the input will clear it. The rationale is that if you start with an empty input and let the user pick a date, there should be a way to reset the date as well.\nIf you need a date to always be selected, you can use various ways of form validation.\nGlad you're enjoying flatpickr!. @memoht thanks for reporting this! Should be fixed by the next release. @denden4444 sorry for the late response.\nCheck if flatpickr works without jQuery.\njs\nflatpickr(document.querySelector(\"#onTime\"));. Hello,\nThis is now fixed on master and will be a part of the next release very soon.\nThank you all for patience :). @adrienpoly flatpickr tokens are not following a particular standard, and there's no existing converter between formats (none that I know of). But I figure writing a converter between formats should be very simple.. @scottybo  use either localize or \njs\nlocale: {\n     ...ru,\n    firstDayOfWeek: 1\n}. Hello,\nThere are no dependencies on jQuery. The if condition only checks if jQuery is installed and sets up a flatpickr plugin. This is more of an issue with laravel mix than flatpickr.\nI can't just comment it out because it will remove a functionality that jQuery users rely on. If you know a solution that will keep the functionality and your issue, please re-open and comment below. Otherwise, this is unactionable.. @DevGoslinga the same scrolling functionality is available from the scrollPlugin. You don't have to fall back to an old version.. @bs-thomas thanks for reporting this issue. The issue is now fixed - the disabled dates will get greyed out immediately. A new release will be out very soon.. @Webinsane I suggest checking the browser width and setting the showMonths option based on that. . @sowinski correct, this function doesn't consistently work on native mobile datepickers. There isn't a reliable way to open the native calendar - most work only by user input.. @youradds this might have to do with #1393.\nI'll get a new release out very soon.. @denta I can't do much with a screenshot - can't know whether its a css issue or some kind of a crash. A fiddle link would be helpful. @lconnolly \n\nAs one example, as an enhancement for accessibility, if you provide the name/ID of an input to the for= attribute of a  element, clicking the label immediately focuses the related field.\n\nThis might address your label/for issue. https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/blob/master/src/plugins/labelPlugin/labelPlugin.ts\n\nMy suggestion is simple: if an input has a name= or id= attribute, simply copy it to the cloned \"flatpickr\" input with an additional suffix.\n\nYou can do something like\nts\n{\n  onReady(){\n    if (this.altInput) {\n     this.input.name && this.altInput.name = this.input.name;\n     this.input.id ....\n  }\n}. Thanks @andrewlouie ! :+1: . Great work, thanks @IceCreamYou ! :+1:. @Azertyker please upgrade to the latest version before filing bug reports. . @aizerin defaultDate is only used on init. Use setDate to update selected date.\nhttps://flatpickr.js.org/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange-datestrformat. @patarapolw I guess that would be because of readonly. This is more of a CSS issue with Bootstrap, so I am closing this issue.. Thanks @andrewlouie. @br608 your defaultDate is incorrect -it has spaces in the string while the date format doesn't.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/c6exfwa5/1/. @lucasgdev investigating this. @biroplane Just recreate the flatpickr instance, with the plugin added or removed from plugins.. This is outside of this project's scope and maintaining such a locale database would be a significant undertaking.. @garygreen since flatpickr falls back to native pickers on mobile when possible, there is never a need to set these attributes on the html element directly. \nJust use minDate / maxDate and flatpickr will take care of the rest. @NitishKumarPatra enable also accepts functions, just return false from one to disable all dates. \nSee https://flatpickr.js.org/examples/#enabling-dates-by-a-function. @kodara https://flatpickr.js.org/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange-datestrformat. @projct1 I can't switch project's css preprocessor for every user on a whim. \nIf you need to customize something, you can use css/sass/whatever for every case except creating custom themes.. @pshurygin sounds like bad UX. I will tweak the default behavior.. @oxygen Yes, modifying prototypes is not the best idea. These will go away in v5.\nI will wait until a few more breaking changes are necessary until releasing a new semver major.\nIf this is a considerable performance bottleneck for your app right now, you can fork it in the meantime and remove the few offending lines.\n. Yes, it should be in a ~3 weeks. @niko5 try the { static: true } option.\nYou might not need z-index at all. @niko5 you mean pickers don't close after clicking outside?\nIf so, I would suggest using https://flatpickr.js.org/plugins/#confirmdate. @niko5 you're welcome. Glad you got it sorted. @silbinarywolf sorry for the delay. Will take a look within a day or so. thanks for the patience :). @kodara this is a bug related to chrome mobile not displaying placeholder when input type is date. flatpickr has nothing to do with it. @chhaymenghong will take a look today. thanks for the patience . Hey all, a release should he out within a few days. Thanks for the patience :). @8483 that's a fantastic idea for a plugin. Glad you're enjoying flatpickr . Thanks! :). Will look into it as soon as I can. Thank you for the patience :). Thanks for reporting @davideghz\nLooking into it. Hello @wajnberg and thanks for submitting this PR. I will review this as soon as I can, though it looks good on a quick glance. \nThanks for the patience :). @jwidderich thanks for reporting this, and hope you dont mind the late response. I will investigate this as soon as I can.\nIn case you know how to fix this issue immediately, please freel free to fire up a PR and I will take a look too. That would probably be faster than my investigation.. Hey, thanks for contributing! Sorry about the wait.. @ferronsw I understand it could be helpful in your situation, but generally speaking someone wouldn't expect an always-visible picker to fire 'close' and 'open' events, because it can be neither opened nor closed.. @ferronsw you can always make a plugin and distribute it on npm. Its very easy, look at https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/blob/master/src/plugins/labelPlugin/labelPlugin.ts for example.\nAlthough perhaps I should make plans for flatpickr/plugins someday. . Hey @scottybe \nThis is very similar to https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/issues/1546, and I will use that as a tracking issue. So what you want will be possible, probably in the next release :)\nThanks for sharing your ideas! If you have any more ideas on how to improve flatpickr, please open up another issue.. Hello @naterchrdsn \nYou can use the onDayCreate hook for this. See https://flatpickr.js.org/events/#ondaycreate\nYou receive each date object, the date element, and the flatpickr instance as an argument. All you have to do is implement some boolean logic.. @jipexu this really belongs somewhere like stack overflow, but in your enable function you can check if the date is the same as defaultDate and return true if it is.. @bh213 Yes. You should use the parseDate config option. See https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/blob/master/src/types/options.ts#L213\nIf you want to fallback on flatpickr's default parser in your own parser, you can just call flatpickr.parseDate(date, format). @sandeepbaikan this is an issue with polymer. flatpickr is distributed to millions of npm users without problems, and I use it myself in ES2015 module environments without problems.\nUnless you know of some solution I can apply to help you out, there isn't much I can do :(. @ozergul see https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/issues/1546#issuecomment-433785220\nI will use that issue to track progress.. @CJBrunton the docs are overwhelmingly clear https://flatpickr.js.org/getting-started/\nI can't stop other people from from publishing forks. For the sake of security and getting what you expect, just stick to the official package :). @padinko flatpickr doesn't support dynamically changing some variables like enableTime, showMonths, etc yet. For now, you can just re-create the flatpickr instance.. @Yamakasi Not sure I understand what you mean. You can format your date/time however you want. There should be enough date/time tokens to accommodate every need.. I can see the use case for updating the picker on blur if a new date was input. I will see what can be done to accomplish this, either via plugin or an option.. @antony no worries, I will fix up and test master myself anyway.. This seems to be already fixed on master @antony.\nNevertheless, really appreciate your contribution :+1: \nLooking forward to more in the future :). Thanks!. Fantastic work, @zackschuster. Thank you for the contribution.. @DeltaBravo glad you figured it out. I'm really unsure what this library could do to make things easier for you - all relevant elements and methods are already exposed in the flatpickr instance.. Do something like this:\nts\n  window.VARS.ViewOtherDateDatepicker = flatpickr(\"#embed-calendar-avail input.date\", {\n        minDate: \"today\",\n        inline: true,\n        dateFormat: \"d-m-Y\",\n        onReady() {\n           const dates = Array.prototype.map.call(fp.days.childNodes, d => d.dateObj);\n           const availableDays = someAjaxRequest(dates);\n           Array.prototype.forEach.call(fp.days.childNodes, dayElement => {\n             // do something with it, based on availability\n             // add \"disabled\" class to mark as disabled\n           });\n        }\n    });. @youradds the fp.daysContainer field contains all the month containers with days.\nI'll get you a quick snippet in a bit. @wyattoday what issue was that workaround for? . @Pearce-Ropion when you're using altInput, the manually input date is expected to follow altFormat, so that the display and input format are the same. . @Pearce-Ropton p.s. you can always use  https://flatpickr.js.org/instance-methods-properties-elements/#setdate-date-triggerchange-datestrformat to update the date via timestamp. Good work, thanks for the PR!. Thanks for contributing @lucasl2f :). @denden4444 when you have a Date object, you can use the getTime method to get the unix timestamp.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime. @viorelsfetea we can potentially go even further - there's a localization API in browsers that can be used as well. If we can use that everywhere - great, if not - your locale key idea sounds good too. I will investigate what the best way to go is.. @janwidmer have you tried using the static option?. @akashkoul stackoverflow may be a better place for questions like this. . Merged.. @petermonte great ideas. I will make this happen for the next release :). @bs85 this is nice but there's already a plugin that accomplishes this.\nSee https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/tree/master/src/plugins/confirmDate. Closing due to inactivity. Hey @bs85 and thanks for making this pull request :)\nThere is a far simpler way of doing what you want - take a look at https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/pull/1678. I will give you credits in the changelog. \nThanks again, and I look forward to your contributions in the future :+1: \n. @drdulitel youre gonna have to take care of any refreshes on your own. Just call .redraw() on the instance every X minutes. I can't have flatpickr to it itself as that would create many other problems for other users.. @dakahn \n\nthe keyboard command to give Flatpickr focus is unexpectedly the left or right arrow keys.\n\nAs opposed to? Which keys did you expect to navigate the calendar with? \n\nthe next month and previous month controls cannot be accessed with a keyboard at all.\n\nCtrl+LeftArrow and Ctrl+RightArrow\n@thiemeljiri Please open an issue with specific accessibility problems that you have encountered. I can't fix problems that are not reported. Regarding the input element being read-only - it makes sense for most cases. In cases it doesn't, the default options can be overridden.. @dakahn you definitely have some valid points. Could you break these up into separate issues, e.g. missing aria tags on certain parts or keyboard navigation. Then, hopefully with some of your input we can devise an accessible solution. Great stuff @dakahn. Let's track those two issues separately. This one has done its job.. @nitely you can use minDate and maxDate for this purpose - both dates can contain a time in which case time selection will be automatically limited.. @nitely then you can create an onChange hook check if fp.selectedDates.length === 1 or 2 and set the time accordingly.\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/tvrqwy7z/. @DM2489 Yes, I am going to get a release out within the next few days. Its taken a while as I need to allocate some time to test out all the changes merged and take another look at the code.. Update: v4.5.3 is out! :rocket: :rocket:\nI will be getting in touch with all of you shortly :). @SDJLee awesome. will get in touch within a few days :). @youradds if you have an idea of what we could do to fix this issue, please leave your thoughts here. While we can't justify efforts to investigate issues in unsupported browsers, we can push a fix if it's straightforward. @milanvogels please follow the issue template and provide a reproduction link so that I can address the issue. Hello,\nI would advise taking a deep look at the documentation, which likely will contain a way to achieve what you want. These sorts of questions best belong on websites like stack overflow as the flatpickr team does not have the time to investigate each question, check for duplicates, point you to the documentation, etc.\nAnd since this is neither a bug report nor exactly a feature request, I am closing the issue.\n. @petewulf this happens because dates are prepopulated using dateFormat. You can add a dateFormat option identical to altFormat and it will work. However, at that point you may as well not use altInput :)\nP.S. I personally always use dateFormat: \"Z\" - the ISO8601 date string - along with altInput for a more human display. \n. Use the jumpToDate instance method.\nhttps://flatpickr.js.org/instance-methods-properties-elements/#jumptodate-date. Thank you so much for reporting this so fast @adriaanvanrossum .\nLooks like a hickup in the build system.\nv4.5.4 is out right now to fix this issue.. Nice work @andrewlouie :). Thanks @adrianschmidt :). Great work @wyattoday . @rywall the problem is that getBoundingClientRect() is very slow. I will see if there are no negative performance implications before merging this. . Hello @asudoh \nHave you tried the allowInput option? It enables precisely what you're asking for. @asudoh there is already a request for this https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/issues/1271. I will be investigating a solution and maybe it will be ready in the coming release . You're welcome. Follow progress at https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/issues/1271. Hello @nitramL \nSeems to be working fine at https://codesandbox.io/s/n95y6vjy10\nIt may be an issue with your setup or https://github.com/ankurk91/vue-flatpickr-component\nIf you're not sure what you're doing wrong, you can try using flatpickr directly and see if that solves the issue. . Closing due to inactivity.\nFeel free to re-open the issue if necessary.. Hey @dlbone \nthis should definitely be possible, similar to how e.g. enable can take a function.. Nevermind - this is already possible. \n\nYou can configure a getTimeLimits function that takes in a date object and returns the time limits.. @derblub you're most welcome. Please open up an issue if you run into any problems . @Kuzcoo I can't reproduce this - please provide a reproduction link.. Hi, please copy and paste commands from https://flatpickr.js.org/getting-started/\nI believe you may have made some typos. Its npm i flatpickr.. This one's on me. Looks like something went wrong with pnpm. I will fix it on master soon and re-run the build. @jerry153fish this is expected behavior - how do you imagine multiple-mode time selection?\nI could suggest adding new time pickers for each time selection on user request.. The days reference will be likely incorrect in case there are multiple calendars.\nUse self.days instead\n. That's one way to solve this, but its far more trivial to simply check the hook value and do something like:\njs\nself.config[hooks[i] || []\nA whole function for this is unnecessary. :+1: . OK :+1: . This part is unclear to me.\ntriggerChange shouldn't prevent valueUpdate from getting triggered. @zerkalica While onChange may cause onValueUpdate, onValueUpdate and onChange are separate events. As long as you supply triggerChange=false to setDate(), there won't be recursion or other problems :+1: . @zerkalica I see. but why not just use onChange then instead of onValueUpdate?. @zerkalica yes, but there's onChange with triggerChangeEvent flag specifically for those scenarios.\nIts reasonable to expect that calling setDate would trigger onValueUpdate, and I hope even dummy programmers are familiar with the concept of recursion.\nApart from that, the rest of the PR looks good.. This belongs in a global .gitignore. No-go. This breaks opening animations for all browsers\n  . I haven't noticed any issues with svgs in IE. I'm guessing this fixes a case where they appear huge? How do I reproduce it?. @DanielRuf noted. This should be extracted out of the if condition and the else block should be removed.. This should go in your application's custom CSS.\nThe only thing here should be display: none. This is not very relevant.\nAs mentioned, should go in your custom CSS.. Please move this to utils/dom. The check is unnecessary. If a user decides to pass in null, let them handle the error instead of accommodating this unreasonable behavior.. This is awesome and something I've been meaning to do for a while. Great work!. The changes made to unit tests should be reverted. If they contain some sort of an error, lets open up a new issue and deal with it separately from this PR. . We could simply do self._input.focus(). ",
    "rafaelrenanpacheco": "Hi Gregory!\nThanks for the fast feedback.\nI tried this new defaultDate option on the sample page, and I think it is not working.\nThe doc says: \"Set the date to highlight on first opening if the associated input field is blank.

I did not download the master to test locally, because the demo page just don't work for that feature (http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/)\nAbout the demo page for this issue (http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/issue-4-demo/), it has wrong attr name. The code has \"data-defaultdate\", but the doc says it should be \"data-defaultDate\", which made the sample of this page not working. Also, the problem on the main demo page is regarding the JS command to set the defaultDate \"defDate.set('defaultDate', '2015-10-10')\". Using attr works just fine.\n. Now it is working :smile:\nThank you very much\n. That was incredible fast and amazing!\nThank you very much! No more bootstrap-datepicker =)\n:+1:\n. Thanks for the update :smile:\nNow it is working fine with flex boxing :+1: \nBest regards,\nRafael.\n. Amazing :smiley:\nThank you very much :+1: \n. Nice catch!\nFrom the JS source:\n```\n    getDaysinMonth = function(){\n    var yr = self.currentYear;\n\n    if (yr === 1 && ( !( (yr % 4) || (!(yr % 100) && (yr % 400))) ) )\n        return 29;\n\n```\nCould be this yr === 1 the issue?\n. cc @chmln \n. Which example did you use to reproduce the bug?\nI tried these steps in \"A basic datepicker\" sample, and it did not occur.\nAlso, did you test using a clean cache?\n. You can't attach video here, but I think a print of the issue, with both dates selected, is enough.\nI'm using the same version of Chrome as you, but on a Windows 7 atm.\nMaybe this bug is specific for osx\ncc @chmln for further investigation\n. Hi there!\nIt still does not work for other formats, like 'd/m/Y'.\nAfter investigating the problem, I saw that the selected date object is lost after the popup is closed and reopened, due the redraw() destroying everything and rebooting it again.\nI made it work by initializing flatpickr with the self.selectedDateObj, like:\njs\nself.redraw = function(){\n    flatpickr(self.element, self.config, self.selectedDateObj);\n}\njs\nvar flatpickr = function (selector, config, last_date) {\n    ...\n    element._flatpickr = new flatpickr.init(element, config, last_date);\n    ...\n}\njs\ninit = function () {\n    ...\n    if ( self.element.value || (!self.element.value && self.config.defaultDate ) ){\n        self.selectedDateObj = last_date||self.config.defaultDate;\n    }\n    ...\n}\nOf course this is just a workaround solution. I think you can get a better solution to this, maybe storing the last date in self.config itself? Since js lack support to create date from string using a format, it would be a lot easier to flatpickr to just store the selected date object itself.\n. Also, this new update breaks if the input is pre-loaded with a formated date, like this print:\n\nReverting back to 1.3 solves this problem. Another reason to store the selected date as date object, and not as string to parse it ;)\n. Hi @chmln!\nNow selecting a date, closing the popup and reopening it is working flawless! :+1:\nBut the problem with pre-loaded input date still occurs.\nFor example, if the input has a pre-defined value of 02/01/2015 (date format d/m/Y), flatpickr will try to guess the current date, and it will miss, setting the selected date to 02 as month and 01 as day.\nTo solve this, I tried to set the defaultDate option, but flatpickr priorizes the input value instead the defaultDate.\nWould be possible to, when defaultDate is set and input has value and selectedDate is not yet defined, then set selectedDate based on defaultDate option, since I can set the defaultDate option with a format that js can understand?\nThis should solve the issue.\nBest regards,\nRafael.\n. Working like a charm :smile: \nThank you very much!\n. Hi @SerbanC!\nThanks for the iOS bug report.\nIf you may, can you run this bug with the source version of flatpickr?\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js\nThis way the console can show the proper line with the problem.\nBest regards.\n. Hi there!\nIndeed it acts like a modal, but that was just a suggestion. Flatpickr working directly in the input works perfect as well.\nBut the problem when the input is at the far right of the screen still occur :(\nIt pushes the layout to render the calendar, but I think it should pull itself to the left in these situations.\n. Hi there!\nCompressing the calendar at the far right worked just fine.\nBut what about changing the absolute position when the calendar is at the far right?\nTo test this, I forced the calendar width to be 266px, and sent it to the far right again:\n\nI don't know how to detect via js if the calendar is at the far right, but if you can, changing the absolute position left to right can solve this.\nBest regards!\nRafael Pacheco.\n. Hey there!\nJust found in SO a code that identifies if the element in inside viewport. I changed it to change the css like I said above, and worked just fine. Here is the example code:\n``` js\n/ Check if the calendar is in viewport, and apply absolute changes to it /\nfunction isElementInViewport(el) {\n    / jQuery helper, goes away in vanila js /\n    if (typeof jQuery === \"function\" && el instanceof jQuery) {\n        el = el[0];\n    }\nvar rect = el.getBoundingClientRect();\n\nvar bottomOffset = (window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight) - rect.bottom;\nvar rightOffset = (window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth) - rect.right;\n\nif (bottomOffset < 0) {\n    /* jQuery example, need to change to vanila js */\n    /* Would be better pre-defined classes to achieve this */\n    $(el).css(\"bottom\", \"100%\");\n    $(el).css(\"top\", \"initial\");\n    $(el).css(\"margin-bottom\", \"3px\");\n}\n\nif (rightOffset < 0) {\n    /* same logic, disabling left and enabling right */\n}\n\n/* if bottom or right are positive, reset to original configuration */\n\n}\n```\nThis is just an idea of how to solve this problem, a few works needs to be done in it:\n1: change it to 100% pure js, no jQuery.\n2: run it for every calendar popup open.\n3: create helper classes to achieve the desired position, instead of setting the style direct on the element.\n4: fix the calendar width to 266px, and disable width compressing.\nTo test this code, I sent the calendar to the bottom of my page, which caused the same problem, pushed my layout further. Then I run the above command on the calendar element, and it returned negative bottomOffset when the calendar popup didn't fit the viewport, and 0 or positive when it did.\nHope it helps :+1: \n. Hi there!\nStill the same problem, page layout is still being pushed further.\nBut now the calendar popup doesn't follow window resizes. It stays fixed in it's original position. This could be a problem in mobile, when changing from vertical to horizontal layout.\n. I think if time picker had a different background color, it would be easier to find it out.\n. Thanks!\nIndeed SASS seems more popular.\nBest regards.\n. It was changed to http://stylus-lang.com/ :disappointed: \n. Hi there!\nThanks for the feedback, indeed manual input is faster in some situations. In these situations, I'll disable the popup and stick with just a date mask.\nBest regards.\n. Wow, didn't see that in the docs, so I didn't even tried it, sorry about that xP\nWorking perfectly when using DOM directly.\nThanks!\n. I think it is already there, look: http://bower.io/search/?q=flatpickr\n. Wow, nice catch =)\nI didn't notice that was the group that should be initialized.\nWorking fine as expected :smile:\nThank you very much.\n. Hi @jakkor \nThe proper (common) way to achieve this is by clicking on the year itself, and then loading a grid of years to select. Usually you would find you year in that grid. If you don't, then navigate the grid using \"<\" and \">\" as usual.\nThis does not yet exists in flatpickr, and would be a nice feature. Fast month/year navigation is a must on this kind of component, because most of its competitors does have these features.\n. The only way I found was the contact form :smile: \nhttp://www.vanillalist.com/contact\n. @chmln look:\nhttp://www.vanillalist.com/?Search=Date+Picker\n:+1: \n. Which one? They are working here in anonymous mode (no cache)\n. Looks like Safari and mobile don't like 'let' declarations:\nhttps://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#let_basic_support_(strict_mode)\n@chmln wouldn't be better to transform these declarations to var, using babel os something like that?\n. Actually the problem is the demo site using src/flatpickr.js, which does not have transformations.\nThe minified js in dist/flatpickr.min.js would work just fine in this situation, because it does not have \"let\" declarations due babel.\n/cc @chmln \n. Hi there!\nYes, but would be possible to add a fixed margin left to compensate the arrows?\nI'll try this fix in my project later, thanks :+1: \n. Hi!\ncss\n.flatpickr-current-month {\n    margin-left: 21px;\n}\nDid the trick, but I don't know if this can be the final solution... still have to test in different displays.\nHere is the result:\n\nThanks!\n. > or should I handle my yyyymmdd date via php beforehand to match your supported format\nYes, that's how I do in my project. Default javascript date parser is not that flexible to initialize date in different formats. So, it's easier to just format it in php before writing it into the html, with the yyyy-mm-dd format.\n:+1: \n. Are you sure it is empty? You get NaN when you start with an invalid date format that js was unable to parse.\n. Wow!\n. You can achieve that using 2 flatpickr inputs, and disabling the start/ending dates via js:\nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#disable\n. These up/down buttons are really a problem.\n@chmln would be possible to change to something like http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/date-picker does? When the user click the year, the calendar changes to year selection, like this:\n\nThis would solve the layout issue regarding centering the year in the popup.\n. @chmln look at this solution: http://vuikit.github.io/vuikit/#!/calendar\nWhen the user clicks the year or month components, a default <select> is displayed to enable a fast year / month selection.\nSince <select> works well anywhere, what do you think about this solution?\nEdit: Actually, here is a better example: http://vuikit.github.io/vuikit/#!/datepicker\n. As requested in #96?\n. I never saw a plugin with just time range. You can achieve that using 2 flatpickr inputs, 1 for datetime, and 1 for time only.\nOr 3 flatpickr inputs, 1 for date, 2 for time range.\nDo you know a plugin which have time range?\n. Airbnb is largely used, I vote for this one.\n. Already said in #22 \n. The safer way is Y-m-d mask, because d-m-Y will causes ambiguity between earlier days and months. For example, you want 02/01/2010 to be January 2nd, but JS will parse as February 1st. Using Y-m-d, 2010-01-02 will always be January 2nd.\n. Already said in #103 \n. Yes, look at the documentation: https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/#strap\n. The change event can be set in your target element, the one in '...' in your snippet. When you select a date in flatpickr, flatpickr will change the target input with the selected date, which will fire the change event on that element.\nOr do you need another kind of change? Maybe when changing the calendar month?\n. ",

This is normal, due to how flatpickr positions the date pickers by default.\nIf you want to use with modals you need to use the static option.\nHere is an example http://jsfiddle.net/x4q4ym42/1/. This can be closed, currently flatpickr does not have native support for time ranges.. I think with iOS you have to look at binding to touchstart or similar\n. calendarContainer is setup in build(), which is skipped if self.isMobile is true\n. Here is what I believe we are going to use for a hotfix.\nThis should handle destroying both the mobile input and the container, depending on if mobile or not.\nif (!instance.isMobile && instance.calendarContainer.parentNode){\n    instance.calendarContainer.parentNode.removeChild(instance.calendarContainer);\n} else if(instance.isMobile && instance.mobileInput.parentNode) {\n    instance.mobileInput.parentNode.removeChild(instance.mobileInput);\n}\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/flatpickr.js#L635\n. Thanks @chmln \n. Flatpickr uses the flexbox display model, which is supported by all modern browsers.\nhttp://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox\nGood news is that includes IE 10 and up. Bad news is it does not include IE9 - but let's face it IE 9 is pretty old (5 years to be exact).\nIt's an easy tweak with CSS. Ideally you'd use modernizer or similar so that this is only applied with users that don't have flexbox support.\n.flatpickr-day {\ndisplay: inline-block !important;\n}\n. Looking good. \nMy 2 cents:\nI think the checkbox should always be on its own line, for date ranges and when using the time picker.\nBasically how it was mocked up in https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/413#issuecomment-261211717\nMy main thoughts behind this is\n- Check is more prominent\n- Check will be consistent in placement regarding the date picker configuration, which IMO is important. This way if you have multiple date pickers used on your site in different ways, the check is always in the same place and won't \"move around\" for the user.\n- Check could support text via checkText option. For example, if I was implementing this for my users, I'd like to change it to \"\u2714\ufe0f  Done\", to further guide the users.\nPlacing it on the bottom in all use cases will address all these :)\n. @mgibbs189 I agree.\nIn my opinion, what makes the most sense is:\n- Only displaying date picker does not display check area, because selecting a date closes the date picker\n- Enabling the time picker causes the check area to display\n- Enabling date range causes the check area to do display\n- showCheck property available to override behavior mentioned above. @chmln I definitely understand now wanting to change default behavior/design, and if that's the case then perhaps having the check area default to off in all scenarios?\nIMO the check area is most helpful when the date picker supports multiple actions and don't automatically close on selection (time enabled or date ranges).\n. I fired up my VM and confirmed this in IE11.\nIt's an \"overflow\" bug, that affects max-width when using flex (from what I've read).\nAdding width: 100%; to .flatpickr-rContainer appears to resolve the issue.\nAlternately removing display: flex from .flatpickr-InnerContainer so that it's block seems to do it, but I belive the former is the actual fix core will want to include.\n. Any thoughts on this @chmln ?. Yeah, that was my guess too. I don't know if there is anything we can do about that (preserving the prop during DOM manipulation)?\nBut I suppose at the very least when (re)initialized we can check if there is anything left behind, and if so, remove it.. As far as I can tell that did the trick \ud83c\udf7b \nif I discover otherwise I'll reopen. Currently I don't believe this is possible. Almost this exact idea has been suggested, so this is a duplicate issue \ud83d\ude00\nSee #413. You're right, what I was referring to was this was one of the mockups presented that was designed off of the bootstrap datepicker you linked.\nhttps://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/413#issuecomment-261211717 \nBut I do agree, I really like the arrows displayed in that mockup.. Appears to be via Flatpickr.l10ns.default.firstDayOfWeek = 1;\nFrom the demo JS https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/assets/js/site.js. Confirmed. In iOS datetime mobile input is date.\nLooks like that is coming from https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/flatpickr.js#L1409\n\n. The demo is still using 2.2.2.\nIE issues were resolved in 2.2.3 - see #414 \n. You can do that with CSS the 'cursor` CSS property.\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.asp. This is the issue described in #450.. A normal date picker will close after picking the date, unless\n\ntime picker is configured\ndate range is configured\n\nYou have time picker enabled, which is why it is not closing.\nThis is intentional, because if you're including a time picker the assumption is after the user picks a date they also need to pick a time (or vice versa because you have know way of knowing what the user will select first).. The fix is to add overflow: hidden to .flatpickr-calendar.\nCurrently the wrapper .flatpickr-calendar has max-height: 0 configured, however since there is no overflow property assigned, the contents overflow out of the element and give it a height.\nShould be an easy bugfix for @chmln . Duplicate, see #450 . Hmm, it seems to be something with your code or a conflict else where.\nI made a fiddle of the exact code provided and it works as expected.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/hhy2apmp/2/\nedit: also +1 to having something similar in the docs @chmln . I understand your frustration, but it's not fair to say \"its not working\" when you have not provided any additional details to assist with debugging and the fiddle provided above (https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/455#issuecomment-266464828) works correctly using the exact code you say does not work.\nWe can't help when you just say its \"not working\".. @getup8 very interesting, thanks for the clarification. Sounds like a good reasons to get this in the docs :). Link?. Can you provide the link to where this can be viewed?. Ah ok, for some reason from my previous testing I thought it accommodated that already.. This is the normal and default behavior.\nMobile devices will show a mobile date input, if supported.\nTo always use flatpickr use disableMobile: true. @billmn correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the gist of things is he initiating all the date pickers on the page, then afterwards was to go modify the properties on certain ones without resetting what was originally set.\nLet's say instead of change, it was\nflatpickr('input[name=date_start]', {\n   disableMobile: true\n});\nFrom my understanding, this will destroy the previous instance, which is why the other properties are lost?. Works fine for me.\nYou left out all the environment details which would have helpful.... \ud83d\ude06. Do you have a link or a fiddle?\nSure looks like a zindex issue \ud83d\ude09 .

    "rwwagner90": "I wouldn't mind helping out with ES2015 updates, if you'd like me to.\n. Actually, defaultDate seems to be what I would want for a predefined date, and it says in the docs anything that works with Date.parse should work, which \"2016-12-27T16:16:22.585Z\" does work with Date.parse, but setting defaultDate to \"2016-12-27T16:16:22.585Z\" does not work with flatpickr.\n. @chmln I think a simple solution here, is to remove the replacing of dashes with slashes you are doing, and only allow strings that work with Date.parse in both Firefox and Chrome. What do you think?\n. Ah nice, thanks! Would you be interested in some help converting this into an ES2015 class? I'd be glad to help out with that effort, and I think we should write some tests as well.\n. I just think it would be much easier to follow the code if it were a class with methods, but it's really no benefit, just syntactic sugar.\nI think tests first would be a good idea, then we can revisit possible refactors after we have tests to make sure nothing breaks \ud83d\ude04 .\nLet me know where I can help out!\n. I think just using two inputs works great, personally.\n. @chmln did you decide to implement a side by side two calendar range view like this?\n. Thanks for the quick fix @chmln! Looking forward to the next release, so I can update \ud83d\ude04 \n. @chmln I know you must be busy, especially with the popularity of this blowing up, but if you could release a patch version soon, that would be awesome \ud83d\ude04 \n. False alarm\n. False alarm\n. @davidklebanoff I am setting it in JS. I am just doing .set on the flatpickr reference. It worked before updating to 2.0.0. https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-flatpickr/blob/master/addon/components/ember-flatpickr.js#L36\nI looked at the code throwing the error in flatpickr and it is here: https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js#L1049\nIt is doing self.config.minDate.getFullYear() but since I am passing a string to minDate, it doesn't work. It works if you pass a Date, but it should accept a string, as per the docs.\n. @chmln do you have an ETA on the next release? I'm updating ember-flatpickr, and want to try to stay only on official releases.\n. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d \n. Since it appears multiple dates can now be chosen, I assume this array change was intentional, so I will close.\n. @chmln each release still has an issue with getFullYear, the location of the error just moves with each fix. Now I get this: TypeError: jumpDate.getFullYear is not a function\n. Could we do something across the whole codebase that ensures everything is converted to an actual date, so these things all work?\n. Thanks @chmln. Looking forward to a release where all my ember-flatpickr tests pass and I can release a new version \ud83d\ude04 . Should we port some of the tests over to here? Seems like these issues would have never happened in the first place, if the same tests were in place here.\n. @chmln I just updated to 2.0.4 and I still get TypeError: jumpDate.getFullYear is not a function\n. @ecoreng semver issues aside, I think the array is okay. I had this same issue, but when I realized it's just always an array now, it's trivial to just grab the first element in the array.\n. This seems to be fixed with 2.0.4\n. @chmln I tried using master, and the invalid date warning is gone, but my tests still fail and all the days are still .disabled. Additionally, I now have another failing test. You can see my test that used to pass pre-2.0 here https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-flatpickr/blob/master/tests/integration/components/ember-flatpickr-test.js#L93\n. @chmln if you wouldn't mind taking a look at my use case and helping to resolve this, that would be awesome! I would love to have ember-flatpickr on the latest, but I cannot until all the tests pass again.\n. @chmln this fixed the invalid date issue, but I am still seeing every day as disabled in my test \ud83d\ude1e \n. @chmln any ideas on why everything is still disabled? I would definitely recommend adding these tests to flatpickr to gain visibility into what is happening.\n. @chmln bump\n. @chmln it's still broken. Not to mention there are even more failures now. We really really really really need to add my tests to your test suite or we are never going to be able to release an ember-flatpickr that support 2.0+ \ud83d\ude1e \n. @chmln it also seems that defaultDate is now broken and/or maxDate and minDate are broken, as it does not switch to the correct month when set. It stays on October, instead of switching to December, like it is supposed to. Can you please look at my tests again? I can help add them to your test suite potentially. This is getting completely demoralizing.\n. @andreiucm that's not the behavior I am seeing, I don't think. It just does not switch months for me. Once my test cases pass, it should probably fix your issues too though.\n. @andreiucm are you pointing to the latest version? I do not have any problems setting defaultDate to a string like that.\n. @andreiucm flatpickr is supposed to work with anything that is valid for Date.parse. Try passing your date string into Date.parse and see if it works there.\n@chmln I see you have had a few commits regarding this issue. How goes the process of adding in some of the tests and getting things resolved?\n. @chmln the only remaining issue seems to be when I do:\njs\nthis.set('maxDate', '2016-12-25T16:16:22.585Z');\nthis.set('minDate', '2016-12-24T16:16:22.585Z');\nAnd then open up the flatpickr instance, it does not move me to where the active dates are anymore. It stays in November and everything is disabled.\n. Just kidding, I did a nombom and everything passes now. Thanks for your help addressing these issues @chmln!\n. I just saw there was another issue asking about destroy. We should probably document destroy somewhere. What do you think @chmln?\n. Fixed with 2.2.7, thanks!. This seems to have been changed from previous versions https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/v2.3.2/src/flatpickr.js#L1259\nI would argue that we should set the behavior back to the old way.\nWhy would we want an onChange fired when you set the initial value? Should only be when actually changed.. @chmln I would agree! Should I create an issue for it, or is tracking via this PR okay? Can probably close this PR, if we are going to set it back to the old way. No need to update the docs in that case.. Thanks @chmln! Looking forward to the next release, so I can close out all the ember-flatpickr issues we encountered from this \ud83d\ude04 . @chmln any chance we could get a release to patch this?. @chmln this is still an issue. Could we not have altInput copy over the disabled state of the normal input?. @chmln any insights on this?. @chmln thanks for getting back with me. It appears you are correct, so something much be wrong with my code \ud83d\ude1e . @ankurk91 no, I am the maintainer of ember-flatpickr. I am asking how to use them inside ember-flatpickr correctly.. @chmln well I currently do some weird stuff to support both. Suppose it is okay, but was looking for guidance on if I am doing it correctly or not.. Ah thanks, all green now!. @Techn1x @andrewlouie since that PR is merged, is this fixed and working?. @andrewlouie okay, it was an intentional change then? Wouldn't this be the beginning of the sentence since it's just one word displayed on a calendar?. Seems like the guy who opened the PR knew what he was talking about, so I'll close this.

Otherwise, JS errors could prevent other things from happening on the page such as calendar appearing when clicking in the input.\nAdditionally, I believe there's nothing in the code that prevents users from typing dates into the input using whatever format they feel like (which they assuredly will do). Without any ability to process those dates, or at least catch the error provided by Date.parse you're going to run into problems.\n. Right on. Thanks again for the calendar. Beats having to write one myself, and it's a nice replacement for the old DynArch calendar I was using in projects dating back to 2005 or so.\n. ",

    "mgibbs189": "@chmln @ptdev Excellent suggestion... can't wait to see this implemented!\n. @chmln Ah, thanks... I see it now (using a trackpad instead of a mouse).\nThis is the one thing keeping me from switching from Bootstrap Datepicker... making this a little more intuitive for users :)\n. @chmln P.S. 1.8.5 looks great! Thanks for addressing so quickly! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Nevermind, I was using the website for testing, which looks to be using an older version\n. I'd strongly recommend against bundling languages into the core codebase.\nIf your goal is to keep this thing lightweight, then it would be overkill. And with HTTP/2, the added time for an additional file request is negligable.\n. Also, if we need additional translations in the future, we could grab them from similar projects: https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/tree/master/js/locales\n. Awesome, thank you @chmln! Which commit was this part of (out of curiosity)?\n. @chmln do you also think that HTML <select> boxes should stay open after selection?\nYour assumption is that users will, more often than not, make mistakes when selecting a date. I disagree. Requiring an extra click to close seems unnecessary.\nI'm using a single flatpickr instance to handle multiple date fields. I haven't figured out a workaround yet, partly because the instance isn't passed into the onChange method. Any ideas how to restore the old functionality? E.g.\njavascript\n// doesn't work, since there's no FPOBJ\nflatpickr('.date-fields', {\n  onChange: function(rawdate, altdate, FPOBJ) {\n    FPOBJ.close();\n  }\n});\n. Thanks @chmln much appreciated! \ud83c\udf89 \n. @chmln yeah, I know that it's possible to create a custom HTML Close element.\nI'm just saying that the ability to clear a selection is a common use-case, and IMO it should be part of the actual popup / input (versus requiring creating a separate HTML icon/button/link).\n. @chmln what are your thoughts on adding a clearBtn (boolean) setting: if true, it appends an X icon to the input if not empty?\n\nNative HTML5 date fields provide a similar ability (to clear selections).\n. Oh, I see the issue.\nIn my case, the date inputs are getting destroyed / rebuilt on each ajax refresh.\nI suppose I'll just need to grab the values and manually destroy each datepicker on ajax trigger?\n. Awesome, thank you!\n. @chmln I think there's a better way to do this than c939ad7\nE.g. keep the version info only in src/flatpickr.js, then use gulp to prepend it to the beginning of dist/flatpickr.js and dist/flatpickr.min.js\nI'm not super familiar with gulp, but does that make sense?\n. One solution is to change:\njs\n.pipe(uglify({compress: {hoist_funs: false, hoist_vars: false}}))\nto:\njs\n.pipe(uglify({compress: {hoist_funs: false, hoist_vars: false}, preserveComments: 'license'}))\nthen change the comment at the top of src/flatpickr.js from:\njs\n/*! flatpickr v2.0 */\nto: \njs\n/*! flatpickr v2.0, @license MIT */\n. @bluppfisk Not sure if this is worth its own setting.\n1. Hide the year in the modal box with CSS\n2. Change the dateFormat option to exclude year from the save date\n3. Use altFormat to adjust the display date, e.g.\njs\n'dateFormat': 'm-d',\n'altInput': true,\n'altFormat': 'm-d'\n. @ptdev which version?:\n- gh-pages latest\n- 2.0 latest\n- 1.9.1 tag\n. I couldn't imagine this exact feature getting added to flatpickr, but perhaps it'd make sense for flatpickr to add  a method to calculate your own week logic...\n. @dalpras is this using the latest flatpickr (2.0-rc5)?\n. I think the rationale is that it keeps the flatpickr height consistent by forcing 6 rows.\nThis makes it easier to navigate through months, especially if the picker appears above the input box.\n. UPDATE: I modified onReady to use instance.calendarContainer. Seems a bit more solid now\njs\nonReady: function(dateObj, dateStr, instance) {\n    var $cal = $(instance.calendarContainer);\n    if ($cal.find('.flatpickr-clear').length < 1) {\n        $cal.append('<div class=\"flatpickr-clear\">Clear</div>');\n        $cal.find('.flatpickr-clear').on('click', function() {\n            instance.clear();\n            instance.close();\n        });\n    }\n}\n. js\nvar $input = $(instance.calendarContainer).find('.flatpickr-input');\n. You'll likely need to wrap your own custom JS via flatpickr's onReady handler.\n. Close... duplicate of #246\n. @tjvr this is a known issue: https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/pull/204\n. See the doc page https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/\n. Likely related to #275 \n. @BastiKlein did you mean to close this ticket?\n. @BastiKlein if the issue still exists in the latest code (gh-pages branch), then it's valid.\nE.g. https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/gh-pages/src/flatpickr.js\n. OK, then you should probably re-open this issue.\n. @rengelking Could you put together a pull request? It would probably expedite things -- sounds like the flatpickr author has been pretty busy w/ client work.\n. Looks like author fixed this a few hours ago via d0e3218\n. Can't we just have a single position option with the choices of \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"auto\"?\n. @jaredatch @apolzon either of you able to submit the PR?\n. If you want help, you need to provide the necessary details: \nYour Environment\n- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in \n\nVersion used:\nBrowser Name and version:\nOperating System and version (desktop or mobile):\nLink to your project:\n. Perfect, thanks @chmln !\n. See this example: https://jsfiddle.net/wxLb6m4n/\n\nTry doing the following scenarios:\n1. Select November 18th 8:00 to November 18th 12:30\n2. Select November 18th 8:00 to November 20th 12:30, THEN try changing the start time from 8:00 to 9:00 without modifying the end date\n. Load the language file from dist/l10n, then set the locale config option:\njs\nflatpickr(\".flatpickr\", {\n    locale: 'ru'\n});\n. It does exist since a few days ago. Download the latest master and look at the dist/l10n folder.\n. See #406, using locale will likely also set the correct first day of week.\n. @x09326 I'm not the author, but there are differences between dist/l10n and src/l10n.\nThe differences are very minor, but the dist translations have been compiled (babel) to support older browsers.\n. @x09326 For that, let's wait for confirmation from @chmln \n. @PeterDaveHello it's not strange, it makes perfect sense. Example:\nsrc: Flatpickr.l10ns.cat.ordinal = (nth) => {\ndist: Flatpickr.l10ns.cat.ordinal = function (nth) {\nThe src files are written using bleeding-edge javascript, whereas the dist files are compiled to support older browsers.\n. @neokio @chmln what about a \"slide\" between the date and time?\nSee http://codepen.io/creotip/pen/mPqaGv\nNotice how when you click an arrow, it slides to the right.\nI'm thinking that when a user selects a date, the UI would \"slide\" to show the time selector (along with a back button above it). Then we could add the checkmark button without it taking up too much vertical space.... @chmln @jaredatch @neokio Removing the checkbox when enableTime: true seems inconsistent.\nI'd argue that time is when the checkbox is MOST useful...\nWhat about like a showConfirm (boolean) option to toggle the checkbox?. @jaredatch Yep, let me know if this sounds right:\nenableCheckmark should ALWAYS take precedence. If it's undefined, then by default show the checkmark if:\n\nenableTime: true OR\nmode: range OR\nmode: multiple. @chmln Can't wait to see what you come up with. Thanks for the PR. The more I think about it, I don't think position should even be an option.\n\nIMO the position should remain automatic... with better support for mobile. The underlying issue here (datepicker partially hidden on mobile) sounds like a bug.\n. Just curious, how is this better than the formatDate option already in flatpickr?. It looks like this PR was an accident.\n@spameur please create an Issue, not a Pull Request, for any project questions.. My guess is \"no\", at least not with flatpickr alone. You'll likely need a separate input element to handle your multiple times... like a <select multiple=\"multiple\">.\nUse a flatpickr onChange event to render a time picker element when a date is selected.... @chmln if it helps, this issue started appearing in 2.2.5 (2.2.4 worked fine).. This issue applies to single digits (1-9). 10AM works fine.\nSo the regex to validate time must not be accounting for single-digit hours.. Ah, ok.. Possible duplicate of #642 . See #229 . ",

But there are scenarios where one might want the datepicker to remain open, one example being if you're using the confirmDate plugin to confirm selections.. @artem-ovcharenko-codilime, I'm just sticking on an older version that worked (sortof) - v2.4.2\nOne just needs to patch the confirmDate plugin with the following:\nhttps://github.com/webdevan/flatpickr/commit/d0908a4f862cf79e0b5f6c15bfcc13899b20448d\nDefinately not ideal, but I can't update until this issue is resolved. I think I'm going to open a new issue for this because IMO the close on select should be configurable either as a config setting or a hook of some sort that plugins (like confirmDate) can access.. Go for it, or would you like me to submit a new PR? You know your code better than I do ;). cool, done (hopefully correctly). I want to re-open this issue because my original PR might have been the better option.\nCurrently the whole plugin is disabled on mobile (native), but what happens if you have a mix of calendars and native inputs on the same page? Eg, you have a date-range picker and a normal date picker - only the normal date picker turns into a native input yet the confirm button will be missing from the date-range picker.\nMy original fix allowed for flatpickr calendars to keep the confirm button while not throwing JS errors for native inputs.. I'm going to make a new PR. ",
    "eddowh": "Thanks for the speedy response.\nI don't agree that manual input clashes with the purpose of the date picker where you do so without typing them out - it's not exactly one or the other!

    "IsenrichO": "I agree with @eddowh . While manual date/time input seems counterintuitive, there is value in having this available.

    "apolzon": "This is slightly unrelated, but may be contributing to the confusion by @hckrmoon - I ran into some issues where the onChange callback was not called on every change if the user a.) entered a time manually or b.) rapidly clicked the time interface buttons. In my scenario, I was able to get around the issue by using the onClose callback instead of onChange. @hckrmoon I would suggest logging something in your onChange callback and see if this is what is happening to you or not.\n. I'd second this. Main place I notice it is when the picker first opens, the default time is 12:00PM, would make sense to be able to click up by 1 on the hour interface to get to 1pm.\n. Correct - the mobile equivalent to build() is setupMobile(), which assigns self.mobileInput instead of self.calendarContainer.

Hey!\nYou're asking the right questions. And your less-is-more approach to UI is sound. Here's the style variant I chose, and my thinking for it:\n\n- The next/prev month arrows are now blue and bolder.\n- The time numbers were too small, almost going unnoticed. I enlarged them to 18px, the same size as the month and year. Could benefit from being even bigger. Also expanded the time area vertically.\n- I found the time difficult to read at a glance. Bringing it closer together helped.\n- The up/down arrows next to the numbers were small to the point of being useless. Having a larger click-area makes them more usable, especially for mobile. The blue up/down arrows indicate action.\n- The AM/PM text is blue, indicating it can be clicked to toggle.\n- The checkmark is better than \"OK\". No distraction or reading required, no translation required. If you find the big blue button at the bottom too disruptive, it could be a white button with a blue checkmark. But given the hunt-and-peck obstacle a date/time interface represents, I find the finality of clicking that blue button quite satisfying.\n. I'd suggest always displayed, so the moment the interface appears, the user is immediately clear on what is expected of them.\nThe checkmark and the arrows above are from Font Awesome, which I tend to use wherever possible, but obviously that's too large a dependency for just a few icons. Using Glyphter, here are those 5 icons mapped to the letters ABCDE ...\nFlatpickr-font.zip\n. The author doesn't like the OK bar. It adds 10% to the height, which I consider acceptable for the 100% \"next step\" certainty it gives the user. Hiding the time input just further ambiguates both progression and expectation, moving even further away from what I consider good UI. But this is his creation, and undoubtedly others will appreciate his approach.. I like this one! I suggest making it ubiquitous, and adding a showCheck config option (default to true), which, when set to false, provides the current excellent behavior on the calendar-only interface (closing when day is clicked).. @chmln Looking forward to seeing what you choose to do!. I've noticed this as well (if I understand correctly). And it's not just angular.\nHere's a fiddle to demonstrate.\nThis works fine ...\njavascript\n    var options = {\n        onOpen  : function(){ console.log('opened'); }\n        onClose : function(){ console.log('closed'); }\n    };\n    var date = $('#date').flatpickr(options);\n... but this does not ...\njavascript\n    var options = {\n        onClose    : function(){ console.log('closed'); }\n    };\n    var date = $('#date').flatpickr(options);\n    date.set('onOpen', function(){\n        console.log('opened');\n    });.

This also solves the issue where the default date (data-default-date or <input value=...>) was required to be in the default format (e.g. iso8601), i.e. different from the configured date-format.\nWe convert Java Date format (server) to flatpickr format \u00e1nd moment-js format. Working with date/time formats and time-zones.. not my favourite kind of thing ;)\n. Any idea on when \"update-on-focus-out\" will be added?\nRight now I added this workaround in our app (with jQuery available):\njavascript\n$('input.flatpickr:not([id])').focusout(function() {\n    this.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {\n        'keyCode': 13\n    }));\n});.

    "md5": "@mgibbs189 that's exactly what we would want, along with some sort of hook for formatting the month label to be something like \u201cOctober FY2017\u201d instead of \u201cOctober 2016\u201d\n. @chmln This gets us part of the way to supporting a 4-4-5 accounting year, but the other part we need is the ability to shift which days are considered part of the fiscal month. In particular, in a 4-4-5 accounting year, it's common for a few days at the beginning or end of the month to fall into the previous or next fiscal month respectively. For example, my company's \"June FY2016\" goes from May 29, 2016 to July 2, 2016.\nIt looks like the l10n.daysInMonth property and the utils.getDaysinMonth function could be helpful, daysInMonth assumes that there is the same number of days in each month, regardless of the year and getDaysinMonth always tries to make February have 29 days in a leap year. In a 4-4-5 accounting calendar, every month always has a multiple of 7 days in it.\nThe other thing we would need control over is the \"Month Year\" display. For example, instead of showing \"October 2016\", we would need to show \"October FY2017\" for the fiscal month that roughly corresponds to the October 2016 calendar month.\n. Also, I noticed that on a mobile device, the native date picker is still used. This is a show-stopper for us as well, since we need to use fiscal calendars consistently across all devices for the relevant applications.\n. Before I open a new issue, I thought I'd comment here that data-* properties are not working for me in desktop Safari 10.0.1 with Flatpickr 2.2.4.\nThe issue appears to be that Object.assign is not copying the properties from self.element.dataset. Here's a screenshot from the Safari console showing what I'm seeing:\n\nI would expect the output of _extends/Object.assign to include enableTime, altInput, and altInputClass properties in this case.. @chmln Any thoughts on this?. @tonymoxtra mentioned in his comment that the demo doesn't work fully in Safari. Since the original report was for iOS Safari, I think he may actually mean desktop Safari.\nI believe this is something I have run across as well. Specifically, it is not possible to configure Flatpickr using data-* attributes in Safari 10.0.1. I mentioned this in https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/339#issuecomment-266887225, but I thought I'd mention it here too.\nIf you look at the demo page in Safari, notice that the \"Display a human-readable date\" example does not work:\n\nAs far as I can tell, the reason is that Object.assign in Safari does not work when using element.dataset as a source object. I'm assuming this is because it's a DOMStringMap and this doesn't work with Safari's implementation of Object.assign.. @chmln I'm still seeing some inconsistencies in the behavior of Safari. For example, on the #example-datetime demo, I'm not actually seeing the time picker show up. The weird thing is that the config seems to be getting parsed correctly:\n\nI'm not sure whether I'll have time today to debug this, but perhaps someone else on the thread can take a look and dig into it.. @chmln This appears to be working in Safari now on the current demo site (although I did find some other breakage related to #510 that I mentioned in a comment there).. Looks like this breaks Safari. I'm seeing this error in the console on the demo site:\n\nTypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'e.path.indexOf'). Looks like Event.path is only supported in Chrome: http://stackoverflow.com/a/39245638. @rorc This regression was introduced in #510.

Hi @JamesJGoodwin ,\nIf this is still relevant with versions > 4.5, I'd like to investigate it. If you have the time, I'd like to please ask you if you could prepare an example of this happening. You can do it in HTML or by forking this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/tj2Lo4z7/. Closing as feature is implemented and documented. Could not replicate using flatpickr 4.5.7 on FF 65. I'm assuming the problem has been fixed. Please reopoen if that is not the case, including a JSFiddle reproduction.\nThank you!. Problem seems to be resolved with the latest version (4.5.7):\n\nSo, closing this. Please reopen if there are still problems, including a repro link.. Thank you @germania-kg and @softbeehive for the solution!. This seems to have been fixed in the meantime, i.e. if I change the version for flatpickr from 4.1.4 to 4.5.7, everything is rendered correctly once again. Closing the issue. Hi, any idea when this will be released?. Hi @riya-naico,\nWe would need more information about this, including a link to replicate, otherwise, we can't fix the problem. Just checked this and in the latest version, years can have 3 digits (but not 2, minimum year is 100). Closing this issue as solved. For the initial problem, there's a plugin that adds a button to confirm - see the first plugin here: https://flatpickr.js.org/plugins/\nFor the clear button, can you please describe the issue in more detail? Do you want to be able to clear the date when the calendar modal is open or just in the input?. @chmln, what do you think about this? I think it could be implemented with minimal changes: having each locale file feature a main locale key, for example \"de-DE\" for German and doing toLocaleDateString where possible.\nOr, I think it can be even more simplified by just giving toLocalDateString the language code, like de. Hi @jainvizz,\nDid you figure this out eventually? I'm not that familiar with React, but I took a look at the code and I have a hunch that when you do setDatePickerProps inside onFilterDateChange, it triggers the onChange event again, which triggers the setDatePickerProps, which triggers onChange again, and so on, you get the idea, resulting in the infinite loop.\nIf this is not the exact cause, I think it's something around that (maybe in another part of the code?)\nIn any case, you're getting the recursive error because onFilterDateChange gets called infinitely . I think onValueUpdate might be a better hook here, but I've tried changing onChange to onValueUpdate and it didn't trigger. Not sure why, the react-flatpickr docs said that it should've.\nI'd love to help more, but I think it's better if you ask here: https://github.com/haoxins/react-flatpickr\nPlease let me know how it goes. As said, the picker's design can be modified via a set of  separate CSS rules. Closing issue as out of scope. This is actually more of a CSS problem than something wrong with flatpickr. flatpickr does what it's supposed to, as in, it detects the input is on right side and attaches itself using the right: -1px position, not the left.\nThe problem is that flatpickr is attached to the body and the body doesn't expand its width to fit the element in (the body's width is always what you see in the viewport).\nWhat you need to do is make sure the body's width fits the content, but what I really recommend is adding a wrapper with the width that fits the content and attaching flatpickr to that, as shown here:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/va1u25nL/1/. I am more than interested in this. I can get involved in all of the areas, but I'd like to work on squashing the bugs at first - I think that's a good start. I estimate I can easily put in 4-6 hours a week for the next few months.\nMy Telegram is https://t.me/viorel_me. Hi, were you able to think of a plan for this? I'm with @DM2489 for having a stable release and picking up from there, to avoid duplicate efforts. Hi @youradds , could you please give more details about your report, following the new issue format below?\nThank you!\n\nIF REPORTING A BUG, A REPRO LINK IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY\nFork this: https://jsfiddle.net/tj2Lo4z7/\nYour Environment\n Include the following details: \n flatpickr version used:\n Browser name and version:\n* OS and version:\n. I see that most of the versions you cited were launched before or in 2011. I think it is safe to say that they are not supported by flatpickr. The assumed compatibility is: IE9 and up, Edge, iOS Safari 6+, Chrome 8+, Firefox 6+\nPersonally, I suggest you implement a fallback for browsers that don't support modern technology, if you must support them. Meaning that, if the usage for those browsers is in the 0.00...% range, the development effort might not be worth it.. Closing due to inactivity, assuming problem is solved. Hi Ollesson,\nThe picker should disable itself on Chrome mobile. Are you using the disableMobile tag or is there any other specific option like you're using \"Request desktop site\" that would help me replicate?. Confirmed (functionality stopped working between v4.3.2 and v4.4.0)\nBug appears with the following config:\n{\n    inline: true,\n    enableTime: true,\n    noCalendar: true,\n}\nWith the calendar shown, everything works as expected. Hi khamkim,\nThank you for the report. I was able to replicate on v4.5.4 and pinpoint the issue to the Array method from that's not implemented at all in IE. \nThis will be fixed soon, but in the meantime, you can use a small polyfill to get it going: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from#Polyfill. Hi @JamesJGoodwin, I think you could have a listener on onChange and change the alternative input's value:\njavascript\nonChange: (selectedDates, dateStr, instance) => {\n    instance.altInput.value = moment(selectedDates[0]).format('D MMMM, dd');\n},\nCould you elaborate on the \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442 vs \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 problem a little, though? One does one work and when does the other? Maybe it can be fixed in the core translation.. Hi @JamesJGoodwin, your english is really good, don't worry about it. I understood exactly what you're saying. Really interesting stuff. Opened  #1705 to discuss a solution for this, closing this one.

Hi @pkubik11 , could you make a repro link using this fork, please? https://jsfiddle.net/tj2Lo4z7/ \nit doesn't have to be in ember, please see if you can replicate it in a fiddle. Hi, so finally had some time getting into this.\nAs per the docs, When flatpickr detects a mobile browser, it turns the date input into a native date/time/datetime input.\nThe native date format has a huge setback that you can't set the date format in any way, shape or form. The format is hard set in the RFC to a variation of mm/dd/YYYY.\nHere is a great discussion with some tips and tricks to overcoming the problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7372038/is-there-any-way-to-change-input-type-date-format\nI'm going to close this issue now, sorry for not being able to help more. Do I need to do anything special for circleci?. HI @dpcreative,\nAs this is a very specific scenario, we would need an example to see exactly how you're doing stuff. You can fork this template: https://jsfiddle.net/tj2Lo4z7/. Could you save the fiddle again, please? I don't think it's the latest version. I only have 10 lines of JS. What an interesting problem!\nOk, so I would suggest you do something like what's below. flatpickr returns an instance of the instantianted picker so keep all instances in the array so you can quickly access previous/current/next instances. Then use the methods on the instance to get the value. Please adjust and optimize as needed\n```javascript\nlet flatpickrs = [\n  flatpickr(\"#homesearch_startDate_0\", {\n    defaultDate: new Date().fp_incr(3),\n    minDate: new Date().fp_incr(1),\n    altInput: false,\n    altFormat: \"F j, Y\",\n    dateFormat: \"Y-m-d\"\n  })\n];\nfunction addFlatpickr() {\n  let previousId = flatpickrs.length - 1;\n  let newId = previousId + 1;\nflatpickrs.push(flatpickr(\"#homesearch_startDate_\" + newId, {\n    defaultDate: flatpickrs[previousId].selectedDates[0],\n    minDate: flatpickrs[previousId].selectedDates[0],\n    altInput: false,\n    altFormat: \"F j, Y\",\n    dateFormat: \"Y-m-d\"\n  }))\n}\naddFlatpickr();\naddFlatpickr();\naddFlatpickr();\n``. if you have a flatpickr and you know its id in the array is 5 (for example), you can get the previous instance withflatpickrs[4]`. Hi, thanks for the report!\nThis looks like an interesting issue. Could we maybe allow an altInputElementType/Tag config option to use different type of elements?. to manually open the picker, you can assign the instance to a variable and the use the .open() method on it:\nvar pickr = flatpickr(\".date_time_picker\", {\nand \npickr.open(). Closing as having a separate element that gets updated looks like a much better solution. You can tell flatpickr where to be appended using the appendTo config flag and giving it an HTMLElement. If you need it after a specific div, you can create an empty div where you need it and appendTo it. appendTo is redundant to static. static puts the calendar in the same container as the input, appendTo puts the calendar where you need it. If the calendar is miss positioned, it's a CSS issue for the wrapper you appended to. Glad to help!. ",

(00, 15, 30, 45) So being able to set any minute doesn't really work in this scenario. The idea, for me, with the minuteIncrement was so that I could indicate which minutes are available so users know not expect a reminder to be sent at 09:05, 09:10, 09:35 etc. With all that said, it's not a major spanner in the works, I just wanted to explain my situation.\nApart from a couple of small things like these, I really like your date/time picker and it's probably the best looking one that I have come across.\nGood work\nThank you\n. Thank you for doing this, I have everything working great now :).

Hi guys, just to wanted to add some input on the matter if that's cool :)\nI read the issue to be more about what the user does next to confirm their date/time entries.\nI don't think having a hidden time input helps, if anything I believe it confuses the matter further and just divides data entry that's being inserted into the same field. It also just takes the user to the already available (when not hidden) \"next step\" and then once again leaves them not knowing what to do after they have entered their date/time. I believe the \"confirmation\" part is the \"next step\" which the OP was trying to refer to.\nAs a suggestion, which I think will make for a better UX, how about making the time input visible by default again (as with previous versions) and instead, have a checkmark appear once both date and time have been entered? That way, the user is presented with a date/time picker as expected, and then once they've entered a date and a time, they are then presented with a \"visual cue for next action\", which would be confirming their entries. I think this would make for a much better UX while still retaining the simple and elegant design of the calendar.\nThoughts?. I think the 3rd one down looks quite good with the date and time separated, checkmark at the bottom of both, it also allows for clearer controls on the time input and UI still looks quite refined. Out of curiosity, what datetime picker is that?. I noticed a similar \"issue\" and thought that I might as well point it out here because it is very much related to this suggestion.\nWhen using the scroll wheel on the hours, AM and PM change accordingly, but this does not happen when using the arrows.\nIt's minor, but for consistency, I think it would be useful for AM/PM to change when using the arrows too.. > There must be something wrong in your end.\nI would usually agree, but this issue is not present in 2.0.\nWhen I was first trying to figure out the problem, the only change I could visibly see between 2.0 and 2.3.4 was the addition of the slide/animation, so it presented itself as the problem considering this was the only visible difference to me, as I had not updated in between 2.0 and 2.3.4. \nSince your reply, I have just tried all versions from 2.0 upward and the issue is actually present from 2.0.7 onward.\nI will try to narrow it down a bit more than that, but it must be something to do with changes/additions made in the 2.0.7 update.\nI have changed the title of this thread to better reflect the issue.\nThank you for your reply\n. OK, I had a little play around comparing 2.0.5 (which worked as expected) with versions 2.0.7 upwards and I found that the removal of e.stopPropagation(); from the selectDate function was causing the issue.\nI added it back into 2.3.4 and it seems to be resolved now.\nI'm not sure if it will cause any issues elsewhere or with different set ups, but I have not noticed any yet with the set up that I am using..

I do want to re-emphasize their is real value in being able to differentiate (via css) between the first selected date and the second date as mentioned in the original post. :)\n. @TGMorais If you look at the commit history, you will see that @chmln's commit adding the 'inRange' class was after the 2.0.2 release was cut.\n. By the way, I have seen calendars implemented somewhat similar to the existing calendar setup that is currently offered, but with a twist (they have two inputs) that I think works ok for their situations but not for this component (which has one input).\nFor example, airline websites often have two calendar inputs - one for departure date and one for returning. If one has a range already selected then they may click on the 'departure' input and click on a new calendar date which moves only the departure date (unless they selected a date after the return date, in which case the return date is cleared). They may also click on the 'returning' input and click on a new calendar date which moves only the returning date (unless they selected a date before the departure date, in which case the departure date is cleared).\nExamples:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/\nhttps://www.kayak.com/\nhttps://www.orbitz.com/\nhttp://www.delta.com/\n. Thanks! The changes are looking great! It's definitely improved.\nTo be perfectly honest, I do not use the time component of the widget and had not thought about that use case. I'll definitely keep you posted if I have any ideas.\n. So, I have another suggestion for a change in behavior, and since this issue is still open I'll put it here.\nUsing v2.0.5. If you are in range mode and navigate to several months in the future (e.g. December 2016)  and select the start date of the range, the calendar then jumps back to the current month (e.g. October 2016). This was quite unexpected. I think after selecting the start date the month should not change.\n. Uh oh, It also looks like the UI for selecting ranges across months is not working as well either. The highlighted inRange dates are wrong.\n. Another issue:\nUsing v2.0.5. In range mode. Selecting a day in the current month, and then selecting one of the \"greyed out\" next-month dates on the same calendar page ends up selecting the wrong date range. I hope the way I described that makes sense, I can attempt to clarify if needed.\nAlso, I can create separate issues for each of these problems if you prefer. Just let me know.\n. Sure thing.\nA new bug:\nUsing the examples page. In range mode. Select a range in the next month (e.g. Nov 15 - Nov 17). Then select a new start date on the same calendar page (e.g. Nov 25). Notice that the month goes to the current month (October) after selection, very confusing. I would expect the calendar to stay on the same page.\nAnother bug (CSS):\nUsing the examples page. In range mode. Select a range in the current month (e.g. Oct 16 - Oct 20). Then select a greyed out date on the same calendar page (e.g. Nov 4). Notice that the selected date does not have a blue circle when not being hovered. The css style is being overridden by .flatpickr-day.nextMonthDay.\n. @chmln - I don't know if you have any plans to address @diit's issue, but it appears like my original issue and subsequent follow ups have been resolved. I suggest we close this issue - and if you believe it's valid, I would make a separate issue for @diit.\nThoughts?\n. I can agree with that. The only issue without a workaround is the incorrectly placed \"today\" class (e.g. class=\"flatpickr-day today\").\n. I believe a workaround for the \"today\" class issue may be addressed via a hack put in place through the onDayCreate() method when the next version gets released.\n. Did you add some custom css? Maybe a padding or margin to the dates? I did that once and it pushed the last html element in each week to the next week, resulting in 6 day weeks!\nIt took me a second to understand what happened.\nIf you didn't use custom css, and you see the issue in the official demo, it may be a spacing issue specific to the OS (wider fonts?) or browser (IE? Which I don't have on my Mac).\n. Also, don't forget to remove the title attribute if scrolling is disabled. It currently reads title=\"Scroll to increment\". :)\n. I too am unable to reproduce the issue.\nChrome 54.0.2840.87\nMacOS Sierra 10.12.1\nVersion: Whatever is on the examples website, 2.0.8 or master...\n. This seems to be the same issue as #368.\n. @chmln - You may want to check https://www.browserstack.com/ - which will allow you to test across many browsers, including iOS.

Thanks for the quick fix. I can see that these examples use the native controls by default (as stated in the docs). However, it would be useful to show the effect of disableMobile: \"true\" in the mobile support  section. Also, it appears that the inline calender does not work correctly on iOS 10 either, as clicks are hardly recognized - only long clicks seem to work. Any idea why this is? No touch support?. Thinking more about this, can we have an event or hook which can be used for the purpose of preventing a selection to be made? Something like this:\njavascript\n{\n   beforeChange: function(selectedDates, dateStr, instance) {\n     return false; // prevent change\n   }\n}. In addition, the up/down arrow keys will both navigate the picker as well as scroll the page up and down. I preventDefault within the keydown event handler should take care of this.. I was using momentjs in those custom methods, which means the given format cannot be used. While easy to work around, I was hoping it could still be configured to use a format that's appropriate.. @chmln thanks for reopening! I'm using momentjs throughout my app, so I prefer to have consistent formatting across all my components that deal with dates. \nI was using a hybrid of flatpickr's built-in functionality an momentjs before, and contemplated mapping from momentjs format to flatpickr's until I discovered you could completely swap out formatting/parsing with your own. \nMuch appreciated, keep up the great work!.

I'm experiencing the same thing in iOS when I try to attach flatpickr to a non-input field, then using onChange event to display the selected datetime in that field. However, I may not be doing it the correct way. Since I couldn't figure out how to make 'altInput' work in this use case, this is what I did:\nhtml\n<div class=\"time-button form-control\"></div>\n<input name=\"event_starttime[]\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"time-input\">\n\nJavascript\n$( \".time-button\" ).flatpickr({\n...\n    onChange: function(selectedDates, dateStr, instance) {\n        // display date\n        $(this.element).html(dateStr);\n\n        // put date in hidden input field\n        $(this.element).siblings('input.time-input').eq(0).val(flatpickr.formatDate(selectedDates[0], \"Y-m-d h:i K\"));\n    }\n});\n\nIt works great in a browser, but in mobile (at least iOS), it inserts a new input field just below my div element with class \"flatpickr-mobile\".

See the first calendar in this example (hover over the 15 or 16):\nhttp://codepen.io/getup8/pen/zoJQYb\nNot a great way to do it though; I think better to assign a class (as we're already doing) or id to those dates you want a tooltip for and do it using JS..

I think it's possible there could be an issue with how the mouse events are being fired off in the context of the Web Component vs being in a root document - my original suggested solution was based off a quick check through branches of code that seemed like they could be responsible for the behavior I'm seeing. Just have to do a little research on my end for now. If someone else comes in with a good solution we can use that, but I'll see what I can add on my own.. I've set flatpickr to use the web component root in my local copy and flatpickr now stays open correctly.\nNext problem - the blur event is not firing when I click off and seems to be using strange collision detection for this.. Had some time to dig into this today. Flatpickr was not written with web component usage in mind originally, but as our web evolves we can evolve all the tools people use it on. I have managed to get flatpickr working inside a web component with the changes made in this branch and now much rejoicing can be had (#510).\nI haven't been able to comprehensively test this except on my setup but I am definitely good now.

    "Seldaek": "This would be great but I think even better would be to allow the mousewheel to scroll the month when you scroll anywhere on the calendar that's not the year/hour/minute. That makes it much easier to \"aim\" for with the mouse.. I think I have seen this bug too, but as I have variable date formats I anyway implemented my own parseDate method which helps:\nparseDate: function (str) {\n        return moment.utc(str, CURRENT_DATE_FORMAT).toDate();\n    },\nWhere CURRENT_DATE_FORMAT is a momentjs date format, like DD.MM.YYYY in your case. This solved it for me.. @Thisman but IMO the calendar should close when you mousedown/touchstart anywhere outside of the calendar widget or the input, not only when a click event is triggered.. Thanks. @chmln actually the keyboard navigation stuff is causing a bunch of issues for us, as it interferes with the rest of the application, especially in the inline calendar we have which is changing month/year at random while you use arrow keys in other places of the application. IMO this should only happen while you are either focused in the input field linked to that respective flatpickr instance, or within one of the flatpickr's input fields like the year field. Acting on any keydown event happening anywhere in the window means you are not playing well with the environment.\nI think ideally it should react only when the right input fields are the target, but also having an option to disable the onKeyDown event listeners entirely would be good I guess. For example we like to allow people to type dates in a smart way in the input field, but with the last version of flatpickr when you press left/right you can't move the cursor in the input field anymore, it's just changing months on you and losing the focus from the input field.\nThanks for all the work on this though :). That is correct yes, the calendar with inline mode reacts to arrow keys even when it's not in focus. Your fix looks good from a quick glance at the code. I'll try again as soon as you release a new version.. @chmln the keyboard navigation occurring in inline calendars is fixed with 1.5.1, thanks! However it is still not possible to navigate within the input field, if people want to edit the date by typing in a date.\nIt'd be great to have an option to disable keyboard events entirely at the flatpickr level, because in our case they are only doing harm to the UI we built around it. Basically I have my own keyboard handler so that up/down keys move the date by one day, and left/right do nothing and move the cursor. Now this last bit is broken as it's taken over by flatpickr. You can see this at https://teamup.com/ks45b58c111024c739/events/99289753 if you're interested. For example you can in the \"From\" field select all text and type \"4/11\" and then tab and the date will be normalized. But you can also tab next to the \"To\" field, and use arrow keys to change to 04/18/2017 for example.. Note that this version still uses the old flatpickr release, but this functionality is now broken if I update.. @chmln thanks, I can confirm using 2.5.8 is now working as expected.\n. ",

For now, I capture the keyboard navigation using the onKeyDown Hook and re-implement the logic for \"ArrowLeft\" and \"ArrowRight\" without the self.config.allowInput === false check.\nThis involves copying the logic for focusOnDay (getFirstAvailableDay, getNextAvailableDay, focusOnDayElem, isInView) as it is not exposed through the api. Somehow my re-implementation fixed the issue of not navigating \"over\" disabled days (I replaced isEnabled calls with c.className.indexOf(\"disabled\") === -1 check). . @andrewlouie are there any plans to address this?.

Try to set the dateFormat: Y-m-d and only then use altInput: true, altFormat: d.m.Y. This should help.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/LLppa1h0/1/. @didamaran make sure your Store.mainObj.mydate is not null/undefined or has different format. Also, you may have difficulties with flatpickr because flatpickr is loading earlier, then the Store.mainObj.mydate value becomes accessible or whatever.. @chmln yep, animate: false resolved this issue.. > I don't quite understand what should flatpickr do in your case?\n@chmln just show this date, like value=\"\" does. Or even better - trigger a hook, so i could catch it and say to my client Oh, the date you selected earlier is no more selectable now, etc.. @MaxZGYL yes, you can disable it by animate: false. @MaxZGYL it's working just not like it's described in docs for some reason. onMonthChange is triggering if you chose the day of the other month instead of already chosen. For example, you have chose April 2017 and you got displayed all of the days in april, but you still have some days displayed of previous and next monthes, so if you click on one of those dates, only then it will trigger. See pic below.\n\n. @chmln okay, if i want to set another date, i'll use setDate. But, for example, what if i have multilanguage website and user can select his region language, how can i change option locale for him? I'm trying to do this with theredate.set(locale, 'ru');, but there's an error throwing: Uncaught ReferenceError: locale is not defined. Also, i cannot change minDate value - this is not defined too. So, for what purposes set() needed and how can i use it? Much thanks in advance.. @softkaikai i don't really understand, why do you use trigger('blur'). Is it necessary? Bcz, it may cause the issue. Also, you should remove readonly attribute. Flatpickr instance makes your input readonly already. And i tried to reproduce your issue with no success: https://jsfiddle.net/n5xy91qa/. @inferno7291 what is your expected behavior? And, please, describe your issue more detailed.. @theRealBugger try using destroy() method. It may help.. @believeZJP if you want to allow users to change the date by typing it directly in input, then you have to specify a format for input date. Try using dateFormat: 'd.m' in your config. This should help.. @mkaufger i don't think this is about Flatpickr functionality. You can solve your task by creating 3 tabs or 3 radio checkboxes and change Flatpickr config on the wing depending on which tab was selected or which radio checkbox was tagged. You can read more about set() method in here: \nhttps://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/instance-methods-properties-elements/#set-option-value. @sanxac make sure you set the time_24hr: true. I've tried to reproduce your issue with no success: https://jsfiddle.net/s0k7v0f8/. @719media i don't know if there is a way to solve this problem correctly, but when i meet this problem, i've find out something like this:\njavascript\n$('.flatpickr').siblings('input.form-control.input').prop('disabled', true);\nSo, when you're using the altInput option, it creates the second input and hides the original input. All you have to do, is to find neighbor input and make it disabled. . @fedeotaran hi. Flatpickr is not to blame for. First of all, currently you are not parsing any date so flatpickr may set a random date value(i guess?). Try using defaultDate option to set the date you want: \n```javascript\nlet myDate = '14.12.2017';\n$('.flatpickr').flatpickr({\n    defaultDate: myDate,\n    dateFormat: 'd.m.Y',\n        maxDate: '15.12.2017'\n});\n``\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/jmqe1tg5/. @Onefivefournine hi. There should be a new plugin released soon with much more advanced range settings and so on. Please take a look at https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/issues/584#issuecomment-289295697. This is happening bcz some of flatpickr elements has fixed width property315px`.. Hello. That was fixed in version 3.x.. @skwny i have had the same issue with 2.6.3, but after i updated flatpickr the issue has gone. \n\nI was playing around with some things and now this is working\n\nI can assume that your server use caching and while you doing some stuff the cache expired and you loaded a fresh version of the flatpickr. Nevertheless, i glad to hear you resolved your issue \ud83d\ude03 . @chmln this issue is still relevant. Here you can see as I picking up the date of current month and the label and calendar icon turns light-blue. After date was selected the label and icon returned in grey. When I selecting date from next month the label and icon turns light-blue, but when the date was selected they still remains light-blue which means they're still :focused.. @chmln this new update is causing some issues such as @jackfaulkner's. Can we get a usual JS code? Or better - a single production-ready and all-in-one flatpickr.min.js with all plugins/locales/etc? It would be lovely.. @chmln here, take a look on my demo. After I selected a date range I can only edit the start-date and the end-date. But I want to select the date range once. And if I click on some date again after selection then date range selection should start anew.. @chmln well, I tried new version of plugin with those settings:\nvar flatpickr_there = flatpickr('#takeoff_date', {\n    locale: 'ru',\n    minDate: moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD'),\n    dateFormat: \"Y-m-d\",\n    altInput: true,\n    altFormat: 'l, d.m',\n    disableMobile: true,\n    defaultDate: [\n        typeof Cookies.get('date_there') === 'undefined' ? moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD') : Cookies.get('date_there'),\n        typeof Cookies.get('date_thence') === 'undefined' ? moment().add('10', 'days').format('YYYY-MM-DD') : Cookies.get('date_thence')\n    ],\n    plugins: [new rangePlugin({input: \"#back_date\"})]\n});\nAnd since I applied new settings I can't select the start-date. Clicking on first input does nothing. No calendar animation triggered and no errors were found in the console. Nevertheless, second input is triggering normally and I can select and change the end-date. . Hello, @viorelsfete. Well, I don't know english so well to describe the difference in a proper way and I can't say that I could provide any tangible difference but I'll try, The point is that in english you usually use format March 4, 2019 or March 14th (when you are not telling us about year) whenever you talk about any exact date. In russian when we want to describe a day of a month (and a year, optionally) we use 4 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 or 4 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 2019. For example, I'm going to buy a car on March 4th which translates as '\u042f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0441\u044c \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0443 4 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430'. But when you want to describe only a month itself then you say \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 which translates as March.\nBasically, months itself (with or without a year) should be:\njavascript\nvar months = ['\u042f\u043d\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c', '\u0424\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c', '\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442', '\u0410\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c', '\u041c\u0430\u0439', '\u0418\u044e\u043d\u044c', '\u0418\u044e\u043b\u044c', '\u0410\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442', '\u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c', '\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c', '\u041d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c', '\u0414\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0440\u044c']\nAnd when you are talking about exact day (with or without a year) it should be:\njavascript\nvar months = ['\u042f\u043d\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044f', '\u0424\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f', '\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430', '\u0410\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f', '\u041c\u0430\u044f', '\u0418\u044e\u043d\u044f', '\u0418\u044e\u043b\u044f', '\u0410\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430', '\u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f', '\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f', '\u041d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f', '\u0414\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0440\u044f']\nExamples: \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 2019 (March 2019), \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c 2021 (September 2021), 21 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 (March 21th), 9 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f (September 19th).

With some trial and error, it looks like it has to handle both.\nGiven that I only need to support two altFormats (d.m.Y and j M Y), and a dateFormat of Y-m-d, specifying my own parseDate function appears to solve the problem for me.\njs\nparseDate: function(dateString) {\n  var match;\n  // dateFormat\n  match = dateString.match(/(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})/);\n  if (match != null) {\n    return new Date(match[1], match[2] - 1, match[3]);\n  }\n  // altFormat 1\n  match = dateString.match(/(\\d{2})\\.(\\d{2})\\.(\\d{4})/);\n  if (match != null) {\n    return new Date(match[3], match[2] - 1, match[1]);\n  }\n  // altFormat 2\n  match = dateString.match(/(\\d{1,2}) (\\w{3}) (\\d{4})/);\n  if (match != null) {\n    return new Date(dateString);\n  }\n  // unparseable\n  return new Date();\n}\nWithout my parseDate function, flatpickr matches 23 Mar 2017 against timeRegex here, which sets the date to today (line 2099).  Which explains the behaviour I was seeeing.\nAnyway, is this the correct way to go?. OK, thanks for the confirmation.\nI think the docs explain the difference between dateFormat and altFormat well, but it isn't clear (to me) what format Flatpickr uses to parse a date string from either the <input>'s initial value or the defaultDate option.\nRegarding a date parser: I'd be happy with a very simple, no-surprises one built in; and the capability to replace it with something else, if I needed something more sophisticated.\nIn other words, don't clog up Flatpickr with a complicated date parser because Flatpickr's value is as a lightweight datetime picker, not a parser.  Let a dedicated external parser handle the parsing and all the weird edge cases.  For example rome leans on moment.js.\nAnyway, thanks for a great plugin!. I added this to my JS:\njs\n  document.querySelectorAll('p.date').addEventListener('change', function() {\n    var fp, newDate;\n    fp = this._flatpickr;\n    newDate = this.querySelector('input:not([type=\"hidden\"])').value;\n    return fp.setDate(newDate, false, \"d.m.Y\");\n  });\nThis seems to work on Safari (while still working on Chrome and Firefox).  Thank you.\nHowever I thought the allowInput: true option would make all this work without any custom event listeners?. ",

It appears that this is not limited to either allowInput or multiple flatpickr instances specifically. Rather, if I have more then one focusable element (the input becoming a flatpickr), and leave with the keyboard, it does not close by itself.\nThe problem here seems that the blur event is registered with the documentClick function, with will only close if the event was fired on an element not associated with the flatpickr instance. I'm working on a PR for this right now.\nAlso related to #623.. You can use Flatpickr.localize(Flatpickr.l10ns.fr).\nTo set defaults like the first day of week, use e.g. Flatpickr.l10ns.default.firstDayOfWeek = 1.\nTo set the default configuration of other options, use e.g. Flatpickr.defaultConfig.dateFormat = 'd.m.Y'.\n.

I just updated to confirm as well, but still running into the same/similar issue:\n\n4.3.2 is the latest version that works for me using vue-flatpickr.\n. Sorry, I will be on a mobile device all day from now, but my config is:\n```javascript\nconfig: {\n    wrap: true,\n    altInput: true,\n    enableTime: true,\n    locale: {\n        \"firstDayOfWeek\": 1\n    },\n    minDate: \"today\",\n    onChange: function (selectedDate, dateStr) {\n        this.removeWarningColors();\n    }.bind(this),\ndisable: [\n    function(date) {\n        return this.disabledDates(date);\n    }.bind(this)\n],\n\n},\n```. I will reach back on here later tonight if I find what the issue could be.. The issue I have is more of an edge case, I assume.\nFirst off, I apologize, but I won't be able to provide a fiddle because of time reasons. If I have some more time within the next couple of days/weeks, I will definitely recreate the issue.\nAnyways, let me demo the issue in the meantime:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GxnvdSN.gifv\nThe width size seems to be calculated ^4.3.2 on .flatpickr-calendar, whereas on 4.3.2 it did not, causing it to be too wide.  \n@chmln any idea by the gif (without the fiddle yet) of what could be the issue?\n. I have had a similar issue with Google's autocomplete .pac-container. The \"issue\" there was the position: absolute was based on the body and not the container it was in.\nstatic: true without wrap-mode the issue is present still, but it seems to fix the positioning. The flatpickr opens and scrolls with the container, but the styling is incorrect. .flatpickr-container has a width of 1px for example.\n\nIf inline: true the styling looks similar to the static: true flatpickr.\nI also did not make any style changes to the calendar itself, besides some colors and font-family.\nWith flatpickr 4.3.2, the styling appeared to be calculated correctly on my end.\nIf I find some time soon, I will try to add a jsfiddle.. can you please send a codepen or jsfiddle that replicates the issue?.

Here's a pen:\nhttps://codepen.io/Taeon/pen/bWBxKb\nI guess it might be a fairly specific issue for my application, since I'm using a generic form handling library which talks to the underlying form element rather than the alternative input that flatpickr creates when using this option.\nI've fixed it by catching the change to the underlying element and setting the 'new' flatpickr element's disabled attribute as well..

Then try with altInput disabled.\nSeems with altInput a second text input is created, while the other (original) one, which has the proper defaultValue property, get's hidden.\nI figure the form's reset event should be captured, and then have a look at the defaultValue property of the original (now hidden) form element doesn't work, see below.\nNote that hidden elements don't reset to their defaultValue (at least in Chrome & FF). \nSo (as one might think of as a possible solution) giving the altInput element a defaultValue (which is currently empty (that's why it's resetting to blank)) won't be sufficient.. Workaround (for now):\n```js\nonReady: function (dateObj, dateStr, instance) {\n  if (! instance.altInput) return;                            // only needed for altInput\ninstance.__defaultValue = instance.input.defaultValue;      // double lodash to be safe\n  instance.altInput.defaultValue = instance.altInput.value;   // set value on form.reset()\n  instance.input.form.addEventListener('reset', function(e) {\n    instance.setDate(instance.__defaultValue);\n  });\n}\n``\n(Or one could simply assign the defaultValue to a local variable in theonReadyfunction (no need to append it to theinstance` object really..))\nBtw (interesting caveat): turns out that when changing the value of an hidden element, it's defaultValue gets updated to this value as well. (So we can't check the original element for the default value.).

    "kmagilavy": "The issue you're seeing is that the mousedown event that should fire when the second date is selected, does not. This mousedown event is what is responsible for selecting the second date. If it doesn't get called we don't get a second date.\nSo what's going on:\nThere is a \"mouseover\" binding that gets applied when running flatpickr in range mode:\n\nThis handler is what is responsible for the painting of the range classes like startRange and endRange that get applied to the day elements after you've picked the first date of the range and are moving your mouse over various days on the calendar.\nWhen debugging on my phone I determined that this mouseover event is fired as part of the tap on calendar days.\nOn iOS it is documented that if elements on the page are modified in any way within a mouseover event, subsequent mouse events will not fire. You can read more here.\nNow here's a look at the mouseover event from the library:\n\nFirst thing to notice is that this function only does something if we have exactly one selected date. This explains why there are no problems with the selection of the first date as this handler is fired before mousedown, we have 0 dates, we immediately bail out of this function, no elements have been modified, the mousedown is allowed to fire, and we get our first date.\nThe problem arises after we've selected the first date and are in this function again as a result of selecting the second date. This time we DO have 1 date already selected and this function starts painting classes onto calendar days. That is considered a modification and iOS will not call the mousedown, so no second selected date.\nSo why does it work on the second tap? Because you've clicked it once it has a focus of sort, so tapping it again does not call the mouseover again. No mouseover event, no modifications to the page, so the mousedown can fire and we get our second date.\nTo test this out yourself you can comment out the mouseover binding and you'll see that it works. But that's not ideal because we need the mouseover for desktop users.\nSo how to fix it...my first attempt was to wrap the binding with the isMobile check that's already available via the plugin.\n\nBut this won't work because we're all running our calendars in range mode and here's the code for calculating isMobile:\n\nSince we aren't running it in \"single\" mode isMobile is always false, so that's no good. Ultimately we decided to take the navigator.userAgent check from there and use that as the condition:\n\nAnd this seems to fix it.  Does anybody see an issue skipping the mouse over event for iOS - the correct classes still get applied to the dates without it as part of the selection redraw.\n. This doesn't quite fix it.

If you haven't seen it already, you should check out the examples here.\nYou can set the dates with the example code here. It sounds like you want \"defaultDate\", which you can specify as a single value (for a single date picker) or an array of two values (for range pickers).\nFor a range picker, set the mode to \"range\". This will allow you to pick multiple times, but the interface is a little clunky, since the time is only shown for the current date you're picking; that is, for a range calendar that shows times, when you make your first click to select the initial value, you can change the time, then when you select the second date as the end of the range, you can choose another time, but the display does not show both at once. Perhaps it would be better to show the second time underneath the first. Regardless, you can only select multiple times for the same day by using a range picker, and you can only select a beginning time (with a date) and end time (with a date). \nIf you need to allow a user to select many times for a single date, you would be better off using once instance of the date picker to select a date, then multiple instances of a time picker to select the times. That would almost certainly be the better user experience.. I mean to use something like this. Is this not the sort of thing you'd need?. In that case, wouldn't you just want a datetime picker for each instance? I'm sorry; I really don't understand the problem :-(. I don't know of a way of doing that natively. I think if it were me, I'd probably create the inputs separately, as in the example above.. To disable the date, use the timepicker  options, as is done in the fiddle above. If you're going to use inline for the calendar, use \"showAlways\": true in the config object for the confirmPlugin.. Do you mean you want to show the calendar with a specific date, but now allow the user to change it?. I see.

When booking an appartement, the user has to be able to select dates that are actually reported as reserved/disabled by my API as it's possible for a guest to check-out and for another to check-in on the same day.\nI found a solution that doesn't touch flatpickr's codebase by using the onDayCreate hook and modifying the disable array so that I add a day to the from date and subtract a day from the to date:\njs\n// shrink reserved ranges by 1 on each site\nfor (var j = 0; j < reservedDates.length; j++) {\n disabledDates.push({\n  from: moment(reservedDates[j].from).add(1, 'd').toDate(),\n  to: moment(reservedDates[j].to).subtract(1, 'd').toDate()\n });\n}\njs\n// add CSS classes to the days before and after the disabled ranges\nnew Flatpickr(objCal, {\n inline: true,\n mode: \"range\",\n disable: disabledDates,\n onDayCreate: function(dObj, dStr, fp, dayElem) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < reservedDates.length; i++) {\n   if (dayElem.dateObj.getTime() === reservedDates[i].from.getTime()) {\n    dayElem.classList.add(\"check-in\");\n   }\n   if (dayElem.dateObj.getTime() === reservedDates[i].to.getTime()) {\n    dayElem.classList.add(\"check-out\");\n   }\n  }\n }\n});\nSure there is a better approach. This is getting inefficient if there are lots of reservedDates. But it's working for now in readonly mode.

Thanks for the new version, I had problems with my library with 2 frameworks Aurelia and Angular (I maintain both) and the Aurelia is now fixed with the new way to import your library \njavascript\nimport * as flatpickr from 'flatpickr';\nI did not have a chance to try with Angular yet (I use it at work), but it's looking promising.\nOnce I can take time to test it out with Angular (which was why I opened this issue), I will report back. Thank you for this great library. By the way, I got into using your lib because of the beautiful UI and different theme available, good job :) . Unfortunately, I can't get it to work when building my Angular 4 library. However I don't have these errors that I mentioned when I opened the issue.\nI know that the problem I have is all but related to rollup.js (tree shacking) and because they strictly only allow to import a library this way import flatpickr from 'flatpickr' and they refuse this way import * as flatpickr from 'flatpickr'\nI have the same problem with moment.js and had to resolve to a monkey patch to get rollup happy. But I tried this patch with flatpickr and that doesn't work.\nModify the tsconfig.json to allow synthetic default\njavascript\n{\n  \"compileOnSave\": false,\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true,\n  ...\nand try the monkey patch\njavascript\nimport * as _flatpickr from 'flatpickr';\nconst flatpickr: any = (<any>_flatpickr).default || _flatpickr;\nI can get the library to compile with the monkey patch, but then using the lib in my Angular App just throws a bunch of unrelated error. If I remove flatpickr and recompile then my App is back to normal, so I know it's related to that. \nI spent over an hour trying all kind of different ways to import it without much success. I'll have to put that aside for Angular, but at least it works in Aurelia now. . oh I could give that a try tomorrow at work, will let you know. Thanks. Sorry for the delay, I finally took the time to try this out and... I'm happy to report back that it's works \ud83c\udf89 \nHowever for TypeScript to accept it, I had to write it this way (else require is unknown by TS)\njavascript\ndeclare function require(name: string);\nconst flatpickr = require('flatpickr');\nI can finally close the issue \ud83d\ude04 . @chmln you mentioned that you published v4.1.2 but I see latest version in Github as v4.1.1.

This solution doesn't serve me because I'm building an internal UI Kit where I won't have any of that type of control.\nThe preferable scenario would be:\n```javascript\nconst globalOnOpen = flatpickr.onOpen (function (){\n    console.log ('onOpen called globally');\n});\nconst callOnElement = flatpickr(\".date\", {\n    onOpen: function (){\n        console.log ('onOpen called on element');\n    }\n});\n```\nRegarding the theme. I can't use that exact theme but I'm more than interested in helping you to get a theme :) Even pushing the visual effect for the behavior that I'm trying to achieve. Lets talk.. I'm facing the same issue with the year input.\n\nI would recommend the usage of an input type number with a complete css reset:\nhtml\n<input class=\"numInput cur-year\" type=\"number\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-label=\"Year\">\nscss\n.numInput.cur-year {\n    -webkit-appearance: textfield;\n    -moz-appearance: textfield;\n    appearance: textfield ;\n    /**\n     * All current styles\n     */\n}\nBased on this article probably we wouldn't have to worry about IE since it doesn't apply the spinner controls.\nThis would bring a better accessibility to mobile environments since they make use of default and specific numeric keyboards. It would also bring the possibility to define max, min and step attributes as helpers controlling data input.. Further I would suggest the pattern of the input to be \\d{1,4}. Get first combination of digits allowing a length of 1 to 4 (considering for example year 20 A.D.).

It looks like this was already fixed in a later version: https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/issues/1350. The disable option takes an array of functions.  You can either write one function to disable Sundays and those specific dates, or for readability, use two functions:\n$(\".date-picker\").flatpickr({\n  disable: [function(date) {\n    return (date.getDay() === 0);\n  },\n  function(date) {\n    return (date.toISOString().slice(0,10) === '2018-08-22' || date.toISOString().slice(0,10) === '2018-09-24');\n  }]\n});\n. Hi @joeattardi , the first commit here has introduced a new issue. When you first open flatpickr and press up/down the event is triggered on the input and $i is undefined so pressing up and down doesn't work until you press left/right. \nAny suggestions how to fix this without reverting?

It should be \"../types/locale\" and a fix for that was added in https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/pull/1455\nLong story short, next version should work and you'll also need to update typescript in your project.. It's JavaScript doing the select all, not CSS. I think it was intended for the time input but seems to apply to the year as well.\nYou can block it from triggering\ndocument.getElementsByClassName('cur-year').addEventListener('mousedown', function(evt) { evt.stopPropagation(); });. You would have to get the format of the locale date before initializing flatpickr. I found this:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/2388115/get-locale-short-date-format-using-javascript\nthat might help you out. I believe this was fixed in https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr/pull/1433 for the next version. How about fp.clear() ?. I'm not sure what the google datepicker style is, but I use two input fields and use flatpickr with both of them, the second one using options \n{\n    enableTime: true,\n    noCalendar: true,\n    dateFormat: \"H:i\",\n}. I've done something like this. Maybe this will help:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/andrewlouie/dbuh6zkg/. Is it maybe a problem with the version? When I try with the js fiddle it seems to work:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/tj2Lo4z7/. I see it now. Flatpickr changes it to an input type=\"date\" on mobile so that the Android date picker will come up. There is no other way to do that really. jQuery datepicker doesn't use the default Android date picker. You can pass disableMobile: true if you want to use flatpickr on Android but depending on where it is on the page it may not look great.. I'm sure you can find a hacky workaround ( https://jsfiddle.net/andrewlouie/7q9zxy3v/ ) until Google fixes the problem. Flatpickr is changing it to a date input when disableMobile is false. @dbollinger There is also Control/Command + cursors to navigate by year/month. Other than perhaps adding keys to navigate to the start/end of a month, all the same functionality is there.. That would be awesome. I haven't tested with a screen reader or anything like that and I can imagine not all keyboard/screen reader users would know to use control/cursor.. Fixed. Thanks. Can you be more specific on the options and browser you're using? I tried on Mojave with Safari and I don't notice any difference. Could we get a fiddle? I can seem to reproduce this. Oh I see. Do you have a use case for 7 digit years? Maybe just a max-length on that input would be the best fix.

Another possible issue is that when sending the form, the first element of range still sends the value as \"2018-04-09 to 2018-04-18\" instead of just the first value.

One way to work this around is to modify the localization file by adding the english variable into the l10ns array:\nvar fp$47 = typeof window !== \"undefined\" && window.flatpickr !== undefined\n    ? window.flatpickr\n    : {\n        l10ns: {},\n    };\nvar english = {\n...\n};\nfp$47.l10ns.en = english\nfp$47.l10ns;\nI guess this is not the proper way to fix it thought..

    "strongui": "@chmln \nI'm trying to reproduce it, but here the parseDate is not firing at all. To be fair, in my personal setup I'm using the confirm plugin, I don't know if that makes a difference. How do I include the confirm plugin into this example to try to reproduce? And even without the plugin, why is parseDate not firing?. @chmln \nI am having some issues getting an example setup, what does flatpickr use for formatting the date? That is to say, the formating tokens that are used, are not the same that are used by moment.js for example. Is there a plugin or something, that can convert the dateformat between the two?\n. @chmln Yes, I've seen that. I understand the tokens that you are using, but what did you base those on? Are those just created by you, or is there some standard that's followed? IE: YYYY-MM-DD in moment.js would need to be translated to Y-m-d for flatpickr, my app is using moment.js everywhere, so I need to juggle my date format for moment.js and flatpickr, and I am wondering if there is a plugin or something that does the conversion of formats between the two..

I was still including the old JS file (4.,4.7). I've updated that to the latest one, and it seems good now  \ud83d\udc4d . I finally worked out a solution to this. Instead of setting the minDate with:\nminDate: new Date(),\nIt seems this works better, as it still allows for the current day to be pre-selected:\nminDate: \"today\",\nSo problem solved :). Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I had to go back to just showing one month, as there seems to be some issues:\nhttps://ibb.co/7VPMWnW\n1) It shows the 1st of Dec as a Sunday - when if you look at the calendar in Windows, it shows Saturday is the 1st? \n2) The 29/30/31 all go weird and don't align under the days they are supposed to :/\nIts a shame - as that would have worked really well.

For anyone coming here in the future:\n\nThe issue is every time I go to localhost, with a iPhone6/7/8 device width screen, as a typical user would do, all my CSS and dark theme does not apply, it just shows the default flatpickr design calendar.\n\nI don't think that is the default flatpickr design. That looks like desktop Chrome's native datetime picker. Flatpickr changes to a <input type=\"date\"> on mobile and doesn't have an altInput. Notice your input box lacks the placeholder or red background. You can disable this behaviour if you want to always show flatpickr calendar by adding the option disableMobile: false https://flatpickr.js.org/options/.. This also applies to altFormat. On mobile, the altFormat is ignored.\nI was expecting on mobile the only difference would be to bring up the native picker rather than dropdown.\nie. still use the input=text but focus a hidden native HTML date/time field rather than drop down the calendar.\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature request. flatpickr still adds it's own input(native HTML date field rather than text field) on mobile so it's not disabled entirely. However, it seems to abort some presentational behaviour that's present on desktop which I would argue is unexpected and thus @Techn1x issue and mine.\nIf I have the time, I can try and build proof of concept.\n.

My hunch is that this isn't a Flatpickr issue so much as an issue with how we're using Flatpickr, but I haven't been able to nail down what's causing it yet. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f . @chmln \n\nAs opposed to? Which keys did you expect to navigate the calendar with?\n\nGreat question. My intuition says that this calendar drop down should have menu-esque controls (so down arrow, space, enter etc), but that doesn't really make sense. By default it's a forced interaction -- the calendar is thrown when the input is focused. The calendar itself is also far too complex to be considered one menu-item. \ud83d\ude15\nAnecdotally from my testing, when encountering a complex widget keyboard/screen reader user's expect to learn it's controls and capabilities on the fly. They also bring with them their experiences using similar components (or at least -- components that fulfill a similar user need).\nLooking at the aforementioned date picker component from Deque. You'll notice that the calendar is opt-in. The user by default can input the date or access the calendar via a second tab stop that is a button. Since it's a button we know we can throw the calendar with a space bar or perhaps the enter key. From here the keyboard user is left to experiment while the screen reader user is given a little more guidance. They are told (using Voice Over) that they have entered a table with seven columns and seven rows. So if they've interacted with tables on the web using a screen reader -- those commands suffice.\nObviously this is specific to their implementation, but it's good to set some base levels of expected usability and accessibility. I'm happy to brainstorm further solutions as well.\n\nCtrl+LeftArrow and Ctrl+RightArrow\n\nIs this affordance documented somewhere I can reference in the future? I can't seem to find any mention of these controls in either the repo's README or the documentation site, but I could totally be missing it. That said using ctrl-left/right arrow is problematic (though more so on macOS than Windows). Since those very same keyboard commands are used to cycle through your workspaces. This is a nuisance for me, but could be more frustrating to a keyboard user.\nI'm happy to open a separate ticket to discuss this if you think that's helpful.. I've separated out some of the discussion into two issues. When work on our end calms a little I'm super happy to help out with these. #1694 #1695\nThanks again!. @Kuzcoo testing the component in that pen -- seems to work as expected.

    "derblub": "I need exactly the same, probably as many others.\nI've checked the code and unfortunately, the plugin doesn't use the parseDateRules-function, as the disable-option from the core does, hence, it doesn't accept a function with the date-argument as parameter.\nAn update would be great!. @chmln Must have missed that config-options. That's great, thanks!. ",
    "Kuzcoo": "@chmln : Sorry, it seems to happen when I use it with \"appendTo\" config option, quite misleading title then :/\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/xBqqOG\n. @dakahn : we can type in to set the date manually, but can't use left and right arrows to edit some part of the date in the field. yes, using allowInput with appendTo. .

    "dpcreative": "Thanks for your quick reply, here is my fiddle:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gwmunaeb/5/\nOn line 11 is goes wrong cause first input value is deleted. Here I want to get the value of #homesearch_startDate_1 and set is as minDate of #homesearch_startDate_2. Note that input are dynamic so I cant set the next one value when the previous on changes. Sorry, I updated the link!. Nevermind, I think I made it too complicated for myself; I can just grab the date by $('#homesearch_startDate_1').val(); and use it in minDate\n. Thanks for your solution! That's also a good way to do it. The only thing Im still figuring out is to target the previous flatpickr and set a maxDate based on the new one  . I use another approach where I dont have an array of flatpickrs. I just add them to the new created elements. But what I actually want is to update the maxDate of $('#homesearch_startDate_1').flatpickr with the value of $('#homesearch_startDate_2').flatpickr when I change the latter. You think that's possible? . ",
    "Mina-R-Meshriky": "well, I am not good at javascript, so my work around was to make a disabled textarea where it is updated from the onChange() methods each time a choice is made.\nthen create a wrap containing an icon (toggle action) and an input\nmy problem now is that I can't get the text input in the wrap to disappear even if I made it of type hidden.\nSo I think if you add an option to enable/disable the input visibility state and make the calendar appear on the element where it is instantiated (an icon perhaps and not necessary on the input) the problem can be solved.. well, I have changed my view to have an inline calendar and the textarea and hide the input using css\nhtml\n<div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-md-7 date_time_picker d-none\"></div>\n     <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n          <textarea style=\"width: 100%;height: 100%\" id=\"excludedDates\" disabled></textarea>\n     </div>\n</div>\njavascript\n$(\".date_time_picker\").flatpickr({\n            mode: \"multiple\",\n            altInput: true,\n            dateFormat: \"Y-m-d\",\n            altFormat: \"d-m-Y\",\n            conjunction: \" , \",\n            inline: true,\n            onChange(selectedDates, dateStr, instance) {\n                $('#excludedDates').html(instance.altInput.value);\n            },\n        });\n\n.

    "zerkalica": "Maybe this is unnecessary. I think that triggerChange === false must disable all events triggering. Why only onChange?\nTriggering any events in setDate may cause bugs in react-flatpickr componentDidMount\njs\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    ...\n    if (this.props.hasOwnProperty('value')) {\n      this.flatpickr.setDate(this.props.value, false)\n    }\n}\n. Really?\njs\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <FlatPickr value={this.props.value} options={{\n        onValueUpdate(value) {\n            // change app state and rerender myComponent\n        }\n    }} />\n  }\n}\nFlatPickr.componentDidMount -> setDate -> trigger onValueUpdate -> set app state -> FlatPickr.componentDidMount\n. It's only potentially bug. What if some dummy programmer reproduce this situation in application code? If you think that it's not important, i'll remove it.. ",
