    "mmistakes": "@losalamosal If you comment out the url variable in your _config.yml all should be well when working locally. I use absolute URLs in the theme, so it's probably pulling from whatever you set as your base url and that's why it's pointing to the pages served on GitHub. Just make sure to uncomment it when you push to GitHub or else you'll have all kinds of broken links.\nI originally had all the links relative but there are so many headaches with that and Jekyll, so I went the absolute route. If you start adding categories and doing deep linking sometimes the CSS and JS files didn't load probably with a relative URL along with image assets. If you're keeping things nice and simple it's easy enough to just strip out all the {{ site.url }} references in the _includes and _layouts.\nLet me know if this helps.\n. @ozank I think you're on the right track. Remove the {% include author-bio.html %} like you did, and then beef up the margin-left on the #index div to make up for the missing space that the author bio sidebar was occupying. If you make it 25% like below you should be golden.\n``` css\n@media only screen and (min-width: 37.5em)\nindex {\ndisplay: inline;\nfloat: left;\nwidth: 50%;\nmargin-left: 25%; /* change from 0% to 25% */\nmargin-right: 0%;\n\n}\n``\n. @stanstrup The source files are all in/_sass/, you'll probably find what you need in the [page.scss](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/page.scss) partial.\n. The#indexdeclarations are all around [line 248](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/page.scss#L248). The media query mixins are probably what are tripping you up. Because the theme is responsive the column widths change depending on the screen size. Depending on where you placemargin-left: 25%;` will have different results.\nYou'll probably want to add it here so it pushes the main column over on larger screens only since on mobile the theme defaults to a single tube of content.\n@media #{$x-large} {\n    @include grid(12,4.5);\n    margin-left: 25%;\n}\nThe smarter thing would be to use the prefix mixin to pad the left and fill the space originally occupied by the author sidebar.\n@media #{$x-large} {\n    @include grid(12,4.5);\n    @include prefix(12,3); // adds 3 columns of blank space to the left\n}\n. @stanstrup For the most part Sass is CSS, it just has a few tricks up its sleeve like nesting, variables, and mixins to augment things. The basics are documented here if you're interested.\n. @bcg Which preprocessors did you try? I've used CodeKit for OS X and WinLess for Windows, and they appear to compile just fine. There's probably a missing ; or } in one of the LESS files and it's causing the preprocessor to puke. \nDid you get any sort of error message that indicated the problem LESS file or line? That would help in pinpointing the issue.\n. I'm using an older version of CodeKit, so that's why I didn't notice the error.\nThe problem is Typeplate, they used some funky strict math that causes problems with newer versions of Less. They stopped doing a Less version and I have no idea how all their crazy mixins work, so I won't be able to fix it.\nTheir appears to be an option to disable strict math on specific .less files that might help. I stopped using Typeplate for my newer Jekyll themes, and simplified the typography greatly. That's something I want to do with Minimal Mistakes, I just need to find the time.\n. @bcg Ok I had a few minutes to refactor a few things. Check the 1.1.1 release I just pushed and let me know if everything is peachy now. I took out Typeplate and cleaned up a few other things as well.\n. @danielpassos What exactly doesn't work in regards to site.categories.articles? Does it not list any posts? The way it's setup in the theme is it will only show posts tagged with the category: articles in their YAML head.\nAnd for setting the url. I decided to go with an absolute urls because I had issues with different permalink setups. You pretty much have to set a url for my theme because I use {{ site.url }} in  a few places for links to resolve correctly, especially in the atom feed and sitemap, where absolute links are needed.\nWhen working locally I usually set the url to http://localhost:4000 (or whatever your server is) and then all the home links work. I put that note in the docs to comment it out just because it's easier, but you'd be surprised how many questions I get about broken links or the stylesheets not loading properly because it wasn't set properly.\n. You can use whatever taxonomy you want for categories, I went with articles because I wanted a permalink structure that was something like \\articles\\post-title. If you wanted to do category pages other than articles it's entirely possible but takes some work. If you're hosting with GH Pages you have to get creative with Liquid and manually create a category index page for each category or tag you want to link to. \nThe easier method is using a Jekyll plugin that generates these pages for you automatically at build. But that won't fly with GH Pages since they disallow plugins.\nIn theory / should always go to the root, but in my experience it caused some issues with sites that were in subfolders or if you used GitHub projects instead of pages. I think it's since been fixed in Jekyll with baseurl but I haven't had time to investigate that. I've just always gotten into the habit of using {{ site.url }} for every link just to play it safe. It's more work up front but less of a headache later.\n. @techbirds Looks like a dependency issue with your setup and not related to the theme.\nAre you on Windows 7 per chance? I've gotten similar errors. The latest version of Pygments (used for syntax highlighting) barfs up this error when trying to parse posts. The solution I've found is to rollback to an older version of Pygments. You could try this or just Google the error. There are a bunch of fixes on Stackoverflow.\ngem uninstall pygments.rb --version \"=0.5.1\"\ngem install pygments.rb --version \"=0.5.0\"\n. Are you using Jekyll on a Windows machine? If so here's a few more things to try. I'm fairly confident it's your setup and not my theme.\nhttp://www.madhur.co.in/blog/2011/09/01/runningjekyllwindows.html\n. The theme doesn't support it out of the box. You'll have to make some adjustments to _layout files to do it. See my other theme that does support post index pagination for some ideas.\n. @vohof That readme you linked to isn't for this theme. The Minimal Mistakes theme has never had Disqus commenting. It's easy enough to add if you want it, just see what I did in either my HPSTR or So Simple themes.\n. Thanks for the suggestion @DonaldIsFreak. I'm all for adding pagination, but am stuck on how to avoid some hard coding and making it overly complicated for the user.\nTo make pagination work on articles/index.html, paginate_path has to be set to something like articles/page:num in _config.yml. As far as I can tell that limits it to just paginating the articles category and if you have additional category index pages you want to paginate, you can't.\nI included pagination on my other theme HPSTR, but only use it on the home page which is much easier to control and doesn't require any modifications to the theme if the user customizes category page names.\nThoughts?\n. Thanks for the PR @denolfe \n. Good catch @rmzelle. Thanks!\n. Not at all. Glad to fix things that make sense fixing.\n. I have no idea what a .nojekyll file is or does so I would say no, you don't need it.\nI host all of my themes on GitHub using the gh-pages like you are and have never included one.\nWhat exactly isn't working for you when you push to GitHub? Does the site look messed up? Is not updating? Are you getting any sort of error notifications emailed to you from GitHub after pushing your commits? They're usually pretty good about letting you know if something failed.\nThe only thing I noticed in your repo was in _config.yml, you'll want to uncomment url:              http://augusto-garcia.github.io/statgen.esalq so all the css and js loads properly.\n. Thanks for clearing up what a .no-jekyll file is for @jasonhodges.\nAs I suspected @augusto-garcia, dump the .no-jekyll file from your repo, set the url in _config.yml and report back if that doesn't work.\n. Does it give any specifics on what is causing the page build fail? Unless I'm missing something obvious I don't think it's anything in your repo. It's pretty much the same thing I host on GH for the theme demo with a few of your text modifications and url.\nI thought maybe there's something goofy in your MarkDown or Liquid that is causing the fail, but since it builds locally I don't think the problem lies with the theme or the modifications you made. Worst case if you didn't have the correct url: set in _config.yml, the site would load but it would be missing the correct layout and styling.\nTo rule out the modifications you made as the culprit what happens if you try to publish the Minimal Mistakes gh-pages branch as is and then browse to  http://augusto-garcia.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\nOr maybe GH doesn't like your repo's name with the \".\"?\nI know there are some specific ways you have to have repos named and structured depending on how you host (ie: user vs org vs project pages).\n. 2) Updating the url will fix the layout.\nThere's probably a bad Liquid tag if you changed anything with the _layouts\nor _includes. Otherwise it's probably something screwy in one of your posts\nor pages that the Markdown parser doesn't like.\nOn Wednesday, March 5, 2014, Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\n1) deleted the old repo with a dot in the name (statgen.esalq), started a\nnew one named statgen.\ngh-pages, etc, following the instructions, still having the same problem:\n\"Your page is having problems building: Page build failed.\"\n2) cloned minimal mistakes and uploaded it to my own minimal-mistakes\nrepo.

Hmmm, this is a strange one. I want to say it's related to the webfont not loading, but if that was the case it should fallback to a Georgia, and if that's not present a system serif.\nI know Chrome has a bug with webfonts that are used for icons, but I think something else is going on here.\n. Ok I just fired up the demo site for the theme and noticed it, but now it seems to be ok. It seemed like it was a hiccup with GitHub pages maybe because a couple other assets on the page didn't load.\nIt's also possible the Google AdSense script in the footer is causing a ruckus and delaying the loading of the webfont and other things.\n. Just for giggles do the fonts render correctly on this page?\nhttps://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Serif\nIf they don't then it's a Google issue for sure. If they do then I would try and remove the webfont references in the CSS and see if the text shows up.\nYou'll want to change to do something like:\ncss\nbody {\n  font-family: serif;\n}\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n}\nIf that works then something is conflicting the Google webfont script.\n. Yeah the icons are definitely a Chrome bug that's been around for a bit.\nFor whatever reason those icon webfonts don't always show.\nI'm out of ideas for text disappearing.

If I remember correctly, the only place the email address is used is in the <author> block in the site feed. One of those things that could probably be optional. At one point I think I had it in the sidebar, but maybe that was another one of my themes... they all kind of blend together at this point.\n\nI'll probably rethink the sidebar and strip out a lot of those social network variables eventually and just let people customize and add what they want. It's kind of silly for me to put in what I think are the most popular ones when it's easy enough to add a line of HTML to personalize it yourself.\nAs for including your email address and getting spammed. There are JavaScript tricks you can use that help keep the bots from harvesting your email addy from the HTML. I have my personal site cached with Cloudflare and it does that automatically.\n. Not sure of a work around. I don't use Heroku so I'll be of little help. Sounds more of a Jekyll issue than my theme.\n. @maxheld83 Didn't think it made sense to include the complete post in the indexes. I personally think your content should take priority and it seemed weird calling out a link more than the others.\nInstead I added a link icon next to the title. It solves 2 problems. The title links to the post on your site, the link goes to the source page your're referencing.\nI made this change on the home page because it was missing in your commit. Thanks for the pull requests!\n. I previously included a sample category index page but took it out to simplify things (or maybe that was one of my other themes). There are Jekyll plugins that do it automatically which is way more elegant than what I'm going to propose below.\nLet's say we want to create a category page for research that will include all posts in category. You would:\n1. Create a new page research.md and give it a layout of page.\n2. Edit research.md and wrap your post index HTML in the following for statement which will only pull in posts from the category you specify {% for post in site.categories.research%} --layout here--{% endfor %}\n3. Repeat this process for each category page you want to create.\nThis process sucks if you have a lot of categories since you have to do it manually. A Jekyll plugin will save you this work but if you're hosting on GH then plugins aren't an option.\nI use this method to build some category based pages on my personal site if you want to dig around in that repo for ideas.\nThere's probably some liquid magic that could be worked to make this method even more fool proof by dynamically pulling in category names into the for statement. But for my purposes I didn't need to take it that far.\nI haven't tested this, but this is what your research.md might look like\n```\nlayout: page\n\n{{ page.title }}\n  {% for post in site.posts.categories.research %}  \n  {% unless post.next %}\n    {{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}\n    {% else %}\n      {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n      {% capture nyear %}{{ post.next.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n      {% if year != nyear %}\n        {{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}\n      {% endif %}\n    {% endunless %}\n    \n      {% if post.link %}\n        {{ post.title }} \n      {% else %}\n        {{ post.title }}\n{% if post.description %}{{ post.description }}{% else %}{{ post.content | strip_html | strip_newlines | truncate: 120 }}{% endif %}\n      {% endif %}\n    \n  {% endfor %}\n\n /#index \n```\n. Yup that's pretty much it. I tried your PR locally and didn't really see it do much other than add a new post to the top.\nThe method I detailed above I think gives you want you want, which is a page with just a list of posts limited to a specific category.\nThe other benefit to this method is you can change up the layout for different categories. For example on my site the articles page is a simple list of posts. While my work page has thumbnails and a different presentation.\nAlso, you can probably create an _include with the base post index layout and stick that in between your for loop so you're not duplicating the same code on multiple pages.\n. I'm not even sure if this is the best way to do it, but it seems like a\npopular method. Ideally there would be some logic to do this dynamically\nbut for most cases creating a few pages manually is no big deal.\nAnd yes, I don't think you need a PR. I took this out for a reason because\nit was confusing most people using the theme. I got a lot of questions\nabout it so I figured if someone wants it they can investigate the solution\nand bolt it on them self.\nIt's a balancing act. I've tried to put in common things and leave the rest\nto personal customization.\nOn Thu, Mar 27, 2014 at 11:40 AM, Maximilian Held\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\nmakes sense. Thanks so much -- I'm learning a lot.\nDifferent layouts are important, indeed -- didn't realize that this could\nbe better accomplished this way.\nGuess there's no need for another PR with the new approach, because\nwhoever likes it can just implement that him/herself, correct?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/44#issuecomment-38820172\n.\n. Padding is off because there isn't a short description for the link post. I'll address it at some point.\n. Localizing themes is kind of a pain. I've had a few folks fork mine and\nthen localize everything into their native language. There really is no\neasy way to make one theme support all languages without over complicating\nthe whole thing.\n\nI've seen Jekyll plugins that help with this, but that's really not an\noption for because of the whole keep it compatible with GitHub pages.\nProbably best to just leave this sort of thing out and up to the developer.\nThat was always my vision. More of a \"make it your own\" than a theme that\ndoes everything for everyone.\n. Things gets even trickier when you factor in date format differences between various languages and interface things that need to change too. I really don't know if there is a way to do it without going crazy with Liquid if statements and for loops.\nThe only other way I've seen it done is using categories to help filter out posts. That's what Development Seed did on the content portion of HealthCare.gov\nSupport for collections might help be an option when that hits prime time, but I'm thinking some of this needs to be baked into the core of Jekyll to really do it right.\n. Just remove the following bottom margins and all will be well on your site.\n``` css\nindex article h2.link-post {\nmargin-bottom: 26px;\nmargin-bottom: 1.625rem;\n\n}\n```\nI didn't include a description for the link post sample in my repo because that seemed like overkill, and since there wasn't a paragraph below it the next post title bumped into it. To keep the vertical rhythm I added the bottom margin.\n. Not sure what sort of styling you're looking for on the bio, but if you wanted it to follow something closer to what is on the homepage you could use the same CSS as what's being applied to the #index element.\nEasiest way to do that would be to add the #about-me selector to #index like so to page.less\nIf you're not comfortable with less then you could do the same to main.min.css, you'll just need to apply #about-me to all of the #index selectors. I think there are 3 or so for the various page width breakpoints.\n``` css\nindex,\nabout-me {\n.container();\n.grid(12,10);\n.prefix(12,1);\n.suffix(12,1);\nmargin-bottom: 2em;\n@media @600px {\n    .grid(12,6);\n    .prefix(12,0);\n    .suffix(12,0);\n}\n@media @1382px {\n    .grid(12,4.5);\n}\nh3 {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding-bottom: .5em;\n    .font-rem(28);\n    border-bottom: 1px solid lighten(@black,70);\n}\narticle {\n    h2 {\n        margin-bottom: 4px;\n        .font-rem(20);\n        &.link-post {\n            margin-bottom: 0px + @doc-line-height;\n            margin-bottom: 0rem + (@doc-line-height / @doc-font-size);\n        }\n    }\n    p {\n        .font-rem(14);\n    }\n    p+p {\n        text-indent: 0;\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nMaking this small change will give you something like the following. If you want to further style it you can just apply the appropriate styles to #about-me\n\n. It would probably be easier to just move the about me content within #index. I noticed some weird floats and wrapping going on otherwise and if you're not comfortable with doing a bunch of CSS it might be a pain to sort out.\nAnd for the dotted links you can just take the styles from .article-wrap p>a and apply them to #about-me or #index depending on if you move the content or not.\nPersonally I would move the about me h2, and paragraphs under <div id=\"index\"> before the recent posts, and then add something like this for the dotted line links:\n``` css\nindex p>a {\nborder-bottom: 1px dotted #b3b3b3;\n}\n```\nYou'll probably need to add the hover style for the links too.\n. I couldn't isolate the problem file but I get all kinds of Liquid errors when I try to run your repo locally. Usually when I encounter that with Jekyll it's because a character isn't encoded properly in one of my MarkDown files and Jekyll pukes on it, or there's bad YAML front matter in a post/page.\nI see that you're trying to assign multiple categories to a few posts. That could be the problem too since Jekyll might be trying to assign both to the url as specified in the permalink structure. I've personally never tried doing multiple categories this way so no idea how Jekyll typically supports it.\nI assign a category as a bucket to stick posts in for navigation purposes and then use tags for more specific classification. Other than trying to remove the multiple categories and stick with one the only other things I can think of:\n1. You have some bad YAML in one of your posts or pages, possibly an encoding problem?\n2. Having tags and categories named the same ie blog might be causing something to get confused and mucked up.\n. Think I might have found a partial solution. If you assign multiple categories to a post it has to read categories: [cat1, cat2] in the YAML front matter and not category: [cat1, cat2]. categories: seems to work for one or multiple categories so you could probably swap all instances of category to categories in the YAML and be ok.\nEven with that fix it might not meet your needs though. I'm taking a guess here but if you had a post named 2014-04-30-test-post.md with categories: [blog, cat2], you're looking for it to render a post in \\blog\\ and \\cat2\\. Problem is Jekyll doesn't do that with the current permalink structure defined in _config.yml.\nInstead it looks like it nests each category in the order you assign them in the YAML. ie: _site\\blog\\cat2\\test-post\\index.html.\nIf you really want to classify posts into multiple categories a way to do if you didn't care about permalinks that are easily browseable would be to alter the structure in _config.yml. I'd start by changing it permalink: /:title/ to remove the categories from the URL. It'll flatten the hierachy and put everything in root, but then you can build category index pages for each and just pull in posts assigned for it with something like:\nhtml\n<ul class=\"post-list\">\n<!--list posts with blog category only -->\n{% for post in site.categories.blog %} \n  <li><article><a href=\"{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}\">{{ post.title }} <span class=\"entry-date\"><time datetime=\"{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}\">{{ post.date | date: \"%B %d, %Y\" }}</time></span></a></article></li>\n{% endfor %}\n</ul>\n. Correct link is http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/ until I get around to fixing it.\n. @ryan-p-randall I would upgrade exactly how @yihangho suggested. If for some reason you didn't fork the original repo you can follow these steps to do the same thing. You could of course just go through the commit history and copy/paste the changes depending on how minor they are, but pulling them in via Git and resolving conflicts is probably a better strategy.\n1. Create a new branch from master git checkout -b new-branch master\n2. Pull in commits from the Minimal Mistakes theme repo git pull https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\n3. Resolve any conflicts and commit.\n4. You'll probably have to remove the sample posts again because Git will most likely pull them in from the MM repo.\nHope this helps.\n. I think I'd prefer to keep things as they are just so it's simpler and remains as backwards compatibility as it can. Most people using the theme aren't web dev savy and they have problems enough just getting their \"blog\" going with Jekyll.\nI'm currently  working on a starter theme/framework that uses more of the newer stuff added to Jekyll like collections and Sass support that would probably be a better place to incorporate data files for configs.\nYou'd be surprised how many times I get asked the same question about why the MM theme (or any of my other ones) don't work all because they never bothered to change the variables in _config.yml. :wink: \n. Yup. This came up in my other themes after I changed some permalinks and didn't update the Readme.\n. The gemfiles maybe. There might be one or two that aren't in the default Jekyll install, I'll have to double check. I've had users complain about Kramdown and some of the others not working prior to Jekyll 2.0 so I went the gemfile route to make sure everything is there by doing encouraging running bundle install.\nJust another case of me trying to mitigate Jekyll issues that are often mis-diagnosed as \"theme\" issues that I spend a lot of time responding to.\nReadme and license are part of the theme. Going to leave those in.\n. You're absolutely correct. I probably should have looked at the commit in your PR before jumping to conclusions. Oops.\n. Maybe someday... but I wouldn't hold your breath. For the most part I've moved on from these themes. From the start I was more concerned with building something for myself and just opensourced them for the curious to use as is or learn from.\nI'd much rather maintain them so they continue to work with new versions of Jekyll vs. adding new features. I'm selfish with my time like :wink: \nThat said. Maybe the new Jekyll starter I'm building for myself might be of interest to you... once I finish it.\n. Sounds like you need to compile the .less files into .css for the change to take effect. Here's roughly what you need to do:\n1. Change the Google font script in the _includes/_head.html from <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=PT+Sans+Narrow:400,700|PT+Serif:400,700,400italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'> to whatever new embed Google gives you upon selecting the fonts you want to use\n2. Update the font-family variables in variables.less to match the names Google uses (sounds like you've done this already).\n3. Compile the .less files into a new css/main.min.css stylesheet. I provided Grunt.js tasks to do this for you so just check the theme documentation on how to install Node, required modules (if you haven't already), and the commands to run Grunt.\nHope this helps.\n. Sorry I don't have much experience with Linux. Looks like you don't have\nNode installed from the errors.

The * selector targets every element on the page. I wouldn't do that because it's unnecessary. The easiest solution is to work with the .less files I provided. You change the font in one place and it updates everywhere.\n\nSince you're having problems getting Node and Grunt installed on Linux you could just modify the main.min.css stylesheet instead. That's what the less files compile into. It's just harder to read because it's minified to reduce filesize. And you'll have to update the font-family declarations in numerous locations. Which can be tricky if you have no idea what you're looking at or where to look.\nIf you're going to modify the main.min.css file I'd look at CSS Beautify. Copy/paste the css into that site and it will spit out a nicely formatted stylesheet that you can read easily.\nOther than me teaching you how to write CSS I think that's about all I can offer :wink: \nPS: If I remember correctly the majority of the serif font (PT Serif) is applied to the body element. And the sans-serif font is applied to the headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, etc). If you use something like Chrome or Firefox's dev tools you can right click on an element you want to change and inspect it. Then it will show you exactly what lines in main.min.css are applying what styles so you can change them to whatever you want.\nHope this helps!\n. Do you have the code somewhere I can look at to diagnose what's going on? An image is an image. The feature image will pull in whatever you specify, just as long as it's in the images folder. I can't remember if I made the theme with externally linked images or not.\nIt also has some CSS applied to the image wrap to stretch it to fill the screen 100%. So depending on the size of the original it could look fuzzy if it's upscaling it a bunch. The ideal proportions are longer rather than tall, otherwise you might get some screwy results when the CSS stretches everything.\n. Appreciate the PR but I don't think that I'm will merge it in. My taste is more minimal and simple and to keep primary navigations clean and free from distracting elements like small icons :wink: \nMaking it something you can toggle on/off from _config.yml is a good idea but I think less is more in this case. At some point I really want to go back and clean up these themes further because there really is a lot of Liquid bloat in a few places where I tried to include too many options. It's a balance I'm trying to strike between those who are comfortable mucking with the layouts and CSS and those who want an easy way to customize everything without looking at the code. Hah.\nAnd about iconmoon. You've just reminded me that I probably should swap out the custom build I'm using to Font Awesome instead. Will give more options for those who want to use alternative icons other than the limited set of social networking ones I've included. I'm doing this with my newer starter theme Skinny Bones...\n. It's been a while since I tried using Coderay. I believe you need to switch from Pygments to Coderay under the Kramdown settings in _config.yml.\nAlso I don't think GitHub Pages support Coderay. It appears it's either Pygments or Rouge.\nhttp://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#highlighting-code-snippets\n. Looks like your _config.yml might be the culprit. Looking at what you posted above the server address is http://0.0.0.0:4000http://lwasser.github.io/minimal-mistakes which is obviously wrong.\nWhen working locally dump what you currently have there and try this instead:\nyaml\nurl: http://localhost:4000\nbaseurl:\nFrom what I can tell you don't need to set anything for baseurl. You're essentially setting the same url twice which is breaking everything.\n. And the other errors are related to the Pygments gem. It can be a bitch getting everything running properly on a Windows machine. Newer versions of Pygments don't play nice. Same deal with Ruby. You'd be better off searching around StackOverflow because these issues are quite common.\n. This is a pretty good guide for installing Jekyll on Windows and it has some tips on getting Pygments working. http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/3-syntax-highlighting/\n. Thanks for the PR.\n. No worries.\n. Thanks for the PR @soxyl \n. Oops. I forgot to update the documentation when I upgraded the theme to support Jekyll 2.\nThe theme is no longer using .less files for the stylesheets when I converted them to Sass since Jekyll added native support. If you want to modify the look and feel of the Pygments syntax highlighting the file pygments.scss is located in the _sass folder with all the other partials. \nJust make your edits and Jekyll will compile it for you. No need for the Grunt task I mentioned in the old docs.\nOtherwise you don't have to do anything but make sure the Pygments.rb gem installs properly with Jekyll. The Jekyll docs on their site have more info on getting started with Pygments.\n. Fenced codeblocks won't invoke Pygments styled syntax highlighting.\nTo get the \"pretty\" Pygments highlighting you need to wrap your code in dedicated Liquid tags. Check out the official Jekyll docs, they explain exactly how to do it.\n{% highlight %}\nyour code\n{% endhighlight %}\n. Take a look at the width styles applied to #main article. It's declared a few times at various break points to resize depending on screen width, so you'll want to keep that in mind if you make it wider.\n. No you can't edit main.css directly, it's generated by main.scss and all the partials in _sass by Jekyll. Above I'm assigning a bunch of mixins from the grid partial. If you browse through grid.scss it's commented out and explains the mixins.\nBasically I'm using a 12 column grid. @include grid(12,10) means make article 10 columns wide out of 12. The prefix mixin adds columns before and suffix adds them after. To modify the width of article you'll need to adjust those numbers making sure everything adds up to 12 or else the layout will break.\nThe @media #{$small} lines are media query mixins to declare properties (mostly container widths) for the various screen sizes. Small is roughly mobile screens, medium = tablets, large = desktop, etc etc.\n. Changing $def_grid probably won't help. All it's going to do is change the math slightly.\nYou need to play with the grid mixins found in grid.scss. They're all documented if you look at the comments for some guidance. Basically what's going on is with the grid(x, x) mixin it's saying make the element you apply it to x amount of columns wide.\ngrid(12,10) means 10 columns of 12 (12 being the same amount of columns as $def_grid) which is a width of about 83.33333%. 12,12 would be 100%. The mixin isn't doing much other than to do some quick math to output the widths in percentages.\nThere's also some media queries mixed in there to change the amount of columns #main .post and #main .page span depending on the screen sizes. I'm guessing you want to make it wider on desktop screens. So you'll need to play with the grid mixin values at the large and x-large breakpoints.\nYou'll see below it goes from 10 columns on mobile to 6 columns, to 5 columns at the largest screen size. I did this to make the typographic measure shorter since long lines of text are harder for the eye to track and read.\n``` scss\nmain {\ncounter-reset: captions;\n@include container;\n@include clearfix;\nclear: both;\nmargin-top: 2em;\nh1 {\n    margin-top: 0;\n}\n.post,\n.page {\n    @include container;\n    @include grid(12,10);\n    @include prefix(12,1);\n    @include suffix(12,1);\n    margin-bottom: 2em;\n    @media #{$small} {\n        @include grid(12,8);\n        @include prefix(12,0);\n        @include suffix(12,0);\n    }\n    @media #{$large} {\n    @include grid(12,6); // increase 6 if you want to make it wider\n    }\n    @media #{$x-large} {\n        @include grid(12,5); // increase 5 if you want to make it wider\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nThe prefix and suffix mixins apply margin before and after to simulate a gutter. They work similar to the other mixin. The first value is the base grid (eg. 12 columns), the second is how many columns.\nprefix(12,0) would remove any margin to the left, prefix(12,1) would add a column of margin before, 12,2 would add 2 columns, etc. etc. etc.\n. I just did a quick test with the grid changes you made and it sort of works, but is 1 column too wide so things stack weird.\nIf you decrease by one like so:\nscss\n...\n        @media #{$large} {\n        @include grid(12,9);\n        }\n        @media #{$x-large} {\n            @include grid(12,8);\n        }\nYou'll get this. I would probably knock it down another value and add @include suffix(12,1); to apply some white space on the right so the text isn't hitting the scrollbar.\n\nThe fact that your CSS isn't changing tells me you probably have url: in your _config.yml set to your production site. When working locally you'll need to leave that blank or change to url: http:localhost:4000 to use the local CSS. All asset links in the theme are absolute and it's likely pulling the one from your prod site instead... which is why you're not seeing any changes.\nBe sure to restart the Jekyll server after making any _config.yml changes since those aren't watched automatically.\nAnother thing I'd suggest is firing up your browser's web developer tools. Once enabled you'll be able to right click any element and inspect it's CSS properties. You can also tinker with the declarations in real time to figure out what changes you might want to make.\nThe line numbers won't match up exactly but should give you a good idea on what classes or elements you need to target to get things laid out how you'd like.\nPS: I'm working on a complete rewrite of the theme which should make customizing things a bit easier. I was never happy with the column placement on the current version. You're not the first person to run into problems trying to widen the main content container or shift things around. Probably won't launch for a bit but I'm getting closer as I build out the documentation.\n. @adityaatluri https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1373. No, it can't be done by just altering those variables. You need to remove the right margin just how I have it in that other issue linked above.\nOverriding the CSS is the only way to widen the page how you want.. Override these colors.. The theme is responsive and does partially do what you want. If you look at this test page with some images I have classes for doing 2 images side by side or 3 side by side. For mobile and smaller screens they squish down into a single tube of content.\nI am using a variation of the Semantic grid system (converted from Less to Sass), but it isn't anything like Boostrap or Foundation where you apply classes directly in the HTML. Instead I'm using Sass mixins to define an element's width in columns, prefix or append space around them, or push/pull them across the grid in the stylesheet to keep the markup cleaner and semantic. I'm not a big fan of gunking it up with stuff like <div class=\"span-4\"></div> if I don't have to.\nIf you take a look in grid.scss you can read through the mixins that are partially documented. And if you look in page.scss you'll see how I use them as Sass includes along with some media query mixins to adjust for various screen sizes.\nHope this helps.\n. Any particular reason you want to use https instead of http when hosting on GitHub pages? It should work just fine with http as the site URL. From my understanding there are a few gotchas (cross origin scripts and assets, etc) if you decide to use https hosted pages on GH, which could be why you're having issues. I don't think it has anything to do with the theme.\nThe real problem is mixing https requests in with a domain that is on http. That's why Firefox is barfing up warnings for you. You probbaly have links and or images in your posts or pages that are https. That's a security issues as far as the browsers are concerned.\n. If you make your url in _config.yml //yourdomain.com you shouldn't have to modify the theme at all.\nThe only place you might run into issues are in the Atom feed. I'm not sure how well protocol less domains are supported by most feed readers so some content might not show up. The same can be said for https. \nhttp vs https is dicey area with a lot of gotchas that I don't feel like supporting or dealing with. I prefer to make the theme simple and work 99.9% of the time instead of catering to every possible scenario. Which is why I went with http and leave it up to the end user to fork and do what they want with the code.\nMost are using Jekyll to host a blog made up of simple static files. https in my opinion is overkill in this case unless you have forms and are actually transmitting data back and fourth that needs encryption.\n. I get all that @emory and it makes a ton of sense to someone who understands how this stuff works. Agreed that it's fairly easy to implement 99.9% of the time. It's that .01% that causes me headaches.\nIntroduce a few best practices, keep things as simple as possible, and leave it up to the user to fork and do as they please has always been my view. A good majority of those using the themes still can't set site.url properly, and trying to explain the benefits of http:// vs. https:// vs. // is something I want to avoid at all costs. :wink: \n. Check your post and page YAML. It's probably in the wrong format in one of your posts or pages. Needs to be YYYY-MM-DD\nDo you have a link to the problem repo?\n. It's not the filename that's causing the problem, Jekyll would barf on that right away. In one of your post's or page's in the YAML front matter you can also set date: and modified: for the dates that are used in the \"published on\" line. If the format is wrong there the Liquid filter for converting the date into XML schema will fail.\nLook through each of your posts and pages and make sure you're using the correct date format in the YAML front matter.\n. Without a link to some code or a repo I really can't troubleshoot it further. In my experience the only time I've seen this error was from dates being set in the wrong format. Or maybe you have a Ruby gem that is out of date and needs updating.\n. Smells like a problem with the browser rendering the Font Awesome webfont.

Font Awesome has this on their website regarding Ad Block. \n\nApparently, Adblock Plus can remove Font Awesome brand icons with their \"Remove Social Media Buttons\" setting. We will not use hacks to force them to display. Please report an issue with Adblock Plus if you believe this to be an error. To work around this, you'll need to modify the social icon class names.\n. No you don't. The Octopress gem is optional and only used for creating new posts and pages with some of the YAML post matter filled out. It's for those people who want to automate the process instead of manually adding all that data. \n. I don't think there is anything that can be done to make it validate. It's not technically in the spec which is why the W3C validator is failing on it. But it's common sense to include it and doesn't hurt anything.\n. First try npm install to make sure you have all the updated node modules installed. Report back if you get any errors there.\nLooks to me that the errors you're getting are related to the Grunt imagemin plugin used to optimize images. I've had a ton of problems with it in the past installing on various computers (both Mac and PC). I've used alternates and have switched back and forth numerous times because of things breaking. The big issue I've encountered is it barfing on installing some image libraries it needs to do it's thing (e.g. gifsicle).\nSince you just want to use Grunt to build your JavaScript file I'd suggest adding a task to Gruntfile.js to do just that. If you add this after the other two (default and watch) you should be good to go.\ngrunt.registerTask('scripts', [\n    'clean',\n    'uglify',\n  ]);\nRunning grunt scripts would just execute this task (combining the scripts and uglifying).\nLet me know how it goes.\n. As expected imagemin is causing a ruckus, but since you have that cleared up the fact that Bigfoot isn't working probably has to do with script errors.\nI've never used the plugin myself so I can't say for sure. But first thing I would do is look at the page, open the browser's web dev tools and check the console for any script conflict.\nChances are when bigfoot.js was combined and minified with the other scripts it broke something. This happens all the time depending on how well a jQuery plugin is written. If that's the case then you might need to include it as it's own http request to avoid conflicts.\nIf there are no script errors then maybe you didn't initialize bigfoot using $.bigfoot(); as noted in their docs? If that's not the problem then you'll have to take it up with the plugin developer because other than the obvious I have zero clue what's up.\n. I do not.\n. The theme is using the Classic Google Analytics script. What you included above is the new Universal one that everyone should eventually move to.\nI didn't update it to avoid breaking things for those who haven't turned it on yet in GA.\nJust update your copy of _scripts.html to match the new Universal script and you should be fine.\n. Not sure I'm following. Can you provide a screenshot exactly where the spacing differences are?\nThere are margins and padding on headlines and the feature image blocks. If you don't have a feature image that would explain why the spacing is off.\n. In that case you can apply a margin-top: 0; to the h1 element and it should be flush with the top of the sidebar. Then add some margin-bottom to the nav if you want more space between the two.\n. @namebrandon Attach a screenshot and indicate which area you're talking about. I'm still not entirely sure we're all talking about the same thing. Sidebar jumping around could me a lot of things.\nAs stated a few comments above, there is some margin on the top of each headline element. If you zero that out it will be flush with the top of the sidebar's top.\nThere also is some margin-bottom applied to the .image-wrap that contains the feature image. If you don't have a feature image on a page/post that extra margin won't exist and the main content and sidebar will obviously jump up higher on the page.\nWhen in doubt fire up Chrome/Safari's web developer tools or Firebug in Firefox and start inspecting elements. It'll show you the CSS being applied and you can play around with edits to figure out where the extra margin and padding is coming from.\n. I see the problem. The post and page layouts both wrap the main content and sidebar with <div id=\"main\" role=\"main\">, which has a margin-top: 1em;. The post-index.html layout doesn't have the #main wrapper so the 1em of extra space isn't there.\nWrapping the sidebar and index content with <div id=\"main\" role=\"main\"> won't solve the problem directly because a bunch of other styles are introduced that screw with the post list. I never noticed it because I used images up top. Maybe someday I'll get around to fixing that but for now you'll have to get creative.\n. That probably won't work all that great because the transparent png's size will be in pixels and the margin on the other pages is set in ems, which could change depending a user's browser settings.\nThe better solution is adding the #main div on the post index page, a class to the article containers, and moving a few styles around.\n. @namebrandon and @davidelnunes Here are the changes I made to fix the 'jumpy' sidebar. https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/99d4eee5bb7d1f33ba13b2dd7cc0b55811517a5a\n. You can add additional links to the _author-bio.html include. I wrapped each of the links in conditionals because it needed to be flexible for the theme. But you can probably omit that and just add new links for whatever you want. Just follow the same structure as the other ones and you shouldn't have any layout issues.\nI'm using Font Awesome for all of the icons, so take a look as to what's available to fit your needs.\n. @Sciss Yes the theme works over http and https. Not sure if you have the latest version of the theme but I made a few changes awhile back that you may need update in your repo. https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/43fb2e5688195cc6fe154ffde8c4bc06be5c29d6\nBasically what you need to do is set url in _config.yml to //domain.com instead of http://domain.com or https://domain.com. This will allow of the assets (CSS, JS) to pull in properly without the browser throwing any security warnings whether the site is visited by http or https.\nTake a look at the Minimal Mistakes demo site and gh-pages branch to see how I did it.\n. In _variables.scss set this line to false. It will default paragraphs back to their default style of having space above each. It will also remove the indent that is applied to the first paragraph.\nIf you want even more space add margin-top to whatever size you want the space to be.\n. It's not really a theme problem. It really depends on what flavor of Markdown you're using. I use Kramdown and it has it's own particular issues (have to remove allowfullscreen and add a space between the iframe tags). The HTML you included above looks correct to me. Just make sure there are blank lines above and below the HTML block. If there aren't it will confuse the parser.\nFitVids has nothing to do with rendering the video. All it does it use some jQuery magic to resive the video so it fills the contents of the main container.\nI haven't added a video test post to Minimal Mistakes yet, but I have one in my other themes. It works across the board. so try dropping in the contents of this test Markdown file into your repo and see what happens. If it works then you know something is up with your post(s). If that's the case what's the link to your public repo so I can check the source.\n. Take a look through these closed issues and let me know if you still need further clarification. These questions come up often...\n- Changing space between paragraphs and indent (#90)\n- Changing main article width (#74)\n. You made a really common mistake. In _config.yml you set the site url to http://localhost:4000 which is obviously going to cause a ruckus in a live environment since the browser is trying to load CSS, JS, and other assets from that domain.\nTo fix that you have to set url: to the domain you will be hosting the site on... in your case //balintneray.github.io. Just make sure when you're testing/working locally you set it back to http://localhost:4000 or leave it blank, otherwise you won't see any changes to the site's CSS or JS (if you make any changes there).\n. While this method does work most of the time, it is extremely fragile. If you're not careful or consistent on how you name the tags in a post's YAML Front Matter, you can easily break things. That said it's one of the only ways I've found to actually build tag indexes and pages for GitHub hosted sites even if the code is a bit of a hack and messy.\nThe better solution is to create a  Jekyll generator or use a plugin to create tag pages dynamically and expose new Jekyll filters for working with tags.\nOnly problem is GitHub pages blocks the use of plugins that haven't been white-listed. You can get around it but its more work and most won't bother. The most popular method is to build the site locally and push the contents of _site to GitHub to host instead of having it build it for you.\nOr you can always host it yourself (like I do) and get all kinds of extra flexibility. On my site I use a Jekyll plugin that creates a page for each tag using a _layout of my choice. It also does some cleanup on the tag names by slugifying them, since you can really cause a ruckus if you're not careful on assign them in a post's YAML Front Matter.\n. It's been some time so my memory might not be the best and these could be non-issues now. But I recall that unless you used a mixture of Liquid filters to slugify and cleaup the tags some browsers would have issue with the tag URLs. The biggie was not properly dealing with spaces in your tag names.\nBack when I first did this Jekyll didn't have the latest Liquid gem and it was harder to slugify post.tags to get around most of these issues.\nYes, to use the plugin you just stick the .rb file in _plugins. Again it's been a while since I set this all up so I don't remember the exact details. As far as I remember it doesn't need a gem or anything added to _config.yml, but it does need a _layout for creating the tag pags. I used one of the category/tag generator plugins found on the official Jekyll docs page and made some minor adjustments to suit my needs.\nI'd suggest starting from there instead of using my repo as an example, since it's not at all documented.\n. Looks like a problem with one of the Jekyll gems/dependcies and not the theme.\nAre you running this locally on Windows by chance? Jekyll 2.5.0 is broken on Windows and produces the merenary/program (LoadError) you pasted above.\nI would uninstall Jekyll 2.5.0 and downgrade to 2.4.0\n. Also you probably have to run Jekyll with bundle exec, see here.\nbundle exec jekyll build\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n. @icaroabreu https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3084\n. @jeremyvoltz That's how I'd do it. Makes updating easier.\n. @osehgol Adding your styles to _page.scss should add them to main.css. First step is to verify that they're indeed there by taking a peek at main.css (either by viewing the site's source or looking at the compiled file in _site/.\nIf the styles are there then it sounds like they aren't being applied properly. I'd check your HTML markup to see if you have the correct class/id names and all that. Other than me teaching you CSS I'm out of ideas :wink: \n. Thanks for jumping in and helping @yihangho \n. I've never used those Jekyll filters to do audio or video. I always embed videos with straight HTML in my MarkDown files. If you remove the two tags and leave just the HTML it will work. Liquid is barfing on your {% video %} tag because it doesn't know what it is.\nHere's what my 2014-11-18-mp4-video-test.md looks like.\n``` html\nlayout: post\ntitle: \"MP4 Video\"\nmodified:\ncategories: \nexcerpt:\ntags: []\nimage:\n  feature:\ndate: 2014-11-18T11:34:04-05:00\n\nThis is testing out Liquid.\n\n\n\n```\nAnd this is how it compiled with Jekyll.\n\nThat Octopress plugin is a good solution if you don't host on GitHub. I don't think that plugin is whitelisted and it won't work if that's the case.\n. They grid system is fairly basic. With my latest theme and personal site I moved over to Bourbon's Neat.\nBut the basic idea is you include various mixins that help take care of all the maths. By default I'm using a 12 column grid but that can be changed in _sass/grid.scss if you want to go with a 16 or something else.\nTo make an element span 10 out of 12 columns you'd use the following mixin @include column(12,10); to make it span 6 out of 12 @include column(12,6);\nThen there are mixins to add space before and after an element. @include prefix(12,1); would add 1 column before and @include suffix(12,2); would add 2 columns after.\nYou can also do things like @include prefix(12,0.5); and add a half column of space before. The push and pull mixins work in the same way. Instead of adding margin to an element it moves them by relatively positioning them to the left or right of the parent element.\nDoing image grids/galleries can be tricky and if that's your intention I'd suggest using a more fleshed out system like Susy. It's way more customizable and meant for that sort of thing.\n. If you're looking for more flexibility there are a ton of solutions out there. Off the top of my head Bootstrap has responsive utility classes that be worth looking at for inspiration.\nI usually do something similar to what you did. display: none when I want it hidden and display: block when it needs to reappear, all wrapped in a media query mixin.\n. Specificity and order matters with CSS. Chances are one of the styles is being overwritten by another. When in doubt fire up the web developer tools in your browser of choice and inspect the element you're having problems with. It should tell you what attributes are being applied and by what class.\nThe line numbers will be off since they come from the compiled .css file and not one of the .scss partials. But you should be able track it down.\n. Depends were it falls in the cascade. Google around. There are plenty of\nresources that will explain it better than I could.\nOn Friday, November 21, 2014, Sciss notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHow do you prioritise the rules? For example, I have a general rule for a\n{ ... }, and then I have a class .btn-news { ... }, and apparently the\nformer overrides the latter (although intuitively that shouldn't be the\ncase, because a class is more specific than an element type, no?)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/103#issuecomment-64044928\n.\n. Hard to tell what's going on there since the computed view doesn't show what is actually being declared. Try the styles tab instead.\n\na.btn might do the trick instead of just .btn. Or you can open the can of worms that is !important and do something like color: $black !important which will force it to take priority over any other declaration.\n. Yup that's correct. Google around for a solution. I don't remember where I saw it but I know I've read a few blog posts where people use different sets of _config.yml files and load them in depending on what environment they're currently working on. One will have a development URL and the other a production one so you don't have to worry about swapping it every time.\n. 2 things.\n1. You need to create a page for each \"category\" page that you want to display posts from.\n2. On these pages you need to include some code to display the actual posts. If you look at my repo you'll see I did something like this.\nhtml\n<div class=\"tiles\">\n{% for post in site.categories.articles %}\n  {% include post-grid.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n</div><!-- /.tiles -->\nFor each category page you'll have to change articles in {% for post in site.categories.articles %} to whatever category you want to filter posts on. For example if you had a page named Foo and you wanted to display all the posts you assigned to the foo category you'd use {% for post in site.categories.foo %}\nThis is all basic Jekyll stuff so if you need further guidance check out the official docs or StackOverflow.\n. Ok so there are several things going on that you need to clean-up. Was hard for me to isolate all the problems since the repo is pretty messy and has a lot of bad things going on. But here are some things to address.\n1. Remove _calc. If you want to group posts into sub-folders don't add the underscore. After you renam move them directly under _posts. I see you did that already so just get rid of the duplicate content since it's confusing Jekyll. At one point you could assign a category to posts simply by putting it in specific folders. The way Jekyll handles collections might be getting confused with how you tried to structure your posts.\n2. I don't know if this matters, but I would make my category names lowercase (for the folder and for categories: name in your posts' YAML Front Matter. I went with calc instead of Calc. Unless you're actively slugifying them it could cause broken links.\n3. You have a broken link in the top nav. Calculator goes to /posts/calc/ which doesn't exist.\n4. index.md in Calc has garbage code in it merge conflicts. You need to deal with that or else Jekyll will keep causing errors on build.\n5. The Calc page isn't displaying posts because you're using an include that doesn't exist. For this theme remove {% include post-grid.html %} and replace it with some HTML and Liquid from the post-index.html. I'll leave this up to you to customize, but you want is something like the following for your Calculator index.md page\n``` html\nlayout: page\ntitle: \"Calculator\"\n\n{% for post in site.categories.calc %} \n\n  {% if post.link %}\n    {{ post.title }} \n  {% else %}\n    {{ post.title }}\n{{ post.excerpt | strip_html | truncate: 160 }}\n  {% endif %}\n\n{% endfor %}\n``\n. Also in your posts you need to changecategories:tocategory:. And I'd shy away from using more than one category per post because that impacts permalinks and other things.\n. Those look like merge conflicts to me. Something is going screwy when you push commits back to GitHub. Take a look at the commits on GH and then take it up with them. Not sure what you're doing exactly but it's git related and not the theme or Jekyll.\n. I just looked at your repo and noticed you have_sitein there. You should really gitignore that directory. If you have your repo and branches [set up properly for GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/) there is no need for that folder. It compiles it for your when you push a commit. I bet that's why you have merge conflicts.\n. Google has you covered on that one. You basically add_siteto your [.gitignore`](https://github.com/pricelessb/pricelessb.github.io/blob/master/.gitignore) file and commit the change and those files will no longer be under version control.\n. Read each of the theme's docs. They're all very similar but different in a few ways.\nOn Tue, Nov 25, 2014 at 2:51 PM, pricelessb notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThanks. Any idea on the author stuff? Tried comparing to minimal mistakes,\nsimple, bones, and made mistakes repo's and all the avatar lines and\n_data/authors file seem to match up.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/104#issuecomment-64459969\n.\n. You need to add comments: true to each post or page's YAML Front Matter that you want comments turned on for. If you look at my other themes I modified the conditional that includes Disqus comments to default to always being on unless you set comments: false. If that's something you're interested in you'll need to modify a line or two in the layouts.\n. Jekyll is notoriously problematic with Windows.\n\nIt\u2019s either the version of Jekyll you\u2019re using (2.4.0) or one of the gems are causing problems. I\u2019ve found that Jekyll will just stop working sometimes when a gem is updated because they don\u2019t always respect how Windows deals with paths.\nAlso recently I\u2019ve noticed that doing builds and running the server with jekyll build or jekyll serve doesn\u2019t work reliably. You need to prepend them with a Bundler exec command.\nAs noted by Bundler on bundler.io\n\nIn some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.\nHowever, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.\n\nWhat I would try is bundle exec jekyll build\nIf that still produces errors update all your gems with bundle update. You\u2019re using an older version of Jekyll (it\u2019s up to 2.5.3 now I believe) You\u2019ll probably still have to do bundle exec jekyll build to run it successfully though.\nHope this helps. If not hit up the Jekyll repo. This issue is quite common for Windows users and the guys maintaining Jekyll are more suited to answer these sort of questions.\n. To use the off-canvas navigation from Skinny Bones you'll have to copy over a lot of different things. It's not a simple copy and paste job. You'll have to really examine the code and migrate things over and adapt Minimal Mistakes to work with it.\nIf you really want that nav I'd suggest looking around for an off-canvas library that is more modular and try plugging that into your site. That or just use Skinny Bones instead.\n. I just downloaded your repo and built it locally. You're _config.yml is pretty jacked up, that's why Disqus and a bunch of other things aren't working. YAML is super picky and if you don't put spaces in the right spots or use tabs instead of spaces things are going to blow up.\n1. Add 1 space after variables. Instead of title:pricelessbrewing you need to do title: pricelessbrewing\n2. Under owner. Don't put anything after the colon.\n3. Everything under owner: needs to be indented 2 spaces, not 1, and they all need 1 space after the colons.\nHere's the cleaned up version. It now loads the site title and everything else that missing before. You still have other stuff you need to cleanup but this should set you in the right direction.\nOh and I would .gitignore your .sass-cache folder too. You don't need that under version control.\n``` yaml\nSite wide configuration\ntitle: pricelessbrewing\nlocale: en_US\nurl: \"\"\nJekyll configuration\npermalink:   /:categories/:title/\nmarkdown:    kramdown\nsass:\n  sass_dir: _sass\n  style: compressed\ngems:\n  - jekyll-sitemap\nkramdown:\n  auto_ids: true\n  footnote_nr: 1\n  entity_output: as_char\n  toc_levels: 1..6\n  use_coderay: false\nSite owner\nowner:\n  name: Mark\n  avatar: biophoto.jpg\n  bio: \"Homebrewer\"\n  email: Pricelessbrewing@gmaii.com\n  disqus-shortname: pricelessbrewing\n  twitter: priceless_mark\n  #facebook: #username\n  #google:\n  #plus: #username\n  #analytics: \n  #verify: \n  #ad-client: \n  #ad-slot: \n  #bing-verify: \n  github: pricelessbrewing\n  #stackoverflow: #http://stackoverflow.com/users/123456/username\n  #linkedin: #username\n  #instagram: #username\n  #lastfm: #username\n  #tumblr: #username\n  #pinterest: #username\n  #foursquare: #username\n  #steam: #username\n  #dribbble: #username\n  #youtube: #username\n  #soundcloud: #username\ninclude: [\".htaccess\"]\nexclude: [\"lib\", \"config.rb\", \"Capfile\", \"config\", \"log\", \"Rakefile\", \"Rakefile.rb\", \"tmp\", \"less\", \".sublime-project\", \".sublime-workspace\", \"test\", \"spec\", \"Gruntfile.js\", \"package.json\", \"node_modules\", \"Gemfile\", \"Gemfile.lock\", \"LICENSE\", \"README.md\"]\n```\n\n. Excellent.\n. If you're using Kramdown (default in the theme) there are a few options available to you that can be set in _config.yml. For example you can set how deep it should go to create the toc. I have it set to use <h1> thru <h6> (the default).\nyaml\nkramdown:\n  toc_levels: 1..6\nI choose to flatten it visually since I didn't really need to call out any sort of hiearchy in the toc. But you can certainly change that by modifying the CSS.\nIf you find Kramdown's automatic toc limiting you can also use Javascript to build one. There are several solutions out there if you search around.\n. @RAlexeev You can do everything you want with CSS. You'll need to play with the .toc__menu styles in _navigation.scss. \nJust by adding li > ul { padding-left: 1rem; } and reducing the padding on li ul > li a I got it working.\n```scss\n.toc__menu {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  list-style: none;\n  font-size: 0.8rem;\na {\n    display: block;\n    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;\n    color: $gray;\n    font-size: $type-size-7;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n    border-bottom: 1px solid $border-color;\n&:hover {\n  color: #000;\n  background: $lighter-gray;\n}\n\n}\n\nli:last-child {\n    a {\n      border-bottom: none;\n    }\n  }\n\nli ul > li a {\n    padding-left: 1rem;\n    font-weight: normal;\n  }\nli > ul {\n    padding-left: 1rem;\n  }\n/ hide sub sub links on small screens/\n  li > ul li {\n    display: none;\n@include breakpoint($medium) {\n  display: block;\n}\n\n}\n}\n```\n\n. Yes. Add comments: true to each post or page you want comments on in their YAML Front Matter. Check out the sample posts in the theme if you need an example of how it works. \n. Something is wrong with how you setup Disqus. Stupid question, but did you create a Disqus.com account and are you using the correct shortname? Looking in your _config.yml file I see you have EyonJoshua set. Doesn't look like that is valid and no Disqus account is setup with that shortname. Which would explain why it's not working.\nOther than that I really don't know what else could be wrong because the theme is working as it should.\n. Nope no experience with it, I don't have any dynamic pages with Jekyll. I self-host and use a .htaccess file for setting the cache on assets and such. And then use Cloudflare to cache the full pages. I haven't had problems with anything being so aggressively cached that the latest content doesn't always show.\nOccasionally an image or two doesn't update, and in that case I kill the page cache with Cloudflare.\nI generally let browsers cache how they're going to cache to avoid http requests and increasing a site's performance. I'd bump around Stackoverflow since this really has little to do with my theme and is more suited for a web dev forum.\n. Good catch. Thanks for the PR\n. This has been covered a few times if you want more of a history look through the closed issues.\nThe gist is when working locally set your _config.yml to url: http://localhost:4000 and when pushing it live change to your site's public domain. You can leave it blank if you're lazy but the home link won't work since it's populated with {{ site.url }} and if that's blank so will the href.\nIf you want to Google around for solutions there are ways of having 2 different config files that you load depending on your environment. Personally I just comment out the url line when working locally and uncomment it when I deploy. The beauty of using Jekyll is flexibility and you can set things up however you need them. There's no right or wrong way, just a matter of preference and taste.\n. Don't bother. I don't think it's that big of a deal. I've had too many issues with assets breaking that I've gone the route of using site.url to make all asset and navigation links absolute. Call me over cautious but with as many questions as I used to get centered around \"why doesn't my CSS load\" it just seemed to make sense and make my life easier.\nbaseurl is only really suppose to be used to mimic a site in a subfolder (eg. http://yoursite.com/blog/) or GitHub pages. Coming from the maintainers of Jekyll you really shouldn't use it and I agree. I have no idea why it's still in the demo site that ships with Jekyll but in my experience it causes way more confusion than it should. Especially when you have non-web devs trying to host their site for free on GitHub and they have no clue what's really going on behind the scenes.\n. You can also change this line in the navigation _include\n<a href=\"{{ site.url }}\">{{ site.title }}</a> to <a href=\"/\">{{ site.title }}</a> and the home link should work in most cases. I haven't tested all permalink types so it might get confused if you go down a few folder levels, which is why I went with {{ site.url }} but give that a try if you don't want to bother with flipping url in your _config.yml.\n. @RamblingCookieMonster If you remove the prototcol from {{ site.url }} it'll work for both http and https\nurl: //yourdomain.com\nThe only other issue that may come up if you care about SEO is duplicate content in the eyes of Google. I don't think there is a way to force redirect http traffic to https on sites hosted on GitHub Pages which is usually the preferred way around this. But I guess that's up to the user and out of scope of the theme.\n. I purposely removed it because it felt more like a distraction on those pages and I wanted the designs to focus on the content. The site's author info is less important on an post index page than on the actual posts.\nYou can certainly add them back though. You'll need to take this bit of HTML and Liquid from the _layouts/post.html and repurpose it into page.html, home.html, and the post-index.html Jekyll layouts.\nhtml\n<footer role=\"contentinfo\">\n  <div class=\"article-author-bottom\">\n    {% include _author-bio.html %}\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"byline\"><strong>{{ page.title }}</strong> was published on <time datetime=\"{{ page.date | date_to_xmlschema }}\">{{ page.date | date: \"%B %d, %Y\" }}</time>{% if page.modified %} and last modified on <time datetime=\"{{ page.modified | date: \"%Y-%m-%d\" }}\">{{ page.modified | date: \"%B %d, %Y\" }}</time>{% endif %}.</p>\n</footer>\nThere's probably some CSS and other markup finessing you'll need to do, but should be a good start.\n. The Flickr add was a no brainer. Thanks for the PR @kennonkwok \n. Yes. I marked up some of my other themes with it so it shouldn't be a big deal to add the extra markup to include microdata for post authors.\n. That's because you didn't set a site.url in your _config.yml. Either set url: http://rudvfaden.github.io or you can hardcode it into the links found in the _social-share.html so they're all absolute page URLs.\nhtml\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text={{ page.url | prepend:'http://rudvfaden.github.io/' }}\" class=\"twitter\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><i class=\"fa fa-twitter\"></i><span> Twitter</span></a>\n. Your custom 404 page is working just fine from what I can tell (except for the broken feature image at the top of the page).\nIf you're trying to test it locally, then yes it won't work. The WEBrick server Jekyll uses doesn't know anything about a custom 404 page to fire up.\n. Not sure I follow what you're asking.\nThe search box that appears on the page is a Google Search box. If your site hasn't been indexed yet from Google you're not going to get any results. I only included it as a sample of what you might want to put on your 404 page. It's up to you to customize it to fit your site's needs.\n. I've run into this myself and haven't come up with a great way around it, other than not putting links in headings or limiting the amount of levels.\nThere's probably some fancy CSS you could work up to display: none; the empty anchors but I've never been motivated enough to bother with it.\n. Also, the Kramdown options you included above likely wouldn't effect the automatic table of contents generator part of Kramdown, I think they're only for specify how it parses text for Markdown purposes.\nThere are a set of options specific for the TOC generator that might be helpful.\n. This looks more like you have a gem conflict. To my knowledge Jekyll doesn't use Node at all, it's all Ruby based. Did you update your gemfile or run bundle update? How's your Gemfile.lock compare to the one I bundled with theme? I'm pretty certain one of the gems either didn't install properly or is causing a ruckus with another one.\nI've found that some of the newer versions of certain gems don't always play nice with other Jekyll dependencies, especially anything related to Pygments or if you're trying to run Jekyll on a Windows machine.\nI do include some Grunt tasks for concatenating JavaScript files for the theme and optimizing images. In that case you need to have Node installed. But these have nothing to do with Jekyll and running build or serve.\n. Digging into it more it's related to the CoffeeScript gem Jekyll uses. It's a known issue with Jekyll and isn't specific to my theme, so best to take the discussion there. \nAs someone who doesn't use CoffeeScript it'll be nice when it's made optional in Jekyll 3 to avoid any unnecessary dependencies, especially since it sounds like therubyracercan take awhile to install.\n. Thanks.\n. It's used to load custom webfonts hosted by Google which are then referenced in the site's stylesheet. If you don't want to use the ones Google provides you can easily remove that line and either replace with another type service, host your own web fonts, or just opt to use default system fonts (Arial, Verdana, Courier, Georgia, etc).\n. I think you just answered your own question, you delete them :wink: . \nGo into _posts and remove all of the Markdown files and replace with your own. If you don't want the About, Posts listing, or Theme Setup pages to appear delete those too...  /about, /posts, and /theme-setup.\nAnd if you want a different homepage modify index.html in the root folder.\nThere's nothing to mess up unless you delete _layouts, _includes or anything related to the site design. The rest is just content.\n. The code blocks fill the #main content container 100%. If you want them wider you'll have to make the container wider by adjusting the CSS.\n. They're working fine on the demo site, something must be screwy on your fork. You have the Disqus shortname set in _config.yml as well right?\n. Sounds like a Disqus issue. I've seen this happen before and usually is a\ncookie problem. You can verify if that's the case by opening the page in\nChrome incognito mode or by clearing your browser/cookie cache.\nOn Saturday, April 4, 2015, Prasad Muley notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@mmistakes https://github.com/mmistakes Yes.

Well the problem isn't Jekyll or the theme. Looks to me you haven't registered a shortname for your site on Disqus yet. If you had, rootpy.disqus.com would work and instead it's saying the forum doesn't exist. rootpy is your username and a shortname. \n\nCheck out this page on Disqus on more info on how to setup one for your site. After you create a shortname for your site then replace rootpy in your _config.yml Disqus should work properly.\n. @navneet1991 \n\nYour site isn't using the Minimal Mistakes theme.\nYour site is using Wordpress and not Jekyll.\nDisqus is indeed working on your site.\n\n. You need an index.html in your examples folder. The server is hitting /examples and not finding anything to display.\n. If you can dig up how Pocket interrupts content I can investigate what's going on. As far as I've tested the theme uses rich snippets to properly markup publisher/author data, published date, title, etc etc. At least as far as Google's Rich Snippets testing tool is concerned.\n. @jtobiasl Nature of the beast. Jekyll isn't really the most user friendly piece of software for non-devs yet. It doesn't have an official way of installing themes which is why all of this is such a pain right now. Getting Jekyll installed and running properly can be a challenge in itself, let alone copying over someone's repo to apply as a \"theme.\"\nNot much else I can do about that right now.\n. @mastito03 I tried both Pocket and Readability. I'm not seeing anything weird with the author names being wrong on posts or other pages. Theme Setup is the only strange one, and I believe it's because it has the author override code on the page. Pocket and Readability are getting confused by it, which there's nothing I can do about that.\nClosing because this seems to be an edge case for a page that is specific to the theme. I'm not concerned that it says \"Author Override\" there since you shouldn't be including that page with your site anyways...\n\n\n\n. I haven't updated it to the universal one yet because as far as I know you need to opt into it. Wasn't sure if it would break things for those who haven't done so yet.\nscripts.html is the include you want to update. Just replace this with your Universal snippet from Google. \njavascript\n{% if site.owner.google.analytics %}\n<!-- Asynchronous Google Analytics snippet -->\n<script>\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  var pluginUrl = \n '//www.google-analytics.com/plugins/ga/inpage_linkid.js';\n  _gaq.push(['_require', 'inpage_linkid', pluginUrl]);\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', '{{ site.owner.google.analytics }}']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

As noted by @prakash014 to link to the site's feed it should be {{ site.url }}/feed.xml. That said not sure how I feel about merging this in. The sidebar is for author related links. By default a link in the footer or possibly the top menu seems like a better home for it.\nIt's also the kind of thing not everyone will want to feature in the sidebar, so it would need to be optional for me to consider it.\n. Fixed in #150 \n. Thanks for the PR.\n. That only works for themes built for Jekyll bootstrap, which this theme isn't. It's just vanilla Jekyll. \nFrom what I've read the JB method isn't all that great either. Best solution I've seen so far is building themes as Ruby gems and using Octopress and Octopress Ink to integrate with your Jekyll site. Waiting to see if that gains traction in the community.\n. Not entirely sure what's going on. As far as I can tell the theme is doing everything right as per Google.\n\nIf the page contains Open Graph properties for the title, image, and description, they will be used for the +Snippet.\n\nWhich are included in the <head> of each page.\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"...\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"...\" />\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"...\" />\nNot sure why Google is ignoring it in the snippet. I tested sharing one of theme's demo pages on Google+ and it pulls in the feature image, but seems to use the author name as page title and doesn't add the description. No idea why it's doing that because the OG data seems accurate to me.\n. Possible solution would be to update the post/page layouts to include schema.org microdata to help identify what content is what. Back in the day I included a lot of these tags in the markup but took them out because it over complicated things and it didn't really fit all use cases.\nProbably wouldn't be too hard for you to add it to your own fork if that's something you're comfortable doing.\n. Could be. There's nothing stopping you from using a taller image if you\nwanted to test that out. You could also modify the theme to use a different\nimage for the OG one if the feature image is giving you problems.

I don't have a working example but for testing I tried out the jekyll-picture-tag plugin recently. I've been looking for a solution to help deal with responsive images on my own site and generating the necessary markup and various sized images.\n\nBy following the plugin's setup instructions I had no problem getting it to work. The tricky part is deciding on what you want all the width's to be and what breakpoints they should adjust at. The rest is just setting paths and what not in your _config.yml file. And then using the new {% picture %} Liquid tag anywhere you want to include a responsive image.\nHere's roughly what I did if you want a quick example to get you started.\nIn _config.yml I added a default preset\npicture:\n  source: \"images/_fullsize\"\n  output: \"generated\"\n  markup: \"picture\"\n  presets:\n    default:\n      ppi: [1, 1.5]\n      source_large:\n        media: \"(min-width: 800px)\"\n        width: \"800\"\n      source_medium:\n        media: \"(min-width: 600px)\"\n        width: \"600\"\n      source_default: \n        width: \"300\"\nWhat I did here was setup the source folder for the high-res images in /images/_fullsize and have them output the resized images to /generated/. PPI outputs the images at 1x and 1.5x (you could bump it up to 2x for retina but that'll give you larger file sizes or just stick with 1x if retina isn't a concern). Then I set 3 sample breakpoints from large to small (you'll have to play with the numbers to get everything optimized correctly to fit MM theme's main content size).\nThen I copied the Picturefill script into /assets/js/vendor/ and added the following line to _head.html include to load the script.\nhtml\n<script src=\"{{ site.url }}/assets/js/vendor/picturefill.min.js\"></script>\nThen to include an image I used this Liquid in a post\n{% picture sample.jpg alt=\"unsplash image\" %}\nWhich will look in the images/_fullsize folder for sample.jpg and then output all of the various sizes and generate HTML that looks something like this.\nhtml\n<picture>\n    <source srcset=\"/generated/sample-1200by800-c83ba5.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 800px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-width: 800px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)\" />\n    <source srcset=\"/generated/sample-800by533-c83ba5.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 800px)\" />\n    <source srcset=\"/generated/sample-900by600-c83ba5.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 600px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-width: 600px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)\" />\n    <source srcset=\"/generated/sample-600by400-c83ba5.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 600px)\" />\n    <source srcset=\"/generated/sample-450by300-c83ba5.jpg\" media=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)\" />\n    <source srcset=\"/generated/sample-300by200-c83ba5.jpg\" />\n    <img srcset=\"/generated/sample-300by200-c83ba5.jpg\" alt=\"unsplash image\" />\n  </picture>\nThere's probably better examples out there if you Google around. The plugin isn't specific to MM theme so really any working example you fine should work. Really the only thing you need to do from a theme standpoint is modify a layout or include to load the Picturefill script. Everything else is making sure to install all the necessary dependencies the plugin needs to generate the images and markup.\n. Nice. Glad it was helpful. And good catch on the double braces.\nYour conclusion is pretty much what I came to. I generally size one image that's slightly larger than the main content container and then link to the full resolution version. While it would be great to have responsive images sized appropriately to improve page performance it was a bigger hassle than I cared to deal with right now. Especially when I have close to 1,000 posts I'd have to go back and swap in {% picture %} tags into.\n. Thanks!\n. Yes that's possible. I would have done it that way by default but if you have a really long TOC list it overflows off the screen with no way of viewing it all.\nAs long as your lists aren't that long it shouldn't be an issue unless you want to tinker with the TOC's CSS and add some scroll overflow to it.\nBut if you want to make it so it stays put as you scroll just change position: absolute to position: fixed on the .toc class in /_sass/page.scss.\ncss\n.toc {\n    font-size: 95%;\n    @media #{$large} {\n        display: block;\n        @include grid(12,2);\n        @include prefix(12,0.5);\n        @include suffix(12,0.5);\n        position: fixed; /* changed from absolute */\n        top: 5.5em;\n        right: 0;\n        background-color: $white;\n    }\n}\n. It should. I haven't tested yet though. \n. Just did a test and was able to get it to work with the latest Jekyll 3 beta. Just have to do some minor changes:\n1. Update Gemfile\n2. Run bundle jekyll update\n3. Run Jekyll as you normally would. bundle exec jekyll build or bundle exec jekyll s\nIf you use the Jekyll Gist tag you might run into problems. I had to remove that since it didn't seem like it's been updated for Jekyll 3 yet.\n. Jekyll has a tag for syntax highlighting, you need to use that. Fenced code blocks default to generic looking ones.\nSee this sample post for examples.\n. The auto table of contents is a Kramdown only feature.\nAnother option is to use Coderay with Kramdown instead of Pygments or Rouge. I believe it works with fenced codeblocks.\n. Set comments: true In the YAML Front Matter of each post you want comments on. If you want another behavior it's easy enough to change the Liquid if statement in the layout to do whatever you want (ie: comments enabled on all posts, not at all, etc)\n. Thanks!\n. Changing the $doc-font-size variable will likely screw with all of the typography as you've found. It's been awhile but I believe I didn't set a font size on paragraphs and instead let the browser use the default size (which is around 16px).\nIf you want to change paragraphs (or any other elements) you need to add some CSS to the _page.scss Sass partial. Something like this would increase the size of paragraphs... you'll likely need to bump up the line height too.\ncss\n.article-wrap p {\n  font-size: 16px; /* 16 is the default increase if you want it larger */\n}\n. @lnalborczyk Yes. See https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1043#issuecomment-305472620. You'll need to modify some bits of the theme to use baseurl properly. Other than that the theme is GH pages compatible. I'm hosting the demo version of the theme there just fine. \n.

You might have to move the travel blog into its own repo, as it might be getting confused with the master branch. For all my Jekyll themes they're hosted as projects in the gh-pages branch. But each in they're own repos. I don't think you can have one site in master and another in gh-pages from the same repo.\n. Glad you got it sorted.\n. Anything is possible if you know enough CSS to pull it off.\n. If I remember correctly I'm not using the CSS from _sass/vendor/google/fonts.scss and instead am loading PT Serif directly from Google using their provided script. If you look at assets/css/main.scss you'll see _font.scss is commented out.\n\nThat could be why you didn't see any difference when you switched to the extended latin font subset. Try changing it in includes/_head.html instead and use the <script> code Google provides.\nBut before you go that far I would test the text on Google Fonts to see if PT Serif displays correctly with another subset. There is a box you can enter whatever text you want to preview the font with.\n\nIf it renders the glyphs poorly there too, then you'll have to find an alternate font to use. Another option is not to use any webfonts and just stick with a system font like Georgia. Might not look as nice but you'll get the widest possible support for all characters and glyphs.\nHope this helps.\n. Glad it got you pointed in the right direction. I'm going to close the\nissue since it's not a fault of the theme. Sounds to be some sort of\nwebfont or browser bug/limitation.\nOn Wed, Aug 12, 2015 at 3:15 PM, Adam Klimont notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThanks for pointing me to the right direction.

You'll need to update to get it to show up.\n. I just pushed an update that includes Font Awesome 4.4\nLike @Amorymeltzer said pretty sure Last.fm has been in Font Awesome for a few versions now. No idea if Slideshare was a 4.4 addition or not.\n\nBut either way both icons work just fine for me. If you're having problems getting them to show then check your markup and compare against Font Awesome's documentation because there's clearly something wrong with your setup.\n\n. Closed because I don't feel it's necessary for me to add every social network and site under the sun into the sidebar. It's easy enough to customize the theme for your own needs using the common ones I've added as an equal.\n. Line 171 in page.scss is where you can change the color and/or styling of the menu button that appears on smaller devices.\n. Looks like it's a typo. Should be navtoggle in the CSS and in the HTML.\n. Edit the theme files and just place the embed where you'd like it to appear. Should be as simple as that. \n. Is there any particular reason why you wouldn't just wrap the emphasized text in a an anchor?\nI've always done it that way and then you don't have to create a bunch of other CSS declarations to cover bold, strong, strikethrough, etc etc etc\n<p><a href=\"#\"><em>Emphasized text</em></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><strong>Bolded text</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><s>Strikethroughed text</s></a></p>\nEmphasized text\nBolded text\nStrikethroughed text\n. You'll want to create a page outside of the _posts folder. Look at theme-setup as an example of how pages are setup. \nBasically you create a folder in the root of your Jekyll site and place an index.md file inside of that with Markdown or HTML. There's a million different ways to do this but one way off the top of my head:\n1. Create a new layout /_layouts/raw-page.html and populate it with the contents from that gist.\n2. Create /mypage/index.md. Add the appropriate YAML Front matter for title and set layout: raw-page and leave the content blank.\nWhen you build your site you should get a page at alkamid.com/mypage/ that looks like your gist.\nIf you want more info on how Pages work with Jekyll check out the official documentation.\n. Also you should be able to just add a raw HTML file (or any file for that matter) in root. If you don't include any YAML Front Matter Jekyll should leave it alone. So instead of doing what I suggested above just create /mypage/index.html and place the contents of your gist in that file.\n. url in your _config.yml is missing the http://. Should be\ntitle: Zoey's World\nlocale: en_US\nurl: http://zoeyrae.com\n. Yes it's possible to add any social network you want. Take a look at the _author-bio.html include. You'll see all of the social networks the theme currently supports and how they're wrapped in Liquid if statements. You can simply add the link without that if you want.\nFor the icons I'm using Font Awesome so you'll need to check if it has one for the social network you're hoping to add.\n. Thanks for the PR @kamilszymanski \n. Are you running Jekyll with bundle exec jekyll build and bundle exec jekyll serve? And have you installed/updated all the gems?\n. The theme doesn't use Jekyll's pagination. Have you made modifications to the theme to use that or are you using someone else's fork? In Jekyll 3.0 there's a deprecation warning for pagination because it is no longer included and you need to add jekyll-paginate to your Gemfile.\nhttps://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/announcement-retiring-jekyll-paginate/1004/17\n.

That's possible but you will have to customize the theme to do it. There's a ton of ways to do it but if you like the convention I used for the feature images you could do something similar. I'm not familiar with leaflet maps so not sure what the html looks like, but here's something to get you started...\n\nIn the YAML Front Matter of your post/page add map: foo.html (replace foo.html with whatever the filename is) and place foo.html in your _includes folder.\nThen add something like the following to the post.html and page.html _layouts where you want the maps to appear... perhaps above/below the feature image?\nhtml\n{% if page.map %}  \n    {% include {{page.map}} %}\n{% endif %}\nThat will inject whatever html files you placed in _includes and reference referenced with map:. If you need further help I'd suggest asking on the Jekyll Talk forums since this is more of a Jekyll question than anything related to the theme.\n. This method is probably the easiest unless you want to write a Jekyll plugin or come up with a sleeker solution. Nothing wrong with generating a bunch of includes that you call in as you need them. Worth asking on Jekyll Talk though, there's people way smarter than me that might have a better solution.\n. There's some CSS applied to it that as far as I can tell is inlined as part of the HTML bit you included. You can use the browsers web developer tools to inspect elements on the page and it will tell you exactly what styles are being applied and where.\nI'm seeing this on the wrapper\ncss\n.container-fluid {\n    padding-right: 15px; /* remove or set this to 0 */\n    padding-left: 15px; /* remove or set this to 0 */\n    margin-right: auto;\n    margin-left: auto;\n}\n. If you want to add a feed link to the author sidebar you can do so in the _author-bio.html include. There is Font Awesome icon too if you want to include that before the link the social networking ones.\n. It will build just fine. The theme's demo site is hosted with GitHub Pages and I have zero issues. I made absolutely no changes to the Gemfile that's in the gh-pages repo. It's using Jekyll 2.5.3 and not the github-pages gem. There really isn't many differences between Jekyll 2.5.3 and the github-pages gem anyways... the biggie being it disables plugins and a few other things that helps you test builds locally in the same environment GH uses when hosting your site.\nIf you're having problems with dependencies when using github-pages gem then just remove Gemfile and Gemfile.lock and use this instead and run bundle install as noted by @chamhaw above.\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'github-pages'\n. You'll have to create a new _layout along with CSS to do something like this. Have you looked at my Skinny Bones theme? It has a mix of layouts to do portfolio type gallery pages along with standard \"blog posts\".\n. The demo site is here and all of the source files for it are in the gh-pages branch. \nThe articles and media pages that list posts are filtering by categories set in the YAML Front Matter. If you want to use collections instead you'll probably have to modify some of the variables used in the _includes since they reference {{ post }}.\n. You have a public repo of this? Way easier to troubleshoot that way.\nOn Sunday, January 3, 2016, Jamie M. Kass notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for the help.

You'll need to modify the CSS as the current grid columns have widths of 25%, which gives you 4 across.. https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_archive.scss\nUnder grid view.

Likely cause is leaving url: in your _config.yml blank. Set it to url: http://pricelessbrewing.github.io and the image should show up when you push to GitHub. This will give you an absolute path vs. the relative one you're using now.\n\nOnce the image shows up on the post you may need to force Facebook to rescrape the page to pull in the right image. You can do that using the Open Graph debugger tool.\n. Yes that's exactly why that link didn't work. With url: that anchor ends up being empty as well and obviously points nowhere then.\nNot exactly sure on the GH side of things. As far as I know editing the files commits them to the repo which should update the site. I've only ever done updates through local commits that I push up to GH.\n. Your YAML Front Matter for that post needs to be changed. Go back to how you had it originally\nimage:\n  feature: logo.png\nHaving the full path in there how you have it now is screwing up the OG tag. Take a look at the meta tag in the source and you'll see what I mean.\nhtml\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"http://pricelessbrewing.github.io/images/https://pricelessbrewing.github.io/images/logo.png\">\n. Check the jekyll-3 branch. The theme has been 3.0 compatible for some time. I've been waiting for GH to update before merging into master, which I can do now... when I get a free second :wink: \n. Do you know what lambdas.json is? That's not part of the theme. Sounds like maybe a file specific to your setup that's causing problems.\n. Solution could be here. Sounds like maybe some Node related files are being processed by Jekyll when they should be ignored. I took a look at your repo an didn't see anything out of the ordinary. You're excluding node_modules so not sure where this lambdas.json nonsense is coming from.\n. And one other idea, maybe it's related to your Jekyll plugins. I have zero experience with jekyll-scholar. Perhaps there's a bug there with Jekyll 3.\n. Did you make any changes to the SCSS files? The un-altered ones work just fine with Jekyll 3 as I haven't received any errors and it make the trip fine through GitHub Pages where I host the demo.\nMy guess is you're missing a ; or { after a declaration as the error suggests. It can be tricky finding which line that's on though since it's likely in a SCSS partial.\n. Looks like you're using Bigfoot.js. I'd start by disabling those @imports in main.scss and see if it builds. Probably something in there it doesn't like. If that doesn't work then disable each import and enable 1 by 1 to find the problem partial. Then check the lines for missing ;, {, }, or duplicates.\n. Had a free second and looked at you _sass partials. Wonder if line 42 in variables.scss is your problem. ======= underneath // Links is not valid and probably breaking the compiler. If this existed before updating to Jekyll 3 then perhaps you just got lucky that it didn't fail... or silently failed. When in doubt diff against the files in my repo to see where the errors might have creeped in.\n\n. If you use your browsers web dev tools to inspect the page it'll help troubleshoot what's going wrong. Your pages are throwing the following Javascript error which tells me something you might have changed or added there broke things.\njs\nUncaught TypeError: $(...).fitVids is not a function\nMy guess is it's Bigfoot.js or a typo when you added that. One ; can really screw things up, so double check the commits when you made any script edits to see if you introduced a typo or other bug. That and diff against the scripts in my repo to maybe find out where you went wrong.\nFix the Javascript and the menu will correct itself. None of the scripts are working on your site which breaks the nav and the class names that get applied to it to correctly hide/style things.\n. No problem.\n. I think this is an upstream issue with either Kramdown, Jekyll, or both? Check this thread for more info and solutions. Seems like if uninstall the jekyll gem and install github-pages that may fix things. I haven't had any luck getting backticks to work with syntax highlighting on any of my sites.\nPersonally I use the {% highlight %} tags since they always work.\n. As of version 3.0.0 1cce75a35e339e5b2d305ea521ae22202e7ebc08 GFM code highlighting is supported by the theme.\n. Do you get this error without modifying the files after cloning? Or did you make any changes? This looks to me to be a gem conflict, probably from not prepending Jekyll commands with bundle exec.\nRun bundle install from the root of your site then bundle exec jekyll serve and let me know if you still get the error.\nOther thing to look at would be if you have the same Markdown parser settings in _config.yml. I'd compare against the theme's repo to see if something is missing there.\n. Good. Don't know what to tell you about footnotes other than read up on Kramdown's syntax and reference it when you have issues.\n. You have to remove the feature image YAML from the post or pages you don't an image on. For example if you don't want a feature image on the home page, remove the following from index.md\nyaml\nimage:\n  feature: sample-image-1.jpg\n  credit: WeGraphics\n  creditlink: http://wegraphics.net/downloads/free-ultimate-blurred-background-pack/\nThis is all documented in the Theme Setup.\n. Strange, the font size on your site looks really big to me and not small.\n\nWhat I suggest:\n1. Don't mess with the doc size in variables.scss, that sets the rhythm for a lot of the typography and as you'll notice it also increased the white space above and below headlines, paragraphs, etc.\n2. I didn't set a size on the paragraph elements, they default to around 16px. If you want to change the size the best way is open the Developer Tools in your browser and inspect the element you want to change then mess with the CSS. When you get something you like add it to your stylesheet.\n\nIf you just want to make all the type larger globally then bump up the size on the body. It doesn't have a font-size currently and defaults to 16px so if you want to go bigger pick a value higher than that e.g.\ncss\nbody {\n  font-size: 18px;\n}\nAnything else is basic CSS. If you want to target specific elements to change colors, sizes, whatver, you may need to add some class names to the HTML. That's out of scope of what I can help with.\n. Probably a caching issue. I purposely disable it to make sure I'm always seeing the latest CSS and JS. You could try opening it in an incognito or private window and that usually forces it to not cache the page.\n. Yes. You need to edit the CSS and apply a text-indent on all paragraphs.\nIn /_sass/typography.scss change the paragraph CSS starting @ line 133 to:\nscss\np {\n  margin: 0 0 $indent-var;\n  text-indent: $indent-var;\n  // sibling indentation\n  & + p {\n    margin-top: -($indent-var);\n  }\n}\n. My other theme Skinny Bones supports being localized better as it makes use of some _data files. \nI have no plans to do the same with this theme. You'll just have to go through all the layouts and includes and localize any English text into the language you want.\n. Closing because theme text can now be localized via a data file.\n. I could probably kill Grunt completely and just use npm scripts to do everything (watch, image compression, JS linting and uglifying, etc.). Something I'll have to think about.\n. Combine with update demo site PR\n. \n. Take a look at my other themes (So Simple and HPSTR) for ideas on how to add tags. You essentially loop over post.tags to display them on a page. If you want to build archive pages for each tag you have some more work to do or can use a plugin like Jekyll Archives. \n. You're welcome. Here's a few more examples if you're looking for other ideas on how to do tags with Jekyll.\n. Added support to tag lists for posts in commit 3aa50cc5a5c2075795d157d2626e06a3ce6fc9cc\n. @darrenhaken Yes it did. See the comment above with a link to the commit where it was added back in April of 2016.. Don't think I'll be of much help since I'm not a Ruby guy. Maybe ask for help on the Jekyll Talk forum.\n. jekyll-paginate has been deprecated but still works fine with Jekyll 3+, it's just not getting any new features.\nA good chunk of errors can be solved by just using a Gemfile and Bundler, When in doubt run bundle exec jekyll serve instead of the vanilla jekyll serve.\nBundler will force the load versions specified in Gemfile.lock instead of possibly running conflicting versions installed on your system. You may have to run bundle update first to make sure you have the correct gems installed.\n\nThe preferred method for running Jekyll is with bundle exec, but if you\u2019re willing to deal gem conflicts feel free to go cowboy with a jekyll build or jekyll serv.\nIn some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.\nHowever, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.\n--MM Theme Setup\n. No worries. I've had enough issues running Jekyll over the years and when I finally learned to use bundle exec almost all of them went away.\n. Feel free to remove Gemfile and Gemfile.lock. Personally I would keep them and use Bundler. Running vanilla jekyll serve isn't necessarily the best way. \n\nAnd yes. The versions in the .lock file are the ones that will be used. You have to run bundle update to bump them to newer versions. After they install you should run Jekyll with bundle exec jekyll serve instead. The gem versions in the Gemfile will be loaded instead of what random ones might be installed on your system which helps to mitigate conflicts.\n. Add the file name of the image you want to use to a post or page's YAML Front Matter. See the Setup Guide for more info. \n. It's a fairly simple CSS declaration. Basically I'm using p + p to apply an indent to a paragraph that follows another paragraph. There's also some negative margin being applied.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/#paragraph-indentation\nIf the spacing is giving you issues I'd suggest disabling the indent. It can be a matter of preference that's not for everyone and looks best in certain circumstances. When you have short paragraphs or list elements it can look off sometimes.\n. Yes {{ page.excerpt }} is what you want. If you add excerpt: \"Whatever you want the excerpt to be.\" to a post or page's YAML Front Matter it should show up that page. If it's not showing then there's something likely wrong with your YAML or you've added page.excerpt to the wrong layout/include.\nIf you want to include excerpts inside of a {% for post in site.posts %} or equivalent loop you'd use {{ post.excerpt }} instead.\nAs far as a class name, that has nothing to do with Jekyll. It's HTML/CSS and depending on where and how you want it styled that will likely change.\nJekyll's docs may offer some more help on how to use excerpts.\n. \n. I've found Modernizr is overkill for what I'm doing with the theme. In the upcoming release I've dropped it to shrink the JavaScript footprint. I was only really using it for CSS fallbacks which really isn't a progressive way of handling things.\nI'm also cleaning up the theme's JavaScript overall so it's still accessible when disabled.\nDoing more with less is really what I'm trying to achieve with the theme. I want to avoid jamming in everything or over developing the theme in the hopes of making it more approachable and easy to extend into whatever you want.\n. You can add it using Jekyll's page.next and page.previous variables. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/\nIt only really works for posts. If you're trying to paginate Collections you'll have to roll your own custom Liquid to do it.\n. Remove the 2em of top margin applied to #main and it'll move up closer to the main menu. It's in _sass/page.scss\n\n. Do you have a public repo experiencing the issue? I can't seem to reproduce it.\nAdding this to my _config.yml\nyaml\nauthor:\n  linkedin: \"054b4618\"\nProduces this hyperlink, which clearly isn't screwing with the string like it is for you.\nhtml\n<a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/054b4618\">\nMaybe there's some sort of encoding issue going or malformed YAM in your file. I'd like to avoid adding the cgi_escape filter if it isn't necessary. What's the full LinkedIn URL you're trying to use?\n. Very strange. Maybe it's a Windows 10 issue. I just built from your Bitbucket repo on both a Windows 7 machine and Mac OS X and both worked just fine with the LinkedIn URL correctly resolving.\n\nIt feels like an encoding thing to me but I'm at a loss as to what's causing it. What happens if you wrap all the YAML strings in quotes?\nyaml\nowner:\n  name: \"Dave Kopecek\n  avatar: \"dave-kopecek.jpg\"\n  bio: \"The Blog That Time Forgot.\"\n  email: \"dave.kopecek@gmail.com\"\n  disqus-shortname: \"davekopecek\"\n  twitter: \"davekopecek\"\n  facebook: \"davekopecek\"\n  google:\n    analytics: \"UA-15854484-1\"\n  bing-verify:\n  github: \"davekopecek\"\n  bitbucket: \"davekopecek\"\n  stackoverflow: \"4730908/dave-kopecek\"\n  linkedin: \"dave-kopecek-054b4618\"\n  instagram: \"davekopecek\"\n  pinterest: \"davekopecek\"\nIf you open one of the HTML pages in _site can you paste in what the HTML is for the LinkedIn line?

Theme has been substantially rebuilt. Try the latest update and if the issue is still present please reopen.\n. No worries @ticofab. Someone mistakenly does the same thing at least twice a week :wink: \n. Updated in 378916f6c523a0cddd8f8f829b602548ff59fec3\n. Use Bundler, it should solve the dependency issues you're having by incompatible gems versions loading.\n1. Make sure you have the correct gems installed. Run bundle install... may have to do bundle update if prompted.\n2. Run Jekyll, but with bundle exec jekyll serve and bundle exec jekyll build. Doing this will load the approved gem versions in Gemfile.lock and should fix your problems.\n. Have you made any updates to the theme? Installed plugins? Other gems to Gemfile? What happens if you remove Gemfile and Gemfile.lock and then run jekyll serve?\nYou definitely have some gem issues, which I don't think have anything to do with the theme.\n. What's under gems: in your _config.yml? I'm guessing jekyll-mentions perhaps since it's up above in one of the errors?\nYou'll most likely need to include those gems in the Gemfile so they're installed and called in with Bundler. Most, if not all Jekyll official plugins have instructions to add them to the Gemfile when installing.\n. Only other thing I can think of is to replace gem \"jekyll\" with gem \"github-pages\" in Gemfile, then do bundle install, bundle exec jekyll serve.\nThe github-pages gem ships with a bunch of other dependencies that vanilla Jekyll doesn't include. (eg. Jekyll plugins like mentions, sitemap, jemoji, etc).\n. I've experienced this before too. It has something to do with one of the Jekyll plugin gems. Pretty sure it's jekyll-sitemap as indicated by your error log above.\nCouple of things to try:\n- Update dependencies: bundle update\n- Run bundle exec jekyll serve --trace --verbose for more error info. Helpful for tracking down what file(s) it's barfing on and or what plugin is the culprit. \n. jekyll-sitemap doesn't like something it appears since it all breaks down at\nbash\n  Rendering: sitemap.xml\n  Pre-Render Hooks: sitemap.xml\n/home/marcin/.gem/ruby/gems/jekyll-3.1.2/lib/jekyll/filters.rb:2:in `require': cannot load such file -- json (LoadError)\nAre you trying to run an unaltered version of the theme or have you added your own posts/pages? It's possible there's some YAML or something in the content it doesn't like.\nAlso I just released a huge update to the theme. Give that a go.\n. Also what's your _config.yml look like? I've seen the json error before when directories like node_modules isn't excluded properly in the config. Jekyll tries to read in those files and bad things start to happen.\n. You can do all of that by changing the CSS. Have you seen this demo post in the theme? Tables are styled with dividing lines. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup/markup-html-tags-and-formatting/\nAligning text is easy enough to do as would alternating cell background colors if \"zebra striping\" them is your thing. https://css-tricks.com/complete-guide-table-element/\n. Depends. If you're on and older version of theme then the CSS is different. I\njust released a complete rebuild of the entire theme the other day so give that a try.\nOn Saturday, April 16, 2016, Wilson Mar notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhat I'm writing about here is that I copied the markdown for the table\nfrom\nminimal-mistakes/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2011-03-10-sample-post.md\nand it doesn't display the same way as the demo site.\nI shouldn't need to change the CSS to get the same result, right?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/266#issuecomment-210780207\n. Sure feel free to submit a PR. One thing I would add would be a string for \"Skype call\" in _data/ui-text.yml so English isn't hard coded and can be localized in the author profile from a data file. See what I did with website_label as an example: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/author-profile.html#L29\n. Closing to keep the theme lean and avoid configuration bloat. The defaults cover the most popular networks, anything else I envisioned being customized by the user.\n. Thanks!\n. Not a silly question at all. The entire demo site is under the gh-pages branch. For the starting page you'll find that under _pages/home.md. Just replace index.html with home.md and rename to index.md and then edit however you'd like.\n\nThe left nav stuff in the documentation collection is done by assigning sidebar YAML Front Matter. If you check any of the files in _docs you'll find stuff like this in the Front Matter:\nyaml\nsidebar:\n  nav: docs\nBasically what that's doing is telling some Liquid I have in a layout to use the navigation links in a data file _data/navigation.yml under the docs key. There's also a nav_list helper I built to do most of the heavy lifting. It doesn't quite work in all circumstances so it might need to be customized to fit your need. That's part of the reason I haven't documented it yet since it was kind of a one off to build the docs section.\nHope this helps.\n. @absolutejam Take a look at the breadcrumbs.html include. It's not exactly what you want but might help to get you started with the necessary Liquid to split the path how you need to do subfolders.\n. Think I addressed all of the concerns so closing I'm closing this. Please reopen if that's not the case.\n. Ref https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-unit-test/issues/1\n. Essentially this https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/upgrading/\nEverything is new and there isn't much that stayed the same from 2. If you made any customizations then you're probably in for some pain. If not then the best thing to do is dump everything except your content (posts, pages, collections, and assets) and add them to a fresh version of 3.0. Then set some Front Matter defaults for things like layout in _config.yml as I changed the layout names to be more semantic eg. post.html ~> single.html since it applies to more than just posts.\n. The compare feature on GitHub might be useful for you as it can be used to identify what changed between commits, tags, releases, etc. For example here's a diff compare between 2.2.1 and the latest release https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/compare/2.2.1...3.1.1\nYou can also compare between forks so you might be able to diff yours against 3.1.1 to figure out what to update. To be honest so much changed I don't think I even know everything I touched to properly document an upgrade path. It's essentially a new theme with the spirit of the original.\n. I think all of this gets much better once the \"themes as gems\" feature lands and Jekyll begins to mature.\nRight now the whole idea of forking \"some dude's repo\" and calling that a theme is a pretty big mess.\nIt's probably not all that bad if you take the repo wholesale and don't change anything, but I think most people want to create their own thing. And that's when the real trouble begins as you really need to have an understanding of the source and track all changes to stay in sync.\n. @wilsonmar RE: pulling in test data. The jekyll-theme-test-unit set of files could probably be distilled down further and added as submodules similar to this approach.\nI personally haven't worked with git submodules so I can't comment on how viable or easy that would be to do.\n. @wilsonmar I thought about putting the theme in a submodule but that involves another layer of setup for the user. That and official support to do essentially the same thing is coming to Jekyll. I'd rather see how things shake out before committing to one or the other.\n. What's going on is Markdown is parsing the indents in the code and turning them into code blocks. You have two ways of getting around this.\n1. If you want to stick with a .md file then remove the indents so you have something like the following. It's not as easy to read but it gets the job done.\n``` html\n all-the-things.md \nThere's a hot debate as to whether to use the word \"Archive\" or \"Archives\" - yeah, I'm not touching that! So instead, here we have all the things!\n{% include base_path %}\n{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n{% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n{% if year != written_year %}\n{{ year }}\n{% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}\n{% endif %}\n{% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n2. Rename your file to .html. If you have any Markdown you want to convert either rewrite it in HTML or use some Liquid capture tags to get the string, then spit it back out with the markdownify filter.\n``` html\n all-the-things.html \n{% capture text-string-1 %}There's a hot debate as to whether to use the word \"Archive\" or \"Archives\" - yeah, I'm not touching that! So instead, here we have all the things!{% endcapture %}\n{{ text-string-1 | markdownify }}\n{% include base_path %}\n{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n  {% if year != written_year %}\n    {{ year }}\n    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}\n  {% endif %}\n  {% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n``\n. Pretty sure this is a Kramdown (Markdown) issue see #278. It's taking the indents and parsing them into code blocks. Another way to get around it is to change the page to.htmlinstead of.md`. Then Kramdown won't get confused by the indents. That's exactly what I do with the demo tag-archive page.\nThis obviously won't work if you have Markdown on the page that you want converted.\nI'll probably just strip out the indents from the include to avoid any issues. Makes it slightly harder to read but I highly doubt anyone is going to tinker with it.\n. This was by design. I purposely removed all of the demo posts, pages, and collections because that is content and not part of the theme. You'd be surprised how many people had no clue they could (or should) remove them. For example you know how many forks kept the \"Theme Setup\" page? Answer. A TON!\nAnd as you even said:\n\nEven though people will be changing files after cloning etc.\n\nAll the more reason to remove the demo content. Why give people an extra step if they're going to remove it anyways?\nRegardless I did leave the index.html page in tact and it does get you to a base site.\nIt looks to me as if you're using my gh-pages branch which you really shouldn't be doing.\nIf you use master you'll get the normal \"Recent Posts\" homepage albeit with no posts. My gh-pages branch has baseurl: /minimal-mistakes set which means you have to access it at http://localhost:4000/minimal-mistakes/ when running bundle exec jekyll serve because of said baseurl. I'm assuming amplify and Jekyll-bootstrap are the same way and have a base url set to properly serve their projects with GitHub Pages. An easy problem to solve... remove that line from _config.yml or append the base to localhost:4000\n. @davidobrien1985 You're pretty close to getting it working but I spotted one small thing.\nIn your posts you have author: \"David O'Brien\" which is enabling the author override feature. Essentially what's going on is in each post/page you have author: set with a string, the theme is looking for a corresponding key in _data/authors.yml to assign all of the sidebar stuff to. Since that doesn't exist for you, you get all the blank stuff.\nTo fix it you have a couple of options.\n1. Create authors.yml with something like the following and place it in _data\n``` yaml\nauthors.yml\nDavid O'Brien:\n  name             : \"David O'Brien\"\n  avatar           : \"me.png\"\n  bio              : \"MVP for Cloud and Datacentre management. Interested in all things automation.\"\n  location         : \"Melbourne Australia\"\n  email            : \"me@david-obrien.net\"\n  github           : \"davidobrien1985\"\n  twitter          : \"david_obrien\"\n```\n2. Remove author: \"David O'Brien\" from your posts and pages. This will force things to default to the site.author and the strings in _config.yml will be used.\nHope this helps.\n. Where were you adding author_profile: true? I just did a test and by changing author_profile: false to true in  _layouts/archive-taxonomy.html, the side bar for all the pages Jekyll Archives creates shows up.\n\nTo use the page__hero include with the archive-taxonomy.html layout you'll need to do some customizing. That include is pulling in values from a post/page's YAML Front Matter. If you add YAML Front Matter to the layout that's not really page data as far as Jekyll is concerned but layout data.\nFor example if in archive-taxonomy.html you have:\nyaml\nlayout: default\nauthor_profile: true\nyour_variable: \"Some data here.\"\nTo access it you'd use {{ layout.your_variable }}. So in theory you'd have to modify all of the page.header variables in the page-hero.html include to use layout.header instead.\nI haven't worked much with layout variables but I have seen a lot of weird behaviors with them. Depending on which version of Jekyll you're using it may or may not work... and/or inherit properly in other layouts. Just something to be mindful of.\n. Not sure if this will make a difference but you forgot to uncomment a few things.. specifically the categories and tags options. This is what I used in my quick test. \n``` yaml\nArchives\nType\n- GitHub Pages compatible archive pages built with Liquid ~> type: liquid (default)\n- Jekyll Archives plugin archive pages ~> type: jekyll-archives\nPath (examples)\n- Archive page should exist at path when using Liquid method or you can\nexpect broken links (especially with breadcrumbs enabled)\n- /tags/my-awesome-tag/index.html ~> path: /tags/\n-  path: /categories/\n-  path: /\ncategories:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /categories/\ntags:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /tags/\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives\njekyll-archives:\n  enabled:\n    - categories\n    - tags\n  layouts:\n    category: archive-taxonomy\n    tag: archive-taxonomy\n  permalinks:\n    category: /categories/:name/\n    tag: /tags/:name/\n```\nDo you have a public repo somewhere that I could look at? It's probably something simple you're missing as I was able to get it working without much effort.\n. Ok figured it out. As mentioned up a few responses page.author_profile won't work because archive-taxonomy.html is a layout and not a page.\nThe conditional that evaluates author_profile was only looking for it in the page. I added some additional or clauses to the conditional and that brings it in. If you want to fix it now without waiting for me to update the theme do the following:\n1. In author-taxonomy.html YAML Front Matter flip to true... author_profile: true.\n2. Change _includes/sidebar.html to the following (line 3 and 5 changed)\n``` html\n{% include base_path %}\n{% if page.author_profile or layout.author_profile or page.sidebar %}\n  \n  {% if page.author_profile or layout.author_profile %}{% include author-profile.html %}{% endif %}\n  {% if page.sidebar %}\n    {% for s in page.sidebar %}\n      {% if s.image %}\n        \n      {% endif %}\n      {% if s.title %}{{ s.title }}{% endif %}\n      {% if s.text %}{{ s.text | markdownify }}{% endif %}\n    {% endfor %}\n    {% if page.sidebar.nav %}\n      {% include nav_list nav=page.sidebar.nav %}\n    {% endif %}\n  {% endif %}\n  \n{% endif %}\n```\nThanks for helping to identify this bug. :smile:\n. Could have been the version of Jekyll I was using. When I tried your repo you had a newer version that I updated to. I know at one point YAML Front Matter in a layout worked with {{ page.var }} but that was a bug and it was fixed eventually.\nThat's probably why I didn't notice it originally.\n.

Closing as this appears to be anode-sassissue. Please reopen if that's not the case.\n. Good catch. Thanks.\n. Only way around it is either usehttps://and forget about being protocol agnostic. Or dump thejekyll-feedplugin and roll your own [feed.xml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/master/lib/feed.xml).\n\nIt's probably better for SEO purposes to pick https or http and stick with one as site.url is also used to generate canonical URLs in <head>.\nIf you're hosting on GitHub I honestly can't think of a reason why you wouldn't just stick with https since your site can be accessed both ways regardless of what you put in _config.yml.\nFor example the MM demo site has a site.url of https://mmistakes.github.io and is accessible at https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/ and http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\nI probably should just remove the mention of protocol-less URLs from the documentation as it apparently is an \"anti-pattern\" now.\n. Not exactly sure but all those variables are author ones in _config.yml. Maybe you have some improperly formatted YAML there.\n. I think you found a bug. \nIn _config.yml. Quick fix is to add a Twitter account under author\nyaml\nauthor:\n  twitter: \"padraicst\"\nThere's a conditional in the <head> that I need to improve. It's getting confused by the fact that you set site twitter.username but not author.twitter as well.\n. Bug fix, change *_includes/seo.html line 28\nliquid\n{% assign seo_author = page.author | default: page.author[0] | default: site.author[0] %}\n. @viktorsmari The theme expects author to be a string not an array, that's why it's outputted that garbage at the top of your posts.\nThis is the way the theme expects post author's to be specified.. @viktorsmari I don't think there is an easy way forward. I'll take a look at the templates and see if there is something I can adjust. jekyll/feed and jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag both use author in a similar way as this theme. I'll take a look and see what their solution is to accept author as a string or object.. @viktorsmari I pushed some updates. Try changing remote_theme to the fix branch and see if that takes care of the issue.\nremote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@seo-fixes\"\n  . @viktorsmari Quick look you didn't update remote_theme in your _config.yml. You need to use the line above so it pulls from the git branch with the fix. Otherwise it'll continue to use the current version on master.\nremote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@seo-fixes\". @viktorsmari Hmmm. Define not working. I'm not seeing the author object array text on any of your pages like before.\n\n. @viktorsmari Yup. I removed your local version of _includes/seo.html so it doesn't override the fixed one in the theme.\nAll the pages, including that last one work as expected. No erroneous text printing on the pages from author.\n\n. @padraic7a And you deleted your copy of _includes/seo.html?. @viktorsmari OK good. \nFYI - When I merge in this change you'll want to remove @seo-fixes from the remote theme line. It can pull from master at that point since that SEO branch will eventually be deleted.. Nah don't worry about it @padraic7a, I reopened it today to deal with a sort of related issue.\nIt'll close automatically when I merge in the fix https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/176261c88e7afc9594e8efcdf2f453f34741966c\nA lot has changed with the theme since then, if/when you get around to updating give the docs a look. It's much easier to install/upgrade the theme once you migrate.. Thanks!\n. A PR to develop should be good.\n. Merged in PR #293 \n. The gallery include has some logic built in that determines what CSS class to apply to the wrapper, which in turn determines if it should be 2 or 3 columns of images.\nliquid\n{% if gallery_size == '2' %}\n  {% assign gallery_layout = 'half' %}\n{% elsif gallery_size >= '3' %}\n  {% assign gallery_layout = 'third' %}\n{% else %}\n  {% assign gallery_layout = '' %}\n{% endif %}\nTo do this with the least amount of work on your part you'd need to add a new class to style the images into 4 columns. I'd start with adding something like .fourth to _base.scss:\n``` scss\nfigure {\n&.fourth{\n    > a,\n    > img {\n      @include breakpoint($small) {\n        width: calc(25% - 0.5em);\n      }\n    }\n...\n}\n```\nThen you can use the gallery include with the class parameter like so:\nhtml\n{% include gallery class=\"fourth\" %}\nAnd you should get something like this:\n\n. You probably need to build the CSS as it's not automatic. You'll need to preprocess it using the included npm run build:css task. You made the change to the SCSS but it doesn't exist in the compiled CSS the site uses.\n. :smile:\n. @Sciss Visually four columns is pushing it for me as the images start to get small. I have a feeling this one is a matter of taste and no matter what solution I bake into the theme someone is going to want something else :wink:\nFor now I think I'm going to leave it as is and err on the side of being conservative with 3 columns as the max.\n. Not sure I follow what you're asking.\nCode blocks have overflow-x: auto set in the CSS to properly contain lines that may be too wide to fit inside of the viewport. If they are wider a scrollbar appears to view the entire text (on mobile the scrollbars are generally hidden).\n\nIf what you're asking is how to change it so none of the code is hidden, then you'll need to modify the CSS. If you remove the overflow the text will spill out and look like this.\n\nSo you'll likely have to mess with white-space: pre to force line breaks with something like white-space: normal, which doesn't exactly look all that great either.\n\n. Thanks and merged!\nOn my todo list was to add an transparent black overlay by default, but your PR is much better as it offers more flexibility. Thanks again.\n. Thanks for the PR. I'll keep this open in the off chance others are looking for a way to add supprort. I tend to shy away merging in these types of PRs as I have no interest in adding ever social network under the sun to the author sidebar. \nI'm sticking with the popular requests and the fact that Font Awesome doesn't even have an icon for Speaker Deck doesn't help its cause much :stuck_out_tongue: \n. Well the easiest way is hacking up author-profile.html just as you have. If someone wants to include other links or customize the order or any other particulars that's the best way. The theme was meant to be customized after all...\nAnother option is I bake in something like _includes/custom-author-links.html that forkers can add whatever they want without much fear of diverging from master if they wish to pull in updates later. I did this with the head and footer includes.\nThere's also support for custom sidebars that could possibly be augmented to drive some of this functionality. I use them in conjunction with a custom nav lists to build the documentation site's sidebar links.\n. @vg My intention is not to merge in these sorts of social network link adds and rather leave it to the user to customize the author-profile.html include. \nEditing your copy of the author sidebar affords you way more flexibility to rearrange the order and add/remove links anyway you want, rather than rely on whatever defaults I baked into the theme. \nThey're there to get you started and cover the most common uses.\nAlso if I include a generic icon to be set with any url I can almost guarantee someone will ask for 2 or 3 or more to accommodate extra links. I'm trying to avoid that because I really don't want to bloat it with conditionals covering every possible icon in the Font Awesome library. The theme is called Minimal Mistakes for a reason.\n. @vg Once gemified Jekyll themes matures I'll be able to rebuild the theme that way. Updating and installing will be a 1,000x times easier. Plus you'll be able to override any of the layouts, includes, styles, etc. and not worry about messing with the core theme.\nBut that seems a bit off so for now the best you can hope for is dealing with a few merge conflicts here and there if you decide to pull in updates.\n. @glennsarti I think I have it covered. Now #324 on the other hand... if you can help there that's one I could use some help sorting out. If it's even possible.\n. Closing to keep the theme lean and avoid configuration bloat.\n. Only drawback here is the icon is no longer linked... which I preferred. I think a better fix is adjusting the styling on the .fa class. What's going on is Font Awesome has some default styles to display icons as inline-block which removes the underline on hover. Simply doing:\nscss\n.social-icons {\n  .fa {\n    display: initial;\n  }\n}\nUnderlines the entire link properly.\n\n. Thanks for the PR @tobie!\n. If I remember correctly display: initial that originally fixed the underline issue was causing problems with the icon alignment... they weren't exactly centered.\nAs part of #341 I reverted it back. Not sure if there's another way to do it so the underline is correct and the alignment as well. Personally I'd prefer the alignment since you only see the small missing bit of underline on hover (something you'll never notice on a lot of devices eg: touch enabled ones).\nHappy to accept another PR if there's a way to solve it for both.\n. I think this is something best left out of the theme for now. Ideally I'd use flexbox to lay out elements which makes it painfully easy to change their appearance order.\nTaking the current markup of the page:\nhtml\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"masthead\">...</div>\n    <div id=\"main\">...</div>\n    <div class=\"page__footer\">...</div>\n  </body>\n</html>\nWe could use order as part of flexbox in the CSS:\n``` css\n.masthead { order: 3; }\nmain { order: 1; }\n.page__footer { order: 2; }\n```\nTo move the masthead to the bottom of the page... or do whatever else you want.\n[ #main ]\n[ .page__footer ]\n[ .masthead ]\nSupport for Internet Explorer isn't quite there yet with flexbox so I opt'd not to use it. On my personal site I do and have found it a joy to work with. It's very powerful and has the benefit of not having to mess with the actual page markup if you want to rearrange content.\n. All true. The github-pages gem includes all of those gems by default (jekyll-sitemap, jekyll-gist, jemoji, etc. So removing it throws the error unless you specifically add in all of those. They're the same gems listed under gems in _config.yml.\n. Cases like this is when your browsers web developer tools come in handy. You can right click an element and see all the styling attached to it.\nIn this case a 1px bolder is applied to <u> and <ins> elements. Google uses <ins> for some reason in their AdSense markup.\ncss\nu, ins {\n  text-decoration: none;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #494e52;\n}\nTo fix it add something like this to your stylesheet.\ncss\nins.adsbygoogle {\n  border-bottom: none !important;\n}\n\n. Was hesitant to include it as I don't want to over stuff everything with so many options. You can leave it open and see if anyone chimes in if this sort of thing is useful.\n. Check the gh-pages branch. The raw Markdown files for all posts, pages, and collections are there along with the rest of the source for the demo site.\n. Silly question but what sort of file are you trying to insert an image in this way? If it's a .html it's not going to work as Jekyll won't parse any Markdown in that file.\nThis is Markdown specific syntax and will only work with .md or .markdown files. Unless you do something like capture the string as a variable, output the variable using the Markdown filter to convert it.\n```\n{% capture image-1 %}{: .align-right}{% endcapture %}\n{{ image-1 | markdown }}\n```\nI would just write it as HTML if this is the case since it's a lot more work to use Liquid captures.\n<img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/congestion_zone_300x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"align-right\">\nThe {: .align-right} stuff is Kramdown specific and allows you to add classes and other inline attributes.\n. No worries. I've done the same exact thing, which is why I had a hunch it was your problem.\nThere really is no right or wrong way to do it. Doing it the Markdown way has the advantage of being more readable but sometimes you're doing more work just to get it to ultimately convert into HTML. In those cases it's probably best to just stick with HTML instead of jumping through hoops.\n. You need to properly set url: in your _config.yml to the domain you want to use. So use:\nyaml\nurl: https://www.poudelprakash.com\nAnd your assets and links should be https:// then. I looked at your source and everything is http:// which is why your CSS isn't loading due to insecure mixed content.\n. Did you set `\n. Unfortunately no if you want to continue to use Kramdown's automatic table of contents feature. You can only place it in the same location as the content. If you want a toc outside of that container you have to use another solution, like one of the many Javascripts that can do something similar, or a Jekyll plugin.\nOn my personal site Made Mistskes I use jQuery to move the toc to another <div> so that's an option too. Or you can build the toc manually which might be harder to maintain. That's exactly what I do with the theme's demo site in the documentation section.\n. What does jekyll serve --trace --verbose output? That will give you a better idea of what piece of your content (or file) is giving Liquid problems. There's probably a missing piece of YAML Front Matter or something is incompatible with a variable used in _layouts/single.html that's blowing it up.\n. Hmm nothing is sticking out to me. It sure looks like it's your content though. I'd start by moving all of your posts and pages, build, see if that works. Then move a few back at a time to identify the problem child.\nIt looks like the error happens right around when the jekyll-feed is doing its thing to build the atom.xml file. And then throws some Kramdown parsing errors. This all seems to point to something in your content the Markdown converter doesn't like.\nRendering Layout: atom.xml\n  Liquid Exception: undefined method `gsub' for nil:NilClass in _layouts/single.html\nC:/Ruby22-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/kramdown-1.9.0/lib/kramdown/parser/base.rb:98:in `adapt_source': undefined method `gsub' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)\n        from C:/Ruby22-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/kramdown-1.9.0/lib/kramdown/parser/kramdown.rb:89:in `parse'\n        from C:/Ruby22-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/kramdown-1.9.0/lib/kramdown/parser/gfm.rb:29:in `parse'\n        from C:/Ruby22-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/kramdown-1.9.0/lib/kramdown/parser/base.rb:69:in `parse'\n        from C:/Ruby22-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/kramdown-1.9.0/lib/kramdown/document.rb:107:in `initialize'\nI'm far from a Jekyll expert so you might want to search some closed issues in the Jekyll repo or the Jekyll Talk forums.

Remove index.html temporarily since it invokes pagination and will through an error if you try a build with it turned off.\n2. Go into _config.yml and comment out the Jekyll plugins.\nyaml\n    gems:\n      # - jekyll-paginate\n      # - jekyll-sitemap\n      # - jekyll-gist\n      # - jekyll-feed\n      # - jemoji\n1. Run bundle exec jekyll serve and see if that stopped the errors.\n. Possibly related issue #261 \n. Also @andreabedini I just ran the same test.md\n``` yaml\nlayout: single\nTest\n```\nAnd got the exact same error as you. You're missing title: in the YAML. For pages you'll need that or else it will break things. Posts you do not since Jekyll pulls it from the file name eg: 2016-05-10-your-awesome-post.md, but pages don't have that behavior.\nSo do this instead for a page:\n``` yaml\ntitle: \"Your Post Title\"\nlayout: single\n\nTest\n``\n. Home page doesn't need it. It would just be for any pages you use thesinglelayout.\n. 1. Verify_site/assets/CSS/main.cssexists and has all the styles. \n2. View source of a page and see what the path is for the CSS. That will be a big clue on what is going on and if it's pointing to the wrong location. \n3. Verify you seturlin _config.yml properly. If it has your production domain and you're previewing locally it's going to be missing. Be sure it'surl: http://localhost:4000or blank in that case.\n. @flohw I don't think that would work since you probably wouldn't want every page to have the same title. You could get more specific withpathbut at that point you're essentially doing the same thing as putting atitlein the page's YAML.\n. @flohw Also for what it's worth, as a best practice you should be setting atitlefor every page anyways. I could certainly makepage.titleconditional and that would eliminate the error, but then you end up with no` elements on those pages. Which is generally a really bad thing for SEO.\nIf you look at what the Jekyll does with jekyll new my-awesome-site it's creating an About page and includes title: About in the YAML Front Matter. So this isn't something out of the norm. I think the fact that posts autogenerate a title and pages don't is where people get tripped up.\n. Not out of the box it doesn't, but it shouldn't be hard for you to add.\nAccording to the Mathjax documentation you need to add a JavaScript to the page.\nhtml\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" async\n  src=\"https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML\">\n</script>\nYou can place that bit of HTML inside /_includes/footer/custom.html. It can also go in /_includes/head/custom.html, but for page speed reasons I'd put it in the footer unless you come across some sort of conflict.\nHope this helps.\n. The theme isn't using jQueryUI so that's likely not the culprit.\nI believe this is related to the touch behavior of iOS devices to distinguish between \"clicks\" and touches. You can use a polyfill like FastClick to get around it.\n. Thanks @jhabdas for digging up this info. Will have to see what I can come up with.\n. Fixed in MM 3.2.1 15f4ac96417621fa71b397f44b935ebf3abca6c1... I think :wink: \n. Thanks for the PR @flohw \n. Not sure. Might just be a Jekyll problem (or bug) and not something directly related to the theme. Do you have a public repo with the problem post that I could look at and potentially troubleshoot?\nRunning Jekyll with bundle exec jekyll --verbose --trace might give you some more clues on what Jekyll is having problems with. Could also be something in your content (bad YAML variable, lack of YAML, etc).\n. What about a public repo and the page/post causing the problem? This looks\ncontent related and not necessarily theme related.\nOn Monday, May 16, 2016, donQuant notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI get following output after bundle exec jekyll build

GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/317#issuecomment-219548205\n. Not sure what you're doing but you're missing something that's for sure. There's likely a bit of Markdown or missing YAML that's causing your problem. But without having the files you're using there is absolutely no way I can reproduce.\n\nIf you can't put it up on GitHub, share it zipped up on Dropbox, or put in Gists I really can't help. \n. Thanks @Scot3004 for identifying the cause of the error and fixing it with the PR. I appreciate it!\n. I don't think }()); is wrong as the entire Disqus script came directly from them unmodified. \nIt could be the fact that you have your post using layout: splash instead of layout: single.\nDisqus is clearly working as I have it going on the demo site.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout/uncategorized/layout-comments/\nand here's the source for that page https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2012-01-02-layout-comments.md\nLooking at your repo you're missing comments: true in the post's YAML Front Matter. You can also apply it as a Front Matter default for all posts by adding the following to your _config.yml.\nyaml\ndefaults:\n  # _posts\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      author_profile: true\n      read_time: true\n      comments: true\n      share: true\n      related: true\n. Assuming this has been resolved so I'm closing it. Reopen if that's not the case.\n. You probably have the path to the PDF asset wrong. The example above goes to a 404 page which tells me the PDF isn't where it should be.\nmarkdown\n![caterpillar](http:/adeldaoud.github.io/SUPPLEMENTARY_DATA/my-file.pdf)\nLooks like you're missing a / in the URL as well. Should be http://. Took a look in your repo and something like this should work since this file exists.\nmarkdown\n![caterpillar](/SUPPLEMENTARY_DATA/Daoud_Kohl_2016_MPI_Topic_modeling/economic-intercept-catterpillar.pdf)\nAlso not entirely sure what you mean by pdf-rendering. If you're hoping to have the PDF embedded on the page this isn't a solution for that. With the above Markdown you're essentially linking to a file that depending on your browser will either display it or download the asset. You'll need another solution to go the embedded route.\n. I think you're confusing what GitHub means by rendering PDFs. That's for the GitHub.com site as part of showing PDF's inline in your source code, issues, commits, etc. It's not part of GitHub Pages where your Jekyll hosted site lives.\nTo do PDF's like GitHub does you'll need to use a similar web library that displays embedded PDFs. Off the top of my head I don't know of one. But try the Jekyll Talk forums or Google. You'll get more help there.\n. Sort of. I originally planned to use the Jekyll SEO Tag plugin that comes along with GitHub Pages but it didn't fully support everything the theme does (eg: Twitter Summary cards with large images).\nSo I took what the plugin did and baked it into the theme so I could enhance and build off of it.\nIf for whatever reason you'd rather use the native plugin instead of my customizations you can rip out {% include seo.html %} from /_includes/head.html and replace with {{ seo }} and you're good to go.\n. Followup. The Jekyll SEO Tag plugin has made a lot of nice updates and now supports everything I was custom rolling into the theme and would love to swap it in.\nOnly thing is it would be a bit more work if you want to include feature images as meta data for Twitter Cards and Open Graph. The variable names are different so you'd have to manually specify them and edit any old content.\n| Jekyll SEO Tag | MM theme |\n| --- | --- |\n| page.image | page.header.image |\n| site.logo | site.og_image |\nI tried using some Liquid assign tags to override variables and placed that before {% seo %} in head.html but it didn't seem to work.\n``` yaml\n{% if page.header.image contains \"://\" %}\n  {% assign page.image = page.header.image %}\n{% else %}\n  {% assign page.image = page.header.image | prepend: \"/images/\" | prepend: base_path %}\n{% endif %}\n{% if site.og_image contains \"://\" %}\n  {% assign site.logo = site.og_image %}\n{% else %}\n  {% assign site.logo = site.og_image | prepend: \"/images/\" | prepend: base_path %}\n{% endif %}\n{% seo %}\n```\nIf anyone has any ideas of how to pull in images to be used with {{ seo }} without having to change variable names in the theme or edit YAML Front Matter in posts/pages/collections that would be great.\n. Workaround. Use YAML anchors to avoid duplicating values.\nExample:\nyaml\nheader:\n  image: &image /assets/images/filename.jpg\nimage: *image\nor\nyaml\nheader:\n  image: &image /assets/images/filename.jpg\nimage: \n  path: *image. Sure @jhabdas if you want to work on a PR. I've been putting if off because I didn't want to deal with disrupting the current behavior and any issues that are going to flood in over \"why aren't my Twitter cards showing up anymore\" due to the header.image change :wink:. That and it's going to deprecate the configurable <title> separator and revert back to -. But I'm cool with that, just need to remember to add a note about in the docs. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-title. @jhabdas RE: auto-adding the {% seo %} tag from the plugin I was thinking something like this in case a user wants to rip it out, at least they get SEO optimized <title> elements and the canonical tag.\nhtml\n{% if site.gems contains 'jekyll-seo-tag' %}\n    {% comment %}\n    Add metadata for search engines and social networks if jekyll-seo-tag plugin is enabled\n    {% endcomment %}\n    {% include head-seo.html %}\n{% else %}\n    <title>{% if page.title %}{{ page.title | escape }}{% else %}{{ site.title | escape }}{% endif %}</title>\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ page.excerpt | default: site.description | strip_html | normalize_whitespace | truncate: 160 | escape }}\">\n    <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"{{ page.url | replace:'index.html','' | absolute_url }}\">\n{% endif %}\n_includes/head-seo.html\nhtml\n{% seo %}. Upvoted. I'm picky about the visual appearance of that stuff so that's why I originally baked it into the theme. In the grand scheme of SEO it probably doesn't matter in the least so I can see why it might not make it into the plugin.. @jhabdas Pretty much the same conclusions I drew which is part of the reason I've held off tackleling this. My main motivation was to leverage the plugin so I wouldn't have to maintain the SEO portion of the theme and piggy back on improvements they were regularly making.\nBut I agree, probably too many things to fight against to do it and likely lose a few custom additions the theme accounts for. Is there anything there plugin does the theme doesn't that we should add? . I'm on the fence about putting something like this into the theme.\nI thought about doing exactly this with GA and the Disqus comments but was concerned that someone who doesn't host with GitHub Pages (where the production environment variable is set automatically) wouldn't remember or know to jekyll JEKYLL_ENV=production build.\nAnd I wanted to avoid support issues that I would almost certainly receive saying \"why doesn't my Google Analytics work.\" :neutral_face: \nIt's hard enough to get someone to set url in _config.yml that I'm not convinced those who use alternative hosting would even read my documentation on to set an environment variable as part of their deployment process.\n. Why not just use Sass and bake it into that as another partial that is @imported into main.scss. It keeps all the CSS in one file thus eliminating the extra HTTP request which is good for performance.\n. Looks to me it's a depency issue with the github-pages gem or one of the Jekyll plugins bundled with it. I'm no Rubyist either but looks like html-pipeline depends on Nokogirl which some of the other gems require. \nProbably worth seeing if this issue has come up over in the GitHub Pages repo or one of the Jekyll plugins. There could be a reason why they use that specific version of Nokogirl or perhaps have a better fix. Since I'm not a maintainer on any of these projects I really have no control.\n. Couple of things. If your copy of bundler is behind a simple gem install bundler will update to the latest.\nNokogiri on the other hand has a reputation for being difficult to install. Since you've gotten it to install what I'd suggest is to delete your local copy of Gemfile.lock. Then run bundle update. This will force bundler to update all of the gems listed in your Gemfile and hopefully clear up whatever dependency issue you're having.\nFinally, be sure to prepend all Jekyll commands with bundle exec,\nbundle exec jekyll serve\nbundle exec jekyll build\nIf things still don't work when you run Jekyll, then you'll need widen your search as Nokogiri isn't used by my theme at all. \nIt is used by the github-pages gem and they likely have numerous related issues in their repo. And since you only need that to test Jekyll in a way that mimics GH Page's environment, you can go back to using the vanilla Jekyll gem.\nJust remove github-pages from your Gemfile, replace it with gem \"jekyll\", and make sure you have all of the jekyll plugins listed as well (github-pages gem bundles these so you'll probably need them for things to work properly).\n```ruby\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins\nIf you have any plugins, put them here!\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem \"jekyll-paginate\"\n  gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"\n  gem \"jekyll-gist\"\n  gem \"jekyll-feed\"\n  gem \"jemoji\"\n  gem \"jekyll-include-cache\"\nend\n```\nRun bundle update, and you should be all set.. @juliohm Time to widen your search. Try Stackoverflow you\u2019ll find better help. It\u2019s definitely Nokogiri and it\u2019s dependencies.. Quick glance at your repo and nothing is standing out to me. Not sure what's going on. The fact that it works locally and not when pushed is strange, I'm stumped.\nThe only thing I can think of is the Liquid conditonals that trigger category and tag lists aren't being met. The GitHub Pages gem was recently updated so maybe something changed or broke. But I doubt it since they're working fine for the MM theme demo that is hosted on GH same as your site.\n- Edge case many categories\n- Edge case many tags\nYou don't get any error reports or anything when pushing?\n. baseurl shouldn't matter. The fact that the pages are created is promising. Pretty sure something is up with the Liquid that shows the tag or category lists that linked to above. When I get a chance I'll repush the demo site since it hasn't been rebuilt since github-pages updated. \nTo rule out the updated GitHub Pages gem try the following:\n1. bundle update\n2. bundle exec jekyll serve\n3. Verify if categories and tags are there. If they are then I. Really stumped as running Jekyll this way is suppose to mirror the environment on GitHub.\nYou could also just rip some of the if statements in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/page__taxonomy.html and possibly some in tag-list.html or category-list.html.\n. Sounds like something might have changed then. I'll have to do some testing when I'm in front of a computer. Probably need to modify that conditional if I can reproduce what's going on.\n. I just posted a fix. For whatever reason site.categories.type, site.categories.path, site.tags.type, and site.tags.path were all showing values of null even though they were populated in _config.yml.\nThis was causing a few things to break. Best I can tell something changed with site.categories and site.tags when the github-pages gem was updated. It's possible its a bug in Jekyll but I figured the best solution was just to rename those variables to avoid any future clashes.\nThe fix is to update the following 3 files.\n- https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/page__taxonomy.html\n- https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/tag-list.html\n- https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/category-list.html\n. Excellent. Thanks for pointing out the bug.\n. I think there's a way to do this and preserve the hover effect... Even on touch enabled devices. On my personal site mademistakes.com I do pretty much the same effect on the main navigation links and there's no double tap on iOS. Just need to adjust the CSS some to match. \n. They should be showing for both as it uses the same HTML for either type. I just tested it yesterday when I pushed a fix and all appeared well. Are you using the latest version of MM 3.2.0?\n``` html\n {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].categories_label }} \n {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].tags_label }} \n```\nDo you have a public repo I could see you to try and reproduced your issue?\n. Hoping to testing it later tonite, but off the bat I see several things that could be the culprit.\nUPDATE: I got it working. Here are the steps I followed.\n1. Uncomment # gem \"jekyll-archives\" from your Gemfile then run bundle install.\n2. Add jekyll-archives to gems: in _config.yml with the other Jekyll plugins.\n3. Add jekyll-archives under whitelist: with the other Jekyll plugins since the github-pages gem disables them by default. If you swap github-pages gem with jekyll then you can skip this step.\n4. Uncomment category_archive and tag_archive lines in your _config.yml and change liquid type to jekyll-archives like so:\nyaml\ncategory_archive:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /categories/\ntag_archive:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /tags/\n5. Make sure you're building/serving with bundle exec jekyll serve and bundle exec jekyll build as it will eliminate any dependency issues you may have with the various gems and plugins causing Jekyll Archives to behave irregularly.\nAnd presto. Category links appear.\n\n\n. Excellent. Glad this helped!\n. Closing to keep the theme lean and avoid configuration bloat. The defaults cover the most popular networks, anything else I envisioned being customized by the user.\n. Yes and no. The theme could absolutely use Jekyll's built-in support for Sass and process main.scss that way, but there's a few tradeoffs.\nThe big one is I've decided to write the CSS without vendor prefixes and let tools like Autoprefixer handle them. It leaves you with cleaner code and is one less thing to maintain as browsers continue to evolve and update.\nThe problem is you either need a Jekyll plugin (not supported with GitHub Pages) to run the CSS through Autoprefixer or have an extra build step outside of Jekyll (what I've done) that does it for you.\nIf your site is targeting modern browsers than piping the CSS through Autoprefixer is probably not something you need to worry about. In that case you could easily reorganize the .scss partials into folders Jekyll looks for and configure Sass there.\nI'm hoping that the Jekyll Assets plugin eventually gets whitelisted for GitHub Pages and then I can switch to that since it supports Autoprefixer... among other things.\nUpdate 8/8/2016: Not as nice as using Jekyll Assets or other plugin that supports Autoprefixer, but with this Sublime Text plugin CSS and SCSS files can be updated. Should allow moving these files back into _sass so Jekyll can process them instead of using the included npm run build:css script.\n. 1. No the theme only supports 1 caption per <figure> element. I couldn't find a consistent way of styling the grid with captions that may or may not be on every image.\n2. the gallery helper could be modified to include a title attribute that I believe Magnific Popup uses to populate the overlay caption. Other option would be to possibly modify the JavaScript to have MP use the alt attribute as the image's titleSrc.\nI'm thinking enhancing the gallery helper might be the way to go. Could change L#35 and 44 to something like:\nhtml\nalt=\"{% if img.alt %}{{ img.alt }}{% endif %}\"\ntitle=\"{% if img.title%}{{ img.title}}{% endif %}\">\nAnd then the title could be set in YAML like:\nyaml\ngallery:\n  - url: unsplash-gallery-image-1.jpg\n    image_path: unsplash-gallery-image-1-th.jpg\n    alt: \"placeholder image 1\"\n    title: \"Title for image 1\"\n  - url: unsplash-gallery-image-2.jpg\n    image_path: unsplash-gallery-image-2-th.jpg\n    alt: \"placeholder image 2\"\n    title: \"Title for image 2\"\n. I did a quick test and was able to get it working. I mistakenly suggest adding the title attribute to the <img> elements. If you add it to the <a> it works.\n``` html\n...\n<a href=\n  {% if img.url contains \"http\" %}\n    \"{{ img.url }}\"\n  {% else %}\n    \"{{ img.url | prepend: \"/images/\" | prepend: base_path }}\"\n  {% endif %}\n  {% if img.title %}title=\"{{ img.title }}\"{% endif %}\n\n...\n```\n\n\nI'll be adding this small enhancement to the theme shortly. But if you add the line with img.title and then set titles in the YAML like in my previous example above you should be good to go.\n. @rriemann I've never setup Discourse before. Are the resoruces on https://meta.discourse.org/t/embedding-discourse-comments-via-javascript/31963 all that someone needs to get up and running? I want to be sure I include all the relevant info in the theme's docs because I know I'll get support issues about it eventually :wink:.\n. ebccf636383d82b8f6b903887a61ca33a28fa49a\n. @casa-albore If the theme is working out for you no need to update if the change doesn't fit with your site. It's only cosmetic changes in the theme's CSS to better align things since it's meant to be a 2 column theme. \nYou can easily revert the changes back if you've already merged it in by looking at the commit and adding back the centering.\nChanges: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/ebccf636383d82b8f6b903887a61ca33a28fa49a\n. @flohw Could you add a French translation for undefined_wpm: \"Undefined parameter words_per_minute at _config.yml\" found on line 30 as well? Then I can merge this in.\n. Thanks @flohw \n. @jhabdas Looks like you found some typos. Both Alexa and Yandex should follow the same logic as the others. owner shouldn't be in the variable names.\nHappy to merge in a pull request if you want to take a stab at fixing it. Should be a super easy change.\n. Thanks @jhabdas \n. That's because Disqus identifies comment threads based on the page's URL. They're technically two different pages as far as it's concerned if you use the default Disqus embed script.\nYou really should be redirecting your HTTP traffic to HTTPS to avoid the duplicate content. If you're hosting with GitHub they make this really easy now. If you're self hosting you have a few options like editing your .htaccess file to do the redirect.\n. Can you run npm run build:css and commit the compiled main.css as well so I can merge it all in together?\n. Closing to keep the theme lean and avoid configuration bloat.

The defaults cover the most popular networks, anything else I envisioned being customized by the user.\n. Just a FYI. You don't need Jekyll archives to show all posts. That gem is used to generate individual archive pages for each category or tag. It has nothing to do with building a page that lists all categories or tags.\nIf you just want a page that lists every post in reverse chron remove archive.html in the root, rename _pages/archive.md to _pages/archive.html and replace the content with this.\n``` html\nlayout: archive\npermalink: /archive/\nauthor_profile: true\n\n{% include base_path %}\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n  {% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\nWhich will give you a page at /archive/ that lists every one of your posts.\n\nI noticed quite a few duplicate pages floating around that might cause you trouble down the road. If you have pages in _pages don't place ones with the same name/permalink in the root. They go in one or the other or else they will just overwrite each other.\nAlso if you hope to use Jekyll Archives you were missing a few configurations. The gem needs to be added to Gemfile with gem \"jekyll-archives\" and then bundle install. As well as adding it under gems in your _config.yml along with uncommenting the Jekyll Archives settings and replacing liquid with jekyll-archives.\nRefer to the docs for the full set of instructions.\nFor help with installing Jekyll Archives check their docs.\n. I'm going to assume you got this working. If that's not the case feel free to re-open the issue.\n. How have you setup your illustrations collection in _config.yml? Does it have it's output set to true? The for loop used for site.portfolio collection should work the same way for any other collection as long as it's properly configured and has content.\nIf you have a public repo somewhere I can help troubleshoot otherwise it's really hard to tell what's going on.\n. That could have been the problem, not sure. I've never tried to make a child collection before. \nIf you run into any other Collection related issues, might be worth your time asking for help on https://talk.jekyllrb.com/ since it's more of a \"using Jekyll\" question than something directly tied to my theme.\nClosing because it seems you've sorting it out.\n. Closing to keep the theme lean and avoid configuration bloat. The defaults cover the most popular networks, anything else I envisioned being customized by the user.\n. You're opening a pull request to the wrong repo :wink: \n. Depends on where you plan to host. If on GitHub then a plugin is out of the question (that's why there is no _plugins folder in the theme). Google Search is ok but that relies on what Google has indexed of your site which depending on its age might not be much.\nI've personally used JavaScript solutions where you build a json file of your post content and that is used for searching. One of my older themes, So Simple has this feature built into it. Most of the Jekyll plugins out there take a similar approach.\nIf you'd like more advice search around the talk.jekyllrb.com forums. This question has come up a few times if my memory serves me. You'll get better support there too since this relates to Jekyll in general and not specifically for the theme.\n. That's for bringing this up. It's not technically a bug but intentional. I applied some CSS to that figure element style=\"width: 1200px\" to force it to break the layout as a check. In practice no one would do this.\nI'll update the note below it to accurately describe this.\n. Thanks @proinsias \n. Have you tried adding inline CSS to the img element to set the width and heights you want. That should override any of the sidebar CSS.\nhtml\n<a href=\"http://www.icad.org\">\n  <img border=\"0\" alt=\"ICAD\" src=\"images/ICAD.png\" width=\"90\" height=\"40\" style=\"width: 90px; height: 40x;\">\n</a>\n. Thanks. I merged this in before you updated the pull so if you wouldn't mind resubmitting it since I updated some JS dependencies that are likely missing in your build of main.min.js. If you pull from master you should get them and then I can merge in the updated PR.\n. Thanks again for this and the other PR @ZenHarbinger \n. What have you set your locale as in _config.yml? If it's null or set to something other than en, es, or fr it will be blank (along with most of the other UI text).\n``` html\n{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].pagination_previous }}\n{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].pagination_next }}\n``\n. I think you found a typo.en-GBshould have worked but I have it asen-UK` in the data file which is clearly wrong.\nyaml\nen-UK:\n  <<: *DEFAULT_EN\nShould be\nyaml\nen-GB:\n  <<: *DEFAULT_EN\n. I'm onboard with this enhancement. One small suggestion. What of instead of doing something similar to the comments provider customization, we go with something much simpler:\n1. By default use feed.xml that builds with the jekyll-feed plugin.\n2. All the default feed.xml to be overriden by specifying a path to an external one eg: http://feeds.feedburner.com/whatever or anywhere else.\nRemoving the provider stuff makes it easier to use any other service.\nThinking _config.yml would look something like\nyaml\nfeed:\n  path: # blank (default) uses feed.xml\nAnd _includes/footer.html\nhtml\n  <li><a href=\"{% if site.feed.path %}{{ site.feed.path }}{% else %}{{ base_path }}/feed.xml{% endif %}\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-rss-square\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].feed_label }}</a></li>\n. Rebasing and flattening everything down into a single commit would probably be cleaner. But I'm not the best at Git and haven't had much luck rebasing myself.\nIf you don't mind, probably easier to just refork and open a new PR.\n. Thanks!\nThe theme defaults to a homepage index with paginated posts. The file that builds that is <root>/index.html. If you're adding _pages/home.md with a permalink of / then you're essentially telling Jekyll to build two homepage indexes, one overriding the other.\nThe fact that one of them is a Markdown file is also causing problems with the jekyll-paginate plugin.\nAs per Jekyll's docs in regards to pagination.\n\nPagination does not work from within Markdown or Textile files from your Jekyll site. Pagination works when called from within the HTML file, named index.html, which optionally may reside in and produce pagination from within a subdirectory, via the paginate_path configuration value.\n\nIf you want the paginated homepage then remove _pages/home.md and move that content into <root>/index.html. \nIf you don't want a paginated homepage then just remove <root>/index.html and the error will go away since you shouldn't be using paginator.posts anymore.\n. I don't think that's possible. The Jekyll pagination plugin is kind of limited. It only really works with a page at the root of your site. Trying to use it in multiple locations, collections, categories, etc. will likely produce that error. \n- Octopress Paginate\n- jekyll-paginate-category\nThere are other Jekyll plugins that take a stab at pagination but sadly none of them are supported with GitHub Pages (if you're hosting there).\nClosing as this is an issue with the core of Jekyll/plugins and not the theme.\n. Verify you have the archive settings properly configured in _config.yml. There are settings for the path that may not be filled out. If you're hosting on GitHub then you will have to use the Liquid method, so be sure to fill all of that out.\nAlso the category archive pages may not exist even if you get the path sorted out. If you're using the Liquid method you need to manually create those pages. If you're self hosting then you can use the Jekyll Archives plugin to do that for you automatically.\n. I'm going to assume you got this working. If that's not the case feel free to re-open the issue.\n. @jleberle - For starters your config is off. Check the paths you're using. I think you flipped the paths for category_archive and tag_archive. /categories/ should be with category_archive not the other way around.\nAlso is this your repo that's having the problem? https://github.com/jleberle/jaredeberle.org\nIf so I just cloned it locally and did a build. I think maybe the confusion is over breadcrumbs and \"category\" links near the bottom of a post.\nFor example on this post /blog/quotes/speaking-at-americans/\nBreadcrumbs all seem to work for me as \"Quotes\" goes to /blog/quotes\n\nThe category link does not and is going to /blog/categories/quotes which doesn't exist.\n\nThis is because you're not using /categories/ in your permalinks as part of Jekyll Archives. You can do it with or without, but they need to match. If you output category pages to /categories/:name then the breadcrumb path needs to match that and vice versa.\n. Not really. You'll need to add some custom CSS to do this. The group by array include has nothing to do with this... it's purely styling.\nYouTube video embeds use the <iframe> element. So you'd need to style them similar to how I've styled <img> inside of a <figure> element.. giving them a width, floating to the left, etc. so they align next to each other and fit inside of their parent container.\nYou could try adding iframe to .half and .third and rebuild the theme's stylesheet and see if that works. Might need some further styling to fine tune things.\n``` scss\n  &.half {\n    > a,\n    > img,\n    > iframe {\n...\n}\n&.third {\n    > a,\n    > img,\n    > iframe {\n...\n}\n```\n. Minimal Mistakes uses Susy to build any sort of grid system you want. It's way more powerful and bespoke than an off the shelf an opinionated framework like Bootstrap or Foundation. My intention wasn't to make yet another Jekyll theme that uses those frameworks.\nYou're right it doesn't come with predefined classes to set column widths. I prefer semantic grids that don't liter up your HTML markup with things like class=\"col-4-sm\" or class=\"large-6 columns\". With a little work you can do something similar with Susy and building out the stylesheet to suit your own needs.\nI've tried to make things as extensible as I could so people could fill in any gaps that they need. Rather than bloating it with things most won't use.\n. Probably out of the scope of what I can help with. You're venturing into the fun and exciting world of web development and questions of that nature are best asked on sites like Stackoverflow.\nTo get you started it's has something to do with the FitVid.js script the theme uses to make videos responsive. If you inspect the elements with your browser's web developer tools you'll see it's wrapping the <iframe>s so it can apply some styling. That's making them have a width of 100% which is obviously not what you're trying to achieve.\nYou could disable the script and see if that works for you. That would require doing a similar thing with npm and pulling out the FitVid specific stuff.\nA low-tech solution would be to place the videos in a <table> with however many columns you want and set the widths on the td. Problem with this approach is it's not responsive so it'll likely look awful on small screens when it tries to squish 3 videos together in a row.\n. To start I'd suggest you fire up the web developer tools in whatever browser you're using. This will allow you to inspect any element on the page to get a class name and CSS declarations.\n\nOnce you do that it's a lot easier to see what's going on. Essentially the content is wrapped in a div #main that is centered on the page and has a max width of 1024 - 1280px depending on your screen size.\n\nInside of that is the .sidebar and .page containers. Each of those have various widths so they can adapt at various screen sizes. You'll want to play with those values.\n\n\n.page has some padding on the right to keep it from spilling out completely and accomodate the optional table of contents list that can be added to posts/pages.\nThe CSS for these are mostly in assets/_scss/_page.scss. You'll see I'm using Susy mixins the determine the width of these elements. There are also some prefix and suffix mixins from Susy used to add space before and after.\n``` scss\n.page {\n  @include breakpoint($large) {\n    @include span(10 of 12 last);\n    @include prefix(0.5 of 12);\n    @include suffix(2 of 12);\n  }\n.page__inner-wrap {\n    @include full();\n.page__content,\n.page__meta,\n.page__share {\n  @include full();\n}\n\n}\n}\n```\nAny of these values can be changed you'll just have to make sure they add up to 12 or else things will break and not line-up. Susy is really powerful so I'd suggest you read their docs to fully understand what's going on and how to use the mixins.\nAlso I'll add one more tidbit. The Susy mixins span, prefix, suffix, etc. are set to be fluid. Meaning you'll get percentage based widths instead of static px values. In .page SCSS code above you'll get CSS like this after it's been preprocessed.\ncss\n.page {\n    width: 83.05085%;\n    float: right;\n    margin-right: 0;\n    padding-left: 4.23729%;\n    padding-right: 16.94915%;\n}\nIf you're finding it hard to align things with percentages you can change math: fluid to math: static in assets/_scss/_variables.scss under Grid. There's also some debugging options you can enable to overlay everything with a blue grid to see what's going on.\nscss\n$susy: (\n  columns: 12,\n  // column-width: 90px,\n  gutters: 1/4,\n  math: fluid,\n  output: float,\n  gutter-position: after,\n  container: $large,\n  global-box-sizing: border-box,\n  // debug: (\n  //   image: show,\n  //   color: blue,\n  //   output: overlay,\n  //   toggle: top right,\n  // ),\n);\n. Here's the logic.\n.page has padding applied to the right while .splash and .archive do not.\nThis is done to \"visually center\" it so things look more pleasing if the sidebar is disabled. It also helps reduce the line-length of the text which is good for readability. Long lines of text are harder to read as the eye can have problems tracking position. It is a good rule of thumb to limit characters to around 60-70 for a better experience.\n\nThe how. .page has 3 Susy mixins applied. span dictates it's width. prefix the padding before it (small green box on it's left) and suffix the padding after (the larger green box on the right).\n@ include breakpoint is a mixin for helping with media queries to handle responsive design of various components.\n.page {\n  @include breakpoint($large) {\n    @include span(10 of 12 last);\n    @include prefix(0.5 of 12);\n    @include suffix(2 of 12);\n  }\nYou can change any of those values to get the widths you want. The keyword last on @include span(10 of 12 last); removes the margin on the right so things don't overflow.\nIf you read through Susy's documentation it will all make much more sense. There really is no magic to Susy. It's just a bunch of math, which is easier to write than trying to figure out a bunch of percentages that add up to 100%.\n. Sure.\n#main holds all of the main content (sidebar, center column, etc.). This uses Susy's container mixin which essentially gives it a max-width to keep it controlled. This value is set in assets/_variables.scss with this line:\nscss\ncontainer: $large\n$large is a SCSS variable that maps to 1280px. So after compiling #main will have a declaration of max-width: 1280px;. Meaning it will never be larger than 1280px.\nIt also has a 12 column grid applied to it. If you turned on the debugger in Susy you'd see 12 blue columns across that container. These are the 12 that I use to align and size the .sidebar and .page.\n\nIf I simplify the CSS you essentially have this: a 2 column sidebar and a 10 column page declared with the @include span(x of x) mixin. 2 + 10 = 12\n``` scss\n.sidebar {\n  @include span(2 of 12);\n}\n.page {\n  @include span(10 of 12 last);\n}\n```\nThe prefix and suffix stuff applies padding which you can view as \"internal\" spacing that doesn't count towards the 12 column stuff.\nIf for example you wanted to make the sidebar even thinner you could do:\n``` scss\n.sidebar {\n  @include span(1 of 12);\n}\n.page {\n  @include span(11 of 12 last);\n}\n```\nBeing mindful to add up to 12 so the math works out. 1 + 11 = 12.\n. Closing as I believe I've addressed and answered the question. If that's not the case feel free to re-open the issue.\n. To do what I've done on my personal site it relies on the Jekyll Archives plugin. That's partially why I've included a simpler \"list posts by tags\" page example with the theme. \nThe presentation of the tag list is nothing special, it's just an <ul>. \n\nThe only issue might be browser support. It uses CSS columns which only work with modern browsers.\ncss\n.tag__list {\n  column-count: 3;\n}\n\nI'm reluctant to move this into the theme because it's highly stylized and I don't think it visually fits. You are of course more than welcome to do whatever you want with your site.\n. How is this any better than using the group by array already included with the theme?\nI prefer simpler solutions when possible and keeping things more \"vanilla\" make's it easier to find help instead of digging through layers of abstraction. This sort of logic is more of an add-on than a \"bundle it in by default\" sort of thing I think.\n. Gotcha. Get how it would be useful in some cases, but still not convinced it needs to be in the theme.\n. It's a typo. Should say that it appears \"below\" the author profile. It's working as intended.\n. Thanks for catching it. I'll fix the docs.\nOn Fri, Jul 8, 2016 at 10:46 AM, Mark Allender notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nSounds good. Thanks.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/388#issuecomment-231379101,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/ABUB7RB9AQ02CBifR3PYbB2moWC7Cl8mks5qTmK-gaJpZM4JIFu2\n.\n. I purposely left out the favicon.ico to avoid the propagation of one designed for the theme. I've included it in the past and no one (well mostly no one) ever bothers to change it.\n\nSomeone who knows what a favicon is will be the same person who will add one in. I don't think it's a big issue that the WEBrick server bundled with Jekyll is shouting that there is one missing. The default jekyll new site theme doesn't include a favicon either, so I think there's some precedence here to eliminate the fluff and provide sensible defaults when necessary.\n. I'm not familiar with the intricacies of WEBrick to know if there's a way to suppress those errors. It's not really an error with Jekyll, WEBrick, or the theme.\nDepending on your browser some automatically make HTTP request for favicon.ico and since it doesn't exist WEBrick is showing that message. Those requests will also appear in your server logs.\nBest way around it is as you noted above, drop a favicon.ico file in the root of your site. As this is more of a web dev thing than a responsibility of the theme I don't feel it's necessary to include. It's not going to break anything if you leave it out.\n. Have you looked over the theme's documentation?\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/authors/\nThere's also an example post showing how to assign an alternate author. \nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout-author-override/\n. For the missing images on a single page do you have an example of one not working? What sort of images? The hero image? Markdown images in the body? If you inspect the elements what are the file paths? My guess is that's wrong or you need to prepend them with {{ site.url }} so they correctly resolve. But without seeing the problematic page(s) it's hard for me to speculate.\nHere's a few image examples (using layout: single) if you want to see how I'm doing things to compare against.\n| Demo page | Source |\n| --- | --- |\n| Header Image Overlay | Markdown |\n| Header Image Horizontal | Markdown |\n| Post Image (Standard) | Markdown |\n| Another Post with Images | Markdown |\nAs far as the page title. Those work slightly different for the \"home\" page. There's some logic in there for SEO purposes and tries to do some smart things. You can modify that if you need to, it's all in _includes/seo.html. \n. Looking really quick it looks like you've modified the single.html layout. It's completely missing this:\n{% if (page.header.overlay_color or page.header.overlay_image) or page.header.image %}\n  {% include page__hero.html %}\n{% endif %}\nWhich is the part of the code that brings in the hero images. It's in splash.html but looks like you removed it from single. There could potentially be other changes you've made that broke something. I'd suggest comparing your modified _layouts against the default ones and see where things went wrong.\n. Glad that solved it.\n. What's going on is the area in blue above is the space occupied by your content, that's why the footer stops at the bottom of that container.\nShort answer: to push it to the bottom you need to imploy a \"sticky footer\" fix. You can give .page__footer a fixed height (eg. 150px) and add something like min-height: calc(100vh - 150px); on #main to force it to the bottom. \nThe fixed height value is a bit of a magic number and will need to be adjusted depending on how much content you have in your footer. This is primarily why I didn't do it by default because it could have layout implications if someone has a taller or shorter footer than the default.\nOr if you're only concerned with targeting modern browsers you can use flexbox which is a cleaner approach.\nEither way you'll need to do some CSS modifications to get it working.\n. Can you attach a screenshot of the overlap? I'm not seeing it.\n. Ah yeah I see it. It's related to a pull request @ZenHarbinger submitted to cleanup the sidebar https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/c3e2272a6f6a611c6cf684f1dbfa2ee95c7b387c\nThere's a bit of JavaScript in there that's probably not triggering properly on the custom sidebar shown in the Documentation section of the site.\nDefinitely a bug.\n. Sounds good. Thanks @ZenHarbinger \nAnd yeah there's no author button on these sorts of sidebars. Pretty sure that's why I originally hard-coded the width in there. \nMaybe fallback to that value if the author button isn't present so the sticky sidebar doesn't fire on smaller screens messing with the layout.\n. @ZenHarbinger Through a npm script that pipes it through UglifyJS.\nDocs: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/javascript/\n. Good catch. It's a typo I missed.\n. Closing. Duplicated of #396\n. Thanks for jumping in and fixing this so quickly :smile:\n. I know how all that goes, especially the kids part.\n. If you have a layout set in your posts/pages YAML it will override whatever is set as a default in _config.yml. \nCan you confirm if that is the case? If so either change every occurrence to layout: single or remove them so the defaults can take precedence.\n. Front matter defaults will never take precedence if there are values in the actual post/page's YAML Front Matter. Take a look at Jekyll's docs, it explains how it's suppose to work and what overrides what.\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults\n. The archive single include can be used in collections and not just posts. So there is no guarantee a post.date will exist in every situation.\n. Not currently. I didn't include it as a default because it didn't add much value and is quite easy to add (as you've done in your PR) if someone wants it.\nTheme is a starting point, meant to hack on. I'm trying to avoid adding every possible option. For every person who will want the dates to show, there will be someone who wants them hidden. Making them configurable adds more complexity to the theme.\n. .markup isn't valid. It should be .md, .markdown, or .html. The Jekyll documentation states it that way to imply you can use whatever file format you want.\nI probably should include a note about that since you're not the first person to use .markup as your file extension. \nDefinitely change it back to .md for your _posts. Something else might be incorrect with your posts for them not to show up on the home page. Verify they are in the correct format and there is no extraneous YAML. Someone else had this exact same issue and it was due to an improper post filename.\n. One other thing. You need to enable pagination for posts to show up on the home page. By default it's enabled but I'm not using pagination on the demo site (gh-pages branch) so if you copied over the _config.yml from there that could explain things.\nIn your _config.yml uncomment lines 229 and 230:\nyaml\npaginate: 5 # amount of posts to show\npaginate_path: /page:num/\nAnd rename .MARKUP extensions to .md eg: _posts/2015-08-21-time-capsule-in-space.md and everything should work.\nI tested locally with your repo and after those 2 changes posts show up on the homepage.\n\n. Do you have an example of a gallery with > 9 images that isn't working? To my knowledge there's nothing in the gallery include's Liquid that is enforcing any sort of maximum amount of images.\n. Looking at this closer appears there's a bug with some of my Liquid. Stay tuned for a fix...\nUpdate: fixed, see commit below. Updated sample gallery page (.md source) as reference.\n. Thanks for the PR @ekremkaraca \n. Nope you're not missing anything. Those were just placeholders that I didn't end up using and forgot to remove. Adsense works just fine without it. Simply copy/paste the script code Google gives you into a layout or include where you want it to appear.\nFor the theme's demo site I dropped it in right above the footer if you want to see a live example.\n. With this newer version there are custom head and footer includes so you can copy/paste in AdSense scripts (and other things).\n- _includes/footer/custom.html\nI found that's more flexible. Simply take the script Google gives you after setting up your ad unit and paste it into footer/custom.html, in default.html layout (as I've done with the demo site), or anywhere else you'd prefer ads to appear.\nIf you check out the demo site (gh-pages branch) you can see how I handled it, using the responsive ad unit. These tend to work better with the theme since they adapt to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, etc.) without overflowing the parent container.\nhtml\n    <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n    <div align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n         style=\"display:block; border-bottom: initial;\"\n         data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7328585512091257\"\n         data-ad-slot=\"3049671934\"\n         data-ad-format=\"auto\"></ins>\n    </div>\n    <script>\n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n    </script>\n. I don't think you can easily do this. Check out this thread on the Jekyll Talk forum for more info.\nBut essentially _posts has categories and tags support, while other collections do not. I'm sure it will eventually get addressed since posts are just another collection, but for now you're out of luck.\nThere may be a plugin out there that could do it, but guessing you're hosting on GitHub Pages which won't help you... since they're not allowed.\n. @asarkar Yes still a Jekyll limitation. There is a proposal for the next major version of Jekyll to harmonize collections if you want to weigh in.\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7296\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7202. Thanks for resubmitting the PR. When testing I noticed it was missing a feed link in head.html so I took care of that when I merged this in.\nThanks again.\n. I don't think this pull request is going to work as it has about 300 commits and is bringing in stuff from your repo.\nTry forking the minimal-mistakes repo and then commit your changes that add the Italian text.\nYou should be able to submit a pull request to master from that repo and I'll be able to merge it in.\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\n. Thanks for the PR @lipemorais. This will be merged in with the next release.\n. It's a known issue with adblockers and Font Awesome. The links are there, you're just not seeing them because your adblocker is removing them.\nHere's the upstream issue if you want more context. https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/1799\n. @proof-by-accident No idea. If you share a link to a public repo and the site I can maybe troubleshoot. Otherwise it's impossible for me to tell what might have went wrong for you.. Not exactly sure I follow what you're asking.\nIf you set a page with the archive layout using layout: archive and add content to that like you would in any other post or page, it should have similar styling as the single layout. All of the CSS styles for main content apply across the layouts.\nFor example this test page _pages/archive-layout-with-content.md has a bunch of sample Markdown content in the body and then following it is Liquid loop to show an index of all pages.\nAs you can see the styling is exactly the same as single\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/archive-layout-with-content/, with the exception of metadata, next/previous links, and a few other things that aren't part of the archive layout.\nDo you have an example of the page you're trying to build that is using archive and giving you problems? Perhaps you have it saved as a .html file. If that's the case and you didn't write your content in HTML then that could be why all the styling looks off. \nTo parse the content as Markdown the file needs to be .md or .markdown, which will output the correct HTML.\n. I see what you're saying now.\nA few of these are because single has the content wrapped in section.page__content which applies a few other styles that aren't present in archive.\nThe unstyled links on the other hand are due to the color and underline being removed specifically for an archive list. You could remove that in the CSS if you want to keep the same styling.\ncss\n.archive a {\n    color: inherit;\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\nThe archive layout was designed more for indexes and listing of posts/pages/collections with some really light intro content. Removing overrides in the CSS on links and adding the content wrappers from single into archive would help you harmonize the too if that's what you're trying to achieve.\n. To expand further there's nothing stopping from you from using a hybrid approach.\nIf you want to use archive layout and have the main content styling (with the exception of the link color since that's overridden by .archive) you could wrap the content like so.\n``` liquid\nlayout: archive\n wrap your post content and include markdown=\"1\" so Kramdown process the MD inside \n\n  ... your markdown here\n\n your archive loop \n{% include base_path %}\n{% for post in site.pages %}\n{% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n another block of content if you want \n\n  ... your markdown here\n\n```\nThere's also nothing stopping from you using the single layout and including an archive listing. The links will be colored and the spacing is off because of how the .page_content styles cscade down. But they could be overridden if with custom CSS depending on what you're looking for.\n``` liquid\nlayout: single\nYour markdown content here.\n{% include base_path %}\n{% for post in site.pages %}\n{% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this covers exactly what you're wanting since you didn't share an example. The styles are going to be off here and there just because of how the cascade works. The archive modules aren't completely modular and will inherit styling depending on where they are placed.\n. Can you create a sample repo on GitHub so I can reproduce the issue and debug?\nI'm pretty sure it's a CSS float issue and the content needs to be cleared so the overlap doesn't happen. But it's hard to troubleshoot from a screenshot alone.\nThe theme includes a clearfix class .cf that you can try wrapping the archive listing with and possibly the content that displays after it. But I think if you clear the listing that should be enough.\nSomething like:\n``` html\nContent before\n\n... archive listing ...\n\nContent after\n``\n. Works for me putting the clearfix on` that appears after the listing instead.\n\n. What's going on is when you changed the page from .html to.md it's telling Jekyll to process the page as Markdown.\nSince there is an indent around the subtitle line it's being converted into a <code> block. If you remove the indents it should process correctly.\nliquid\n{% include base_path %}\n{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n{% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n{% if year != written_year %}\n<h2 id=\"{{ year | slugify }}\" class=\"archive__subtitle\">{{ year }}</h2>\n{% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}\n{% endif %}\n{% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n. feed.xml is generated with the Jekyll Feed plugin so make sure that's properly working and installed. The bit in _config.yml is only there to set the feed path that appears in <head> and has nothing to do with generating the actual feed.\nIf you have a public repo I can give you a better idea of what could be setup wrong.\n. Uncommented the gems lines in _config.yml and the feed should generate again. Gems added to the Jekyll plugin group in a Gemfile are suppose to be autoloaded so you don't need to specify them under gems: in the config. But looks like that's not working with the feed plugin anymore.\nyaml\ngems:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-sitemap\n  - jekyll-gist\n  - jekyll-feed\n  - jemoji\nFixed in develop branch b6be3aa\n. Both should work. There was an update to Jekyll a few releases (I forget which version) ago that changed gems to the more semantic plugins. \nplugins is suppose to be backwards compatible but maybe you're using an older version of Jekyll?. As per their docs\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f If you are using Jekyll < 3.5.0 use the gems key instead of plugins.\n\nSmells like you're on an older version of Jekyll.. You're using Bundler correct (eg. bundle exec jekyll serve)? What versions of Jekyll and jekyll-feed are in your Gemfile.lock\nThat'll tell you really quick what versions of the gems you're using and verify you're on the latest.. Yeah looks fine to me.\nIn my experience plugins are inconsistent with theme gems. I have no idea if it's gotten better with later releases or if it's up to the plugin to autoload. I err on the side of caution and just add them all to the plugins in _config.yml. Perhaps this thread will be helpful. I don't think the error is theme related.\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3985\n. @ceefour Looks to be related to the jekyll-gist gem. Please file an issue upstream as I don't control that gem.\n- https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-gist/issues/30\n. @ceefour That said the issue isn't theme related. It's something with either your Ruby environment, the Jekyll gem, one of its dependencies, or a combination of these. You'll have to look for help there.\nOnly other thing I can think of is you're using github-pages gem in Gemfile, which autoloads the Jekyll Gist gem regardless if you comment it out or not. Try replacing with gem \"jekyll\", then bundle update, then bundle exec jekyll serve.\nOther than that I can't really offer any other advice or help. You're better off hoping someone from the core Jekyll team or one of its plugin maintainers comes up with a fix. Windows and Jekyll are known to have issues. Well rather Ruby and Windows,\n. Not a bug @ceefour, that's related to the github-metadata plugin. I was going to suggest it but your issue seemed more tied to jekyll-gist so I didn't. When you push your site to GitHub it uses that plugin to automatically set site.github.url for you.\nYou'll get all kinds of other Liquid errors if you don't properly configure it to. That's why I suggested you switch from using the GitHub Pages gem to vanilla gem \"jekyll\" in the Gemfile as it won't use the GitHub Metadata plugin.\nUsually all you need to do is add repository: username/repo-name to your _config.yml and the error will go away.\nGive that plugin docs a read over. It tells you how to set things up so it properly authenticates. If that doesn't work you might have encountered a bug and if so file an issue with them.\n. It depends on where you're hosting. If you hosting with GitHub Pages then you'll want to use gem \"github-pages\" as it uses versions of Jekyll and its dependencies that mirror how GH Pages..\nIf you're self hosting then use gem \"jekyll\" as it gives you the more recent version.\nI don't know all the intricacies of how github-metadata works, but I know i've come across all kinds of similar authentication errors if things are configured correctly on Windows. Like I said usually setting repository is enough, but there are some other options you may need to do.\nReach out to the maintainers of that repo for further help. Entirely possible you hit a legit bug. I can't say either way as I have no involvement with that gem/plugin.\n. @ceefour If you switch to gem \"jekyll\" you'll need to add all the gems/plugins to your Gemfile. github-pages has jekyll-paginate, jekyll-sitemap, jemoji, etc. as dependencies so they come along for the ride. Otherwise you'll get those errors (which tells you exactly how to solve the problem).\nThis is all documented.\n\nThe GitHub Pages gem installs additional dependencies that may need to be added to your Gemfile if you decide to remove the gem \"github-pages\".\nref: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/\n\nYour Gemfile should look like this when using vanilla Jekyll:\n``` ruby\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"jekyll\"\ngem \"wdm\", \"~> 0.1.0\" if Gem.win_platform?\nIf you have any plugins, put them here!\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem \"jekyll-paginate\"\n  gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"\n  gem \"jekyll-gist\"\n  gem \"jekyll-feed\"\n  gem \" jemoji\"\nend\n``\n. Thanks for testing it out @basnijholt. I'll be sure to properly document that images need a full path now when specified in _config.yml or YAML Front Matter. I mentioned it quickly in the [instructions for using the alpha version](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/jekyll/gemified-theme-alpha/) but it might not have been as clear as it needed to be.\n. @basnijholt Keep your existing_config.yml. Gemified themes only contain_layouts,_includes,_sass, andassets. There is no way to bundle in configs,_data,_posts`, pages, or collections.\nSo you'll need your existing config for things to work. All this is really solving is the need to manually copy layouts and assets into your repo making installing and updating the theme easier.\n. @ashmaroli :+1: already on it!\n. gem install minimal-mistakes-jekyll\nor add to Gemfile\ngem 'minimal-mistakes-jekyll'\nhttps://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll\n. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/\n. Social links are there. You likely have an ad blocker running which tend to go overboard and remove Font Awesome icons in attempt to rid the page of bulky social sharing scripts (which this theme doesn't use).\nHere's the upstream issue if you want more context. https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/1799\n\nClosing as this is a duplicate of #413 \n. Same issue as #422, related to an ad blocker removing Font Awesome icons... which are used in the sidebar, footer, and social sharing buttons.\n\n. No problem. I've gotten this issue enough times now I know exactly what the problem is when it comes up. :smile:\n. Same issue as #422, related to an ad blocker removing Font Awesome icons... which are used in the sidebar, footer, and social sharing buttons.\n\n. They're all in the gh-pages branch. You can download from there and then integrate the _posts, _pages, and collections. Just be sure to properly configure all the settings and front matter defaults in _config.yml.\nQuickest way to get up and running would be to download the gh-pages branch and change titles, url, repository and a few other thinks specific to the demo site.\nI've also broken the sample posts out into a different repo to be used in other themes for testing purposes.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-unit-test\n. To do this you'll need to modify the stylesheet slightly. Currently .feature__item's are laid out in 3 columns. If you change this line\nscss\n@include gallery(4 of 12)\nto @include gallery(6 of 12) they'll fill 50% of the parent container and appear as 2 columns.\nIt looks like you're on a slightly older version of the theme so it might be more work for you to update the stylesheet. You'll need to edit the _scss partial and then rebuild main.css using npm run build:css. Archived instructions here.\nThe current version of the theme using native Sass/SCSS preprocessing so you just have to edit the file and Jekyll/GitHub Pages takes care of the rest.\n. Not easily. Other than going through the most recent commits to the theme and editing your repo to match, it could be pretty painful.\nEven if you can do things locally it's not the easiest thing as you'll have to pull down the theme's repo and manage some merge conflicts.\nJekyll just rolled out support for gem themes which will make all of this infinitely easier. You'll just add theme: theme-name in your Jekyll config and won't have to worry about managing outdated layouts, stylesheets, includes, etc.\nI'll eventually be rebuilding the theme to support this, but waiting on a few things first:\n- GitHub Pages to support Jekyll 3.2... coming August 23rd\n- Jekyll themes to be updated to support bundling Javascript and other assets\n. My thought was empty keys fallback to English (what the theme currently does), which should hopefully be a clue when switching languages that they're missing. \nExample: {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].comments_label | default: \"Comments\" }}\nPreviously they were just blank and I noticed quite a few forks where half of the UI text was missing. So I added the English default values as a nudge to consult the docs for those who actually care about such things.\nOpen to suggestions on ways of better surfacing these sorts of things without making it a maintenance headache or junking up things too much.\n. #1278 . Doesn't look like a theme issue.\n_talks and _publications are collections. Looking at your _config.yml I only see that you setup talks. You need to do the same for publications so Jekyll knows to build them.\nConsult the Jekyll collection docs if you need more info.\n. Yeah think you're out of luck with this one :wink:. Looks like it's missing all of the form styling. When I added it to current version of MM I didn't touch the grid. \nIt's likely inheriting styling in the old version that's messing with the layout. Or cancelling some styling out. Maybe try to debug the CSS with dev tools and compare against the latest MM. \nMight be something simple like changing class named to avoid clashes.\n. One quick fix you could do is change <article> in _includes/comment.html to <div>. It's inheriting some width styling from #main article used for the main content column.\nThat and if you pull in the SCSS I used in the current version to style things like .comment__avatar-wrapper and the form you should be in business.\n. Not sure on the preferred way to display them. You'll probably have to test adding them to the page and see how they look. I would think you'll need to make some CSS adjustments in the case they break the layout at all.\nAs far as adding page/post specific JavaScript, I can think of a few ways.\nFor anything that is common among the pages you could add something like to a layout:\n{% if page.script %}\n  <script src=\"the_script_path.js\"></script>\n{% endif %}\nAnd then in each post/page you want that script to load add script: true to its YAML Front Matter. You could obviously name the script variable anything you want to carry more meaning.\nAnd if you need to add something unique to each page you could just put that in the body of the post/page as an inline script:\n<script>\n your script here\n</script>\nYou could try and put the script in the YAML Front Matter if you wanted to keep it out of the main content, but I think that would be tricky as you'll have to deal with escaping quotes and apostrophes to properly capture it as a string.\nHave you searched around https://talk.jekyllrb.com/ or Stackoverflow at all? This seems like the sort of thing many people have done so you might be able to gleam some best practices there.\n. Easy solution is don't leave it blank and use url: \"http://localhost\" when testing locally. The better solution is to create a dev config, something like _config.dev.yml and add any dev environment overrides. In this case you would just need a single line:\nurl: \"http://localhost:4000\"\nThen when you run jekyll locally you do:\nbundle exec jekyll serve --config _config,yml,_confg.dev.yml\nAnd all will be well with the world.\n. Should be an easy fix adding a replace filter and changing the default to en_US to this line in _includes/seo.html\nliquid\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"{{ site.locale | replace: \"-\", \"_\" | default: \"en_US\" }}\">\n. Thanks for fixing this.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. This is a really easy one to solve. Using the Developer Tools available to you in any modern browser you can inspect various elements on the page.\n\nBy inspecting the navigation you'll see all of the CSS assigned to it. On the .greedy-nav element there's a background: #fff which is giving it the white background. Just remove that declaration from _sass/_navigation.scss and that should remove the background color.\n\nYou'll probably have to alter the nav link color since it's unreadable on the image...\n. Same way. Use the web developer tool inspector in the browser and start inspecting elements. If you inspect masthead <div> you'll get what you want.\n\nThen just add background: #fff; to .masthead found in _sass/_masthead.scss.\ndiff\n.masthead {\n  position: relative;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid $border-color;\n  -webkit-animation: intro 0.3s both;\n          animation: intro 0.3s both;\n  -webkit-animation-delay: 0.15s;\n          animation-delay: 0.15s;\n  z-index: 20;\n+ background: #fff;\n}\n\n. You're using an older version of the theme so it's entirely possible there was a bug that's since been fixed.  I recently merged a pull request related to og_image in fact, so I would suggest updating.\nYou probably only need to update _includes/seo.html if you don't want to do a full theme update right now.\nog_image: filename.jpg    # placed in /images/ and og_image: http://yourimage.com/filename.jpg should both work.\nGive the updated seo.html file a try and report back if the problem still exists.\n. Thanks.\nI don't think that error is theme related. Jekyll has a problem with vendor/ruby/2.3.0/gems/jekyll-3.1.6/lib/site_template/_posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown.erb which is in your system, not the theme.\nProbably have to throw vendor into exclude in _config.yml to ignore that file.\ndiff\nexclude:\n  - \"*.sublime-project\"\n  - \"*.sublime-workspace\"\n  - .asset-cache\n  - .bundle\n  - .jekyll-assets-cache\n  - .sass-cache\n  - assets/js/plugins\n  - assets/js/_main.js\n  - assets/js/vendor\n  - Capfile\n  - CHANGELOG\n  - config\n  - Gemfile\n  - Gruntfile.js\n  - gulpfile.js\n  - LICENSE\n  - log\n  - node_modules\n  - package.json\n  - Rakefile\n  - README\n  - tmp\n+ - vendor\n. Merged. Thanks!\n. Currently undocumented because I built it as a \"one off\" for the theme's documentation section. Wasn't really meant to be something as part of the theme as it's not the most straight forward thing to do. \nIt involves manually listing out all of the links in a _data file and then referencing that set of navigation links with sidebar.nav.Name in the YAML Front Matter of whatever post/page/collection you want it to appear on.\nFor example, the menu for the theme's documentation was built by:\n_data/navigation.yml\n``` yaml\ndocumentation links\ndocs:\n  - title: Getting Started\n    children:\n      - title: \"Quick-Start Guide\"\n        url: /docs/quick-start-guide/\n      - title: \"Structure\"\n        url: /docs/structure/\n      - title: \"Installation\"\n        url: /docs/installation/\n      - title: \"Upgrading\"\n        url: /docs/upgrading/\n\n\ntitle: Customization\n    children:\n\ntitle: \"Configuration\"\n    url: /docs/configuration/\ntitle: \"Navigation\"\n    url: /docs/navigation/\ntitle: \"UI Text\"\n    url: /docs/ui-text/\ntitle: \"Authors\"\n    url: /docs/authors/\ntitle: \"Layouts\"\n    url: /docs/layouts/\n\n\n\ntitle: Content\n    children:\n\ntitle: \"Working with Posts\"\n    url: /docs/posts/\ntitle: \"Working with Pages\"\n    url: /docs/pages/\ntitle: \"Working with Collections\"\n    url: /docs/collections/\ntitle: \"Helpers\"\n    url: /docs/helpers/\ntitle: \"Utility Classes\"\n    url: /docs/utility-classes/\n\n\n\ntitle: Extras\n    children:\n\ntitle: \"Stylesheets\"\n    url: /docs/stylesheets/\ntitle: \"JavaScript\"\n    url: /docs/javascript/\n\n\n\ntitle: Meta\n    children:\n\ntitle: \"History\"\n    url: /docs/history/\ntitle: \"Contributing\"\n    url: /docs/contributing/\ntitle: \"Old 2.2 Docs\"\n    url: /docs/docs-2-2/\ntitle: \"License\"\n    url: /docs/license/\ntitle: \"Terms & Privacy Policy\"\n    url: /terms/\n```\n\n\n\nAnd then in each _doc collection page the following was added to the YAML Front Matter to pull in the navigation in the sidebar.\nyaml\nsidebar:\n  nav: \"docs\"\nThe better solution for adding the same YAML to multiple pages is with Front Matter Defaults in _config.yml like so:\nyaml\ndefaults:\n  # _docs\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: docs\n    values:\n      sidebar:\n        nav: \"docs\"\n. Documentation has been added https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#custom-sidebar-navigation-menu\n. @bquast Didn't include that as collection creation is a basic of using Jekyll that can be learned about from the official docs.\n. Sidebar nav should work with posts and pages, not just collections.\n. What's the question/issue you have?\n. If you still have a question or issue feel free to reopen with more info.\n. You shouldn't be adding <!DOCTYPE html></html> to your posts, that's why it was being injected into the excerpts and probably in other places you didn't notice. \nPosts should just be the body content. The rest of the containing HTML comes from the post/page layouts.\nhttp://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/\nFor example the doctype is already in _layouts/default.html\n. Curious do the page header images or overlays still render properly in the _site files? What are the contents of your Gemfile.lock.\nI haven't been able to reproduce the error on Mac OS X or Windows, so curious if it's an older gem or just an environment thing.\nI'll have to do some testing with your pull request since it fundamentally changes the conditional and it might miss some edge cases doing \"x or y or z\" instead of \"(x or y) or z\"\n. So I just did bundle update and it bumped Jekyll to 3.2.1 and now I'm seeing the warning. Looks to be just a warning and the HTML generates fine.\nI'll test out your PR and get back to you to verify nothing breaks.\n. Tested and looks good. Thanks for the PR!\n. Could you breakout try the Chinese text translation commit as its own pull request?\nCould you clarify what the breadcrumb commits are all about? Not exactly sure what that's suppose to fix. Looking at it you removed some conditionals that will give collection pages a problem if breadcrumbs are enabled.\n. Seems as if you removed {% include scripts.html %} from _layouts/default.html. None of the theme's scripts are working because of that. For example the nav button doesn't trigger, the author \"Follow\" button doesn't trigger, and the script that fixes the footer placement by adding padding to its parent so it doesn't cover up content doesn't trigger either.\nWithout main.min.js being included on the page none of those things will work, which is why your site is broken.\nNot sure if you did any other customization but it appears that's the cause.\n\n. Not sure on the comments. My guess is the JavaScript embed for them isn't loading.\nAs far as breadcrumbs. I'd advise against using them. It's a beta feature and takes a lot of manual adjustments to make it work right. Too much can go wrong with paths that it's not worth turning on unless you really understand what's going on with all your content.\n. If it's working locally then that's promising. Can be hard to troubleshoot frontend issues if you don't know what you're looking for.\nI'm not familiar with the commenting platform you use to be any help there. But since that gets added to the page with JS and you had JS issues before I'd backtrace whatever changes you made to the theme. There's likely something missing or incompatible with other scripts.\nNotice you have AnchorJS loaded on the page as well. Maybe disable all the JS and start turning scripts on one by one to identify what's causing the problem.\nStackoverflow can be helpful in these cases too since this is more of a frontend dev question than something I can fix with the theme.\n. Good to know. I can add a note about inline JavaScript comments // causing issues with layout: compress. It's documented on their site and didn't even think to mention it on my theme docs.\n. Thanks. Merged into develop and will push with the next theme release.\nref: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/d3ac1123da4a2e6b2b75d8de0d46a36c57bda576\n. Excellent. Thanks for the added documentation!\n. Here's some hints to get you started:\ndiff\n.masthead {\n-   position: relative;    \n+   position: fixed;\n+   top: 0;\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f3f3;\n    -webkit-animation: intro 0.3s both;\n    animation: intro 0.3s both;\n    -webkit-animation-delay: 0.15s;\n    animation-delay: 0.15s;\n    z-index: 20;\n+   width: 100%;\n+   background: white;  // set a color to hide content that may appear below masthead\n+   height: 85px; // need a magic number here which may break in different viewports\n}\nThis will get the menu in the masthead in the right place. But it will be overlapping the body content. To fix that you need to add some padding to the top that matches the height of the masthead (or larger) so it clear it.\ndiff\nbody {\n    margin: 0;\n-   padding: 0;\n+   padding: 85px 0 0;  // padding-top equal to masthead height or greater\n    color: #494e52;\n    font-family: -apple-system,\".SFNSText-Regular\",\"San Francisco\",\"Roboto\",\"Segoe UI\",\"Helvetica Neue\",\"Lucida Grande\",Arial,sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n}\nThis should hopefully be pretty close to what you need. The author sidebar is \"stuck\" with a sticky polyfill script. It does some voodoo by cloning it, calculating its position, and then re-positioning things to fake position: sticky for browsers that don't support the property.\nI'm thinking that once you square away the other CSS for the fixed masthead it will adjust the author sidebar accordingly. If not then you might need to play around with that script. https://github.com/wilddeer/stickyfill\n\nOn my personal site I have a fixed positioned masthead. The codebase isn't a 1:1 to this theme but it shares a lot of the same scripts and things. Could look there for some ideas to getting it work if the suggestions above don't pan out.\n. Depends on the content and how things are structured. If all the main content is in main then adding the padding there should be fine. Try it out and see what happens. You'll likely need some trial and error to get it right. At least I usually do :wink:\n. I believe by default collections are sorted alpha-numeric, which is why I prefixed the filenames with numbers. If that's not happening for you then something else is at play and best to ask help on talk.jekyllrb.com\nOtherwise, you'll find a few solutions out there for other sorting options. The most common pattern I've seen is to add something like order: 1 , order: 2, order: 3, etc. to the YAML Front Matter.\nThen you can use Liquid's sort filter to reorder them referencing that field:\nyaml\n{% for c in site.your_collection_name | sort: 'order' %}\n. Been awhile since I set up the pages for the docs collection, but that sounds about right.\nThe better solution is add a key to the YAML Front Matter and sort on that instead of having to change filenames anytime you want to update the order.\nPotentially gotcha would be to make sure you don't wrap the numbers in quotes or apostrophes as that would imply a string and I think you'll run into the same sort order issue with 1 != 01. So do order: 1.\n. And if that doesn't work @zfrenchee check out the FAQ collection on my personal site.\nI'm setting order in each document there order: 1, order: 2, etc.\nThen I spit them out like this\n```\n{% assign other_faqs = site.faqs | where: \"type\", \"other\" | sort: \"order\" %}\n\n{% for faq in other_faqs %}\n{{ faq.title }}\n{% endfor %}\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/src/_faqs\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_pages/faqs.md\n. Yes. With reverse\nhttps://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/filters/array-filters#reverse\n. You can loop over the data in any file found in _data like any other Liquid for loop. Check the docs or inquire on the forum for more help. In fact the official docs includes an example for pretty much exactly what you want.\nThese sorts of questions are best for [talk.jekyllrb.com] or Stackoverflow as they're not really theme related. It's standard Jekyll faire.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. When working locally you need to change url in _config.yml to http://localhost:4000. Otherwise all of the asset links will still be using http://danielsank.github.io.\nIf you do this restart the server with bundle exec jekyll serve and all your assets (images, CSS, and JS) should have paths starting with http://localhost:4000 and pull in the local versions.\n. Not sure what's going on. Looks like its parsing the Markdown wrong as there appears to be a > before the code blocks that I'm not seeing in your first example.\nI don't control that part of Jekyll and Kramdown so I can't really comment on the problem. Are you using the github-pages gem locally to run Jekyll so its mirroring the environment on GitHub Pages? Could be you're running a different version of Jekyll locally than what GitHub uses and that's why you don't see the problem.\nGitHub Pages' version of Jekyll is different and it likely doesn't have all the updated gems that might have fixed this issue. You'll need to file a bug on that repo if that's the case since this is an upstream issue and not the theme.\n. Found the issue. It's the Compress HTML layout I'm using. When you run locally you're most likely using Jekyll in dev mode (which disables HTML compression). On GitHub Pages it sets JEKYLL_ENV=production.\nYou can verify this yourself by running bundle exec JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build\nThe HTML compress layout apparently has issues with certain characters. Someone recently submitted a related issue where Chinese characters (#484) were causing problems and would break the layout. That's what's happening here.\nThere may be settings you can adjust to stop that, so check its documentation first. Or you could just disable it all together by removing layout: compress from _layouts/default.html \n. What's your operating system? That matters how you set the JEKYLL_ENV variable.\nFor example with Windows you need to do set JEKYLL_ENV=production followed by bundle exec jekyll serve.\n. It's definitely a setting thing on your end.

I would clean up some of the commented out line or be sure strings like branch: \"master\" are wrapped in quotes. If you look at that error above it's spitting out all of your _config.yml which tells me Staticman can't properly parse it. You to be really careful with the amount of spaces in YAML because it's extremely particular, an extra space here or there can break things.\nFor example you'll probably want something more like this with all the # comment stuff removed:\nyaml\nlocale                   : \"en\"\ntitle                    : \"GnCavalry Article\"\ntitle_separator          : \"-\"\nname                     : \"GnCavalry\"\ndescription              : \"Android\"\nurl                      : \"https://gncavalry.github.io\"\nrepository               : \"GnCavalry/gncavalry.github.io\"\nwords_per_minute         : 200\ncomments:\n  provider               : \"staticman\"\nstaticman:\n  allowedFields          : ['name', 'email', 'url', 'message']\n  branch                 : \"master\"\n  commitMessage          : \"New comment.\"\n  filename               : comment-{@timestamp}\n  format                 : \"yml\"\n  moderation             : true\n  path                   : \"_data/comments/{options.slug}\"\n  requiredFields         : ['name', 'email', 'message']\n  transforms:\n    email                : \"md5\"\n  generatedFields:\n    date:\n      type               : \"date\"\n      options:\n        format           : \"iso8601\"\nAlso you can remove the gh-pages branches on the repo as they're the Minimal Mistakes one and that could potentially confusing things. I've been getting several of your test comments (like #502) which tells me things are most likely misconfigured on your end.\nAs far as I can tell you have it setup right in the theme, it's the Staticman part that isn't quite right. Perhaps file an issue on that repo with the console errors.\n. Also looking at that console error it's telling you have a duplicated line includes: _pages here https://github.com/GnCavalry/gncavalry.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml#L247\nI'd really take a close look at your _config.yml and make sure it's clean. Remove duplicates, extra spaces, commented lines, etc. and try again.\n. One last thing did you follow this step?\n\nAt this point, the invitation will be pending. In order for me to accept it, you need to open:\nhttps://api.staticman.net/v1/connect/{your GitHub username}/{your repository name}\nIf all goes well, you should receive a message saying OK! and we\u2019re good to go.\n. Sounds like the issue is your repo and Staticman then.\n\nIn any case doesn't look like a theme issue. Time to file an issue with Staticman and see if they can help you further.\n. Actually I just did a test on my sites using Staticman and I'm getting Failed to load resource errors for api.staticman.net as well. Looks like it's currently down and that's why it's not working for you.\n. Nevermind. It's working for me. I didn't fill out the form when I tested it.\nAny particular reason you're not setting url in your _config.yml? It should be url: \"https://gncavalry.github.io\". Not sure if that's the problem but it wouldn't hurt.\nI'm seeing an anonymous function on the AJAX call in the script console and that's not something I see on my sites. Only difference I noticed was you're not defining url.\n\nOther than this I'm out of ideas. Think you're hitting some sort of edge case or something obvious I'm not seeing.\n. Strange, I'm not seeing any right alignment to the code blocks. They're all left aligned.\n\n. Could be due to the spaces. \n{% highlight java %}\npublic static Boolean valueOf(boolean b) {\n    return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;\n}\n{% endhighlight %}\nI stopped using Jekyll's {% highlight %} tag awhile ago once GFM backticks started working reliably with Kramdown and Jekyll.\n. If removing the spaces doesn't work it could also be due to how Jekyll deals with excerpts. If you don't define excerpt: in the YAML Front Matter then the theme falls back to Jekyll which autogenerates it from the first paragraph of content.\nEntirely possible it has issues processing the {% highlight %} tag.\n\nSince v1.0.0, Jekyll has had automatically-generated post excerpts. Since v1.1.0, Jekyll also passes these excerpts through Liquid, which can cause strange errors where references don\u2019t exist or a tag hasn\u2019t been closed. If you run into these errors, try setting excerpt_separator: \"\" in your _config.yml, or set it to some nonsense string.\n- https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#post-excerpts\n- https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#excerpts\n. Can you provide a screenshot? I've tested in a few browsers and I'm not seeing anything aligned to the right.\n. OK I see it now. For whatever reason Firefox doesn't stretch the <pre> element to fill it's parent container so it pushes to the right.\n\nAdding .highlight pre { width: 100%; } to the style sheet fixes it.\nI want to cleanup some other things related to line number styling so there will be a proper fix [#513] with those updates eventually.\n. Fixed. You can reference this commit https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/3c034e59f4fe61e1c93521b0fbedaca29b197977 with the necessary SCSS to cleanup the alignment and make line numbers look better.\nExample:\n\n. Fantastic. Thank you @nmiglio!\n. Sidebar nav hasn't been styled to work with archive layout that's why it looks different. It was built for layout: single.\nCSS for the sidebar and code blocks are in these SCSS partials.\n- https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/_sidebar.scss\n- https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/_syntax.scss\n. I just looked at your site. The sidebar is working as intended. When you're on a page that matches one linked in the sidebar nav, an active class is added to indicate that fact... which is where the gray background is coming from.\nIt's not as obvious on your site because you only have 1 link in that sidebar nav. Take a look at the theme's docs where there are more links and if you click around you'll see what's going on.\n\n. Waiting to see how the other assets part of gemified themes work before refactoring or changing anything. There might be implications there that affect what I do with the Sass partials.\n. That's a valid concern. It's still early days with all of this so either way there's probably going to be some conflicts to deal with. What makes it harder is everyone tackles this a different way. When I do get around to this I will most adopt some \"best practices\" from the minima theme.\nI don't plan on making any major changes to the .scss files and the changes I do make will be very similar to what you suggested above.\nFiles are just going to move around to conform to a gemified way of packaging it up. It shouldn't be that big of a deal to merge in whatever customizations you've made. If the file names aren't changing then simply placing your customized files in the appropriate locations will have them take precedence over the ones in the gem.\nAs it stands now it's kind of a clunky process because you need to create that initial .scss file that @imports all the partials. Once support is added for .css, JS, images, and the like I think things will get much easier.\nRefs:\n- https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/419\n- https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/jekyll-theme-building-workflow/2841\n- https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5341\n- https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5343\n. @DanielSank this proposed pull request doesn't add any new functionality or change how you currently customize your site's CSS. It's more of a \"house-keeping\" thing as part of gemifying the theme down the road.\nOn that note, @vwchu have you seen this PR to jekyll/jekyll? I think once this lands your PR won't be needed as the entire contents of /assets/ will be bundled into the gem. Which means assets/css/main.scss and all of the SCSS partials imported can stay put.\nThere's still probably a case to be made for adding !default to the Sass variables in _variables.scss...\n. @vwchu I'd like to avoid moving things around if possible. And the fact that the entire /assets/ folder can be bundled means nothing has to change in that regard.\nStill not convinced 100% main.scss has to drop all the SCSS partial imports and stuff them into another folder just so it can be a 1 liner. Once you dip into the world of customizing the theme you're going to have to worry about staying in sync regardless.\nAn unlikely scenario, but a possible scenario none the less is variable names change in _variables.scss. If any of your SCSS partials reference them... boom! Things break for you and you have to make sure you're on top of what changes with each release anyways.\nDon't think there is any avoiding it whether we go with your proposed solution or leave things as is.\n. That logic can apply to any changes to .scss files though. If breaking changes occur in any of the partials you won't know about that either unless you're carefully monitoring ever change made to the gem.\n. Still early days on all of this with Jekyll and I don't think the best practices have emerged. I'm sure things will become clearer as the feature grows and is adopted. The discussion is always good to have.\nProbably some good ideas to pick from how Wordpress and the like handle it with something like a child theme. Which I guess is essentially what Jekyll is doing.\n1. You have the pristine theme in a gem that the user can't touch.\n2. Files placed in _sass, _includes, _layouts and the soon to be /assets act as \"child theme\" partials that will override the gem if file names match.\nI'm willing to bet most users of this theme never touch any of that and would welcome a nicely packaged theme they can just install via Gemfile and 1 line in their _config.yml. Purely speculative sure, but looking at most of the forks a good majority are that way or from versions I released years ago.\nAfraid overrides will always exist for those who want to tinker and make the theme do what they want. No way around that, unless config switches and custom code injection points/hooks are added everywhere... which I have no intention of tackling.\n. @publicimageltd I'm not that keen on adding some sort of path variable to _config.yml as that would be really limiting. The second after I add support for that someone would want the ability to add two CSS files to the head.\nThat said I've built in a way to add whatever you want to the <head> element... additional CSS files, scripts, etc.\nThrough the magic of gemified theme gems you just need to add _includes/head/custom.html to the root of your site, and then put in there whatever you want. The theme gem is bundled with that file, which is completely blank. So anything you put in your local version will override it.\nYou could add a link element that points to a .css file. Or you could just drop the CSS in like:\nhtml\n<style>\n.foo {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\nNow if you're performance minded you might not like the idea of having additional HTTP requests in your head. If you'd prefer to bundle your custom CSS in with main.scss you can do that as well with a theme override.\nSimply copy main.scss to your site's root and put it in /assets/css/. After all the @imports you could add your custom styles.\nOn build the theme SCSS will preprocess as usual and then tact on anything you add at the end.\nThis method is slightly fragile because if the theme ever adds/removes a SCSS partial you'd need to make that change to your local main.scss file. But that rarely happens so it shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nThe ideal situation would have a /_sass/_custom.scss file that you could override locally. Problem is the way Jekyll currently works you can't override a single static file in that way. Not sure if that will ever change but there is an issued opened for it.. Thanks @vwchu. I think this is looking good. Going to hold off merging it in as it will likely break some things. Ideally would do it at the same time as I gemify the theme but that likely won't happen for a bit as asset support hasn't been baked in fully.\nMost likely the next couple of major enhancements I roll in should be a good time to merge this.\n. Thanks.\n. @DanielSank They don't overwrite or concatenate, they're simply added to <body class=\"\"> on the post/page you assign a class name to in YAML Front Matter.\nAnd even when assigned they do nothing unless there is corresponding CSS for the classes somewhere.\n. @booksmile You're pushing to the wrong repo :wink:\n. A lot of that is from various PR's over the years and me not being as strict with merging.\nYour approach looks cleaner and takes up less code space, but I wonder if it abstracts too much and makes things harder to understand. Especially for those newer to Jekyll.\nI also wonder what sort of performance hit it introduces with all of the includes. I'm sure it's minor (probably about the same as base_path, but worth noting.\n. I'd like to err on the side of being more readable and simple to follow. I totally get the appeal of DRYing up the code, but in this case I think it makes it more complicated and hard to follow.\nI don't have any solid numbers but get the feeling a lot of people using the theme are new to Jekyll and web development... just from the amount of emails, tweets, and issues I get. So anything that makes it more obvious to the average user is A+ in my book. I've failed in a few spots at this trying to be clever or offer way too much choice at the cost of simplicity.\nIt's also one less piece of documentation that has to be written and read. If anyone wants to use the url include they'll have to open it up, and grok the code. Where with the current implimentation it's pretty easy to follow... if you know basic Liquid.\nI'm not so worried about maintainability as it's only in a few places.\nIf I had the foresight when the theme first dropped I wouldn't have forced the /images/ directory into the path. That really should have been part of the YAML Front Matter when assigning a feature image. Then all of the internal/external path Liquid spaghetti could have been harmonized into the same code.\n. @offensive You're pushing to the wrong repo.\n. Fantastic, thanks @martinliu. This will be merged in with the next release.\n. This one is actually pretty easy to fix. I purposely set type in relative units like ems and rems to globally scale font-sizes and white space up/down.\nInside of _reset.scss there's this line that bumps up the base font size from the default of 16px to 18px. Could easily add another breakpoint to go to 20px for larger screens.\nI'm not at my iMac currently, but if you wanted to test this minor change and see if it improves things that would be cool.\n``` diff\nhtml {\n  / apply a natural box layout model to all elements /\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  background-color: $background-color;\n  font-size: 16px;\n@include breakpoint($medium) {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n\n@include breakpoint($large) {\nfont-size: 20px;\n}\n\n-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\n  -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;\n}\n```\nIf type goes to large too quick might work better on $x-large instead.\n. Thanks @jhabdas! Merged into develop and will hit master in the next release.\n. If you take a look at the theme files you'll see that all of the nav links and asset paths are prepended with site.url + site.baseurl. If you don't change url in your _config.yml when testing locally it will use the production domain you set. This is noted in the docs.\n\nNote: It\u2019s important to remember that when testing locally you need to change the site.url, I recommend url: \"http://localhost:4000\" to keep paths pointing to local pages and assets. Ideally you\u2019d use multiple config files with bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml to apply development overrides.\n. Thanks @fa-ribeiro \n. The \"hero\" headers are fundamentally different, which is why you're observing differences in how they look.\n\nyaml\nheader:\n  image: image-filename.jpg\nDefault header.image uses a <img> element which has some CSS on it to scale it to fit the full width of the screen. The height scales proportionally to the width maintaining the image's aspect ration.\nyaml\nheader:\n  overlay_image: unsplash-image-1.jpg\nWhile header.overlay_image does not use an <img> element and instead adds it as a background-image to div.page__hero--overlay. Since that image is added via inline CSS it doesn't know what the aspect ratio of the image. It simply applies a background image to the parent container.\nIf more content is added to it making the container larger the image will appear taller. \n\nIf there's is less content it will appear shorter.\n\nWhat you can do is add CSS to apply a height to that container. This could become problematic as the height will vary at different screen sizes, and will be especially hard to maintain if your images all have different aspect ratios.\nI'm sure there is some sort of JavaScript magic you could apply, but that's out of scope of this theme.\n. This hasn't been merged into master yet but there was an enhancement to allow custom classes.\nThe way this will work is you assign custom class names to a post or page's YAML Front Matter like so:\nyaml\nclasses:\n  - your-class-name\nThis will add your-class-name to the <body> element. Allowing you to specifically target the overlay with a selector like .your-class-name .page__hero--overlay, and then adding whatever CSS you need to style it.\nI should be merging this into master shortly.\n. My bad. It was merged in. Too many themes too many issues too many PR, hard to keep it all straight :stuck_out_tongue: \nYou can't add inline CSS via Front Matter. You either have to add <style>your css</style> as part of the post/page's content or add those classes to main stylesheet.\nThe later is probably the better option. I'd create your own custom .scss, place it in _sass and then @import it into /assets/css/main.scss.\nRE: 2. I get why that would be odd. Because of how the background images are assigned that's really the only option as you can't do it in _page.scss as that file doesn't read a post or page's YAML Front Matter.\nNot saying it's an ideal option but it's certainly one of the more common approaches. Back when \"art directed\" posts were all the rage a few years ago that's how a lot of people did it eg: custom class overrides in the body of a post.\nThe custom classes take priority depending on the \"cascade\", hence the name CascadingStyleSheets. If you add a height or colors to .your-custom-class .whatever, it will take priority over .whatever because it of specificity. There are sites devoted to the topic that will explain it better than I can.\n. The present system isn't meant to be a full on custom CSS for every post/page slution. The theme isn't built for that nor will it ever be.\nIt's merely adding the ability to add custom classes to the body to use a simple JS hooks or to style an element here and there. If you're looking to inject custom CSS into every page to change title colors or anything else then the better solution would be to add your own custom Liquid to the `_layouts.\nI have yet to see a DRY approach to this problem. It's possible if you're doing something simple like wanting an inverted style for every element to improve light on dark then sure. But if you're looking to do more than all bets are off unless you want to build a custom CSS file for every post/page.\n\nAnd no, you can't currently do that with the way Jekyll reads assets. What you're looking to do is really not possible (well not easily at least). You'd essentially need to evaluate the Sass file(s) against every post/page to pull in YAML Front Matter to do what you want. And that likely wouldn't work as each post/page would just end up overwriting each other unless you're naming classes specifically.\nMy understanding of Jekyll is that isn't something done out of the box. You can ask around on talk.jekyllrb.com but without a custom plugin I think you are out of luck.\n\nTwo solutions I can think of, both of which involve you customizing layouts and includes to bend it to your will. Not something I'm interested in adding to the theme as it opens the doors to a million and one customizations as everyone will want something different. But if you're interested here's what you could do:\nOption 1\nJam custom variables in _config.yml which are accessible from the site object. /assets/css/main.scss could then pull from those as it is processed by Jekyll. Any of the partials would not though since they don't contain YAML Front Matter and are treated by Jekyll as static assets.\nA real simple example:\n_config.yml:\nyaml\ncustom-var1: green\n/assets/css/main.scss:\nscss\n.my-custom-var1 {\n  color: site.custom-var1;\n}\nOption 2\nEdit layouts and includes adding conditional statements where you want to apply customizations.\nExample:\nSay you want to change the post title's color using a value specified in it's YAML Front Matter.\npost/page YAML:\nyaml\ntitle-color: green\nAnd then modify the template:\nhtml\n<h1 class=\"page__title\" {% if page.title-color %}style color: \"{{ page.title-color }};\"{% endif %}>\nAs you can see this has the potential to turn into a maintenance nightmare.\nAgain this is probably something that is super out of scope with this theme and dips more into \"how to use Jekyll\" land. I'd read out on talk.jekyllrb.com or Stackoverflow. Perhaps there are others who have a better solution.\n. > Of course not. You must get a lot of people expecting your theme to solve all the world's problems...\nNaturally :wink:\n. Thanks @alistaircom \n. Thanks for taking it for a spin @DirtyF :smile:\nYou're right, documentation and example side of things definitely needs to be built out more. Specifically from a jekyll new perspective as there's a few things that need to be changed to get things looking right.\nThe biggie that I left off from my quick blog post last night, was about replacing index.html with the modified version MM uses. The home page will appear messed up if the one created by jekyll new is used.\nThere's also the layout names that need adjusting layout: post or layout: page should be layout: single in MM-land.\nWas thinking of possibly creating some \"alias\" _layouts to ease the transition, example:\n_layouts/post.html\n``` yaml\nlayout: single\n```\nBut not sure if that is overkill or not.\nEvery theme dev does things a little different so still trying to decide on what's the best practice here. Probably stick with what minima adopts as it will set the precedent for others to follow...\n. @DirtyF I've always been partial to how Wordpress names templates.\nhttps://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/\ndefault, post, page make a lot of sense and are probably the most commonly named Jekyll layouts. I went with single as there was a lot of code overlap that I could DRY up combining into one layout.\n. @broccolini That all makes sense and is pretty much what I do (or plan to do).\nI think were things start to fall apart are _layout names. Default jekyll new expects default.html, post.html, and page.html. And because those are the defaults a good majority of theme devs adopted those names.\nWhere it gets iffy is switching between themes. If everyone uses different naming errors start creeping up. I use a few different names and document that, but most people don't read docs.\nI was thinking that maybe some sort of \"alias\" layout that uses the default names could be a way around this. I suppose this is a larger question for the community to settle on best practices to keep things as seamless as possible when switching out themes.\n. @ashmaroli That could potentially work but requires users to update all of their content to have layout: {{ site.layouts.posts }}.\nWould be a fine solution going forward, if you could get all theme devs on the same page. But I'm guessing that's going to be a hard sell unless it's baked into the default jekyll new behavior.\nI'm not too worried about either way as I encourage users to use YAML Front Matter defaults to set layouts and keep it out of the actual content.\nThe problem is more for jekyll new users or someone coming from another theme who don't bother reading the docs on changing the layouts and get an error with jekyll serve.\n. Sounds good @ashmaroli. Really excited for the assets theme folder PR to release. All of the new gem related theme stuff is such an improvement!\n. That is fantastic @fa-ribeiro, thanks for taking it for a spin! That's exactly how I was envisioning a fresh install of the theme to go and glad to hear it worked out.\nHopefully I can ship soon. All that's in my way is waiting on Jekyll core and github-page to merge in a few things and :confetti_ball: \n. Also I'd like to add that I pushed the MM gem so it can be referenced directly in Gemfile instead of via its GH branch.\ndiff\n-  gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch => \"feature/theme-gem\"\n+  gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", \"~> 4.0', '>= 4.0.1\"\n. @bafonso That's correct. When you use the theme as a gem (or remote theme) you won't \"see\" any of the layout, include, asset files in your repo. Those are pulled in directly from the gem.\nSee Jekyll's documentation on how they work for more info.\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes. Not through any settings no. But if you're up for hacking the theme a little you can easily add post dates to archive listings. \nTake a look at archive-single.html\nYou essentially need to add {{ page.date }} to that _include where you want the date. On the same line as the read time would be my suggestion.\n. This isn't something theme related so I'm going to close it. \nBut what you want is to use .htaccess redirects if you have control over the server you're hosting with.\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/htaccess/301-redirects/\nOr if you're hosting with GitHub use the bundled Jekyll redirect plugin to set them up.\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from\n. I've only ever used .htaccess 301 redirects so not much help.\nIn my limited testing the Jekyll redirect plugin worked as advertised. Since I have nothing to do with plugin I'd suggest submitting an issue there. Provide examples and a public Jekyll repo so they can reproduce the issue and help troubleshoot otherwise you'll likely never get resolution.\n. Hard to tell what was fixed. Can you be a little more specific on what the issue is this PR addresses? \nIf you could also make changes to the source JS files as well as the compiled main.min.js file it would appreciated.\n. Completed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/4.0.4\n. Link to a repo so I can troubleshoot? Most likely it's a content or config problem on your end.\n. Config looks fine. Could be content or something else but since I can't see that to test hard to say. \n. Also just noticed you're using the feature/theme-gem version of the theme. Since it's not officially released it's possible there's a bug in there, but I'd be surprised if that was the case as the layouts haven't been modified.\nWhat happens if you pull down the latest stable release and drop in the contents of your _posts folder?\nSince it's working fine on the demo site I have a suspicion there's something going on with the theme in gem form. Or site.related_posts is being picky on what posts it determines are related. On the demo site for example there are a few posts that don't display any related items even though related: true.\n. Did some testing of my own and there are some posts in the demo site that don't show related posts even though they should. Adding {{ site.related_posts | inspect }} to _layouts/single.html shows outputs:\nthis for a post with related\n[#<Jekyll::Document _posts/2016-02-24-welcome-to-jekyll.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2013-08-16-markup-syntax-highlighting.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2013-05-22-markup-more-images.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2013-01-11-markup-html-tags-and-formatting.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2013-01-10-markup-image-alignment.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2013-01-09-markup-text-alignment.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2013-01-05-markup-title-with-special-characters.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2013-01-05-markup-title-with-markup.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2012-05-22-markup-text-readability.md collection=posts>, #<Jekyll::Document _posts/2012-03-15-layout-sidebar-custom.md collection=posts>]\nand this for ones without\nnil\nI don't really know how Jekyll determines what is related and what isn't but for that appears to be where the bug or problem is. I suspect it's content related but not sure why that would matter. Sites like @jhabdas's appears to work just fine so it doesn't appear to be the theme's fault.\nWhere it gets even stranger is only the most 4 recent posts on the demo site show related posts. I took the most recent post  (which is showing related posts), changed the date so it became the last post in the list, and the related posts disappeared.\nThought maybe limit: 4 has something to do with it in this line {% for post in site.related_posts limit:4 %} so I took that out too, and it made no difference.\nI'm really stumped here. Only thing I can think of would be to not use site.related_posts and instead use site.posts and filter on tags/categories instead to fake \"related posts\".\n. @jhabdas I'm stumped why it's working fine for you but not the MM's demo site. I wrote the damn thing and I can't figure out what's going wrong :sweat_smile: \nIt's really strange. After the 4th most recent post they stop showing. I thought maybe it was working for you because you're using a newer Jekyll gem, but looks like it's the older GitHub Pages one.\nAnd in @fa-ribeiro's case their using the latest Jekyll off of master.\nSo strange!\n. @jhabdas That's what I was thinking. If it's a widespread issue and not something to do with a weird content edge-case I'm surprised I hadn't heard about yet.\nRE: Hugo. I've looked at it and considered switching my personal site over just because it takes so long to build. Everyone always says it builds faster than Jekyll when you have a lot of posts but it would be a crap ton of work for me to rebuild just to test that. So I haven't. PR's like this give me faith Jekyll's build speed will improve.\nI've made a lot of improvements pulling out anything that isn't strictly for converting .md files into .html files, and that helped a lot.\nNot to mention I didn't really care for the template syntax. It's close enough to Liquid sure, but it just looks ugly to me.\n. I believe there may be a bug in Jekyll core and how it handles related posts.\nThe theme is using this to output 4 related posts, which is wrapped in a conditional that only shows the module when there are related posts and the feature is enabled.\n{% for post in site.related_posts limit:4 %}\n  {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %}\n{% endfor %}\nWhen I remove limit:4 from the for loop related posts works again, but it shows 10 related posts (which is the default behavior). For whatever reason the limit is limiting it to the first 4 posts of the site, instead of limiting it to showing 4 related posts on a given post... if that makes sense.\nFor example the 4 most recent posts show related posts fine, but when you hit say the 5th post there are no related posts shown. The limit:4 is affecting that when it really shouldn't.\nThere's probably another way to limit the amount of related posts shown that I'll investigate to get around the issue.\n\nAs far as what related_posts uses to parse, I'm not entirely sure. Because GitHub Pages disables LSI (latent semantic indexing) I'm pretty sure it outputs an array of the 10 most recent posts, which makes the whole thing pointless. On my personal site I use a plugin that provides better matches for this reason.\n. I came up with a way of showing \"related posts\" by like post.tags instead of using the built in site.related_posts array.\nThe advantage here is you actually get a different set of related posts on each post instead of just the \"most recent\" posts that currently happens due to LSI being disabled on GitHub Pages.\nUsing this spaghetti code of Liquid in _layouts/single.html will display related posts that share the same tags as the current post. It will show 1-4 posts depending on how many matches it finds.\nhtml\n {% comment %}<!-- show posts by related tags when `related: true` -->{% endcomment %}\n  {% if page.related %}\n    {% assign n_posts = 0 %}\n    {% for post in site.posts %}\n      {% if post.id == page.id %}{% continue %}{% endif %}\n      {% for this_tag in page.tags %}\n          {% if post.tags contains this_tag %}\n            {% if n_posts == 0 %}\n              <div class=\"page__related\">\n                {% if site.data.ui-text[site.locale].related_label %}\n                  <h4 class=\"page__related-title\">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].related_label | default: \"You May Also Enjoy\" }}</h4>\n                {% endif %}\n                <div class=\"grid__wrapper\">\n            {% endif %}\n            {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %}\n            {% assign n_posts = n_posts | plus: 1 %}\n            {% break %}\n          {% endif %}\n      {% endfor %}\n      {% if n_posts > 3 %}{% break %}{% endif %}\n    {% endfor %}\n    {% if n_posts > 0 %}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    {% endif %}\n  {% endif %}\nThoughts?\n. @icicimov Great! Yeah I think related posts by tags does a better job of conveying \"related posts\" than whatever basic method the default uses.\n. @justinrummel No. This is still open as I haven't found a fix. \nIf you're using the gem version remove all local  _layouts, _includes, and _sass folders and files. Unless of course you want them to override the ones bundled in the gem.. I've always used LSI but pretty sure it's disabled on sites hosted with GitHub Pages. The best solution ice found is using a related post plugin that improves on the one built into Jekyll. But that's sadly not an option for the vast amount of people hosting the theme on GH. \n\n\nJekyll Related Posts plugin. I came up with a different solution that uses a post tags to compare against and show related posts that way. It can be tested from PR #978 or by copying these two files to your _layouts and _includes folder.\n\n\n_layouts/single.html\n\n_includes/page_related.html. @justinrummel doesn't look like anything is missing to me. All of the relevant open-graph meta, Twitter cards data, etc. are there.\n\nI get why you'd think something is missing from all of the white-space, but that is due to Liquid. For example that chunk of white-space before the <title> tag are all Liquid assign tags that don't actually output anything, but when read by Jekyll output as blank lines.\n```\n{% if site.url %}\n  {% assign seo_url = site.url | append: site.baseurl %}\n{% endif %}\n{% assign seo_url = seo_url | default: site.github.url %}\n{% if page.title %}\n  {% assign seo_title = page.title | append: \" \" | append: site.title_separator | append: \" \" | append: site.title %}\n{% endif %}\n{% if seo_title %}\n  {% assign seo_title = seo_title | markdownify | strip_html | strip_newlines | escape_once %}\n{% endif %}\n{% if site.url %}\n  {% assign canonical_url = page.url | replace: \"index.html\", \"\" | prepend: site.url %}\n{% endif %}\n```\nThat's the case for a lot of the white-space and is completely normal... messy sure... but that's a Liquid issue and not the theme. HTML minification cleans that right up if you enable it.\n. @justinrummel  <meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ seo_description }}\"> is an omission and should be there. Happy to look at a PR to add it in.\nkeywords is useless and potentially harmful as it's been abused in the past by spammers. It's a general best practice not to use it.\nWhat is the value of adding meta name=\"author\"? I haven't seen it used in many places. Most of the SEO include is lifted from the Jekyll SEO plugin which doesn't use it either.\n. @justinrummel I originally had compress enabled with the theme but it caused several issues so I turned it off. In most causes it should work fine.\n. Can you submit this against develop branch instead of master? It helps with merging and deploying new releases.\n. Thanks @justinrummel \n. It's working as intended, although when you run Jekyll locally it defaults to the development environment, which disables compress.\nIf you want to see how your pages will minify you need to run Jekyll in production.\nbundle exec JEKYLL_ENV=production serve\nOr if you're on Windows\nset JEKYLL_ENV=production\nbundle exec jekyll serve\nWhen deploying to GitHub Pages you don't have to worry about setting the JEKYLL_ENV variable to production as it does it for you.\nThe compress documentation doesn't really mention all this well, so it's easy to miss if you're unfamiliar with how Jekyll runs.\n. Could be a nice compliment to the gallery helper. If you want to work on a PR that would be cool. I'd suggest trying to use some of the same variable names to keep things consistent.\n. Links in the left sidebar have to be manually created.\n\nThe theme uses Kramdown's automatic table of contents feature which builds an un-ordered list out of headings used in your Markdown file. When using the {% include toc %} helper, a table contents is created and floats to the right of your main content.\n\n. @robssit you're pushing to the wrong repo :wink:\n. It's your defaults. You have a duplicate defaults key right before the pages scope. Remove that line. YAML is a picky thing.\n. Should read like this instead. The dupe defaults line  was replacing the first occurrence which is why none of your post defaults were taking.\nyaml\ndefaults:\n  # _posts\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      author_profile: true\n      read_time: true\n      comments: true\n      share: true\n      related: true\n  # _pages\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: pages\n    values:\n      layout: single\n. Maybe there's something with your Markdown that Jekyll's post excerpt function doesn't like. It's parsing the entire post as a single object instead of grabbing just the first paragraph and then truncating that.\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#post-excerpts\nI typically do headings like this\n``` md\nMy Heading\n```\nversus\n```\nMy heading\n\n```\nSo could be something there with spacing that may trip up parsing, as I see this note in Kramdown's docs.\n\nAn edge case worth mentioning is the following:\nheader\n---\npara\nOne might ask if this represents two paragraphs separated by a horizontal rule or a second level header and a paragraph. As suggested by the wording in the example, the latter is the case. The general rule is that Setext headers are processed before horizontal rules.\nhttp://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#headers\n\nHave you tried manually adding a post separator after the first paragraph? You can also define the post's excerpt in its YAML Front Matter which will override Jekyll's automatically generated excerpt.\nyaml\nexcerpt: \"You post excerpt goes here that will override the one generated by Jekyll off of the first paragraph of content.\"\n. Unlikely this was causing the issue, but found something you might want to fix with your code block Markdown in that post.\n1. Think HTTP should be lowercase, according to what languages Rouge supports for applying syntax highlighting.\nIt's showing on the page without syntax highlighting.\n\nChanging to this:\n``` http\n---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\nMIIFJjCCBA6gAwIBAgIRAPQyFuvXTYP/N2gOhG540kUwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEFBQAw\n...\n\n. Nope. Theme purposely leaves out any content. Adding your own _posts, pages, collections, images, etc. is your job and should be one of the first things you do next to configuring everything.\n. As far as I can tell what's causing this in Safari is the animated lines that stretch below each link on :hover. Removing the transform: scaleX() declarations that makes the effect work causes the issue to disappear.\nWill have to investigate why that property appears to play with anti-aliasing on the type which causes the flicker. Looks like some sort of rendering bug with the browser, so hopefully there's a way around it.\n. Possible fixes to try:\n- Add -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d; to the elements that are flickering.\n- Add -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; to the elements that are\n  flickering.\nref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15751012/css-transform-causes-flicker-in-safari-but-only-when-the-browser-is-2000px-w\n. Update. The fix is replacing transform: scaleX(0) with transform: scaleX(0) translate3d(0, 0, 0);.\ndiff\n.greedy-nav .visibile-links a:before {\n  ...\n-  -webkit-transform: scaleX(0);\n-  -ms-transform: scaleX(0);\n-  transform: scaleX(0);\n+  -webkit-transform: scaleX(0) translate3d(0, 0 , 0);\n+  -ms-transform: scaleX(0) translate3d(0, 0 , 0);\n+  transform: scaleX(0) translate3d(0, 0 , 0);\n}\n. This isn't really a theme issue, it's related to the github-pages gem and other gems it depends on. \nI haven't seen these particular errors before, but have seen similar related to the jekyll-github-metadata gem used by GitHub Pages.\nI don't know much about how that gem works other than it helps populate some site variables that GitHub Pages hosted sites can leverage. Setting repository in your _config.yml does most of the heavy lifting as does setting origin on your site's remote to a github.com URL.\nSince you're not hosting with GitHub then there's no reason for you to use it I would assume. Here's what I would do:\nStep 1. In your Gemfile replace gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins with gem \"jekyll\" and add all of the Jekyll plugins used in your _config.yml (they're under gems:). You need to do this because github-pages automatically installs them and the vanilla jekyll gem does not.\nYou'll end up with something like this:\n``` ruby\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"jekyll\"\ngem \"wdm\", \"~> 0.1.0\" if Gem.win_platform?\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem 'octopress'\n  gem 'jekyll-archives'\n  gem 'jekyll-twitter-plugin'\n  gem 'jekyll-lunr-js-search'\n  gem 'jekyll-paginate'\n  gem 'jekyll-sitemap'\n  gem 'jekyll-gist'\n  gem 'jekyll-feed'\n  gem 'jemoji'\nend\n```\nStep 2. Run bundle update\nStep 3. Run bundle exec jekyll s -c _config.yml,_AccessKeys.yml,_localhost.yml and see if everything works. If you get any errors about missing gems add them to your Gemfile, bundle install, and try to fire up Jekyll again. There may be a gem or two that github-pages loaded as a dependency that jekyll does not.\nOptional? You can probably safely remove repository: justinrummel/jr.com-mm from _config.yml.\n. Good good.\n. Something is up with your Resources collection as it's not even building those pages. I'm not seeing anything obviously wrong so not sure what's going on there.\n. I built your site locally and the resource pages built. There's some issues you need to fix though.\n1. /resources throws a 404 because an index.html doesn't exist for it.  resources/intro and resources/setting-up-project build though as they're in your collection.\n\nYou have some bad YAML in navigation.yml which is breaking the sidebar links and styling. Remove the hyphens from url lines to clear that up. Should be:\n``` yaml\nAbel navigation links\nresources:\n  - title: Working with Abel\n    children: \n      - title: \"Introduction\"\n        url: /resources/intro/\n      - title: \"Setting up a project\"\n        url: /resources/setting-up-project/\n```\nWhich will give you the working sidebar.\n\n. Not sure. When I cloned your repo the resources collection build fine for me, minus the sidebar issues due to the extra hyphens.\n. Looks good and fits in well with the gallery helper. I'll see about merging this in when I do the next release of the theme. Currently working on a few things to make the switch over to a gemified version of the theme and I'd like to include this with that release.\n. Looks like Jekyll core may get a native filter to do something similar. https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5560\n. I made a small change and renamed the helper from image to figure to be more semantic. The PR has been merged c4252b09afaf5794d52248b34352b2c2e6c10336 and will show up in the next theme release.\nThanks for your work on this.\n. What exact CSS changes did you make so I can get a feel for what you tried.\nAlso a screenshot of what it looked like would be helpful. \n. I'm not at my computer to fully dig into the code but I'd suggest right clicking the white box and hit \"inspect\" to fire up your browser's web dev tools. It'll tell you exactly what the element or class is so you can search for it in the Sass partials to edit. That's my go to method for debugging CSS.\nI suspect it's this line in _sass/_navigations.scss related to the \"greedy nav\" used in the masthead.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/_navigation.scss#L178\n. Exactly what @justinrummel said. GitHub enabled https awhile back and if you don't use that in url, assets will be served insecurely throwing those mixed content warnings in Chrome and other browsers.\n. Yes this is definitely a bug. I recently fixed it in an unreleased version of the theme https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/50d4b1b9a8eb4922aa6e8498b5b8f2c9ca52eae5. The fix is actually quite simple.\nWhat you want to do is wrap the author.avatar bit in _includes/author-profile.html with a Liquid conditional that checks if there is an avatar image.\nWrap <div class=\"author__avatar\"></div> like so and you should be all set.\nhtml\n  {% if author.avatar %}\n  <div class=\"author__avatar\">\n    {% if author.avatar contains \"://\" %}\n        <img src=\"{{ author.avatar }}\" alt=\"{{ author.name }}\">\n    {% else %}\n        <img src=\"{{ author.avatar | prepend: \"/images/\" | prepend: base_path }}\" class=\"author__avatar\" alt=\"{{ author.name }}\">\n    {% endif %}\n  </div>\n  {% endif %}\nNow when avatar is blank you won't get the empty <img> element on the page with alt showing the author name... making it look like it's duplicated.\n. Thanks for the PR!. Looks like you're using baseurl: /blog is this correct? If so I don't think Jekyll includes that property into post_url. Try prepending it.\n{% post_url 2015-11-13-GlusterFS-internals | prepend: site.baseurl %}\nOr you could do:\n{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-11-13-GlusterFS-internals %}\nAs this isn't a theme issue and is a general \"how to use Jekyll\" question I'm going to close it. If you need further help with post_url I'd suggest filing an issue on the jekyll/jekyll repo or ask for help on talk.jekyllrb.com\n. Good catch. I'll have to double check by pretty sure I'm not using #comments anywhere so it could easily be removed from the <section> element.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/3a7dd49734ecb14d564350ec7602c98297a953b027 and will be in the next release of MM\n. I've considered it but it takes more than just some theme changes I'm afraid. To do it right you really need a plugin that can do some of the heavy lifting for you:\n- RegEx over your content and replace img elements (and the like) with amp ones\n- Generate amp pages of all your content\nI'm much more in favor of making the site as optimized as possible without being too opinionated with the defaults. Especially since there are a few things AMP doesn't really do yet or have specs for (e.g. navigation menus). \nFor more context I hammered out some thoughts on the subject here.\n. There's no Jekyll magic here, favicons are loaded like you would for any other site (e.g. placing favicon.ico in your site's root). \nOn the theme demo site I used http://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate all of the sized icons from a single file, placed them in assets/images and then added the html it spit out to the _includes/head/custom.html\nThere's a bunch of ways to approach it, which you can search around for if the favicon generator I linked to above doesn't meet your needs.\n. Not sure what the P is you're referring to. The theme doesn't ship with a\ndefault favicon so if you're seeing one it's from your web host being\ndefined at the server level... Not the theme.\nOn Thursday, October 13, 2016, Jocelyn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThank you! If I don't want a favicon can I change the P to another letter?\nor is the P a default favicon?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/585#issuecomment-253578624,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABUB7W_6lyWNkXziSPx_mPjOwjpv0hRyks5qzmfngaJpZM4KWFhy\n.\n. @kylemanna Sorry haven't had much time to look at this. I think it might be a breaking change that I'd likely hold off on till I roll out the Gemified version of the theme.\n\nReason I think it may be a breaker is due to adding the canonical URL instead of letting Disqus determine the page URL itself. I haven't tested it, but if those values are different then it's going to break things for users.\nMeaning if they have existing comments for a page and the canonical URL is different their comments will disappear, unless they want to use Disqus' migration tool.\nI've been bit by this one a few times when changing things related to permalinks so just want to make sure it doesn't cause a ruckus.\n. That sounds like a good way to approach it. As long as it doesn't overly complicate things making it harder to maintain then I say go for it.\n. @icicimov I don't have first-hand experience with Lunr but have used similar solutions. The instructions on  that repo seem pretty good but if you need more of a \"tutorial\" there's quite a few if you search around.\n- http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/\n- http://rayhightower.com/blog/2016/01/04/how-to-make-lunrjs-jekyll-work-together/\n- http://katydecorah.com/code/lunr-and-jekyll/\n- http://scotthorsfield.me/technology/2016/01/21/Searching-Jekyll-Post-and-Page-Content-with-lunr-js/\nI'll echo what @justinrummel said about build times. I haven't read Lunr docs to know if this is true but I would assume it works by querying a .json index file with all of your post data in it. Depending on the complexity of that is what makes build times go up. \nOther Jekyll search solutions I've used had you build a .json file that loops over every post and then you can pull out things like post titles, post excerpts, etc. If Lunr is dumping the full content of every post that would certainly increase the bloat.\n. @twhite96 I think the issue is your JavaScript. If you fire up the console in your browser you'll see a bunch of errors. That's why the hamburger menu isn't working.\n. @twhite96 Looking at your Gemfile.lock you're using some outdated gems... eg. Jekyll isn't the latest. So I would bundle update to make sure you're current.\nAnd you're using the theme-gem along with having all of the _layouts, and _includes with your repo. And when you do that your local versions overwrite anything in the bundled theme gem, which could be why you're getting missing layout errors.\nIf you're using the theme gem then remove _layouts, _includes, _sass, etc... unless of course you modified any of those files and want them to replace whats in the default theme.\nOr if you're not using the theme gem just remove theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll from your _config.yml. @icicimov As others have gotten this to work I'm going to close it out. If you have additional information to provide to help resolve it feel free to re-open.. When running Jekyll locally you need to change url: http://localhost:4000 in _config.yml otherwise it'll use your domain instead and load the CSS there. That's why you're not seeing your changes.\n. Yes that's normal. The more posts the longer the generation time. My personal site takes minutes to build so count yourself lucky yours is in there seconds.\n. What are the read time changes about? Doesn't seem related to the date time format config.\n. You'll want to replace {{ post.excert }} with {{ post.content }}. The index pages use _includes/archive-single.html which is where you'll want to make the modification.\nChange this line:\nhtml\n{% if post.excerpt %}<p class=\"archive__item-excerpt\" itemprop=\"description\">{{ post.excerpt | markdownify | strip_html | truncate: 160 }}</p>{% endif %}\nto this:\nhtml\n{{ post.content }}\nAnd it should do what you want. You may need to do additional styling since the theme wasn't built to support full post content on the archive pages.\n. See the docs. Having it concatenated and minified into main.min.js requires a build step.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/javascript/\n. Will have to think about it. My intention for the sidebars weren't as full blown navigation components... but I get the appeal of using them that way. Kind of set myself up for it when I built it specifically for the theme docs.\nPerhaps could do something similar to what I've done on my personal site. When the screen size collapses down the nav list turns into a toggle.\n\n. Merged in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/cdf5877acc9a54760768f594cda2d540b2d17886\nWill show up in the next release of MM.\n\n. I don't know what the issue is but those errors suggest it has to do with github-metadata and not the theme. \nI'd file an issue there and see if they can help.\n. Simple. It's included with the global style sheet to eliminate the extra HTTP request which has performance benefits. I won't argue that using a CDN version of FA or jQuery, or any other assets have their merit.\nIt mostly boils down to me liking the idea of including those dependencies directly in the project rather than hotlinking to a bunch of external hosts.\n. This is out of scope for the theme.\nYou could use a plugin to do multi-language posts/pages/collections if you're not hosting with GitHub Pages.\n- https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-language-plugin\n- https://github.com/octopress/multilingual\nOtherwise you can follow the advise of this tutorial to implement it.\n- https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/\n. Editing Jekyll templates in an elegant way is kind of an oxymoron :wink: You either edit the files directly or you don't. Well not completely true... \nIf you're using the gemified version of the theme (currently in beta) you can add your own files that will override the default _layouts, _includes, and _sass files provided with the theme.\nYou get the benefit of customizing the files how you want and not having to worry about upgrading as it's as simple as gem update minimal-mistakes-theme. \nUnfortunately you have to be on Jekyll 3.3 and it doesn't currently work with GitHub Pages hosted sites since 3rd party gem themes (other than minima) aren't supported yet. So it's not a solution for everyone.\nAlso, if you want to add content before the footer the theme ships with an include to do that. It's blank by default, but you can populate with whatever HTML you want.\n- _includes/footer/custom.html -- injects right before footer.html (good for adding banner ads and the like)\n- _includes/head/custom.html -- injects right after head.html (good for adding favicon images and the like)\n. Yes\nOn Wednesday, October 26, 2016, Alexander Lenail notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nOkay, assuming I'm using gh-pages, and I want to add an image in the\nmiddle of the footer, I should just edit the footer.html file in that case?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/615#issuecomment-256517690,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABUB7bdsgmkP_1HsaL-GWYbZMoXly8GHks5q3_UigaJpZM4Khi2M\n.\n. I agree this is a good idea as far as optimizing your site. I've done this with previous incarnations of the theme and then requests start coming in to add all the icons back.\n\nThe issue is people like to use them in their posts, change the table of contents icon, put in menus, etc.\nThe better solution is if you're only using that limited set you pull them out yourself and trim down the CSS and font files vs. doing it globally at the theme level.\nEven better you don't use Font Awesome at all and instead go with a SVG icon solution (I've done this with my personal blog) to get even more performance out of your pages.\nI'm trying to provide a middle ground with the theme and expect the users who care about #webperf will take the intuitive to further optimize their site. I don't want to take things too far as it can make customizing the site harder for those who aren't developers and understand how all this works.\n. @hakeryk2 You can use something like IcoMoon. It'll let you add various font sets (eg. Font Awesome) and allow you to select which icons you want. Then it generates the font files and CSS that you could replace with what is included with the theme already.. You're missing the tags.md page. Create that and tag links will work.\nConsult the archive settings portion of the docs for more info. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#archive-settings\n. Thanks @ozdemirburak \n. It's all done through CSS. More specifically Sass and a set of mixins provided by Susy. The best tip I can give you is turn on the web developer tools of whatever browser you're using and start inspecting elements on the page (right click... tap inspect element).\n\nYou'll quickly see what elements have what styles on them and then you can dig deeper into the .scss partials by searching by those class names.\nIn the case of the archive grid__item classes you can find them here in _sass/_archives.scss\n``` scss\n@include breakpoint($small) {\n    @include gallery(5 of 10);\n    .archive__item-teaser {\n      max-height: 200px;\n    }\n  }\n@include breakpoint($medium) {\n    margin-left: 0; / reset before mixin does its thing/\n    margin-right: 0; / reset before mixin does its thing/\n    @include gallery(2.5 of 10);\n.archive__item-teaser {\n  max-height: 120px;\n}\n\n.archive__item-excerpt {\n  display: block;\n  font-size: $type-size-6;\n}\n\n}\n```\nWhat's going on here is, there are several breakpoints (starts with the smallest width and builds up) that use Susy's gallery mixin to do some math and calculate the widths, add floats, margins, etc.\nOn $small screens: @include gallery(5 of 10); means span this element across 5 columns of a 10 column grid, eg. 1/2th of the parent container (2 items in a row).\nOn $medium and up screens: @include gallery(2.5 of 10); means span this element across 2.5 columns of a 10 column grid, eg. 1/4th of the parent container (4 items in a row)\nIf you want to fit more or less items in a row you'll need to change those values.\n. Not a bug, it's related to how you have Jekyll setup. You're using site.paginator twice and Jekyll Paginate only allows one instance of it.\nYou're using it on your home page at <site root>/index.html and also in _pages/blog/index.html. I'd suggest changing your home page to:\nhtml\n{% for post in site.posts limit:3 %}\n  {% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\nwhich will show the 3 most recent posts (which you're essentially doing now), and then on your blog page all of the posts will show with pagination.\nAnd then move _pages/blog/index.html to <site root>/blog/index.html. For whatever reason those need to be in the root and not stuffed into a _pages folder.\nAfter that your blog page should appear as you want.\n\nYou also have some layout issues with pages in your root folder posts.html and tags.html. They're calling for layout: post-index which doesn't exist. Check the errors Jekyll produces on bundle exec jekyll build for more info.\n. I'd file an issue on jekyll-paginate as it's related to that plugin and not the theme. It has been deprecated though. My understanding is it has some problems.\nI've never tried to paginate a non-homepage before so that could explain the strange behavior.\n. sidebar.text fully supports Markdown so whatever you can do there you can add to that variable and it'll be parsed. No feature enhancement required :smile:\nFor example:\nyaml\nsidebar:\n  - title: \"Title\"\n    image: http://placehold.it/350x250\n    image_alt: \"image\"\n    text: \"If you put **Markdown** in here it will parse, so you can do things like [link out](http://www.google.com). If you want to break up a line you can do this\\r\\n\\r\\nto insert a hard return. And even apply a button style:\\r\\n\\r\\n[to a link](#){: .btn .btn--success}\"\nWill build as:\nhtml\n<img src=\"http://placehold.it/350x250\" alt=\"image\">\n<h3>Title</h3>\n<p>If you put <strong>Markdown</strong> in here it will parse, so you can do things like <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">link out</a>. If you want to break up a line you can do this</p>\n<p>to insert a hard return. And even apply a button style:</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn btn--success\">to a link</a></p>\nAnd look like:\n\n. You had the right idea trying to change the source order of the jQuery mobile CSS file, it definitely is overriding some of the theme's styles like <a> text color and the background due to the cascade.\nTo do it right I think you'll have to add just the styles for the accordion and stay away from anything that might impact the theme globally. But if you're not all that familiar with CSS that can be tricky.\nMaybe try a simpler accordion. There's a fairly well supported \"checkbox\" accordion you can hack together that doesn't require any sort of JavaScript. It's purely CSS.\nI use a version of it on my personal site to do a collapsible \"Table of Content\" (example: https://mademistakes.com/articles/using-jekyll-2016/)\nThere's several examples with code on Codepen.io if you want to try that method instead.\nhttp://codepen.io/search/pens?q=accordion%20css&limit=all&order=popularity&depth=everything&show_forks=false\n. Yes you'll likely need to wrap HTML <div markdown=\"1\"></div> in your Markdown file if Kramdown doesn't parse it correctly. It usually has trouble with indented HTML because it treats it like a blockquote or code block. Usually takes some trial and error to get that all sorted.\nAnd yes that's the correct way to approach getting the accordion (or any other CSS modules you add) into the main stylesheet. Just add it as _whatever.scss to the _sass folder then @import it in /assets/css/main.scss.\nIt's perfectly fine to just change a .css file to .scss without making any other changes. That's one of the benefits of using SCSS over SASS. It's just standard CSS... where you can add all the extra stuff like variables, mixins, etc.\n. Closing this issue as it appears to be addressed. If not feel free to re-open.. Check your _config.yml, pretty sure you have url set improperly. You're missing the protocol. Try:\nyaml\nurl: http://ageof.info\n. Glad it turned out to be a simple fix.\n. Pushed to the wrong repo :wink:\n. Didn't have any plans to add something like this. My thinking is it would be better served as something you add yourself rather than me including it in the theme. Trying to keep things down to the minimal instead of adding niche components like these.\n. No option. Just remove these two lines of CSS in /_sass/_pages.scss\n. Since all of those use the intro animation, if you remove that from _animations.scss the animations will stop. Then you don't have to bother removing animation: intro 0.3s both that is sprinkled around the rest of the stylesheet.\nIf yo're using the forked method just comment out @import \"animations\"; in /assets/css/main.scss.\nIf you're using the gem theme then add a blank _animations.scss to /_sass/_animations.scss and it will override the one bundled in the gem --- effectively disabling all of the animations.\n. I'm afraid that's the reality when you want to customize your site and diverge from the canonical version of the theme.\nYou're right, the theme gem is meant to make installing and upgrading easier. But since you're customizing the source the copy/pasting is necessary.\nYou don't have to copy the entire MM source when using the gem. You only need to add those files you want to change, and they will override the ones in the theme.\nSince you just want to kill the animations of the theme I would just add a blank _animations.scss partial. That would be the easiest path the maintaining a custom version of the theme. Since that file is rarely touched you won't really have to worry about things breaking or missing updates. Anytime the theme has a new release you'd run bundle update minimal-mistakes-theme and you'll be all set.\n. Looks like a plugin issue to me. Are you using a Jekyll search plugin? I see some errors related to Lunr which I believe does search.\n. Also check your _config.yml. The error report you pasted above says there's a problem on line 46.\n. One other thing. You're using really old versions of Jekyll. Looks like version 2.4 to me and there theme required 3.0 or newer.\nTry running bundle update or bundle update jekyll to upgrade to the latest versions. That should help with the Liquid errors.\n. It's related to your Ruby environment. Google will probably turn up more help for you.\nYou can run Bundler with sudo and that will prompt you for your password which should let you update the gems as the error message above suggests.\nsudo bundle update\nThe error you pasted above also suggests running bundle install --path vendor/bundle if you don't want to go the sudo route. Just follow the error message suggestions, they're usually pretty good at pointing you in the right direction.\nAnd if that fails try a site like Stackoverflow or Jekyll Talk forums are another good place to turn if Googling the specific error msg doesn't turn up something.\n. Redcloth isnt a dependrncy currently used. Best I remember it was with Jekyll many versions ago. I'd ditch your Gemfile.lock and start fresh leaving just Gemfile and then run bundle install.\nOr use the new theme gem if you're not hosting with GitHub. \nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/\n. Thanks for this @aloisklink \n. Thanks for the fix @jpatters \n. Merged in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/0ff37a42a8b5590dd3652949fa73f50fc6e09d90\n. You're missing one small config line. Add words_per_minute: 200 to your _config.yml and it should work.\n. Going to make a fix to _includes/read-time.html that properly sets words_per_minute if it's omitted from the config file.\nThe new theme gem way of installing doesn't include it. So the fix for now is adding to your config. That and you'll probably want to add locale: en as well since I noticed that missing.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/f9e36767c2a5a3449b4c4e1c64e7fa8fd5040821\n. It's possible but would require you change up your workflow. What you'll want to do is install the theme as a gem. Check the docs for instructions on that.\nThe problem is GitHub Pages doesn't currently support 3rd party theme gems. Similar to how they don't allow Jekyll plugins (except for a few that have been whitelisted). So instead of pushing commits to GH and having it build your site, you need to build it locally and push the contents of your _site folder.\nIt's not as nice of a workflow but sadly that's the only way if you want to use a theme gem vs. forking a theme. If you Google around you can find some variations on this process. A lot of people use CI services like Travis to build their site and deploy to GH.\n- https://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-plugins-github/\n- http://distresssignal.org/jekyll-continuous-integration-travis-ci\n. @4brunu Your post/page are missing the layout in its YAML Front Matter. Either add layout: single to it or setup front matter defaults for all your posts in _config.yml.\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults. @4brunu Not sure. Something is overriding it then. If you look at the compiled HTML for the posts/pages they definitely don't have the full layout. Jekyll is just converting the .md files and has none of the layout applied.\nThat's why there is no CSS.\nFor example this post (https://4brunu.github.io/blog/2017/01/18/welcome-to-jekyll)\nJust has the actual content in the HTML... it's not wrapped with any of the layout. Maybe something is screwy with how you have Travis CI setup or Jekyll in general. Pretty sure it has nothing to do with the theme. Does it build locally?\n```html\nYou\u2019ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.\nTo add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.\nJekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:\ndef print_hi(name)\n  puts \"Hi, #{name}\"\nend\nprint_hi('Tom')\n#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.\nCheck out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll\u2019s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.\n``. @4brunu I just cloned your repo and tried to build it locally. It worked, so the issue isn't Jekyll or theme. As a comparison here is the HTML I'm getting for your [welcome-to-jekyll` post](https://gist.github.com/mmistakes/f51c3b29a05d9ffe2db4a90eb4dbee97).\nI don't know enough about the Rake task your using to deploy with Travis CI. Maybe that's the culprit. As bundle exec jekyll build works as expected.. @4brunu That's a path thing. If you look at the HTML source the CSS is being referenced here https://4brunu.github.io/assets/css/main.css which doesn't exist. It's in your gh-pages branch but as far as I can tell it's not pushed to 4bruno.github.io yet. I'm sure that has to do with your Rake task and Travis CI deployment script.\nLike I mentioned earlier I don't know Travis all that well. That and your deployment process is the issue. Don't have enough experience with either to offer any other suggestions.. What's your thought on the Jekyll SEO tag plugin? I'm mulling over pulling out all the schema stuff and using it instead. \n\nIt covers a lot of what I'm already doing with the theme\nOne less thing to worry about maintaining in the code\nRemoves complexity from theme's _includes and DRYs up the code.\nIs documented better than my theme with regards to SEO.\n\nThe plugin adds the same schema markup through JSON-LD which can be customized more than what I'm offering with the theme (eg. change type per page BlogPosting, NewsArticle, Person, Organization.)\nFor example instead of adding all the schema markup to the theme's includes as you've done with this PR, you can assign all the author social links like this with the plugin:\nyaml\nsocial:\n  name: Ben Balter\n  links:\n    - https://twitter.com/BenBalter\n    - https://www.facebook.com/ben.balter\n    - https://www.linkedin.com/in/BenBalter\n    - https://plus.google.com/+BenBalter\n    - https://github.com/benbalter\n    - https://keybase.io/benbalter\nIt's not automatic like with your PR, but offers the same without adding complexity to the theme's code.\nThe one thing that's been holding me back was how it handles OpenGraph/Twitter Card images. They're using image vs. header.image  to assign the path which means for those who use the existing theme they'd have to make some YAML changes to all of their posts. I don't think that's the end of the world (I've done it to my personal site with over 1,000 posts so it's possible).. Thanks for the feedback... pretty much echoes what I was thinking.. Will have to see if I can reproduce it. Sure looks like this issue from before related to the \"sticky\" sidebar.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/396. I think I know what the issue is. On screen sizes 1024 and up, position: sticky is being applied to the sidebar. I have the sidebar nav list showing up at 1023 so it's having the sticky position applied. Which is screwing up the layout.\nShouldn't take much CSS to fix it.. @carlesfernandez Just to be sure it's not due to a customization you did (I don't think it is :smile:) can you verify if this page looks messed up too in Chrome for Android?\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/. OK. Thanks for checking. It's definitely not the sticky class. Looks like only part of the sidebar overlaps. Think it might have something to do with how Chrome on Android handles viewport units.\nMight need to change 100vh to 100% in _navigation.scss\ndiff\n.nav__list input:checked ~ .nav__items {\n    -webkit-transition: 0.5s ease-in-out;\n    transition: 0.5s ease-in-out;\n-   max-height: 100vh;\n+   max-height: 100%;\n    overflow: visible;\n    opacity: 1;\n    margin-top: 1em;\n    -webkit-transform: translate(0, 0);\n    -ms-transform: translate(0, 0);\n    transform: translate(0, 0);\n}. Seeing it in Firefox's responsive web tester. Changing max-height: 100vh to max-height: 100% appears to fix it. Can you confirm if it fixes it for Chrome for Android since I have no way of testing that?\n\n. Fantastic. Thanks for identifying and testing the bug.. 1. I think with GitHub Pages hosted sites you also have to set the favicon path using <link>, dropping favicon.ico in the root isn't enough. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30551501/unable-to-set-favicon-using-jekyll-and-github-pages\n2. Something is wrong with your JavaScript which is causing the overlay script to not fire. When I open up the web inspector console I see the following errors.\njavascript\nUncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                     (index):811\nUncaught TypeError: $(...).fitVids is not a function(\u2026)                         main.min.js:5\nMy guess is you've added some and that's causing a conflict. Clear up the errors and the lightbox overlay should work.. Couple of issues you'll want to cleanup first that could be your problem:\n\nRemove /_pages/index.html. You already have an index page in the root of your site.\nRemove all the defaults YAML in _pages/inicio.md. Post defaults aren't assigned this way. You include them in your _config.yml, not in a post/page's YAML Front Matter.\nSomething is up with the jekyll-lunr-js-search plugin you're using. There's an error produced before anything else which could potentially be causing problems for you.  I've never used the plugin so I can't say. \n    [33m Error reading file /home/bretonio/Ao-Vivo/projetoengenhocas.github.io/index.html: (<unknown>): did not find expected key while parsing a block mapping at line 2 column 1  [0m].\nYou have gem \"wdm\", \"~> 0.1.0\" if Gem.win_platform? twice in your Gemfile, remove the duplicate.\n\nAlso I would try running bundle update to grab the latest versions of Jekyll and your plugins. Then fire up Jekyll again with bundle exec jekyll serve.\nDoes not appear to me that it's a theme issue. It's strictly content (structure, how you're assigning YAML, permalinks,etc.) or a plugin conflict.\n. Looks good to me. Thanks for the PR :+1: . From the looks of that link it's not a Minimal Mistakes theme site so I can't help you. Feel free to share a live example that's using MM so I can investigate.. It's not even a Jekyll site so I'm not sure how much help I'd be. A Wordpress support forum would be more helpful for you.. You're using very old versions of both Jekyll and the github-pages gem. This theme requires Jekyll 3+. Please update accordingly and report back if the error still exists.\nFor reference:\n| Gem | Your Version | Latest Version |\n| --- | -------------- | --------------- |\n| Jekyll | 2.4.0 | 3.3.1 |\n| Github Pages | 39 | 105 |. Provided you have gem 'github-pages' in your Gemfile then running bundle update should do the trick.\nThere's a bug with updating I've seen mention of so you might need to swap that line with this instead to force the update:\ngem 'github-pages', '104', group: :jekyll_plugins. word_per_minute is configurable. \nFeel free to change it to a different value in your _config.yml if the 200 default doesn't work for you.. Gotcha.. Unfortunately there is no way around this without introducing a scrollbar or something similar on the sidebar.\nYour only option is to disable the \"sticky\" sidebar and then it will scroll with the rest of the page content. If you want to go with that solution remove the sticky class from the sidebar.. Happy to look at a pull request if you want to submit a fix. . Added support for sidebar scrollbars when needed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/3e347970c7c632658976f1debcc622eb8ed88a90. @rashevskyv The theme purposely doesn't apply position: sticky to those elements on < 1024 pixel wide screens for this very reason. \nAre you using a modified version of the theme? You'll probably need some JavaScript to make it work.. Closing in favor of having users add extra social network links to _includes/author-profile-custom-links.html. They're easy enough to add that it's overkill to bake them all into the theme.\nRef: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/2215ee5c0624087a010229a35eae44b2d9b76598. Could be Ruby related. What's you environment like? Have you tried upgrading Ruby?\nRelated? https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon/issues/30. What's your Gemfile look like? Using latest Jekyll or Github Pages gem?\nWhat's the output look like if you add the --verbose and --trace flags? Might give some more clues as to what's going on.\nbundle exec jekyll serve --verbose --trace. Not entirely sure what to look for in the trace. Just thought it might give you a clearer picture as to what is going on.\nI can't reproduce the validity errors on either mac OS Sierra or Windows 7, which leads me to believe this is related to your environment.. Looks like it might be related to Nokogiri which is a dependency used by the GitHub Pages gem\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31841180/whats-causing-validity-error-id-some-id-already-defined\nIf the site is generating I wouldn't worry too much about those errors. @Kraymer also have you tried updating the GitHub Pages gem? Your version is 102 and I believe it's at 112 now. bundle update should do it. \nMight have to lock it at the higher version if it doesn't. I know there was a bug recently that you needed to force in the version in Gemfile to update. . Do either of you get the validity errors on a vanilla version of the theme with none of your content or configs added? Trying to isolate if it could be content related or not.\nFYI I've tested on macOS 10.12.2 and ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-darwin16] and can't seem to reproduce the errors.. Good detective work! That explains why I couldn't reproduce the error. Closing the issue since it doesn't appear to be theme related. \nI'd suggest filling an issue at https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-mentions or https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from. I don't think that's possible due to the order Jekyll processes Liquid. Pretty sure you'll need a plugin to use Liquid inside of YAML.\nSomething like this might do it for you. \nhttp://acegik.net/blog/ruby/jekyll/plugins/howto-nest-liquid-template-variables-inside-yaml-front-matter-block.html. If you add the entire URL to your YouTube channel (eg. youtube: https://youtube.com/c/customURL) in _config.yml you should be all set.\nAdding a username still works like it used. There's a check for :// now to determine which format to use.. Strange. It appears to be working correctly on the demo site.\nIf you check out this archive page\nand scroll down, the post titled \"Layout: Excerpt (Defined)\" has an excerpt that has been manually set.\n\nThe excerpt override was set just as you did with excerpt: in the post's YAML Front Matter.\n```\ntitle: \"Layout: Excerpt (Defined)\"\nexcerpt: \"This is a user-defined post excerpt. It should be displayed in place of the post content in archive-index pages.\"\ncategories:\n  - Layout\n  - Uncategorized\ntags:\n  - content\n  - excerpt\n  - layout\n\nThis is the post content. It should be displayed in place of the user-defined excerpt in archive-index pages.\nThis paragraph should be absent from an archive-index page where post.excerpt is shown.\n```\nDo you have a public repo somewhere and a link the source of the post that's not working? Not that it should matter but is it a post, a page, or a collection document?. Think you need to update the theme, this was fixed in #694.\n. Check Gemfile.lock. Whatever version is there is what will be used when running bundle exec jekyll. \nAll you should need to update is run bundle update. If that doesn't work bundle update minimal-mistakes-jekyll should. And if that still doesn't work then you can specify a version in your Gemfile like you mentioned above and then update. . If it says 4.1.0 there then it should be using that version if you're running bundle exec jekyll build or bundle exec jekyll serve\nOnly other thing I can think of is gem uninstall minimal-mistakes-jekyll and remove all the older versions. \nYou don't happen to have any files in _includes that might be older versions and overriding the ones bundled in the gem do you?. Smells like a Jekyll error to me. Bundled assets folder support is fairly new so it's possible there are bugs and the local versions are not overriding the bundled ones. \nIf I get time this week I'll test it and see if I notice the same issue you're having. \nIn the meantime can you verify its not a browser caching issue. Can you diff the updated files inassets/fonts against _site/assets/fonts after a build just to double check. If they're the same then that tells me your browser is caching the old assets. If the'yre different then it's likely a bug with Jekyll as the theme has nothing to do with processing files.. Ok. I'll take a look and see if I can reproduce. Will have to file an issue upstream since it seems to be Jekyll related. \nI don't think setting keep_files will make any difference. Pretty sure there is a bug in how the assets folder is handled with respect to theme gems. As I alluded to above the feature is relatively new and likely not widely used so I wouldn't be surprised that it has a few kinks left to iron out. . PS I opened an issue to update Font Awesome #723. Not sure when I'll get to it but if you'd like to submit a pull request it should be a relatively easy one to knock out.. Just got around to testing this and I was able to reproduce it. Looks like there might be a bug with Jekyll and how it handles files in /assets/ which is out of my hands to correct.\nBest I can tell files with YAML Front Matter override fine ie: assets/css/main.scss, but when I try to override any of the files in assets/fonts or assets/js they spit out the theme gem versions.\nWhen I get a chance I'll file an issue on jekyll/jekyll and see where that leads.. Bug filed https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5676. @BenjaminJurke \ud83d\ude03. additional reference issue: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5704. Closing as this is an upstream issue.. @BenjaminJurke FYI I found a workaround until this is fixed upstream. If I add YAML Front Matter to main.min.js it can be overridden. In the next release of MM I'll push it out. All you'll have to do is add:\n```\n\n```\nto the top of your modified /assets/js/main.min.js file and it should override the theme gem's version. . @BenjaminJurke That's another issue. Jekyll only reads _layouts, _includes, _sass and /assets that are included in a theme gem. _config.yml and _data files whether they're included in the gem or not don't get pulled in by Jekyll.\nThere's been talk about bringing them in (which I'm in favor of) since it reduces the friction of starting with a theme gem. Right now you have to physically copy over the files from the MM repo.\nRef: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5470. I believe it's an encoding issue not related to the theme. I'd Google around for some solutions as it has to do with your environment.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=invalid+leading+UTF-8+octet&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8. Closing this issue as it appears to be addressed. If not feel free to re-open with additional information to help debug the issue.. Building an option to use a CDN version of jQuery would introduce several complexities to the theme I'm not comfortable adding.\nAs far as using a CDN version of Font Awesome, that's fairly easy to do. You have two options depending on how you installed the theme:\nInstalled as a theme gem\n\nIn the root of your site folder add _sass/vendor/font-awesome/_variables.scss\nUncomment line 7 to replace the local font path with the CDN version. $fa-font-path:        \"//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.3/fonts\" !default;\nAdding the local _variables.scss FA partial and uncommenting the path will override the scss partial bundled in the theme and use the CDN version of FA instead.\n\nInstalled by forking the MM repo\n\nUncomment line 7 _sass/vendor/font-awesome/_variables.scss\n. I'll have to test and see if I can reproduce. \n\nThere's a related issue open for local files in assets not overriding the gem ones #722. If that's the case here then there might be a regression bug with Jekyll that will need to be filled upstream. . I got it to work by copying the entire _sass/vendor/font-awesome/ folder to my local repo, then commenting // $fa-font-path:        \"../fonts\" !default; and uncommenting $fa-font-path:        \"//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.3/fonts\" !default;\nSeems like the way Jekyll reads in local files to override the theme gem's versions gets confused when you start @importing levels deeper.. Agreed. Theme gems are still in their infancy so there are still some kinks to be worked out in Jekyll-land.. Can you verify that you set the following in _config.yml\nyaml\ncomments:\n  provider: \"custom\"\nand in each post or page's YAML Front Matter you want to embed the gitter chat you have comments: true\nDo you happen to have a public repo that I could look at to help troubleshoot?. Looking over your script above you're targeting the wrong element selector (class instead of id).\nInstead of targetElement: '.custom-comments' try targetElement: '#custom-comments'\n. As per Krandown's docs you need to add the MathJax JavaScript library for it work. https://www.mathjax.org/. You can add it to scripts.html or any of the two custom includes I've added to the theme for injecting scripts in the head or footer. \n/_includes/head/custom.html\n/_includes/footer/custom.html. I'd add it using a conditional like @justinrummel suggested to avoid embedding the script on pages that don't need MathJax.\n/_includes/scripts.html is probably the best place for it, but it can be added to one of the custom includes if you want to maintain to avoid messing with the main theme files.\nEither way something like this:\nhtml\n{% if page.mathjax %}\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" async\n  src=\"https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML\">\n</script>\n{% endif %}\nAnd then in your post/page's YAML Front Matter you'd add mathjax: true if you wanted the script embedded.. @yuzhangbit You have an example? My gut is telling me there's something with the MathJax script or possibly some sort of CSS interference. But without seeing the code it's hard to say.. @yuzhangbit Does that post have the equation added? I'm not seeing any sort of layout issues and the author sidebar is present.\n\n. I just tried it in Chrome on the desktop and the sidebar is there. \n\n\nYou sure you don't have any sort of adblocker extensions installed? They often kill social links and that would explain why the sidebar is gone. Other than that I really don't have any other suggestions as I can't seem to reproduce the issue.\n. So I rolled back to the non-beta version of Chrome and was able to reproduce it. The sidebar is there, but it disappears after the MathJax script loads and messes with the page's CSS.\nIt's doing a whole lot of stuff that hides the sidebar.\n\nYou can edit the CSS for the .sidebar to fix it. Though this smells like a browser bug to me so it should be fixed when Chrome rolls out 57, as it works fine there and other browsers like Safari.\nRemoving the following from _sass/_sidebar.scss worked for me:\ncss\n-webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\ntransform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);. @benslack19 Check your browser's console logs. I believe mathjax.org shut down their hosted copy of MathJax.js. You'll need to load the script from somewhere else.\n\nTry this instead:\nhtml\n{% if site.mathjax == true %}\n<!-- MathJax -->\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.2/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\"></script>\n{% endif %}. @benslack19 Other than the snippet I posted above that I have no other advice. I don't personally use LaTex so I'm not going to be much help.\nAs this isn't a theme issue I'd suggest asking for help on either the Jekyll Talk forums or search through Stackoverflow. This seems like a MathJax issue and you'll likely find help if you widen your search some.. Thanks for pointing this out. It's not technically broken link. My site mademistakes.com was having some issues, which is why the link breaks. It's back up and working now though.\n_includes/footer.html is purposely left sparse of social links. I added the basic, if I start adding more eventually it will turn into the author sidebar as requests to add x social network will likely come in. \nIt's small and simple enough file that you can customize it to fit your needs. Ideally you'd use the gemified version of the theme (if you're not on GH Pages) and override it as you see fit but there shouldn't be much harm directly modifying the include.. RE: the non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) between icon and text. That's in there to make sure the icon is always attached to the text. Without it the text could potentially break to the next line depending on the browser's screen size.\nSure it may be ugly, but it's completely valid and being used semantically, nothing hacky about it. One could argue all of that Liquid/HTML garbley gook above is ugly :wink:. You're pushing to the wrong remote repo \ud83d\ude09. Well you're in luck I'm 99.99999% sure the issue isn't Liquid or Ruby related.\nI see a couple of things you might need to clear up to get it working.\nIssue 1: The main content area is missing some divs used for presentation which is why the page looks managed. You're using layout: default when you probably want layout: single instead.\nIssue 2: Kramdown does appear to be ripping out some markup from the iframe embed you pasted above. It used to do this with YouTube embeds back in the day and you had to do a dance with removing allowFullScreen and adding a space before the closing </iframe> tag.\nI don't think this will help in this case. Kramdown does have a way of instructing it not to process a block of content as Markdown and leave the HTML alone. Take a look at the documentation for more on that.\nEssentially what you do is add an attribute (markdown=\"0\") to your tag (sometimes you need to wrap in a div and apply it there) to get the HTML to output untouched.\nhtml\n<iframe markdown=\"0\" src=\"https://www.livecoding.tv/twhite96/embed\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"display:block; margin: 0 auto;\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>\nor possibly this:\nhtml\n<div markdown=\"0\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.livecoding.tv/twhite96/embed\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"display:block; margin: 0 auto;\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>\n</div>\nIssue 3: After that depending on how the video iframe renders inside of the main content container you may need to play with some JavaScript. The theme ships with FitVids.js that adds a wrapper element around video players (YouTube, Vimeo, Blip.tv, Viddler, Kickstarter) and then with the help of some CSS responsively sizes it to fill the width.\nLivecoding.tv isn't natively supported with FitVids.js but they do offer a way to add custom selectors for any video vendor you want. To do that you'd need to edit a single line of JavaScript in assets/js/_main.js to something like:\njs\n$(\"#main\").fitVids({ customSelector: \"iframe[src^='https://www.livecoding.tv']\"});\nThen rebuild the script following the instructions here.\nIf you don't want bother with editing the JS you could possibly wrap the iframe like so, which is what FitVids is doing automatically... giving it the CSS class it needs to resize responsively.\nhtml\n<div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.livecoding.tv/twhite96/embed\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"display:block; margin: 0 auto;\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>\n</div>\nHope this helps point you in the right direction.. Thanks for this @vejuhust . @lgyjg Doesn't look like you're running Jekyll the prescribed way of using Bundler.\n\nRun bundle update to verify all gems in your Gemfile are current\nRun Jekyll with bundle exec jekyll serve if you don't it likely won't use the current gems. Always prepend any Jekyll command with bundle exec, ie: bundle exec jekyll build, bundle exec jekyll serve, bundle exec jekyll serve -w --host=0.0.0.0, etc.. Does the overlap happen on all pages that have the author sidebar? or just that one?\n\nI'm on Chrome 55 on Windows and not able to reproduce it. Are there any sort of JavaScript errors in the console or is it disabled for any reason? There is a JS polyfill for position: sticky used on the sidebar that could be potentially running amok.\nOther than that I'm at a loss as to what's going on.. OK, looks like it's related to position: sticky since it was added to the beta version last month. Will have to test it out and hopefully get a fix out before position: sticky support hits the stable release of Chrome... whenever that is.. Tested on beta Chrome 56 on Windows and all works as it should.\n\n\nWith position: sticky landing in Chrome stable soon seems like a good time to drop the polyfill. Wasn't adding much anyways and likely won't be missed in older browsers or IE that don't currently support it.\nStill not sure why it's broken for that redditor, could be something JS related. I know there's stuff in the theme that was added awhile back that tests the width of things to trigger the sticky polyfill, and that could be borked for whatever reason.. I do what I can :wink:\nIn the end I took out the polyfill. In Firefox, Safari, and Chrome 56 the sidebar will \"stick\" as it should. On older browsers it scrolls with the rest of the page, which isn't so bad either.\nIf you're interested in making the changing it's pretty small and in this commit. I'll roll it out officially in the next release.. > You need to test on bigger screen sizes. The bug only appears when the browser is over 1150px wide and then it jumps back to working again for a little bit until the browser gets to be over 1400px wide. It appears from the GIF you posted that you didn't test on anything wider than maybe 1000px.\n@NathanHeffley Definitely not the case. It may be hard to tell from the GIF but the screen was much wider than 100px.\nTested on both Windows and Mac Chrome 56 (beta) and couldn't reproduce the overlap.\n\nScreen width 1875px:\n\nCurious to know if you have any plugins installed that might mess with JS or noticed any script errors in the console.. Fixed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/4.2.0. @kvz Stange. It should be there, along with 4.2.1. Unless it hasn't fully propagated... https://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll/versions/4.2.1. In my opinion setting target=\"_blank\" is a web anti-pattern and is mostly abused as a matter of preference. Some context here. https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/\nIt also has security implications if you don't add rel=\"noopener\" to links that target a _blank window.\nI don't think it's the theme's place to dictate the usage of target=\"_blank\" and would rather leave it out and up to the user to decide if they want to add it or not.\nThat's for opening the issue and the PR.. @ohadschn I think overriding is your only course of action. Anytime you deviate and customize you'll have to be weary of changes in the core and keep on top of them.. No not at this time... for all of the reasons I cited above about it being a perceived anti-pattern.. Nothing stopping you from dropping in the script from https://github.com/gernotstarke/minimal-mistakes/commit/9ba387bbe3160e83f54c7f63f303254155f9fab5 into _includes/footer/custom.html. That's the whole point of that file.. This has more to do with Jekyll than the theme per say.\nRelated: https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/376. It doesn't, I just included the link because the issue is related. The theme gem doesn't have json as a dependency directly. \nI'm pretty sure it's one of the official Jekyll plugins included as dependencies, which is why I included the GH Pages gem link since that too has similar plugin dependencies.\nI've seen this json gem problem with core Jekyll too. Just because gem install jekyll appears to install with Ruby 2.4  I wouldn't completely rule it out as a culprit. The issue I've seen usually creeps up when used with Bundler as this theme does.\nNot sure what the fix would be on my end as this appears to be an issue with a dependency I don't control.. Thanks for this. \nIf you can make the one small change to fix the \"Next\" link with sites that use baseurl and then submit this against the develop branch it should be good to merge.. Thanks @maik. I'll close this and take a look at the new PR.. Do you have this page live somewhere? I can't seem to test it locally since it relies on Google indexing the site for it to produce search results.\nAll I get is the search box, which doesn't return anything for me to troubleshoot what CSS is adding the borders.\n\nYour best bet would be to use your browser's web developer tools to inspect the elements with borders and see what CSS is being declared. \nOnly thing I can think of off-hand might be if those elements are constructed with table. There are some border styles in the theme for that, so they might need to be adjusted based on how things are cascading.\nBut hard for me to say since I can't see the actual HTML and CSS class names Google uses for the search widget.. Sure no problem!\nAs I suspected it's the borders being applied to table, tr, and td. I'll eventually add some small CSS to the theme to zero them out but if you want a quick fix add these CSS styles after the _table.scss ones.\ncss\n.gsc-control-cse table, \n.gsc-control-cse tr, \n.gsc-control-cse td {\n    border: 0;\n}. I haven't tested this yet, but this could be related to YAML. I know you can use | to have it preserve newlines if you do something like:\nyaml\nstats: |\n  65 Home Runs\n  0.278 Batting Average\nPerhaps it's ignoring | when parsing the YAML, which could explain why it's blank. If thats's the case maybe there is a way to escape that character so it shows up. I'd suggest digging into the YAML spec as this appears to be an issue there and not with the theme.. Did some testing and it does seem like YAML or Liquid or Jekyll is removing the vertical pipe |. What you can do instead is declare it as a HTML entity and then it'll work.\nyaml\ntitle_separator: \"&#124;\"\nWill give you something like:\nhtml\n<title>Welcome to Jekyll | Minimal Mistakes</title>. Only issue I have is there are users that wish to override the Sass partials (in the gem version and as a fork). It's come up a few times already and I'd hate to lose that ability just to shave off a few seconds of build time. \nTo be honest the various for loops in the theme eat up way more of the build time than preprocessing SCSS assets.. I get that, but still doesn't help the users who want to override SCSS files when using the theme as a gem. It's come up twice in the last couple of weeks so it's definitely a way people expect to use the theme.\nJavaScript I'm less worried about and feel fine bundling in a compiled version as most almost never touch the scripts.. Thanks for the PR and discussion though \ud83d\ude00. Looks like it's mixing in non-related commits. Can you create a PR with just your commits. I'm seeing a bunch of old stuff from Staticman and previous merges that could make the merge messy.\nYour previous PR had just the one commit against _includes/paginator.html which is why I'm bringing it up. This new one shows 13 commits touching 7 files.. Sorry it took me awhile to review this. Everything looks good. Thanks for taking the time to get this working and submitting a PR.. @Sarafian Pretty sure the default Jekyll pagination only works with .html files. Rename to recent-archive.html and see if that fixes it. \nSounds like you have everything else configured correctly since you're getting /recent/page/x/index.html files generated. . @Sarafian Scratch that. Forgot about about some other Jekyll pagination limitations.\n\nFilename has to be index.html or else it will be skipped.\n\nSo to do what you want rename _pages/recent-archive.md to /recent/index.html and then rebuild. For whatever reason you can't place pagination indexes inside of a folder like _pages.\nYou'll also want to remove permalink: /recent/ from that file's YAML Front Matter. Just need the following and everything should work:\n```\nlayout: home\nauthor_profile: true\ntitle: Recent Posts\n\n```. @Sarafian Strange. Just looked at your site and seems fine to me. Paginated /recent/ pages are there and populated with posts.. That can be tricky. You'll need to customize the masthead include to accommodate a sub-title or tagline. And will likely need to make some CSS changes to get things looking good.\nThe theme was designed for a title without a tagline. There was a previous issue filed by someone who had a really long site title and I gave suggestions on how to break it into multiple lines, but I can't seem to find it. It was probably buried in unrelated issue making it hard to find.\nBut maybe peruse the closed issues to see if you can dig it up.. Defining links in _data/navigation.yml doesn't actually build the pages. You need to physically build the /posts/index.html page.\nDepending on how you want to set that up you could grab this sample HTML file from the demo site.\n\nRename it to posts.html and place it in the root of your project.\nChange the permalink to permalink: /posts/ in its YAML Front Matter.\nRebuild your site and https://pjpaulpj.github.io/posts/ should work.. http://jekyll.tips/. It's purely an organizational thing. You can consult the Jekyll docs for more, but what is going on is instead of putting about.md in the root, I prefer to keep all my pages in _pages folder.... similar to _posts.\n\nIf you do that you need the permalink override so Jekyll places the rendered index.html in the right location. You also need to tell Jekyll to look at _pages since underscore files and folders are ignored by default. \nTo do that _pages is added to the include array in _config.yml.. That's because you need to add the MathJax library to render them. If you dig into Kramdown's documentation it notes this. See #735 for more assistance.. This is a Jekyll related error and not theme related. That said I believe what is going on here is you're using post_url incorrect. If you have a link to a public repo I can confirm that...\nInstead of {{ post_url }} you want {% post_url %} with percent signs.\nTo link to <site root>/_posts/2012-03-15-layout-header-image-text-readability.md you'd use:\n{% post_url 2012-03-15-layout-header-image-text-readability %}\nTo read up more on how to use the post_url tag or new link tag check the official Jekyll docs. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#post-url. Can you submit this PR against the develop branch? Thanks.. Was this a PR to the wrong repo? Not sure I follow what this pull request is for if not. The theme already offers the UI translated into Spanish. \nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/ui-text.yml#L52-L95. You'll need to write some custom CSS or edit what is currently in the theme to center and change colors.. I don't have one. You'll need to use CSS to write the styling to center text and all that. Try a CSS tutorial or reference site to learn more about it.. Not sure. I don't think there is a simple \"plug and play\" solution here. CSS by design can cascade and depending on what styles you're dropping in could override something else.\nYou really just need to get in there and start writing style declarations and see what happens. Even better you use the web developer tools of any modern browser to inspect elements and see if modifying existing styles is possible or if you need to rewrite some of the HTML too.. If you're comfortable with Git please edit _data/ui-text.yml to include a new locale and translated strings and submit a pull request against the develop branch. \nIf not feel free to add the translations below for each of the following and I can take care of the rest.\n```yaml\nNepali (Nepal)\n-----------------\nne: &DEFAULT_NE\n  page                       : \"Page\"\n  pagination_previous        : \"Previous\"\n  pagination_next            : \"Next\"\n  breadcrumb_home_label      : \"Home\"\n  breadcrumb_separator       : \"/\"\n  menu_label                 : \"Toggle Menu\"\n  toc_label                  : \"On This Page\"\n  ext_link_label             : \"Direct Link\"\n  less_than                  : \"less than\"\n  minute_read                : \"minute read\"\n  share_on_label             : \"Share on\"\n  meta_label                 :\n  tags_label                 : \"Tags:\"\n  categories_label           : \"Categories:\"\n  date_label                 : \"Updated:\"\n  comments_label             : \"Leave a Comment\"\n  comments_title             : \"Comments\"\n  more_label                 : \"Learn More\"\n  related_label              : \"You May Also Enjoy\"\n  follow_label               : \"Follow:\"\n  feed_label                 : \"Feed\"\n  powered_by                 : \"Powered by\"\n  website_label              : \"Website\"\n  email_label                : \"Email\"\n  recent_posts               : \"Recent Posts\"\n  undefined_wpm              : \"Undefined parameter words_per_minute at _config.yml\"\n  comment_form_info          : \"Your email address will not be published.

I'm not seeing it here.. Looks good @ritayadav, thanks for submitting the pull request. Merged.. Wrong repo.. Not entirely sure what the question is, but going to assume you want to paginate multiple pages.\nWith the official Jekyll pagination plugin it only allows you to paginate a single page (usually the home page). If you want to do more you need to use another plugin. I suggest jekyll-paginate-v2.. Thanks for the PR @scienceopen, but as @sfarzy mentioned, I'm trying to avoid these sorts of adds to keep the author sidebar in check. They're easy enough to add/remove which is why I don't feel too bad not merging them all in.. Not a bug. It's linked to the \"Terms\" page which isn't part of that collection... it's just a single page.. Thanks @vazrupe . Quick look and this looks great. I'll have a closer look and let you know. Appreciate you documenting and adding examples too \ud83d\ude04. You could try adding background-attachment: fixed but it will likely have unintended side-effects. That's how I did it with Skinny Bones.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll/blob/master/_sass/_layout.scss#L233. I think it depends on the complexity of the parallax effect you want to achieve. There are some that react to mouse position which wouldn't be possible without JavaScript.\nPersonally I prefer CSS-only solutions for everything just for simplicity's sake. For more feedback on the matter I'd seek out blogs/forums/sites dedicated to web development. You'll find more valuable information there.. Closing this issue as it appears to be addressed. If not feel free to re-open.. There is not.. No slider images either. The theme supports:\n\nlarge hero images at the top of any page\npost images with caption (see figure helper)\nmultiple post images grouped together as a \"gallery\" ( see gallery helper). Closing this issue as it appears to be addressed. If not feel free to re-open.. By size what do you mean exactly? Page width? File size of outputted HTML? etc.?. If it's page width related check this old issue where I explain where to look and what you'll need to modify in the CSS.\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/384. Closing this issue as it appears to be duplicate of #384. If you have more details to share feel free to re-open.. My guess is you're calling a jQuery function before main.min.js is pulled in. It's in the footer so any scripts you add that rely on jQuery need to occur after it or else you'll get that Can't find variable: $.. You'll have to make some modifications to the theme to do that.\nSince main.min.js is in the footer it will always load after anything you put into a post or page's content. If it's only a small bit of jQuery you could add it after that line I referenced above.\nYou could probably rig it so you put the unique scripts in the page's Front Matter YAML:\n```yaml\nscripts: |\n  \n    // your script\n  \n\n```\nand then reference that in some sort of {{ page.script }} variable in the footer.\nOr maybe even easier just move main.min.js from the footer to the <head>. Downside to that is you might get a performance hit since loading scripts in the head typically block rendering of a page.. You're pushing to the wrong origin repo :wink:. I'm not familiar with Academicons but from their site they were designed to work with Font Awesome (which is what the theme uses for icons).\nPerhaps that isn't the case. Do you have an example of what it looks like when it breaks the layout?\nI would suggest putting the CSS and fonts inside of the assets folder so they're in the same place as the rest of the theme assets. You can then link to them the same way as main.css in _includes/head.html.\nhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ '/assets/css/main.css' | absolute_url }}\">. How are you adding it to the sidebar? Looks to me like you either have some bad HTML or Liquid in there (possibly a missed closing tag that's breaking the rest of the page). Can you share the exact code you're using?\nOnly other thing I can think of is there's some CSS in that new file that conflicts with the theme. Can't really offer much help there if that's the case, since I didn't author it.\nGood practice is to use your browsers web developer tools to inspect the problematic elements and it will show you the CSS being applied. You can track down what file is doing what and toggle things on/off to see if that fixes it.. You're missing a closing quote in the class attribute on i.\nhtml\n <li>\n    <a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0490-1175\" itemprop=\"sameAs\">\n      <i class=\"ai ai-orcid-square ai-3x></i> ORCID\n    </a>\n  </li>\nShould be this:\nhtml\n <li>\n    <a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0490-1175\" itemprop=\"sameAs\">\n      <i class=\"ai ai-orcid-square ai-3x\"></i> ORCID\n    </a>\n  </li>. Could be. Can't really say. My guess is it has more to do with the actual font/icon and how it was designed. Their site says it was built to work with Font Awesome but the metrics could be off.\nMore of a question for the maintainer of those icons since I don't really know the specifics on them.. Do you have it hosted somewhere so I can inspect the elements? Hard to tell from this.\nAs this is HTML/CSS related and not really anything to do with the theme you might have better luck asking on a dedicated web dev forum like Stackoverflow.. You'll need to add the widths for various screen width breakpoints. Basically the way I've done it is using a \"mobile-first\" philosophy.\nStart with how you want things to look for small screens, then add a breakpoint when you want it to change. Repeat.\nSince you want them to stack you'll want to start with them spanning then entire set of columns 12 of 12. Then when you hit tablet or desktop screen sizes you can have them shrink down to 4 of 12 so you can do 3 in a row.\nTo do that you can use the breakpoint mixins.\nSomething like this.\n```scss\n.your-class {\n  // mobile first styles here\n@include breakpoint($medium) { // will convert to a max-width:768px media query\n    // 600px wide and up styles here\n    // column width 100%\n  }\n@include breakpoint($large) { // will convert to a max-width:1024px media query\n    // 1024px wide and up styles here\n    // column width 33.3333%\n  }\n}\n```\nThe $medium and $large variables are just widths for common screen sizes. You can use them or be more specific if you have a need for that.. Great to hear that :smile:.\nAdding support for comment reply notifications along with nested replies is on my radar, but I haven't figured out how I want to handle it yet. To use both of those there are some changes I'd need to manage as to not break support for those who don't upgrade to Staticman v2.\nEssentially it comes down to moving all the Staticman configs out of _config.yml and into a staticman.yml file and changing the POST url in the comment form.\nI've done both of these on my personal site and even wrote about all the changes. If you're interested that might be a good reference to start with until I can bake it into the theme officially.\nYou might want to take a look at @justinrummel's repo for inspiration since he's currently trying to use Staticman v2 features with Minimal Mistakes.. @justinrummel RE: working on pull request to add support for Staticman v2. Off the top of my head here's some thoughts/suggestions:\n\n[ ] Remain backwards compatible with v1 Staticman implementation\n[ ] Add a new comment provider to _config.yml, perhaps named staticman-v2\n[ ] Possible to DRY up comment.html and comments.html includes to reuse between v1 and v2... might be too much of a hassle since the way their for loops are constructed is widely different.\n[ ] Move \"reply\" JavaScript into _includes/comment-providers/staticman.html with current form handling scripts or breakoff into main.min.js?\n\nIf you do come up something or have a work in progress you want me to look at that's cool. Work off the develop branch as I checkout all new feature branches from there and it may have something not in master yet.. @justinrummel Sounds good. It might be possible with some clever {% if %} or {% unless %} conditionals in there to combine v1 and v2 support... but it might also turn into Liquid spaghetti.\nSee what you come up with. I'm cool with a comment-provider/staticman-v2.html if it makes things cleaner.. I use the public instance of Staticman. Never bothered setting up my own.. @dev4223 For the reply stuff did you pull from my latest on the Made Mistakes repo? I haven't come across any order issues with replies, so just curious.. @dev4223 Let me know what you find. It should be fairly easy to spot if something is off by looking at the comment files produced in _data. If replying_to has the correct parent number then there shouldn't be a problem.\nAnd since that field is only populated on a reply the order shouldn't matter since you can't really reply to a parent comment that hasn't been merged yet. Unless you're fudging the form data before submitting.. @willymcallister That it works correctly building locally might be a sign that the gems are different. Perhaps a different version of Liquid than what GitHub is using with its pages gem is causing the difference?\nThe only site I have replies setup with is my personal which isn't built by GitHub Pages. Other than that looks like your comment code is slightly different from mine so that could be the issue too. Sorting out the loops and all the nuances of sort aren't all that straightforward. The YAML Front Matter inside o your comment files matters too (but at quick glance yours looks similar to mine).. There is a known bug where strange fields show up in data files and other times some go missing.\n It's a tough one to isolate which is why I don't think it's been fixed yet. \nHere's the issue if you want to track it. https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/176. @ashmaroli Does v1.0 get around the need for a user to have to add jekyll-data to gems in their _config.yml file? While it's not as bad as asking them to copy over any required _data files, it is an extra step I have to document.\nI was hoping I could just add it as a dependency in the theme's gemspec and it would come along for the ride without any intervention by the user of the theme. If they're going to need to install the plugin anyways it's not that big of a stretch to ask them to just copy the language data file the theme ships with. It's one less dependency too.. That's a bummer but since I'm already pushing using a Gemfile with the theme it's probably not the end of the world if they just need to add it under :jekyll_plugins. Seems like you documented that well in the PR so I'm cool with that.\nI just deleted the existing feature/jekyll-data branch and created a new one off of the last master. develop tends to be more current if you'd rather submit the PR against that, but right now I believe they're the same.. Nice. I'll give it a spin when I get some free time.. Don't think it's MM that's the issue here, but the various Jekyll gems it depends on. The theme could care less what version of Ruby you have installed.. Not really. The old v2 version should work, but it is missing a lot of the new stuff I've added since.\nIf you want the fonts back from v2 it's easy enough to add. I provide instructions in the theme docs.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/#typography-from-older-versions. You're pushing to the wrong repo :wink:\nYou need to update your remote origin to point to your repo instead of this one.. Almost all of your issues are content related (bad YAML, wrong layouts, etc). The theme side of things appears to be fine.\n\nYou are using the wrong layout on your homepage. Change layout: default to layout: home.\nYou have a ton of YAML errors in your posts. I would suggest building locally so you can see all of the errors and correct them as pushing to GitHub won't give you as much detail as to what is wrong.\n\n```\nGenerating...\n  Error: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2013-12-10-writing-for-scientific-publication-3-common-mistakes.\nmd: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3 column\n 42\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2014-08-23-fix-arff-file-not-recognised-or-unable-to-load-data-i\nn-weka.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3\n column 11\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2014-10-02-error-python-version-2-7-required-which-was-not-found\n-in-the-registry-solved.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this\ncontext at line 3 column 13\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2014-11-17-conquering-errors-in-t-sql-and-ssis-act-1-scene-1.md:\n (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3 column 43\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2014-11-24-working-with-weka-data-preprocessing-error-array-inde\nx-out-of-bounds-exception.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in thi\ns context at line 3 column 52\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2015-05-05-hierarchical-clustering-methods-implementation-in-r-a\n-case-study.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at l\nine 3 column 59\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-01-09-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-exploratory-data-anal\nysis.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3 c\nolumn 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-01-15-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-making-data-managemen\nt-decisions.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at l\nine 3 column 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-01-23-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-visualizing-data.md:\n(): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3 column 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-02-10-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-anova-tukeys-hsd-post\n-hoc-comparison-test.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this con\ntext at line 3 column 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-02-21-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-chisquare-test-of-ind\nependence.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at lin\ne 3 column 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-02-21-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-pearsons-correlation-\ncoeffecient.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at l\nine 3 column 20\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-02-24-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-exploring-statistical\n-interactions.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at\n line 3 column 20\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-03-15-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-how-the-data-was-coll\nected.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3\ncolumn 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-03-25-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-uncovering-the-factor\ns-responsible-multiple-regression-analysis-2.md: (): mapping values are\n not allowed in this context at line 3 column 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-03-29-big-or-small-lets-save-them-all-logistic-regression-a\nnalysis.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line\n3 column 40\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-04-20-to-penalise-or-not-to-penalise-the-curious-case-of-au\ntomatic-feature-selection.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in thi\ns context at line 3 column 38\nError: could not read file /duttashi.g\nithub.io/_posts/2016-04-26-give-me-data-and-i-shall-give-you-clusters-the-case-o\nf-k-means-algorithm.md: (): mapping values are not allowed in this cont\next at line 3 column 50\nBuild Warning: Layout 'page' requested in _posts/2013-07-28-about.md does n\not exist.\nLiquid Exception: undefined method gsub' for nil:NilClass in _includes/archiv\ne-single.html, included in _layouts/single.html\njekyll 3.1.6 | Error:  undefined methodgsub' for nil:NilClass\n```\nFor example in _posts/2016-04-26-give-me-data-and-i-shall-give-you-clusters-the-case-of-k-means-algorithm on line 2 in the title you have a colon that isn't inside of the quotes. This is throwing a YAML error. You have to be really careful with single quotes, double quotes, and : colons.\nIt also appears Jekyll is having problems with some of your dates that you've set in the post's YAML. Probably the format is off. Instead of something like 2013-12-10 17:50 it needs to be in ISO format 2013-12-10T17:50.\nAnd finally you're using the wrong layout in _posts/2013-07-28-about.md. Should be layout: post not layout: page.\nFix these things and your home page will build properly.. FYI you're pushing to the wrong repo \ud83d\ude09. Update the remote origin to point to your repo and that should fix it.. The theme docs mention you need the Jekyll Archives plugin, which has a link to their instructions on how to install it. I just assumed anyone who wanted to go that route would read-up on the plugin and how to install/setup.\nIt's not installed by default because it doesn't work with GitHub Pages. To install gem install jekyll-archives or add it under the plugins group in your Gemfile\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem \"jekyll-archives\"\nend\nThen run bundle install.\nHappy to accept pull requests to make the theme docs more clear.. You can certainly do it that way. For the theme I approached it with a slightly DRYer approach (Don't Repeat Yourself). Instead of creating layouts for the category page and another one for tags they both use the same _layouts/archive.html. Less files to maintain that way.\nThen each page (categories/tags) use the group-by-array helper to construct the appropriate for loops. Both of these pages are provided as samples to get you started and are mentioned in the documentation. I could probably call them out more since they're often missed.\n\nCategory archive (eg. /categories/#category)\n\nTag archive (eg. /tags/#tag). Updated in latest release https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/4.2.2. @ohadschn Yeah you can. You have to manually add a \"posts by category\" page. Same for tags. The source for both are in the /docs/_pages folder (as mentioned a few comments above).\n\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/category-archive.html\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/tag-archive.html\n. You don't. jekyll-archives only generates archives for specific taxonomies (or dates if configured). It doesn't create an index page that lists all posts grouped by category or tag, which is what those links above do.\n\nFor example if you have a post with categories: foo, bar. Depending on your permalink structure you'll get something like /categories/foo/index.html and /categories/bar/index.html. What you won't get is /categories/index.html... \nMake sense?. That's a question for the maintainers of the jekyll-archives plugin. I've never tried to set front matter defaults on them, so not sure if it's even possible.\nI've only ever set defaults on posts, pages, and collections.. @kblife Jekyll Archives does not support topics\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#enabled-archives\nYou can change the permalink structure to what you have, but your post front matter needs to use categories, not topics like you have.\nYou will also need to change these lines in your _config.yml so the category links in your posts resolve to the correct paths.\nyaml\ncategory_archive:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /answers/topics/. @kblife Your jekyll-archives config is way off that's why it's not working. Topics isn't an array it knows anything about, nor Jekyll for that matter. It only works for tags and categories.\nYour best bet is to use categories as topics (which I think you're trying to do), but to do that you need to configure it that way properly. Then use the permalink paths as you have so instead of \"category\" in the URL it'll have \"answers/topics\"\nYou're are setting a Jekyll Archives layout that the theme doesn't have, unless you've built that yourself. You'll want to repurpose the archive-taxonomy like so.\nyaml\njekyll-archives:\n  enabled:\n    - categories\n  layouts:\n    category: archive-taxonomy\n  permalinks:\n    category: /answers/topics/:name/\nIf this doesn't work I'd suggest reading up on how the Jekyll Archives plugin works and reaching out for help with them. It appears to me you're having issues with that more than the theme. Which I don't support.. FYI you're pushing to the wrong remoteorigin. Thanks for the translations. I'll definitely add them to the next release. \nAs far as localizing the date. Ideally Jekyll core would support it instead of having to resort to a bunch of Liquid code. Something like this was proposed but appears to have gone stale https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5478. Not without some work on your part. You'll need to use a plugin or do something like the following.\n\nhttps://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/. I believe you need to update Chrome. Recently they added support for position: sticky. You likely have an older version which doesn't have this feature and the sidebar won't \"stick\" on scroll. \n\nAlso do you have any adblockers installed? They're known to be aggressive and remove content they think are \"social\" related. The sidebar and footer look fine for me in Chrome with no extensions enabled on macOS and Windows which is why I ask.. If you want position: sticky to work with older browsers you can add back a polyfill I was previously using. As it's purely presentational and most modern browsers support it now I removed it to lighten the JavaScript included with the theme.\nHere's the commit you can revert if you want it back https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/55843c5dca8fcf5ff83e48ace202fc529d58ae14. Thanks for the PR. \nI'm currently not accepting commits of this sort for the author sidebar as it's easy enough to customize and add/remove to meet the users needs. I'm trying to keep this in check to avoid having every imaginable social network option in there.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#author-profile. @ghutchis Care to submit a pull request to the develop branch with the fix?. Thanks @pierryangelo. Care to add pt-BR translations to these strings (lines 256-266) as well? They've been missing for a while and since you clearly know the language it would be of help.\nHere's the English versions below for reference:\nyaml\ncomments_title             : \"Comments\"\ncomment_form_info          : \"Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked\"\ncomment_form_comment_label : \"Comment\"\ncomment_form_md_info       : \"Markdown is supported.\"\ncomment_form_name_label    : \"Name\"\ncomment_form_email_label   : \"Email address\"\ncomment_form_website_label : \"Website (optional)\"\ncomment_btn_submit         : \"Submit Comment\"\ncomment_btn_submitted      : \"Submitted\"\ncomment_success_msg        : \"Thanks for your comment! It will show on the site once it has been approved.\"\ncomment_error_msg          : \"Sorry, there was an error with your submission. Please make sure all required fields have been completed and try again.\"\nloading_label              : \"Loading...\". Thanks @ghutchis for logging the bug and fixing it! :+1: . Thanks @Sarafian . That layout doesn't have the Liquid code for headers. Take a look at the standard archive.html to see what code you'd need to add to the taxonomy one for them to work. \nThe YAML you're using is fine it just needs the layout code to make it show up.. Think that's a causality of using Jekyll Archives. It has access to certain objects, page likely isn't one of them, at least not in the way you're trying to access it. I'm sure there's a way to do it but you might need to get creative.\nI'd inquire with that plugin as I don't really know much more about it other than what they've documented here.. There's probably some Liquid voodoo that might be possible to determine what layout is in use and then apply page. or layout. accordingly. Versus duplicating all of the includes into the Jekyll Archives just to make that minor change.\nWould DRY things up some too. All hypothetical though as I haven't tested it :wink:. @ohadschn Your best bet is opening a feature request on jekyll-archives to allow for it. There's really only a few variables exposed at the archive page level through the plugin... all of which are related to getting the title.\nAs I mentioned above, if you're properly motivated you can come up with some custom Liquid to do it. I did just this on one project.\nFor example say you're creating a set of tag archives and what a header image on them that corresponds with the current tag... let's call that foo.\nWhat you can do is in your tag archive layout add something like:\n{% assign taxonomy = page.title | downcase | slugify %}\n{% assign tag = site.data.taxonomy[taxonomy] %}\nWhat this does is take the page.title, which in this case will be Foo and does some normalizing (lowercase, replace spaces with -, etc.). If the title was \"Foo Bar\" you'd get foo-bar. This gives you a predictable value you can use as a \"key\" in a data file. In this case _data/taxonomy.yml.\nWhich looks something like:\n```\nfoo:\n  description: \"Foo is an example of foo.\"\n  image: /path-to-image-foo.jpg\nfoo-bar:\n  description: \"Foo Bar is an example of foo + bar.\"\n  image: /path-to-image-foo-bar.jpg\n```\nThrough the assigns above you can easily pull in this data into the tag archive layout now:\n{% if tag.image %}\n  <img src=\"{{ tag.image }}\" alt=\"\">\n{% endif %}\nI used this method to add detailed descriptions for each tag archive page. But you can use it to assign images and any other data you can dream up. You can see examples of my old tag archive layout and taxonomy.yml files here.. You could always just create your own jekyll-archives layout that has the page header image hard coded in it.. Depends on what you want to do.\nIf you want all of the archive pages to have the same image you can just dump that into a new layout. If you want something more dynamic and unique for each page then my solution above will work. You'll add around 4 lines of Liquid to it, or you can wait for a feature add to jekyll-archives.. Also, even if that layout had the header logic, it would just comes across as null because Jekyll-archives has no concept of the page object to pass data.\nYou need to use my method above to assign data from a data file so it has something to populate the header with. Since that is highly custom it won't ever be included in the theme. That layout is fairly barebones so you'll be safe overriding it with your own custom logic.. Correct.. {{url}} won't do anything, you'll probably want to switch that to {{ site.url }} or better yet leverage Jekyll's absolute or relative filters.\nhtml\n<img src=\"{{ '/images/my-shared-header-image.jpg' | absolute_url }}\" class=\"page__hero-image\">. Thanks for the PR @varian-lee!. Thanks for the PR @oopsmonk . The other option is to use the Jekyll gem in your Gemfile instead of github-pages. Minimal Mistakes doesn't work on GitHub Pages as a theme gem anyways since there are only a few themes whitelisted currently (all GH owned owns).. As you noted it's fairly trivial to change to something more specific to appease the OpenGraph debugger.\nI'd rather keep it generic at en and not force a United States locale on everyone.\nAnyone who cares about this sort of thing would likely consult the docs when setting this up where it explains the various options. I'd be open to beefing up the documentation around it. Perhaps a note that if you leave it at the default value of en you'll piss off OG and you really should set it to a more specific locale like en-US, en-GB, etc.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-locale. @jhabdas They probably view it as a \"feature\" hah.. Thanks.\nThe \"canonical\" _config.yml is here... so I wasn't too worried about adding the comments to the documentation's site config.\nBut still a good addition. I know a few people like to use /docs as a starter... going so far as forgetting to remove my Google Adsense banners from their sites :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:. Looks to me whatever edits you made to _includes/analytics-providers/google-universal.html broke things. You have invalid {% if %} statement wrapping the entire GA tracking script, which is why it's not appearing in your HTML source.\nIt should be this https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/analytics-providers/google-universal.html\n```html\n\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');</p>\n<p>ga('create', '{{ site.analytics.google.tracking_id }}', 'auto');\n  ga('send', 'pageview');\n\n```\nAnd then the YAML you have in your _config.yml should work.. Maybe it's a bug with an older version of Chrome. I'm on Version 57.0.2987.54 beta (64-bit) and the sidebar on all of those links works just fine for me.. The posts where it disappears for you... are they ones with the MathJax script? Entirely possible that's causing some sort of delay or conflict with the script that initializes the sticky sidebar.\nI'd suggest updating the theme (current version is 4.2.1) because I removed that a few versions ago and seems like you're using an older version (modified 4.0.10?) that doesn't have a lot of these fixes.. Looks good. Thanks!. Have a look at this set of commits on the develop branch. I've reworked the greedy nav to work better with long site titles and the nav links now float to the right. \nIt'll be released in the next version of the theme.. Added with latest release https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/4.2.2. Looks ok to me on an actual device. I know you have a modified version, sure you have the latest JS and CSS? How does the demo site look to you?\n\n. Not sure if it's related but on Chrome there were security warnings that blocked me from even loading your site. Guessing something with your SSL certificate is up.. Nope not in a work environment this time. Really strange because it works just fine in Safari and Firefox, Chrome must be really picky about this sort of thing. Usually it lets you bypass the unsafe warning and get at the site, but it totally shuts me out.\nNot on a VPN or behind any sort of firewall so who knows what's going on.\n. Using Chrome 56 (stable non-beta) at home and work in incognito mode to rule out any sort of extension issues. The security warning above shows for both in Windows and macOS on different IPs, so it's not DNS related or some sort of Firewall.\nI ran your site through some SSL checkers and everything seemed fine, so not sure what Chrome's issue is. . Everything related to SSL is complicated and a pain :wink:\nRemoving your domain cache worked. Sure hope you don't have a lot of Chrome users who cached the old cert... what a pain.. Good catch on the Layout page, forgot to escape the Liquid there. Not sure what value removing the comments has though as they don't appear to be extraneous to me.. You can easily remove them with a variety of methods. The theme at one point used the the compress layout which strips out comments and white-space. I took it out because there were some edge-cases where it could break JavaScript.\nBut if its something you want you can easily copy the compress layout to your site, add layout: compress to _layouts/default.html and away you go.\nFull instructions here: http://jch.penibelst.de/. Do you have a demo of how the TOC anchor history works?\nSince I'll have to maintain this bad boy when things break, I'd prefer not mess with ES6 right now. I'm barely competent writing vanilla JS and jQuery and don't want this to be a blocker if things need to be adjusted in the future.. How big is the AnchorJS dependency? If it's small I'd be interested in a PR that adds support for that and the TOC anchors to the URL bar, similar to how you did it on your site... without the ES6 rewrite :wink:\nA request came in recently to support it #860 . Not much to write up about it. I hooked up probot/stale to my GH repo and added a stale.yml config file. Done.. How does this affect servers not using HTTP/2... i'm guessing most don't. I don't really want to advocate it if it's going to hurt performance for the majority of the users. Especially according to this line:\n\nOnly use this tracking snippet if your visitors primarily use modern browsers to access your site.\n\nBeen trying not to open the \"over-optimized\" can of worms with the theme. I've always viewed it as starting point with just enough best practice nods to push newbies in the right direction. \nIf you care about this sort of stuff you're going to hack it up to your liking anyways and likely should be rolling your own theme. Afraid if I start down this path the next thing will be optimizing for the critical path... which would be really hard as a theme since I have no control over the sort of content people are going to load up.\nThen there are fonts... and how best to load those... and responsive images via srcset... and a million other things that would really amp up the complexity of using this theme.. Just tried to test this locally and getting this error in the console\nUncaught ReferenceError: anchors is not defined at main.min.js:5\nAs far as I can tell plugins/anchor.js was added to main.min.js and properly initialized.. You might want to branch off of develop. master doesn't have the latest stuff and it's likely going to be a pain for me to merge this in due to conflicts and such.. This is an easy one. For the pages not showing any CSS it's because you're missing the layout from their YAML Front Matter. Set that and it'll work. Guessing you'll want to use layout: single for the pages, and if they're an archive of documents use layout: archive.. You only had the defaults set for posts. You'd have to set them for the pages path (e.g. _pages) too and then they should work.. Smells like a Jekyll issue and not the theme. If the script is updated  after you run build:js then perhaps it's a caching issue. Have you tried running jekyll clean to wipe all your caches and the _site folder?\nOther than that I'm out of ideas. Theme files all sounds right, something is going on with Jekyll during the build. Could be some sort of bug you're encountering. Gem theme or is it a fork of the repo?. It is indeed a Jekyll issue. This same exact problem came up before and filed a ticket, forgot all about that.\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5676\nNot sure if or when there will be a fix. The problem is Jekyll will only override theme gem assets that have YAML Front Matter, like /assets/css/main.scss. That's why it's ignoring your modified JS files on build.. Closing as this an upstream issue with Jekyll.\nRelated #722 . @DaveBben I found a workaround until this is fixed upstream. If I add YAML Front Matter to main.min.js it can be overridden. In the next release of MM I'll push it out. All you'll have to do is add:\n```\n\n```\nto the top of your modified /assets/js/main.min.js file and it should override the theme gem's version. . Hopefully that's soon, think I saw it was slated for Jekyll 3.5.\nJust pushed an update to MM. Run bundle update and you should get version 4.3.0. Let me know how it works out.. Fantastic! Thanks for checking. . Looks to me the CSS you wrote is doing what instructed to do.\nSingle column (12 of 12) @ $small \n\nand two column (6 of 12) @ medium and up.\n\nRefinery29 looks to me to be using a 4 column layout. If you want to match that then you'd want span(3 of 12).. That'll be really tricky due to the breakpoints. If you look at the compiled CSS it throws in float clears using various nth-child declarations which you have to override or else the layout will break. \nYou're probably better off looking at flexbox than using Susy's float based grids. But that doesn't have as well off browser support.. This might give you some ideas https://zellwk.com/blog/susy-gallery-problems/. Closing. Feel free to re-open with updates or more information if you managed to get this working.. Think you might be confusing what sort of index pages Jekyll Archives actually creates. The plugin builds indexes for specific tags and categories depending on what's been assigned in your posts. \nFor example if you have a post with tags: foo, bar Jekyll Archives will create /tags/foo/index.html and /tags/bar/index.html.\nIt doesn't create pages at /tags/index.htmlor /categories/index.html. You'll have to build those yourself.. You'll have to modify the theme's CSS to do this. If you set the following declaration it will justify the post/page content.\ncss\n.page__content {\n  text-align: justify;\n}. Yes, that's the right place. Here would work https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/_page.scss#L53. @YannisPap Sure... with more CSS.\ncss\n.sidebar__right {\n  text-align: left;\n}. There isn't a single setting for this. You'll have to make some edits the theme's CSS. Depending on your comfort level with that it could really easy or a pain.\nThe archive styles are in the _archive.scss partial. There are styling declarations for list (think that's what you're using) and grid view.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/_archive.scss\nI'd verify you're using layout: archive on your home and blog pages and not single. The widths look narrow to me compared to what I have on the demo site.. I'd suggest giving the Jekyll docs a good looking over and read up on how pagination works. The error message pretty much tells you what's going on. \nJekyll pagination is looking for an index.html file in the root of your site. That's likely harmless if you don't care about paginating your home page. My guess you have the pagination settings in your _config.yml file which is telling Jekyll to look for site.paginator in an index.html file that may or may not exist.\nEither of those conditions will throw that error.\nIf you're still having problems then check out the Jekyll forum. This sort of thing is a general \"I have a question about X\" with Jekyll and not really specific to the theme. Chances are your question has been asked a few times before and you can find the answer there.\nThe issues on the Jekyll repo is a good place to search too through closed/open tickets.. Also just saw the title of this issue. The renaming is the issue. Jekyll's paginator only works with .html files as per the docs.\n\nPagination only works within HTML files\nPagination does not work from within Markdown or Textile files from your Jekyll site. Pagination works when called from within the HTML file, named index.html, which optionally may reside in and produce pagination from within a subdirectory, via the paginate_path configuration value.. Not exactly the same as a list view of posts with teaser images, but have you looked at the grid view? It's used to create the \"related posts\" module and the portfolio demo page.\n\nIf you add type=\"grid\" to the include it'll spit out HTML markup to do a grid layout (4 x 4) with title, teaser image, post excerpt, and meta info.\nhtml\n{% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %}. And to assign a teaser image to a post/page/document you add the following YAML Front Matter to references the image's path:\nyaml\nheader:\n  teaser: \"assets/images/markup-syntax-highlighting-teaser.jpg\". @anhluong You could try removing the <div class=\"archive\"></div> wrappers as they have CSS that contains the width and floats to the right... which is why the alignment is off.\n. @anhluong You'll likely need some custom CSS to override that then. The grid view was designed for a listing with a single heading as shown here (source).\nBy adding additional headings like \"Current Projects\" and \"Previous Projects\" are causing the alignment to be off. If you clear the floats you can get it to work. I forget what issue, but if you look through the closed ones you'll likely find a solution with sample code. This has come up numerous times before by others wanting to do the same thing.. This issue has been marked as stale. Please feel free to reopen if:\n\n\nThis is a bug and you can still reproduce using the latest version of the theme. Please reply with any additional information you have to keep the issue open.\n\n\nThis is a feature request and can elaborate on why you feel more than 80% of users would find it beneficial.\n\n\nThanks for your contribution :smile:.. This is due to Markdown. The theme allows Markdown in titles via the markdownify filter Which is converting n.  into an ordered list item. Will have to investigate possible solutions. Thinking there's a way to escape those characters so Kramdown doesn't process them.\nIf not I'll have to add some sort of config to enable/disable Markdown titles which I'd rather not do.. As suspected there is a way to tell Kramdown to ignore something.\nyaml\ntitle: \"{::nomarkdown}42.{:/} Layout: Header Video\"\nWill give you the output you want.. Closing as this appears to be solved.. Questions of this nature are good candidates for asking the Jekyll community over on talk.jekyllrb.com since it's not Minimal Mistakes or theme specific.\nThe error above is actually pretty descriptive of the issue. It's telling you there is a problem with your Sass in assets/css/main.scss. It references line 38 so that's a good place to start.\nPretty sure the problem are these lines:\nscss\n@import \"base\",\n        \"bigfoot-default\", // hello there\n        \"layout\",\n        \"syntax-highlighting\";\nThey're trying to load Sass partials that don't exist in _sass directory as indicated by the error. Because you're using a Ruby theme gem it's looking for them there... \nIf you're trying to customize BigFoot.js's CSS then I would remove those lines from main.scss. You have assets/css/bigfoot-default.scss already created, just add YAML Front Matter to it and Jekyll will process it.\n```yaml\n\n```\nThen you can drop a <link> element into your head to pull it in.\nThe other option is drop the compiled CSS for BigFoot into your /assets/css/ directory, create a local copy /_includes/head/custom.html and add it there if you don't want to bother with the SCSS version.. Closing. Feel free to re-open with updates or more information to help resolve the issue.. Not without you modifying the theme directly. You could add it to this line.. Looks like a legit bug to me. If you want to submit a PR against the develop branch that removes the {% if site.data.ui-text[site.locale].related_label %} around that heading I'll get it merged in.. Thanks for taking care of this @Bounga.. I'll have to give this some thought as I didn't really want to build a nav with any sort of hierarchy. That's why I purposely went with the \"greedy nav\" pattern that is fairly flat.\nI'm not entirely sure how it would work combining the two, and would likely get messy.. I've done it exactly how you broke down the data file above with children objects. It's not terribly hard and there's plenty of tutorials out there that you could lift the CSS/JS to make it work.\nI would just rip out the entire GreedyNav script and CSS and start from scratch as you'll be fighting it otherwise.. Hard to tell from the screenshot...\n\nDoes the page just end there?\nWhat happens to the page when you expand/collapse the \"Toggle Menu\" button\n  \nDo other pages that use different layouts have the same issue? Home page, Post page, Page with custom sidebar\n\nI don't have an Android device so it's hard for me to isolate what part of the CSS may be causing layout issues. If I had to guess it's related to something in the sidebar as that uses position: sticky that may be buggy in your particular browser.\n. Could be related to this JavaScript that sticks the footer. But not sure since I can't reproduce to debug.. Closing as I can't reproduce. Feel free to reopen with any additional details if this is still an issue with the latest version of the theme.. Thanks!. Update your origin, you're pushing to the wrong repo :wink:. Supporting multi-language content is out of the scope of what I'm doing with the theme. There's really no standardization on how best to do it. \nIt's even harder to bake it all into the theme without over complicating things for the average user... someone who is only ever going to write content in a single language.\nThere's several plugins out there that propose to do this. Along with even more blog posts on the method's people are using. Until Jekyll bakes in support for this natively I don't want to touch it. A biggie would be for them to support localizing dates without needing to resort to a bunch of messy Liquid code.\nFor more context here's some older issues asking for the same thing #612 and #50.. Sitemap generation is done by the Jekyll Sitemap plugin. So any questions or unexpected results when using it should be filed on that repo.\nThat said I think this is an easy fix on your part. There are some small differences in the jekyll serve and jekyll build commands. The big one obviously is serve fires up a server.\nIt also overrides url: in your _config.yml to localhost:4000, which is why you're seeing it in the sitemap.xml file it generates.\nIf you run bundle exec jekyll build instead that will build your site and use whatever domain is currently assigned to url in your _config.yml. If you're hosting on GitHub Pages I'm pretty it sets it for you automatically in the case you omitted it.. @bastoGrande That's is a question for core Jekyll and has nothing to do with the theme.\nAs stated above they built in some logic to override site.url to localhost:4000 when starting a development server, since that's what you likely want locally when testing. When you run jekyll build it doesn't do that and will uses whatever values you've assigned for url in your _config.yml.\nIf you want to disable that behavior when running a local jekyll serve you need to use environment variables. See the official docs, but essentially you run JEKYLL_ENV=prod jekyll serve to force production instead of the default development.. Fantastic. Thanks!. I'm not seeing any errors in the open graph debugger. There are some warnings, but those shouldn't affect sharing.\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmilkyklim.com%2F12-things-to-do-in-aachen%2F\n. FYI - you're pushing to the wrong origin repo :wink:. Good suggestion. I made the switch to last_modified_at recently on my personal site for this exact reason. Total meant to update MM to user it to. Thanks for the reminder!. Fantastic! Thanks for this.. @lunaryorn I'm not ready to roll out a new release but you can replace gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" with the following in your Gemfile.\nruby\ngem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :github => \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\"\nIt will build the gem for you using the latest on master. It's a nice trick if you want to be current without waiting for an actual gem release on Rubygems.. Try updating the theme to the latest. According to the source you're on a much older version. \nFor example in your HTML source I see this which tells me parts of your site are using outdated files:\nhtml\n<!doctype html>\n<!--\n  Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.2.2 by Michael Rose\n  Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n  Free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license\n  https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n-->\nCSS and JS are that way too. Probably something is out of sync when you customized the scripts and stylesheets to add Lunr search and BigFoot.\nIf you look at the demo site you'll see how the source and various assets have the version number printed at the top.\nHTML source:\nhtml\n<!--\n  Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.3.1 by Michael Rose\n  Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n  Free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license\n  https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n-->\nMain CSS source:\ncss\n/*!\n * Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.3.1 by Michael Rose\n * Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n * Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n*/\nMain JavaScript source:\njs\n/*!\n * Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.3.1 by Michael Rose\n * Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n * Licensed under MIT\n */\nI'd suggest either backtracking what changes you made and comparing against the MM repo. I recently rebuilt the greedy nav so these commits are a good place for you start comparing against.. The Ruby gem bundles in _layouts, _includes, _sass, assets/css/main.scss, and assets/js. If you're using the theme as a gem then you have no need for those files and they can be removed. \nIf you keep them they will override the ones bundled in the gem which is probably why things aren't working. Just keep the files you specifically customized, but make sure they have any upstream updates as well. \nOther than that I don't really have any other advice.. What's your browser? Looks fine to me in latest Chrome, FF, IE, and Safari.\n\n. I see what you mean. I'll have to look into a fix, not sure if I can do anything about it though.\nWhat's going on is the header and footer elements are absolutely positioned with CSS so they overlap on top of the YouTube embed. Seems like a bug with YouTube's CSS. They would need to be absolutely positioned on top of the page. \nMaybe I can override that, maybe not.. Looks like the browser applies these styles to the <iframe> when in fullscreen mode.\ncss\niframe:-webkit-full-screen {\n    position: fixed;\n    min-width: 0px;\n    max-width: none;\n    min-height: 0px;\n    max-height: none;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    left: 0px;\n    top: 0px;\n    margin: 0px !important;\n    padding: 0px !important;\n    border-width: 0px !important;\n    border-style: initial !important;\n    border-color: initial !important;\n    border-image: initial !important;\n}\nuser agent stylesheet\n:-webkit-full-screen {\n    background-color: white;\n    z-index: 2147483647;\n}\nWhich with such a high z-index it should be placed on top of the masthead and footer who have a z-index of 20. But for whatever reason it's not.\nTurning off z-index on those two elements fixes it, but breaks the rest of the site.. css\n:-webkit-full-screen-ancestor .masthead,\n:-webkit-full-screen-ancestor .page__footer {\n  position: static;\n}\nThis should fix it for webkit browsers and Chrome.. @lokowebdesign For starters that site isn't even using the Minimal Mistakes theme \ud83d\ude1d .\nYour problem is the #header container is appearing on top of it due to z-index order. Add something really high to .fluid-width-video-wrapper like z-index: 9999 and it'll fix the issue.\nSafari's web developer tools are your friend. Just start inspecting elements and it becomes pretty clear what's going on if you check the CSS properties of the problematic elements.. You have 3 options:\n\nAdd a header image to the post which will then be used for og:image. You can do that this way.\nDefine a site-wide image for og:image to use in your _config.yml:\n   og_image: path-to-image.jpg\nIf you don't want a page header image but still want to specify what is used for og:image you'll need to modify _includes/seo.html. You could add another condition to use something like og_image: path-to-image.jpg in your post's YAML Front Matter:\n\ndiff\n  {% if page.header.image %}\n    <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.header.image contains \"://\" %}{{ page.header.image }}{% else %}{{ page.header.image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n  {% elsif page.header.overlay_image %}\n    <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.header.overlay_image contains \"://\" %}{{ page.header.overlay_image }}{% else %}{{ page.header.overlay_image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n  {% elsif page.header.teaser %}\n    <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.header.teaser contains \"://\" %}{{ page.header.teaser }}{% else %}{{ page.header.teaser | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n+ {% elsif page.og_image %}\n+   <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.og_image contains \"://\" %}{{ page.og_image }}{% else %}{{ page.og_image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n  {% elsif site.og_image %}\n    <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if site.og_image contains \"://\" %}{{ site.og_image }}{% else %}{{ site.og_image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n  {% endif %}\n.

Please reply with any additional information you have to keep the issue open.\n\n\nThis is a feature request and can elaborate on why you feel more than 80% of users would find it beneficial.\n\n\nThanks for your contribution :smile:.. Since the sidebar on the demo site is working as expected, I suspect something broke with your fork. Did you make any changes to the layouts or includes? That would be my guess.\nQuick way to check your version is to view source. I think you have an older version of the theme because you don't even have a version number. If you look at the demo site you'll see this (which is the latest version)\nhtml\n<!--\n  Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.3.1 by Michael Rose\n  Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n  Free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license\n  https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n-->\nAnd since you're hosting with GitHub there's really no easy way to update other than copying all of the files from the MM repo to yours. Which can get tricky if you made any changes. Here's my suggestions on how to handle updates. Things are much easier if you didn't modify any of the core theme files.\n. RE: Disqus not working. You don't have a valid shortname in _config.yml. Consult the configuration docs which has a link to an article on Disqus' site for figuring out your shortname.. Not sure if this is needed. You can already add HTML using sidebar.text. It accepts Markdown which also should accept HTML since Kramdown processes both.\nDoes this not work?\nhtml\nsidebar:\n  - title: \"Title\"\n    image: http://placehold.it/350x250\n    image_alt: \"image\"\n    text: \"<strong>Here's some HTML.</strong>\". If you use literal line scalar in YAML (e.g. |)  multiline HTML should work just fine. I tested this with no issues.\nyaml\nsidebar:\n  - title: \"Another Title\"\n    text: |\n      <table>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Sample cell 1</td>\n          <td>Sample cell 2</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>. @RichStone If you need that sort of flexibility you'll need to hack the theme. I'm pretty sure there is no way to pull in a Jekyll include via YAML Front Matter... at least not without some added logic to the theme.. Yes. You need to use a page header image.\nyaml\nheader:\n  image: path-to-image.jpg\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#headers\n. Not currently. You could hack the theme to do it though. \nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/seo.html#L90-98. Something like this should do the trick:\nhtml\n{% if page.header.image %}\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.header.image contains \"://\" %}{{ page.header.image }}{% else %}{{ page.header.image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n{% elsif page.header.overlay_image %}\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.header.overlay_image contains \"://\" %}{{ page.header.overlay_image }}{% else %}{{ page.header.overlay_image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n{% elsif page.header.teaser %}\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.header.teaser contains \"://\" %}{{ page.header.teaser }}{% else %}{{ page.header.teaser | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n{% elsif page.og_image %}\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.og_image contains \"://\" %}{{ page.og_image }}{% else %}{{ page.og_image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n{% elsif site.og_image %}\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if site.og_image contains \"://\" %}{{ site.og_image }}{% else %}{{ site.og_image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\n{% endif %}. They could. Guess it depends on how you expect to use them. page.header.teaser are optional smaller images used in grid view lists (e.g. related posts module).\n\nSo if you populate that field in your post/page YAML the image will be used for OpenGraph and will also appear on the page in certain locations. \nIf you don't want that behavior then the additional of page.og_image to _includes/seo.html would fit the bill.. Yes they could.\nIn general there's a lot of refactoring and cleanup that could be done to the /_includes/seo.html. I plan on replacing it with Jekyll's SEO tag plugin, but haven't gotten around to it yet.\nBut essentially something like this that sets defaults could work. The logic being... if page.header.image is defined use that otherwise fallback to page.header.teaser which fallsback to page.og_image.\n```\n{% assign seo_page_image = page.header.image | default: page.header.teaser | default: page.og_image %}\n{% unless seo_page_image contains \"://\" %}\n  {% assign seo_page_image = seo_page_image | absolute_url %}\n{% endif %}\n{% if seo_page_image %}\n  \n{% endif %}. The OpenGraph Debugger is your friend. The og:image is correct in the HTML so that part is right. OpenGraph data is cached (not sure for how long) which is why it's showing the old image.\n\nHit rescrape to force it to refresh.\n\n. No problem.\nNot entirely sure on the caching. I know as far as Facebook is concerned when I've tried to share a link and noticed the image was wrong, if I rescraped it with the debug tool then tried to share again it would be updated.\nBut I don't know if it's immediate for links that have already been shared. That's a question for Facebook and LinkedIn.\nGoing to close this as you seem to have it working.. Great, thanks @m4jing.. Can you give some more detail? I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for here.. You can do this quite easily by just adding the script embed here _includes/scripts.html\nOr to one of the the custom head/footer includes created exactly for the purpose of adding 3rd party scripts and assets. \n\n_includes/head/custom.html\n_includes/footer/custom.html\n. I have it near the footer as a common best practice to avoid impacting page load speed negatively. Scripts can block the loading of the main content so moving them after is one way to avoid that.\n\nYou can certainly move it to the top if you want. In my experience having GA in the footer doesn't affect analytics gathered much. Google wants you to load it first to grab everything about the user as soon as possible. There's a chance with it in the bottom that someone visits your page, abandons before the GA script loads and it won't capture that data.\nPersonally I'd rather give priority to the page content and not an analytics package, especially since the user could care less about that.. I suggest using something like the Favicon Generator. It will create several favicons with instructions on how to load them. Essentially you drop all the icons into your site and then paste in some HTML in the <head>.\nThe theme has a file just for doing this which you can add here: /_includes/head/custom.html\nThis question has been asked a few times before so if you need more guidance give these issues a look. You can also Google around as this is a common web development need and isn't specific to this theme or Jekyll.. If you fire up your browser's web dev tools it'll show you if there are any bad paths. You can place the favicons wherever you want, you'll just need to update the href path in those link elements to match. If you put them in /assets/images then you'll want paths something like: href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon.png\" or href=\"{{ apple-touch-icon.png | prepend: '/assets/images' | absolute_url }}\".\nAlso browsers tend to cache favicons so they don't always update right away. The Real Favicon site has a tool to verify on their homepage to check if you've loaded favicons correctly.\nClosing as this isn't a theme issue. If you're still having troubles I'd suggest poking around Stackoverflow or similar web dev forums for help.. 3rd party themes installed as a Ruby gem aren't currently supported when you host with GitHub Pages.\nYou either have to fork the theme and use it that way, build it locally and push up just the contents of your _site folder, or use a CI service to deploy it for you to GH.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#github-pages-compatible-method\n. The archive single include has a type flag on it. If you call it with {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %} it'll output the HTML needed for a grid element.\nYou'll also need to wrap it with a for loop that has a post object... similar to the example above. If you look at the _includes/archive-single.html you'll get a better idea of what actual YAML variables it uses. \nThe grid images are assigned with header.teaser and not the overlay images. You can see an example here which is used to build the \"related posts\" module at the bottom of a post.\n\n. Feel free to reopen if you're still having trouble and can provide additional info or a link to a public repo to better assist.. Trying to avoid these sorts of customization because they lead to more customizations of this nature. It's a simple 1 line CSS declaration so I don't feel too bad not including it as a SCSS variable.\nThat and in good conscious I can't provide the option for justified type as it almost always looks awful on the web :wink:. This was done to ease the pain of those using the theme gem version who just want to modify some of the values in _variables.scss. Which I find is the vast majority of users of the theme.\nPreviously the only way to do that was to copy the entire set of _sass partials into your local files to override them all because of how Jekyll processes them. This defeats the whole point of having a theme gem.\nBy placing all of the theme's _sass partials in subfolder it allowed me to pull all of the @imports out of /assets/css/main.scss and clean things up. It also allows a user to add Sass variable overrides or custom CSS directly to main.scss.\nNow you can do something like this with main.scss:\n```scss\nmain.scss\n\n@charset \"utf-8\";\n/ Theme overrides /\n$paragraph-indent: true;\n$link-color: red;\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\";\n```\nVersus the old way where you'd need to @import all of the partials too. Which isn't really that great in the long run, especially if I add, remove, or rename partials.\n```scss\nmain.scss\n\n/!\n * Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.3.1 by Michael Rose\n * Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n * Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n/\n/\n   Variables\n   ========================================================================== /\n@import \"variables\";\n/\n   Vendor\n   ========================================================================== /\n/ Breakpoint - media query mixins /\n@import \"vendor/breakpoint/breakpoint\";\n@include breakpoint-set(\"to ems\", true);\n/ Font Awesome - icon font set /\n@import \"vendor/font-awesome/font-awesome\";\n/ Magnific Popup - responsive lightbox /\n@import \"vendor/magnific-popup/magnific-popup\"; // Magnific Popup\n/ Susy - grid mixins /\n$susy: (\n  columns: 12,\n  gutters: 1/4,\n  math: fluid,\n  output: float,\n  gutter-position: after,\n  container: $large,\n  global-box-sizing: border-box,\n  // debug: (\n  //   image: show,\n  //   color: blue,\n  //   output: overlay,\n  //   toggle: top right,\n  // ),\n);\n@import \"vendor/susy/susy\";\n/\n   Base\n   ========================================================================== /\n@import \"mixins\";\n@import \"reset\";\n@import \"base\";\n@import \"utilities\";\n@import \"animations\";\n@import \"tables\";\n@import \"buttons\";\n@import \"notices\";\n@import \"masthead\";\n@import \"navigation\";\n@import \"footer\";\n@import \"syntax\";\n@import \"forms\";\n/\n   Layout specific\n   ========================================================================== /\n@import \"page\";\n@import \"archive\";\n@import \"sidebar\";\n@import \"print\";\n/ Them overrides /\n$paragraph-indent: true;\n$link-color: red;\n```\n\nThis is a pattern adopted by several other themes, the biggie being Jekyll's default Minima.. Put your SCSS/CSS overrides after the @import \"minimal-mistakes\", placing them before won't override anything.\nThe only stuff you want to put before the @import would be any Sass variables you're changing. Because of the way those are read in by the Sass parser they need to come before.. What files have you made customizations to? Layouts and includes aren't a problem since you can override them one by one with local copies in _layouts and _includes. \n_sass files on the other hand are problematic because of how Jekyll process them. It's an all or nothing which means you have to take the entire _sass folder from the bundled theme gem and copy it locally... then make your edits there. Which as you guessed has a lot of issues if you want to stay in sync with the theme.\nWhen I tested this all out I created a local copy of assets/css/main.scss and added my new CSS after the @import. Those styles were appended right after the core styles of the theme.\nIf you want to change any of the values found in _sass/minimal-mistakes/_variables.scss then you add those before the @import and because of the way Sass handles !default values they will be applied in place of the core values.\nJust to make sure you don't have some files in the wrong location I would suggest adding this to /assets/css/main.scss as a test,\nscss\n.foo {\n  display: block;\n}\nThen build your site and look at /css/main.css and at the end you should see .foo { display: block; }. If you don't then the file structure is likely off.\nAlso I would suggest creating a branch off of master and push those changes up to your repo to get Travis to ignore. Then I can see your actual code since I can only speculate what the issue is.. Thanks @Stelios3g . You're pushing to the wrong repo. Check your origin. . @aabiro Check your remote repo. \ngit remote -v\nWhen you forked it it's probably still pointing to the MM repo. You need to update your remote origin to point to your repo.. Fixed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/e0099ffa5ab959178b118f8cb00b90b7d2fb3934. Thanks.. The Jekyll Archives method won't work on GitHub Pages hosted sites because that plugin isn't whitelisted for use so you need to go with the Liquid method.\nNo idea what the \"Github pages is down for maintenance\" error is all about. I'd reach out to support since I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the theme or Jekyll. That error occurs for every page, asset (JS, CSS, etc). and as you noted resolves itself after a reload.. You're missing the category archive page, that's why it's 404'ing. Add it to your root similar to tag-archive.html.\ncategory-archive.html. Good catch @satwikkansal . Closed as this negatively impacts build times.. Your _config.yml looks correct but when I inspect the page source the Disqus script isn't there. Is your repo public so that I can look at it?\nYAML can do buggy things if your formatting is off a space or two, so it's possible there's some formatting screwing things up.\nHow about the /college post. What do you have in it's YAML Front Matter? Have you tried adding comments: true there to see if that works?. Figured out your problem. You're using smart quotes around the disqus key in your _config.yml which breaks the logic of the LIquid conditional that adds the Disqus script.\nyaml\ncomments:\n  provider               : \u201cdisqus\u201d\nIt should be this\nyaml\ncomments:\n  provider               : \"disqus\"\nOr you can even remove the quotes all together provider: disqus.. FYI you're pushing to the wrong remote repo. Check that your Git origin is set properly.. This theme doesn't support footnotes like I have them on my personal site.\nI'm using a JavaScript plugin called Bigfoot.js to do them so they pop-up. You'd have to customize the Minimal Mistakes theme a little to do it.. No plans right now. Trying to keep it to the minimum.. Check the jekyll-sitemap plugin's documentation. You need to add sitemap: false to your post or pages you don't want included.\nClosing as this isn't a theme issue. If sitemap: false isn't working then something is up with their plugin which the theme uses.. Related issue: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap/pull/164\nApparently sitemap: false is no longer needed for 404.html pages. Can't throw an error since that's part of Jekyll and the layouts are using Liquid. When hosting on GitHub Pages they automatically populate url for you regardless if you do or don't in _config.yml.\nWhen you test locally it obviously will be blank. A bunch of stuff won't work if you don't assign a url. So not really sure if that's the theme's fault or just one of those Jekyll 101 things everyone should be aware of and do.. This issue has been marked as stale. Please feel free to reopen if:\n\n\nThis is a bug and you can still reproduce using the latest version of the theme. Please reply with any additional information you have to keep the issue open.\n\n\nThis is a feature request and can elaborate on why you feel more than 80% of users would find it beneficial.\n\n\nThanks for your contribution :smile:.. Closing as this is not a theme issue and is hosting related.. Check origin on your remote repo... you're pushing to the wrong repo :wink:. Looking at your repo you don't have comments: true in it's YAML Front Matter. That's why comments are not displaying.\nThis is what you have.\n```yaml\ntitle: \u5173\u4e8e\npermalink: /about/\ndate: 2015-07-23\n\n```\nIt should be this:\n```yaml\ntitle: \u5173\u4e8e\npermalink: /about/\ndate: 2015-07-23\ncomments: true\n\n```. What you have should work, not sure why it's not.\nWhat happens if you remove / and do this in your _config.yml instead?\npaginate_path: /page:num/. Think you're out of luck then as it appears to be a limitation with Jekyll's pagination plugin. All of their examples use page:num vs what you want page/:num.\nThe plugin is no longer being developed so not sure if filling a bug there will have any effect. \nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate\nAs an alternative Jekyll Paginate v2 is pretty great and more feature filled but it doesn't work with GitHub Pages unless you're building locally and pushing the built_site folder instead of having GH build.\nhttps://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2. No worries.. The grid view was designed to be used in the \"related posts\" module so it's not exactly portable to putting on the homepage or other layouts without some alteration.\nDepending on how familiar/comfortable with CSS this could be easy or hard to fix. Check these previous issues as others have tried to do the same thing with varying success.\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/623\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/875\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/953\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/892. Images pull from a post/page YAML that is set like this:\n\nyaml\nheader:\n  teaser: path-to-image.jpg\nIf one isn't set it fallsback to site.teaser which can be set in your _config.yml.. @jhabdas Huh?. If you ask me, the real noise comes more from the mistaken PR's every time someone new to Git tries to update their blog with this theme.. I'm not too concerned about it. More of an observation than a hindrance for me.. Overriding Sass partials found in a theme gem is somewhat limited due to how Jekyll processes them. They're not like _includes and _layouts where you can override a specific file by adding it to your root folder.\nTo override the Sass you need to copy the entire _sass folder, which defeats the purpose of using a theme gem since you'll have to stay in sync with any changes.\nThe alternative is to copy /assets/css/main.scss to the same location locally. And then add any style overrides after @import \"minimal-mistakes\";.\nIn your case it would look something like this:\n```scss\nOnly the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)\n\n@charset \"utf-8\";\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\";\n// your styles here\n .masthead__menu { \n  color: red;\n}\n```. I was just pasting in the CSS you wrote as an example. You'll need to write CSS that will actually do something.\nTo override the masthead link color you'll need something like .greedy-nav a { color: red; }. .masthead_menu { color: red; } won't do anything due to how the cascade works.. The styling you can easily take care of by adding some custom CSS to the main stylesheet. The entire comment's section has the class .page__comments so you could very easily change the font (or other styling) for just that section.\nThe same could be said for making it collapsible that expands by adding custom JS to _includes/scripts.html.\nI'd rather not bake either into the theme as they're the sort of thing some people will want and others won't. I've tried to make the theme easily customizable to allow you to tailor it as you see fit.. Edit _layouts/default.html and paste in the scripts where you want them. They'll be applied to every page.. What version of Chrome? The sidebar uses position: sticky which Chrome recently added support for, so it's possible something is amiss if you're using an older version.\nAre you using any other Jekyll plugins or custom JavaScript that might conflict with the theme? If you open your site with Chrome's web developer tools and switch to the console tab are there any script or other errors/warnings?. The reason it works in Safari and Firefox is due to what I mentioned above with regards to position: sticky support. You're using an older version of the theme that had some JavaScript that compensated for browsers that didn't support sticking the sidebar. \nYour custom script is likely breaking the theme's script which affects Chrome. If you upgrade to the current version of the theme it likely won't be a problem anymore since I removed those scripts. \nThe alternative is for you to fix the custom script. I'd check if it's breaking other things like the collapsible top nav and author links on mobile. There's a good chance of its breaking the sidebar is breaking other things.. Ah OK. If you're using the theme gem version then you should be set with bundle update.\nHow are you including your custom scripts? In the post itself? That might be the problem. It might need to come after the theme scripts found near the bottom of the page.\nWhat sort of errors are in the browser console? That will point you in the right direction to what's going on.\nIs the site or repo public? Pretty much impossible for me to debug further without seeing the code.. I'm not going to be much help since JavaScript isn't really my forte. If there was an obvious error or warning I might have been able to point you in a direction, but I'm fairly clueless here.\nSomething is obviously going on with the extra scripts your adding. Perhaps they're targeting the sidebar or sticky classes as it appears everything is fine when the page loads, and then a second later the entire sidebar jumps to the upper left corner.\nAs I mentioned earlier the theme did at one point have a polyfill for position: sticky but that was removed. I'm not familiar with the scripts you added to know what they even do to try and counteract it. But seeing how the issue stops when you remove them maybe investigate them further.\nIf you remove the sticky class from the sidebar div the problem goes away. It seems like the scripts you've added are getting confused with that are trying to compensate for something.. This is something you can add with a plugin or the addition of a simple script and .json file. \nSee this issue as others have it working with the theme.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/588\n. Any solution I add will likely still be a pain to setup as it require a search page to be created. Similar to the category/tag implementation. \nOne of my other themes has search built in and it's fairly fragile and not something I enjoy supporting which is why I've left it out of this theme.. Simple Jekyll Search is hardly new. I've used it in a few projects and it has the same flaw as most. The json you need to build to act as a search index is easy to break with malformed data.. That worries me to as I don't have a good place to put it without completely gutting the masthead/navbar \ud83d\ude10. That's probably how I'd handle it. Cue PRs and issues asking for it to be placed first/last in the list, always be visible, and various other custom placements \ud83d\ude02. You might be able to, but the vast majority of users in academia using my theme as a simple way to spit out Markdown docs usually can't. Jekyll in general is a steep learning curve just because of all the baggage you need to be familiar with (Markdown, setting up a Ruby environment, HTML/CSS best practices, etc.)\nFor something I put out there for free expectations need to be kept in check. Bootstrap or a premium Wordpress theme this project is not.. @ohadschn I don't think there's a way to do this without introducing even more complexity and configuration to the theme. Any sort of UI widget I built will have to be customized to fit whatever search method you go with.\nAnd at that point it will defeat the purpose of me including it in the theme because there will be those who don't want to override an _include or _layout.\nShow me some examples of Jekyll themes` that and I might re-consider:\n\n[ ] Have a search input in the masthead/header/nav bar etc.\n[ ] Allow for different search plugins/backends (Lunr.js plugin, Algolia, Jekyll simple search, Google Custom Search Engine, custom .json template, etc.)\n\nMost themes I've seen who have search baked-in, either use one prescribed method (not ideal), or just link to a search.md page where they dump in their own search form that hooks into whatever plugin or .json method they're using.. I have a feeling a Google site search box is the least desired option from the bunch... your site needs to be indexed well with the Googs, Google haters will piss on it, etc.\nI'd lean towards a simple search using a .json template to build the index. But my experience rolling that into a theme isn't great and I end up fielding a lot of \"my search is broken\" issues because it's extremely easy to break and inject invalid JSON depending on your content.. You'd be surprised how many aren't indexed or indexed well. I get emails, tweets, GH issues all the time from those who've added a Google site search box and get no results thinking something is broken.\nThe issue is almost always Jekyll powered blog, hosted on GitHub Pages or with a new domain name. New sites aren't always crawled right away even if you setup Google Search Console and explaining the finer points around that and SEO is another area I don't really want dip into :wink:. @nickgarlis I'm still not convinced I want to bake this into the theme. But if you have a demo and source of it publicly somewhere for me to look at I will. If I think it's something easily incorporated into the theme then a PR would be the next step.\nIf not, then at the least there's a working example for others to follow.. @nickgarlis Looks to be on the right track. Your solution is what I was thinking... put the search form on a page versus trying to stuff it in the header.\nI think if you abstract the search page into a new layout eg. _layouts/search.html that should cover the UI portion of the request. If a user wants search they create a new page search.md, give it layout: search, and/or place a link to it in their header... and call it a day.. @ohadschn Search bar will be an exclusive feature in the $90 MM Premium upgrade :wink:. @nickgarlis Good job, can't think of anything you missed. One small suggestion would be to flip the order of the search input and {{ content }} in the search.html. Just in case someone wanted to add some text to that page, might make sense for it to appear before the form.\n```html\n{{ content }}\n\n\n```\nOther than that if you want to fire it off as a PR I'll work on merging it in and adding some documentation around it.. Thanks, the link has been corrected. https://kramdown.gettalong.org/converter/html.html#toc\nThe TOC helper only works in a Markdown file because that's how it is created. Kramdown (the Markdown parser used by Jekyll) generates it automatically using the headings in your .md file.\nThere are handful of JavaScript solutions out there you could use if needed, but not something I'm interested in adding to the theme.. Yes it's possible to like to posts, pages, and external links. The trick is you need to supply the correct path to the post/page.\nIn your example you're linking to the post's source location which will give you a broken link. Instead you need the path to it where it actually lives on your site. This will vary depending on what you have set for your permalink structure in _config.yml.\nBut as an example if you had something like permalink: /:title/, your post filename of _posts/2017-01-23-layout-header-video.md would be set as url: \"/layout-header-video/\".\nIf you're unsure of what the post's URL is I would suggest building your site, navigate to it, and then grab the URL. You can lop off the http:// and domain bit since the feature_row include will add it for you.. This issue has been marked as stale. Please feel free to reopen if:\n\n\nThis is a bug and you can still reproduce using the latest version of the theme. Please reply with any additional information you have to keep the issue open.\n\n\nThis is a feature request and can elaborate on why you feel more than 80% of users would find it beneficial.\n\n\nThanks for your contribution :smile:.. Duplicate of #554. See that issue for fixes:\n\nInstall Jekyll Related Posts plugin\nOr replace two files with patched versions\n\n. You'll need to modify/override the theme's CSS to do this. The CSS you'll need to change is in _sass/minimal-mistakes/_navigations.scss\nSince you're working with the theme gem version you'll need to follow the relevant instructions on this page in the docs.\nEssentially...\n\nCopy the contents of /assets/css/main.scss from the theme gem to .\nAdd your CSS overrides to <your_project>/assets/css/main.scss.\n\nThe CSS will end up being something like this, where you change the background-color to whatever color you want the underline.\ncss\n.greedy-nav a:before {\n  background: mix(#fff, $primary-color, 50%);\n}. Try this:\ncss\n.greedy-nav .visible-links a:before {\n  background-color: red;\n}\nIf you use your browser's web developer inspector tool you can right click any element and it'll give you a hint as to what you need to override. \n\nAlso you don't need both background and background-color. Just use background-color since it's more specific. background is a shorthand for a bunch of other properties that might override things you don't want.\nClosing as this is CSS related and better suited for a forum like Stackoverflow.. Perhaps. \nI've done mine own version of a JSON Feed layout. Still want to switch to jekyll-seo-tag plugin and standardize on the use of page.image or page.image.feed instead of page.image.feature to better leverage the official Jekyll plugins that use those variables.. Good question. Just a miss when I forked the layout.There were a few other things I simplified and removed. Dropping the for loop should improve build times slightly too.\nsort and uniq are good ideas as well.\n. Closing as I don't really have any interest in managing a layout for this. My concerns are all echo'd here https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/issues/172\nYour best bet is looking for a plugin/gem that does this or rolling your own layout.. Thanks @mtlynch . See these lines in _reset.scss. I'd leave the variable font sizes alone and instead adjust the sizes in the reset. The theme scales the font sizes up/down globally depending on the width of the screen.\n```scss\nhtml {\n  / apply a natural box layout model to all elements /\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  background-color: $background-color;\n  font-size: 16px;\n@include breakpoint($medium) {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n@include breakpoint($large) {\n    font-size: 20px;\n  }\n@include breakpoint($x-large) {\n    font-size: 22px;\n  }\n}\n``. Looks like plain old HTML to me, not Liquid/Ruby/etc. Not sure I follow what the issue is. Should just be able to paste this into your posts. Or tact it on in a layout or include to keep things DRY.. The HTML above isn't valid so that's likely your problem. For example you end it withbut there is no opening`.\nNot sure if you wrote that HTML or if it came from somewhere but I'd double check it for accuracy/validity. \nAs far as styling maybe give Stackoverflow or CSS tutorials a go. You don't have to write Sass, it will accept vanilla CSS if you're more comfortable with that.. This is a good tool to identify invalid markup https://validator.w3.org/. You'll want to update your origin as you're pushing to the wrong remote repo.. @Stelios3g care to weigh in?\nAs far as adding RSS, the feed is technically Atom and not RSS. People commonly interchange them but they're two different specs which is why I went with \"Feed\".. FYI you're pushing to the wrong remote repo. Check your origin to make sure it's pointing to your repo instead of this one.. You may want to ask this question on https://talk.jekyllrb.com/ as it's not a theme specific one. I believe your issue is your trying to list collection documents (_brainplay and _scribbles) in reverse cron but they don't have any concept of date like _posts do.\nTo do that I believe you'd have to add a date field to their YAML front matter and then sort on that in your for loops.. The date field isn't add to the demo site. That's because what you're seeing there are \"posts\"... which automatically get date populated by their filename.\nYou're trying to do that with \"collections\", which don't share that behavior. Instead I believe they are sorted alphabetically by default. I'd inquire in the Jekyll forum or Stackoverflow as it's a core Jekyll behavior and not theme related.. That's because you're using Markdown and it thinks the indented <h2> line should be a \"code block\", which isn't rendering it as HTML. \nEither rename the file to .html instead or collapse the indents to something like this:\nhtml\n{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n{% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n{% if year != written_year %}\n<h2 id=\"{{ year | slugify }}\" class=\"archive__subtitle\">{{ year }}</h2>\n{% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}\n{% endif %}\n{% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}. This is a really easy \"first commit\" if someone wants to help out and submit a pull request to change modified to last_modified_at in sample posts and docs.. Fixed in #929 . Thanks @wg1j . Thanks @hkalant . Good catch. Thanks.. Thanks for the typo fix.. Thanks!. Do you know if this affects desktop browsers that could benefit from turning on cleartype? And if the line even needs to be there anymore? Looking at that commit from the mobile H5BP, that project was deprecated years ago.\nAnd in the main H5BP they don't use the cleartype meta line at all.. I'm not too worried about it failing some validation as the W3C validator\nalready flags a few things. In my experience there's always a few things\nthat will trip it up which have no impact on the user.\nThinking I'll leave it in as is... with the expectation to remove it\neventually. I couldn't find much documentation on it other than people\ncomplaining about blurry fonts a few years ago. Which who knows if its an\nissue now a days with modern browsers.\nOn Wed, Jun 28, 2017 at 3:48 PM, Justin Rummel notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nUnfortunately I'm not a knowledgeable resource on this item. I was running\nmy site through some validators (Rocket Validator specifically) and this\nitem surfaced. I thought the general site could use this update vs.\ncreating a local _includes/head.html gem override. I did question if the\nright course of action would to remove the line entirely... but again I'm\nnot sure.\nI don't know if this effects all other browsers... I've only tested on\nDesktop and Mobile Safari, everything looks fine.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/1087#issuecomment-311767554,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABUB7Qo1Xk3pugpmLD8VBYbpRrOu2ramks5sIq30gaJpZM4OIS29\n.\n. @palatinux Could you combine these two commits into a single PR?. The easiest way is to fork, create a new branch from master, add your commits, push that branch up, then submit a PR.\n\nYou can also keep pushing commits to this branch, though looking up above looks like you might have deleted the source branch.\nIt's a cleaner merge if it's all in one PR, something this small doesn't need to be broken up into multiple PRs.. Not sure what's going on. I'm not seeing any script errors. Only thing I can think of Google changed the API or deprecated something.\nTo get this working originally I followed some instructions from a random blog post. I never could find official documentation from Google on how to embed G+ comments on a website. Wouldn't surprise me at all if they turned this feature off for new posts as they've been scaling back the whole G+ thing the last couple of years.\nIf you can find some documentation on how to fix or implement it directly from the horse's mouth I'll happily apply it.. A PR with this fix would be great.. FYI you're pushing to the wrong remote repo. Check your origin. There's no proper way to build a list in the way you want. You either have to define all the links using this method, or hack something to loop over your collections like you have above.. Sure. The theme doesn't care what your content is. Simply add HTML using the <video> element and you're good to go in your posts or pages.\nhtml\n<video src=\"/assets/video/your-video.mp4\" controls>\nAll modern browsers support that, so unless you need older browsers to work with it you won't need to add any JavaScript or 3rd party video players.\nClosing this as it's not theme specific. If you need additional help Stackoverflow or other related web development sites would be the place to go.. Thanks @dansat!. Thanks for the PR. I've already made this change. To my knowledge it changed from gems to plugins in Jekyll 3.5.0, as per their release notes.\n\nThe gems key in the _config.yml is now plugins. This is backwards-compatible, as Jekyll will gracefully upgrade gems to plugins if you use the former.\nhttp://jekyllrb.com/news/2017/06/15/jekyll-3-5-0-released/. No worries. I hit the same warning too when I was testing.. If I had to guess it's due to one of the 3rd party mixins I'm using (Breakpoint, Susy, etc.). I'll see if I can track down which Sass partial is the issue and see if they have updated their libraries to get around the warnings.. Investigate 3rd party Sass\n\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/vendor. Found the culprit, Susy 2's set of mixins.\n\nThese deprecation warnings are mostly harmless but figured I'd go ahead and upgrade to Susy 3 anyways. That project went through a fairly serious rewrite so I had to refactor a lot of the CSS I was using to build the theme's grid.\nEverything looks good to me, but if anyone wants to test and verify I didn't break anything (specifically grid layouts in related posts, galleries, etc) give it a go.\nTo test you can replace the entire _sass folder with this one in the susy-3-upgrade branch. Or if you're using the theme gem replace gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" with this line:\nruby\ngem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch => \"susy-3-upgrade\". Great, thanks for confirming @wkc1986. I'll get this merged into the next release.. Good to hear @justinrummel. Kind of bummed with all the helper functions Susy removed with v3. All of the gallery mixins are gone which makes doing custom stuff a lot more involved. Especially for those who want to customize the columns. #623 #875 . Fixed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/4ba7cccdc449107f17ee654ec9ca6b6ae2dddf7f. Not sure why you'd want to do this, but from my perspective it's probably next to impossible to impliment.\nEach major version of the theme can be wildly different between the underlining HTML and CSS. 4.0 is a complete rebuild and almost none of it shares the same code from prior versions.\nIf it was just CSS changes you could probably rig up something that swaps what .css is loaded, but because the actual class names and structure of most _layouts and _includes change between versions that won't work.. Probably. I don't have much experience with doing that. I think that's more of a Jekyll question than a theme question.\nMight get some better help asking on the Jekyll Talk forum. You could look at the Bootstrap repo too for ideas. They use Jekyll to build their docs and I'm pretty sure they structure it in a way to archive each major version.. Thanks!. You need to modify the default index page to use the splash layout. You can see the entire source for the demo site in the /docs folder if you need an example.\n\nHome page splash example\n\nIf you search through the closed issues you'll find some more guidance as this has been asked a few times before.. Sorry not familiar with that script. My guess is you need to specify an empty element or selector to inject that content into. Not seeing that in your init function so maybe it's just defaulting it to the bottom of the page.. That regular page doesn't have any other content on it so it's not exactly a true test. The script content appears at the bottom of the page and nothing follows it. Still think there's something missing to tell it where to insert the content instead of the bottom of the page.\nI seriously doubt it's anything to do with the theme's stylesheets.. The issue is your script for whatever reason is building all of the svg elements outside of the main content article. Which is why the puzzles are all showing up at the bottom of the page.\nI know absolutely nothing about the script you're using, but I would start with their docs. Scripts of this nature should allow you to assign a selector when you configure it to tell the script where it should build. I can see in your source you have the script in the main content, but if you inspect the DOM you'll see it's putting the puzzles in the wrong location.\n\nThe theme has nothing to do with that, which tells me its 100% an issue with the custom script. This isn't happening with your simple test because there isn't a complex layout or additional content like a footer or page navigation like the MM theme.. The creator of the script is probably your best bet. Other than some basics, JavaScript really isn't my thing so I won't be much help on fixing it.. Glad you got it sorted out.. Take a look at #894. They eventually got Bigfoot.js working so you can likely peep their repo to see what you're doing differently.\nLooks like your errors above are Liquid related since main.min.js has Front Matter --- blocks. Guessing there might be a missing or extra { } or something else in your JavaScript that is causing Liquid to barf.. Also your best bet might be to add the BigFoot script by itself, instead of trying to squash it in with the rest of the theme. Because of the way theme gems works it might be a pain in the ass to sort out.\nIt won't be as performant as concatenating/minifying all the scripts together, but will likely get around the Liquid barfing.. The BigFoot.js script is up on various CDNs, so you should be able to link it fairly easy to test if that works.\nIf it does then I'm sure it can be made to work by concatenating it with the main theme script. Just might take some tinkering and/or running it through a JS linter to make sure it's all valid.. @emory https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/. These are just warnings and not errors. They're from 3rd party mixins which likely haven't updated for newer versions of Sass.\nIf the Sass compiles into CSS I wouldn't worry about it.. Nice. Going to close this as you seem to have it under control.. Works the same way for any page. You just add the YAML Front Matter to it. In this case it would be your index.html, index.md or any other page you want.\nFor example the MM demo site's homepage has a feature image and overlay. You can see the source here.. Nice! Thanks for the PR. When I get a chance I just want to give it a quick test and then I think it'll be easily merged in.. @juanramirez Think this is a legit bug. I don't have any AdBlockers installed and @diegonc's steps to reproduce work for me.\nWhat's going on is when the \"Follow\" button is clicked jQuery is applying inline styles to display: none the author sidebar. Which is fine on mobile, but as soon as you scale the page up it still has display: none and therefore the content inside of it doesn't show.\nI'll probably switch the trigger to apply a close class instead of using jQuery's fadeToggle, which gives me more flexibility to style and avoid disappearing content.\nI don't think this is a huge bug as the only people likely to be bit by it are developers or those who like to mess with browser window sizes to test for responsiveness. The average user isn't going to view a page on mobile, hit the follow button twice, then magically scale up their screen to a desktop size :wink:. Closing as it appears you're filing an issue on the wrong theme. \nYou'll want to reach out to the developer of that them here https://github.com/DevTips/Artists-Theme. Thanks for the PR @austinseraphin . The issue is the path used in your script. /sigma.js is just the folder. You need to actually point it to a JavaScript file. Which looking at your repo might be /sigma.js/build/sigma.min.js. I'm unfamiliar with Sigma so I would check their docs what files or plugin scripts are necessary to load.\nYou'll probably want to use Jekyll's relative_url filter to make sure the path resolves correctly as well.\nI'd do something like:\njs \n<script src=\"{{ '/sigma.js/build/sigma.min.js' | relative_url }}\"></script>\nAs this is a \"how do I use Jekyll\" issue and not theme specific I'm closing. If you need further help I'd suggest reading the Jekyll docs or asking for help on talk.jekyllrb.com or Stackoverflow.. Thank's for the PR. I'm purposely not merging in PR's of this sort because they're super easy to add yourself. I've provided instructions for ways of making these additions depending on how you've installed the theme.\nThe author bio is already a mess of Liquid soup, and I'm trying to avoid it turning into a 500 line monster with every possible social network ;-). It's definitely a balancing act. Customization and using pre-built themes has its limitations, as you're finding out.. Sure feel free to submit a PR to beef up the documentation. Can probably add a note or a sub-section under the Ruby Gem quick start in the docs.. I don't think GH Pages has the latest Jekyll yet with this change. Roll it back to gems in your _config.yml until they update it.\nClosing as this is github/github-pages related and not a theme issue.. Duplicate of #1144 \nChange plugins: in your _config.yml back to gems:. GitHub Pages doesn't use the version of Jekyll that accepts this key change. What's happening is the Jekyll Feed plugin isn't loading, so your feed.xml file isn't being created.\nOnce github/github-pages updates to support Jekyll 3.5 plugins should work.. The $global-transition variable isn't used everywhere, so setting it to none won't disable all animations.\nFor example the page fade in animation is applied to the #main element and doesn't use the global transition.\n```scss\nmain {\n@include container;\n  @include clearfix;\n  margin-top: 2em;\n  padding-left: 1em;\n  padding-right: 1em;\n  animation: intro 0.3s both;\n  ...\n}\n```\nYou'll need to override all of those as well. Unless someone wants to create a pull request that swaps animation: intro 0.3s both with a new Sass variable that can be set...\n```scss\n$intro-transition: intro 0.3s both;\nmain {\nanimation: $intro-transition;\n  ...\n}\n``. Works great. Adding the following toassets/css/main.scss` disables the fade in animations as expected.\n```scss\nOnly the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)\n\n@charset \"utf-8\";\n$intro-transition: none;\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\";\n```\nThanks for taking the time to submit the PR and address the issue @peterdimou . Thanks!. Good idea. Thanks for taking the time to beef up the docs.. Sounds like a Jekyll issue. For macOS I use rvm to manage Ruby but I haven't messed with it in years. I'll have to check what version I'm using. \nSame for Windows. In definitely not using anything recent there since it's sort of a pain to install Ruby on Windows 7.\nThe only dep that was bumped with this MM release was Jekyll to 3.5. Which also bumps Liquid from 3 to 4 I believe. Not aware of any new Ruby requirements but maybe check their issues to see if it's a known problem. \n3.5 and 3.5.1 have been out for awhile.. https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6216. Ok. Don't have experience with fish shell so I'll be of little help. \nClosing as this isn't theme related.. No way to go back. Susy 3 killed a lot of the mixins I used with the theme and just provides simplified functions. I'll have to see if I can match the math in places it changed. \nAs long as the layout didn't break I'm cool with some differences.\n. @dev4223 That's close, but the math is still off.\n@justinrummel The original intention with was to have the main content appear centered on the page, with equal amounts of white space on the left and right. In the old version with Susy 2, the math wasn't exactly there, but it looked close visually.\nI'm going to take another stab at it to try and balance things out since Susy 3 simplified some things. Might be easier to get the math exact.\n. Pushed some improvements to get the page and archive layouts where I've always wanted them.\n\n\nCenter main content block\nFix \"table of contents\" sidebar overlap and improvement alignment so it fits in the white-space to the right of the main content. Similar to how the author side bar fits to the left.\n\nI haven't merged it into master yet but if you want to give it a spin it's in the layout-adjustments branch and can be used by adding this line to your Gemfile\ngem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch => \"layout-adjustments\". That's right. I wanted to push the TOC out of the main content block since it doesn't always flow well. For instance with code blocks it cuts part of them off. Moving it to the dead space on the right avoids all that.\n\nI pushed a fix that if you place the {% include toc %} further down the page, it will be positioned at the top and align with the main content.\n\nI tend to drop the TOC include in after the first paragraph to avoid being pulled into the auto-generated post.excerpt. Placing it at the end of your Markdown file isn't ideal when the page is viewed on mobile when the content collapses down to a single column.\nThe TOC will be after the content, which defeats the purpose of it.\n\nLet me know your thoughts and if this works out with your existing content.. Should be fixed now. I forgot to include a negative margin for the smaller screen sizes, so the TOC wasn't getting pushed to the right.. Nice. Thanks for testing!. Thanks for the PR @ducthienbui97, but as @halirutan linked to... I'm not accepting these sorts of adds. It is easy enough to customize I don't think it's productive to add every possible social network to the author sidebar.\nIt'll be never ending, and never quite match the order someone expects them to be listed in.. If I had to guess it's likely screwing with assets/js/main.min.js\nI've seen minifiers bork it because of the YAML Front Matter block.\n```\nlayout:\n```\nShould be easy to verify by diffing the file bundled in the gem against what's in _site/assets/js/. Was thinking the same thing about the banner text. Since 3.5 fixed the issue, adding the blank front matter doesn't need to happen anymore. \nThe hamburger should only show when the menu items are wider than what can fit on screen. If you had one menu item that is fairly short you could potential never see a hamburger because it fits comfortability in the viewport. \nAnything that overflows outside of it gets placed in the hamburger drop down with this script.. @ashmaroli I removed the blank YAML Front Matter --- --- from assets/js/main.min.js if you want to test out what's on master:\nruby\ngem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :github => \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\"\nLet me know if the JS is still getting mangled by those minifier plugins.. Sweet! Thanks for identifying the issue. Never felt great adding the blank YAML to that file to make it \"overridable\", glad it could be removed.. Thanks @ducthienbui97 . I'm aware. It's intentionally included near the closing </body> element to improve page loading performance.\nI care more about potentially speeding up the page load for a visitor than Google Analytics being able to track a partial page load (the reason Google suggests placing in the head).. Sorry, I don't have any experience with Docker so not sure what to suggest. I'll leave this open in case someone else knows more.\nMaybe ask for help on https://talk.jekyllrb.com ?. Thanks for the typo fix.. This is intentional, see #356 for context.\nIf you prefer minute(s) read instead of minute read you can change that text to whatever you'd like in _data/ui-text.yml.\nyaml\n minute_read: \"minute read\". Thanks for this. You're right, it was related to the last couple of commits.\nTable of contents don't typically show up on the splash layout so it wasn't something I designed for or noticed. Pushing a fix shortly.. @vortexing Right side TOCs should work. I fixed this in the commit https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/d59818981bdd8d05d182aa5f482895e833a95398 above back in November.. Thanks!. That margin is being added to <body> to compensate for the footer that is absolutely positioned to the bottom of the page. Without it there's a possibility it would overlap content making it impossible to see it.\nThat said if you'd like to remove it you'll need to:\n\n\nEdit /assets/js/_main.js by removing these lines\n    ```js\n    // Sticky footer\n    var bumpIt = function() {\n      $('body').css('margin-bottom', $('.page__footer').outerHeight(true));\n    },\n    didResize = false;\nbumpIt();\n``\n3. Rebuild the theme's JS file by runningnpm run build:js... [see the documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/javascript/#customizing) for additional guidance.. Example with margin bottom added to` so the main content clears the footer.\n\n\n\nExample with it removed... you can see the footer overlaps the main content (banner ad at the bottom is now obscured by footer)\n\n. Thanks @rjkaes . Thanks for the PR and making that minor edit.. @tendon That's handled not by the theme but by jekyll/jekyll-feed plugin.. Which is pretty much what we're using now, just with a few filters to deal with index.html in paths.. I believe the thinking behind discoureUrl was to feed it a protocol-less URL. SO instead of:\ncomments:\n  provider: \"discourse\"\n  discourse:\n    server: \"http://discourse.example.com/\"\nYou give it this:\ncomments:\n  provider: \"discourse\"\n  discourse:\n    server: \"discourse.example.com\"\nWhich is probably more of a documentation issue than an actual bug.. @tendon Smells like an issue with your environment or configuration. If you are triggering the correct Jekyll production environment that path should be absolute. Your PR just swapped the absolute_url filter with site.url and site.baseurl prepends which should be the same.\nIf they're not and you're getting relative URLs then it's a bug with Jekyll... or perhaps you're on an older version that needs updating.. @tendon People like to use protocol less URLs so they can swap between both https:// and http:// (secure/insecure)... usually when building for dev/prod environments.\nAs far as the browser is concerned http://yourdomain.com and //yourdomain.com are the same. You'll see protcol-less URLs a lot in <script> embeds for things like jQuery on CDNs and the like.. Nope, it shouldn't.\nReference: https://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/. But it will if you're just opening local .html files in a browser. When opened from a file server (which is where they will eventually live) it's not an issue.\nWhen in doubt fire up Jekyll's server with jekyll serve and test your site that way. Opening the pages directly without the WEBbrick server that Jekyll spins up is probably why you're having problems.. My hesitation to removing the // is it's not backwards compatible and will break sites that don't specify a protocol for site.comments.discourse.server... eg. meta.discourse.org\nAdding a note to the documentation that make it clearer that you shouldn't add a protocol to comments.discourse.server in _config.yml is the way to go for sure.\nWhat I would suggest is adding some logic to the capture and test for :// in the variable. If it's there leave it alone... if not then prepend: '//'. I do something similar with images to test if they're relatively hosted or externally.\nThere could be some edge cases that doesn't catch so not sure if that's the best way forward either. My guess is Discourse is so rarely used with the theme it's not a big issue. Though I'd feel better if those who actually use it chime in, if the current implication needs improvement/is broken.. Will do. Thanks for taking the time to start the discussion. Always good to get feedback on parts of the theme that might not be working as expected.. I have nothing to do with Susy so can't really say since those Sass files are included in the theme untouched.\nSmells like a possible file encoding issue from this error you're getting.\nConversion error: Jekyll::Converters::Scss encountered an error while converting 'assets/css/main.scss':\nInvalid US-ASCII character \"\\xE2\" on line 54\njekyll 3.5.2 | Error: Invalid US-ASCII character \"\\xE2\" on line 54. I also don't have experience with Docker so it could be something there, or related to you having a different version of the Sass gem installed.\nWhen Jekyll updated to 3.5.1 so did Sass which is when it started warning about functions in Susy that would eventually be deprecated in Sass 4.. @kmassada That wouldn't surprise me. It's usually the case with Ruby and gems. Going to close this as it doesn't appear to be theme related.\nFeel free to re-open if that's not the case.. Editing the font-sizes in reset.scss is the right way. The reason it's not working for you is due to misconfiguration and the location of the CSS files.\nReference the documentation about structure and MM repo. Not sure why you moved _sass inside of assets/ but that needs to live at the root. Also assets/css/main.css shouldn't existed in your repo. That's the compiled stylesheet which is what the theme is using. That's why your changes aren't appearing.\nGet rid of that and replace with assets/css/main.scss. If you make those two changes correctly main.scss will load all of the Sass partials in _sass... which you can customize and Jekyll will build a new _site/assets/css/main.css.. Still looks like you don't have the _sass folder setup correctly. I would suggest starting over and fork the theme so you have all the correct files. \nThen make your edits, set the config, add content, etc.. -1 was what it previously was but it appeared below the main content. There's probably something else at play I'll have to adjust.. I can't reproduce it on any of demo site's sample pages. Do you see the overlap there? \nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\nPerhaps it has to do with customizations you've made.. \n\n\n. You need to use the latest on master. There's some additionally CSS that was added in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/173f18404725c8930603a1aa356a51aadefaa905 to the .sidebar element to position it above the main content. The CSS you're using on your site is missing that.. Thanks.. @dontito94 The branch you're committing this to is old and outdated. I'm just keeping it around for reference purposes for those who may be using version 2 of this theme. Everything @ashmaroli suggested is the preferred way to use the theme.. I'd prefer not to hide comments as they can be considered \"content\" in a lot of cases.\nAlso, the preferred method to hiding would be to add the element you'd like to hide to _sass/minimal-mistakes/_print.scss.. Gotcha. Yes, please add the form class to _print.scss to hide instead of adding a no-print class to the HTML.. This is Chrome issue that I thought I fixed awhile ago. Will have to take another look. My guess is an element is being stretched vertically, creating the extra blank pages.\ncc/ #909 #919. You have a public repo somewhere I can inspect? Hard to tell what's going on without seeing your actual _config.yml and post content.. Got it. Looks like this was from #1179 \n<div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div> was added to _includes/comments-providers/disqus.html when it shouldn't have been.. This one might be tricky to get right. The grid items use nth-child selectors to float and clear floats at various breakpoints.\nDepending on where you inject the category headings it might be viewed as a child element and that could explain the overlapping. You'll most likely need to add some <div>s or other wrappers to combat the nth-child CSS so it only applies to the grid items and not the headings. Then make sure the headings clear any floats.\nThe relevant CSS is all in _archive.scss if you want to get a feel for what's going on.. I'm talking about these lines https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_archive.scss#L114-L189\nYou'll see all sorts of &:nth-child selectors in there.\nIn it's most simplest form you should have HTML like this:\n```html\nHeading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading 2\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nThe CSS for .grid_item uses the nth-child selectors to position the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. grid items in a repeatable pattern so everything lines up.\nWhat you need to do is clear the floated grid__item elements.\nAdd clear: both to .grid__wrapper and to .archive__subtitle and it should fix your problem.. No shouldn't matter. For what it's worth when I look at your site it's aligned correctly.\n. You have to use the HTML entity title_separator: \"&#124;\". The | pipe character means something in YAML and it's getting tripped up there.\nDuplicate of #760 . Sure. You can use the \"Link Post\" code to get an idea of how to do this. You'll most likely need to alter the theme some.\nIf you go to the Year Archive and scroll down to Post: Link you'll see it links to an external site... and the link icon goes to the post's permalink. \nRelevant source files:\n\n_includes/archive-single.html\npost-link.md. The current indentation is correct. It isn't supposed to be indented under comments. Doing so will break things as the theme uses site.staticman not site.comments.staticman. It is. Staticman needs it to be site.staticman for it to properly read its config settings. \n\nWay around that is moving to v2 which takes the Staticman settings out of _config.yml and into its own dedicated file, staticman.yml.\nThere are some breaking changes in doing that, see #803. Looks good. Thanks!. SCSS has been refactored to better hand \"skinning\". If anyone wants to play around with it and provide feedback, the changes can be found in the color-skins branch.\nProbably the easiest way to enable it is by using the pre-release theme gem, add the following to your Gemfile:\ngem 'minimal-mistakes-jekyll', :git => 'https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git', :branch => 'color-skins'\nAnd then set which skin you'd like to use with minimal_mistakes_skin: in your _config.yml file.\nDark skin: dark\n\n\nContrast skin: contrast\n\n\nSunrise skin: sunrise\n\n\n. ### Dirt skin: dirt\n\n. ### Air skin: air\n\n. ### Mint skin: mint\n\n. @justinrummel I'm guessing you have an outdated _sass/_forms.scss file or one of the comments includes.\nform should have background-color: $form-background-color; which will fill it in with a darker color like this:\n. How bad is the original one? I get a lot of these requests to change translated text for a given locale and it becomes a battle with people constantly submitting PRs to change it back and fourth.\nThe ui-text.yml data file is completely editable by the user. My intention was to provide a base line of texts and then its up to the user to tailor those to suit their site/needs.. This isn't a theme issue. Google and other search engines can take time to spider and index your site. You'll want to use Google's webmaster tools to submit your site, point it at your sitemap.xml, etc. to start that process.\nSearch around for SEO best practices as that's what you'll want to work on to get your content ranking.. I think this is pretty rare... having a string of your length without any spaces. That's what is breaking the layout.\nThe better option would be to apply some CSS that truncates it with ... for any characters that don't fit in the space.\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/hub/blogs/ellipse-my-text/. Titles that overflow the parent are now truncated with an ellipsis to avoid breaking the layout.\n. Closed for all of the reasons cited in #1142, #820, #779, #709, #360, #299, and many more.. The way Jekyll handles _sass files you have to actually override the entire folder for it to accept any of your changes. So even if you override _reset.scss it won't take. And as you pointed out that's a large file and probably something you don't want to mess with if possible.\nThere's actually a simpler solution. Because of the way CSS works, you can add all of your custom overrides or \"new\" CSS to a single file, assets/css/main.scss. \nThis file has 2 lines, and the chances of it changing are slim to none since all it does is import another Sass partial that contains all of the theme's components and modules.\nSo what you can do is add any overriding/new CSS after the @import minimal-mistakes;, in your case:\n```scss\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\";\nhtml {\n  font-size: 16px; // change to whatever\n@include breakpoint($medium) {\n    font-size: 18px; // change to whatever\n  }\n@include breakpoint($large) {\n    font-size: 20px; // change to whatever\n  }\n@include breakpoint($x-large) {\n    font-size: 22px; // change to whatever\n  }\n}\n```\nThese will cascade and override the font-sizes declared earlier in the CSS.. Setting a font-size in pixels on the base html element is a common way of laying the foundation for responsive typography. Google around and you'll find some articles/blog posts that explain it better than I could.\nThe type-size-x variables are just em based sizes that act as multipliers of the base font sizes set in pixels.\nFor example when the screen size is less than $medium you have a base size of 16px. If you set an element with $type-size-4 or 1.25em it's essentially doing 16 x 1.25 to give you 20px size. @medium and where the base size jumps to 18px you'll get 18 x 1.25 or 22.5px, @large 20px you'll get 20 x 1.25 or 25px, and so on and so fourth.. You got it.. @MV10 yes this should work. Your issue might be how styles are cascading and specificity depending on what you're trying to do . What does the content of your /assets/css/main.scss look like?\nIf you override any variables found in _sass/_variables.scss by placing them in your main.scss without the !default they will override.\nAnd if you're adding CSS to main.scss it needs to appear after the imports so it overrides anything in the bundled CSS. That's how the \"cascade\" in CSS works, what comes last overrides what came before it.. @MV10 I just tested this locally and it worked perfectly for me. The font sizes reduced in size.\nLooks to me like you have a caching issue. Is this happening locally or on GitHub Pages? You'll need to clear your browser cache and likely wait for GH to pickup the change and flush whatever cache of the site assets it has as well.\nNo idea if there is a way to force that on their end or not.. What's the repo with these changes made that you're not seeing reflected on GH Pages?\nI'd like to clone it and see if I can reproduce and/or see what's being missed. Because I tried this exact thing from a base MM install locally using the GitHub Pages gem, and it worked perfectly.\nCan you verify that you've setup your Gemfile for use with gem \"github-pages\", and tried building things locally? That would help eliminate some caching issues with GH Pages as building locally in this manner takes it out of the equation.. UI wise this sort of makes sense, but I'm not really sure how to bake it into the theme. There's too many conditions to contend with and if I open this one up for customization it could really make things complicated for both the maintainer and user.. TOC is defined in a post via Kramdown's auto table of contents feature, where as the sidebar nav is done through YAML Front Matter.\nWhat happens when someone defines a sidebar and a TOC?. There are layout considerations too. The way I'm injecting the TOC to the right now is a bit of a CSS hack. It get's complicated with the sidebar because that would live outside of the post, where as the TOC lives inside, so that could be a challenge to layout correctly.\nThey're essentially two different beasts. That's why I put it in the left sidebar where it's built similar to the author links.. You can if you want. I have it flagged as under consideration because I haven't been convinced it needs to be in the theme.. I'm designing for the majority, and this feels like an edge case i don't really want to support.. Thing is since the original release of MM, the \"sidebar\" has been on the left and treated as ancillary author info.\nI've never been a fan of the typical blog layout with a junk drawer on the right that holds content, ads, table of contents, etc. Which is why I designed MM to be content focused with the minimal of author info on the left and content centered to its right.\nOver the years it has gotten bloated with \"enhancements\" to add every social network under the sun, support custom content, do navigation lists, etc. And adding a right sidebar to do the same fundamentally goes against my original intentions with the theme. Which one could argue is why the theme is popular in the first place.\nI can feel it slipping into \"designed by committee\" territory and that's something I'm trying reign back in. Especially since I'm the sole maintainer, problem solver, designer, and developer. If it's a feature/enhancement I don't believe in 100% there's no chance of it living.\nWith all the custom stuff in the theme it can be extremely confusing to get up and running with, and hardly earns the name \"minimal mistakes\" in those cases.. TOC is a different beast. It previously was included in the main content window. I'm only using a CSS hack to push it out to the right since it looks better visually, and has less overlapping issues with block elements.\nRecommended posts are pretty much the same thing as the \"related\" posts the theme currently supports. They appear below the posts. Too much of a distraction on the right.\nThere's plenty of themes out there that do the layout you want. MM can't possibly be all things to all people.. > Seriously though, I don't think a couple of \"recommended\" posts would be clutter, and it would be configurable anyway.\nNothing stopping from you forking and creating your own theme that exhibits your aesthetic.. There are boatloads of gem themes\nhttps://rubygems.org/search?utf8=\u2713&query=Jekyll+theme. 1. Try to mimic your \"featured posts\" markup to match the existing TOC markup. Then it can share presentation and styling. Quick glance above that looks like what you've done.\n2. Drop it into _layouts/single.html, probably as an include, and maybe behind some sort of conditional {% page.featured_posts %}{% include feature-posts.html %}{% endif %}.\nThe single layout would be the only file you need to override. It's a minimal change (likely a line or two depending on how you include the code), so maintaining it shouldn't be a problem for you. The layouts rarely change anyways so it's fairly safe.. I don't know if that JavaScript above will work. _includes files won't be something the browser will be able to access. You most likely will need to render it into your page somewhere during the Jekyll build, then use JavaScript to move it somewhere else.\nAs far as floating the TOC to the right or keeping it inline on mobile. I'd try to reuse .sidebar__right which absolutely positions the sidebar to the right on large and up.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_sidebar.scss#L59-L76\n```scss\n.sidebar__right {\n  margin-bottom: 1em;\n@include breakpoint($large) {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    width: $right-sidebar-width-narrow;\n    margin-right: -1 * $right-sidebar-width-narrow;\n    padding-left: 1em;\n    z-index: 10;\n  }\n@include breakpoint($x-large) {\n    width: $right-sidebar-width;\n    margin-right: -1 * $right-sidebar-width;\n  }\n}\n``. Yes. That's the right approach for showing the featured post on$largeviewport widths and up.. I don't think there is any way to do this. The{% include toc %}is a shortcut to print out{:toc}` which is used by Kramdown to auto-generate the table of contents based on the headlines of your Markdown file.\n{:toc} has to live inside of said Markdown file to be parsed when Kramdown does it thing. There's no way for me to bake this logic into a layout because of this.\nThere's probably a Jekyll plugin you could leverage to do it, but that wouldn't happen at the theme level.. Good solution @allejo, I've recommended it before for those who want some more flexibility over what Kramdown's auto TOC or JS solutions provide.\nDo you have any stats around the impact of using this include across a ton of post's? Have to think with it looping over all the content to pull out the headings there'll be a hit in jekyll build time.. --profile is the only one I'm really aware of too. A few seconds doesn't seem too bad. I've used some pure-Liquid methods to do some things related to pagination that completely killed a build and pushed it into minutes/hours territory.\nI have a fairly large site myself, when I get a chance I'll give it a test just to compare against.. Did some quick tests using the sample posts in this theme and I didn't really see any impact on build time.\n_includes/toc.html                                  |    94 |   29.43K | 0.413\nWhich is very encouraging. Seems like a valid replacement to me. There's probably a few second hit on a site with hundreds/thousands of posts, but I'm cool with that.\n@vahid-dan Looks like what you want to do is something I can bake into the theme. Thinking something like toc: true on a post/page would activate the Liquid TOC. And with YAML Front Matter defaults you could easily set it true for all your posts without having to had any garbage to your .md files.\nIf I ditch the Kramdown auto-generated TOC it frees me up to move it somewhere more semantic in the HTML layouts too.. This feature has been added to the theme. Haven't pushed a new theme gem version yet, but the updates are all on master if you're using the fork method.\nI've kept the old Kramdown based method in for now, but plan on removing that in the next version. To enable table of contents on pages using the single layout simply add toc: true to the front matter.\nThe icon and label title can both be changed per page just like with the old version.\n```yaml\ntoc: true\ntoc_label: \"My Custom Table of Contents Label\"\ntoc_icon: \"gear\"\n\n```\nTOC's can also be set globally for entire section of pages/posts using Front Matter defaults in _config.yml.. I fixed this already in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/c4ca06f4b9c96bf6d1f12996c91e0103f0630e56 for the group-by-array include in the root and under /docs. Perhaps you didn't pull down the latest /docs/_includes/group-by-array?\nTesting the demo site and /test sites with error_mode: strict come out error free now.. Not ready to push a release just yet, but you don't need me to do that.\nYou can just pull from what's on master by replacing gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" in your Gemfile with the following:\nruby\ngem 'minimal-mistakes-jekyll', :git => 'https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git'\nAnd if you need something more granular you can pull from specific commits, branches, tags, etc. Consult Bundler's documentation for the particulars.. Just life, my day job, family commitments, etc etc etc \ud83d\ude09. Which version of the theme are you using? What is your _config.yml settings? Do you have a public repo?. Looks like you're not using the theme so I won't be of much help. If you're trying to piece parts of this theme into another project you'll have to really dig in and make sure you're getting everything.\nYou've likely missed a configuration somewhere. Best I can offer is to check Jekyll's pagination docs to make sure you have everything configured.. For what it's worth I cloned your repo and built it locally, pagination works fine for me and all of the links resolve correctly.\n\nMaybe something is up with your development environment. You are running Jekyll with bundle exec jekyll serve correct?\nClosing as this isn't an issue with the Minimal Mistakes theme. The Jekyll help forum or Stackoverflow is a more appropriate place to ask these sorts of questions.. 1. Cloned your repo locally.\n2. bundle install\n3. bundle exec jekyll serve\n4. Visit http://localhost:4000\nAll of the paginator links work as expected.\nOn index/page 1 the HTML is this:\n```html\n\n\n Previous Button \nPrevious\n    <!-- Previous Page Button -->\n    <span style=\"display: none\" class=\"page-numbers current\"></span>\n\n    <!-- Current Page Button -->\n    <span class=\"page-numbers current\">1</span>\n\n    <!-- Next Page Button -->\n    <a href=\"/page/2/\" class=\"page-numbers\">2</a>\n\n    <!-- <span class=\"page-numbers dots\">...</span>\n    <a href=\"/page/8/\" class=\"page-numbers\">8</a> -->\n\n    <!-- Next Button -->\n    <a href=\"/page/2/\" class=\"page-numbers\">Next</a>\n</div>\n\n\n```\nAnd on page 2 it is this:\n```html\n\n\n Previous Button \nPrevious\n    <!-- Previous Page Button -->\n    <a href=\"/\" class=\"page-numbers\">1</a>\n\n    <!-- Current Page Button -->\n    <span class=\"page-numbers current\">2</span>\n\n    <!-- Next Page Button -->\n    <a href=\"/page/3/\" class=\"page-numbers\">3</a>\n\n    <!-- <span class=\"page-numbers dots\">...</span>\n    <a href=\"/page/8/\" class=\"page-numbers\">8</a> -->\n\n    <!-- Next Button -->\n    <a href=\"/page/3/\" class=\"page-numbers\">Next</a>\n</div>\n\n\n```\nIf you're getting links like /page/:num then there is something wrong with your local environment and the jekyll-paginate gem is likely not current or installed properly. I can't help you with that. You'll have to reach out on Stackoverflow or some other help forum.. There are  no hard-fast sizes. Something between 1280-1600px wide is a good balance for quality/file size as the same image will be used on mobile and desktop unless you implement some sort of responsive image solution.\nHeight is up to you and how much of the page you want it to occupy. Here's an example of an image orientated in landscape and another as portrait.. The theme already does this and has for some time. It also displays a list of categories a post belongs to.\nYou can look at any of the sample posts on the demo site to see them in action.\n\n. You need to make sure you have the correct archive type set in _config.yml. If you don't it won't activate the links.\nAll of the demo site's code is in the /docs folder if you need to check how something was done.\nYou also need to create the /tags and /categories pages. They aren't built by Jekyll Archives. There are a few duplicate issues around this (#811) and notes added to the documentation to clear it up. Give it a good look over.. Too opinionated. I'd rather not force this config onto anyone. . I did last week. It's enabled in the test site used when developing the theme with bundle exec rake preview.. Don't think so. That's Markdown. Maybe inquire with the Kramdown project as that's what Jekyll uses by default to parse .md files. Or look at the other Markdown parsers supported by Jekyll to see if they support shorter ways of linking images to other images.\nThe way the lightbox is currently configured is to trigger on any <a> element that links to a image. There are a ton of different ways of setting that up, all of which can be read about on the Magnific Popup documentation.\nClosing as this isn't really theme related as per the original request.. If that does the job for you should be fine to add as a custom bit of script to your overrides. \nDon't think it makes sense to bake it into the theme as a default.. I don't really get what problem this proposes to fix.. Maybe I'm being dense, but I still get what benefit this adds to the average user of the theme.. Just override _includes/scripts.html\nThere's barely anything in that file and is very likely not to change making it safe. \nAs far as pulling out jQuery into a CDN version. Not going to get into that debate. There's to many Stackoverflow and blog posts arguing the benefits of doing it and not.. Add your scripts after main.min.js which bundles jQuery with a few lines of JavaScript to init various plugins (e.g. lightbox).\nI'm screwed either way I do it. Include the CDN and someone will want to self host to avoid an external dependency. Bundle it and someone will want a CDN ref'd one. I've done it both ways in the past and it's a losing battle.\nI think you'll see this sort of things with themes in general. They can't possibly do ever suggested web performance suggestion and balance features/customization at the same time.\nUsers that are savvy enough to request this sort of stuff are likely out growing an \"open sourced\" theme and would be better served forking/building their own to fit needs. . Vast majority of users host for free with GitHub Pages, which already has some CDN power behind it. I'd be willing to wager performance isn't a concern or even considered in most cases. They're just happy to have a site up for free somewhere.. See #1241 for feature add.. The gem doesn't bundle in pages. You need to change your index file. It's likely using layout: home which pulls in some Jekyll Paginate code.. If you don't want a paginated home page use layout: archive instead and then drop in the relevant code into the body of the page.\nExample:\n```\nlayout: archive\n{% for post in posts %}\n  {% include archive-single.html %}\n{% endfor %}\n``. Could be a side affect of [jekyll-data](https://github.com/ashmaroli/jekyll-data). That gem is a dependency of the theme and takes_config.ymlthat's in the gem and \"flattens\" it with your custom_config.yml`.\nWhat's probably happening is when you comment out those lines in your config it's still picking up the values in the theme's _config.yml. Try setting them to nil to zero them out.\npaginate: nil\npaginate_path: nil\nIf nil doesn't work false might.. @douglangille See my note above. You need to zero out those variables in your _config.yml. Commenting them out just reverts back to using whatever values are in the bundle theme.\nNot sure if nil, false, or blank will do it, but one of them should.. I think there's a bug with jekyll-paginate-v2. I used a forked version of the theme and set:\npaginate: nil\npaginate_path: nil\nIn it's _config.yml and those same errors come up.\nConfig Warning: The `paginate` key must be a positive integer or nil. It's currently set to '\"nil\"'.\nConfig Warning: The `paginate` key must be a positive integer or nil. It's currently set to 'nil'.\nLooks to me the plugin isn't properly reading those values as nil. It's expecting not to see them at all in the config, which obviously won't work because of jekyll-data. Perhaps file an issue with jekyll-paginate-v2 to see if it can be patched.. I'm out of options. \nI don't know of any other way of overriding it other than using nil. Which the plugin doesn't seem to use in order to bounce it into backwards-compat mode.. I'll leave this open with the hope jekyll/jekyll addresses the hardcoded pagination bit.. Good point @ashmaroli. My mind was lumping _data and the _config.yml into one, but you're absolutely correct that it's not bundled with the theme gem.. @jaybe-jekyll Would you mind opening a new issue to track enhancing MM to support jekyll-paginate-v2? You could paste in exactly what you have above.\nThanks!. Looks about right. That should be everything.. Some of those scripts are breaking changes if updated. Out of scope for this PR.. Don't worry about it. I have it covered. Some of these I may drop or replace with lighter alternatives. Now that scripts can be added easily I don't need to bundle everything and can leave it up to the user to augment if they want.. Not sure. You'll have to test.\nIf memory serves Magnific Popup had some CSS changes that I didn't want to mess with so I didn't bother updating.\nGreedy nav had something I needed to override to fix a styling inconsistency.\nThe others I haven't looked at in a while.. I've seen that weird version of Ruby too when testing. What I think the issue is, is the missing Sass partials for the new skins. I haven't released it yet so maybe you have some sort of conflict using the 4.5.2 gem and what's currently only on color-skins in the MM repo.\nWhen I do a 4.6 release all the new skin stuff will be in the gem, but it's not there yet.. Think the issue is here in your Gemfile\n```\ngem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :github => \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\"\ngem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :github => \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\", :branch => 'color-skins'\n```\nYou're using the latest on master, which doesn't have the color skin stuff. You need to uncomment that second line if you want that.\nOr remove this line from your /assets/css/main.scss file.\nscss\n@import \"minimal-mistakes/skins/{{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin | default: 'default' }}\"; // skin. No worries. Should be released soon.... I'm not in love with any of these. The name -noplugins is misleading.\nI really don't think this needs to live in the theme as it's not something most users will need. It's adding extra complexity which I'm not a fan of.. Since all of the source files for the scripts are included, there is nothing stopping you from doing what you need to them. If that means running uglify to build just a minified version of _main.js without all the plugins included that should be doable.\nIf you're using a CI it's even easier since to my knowledge they allow you to run scripts at various points in the build process.\nThe reality is you've outgrown a pre-built theme for the masses and you either need to jump through hoops of this sort or better yet, build your own theme. That's exactly what I did years ago when I first started with Jekyll.. Yes these changes are necessary. I made some improvements/bug fixes specific for the MM theme.\nAt this point I would treat this script as a fork of the original.. Don't think that will be possible due to class names being different and the other changes I made to enhance it specifically for the theme.. It's possible, but not without some work on your part. I can give you some hints to get you started.\nIf you look at the feature row include you'll see I'm creating a variable called feature_row that is grabbing all of the data in the current page's YAML Front Matter.\nSince you want to grab that same data from a set of posts and not the current page, you need to scope it differently.  To start you'll need to modify /_includes/feature_row. If you only plan to use this on a page or two then you could dump the HTML/Liquid directly in the body of the page. Otherwise I'd create a new include to use (e.g. feature_row_posts).\nYou can keep the meat of the feature row logic, but ditch the 5 if/assign lines at the top. Then loop over site.posts, place a limit of 3 (or however many posts you want to show up), and you should be good to go.\n```html\n\n{% for f in site.posts limit:3 %}\n      can stay the same as the current feature_row include \n  {% endfor %}\n\n```\nAs long as your posts have Front Matter data that correspond with what feature_row expects, you'll be fine. Of course this is untested so I might have missed something. But should be enough to get you started.. You can also use the grid view include to do something similar. It's almost the same visually as a feature row, just 4 items across instead of 3, and no buttons.\nBest part you don't have to modify any of the includes to use it.\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid__wrapper\">\n  {% for post in site.posts limit:4 %}\n    {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %}\n  {% endfor %}\n</div>\n. This is somewhat subjective. Get why you'd want an alt description, but in it's current state it offers little value to screen readers here. Just adding the post's title to the image is redundant to the post title on the page already. If you turned on a screen reader or assistive technologies it would sound silly hearing it read the post title, then post title again as it hits the image.\nIdeally it would describe the image, which does benefit screen reader users.. This is how Jekyll works with tags. They're only used for posts. I believe there is a discussion on jekyll/jekyll about extending them to collections, but not sure if its being considered by the core team.. Don't think this needs to be in the core theme as it's specific to someone using htmlproofer. I'd rather not set defaults that most people don't need.. Consult Jekyll's documentation about setting a page's permalink.\nClosing as this isn't a theme issue.. You'll need to adjust the theme's CSS on .archive and .page. If you remove the right padding it should give you the effect you want.\n\nRelated: #623, #384, #74. You want to remove all of the files/folders within /assets, except anything you added as content. Meaning if you added images for posts and pages you'd leave those.\nCSS, JavaScript, and fonts that are part of the forked theme need to be removed. Otherwise if you keep them and they exist in the gem version, they will be overrided. \nHere's what's in the theme gem, if you have any of these files/folders in /assets, remove them.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/assets. They're not mentioned because _pages, _posts, and any collections you've created are all content. The theme gem is layout and style only. You don't have to do anything with them, unless you're migrating from a really old version of the theme and the layout changed.\nIf that's the case you'll want to consult the content sections of the docs.\n\nWorking with Posts\nWorking with Pages\nWorking with Collections. Not sure I don't use GitLab. Maybe your paths weren't https and the browser wasn't loading something because it thought it was insecure. \n\nYou can verify that by opening your browser's web development tools and checking the console for errors.. These are just samples for testing purposes. You can name them whatever you want.. These sample pages will never be updated as a part of the core theme files. They aren't bundled in the gem and they only live under /docswhich I use to build the demo site. \nThey're in the repo only as an example and not meant to be used as is. . You shouldn't be syncing with any of the files under /docs or /test. They aren't theme files.. For reference. They're linked and mentioned as examples, meant for you to copy, adjust, and learn from. \nA theme is the layout and style, these are pages.... which is content.. Is this an improvement over what was done in #824? I'm not familiar with the language to know which reads better. There have been several PR's for this same change and just trying to figure out if this is just a \"preference\" or if one version is grammatically better.. Trying to avoid accepting PR's were people keep changing the string to read how they think it should, which seems to be the case with all of the previous PR's.. It should have been merged intomaster. Will have to investigate why it wasn't. \nIf you had time there are a few text strings that are in need of translating if you wanted to submit a PR.. Excellent. Thanks for this!. Thanks for the PR.. Yes, you setup your index.html with a permalink. As per the Jekyll documentation for pagination, you shouldn't do that.\n\nJust remove permalink: / from index.html and everything should work. I just did that with a fork of your repo and the homepage displays as expected.\n\n. Happy to look at a PR if you want to take a stab at fixing this.. Nevermind... just saw your PR :smile:. The reason this doesn't work for you is related to the headers from the server hosting that SVG. See this thread on Stackoverflow for context.\nThe reason that Markdown above works on GitHub is they're doing some \"magic\" to serve up the zenodo.org SVG from one of their servers. If you inspect the rendered <img> element above you'll see the source changed to one that GitHub controls and can properly serve the correct headers.\nhtml\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c90e4afcfa9d468ee4dda636d82ede8883b90b16/68747470733a2f2f7a656e6f646f2e6f72672f62616467652f444f492f31302e353238312f7a656e6f646f2e313030333135302e737667\" alt=\"\" data-canonical-src=\"https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1003150.svg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\">\nClosing as this has nothing to do with the theme.. Moving the \"On this page\" table of contents is really tricky. What makes it complicated is it has to reside inside the content container because it's created by Kramdown when it parses the content.\nI'm using some CSS trickery (eg. negative margins) to pull it outside of that container and into the space on the right (padding). This works because there is no other content there. I can't think of any way to move it to the left and not interfere with the author sidebar.\nIdeally you'd just place that content inside of the sidebar container, but that's not possible if you're using Kramdown's automatic TOC feature. Your options are to use the custom sidebar nav and manually specify the links, or use some sort of Javascript based solution to create a table of contents similar to how Kramdown does it.\nAnd yes, if you remove the right padding on .page and strip out make the width 100% (remove the calc stuff), it'll fill the remaining space instead of centering.\nSearch through the closed issues as I've covered a lot of this numerous times before and you'll likely find a more detailed explanation.. It's currently been designed to have the main content centered on the page regardless if there are sidebars on the left or right. Changing that would alter the overall design of the theme so it's not something I'm going to do, but there's nothing stopping you from turning the theme into something custom to meet your needs.\nI ripped out much of the Susy SCSS from the layout so that could be why you're not seeing it. For the most part I'm simply floating containers and using calc to pad out space for the sidebar instead of Susy mixins.\nIf you want to push the Kramdown TOC to the left instead just make sure you don't have an author sidebar on the page. Then reverse much of the logic that pads the right to pad the left, then float the .toc to the left instead.. My bad. Meant you'll have to float: left .page__content. There's probably a bunch more tweaks, you essentially reverse paddings, positioning, margins etc.\nsidebar__right for instance will need the negative margin on the left instead of the right, and will need to be absolutely positioned to left: 0 instead of right: 0.. The menu currently follows the \"priority plus\" pattern and isn't something I'm interested in supporting.\nIf you want a navigation bar similar to Bootstrap's you'll need to use a Bootstrap theme or customize the theme. Here's some Jekyll resources to get you started if you want to build your own.\n\nhttps://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/12/creating-dynamic-menus-in-jekyll/\nhttp://planetjekyll.github.io/snippets/nav-with-data.html\nhttps://github.com/forestryio/jekyll-menus\nhttps://gist.github.com/kasperisager/9416313. If I had to guess that regex is part of the Smooth Scroll jQuery plugin. There's probably a reason for it and appears there are ways to enable the hashes so they appear in history and are focusable.\n\nhttps://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-smooth-scroll. @vortexing You'll need to override the theme's /assets/js/main.min.js file by copying it into the same location in your repo. Then make the JavaScript changes above.\nIt would probably be a smart idea to copy the entire /assets/js folder of files to your repo, make changes in the specific JS file and then use npm run build:js to generate the minified main.min.js file.\nConsult the JavaScript docs for more info on that process. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/javascript/. @edemaine Not sure I follow. jQuery Smooth Scroll is included in the theme. Its an out of the box install, which doesn't enable the hashes for whatever reason.\nYou can check out #1767 which tried to address that, but it had its limitations and breaks other things which is why it hasn't been merged.. @kswedberg See https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/1786 for the outstanding issues. If you have a fix feel free to submit a PR and I\u2019ll review.. I'm with you that responsive images are an important optimisation to make. I do this with my own site.\nJust not convinced the added complexity is worth it for the theme since there is really no good way to do it without a plugin or extra tooling. YAML variables go down the path of extra maintenance for the user to.\nI'm really into Gatsby a newish static site generator that uses React. It has some really nice transformer plugins that take care of writing img elements with the appropriate srcset markup and generating sized images with Sharp.\nIt's smart enough to do this for all images in your Markdown content which is the holy Grail as far as I'm concerned. Something I haven't seen done with Jekyll yet. Unless you count custom Liquid tags which isn't all that elegant and pollutes the source content making it less portable.. I'm probably starting to sound like a broken record with all these requests, but I'm trying to balance a lot of things. Every new feature or enhancement has a cost, and this one is fairly high in my book.\nSure adding some extra YAML variables seems like the lowest cost of the bunch as it can be opt'd in. But doing so introduces a mess of Liquid spaghetti code for something I really don't think many people will go to the trouble of using.\nNot to mention it'll be a messy solution as srcset is used for img elements. You're asking for support to the \"overlay image\" which doesn't use an img element at all. The images are added via inline CSS which uses a completely different syntax for supporting \"background\" responsive images.\nAnd once it is advertised that the theme can support \"responsive\" header images, the expectation would be to do that elsewhere... and rightfully so.\nI'd be up for supporting responsive images that were triggered via a Jekyll plugin that did all the heavy lifting as far as image generation and possibly markup are concerned. The issue there is I've used all of the available solutions and they all kind of stink and have drawbacks in their own way.\nI've done a lot of research and experimenting with responsive images on Jekyll powered sites over the years, and it's a shit show. Nothing comes close to what Gatsby is doing with its modern toolset and I'm not one for adding half-baked features into my projects.\nThis is another one of those features that Wordpress has spoiled people as you can pretty much set it and forget... something that just isn't the case with Jekyll. I think that's were the friction I'm facing comes from with the theme. Features like this are more of a framework slash infrastructure thing versus something at the theme level. Jekyll has the hooks to do it, but the plugins aren't really there to support it. And I know zero about Ruby to help in that regard.. You could also use a service like Cloudinary (they have a free tier) to serve up responsive images. Without modifying the theme you could load their Javascript, point it at the feature image class and it'll automatically generate responsive images.. Thanks for the PR!. Simple and concise is fine. Since the data file is editable my intention is just to provide a starting point and if someone wants to tailor the text to suit their needs they can.. I'd be up for rolling in support for the superior jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin if/when it gets allowed on GitHub Pages. Same for its autopages feature.\nI use both on my personal site, but not sure if there is a way to do them now and give the user a choice of falling back to the whitelisted gems. I sort of do that with Jekyll Archives support, but it's kind of messy and makes configuring confusing, especially for those not familiar with Jekyll.. @johnlane I use jekyll-paginate-v2 on my own site but that's a completely different theme from Minimal Mistakes. So the config settings is likely not 1:1. I'm also using the plugin's Autopage feature to generate tag archives.. Looks like you don't have the latest version of the theme files. I didn't dig through your entire repo but I can tell it's not current because you're missing the Staticman v2 include.\nThere's a lot of other changes that were made to support v2 that you're likely missing. See these commits for further context:\n5ed73b3f1618164b189b8faceb7ee6a2d67d293f, 7fed4e8eb7441dfbd4f07d8f5533692fd7e0fd02, 6030450ac1e40b04e0a95c293c6f1db2fe9eb7ce, ac929052ddb7dc0cc4d5fddebd4d02992b572bae, ab09e1bb43703dc2f100edf1c69789f02d92a7f8, fce0c55f2b1a4d6e3b1d9dfac798f649b308ee08, 8974732330c3ae43600b59ec8e54939559f59f68, 9af1e8d548d4e870cf07c1e6cb430bec5d3d2ae0. This isn't a Jekyll issue so the stack trace isn't going to tell you much. You likely have something misconfigured in _config.yml or staticman.yml.\nQuickly scanning your staticman.yml file I see you have reCAPTCHA enabled, but not seeing it on your form. That's likely misconfigured and could be causing the form to not validate. It's possible you missed some updated _includes as well so make sure everything is the same as MM's master branch.\nMaybe try disabling reCaptcha?\nreCaptcha:\n    enabled: false. You've properly setup Staticman right, made it a collaborator, accepted its invitation, etc.? Looks like an issue between your configs and it. If you open your browsers web developer tools and look at the console tab it will give you more info.\n\n. That error is because you have some bad CSS in the various .scss files found in your _sass folder.\nWhen you merged in the master branch you likely didn't deal with merge conflicts properly and it's leaving in things like <<<<<<< HEAD and ======== throughout your CSS, which isn't valid.\nIf you're not customizing any of the files in _sass I would suggest you just delete the entire folder and copy them fresh from the MM repo. Or go line by line and remove Git merge comments in them.. So that I understand the feature request correctly...\nLet's say you have image-a.jpg used as the page's header image (overlay, splash, whatever). You want to be able to override that just for Facebook and use something like image-b.jpg so that the cropping is better when shared on FB?\nIs that correct? If so that's pretty much what #943 requested. I'm not really interested in making changes to the SEO.html include as I plan on dropping it and falling back to jekyll-seo-tag instead.\nMuch of those other issues are related to not having a header image defined for the page... which is used for og:image. When that happens Facebook takes whatever image it feels like when it scrapes the page. There's all sorts of rules they follow which are also related to how it crops images.. The Jekyll SEO Tag Plugin is pretty nice. The only reason I haven't switched over to it yet are due to some breaking changes. It isn't that big of a deal, but it would require changing some YAML Front Matter in your posts as it looks for page.image or page.image.path, and my theme is using something completely different.\nI haven't looked at seo.html in some time, looks like there's opportunity to dry up the code. Specifically around page.image and this mess that's not DRY at all. \n```html\n  {% if page.header.image %}\n    \n\n  {% else %}\n    \n    {% if page.header.teaser %}\n      \n    {% elsif site.og_image %}\n      \n    {% endif %}\n  {% endif %}\n{% if page.header.image %}\n  \n{% elsif page.header.overlay_image %}\n  \n{% elsif page.header.teaser %}\n  \n{% elsif site.og_image %}\n  \n{% endif %}\n```\nI think I can do some smart things there, which could make the feature you're requesting trivial and easy to add.. This feature has been added to /_includes/seo.html on the master branch.\nHow this works is if you set a header or overlay image for a page those are used by default for OG or Twitter Cards. You can override those by setting og_image like so:\nyaml\nheader:\n  image: /assets/images/your-page-image.jpg\n  og_image: /assets/images/your-og-image.jpg. The mixed content warning is due to you loading assets over http instead of https. If you open your browser's web development tools and look at the console it'll tell you exactly what the issue is.\n\nLooks to me that the header/overlay image on your homepage has the following path http://andrewkusumo.science/assets/images/header.jpg when it should be https://andrewkusumo.science/assets/images/header.jpg.\nSince you didn't provide a repo to look at I have no idea what your YAML Front Matter is for that page. Verify it is a relative path and not starting with http://. Also make sure you've set your site url in _config.yml to https://andrewkusumo.science and not left it blank or using http://.. Can you give some detail on why this fix is needed? Google+ URLs with the + in them still exist and are valid. Example: https://plus.google.com/+MichaelRoseDesign.. That makes sense then. I believe the + is for those who have set a vanity URL.. I've accepted the PR and will merge it in when I get a chance.\nIt's probably better to omit the + as you have to allow anyone with a profile to use it.. Can you give some examples or documentation on why this URL changed? I don't want to merge it in if there's a possibility people usinghttps://steamcommunity.com/id/ would now have broken links on their site because of id ~> profiles.. Have a search through the closed issues for things like \"grid\", \"layout\", \"wide\", etc.\nI've covered this numerous times before with detailed directions on the Sass you need to modify to widen the main content container.. Related: #1265, #1155, #1298, #623, #384, #74. The problem likely is you're trying to load inline CSS with the <script> tag instead of <style>.\nTry this instead:\nhtml\n<!-- UItoTop (go to top) plugin -->\n<style>\n<!-- your custom CSS -->\n</style>\nAnd not:\nhtml\n<script type=\"text/css\">\n<!-- your custom CSS -->\n</script>. What's not clear to me is are you using the gem version of the theme or a forked version? If the gem version you have to override _layouts/default.html with a local version to set layout: compress.\nDo you have a public repo? I stopped supporting the compress layout as it can cause issues and has a few caveats that can break builds if you don't conform to its limitations.\nCurious, have you tried using some of the Jekyll plugins that minify HTML or something like Gulp/Grunt to do it for you? Since you're not hosting with GitHub Pages you're not limited to the inferior layout: compress Liquid method of minifying.. Thanks.. You could probably hack up something using the feature row helper for the larger \"featured\" post and then the grid view for below.\nOther than that you might want to look for a theme that does this layout specifically. I know I've seen quite a few Ghost theme ports for Jekyll.. I think this might fall in the customization bucket. I'm not sure if this could be done \"clean\" so that it is easy to turn off/on for those who don't want it.\nWhat makes it complicated as not everyone who'd want the author avatar and name to link back somewhere, will want it to go to the site's root. In the cases where blogs support multiple authors this would be problematic.\nThis is why I've included the website uri key for the author sidebar, to provide a way to link back to the author's site.. Looks good. A PR with this as a skin would be great.. Everything looks good to me. No worries up updating the README. I have some ideas for another skin or two that I wanted to add, so I'll take care of it when I do that.\nThanks again for the PR.. I think something else is at play. From the looks of it you don't have all of the latest layouts, includes, and CSS.\nIf you take a look at the demo site you should see something like this at the top of your HTML source:\nhtml\n<!--\n  Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.7.0 by Michael Rose\n  Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com \\| @mmistakes\n  Free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license\n  https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n-->\nand this in your CSS:\ncss\n/*!\n * Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.7.0 by Michael Rose\n * Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n * Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n*/\nWhen I check yours there's no version in the HTML and your CSS has:\ncss\n/*!\n * Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.5.2 by Michael Rose\n * Copyright 2017 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n * Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/mmistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n*//\nI made some layout adjustments to the right sidebar a few versions ago and doesn't look like your fork incorporates those. You can see in this sample post on the demo site the TOC sidebar doesn't overlap code blocks.\nOn yours it's also overlapping notice blocks, which tells me it's using the older layout and CSS. This was one of the issues I fixed.\nIf you haven't made any changes to the theme's core files I'd suggest remove them from your fork, and pulling in the latest _layouts, _includes, _sass, etc. Just to verify if it's your content or theme. I have seen jekyll-toc do some weird things, but that has more to do with extra headings showing up than any sort of overlap with main content.. Haven't tested it but should work the same way you'd normally use them, set the skin you want in _config.yml.\nminimal_mistakes_skin: \"default\" # \"air\", \"aqua\", \"contrast\", \"dark\", \"dirt\", \"neon\", \"mint\", \"plum\", \"sunrise\". Tested. Adding minimal_mistakes_skin and the variation you want to your _config.yml works as it should.. @vg It works, I just switched my demo site to dark. The reason it's not working for you is you didn't update the url in the _config.yml file. You still have it pointing to my repo's CSS.\nYou'll notice if you fire up your test repo it'll go from the default skin to dark because it's using the CSS from my test repo, not yours. Change this line to url: https://vg.github.io and it'll work.. @LongQi You still need to commit the _data/ui-text.yml file. The test theme repo I built didn't include those so it just defaults back to English.. @ldt116 Docs were updated last week. See GitHub Pages compatible method in the Quick Start instructions.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/\nFor migration follow the guidelines under \"Setup Your Site.\" You can ignore the Gemfile specific stuff as that only applies to the Ruby gem version.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#migrating-to-gem-version. What's the extension of the source page? If it's a Markdown extension then that explains why you're getting a <p></p> element wrapped around the body content.\nI'd try renaming it to .html instead to keep the page from going through the Markdown parser when Jekyll builds it.\nIf that doesn't work I'd suggest asking for help on the Jekyll Talk forum or Stackoverflow. This issue has nothing to do with the theme and is more of a \"how do I do X with Jekyll\". Somewhere there may have a solution.. I don't know that this is something 80% of the theme's users would need. In fact I can't recall ever seeing a blog post that listed multiple authors, which tells me it's a fairly niche request.\nThe best route is for you to customize the author profile as you've done above. But I don't think this is something I'd be interested in incorporating into the theme's core, especially due to the Liquid for loop and possible performance implications that would have.. Very nice. I'll add a link to your tool in my theme docs under the Staticman section. . No there isn't that I know of. All I'm doing is using a Liquid filter that counts the amount of words in {{ content }} which is then divided to approximate words per minute.\nYou'd likely need some sort of Jekyll plugin to exclude content from that.. If the filter is GitHub Pages compatible, flexible, and doesn't add overhead or complexity to the read-time.html include then sure, feel free to submit a PR.. Sorry, I really have no idea. I don't think this is an easy problem to solve. There's likely some sort of Jekyll plugin you'll need to write, but that won't work for GitHub Pages sites.\nOnly other thing I can think of is some crazy Liquid code to strip out content, but that seems extremely fragile and prone to breakage.. Yeah, think this is safe to remove as a feature.. That bit of documentation was likely written before there was a Ruby gem version.\nBest practice when writing Sass is to break up your styles into components, utility classes, mixins, functions, variables, etc. That is the point of view I was taking when I built the themes and documented how and where to update the social icon classes.\nSo it depends. If you're a repo forker, editing _utilities.scss is the way to go. If you're Ruby gem installer, then dropping in your styles wherever it makes sense to augment the styles is best. The docs could be probably updated to mention both approaches, but that might further complicate things and be too prescriptive.. Note to self: links to _variables.scss and _utitlities.scss are broken and need updating to new paths under /_sass/minimal-mistakes.\nFixed in 423ba0a18f08722b640e06f82f13d6a42777c374. Yes.

Thanks @nickgarlis . See #735 \nYou need to add the Latex script.. Thanks @LouisMT . What's the experience like on mobile? I see you have hardcoded widths in there at 500px. Will that force the main container to push out and mess up the layout?. Thanks.... looks good!. @maaz93 This sounds like a good idea to me if you want to go ahead and submit a PR. Maybe do them as two separate PRs... one for disabling Google Analytics in nonprod and another for disabling comments.\nYou can probably piggyback on these lines\n_includes/analytics.html\n{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' and site.analytics.provider and page.analytics != false %}\n_layouts/single.html\n{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' and site.comments.provider and page.comments %}. You can reference this same issue. . Thanks @maaz93 for both of these PRs.. Good catch, thanks!. To avoid having to set search: true in every document (or as a front matter default), what if the default behavior is everything is included in the search index unless it has search: false?\nThen you can do this instead:\n{% unless doc.search == false %}\n...\n{% endunless %}. Yup, your front matter is wrong. You need to set the correct layout.\nInstead of layout: post change them to layout: single.\nIf you don't want to add layout: single to every post you can also use Jekyll's front matter default feature and set it in your _config.yml to apply to all posts.. What are you hoping the accomplish? Do you have an example of a list you want to change? The entire theme's styling is done through CSS. \nIf I have a better idea of what you're wanting to change I can maybe point you to where in _sass you'd need to modify.. Got it. Those links are aligned using flexbox. You can align them to the \"start\" (or the left in this case) by removing the following two lines from .visible-links in _sass/minimal-mistakes/_navigation.scss.\ndiff\n    .visible-links {\n-      -webkit-box-pack: end;\n-       justify-content: flex-end;\n        ...\nOr you can override them with instead:\ndiff\n    .visible-links {\n+      -webkit-box-pack: start;\n+       justify-content: flex-start;\n        .... Have a search through the closed issues, I've covered this one a few times before.\nYou need to alter the CSS some. If you look through _sass/_page.scss you'll see I'm applying some negative margins on the right. That's \"faking\" some space to make sure an optional right sidebar fits. If you want the main content to expand into that space, removing the margins will do it.\nscss\n.page {\n  width: calc(100% - #{$right-sidebar-width-narrow});\n}. See https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1265. I don't speak any of these languages so I'll just have to take your word for it. Care to submit a pull request with the fix?. Sounds good to me. Maybe to keep things simple just add title. The tooltip override seems unnecessary as I'm thinking most will just use title for the tooltip text anyways.. Not sure how much value they'd add elsewhere. My feeling is most of the links are already descriptive of what they are. I want to avoid overcomplicating configuration and the templates.. Shouldn't this be something more like?\nhtml\n<li class=\"masthead__menu-item\">\n  <a href=\"{{ domain }}{{ link.url }}\" {% if link.description %}title=\"{{ link.description }}\"{% endif %}>{{ link.title }}</a>\n</li>\nWhat you have is somewhat redundant and doesn't really produce HTML that would give the link more context since you're just duping link.title for the anchor name and title attribute`.\nFor example say you have this:\nyaml\nmain:\n  - title: \"My Masthead Link\"\n    url: http://whatever.com\nYou're going to get this...\nhtml\n<li class=\"masthead__menu-item\" title=\"My Masthead Link\">\n  <a href=\"http://whatever.com\">My Masthead Link</a>\n</li>\nWhich is kind of pointless since it doesn't add any additional context to the link.\nhttps://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-use-link-title-attribute-correctly/\nIf you use my code:\nyaml\nmain:\n  - title: \"My Masthead Link\"\n    description: \"An awesome website about whatever\"\n    url: http://whatever.com\nYou'd get this:\nhtml\n<li class=\"masthead__menu-item\">\n  <a href=\"http://whatever.com\" title=\"An awesome website about whatever\">My Masthead Link</a>\n</li>\nWhich I think is better for the user.. I was referring to how you were setting a default value for title. That is unnecessary as title is already the link name. \ndescription seems more semantic to me. The hover effect isn't really a \"tooltip\", just something browser's do. Not to mention it means nothing for mobile users since you can hover a link.. Looks good, thanks @maaz93.. Not easily no. Closing as this is a duplicate of #1174 \nFeel free to reopen that issue and/or add comments to it. The sticky author sidebar can flake out sometimes so I'm hesitant to add the same feature to the right sidebar.\nMay also impact #1220 . Usefulness is probably relative to the user :wink:\nA great deal of people don't use the TOC feature. And the author sidebar sticking has been around for a long time, so I'd hate to change expected behaviors like that.. @ohadschn Thought you'd might enjoy this early holiday :gift:. I think it's safe to bump to 3.6, same as the GitHub Page gem.. This looks pretty clean to me so I'm good with merging in with some minor adjustments.\nLeft a note above about the author__avatar class that was inconsistently applied to the bio image. I think I left that in by mistake, but it's not needed anymore.\nThe only thing giving me pause is the naming of linkback. Not sure if there is something better that is more clear or semantic. So if anyone has other suggestions I'm all ears. If nothing better comes in then link_back would follow the style of other site variables.\nAnd yes, feel free to add this to the Configuration docs and a line in _config.yml similar to the others.. home sounds good to me. Thanks for making the change.. I'm torn with this one. I like the ability to add another \"hook\" for dropping in custom HTML/code into the template. But since you easily modify the original social-sharing.html include, there's not much benefit.\nMaybe another approach would be to pull social-share-custom-links.html out of social-share.html and place it directly below it, as social-share-custom.html. This way if someone wants to replace the default sharing links with something else (native sharing buttons for example) they could.\nThe way you have it now that wouldn't happen, since they'd still get the default share links... then anything custom after. Instead of completely replacing them. Plus they're wrapped in the page.share conditional to, which couldn't be altered.. I like the idea of using YAML data to generate the social links, but I haven't found a performant way of doing it.\nTo make it extensible you'd have to loop over the object of links (similar to the masthead links), and that starts to slow builds down... especially on large sites with tons of posts. This would be great for the sidebar author links too since I wouldn't have to maintain the Liquid spaghetti of if/elses.\nAnd yeah I think this is going down the path of over complicating the theme so I'll go ahead and close it. The include for social links is almost never touched, so it's fairly safe for users to override/customize. \nThanks for taking the time to discuss this and work on some solutions.. Looks good. Thanks @fantasticfears . It's all in the documentation.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#skin. Hack the post pagination include to be reversed.\nOr change the next/previous text to be the opposite in _data/ui-text.yml.\nyaml\npagination_previous: \"Next\"\npagination_next: \"Previous\"\nJust note that either of these changes will be applied globally. If you want to be more surgical with it you may need to make your own layout to apply selectively.. This is just a warning. GitHub Pages doesn't support 3rd party theme gems using the theme property in _config.yml. It only supports the remote_theme property.\nRemove the following line and the error will go away:\nyaml\ntheme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll\nClosing as this is a duplicate of #1366, #951 . When the upgrade happens it'll be available everywhere in the theme.. Two things.\n\nAre you absolutely sure you have created a Disqus account, configured it at disqus.com and have the correct shortname in _config.yml?\nIf you're running the site locally Jekyll defaults into DEVELOPMENT mode which disables comments and analytics as to not pollute them with non-prod data. You need to set your Jekyll environment to production to force comments. See Jekyll's docs on how to do that (eg. JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll serve).. Great. Glad you got it working.\n\nThis was a recent change in the last version (previously comments and analytics scripts) were always included). In the configuration documentation under comments there's a note about it.\n\nNote: Comments are disabled by default in development. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to set JEKYLL_ENV=production to force the environment to production.. Not sure, this looks like an issue on your end.. The simple/obvious ones are always the ones overlooked :wink:. You have your posts folder wrong. Jekyll expects _posts not _post\n\nYour site url is wrong too. Remove the / at the end.. Level 1 headers are typically used for post titles. I'd suggest in your actual posts starting at level 2.\nSemantically and SEO wise it's better too as you should only ever have one h1 (level 1 heading) on a page. \n. By editing _includes/masthead.html\nJust by replacing the {{ site.title }} text with an image it works pretty well.\nhtml\n<div class=\"masthead\">\n  <div class=\"masthead__inner-wrap\">\n    <div class=\"masthead__menu\">\n      <nav id=\"site-nav\" class=\"greedy-nav\">\n        <a class=\"site-title\" href=\"{{ '/' | absolute_url }}\"><img src=\"your-masthead-image.jpg\"></a>\n       ...\nWhich looks something like this:\n\n. The image path is incorrect, that's why it's broken. You can verify this by opening your web browser's development tools. \nMore than likely the console will tell you it can't find the image asset. Make sure the path is correct. You'll probably want to use Jekyll's relative_url filter on the image as well.\nLook at the various includes and layouts in the theme to see how I've handled asset paths.. seo_title adds in extraneous stuff that isn't needed for sharing. Page title (or the site title in the case of the homepage) looks much nicer when sharing.\nHomepage:\n\nOther pages:\n\nUsing seo_title gives you the full title that appends the separator (eg. -) and then the site title. If used for og:title would give things like Quick-Start Guide - Minimal Mistakes, which is good for the <title> element and SEO purposes, but for social sharing is unnecessary.. I don't thing this is a bug. Sounds to me you might have forked the theme and didn't finish following all of the directions in the docs.\nThe Gemfile in the root of this repo is used to build a Ruby gem, it is incomplete and missing gems for building a Jekyll site. This is where these instructions come into play. Depending on if you're hosting on GitHub Pages or elsewhere they vary, but essentially you create (or update an existing Gemfile) with gem \"jekyll\" or gem \"github-pages\".\nYou want it to look something like this and not like this. Remove the gemspec line and then add the appropriate gems depending on your installation needs.\n. Currently only supports posts and collections. You'd have to alter the code to index pages as well.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/assets/js/lunr-en.js. Looks like the version of Lunr.js included (0.5.12) with the theme is super old. It's currently at 2.1.5 so perhaps this issue has been fixed.\n@nickgarlis Any particular reason you used an older version of Lunr? I did a quick test by updating to the current version and I get Uncaught TypeError: idx.add is not a function, so guessing the API changed slightly. Wondering if we can update since with any sort of functionality/performance gains. Thoughts?\n. Lunr upgrade info https://lunrjs.com/guides/upgrading.html. Sounds good @nickgarlis \ud83d\ude00. @Aaronius The Lunr index currently loops through collections documents (... posts). Here's the relevant code. To add pages to the mix you'd have to loop through site.pages as well.\nFor a better search experience I'd suggest using Algolia instead.\nAnd if you need an example of how to set it up check out this repo.. Thanks!. That's correct, email is currently hardcoded as required. I went with that as a sensible default. Since _includes/comments.html has no clue what you set as required in the Staticman config file there's no way to make it toggleable.\nIf you don't want the required text to appear you'll need to override that include by removing <small class=\"required\">*</small>.. The url isn't the source file paths. Put in what the rendered path is. \nEg /filename/ or /filename/index.html. No I mean the page's url not the site.\nIn the case of this page you'd set url: /one/, same as the permalink.\nIf you need more examples as to how it works check out the demo site's main navigation. https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_data/navigation.yml. Closing as this has nothing to do with the theme. Please file an issue upstream with jekyll/jekyll if you're having trouble with their commands.. You're missing either build or serve that's why you're getting an error.\nYou're essentially just running jekyll without telling it to build your site or spin up a development server.\nTry bundle exec jekyll build --trace --verbose instead.. Not sure I follow what you mean by multiple language support @nickgarlis. Could you expand on it some?. Ah ok. Yeah I dunno. If it can be done in a way to not over complicate setup. In my experience it can be tricky handling multiple languages with a theme because Jekyll core isn\u2019t really all that friendly to it.\nLast thing I want to do is open a can of worms that can\u2019t be supported well.. @nickgarlis Possible solution would be leverage site.locale set in _config.yml. This could be used to determine what language .js to load. Since locale can be language and locale (eg. en-US) doing something like this would normalize it to just the language.\n{% assign lang = site.locale | slice: 0,2 | default: \"en\" %}\nThen you could load the appropriate .js and if one doesn't exist for the given locale default to English.\nhtml\n<script src=\"{{ '/assets/js/lunr-{{ lang }}.js' | absolute_url }}\"></script>. @pixelastic It's on my todo list. I just need to lay the ground work for it in the theme.. Has a pull-request #1531. @user414 Open a new issue so it can be tracked, if and when I get around to it.. See issue https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1301\nThere isn\u2019t an easy way of doing this without heavily customizing the theme and its CSS.. Thanks!. Use layout: splash\nHere is the source for MM splash page if you need to see how it's built.\n. Yeah that should work.. The problem is you are overriding _includes/scripts.html. Your version of scripts.html is missing the main JavaScript file needed for most of the theme (sticky footer, collapsible menu, etc.).\nWhat you'll want to do is duplicate scripts.html bundled in the theme and then add your MathJax script to that.\nAnother option is to use the custom footer include to drop in your MathJax code. This appears before scripts.html so there's a possibility of a script conflict if you're trying to do some jQuery. But if you're just adding a conditional to load a CDN'd version of MathJax you should be fine.. No way to do this via a config or setting. You\u2019ll need to modify includes to reposition or add the date in different locations.\nThe home layout loops over the following include, so you\u2019ll need to drop in the date Liquid/HTML there.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/archive-single.html\n. Think this sort of thing is best left as an override. Not really comfortable adding in more config togggles for placement of the date. It opens up a whole can of worms I\u2019m not interested in supporting.. It's a balancing act. Some things make sense to configure, while others stray from the aesthetic and goal of the theme.\nSame thing happened to me years ago when I used someone else's theme. Eventually I outgrew it and wanted to take it in a different direction, where forking and/or building my own thing was a better solution.. So to clarify you're looking for a way to disable excerpts when using an image overlay? And not a way to specify different text for overlay excerpt and archive excerpts?\nThe later is a complexity I'm not sold on. But using a boolean to disable overlay excerpts seems simple enough.. Happy to accept a PR if you wanted to make the this minor and easy change to the docs.. Yeah ignore that GH branch, it\u2019s just there for archiving purposes.  All PRs should be based off master. All documentation files are under /docs.. My only issue with this is the user has to explicitly set it as true to get the old behavior. So anyone who upgrades and doesn\u2019t read the changelog will have no idea why their excerpts are gone.\nCan this be done in a way were excerpts are shown always unless set to false? Perhaps this would work:\nliquid\n{% if page.header.show_overlay_excerpt != false and page.excerpt %}. Default values work in the way you have them, but the config isn\u2019t part of the theme. Users will need to add those values to their config file, and in my experience most will have no clue that is something they need to do.\nDoing it the way I suggested makes the upgrade process easier. Existing users keep the excerpts without breaking current functionality, and if they want to disable them they can add false globally to their config or page specific in their YAML front matter.. This looks good @dvhart! Thanks for making the changes and pushing this through.. Instead of using Jekyll's highlight tag have you tried using GFM triple backticks and enabling line numbers for Kramdowm/Rouge in your _config.yml.\nThe CSS might be tricky to get sorted as the HTML markup for Jekyll's highlight tag and what Kramdown spits out is different. It's also a bit of a moving target as they've changed it a few times recently.\nAdding the following to the kramdown key in your _config.yml will enable line numbering.\nyaml\nkramdown:\n  syntax_highlighter_opts:\n    block:\n      line_numbers: true\nWhich ends up looking something like this:\n\nref: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4619#issuecomment-354445278. I pushed a small update to _sass/minimal-mistakes/syntax.scss that should fix this issue.\nDuring my tests I had code blocks with long line widths, which didn't show the issue. Your example was a good test because it's fairly narrow. As far as I could tell that was causing the .gutter column to stretch to fill in the extra space.\nI added some widths using ems just to be more responsive friend vs. pixels.\n\n. Please provide a link to a public repo with the issue.\nThe way the comments are brought in is when a comment is approved Staticman creates data files under _data/comments in a folder that matches the post's slug. I'll need to verify what it's creating and what your post slug is. If they don't match... no comments on the page.\nFor example your Hello World post work's because the comment data file folder is /_data/comments/Hello-World and the post's slug is Hello-World.. The the post slug might need to be escaped in the Staticman form code as the url looks to be that way. That's why the comment isn't showing up, one has the Chinese characters, the other is using the escaped HTML.\nI'll have to do some testing.. There might be something else at play. I tried cloning your repo and building it locally and all the Chinese title posts don't work. The characters are messed up and clicking any of the links go to 404 pages.\n\nThe only link that works is the English title... \"Hello World\". There may be a Jekyll setting for this but I'm unfamiliar with it as I only ever write content in English.. That makes sense. In that case not sure if I\u2019m going to be much help at solving this issue.\nHard to tell what\u2019s at fault here:\n\nLiquid code for assigning comment entry file names based on the post\u2019s slug\nLiquid code for pulling in said comments from /_data\nSome sort of encoding issue with Jekyll\nStaticman\n  . Thanks!. Thanks.\n\nWhat would be the purpose of a caption on the feature row? Just to include a byline/credit under the image?. This has been added and will be available in an upcoming release of the theme.\nBy adding image_caption to a feature row item you can caption the image.\nyaml\nfeature_row:\n  - image_path: assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-1-th.jpg\n    image_caption: \"Image courtesy of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\"\n    alt: \"placeholder image 1\"\n    title: \"Placeholder 1\"\n    excerpt: \"This is some sample content that goes here with **Markdown** formatting.\"\nAn example can be seen on this page.. It should work. To be honest I've never tried it on an index page. How much text you have on the index? I seem to recall an issue with only a single paragraph of content causing issues... though I could be making that up.\nYou have a public repo and example so I can see if anything sticks out to me?\nMM is setup with this line in _config.yml to autogenerate an excerpt globally on new paragraphs.\nexcerpt_separator: \"\\n\\n\"\nWhich you can override at the post/page level if you want to use something like:\n```\nexcerpt_separator: more\nExcerpt\nmore\nOut-of-excerpt\n```\nThis shouldn't be theme dependent, and is more a Jekyll thing than something special MM is doing.\nref: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#post-excerpts. One more thing, if your index page is .html I'm not 100% sure the auto-generated excerpt feature of Jekyll works. Pretty sure it has to be a Markdown file.. I added back the GH gem. It is needed when testing locally and will confuse users if omitted.. Ref https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/. I'm likely going to remove the code icon in a future release so it won't be an issue anymore. In my opinion it's pointless decoration that just adds more visual clutter to the page.\nWould be great if there was an easy way to limit to around 80 characters. I don't know of any way to do that without specify some length, which depending on the font size could be completely unreliable.\n  . :man_shrugging:  Not sure, possible that keyword is omitted from the Lunr.js index for some reason.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-search. That's my guess at least. I believe there are \"stop\" words and this is likely one of them. Sure there is a way to override that but I haven't really dug into Lunr's docs too much.\n@nickgarlis, who added the search functionality might know more about it.. The other thing about search is the index being built isn't exhaustive and doesn't contain the entire document's content. If it did the .js file would be pretty big and kill page load performance.\nFor reference this is what the index builds for each document: title, excerpt (limited to 20 words in the body, categories, and tags. So if the keyword doesn't appear in the title, in a category/tag, or in the first 20 words of the content, it's not going to show up in the index. Which is what I believe is going on with \"search\".\njson\ntitle: {{ doc.title | jsonify }},\nexcerpt: {{ doc.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 20 | jsonify }},\ncategories: {{ doc.categories | jsonify }},\ntags: {{ doc.tags | jsonify }},\n  . @jaybe-jekyll No it's not that sophisticated. It's simplify taking {{ content }}, which is everything you put in the body of your Markdown file (below the YAML front matter), strips it of all HTML, then truncates it to 20 words.\nDepending on how you're using the theme you could create a duplicate of /assets/js/lunr-en.js and put it in your repo. Then modify this line excerpt: {{ doc.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 20 | jsonify }} to include more words. If your site isn't that large that's probably safe.. @nickgarlis Using the content in /test I get a lunr-en.js 46 kB file with truncatewords: 20. Removing the truncate it jumps up to 181 kB.\nSo I think we need to be careful here. I haven't run it through the /docs files, but those are pretty big and include way more posts. I could see the Lunr index quickly approaching a 1 mb. Which is a lot of extra JavaScript load to put on the pages.\nAnd I know there are some users who have hundreds if not thousands of posts. That search index would be mammoth.\nI'm fine with providing a basic search experience with Lunr. Then with #1416 start adding other search providers. Algolia is really nice and offloads these potentially large indexes. The tradeoff is you have to jump through some hoops to make it GitHub Pages compatible since it requires a plugin to push up the index, not to mention their free tier caps out at 10k records.\n  . @nickgarlis So here's a question. I've been looking at some other implimentations of Lunr.js with Jekyll and came across this one from CloudCannon.\nThey have things setup slightly different, but I did notice that they aren't using Liquid to spit out JSON for both this.add and var store like you have. Which appears to bloat the .js file since it's spitting out a title, excerpt, category array, tag array, and id twice for every document.\nIn CC example they only do that for store and pull lunr data from there.\nSeems like this would help cut down the size of the index and open it up for increasing the amount of words captured from {{ content }}. They also throw a strip_newlines filter on {{ content }} which may or may not help shrink things down.\nWhat are your thoughts?\n  . Here's an example from my test lunr-en.js\nFirst this.add item\nthis.add({\n          title: \"Lhasa Apso\",\n          excerpt: \"The Lhasa Apso (/\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0s\u0259 \u02c8\u00e6pso\u028a/ lah-s\u0259 ap-soh) is a non-sporting dog breed originating in Tibet. It was bred as an...\",\n          categories: [],\n          tags: [],\n          id: 0\n      })\nWhich then appears in store\n```json\n{\n        \"title\": \"Lhasa Apso\",\n        \"url\": \"/test/pets/lhasa-apso/\",\n        \"excerpt\": \"The Lhasa Apso (/\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0s\u0259 \u02c8\u00e6pso\u028a/ lah-s\u0259 ap-soh) is a non-sporting dog breed originating in Tibet. It was bred as an...\",\n        \"teaser\":\n        null\n\n  }\n\n```\nTheir is obviously some different fields, but excerpt is the same and both and likely where the meat of the file bloat is going to come from.. @nickgarlis I'm questioning more of the DRYness of the current solution. The fact that there are 2 for loops generating similar JSON data in the same file seems wasteful to me. Especially since almost half of the JavaScripts filesize could be saved if there was only a single source of JSON data.\nI'm wondering if it can be done with a single for loop with all the post data (title, excerpt, tags, categories, etc.) instead of duplicating most of that twice. If there was a build process attached to this that minified the file and gzip'd maybe some of the duplicated text would be less of an issue. But's not the case right now, unless you use a tool outside of Jekyll to do that after the fact.. Not exactly the same thing but one of my older themes does something similar with a less sophisticated search script. Single JSON file with all the post data, that's queried.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/search/. @nickgarlis I like it, great work!\nYeah think it makes sense to create a separate data store file that lunr-lang.js uses. That way it's clear what each file is doing. Do what you think makes sense. As far as naming it I don't have any special requirements. Maybe keep it prefixed with lunr- so it's clear it goes with the others as there will potentially be other search provider scripts.\nMight even make sense to break up the Lunr stuff into it's own folder in /assets/js/lunr/.. This looks good to me. Question on stemmers. Is it your intention to add ones from that repo you shared before? Or does it make sense to provide some documentation and how to build one, and then others provide PR's or their own as needed?. I'm going to partially roll this one back. If the user sets their locale to one we don't support (which currently is a lot except en and gr) this logic is going to try and load a JavaScript file that doesn't exist. Breaking search.\nhtml\n<script src=\"{{ '/assets/js/lunr-' | append: lang | append: '.js' | absolute_url }}\"></script>\nExample:\nyaml\nlocale: es-ES\nWill produce and fail.\nhtml\n<script src=\"{{ '/assets/js/lunr-es.js' }}\"></script>\nNot sure if there is a clean way of only appending lang for stemmed versions of Lunr that exist in the theme... and falling back to -en if the user has a locale set for one that doesn't.\nMight have to go back to drawing board on this one. How bad is Lunr's search without using any of the language/stemm stuff? Can we get away with just going vanilla?\nThe theme does support overriding the scripts, so in theory we provide a basic English version. And if you're competent enough you build your own language version as you have and load that instead.\nI'm most interested in making the theme as simple as possible. It should be something where you install the theme and that's it. Anything involving complicated configs and other nonsense is out. I've already failed at that in a few places... cough cough archives.. Came up with something by using Liquid's case to control the value of lang. Will just need to add more cases as languages are added. When one doesn't exist it defaults back to en.\nhtml\n{% if site.search == true or page.layout == \"search\" %}\n  {% assign lang = site.locale | slice: 0,2 | default: \"en\" %}\n  {% case lang %}\n  {% when \"gr\" %}\n    {% assign lang = \"gr\" %}\n  {% else %}\n    {% assign lang = \"en\" %}\n  {% endcase %}\n  <script src=\"{{ '/assets/js/lunr.min.js' | absolute_url }}\"></script>\n  <script src=\"{{ '/assets/js/lunr-' | append: lang | append: '.js' | absolute_url }}\"></script>\n{% endif %}. That makes sense. I'm cool simplifying things and leaving out the stemmers.\nSearch is a tricky thing which is why I held off for a long time adding it, knowing there would be a lot of nuance to it and/or users having different needs and expectations with it.\nWhatever we can do to give a good vanilla experience that covers the basics and worry less about edge cases I'm all for that. If someone wants to enhance search and tweak the priorities they can do that by overriding the scripts or using one of the other search providers we'll eventually support.. @nickgarlis I'll need a good rainy day for that :smile:. I tried quickly to test it out with my own personal site, but it's so big it hit their free tier limits so I gave up.. Yeah as you stated probably not in high demand since I don't see many multi-author MM sites.\nIt may also set implications that the theme supports \"author archives\", meaning you can easily pull up a page with all of the author's posts on the site. Something Wordpress and friends do by default.\nIn our case you'd just have a grid of pictures that link to whatever is set as their \"home\" URL. Which doesn't seem as useful to me.. Archives in general are a pain point. You either use a plugin that auto-generates them or suffer through manually creating each since GitHub Pages doesn't support those plugins.\nYou wouldn't believe how many vanilla MM sites I see where the user hasn't notice that category/tag links at the bottom of every post go to broken links. All because they have to manually create those archive pages since the theme can't do it for you. Same thing for breadcrumbs.\nThrowing author archives into that mix will make things even more messy I think. I hope that someday one of the two popular archive generating plugins are whitelisted (jekyll-archives and jekyll-pagination-v2) for use on GitHub Pages.\n  . Looking good. We might have to think about truncating the excerpts size, but looking at the the lunr-store.js for the MM demo site it's not too bad.\nI'm showing around 246 kB for an index with all of the body content. Which isn't great, but not awful since the searches for \"search\" actually produce results now. Guess if someone has a 1,000 post site it might be too big, but otherwise I'm fine with leaving it as is for now.\n  . Doesn't look like you have the latest version of the theme. See the upgrade docs for more info on how to determine that.\nThere have been numerous enhancements and changes related to aligning the main and sidebar columns. You likely have a version much older than all that, which is why you're seeing some inconsistencies. That coupled with you not having the latest HTML and CSS is breaking the layout.\nAlso it might be worth using the remote theme option instead of forking since it's much easier to upgrade. You won't have to ever mess merging in commits from this repo.. Short answer, yes the header was right aligned at some point as were adjusting the column widths of the sidebar/main to accommodate the TOC better.\nI did adjust it several releases ago so you could sift through old commits and see what changed. You could also search through old issues with keywords like \"grid\", \"width\", \"layout\", etc. I've given many detailed answers to others explaining how to go about adjusting the layout via CSS.\nAlso your browser's development tools are your friend. You can inspect elements and view the CSS to tinker with in browser before changing the actual source files.\n. assets/css/main.scss was built for exactly this purpose. It's intentionally minimal as it never changes, making it safe for you to at your own custom declarations of @imports after it loads in the main Sass file and any theme overrides.\nIt is only two lines and extremely safe for updating, as long as you make sure to not blow away your adds.\nscss\n@import \"minimal-mistakes/skins/{{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin | default: 'default' }}\"; // skin\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\"; // main partials\nAlso this file hasn't been modified at all since its introduction. The only change was when I added skins, which wouldn't have broken anything if you didn't catch the update.\n  . No worries.\nI've thought about adding another import after these that pointed to a blank _custom.scss. But that wouldn't really solve much as you'd still have to make sure any changes you made there were applied.\nSince this file is so small already I didn't see much gain breaking it off into its own partial.. Hmm not sure. You shouldn't have to mess with the gemspec file as it is only used by me to build the Ruby gem.\nWhat's your Gemfile look like? If you're using the one in the root of MM don't. It's not for running Jekyll but for me to build the gem.\n  . Double check you followed the docs to create your Gemfile with the appropriate Jekyll or GutHub Pages gems.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/. What version of the theme are you using? Note above says 1.3.3 but I seriously doubt that since that's ancient.\nI've noticed some flickering too every since updating to Font Awesome 5. I'm pretty sure there's some \"flash of unstyled content\" going on while all the scripts load, which is why things appear to jump.. Nope.. More than likely the issue is search related. As noted in the docs if you have a big site the search JSON file that has to load will be big, and that could be impacting things.\nTry disabling global search first by search: false in your _config.yml. :man_shrugging: \nI tried a bunch of things and not really sure what's causing it. Could be something that was always there it's just more noticeable now. Things are going to jump because the JavaScript needs time to load and run as it determines the width of the masthead, then it moves links that don't fit into the dropdown.\nI tried to speed things up and prioritize it so it's not as noticeable, but nothing much matter:\n\nDisabled the Font Awesome 5 script\nPulled out the Greedy nav script out of main.min.js and moved to the head\nDisabled search scripts\n\nIf anyone has another idea or suggestion I'm all ears.. You have 3 options:\n\nOverride the 16 color variables used for syntax highlighting to one of the other included code block themes.\nCome up with your own set of base16 colors and replace them. There are numerous base16 themes out there if you Google around.\nDowngrade the theme to 4.8.1\n  . Yes that is correct. There are some edge-cases that can break the layout and/or look bad if you're not vigilant with your body content. So I choose the option of least resistance and normalize excerpts into plain-text enclosed in a single <p></p>.\n\nFor example on the test site I just removed the strip_html filter and went with something like this: {{ post.excerpt | markdownify | remove: \"<p>\" | remove: \"</p>\" | truncate: 160 }}\nAnd for most of the posts it looks good, then you hit an auto-excerpt generated by Jekyll that is truncated, and it's stripping off the closing </code> tag... which screws up the font for everything after.\n\nIf you create custom excerpts for all your posts you'll be safe. But with the theme I needed to build it in a way that works with a variety of edge-case content.. No not currently, the overlay was designed for a single call to action button. You'll need to hack something together right now.\nI could potentially treat it similar to one of my other themes, where you feed it an array of action buttons, but I'll have to give that some more thought.\nSample code would be something like:\nhtml\n{% if page.header.actions %}\n  <p>\n  {% for action in page.header.actions %}\n    <a href=\"{{ action.url }}\" class=\"btn btn--light-outline btn--large\">{{ action.label }}</a>\n  {% endfor %}\n{% endif %}\nAnd then you'd have some YAML like in the post/page:\nyaml\nheader:\n  actions:\n    - label: \"News\"\n      url: \"/news/index.html\"\n    - label: \"Contact\"\n      url: \"/contact/index.html\"\n  . MM doesn't build the feed, that's coming from the jekyll/jekyll-feed plugin.\nRegardless, I wouldn't worry too much about it. It's building the feed fine. Some browsers have better support for viewing the XML... which I'm guessing Firefox doesn't. But seeing how it's not a feed reader seems like a non-issue to me.. Up to you. I don't really see the issue as I don't try to read XML/Atom feeds in browser, I use a dedicated reader for that. But yes, their GitHub issue tracker would be the appropriate location to file your grievance.\nJekyll Feed does have support for custom feed styles if the default browser ones don't suit you.. FYI if you're building your site use bundle exec jekyll build. You won't need to set the production environment variable then.\nJekyll changed behavior awhille ago that when you spin up a development server with jekyll serve it overides site.url with localhost.. It's controlled via CSS.\nYou have this live somewhere? The theme styles place a rule to the right of the numbers that I'm not seeing in any of your screenshots.\nI have several test examples and haven't seen the numbers get crowded like your examples above.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup-syntax-highlighting/. @MV10 The styling is different because the HTML output is different from using {% highlight linenos %}.\nIf you look at the HTML there are two columns: one for the line numbers the other the actual code. When using {% highlight linenos %} those class names are .gutter and .code\nWhen globally enabling line numbers via Kramdown/Rouge like you have they're .rouge-gutter and .rouge-code, which is why the styling is off.\nWhat probably needs to happen is for me to modify _includes/_syntax.scss slightly to include these .rouge- specific classes. Unless there's a config you can set to tell them to use .gutter and .code instead of the rouge- prefixed ones.\n```scss\n    / line numbers/\n    &.gutter,\n    &.rouge-gutter {\n      padding-right: 1em;\n      width: 1em;\n      color: $base04;\n      border-right: 1px solid $base04;\n      text-align: right;\n    }\n/* code */\n&.code,\n&.rouge-code {\n  padding-left: 1em;\n}\n\n``. I've pushed these changes so once I release the next version of the theme you can remove from yourmain.scss.. Site title is controlled bytitle` in your _config.yml and is part of the masthead include\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/masthead.html#L5\ntitle in a posts YAML is for page.title, which is very different from what outputs in the masthead header.. Issue isn't the theme, its standard Jekyll stuff. For a refresher give their docs a good look over.\nBut the short of it is, Jekyll will use the path/filename of your source Markdown file along with your permalink structure set in _config.yml to determine where the .html is built and named.\nIn your case you have /_pages/home.md with a permalink of / which should work. But the problem is you also have index.html in the root of your project. That's likely overwriting home.md which is why you aren't seeing the changes.\nDelete index.html and it should work. Or delete home.md and make your changes in index.html. Doesn't matter which option you take, you just can't do both.. Can you share your repo? Remote theme probably isn't configured correctly or you're missing the GitHub Pages gem that installs it.. Run bundle update\nYou're running an older version of github-pages which isn't installing the remote theme gem. That's why it's not finding the layouts and includes.. Not sure what else to tell you, it's definitely your environment.\nI just cloned your repo from that commit, removed _layouts, _includes, and _sass. Ran bundle update, then bundle exec jekyll build and it worked perfectly fine. No errors.\n```terminal\n$ bundle exec jekyll build\nConfiguration file: /Users/michael/Downloads/derfor.vih.dk-cc9b1edcd878dd480bd9a46d72969c0acbf518d1/_config.yml\n            Source: /Users/michael/Downloads/derfor.vih.dk-cc9b1edcd878dd480bd9a46d72969c0acbf518d1\n       Destination: /Users/michael/Downloads/derfor.vih.dk-cc9b1edcd878dd480bd9a46d72969c0acbf518d1/_site\n Incremental build: disabled.

Try using the verbose tag when you build to see if gives any clues. \nterminal\nbundle exec jekyll build --verbose\nMy guess is jekyll-remote-theme gem isn't working for you. I've had troubles getting it to run on Windows environments, not sure what your setup is like.\nBut if that's the case you'll want to file an issue with them since its upstream and not theme related.. Closing as this is a duplicate of #1255.\nThat PR was closed because adding the post's title as an alt description adds zero value. An alt description should describe the image and not simply repeat the post's title which is already outputted on the page.. See #1474 for context as to why it was closed.. Thanks for the PR but I'm trying to balance making everything toggleable. The theme is already gotten out of hand because of I haven't been as diligent with not merging in these sorts of edits.\nIn my opinion the date in an archive is of little value. But of course if you disagree that's what theme overrides are for by adding your own modified layouts/includes to your local build.. You can set permalink to whatever you want, the theme doesn't care.\nThis is a Jekyll core feature, if you need help with setting that up its best to read the official permalink docs and ask any questions on the Jekyll Talk forums.\nClosing as this isn't a theme issue.. permalink: /:title/ will take any post or page and output just the title.\n/_posts/2018-01-15-your-post.md  ~>  /your-post/index.html\nabout.md  ~>  /about/index.html. Pretty sure permalink: /:basename/ isn't a valid key. I tried it and it throws all kinds of Ruby errors and Jekyll doesn't build.\nUse permalink: /:title/ instead like I suggested above.\n```yaml\nDefaults\ndefaults:\n  # _posts\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    value:\n      permalink: /:title/\n``. Thing is you might need to be more specific withpath... perhapspath: \"_pages\"`.\nThe CSS file in assets/css has front matter... which makes it a \"page\" in Jekyll's eyes. There's probably some sort of bug that is rewritting its permalink based on your front matter defaults in _config.yml. It's changing it's path/filename to index.css which obviously is going to break things because the theme is expecting /assets/css/main.css.\nSo try the path I suggested above so it only rewrites the permalinks for the files in _pages. You still might want to open an issue on jekyll/jekyll to see if its a bug. I would create a reduced test case and link to a repo though, because they will want something the can reproduce.. It's most definitely a how Jekyll works and/or issue. Setting a default permalink in the way you're trying isn't something I've seen many people try.\nSo that would explain why it's giving you unpredictable results. I would reduce down exactly what you're trying to do, put a sample repo up, and leave that all in an issue on jekyll/jekyll.\nIt seems that setting a default permalink for all pages is rewriting static asset pages incorrectly. If anything it should change /assets/css/main.css to main.css, but the fact that it's rewritting to index.css instead of using the file title tells me there's a bug or that use case was never built for.\nYou might want to do a write-up and post it to the Jekyll talk forums as it sounds like something all Jekyll users could benefit from since it's not theme specific.. This PR is incomplete and breaks functionality. The theme uses atom_feed.path in many locations. Simply changing it to feed.path in _config.yml isn't enough.\nClosing as I don't think this change is necessary. You still should set atom_feed.path for a custom feed to be used in the theme's footer, and also set feed.path to the same if you're hosting on GitHub Pages and want it to handle that redirect for you.. Thanks for the PR.. Closing as this is a duplicate of #1341. This is an intentional design decision.\nOn smaller screens there is less room for a full blown author sidebar like on 1024px and up. This is why it is collapsed to focus more on what matters, the page's content not the author's profile.. Please search through the closed issues. I've replied to this with examples and actual code more times than I can count.. cc/ #1373, #1265, #623, #384, #74. What problem does this PR propose to solve?. Makes sense. Seems like a niche use case and not something that would benefit most users of the theme, especially with it adding more complexity. \nClosing as this is best left as something you override/customize locally yourself.. @kwlin Good catch. The fix until I get to it is adding this:\nscss\n.social-icons .svg-inline--fa {\n  color: inherit !important;\n}. Do you have a repo with this example? I'd like to drop it in to a test page and see how hard it would be to add some CSS to make feature rows more portable.. Thanks.\nAnd agree on the hover state of feature rows. That's something I recently removed but haven't pushed up yet.. Was a pretty easy fix so I pushed a couple of updates. Here's an example of an archive page with feature rows placed after (might have to flush your browser's cache to get the latest CSS).\n\nPost archive with feature rows (source file)\n\nIn your example where you're using a grid wrapper to expand the main content's width, you need to place the feature row includes inside of that <div>. That will allow the feature rows to fill the entire area without the space on the right.\n```html\n{% assign site_posts = site.posts | where: \"tags\", page.title | sort: \"date\" %}\n\n  {% include feature_row id=\"intro\" type=\"center\" %}\n\n  {% for post in site_posts %}\n    {% include archive-single.html %}\n  {% endfor %}\n\n  Har du ogs\u00e5 l\u00e6st?\n  {% include feature_row type=\"left\" %}\n  {% include feature_row id=\"feature_row_2\" type=\"right\" %}\n  {% include feature_row %}\n\n```. Example with updated CSS:\n. Thanks for the PR.\nQuestion, would the jsonify filter be a better option than xml_escape, or does that not properly escape double quotes?. @d00616 You have to remove the quotes around the variable. To keep things consistent I'd prefer to use jsonify like the others.\nThis would be the change:\nhtml\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n   \"@type\": \"{% if site.social.type %}{{ site.social.type }}{% else %}Person{% endif %}\",\n   \"name\": {{ site.social.name | default: site.name | jsonify }},\n   \"url\": {{ seo_url | jsonify }},\n   \"sameAs\": {{ site.social.links | jsonify }}\n}\n</script>\nWhich produces this valid JSON:\nhtml\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"Person\",\n  \"name\": \"This is a \\\"Test\\\"\",\n  \"url\": null,\n  \"sameAs\": null\n}\n</script>. Thanks!. That's correct, you need to customize _includes/footer.html. Depending on how you installed the theme that process will vary.\nIf you're using it as a remote_theme or Ruby gem you'll copy _includes/footer.html from this repo and add it to your local repo. Any changes you make to it there will override the bundled theme.\nIf you forked the theme repo you can just edit the file directly.. site.time is set by Jekyll automatically to the current time. You don't have to add anything to _config.yml unless you want to override that.\nSimply building your site will automatically update to the current year.\nLooks like your repo hasn't been updated since December. So what you need to do is push up a commit to GitHub so it'll rebuild your site. If you don't have anything that needs updating you can push up an empty commit to force the rebuild.\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"Empty test commit\". @Soumyabrata Looks like you're using an ancient version of MM :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: . This isn't a bug per say. Without getting too much into how CSS works (don't have the time :wink:) you need to split up feature rows from grid items.\nThe grid items are set to float, and clear every 4th item. What's going on in your example above is the 2 feature rows are being counted as grid items, and on the 2nd grid item (technically the 4 item in the grid archive container) it's clearing it. That's why you see two, then the space.\nYou'll have to restructure the HTML to get around that.. Fire up your web browser's development tools and start inspecting the elements. It'll be easier to see what's going on with the clears.\nThe grid layout was built for a specific use case, it's not battle tested to be used in this way without some work on your part.. If you set link: http://whatever.com in the page\u2019s YAML Front Matter it should partially do what you want.\nList view handles it with linking to the external link and the post\u2019s page. That same logic is in the grid view, though I haven\u2019t actually tested it to see how it looks.. For starters your collection YAML is incorrect. share: true isn't indented properly, it should be indented exactly at the same level as the line above it.\nyaml\n  # ux_design\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: ux_design\n    values:\n      layout: splash\n      author_profile: false\n      share: true\nI've seen this error before in the jekyll/jekyll issues and it almost always has to do with some bad line of YAML. Even though it passed linting there might be something in there it doesn't like.\nOr it's your environment and/or an encoding issue with the file. Without a link to a public repo with the issue I can't do a quick test to see if anything jumps out to me.\nEither way I'm almost positive it isn't a theme issue you might want to search the Jekyll issues or their forum for help.\nIf it is determined it is a bug with the theme feel free to reopen.. The permalink on _pages/index.html isn't valid. You need a slash on the end so it knows where to build the index.html.\nShould be permalink: /blog/ instead.\nYou also might want to seriously cleanup the repo. You have many of the theme only files in there /docs, /test, and your Gemfile is wrong. Could run into problems later keeping all that stuff around.\nI'd also suggest renaming /_pages/index.html to _pages/blog.index since the way you have it now might get confusing if you add more pages later on.. Closing as this is a Jekyll issue and not theme specific. If you need help using Jekyll, their community forum is the place to ask.. Yes, the npm run script isn't aware of the assets coming from Jekyll or the ruby gem.\nIf you want to build your own local version of main.min.js using that script you need to copy the entire contents of /assets/js from this repo to your local site. Then run npm run build:js to generate that file... which should then be able to override what comes in the theme.\nThe other option... and possibly less performant since the scripts won't be concatenated is to use the footer_scripts array in your _config.yml.\nThis way you can just drop in your custom JS into /assets/jsand then reference it without needing to build the main.min.js file.\nyaml\nfooter_scripts:\n  - /assets/js/your-custom-footer-script.js\nThe only gotcha here is you using this requires you to list out all of the scripts the theme uses by default because it disables main.min.js.\nIt would end up being something like:\nyaml\nfooter_scripts:\n  - /assets/js/vendor/jquery/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.fitvids.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.greedy-navigation.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.magnific-popup.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.smooth-scroll.min.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/_main.js\n  - /assets/js/your-custom-footer-script.js. Hmmm, not sure what's going on for you. I just created a test repo that uses the remote theme and it worked perfectly fine for me.\nIn my test repo I created /assets/js/my-test-script.js, ran jekyll build\n\n... and as expected Jekyll created my-test-script.js inside the compiled _site folder.\n. No I never figured it out. I only use Windows for testing so I gave up trying to get the remote theme gem to work there since my primary computer is macOS based.\nMight be worth adding to that issue as I assumed it was some weird bug only I was hitting.. This is simple CSS and can be done with the white-space declaration.\ncss\npre {\n  white-space: pre-wrap;\n}\nWill turn codeblocks like this:\n\nInto this (scroll bar goes away and lines are wrapped):\n\n. This is a Jekyll issue and not really something with the theme.\nShort of it is since you're using a baseurl... in this case /minimal-mistakes your asset paths need to include that. So in your Markdown (or HTML) image paths should include that to be something like:\nmarkdown\n![your image](/minimal-mistakes/assets/tools/your-image.jpg)\nor if you want to be smarter about it:\nmarkdown\n![your image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tools/your-image.jpg)\nOr you can use Jekyll's built in relative URL filter to do this for you.\nmarkdown\n![your image]({{ '/assets/tools/your-image.jpg' | relative_url }})\nIf you didn't need a baseurl then the paths as you have them now would work as is.. This can be done with CSS using text-decoration: none.\nPreviously I did this to post titles in an archive, but that was short sighted of me. To make it more clear they are \"link\" and clickable I reverted back to the default styling of a <a> element... underlined.\nYou'll need to drop this into your CSS to override the theme's default.\ncss\n.archive__item-title a {\n  text-decoration: none;\n}. No, as per the stylesheet documentation:\n\nTo make basic tweaks to theme\u2019s style it can be overridden by adding to <your_project>/assets/css/main.scss.. If you want to edit the theme files sure. The masthead links Liquid logic is here...\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/masthead.html#L7-L16\nIf you want to add IDs to those links you can probably use Jekyll's slugify filter applied to the link titles, which you could then target with jQuery.\nhtml\n<a id=\"{{ link.title | slugify }}\" href=\"{{ domain }}{{ link.url }}\" {% if link.description %}title=\"{{ link.description }}\"{% endif %}>{{ link.title }}</a>\nIf you had link.title of My Site you'd get something like this after Jekyll did its thing.\nhtml\n<a id=\"my-site\" href=\"/path-to-my-site/\">My Site</a>. Thanks @jasonday for the quick change. I want to give everything else a look over and make sure none of script functionality breaks when they're squashed together with npm run build:js.\nAfter that should be good to merge in.. @jasonday Would you be able to look at the merge conflicts? Looks like the search form include is out of sync with the latest since I added support for Algolia.\nIt's been moved to _includes/search/search_form.html. There's some case logic in there but shouldn't be too bad to migrate your changes.\nOne other thing I'd like to add would be to replace text strings with site.data.ui-text strings, like I've done with the rest of the theme. This will allow it to be localized in the _data/ui-text.yml.\nFor example the site search visually hidden label:\nhtml\n<label class=\"visually-hidden\" for=\"search\">Site Search</label>\nWould become:\nhtml\n<label class=\"visually-hidden\" for=\"search\">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].site_search_label | default: 'Site Search' }}</label>\nAnd then in _data/ui-text.yml a line under the en key would need to be added:\nyaml\nsite_search_label: \"Site Search\"\nand a blank value for all the other languages so they could be localized in the future:\n```yaml\nes, fr, tr, pt, pt-BR, it, zh, de, ne, ko, ru, li, gr, sv, nl, id, vi, da, po, ja\nsite_search_label:\n``. @jasonday No rush. Whenever you have the time.. Your test post has the wrong layout, that\u2019s why it\u2019s not working. The theme doesn\u2019t have apostlayout. Uselayout: single` instead.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#single-layout. Doesn't look like you've set url in _config.yml properly.\nBe sure that matches the location of your production site so the CSS, JS, and other assets resolve to the correct paths.. 1. Check your default configs as it looks wrong to me. Remove the _posts line (or comment it out), it should be the following:\nyaml\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      author_profile: true\n      read_time: true\n      comments: # true\n      share: true\n      related: true\n\n\nI don't advise forking the theme. Since you're hosting with GitHub Pages you should follow the \"remote theme\" instructions. \n\n\nYou have quite a few of the theme's development only files still in your repo that should be removed:\n\n\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remove-the-unnecessary\n\nYour Gemfile is going to give you problems as its the development version... another reason forking the theme directly isn't a good idea. It should resemble this instead. I suggest reading over the docs and follow them for how to edit/create a valid Gemfile for running a GitHub Pages friendly version of Jekyll locally.\n\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/#install-dependencies. Link to a public repo so I can debug or it didn't happen \ud83d\ude1d. Also you may be having more of a \"web development\" and JavaScript issue which I can't really help much with.\n\"And NOTHING happens\" is extremely vague. \n\nNothing happens as in your script isn't being loaded (verify this by looking at your HTML source) or nothing\nOr nothing happens as in your script loads but it's faulty and doesn't do what you expect?\n\nSounds like you wrote some custom jQuery. And for that to work it needs to execute after jQuery has loaded.. which happens right before the closing </body> element near the footer.\nYou'll need to load your custom script after jQuery, so either squash it all together with the other scripts into a new main.min.js, or add a footer script array that has it.\nIf you add the array you'll need to include all of the scripts as using the array will override the use of main.min.js. You'll need to load jQuery first, then all of the plugins the theme uses, followed by main.js, and finally your custom stuff.\n\nNote: If you assign footer_scripts the theme\u2019s /assets/js/main.min.js file will be deactivated. This script includes jQuery and various other plugins that you\u2019ll need to find replacements for and include separately.\n\nIt's really up to you how you want to handle it.. You have a typo in your scripts.html include. Missing a > on your closing script tag on the custom stuff you added.. And if you want to load your script without having the include see my notes above. You have to execute your scripts after jQuery loads or else it will fail.\nThat's what happens when you tried to put it in the head.. Doesn't look like a theme issue to me. You're better off asking for general Jekyll related help on their talk forum.\nIt looks to me like you don't have any valid collection documents in _mynotes. Jekyll will only process files with YAML Front matter. I didn't see any files in that folder that meet that requirement. Even though there are .md files I believe Jekyll still needs the --- front matter to do is thing.\nThat's why your collection index page appears empty.. You have a link to a public repo? I can't help troubleshoot your issue without it.. Ah yeah seen this one before. You have to use | as a HTML entity, since it breaks some of the Liquid code if you don't.\nSee this issue for the fix.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/760. Happy to accept a pull request if you want to update the documentation files to include a note about using title_separator: \"|\".\nAs far as blank spaces and lines. Do you mean in the actual rendered page? Or in the HTML source? If its the source that's a side effect of Liquid. You'll see a bunch of blank lines and inconsistent indentation due to for loops and conditionals.\nLiquid 4 allows you to collapse some of that, but it doesn't completly remove it. It's a non-issue if you ask me. On my personal site I pipe all my .html files through minifiers to strip all that out and reduce the file sizes for improved page load.. No problem. I also made a small fix to the seo.html include. It automatically replaces | with the HTML entity now, so it should work making that the separator in _config.yml.. Thanks!. What's going on is your links in the sidebar go to different pages. That's why you're seeing a reload.\nIf the links are anchors to content on the existing page it will scroll down the page and not reload. But looks like all of those sidebar links go to other pages. Nothing the theme can do about that.. Thanks @TpmKranz . It appears you have the homepage misconfigured.\nYour post shows up fine:\nhttps://estelll.github.io/jekyll/update/2018/01/31/welcome-to-jekyll.html. Please consult the home layout documentation. You need to configure Jekyll's pagination for it to display posts on the index page.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#home-page-layout. 1. Rename index.md to index.html\n2. Add pagination settings to _config.yml\n3. Verify jekyll-paginate plugin is installed. This is a known issue with jekyll-remote-theme and Windows... it has nothing to do with my theme. In fact I've had the same problem trying to use it on Windows to test locally.\nYou might want to chime in here since you're not the only one with the issue.\nhttps://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme/issues/18. Also the reason it's still not working on GitHub Pages is you have both index.html and index.md in the root of your project. That's confusing Jekyll.\nRemove the index.md file and it should work.. Have a thorough read through the docs and README, I mention a few times all of the demo pages are in the /docs folder, where you can see the source code to copy into your own project.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/docs/_pages. Please search through the issues, you'll find your answer there.\nClosing as this is a duplicate of #1352, #1219, and #1184.. Not sure that would work or look very well. Images would need to be much smaller to fit 2 or 3 across while floating alongside some text.. The elegant approach here is to utilize the classes front matter instead of adding a new layout.\nFor a page you'd want the wide variant of you'd do something like:\n```yaml\nlayout: single\nclasses: wide\n\n```\nWhich would put a wide class on the <body> element. You could then add similar CSS to what you did but using .wide to override the page and sidebar classes.\n```scss\n.wide {\n.page {\n    // override right padding and width's to make wide\n  }\n.sidebar__right {\n    // override negative margin, width, positioning, etc.\n  }\n// any other overrides needed for a wide .page\n}\n```. If you want to take a stab at this I'll review it and see about getting it merged in.. Looks good @peterahrens, thanks for making the change and resubmitting.. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup-text-readability-wide-page/. Probably use a different theme that's built for Bootstrap.\nYou're not going to be able to drop in the Bootstrap styles with MM because it wasn't built for it. There will be clashes in class names and such.. Check your configuration, you don't have remote_theme set properly. You have it on the wrong theme...\nhttps://github.com/srinivasakumar-a/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_config.yml#L56. Closing as this looks like you've fixed it. When I visit your site it shows it is using version 4.9.1 and has the correct skin. If you're not seeing the same make sure you've flushed your browser's cache.\n\n. If your Gemfile.lock says 4.9.1 then you have the latest version installed.\nOther things to check are to make sure you've flushed your browser's cache. This usually affects the .css and .js more so than the .html files.\nAlso, do you have any _layouts you are overriding? I got bit by this once where I created a modified version of _layouts/default.html which replaced the bundled theme's version. This file is what prints the theme's version number.\nSo if you're overiding it, you won't get the current version info in your .html files.. :smile: No worries.. @peterewills Check your _includes/scripts.html file which is out of sync with the core theme. It's missing the following line which loads Font Awesome.\nhtml\n<script src=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.6/js/all.js\"></script>. Probably not a good idea to build something like navigation with JavaScript. It will cease to work if the user has it disabled and isn't as accessible.\nI would use an include and build it from a data file just like I'm currently doing. If you're looking to do a dropdown it can be done pretty easily. I purposely didn't use that pattern for this theme as it complicates things, but generating the HTML needed for it is pretty easy.\nA simple example would be something like this:\nDrop-Down Navigation Data File:\n```\nexample /_data/navigation.yml\n\n\ntitle: \"About\"\n  href: \"/about/\"\n  children:\n\nchildtitle: \"Biography\"\n  childhref: \"/about/bio/\"\nchildtitle: \"Resume\"\n  childhref: \"/about/resume/\"\n\n\n\ntitle: \"Portfolio\"\n  href: \"/portfolio/\"\n  children:\n\nchildtitle: \"Design\"\n  childhref: \"/portfolio/design/\"\nchildtitle: \"Illustration\"\n  childhref: \"/portfolio/illustration/\"\nchildtitle: \"Development\"\n  childhref: \"/portfolio/development/\"\n```\n\n\n\nDrop-Down Navigation HTML and Liquid:\nhtml\n<ul>\n  {% for nav in site.data.navigation %}\n    {% if nav.children != null %}\n      <li><a href=\"{{ nav.href }}\">{{ nav.title }}</a>\n        <ul class=\"child\">\n        {% for child in nav.children %}\n          <li><a href=\"{{ child.childhref }}\">{{ child.childtitle }}</a></li>\n        {% endfor %}\n        </ul>\n        {% else %}\n      <li><a href=\"{{ nav.href }}\">{{ nav.title }}</a>{% endif %}</li>\n  {% endfor %}\n</ul>\nWhich will produce the following HTML:\nhtml\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/about/\">About</a>\n    <ul class=\"child\">\n      <li><a href=\"/about/bio/\">Biography</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/about/resume/\">Resume</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"/portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>\n    <ul class=\"child\">\n      <li><a href=\"/portfolio/design/\">Design</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/portfolio/illustration/\">Illustration</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/portfolio/development/\">Development</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nThen you can style and/or add JavaScript to make the dropdowns hide/reveal child links.. My suggestion would be to pull out the greedy nav, and build a dropdown specific nav. Don't use any of the existing classes I am or else you'll be fighting that styling.\nThere are a bunch of tutorials on how to do this with Jekyll if my example below doesn't get you there.\n\nhttps://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/12/creating-dynamic-menus-in-jekyll/\nhttp://planetjekyll.github.io/snippets/nav-with-data.html\nhttps://mycyberuniverse.com/web/jekyll-bootstrap-dynamic-navigation-highlighting-active-element.html\nhttps://gist.github.com/pdarragh/c7ca120604c1a1d8b8de\nhttps://github.com/ahti/jekyll-menu. You have your site configured wrong.\n\nIf you inspect the source of any page you'll see the paths are wrong (it's duplicating some stuff and you have an extra /).\nFor example this:\nhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://jacc.github.io/JBGuide//JBGuide/assets/css/main.css\">\nI'd take a closer look at url, baseurl, repository, etc in your _config.yml and try to sort that out. This isn't a theme issue.. > To add a new link you\u2019ll need three things:\n\n\nDestination URL\nFont Awesome icon (fa- class)\nLabel for the link\n\n\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#author-profile. Anything is possible if you know HTML and CSS.. Inspecting elements with your browser's web developer tools is the way to go. It'll tell you all the CSS you'll need to apply to match the styling.\nYou'll probably need to add some custom CSS too to fine tune things.\n\n. Custom CSS - https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/#customizing. Also, if you mimic the same HTML markup used for the other icons it'll pick up the correct styling and fix the font issue. I'm guessing you didn't drop it into an <li> element like the others. \nOr because you're outside of the other author links unordered list or adding the resource heading it doesn't have the parent styling or something broke. Hard to tell without seeing your actual HTML.\nAnd since FontAwesome injects their icons as SVGs, if you put yours in as an inline SVG and apply the same classes they do, it should \"just work\". I say should because I have no clue how your SVG's are built or marked-up, so they are a bit of a wild card.\nhtml\n<li>\n  <a href=\"https://whatever.com\">\n    <svg class=\"svg-inline--fa fa-w-14 fa-fw\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 448 512\">\n      ... <!-- svg paths and stuff -->\n    </svg> Whatever\n  </a>\n</li>. @Sciss https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/scripts.html#L12. @Sciss Have a look at Font Awesome's documentation. They changed things in version 5 and added the new fab and fas classes. They have to do with different versions of the icons... solid... brand... regular... etc.\nWhat's the reasons behind switching to font Fork Awesome?. Strange. I just did a test comment on your site and it wasn't blank.\nI don't think Staticman does any sort of form validation. In theory you could type a bunch of spaces in the message field and it would accept it.\nhttps://github.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/commit/cc0306205c6800b3837c7e3e278e5b332f3e7349. This thread might be related. Noticed others mentioning empty values for message along with some fields that weren't there before like layout and moderation.\nhttps://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/176\nThe comment you linked to above has a layout value which leads me to believe Staticman glitched out for you when it was made. Seems like it has possibly sorted itself out now.\nClosing as this doesn't appear to be a theme issue. Feel free to reopen if that's not the case.. It's possible if you're comfortable editing the theme files.\nInstead of post.excerpt you'd replace it with post.content\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/archive-single.html. Looks like you got this working as I see your latest post on the home page.\n. That's because you don't have the layout for the post set correctly. Should be layout: single not default.. Yeah. You probably don't have the pagination gem installed properly. GitHub Pages does all that for you when they host the site. You need to do the same locally.\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/\n. You can use the --future flag when building your Jekyll site, to force publish and future dated posts.. @havesomeleeway This file is your problem.\nhttps://github.com/havesomeleeway/havesomeleeway.github.io/blob/master/_pages/home.md\nAs noted in the docs, a home page that is paginated can't be a markdown file. For whatever reason jekyll-paginate requires it to be named index.html and in the root of your repo.\nRename it and move it out of _pages.. As long as you have the site in a GitHub repo Staticman will work. It uses GitHub's API to push commits with the comments as data files. Your site can be hosted with Netlify (or anywhere else) for this to happen.\nThe form isn't showing up for you because you need to configure your repository in _config.yml\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-repository\nIt's needed as part of the comment form to send a call to Staticman. Without it a form submit won't work. There is a conditional to only show the form when repo and the branch have been assigned.. And you've set your Jekyll environment variable toproduction right?\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#specifying-a-jekyll-environment-at-build-time\nComments are only shown in production, and not development which Jekyll tends to default to.. @stanleykylee Comments work just fine. I just cloned your repo and built it locally. What you're likely having an issue with is the setting Jekyll's environment variable to production... what I stated above for @sfdye applies here as well.\nWhen I built locally with JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build comments show up. \n\nI see you're hosting with Netlify and according to your config file you aren't setting this environment variable.\nI don't have much experience with Netlify but I'd assume you could modify your build script to this instead command = \"JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build && bundle exec jekyll algolia\"\nIf that doesn't work they also let you set environment variables which you could just add JEKYLL_ENV=production. A lot of people forget this step as GitHub Pages automatically sets this for you.. This has nothing to do with Liquid. It\u2019s pure CSS used to style those links. Not sure what can be done to make it fit on a single line as the more pages you have the longer it\u2019ll be.\nMaybe you could replace Previous and Next with a chevron glyph to save space.. Through CSS. All of the masthead styles are in this Sass partial.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_masthead.scss. Theme only supports adding an image to the top of a post or page. If you want a background image in the header or footer you\u2019ll need to hack it yourself.\n\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#headers\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout/uncategorized/layout-header-overlay-image/. Thanks!. Closing as this is a duplicate of #1518. You'll likely need to add some CSS to style the width of these elements. Use your browser's web development tools to inspect them and see if they have a common class name you can apply styling to.\n\nWithout seeing the actual markup I have no clue what a potential fix would be. If I had to guess those images have width: 100% which is scaling them up to fill their parent.. HTML attributes aren't going to fix it as this line is stretching it:\ncss\n.sidebar img {\n    width: 100%;\n}\nEither add inline CSS to your emoji img elements\nhtml\n<img src=\"whatever.png\" style=\"width: 20px; height: 20px;\">\nOr use the .emoji class and add to the global stylesheet.\ncss\n.sidebar img.emoji {\n    width: 20px;\n    height: 20px;\n}. It's there to scale sidebar images like in this test post.\nIf more people have a use for .emoji in the sidebar then I'd happily accept a PR adding the styles above. Though doesn't seem like that's the case as this is the first I've heard of the issue.. This doesn't work because toc: true uses JavaScript too build the table of contents instead of Kramdown.\nTo exclude headers you'll need to use the toc include helper instead.. Even if deprecated you can copy _includes/toc into your repo and still use it.. You're missing the ui-text.yml data file. Remote themes don't pull in _data files from the bundled files, so you have to manually copy it over to your repo.. It pulls when you use it as a theme gem since that utilizes a 3rd party plugin to copy the theme's _data files. But sadly that plugin isn't supported on GitHub Pages yet so you have to go through the extra step of copying the file yourself.. I'm not a Ruby dev either. The theme gem doesn't use html-pipeline as a dependency directly.\nMy guess is one of the Jekyll plugins the theme uses, has it as a dependency.\nIf you look at your Gemfile.lock dependencies are indented and should give you a clue which gem(s) need it. Then you can follow-up with the plugin maintainer to see what filters are needed.. Sounds about right. \nYou can inquire with that project but I'm guessing you can probably ignore the post install messaging.. Have you set JEKYLL_ENV=production?\n\nComments are disabled by default in development. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to set JEKYLL_ENV=production to force the environment to production.\n\nref: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#comments. @sheldonhull Not sure what else to tell you as I don't use Docker or Netlify. The issue does seem to be related to them and setting environment variables.\nThis is the line in the theme that sets that condition. \nhtml\n{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' and site.comments.provider and page.comments %}\n  {% include comments.html %}\n{% endif %}\nIt only shows comments when Jekyll's environment is set to production, comments.provider is set in _config.yml, and the post has comments: true in its YAML Front Matter. If any one of these are false it won't output the comments.html include.\nIf you're having trouble properly setting production then my suggestion would be to remove the condition in the theme.. @RichStone Check your config file. You have two default keys in _config.yml... the first set of defaults that assigns comments: true to all your posts is being replaced with the second set you're using for pages.\n```yaml\ndefaults:\n  # _posts\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      author_profile: true\n      read_time: true\n      comments: true\n      share: true\n      related: true\ndefaults:\n  # _pages\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: pages\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      author_profile: true\n```\nIt should be this instead (note there's only one default key with all post/page scopes indented under it:\nyaml\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      author_profile: true\n      read_time: true\n      comments: true\n      share: true\n      related: true\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: pages\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      author_profile: true\n. Thanks for the PR!. Just a matter of preference that gets enforced by text editors that support .editorconfig.\n[*]\ninsert_final_newline = true\nref: http://editorconfig.org/. To be clear, I don't add these new lines. It is 100% controlled by my text editor and what is in .editorconfig (default values for the most part).\nIf the mixture in line ending styles is being caused by that, I'd be interested in a fix.. Looks like it could be a side-effect of my text editor (Visual Studio Code) ignoring what's in .editorconfig and defaulting to CRLF line endings.. Beats me. I build the theme on macOS and Windows and all of the defaults are set to LF. So I have no idea why anything is CRLF.. Might have to do with Bundler then. 4.10.1 was gem build on macOS, the others were likely Windows. No idea why it decides to change the line endings when all of the source files are authored with LF.. This isn't a typo. Liquid uses elsif and not elseif. Changing to that will break the logic.\nref: https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/tags/control-flow-tags#else-elsif. It's different because you're not using the GitHub Pages gem to test locally. \nYou need to update your Gemfile and settings so they mirror what GitHub uses. The version of Jekyll and other dependencies aren't the latest which can account for differences.. Follow the instructions I provided in the previous message for setting up your local environment. You need to use the github-pages gem instead of vanilla Jekyll. This will allow you to mimic GitHub Page's environment.\nThe fact that it publishes correctly there tells me the theme is working as intended. You have something screwy going on with your local environment. You'll need to ask for help on one of Jekyll's support channels as your issue lies there and not with the theme.\nClosing this issue for that reason.. Don\u2019t think your default front matter in _config.yml is correct for \u201cPages\u201d, having just scope isn\u2019t enough. You need to specify the path where your pages reside.\nyaml \n- scope:\n    path: \"_pages\"\n    type: pages\nIf that doesn\u2019t work then just add the author profile front matter flag directly to about.md\nyaml \nauthor_profile: true\nClosing as this is a more of a \u201chow do I use Jekyll\u201d question that is better asked on their help site.\nref: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults. Not sure I follow what your issue is then. Your About page is showing social network links in the author sidebar fine for me.\n. It's definitely related to your browser. Either it's some weird caching thing (try it in a private tab) or you have a content/ad blocker installed and it's screwing with the page.\nI can assure you the theme is working as intended and you have it properly configured in both _config.yml and about.md's YAML Front Matter.\n\n\n. See https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1429. Not sure if the documentation site will ever use Algolia due to how Travis CI would need to be integrated and how I have it under the docs/ folder.\nI built a separate repo that uses master to demo Algolia search.. I'll have to give it some thought. A lot of users clone this repo and use the /docs site as a starter. \nI don't want to do further complicate that and \"junk\" up the repo more than it already is with additional config files. It just becomes a support bottleneck for me as I'm already constrained on time.. The documentation site now uses Algolia search.\nI just had to add a gemfile line to my .travis.yml file and modify the build script slightly to have it find /docs on the master branch.. If you can target the text you want to change the font with a CSS selector should be easy enough.\nYou'd use that selector and add font-family: BrownFox; to it.. Thanks!. You're loading some arbitrary JavaScript and CSS that appears to be messing with the page.\n\nI don't think the theme is at fault here. What you might want to try is adding the JavaScript to the footer so it loads after the theme's main scripts. They determine the height of the page to force the footer to the bottom, your scripts are likely interfering with this which is causing the footer to be placed in the middle of the page.. Please read the theme's documentation.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/javascript/. Related #1494, #1504, #1427. The author profile is there, it's just not populating it with any content which makes it look like it's blank.\n\nWhat I believe is happening is your posts have author: \"Pat Eskinasy\" in their YAML Front Matter. When you use this method you also have to include a key with that data in _data/authors.yml so it knows what name, image, social links, etc. to pull in.\nCheck the documentation for an example of that.\nIf your site is a single author site just remove those author lines from the post. The theme will use what you've defined as the author in _config.yml instead. This way you don't have to mess with an author data file.. Have you tried moving the _collectionTest to the root instead of in myfolder? Don't think they work when in other folders as you have.\nEither way this isn't a theme issue. If you need help with collections it is best to ask on the Jekyll Talk forum or file a issue on their repo.. Looks like collections can be grouped in folders but it's a 3.7.0 feature. And GitHub Pages hasn't updated to that version yet so that could be your issue.. Related: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6656. You'll have to use the sort filter on the array... maybe using the size property.\nHave you asked for help on Jekyll Talk? You'll get answer quicker there than from me as this is vanilla Liquid/Jekyll. Nothing special related to the theme to do this.. Also if you look at my other theme So Simple you'll see how I'm sorting it by tag count.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/_layouts/tags.html. New layouts have been added to the master branch and will be available in the next theme release.\n\nlayout: categories\nlayout: tags\nlayout: collection with grid view\nlayout: posts. The way you're doing it is fine, the theme doesn't have any such utility classes for this. It has alignment classes and that's it.. I see the issue. Your comment data files aren't in the correct location. They need to live inside of the _data folder... that is where the theme expects them.\n\nIt matches the post URL to a sub-folder in _data/comments and if it sees any YAML files it spits out the comments. Looks like yours are in the root of the project.\nMove the files to _data so you have something like _data/comments/blog-text/*.yml. Then you'll need to change your Staticman config file so it generates new comments with the proper path.\nInstead of this you'll want to use the default value instead of picking up what I'm using for the demo site:\nyaml\npath: \"/_data/comments/{options.slug}\". Hard to say. Those errors are related to Staticman not liking what you're sending over the wire via the form submit.\nSince you edited the form I'd start there. Could be something simple like you didn't update Staticman's config file to not require fields you removed... or vice versa.\nYou might be able to expand that object in the console to see if there are any clues, but I'm not sure. JavaScript isn't really my forte.. Not sure. In my experience you don't need to tag it, just include the remote theme and everytime it's built it will pull down the latest version from GitHub.\nThe only thing I've seen cause confusion is people expect their sites to update with the latest version... without doing a build. In those cases you have to either push up some new content or do a blank commit to force it.. It could be something as simple as the browser caching the HTML. Make sure you fully flush it, or try opening the page in a private/incognito tab as that doesn't use the cache.. Can you use the gem version instead or are you hosting on GitHub Pages?\nThe Ruby gem version is more stable as Jekyll's remote theme plugin is fairly new and potentially has bugs.. Also make sure you don't have any local copies of _layouts, _includes, _sass, etc.\nFrom the looks of your repo that's what you've done. They're are overriding the remote theme's versions which is why you are seeing 4.9.0 and not the latest.\nRemove them and it'll solve your problem.. Not sure this is a bug. There is some JavaScript that calculates the screen height to push the footer to the absolute bottom.\nBefore this, pages with little to no content that didn't fill the viewport, would cause the footer to float in the middle of the page because the content wasn't tall enough to push it down.\nTry adding some posts and content and see if things improve for you.. I did some testing with a page that had no content and everything looks as expect.\nThere's some extra whitespace in the main content area, but that's due to some sidebar CSS that stretches it fill the height of the viewport. This is needed to make it \"stick\" on pages that have some extra content.\nWhat you can do is use your browser's web developer tools and inspect elements. It'll give you a better idea of what's going on... like the following screenshot (you can see how the sidebar stretches even though it isn't really that tall with content).\n\nClosing as I everything appears to be working as intended. If you think otherwise, have a public repo that replicates the problem, and indicate what browser it's doing it in I can dig in further. Feel free to reopen the issue is that's the case.. Also if this is an issue for you... you can remove the sticky class from the sidebar. It will remove the CSS that gives it a height to fill the viewport.. Are you correctly assigning JEKYLL_ENV=production at build? Jekyll defaults development, which overrides url with localhost... or in your case 0.0.0.0:PORT.\nGive production a try first. absolute_url could likely be changed to relative_url, but I think your issue is the environment flag. You might want to search through the closed issues as I know I've seen others who had the same problem and solved it without messing with the theme.. Here's how to solve it. Closing as this is a duplicate.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1162#issuecomment-320642249. This is where multiple config files can come into place. You can daisy chain them in your build command.\n\nSpecify config files instead of using _config.ymlautomatically. Settings in later files override settings in earlier files.\nref: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/\n\n```yaml\n_config.yml\ncontains all your normal configs\n```\n```yaml\n_config.dev.yml (or whatever you want to name it)\nadd any variables you want to override for development purposes\nurl: http://localhost:4000\n```\nThen your Jekyll build command would change to jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml. Thanks.\nI think where it makes sense then sure submit a PR with cleaned up whitespace and indention. For the most the source should be pretty clean.\nThough likely what you're seeing is the product of Liquid. Things like {% for %}, conditionals, etc. don't collapse and that accounts for all the whitespace and screwed up indentation in the outputted HTML. Liquid 4 has a way to control the whitespace now so I'd be interested in PR's that help with that.\nThat said I'm not super concerned about the whitespace. Anyone who cares about page performance should be minifying their HTML anyways to strip out all whitespace and get the file size down. As long as the source is readable that's mainly what I'd like to see upheld.. Sounds good.. If it was working for you and you made no changes then it's likely something on Staticman's side. I don't control that so you might want to inquire with the project on GitHub.. Maybe. Could probably wrap those lines in a Liquid conditional, but Staticman shouldn't care if you send extra data.\nThe only time I see it fail is when you try to submit a form with missing required fields, as defined in the Staticman config. These recaptca lines aren't required.. I believe it's related to changes occurring on the Staticman repo. I haven't touched the MM demo site or anything related to Staticman comments and it's failing there too.. You sure you have the latest version of the theme and its assets (JS, CSS, etc.)? This was fixed in https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/356c1eb0937ab514bda35662afb656e3c06fdeca\nHitting the search icon toggles the Algolia search box and focuses on it for the demo site... which is using the latest version of the theme.. Closing as you haven't upgraded to the latest version of the theme. Your main.min.js is still using 4.9.0...\nUpdate that to latest.. Whatever you modified, you also removed main.min.js from being included in the page. You need to load that script.\nWithout it, it's not going to toggle the search bar when you click the icon. That's why it's not doing anything for you.. I can see the divs that have the search input and they work. If you can sort out adding back in the theme's main.min.js script to toggle them, search works fine.\n\n. You can't disable them without customizing the theme.\nThe relevant line is here which brings in an include for the buttons {% include post_pagination.html %}\nWhat you could do is add a blank file /_includes/post_pagination.html to your local repo which would override the one bundled in the theme. It would have the same affect as removing the buttons from the page.. This isn\u2019t a theme issue so I\u2019m going to close it.\nIt I can give you a hint how to fix it. You need to wrap Liquid tags like {% for %} or any variables {{ yourVar }} with raw tags so they are aren\u2019t processed when Jekyll builds your site.\nRef: https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/tags/theme-tags#raw\n. As noted in the documentation and several times previously in related issues you need to set Jekyll's environment variable to production. There is a condition in the theme that will only show the comments section when it is production, you've set a comments.provider in _config.yml, and comments: true in the post's front matter.\n\nNote: Comments are disabled by default in development. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to set JEKYLL_ENV=production to force the environment to production.\nref: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#comments\n\nRelated issues: #1562, #1544. Also comments appear to be working fine as far as I can tell. You have the comment form on your posts.\nhttps://www.christianwerner.net/tech/Hello-World/\nYou don't have any comments created by Staticman yet... (you'd know because you'd have files in _data/comments/).\nI just submitted a comment on that post and it went through.\n\nClosing as this seems to be a non-issue.. Fixed in #1598 . Closing as the solution is exactly what @pgyogesh proposed above. Set layout: single instead of post... either by manually changing it in all your _posts/ or removing layout from them and setting it once with a front matter default in _config.yml.. It's not working because you wrote invalid YAML. Remove the commas after true\nyaml\nsearch                   : true, #false (default)\nsearch_full_content      : true, #false (default). GitHub Pages automatically sets the environment to production when they build your site.\nSo you changing the conditional to != likely broke it.\nIs this a public repo? I need to see the rest of your files so I can reproduce and run a build locally. I can almost guarantee it's not a bug but a setting that was omitted.. Check your remote repo setting as you're pushing to the wrong location.. This is related to #1578, #1494, #1504, #1427\nWhat is going on is JavaScript is determining the height of the page so it can push the footer to the absolute bottom.\nOtherwise on pages with very little content the gray footer bar floats in the middle of the page.\nIf it bothers you, you can simply rip out the JavaScript that does this.. No, there is not. This theme doesn't support any such feature, the navigation purposely doesn't overlap header images.\nYou'll need to use a different theme or hack it yourself.. Your issue is a bunch of the theme's Sass partials are missing. The error above tells you exactly which one... vendor/breakpoint/breakpoint.\nLooking at your repo you're trying to override some of the theme's Sass partials in _sass. Jekyll won't work if you try this. Take a look at the theme docs where I explain this.\nYou either have to copy the entire contents of _sass from the theme and adjust as you see fit (sort of defeats the purpose of using the theme as a Ruby gem). For whatever reason Jekyll won't let you override specific Sass partials, it's either all or none.\nWhat you need to do instead is add your variable overrides or any other custom CSS to /assets/css/main.scss.. Your assets/css/main.scss isn't current either. It should be something like the following:\n```scss\nOnly the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)\n\n@charset \"utf-8\";\n@import \"minimal-mistakes/skins/{{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin | default: 'default' }}\"; // skin\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\"; // main partials\n```\nWhat you can do is add any Sass variables you want to override before the two @imports. And then @import your custom.scss file or anything else you want to add after the minimal-mistakes one.. If you open your browser's console you'll see more info on the error.\n\nUsually when Staticman reports a 500 error it's because you're sending over data it doesn't like or isn't valid. I'd double check your settings are correct. If there are fields in the form that are marked required and you aren't sending data Staticman will error.\nAt quick glance you have recaptcha configured in staticman.yml but not in _config.yml which is probably the issue. Staticman is expecting it but you don't have it active in _config.yml so the fields that send over keys back to Staticman aren't present.\nAlso you aren't on the current version of the theme. So I'd upgrade as well.. It's definitely your config settings and or not using the latest version of theme. \nYour site still doesn't allow the recaptcha box which tells me you might be using an older version of the theme.\nSince you have it enabled Staticman expects it and that is failing.\nNot sure what else to suggest. Update the theme and compare config settings against the demo site as Staticman works there.\nIf you aren't customizing the theme you should install it as a remote_theme as it is much easier to upgrade. You won't have to deal with merge conflicts or pulling from upstream.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#installing-the-theme. The YAML in your _config.yml is bad, it is very particular about spaces. You need to add a single space after the colons. That would explain why the reCaptcha widget isn't appearing in the comment box.\nyaml\nreCaptcha:\n  siteKey                : \"6Ler208UAAAAAO-pE8g5IDEGD-i0eF6iReihVB1z\"\n  secret                 : \"6Ler208UAAAAAFkPcx43nx-qtHgo6HXo7ozSff92\"\nCan you confirm that you've done the required steps in the docs? If you don't setup Staticman correctly with GitHub it's not going to work.\n\n\nAllow Staticman push access to your GitHub repository by clicking on Settings, then the Collaborators tab and adding staticmanapp as a collaborator.\n\n\nTo accept the pending invitation visit: https://api.staticman.net/v2/connect/fedebarabas/fedebarabas.github.io. Consult the Staticman \u201cGet Started\u201d guide for more info.. Not with the theme. You'll need a Jekyll plugin or something custom. \n\n\nAsk for suggestions on Jekyll's help forum.\nhttps://talk.jekyllrb.com/. There is not, unless you want to hack something up yourself.\nCurrently the only way to get an icon in there is by using a Font Awesome one, so the easiest solution would be to use something generic.. I\u2019d say if it\u2019s not something Font Awesome supports and requires custom hacks to get in. Then it\u2019s best left to local customizations and not folded into the core theme.\nCustomizations like this are best suited for https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/author-profile-custom-links.html\n. Thanks for the PR.. @wAuner I would suggest you open up your question to the larger Jekyll community to see if others have had success integrating GitHub Pages with Cloudflare.\nThis has little to do with Jekyll... and even less with the theme. It's purely a hosting thing. You could try asking on Jekyll Talk, but likely would have greater success with Stackoverflow.. I think you'll have to use the title attribute as that's a very common Jekyll convention.\nSetting the h1 element in your Markdown file isn't something I see often. It's almost always left out and added as a title. Jekyll even goes as far as to pull the title from your .md filename if omitted.\nI get the reason why you'd want to include the h1 directly in the body as it looks better when viewing source on GitHub. But it breaks some common patterns with Jekyll, not to mention SEO things... as you'll get 2 h1 elements on the page. Which isn't desirable.\nYou might want to poke around jekyll/jekyll or ask for suggestions on Jekyll Talk. I have to feel others have hit this (especially those who use Jekyll for site docs). There may even be a way to have Kramdown ignore # Headline when Jekyll parses it, giving you the best of both worlds.. Solution is to use jekyll-titles-from-headings plugin to strip page-title and replace with body content heading.\nReference: http://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/title-derived-from-heading-appears-twice-on-top-of-page/1686/4?u=mmistakes. I think it's working just fine. I see a site that looks like you've customized the CSS...\nWhat's probably happening for you is you didn't clear your browser's cache and aren't seeing your new CSS. That or you didn't give GitHub enough time to rebuild your site after pushing changes.\n\n. Edit _includes/feature_row to behave how you want.\nHere's the line that applies the link to a text anchor styled as a button. You could use the same Liquid variable and wrap the entire feature if that's what you want as the link.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/feature_row#L43. That's correct. You'll likely need to add text-decoration: none to something to remove the underlines.. Best bit of advice I can give you when having CSS issues is open the page in your browser's web developer tools. And start poking around the elements to see which one you need to apply CSS to.\nYou likely have the wrong specificity or it's being overrided somewhere else in the cascade.. You don't have the UI text data file in your repo, that's why it's all defaulting to English.\nCopy _data/ui-text.yml to your repo and it'll work. Since you're hosting with GH and using as a remote theme you need to do this as it can't pull it from the bundled gem.\nThe ruby gem version doesn't have that limitation...\nThe Jekyll build failure has nothing to do with the theme. You'll want to poke around jekyll/jekyll or ask for help through their approved channels.. Agreed @coliff. I'm not sure if this is even something worth merging into the theme. Is there a big enough need for it?\n@pateskinasy If it were to be merged it would need to be made more flexible... namely making yourbaseurl, youruuid, and yourlid variables in the script something theme user's could set from _config.yml. And as @coliff pointed out, would need to be opt-in. Meaning you'd probably want to wrap {% include newsletter.html %} with some sort of Liquid condition:\nhtml\n{% if site.mc_baseurl and site.mc_uuid and site.mc_lid %}\n  {% include newsletter.html %}\n{% endif %}\nWith better named variables obvioulsy :wink:. Sounds good @pateskinasy and thanks for the PR.\nI'll leave this open. Let's see if users chime in if this would be useful. I'm trying to avoid bloating the theme with features that aren't used by more than 80% of its users. As something like this can easily be added to scripts.html or footer/custom.html includes already provided... I don't see much reason to merge it in.\nBut let's see if it's something a bunch of people want and can convince me to add it.. Leaving categories_label and tags_label blank won't work because the theme is setting the default value to \"Categories: \" and \"Tags: \" inside of _includes/category-list.html and _includes/tag-list.html.\nYou can remedy this by:\n\nFeed both a string with a space\n    yaml\n    tags_label: \" \"\n    categories_label: \" \"\nRemove the default values from category-list.html and tag-list.html... | default: \"Tags:\" and | default: \"Categories:\"\n\nEither will get you the following result:\n. Looks good @4brunu, thanks for the PR!. Yes. Just released a new version.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/4.11.2. Jekyll Feed only generates a feed for \"posts\". The Markdown files in your _tutorial folder are collection documents. That's why you're not seeing them.\nYou'll need to request that feature from Jekyll Feed if you want them to support collections. Or you can build your own feed for the tutorial documents, by forking their feed.xml file and changing the site.posts loop to be site.tutorial instead.\nliquid\n{% assign posts = site.tutorial | where_exp: \"post\", \"post.draft != true\" %}. Not sure. This is a question you should ask the maintainers of Font Awesome. The SVG in JS version is what they recommend.\nhttps://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/\n          . @coliff Happy to look at a PR if you want to swap out the SVG/JS version with the CSS/webfont one. I know there have been issues (#1457) with JavaScript in the menu executing slowly. As far as I can tell those issues started after switching to the JS version of FontAwesome.\nI'd be curious to see if going back to the CSS/webfont version speeds up the page load some and fixes it.. The version of FA linked in the theme is a few versions back. You'll have to wait until #1620 is merged in or apply the patch manually to your site.. RSS feed is built with jekyll-feed. They only support a single feed for all posts. If you want tag based feeds you'd have to build those yourself, similar to what I suggested in #1460.\nYou'd create a feed .xml page for each tag and with a line similar to the following for grabbing all posts for a given tag/category.\n{% assign posts = site.tag.your_tag | where_exp: \"post\", \"post.draft != true\" %}\nThere is currently an open issue on jekyll-feed to do what you want. I'd weigh in there to try and persuade the maintainers of that plugin to add such a feature.\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/issues/70. You'll have to pull out this line from _includes/footer.html\nhtml\n<li><a href=\"{% if site.atom_feed.path %}{{ site.atom_feed.path }}{% else %}{{ '/feed.xml' | relative_url }}{% endif %}\"><i class=\"fas fa-fw fa-rss-square\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].feed_label | default: \"Feed\" }}</a></li>\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/footer.html#L21. Thanks @user414. I had a quick look over the PR and don't see any issues prior to me testing it.\nDo you happen to have a working example of it pushed somewhere to see how everything looks on a deployed site?. OK. I did a quick test and things look mostly good.\nUnder the \"Look and Feel\" section of CSE, if you use the default Overlay layout things appear broken. Search results overlay has z-index issues, masthead and footer appear above it and cut into the results.\n\nFull Width and Results Only layouts both look pretty good.\n\nNot sure if it's worth worrying about the \"Overlay\" layout and just make mention in the config documentation to use Full width or Results only layouts.. I meant in the documentation...I can take care of that.\nFull width works fine as does \"results only\". To my eye they look identical. I didn't try all of the look and feel layouts, but the one that definitely looks broken is \"overlay\".\n\nI'm fine with leaving the styling alone as it seems all of that can be configured in CSE's look and feel section. This is my first experience using CSE on a site so not really sure what people expect from it. That was part of the reason I was dragging my feet adding the feature.\nAdding something I don't use personally causes a clash when I start getting support requests about it.. Looks good, thanks for the PR.. You have a link to your repo having the issue? I'm using the remote theme to build the docs and all builds have worked fine since this PR.\nMy guess is you have a custom SCSS file that is overidding the theme's files and is missing the $gitlab-color variable.. You're best bet would be to star and \"watch\" this repo. GitHub will send you emails when commits are pushed so you'll know what's being worked on if you need to react to them due to having a custom build.. Also, if you want to lock what version of the theme you use vs. being on the bleeding edge of master you can do something like this in your _config.yml file:\nyaml\nremote_theme: mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.11.2. Thanks for the PR. I think I have an alternative way of doing this that requires zero markup changes to the footer include.\nAll that's needed is the following CSS added to _footer.scss\ncss\n.page__footer-follow .social-icons a {\n    white-space: nowrap;\n}\nAnd it'll force the lines of text not to wrap. Which ends up looking like this on your site:\n\n. If you want to make that change instead I can merge this in.. This doesn't look like a theme issue to me, but a content issue.\nNot entirely sure where https://www.pateskinasy.com/_posts/2016-08-15-not-startup-post-mortem/ is coming from. You shouldn't have any posts that have _posts in the URL. Have you done a good look through your entire repo to make sure you don't have a duplicate .md somewhere... possibly with a permalink set to the above.\nMy theme has nothing to do with generating .html files... that's Jekyll. Only thing I can think of is you have a duplicate file buried in one of your folders or you're using some sort of plugin that's duplicating it improperly.. Found your problem... it's your _config.yml.\nYou added _posts to Jekyll's include array and I think that's confusing it. _posts are included by default so you can remove that line the duplicated pages will go away.\nyaml\ninclude:\n  - .htaccess\n  - _pages. @BenjaminJurke Have you dug up and info that specifically calls out using FontAwesome or Google Fonts from external servers you don't control i.e. CDNs?\nUnder scrutiny and not compliant are two different things. Not sure how compelled I am to add the extra complexity to load FA locally or via a 3rd party server. A time ago I included all of the FA files with the theme, but they were always out of sync and it became much easier to use the .js version.\nIt also gives users the flexibility to override the _includes the theme loads that file to bump to a newer version if I haven't gotten to it. Much easier for them to change a single line than override a boatload of SCSS files and fonts if they want the latest icons.. Sounds like a world of hurt :worried: . I'll look into ways of possibly easing the pain for locally hosting FontAwesome in the theme.\nIn the past I manually included all the FontAwesome CSS and fonts with the theme so they could be bundled in. It just got unwieldy having to commit all those assets every time they added a new icon and I used the bump to version 5 as an excuse to offload it to CDN version.\nThere's probably some build step I could employ to do it or drop it in as a Git submodule to handle updates without having to actually commit the files to this repo. But not sure if that's worth the trouble.\nCurious to see how other theme developers handle this. I know this theme isn't alone, pretty much every theme out there that uses externally hosted copies of jQuery, Google Fonts, FA, and many other scripts will get bit.\nPerhaps they just punt on the issue as their user base is smaller and can get away with it.... I didn't even consider WordPress and its ecosystem. So many plugins and themes offload to CDNs to load 3rd party scripts and styles, they're in for a fun time...\nI'm with you, seriously doubt its going to be enforced. But does sort of stink for those who want to do the right thing.. Lunr search only indexes collection documents e.g. posts or any custom collections you have. It does not currently index site.pages which is why you're not seeing those in search results.\nI'd suggest using Jekyll Algolia instead since it's indexing is way more powerful and performant than what the theme has with Lunr.. Looks good, thanks!. Couple of things I can clear up that might help.\n\ntoc: true method activates some Liquid logic using jekyll-toc that tries to parse out headings and build a TOC. It's by no means perfect and has a few gotchas. Looks like you're hitting one of them or maybe a bug.\nYour test file above is a .html file... which Kramdown won't process. If you're looking for Kramdown to use its auto TOC feature it would need to be .md and the headings written in Markdown. You'd also need to manually include the Kramdown snippet to enable it... {% include toc %} in the body of your content.\n\nI tried to look at your source but doesn't look like https://github.com/troylindsay/troylindsay.github.io/blob/master/_pages/test.md is valid anymore. If you can get a test repo up I can clone and test.\n\nI would try a page with some headings and content, not in a table, and without <a></a> wrapped around them. jekyll-toc might be getting confused.. Did some testing of my own. Doesn't look like jekyll-toc doesn't work correctly HTML.\nhtml\n<h2>Test</h2>\nProduces blank anchors with #. While:\n```markdown\nTest\n```\nProduces #test as expected. Using Kramdown with HTML doesn't seem to work either... heading is omitted from the TOC.\n```html\n{% include toc %}\n\n\n\n\n        Test\n      \n\n\n\n``. OK I know what's going on. Headings need anidattribute so they can be linked to. When you write headings with Markdown Kramdown automatically generates these... (## My Heading ~> id=\"my-heading\"`).\nBecause you're writing HTML this doesn't happen. Therefore you need to manually add unique ID's to each of your headings. The following works for me:\nhtml\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <h2 id=\"test\">\n        Test\n      </h2>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>. You do not need to add the Disqus code snippet to layouts. Configure your site to use it in your _config.yml and enable on the posts you want with comments: true\nConsult the documentation for more info.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#comments. Not sure I follow what you mean by setting up Disqus in \"development mode\".\nIf you're testing your site locally with jekyll serve they won't show unless you set JEKYLL_ENV=production.\nThis is covered in the documentation link I included above. You can also search through the closed issues as I've answered similar questions before.. Thanks for the PR, but I'm not a fan of forcing target=\"_blank\" on the user for all of the reasons cited here: https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/. It\u2019s needed in both locations. Staticman needs it in staticman.yml to configure it. And the theme needs it in_config.yml to enable the recpatcha script in the front end.. My guess is you haven't set Jekyll's environment variable to production. By default it's set to development and the theme only includes analytics tracking for production... much like comments.\nYou'll want to set it to JEKYLL_ENV=production\nref: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#analytics. @pleonova Everything looks correctly configured and setup in the theme and with Jekyll. If you view any page's source on your site you'll see near the bottom the Google Analytics script is being injected.\n```html\n\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');</p>\n<p>ga('create', 'UA-124534051-1', 'auto');\n  ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', false)\n  ga('send', 'pageview');\n\n```\nSomething must be mis-configured in Google Analytics. You'll have to dig into their support documentation as I'm not sure what could be the issue. It doesn't appear to be anything with the theme.. Looks like this CSS doesn't cover all possible combinations of nested list items.\nI was using it to remove the last item's border so there wasn't a thicker one at the bottom, but I think it's safe to remove it all together. Then all list items correctly get a border-bottom..

I\u2019m trying to keep things down to the minimum (hence the theme\u2019s name) and have no interest in merging such PRs :expressionless:.\n\nThe theme ships with the following include that is meant to be used for this exact purpose. If there are author links you feel are unrepresented, then you can override this file in your repo to add them.\n_includes/author-profile-custom-links.html. You're using the wrong layout for your _posts. Even though you have them set as layout: single as front matter defaults in _config.yml, the .md files inside of _posts all have layout: posts... which overrides single.\nOnly the single layout supports comments. Remove layout: posts from the Markdown files and comments will show.\n\n. Sure, if you want to submit a PR with PhotoSwipe as a drop-in replacement for Magnific Popup I'd be happy to look it over.\nThe version of MP the theme ships with is outdated too, so it would be nice to move to something lighter and with better touch support.. Thanks @gezapeti . That's not possible. You can't pull out variables set in a Sass file into HTML.. Just a FYI, this loop has the potential to add some serious time to your Jekyll builds.\nliquid\n{% for image in site.static_files %}\n    {% if image.path contains '/assets/images/headers/' %}\n      <!-- add image -->\n      {% assign header_images = header_images | push: image.path %}\n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\nIf you have a lot of images and or posts, looping through them all in every post is costly.. You might be able to use Jekyll's where or where_exp filters instead of looping through all of site.static_files, to get an array of just the static files with the image.path you want.. Since you're hosting on GitHub Pages follow the \"remote theme\" instructions.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#github-pages-method\nAlso I noticed that in your repo you have everything stashed in a subfolder which may be confusing GitHub. I would move everything out of /minimal-mistakes-master to the root of your repo next to _config.yml.\nYou also don't need _layouts, _includes, _sass, assets/css, etc. These are all bundled with the theme and are copied over on demand when using the theme as a remote theme or Ruby gem. This is another reason why you may be getting the error as it's getting confused trying to find Sass partials that aren't in the path it expects.. Thanks @GwonHyeok . Consult the documentation on how to customize the stylesheet.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/. The author bio simply spits out whatever string you give it inside of a paragraph tag <p></p>:\nhtml\n{% if author.bio %}\n  <p class=\"author__bio\" itemprop=\"description\">\n    {{ author.bio }}\n  </p>\n{% endif %}\nYou could try adding line breaks to the your bio to achieve what you want. For example:\nyaml\nauthor:\n  bio: \"I am an amazing person...<br>sometimes<br>.<br>.<br>or not?\"\nWould give you something like this:\n\n. Thanks for this. Looks good!. I can see the utility of this, but as you mention it breaks the anchor references to tags that might be omitted on the \"tag archive page\".\nThis seems like the perfect use case for doing a local override of the layout if it's something you need.\nThanks for taking the time to submit the PR. I'll give it the enhancement tag so others can potentially find it in the closed issues and use if they'd like.. Doesn't look like there's anything wrong with the theme as Disqus is loading.\n\nYour issue is likely something with a configuration on the Disqus site, or the shortname is incorrect. Or maybe something is up with their service currently as I'm seeing these sorts of errors in the browser's console tab... which are related to their Disqus JavaScript file.\n\nI'd widen your search to Stackoverflow and look for Disqus errors. This isn't a Jekyll or theme issue.\n. Looks good, thanks!. Doesn't work for Kramdown generated toc. That's why you don't see the code in this include.\nSticky sidebars are only supported when using toc: true generated ones.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#table-of-contents. Are you sure you're using the latest version of the theme on master? The demo site has a sample post with a sticky TOC and it is working as intended.\nRef: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_layouts/single.html#L38\n\nSample post\nSource\n\n. The way you've done it is correct, but the way you've written your media query is wrong... it's missing the { } around .sidebar__right\nThat's likely why it's not being included in the stylesheet and you don't see any change on your site. Change it to this and it should work:\ncss\n@media (min-width: 80em) {\n  .sidebar__right {\n      width: 300px;\n      margin-right: -300px;\n      float: right;\n      position: sticky;\n  }\n}. The way you'll go about doing this depends on where you want to sort the posts.\nThere are several layouts that display posts (e.g. posts by tag, posts by category, posts by year, recent posts on homepage, etc.). You'd have to modify the one you want.. Also, you'll probably need to use the sort filter as suggested by this post on SO.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/30274671. Might be a limitation of Jekyll's pagination plugin that doesn't honor sort. You could submit and issue on their repo but not sure if that will get you anywhere as they deprecated the plugin a long time ago.\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate. Have a look at @justinrummel's repo, he's customized the theme to do this if you wanted some ideas.\nhttps://github.com/justinrummel/jr.com-mm. Not likely to add support for this for all of the reasons you've stated, but that shouldn't stop you from doing it in your repo.\nThe theme has support for \"custom comments\". You'd set the following in your _config.yml file:\nyaml\ncomments:\n  provider: custom\nAnd then you'd need to edit this _includes/comments.html and _includes/comments-providers/custom.html to suit your needs.. @nadaa Verify you're building Jekyll in production mode as described in the documentation.\n\nNote: Comments are disabled by default in development. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to set JEKYLL_ENV=production to force the environment to production.\n\nAnd that you have comments: true added to the post's front matter along with all the required Staticman configs in _config.yml. If you're missing something they won't show as a few variables are required.. @nadaa Looks like you didn't add anything for repository... it's required for Staticman to work.\nrepository  : # GitHub username/repo-name e.g. \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\"\ncomments:\n  provider  : \"staticman_v2\"\nstaticman:\n  branch    : \"master\"\n. @nadaa Please open another issue specific to your Staticman problem as it's off topic. This issue is about using GitHub issues as a way to add comments to a Jekyll site.\nThank you.. This is intentional.\nIf you want to override this behavior set classes: wide in your post's front matter like in this example.\nClosing as this is a duplicate of #1373, #1265, #623, #384, #74. You shouldn't be using the gemspec file. That is for development only.\nInstead it should be replaced with a Gemfile and depending on if you're self-hosting or using GitHub Pages you'll either add gem \"jekyll\" or gem \"github-pages\" to it.. Also forking the theme is discouraged. If installed as a ruby gem or using remote_theme the issue with the .gemspec file doesn't exist.. Date is already shown on the post's that use layout: single near the bottom of the page.\n\nIf you want to add it in place of the read time you'll need to hack the theme files around these lines.. @natanrolnik I think this is something that can be overrided as you have versus a config flag. I intentionally left the dates off of that view to avoid the extra clutter.. How you've customized the theme to add this feature looks fine to me.\nNot sure if I'm interested in adding the feature though. I'll leave it marked as under consideration and see if there's any interest in it.. @lthurner Change it's source order. Put it after <div class=\"page__footer\"> and it'll appear above it.\n\n\n. If you want to test locally and host with GitHub Pages, then the preferred method is using remote_theme. You'll also want to setup your Gemfile to use gem \"github-pages\" as it will mimic the same version of Jekyll and plugins they use.\nThere's no reason why you should need to switch between remote_theme and theme. Stick with just remote_theme and keep your Gemfile like this:\n```ruby\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins\n```\nRefer to GitHub's docs on how to set this up if you need further help.\nThere's no reason you'd need to run bundle update other than to update the github-pages gem and it's dependencies. When you use the theme as a remote you don't update the theme as there is no gem to update.\nThe way that works is anytime you build the site it pulls down whatever version of the theme exists on the master branch. So in theory you should always have the latest version when building with nothing to do by you.\nIf you're having issues running bundle exec jekyll serve locally then something is up with your environment and the github-pages gem... not the theme.. rake preview is a development thing. It's used when adding new features and uses the source files in /example to spin up jekyll serve.\nJekyll's Minima theme did it first... that's where I got the idea.\nAnd yes, remote theme will be slightly slower as it has to downloaded the theme every time it builds. There was some discussion about caching between builds, so maybe take a look at that project if you have feedback to add.\nClosing as these concerns are all Jekyll (and it's dependencies) related... nothing specific here to the theme.. You'll probably need to hack the theme if you want to do this. You could add front matter to your posts like:\n```yaml\ntitle: \"Very cool page\"\nsubtitle: \"You're going to love this.\"\npermalink: /cool\n\n```\nAnd then add it to whatever layout you're using with:\nliquid\n{% if page.subtitle %}{{ page.subtitle }}{% endif %}\nA good place for that would be right after the page's title with whatever styling you'd need.. Not sure. Have you reached out to the Susy maintainers as they would know better than me.\nI haven't worked with Susy much recently. The new version from what I remember is less about mixins and \"magic\" and more about math.\nLooking at the error message it's pretty clear... it's expecting a number and you're giving it a string.. Again, probably a better idea to file an issue on Susy's repo. The maintainers there would know more than me as they built it.. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/. Yes it's possible. Remove index.html or index.md in the root of your repo. Move your about page .md file to the root, rename it to index.md and it will become your home page.. This isn't a feature of the theme, it is a basic feature of Jekyll. It converts Markdown files into .html files. If you want a home page it needs to be named index.md or index.html and be in the root.\nOr you can add something like permalink: / if you'd prefer to keep your pages in _pages/about.md. Read up on how Jekyll's permalink feature works to learn more about overriding them.. You have a public repo? I can only guess what you may have setup incorrectly and how to fix it.\nRE: the second option, you got some of that wrong. I was guessing your About page was something like _pages/about.md. Which if that was the case you'd set it's permalink to permalink: /.\npermanentlink: /_pages/about.md would have no affect as it isn't even close to something Jekyll uses. All permalink does is change the output path of the .html file. It's useful if you store your \"page\" files in different folders and want them to output elsewhere.\nRE: the layout. You want to use layout: single if you're trying to make your about page the home. Using layout: home gives you the recent posts layout, which isn't what you want. layout: archive also won't give you what you want.\nWhatever is wrong, it's something straightforward and easy to fix, but I need to see your files to have any clue what's going on.. Thanks as always!. Nope not possible. This is a Jekyll thing which the theme has no control over. tags and categories are part of the the entire site object.. That's because there is no configuration for Google Plus comments. You either enable it or not. Unlike the other options there are no configs needed.\nprovider: google-plus. If you open up /_includes/page__hero.html there's this line:\nhtml\n<p class=\"page__lead\">{{ page.excerpt | markdownify | remove: \"<p>\" | remove: \"</p>\" }}</p>\nWhat's going on is page.excerpt is inserted inside of a paragraph tag and Kramdown is interpreting the line breaks as new paragraphs... which are then removed with the two filters.\nSo what you can do is change that wrapping <p class=\"page__lead\">...</p> to maybe <div class=\"page__lead\">...</div> and take out the | remove: \"<p>\" | remove: \"</p>\" filters.\nA simpler way would be to do what I did with the doc site's splash page and use <br>s to force breaks. \nexcerpt: |\n  We do **complete property services** \n  <br>\n  from design to installation and maintenance\n  <br>\n  including beautiful landscapes and water features. Yeah I noticed your +, I took it out in my code above. excerpt: > also seems to work instead of the pipe.. See https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1746. This is a difficult one as GitHub Pages doesn't support any of the i18n Jekyll plugins.\nThere's an old issue somewhere that I mentioned I wouldn't consider this until Jekyll natively supports i18n. Localizing the text is easy enough (which the theme already does), but doing the dates is tricky because formats vary between locales as does all of the translations.\nThe common approach is to build a whole mess of Liquid code that can output localized months, days of week, etc. But that's a level of complexity I want to stay far away from.\nSee related: #917, #612, #50. Closing as this has been covered in those other issues.. Also if i18n is important to you, might be worth chiming in on the Jekyll 4.0 discussion, as others have proposed it being built into the core. ref: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6948\nThere's also a proposal for a localized date filter which I believe would suit your needs. ref: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5478. I think you're using an older version of the theme. Looking at your Gemfile.lock it says 4.2.1 which is quite old.\nThat's likely the version Netlify is installing and since it's pre-skins that's why you don't see it.\nYou'll need to run bundle update locally to update, then commit the update Gemfile.lock and push that up.. Also looking at blog.natanrolnik.me's source there is no theme version in there. Which tells me you're using a much older version.\nbundle update will likely be all you need to do. Refer to the upgrade docs if you need more info.. You're missing configs. In addition to staticman.yml there are several variables that need to be set in _config.yml as well.\nYou're missing comments.provider and some other Staticman fields. Have a look the demo site's config to compare again and figure out what you're missing. A lot these under staticman are for v1 and if you're using staticman.yml they're configured there instead. But branch and any reCaptcha stuff needs to be in _config.yml.\nBut you're not even seeing the form, which is due to not setting a provider.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_config.yml\ncomments:\n  provider               : \"staticman_v2\"\nstaticman:\n  allowedFields          : # ['name', 'email', 'url', 'message']\n  branch                 : \"master\"\n  commitMessage          : # \"New comment\"\n  filename               : # comment-{@timestamp}\n  format                 : # \"yml\"\n  moderation             : # true\n  path                   : # \"_data/comments/{options.slug}\"\n  requiredFields         : # ['name', 'email', 'message']\n  transforms:\n    email                : # \"md5\"\n  generatedFields:\n    date:\n      type               : # \"date\"\n      options:\n        format           : # \"iso8601\" (default), \"timestamp-seconds\", \"timestamp-milliseconds\"\nreCaptcha:\n  siteKey                : \nsecret                   :. Comments were designed to only work with layout: single. If you want a wide variant of that add classes: wide to the front matter as well.\nSee this demo post for an example.. Gemfile is needed. I guess the docs could be more descriptive and explain that the Gemfile in the root of the project needs to be updated as  in it's current state it's for development only.\nThis section is where I explain that. I think the only issue is when people fork the theme. They really shouldn't be starting with the root files as they're incomplete and configured for building the theme gem. A better start is the files in /docs.. I think you're missing the portfolio collection archive page. See this example.. To @hkalant's point. There are a ton of free services that will let you build a contact form, that you just need to embed on a page. \nClosing this issue as you can simply use any page with layout: single and said form embed code.. Upgrade. \nThe version of the theme you're using is a few years old. The latest version doesn't have this issue.. The workaround is to upgrade. Like I mentioned, I fixed these issues when I rebuilt the theme.\nOnly other option if you don't want to upgrade is sift through the CSS of they last version and see if you can backport anything.. Thanks for this.\nsite.read_time isn't a thing and was added in error. To put this in-line with _includes/archive-single.html you can go with just:\n{% if page.read_time %}\n  ...\n{% endif %}\nAnd remove site.page_read_time or. https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_navigation.scss#L494. Duplicate of #949.\nSee that issue for a path forward.. Don't think your issue is related to the theme or configuring Staticman.\nYou sure you properly autheticated Staticman with GitHub? From that error it looks like it's having issues writing the data file to your repo.\nSee Step 1 on the Staticman docs.\nOther than this I don't really have any other advice. Maybe file an issue on Staticman's repo. They might be able to clarify that error since it appears to be originating from Staticman.. Possibly related:\n- https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/202\n- https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/140. Your repo on GitHub. Check the pull requests. You need to merge them in to approve comments.. You need to build the category page. Jekyll or the theme won't do this for you automatically.\nThe docs explain this. Here's an example categories page you'll need to add to your repo.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/category-archive.md\nClosing as this is a duplicate of #974. Closing as this is a duplicate of several other issues like #1676 \nAdditional sidebar links can be added using /includes/author-profile-custom-links.html or creating your own layout overrides as per the docs.. 2a looks fine to me if you want to go ahead and submit a pull request.\nI tested it locally and all you'd need to do is:\n\nReplace this line in assets/js/_main.js with:\n\njavascript\n// Bind the hashchange event listener\n  $(window).bind(\"hashchange\", function(event) {\n    $.smoothScroll({\n      // Replace '#/' with '#' to go to the correct target\n      scrollTarget: location.hash.replace(/^\\#\\/?/, \"#\"),\n      offset: -20\n    });\n  });\n  $('a[href*=\"#\"]').bind(\"click\", function(event) {\n    // Remove '#' from the hash.\n    var hash = this.hash.replace(/^#/, \"\");\n    if (this.pathname === location.pathname && hash) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n      // Change '#' (removed above) to '#/' so it doesn't jump without the smooth scrolling\n      location.hash = \"#/\" + hash;\n    }\n  });\n  // Trigger hashchange event on page load if there is a hash in the URL.\n  if (location.hash) {\n    $(window).trigger(\"hashchange\");\n  }\n\nRebuild assets/js/main.js by running npm run build:js from root\nCommit the changed _main.js and main.js files and push up.. Don\u2019t think that can be done easily without over complicating the theme.\nSince the JS is precompiled in the theme there is no way to hook a site variable in there to do some sort of Liquid logic to not include the smooth scrolling stuff.\n\nI guess it could be pulled out into its own script file and then conditionally loaded via some config flag, but that seems unnecessarily complicated.. Thanks @loicgasser . With CSS. You'll have to add something like margin: auto and display: block to .author__avatar img in _sass/minimal-mistakes/_sidebar.scss.\ncss\n.author__avatar img {\n    margin: auto;\n    display: block;\n}. Thanks!. Yes, that's how you'd do it.\nYou could also try and use the archive layout which has the {{ content }} tag placed in the appropriate location.\nThe home layout is very similar to it, just simplified to omit some things.. No obvious reason why {{ content }} isn't in the home layout. Just a miss on my part.\nHappy to look at a pull request if you want to add it.. As per the documentation, you haven't completely filled out all the required fields in _config.yml.\nLook's like you're missing repository.. Not sure, I don't really know the inner workings of Staticman.\nThere's really only two possibilities I can think of.\n1. You're still missing some configs or they don't match what Staticman expects. Could be in _config.yml or staticman.yml. When you see missing required fields it means there are ones marked required in the config but the form isn't passing data for them on submit.\n2. Staticman could be down.. And hitting the API link directly will give that error. Trying that with the MM demo site does the same error.. Path of the comment data is wrong. That's why it's not showing up.\nIt should be in a subfolder that matches the page slug it goes with. That's how they're associated and pulled in to the appropriate post or page.\nNot sure why it's not working for you. It works on the demo site. Only other thing I can suggest is compare against that to see what is off with your repo. I'm fairly certain it's a bad config.. Re: comment files. You should have something like this. Your repo is dumping all of the comment .yml files directly into /comments.. Not sure, but whatever is going on the logic in the comment form that should add in the relevant value for page.slug isn't working.\nYou can confirm that by looking at the hidden input field named options[slug]. The value is blank when it should be \"feedback\", which instructs Staticman where to place the data file.\n\nThe logic in the theme is correct, but perhaps because you're setting a permalink in the page Jekyll doesn't render page.slug correctly. \nTo be honest I've never tried comments on anything other than _posts... and even then I've never tried to override their permalinks. That could be the other difference. I've never tried this with a page, just _posts.. Looks good. Thanks!. Depends. If it's something I think adds value and doesn't complicate or clutter the theme I'd consider it.\nAt first blush I'm thinking it's something best left as a customization you do. But feel free to change my mind ;-)\nSince it's a jQuery plugin you should be able to modify the theme's JavaScript to bundle it in.. Thanks!. You have a published version somewhere I can look at to see if it's a simple CSS fix or not.\nGetting the nested lists to indent properly is tricky and causes all sorts of layout issues past a level or two. That's partially why I limited it. That and the space is so narrow that after a few indents you get text that normally fit on one line is broken up into 3 or more lines... which looks ridiculous.. Adding a few more lines of CSS seems like it could fix the indents. \n\nI added these lines and seems to do the trick. Could you link me to the Markdown source for this page? I'd like to add it as a test so I can tweak the indents better and make sure the new styles don't break anything.\n```css\n.toc__menu li ul li ul > li a {\n  padding-left: 2.5rem;\n}\n.toc__menu li ul li ul li ul > li a {\n  padding-left: 3rem;\n}\n.toc__menu li ul li ul li ul li ul > li a {\n  padding-left: 3.5rem;\n}\n``. Thanks @allejo, this is helpful.. Merged in enhancements to support nested TOC levels 1-6 on themaster` branch.\nAn example can be seen here. \nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout-table-of-contents-indent-post/. It could absolutely be updated.\nI use something like the following in my other theme's which cuts down on some of the Liquid spaghetti code currently in MM.\nliquid\n{%- for link in site.data.navigation.main -%}\n  {%- if link.url contains '://' -%}\n    {%- assign url = link.url -%}\n  {%- else -%}\n    {%- assign url = link.url | relative_url -%}\n  {%- endif -%}\n  <li><!-- anchor stuff --></li>\n{%- endfor -%}\nHappy to look at a pull request if anyone wants to take a stab at cleaning up_includes/masthead.html.. Looks good, thanks @olbat . Is there any way to make the URLs that appears in the browser bar match the ones on the page?\nWhen testing this fix on the /test site content and a page with a table of contents. All of the URL's there are /#hash. When clicking on them the URL bar changes to /#/hash. And if you share those URLs they don't scroll down to the appropriate location.\nWhere as /#hash does.\n\n. They scroll for me when clicking fine. What I'm concerned about is if those links get indexed or shared and someone clicks on it from an external source or different page, then it doesn't load at the proper heading. It just starts at the top of the page.\nI'll take a look at the script and see if I can alter the regex to keep /#hash instead of replacing it with /#/hash.. /#/hash doesn't work when JavaScript is disabled.\n/#hash does work when JavaScript is disabled because it's a valid anchor due to the headline elements having id=\"hash\" attributes.. Digging into this further on jQuery Smooth Scroll GH issues, seems like there are legit reasons to doing /#/hash.\nI'd be fine with that solution, but I still don't like that they won't work if JS is disabled. Which is probably rare these days, but still. I also don't like how there's a mixture of different path types. In the raw HTML you get /#hash, but those who might click a hash link and then copy/paste from the address bar will get /#/hash. That seems messy to me.\nStill digging around to see if there are other options. Some of the solutions I've found mention using jQuery BBQ, but I'd like to avoid throwing even more JavaScript at the problem.. Every browser renders scrollbars differently, I'd prefer not to customize them.\nIn fact on touch devices you don't even see a scrollbar, and it's only show when left sidebar content is taller than the page.\nIn cases where it's short, no scrollbar is shown.\n. Have a look at the splash layout. It is more visually appealing. It is what I'm using to build the demo site's homepage (source).\nThere is also a grid view in _includes/archive-single.html for spitting out posts in a grid format versus the list one. An example of this can be seen on the /portfolio page.\nBy combining these methods you can get something more dynamic and tailored to your needs.. Here's the relevant code. \nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/archive-single.html#L36. It should use it. How are you using the theme? Ruby gem or remote theme?. Is the repo public? \nCould be any number of things. Caching, using Ruby gem and remote theme at the same time, not pushing content to force a GH Pages rebuild, etc etc etc.. If you're using GitHub Pages then you need to use it as a remote_theme as they don't support 3rd party gems. So you can remove the MM gem from Gemfile and the theme: line from _config.yml\nWhen you say you \"push it to github\"? Are you pushing the source files (posts' Markdown, includes, etc) or are you pushing the contents of _site to GitHub?\nOverriding _includes and _layouts does work, but sounds like to me you have things setup incorrectly. If you can link to a public repo I can let you know pretty quick what's the problem. Right now I'm just guessing.. Here's your problem:\n\nYou need to commit and push _includes/archive__single.html up to GitHub. It doesn't exist in your repo therefore there's nothing to override the one bundled in the theme.. Not exactly sure since I can only test what I see in your actual repo on GH.\nBut seeing how you have all sorts of other layouts and includes that don't apply to the theme, or the fact that you have both the Ruby gem and remote theme versions installed at the same time... you aren't doing Jekyll any favors. Wires could be getting crossed somewhere.. Something must up with your environment.

Closing as this is a duplicate of several other issues like #1676 \n\nAdditional sidebar links can be added using /includes/author-profile-custom-links.html or creating your own layout overrides as per the docs.. It's not working because your paths are wrong. I don't know if Jekyll's docs have examples, but I'm pretty sure the path's are relative to root folder.\nTo make this work, try these paths instead.. you need to add _pages/ before the folder names you're currently using.\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path: _pages/intro\n      type: pages\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      classes: wide\n      sidebar:\n        nav: \"intro\" \n  - scope:\n      path: _pages/core\n      type: pages\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      classes: wide\n      sidebar:\n        nav: \"core\". It\u2019s not the theme. Jekyll\u2019s sitemap plug-in doesn\u2019t like something. If you check through the stack trace above it\u2019s throwing errors when it tries to build sitemap.xml\nNot sure why it\u2019s having problems with your collections. I have several test collections setup in the theme\u2019s demo site and it compiles fine.\n. I think your problem is this line in your config.\nI\u2019ve never used collection_dir but I\u2019m pretty sure it shouldn\u2019t be indented under the collections key. Try this instead.\nyaml\ncollections_dir: class_collections\ncollections:\n  is501:\n    output: false\n    permalink: /:collection/:path/\n  is452:\n    output: false\n    permalink: /:collection/:path/\n  is490db:\n    output: false\n    permalink: /:collection/:path/\n  phil103:\n    output: false\n    permalink: /:collection/:path/\nIf that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019d suggest searching through jekyll/jekyll\u2019s issues. I\u2019ve seen problems with the new collection directory feature before. I\u2019m not familiar with it enough to provide help. It\u2019s definitely a core issue and not related to the theme.. If you're hosting with GitHub Pages your options are limited with regards to category and tag pages. You can absolutely add those to your posts, but Jekyll won't be able to automatically create archive pages for those taxonomies (note: categories/tags only work with _posts and not collections).\nThere are plugins that do that, but they're not supported on GitHub Pages. So either you move to a service like Netlify to build/host your site, or you do what the theme's demo pages does and use the category and tag layouts.\nSee the documentation for more info.\n\nArchive settings\nTaxonomy archives. You'll likely need to throw away the greedy nav CSS and replace it with styles that match a dropdown nav pattern.\n\nHave you looked through sites like Codepen or just Googling around? There are so many dropdown examples out there it shouldn't be too hard to adapt. You've done the hard part of getting the HTML to render, it just needs to be styled now.. One area for improvement would be for smaller screens. If you reduce the width of the browser window to hide a dropdown item, it doesn't work as expected. It's child links are missing on hover or click.\n\n. Don't know of anything that will easily fix it. That's part of the reason why I didn't mix dropdowns in with the greedy navigation pattern. It can get complicated really fast.. Have a look through the demo site's source. There are examples of these and much more.\n\nDemo\n\nSource for demos. You'll need to hack the theme to do that. Have a look at these pages to see how it's currently built.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_layouts/home.html#L9-L11\n\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/archive-single.html\n\nIf you use feature_row instead of archive-single.html inside of the for loop, with some clever uses of include parameters and assign, you can probably getting it working.. Closing as this isn't related to the theme as @flohw noted above and is Jekyll core / plugin territory.. Don't think it's the theme, this feels like something with your Ruby environment. I've seen it before but don't know the fix.\nHave you tried searching the closed issues on jekyll/jekyll?. Thanks @claudiuconstantin . It\u2019s documented here.\nYou need to add a tag and category page using the specified layouts. There are links in the docs to copy the Markdown needed to make these pages.\nAlso the entire source for the MM demo site is in /docs folder if you need to see how I\u2019m doing things.. They don\u2019t need to be in the root. Some people use a _pages folder with custom permalinks set. That\u2019s why I left it intentionally vague as those pages can be setup in multiple ways depending on how you like to organize things.. The theme has no such shortcut.\nYou'll need to install a plugin similar to this https://gist.github.com/23maverick23/8532525. Yeah I get that. Unfortunately that is out of control for the theme. This is more of an addon/plugin than anything the theme can be concerned with. It can probably be done with Jekyll includes which would be supported with GH Pages.\nYou could also look into Netlify. They will build your Jekyll site similar to GitHub Pages for free and they also support plugins.. Closing as this is something that can be added outside of the theme.\nIf someone builds an include to do this, it woudn't need to be merged in this project and could be its own thing.. Looks like Prettier mangled some of the Sass used to make the toggle work. I've corrected that and it should be fixed on master.. As far as I can tell there's some JavaScript screwing with links, e.g. <a></a> elements.\nIt's more noticeable in Firefox where the :hover animation triggers for a second then gets interrupted. You can see it on plain text links too.\n\nChecking the web inspector and all <a> elements have a click event added to them as part of the smoothScroll script. I'm not entirely sure why it's messing with the hover state or how to fix it, but this looks to be the issue.\nIf there's any JavaScript mavens out there that want to take a stab PR's are welcome.. Scratch that. Disabling JavaScript and the issue is still there. Must be some quirk in the CSS I'm not immediately noticing.. Figured it out and this will likely come down to preferance.\nThe theme is styling plain text links with a :visited state as slightly darker to indicated you've already visited them.\nThe button's follow the same logic only the color I used for the :visited state is the same as the :active one. So that's why you don't see a hover change because you've already visited google.com. Change that link to a page you've never been to and you'll see the hover.. Also adding the :hover styles after :visited fixes the issue, which I'll be pushing in a minute.. The gallery helper doesn't support this. It has some internal logic to apply the half class when there are 2 images, and the third class when 3 or more.\nThis is done for styling purposes to maintain a pleasing grid. On smaller screens the half and third classes default to a single column, similar to what you're asking for. If you wanted to override this you could add CSS to force .half and .third to stay as single columns.\nNot something I'd want to change for the theme, so you'll have to manage that in your own repo.. You could also create your own copy of /_includes/gallery and rip out the logic that applies the .half and .third classes.\nConsult the Jekyll docs on how to override theme defaults.. Remove the curly braces in your second line. You just need the variables name when inside of the assign.\n{% assign gallery_layout = page.gallery_layout %}. Feel free to fork and port over to Hugo. A couple of my other theme's I believe have been ported. \nYou might want to search GitHub as I've gotten a couple of inquires like yours. It's possible others have already started converting MM to Hugo.. https://github.com/mikeymop/minimal-mistakes-hugo. Closing due to this being Hugo related. If you do find a suitable port feel free to leave a link so others can find it.. There could be, but that's a question for the maintainers of the remote theme plugin. I believe I saw they were working on caching the theme files so it didn't need to be pulled down every build, but not 100% on that.\nClosing as this is something that will need to be handled upstream.. Closing as this is a duplicate of several other issues and PRs like #1676 \nAdditional sidebar links can be added using /includes/author-profile-custom-links.html or creating your own layout overrides as per the docs.. There's this old issue #101 that's similar to your ask.\nAny modern browser can handle <audio> and <video> elements. At a basic level you can simply add them to your Markdown or HTML files and the browser will render them with player controls. There's nothing special the theme has to do.\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nI've heard of Octopod, but haven't used it or looked at its source. I don't podcast nor am I building a podcast theme so the need has never been there.. There was a bug in the hero include that wasn't correctly applying the relative_url filter to the link. Should be fixed now.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/page__hero.html#L56-L64. Check out my blog post to get an overview on how Staticman comments.\nYou can come up with whatever folder structure you want with regards to the comment data files. I decided on subfolders that match the post filename so they can be easily matched.\nYou can see how that works here.\nSo yes. If you change the post name slug after having comments on that post, they won't show up unless you rename the _data/subfolder to match it. \nIf all of your posts had some sort of unique identifier that never changed it wouldn't be as fragile, but currently Jekyll doesn't have that.. That is correct.. Yes, please submit a PR to remove them. Thanks for bringing it up.. Not without some custom CSS.. The theme does not use Bootstrap nor does it have styling for 4 columns.\nYou'll need to add custom CSS to do it using media queries. I would take the mobile first approach and style them as a single column, then as screen widths increase go to 2 columns, then 4.\nTake a look at the .half and .third classes to see how that might work.. If you want 4 columns on mobile too you can remove the media query mixin. That will apply the 25% widths at all screen sizes.\n```scss\n&.fourth {\n\na,\nimg {\n    width: calc(25% - 0.5em);\n  }\n\nfigcaption {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n```\nThough I doubt it'll look good on mobile, 4 columns are going to be squeezed really small and your content will likely suffer it.. Thanks for bringing it up. Not sure on the best path forward.\nI guess anyone who relies on the public instance probably needs a backup plan. Kind of comes with the territory when using \"free\" stuff.. Yeah I'd be cool with that. Could probably do something like {{ site.staticman.endpoint | default: 'https://api.staticman.net/v2/entry/' }} to fallback to the public instance if one isn't specified in _config.yml.. Strange. As per Staticman's docs they're needed in its staticman.yml config.\nhttps://staticman.net/docs/configuration. Looks like you've hardcoded the reCaptcha values directly into the comments include. So it's not coming from _config.yml at all. Guessing there's more of that since your repo appears to be modified in a few places.\nI'd be curious to hear what other's experiences are with configuring Staticman v2 with reCaptcha and if it deviates from what's in the docs.. Not sure. This is definitely not a theme issue though. Have you filed it on jekyll/jekyll?. File an issue with jekyll/jekyll and maybe post a thread to their help forum.\nI've never tried to use subfolders in a _pages folder as you have, nor have I ever tried to use :title to autogenerate permalinks similar to what's available for _posts.\nSomething tells me it just doesn't work that way out of the box, but I could be wrong.. Sounds good.\nIn the grand scheme of things it probably doesn't matter. What you have was a good approach since it follows the other comment providers. If there wasn't already site,staticman your approach makes the most sense.. No didn't get a notification. But I see it now.. url is the rendered path... e.g. the actual URL of the post after Jekyll builds the site.\nYou're using the path to the source file which is why those links are coming up as 404. If you look at the demo site and check out the URL of the first post https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/post/post-future-date/ you'd set url like this:\nurl: /post/post-future-date/\nBasically you're using everything except the protocol and domain (and possibly baseurl if you have that set). You could set the entire URL to the absolute path, but that will break things when previewing locally.\nurl: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/post/post-future-date/. If you need a real world example, here's what I'm using to build the side nav in the documentation section of the theme's site.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_data/navigation.yml#L35. Yes that is your issue. Jekyll isn't building that page. \nJekyll typically ignores folders and files that begin with an underscore. Rename _posts/_MachineLearning to _posts/MachineLearning. It's not working because Jekyll expects _posts to have their filenames in a specific way e.g. YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md.\nIf dating these pages doesn't make sense for your site then I'd suggest moving them out of the _posts folder and create a collection. Or if they aren't related make them as stand alone pages.\nClosing as this isn't a theme issue. If you need further help use one of these resources, https://jekyllrb.com/docs/community/#where-to-get-support. Don't know if this could be done gracefully. The right sidebar is a huge hack right now because it supports Markdown auto TOCs and a Liquid helper that creates the TOC.\nThe placement of the HTML is more flexible with the Liquid helper method, but styling it in a way to not break Kramdown TOCs is challenging.\nI prefer the pattern of not sticking the TOC and having it scroll with the content. For documentation heavy sites the left nav sidebar is a better place for adding waypoints.\nI'm willing to bet most people ignore the sidebar anyways. There's likely few people who are going to be bouncing around multiple headings on a single page. Sticky sidebars and \"back to top\" links are things people like to add to their site just because they can. \nBut I don't think they add value to most users, other than clutter up the page more.. Link2 is super buggy for me. There's all sorts of screen flashes and inconsistencies with how the page scrolls, don't think that's a particularly good solution.\nAs far as right sidebars that get cutoff. This is one of the reasons I was hesitant to add a sticky behavior. If your body content is shorter than the height of the table of contents, it's going to extend beyond the viewport.\nEither turn off the stickiness or limit what headlines are used to make it shorter.. You have a public/test repo that illustrates this bug?\nI just modified the /test repo the theme has and changed paginate_path: /page/:num/ and everything works as expected.\n\n. Theme isn't compatible with that plugin yet. The pagination links need to\nbe rebuilt for it.\nClosing as this is a duplicate of what is already summarized in #1307.\nOn Fri, Sep 28, 2018 at 8:56 PM jaybe@jekyll notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI should have mentioned the additional changes of adding gem\njekyll-paginate-v2 and its base configuration within _config.yml.\njekyll-paginate-v2 advised to unset paginate: or set to off.

Your custom layouts are the problem. You'll need to use Jekyll's relative_url filter on your {{ post.url }} statements. This will append your baseurl properly.\nTake a look at the theme's archive-single.html include for an example of how to apply the filter.. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#feature-row\nYou'll use type=\"center\"\nHere's the sourcecode for some examples\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs//_pages/splash-page.md. You'll need to customize the CSS then. This isn't something supported by the theme.. Add posts. It's not showing anything because you don't have any posts.\nThere are test posts in /test/_posts if you want to copy them.. The demo site's source is in /docs folder. You can find how I do everything there... hint the home page is using layout: splash. You'll probably want to look over the the documentation completely as there's a lot in there with examples.\nIf you want thumbnails in the post lists you'll need to use the grid layout or hack something else. Search through the closed issues, I've covered it a few times.. That's in there for accessibility reasons I believe, :focus on the close button. I didn't build that library so can't fully say, but that's my take on it.\nIt can be styled away if desired:\ncss\n.mfp-close:focus {\n  outline: none;\n}. That's correct. The stylesheet is global. There is no way to modify styles (fonts, colors, whatever) for a specific post or page.\nYou can do something like add internal/inline styles directly in the post file if you're so inclined.. Closing as the theme allows you add any link/icon to the author sidebar and footer via author.links and footer.links in _config.yml\nCheck the docs for more info and examples.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-author\n. Those are deperecated and will eventually be removed.. Not sure. You'll want to file an issue with jekyll-remote-theme. They'll be of more help than me since it concerns their plugin.. > @mmistakes cannot know your specific use case and build a wonder machine that write and activates/deactivates things on your behalf miraculously understanding the context on which the theme has been used.\n:+1: \nI believe the theme provides the mechanisms to make your site GDPR compliant. There are enough cookie consent generators out there that will guide you through the process and give you some JS/CSS you can embed to your page. I'm really not interested in taking a stab at my own as it will never meet the needs of everyone.\nBest advice I can offer is:\n\nUse something like Cookie Consent.\nConfigure your cookie consent.\nCopy/paste the code they provide into _includes/footer/custom.html (create if you're using remote_theme or Ruby gem to override the default).\nCreate a Privacy Policy page and give it layout: single, here's a sample .md file the demo site uses.\nAdd a footer link to your privacy policy page.. @maxime-michel I'd be on board if someone wanted to submit a PR to do both of these.. This is already possible.\n\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout-sidebar-custom/. Forgot to include this:\nyaml\nsidebar:\n  - text: \"[![your logo](/assets/images/logo.png)](http://home.page.org)\"\n  - title: \"Some Optional Title\"\n    text: \"Some optional text here.\". It's just a warning that you can't use theme: in your _config.yml for 3rd party themes like MM.\nRemove that line and only use remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\". Yes and no. The theme uses Jekyll's site.related_posts array which under the right circumstances enables related posts.\n\nIf the page being processed is a Post, this contains a list of up to ten related Posts. By default, these are the ten most recent posts. For high quality but slow to compute results, run the jekyll command with the --lsi (latent semantic indexing) option. Also note GitHub Pages does not support the lsi option when generating sites. \nref: jekyll docs\n\nI've also flirted with using Liquid to generate related posts based on their tags. This is 100% GitHub Pages compatible, but it negatively impacts build times considerably so I didn't merge it in. If you're curious what that change entails take a look at #978.. Yes. They were considerably longer, especially for large sites.\nThe fixes are:\n1. don't host with GH and use a provider that allows you to enable LSI\n2. Use my \"related posts by tag\" Liquid code in that unmerged pull request . Not sure on the difference in font you're seeing between the demo. The font family set uses \"system fonts\" so depending on the environment you're looking at it will change as macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, etc. all use different system fonts.\nAs for bumping up the font-size. Do a search through the closed issues. I've covered how to change them too many times to count.. Closing as this is a duplicate of #1352, #1219, and #1184.. The teaser field in _config.yml doesn't have anything to do with setting images in the posts or in archive listings. You'll need to customize the theme to do this.\nSee this issue #1717 for ideas and code.\nClosing as this is a duplicate of that issue.. @bradvolen Thanks for pointing this out. I've added notes to the theme's documentation about it.\nWhile GitHub Pages supports this plugin it looks like it's not turned on by default because it has the potentially to be used incorrectly. I guess this is why you need to manually add it to the plugins array of _config.yml. Head can't because it contains jekyll-seo-tag which pulls from the page object to populate all the SEO stuff. Using include_cached would break that.\nhead/custom.html might be OK, but I left it off of that as I have no idea what someone might be using it for. If they have page.whatever variables in there it would break.\nPretty much the only thing you can use {% include_cached %} for is if it's straight HTML or Markdown. Or only uses site.whatever variables.. You haven't done anything wrong. The theme now uses the jekyll-include-cache plugin. And while it is supported by GitHub Pages, they don't enabled it by default. You need to opt in and add it to the plugins array of your _config.yml.\nyaml\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-sitemap\n  - jekyll-gist\n  - jekyll-feed\n  - jemoji\n  - jekyll-include-cache. @RichStone check the CHANGELOG. Any updates made to the theme are noted there.\nWhat I would suggest to avoid future disruptions is you lock the theme to current released version, and upgrade when you want to. This will avoid you pulling down features that may not be backwards compatible with your content.\nIf you're using the theme as a Ruby gem you'd add the version to your Gemfile like this:\nruby\ngem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", \"4.13.0\"\nAnd if you're using it as a remote theme you can lock it like this in your _config.yml:\n``yaml\nremote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.13.0\". @bjwo And you're running Jekyll withbundle exec jekyll build` correct?\nDo you have a public repo I can look at? If you have the include cache plugin in your Gemfile and it's under plugins in _config.yml then it should work.. @bjwo If you have a public repo I can try and build your site and see if I get the same error. If I don't then it's definitely your Ruby environment.\nYou'd be surprised how often it's something silly that I can easily spot if I can see your actual code in the repo... that's why I asked.. This is a layer of complexity I'm not comfortable adding into the core theme. The build times would take a performance hit to do it since it would have to evaluate the current page to apply an \"active\" state to the menu item.\nIf you search around there are some blog posts/tutorials that discuss how to do it. Essentially you add some Liquid logic to check the current page.url, and if it matches the URL in the menu item apply a class=\"active\"... which would then need the appropriate CSS to style it with the underline.. I don't have much to add that I haven't already said numerous times before.\nTo start, stay away from the feature row include. That's used for purely static content that you don't mean to loop through (unless you want to hack it up to support that).\nInstead use /_includes/archive-single.html\nIt has a type parameter that you can pass to output either a list view or grid view (the default is list). If you start digging into the various archive layouts I provide you'll see I start a for loop and then include archive-single.html... which is similar to the HTML you pasted above.\nNot sure what your issue is with pagination, but if I had to guess it's related to the for loop you're using. Jekyll has site.posts which holds all the post data. Then there is paginator.posts which is used by jekyll-paginate.\nYou probably changed {% for post in paginator.posts %} to {% for post in site.posts %} and that killed your pagination.. And the only real difference between splash and archive or single is it kills the left column. There's some other things that aren't included, but that's about it.\nIt's meant more for a landing page that you don't plan to have an author side bar, table of contents, or any of the other stuff the theme offers.. :man_shrugging: \nHave a search through the closed issues. Pagination issues come up often enough there should be some gold in there. It's almost always a configuration problem or misunderstanding on how Jekyll's pagination needs to be setup. Hint... it's extremely picky.. Try paginator.posts instead of site.paginator. Autocorrect spat out the wrong thing in my previous comment.. I did a quick search and there are a lot of issues similar to this. Looks like GitLab doesn't set the correct mime types for whatever reason when it serves these files. Not sure what the fix is as I don't use GitLab.. Figured as much. This seems to be a server issue which I guess GitLab needs to address.. Duplicate of #1875. See that issue for the fix.. I'd suggest StackOverflow or searching through FontAwesome's issues to see if others have been able to do this. Their older versions you could just as you have above, but maybe that's changed with the new JavaScript version.. Also the way FontAwesome works now isn't by using a webfont. It's inject the icons as inline SVGs via their JavaScript method.\nCheck their documentation, as it's possible but you need to do things slightly different from what you have above.\nhttps://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/css-pseudo-elements. https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/scripts.html#L12. Yes, using the free one. It's showing up as a square because the font isn't loading. As mentioned above the version of FontAwesome the theme is using isn't a webfont anymore.\nIt's using JavaScript to inject SVG icons instead. So adding content to psuedo elements isn't going to work. The link above has a solution where you need to enable pseudo elements in the script.\n\nGotta enable this with SVG\nIf you are using SVG with JavaScript you need to enable this because it's disabled by default. Use <script data-search-pseudo-elements ... > inside your script tag. \n\nWhich means you probably have to do something like this in _includes/scripts.html\n<script src=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.3.1/js/all.js\" data-search-pseudo-elements></script>\nAnd then follow all their other directions for the CSS: https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/css-pseudo-elements. You're in StatckOverflow territory now since this is general web dev stuff. I'd suggest expanding your search there.. Please have a look through the closed issues before filing a new one.\nThere are notes about this at the top of the README and in several locations of the documentation.\n\nClosing as this is a duplicate of #1875, #1879\n. My memory is hazy on this. I think it was hacked up some and probably not a drop-in replacement when upgrading, but I could be wrong and the custom stuff is coming in the stemmers.\n@nickgarlis did all of the work and is more qualified to answer this question than me.. Sounds good. For my other theme I used an off the shelf cut of Lunr with these language addons. Could go that route if necessary.\nI think all the custom stuff came in the lunr-en.js and lunr-gr.js. So unless there were some big API changes from 2.15 we should be safe just updating lunr.js and lunr-min.js to the latest version.. Sounds good. Thanks!. Probably not going to modify Liquid or introduce a new function there that would make its way to Jekyll anytime soon :wink:\nBut I think your proposal is probably the best option give what's available to us. Care to submit a pull request removing strip_newlines and using carefully constructed replaces to get around the merged words?. Looks good. Thanks @bmcgough . Looks good. Thanks @justinrummel . Thanks for the PR!. Not with the theme. You need some sort of Jekyll plugin or feature in Kramdown to do that.\nClosing as this is something core Jekyll (or a plugin) would need to do.. What\u2019s the site\u2019s URL? Can\u2019t really give suggestions based off of a screenshot.. You'll probably have to look into a different way of making the sidebar sticky. If you inspect <div class=\"sidebar sticky\"> you'll see it has a height of 400px... that's why it has a scrollbar.\nIt's being added inline, probably from JavaScript misinterpreting how tall the sidebar is.. Without seeing the HTML or Markdown you're trying to add to a post I can't really offer a suggestion.\nPlease add a link to a public GitHub repo that shows the issue, screenshots aren't enough.. I see the problem. You're trying to embed an entire <html> file inside of another one. This breaks the layout.\nI don't think you're going to be able to drop in the HTML that is generated for you verbatim into a post. You'd need to strip out just the main content from that, but that could be difficult as it looks like it's applying Bootstrap CSS to entire thing... which the theme doesn't use.. Update your remote origin to point to your GH repo. You're trying to push to my repo which obviously you won't have access to.. You're pushing to the wrong repo. Update your remote origin.. @RichStone is correct. This isn't a theme issue. Facebook should give you an embed you can paste into a post, layout, or, include.\nBasics knowledge of HTML is need and not something I can cover here. Stackoverflow or a related site is the appropriate place to ask for this sort of help.. Can you provide more detail? I'm having a hard time reproducing this.\nWhat exactly on the the page is delayed? Is the large hero images? is it the text?. Try using Chrome's web developer tools to get more detail. Could be related to your ISP, or something is taking longer to load. The reason it likely doesn't happen 100% for you is the browser caches the page so it's faster the second time.\nThe theme does have some CSS that fades the page on load. It's not that you're noticing is it?\n\nGo to the page you want to inspect, right click and hit Inspect.\nHit the 3 vertical dots in the upper right corner, hit Settings, go under Network and make sure  \"Disable cache (while DevTools is open) is check.\nClick on the Network tab, hit the gray circle to record, then refresh the page.\nLet the page fully load.\n\nYou'll get a filmstrip of the page loading, see if you can find screenshots there where it's loading with blank spots. For me it's completely gradual. The page starts blank and fades in. The hero image takes longer to come in, but all of the text is there in around 400ms.\n\n. You sure you don't have a content blocker installed?\nThat link above works fine for me on iOS. \n\nAs does the themes demo site.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/year-archive/\n\n. This is a : focus state. It's good for accessibility.\nhttps://css-tricks.com/focusing-on-focus-styles/\nIf you really want to remove it look here:\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_base.scss#L130\n. It's definitely the cached include. The scripts and all comment provider includes should be reverted back to normal {% include %}\nSome use page variables that I glossed over when don't the original enhancement, and those can't be cached to work properly.. Not sure I follow where the issue is. Looking at the output of the demo site a trailing slash is on both the canonical URL and social sharing.\nhtml\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:url\" content=\"https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\">\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\">. Gotcha.\nI've reopened an old issue to replace my hand-rolled SEO include with jekyll-seo-tag if you want to track it. \nI'm going to take another look at that as that plugin does more and has better support for for JSON+LD meta output. It's also better maintained than what I include in the theme.\ncc/ #324 . Looks good! Thanks for filing the issue and fixing it with this PR.. Have a look in the closed issues as this was proposed before to see what my thoughts are on adding this complexity to theme.\nAdding alt values to teasers doesn't really do anything for accessibility or SEO. They're more for \"decoration\" than \"information\".. Where an alt description adds value is on the actual post/page a header images appears vs. related/archive pages smaller teasers do.\nThis is why it was added there in\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/1138. Thanks!. Care to submit a pull request with the integrity value added?. @DeepWalter integrity value was wrong, so the script didn't load properly. It's fixed now.. It's not part of the theme. I've manually added the AdSense <script> embed to the demo site by overriding _layouts/default.html.. Thanks!. Order matters with CSS.\nYou have a second set of .icon styles somewhere and they are overriding fill set in .icon--facebook.\nIf you look at the web inspector you can see you have .icon styles, then .icon--facebook, then a duplicate of .icon again. Remove that duplicate set and the fill will stay with the color you're setting in .icon--facebook.\nIf you have further CSS questions Stackoverflow and a ton of other tutorial sites is a better place to ask for help.. It's part of the single layout. There is no way to turn it off.\nI'd suggest creating a variant of that layout or the post_pagination.html include if you want to omit those links.. Duplicate of #1373, #1265, #623, #384, #74. No simple way. You write some custom CSS just like you would for the right sidebar. \nYou'll have to reduce the width of the main content to make room for the left increase.. Your browser's web inspector is what you'll want to use here. Inspect elements and it'll tell you the exact CSS I'm using.. If your post or page doesn't have author_profile: true the left sidebar with the author info will not show. The default front matter above would enable it for all posts.\nTable of contents are something different. Those are auto-generated from the post content and appear to the right when enabled. The table of contents that appears on the left on parts of the theme's documentation site are manually set using the \"sidebar navigation\" feature.\nSearch needs to be configured.. RE: author sidebar. Check your _posts YAML Front Matter. You're using layout: post which doesn't exist for this theme. You need to set layout: single.\nThis is why your layout looks off and is missing the sidebars.\nhttps://github.com/arvera/blog/blob/master/_posts/2005-10-16-after-5-or-6-years-coming-back-to.html#L2. Remove it from _data/navigation.yml\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/navigation/#masthead. Anything is possible with a little CSS and JavaScript. If you're looking for an easy solution I don't have one.\nThose reference links and similar tutorials are a good start.. No idea, never used particle.js before.. There are, but the theme doesn't ship with them as they have a performance hit on build times.\nI believe there are mentions of doing the same with the default theme Minima if you want to search through their issues for ideas on how to do it.. Shouldn't need that gem. Its marked as a dependency with the theme gem. It's needed when using the GitHub Pages gem though since they don't enable it by default.\n. Adding jekyll-include-cache to the plugins array in_config.yml is all that's needed.\nSee the /test for for a working example.. No that's correct, you should delete the .gemspec. I only linked to it to show that the theme gem declares jekyll-include-cache as a dependency. You don't need to install the gem in your Gemfile. If you have the MM gem it will install jekyll-include-cache.\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-include-cache\nWhat you do need is to have it listed in your plugins: array in _config.yml. That's what the error is all about.. @ashmaroli The fact that GitHub Pages supports but doesn't enable the jekyll-include-cache plugin has been a real thorn in my side. Kind of wish I never added the feature to the theme.\nThe casual Jekyll user (who is likely most of GitHub Pages users) doesn't really understand the nuisances of how Jekyll works, reads its documentation, or care what a remote theme versus a Ruby gem theme are.. It was removed from the demo site because it uses Algolia search. The layout is still in the theme.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_layouts/search.html. It overlaps because .page__content is too wide. You need padding on the right of that to leave room for the right sidebar.\n\n\n. Has nothing to do with the browser. I'm on Firefox too. It's 100% the width of the viewport.\nYou likely have the styles in media queries. You need to approach this from a mobile first mentality.\nShrink the width screen to phone size, and as you widen it check to see when things overlap. At that breakpoint you need to set the padding.\nIf you look at the code I already have you'll see I'm changing things as the width increases using breakpoint mixins like @include breakpoint($medium) { }, @include breakpoint($large) { }, @include breakpoint($x-large) { }, etc.\nI think you were just lucky with a wide browser window, because when I increase it things don't overlay. You just get a huge amount of space to the left.\n\nI'd suggest reading up on responsive web design or taking some online courses. I don't have the bandwidth to spend time debugging every layout issue you have. All of this is standard HTML/CSS development you can get help with over on forums like Stackoverflow or pay someone to fix.. You might have to build your own custom feed template if jekyll-feed plugin doesn't do what you want. That's what I do with my personal site.\nThe jekyll-feed plugin does support adding images I believe. They need to be specified in your front matter as:\nimage:\n  path: path-to-your-image.jpg\nClosing as this is a jekyll-feed question/issue.. Don't think it has anything to do with the reCaptcha.\nThe public instance of Staticman periodically hits GitHub API limits, which causes requests to fail.\nhttps://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/222. OK. I'm going to close this as it doesn't appear to be theme related.. Duplicate of #1418, #1301. You actually have more options now. Any FontAwesome icon is available for use and you can order the links however you want as well. It's just configured differently. You need to specify author links now (icon, URL, label).\nAn example:\nyaml\nauthor:\n  name: \"Your Name\"\n  avatar: \"/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg\"\n  bio: \"I am an amazing person.\"\n  location: \"Somewhere\"\n  links:\n    - label: \"Made Mistakes\"\n      icon: \"fas fa-fw fa-link\"\n      url: \"https://mademistakes.com\"\n    - label: \"Twitter\"\n      icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"\n      url: \"https://twitter.com/mmistakes\"\n    - label: \"GitHub\"\n      icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-github\"\n      url: \"https://github.com/mmistakes\"\n    - label: \"Instagram\"\n      icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-instagram\"\n      url: \"https://instagram.com/mmistakes\"\nSee the site author documentation for more info: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-author. You need to create these pages using the appropriate layouts.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#taxonomy-archives. Not sure. This is a GitHub Pages concern, not the theme. Please investigate further on they end on how to setup a custom 404 page.. Backwards compatibility. author.links is the new and preferred way of assigning author sidebar links.\nEverything that follows have been deprecated and will be removed eventually.. And missing rel attributes are just that... missing. The latest contributor PR looks to have missed adding it.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/d786c190c7399d101b8aa3c882ba64967fd881b4. @Kulbhushan-Chand That could be why it was left off. There's no magic bullet solution here I don't think. I would probably leave off itemprop=\"sameAs\" and just add rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\".. Sure.. Care to submit a PR changing the documentation text? . Yes, more configuration is required. You need to configure Jekyll's pagination to have posts show. Please consult the documentation for the home page layout.\nClosing as this has been addressed in duplicate issues: #1512, #1535, . You're not using the correct layout. Instead of layout: archive your want layout: tags\nIf you're still in doubt, check the source for the demo site's tag page.\n. Please ask Jekyll questions in their help forum. Your issue isn\u2019t s theme one.\nhttp://talk.jekyllrb.com/. Thanks for updating the docs with this PR!. Looks good, thanks!. This is not possible without you customizing the theme. I only plan on supporting the priority plus navigation pattern and not a traditional tiered one.\nClosing as this is a duplicate of: #1301. The image width isn't defined by the figure shortcode. The solution is actually much easier.\nIt's done via CSS\n\nAll you need to do is remove width: 100%; or customize your CSS to reset it back to it's normal width (which won't stretch images in a figure.\ncss\nfigure img {\n  width: auto;\n}\nWhich will take something like this:\n\nAnd give you this:\n\n. It's a design decision on my part for figure elements to have their images fill the parent container.\nAs outlined above, if you don't like that look you can customize a single line of CSS to change it. Or stick with standard Markdown images that aren't wrapped in <figure></figure>.. Looks good, thanks for taking care of this.. @lsolesen Do you have an example of G Drive video I could use to test this?. This sounds more appropriate for Jekyll/Ruby than with the theme. . Maybe the Jekyll docs would benefit from the addition.\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/buddyworks/. The preferred method isn't cloning the theme repo. That introduces all kinds of maintenance and pulling for future theme update headaches... especially for those new to Jekyll, git, etc.\nI still think this is better left as a Jekyll \"how to\" than something I directly want to mention in the theme. Especially since I will be the one supporting questions and concerns related to it. And I'd rather not endorse something I don't personally use or have experience with, that being Docker.. Do you know if this is documented anywhere? All the schemes.org examples are http://\nI do see they are serving the site over https. Just want to make sure this doesn\u2019t break anything.. Never mind, found the answer in their faqs.\n\nQ: Should we write 'https://schema.org' or 'http://schema.org' in our markup?\nThere is a general trend towards using 'https' more widely, and you can already write 'https://schema.org' in your structured data. Over time we will migrate the schema.org site itself towards using https: as the default version of the site and our preferred form in examples. However 'http://schema.org' -based URLs in structured data markup will remain widely understood for the forseeable future and there should be no urgency about migrating existing data. This is a lengthy way of saying that both 'https://schema.org' and 'http://schema.org' are fine.. @justinrummel Yes, that would be great.. Check Jekyll's documentation. The theme assumes you're familiar with its use and concepts.\n\nThey provide way more information on Ruby and such than I could ever with bulking up the theme docs.\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/. If you want different syntax highlighting colors you need to customize.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/#syntax-highlighting. Sounds like you\u2019ll need to customize the theme\u2019s JavaScript. Here\u2019s the appropriate lines that add the light box class to all image links.. Looks good. Thanks for the kind words and the PR.. I don't think we have to do anything. Looks like NPM has removed the malicious version.\n```terminal\n\nnpm ls event-stream flatmap-stream\nminimal-mistakes@4.14.1 \\minimal-mistakes\n-- npm-run-all@1.8.0-- ps-tree@1.1.0\n    -- event-stream@3.3.4\n```. Regardless I updated the NPM dependencies used as part of thebuild:js` scripts when developing the theme. They were quite old.\n\nDoing so, looks like event-stream is no longer used so we should be in the clear now.\n```terminal\n\nnpm ls event-stream flatmap-stream\nminimal-mistakes@4.14.1 \\minimal-mistakes\n`-- (empty)\n```. Thanks @justinrummel. Everything looks good to me.. Closing as this is a Markdown concern and not theme related. Please use Stackoverflow or Jekyll's help forum for these sorts of questions.. Through CSS. Look back through the commits, I adjusted things to make the entire block a link (which makes it easier to click as users expect the image and headline to be clickable... not just the button).\n\nThere's a pseudo element on the button that is absolutely positioned and fills the parent's container to make this work. You'll likely need to add some additional :hover declarations to the sibling selectors if you want them styled differently.\nOr remove the :before pseduo class styling if you want to revert back to just having the button a clickable element.. Please use a forum like Stackoverflow for these sorts of questions. This is 100% CSS related and not at all specific to the theme.\nI can't possibly answer all general web development questions.. Thanks @efung . There is documentation about this already: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#archive-settings. It is up to how you want to deal with the categories/tags links listed after a post. The default (using Liquid) has them linking to whatever you name your category or tag archive page. In the MM example I'm using /tags/ and /categories/.\nBecause the Liquid method can't generate individual pages for each taxonomy term, it's linking to ids on the page. That's where you get links like /tags/#your-tag.\n\nIf you're using Jekyll Archives it will generate the taxonomy pages for you. So you can change the permalinks to link to those directly: /tags/your-tag/index.html. You have to set these up twice... one for the theme so it knows how to generate the links at the end of a post.\ncategory_archive:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /categories/\ntag_archive:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /tags/\nAnd the second set of configs are for Jekyll Archives. The paths for the theme need to match JA's permalinks else you'll have broken links. The documentation states this. Really the only difference is JA has :name at the end.\njekyll-archives:\n  enabled:\n    - categories\n    - tags\n  layouts:\n    category: archive-taxonomy\n    tag: archive-taxonomy\n  permalinks:\n    category: /categories/:name/\n    tag: /tags/:name/\nUnfortunately Jekyll isn't really plug and play like Wordpress with a lot of this stuff. It's built for developers, and because of that there's a lot of extra knowledge and know-how you need to have to use the more advanced stuff.. These were previously cached, but were reverted as doing so caused issues. See https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/1907. Your YAML is off.

The menu doesn't currently close when clicking outside of the drop down nav. There was an old issue to build this feature in. I don't have a fix for it, but if someone wants to take it, have at it.\nThere's some weirdness with the click event that when you move the pointer off the toggle button it closes the dropdown after x amount of time.... but not always. I have no idea what's going on which is why I haven't fixed it.. Also seems to only happen in Chrome.. There's something else at play with your setup. HTML comments are <!-- -->. The slash you've added isn't needed.\nAre you using any sort of minifier that might be garbling up the HTML?. Gotcha, still don't think the slashes matter. You have a link to a repo where you're experiencing the issue?\nSeems to be working fine for the demo site.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout/uncategorized/layout-header-video/. OK. Closing for now. If you can reproduce and provide a repo I'm happy to look into it further.. Not sure. Only thing I can think of is your Algolia settings in _config.yml are off or there's some sort of configuration that's off in your index on algolia.com\nThe demo site works and as far as I can tell you have everything enabled. The JS errors are all Algolia related and don't seem to be the theme's fault. I'm not an expert on Algolia search so maybe widen your search to Stackoverflow or Algolia's support to see if this is a known issue.. Actually it might be your server config. There looks like you have some CORS issues which may be blocking Algolia. From what I can tell it's trying to pull index data but it can't.\n\n. If you look at your index on Algolia do you have title fields populated with anything? Could be the index isn't being built properly with the Algolia gem that pushes it up.\nFor reference this is a sample of what I see for the MM demo site:\n\n. You don't have to do anything special. Jekyll uses title in the front matter of post/page or if you don't assign it, it pulls it from the filename.\n```yaml\ntitle: My Awesome Post\n```\nI think you're fine with Jekyll. The issue is with the Jekyll Algolia gem. Can you confirm what command you're using to build your site? What happens when you run bundle exec jekyll algolia? You should see a message letting you know how many records were found and if there were an issues.\nShould look something like this:\nterminal\n4:01:01 PM: Settings are already up to date.\n4:01:01 PM: Getting list of existing records\n4:01:01 PM: Updating records in index mademistakes...\n4:01:01 PM: Records to delete: 2\n4:01:01 PM: Records to add: 2\n4:01:11 PM: \u2714 Indexing complete. That could be it then. Maybe there's some sort of failing with the Algolia Jekyll plugin that it needs title in the front matter.. Taking a closer look at your site, and yes none of your pages have titles. You'll definitely want to add those to the front matter.\nOr you can install a plugin like this and it'll use whatever the page's h1 is... written in Markdown as # My Heading 1 and convert that to page.title so you don't need to set it up in the front matter.\nhttps://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-titles-from-headings\nOption is yours.. I don't think title is required for the plugin. The theme needs it to build the search listing views. That's why it was breaking for you.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/search/algolia-search-scripts.html#L22-L28. Please add a link to your repo as I can only guess what your issue is.\nMost likely you need to create the pages it's trying to link to or you haven't properly setup the config to use JA pages instead of the Liquid #refs.. Don't think you gave it enough time to build on GitHub Pages. Everything seems to be working for me.\nTo test I:\n\nWent to this page: https://www.sashwat.in/linux/rhel/things-to-do-after-installing-rhel-7/\nClick on the \"Linux\" breadcrumb, which goes to this working page https://www.sashwat.in/categories/#linux\n\nClosing as it looks like you've fixed the issue.\n\n. Everything looks correct to me. The only reason GitHub Pages would give you that error about MM not being supported is if you had it declared under theme: in your _config.yml (which you do not), or if you included the MM theme gem in Gemfile (which you also are not doing).\nI do see you've commented those lines out though. Is it possible you received that error before and since correcting it things are fine? Nothing else is jumping out to me as being incorrect in your setup.. For comparison this is the _config.yml and Gemfile I'm using for the demo site that is hosted on GitHub Pages using MM as a remote_theme.. Yeah I'm out of ideas. I cloned your repo and built it locally just fine. You're using the GitHub Pages gem which is suppose to emulate the GH Pages environment and flag any errors for you.\n```\nbundle exec jekyll serve\nConfiguration file: E:/Users/Michael.Rose/Desktop/edgriebel.github.io-master/edgriebel.github.io-master/_config.yml\nIncremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental\n      Generating...\n      Remote Theme: Using theme mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\n                    done in 13.889 seconds.\n  Please add the following to your Gemfile to avoid polling for changes:\n    gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?\n Auto-regeneration: enabled for 'E:/Users/Michael.Rose/Desktop/edgriebel.github.io-master/edgriebel.github.io-master'\n    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000\n  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.\n```\nEverything looks as it should and how I typically see things go when using remote themes. I can only assume there's something in your repo that GH is picking up where it thinks you're trying to use a gem based theme that isn't whitelisted.\nWhen remote theme is working correctly it just downloads the theme files directly from my repo and uses those to build the site. It's not doing any sort of dependency installs like the gem based stuff.. @edgriebel I\u2019d take a close look at your _config.yml file. You might have some bad YAML that is tripping up GH pages during the build. For example you have repository listed twice. That shouldn\u2019t matter but who knows.\nThat and all the theme configs you have commented out might be confusing something.. Looks like the presence of a github key in _config.yml is the culprit. Explains why the MM docs site and some of my remote theme test repos work fine... neither have github: entries.\nAs a test @edgriebel, I\u2019d try removing these lines. If it builds on GH-Pages then the bug seems legit and upstream related to either the github-pages gem or jekyll-remote-theme.. Looks good, thanks for the PR.. Yes. Works like any other post or page. Add the appropriate YAML front matter.. https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#headers. Thanks for the PR @rouyeen . Disqus maps comments to the URL of the post. If something changed there it could get confused.\nPretty sure this has zero to do with the theme. I haven't used Disqus in some time, but they used to have a way of seeing what comment threads went to which posts. That would help you identify why the mapping is off.. @I-Am-The-Great there is no way to \"configure\" the size of a header video. They are designed to fill the full width of the screen (see examples below). The larger the screen, the taller the video is going to be (well depending on the source video's proportions).\nSounds like you'll want to move the video into the body of the content where it won't display as large.\nDesktop:\n\nTablet:\n\nMobile:\n\n. Looks good to me, thanks @justinrummel.. You have a public GitHub repo demonstrating this? From the YAML above everything looks correct. Something else is likely the culprit but I'd need your source code to try and reproduce it.. I see your problem. For some reason when you forked the theme you also changed the gallery include code, which broke it.\nRemove your _includes/gallery and replace with the latest theme's. Then it will work.\nAlso I'd suggest not forking the theme, and instead use it as a remote_theme. You can then remove all the theme files (_layouts, _includes, _sass, assets/css, assets/js, etc.) since it doesn't look like you're customizing anything. This will make sure you always have the latest version without having to manually pull over files and potentially break something.. I do not since that plugin isn't GitHub Pages compatible.\nReally any sort of localization used in the theme is extremely basic. If\nand when Jekyll bakes it into core I'd be interested in reevaluating it.\nOn Tue, Jan 1, 2019 at 6:15 PM Sean Killeen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nbtw while I'm at this: do you have any desire for a shortcut & conversion\nfor the i18n piece? E.g. to turn {{\nsite.data.ui-text[site.locale].search_label | default: \"Toggle Search\" }}\ninto something like {% i18n toggle_search %}? If so, I could do a\nseparate pr for that.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/2014#issuecomment-450764419,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABUB7XvIRUYJmdIk3E1WVQRYLLojyV54ks5u--wigaJpZM4Zltqh\n.\n. Everything looks great, thanks for the quick fixes.. @dAmnation69 Don't think so. This is a question is better for the Jekyll maintainers as the {% highlight %} tag is part of their project. I'd search around their issues or raise your own.. I'll have to think on this some. First brush, I feel it over complicates things and doesn't really improve much.\n\nIt also has the drawback of not being able to specify default text since it relies on the existence of a ui-text.yml file. I've found that that file can go missing quite often when users install the theme since it's not \"bundled\" with it.\nThe current method can still pickup default text because it's an actual string in the the theme files that gets pulled in if there is no _data/ui-text.yml or a string for that key in the file.. Thanks @SeanKilleen. I'll keep it open in case others might find it useful, and let the stale bot close it in 30 days if there is no further activity.. Yes. I don't think this adds value to the theme. All it's doing is moving some of the logic into an include which isn't as straight forward to follow, is about as verbose, and has the default text limitation I mentioned above.. No sorry, it's part of theme and shows on all pages.\nYou could customize the default.html layout to only show the masthead by wrapping the masthead include like this:\nliquid\n{% unless page.masthead == false %}\n  {% include_cached masthead.html %}\n{% endunless %}\nThen adding masthead: false like you have will stop the masthead from being added to the page.. Yes, depending on what layout you're using to display posts you can just add whatever HTML you want.. Great work @edemaine! I just tested this out and everything looks perfect to me.\nCan you take care of the merge conflict (I think it's just the date in the banner copyright in main.min.js... you probably forked before I made that change)? Then I can get this merged in.\nAnd yes, please open another PR with your proposal for automatic hash changing on scroll.. I'm cool with leaving it on by default and not adding some sort of config. The theme is already a mess of configurations, don't need the added complexity :laughing: \nI could see someone potentially complaining about the size of main.min.js bulking up, but it looks like it's only ~1k or so to add these two often requested features.. I'm planning on doing away with the custom SEO include in the theme and using jekyll-seo-tag (see https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/324). \nSo this might be pointless in the interim.. If it matches how jekyll-seo-tag expects a canonical URL to be defined I see no harm.\nWhat I don't want is to have it at one way and that to be incompatible with jekyll-seo-tag. I've never used the feature with that plugin so not sure if how you're doing it is the save or not.. Yes. If you use remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\" it'll pull whatever is on master.. Copy this page for the posts by year layout.\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/year-archive.md\nAs far Disqus comments your either have your Disqus account misconfigured or you haven't enabled production environment when building your site. Check the documentation site, I explain how to enable this.. Share linkes, category list, and next previous only show on the actual posts. They're not part of the \"posts\" archive layout because that would make much sense.. That could work. In all honesty breadcrumbs are still in beta and are messy and are difficult to get working if you don't configure everything correct, add the category pages, etc.\nI probably shouldn't have even added it to the theme and is something I've been thinking about removing.. Looks great @00-Evan. I just added some documentation and a test example to /test.. Good catch @justinrummel \nThe Liquid logic probably needs to be changed to\n{% if site.logo %}<a class=\"site-logo\" href=\"{{ '/' | relative_url }}\"><img src=\"{{ logo_path }}\"></a>{% endif %}. No worries @00-Evan, I'm pushing the fix now.. Thanks for the suggestions @ashmaroli!. Hash in the theme looks correct to me....\n\nFA 5.6.0 SVG \n<script defer src=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.0/js/all.js\" integrity=\"sha384-z9ZOvGHHo21RqN5De4rfJMoAxYpaVoiYhuJXPyVmSs8yn20IE3PmBM534CffwSJI\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\nFA 5.6.0 SVG used in the theme\n<script defer src=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.0/js/all.js\" integrity=\"sha384-z9ZOvGHHo21RqN5De4rfJMoAxYpaVoiYhuJXPyVmSs8yn20IE3PmBM534CffwSJI\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\nI think you're looking at the webfont version of the FA script and not the SVG.. MM demo site appears to be working fine with no failed integrity check warnings in the console.. The comment section not showing is one of two things.\n\nYou are missing a required variable that will trigger it to show. This is easy to find by looking at the conditionals around the form.\nMore likely you didn't build your site with JEKYLL_ENV=production. Jekyll builds in development by default. I have no clue what you're deployment process is, but if you're hosting anywhere except GitHub Pages (where they automatically enabled production environment variable, you need set it yourself.. Also, the theme doesn't have support for staticman_v3. So setting it as a comment provider isn't going to do anything. There is no {% when \"staticman_v3\" %} logic in the theme.. I don't use v3 and I didn't directly add the support for using a different endpoint. Which is why the documentation is a bit off.\n\nI believe what you want to do is use staticman_v2 provider, but add your endpoint under the staticman key. Everything else is setup as you would if you were using v2.. Not exactly sure how I'd handle this without bloating the theme with a bunch of extra CSS.\nThe way the stylesheet works now is at build it injects \"skin\" dependent Sass variables to give everything the correct colors.\nWhich means the dark skin's styling isn't available to the \"light\" or vice/versa. Does bundling in all the skins in a stylesheet really the best thing for those who don't care about a light/dark toggle? I dunno...\nThere's also the issue of the theme not having a canonical \"light\" skin anymore. There are essentially 10 different color palettes someone can choose... and they don't all compliment each other. Which means probably designing 9 or so more color schemes to invert them.\nPersonally I've never much cared for sites that add this sort of thing. I'd rather see it happen at the system or browser level. There are browser extensions that do just this which might have better results vs. me trying to maintain consistency across 10 color palettes x 2 modes (20 palettes if you're counting at home).. As mentioned in the other issue, I haven\u2019t used v3 nor did I work on the pull request to add it. I probably won\u2019t be much help because of this.\nThe documention is lacking because of this. You\u2019d be better off looking at the source code to see what it accepts. Checking there you\u2019ll see endpoint is the full URL as you have above.\nccing @maxime-michel as he added the PR that added the Staticman endpoint config.. This might be a bit redundant. Not all images need alt text, especially when the image is pure decoration. This is the case with the logo. \nThere is already text describing the link, duplicating that with the logo may end up sounding strange from a screen reader when it repeats itself.. You're correct on the empty alt attribute. I had thought it was outputting alt=\"\", but looking at the PR I merged in they forgot the attribute entirely.\nNot sure on the custom text conditional, but I'm OK with adding in just alt=\"\" to silence an image path being read instead.. My opinion is not to include it. The custom text is already present regardless if you use a logo or not.\nIn those cases where you use both you'd have it duplicated for assistive technologies.\nOnly use case I could see is if you have a blank title text and just show the logo.\nI prefer simple over allowing configuring every possible thing. A user can always override an include to tailor it to fit their needs. I'm trying to balance this as their are already too many configs in theme and I've done a bad job of reigning them in.. Nested comments are not supported in any of my themes.\nHave a look on my personal site and repo to see how I\u2019ve done it.\nIf you\u2019re starting fresh it\u2019s much easier since you can use an internal Staticman field to assign a unique identifier for each comment as a way of referencing their parent. When I implemented it on my personal site I imported hundreds of comments from Disqus which left me with legacy comments without these UIDs.\nIf you search around there are others who have improved on my implementation. I don\u2019t have the links handy but they exist.. Thanks @hakcat . Not planning on replacing. Will just drop support.\nI've taken the approach of supporting the majors, anything else like Reddit is up to you to add.. I am not working on it. Jekyll has it on their roadmap I believe to swap out the Sass gem with their next major version.\nThe theme doesn't have to change anything. This will come from Jekyll core.. Also Sass isn't going anywhere. This is a deprecation of Ruby Sass which is transitioning to LibSass or Dart Sass.. This will be fixed in #2035 . cc/ @edemaine . See theme documentation. You can add any sort of social link you want via author.links in _config.yml.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-author\nThe old method has been deprecated.. The theme doesn't support this natively. You'll need to use a plugin and adjust the theme solve to make it work.\nhttps://github.com/ibrado/jekyll-stickyposts/. @asarkar If you look at the link above and dig into their documentation they advise that you need to use a modified for loop to display posts correctly with those marked sticky at the top.\nThis modified for loop has to be changed in the theme files. Depending on if you're using pagination or not will determine how you modify the theme:\nIf you're using a paginated home page you'll need to modify _layouts/home.html to something like:\n{% assign sorted = paginator.posts | sort: \"stickiness\" %}\n{% for post in sorted %}\n...etc...\n{% endfor %}\nIf you're not paginating you'll have to make modifications to _layout/posts.html to sort sticky posts correctly.. This is also the first time I've seen a request to \"stick\" posts. So not sure how common of a request it is. It's quite common with Wordpress since that's baked into that software. This is much harder to do with Jekyll since it requires a plugin (not GitHub Pages compatible) or a mess of Liquid spaghetti to pull it off.. @asarkar If you have index.html and it\u2019s using layout: home, you\u2019re pagination posts.. @asarkar No idea, never used their plugin. Maybe inquire with the developer?. Couple of things.\n1. I wasn't able to build your docs.test repo locally until I modified your Gemfile. It was looking for the jekyll-include-cache gem which you were missing. Try this:\n```ruby\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins\nIf you have any plugins, put them here!\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem \"jekyll-paginate\"\n  gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"\n  gem \"jekyll-gist\"\n  gem \"jekyll-feed\"\n  gem \"jemoji\"\n  gem \"jekyll-include-cache\"\nend\n```\nThen run bundle install. After doing this your site built for me and the navs appear.\n2. Search doesn't give any results, though this is likely due to you not having any posts. The way you've setup _docs should be as a collection, but that doesn't seem to be the case so that could account for them being excluded from the search index as well. The search index file loops over all collection documents only. So if they are pages their content won't be included.\n3. You have some theme specific files left in the repo that could be confusing GitHub Pages. Remove minimal-mistakes-jekyll.gemspec as you don't need that.\n4. You should gitignore _site as pushing that may also be confusing GitHub Pages. It generates this folder for you and you shouldn't include it as what you are currently pushing has localhost paths. You can gitignore .sass-cache as well.\n5. Your docs.accounts repo is using the MM theme as a gem, which isn't supported by GitHub Pages. It'll build locally but if you're trying to have GH build your page it's not going to work. \nI'd start with all of these suggestions. I've never used GitHub Enterprise but there is this issue currently that may or may not be related.\nhttps://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme/issues/43\n. Your docs.accounts repo has the _docs collection correctly setup. This is why search works there and not in the other repo.. What sort of settings does Netlify CMS require you move to a _data file?\nI'd like to avoid any breaking changes related to settings as they're really hard to communicate when the theme updates. So many people just set it and forget it (especially as a remote_theme) and I'd likely deal with a lot of issues when their sites break. Just like when I added the jekyll-include-cache plugin that required _config.yml changes to work properly with GitHub Pages.. Do you really need to remove the _config.yml settings you're moving to _data/settings.yml? Couldn't you just copy them to settings.yml? That means duplication, but I don't see any harm with that. The same thing happens if you use staticman.yml for comments...\nThere's a lot of theme logic that looks for these variables under site. namespace too. Changing all of these out would be a lot of work since it would be changing site.variableName to site.data.settings.variableName.\nAnd that opens up similar issues the theme has with ui-text.yml data file, that isn't copied with the theme gem and can have missing text strings because of that. Unless you specifically add default filter values to every variable (which I've done for the UI text, but is kind of unwieldly).. For the reasons cited above I think this would cause me way too many headaches.\nThere have been issues raised over on jekyll/jekyll related to data files and themes that would help clean some of this up. If and when those land would be a good time to reevaluate. Right now this would add extra complexity to the theme I'm not comfortable with.. The theme doesn't support anything like disallow: true in the YAML Front Matter. I don't think the jekyll-seo-tag plugin does either.\nOnly other option you have is to customize the theme slightly. I provide a blank include for adding custom meta tags to your pages' <head>. This would be ideal for adding a <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, nofollow\"> to instruct search bots not to index or follow any of the links on a given page.\nIf you want to use disallow: true as trigger you could add the following to _includes/head/custom.html and any page you add that to will get the noindex, nofollow meta tag added to it at build.\nliquid\n{% if page.disallow %}\n  <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, nofollow\">\n{% endif %}. I put up a proof of concept that fixes the issue by using Smooth Scroll + Gumshoe. It needs some work yet as the scrollspy .active classes trigger as you scroll to a header, but turns off as you scroll pass it.\nTo test out the PR brand you can replace gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" in your Gemfile with the following:\nruby\ngem 'minimal-mistakes-jekyll', :git => 'https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git', :branch => 'smooth-scroll-gumshoe'. Updated Gumshoe to 5.1.0 in #2082, which supports headers. So now the TOC correctly highlights as you scroll. If you can test it out before I merge into master that would be much appreciated.. I'm not using the minified versions in the source folder as they're minified by the npm run build:js task that smooshes all the theme's JavaScript into a single file.\nThe theme isn't using a fixed header so I don't think there's a way for me to easily bake that in for users like you who have customized the theme. Those customizations would have to happen in your fork.. I've done this with one of my other themes and it has some serious performance implications.\nEssentially it has to check each page as it loops through them to pull out the title. If you have a large site it can increase you build times from a few seconds to minutes.\nWhich I think is a big drawback.. Think this is a good addition. Could you make the change in assets/js/_main.js as well? Having it in just the minified script will leave it open to being overwritten in the future when it's processed with npm build:js.. Can you take care of the merge conflict on assets/js/main.min.js?\nYou'll need to run npm run build:js to compile the script, then commit the compiled version of main.min.js to the PR.\nSee the docs if you need help with the build process.\nAlso don't bump the version number. I'll take care of that in a future release.. As far as I can tell you have things setup correctly. The fact that it works locally and not on GitHub Pages tells me there's something going on there and not theme related.\nThey might be caching the old version. I do notice you are commiting _site, vendor/, and a bunch of Jekyll cache files and folderd that you probably shouldn't. That might be confusing GH Pages when you push commits.\nI'd .gitignore\n\n_site\nvendor\n.bundle\n\nThen remove minimal-mistakes-jekyll.gemspec as that's for the theme gem and not something you want in your repo. And then remove Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, and replace with the correct Gemfile (See docs for remote theme instructions)\nThen run bundle update and push all that up.. It's not an animation, it's a :focus state. It's good for accessibility.\nRef: https://css-tricks.com/focusing-on-focus-styles/#article-header-id-4. Thanks for the PR.\nMeta keywords at one point were useful, but due to spammy practices they're considered bad for SEO and not something encouraged to add to your site.\nhttps://yoast.com/meta-keywords/. No not that I know of. This isn't a native feature of Jekyll. You'd need some sort of plugin to do this.. 1. You need to enable Jekyll's pagination in _config.yml.\n  ```yaml\n  paginate: 5\n  paginate_path: /page:num/\nplugins:\n    - jekyll-paginate\n  ``\n2. Remove [index.md](https://github.com/albilaga/albilaga.github.io/blob/master/index.md) from the root of your site. You already haveindex.html(which will be your paginated homepage). Having both is confusing Jekyll. Jekyll's pagination will not work with a.mdhome page, you need to have just the.html` version.. Breadcrumb support is experimental. It hasn't been fleshed out to work like you want. The way it works now is it takes the URL and uses that as the crumb title, not the page title.\nYou'll likely need a Jekyll plugin to do what you want.. The example code above doesn't have any indents at all and shows like this. Not exactly sure I follow what your issue is, but it sounds more like a Markdown thing than anything related to the theme.\n\nWhatever indents (e.g. how many spaces you have) is respected by Kramdown/Rouge when it applies the syntax highlighting. It doesn't rewrite tabs to be 2 or 4 spaces to my knowledge. Which is what I think you're asking.. The theme was designed with a two column layout in mind, so you won't find a config to enable this.\nTo widen the main content container you'll need to adjust the theme's CSS. Take a look through these old issues as there are suggestions to get you started.\n1373, #1265, #623, #384, #74. If your post has an excerpt in its YAML Front Matter it will be shown. You'll have to remove this line if you don't want them in the archive layouts.. The theme doesn't have a post layout, that's why you're getting an error.\nYou'll want to use the layout: single.\nAll of the layouts available to the theme are documented here.. Looks like the remote theme isn't properly configured. And since that's not installed, the layouts are obviously missing.\nYou'll know that the remote theme installed because Jekyll will output when you run build or serve. Something like this:\nbundle exec jekyll build\nConfiguration file: /docs/_config.yml\n            Source: /docs\n       Destination: /docs/_site\n Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental\n      Generating...\n      Remote Theme: Using theme mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\nNo idea if you're repo up on GH is current, but you need to remove theme: minima and add remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\".\n. Try bundle exec jekyll build --trace --verbose\nIt'll give you more info. My guess is the jekyll-remote-theme plugin is failing for some reason and it's not downloading the theme files. I had this issue months ago on Windows. But they updated the plugin and those issues went away.\nAs far as I can tell your issue is your Ruby environment and possibly the remote theme plugin, not anything specific to the theme or a config.. Both jekyll-remote-theme and jekyll-include-cache are installed by GitHub Pages. If you pushed the repo up to GH Pages now and didn't include them (or a Gemfile), your site would still build.\nIt's when you develop locally things can get iffy if you don't install all the gems. jekyll-include-cache is a weird one because it's not enabled by default, which is why you need to explicitly turn it on in both the _config.yml and your Gemfile.\nThe theme docs can over cover so much. 99% of the issues with Jekyll aren't even Jekyll related... they're Ruby and getting damn gems to install properly.. To avoid further complicating things, not sure this is necessary. The time start is part of the video's URL. Couldn't you just append that to the video id and do something like this?\n{% include video id=\"XsxDH4HcOWA?start=35\" provider=\"youtube\" %}\nPerhaps just an update to the documentation to note that an id can contain the start time from a YouTube embed.. I think your issue is how you're naming your _posts. You are using spaces instead of hyphens e.g. 2019-03-03-first blog post.md\nThis is creating comments in a folder _data/first blog post. The problem with that is the comment logic is looking to match comments with the page.url which is first-blog-post (with hypens). This is why none of your posts are showing the comments you have _data files for.\nRename your post filenames to follow Jekyll's convention of YYYY-MM-DD-your-filename.md, submit a new comment, and verify it's going in a folder like _data/your-filename.\nI renamed your posts, renamed the _data folders, and comments showed up locally for me.. I haven\u2019t tested this yet, but seeing how it seems to have broken in 4.15 and up, it is likely related to #2019 and #2023.\nCcing @edemaine as they did this work and might have some insight as to the issue.. I've confirmed that this is definitely a bug.\nPerhaps dropping jQuery Smooth Scroll, the custom hash rewriting, and scrollspy implementation and going with Smooth Scroll + Gumshoe as noted in #2050 would be a better solution. Seems that it doesn't break footnote links.. I put up a proof of concept that fixes the issue by using Smooth Scroll + Gumshoe. It needs some work yet as the scrollspy .active classes trigger as you scroll to a header, but turns off as you scroll pass it.\nTo test out the PR brand you can replace gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" in your Gemfile with the following:\nruby\ngem 'minimal-mistakes-jekyll', :git => 'https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git', :branch => 'smooth-scroll-gumshoe'. The delay is part of the new Smooth Scroll script. It has different easing settings that I haven't tried adjusting yet to fine tune the scroll speed.. Sounds good @edemaine. I'm struggling with getting Gumshoe's scroll spy to work correctly. So if you have any suggestions please let me know.\nSeems like it was designed to have the anchor id on a <div> element wrapped around each TOC section. So what happens is the scrollspy hits a header with an id that matches the TOC link, activates the active class, but turns it off as soon as you scroll by the header.\nI'm sure there's a way to keep it active until you hit the next id, but haven't figured that part out. Guessing we'd need to tap into Gumshoe's event API somehow.. Thanks for opening the issue! I've subscribed to it and will follow along with any developments to Gumshoe.. Updated Gumshoe to 5.1.0 in #2082, which supports headers. So now the TOC correctly highlights as you scroll. If you can test it out before I merge into master that would be much appreciated.. @edemaine Ooops! My push silently failed and I never bothered to check. Should be there now https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/2082/commits/1d4923578a53d2c67d6b46cb786556e849c45406\nThanks for testing @frankhecker!. @edemaine Thanks for testing.\nI believe there's some easing going on with the speed of the scroll. I went with the default of 300ms but apparently you can adjust that.\nAnd re: the URL bar hash no longer changing on scroll. As far as I know the new Smooth Scroll script doesn't have that feature. I'm not so concerned about losing that. In fact the old way kind of bothered me with how it added /# when you scrolled to the top.\nIf there's an easy way to get the URL bar hash to change on scroll, and not add /# when you hit the top I'd be cool with that. Otherwise I think we can drop the feature.. @edemaine I'm cool with changing the speed to more closely match jquery-smooth-scroll defaults.\nAre you able to push commits to my pull request #2082 and add your code that disables Gumshoe during smooth scrolls?. @edemaine I don't personally use that feature of FA, but someone recently asked for it. I only added it because it didn't seem to have any adverse impact on performance.\nMight have to reconsider that one as I don't think majority of the theme's users care or use FA icons as pseudo elements.. @edemaine I removed that attribute from the FA script and things look better on my end too. Think I'll leave it out. It's easy enough to override the theme's _includes/script.html file if someone really needs to add it back.\nAs far as I'm concerned it's an edge case and I'd rather improve performance for the majority of users who are using the theme unmodified.\nThanks for debugging this one for me!. The masthead that the navigation links are placed inside, are wrapped with <div class=\"masthead__inner-wrap\"></div>. This has a max-width of 1280px set to constrain it with the main content width.\nIf you want to push the right links all the way to the right edge of the browser, you'll need to remove the max-width.\n\n. As far as Staticman is concerned it can be optional. It's up to you set Staticman fields are required. Simply remove email from allowedFields in your staticman.yml config file.\nRemoving the field isn't something I'd entertain as a customization to the theme. The HTML for that field can be found in [_includes/comments.html](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/comments.html#L68-L71) if you want to override the include or edit (if you've forked the theme).. Yes, you can. Copy _includes/comments.html to the same location in the root of your repo and make your edits to it there.\nAll other layout files will come from the remote theme and the include you have locally will override the one in the theme.. I think you have the wrong path to your og_image. If you look at the source of that page it has this path:\nhttps://quintus-sertorius-blue.github.io/_images/biblio.jpg\nWhich isn't valid. That's why Twitter is showing a gray image. Closing as this isn't a theme issue but a content issue on your end.\nFYI - Jekyll ignores _underscore folders by default. Looks like you have two lines of includes in your _config.yml Which could part of your problem too. It should be an array instead:\ninclude: [ \"_pages\", \"_images\" ]. There is not. This is something purely done via CSS.. The theme does absolutely nothing in terms of image loading. The way your images are loading have to do with them being large and I believe progressively optimized.\nClosing as this is a content issue.. You can do this linking to a larger image.\nmarkdown\n[![](small-img.jpg)](large-img.jpg). This is standard Markdown. To show a larger image you need to physically link to a larger asset.\nThe gallery does the same thing. Only instead of writing it in Markdown using an include. Which if you ask me isn't as nice since if you ever decide to switch to another SSG your include won't work anymore.... the Markdown syntax would.. Also, the lightbox that shows the larger image is triggered on image links. So having standard images wouldn't work.\nWhat you'll likely want is some sort of image \"zooming\" JavaScript plugin. I'm not interested in adding that to the theme, but you certainly could bolt it on yourself.. You have your posts in the wrong folder. Jekyll will only paginate \"posts\".\nRename your _pages folder to _posts and it will work.. You don't have a layout assigned. Either add layout: single to its front matter, or use front matter defaults (hint... that's what I'm doing with the demo site).. Add text-decoration: none; here.. Styling was not included for .task-list. Should be fixed now.. Do you have an older version of the theme locally? Meaning do you have _layouts, _includes, _sass, etc folders in your repo that are overriding the bundled theme files?. Yes you do. They are an older version of the theme. That's why the new skin feature and author links isn't working for you.\nThe way Jekyll themes works is if you have local copies of those folders, those files override anything in the theme bundle. So even though you have the latest version gem version installed, all of those files are defaulting back to your \"old\" local version.\nYou'll need to remove the following folders:\n\n_layouts\n_includes\n_sass\nassets/css\nassets/js. Could you add spaces around the variable names eg. {{overlay_filter}} ~> {{ overlay_filter }} to stay consistent with how I reference them through out the rest of the theme?\n. Might want to add {{ site.baseurl }} after {{ site.url }} as the theme supports that and if defined in _config.yml will probably assign the wrong page url to canonical.\n. Took a closer look and adding the author__location class to the <li> element is unnecessary. As is the .author__location declaration in _sidebar.scss.\n\nIf cursor: default is added to .author__urls here you can get away with adding a single line and not having to mess with the sidebar's markup.\n. Actually per the schema spec I believe this is suppose to be capitalized.\njekyll-seo-tag suggests the capitalized version as well.\n\ntype - The type of things that the page represents. This must be a Schema.org type, and will probably usually be something like BlogPosting, NewsArticle, Person, Organization, etc.\n. What was the thinking behind changing this line? What happens if someone doesn't create an authors.yml data file? Think it's best to leave this commit out so the PR is focused on just the visibility fix.\n. Testing this I hit an error. Maybe change feed to atom_feed since I believe the previous name was conflicting with the jekyll-feed plugin.\n\nAlso if you could squash all the commits into 1 with rebase that would make things cleaner when I merge the pull request in.\nThanks!\n. Change variable name from feed to atom_feed to avoid conflicting with jekyll-feed plugin.\n. I've deprecated the base_path include as Jekyll provides filters to do this now.\n. can replace prepend: base_path with absolute_url\n. One more minor thing. With the latest MM I moved away from assuming images would be placed in /assets/images/ and instead encourage adding the full path. Adds more flexibility to where they can be placed for the user.\nIf you could remove prepend: \"/assets/images/\" it fall in line with the other helpers and I can merge it in.\n. I tested this locally and the baseurl doesn't get added to the path properly. I think if you do similar changes you did for the \"previous\" button link it should fix the problem.\nSomething like this worked for me:\nhtml\n<li><a href=\"{{ site.paginate_path | replace: ':num', paginator.next_page | replace: '//', '/' | absolute_url }}\">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].pagination_next | default: \"Next\" }}</a></li>. What is the purpose of this code? As a test I added the following YAML Front Matter to add a color overlay as the code seems to suggest is possible, and no video was embedded.\nyaml\nheader:\n  video:\n    provider: \"youtube\"\n    id: \"gOBj8HdfA2Y\"\n  overlay_color: \"#333\"\nHad to remove overlay_color for it to work.. Fix indent (use 2 spaces), replace single quotes with double, and pull out <style> for .embed-container.\nI'd prefer any styling be added to the theme's CSS instead of adding inline. Since it's exactly the same for Youtube and Vimeo this is a safe move.\nYou can add it to _sass/_utilities.scss at the very end like so:\n```scss\n/\n   Responsive Video Embed\n   ========================================================================== /\n.embed-container {\n  position: relative;\n  padding-bottom: 56.25%;\n  height: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  max-width: 100%;\niframe,\n  object,\n  embed {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n  }\n}\n``. This is invalid Liquid for \"else if\". Should be{% elsif video_provider == \"youtube\" %}instead.. Does adding bothasyncanddefer` attributes actually work? I was under the impression you had 3 options with scripts.\n\nThere are three possible modes that can be selected using these attributes. If the async attribute is present, then the script will be executed asynchronously, as soon as it is available. If the async attribute is not present but the defer attribute is present, then the script is executed when the page has finished parsing. If neither attribute is present, then the script is fetched and executed immediately, before the user agent continues parsing the page.\n\nSource: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#attr-script-async. Guess I should have kept scrolling down the page because the W3 said exactly what you did \ud83d\ude1b \n\nThe defer attribute may be specified even if the async attribute is specified, to cause legacy Web browsers that only support defer (and not async) to fall back to the defer behavior instead of the synchronous blocking behavior that is the default.. Yes it should be protocol relative.. Maybe just do https://, I just checked the embeds on Vimeo and that's what they default to. The YouTube one is that way as well.. - [ ] Change \"adjust several theme-files\" to \"adjusting several theme-files\" to match same tense as \"adding... reordering...\"\n- [ ] Replace minimal-mistakes with Minimal Mistakes (not hyphenated, initial cap'd). - [ ] Typo. Change \"mininmal-mistakes repository\" to \"Minimal Mistakes repository\" to remain consistent with the rest of the docs.. These paragraphs sound off to me. I get what you're going for but it's not the most clear thing and the last thing I want to do is confuse people. Especially since a lot of theme users are using git and GitHub for the first time.\n\nMight help to make it clear that master should be tracking the MM repo and updates are pulled into that. Which in turn can be merged into a separate branch with customizations or edits made to the theme.. Not convinced \"Ruby Gem method with a local minimal-mistakes repository\" is the right way to describe this method. Using the theme as a Ruby gem doesn't require forking the repo. Which you have to do for your method of tracking the MM origin repo to pull updates.\nSo there probably has to be some instruction on or at the very list make it clear this is a hybrid of forking the theme and loading the theme files as a local pseudo gem. Which might end up confusing people even more as they're really similar.. Replace site.url with Jekyll's absolute URL filter. This will cover users who need to use both site.url and site.baseurl.\nthis.page.url = \"{{ page.url | absolute_url }}\";. Instead of prepending baseurl and url use the absolute_url filter which does both of these operations.. Sure, but that's pretty much what it is now... except your version removes a few more checks.\nI guess I'm waiting for someone else to verify this is actually broken and not outputting the expected URL for Discourse and not some sort of Jekyll/environment/configuration issue.. Will probably want to use the same method the rest of the theme uses for \"localizing\" text strings so it can be translated if need be.\nSomething like alt=\"{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].avatar_for | default: \"Avatar for\" }} for {{ include.name }}\"\nAnd then add avatar_for: \"Avatar for\" under the English locales in _data/ui-txt.yml. Protocol less URLs are now considered an anti-pattern. It's preferable to use https when available.\nhttps://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/. Exactly. And I'm not sure if // might filter out something it shouldn't be. I doubt anyone would have a path with that, but seems possible.. Sure. Keeping things consistent with the rest of the \"external URL\" checks in the theme. You may be over thinking things a tad, simple is better.. I think you can safely remove the author_class stuff. Looking back at my original code class=\"author__avatar\" on the <img> element was left in mistakenly. It's applied on the wrapper div and not needed anymore.. Probably worth adding defer to each of these three scripts to give priority to the other page content loading first.\neg. <script defer src=\"{{ '/assets/js/lunr/lunr-...js' | absolute_url }}\"></script>. I like that idea of truncating based on the number of posts. Not sure what a good baseline should be. Guess it really depends on the the size of {{ content }}.\nIn the case of the MM demo site, the documentation pages are pretty big and full of words.\nMaybe we default to truncating (can probably up it to well over 50 words) and then have an override setting in _config.yml to index the full post. If the user wants to take the potential hit to page load perf they can.. Maybe something like:\n```yaml\n_config.yml\nsearch_full_content: true # true, false (default)\n```\nhtml\n<!-- lunr-store.js -->\n{% if site.search_full_content == true %}\n  {% assign excerpt = doc.content | strip_html | strip_newlines | jsonify %}\n{% else %}\n  {% assign excerpt = doc.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 20 | jsonify %}\n{% endif %}. I\u2019m not convinced post count is the way to go, way too unreliable. I could have 2,000 posts with a sentence of text each or have a couple hundred with epic word counts going over 10,000 and get a huge lunar-store.js because it falls below the threshold.\nI think truncating the content to around 50 words by default, with a config override to turn that off would be sensible. If someone wants to get more granular with the amount of words truncated they override the theme file.\n  . I think role=\"banner\" is redundant. According to the W3 using <header> when it's a descendant of the body automatically gets role=\"banner\".\n\nThe HTML5 header element defines a banner landmark when its context is the body element.\nThe HTML5 header element is not considered a banner landmark when it is descendant of any of following elements: article, aside, main, nav, section\nref: Banner Landmark HTML5 techniques. Rather than creating a new set of key/values under comments can you place under staticman entry that already exists on line 42. . Variable is incorrect. Should be {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].comments_label | default: \"Leave a Comment\" }}. 1. To keep things consistent you can follow the pattern used for the menu toggle (see menu button after for example) instead of adding aria-label. This is valid and will pass the accessibility test.\n\n\nLabel probably doesn't need to be so verbose, \"Toggle search\" should be adequate. I would also suggest hooking into /_data/ui-text.yml so this text can be localized (or overrided) by theme users.\n\nExample:\nhtml\n<button class=\"search__toggle\" type=\"button\">\n  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].search_label | default: \"Toggle Search\" }}</span>\n  <svg class=\"icon\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 15.99 16\">\n    <path d=\"M15.5,13.12L13.19,10.8a1.69,1.69,0,0,0-1.28-.55l-0.06-.06A6.5,6.5,0,0,0,5.77,0,6.5,6.5,0,0,0,2.46,11.59a6.47,6.47,0,0,0,7.74.26l0.05,0.05a1.65,1.65,0,0,0,.5,1.24l2.38,2.38A1.68,1.68,0,0,0,15.5,13.12ZM6.4,2A4.41,4.41,0,1,1,2,6.4,4.43,4.43,0,0,1,6.4,2Z\" transform=\"translate(-.01)\"></path>\n  </svg>\n</button>\nAnd added to _data/ui-text.yml\nyaml\nen: &DEFAULT_EN\n  menu_label: \"Toggle menu\"\n  search_label: \"Toggle search\"\n.

Do you happen to have any experience adding classes to list items with the Kramdown parser? \nApparently footnotes need to look like <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\"> for the script to recognize them, but right now they just turn out as <li id=\"fn:bgft\">.  \nAfter looking at the Kramdown syntax page I've tried putting {:footnote} in a few different spots, but none of them correctly declare the class in the list item. It says that you can't put an attribute for a footnote marker but doesn't mention whether attributes are fair game for footnote definitions.  \nI even tried editing the html for my test post directly, but it seems like that file gets overwritten when I run jekyll serve. \n. Cool, didn't expect you to but thought it was worth asking. \nThanks again for the help!\n. Turns out that this was two different issues. I'll explain them both if anyone else bumps into them.  \nThe first, which resulted in the error containing no implicit conversion of Fixnum into Array, was because I had categories: 2014 in the posts' YAML. That should have been a singular category: or either a YAML list or an [category1, category2] comma-separated string. See here. \nThe second, the lamdas.json business, was fixed when I added a directory that contains Reveal.js to the exclude section of _config.yml, so I assume that's the culprit. I saw it making that error in a different issue: https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs/issues/2   \nIt's a short lived victory, though: now I'm getting a different error related to the SCSS conversion. I'll close this & start a different issue for that one.\n. Just in case anyone else runs into this error\u2014after updating the source for reveal.js, I'm now able to build those pages with Jekyll and put them up on Github Pages. \nSo updating Reveal.js seems to be all that's needed to fix the lambdas.json doesn't exist error.\n. That's exactly the culprit. I guess I wasn't careful enough comparing the HEAD and new versions when I pulled everything in from your update.  \nThanks so much!\n. Thanks for the pointers and helping narrow down the cause!\n. Okay, cool. Thanks for giving it a glance!\n. Thanks! I switched to <div> and added some of those style declarations to the 2.2.1 page.scss, and comments look great now.   \nMuch appreciated!!!\n. ",

(I'm also a Jekyll and css noob, sorry :(.)\nIs changing variable $def_grid: 12 to something like $def_grid: 16 in the file grid.scss the only thing that is required to make the text wider?\nOr do we also need to update all the grid(12,10) values in page.scss to match?\nIf I just change $def_grid, nothing seems to happen. But if I try to change the values in pages.scss to match $def_grid---say, grid(16,14) prefix(16,1) and suffix(16,1) to match $def_grid: 16---I get a \"page failed\" error from GitHub.\nI sort of just gave up and reverted everything back. Would be great to fully understand how to shift the width.\nThanks!\n. Pretty sure I understand. \nI decided to try running my site locally (following your amazing instructions) since I had not done so upgrading to OS X 10.11.\nBut what is frustrating is that, while I feel like I understand, I still find that, while running the server locally and making the following changes to #main.page...\ncss\n        ...\n        @media #{$large} {\n        @include grid(12,10); // increased to 10\n        }\n        @media #{$x-large} {\n            @include grid(12,9); // increase to 9\n        }\n...I see no noticeable changes to a post even though I can see the changes being regenerated in terminal.\nBut the more odd thing I noticed is that the text DOES get wider as I make my browser screen thinner. It only shrinks when I get to a certain browser window width. You can see a video of here.\nSo I'm at a loss. I've fiddled with the variables but have seen no significant changes. I also noticed, as seen in the video, that the width of a post is wider at thinner browser widths but then breaks as I take the browser with to full screen. My guess is that it has something to do with the @media variables in variables.scss\ncss\n$micro            : \"only screen and (min-width: 30em)\";\n$small            : \"only screen and (min-width: 37.5em)\";\n$medium           : \"only screen and (min-width: 48em)\";\n$large            : \"only screen and (min-width: 62em)\";\n$x-large          : \"only screen and (min-width: 86.375em)\";\nBut, when I fiddled with this, I just got errors.

    "ohadschn": "@mmistakes any news here? Looks like the old code is still there... BTW The latest recommendation looks like this (note that the tracking code appears twice, in the script query string and in the gtag call):\n```js\n Global Site Tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics \n\n\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)};\n  gtag('js', new Date());</p>\n<p>gtag('config', 'UA-12345678-9');\n\n```. For anyone bumping into this as I did:\n\nThe so called \"Universal Analytics\" tracking code requested by @muhasturk is available using google-universal as the analytics provider in _config.yml: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/analytics-providers/google-universal.html.\nIt's trivial to just paste whatever analytics code you want (e.g. Google's new \"Global Site Tag\" I pasted above) in the _includes/analytics-providers/custom.html override and specify custom as the analytics provider ( per the Analytics section in the docs).. @mmistakes how would you recommend adding target=\"_blank\" if I were so inclined? The scripts in the attached commit seems a bit hacky, plus I'd rather not override things in assets and _includes if I can (for a better upgrade experience).. @mmistakes would you consider adding some optional flag to say _config.yml to enable target=\"_blank\" out of the box?. Fair enough, but after all this is a personal blog theme, and personally some of us like external links opening in new tabs :) \n\n(with the proper noopener/noreferrer security measures in place of course - didn't know about this vulnerability BTW so thank you for enlightening me). Looks like the UX community agrees with @mmistakes: https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/5397/whats-your-take-on-target-blank/5399.. I clarified the docs using the guidance above.\n@mmistakes - can we get the \"posts by category\" experience using jekyll-archive (like https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/categories/)?\nI have categories working (https://blog.ohadsoft.com/categories/uncategorized/) but this is a 404: https://blog.ohadsoft.com/categories/ (source: https://gitlab.com/ohadschn/ohadschn.gitlab.io).. @mmistakes Ah that works, thanks!\nI'm confused now though. If I need to put those pages there myself anyway, what do I gain from using jekyll-archive?. Ahhh, now I understand:\n1. If I want a taxonomy (tag/category) index, I need _pages/category-archive.html and _pages/tag-archive.html as described above, regardless of whether I use jekyll-archives or not.\n1. If I use pure liquid, taxonomy links would simply point to the corresponding index page above with a hash link, e.g.: https://mysite.com/categories/#foo (so that the entire index opens but the browser jumps to the corresponding section in the index).\n1. If I use jekyll-archives, taxonomy items get their own proper page automatically generated pointed to by \"real\" (non-hash) links, e.g.: https://mysite.com/categories/foo (which is independent of the full taxonomy index).. @mmistakes what type do the jekyll-archives-generated discrete taxonomy pages have for the purposes of _config.yml Front Matter defaults? Neither posts nor pages seem to catch them.... https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives/issues/107. Also related: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/832. I wonder, has there been any news on this? Is there some simpler way to customize the category/tag pages generated by jekyll-archives (e.g. add a header image)?. @mmistakes thank you for the detailed explanation!\nI had something simpler in mind though, just a static header: image: foo.jpg to all archive pages. I was wondering if there were a simpler way to do that than the one outlined by @billgarrison above (I prefer to override as little as possible in order to enjoy the most of future updates), but I gather currently there is not, due to lack of access to the headers liquid code in that scope.\nI opened an issue with jekyll-archives: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives/issues/107.. I'm confused, isn't this what the OP initially tried to do and failed because the archive-taxonomy.html layout doesn't have the Liquid code for headers? (I tried the same to verify, indeed it didn't work and no image was displayed). So when you say \"If you want all of the archive pages to have the same image you can just dump that into a new layout\" you mean write the actual HTML into archive-taxonomy.html (e.g. img src), rather than use the header logic?. Does this _layouts/archive-taxonomy.html override look about right (it seems to work)?\n```html\nlayout: default\nauthor_profile: false\n\n\n\n\n\n  {% include sidebar.html %}\n\n  \n{{ page.title }}\n    {% for post in page.posts %}\n      {% include archive-single.html %}\n    {% endfor %}\n  \n\n``. BTW for anyone wondering how my initial link worked (using the non-existent{{url}}), it simply evaluated to nothing and [/foo/resource` works when your site is served off the root/apex of the domain](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#including-images-and-resources).... +1 from me, built-in search would be great. The other threads suggest using those plugins can be a hassle.. One important note to make is that jekyll-lunr-js-search says \"UNSUPPORTED\" in its GH page, and the new kid on the block looks to be https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search.. How about just a UI placeholder for the search box then?\nGetting the search script/engine running properly could probably be done without too many issues, but what really worries me is where and how to place the search box (and have it behave properly relative to all the other UI elements in different resolutions, on mobile, etc).. Could it perhaps be treated exactly like a navigation item (just like e.g. \"About\" and \"Sample posts\" in your demo site)?. Haha those pesky users :) \nI really think it would add a lot of value even without all those features. I can handle the great responsibility of putting it first in navigation.yml, and if the screen is small enough that it gets inside the hamburger, so be it.... Clearly understood. What if you just throw it in in the most basic way as an optional element in navigation.yml? It won't be there by default so people who aren't quick to override theme defaults and edit yml files won't have anything to complain about.... @igoratencompass too hidden/remote IMHO. People are used to have the search box at the top (e.g. Google, or even the popular WP themes). Also, that's where the author pane is, seems out of place to be adjacent to the search box.... @igoratencompass good point. Perhaps putting it above the author div could be a good idea too.. @mmistakes what do you want to do about this one? As I stated above IMHO this could be downgraded to a simple UI placeholder (as discussed above) where one would configure one's own search on one's own.. What about just a Google site search box and be done with it? It's global and simple enough.... What site today isn't indexed well with Google??? And I think Google haters are a very small minority (heck, I work for Microsoft and I just suggested it, but a Bing box would be cool too \ud83d\ude09). \nLike you said before, this theme is for the average/common user. Presumably that user just wants a search box that works with no extra effort. More advanced users can fork / customize and deal with the JSON search issues (which I'm sure get much worse when you get to a certain size that the client simply can't handle).. haha I hear you! \nIMHO you could just add some notice to the docs for enabling the search box, something like: \"note it may take a few days for Google to index your site properly. To force a crawl, go to WebMaster tools\".. IMHO having a separate dedicated search page is cool, but doesn't really replace a search bar that is just always there. I don't think I an come up with a single site that has a search page but no search bar.... @mmistakes but the <script> element is async.... Is staticman used for non-comment features? If not, I would argue that the indentation is correct but the usage (site.staticman) is not.... Fair enough, though I still think it makes more sense to replace say GitLab with SourceForge (kind of annoying they don't have a Font Awesome icon though).. Great stuff. BTW what is the difference between this and type-size-X?. Ah, I see. So if one wants to make everything smaller categorically across the entire site, indeed it makes sense to alter the base pixel size as above, rather than change all the multipliers.... @MV10 try running a batch file (bat) with a BOM in CMD...\nThat BOM inserted by VS is pretty annoying.. What's the difference between TOC and this? Couldn't you have the same exact behavior as TOC, only with user-supplied entries/links (you could even lock it down to a single list of links if it makes it easier to handle)?. > What happens when someone defines a sidebar and a TOC?\nAs Bjarne Stroustrup would put it, \"undefined behavior\". Or, if you can identify such a case, simply pick one and only display that. Not all features must coexist, certainly if the alternative is simply not to have one of them...\nCan you implement the same hack you did for the TOC for such a right-handed sidebar?. @mmistakes should I keep bumping this so the stale bot doesn't close it? Even if you don't plan on implementing it someone else might (I'm being hopeful I know :]).... If we agree that the official WordPress \"Twenty-x\" themes are designed for the majority (presumably WordPress are data-driven), then the right sidebar is integral: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/.. Well, you have put yourself in a bind by supporting TOC on the exact same space, so now you can't say it's bloated :) No good deed...\nSeriously though, I don't think a couple of \"recommended\" posts would be clutter, and it would be configurable anyway (just like navigation.yml, so maybe sidebar.yml). To my mind its purpose is different enough from the author sidebar to be justified.. Last time I checked the only serious gem-based blog themes out there were MM and Minima. The latter was too minimalistic so IMHO MM really is the only serious choice out there (unless something drastic changed in the last 1-2 months). Congrats :)\nAs you probably already know I'm a big fan of gem upgrades which is why I'm not going to fork the theme, rather try and contribute / convince you. Emphasis on try :). Yeah and I probably went over all of them, if memory serves very few (if any) even came close to the level of maturity and features of MM. Again, congrats \ud83d\udcaf . How would you recommend I go about hacking this on my site? Basically I'd like the least amount of overrides and the greatest degree of gem upgradability while adding a modified right sidebar that would probably end up looking like this:\nhtml\n<aside class=\"sidebar__right\">\n    <nav class=\"toc\">\n        <header>\n            <h4 class=\"nav__title\">Featured Posts</h4>\n        </header>\n        <ul class=\"toc__menu\">\n            <li><a href=\"/2017/01/foo/\">Featured Post 1</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"/2016/02/bar/\">Featured Post 2</a></li>\n            <!-- ... -->\n        </ul>\n    </nav>\n</aside>. Thank you Michael for your advice. I gave it some thought and I have two issues with it:\n1. I want the featured posts to be present on all pages, including the home page, categories page, etc.\n1. If single.html does change one day, I won't know about it.\nSo I guess I'll try my go-to move of adding a script that adds it dynamically to the page. Something like $(\"section.page__content\", \"div.archive\").first().prepend('<aside class=\"sidebar__right\"></aside>').load(\"_includes/featured-posts.html\"). Does that seem reasonable?\nOne more thing I want to do is disable it on mobile/small displays. Basically have the same condition you currently have that determines whether the TOC is displayed on the right or below the title, except that I'll remove it completely. How would you recommend I go about that (preferably in a gem upgrade safe way)?. Good catch on the _includes file. I guess I could create a dummy page with the featured posts HTML and change the load call to something like .load(\"featured-posts.html nav.toc\") (that is, only load the nav element from the compiled dummy page).\nAs for the mobile adjustment, if I understand correctly all I have to do in order to get the same condition is add some featured-post class to my featured posts element and add something like this in my main.scss:\nscss\n.featured-post {\n    display: none\n    @include breakpoint($large) {\n      display: block;\n    }\n  }. @exetico In the end Michael's arguments convinced me I could do without such a featured posts section and instead I added some stuff to the author pane. \nHowever, before that happened I did have some sort of POC in place which you can check out here: https://gitlab.com/ohadschn/ohadschn.gitlab.io/commit/e851074863e069ba8b0a912ec80309ec3d1d6916.. My bad, thank you for clarifying.\nCould you release a new gem version so I can update my CI with error_mode: strict?. Fair point, I guess I could just take the current master tip (https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/2080469952cbde9325dfbb721f5b33b0612d243d).\nMay I ask what is holding you from releasing a new version, and whether you have some estimation on when a new version would be released? Perhaps I'll wait too :). Ah yes, those pesky things :)\nLet me rephrase - do you see any reason not to take the current master tip (https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/commit/2080469952cbde9325dfbb721f5b33b0612d243d)?. Fair enough. Can you somehow enable it on your personal builds so that compilation warnings don't creep in in the future?. I suggest GitLab pages, which support plugins out of the box (they can be made to work in GH pages too but it's more involved).\nYou can fork my repo for a fully working Minimal Mistakes blog: https://gitlab.com/ohadschn/ohadschn.gitlab.io/. I didn't see any direct Kramdown solution, but it does let you set custom attributes on images so something like this works: ![foobar]({{ '/foo/bar.png' | absolute_url }}){:.image-popup href=\"{{ 'foo/bar.png' | absolute_url }}\"} (yes, I am adding href to an img element, a hack to make the lightbox work).\nOf course, that's even worse than the vanilla form above, but with a little jQuery to apply the attributes automatically it should be simple to achieve automatically:\njs\n$('.page__content img')\n    .addClass('image-popup')\n    .attr('href', function() { return $(this).attr(\"src\") });\nWhat do you think?. Yeah I agree (for example what if I wanted my image to link to something else entirely), just wanted to run my solution by you.. However now that I think about it would be really cool if I could say ![foobar]({{ '/foo/bar.png' | absolute_url }}){:.image-popup\"} and in your _main.js you would just add the href if missing.... Well if scripts were included from a different origin, it would provide a better debugging experience should something go wrong. Currently it seems like only one script is loaded and it's from the same origin (main.min.js) but I suppose that could change (I've already suggested such a change here: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1238).. It just allows him to get more information should some error occur and either debug the issue himself or post a more meaningful issue here. Debuggability is important, and in this case it's pretty much free (just add an attribute).. Also, getting jquery (and any other external dependency really) from a CDN rather than minifying it inside main.min.js would probably increase performance (and reduce hosting costs), both due to the CDN hosting and browser download parallelization.. Override _includes/scripts.html and do what? I can already have my script included before main.min.js using footer/custom.html as I mentioned above. The problem is that I don't have jQuery. I suppose I could include it again (before my script) but that seems rather wasteful...\nRegarding CDN, I took a quick look in SO in it doesn't seem like much of a debate... the overwhelming majority of answers and upvotes are clearly in favor of a CDN. It is especially recommended since HTTP/2 due to caching improvements.. I could add my script after main.min.js and add the magnificPopup() setup but I don't like it as much due to the lightbox setup duplication (~25 lines), especially if it ever changes in future versions. How about a compromise - could you expose some sort of event (simplest would probably be a jQuery custom event before the _main.js code executes?\nRegarding CDN, I totally agree with your sentiment but I disagree with your premise. I would wager that if asked, the vast majority of your users would prefer the clear performance and cost improvements over the extremely slim chance that the Google CDN goes down but their site doesn't.\nSo I think the equation should be flipped - only extremely paranoid or savvy users with very specific scenarios (like firewalls that don't have CDNs allowed) would fork the theme. To most laymen, this is an easy, no-brainer win (the SO votes seem to strongly support this of thought).... That article suggests it only has that CDN power if configured correctly (in the case of custom sub-domains). It also doesn't address parallelization and optimized caching. And by the same token performance is not considered, I would posit that dependency on something like the Google CDN isn't either... \nSo given two presumably equally irrelevant options, why not take the one with the improved experience?. BTW GitHub pages is probably a much bigger dependency than Google CDN.... Good stuff! So a custom footer_scripts with functionality  equivalent to the out-of-the-box one would look like this (going by the uglify script)?\nyaml\nfooter_scripts:\n  - /assets/js/vendor/jquery/jquery-1.12.4.min.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.fitvids.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.greedy-navigation.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.magnific-popup.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.smooth-scroll.min.js\n  - /assets/js/_main.js\n. Great, so now anyone could do this to get a CDN-equivalent:\n```yaml\nfooter_scripts:\n  - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js\n  - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fitvids/1.2.0/jquery.fitvids.min.js\n  - /assets/js/plugins/jquery.greedy-navigation.js # didn't see a CDN for this\n  - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/magnific-popup.js/0.9.9/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js\n  - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-smooth-scroll/1.7.2/jquery.smooth-scroll.min.js\n- insert whatever custom script here to run before main\n\n/assets/js/_main.js\n\n- insert whatever custom script here to run after main\n```\nBTW, regarding the versions:\n jQuery - I guess you're using 1.x for IE6-8 support? \n jquery.fitvids.js - latest is 1.2.0 (MM is using 1.1)\n jquery.greedy-navigation.js - looks like a couple of small updates have been made (I diffed the MM version with the one currently on master)\n magnific-popup - latest is 1.1.0 (MM is using 0.9.9)\n* jquery-smooth-scroll - latest is 2.2.0 (MM is using 1.7.2). Sure, was just wondering.\nShould I open an issue for package update?\nIf so, one issue or issue per package?. Cool! Could you throw me a hint on which of these I should be OK with upgrading in my override?. Understood. Thanks again for this. I guess I'll just follow the versions in the theme for now (simple enough to diff and update when a new release is out).. Just a thought, maybe you could include something like main-only.min.js (a minified version of _main.js only without jQuery and plugins) which could be used in the custom footer scripts approach rather than the \"development-flavor\" _main.js?. I added main-noplugins.min.js to source control because that appears to be the convention, but I think ideally generated files shouldn't reside in the source control. I know very little about Ruby, but according to the docs, perhaps the RakeFile would be the most reasonable place to put the uglifyjs command?. Feel free to name it anything you want, I'm not in love with the name either :) As long as I have a file I can efficiently include in my footer script I'll be happy.\nSeeing as the new footer script feature will prevent the inclusion of the main.min.js, and seeing as how users might want to use jQuery etc. in their custom scripts which would necessitate their separate inclusion, this would be a perfect fit.\nIMHO literally less than one line of code that creates some files that as you said most people won't care about is not much of an added complexity... . Yeah I suppose you are right about adding it to the CI, should be pretty trivial to add something like:\nbash\nuglifyjs \"$(bundle show minimal-mistakes-jekyll)/assets/js/_main.js\" -c -m \\\n         -o assets/js/main-unbundled.min.js \n(hope you like the new name)\nHowever I decided to stick with the full main.min.js for now so I don't have to worry about adding/removing/changing plugins on upgrades.. Fair enough. If you ever reconsider, integrating these improvements (possibly configurable/parametrized) into GreedyNav would allow for a better upgrade story and CDN support.. @annegentle Using Netlify for HTTPS doesn't really make a difference, the JS could still come from any CDN (e.g. CloudFlare). I guess you could say it's redundant but really won't make much of a difference.\nI think splitting the script includes (which you would do when you add the CDN) actually would make your life easier, because with one main.min.js you can only put your scripts before it or after it. But you might want to put your scripts ina  more subtle location, e.g. before the main site code but after the jQuery include (example: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1238). \nNote that so far you are only proving my initial argument - only advanced, specialized users would even care where their JS files are coming from. The rest (vast majority) would simply enjoy the increased performance and reduced server load.\nBTW I don't understand why you think extracting JS dependencies to a CDN would break anything. Basically the entire internet is doing it, it works great.. @annegentle sounds to me like a CDN would have actually made debugging easier, because it would have narrowed down the script where the error originated, rather than \"something happened in main.min.js\".\nYou just need to set the crossOrigin attribute on the CDN script tag.. FYI, you can get HTTPS on GitHub pages with a custom domain using CloudFlare. \nHaving said that, I still recommenced GitLab due to its gem-based theme support. You can see how I implemented it here: https://gitlab.com/ohadschn/ohadschn.gitlab.io/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml.. @asarkar well to be fair Netlify is not open source so you don't know how many bugs they would have had open.... @asarkar agreed. And to be honest I can't say the same about GitLab, where it seems they largely ignore user issues, or at best respond after quite a few days (in this case with not a really helpful response). Still, I'm happy with what they offer so far, so to each his own.... I agree that automatic generation would be the holy grail, but like you said Jekyll doesn't support it yet and extra plugins or tooling might complicate things.\nWhat I'm suggesting is a manual approach where the user adds the YAML variables I mentioned above, and creates the scaled image sets himself. Sure that adds a bit more maintenance, but users who don't use this feature will not be affected. \nMy use case, which should be a fairly common one going by the WordPress theme, is a single header image that's present in all blog pages. It would be a simple one-time matter to create a few scaled versions of it and configure them in the YAML.. The only thing I disagree with is your all-or-nothing approach. If you have a low hanging fruit case you can handle (don't know if header images can be classified as such) I think it's totally cool, and no further \"expectations\" have to be assumed or accepted on your part.\nCloudinary looks really cool, I will check it out. I knew CloudFlare were doing this but not on the free tier. Looks like a bunch of Israeli guys too, maybe I'll get special treatment ;). So in case anyone is interested, here's how you use Cloudinary with header (hero) images:\n\nSign up to Cloudinary and upload your image of choice (highest quality you have)\nRemove existing header image definitions from your _config.yml\nAdd the following to your _config.yml:\n```yml\nfooter_scripts:\n/assets/js/main.min.js\nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cloudinary-core/2.3.0/cloudinary-core-shrinkwrap.min.js\n/assets/js/images.js\n```\nCreate /assets/js/images.js with the following content:\n```js\nvar cl = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new({cloud_name: \"YOUR_CLOUD_NAME\"});\nvar img = cl.image(\"YOUR_IMAGE_NAME\", \n{ \n    width: \"auto\", \n    dpr: \"auto\", \n    responsive: \"true\",\n    crop: \"scale\", \n    responsive_placeholder: \"blank\"\n});\n$(img).addClass(\"page__hero-image\");\n\n$heroDiv = $('');\n$heroDiv.append(img);\n$heroDiv.insertAfter(\".masthead\");\ncl.responsive();\n``\n(substitutingYOUR_CLOUD_NAMEandYOUR_IMAGE_NAME` with the proper Cloudinary values)\n@mmistakes looks OK?. https://help.github.com/articles/unpublishing-a-user-pages-site/\n\nUnpublishing a User Pages site\nYou may want to unpublish your GitHub User Pages site if the content is no longer relevant or you no longer want it to be publicly available.\nTo unpublish your User Pages site, delete the master branch or delete your username.github.io repository\n\nOr just make a simple e-mail filtering rule.... @sfdye not sure what your e-mail provider is, but usually (GMail, Exchange, etc) you can set filters on the server side (so no need to set it up on multiple clients).. Wow, nice!!. This is like the Hanukkah Miracle all over again!. Do you guys have a live demo for this?. Nice!\nApologies for my laziness, I should have checked your sample post list - comprehensive as always :). I haven't updated it in a long time, but my blog is on gitlab with this theme: https://gitlab.com/ohadschn/ohadschn.gitlab.io.

I know, that's exactly what I answered on that very same SO thread :) Just thought you'd might want to support it, but I suppose there's really no need, any CDN today would have HTTPS.... Yeah I had the same concern, theoretically https://github.com/mmistakes//minimal-mistakes works too. I think even https://github.com/mmistakes://minimal-mistakes could work but since Liquid doesn't contain any startswith method that I can tell, not much can be done anyway..

Liquid is barfing on your {% video %} tag because it doesn't know what it is.\nAh indeed, somehow I got it mixed up, I thought the problem was <video/>, perhaps I forgot to remove a {% video ... %} and didn't notice. Nice.\n\nThat Octopress plugin is a good solution if you don't host on GitHub. \n\nYes, I'm hosting else-where and anyway I'm just pushing the rendered HTML, so the plugin is transparent.\n. Oh, I managed! It seems that I have to use @include instead:\n.site-name {\n    @include grid(12,10);\n    @include prefix(12,1);\n    @include suffix(12,1);\n    @include font-rem(24);\n    @include hidden;\n    float: none;\n    margin-bottom: 1em;\n    @media #{$small} {\n        @include grid(12,2);\n        @include prefix(12,0.5);\n        @include suffix(12,0.5);\n        @include font-rem(16);\n    }\n    @media #{$x-large} {\n      @include shown;\n        @include grid(12,1.5);\n        @include prefix(12,2);\n    }\n}\nWhere I add the mixin shown to be the opposite of hidden.\n. Sorry, I have a follow-up question. Often it seems random which CSS is picked up and which not. I have a button which has to have opposite visibility as above. So I added to page.scss:\n.news-btn {\n  color: red;\n  @media #{$x-large} {\n    @include hidden;\n  }\n}\nAnd then at the use-site\n<a markdown=\"0\" href=\"/index.html\" class=\"btn news-btn\">News</a>\nBut the button neither is red nor hidden. Am I doing something wrong? Does it matter whether I add CSS rules to page.scss, elements.scss or any other file in _sass? \n. Nevermind, Firefox cache invalidation problem. D'oh\n. How do you prioritise the rules? For example, I have a general rule for a { ... }, and then I have a class .btn-news { ... }, and apparently the former overrides the latter (although intuitively that shouldn't be the case, because a class is more specific than an element type, no?)\n. Yes, sorry to bother you, I know it's a more general problem than minimal-mistakes. I'm just learning how frustrating it is to chase these bugs. Both Firefox and Chromium show me that there is a final #FFF white color but fail to tell me how it comes into being. There is simply no rule that I can see being responsible for my visited button to have white foreground colour when the rule it totally unambiguous:\n.btn {\n  ...\n  &:visited {\n    color: $black;\n  }\n}\n\n. Ok, so the problem is with Jekyll not having a dedicated localhost mode. So I have this in _config.yml:\n```\nurl:              http://localhost:4000\nurl:              http://www.sciss.de/_testsite\n```\nAlternating between the two when I test against desktop and iphone. Apparently the CSS locations are also absolute towards the URL, so while I can refresh the localhost page, if the URL is still remote, the CSS is taken from remote, too, resulting in ignoring the last local version. So I have to always double-check that I use localhost during adjustments.\n. Perfect, toc_levels: 1..3 works for me.\n. Ok, thanks for the hint with .htaccess, might look into it. I get it mostly to work with the above META additions, but not 100% reliably it seems.\n. It would probably be good to include this patch, I had done a similar thing a while back and suspect more people have to edit those files. Would be better to stay in sync with upstream.\n. I'm having this problem, I don't know what's going on. I checked bundle install and it lists\nUsing jekyll-feed 0.9.2\n\nAnd in _config.yml I do have the defaults:\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-feed\n  ...\n\nBut there is no feed.xml generated in _site. Any ideas? . So I browsed a bit, saw this and got the idea that I should use gems instead of plugins. So I added\ngems:\n  - jekyll-feed\n\nNow it works. What is the difference between plugins and gems?. Hmmm. No it's Jekyll 3.7.0. Strangely it outputs this warning when serving:\n\nDeprecation: The 'gems' configuration option has been renamed to 'plugins'. Please update your config file accordingly.\n\nNevertheless, if I use plugins and no gems, the feed.xml disappears. Perhaps it's a bug in the plugin.. Yes, bundle exec jekyll serve. Here is the contents of Gemfile.lock: https://gist.github.com/Sciss/672703625f3067741c4d3ee9ac4feca4\nLooks all normal to me? Although I don't understand yet, why the gems have to be specified twice, once in minimal-mistakes-jekyll.gemspec and the second time in _config.yml.. So I see that the 3.x versions still build, but that the old layout with nice font etc. stopped at 2.2.1.\nIs there any severe problem with 2.2.1 that should keep me from using that version? (Like incompatibility with mobile devices, security issues, ...)?. Thanks!. Adding this to the front matter of texts/installation.md makes it work again:\npermalink: /texts/installation.html\n\n. Thank you; I could use collections now. It's worth noting - perhaps you can add that info to the guide - that lunr breaks if you use a number as a tag. I had this:\ntags: [installation, 2015]\n\nand this causes a JavaScript error t.toLowerCase is not a function. Changing to\ntags: [installation, \"2015\"]\n\nmakes it work.. Yes, sorry, I don't know where I got that from; I double-checked, and also merged all upstream, so it's still in 4.9.0. Is there a switch or flag to completely disable the popup menu on desktop? I would actually prefer that.. No, it's still there even when search is disabled.. Perhaps using left justification instead of centering would alleviate it a bit?. @coliff that hides the menu forever, so menu items become inaccessible when the window is too narrow\nThis hack solves part of it:\ndiff --git a/_includes/masthead.html b/_includes/masthead.html\nindex 85dd462..29e9eea 100644\n--- a/_includes/masthead.html\n+++ b/_includes/masthead.html\n@@ -22,7 +22,7 @@\n           </svg>\n         </button>\n         {% endif %}\n-        <button class=\"greedy-nav__toggle\" type=\"button\">\n+        <button class=\"greedy-nav__toggle hidden\" type=\"button\">\n           <span class=\"visually-hidden\">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].menu_label | default: \"Toggle Menu\" }}</span>\n           <div class=\"navicon\"></div>\n         </button>\nSo that the menu button is initially hidden. The flicker comes back when the menu is needed, butg at least it alleviates the problem. A better solution is probably to allocate a fixed size for the menu button.. Brilliant that works (https://github.com/Sciss/minimal-mistakes/commit/7b7970ed7db2ab81798d09540c35782af2e45a5d). Thanks so much!. Solved. Needed to set\nexport JEKYLL_ENV=production\n\nBefore running bundle exec jekyll serve. Seems to be a Jekyll \"feature\" aka bug:\nhttps://github.com/Sciss/minimal-mistakes/commit/8dd779fdbc2bcefb0820ab78bee058e226aed75d\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4145\n. Have you tried something like\n```\nDefaults\ndefaults:\n  # _posts\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    value:\n      permalink: /:basename/\n```\n?. Yes, sorry it seems :basename only works for \"pages\" but not \"documents\".. Have a look at my _config.yml. I defined a new collections \"works\", with the source files being in ./_works, and using permalink: /texts/:path:output_ext worked for me, so _works/foo.md becomes /texts/foo.html. I understand you want the output to be /foo/index.html, so perhaps permalink: /:path/ would work?. It's a problem for dark colours such as GitHub. I did the following:\nhttps://github.com/Sciss/minimal-mistakes/blob/4829082dd1e619bda4d99925a7ad7c06b9f4dc4e/_sass/minimal-mistakes/skins/_sciss.scss#L26.     site.time | date: '%Y'\nThat precisely means, you only have to set time in _config.yml or, if absent, it will use the current date, thus 2018 already. Here it works, I have no time set, and it renders to 2018.. @Soumyabrata are you using current version of mm? Because I see the narrow uppercase navigation which I loved from the old version, and I would like to reenable that in current version. How did you do that?. If I want to use Fork Awesome (https://forkawesome.github.io/Fork-Awesome/get-started/), could you give me a hint which file I would have to edit to use different CDN from standard Font Awesome?. @mmistakes thank you Michael; I commented this script out and instead added the link-rel to head/custom.hml, but somehow the icons don't load. Now I also tried adding the css and fonts folders from fork-awesome directly to assets, same problem:\n\n(to test: https://www.sciss.de/ )\nthe css looks correct: https://www.sciss.de/assets/css/fork-awesome.min.css\nand the relative font URL also resolves: https://www.sciss.de/assets/fonts/forkawesome-webfont.eot\nAny idea?. So this is caused by using css classes fab and fas instead of fa. They have probably something to do with the colours? But also seem to constrain the icon size wrongly. I change now to fa. What's the reason for using fab and fas?. Thanks for the link. The reason is the upstream project decided not to add any more icons, which I think is a real crap. All the open source social media platforms such as Mastodon, Diaspora, Friendica are not represented and pull requests not accepted. The fork brings all these icons.. Good issue, I was looking at this yesterday, too. https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net/ is a good tool to see the third party cookies. In my version of MM, I already use a local copy of font awesome, and I'll have to figure out how to do the same thing with google fonts (disabled by default, but would be great to add info to the tutorial on how to get them going locally).. There is a lot of FUD and misinformation traveling through the net right now. GDPR is protecting citizens by a few basic mechanism, such as \"opt-in-by-default\" (instead of opt-out) and minimising unnecessary data production. The truth is, many plugins and libraries do unnecessarily process data. For example, many website do not effectively function if you disable js or cookies, even if they should based on their contents. There is a lot of good reasoning behind GDPR.\nIt is simply not true that WordPress becomes \"illegal\". You can audit the plugins your site is using, e.g. the cookies produced, and for the data produced, whether it allows an instance (third party or not) to create a personal data trail. In those cases, you would need to install a plugin that obtains consent of website visitors first, i.e. before creating those particular cookies. I have gone through the WP site of my partner a few days ago, and the major problem where the \"social media sharing\" buttons. They are known to be very problematic in terms of privacy. There are other ways to provide the same functionality without proactively creating data trails that allow Google, Facebook, and Twitter to track you across different sites. After removing the particular plugin, the only remaining issue was Google Fonts. It is also not true that Google Fonts are \"illegal\" as such, because there are no court cases yet that would determine that, so if people caution against Google Fonts, it is because they could be interpreted within the GDPR as producing personal data trails. I would take this as an opportunity to review how much unnecessary data is actually gathered by fairly simple websites.. You can add another liquid thing: https://github.com/Sciss/minimal-mistakes/blob/homepage2/_plugins/extlink_tag.rb\nIt works like this:\n{% extlink MIBsaal http://www.musikerinitiative-bremen.de/ %}\nYou can add CSS to .external to highlight external links differently..

Thanks again for your help!\n. @Vaguery et. al, when modifying themes like this it's a good practice to fork it and keep your own copy, including modifications, for which your actual website builds from. Here's why:\n1. Theme enhancements and bugs discovered can quickly and easily be PR'd back to the fork's upstream repo (this one).\n2. Any changes you've made to the theme itself are clearly separated from the content and specific modifications for your site.\n3. When the base theme is updated you can upgrade and apply your customizations using git rebase, which will allow you to resolve merge conflicts, keep the commit history clean (meaning your commits won't be interspersed with what's coming down from the upstream) and level up  your git-fu.\n. Thanks for providing this example. I noticed Speaker Deck hasn't been added to FA but voting is taking place here: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/1688.\n. The culprit is indeed iOS behavior and is summarized in detail by Nick Zakas. FastClick was designed to overcome the the 300ms delay for mobile touch events and seems like the wrong approach to fix this unexpected behavior. Now that we know what's causing the problem we can address it.\nHere are two workable solutions:\n- Remove or comment out L237-L241 of _navigation.scss and then npm i && npm run build:css. This is the easiest approach but, unfortunately, causes the underline animation to stop functioning both on desktop and mobile.\n- Alternatively, and as pointed out in the comments on Nick's post, one can use feature detection to determine if the browser supports touch events and, if they do, don't show the animation at all. Not showing the animation on touch devices feels like the best approach given current implementation.\n. No need, unless you want to change the breakpoint: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/330 \ud83d\ude04 \n. Confirmed fixed. Thanks for including this enhancement. Having a blast porting over from HPSTR.\n. @mmistakes need a hand with this? It'd be great to get this into the theme. Related discussion occurring here: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/issues/159. @mmistakes cool. gimme a few minutes. I'll work on it now.. > That and it's going to deprecate the configurable  separator and revert back to -. But I'm cool with that, just need to remember to add a note about that in the docs.\nThere's an open issue against the SEO tag for title separator customization: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/issues/121\nBe great if you could upvote the issue.. I took a good long look at this and reached the conclusion there's not much to gain from adding support for Jekyll SEO Tag to this theme. Here's why:\n\nMade Mistakes theme already does a good job at SEO on its own, and is a fine example of how to roll your own SEO (and that's nice to have to gain an understanding of how to do things without relying on a dependency).\nAdding the Jekyll SEO Tag will result in many exceptions to the existing documentation, both in the standard configuration as well as the multi-author support.\nThere will be namespace clashes between theme and plugin both in the config and authors.yml which, if integrated, would cause headaches and potentially break existing theme features. And I'm not sure there are enough YAML anchors in the world to address that.\nJekyll SEO Tag gem, though available for GitHub Pages sites, needs more work IMHO. I would encourage those interested in attempting to integrate it to work with the maintainers of the plugin to continue making improvements (and ideally add some namespacing of some kind).\n\nFor the adventurous using the gemified theme, you can add support for Jekyll Tag gem by doing the following:\n\n\nInstall the versioned plugin dependency to your site-level Gemfile\nshell\nbundle install gemrat\ngemrat jekyll-seo-tag\n\n\nAdd jekyll-seo-tag to the gems array in your site _config.yml\n\n\nCopy contents of theme _includes/seo.html file to _includes/head/seo.html in your site after doing:\nshell\nmkdir -p _includes/head && touch _includes/head/seo.html\n\n\nCreate a site-level _includes/seo.html with the following contents:\nliquid\n{% if site.gems contains 'jekyll-seo-tag' %}\n  {% comment %}\n    Add metadata for search engines and social networks if jekyll-seo-tag plugin is enabled\n    @see https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/ for usage instructions\n  {% endcomment %}\n  {% seo %}\n{% else %}\n  {% comment %}\n    Otherwise use custom theme override\n  {% endcomment %}\n  {% include head/seo.html %}\n{% endif %}\n\n\nAnd then follow the plugin setup and usage instructions.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude05 . \ud83d\udc4d None that I'm aware of. There're some additional JSON-LD support in the works, though, as we're seeing, mixing several different structured data formats into one plug-in can get a little hairy.. FYI https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/issues/161. This can be closed as the backing repository has been deleted.\nAnalytics can be enabled/disabled for using the --config flag as described in How I'm using Jekyll in 2016. I for one would prefer not to have any magic going on behind the scenes and would lobby for always using config overrides.\n. For those landing here and only want this one fix the theme upgrade instructions can be modified as such:\ngit remote add upstream\ngit fetch upstream\ngit cherry-pick 45f3a7a\nYou'll have some merge conflicts to resolve in _config.yml, but that should be it.\n. Look at that. And it works on WebKit Mobile. Sweet. Will close this for now since we know there are other ways to resolve\n. Outside the scope of this PR, but nonetheless useful, is a Spanish translation of the ui-text. Thanks for including that, @vg, but it probably shouldn't be part of this PR.\n. @vg tricky right! I make that mistake all the time. remembering to use branches has helped.\n. This is useful for programmers. Thanks for providing the code! Here's what it looks like:\n\n. Made a small update to change http to :// to match recent changes and updated with master. Confirmed overlay images are now pulling through to share widget as pictured below:\n\n. @mmistakes hold up.

Yoink!. Doesn't jekyll-archives accept another word for categories?\nSo, I'm not able to get it to work on a blog where I'm calling it topics instead of categories. Now I got the following set up:\nIn Gemfile\n```\nPlugins\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem 'jekyll-feed', '~> 0.6'\n  gem 'jekyll-sitemap', '~> 1.2'\n  gem 'jekyll-archives', '2.1.1'\n  gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'\nend\n```\nIn _config.yml\n```\nArchives\njekyll-archives:\n  enabled: ['topics']\n  layout: 'topics'\n  permalinks:\n    category: '/answers/topics/:name/'\n```\nAnd in a typical post:\n```\n\ntitle: How do you get the current year in Jekyll?\nlayout: default\ndate: 2018-02-17\ntopics: \n    - jekyll\n\nThis is really a Liquid template markup thing.\nHow do you get the current year in Jekyll?{:target=\"_blank\"}\n```\nWhen I serve the site, I don't see jekyll-archives working to produce a category or topic page for \"jekyll\" as site.com/answers/topics/jekyll/. Why's that? Is it just about the keyword categories or is there something else missing? . Thanks, @mmistakes so I've updated the keyword topics to categories in all post...then in my _config.yml here I'm somewhat confused, what's the right way to spell it out...I did the below which wouldn't work:\n```\nArchives\njekyll-archives:\n  enabled: \n    - categories\n  layout: 'topics'\n  permalinks:\n    category: '/answers/topics/:name/'\n  category_archive:\n    type: jekyll-archives\n    path: /answers/topics/\n```\nMy intention is to have each category/topic display as \"site.com/answers/topics/TOPICNAME\" you get the idea? Because I wanna create a page of \"Topics\" where I'll loop through all the categories and display them topics, just so the permalink is parent-child.\nThanks..

Will leave the branch intact until I end up doing more housekeeping on GH. Cheers!. > How does this affect servers not using HTTP/2\nIt doesn't negatively affect servers using HTTP1.1, they will still enjoy a performance boost as well. And, from a browser perspective, async/defer enjoys 93% support of the worlds' browsers and will have no problem for most user agents. In fact, given the widespread browser adoption, not using the async script(s) at this point would be in opposition of the Pareto principle for both the _main.js scripts as well as Google Analytics.. FYI - Updated last comment to be more explicit and informative. On more thing too, you'll probably need to do some CSS treatments for the anchor links after a little tweaking. This is just an example integration.. @mmistakes Fixing. Uno momento.. @mmistakes pushed up another commit which should fix the issue. I removed the defer attribute as I've introduced a secret sauce script which uniformly detects the page has been parsed across browsers (the reason you were seeing the undefined error).\nThis may look like magic, but it's part of the reason jQuery was invented in the first place. If you want to, you could simply move the contents of the run function into the jQuery DOMReady wrapper function and eliminate my JS-fu. I'd've done so myself but cannot, as a good dev, blindly suggest an antipattern without first showing the proper way to do it.\nI considered moving the magic into a utils folder but import (from the ES2015 spec) has zero percent adoption in 2017 and would never recommend anyone use Babel or Webpack unless they're building a single-page app.. Whoops. You'll need to run that through the minifier before running.. Updated to fix a bug with use strict (I forgot to put it in quotes) and uglified the script for ya.. I'll just close for now. Just wanted to provide a sample implementation for you to use if you wanted to add the feature (additional treatments necessary from design perspective)..

Hey @mmistakes ,\nI have actually exactly this problem. I want to \"fire up\" my server on my hosting-server and the url is overwritten by localhost. \nSo I just got it working with this workaround:\n1. Build site \n2. Fire up the server with \"--skip-initial-build\"\nAnd if I want to update the page in the future I just need to build it again.\nIt works, but seems a bit odd to me. Well I'm not a web-dev, but shouldn't it work with just firing up the server?. Updated to use HTTPs by default. My understanding is that HTTPS sites will not pass referrer info back to non-HTTPs. If so, oh well? \ud83d\ude3a . Thanks for replying that quick!\nAlright, so I'm going to implement it on my own.. :)\nOr do you plan to integrate them into the theme in the future as well?. Ok, thanks again.\nGood luck! \ud83d\ude09 . @mmistakes just an observation. i'm not sure I'm going to be able to find that pull I was looking for now ^^. Signal v. Noise. I'm moving to the ChangeLog instead. Perhaps Eduardo or contributor could use a label for automated PR to aid in filtering them out.\n\n. > If you ask me, the real noise comes more from the mistaken PR's every time someone new to Git tries to update their blog with this theme.\nI've been noticing a bit of that lately both on themes and repos in general which attract newcomers. I wonder if there's an opportunity for GH to surface an option for help mitigate that behavior now on the horizon. Their support team is fairly responsive last time I shot them a note via the interface. They don't share their roadmaps publicly (I asked), but they may be able to provide some alternatives to help you focus on your craft.. Right on. By the way, found what I was looking for.

Checking CSS4 specs for a single rule to handle this. In 2017 we should have a simple way to do this, right?\nEDIT: Reviewed CSS 4 Working Draft and came up Nil. The word \"accessibility\" isn't even found in the top level page of the spec. Only other thing I can think of is the use of media queries, e.g.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html#aural-media-group. Also, not intending to \"start a review\". So sorry about that.... > The menu doesn't currently close when clicking outside of the drop down nav.\nChrome has some kind of assist behavior to close popovers triggered when clicking outside the popover region. I noticed it while creating a popover toolbar. Rather than trying to delegate and capture all click events at the documentElement I found it easier to simply collapse the popups when the user starts scrolling. IMO it's a Chrome bug but most would call it a feature. There are some new selectors coming in like :focus-within which should help this long time issue on the Web.. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumb-navigation-useful/\nThis is probably one of the most authoritative references on the Web Re: breadcrumb design. According to Jacob even 12 years ago people were already starting to get banner blindness from them, they don't support poly-hierarchies and, well, forward to today and we're a lot more reliant on search and quick uptake. I wouldn't be surprised if even Amazon removed them tomorrow personally.. Like this? https://codepen.io/sashatran/pen/rPaLgG. @mmistakes see https://inclusive-components.design/a-theme-switcher/. That said I see this as a passing fad. Everyone scrambling to add a light/dark mode to their themes when the OS + browser should be responsible for this behavior.. I agree it's up to the site to control how it looks, but feel the toggle needs to be elsewhere which it seems like macOS is moving wards with Mojave as illustrated by @paulmillr here: https://paulmillr.com/posts/using-dark-mode-in-css/.

I\u2019ve found that Jekyll will just stop working\nsometimes when a gem is updated because they don\u2019t always respect how\nWindows deals with paths.\nAlso recently I\u2019ve noticed that doing builds and running the server with jekyll\nbuild or jekyll serve doesn\u2019t work reliably. You need to prepend them\nwith a Bundler exec command.\nAs noted by Bundler on bundler.io\nIn some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the\nexecutable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any\ngems that conflict with your bundle.\nHowever, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even\nif it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another\nmachine.\nWhat I would try is bundle exec jekyll build\nIf that still produces errors update all your gems with bundle update.\nYou\u2019re using an older version of Jekyll (it\u2019s up to 2.5.3 now I believe)\nYou\u2019ll probably still have to do bundle exec jekyll build to run it\nsuccessfully though.\nHope this helps. If not hit up the Jekyll repo\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues. This issue is quite common for\nWindows users and the guys maintaining Jekyll are more suited to answer\nthese sort of questions.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/105#issuecomment-64593472\n.\n. \n",
    "pricelessbrewing": "Thanks, I had the spaces after the variables but it kept giving me a error at line # column # where the space was when github tried to build the website. \nThe owner: text was probably the worst offender, and explains why I was having so many problems. \n. Pushed the fixes to github. Disqus is loading now! Thanks!\n. Awesome thanks. I imagine the url: was also why the link in the top left referred back to the current page instead of the homepage?\nAs an aside about how github works, I usually edit the files directly so when I have to push an update to an existing page. Is there a way to manually push an update, or does it do so automatically?\nPushed the update, link in the top left now works. Image shows up on the post but when shared using the Open Graph debugger it still displays the author image and gives this possible error. \nInferred Property   The 'og:image' property should be explicitly provided, even if a value can be inferred from other tags.\n. Gotcha. Thanks again, any ideas on the open graph error?\nInferred Property The 'og:image' property should be explicitly provided, even if a value can be inferred from other tags.\nLooks like it might need a new meta tag for the og:image? Also the Twitter card is \n\n is missing all together which is probably the problem. \nI should be able to just add  to the _site/index.html file and that should work for all the posts, but I'd like to be able to set each post/page to have their own preview image however if I add it to the actual page.md it throws an error as it's not in the html header. \nSorry to keep bothering you, just don't know what to do.\n. Thanks again, I swapped that back. Also this is all pointless since I didn't bother to check your _includes/_open-graph.html for an update. You did so a couple months ago, and added support for page/post specific og:image 's. Should be good I hope now. \nIs there a way to have a og: image for the preview, but not have it on the actual post?\n. Quite strange. I opened it in chrome and IE and it's working as intended.

It looks good.\n. Thank you! It will be really great, if Jekyll supports date formatting natively.. I have to admit, that I have found one mistake in russian \"read time\". In case of exactly \"1 minute read\" there is not right ending in russian text \"1 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442(\u044b) \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\".

So, there are 3 case:\n- \"1 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\n- \"\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 1 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\n- \"\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 2 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\nBut option minute_read : \"\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442(\u0430\u044b) \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\" looks not good. May be the better way is to use abbreviations for minute \"\u043c\u0438\u043d\" like this:\nless_than                  : \"\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435\"\n  minute_read                : \"\u043c\u0438\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"\nAdditionally, I think to change less_than : \"\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435\" to less_than : \"\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435\".\nI'm sorry for the confusion..

It's entirely possible that any of the many changes you made fixed\nit, but if you're testing by sharing the same URL over and over again it's\ngoing to show the cached version no matter what you do.\nI don't know how long it holds onto the cache or if there is a way to\nforce it to use the new content on page.

When you share a URL thru Google+ it pulls\ncontent right then from the page to put use. If the page has previously\nbeen shared it will use what it has cached.

Oh that's interesting.\n. I fixed it. I added this code the the if statements in the top 5 lines of the files in _layouts\n\nitemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Article\"\nI also modified the _includes/_open-graph.hrml file and added this code at the top of the file\n<!-- Google Plus -->\n<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"{% if page.title %}{{ page.title }}{% else %}{{ site.title }}{% endif %}\">\n<meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"{{ page.excerpt | strip_html }}\">\n{% if page.image.feature %}\n<meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"{{ site.url }}/images/{{ page.image.feature }}\">\n{% else %}\n<meta itemprop=\"image\"  content=\"{% if page.image.thumb %}{{ site.url }}/images/{{ page.image.thumb }}{% else %}{{ site.url }}/images/default-thumb.png{% endif %}\">\n{% endif %}\nThen the magic fix that may or may not make the above changes necessary is that Google+ will ignore most/all of the meta data randomly if the image it grabs is outside a certain aspect ratio. I had a 19:5 aspect ratio at 1900x500 pixels. Once I changed it to a 5:2 ratio at 1900x760 pixels the sharing seems to work on all articles now. If you want to verify just the image size change on the site you tested with, and let me know if that works, I'd greatly appreciate it. Avoiding Schema changes would be nice if possible.\nThanks for all the help!\n. I tested it without the Schema.org stuff. Doesn't always work. I can create a pull request for that if you want me to add it. I made just enough changes to fix the Google+ snippet without screwing with other social network sharing.\n.

    "frankhecker": "Thanks, this is very helpful!\n. OK, I think I got this to work; the results of my test are at http://civilityandtruth.com/2013/12/10/the-inner-arbor-plan-takes-shape-part-7/\nNote that I changed one line of what you wrote above; in the _head.html file I used the line below, eliminating the extra pairs of enclosing braces:\n<script src=\"{{ site.url }}/assets/js/vendor/picturefill.min.js\"></script>\nAfter doing this test and thinking about it some more, I'm concluding that the full responsive images approach is likely overkill for what I need. The standard pattern I have is including a \"regular\" size image displayed along with the text content, with that image then linking to the full high-resolution 3000 (or whatever) pixel wide image for people who want to see that. For my purposes I think it's simpler to just have two sizes of image, the original 3000 pixel wide image to link to and a smaller 600 pixel wide version to include with the content. Using the smaller version decreases the image size by almost 15x, and the smaller version looks reasonably good on my iPhone and iPad and when resizing the page on my Mac.\nBut in any case again thanks very much for your help; you got me unstuck. I'm closing this issue.\nP,S, for anyone else who might be interested in this topic: In the file _sass/variables.scss there is a set of five breakpoints defined (from \"micro\" to \"x-large\") that might provide useful guidelines when setting the picture presets in _config.yml. I didn't really look at trying to use those though, in large part because I wasn't sure exactly what width those breakpoints were referencing, and also because I wasn't sure how to use em units in the context of jekyll-picture-tag.\n. Update: The problem appears to be somewhere in main.min.js. If I modify assets/js on my staging server to replace the new MM 4.15.2 version of main.min.js with the old MM 4.12.0 then the problem goes away (after clearing browser cache and reloading the page in question). Similarly, if I replace the old 4.12.0 version of main.min.js on my production server with the new 4.15.2 version, the problem occurs (again, after clearing browser cache and reloading the page).\nIf I have time later I'll try to narrow down which line(s) in main.min.js appear to be causing the problem.\n. Update 2: I've narrowed this down further, by forcing use of a particular version of MM in the Gemfile on my staging server (frankhecker.net), doing a bundle update, regenerating the entire site from scratch, and then using the test page linked to above. (I don't use incremental update because in the past I've had problems with one of the plugins when I do that.)\nI've determined that 4.14.2 is the last version for which footnote links work properly. Apparently one of the changes introduced in main.min.js for 4.15.0 broke footnote links.\nI don't have time right now to debug this further. For now I'm going to stay on 4.14.2 until/unless someone finds a fix for this.\nP.S. That means the test page above will not show the incorrect behavior. You can see it yourself by creating a page using Markdown footnote links and then generating it both in 4.14.2 and 4.15.0.. The change you made appears to fix the problem with footnotes, at least on the browsers I tested: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari for MacOS (for versions see above) and Safari on iOS 12.1.4.\nHowever I will note that on Chrome scrolling to the footnote and from the footnote back to the original test seems slower than normal with the fix; there is a noticeable lag until scrolling starts. (I didn't notice any substantial difference with the other browsers.)\nThanks for working on this!. I don't know if you were asking me or edemaine to test, but anyway: I did a bundle update and am now at \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll 4.15.2 from https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git (at smooth-scroll-gumshoe@28ee259)\". I regenerated my staging server site at frankhecker.net and checked the footnote functionality; it appears to be working correctly, and scrolling is nice and responsive on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.\nI don't have any blog posts with a TOC, so can't test that..

But I would personally prefer to have the default $paragraph-indent: off since most of my paragraphs are short. Who writes long paragraphs anymore ;)\n. What I'm writing about here is that I copied the markdown for the table from\nminimal-mistakes/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2011-03-10-sample-post.md\nand it doesn't display the same way as the demo site.\nI shouldn't need to change the CSS to get the same result, right?\n. I am very excited to make use of the new features, and I'm very grateful to Mike for leading the way.\nBut I realize there is complexity to upgrade. \nPast experience tells me that several attempts is necessary to upgrade smoothly.\nI won't be able to tweak a few settings and call it good because I have a live site in the old way.\nFor this reason I am building a repeatable approach so I can experiment various tries at upgrade.\nInitially I created a shell script to download Mike's test-data repo and copy that on top of the minimal-mistakes theme files. \nI'm using clone because I'm having problems getting the download to unzip since its folder contains a random code.\nThe initial attempt is at:\nhttps://gist.github.com/wilsonmar/e2a146402ecd964100c9020127c605fd\nrepeated below:\n```\n!/bin/bash\ngetitfresh.sh in ~/gits folder\nreset theme from original by Michael Rose:\nRun this from any folder:\nTested on Mac OSX El Capitan.\n\nset -x #echo on\ncd ~/gits/jekyll\nrm -rf minimal-mistakes\nclone all history and branches:\ngit clone http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\ncurl -L -o minimal-mistakes-master.zip http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/zipball/master/\nunzip minimal-mistakes-master.zip -d /minimal-mistakes\nrm minimal-mistakes-master.zip\nrm -rf jekyll-theme-unit-test\ngit clone http://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-unit-test.git\ncurl -L -o jekyll-theme-unit-test-master.zip http://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-unit-test/zipball/master/\nunzip jekyll-theme-unit-test-master.zip -d /jekyll-theme-unit-test2\nrm jekyll-theme-unit-test-master.zip\ncp -Rf jekyll-theme-unit-test/* minimal-mistakes/ \ncd minimal-mistakes\nbundle\npython -mwebbrowser http://localhost:4000\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\nTo this I may need to write a program to scan through existing files to generate a combined file.\n. Submodules would involve using hooks as well. Not too difficult but may be scary. My question is whether it's better to put the theme in the sub-module rather than content in a sub-module, as the article suggests.\n. Agreed. That's why for now I'm focusing on a bash script to download a theme, and populate it with demo data. Once that works, I'll overlay with my own folder of files instead of your demo files. But I'm stuck on errors after overlaying with your demo data.\n. Here is my approach \n1. git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes  mymm\n2. bundle the folder\n3. git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes-demo\n4. Copy demo files over the template:\n   cp -r ./minimal-mistakes-demo ./mymm\n   (in the future, I'll move from folder containing my files)\n5. bundle exec jekyll serve\nThis results in this error message:\n```\n  Liquid Exception: The included file '/Users/mac/gits/jekyll/minimal-mistakes/_includes/feature-row' should exist and should not be a symlink in minimal-mistakes-demo/_pages/splash-page.md\njekyll 3.0.3 | Error:  The included file '/Users/mac/gits/jekyll/minimal-mistakes/_includes/feature-row' should exist and should not be a symlink\n```\n.

    "johnlane": "I found the Gem-based \"quick start\" instructions did not result in a fully working install.  I found this issue logged when searching for information. I am just posting this as feedback and in case it helps others who may end up here with the same problems. Here are the steps which worked for me for a complete working install, albeit containing only one post:\nsh\n$ gem install jekyll bundler\n$ jekyll new jekyll-mm\n$ cd jekyll-mm\n$ sed -i -e 's/\"minima\".*/\"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"/' Gemfile\n$ bundle install\n$ rm _config.yml index.md about.md\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/master/_config.yml\n$ echo 'theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll' >> _config.yml\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/master/index.html\n$ sed -i -e 's/^layout: post/layout: single/' _posts/*welcome-to-jekyll.markdown\n$ jekyll serve\n\nnote espacially the neeed to add theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll to the supplied _config.yml. Without this it does not work.. For anyone looking to implement jekyll-paginate-v2 now, coming here to find the links from @douglangille are dead,  there is a compatible version of _includes/paginator.html here. I found that it offers the same behaviour as the theme's support for the default paginator.\n\nAlternatively please read the [blog post][2] by @mmistakes.\n@mmistakes you mention that you use jekyll-paginate-v2 on your own site - if your config is better (or more robust, or whatever) than that what I linked to then would you mind sharing a gist that we might use until the theme catches up? (great theme, by the way!!!)\n[2]: https://mademistakes.com/articles/using-jekyll-2017/. Ok, I read #1429 and saw you're not too keen on the complexity of the suggestion that aligns most with my question.\nHowever, I took a quick look myself and it was trivial to implement what I wanted. All I did was change _includes/page__hero.html at line 45:\n-      {% if page.header.show_overlay_excerpt != false and page.excerpt %}\n+      {% if page.strapline %}\n+        <p class=\"page__lead\">{{ page.strapline | markdownify | remove: \"<p>\" | remove: \"</p>\" }}</p>\n+      {% elsif page.header.show_overlay_excerpt != false and page.excerpt %}\nThis allows one to have an excerpt which displays on index pages that is different to a strapline that displays beneath the title on an overlay image. If there is no defined strapline then the excerpt behaviour is used instead (i.e it works as it does now).\n(I'm not fussed about terminology, just functionality; if you would prefer a different name than strapline that's fine - it's just the concept I wanted). \nWhat do you think, should I submit a PR for you ?\n. just pinging this issue due to the stale marker because I am still interested in providing this functionality.. thanks for clarifying :).

In my opinion your theme is far more suitable and compatible to store on github and the overal style and appearence is better too. \nNevertheless, one of the things I am greatly missing is the easy of use and the power of a grid system that is based on Zurb Foundation Grid component. It is super easy to construct a grid layout and fill it with any type of content you like. I recommend you adopt a similar solution for your theme. \nAnyway that is just a suggestion for further enhancements. There are other nice features I am missing from feeling-responsive.

I have committed the changes and you can view my updated version of _base.scss. I tried to test it with this post but although it does something, videos are not aligned in a row. The raw content of the post is here\nAny ideas how I can fix this, since I reached that far ?\nThank you\n.

The iframe was added  to .half and .third as you suggested above.\nThe code to achieve a responsive grid layout for youtube videos is :  \n``` html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nI have to admit that your solution is more elegant and clean although it is not generic as the one adopted in feeling-responsive theme, i.e. specifying rows and columns for the grid (see next comment). This is a screen capture using both third and half classes taken from a window 710 pixels wide.\n\n. I am stopping here. For a comparison purpose, I am posting a screen capture of how this looked like on the Phlow feeling-responsive theme. The captured image displays a 3rows x 2columns grid taken from a window 730pixels wide. I have put also the code in case you or someone else might decide to enhance your theme with a similar functionality in the near future. \nFor a start the <figure> tag will have to be renamed to something more generic e.g. gridRow and the class=\"half\" will have to be replaced with the number of elements that are next to each other in a row, i.e. 2,3,4,.. Then you repeat the gridRow to get the full grid. One can build on top of this methods to avoid repetition if the element content is the same, like your gallery module....\n\n``` html\n Set a 3rows x 2columns Grid, i.e. 2columns x 6width = 12  \n\n First Row \n\n\n\n\n<!-- Leave this cell empty -->\n<div class=\"medium-6 columns b30\"><div class=\"flex-video widescreen vimeo\">\n  <iframe        \n    frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen>\n  </iframe>\n</div></div>\n\n End of First Row \nSecond Row \n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"medium-6 columns b30\"><div class=\"flex-video widescreen vimeo\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kewwVdJpzSY\"\n    frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen>\n  </iframe>\n</div></div>\n\n End of Second Row \n Third Row \n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"medium-6 columns b30\"><div class=\"flex-video widescreen vimeo\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7qWokWCfqdo\"\n    frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen>\n  </iframe>\n</div></div>\n\n End of Third Row \n  End of Grid \n```\n. Good morning Michael,\nI am aware of the css box model but I have not played with sass and the sussy responsive framework. Before diving into the details of scss files, let me recapitulate the problem I have with the single page layout of your theme. \n\nIf you examine the metrics pane on this captured image you will see that the padding-right of article.page element is 167px but the padding-left is only 42px. If you compare this with article-splash element on your splash layout there is no padding at all defined. I cannot understand the logic behind this large padding-right. As a result of this, there is hardly any resize of  section.page__content in  a large screen. \n\nTherefore If I am right MY problem is how to disable or reduce that padding-right margin, right ? How is that related with the columns of sussy framework ? Do I have to make changes in more that one files, e.g. _page.scss to fix that ? \nYou also mentioned that div #main has a max width of 1024 - 1280px. In fact this is the point I started experimenting with the breakpoints section of  _variables.scss file.\nscss\n$small : 768px;\n$medium : 900px;\n$medium-wide : 1024px;\n$large : 1280px;\n$x-large : 1900px;\nIn my opinion these changes improved the appearance, especially on large screens.\n. Super, your explanation make things far more clear regarding to the way you applied Sussy magic to your theme ;-) \nIndeed,  in order to increase or decrease the padding-right (larger green box on the right) you may vary the @include suffix (2 of 12); \nIn your previous comment you also mentioned that:\n\nAny of these values can be changed you'll just have to make sure they add up to 12 or else things will break and not line-up.\n\nCould you please also clarify what are the elements and their corresponding column values that they add up to 12, the size of div #main, for the two layouts you included, i.e. single and splash ? That will be great.\n. Documentation on group by array liquid include command says:\n\nInclude the file in your template, passing in a collection and a field variable\n\nA post category is not a collection, you can do\n{% include group-by-array.html collection=site.posts field='categories' %}\nBut list-posts can do a filtering on the posts (collection) based on a specific category and a specific tag. \nAccording to my experience, this is very handy when you want to present your user with only a subset of posts that satisfy certain criteria, i.e. specific category and tags. With a database as a back-end that would be trivial but without a database you have to resort to such liquid include solutions.\n. ",

Sounds good. Thanks for considering it and for the quick reply.\n. The other option is to make overlay_pattern take the URL of the image.\n. Hey, just curious if you're interested in this at all (either using a boolean overlay_pattern or one that returns a URL) and if you'd wan't me to rebase so this can be merged.

    "glennsarti": "@jhabdas Yeah I did see that voting.  I also saw that the issue was raised in 2013.  And given there's over 3,500 open issues I didn't see this particular icon getting much traction in the near future.  Instead I figured on using the external link icon to provide the same functionality.\n. @mmistakes Yeah, I agree that it would be difficult to manage the links for EVERY network.  Is there perhaps a better way to display arbitrary external links in the profile;\ne.g.\nIn a _config.yml\n...\nauthor:\n  externallinks:\n    speakerdeck: \"https://.......\"\n    someothersite: \"http://....\"\n...\nAnd then just render it as list of links in the profile?\n<icon> Github\n<icon> Twitter\n<icon> speakerdeck           <----- The name of the link comes from the YML\n<icon> someothersite\n. @mmistakes Would / Do you need assistance with https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/362 ?\nI'm happy to close this PR with a reference to that issue.\n. Unfortunately I won't be much use on that one.  It's waaaaay beyond what I know.\n. Link to doco is https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/\n. Typo.  I'll fix that\n. Sure.  I'll update that.\n. Ahh of course.  I should've realised that was in  a \"vendored\" library.  I'll revisit the way I'm doing this without hacking it in.\n. ",
    "vg": "If the intention is to use a generic icon like fa-external-link for Speaker Deck, why not have a generic option itself and not limit it to speaker deck. Such that the generic option can be pointed to any url as required. \n. @mmistakes Understood. Makes sense. \n. @mmistakes No, I have figured out how to customise the theme as per my needs. But I would like to see a write up on how it can be done nicely in the Quick Start Guide. Every change I make leads to edit conflicts which I have to resolve manually to update. That seems to be the only major problem now. Hope Jekyll 4 will improve that. \n. @tobie can you provide an unminified version of assets/css/main.css\nI am not able to do a diff to see the changes \n. @jhabdas The second commit was an error, and was not intended to be a part of the pull request. \nI just discovered that any changes made to your forked repo after a pull request to the master are also included in the pull request. I did not know that would happen, until recently. \n. Any idea on how to use the different skins/color variations using remote_theme?. I did test it before commenting above. It did not work.

    "vlsi": "Just in case: I would like to have just \"linear gradient\" background, so regarding\n\nif anyone chimes in if this sort of thing is useful\n\nI would say enabling \"pattern backgound\" and similar features would be valuable.\n. @chrisvidal , can you please give a hint how did you manage with locale: ??? in _config.yml?\nAs far as I understand, minimal-mistakes has just a single configuration option for locale, so it is not clear how a single build would produce pages with different locale:... values.\nlocale: ... at page level does not seem to override site.locale.\n. There is a bunch of other animation: intro 0.3s both. For instance, page__hero--overlay makes splash overlay image to fade in in the same way.\nIt looks like I need to copy&change large files just in order to augment a couple of styles. That would make upgrade hard.\nDo you have any suggestion for \"upgrade\" scenario?\nE.g.\n1) Move animation and animation-delay into variables.scss or mixins.scss\n1) Add some kind of \"last.scss\" that would get included the last into main.css, so I could put just those styles that I want to alter\n. I'm just trying to think what is the viable option to avoid \"copy&paste lots of mm sources into my own site repository\" and keep upgrade possibility.\nIt seems I have to fork & publish my own gem. I just thought the idea of mm-gem was to avoid everybody copy-pasting mm sources.\nPS. animation of button background looks good. It is just a flash of white between navigations that looks odd to me.\n. > You don't have to copy the entire MM source when using the gem. You only need to add those files you want to change, and they will override the ones in the theme.\nI did check that out, however I find copy pasting specific files would complicate things in a way that I would no longer know which files override mm files and which are just my own.\nOther things I'm running into:\n- I would like to have _data/navigation.yml on a per-language basis\n- I think I would hit some of coloring walls. For instance, button colors are hard-coded into _buttons.scss.\n- I want just linear-gradient instead of image on a page_hero (that is feature_row id=\"intro\")\n- I'm not sure I like absolute links that mm produces. It is incompatible with https://github.com/untra/polyglot, so I would either teach polyglot to support absolute urls, or teach mm to avoid usage of that kind of links.\nOn the other hand, it looks like minimal-mistakes suits me. Thanks for keeping it afloat.\n. ",
    "rwillett": "Thanks for this, we weren't aware of this branch and where to look for it. \nWe've looked at that specific page and can see the format we want to use and how to use it\n```\n{: .align-right}\nAnd now...\n```\nThats clear now and we were using it the right way, the issue now is we can't get this format to work. \nWe can see the site.url and site.baseurl being expanded to the right URL, so the HTTP URL call is correct, but what we see in the HTML page is \n![image-right](http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/congestion_zone_300x300.png){: .align-right}\nWe can go directly to the PNG image referenced in a web browser using that URL so we know the image is there.\nIt appears that something is not converting the \n![image-right](http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/congestion_zone_300x300.png){: .align-right}\nto whatever it needs to be.\nWe will be hosting this ourselves and its currently running on a Mac under El Capitan, so we changed gem \"github-pages\" to gem \"jekyll\" in our Gemfile and rebuilt and then rebuilt it again as we worked through the dependencies as in #305, so we worked through those issues.\nSearching through the issues archives doesn't show anything similar to the problem that we have, we are assuming (famous last words) that we are missing a fundamental gem (is that the right phrase) for converting \n![image-right](http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/congestion_zone_300x300.png){: .align-right}\nto the right html code. \nWe thought that Kramdown was the missing 'filter', but after doing\nsudo gem install kramdown\nbundle exec jekyll build\nbundle exec jekyll serve\nWe get the same result. \nWe've now run out of ideas, we're sure we're missing something, we looked at \nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/\nand tried to see what was installed using the little video (or gif or whatever) but we simply couldn't work out what was happening with the bundle install. It would be useful to have the simple text output on that page, so people could see what you have installed and verify that against their own install.\nAny suggestions to what the issue may be are greatly appreciated.\nThanks again,\nRob\n. Ah! \nIt is in an html file. Its the index.html file.\nThis is our first time using jekyll and we have around 10 other pages as .md films, we wanted to put some images on the index.html page. So we actually wrote the images as \n<img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/congestion_zone_300x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"align-right\">\nand thought \"no\", we should do with Jekyll way and pulled them out and put in \n![image-right](http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/congestion_zone_300x300.png){: .align-right}\nIf the way to do it for the html page is use img src, then we'll do that.\nThat's rather embarrassing, but this is our first time with Jekyll and your templates. What gave us hope was the fact that the site.url and the site.baseurl variables were being inserted so we thought it was being parsed, so we carried on trying to use the markdown elements. If the img src with the class is the same output, we're happy with that.\nWe've just put the img src= back in and it works fine.\nSorry to bother you with a stupid mistake and misunderstanding on our part.\nRob\n. Agreed, we'll leave it as html for the moment and get something working.\n. Michael, \nThanks. We were expecting the answer \"no\" :)\nYour other suggestions are very useful, we'll look at them and see if we can use them. We might use Javascript to simply move the TOC over.  We weren't aware of the other plugins but we'll only look at those if we can't get the JS to work.\nThanks again for your help.\nRob\n. ",

With the latest version of Ruby you have to add gem \"nokogiri\", \"~> 1.6.8.rc2\" to your gemfile otherwise bundle update will fail. \nI've run the build:all npm script and the bundle exec jekyll serve command but when the page loads it's like there's no CSS on the page at all.

Sorry, I forgot it as I translated with my first fork.\nThanks :-) \n. Fixed, I used the default configuration. Then some documentation to read with staticman and update ui-text.\nYou can merge that :smile: \n. You have to run bundle exec jekyll serve in order to make it works.\nIt's like you have installed all the gems locally in your working directory instead of installing them globally on the system. So jekyll (wich is global) doesn't know the gems you've installed locally.\n. :+1:. Not related to the theme: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/. Yes, you have to install ruby/jekyll first.

    "juliohm": "I am having a somewhat related issue with nokogiri. First I noticed that I had to update the Gemfile.lock that comes with minimal mistakes to:\nBUNDLED WITH\n  2.0.1\nThen I tried to bundle install --path vendor/bundle and nokogiri showed this error:\nAn error occurred while installing nokogiri (1.6.8.1), and Bundler cannot continue.\nMake sure that `gem install nokogiri -v '1.6.8.1' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before bundling.\nI did what the message suggested and the installation of nokogiri was successful. It only showed a warning that I think is unrelated:\nWARNING:  You don't have /home/juliohm/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin in your PATH,\n      gem executables will not run.\nNow when I try to execute bundle again, the same error occurs. Could you please advise on how to overcome this issue? Should I change the version of nokogiri in the Gemfile.lock file?. Thank you for your attention. I did the first steps as you suggested, deleted the Gemfile.lock and tried bundle update, now another package is causing the error:\nAn error occurred while installing http_parser.rb (0.6.0), and Bundler\ncannot continue.\nMake sure that `gem install http_parser.rb -v '0.6.0' --source\n'https://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before bundling.\nShould I proceed and try installing the package manually as suggested?. I did it, and the installation was again successful. The bundle update command gave the same error about http_parser.rb.. Oh my goodness, it seems that paths with spaces in them are problematic somehow: https://github.com/tmm1/http_parser.rb/issues/47\nI moved the folder where the project was to another location without spaces, and the error is gone. Unbelievable... 2019 and packages can't handle paths with spaces...\nI think we are all set, the site is launching again :) Thank you @mmistakes for your help as usual, and your awesome theme, can't express how much I love it :heart: . Thank you @mmistakes , what is your suggestion about the file where I should add these lines? I am seeing many files inside of _sass, is that the right place?. Awesome @mmistakes, problem solved. Closing the issue.. Thank you @mmistakes I was using layout: single instead of layout: archive in that page. It is looking much better now.. Thank you @mmistakes , totally agree with all the points you raised. Thank you for pointing me to the right places.. I know it works with headers, I wonder if we can get the same effect without a header?. Awesome @mmistakes , I think I can hack it to achieve what I want, feel free to close the issue if you feel this is not a general feature request that would be useful to other users.. @mmistakes can you please comment on the difference betweenpage.header.teaserand the proposedpage.og_image`, couldn't they serve the same purpose?. I was just wondering if they could be merged into a single option. But as you said, maybe finer granularity is desired.. @mmistakes I tried adding the lines\njulia\n{% elsif page.og_image %}\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{% if page.og_image contains \"://\" %}{{ page.og_image }}{% else %}{{ page.og_image | absolute_url }}{% endif %}\">\nto seo.html, then adding the line og_image: /assets/images/some_image.png to the YAML header of a post. The result doesn't affect the preview image when I copy/paste the link on LinkedIn: https://juliohm.github.io/science/DAG-of-Julia-packages/\nCould you please help with the issue?. Your answers are always so good! Thank you for the clarification.\nHow long usually it takes for this cache to be updated and shared links to have the correct image?. Thank you @mmistakes, I will close the issue, the patch should be easy to apply. I will wait for the PR to be merged.. ",

    "annegentle": "Thanks! I'm building the files locally, then pushing flat files (from _site) to a gh-pages branch, so I think a plugin solution will work as long as it builds something that can be deployed as files. \n. I've been working on solving to add versions using Minimal Mistakes and wrote up my findings in this blog post: https://justwriteclick.com/2017/07/30/investigating-jekyll-for-versioned-content/\ntl;dr - It was easiest to use a one-off _config.version.yml file for each version with a new baseurl: /n.n setting. I'm still working on the UI menu itself, but one super-simple idea would be to add the versions to the top menu in _data/navigation.yml and make each version's URL selectable there. . Okay, I'll bite. Background: I use the gem version of the theme (4.5.2 to be exact) on GitHub Pages, building locally then uploading, with a custom domain without HTTPS. While investigating HTTPS, my solution of choice would not be CloudFlare but Netlify.\nAll of these choices are complex and dependency-oriented. As a use case, today I'm working on implementing lunr.js for site search. I can't figure out where I could serve JQuery from, much less which version was compatible with a Lunr.js script I was using, nor which order main.min.js, jquery, lunr and a search.js file are being loaded in. So adding a CDN dependency doesn't get me out of this debugging hell I'm in.\nI do like the footer_script feature and will implement that when I get to 4.6 of the theme. \nSome of your argument stacks external dependencies against other external dependencies and that somehow seems like apples and oranges as far as features of a web site. I can get by a while without HTTPS, but I can't get by at all if our Javascript dependencies are broken.. Extracting dependencies to a CDN doesn\u2019t break but it can make debugging more complex. In my case, the problem was that the JSON I had generated wasn\u2019t formatted correctly, but main.min.js showed an error in the local JavaScript Console. So I was stumped for a couple of days and saw this thread, and thought I\u2019d comment.. ",

Almost 2.5 years have passed since this ticket was created, does the limitation on collections still exist?\nBTW, the link you referred to above no longer exists.. Has anyone been able to get Latex code block working? I took @mmistakes suggested changes, and then some more from this blog post, but what I get is a jumbled mess. Inline expressions work, but not blocks of code/equations.\n\nI've checked the blogs of the people who showed interest in this ticket, and surprisingly, none of their blog posts use Latex in code blocks.\nhttps://benslack19.github.io\nhttps://yuzhangbit.github.io\nI might be missing something, because I know very little about web development, but I don't think it should be rocket science to ask for something like the following in my blog.\n\n(taken from here). @ihexon @ohadschn may I ask you guys to take a look at https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1984 if you are able to?. @mmistakes Sorry about the delayed response. I agree with what you said, but the problem is that not everyone has your skills. What if there's an features or extras folder,  where people, including you, can contribute features that can be optionally added? Then front end dummies like me can simply copy-paste the features they want, and those who don't, can ignore the folder.. Ok, thanks.. 1. Fixed by copying _data/navigation.yml (although the layout changed, it moved from middle of the page to right end).\n2. The ones in _pages aren't used.. It may be due to my mistake. Will reopen ticket after checking again. Thanks for the awesome theme.. For the record, the following changes fixed the issue, although I've no clue why:\nname                     : &name \"Abhijit Sarkar\"\ndescription              : \"thoughts().random()\"\nurl                      : \"https://asarkar.gitlab.io\"\n-# baseurl                  : \"\"\n+baseurl                  : # the subpath of your site, e.g. \"/blog\"\n+repository               : \"asarkar/asarkar.gitlab.io\". Moved to Netlify, as they have everything I need, for free. I can keep my code on GitHub (not GH Pages), and Netlify will manage deploy, SSL cert and DNS. Really cool! I didn't really like GitLab, they have close to 10k bugs open, which doesn't say much about their quality, and they deploy fails randomly.. @ohadschn True, but I opened 2 tickets and they responded within a few hours. For a free account, it's impressive customer service.. @mmistakes That's true, but to keep in sync with your site, wouldn't it be better if these are named consistently? Otherwise, whenever I do an upgrade, I've to go through each file that's different and decide whether or not I want to keep it.. I'm afraid that's not entirely true because the docs link to some of these files from docs/_pages for archive settings, and asks that those be copied over.\n\nNote: these are simply hash (fragment) links into the full taxonomy index pages. For them to resolve properly, the category and tag index pages need to exist at /categories/index.html (copy to _pages/category-archive.html) and /tags/index.html (copy to _pages/tag-archive.html).. You're technically right, but running Jekyll is a bigger topic than running mmistakes, and there are many tutorials about that already available. My thought behind creating this ticket was that someone would clone mmistakes, run a Docker command, and play around with difference configurations to help them understand how it works (to some extent). As far as I understand, that's currently not possible without first hosting the site someplace in the cloud, which is kind of a chicken and egg problem. If they don't have a working site yet, they don't really need to find hosting, assuming running locally is difficult and not understood well.. Fair enough, I'm closing this ticket. On a separate note, what is the recommended way to create tags that are best represented by more than one words? _, -, or CamelCase? Or just stick to single-worded tags?. @Kulbhushan-Chand that link is useful, but not exactly. What I\u2019m looking for is link to individual references, like so:\n\u201cThis is a reference to an item in the References section [1]\u201d\n...\nReferences:\n[1] Some seminal work\n\nIn the above example, I\u2019d like [1] to be a hyperlink.. @Kulbhushan-Chand thank you.. 1. Turned out the individual *archive.md pages still needed to be copied to _pages; when I did that, the posts did show up and the index page is also nice. This comment from https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/811 should be in the docs.\n2. The following doesn't seem to be necessary:\ncategory_archive:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /categories/\ntag_archive:\n  type: jekyll-archives\n  path: /tags/\n3. It's not at all clear if the path from 2 above, permalinks as shown below, and the permalink: /categories/ from category-archive.md should match, or why the same path should be repeated three times.\npermalinks:\n    category: /categories/:name/\n    tag: /tags/:name/\n    year: /years/:year/\nI've read the Jekyll docs, and the above questions are not answered. I'm keeping the ticket open so that the doc can be made clearer. Based on https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/811, I'm not the only one having trouble with archives :). That portion of the docs doesn\u2019t answer questions 2 and 3.. Would you please elaborate on \"adjust the theme\"? Perhaps this should go in the user docs, since I assume it to be a fairly common ask.. > If you're using a paginated home page\n@mmistakes This may be a dumb question, but how do I know if I'm using a paginated home page? If there're many posts then it may be apparent, but if I've a new blog with few posts, how can I tell?. Seems it can pin posts and collections, what about pages? I didn't find any mention in the docs.. @lakshmanbasnet Where did you put the script?. ",

In my case I have .md file, so it's not the reason.\nPerhaps I was too fast to conclude that archive layouts are limited after observing non-colored hyperlink. However, these two screenshots can highlight the difference in the formatting between a normal single post https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup/markup-html-tags-and-formatting/ :\n\n(Notice smaller font in this list and a colored hyperlink)\nand the archive example you have generated https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/archive-layout-with-content/ :\n\n(Notice bigger font and a non-colored hyperlink)\nThere are few more differences, e.g. no horizontal line after ## Header two headers, different left alignment at Steve Jobs .... \nOther than that--indeed--all other elements show up correctly.\n. The distinction is quite clear now. Somehow I expected the same exact behavior for the content part and a specific archive styling for the included archive items.\nThanks!\n. Sorry I don't have examples to share because I am still organizing the content. I think you have understood my intention quite well in your example. To put it simply, I want to have an archive page that first introduces a couple of other pages of my site on a given topic, and then lists posts from a given category. \nHowever, as you pointed out, in the first solution the links are sort-of invisible without coloring, while in the second (single with an archive) IMHO the look is not as perfect as in the original archive style. For now I'll try to restructure the content and will be looking for a 3rd solution in the meantime.\nThanks for your time\n. Hi Michael, so I worked on the solution and stepped on what looks like a bug:\nAs you suggested in your comment one should be able to add content before and after the archive loop. \nThe after one does not work for me when using grid_wrapper, the content under overlaps the grid (see screenshot attached). The normal non-grid_wrapper case works.\n\nAnother issue I noticed only now, is that the width of the content in archive layout is bigger than that of single layout (and it does not react to adding <section class=\"page__content\" ... wrapper nor <div class=\"page__inner-wrap\"> around page__content).\nWhat would be your ideas?\n. Unfortunately .cf doesn't work.\nHave a look, here's the visual: https://rubinovk.github.io/mmistakes/research/\nand here's the code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubinovk/mmistakes/gh-pages/_pages/research.md\n. It does, thanks! \nThe more we are in this issue, the more tweaks are being applied. If I'm the only one to enrich archive layout with additional content, then it's OK. However, if more people are to use it, then I believe this layout should be more \"other-content\"-friendly, just as your other theme features are clean and straightforward.\n. ",

No, As of Jekyll v3.4, I'm afraid a plugin can't come along for the ride by just being listed as a dependency.\nIts has to be either included under gems: (in _config.yml) or under :jekyll_plugins (in Gemfile)\n(Yes, this is in direct conflict with what I stated previously in that thread in Jekyll Talk.). I'll keep the PR against the new feature branch as conflicts are bound to arise.. Hi,\nI'm working on a new idea that'll help new Jekyll users to ease into using a loaded theme such as Minimal-Mistakes.\nThe idea will be released as v0.2.0 of jekyll-plus in the near future and it will integrate jekyll-data with jekyll library run with an executable called jekyll+ and has been built considering how much work needs to be put in by a new user to migrate to Minimal-Mistakes starting from jekyll new.\nThough not-yet-ready-for-release, its base functionality can be taken for a test-drive by following:\n  Step 1: install a dummy-gem built off the repo's master branch.\n  Step 2: install a dummy-version of minimal-mistakes-jekyll that includes the _data folder and the _config.yml\n  Step 3: run $ jekyll+ new-site test-blog --theme minimal-mistakes-jekyll\n  Step 4: $ bundle exec jekyll serve or $ bundle exec jekyll+ serve\n  Step 5: Preview site in browser.\n-- just 1% short of a fully-functional minimal-mistakes themed site --\nKnown Issue:\n  - comparatively very slow because of requiring multiple gems.. Thank you Michael :smiley: . Perfect! I sensed it had something to do with main.js because of the associated console error in the browser. But forgot all about the banner text in the template script. :+1: \nRemoving the banner text in my installed copy of the gem fixes this issue.\nAlso, the issue that led to the placement of the banner text in the first place has already been fixed in Jekyll 3.5.. \nSo all is good.. \nN.B.: btw, should the hamburger icon be visible on a laptop? I didn't check the sass files... This issue has been successfully resolved :clap: \n:smiley: . My pleasure. :smiley: \nI only did a superficial testing with overriding static asset files. I recommend that you carry out proper tests before releasing the next version to be more than sure it's all proper. @dontito94 This change is unnecessary. Jekyll 3.5 and above will automatically load these plugins from the gemspec.\n(I recommend installing Bundler gem if you don't have it, and then build/serve as following:)\n```sh\nbundle exec jekyll build\nor serve\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\nAdditionally, GitHub Pages won't look at this Gemfile. If you're using the repo-fork method with this theme, simply ensure that your config file lists the necessary plugins.. Hello Guys!\nI'm the author of the aforementioned plugin jekyll-data. Came across this ticket via the related ticket opened at Jekyll in response to sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2#37 \nJust thought I'd leave a clarification with regard to jekyll-data's role in this ado nevertheless.\nFrom what i gather by reading Minimal Mistakes' gemspec it looks like the theme's _config.yml is not being bundled within the theme-gem and therefore not accessible to jekyll-data. :slightly_smiling_face: That said, I think the actual issue is kinda related to my fears that I'd voiced when I enhanced Jekyll itself to automatically load a theme-gem's runtime dependencies.. minimal-mistakes-jekyll lists jekyll-paginate as a runtime_dependency and therefore it gets loaded whether desirable or not.\nJekyll Core turned down my proposal for a blacklist config key to counter this, though.. (citing unnecessary confusion surrounding a whitelist and then a blacklist..). #### Workaround to use jekyll-paginate-v2 instead of jekyll-paginate\nThe reason you're not able to use the newer version of the pagination plugin is because Jekyll 3.5+ automatically loads all of a gem-based theme's runtime-dependencies..(in our case, jekyll-paginate too)\nThe way around is as follows:\n  1. Maintain a whitelist of all the plugins required by Minimal Mistakes. (Already provided for, here)\n  2. Adjust your config file to use only the new pagination plugin. i.e. your must comment out the paginate: configuration.\n  3. Replace jekyll-paginate in the whitelist with jekyll-paginate-v2\n  4. Add jekyll-data to the whitelist if you're depending on default Theme-UI data files within the theme-gem.\n  5. Always build / serve your site under safe mode by adding safe: true to your _config.yml or by using the CLI switch --safe\n/cc @douglangille in case you want to continue using minimal-mistakes-jekyll gem. > You don't need to install the gem in your Gemfile.. The MM gem will install jekyll-include-cache..\n..need is to have it listed in your plugins: array in _config.yml. That's what the error is all about.\n@mmistakes This is a misunderstanding.\nThe error is actually from Jekyll complaining about \"not being able to load the requested plugin\".\n(For the uninitiated, this happens because bundle exec .. loads only those gems (and their dependencies) listed in the Gemfile or the Gemfile.lock.)\nLike you mentioned above, under normal conditions, one does not need to list the plugin in their Gemfile since it will be automatically loaded by Jekyll.\nBut when using the remote_theme configuration, customers are no longer using the \"theme-gem\" (and therefore neither the theme-gem's gemspec) per se. The remote-theme plugin links to the GitHub repo and only loads the themes layouts & other templates, ignoring dependencies entirely.\n\u00a0\n@cseas The above means that the you will simply have to un-comment the concerned plugin(s) in the recommended Gemfile (the same Gemfile in your PR) to resolve this issue.. > The fact that GitHub Pages supports but doesn't enable the jekyll-include-cache plugin has been a real thorn in my side.\nI empathize with you for having to shoulder this responsibility.\nThe reason this plugin is not enabled by default is because the casual user would not be able to fully realize the risks from the plugin's gotcha.\nIf it helps reduce the pain, I think all this needs is a Comment in the Gemfile and a note in the installation docs asking the user to first understand the plugin's effects and then list the plugin in both Gemfile & the config file if they want to optimize their includes.. The solution is:\n  - Either uncomment # gem 'jekyll-include-cache' if there's such a line in your Gemfile or\n  - Add gem 'jekyll-include-cache' in the Gemfile and\n  - Add jekyll-include-cache to the plugins: key in your _config.yml. > The Liquid logic probably needs to be changed to...\n@mmistakes Testing site.logo can lead to a false-positive when site.logo has been explicitly set to ''\nespecially when site.baseurl is nil or ''.\nSo IMO, the better route would be to test if logo_path is neither nil nor an empty string.\nliquid\n{% if logo_path %}\n  {% unless logo_path == \"\" %}\n    ...\n   {% endunless %}\n{% endif %}\nAlternatively, by using the empty Liquid builtin (since {% capture %} always returns a string):\nliquid\n{% unless logo_path == empty %}\n  ...\n{% endunless %}.

    "DanielSank": "Yeah, noticed that's called out in the docs. Sorry I missed that.\n. Would the changes proposed here allow users to edit e.g. the color of the title of individual posts? To change the title color now, it seems we need to modify the hard-coded rbg value in _sass/_page.scss which affects all posts.\n. FYI the docs say this already exists, and it's not clear in the docs whether the classes are concatenated or completely overwrite the default ones.\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/\n. > What you can do is add CSS to apply a height to that container.\nThis leads to an obvious question: how does one apply CSS to specific elements, i.e. the height of the hero imagine on one specific post? I was trying to figure that out also in order to change the overlay title color, because some images make white titles hard to read. Unfortunately, I only figure out how to do this by editing the hard-coded value in _sass/_page.scss directly. Is there a way to edit the title color or image height on a per-post basis?\n. there's a discussion of custom classes in the docs, so I'm a little puzzled by you're saying that's not merged yet. Will go experiment. In any case:\n1. How does one add inline CSS to classes defined in the front matter? A trivial example in the docs would be helpful.\n2. Using custom classes seems a bit odd because we're then overriding CSS from _page.scss in our custom class. It's not obvious to me why the custom class properties would take priority. Is there some way to parametrize the stuff in _page.scss in a way that the parameters can be defined on a per-post basis? If this is not presently possible, I'd like to make it so, so any guidance you can give would be appreciated and might result in a pull request :)\nI realize that in asking two questions here I might be going outside the bounds of a single issue. I can break up the discussion into smaller more focused ones if you prefer.\n. > You can't add inline CSS via Front Matter. You either have to add your css as part of the post/page's content...\nEwwwwww\n\n...or add those classes to main stylesheet. The later is probably the better option. I'd create your own custom .scss, place it in _sass and then @import it into /assets/css/main.scss.\n\nAha! I may be missing something really obvious, but even if I do this, how would I set attributes like the title color on a per-post basis? See next item.\n\nRE: 2. I get why that would be odd. Because of how the background images are assigned that's really the only option as you can't do it in _page.scss as that file doesn't read a post or page's YAML Front Matter.\n\nYeah this gets at the real problem. Is there some way to parametrize the sass in a way that we can pick values of the parameters on a per-post content? If not, I'd really like to figure out a way to set that up.\n\nBack when \"art directed\" posts were all the rage a few years ago that's how a lot of people did it eg: custom class overrides in the body of a post.\n\nI see how that works, but it's not DRY and it messes up the separation of content and styling, so I'm interested in finding another way.\n\nThe custom classes take priority depending on the \"cascade\", hence the name CascadingStyleSheets.\n\nI should have been more clear. I understand that CSS uses cascade to determine precedence. It's just not obvious whether custom classes are higher or lower in the cascade than the defaults because there's no specification about how custom classes propagate to the final document.\nThanks for your help so far.\n. To be clear, I am totally happy to do the legwork in setting up a way to parametrize CSS attributes on a per-post basis (assuming it's possible). Right now I'm trying to understand how the present system works and understand the boundaries of what's possible.\n. > The present system isn't meant to be a full on custom CSS for every post/page slution. The theme isn't built for that nor will it ever be.\nOf course not. You must get a lot of people expecting your theme to solve all the world's problems...\n\nIf you're looking to inject custom CSS into every page to change title colors or anything else then the better solution would be to add your own custom Liquid to the `_layouts.\n\nYeah, that seems like a half-decent approach. Will use that as a stop-gap for now. I'll see if I can figure out a better way though.\nThanks for your help.\n. ",

    "vwchu": "That makes sense. My concern is that as-is, in order to customize the theme, we need to edit main.scss or _variables.scss (causing possible merge conflicts). And in Ruby gem themes, we would have to recreate that file. That kind of defeats the point of isolating the theme from the user's customization.\n. @mmistakes Thanks for the heads up. I think the bundling of the /assets/ directory is great. However, to custom the theme, still will require overwriting (copying) the main.scss into the user's files. My concern still stands, in that I much rather not overwrite theme files (so I can take advantages of updates upstream) and add customization in addition to them instead of substituting them. That's why I suggested the move of the main.scss to /_sasss/minimal-mistakes.scss, that way my main.scss only has one line (to import the theme's main) and other customizations specific to my site or derived theme.\nscss\n@import \"minimal-mistake\";\n. @mmistakes Agreed. Moving things around is kind of a breaking change. The scenario you mentioned is possible. But it really isn't about main.scss being a one-liner, rather in a gemified theme setup, if I add my own scss file, I need to make my own copy of main.scss in my user project to add the necessary import. If you later add new features (new scss files), I won't see those updates, because I will only see my own copy. That's the dilemma/issue. And it is true for any theme files. If we say we will never touch main.scss that file is for users to customize, we won't have these issues, and users generally never have to override any theme scss files, since they can always override the CSS rules by redefining them in their own scss files.\n. Of course, you have to test when updating for breaking changes.\nThe complication is the way Jekyll overrides theme files with user files when user files are included. I know it's simplest and most straightforward way of doing, probably the best way. But from my reading of it, themes should try best to avoid or limit the need for these kinds of overrides whenever possible. Otherwise, we defeat the benefits having themes as gems as oppose to forking.\n. Agreed. This is probably a discussion that is happening in many parts of the Jekyll community: What conventions and best practices will allow for themes and child-themes to coexist and benefit from each other while not stepping on each other's toes.\n. Sorry my bad. Ignore this PR.\n. I am not sure how this change will affect the readability for new users, but I am of the opinion less redundancy and duplication will improve maintainability. I made this change initially, because I wanted to add support for data URLs, but didn't want to go through the trouble of changing each individual instance of the code snippet. If it is abstracting a bit too much, perhaps the image URLs and normal URLs cases can be handled separately as two separate/different includes.\nhtml\n<img src=\"{% include image_url path=teaser %}\" alt=\"\">\n<a href=\"{% include url path=link %}\">link</a>\nas opposed to:\nhtml\n<img src=\"{% include url path=teaser image=true %}\" alt=\"\">\n<a href=\"{% include url path=link %}\">link</a>\nIn terms of performance, running against the gh-pages branch I didn't see any noticeable serious degradation in the compilation time. Perhaps the additional base_path includes might add up, and we could remove it from the fragment (require that base_path is included prior to the include of url), but then we have to assume the user will know to do that.\nhtml\n{% include base_path %}\n<img src=\"{% include url path=teaser image=true %}\" alt=\"\">\n. That's reasonable.\n. ",
    "publicimageltd": "I know the issue is closed, but I like to add +1 to the request. I think \"tinkering with the css\" is relative. I would just like to add some additional classes without having to bother about the updates. If my site does not work, I would just \"turn off\" the additions and then look what's causing the error by successively commenting in the style definitions. \nSo my suggestion: Why can't we add the path to an additional style files in the config.yml, which are then included in the main page? This way, I do not have to bother about the gemified files and can still add my little helper classes.. Thanks for the fast reply! That's a good solution, since it enables me to have a global style sheet with no hassle. Would be perfect if one could access all the SCSS vars, but I understand that this is another (more complicated) issue. \nOne idea would be to WARN the user when upgrading a gem and the upgrade affects a file which has a local overriding copy. This way, at least, one is informed when updating.\nAnyways, thanks for the great theme and the good support!. ",

    "broccolini": "Right now Jekyll new doesn't play very nicely with using a new gem-based theme, unless it follows a very similar setup to Minima. The Jekyll folks are working on improvements that will de-couple this a bit more, but right now it's better to setup a vanilla Jekyll site and then add the theme gem. \nFor people making themes this probably means creating a simple Jekyll site that people can clone, with the required config needed for your theme, an index.html, and example post.md and page files that match your layout options. So that it's as simple as possible for people to get the theme working it's good to set defaults for your config options\u2014for example with my Swiss theme, users have the option of setting a theme color in the config which uses a different scss file. However, if they don't set that in the config it will use the default black theme and just work.\nThere are some updates coming in Jekyll 3.3 that will make theme setup easier, i.e. you'll be able to include an assets folder in your theme gem and then add a styles.css that imports all your scss partials\u2014which means someone using your theme doesn't have to do that setup.\nHope that helps and sorry if it's a bit hard to follow. I'll post a link here when I've updated my docs and setup a vanilla site as an example.\n. ",

I have the following in my _config.yml file:\ndefaults:\n  # _posts\n  - scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      layout: single\n      read_time: true\n      comments: true\n      share: true\n      related: true\n      author_profile: true\nbut related posts is not showing on any of my posts, see https://icicimov.github.io/blog/\nI was under impression this should be working by default but maybe I'm missing something. I'm not sure how the plugin/feature works ie is it parsing the posts body to find a match based on some words or is just picking up 4 random posts etc. Probably I'm just missing something, some non-minimal mistake :-( \nThanks, \nIgor\n. @mmistakes , thanks for the code it works for me, tried and applied to my site. Matching by tags looks like right direction to go in terms of logic about finding related posts if you ask me.\nAt the end, just wanted to say thanks for this awesome theme!\n. @mmistakes and @justinrummel, thank you both for your help and useful tips.\nPretty much following Justin's commit that he generously shared I have created the following structure:\n_config.dev.yml:\n```\nPlugins\ngems:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-sitemap\n  - jekyll-gist\n  - jekyll-feed\n  - jemoji\n  - json\n  - jekyll-lunr-js-search\nmimic GitHub Pages with --safe\nwhitelist:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-sitemap\n  - jekyll-gist\n  - jekyll-feed\n  - jemoji\n  - json\n  - jekyll-lunr-js-search\nlunr_search:\n  excludes: [rss.xml, atom.xml]\n  stopwords: \"stopwords.txt\"\n  min_length: 3\n  js_dir: \"/assets/js/lunr\"\n```\nGemfile:\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem \"jekyll-lunr-js-search\"\nend\n_plugins/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 jekyll_lunr_js_search.rb\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 related_posts.rb\nassets/js/lunr/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 date.format.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 jquery-1.12.4.min.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 jquery.lunr.search.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lunr.min.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 mustache.min.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 search.min.js\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 URI.min.js\n_includes/scripts.html\n_includes/search.html\n_pages/search.md:\n```\nauthor_profile: true\ntype: pages\nlayout: single\ntitle: Search\npermalink: /search/\nexclude_from_search: true\n\n{% include search.html %}\n```\nbut during the local site build the index.json file is not being created and I get  ERROR `/blog/assets/js/lunr/index.json' not found.\nTo me it looks like the plugin is not working for some reason. Do I need to do anything else apart from the above to get the plugin activated?\nThanks again for your help, very much appreciated.\nIgor\n. Ok, seams I misinterpreted the plugin help page:\n\nThis Jekyll plugin handles the generation of a lunr.js compatible .json index file. Runtime search configuration is provided by a simple jQuery plugin.\n\nand thought the plugin will generate the assets/js/lunr/index.js file instead of the _sites/assets/js/lunr/index.json file ... doh.\nStill not working for some reason but after I dropped in a index.json file the plugin generated the index.json file ready for jquery to search but still blank.\n.

If you haven't changed sources, that means the author of RedCloth (4.2.9) has removed it. You'll need to update your bundle to a different version of RedCloth (4.2.9) that hasn't been removed in order to install.\n. Michael, removing the lock file did the trick! I thought the same and was just going to replace the Gemfile.lock with the one from the github pages when I saw your last comment.\nThanks a lot for your help.\nCheers,\nIgor\n. Thanks Michael, fixed and all working now as expected.\nCheers,\nIgor. ",
    "justinrummel": "Trying to convert my site to the Gem version of MM.  Was this ever added to the Gem version or should I copy my old single.html to the _layouts/ folder?. @mmistakes and @jhabdas the migration is complete. Wasn't as bad as I thought except for all the images moving from /images/ to /asset/images/.  Took me a while to figure out what was doing what (inserting the default vs. my .md files forcing a path).  Thank goodness for find and perl commands.\nbash\n~/mm-gem-repo/> perl -p -i -e 's/(^    image: )/    image: \\/assets\\/images\\//g' _posts/*\n~/mm-gem-repo/> perl -p -i -e 's/(^    overlay_image: )/    overlay_image: \\/assets\\/images\\//g' _posts/*\n~/mm-gem-repo/> perl -p -i -e 's/(^    teaser: )/    teaser: \\/assets\\/images\\//g' _posts/*\nIf there was something still wrong, I would search the origin HTML to see if I could find something unique and then search the repo for that value:\nbash\n~/mm-gem-repo/> find . -type f -exec grep -e 'mySearchItem' \\{\\} \\; -print\nFrom there I had to find what didn't function or look right.  I inserted Instagram images on the main page, added .css for \"fifth\" and \"sixth\" for large amount of photosets pointing to flickr, added Lunr search functionality, and finally this section for related items.  I prefer the searching on tags vs. what is default right now.  I guess I'll leave the single.html until something permanent takes it place.\nMy slimmed down repo is:\n_includes\n_layouts\n_sass\n. While researching HTTPS testing via jekyll serve, I noticed there is a --lsi flag.  From Jekyll's documentation:\n\nIf the page being processed is a Post, this contains a list of up to ten related Posts. By default, these are the ten most recent posts. For high quality but slow to compute results, run the  jekyll command with the --lsi (latent semantic indexing) option. Also note GitHub Pages does not support the lsi option when generating sites.\nsource: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/\n\nI can confirm it gives me different results than a list of 10 most recent posts, but still don't think it is perfect.  If you try the --lsi option, be sure to install gsl as mention on http://footle.org/2014/11/06/speeding-up-jekylls-lsi/ or else you will be sitting for hours without any progress.. OK, but I would have still expected a generic meta items be displayed somewhere in the head\nhtml\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ seo_description }}\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"{{ post.tags}}\">\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"{{ site.name }}\">\n. Oh, and thanks for the note about the _layouts/compress.html!  The documentation at http://jch.penibelst.de is perfect. \n. @mmistakes the suggestion for keywords and author are not requirements.  Just was trying to expand beyond the one item description to see if there were other default meta tags that may be missing based on http://smo.knowem.com \nI'll work on a PR for the description tag.\n. submitted for the develop branch.  Closing this PR.\n. Thanks @mmistakes !!! \n. @mmistakes Thanks for the suggestion.  I first tried to ensure that a line break was after the '---', but that did not solve the issue.  Inserting an excerpt: in the YAML header did resolve.  \nThanks again! \n. thanks!  I'll try that out.\n. Thank you!  This solved the warnings, plus helped fix the lunr search all in one step!!! \n. Update your url in _config.yml to be HTTPS\n. I've got it running on my site. Warning, it doubles the time it takes to generate a site. I was finishing in 20s, but now with Lunr it takes over 40s. \nhttps://www.justinrummel.com/search/ \n. FYI; here are my commits for adding Lunr:\n- _config.yml\n- A LOT MORE\n. I've found Lunr to be very picky about the gem order.  Please see my Gemfile and _config.yml and replicate.\n. @twhite96 the \"single\" is a layout https://github.com/twhite96/twhite96.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/single.html\nNot sure why it's not picking it up when it's obviously there in your repo.  Only diff I can see between yours and mine is I have removed \"{% include base_path %}\" from the 5th line.\nIn addition I use \"compress\" in my default layout. https://github.com/justinrummel/jr.com-mm/blob/jr-branch/_layouts/default.html . @twhite96 I was able to clone your repo locally and noticed you don't have the _pages section setup correctly.  It should be files ending in .html will be converted to /filename/.  Therefore, take a look at my _pages and use the same format while at the same time remove the .md files.  WARNING, I've injected an element from @mmistakes hpstr to arrange all the tags at the top, then use CSS to display correctly... so your site may look different than mine.\nIn addition, I updated your _config to state \nbash\ninclude:\n  - .htaccess\n  - _pages\nTags, Categories, and Search display correctly now.  \nLastly, You did cleanup _includes as suggested when using the gem version of mm, however, you do need to keep the _includes/script.html as seen on my site as a gem override.  Once that was in place, searched worked locally.\n\n. I've done this also with my site.  I would recommend duplicating the archive-single.html to a new file and call that on your root index.html file.  archive-single.html is used in several other places and may cause undesired effects (e.g related stories). \n- index.html\n- archive-single-main.html\n. For scripts that I want to add on every page, I usually add them to the _include/scripts.html page.  I've also done some IF statements (which I'm sure are not the best way to do this) to see if I'm loading the main page or a \"Search\" page as seen on my repo: scripts.html. with two different versions of \"listen\" and \"bundler\" being displayed, I'm wondering if you have duplicate versions installed.  You may need to bundle clean --force . I'm really close now. Able to POST and display comments by integrating Staticman and Travis using v2. Now need to work on threaded replies. \nMy findings is patience is the key. And browser cache will give you false negatives. . I've got it! Parent/child is now displaying correctly and using Staticman and Travis. \nNext is Mailgun, but that feature is low priority. \nPublic Test URL: https://www.justinrummel.com/macworld-2010-pictures/. I was wondering about _includes/comment-providers/staticman.html.  Using the GEM version I didn't pick up on that file till it was too late.  Should be able to refactor and get something to develop after the weekend.\n. @mmistakes Did you find Mailgun to be slow in responses? I believe I have replicated the setup process, made a couple of test comments, but I'm not seeing anything on Mailgun indicating email notifications are working. . @andreasfaerber it seems that you have achieved the same level for comments as I have (example post w/ comments here).  Just wish I had time to figure out mailgun to complete the setup.. @alec1 I believe we are still using v1.  When trying to POST dummy data, v1 gives me an application error response while v2 is \"Cannot POST\"\n``` bash\njustin@localhost ~> curl -X POST \"https://api.staticman.net/v1/webhook\" -d \"test=true\"\n{\"error\":\"No id found in the request\"}\njustin@localhost ~> curl -X POST \"https://api.staticman.net/v2/webhook\" -d \"test=true\"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\nError\n\n\n\n\n```.

B/c I've moved hosting companies and SSL certs... things are \"complicated\" (moved from Site5 w/ StartSSL => frantech w/ Let's Encrypte => frantech VPS w/ Cloudflare Cert).\nsolution is to visit: chrome://net-internals/#hsts and in the bottom \"Query domain\" enter www.justinrummel.com.  You can delete Chrome's cache of the site and then it will work fine.. No worries... the multiple \"Archive\" methods was just bothering me.  I may think of another way to get to these pages but not in the main Masthead. . Just using what is provided.  Closing request. . Finally getting to test some changes so I can update to the latest version of the theme.  When moving my file overrides out of _sass, and creating a new main.scss with the below code, I'm not seeing my modifications being available in the page source.\nI'm sure I'm not doing something correctly, just looking for some guidance.\n``` css\nmain.scss\n\n@charset \"utf-8\";\n/ Theme overrides /\n/\n   Media and embeds\n   ========================================================================== /\n/ Figures and images /\niframe {\n    display: block;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n  }\n&.fourth {\n    > a,\n    > img {\n      @include breakpoint($small) {\n        width: calc(25% - 0.5em);\n      }\n    }\nfigcaption {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\n}\n&.fifth {\n    > a,\n    > img {\n      @include breakpoint($small) {\n        width: calc(20% - 0.5em);\n      }\n    }\nfigcaption {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\n}\ntrimmed\n/ Import gem theme importer /\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\";\n. OK, moved my CSS below the@import \"minimal-mistakes\"```.  \nI Still wasn't getting anything.  I was re-reading https://github.com/jekyll/minima#customization and noticed that the placement of main.css was to be in /assets/.  \nI moved my file from /_sass to /assets and was able to see a bunch of CSS errors.  Cleaned those up now without any errors, but still don't see an updated version of localhost:4000/assets/css/main.css that has my CSS.\nI can't commit my changes to my repo, as the site then looses all my customizations as Travis is triggered on commit.  Thoughts? \n. That was it!  File needs to be in /assets/css/main.scss\nI was talented and picked two wrong locations.  You can close this if needed.. Gotcha... if there is going to be changes in the future then people can view my repo and use it if they want, but it may be better to wait till those elements calm down.. qq on use of liquid to parse data, why is it necessary to put the tags in a for loop.  Since this is already an array of tags, can you simply state:\n\"tags\" : {{ post.tags | jsonify }}\nbetter yet, I would sort and ensure the array is unique.. Unfortunately I'm not a knowledgeable resource on this item.  I was running my site through some validators (Rocket Validator specifically) and this item surfaced.  I thought the general site could use this update vs. creating a local _includes/head.html gem override.  I did question if the right course of action would to remove the line entirely... but again I'm not sure.\nI don't know if this effects all other browsers... I've only tested on Desktop and Mobile Safari,  everything looks fine.  . using the specific susy-3-upgrade branch eliminated the warnings for me too.\n. Definitely a Jekyll/OS issue.\nFollowed these instructions to get ram installed along with [this for using rvm with fish shell].  Still having issues with fish shell, but that is happening more and more... may just remove that shell as my default.. Awesome!  I'll try it out this morning . Wanted to make sure I'm reading this correctly, you want the Table of Contents to be on the right hand side vs. being embedded with the text.\nI have an updated screenshot of my current site showing the difference:\n\nTOC Embedded with text: http://cl.rummel.co/0B2r2D290p42\nTOC on the right: http://cl.rummel.co/2F0G1r3t2k0f\n\nIf this is the case, it would be nice if TOC could be identified towards the bottom of the markdown, but aligned at the top right.  Else, if you but the TOC on the first line you will see the title of the TOC on the main page when post.excerpt is used. ( example: http://cl.rummel.co/0W040k3s0b31 )\n. Thanks for the fast turnaround! \n\nDesktop view looks GREAT!\nMobile view will still inline the TOC where you have the liquid code snippet.  Not a big deal from a reading perspective.  I wouldn't drop the TOC to the bottom of the page just yet.\niPad and iPad Pro views on Google Chrome suggest that the TOC is now on top of the text/images of the post making it unreadable.\n\n\n. flawless!  Going to push it to my main site and let it bake in production.. 1.\nI believe the title is due to the max-width on masthead__inner-wrap.  If you change that to something larger such as 1900px it looks correct.  To do this you will have to create a new CSS overwrite.  Read this conversation all the way to the end to best understand what file needs to be created and how it works. \n\n2.\nThe great thing about gem themes is you can always overwrite the default files with your own.  Download the _includes/masthead.html file and update it so it appears the way you want.  Your local version will overwrite what is default coming from the gem.\n. These are great!  Thanks for the work.. I noticed that none of your examples include a comments section.  I would expect the color options to be reversed vs. dark text field with light border area.\n. Last note for documentation, if you have already made CSS changes be sure to update your /assets/css/main.scss to include \ncss\n@import \"minimal-mistakes/skins/{{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin | default: 'default' }}\"; // skin. Thanks, I must have an override somewhere on /assets/css/main.scss somewhere.... ah!  my fault... thought it was released.  Thanks for the help! . Looks Great!\n\n. I can confirm that I have \"search\" in one of my articles and when using Lunr it does not return any results.  What about \"Sear\"? . I had this too when first updating to the new Font Awesome. Something is getting cached, either server, cdn, or at the browser. . I don't think Cloudflare is setup correctly.  I can still access http://winfriedauner.de/about/ without getting a 301 redirect to the HTTPS version. \nbash\njrummel@res-mpiff ~> curl -sI \"http://winfriedauner.de/cv/\" | grep \"HTTP/\\|Location\"\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nI don't see your MM repo on your GitHub account, so can't review your _config.yml either.  I self host, but run my site through cloudflare and everything is forced as HTTPS.  . Just curious, should lines 13-14 _layouts/default.html also have include_cached?\nhttps://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/e704cd40d4c8629742f949ba012f2a64200fffc3/_layouts/default.html#L13-L14\n. Thanks, hopefully @nickgarlis can chime in, else I'll slap the update and test locally and see what happens. :). Doing quick update to lunr.jr and lunr.min.js with 2.3.3 looks good.  No Console errors and fast accurate results.  Submitting a PR.. PR submitted: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/1885. There are other locations where http://schema.org exist in the repo.  Should we submit a PR to find/replace all instances? . If your question is asking the theme to modify the video files, I don\u2019t believe that is possible. You would need to format the video to fit the proper dimensions. \nIf you are looking to adjust the theme\u2019s dimensions for the header, you can override the values by modifying the assets/css/main.scss\nSee https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/.

I have tried to get your layout going with the Tag and Category archives, but I get build warnings: single layout doesn't exist. Then when visiting my site, I see the navigation but it says page not found, when I know for a fact I added those pages. I also don't have the hamburger menu for links that don't fit on the main page. Can you have a look at my repo? https://github.com/twhite96/twhite96.github.io\nThank you.. Thanks @mmistakes and @justinrummel. I can't seem to get the search page running though. Says page not found. Everything else works after I fixed the js and deleted _layouts _incluses, and _sass. Not sure what's going on there. Can anyone help?. @mmistakes and @justinrummel seems that the tag archive and category archive works locally but only as a directory when running jekyll serve. Search doesn't even appear. But when running it at my production site, https://twhite96.surge.sh, pages aren't found. Something weird going on here.. Thank you @justinrummel! Got it working.. @jhabdas how was that accomplished?. It didn't work so I just scrapped it. Not sure why or what happened but it didn't work no matter what I tried.. I am unable to get this to work. So you're saying this is a Jekyll issue? I'll check out the forums as I haven't found a good article on how to implement this.. No worries. Got it to work. Thanks Michael.. My problem is that I used the gem on GitHub pages. I didn't know you couldn't do that so every time I update the site on another server, it still has the GitHub Pages version I used. Anyway to fix this without blowing up my site?. Fixed. Thanks for your help.. @mmistakes that's what I wasn't sure of. I'll tack it onto a layout. Thanks.. I added it to the single.html layout and it is breaking the Disqus comments and the footer. Not sure what's going on.. Just need to know how to style this. I added a license class to the div I used to hold the license but I have no clue how to style it with the SASS you've got. I know nada about SASS and the bare minimum of CSS.. @mmistakes I didn't write the HTML. I knew there was something wrong with it but wasn't sure what. Thanks.. I was overthinking it.

I'll have to refresh my memory because it was a little while ago that I first did this, but a constraint I had was that I wanted to use markdown for code syntax highlighting INSIDE the pull down box. So I had accordian html chunks in the post .md file, but then wanted markdown inside that html. I think the solution I found at the end of the day was to use <div markdown=\"1\"> markdown content </div> inside the accordion html chunk. And I think this should be compatible with most CSS implementations you referenced? \nOne last thing, can I impose on you again to get a kick in the right direction for implementing CSS accordian? Is the right order of affairs to add a new css file to ./sass/<accordian css (scss?) file> and then add an @import  \"<accordian css(scss?) file>\"; line to ./assets/css/main.scss? On a separate note, I'm learning about but not greatly familiar with SASS. Can I get by with just renaming .css files to .scss in ./sass/?

Okay, so when I execute gem list --local, it shows minimal-mistakes-jekyll (4.1.0, 4.0.1)\nHow do I make sure that the version being built by jekyll with bundle exec jekyll build does so using 4.1.0?

    "aloisklink": "I think it would be a good idea to use it.\nThe Jekyll SEO tag plugin works with GitHub Pages.\nAnd as far as I'm aware, all of the formatting in the _config.yml matches the SEO tag plugin, so there shouldn't be any need for anyone to update their _config.yml files. (Except for changing og_image: to logo:, but that will be easily seen and fixed when merging) \nRegarding the image vs. header.image issue, I would have recommended that Liquid assign should be used to fix it, but you've already tried that. However, changing those tags in the markdown files should be pretty easy. One would probably only need to run something like\nreplace \"    image: \" \"image: \" -- *.md or sed -i -e 's/\"    image: \"/\"image: \"/g' *.md in bash, if you don't need to use header.image anywhere, and using YAML anchors  should require only a simple Python script. \nThe SEO tag plugin doesn't seem to do most of Google Search's recommended markup, but then again, even if one does have it on their page, there is no guarantee that Google Search will show it. Also, I'm guessing that people who care about Google Search's markup could either add it in manually, or contribute and add it to the Jekyll SEO tag plugin. \n. ",

    "BenjaminJurke": "This is definitely not a browser caching issue. I cleared my browser cache multiple times and cleared the jekyll caching (jekyll clean). Ultimately, I noticed that the files in the _site/assets/fonts folder are of different (smaller = older) size compared to my assets/fonts folder with the new ones. This is clearly visible at the local file level, with no browsers involved at all. There is no difference between jekyll build or jekyll serve. \nIt is noteworthy that additional files (i.e. files that are not overwriting asset files from the theme) are processed correctly, i.e. they are properly added to the _site/assets/... folder as expected. The issue only seems to hit static asset files that are supposed to overwrite files from the theme gem. As mentioned, the keep_files directive does not work as one would expect as well.\nFor the moment I would be happy if you could simply update the Font Awesome package in the next gem theme version, but this is obviously just a workaround and not the core of the issue.\nIn any case: congratulation and thanks for this overall awesome Jekyll theme! :-). Great, thanks for your effort.\nLike you mentioned, the override seems to work for files, that are actually being processed by Jekyll. The font files, as far as I can tell, are essentially just being copied over to the output folder. I guess, there may be very small bug somewhere in Jekyll for this particular case (overriding static unprocessed files from the theme). Additional files in the asset folder are handled correctly.. Just saw the theme update to 4.1.1 - thanks for the super-fast update! Thumbs up!\n(Yes, I know, this does not fix the underlying issue, but at the moment solves my specific problem :) ). Well, since you updated FontAwesome in the gem my issue has been resolved.\nHowever, I recently stumbled over something that may be related: I recently used your theme for a German language website, i.e. I am using localizations for the first time. But it appears that the translations in the ui-text.yml file (which is part of the theme and should be in the gem) are only used if the file is locally present. It is not a big issue, since I can simply copy the file from the repository into the _data directory and everything works fine. However, one would naively expect this to work without the file present, i.e. defaulting to the file in the gem.\nThis appears to be (at least somewhat) related, because once again processing of local and gem-default files is handled differently (unexpected), in this particular case the local variants appear to have preference. Jekyll and theme are at the most recent version - I basically run bundle update whenever I do some work on my site.\nLike I said, not a real issue, but maybe something worth looking into it.. OK, I see - was not aware of this.. Thanks for the link, that's quite a useful tool.\nOn the tech side, I am also able to customize the Minimal Mistakes template for local server FontAwesome usage, but in the context of being rather lazy and having a minimally invasive long term upgrade process of the template (i.e. keeping as much of it unchanged as possible) it would be a great feature to build this right into the template.\nIn any case, the GDPR stuff is probably going to be an issue for quite a number of people in the foreseeable future.. I don't have specific information, but like I said, the very act of connecting the IP address (which you cannot avoid) is apparently already troublesome. If you google CDN and GDPR you stumble for example onto information like https://www.maxcdn.com/gdpr/, where the CDN provider offers to digitally sign certain GDPR privacy statements regarding such problems. Therefore, I guess that it could potentially become an issue.\nSome related info on Google Fonts: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/739\nI certainly understand that this is completely ridiculous from a technological point of view or from the maintenance perspective..... Indeed. There are now actual service providers that simply block EU countries from accessing websites due to the GDPR. Just google GDPR shield, e.g. https://www.techrepublic.com/article/to-save-thousands-on-gdpr-compliance-some-companies-are-blocking-all-eu-users/. Today I actually looked at the MM theme code basis. It is actually super-simple to embed the FontAwesome locally to the server, just as Mike Rose suggested.\n\nDownload the FontAwesome package from the FontAwesome Website\nThe relevant file is fontawesome-all.min.js inside the svg-with-js/js folder of the downloaded ZIP package.\nMove this file to a folder of your Jekyll base, e.g. I placed it into the assets/js/fa-v5.0.12 directory, such that in the compiled version of the site the relative file URL is assets/js/fa-v5.0.12/fontawesome-all.min.js\nCreate a local copy of the _includes/scripts.html file in your Jekyll base directory.\nInside this file (currently in line 12) you find the line \n<script src=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.12/js/all.js\"></script>\nwhich loads the FontAwesome SVG/JS script from the default FontAwesome CDN server. Replace this line by\n<script src=\"{{ '/assets/js/fa-v5.0.12/fontawesome-all.min.js' | relative_url }}\"></script>\nor some other path that you used for the local script file.\nRecompile / build your Jekyll website. All done.\n\nStill, it would be (Font)Awesome \ud83d\ude09 if this process would be automated by default in the theme, but it is not much trouble to follow up on manually.. Indeed, there are a few interesting months coming up regarding this issue.\nI read on some German website, that due to all those issues you mentioned (i.e. standard web development components provided by the big tech firms or standard CDNs) WordPress and other standard CMS frameworks effectively become illegal, but I have serious doubt that this will actually be enforced in full. Austria seems to ignore the issue altogether, as there \"local implementation\" of the EU law (yes, EU law is totally crazy, they basically make an EU law in Brussels which each EU country then has to reformulate as a national implementation of the EU law...) is essentially a non-implementation. They'll probably get slapped by a EU fine further down the road.... ",
    "weikinhuang": "Alright thanks!. Actually I just tried it, and it doesn't seem to be picking up the local _sass/vendor/font-awesome/_variables.scss file. I'm using the gem version of the theme.

In doing some caveman debugging, it looks like thepage object doesn't have any header info in it. The generated category/tag pages have the following info for page:\npage: {{ page }}\npage: {\"layout\"=>\"archive-taxonomy\", \"posts\"=>[#], \"type\"=>\"tag\", \"title\"=>\"coupons\", \"date\"=>nil, \"name\"=>\"index\", \"path\"=>\"tags/coupons/index.html\", \"url\"=>\"/tags/coupons/\"}\nIf I explicitly ask for page.header.overlay_image, I get nothing back in the generated page.\n. Thanks! I think you're right. Digging through the plugin code, it restricts Liquid to a fixed set of attributes on page, and doesn't pay any attention to extra data in the layout front matter.\nThat's fine. I spent a few hours learning how plugins work and how to debug Ruby. So, +1 for that! :-). I solved this finally, by copying the relevant layout code from page__hero.html into a custom layout file for jekyll-archive to use. The generated category/tag pages match the styling of the rest of my site. \nThanks very much for the help. :-). Captain's Log: Supplemental\nAfter closing this issue, I read somewhere else that since Jekyll 3, layout front matter is no longer made accessible to Liquid via the page variable, but through layout.\nSo, I tried the approach of customizing archive.html to access the header front matter info through layout.header in the Liquid. Changing the jekyll-archive config to use my customized layout, that approach worked fine. I had to pull in sidebar.html and tweak it to access sidebar definitions through layout also.\nUltimately, it was a \"6 of one, half dozen of the other\" solution. Copying pieces of Liquid code out of archive.html & sidebar.html into new layout, versus copying layout files and modifying them to access info through the layout variable, both required about the same amount of work.\nJust wanted to offer this up as a viable alternative solution to customizing pages generated by jekyll-archive..

I've tried to configure the _config.yaml with paginate_path: /recent/page:num/ and it created all other pages (e.g. _site\\recent\\page2 except the date on the first page _site\\recent\\index.html. \nWhen using the default value no page folder is created in the _site.\nIs this the unexpected limitation of Jekyll and pagination?. It worked indeed as you said. I'll summarize\n- Only index.html files can reference the pagination object.\n- When the root is not the desired location then create a folder e.g. recent and place the html file inside recent\\index.html\n  - In the _config.yaml make sure to set paginate_path: /recent/page:num/\nThanks @mmistakes. Once I finish with my setup I'll make check the files/documentation and try to enhance them with what I learned and submit a pull request.. @mmistakes I need to work with GitHub pages.

Before I make a pull request I would like to ask for someone to check this commit that represents what I did to achieve my goal.\nI can only support the /tags/#tag and /categories/#category.\n. Thank you so much. To be honest, as a Jekyll novice, I've wasted many hours getting to those changes. \nIt was not clear from me from the docs that I could actually get those pages for the tags/categories functionality. I also searched but I missed it because the file name doesn't match the expectation because of the permlink\nWe can close this issue but I would consider making it more clear in the documentation, so other novices don't spend so much time on something as basic as tags/categories..

As i recently started my own blog, i am very interested in the minimal mistakes theme (Hey, it's great!) and did not want to start unless i got the nested comments working. As i pulled some hair out i would like to protect others from lost hair, too. To make it easier in case someone also starts fresh, i have created a diff from a freshly forked minimal mistakes 4.4.1 including the changes i made to get statesman v2 with nested comments up and running. As the step by step guide is a bit lengthy, you can find it here: Minimal Mistakes: v4.4.1 with staticman v2 and nested comments.\nIt is far from perfect but got me up and running with my blog, staticman v2 and nested comments.\nRegards,\nAndreas.

I have submitted a pull request to the staticman repository.\nIf my assumptions are correct and this is a fix then it should make all so far not working mail notifications working.

    "dev4223": "Maybe some help when looking into my forked repo. I got it to work weeks before without any fixes to staticman. And with my own mailgun account. I did a lot trial and error testing, but finally I took the minimal-mistakes settings as basis and included the settings from made-mistakes.\nThen I had to add an email.fromAddress which is only described in https://staticman.net/docs/api.\nI've tested only one nesting level for possible replies to the comment. But so far it works.\nOnly one issue: When you have more than one parent comment and replying to one of them, don't merge the pull request and reply to another comment, the counting is mixed up. So when you merge all reply  pull requests later, the will be attached to the wrong comment. This was the experience with my settup so far.\nBut thanks for the amazing work, @mmistakes, and all the folkes contributing.     . @mmistakes I've read your article https://mademistakes.com/articles/improving-jekyll-static-comments/ and gone through the files manually and then copy and pasted the described things to my forked minimal mistakes repo. \nI remember I had 3 comments and then replied to the first one and then to the second one. Then I merged the pull requests and the order of the replies where mixed up. But maybe I have to do a test once more on this issue.  . I've added a right margin to page class:\n```\n.page {\n@include breakpoint($large) {\n    float: right;\n    width: span(8 of 12);\n    margin-right: span(2 of 12);\n    padding-left: gutter(0.5 of 12);\n    padding-right: gutter(2 of 12);\n  }\n```\nSo it looks the same as before. \nMaybe it helps.  .

    "willymcallister": "I'm seeing something similar on my jekyll-3.4.3 site as @dev4223 describes, replies grouped with the wrong main comment. This happens only when my web page is uploaded to github pages. In comments.html, it appears the assign statement extracts the main comments in reverse datecode order. (My comment files go by names like comment-1498195100613.yml). The inspect statement lists the newest comment first, not the oldest. \n{% assign comments = site.data.comments[post_slug] | where_exp: \"item\", \"item.replying_to == ''\" %}\n{{ comments | inspect }}\nIf I git-pull the comments from github pages down to my Mac and render my site, the interleaved comments and replies are correct.\nsite: http://spinningnumbers.org/a/charge.html\ngithub: https://github.com/willymcallister/willymcallister.github.io/tree/master/_includes\n. My jekyll-staticman site when hosted at github had problems with the order of nested comments. To get nested comments to attach themselves to the proper main comment, I made these updates to my version of made-mistakes source files:\nOn the suggestion of GitHub support, I changed my Gemfile to use the github-pages gem instead of the jekyll gem.\n```\ngem \"jekyll\", \"3.4.0\"    << commented out this line\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n   gem \"jekyll-feed\", \"~> 0.6\"\n   gem 'github-pages'    << added this line\nend\n```\nWith this change, my local site and my github site both sorted nested comments incorrectly. The issue appears to be the way the \"where_exp\" produces its output object. At github-pages the where_exp result is in newest-to-oldest order, which messes up the association of comments and replies. To fix this I added two sort commands right after the where_exp statements.\nIn comments.html to sort the main comments: \n```\n{% assign comments = site.data.comments[post_slug] | where_exp: \"item\", \"item.replying_to == ''\" %} \n{% assign comments_date = comments | sort: 'date' %}      <<< Add this sort statement.\n{% for comment in comments_date %}     <<< Use the sorted main comments. \n{% assign index       = forloop.index %} ... etc.\n```\nAnd something similar in comment.html to sort the replies in oldest-to-newest order:\n{% assign replies = site.data.comments[post_slug] | where_exp: 'item', 'item.replying_to == i' %}\n{% assign replies_date = replies | sort: 'date' %}\n{% for reply in replies_date %}\nIf the jekyll/liquid sort order at github-pages ever changes, these sort commands should continue to work, albeit in benign fashion..

    "nickgarlis": "I've got it working for my site. @mmistakes do you want me to pr ?\nHere is what it looks like:\n\n. Hi guys, \nI'm thinking of pull requesting my search implementation on the theme. I've been working on it locally and there are a few things to consider. @mmistakes should I send you a link to a gh-pages repository with it first ? You might want to change/add \na few things. I am thinking of adding an on/off switch in config.yml and maybe an option for a directory to search in ? Should I also make the output similar to archive-single.html ? . I have a demo of it on an old fork of the theme . However, my source code is still kinda messy and not really what I have in mind for the theme... I'll have another one in the next couple of days.. @mmistakes Yeah I don't think it would be a good idea to put it in the header since the results are live.\nAlright, I will make a few adjustments in the code and then pull request with a demo.. @mmistakes After making a few adjustments I finally pushed my source code into a new repository. Here is a demo . This searches in every collection.. Just follow these instructions to get your site running on github pages. You have to modify your Gemfile and your _config.yml if you want to build off gh-pages. Also, check out this repository.. You can make new branch, set it as default and delete master.. Good idea, that would make more sense.. @mmistakes I think it had something to do with the custom stemmer that I use to support Greek characters. The error that you get must be because Lunr now gets the documents added in the configuration function. Other than that, I think that upgrading is a good idea and it is something that I had in mind. I will run some tests and if everything works properly, I can pull request the upgrade.. I just pull requested the update #1419 . Lunr will not break if you use numbers as tags now. Also, Lunr is now configured to search for every word inside of the query string and not just for the whole string. . @mmistakes Would you also be interested in multiple language support ?. @mmistakes I am not sure about Algolia but Lunr does not support any other languages other than English by default. Non English users might be interested in searching in their native language. \nMy solution to this was to use a different .js file for the extra language that I wanted to support where I registered a new stemmer. \nWe could also borrow some stemmers from this repository\n. That's exactly how I was thinking of doing it !. @mmistakes I am starting to think that using truncatewords while indexing content might not be that necessary. The index JSON is pre-built since we use Liquid to loop inside of our content and it's only about 28 kB. That itself is a huge performance gain. We could maybe get rid of truncatewords: 20 or use a larger number ?\n  . @mmistakes You are right, those files can get pretty big easily, I guess it depends on the user.\nI don't know much about Algolia though\n  . @mmistakes I really like their implementation however, I am not sure if there is going to be a performance gain this way. Don't you think it's better to have large JSON data that's generated with liquid than having to loop inside of a huge JSON file using Javascript (meaning the loop would take place upon loading the page) just to index the pages ? Could this slow things down ? . @mmistakes  Yes you're right its way better this way, you can test it out here . If you don't have anything else to add I can pull request. We could maybe make another script file like they've done in CloudCannon to store our data and that could be used by both lunr-en.js and lunr-gr.js ? . @mmistakes It would make sense but I personally find stemmers kind of complicated to make. I forgot to mention that I got the Greek one from this repository.  I am planning on adding the ones from lunr-languages however, I haven't tried using them yet.\n. @mmistakes Oops I forgot to set the default value.... Your solution looks great to me I totally missed that scenario.\nAs far as languages are concerned, Lunr doesn't work at all with Greek or any other non-latin alphabet by default. Languages that use latin characters might work but not well enough since they are most likely to use some extra characters too.\n  . @mmistakes Ok so while I was experimenting with Russian, I came to the conclusion that Stemmers, are useful but not as necessary as I presented them to be. So my sincere apologies for that. I will try to explain what is going on.\nFirst of all it was Lunr trimmer that blocked non-latin characters.\nWhile we were using idx.search(query) Stemmers were kind of necessary, but now that we use idx.query things are different. I replaced idx.search(query) because after the upgrade to the newest version of Lunr wildcards were not automatically added. That means that simply typing 'c' would give no results anymore. We would either have to type in a whole word for something to appear e.g. \"Cookies\", or the root of that word which would be \"Cook\". Root searching only works thanks to stemming. \nThings are a bit different now because we use \nidx.query(function (q) {\n  query.split(lunr.tokenizer.separator).forEach(function (term) {\n    q.term(term, { boost: 100 })\n       if(query.lastIndexOf(\" \") != query.length-1){\n        q.term(term, {  usePipeline: false, wildcard: lunr.Query.wildcard.TRAILING, boost: 10 })\n       }\n       if (term != \"\"){\n         q.term(term, {  usePipeline: false, editDistance: 1, boost: 1 })\n       }\n  })\n});\nWhich means that:\n- we give great priority to exact word or root matching q.term(term, { boost: 100 }) . \n- we give some priority to a query that starts with the same characters with a string in our dataset by using a trailing wildcard q.term(term, {  usePipeline: false, wildcard: lunr.Query.wildcard.TRAILING, boost: 10 })( Can often be inaccurate that's why it's inside of an if statement)\n- we give a little priority to a query that needs one edit to match with a word in our dataset q.term(term, {  usePipeline: false, editDistance: 1, boost: 1 }) e.g \"ede\" with \"edge\".\nSimply put, stemming is only useful in exact matching q.term(term, { boost: 100 })  because that way stemmed words get greater priority but other than that wildcards work okay for other languages now that Lunr trimmer is removed. I am still willing to work on other languages but I thought this is something you wanted to know.. @mmistakes I guess we can start messing with Algolia now. @mmistakes  hahahah thankfully I have got plenty of those where I live :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Sounds reasonable although it looks like I have implemented \"author archives\" too. If that's not something you are interested in then I'll close the issue.\n. My apologies, I didn't know that was the purpose of this file. . @justinrummel There don't seem to be any major updates in the API so I don't think this update is going to cause any issues. As @mmistakes has already stated the only custom configuration was in lurn-en.js and lurn-gr.js.. Hmm great idea! We could also use liquid to decide whether to truncate or not based on the number of posts there are.\n  . What if there is a safe zone parameter which gets activated when there are over a thousand posts and its default size is set to 50 but can also be modified to be lower or higher ? If that's too complicated then we could have some pre-set parameters like: safe which would be somewhere in the 50s and super-safe which would be 20.. Yes it really depends on the individual. The switch is great option too since it's more straight forward if the user has too much content they simply turn off the search_full_content parameter.. ",

I don't see anything using :nth-child here, nor in the gallery document in the _includes directory, which seems to get called here. \nMy current best guess is that I need to add something that takes care of archive subtitles in the Grid View, then perhaps all of this: \n` \n  .archive__item-title {\n    margin-top: 0.5em;\n    font-size: $type-size-5;\n  }\n.archive__item-excerpt {\n    display: none;\n  }\n@include breakpoint($small) {\n    @include gallery(5 of 10);\n    .archive__item-teaser {\n      max-height: 200px;\n    }\n  }\n@include breakpoint($medium) {\n    margin-left: 0; / reset before mixin does its thing/\n    margin-right: 0; / reset before mixin does its thing/\n    @include gallery(2.5 of 10);\n.archive__item-teaser {\n  max-height: 120px;\n}\n\n.archive__item-excerpt {\n  display: block;\n  font-size: $type-size-6;\n}`\n\nneeds to be placed inside of a wrapper?\nI'm pretty new to css in general -- any good documentation you could suggest that would be relevant to this puzzle?. Ack, I was looking at an older version of this document! I understand now :)\nIt's almost working! Now the category titles are in the correct places, more or less, but the second category seems to be offset by the wrong number of grid cells: \n\ndoes it matter the order in which clear: both appears under .grid__wrapper and .archive_subtitle?. Oh! I guess things just hadn't updated properly yet. \nMany thanks!!. ",

But does it work if protocol-less? Would the protocol be added somehow?\n(All examples I've seen - especially at https://meta.discourse.org/t/embedding-discourse-comments-via-javascript/31963 - always have the protocol in the generated JS.). Before my patch it didn't work. What prompted the solution was this: https://meta.discourse.org/t/solved-error-embedding/57276/2. \n\nNote the statement: \"Make sure the discourseEmbedUrl is a full URL, not a relative path\". I'll check that about the production environment. Thanks for the hint.\nBut doesn't //yorudomain.com try to open with the  file protocol (file:///yourdomain.com)?. Yes it seems ENV production or development has something to do with it; and I was checking one while I should have been looking at the other one. One possible improvement is to include the embedding only in production. Please see https://joebuhlig.com/discourse-commenting-for-jekyll/, the section \"Development Tweaks\". \nStill trying to see if protocol-less urls work, though.\n. Yes, the protocol-less urls seem to work too. So this should be documented better.\nHowever, I would suggest a better way is to take away the // from the assignment of discourseUrl because then it should work in all cases: \n\nPeople who don't know about the protocol-less trick (like me before this conversation!) will include the protocol in their site.comments.discourse.server setting.\nPeople who know and want to use the trick can set it explicitly there, i.e. by assigning //discourse.yourdomain.com to that same setting. \n\nWDYT?. OK. I see the point of backward compatibility.\nSo you can ignore the PR, but maybe do update the documentation for future users!\nThanks.. Maybe I misconfigured something, but I am pretty sure the canonical resulted in a relative url, and that's why I got here.

Because of the way CSS works, you can add all of your custom overrides or \"new\" CSS to a single file, assets/css/main.scss.\n\nBased on the structure page in your docs, I created an /assets/css/ directory in my repo and put the modified main.scss there, but nothing changes after pushing.. Exactly as you demonstrated earlier but with different px sizes.\n```scss\nOnly the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)\n\n@charset \"utf-8\";\n@import \"minimal-mistakes/skins/{{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin | default: 'default' }}\"; // skin\n@import \"minimal-mistakes\"; // main partials\n// https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1219#issuecomment-326809412\nhtml {\n    font-size: 12px; // originally 16px\n    @include breakpoint($medium) {\n        font-size: 14px; // originally 18px\n    }\n@include breakpoint($large) {\n    font-size: 16px; // originally 20px\n}\n\n@include breakpoint($x-large) {\n    font-size: 18px; // originally 22px\n}\n\n}\n```\n\n. You're probably right, I didn't think about the CSS being cached. I'm currently jacking up my DNS settings (lol) so I'll circle back to this a bit later. Thanks for the help.. Edit: Apparently I have to publish a page change -- then it updates. Success! Thanks again for the help.. Some quick follow-up, it still isn't working. (And just to be clear, there isn't any caching going on -- I can add a main.CSS, not scss, and it shows up instantly.) \nI know at this point it's probably nothing in your theme -- I've been talking to GitHub support about this the past few days. But I thought I'd share the weirdness, I suppose. To simplify matters, for testing purposes, the only CSS tag at the end of main.scss is a body background color setting, so it's very obvious when it does work.\nBottom line, the file seems to fail with anything in there except regular CSS. When I remove the charset and both imports, it will process. If I add just charset back, it fails. If I add just the imports back, it fails. Even just adding a // comment line to the file causes it to fail. I tried commenting out the skin entry (I'm using neon) and re-testing just charset, then just the imports, and even each individual import (which is nonsense, but I was trying everything), and it fails, so at least the skin files aren't somehow at fault. I even tried both types of comments (inline and block) and they cause failures both ways. \nNothing works except plain CSS in the file by itself. I suppose I should clarify all tests had empty front matter.\nIt's all pretty strange -- especially since it did process exactly one time, seemingly at random, but never again. It even failed later on when I set up the file the same way that worked that single time.\nHopefully GitHub support can tell us something useful.

    "douglangille": "I am trying to do pagination, but with the jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin. \nWhat I can't seem to accomplish is disabling the legacy configuration in _config.yml so I can take advantage of the newer plugin.\nJekyll throws this on build: \nPagination: You are running jekyll-paginate backwards compatible pagination logic. Please ignore all earlier warnings displayed related to the old jekyll-paginate gem. \nPagination: Detected legacy jekyll-paginate logic running. Please update your configs to use the jekyll-paginate-v2 logic. This compatibility function will stop working after Jan 1st 2018 and your site build will throw an error.\nThe testing I've done suggests that the default legacy config comes through when commented out: \n```\npaginate: 12 # amount of posts to show\npaginate_path: /page:num/\n```\nStill paginates at 5. If I uncomment out, then the 12 posts show.. Reference: https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md#backwards-compatibility-with-jekyll-paginate. @dev4223 I got it to work locally with a fork too-- just really hoping I can get it to run with the gem theme. It makes things so much cleaner.. Wow. jekyll-data is tenacious! I've tried nil, false, blank, an actual blank-- all with and without quotes.\nIt feels like this is the right track as now I get:\nConfig Warning: Thepaginatekey must be a positive integer or nil. It's currently set to 'nil'.\nHowever, the 5 keeps poking through.. Will do. Thanks\n. So after some investigation by @sverrirs, it looks like: \n(a) there is some legacy paginate code in Jekyll that needs scrubbing (https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6391), and \n(b) the new paginate plugin is confirmed to be working as expected (https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/issues/37#issuecomment-332614079).\nI'm not sure where that leaves things, because the bundled config file can't be overridden by nil.. Welp, the short answer for me is I'll have to move back to using the forked version rather than the gem-theme. Not ideal, but I'll get the result needed. If jekyll/jekyll addresses this, I'll try again.. That's awesome @jaybe-jekyll.  I managed to get things (pagination/autopages) to work with the gem'd theme with only minor mods. I'll add my feedback to the new issue you create.. This is what I did to get it to work on https://douglangille.ca with the gem'd theme:\nhttps://github.com/douglangille/douglangille/blob/master/_config.yml\nhttps://github.com/douglangille/douglangille/blob/master/_includes/paginator.html\nhttps://github.com/douglangille/douglangille/blob/master/_layouts/autopage.html\nAs mentioned elsewhere, moving from jekyll-paginate to jekyll-paginate-v2 will remove the need for jekyll-archives. There will need to be some cleanup in a few places to fix that up. Right now, I have to leave references to jekyll-archives in _config.yml because I'm lazy.\nI like @mmistakes' hand-rolled trailpath in paginator.html and I had to hack at it to get it to work with jekyll-paginate-v2.

    "jaybe-jekyll": "Notes:\n\n\nThe minimal-mistakes-jekyll gem has an _includes/paginator.html include which gets included to produce the paging navigation and [lovely] UI. See the theme's _layouts/home.html layout for the calling.\n\n\nThe include refers to site.pagination_path to build the [proper] reference links to navigate between pages.\n\nNote site.pagination_path refers to jekyll-paginate (version 1), not v2.  Ergo, out of box, minimal-mistakes-jekyll gem is not designed to be compatible with jekyll-pagination-v2.\n\nFor example, if you try to use pagination outside of root path/URI / breakage will occur with pagination... unless adaptation to _includes/paginator.html has been accommodated.\n\ne.g. ...{{ page.pagination.mypaginator_path | replace: ':cat', page.autopages.display_name | replace: 'page:num', '' | replace: '//', '/' | absolute_url %}}...\n\n\n\nThe default _config.yml for minimal-mistakes-jekyll theme/gem does not contain configuration for jekyll-paginate-v2, which requires new/additional/different configuration to enable... both in _config.yml and then within the pages where you desire pagination, e.g.:\n\n\n/index.html\n\n---\n...\nlayout: my_home_layout_pagination_ready\npagination:\nenabled\nper_page: 2\n...\n\n\n---\n\nI was eventually able to integrate and implement:\n- minimal-mistakes-jekyll\n- jekyll-paginate-v2\n  - ...along with it's AutoPages feature to generate category, tag, collection pages, etc.\nIt required addressing the aforementioned aspects however, which meant having the following files and adjusted outside of the minimal-mistakes-jekyll gem theme:\n- ./_layout/home.html\n- ./_layout/archive-taxonomy.html\n- ./_includes/paginator.html\n- ./index.html\n- ./_config.yml (expected)\nWould very much like to see jekyll-paginate-v2 integration and capabilities without the need to maintain and manage core theme files within the site/source.

    "edemaine": "@mmistakes Is there a particular reason that jquery-smooth-scroll isn't included in this theme by default?  It's pretty unexpected behavior that clicking on a TOC link doesn't add the hash fragment to the URL.  Personally, I'd like the hash fragment to also update while scrolling (as on e.g. https://coffeescript.org/), though I can understand that's a more stylistic choice.. @mmistakes Thanks for the quick review! I rebased to master, and upon further testing, added a commit that switches from hashchange to popstate event handler (natural given that we're using history.pushState).  This seems to behave better with the Forward button (wasn't scrolling before), on page load (scrolled inconsistently), and always scrolls in the right direction (before, it seemed to go to the top of the page and scroll down, even if using the back button ought to just scroll you up).  This should be ready to go now!\n. @maxime-michel Sorry for the delay. My reading of RFC 3986 defining URLs suggests that #...%C3%AA really should be equivalent to #...\u00ea, i.e., the percent encodings should in fact be decoded.  Clearly something (presumably some JavaScript) is buggy, though.  Have you noticed whether this was specific to my changes, or perhaps a general smooth-scrolling bug?  I will investigate.. Fixed, thanks!  Sorry, I forgot about themes.\nI guess another question is whether there should be an option to turn the auto-hash-changing functionality off.  But hopefully (most?) everyone wants it.. Great, thanks! (And sorry for the previous bug-ish behavior.). Sorry I haven't had a chance to look this over yet (a busy week) but thanks @mmistakes for taking the lead here! Relying more on off-the-shelf packages seems like a generally good idea, so I'm happy to see this in the works.  If you let me know when you tweak the settings, I'm happy to take the second testdrive.. @mmistakes Ah, that is unfortunate.  It indeed seems that the Gumshoe code doesn't handle this case of headers implicitly defining sections.  Surprising!  I've opened an issue on the Gumshoe Github: https://github.com/cferdinandi/gumshoe/issues/97. @mmistakes I don't see Gumshoe 5.1.0 on https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/2082 or https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/smooth-scroll-gumshoe. Perhaps you didn't push, or I'm looking in the wrong place? A commit ID would also suffice.. Thanks! I just did a quick test of my (very long) single-page site (local build -- public version hasn't been updated), and here's my impression:\n Long-distance scrolling is slow and stuttery (on Chrome on Windows).  Clicking on a distanct TOC item took 10+ seconds to scroll.  It seems there's a limit to speed, but I'd rather have a limit on time (0.5 seconds?) like we used to have.\n Scrolling to a new section no longer changes the URL to refer to the current section. Is this intentional? It's a change from previous behavior. On the other hand, clicking on a TOC link does change the URL, which is a nice improvement from old versions.. @mmistakes Thanks for the link. As I guessed, the speed setting is by default an amount of time to scroll 1000px. My document is around 40,000px, so it can take 12 seconds to scroll.\nIf we add the speedAsDuration: true option, though, then speed should be the total time for an animation. The default for jquery-smooth-scroll is 400ms, so to leave things as they were, we could use the following settings:\nspeed: 400ms\nspeedAsDuration: true\nAlternatively, we can set durationMax: 500 or something like that.  Then short scrolls will be faster, but long scrolls won't be too long.\nI tried this on my local copy, and both approaches work: my scrolls are no longer several seconds. Unfortunately, I'm still getting a very jerky motion: I only get a couple of screen refreshes per second.. I just tried disabling Gumshoe, and the scroll is nice and smooth again.  In the code I wrote, I disabled Gumshoe during smooth scrolls, exactly for performance. Maybe we'll need to do this manually again.\nThe problem seems to be that Gumshoe's scrollHandler uses window.requestAnimationFrame instead of debounce, which means that it is running on every frame of the scroll animation, instead of realizing that scrolling is still happening and waiting for that to stop.. I tried to reproduce the problem outside this theme, but it doesn't seem to happen with just Gumshoe + SmoothScroll.  A performance analysis with Chrome suggests that it's entirely caused by FontAwesome's data-search-pseudo-elements feature.  Do you use that in this theme?  If not, I think removing it would remove the bad performance I'm seeing.. Cool, thanks!  I just tested b9c0461eb3af8ec8e435882cdbe747839937b72f and it looks good to me!.

I'd say this is correct, although from my reading of #943, it wouldn't have been possible (putting the page.og_image after page.overlay_image)? But your description of it here seems to be what I want, yes.\nI wasn't aware of that jekyll-seo-tag feature, I'll look into it, so that I'm ready for switching to it (at a quick glance, it does seem to have nice features!). Until then, I might make a local change to seo.html, then, thanks for letting me know your plans around this.\nI've certainly experienced the behaviour of Facebook taking whatever image it thinks is appropriate when it scrapes the page, if no og:image is provided! It seems safer to explicitly tell it what image to use, leaving one free to use whatever image you want for the design of the page itself.\nIt is nice to be able to provide a sensible default, though, so the current behaviour (of Minimal Mistakes using the overlay_image) seems quite sensible to have.\nThanks for your help!. If I'd do it locally, I'd just change the {% if page.header.image %} of the second block into an elsif, and add a {% if page.og_image %} at the top of that block. Just the simplest thing that'll work... :wink:\nBut I'll keep an eye on if you do anything here, too. :smiley: . I'm not Jekyll expert, and even worse of a web designer, by the way! My strength is more in backend services. :stuck_out_tongue: \nBut I see what you mean with the DRY, you can do the image selection once, assign it to something, and then do the meta tags once, using that variable....

Everyone else is just able to set up redirects and it works. Others don't seem to have this problem with Jekyll. However, my site doesn't render correctly or isn't available. That's why I thought it might be due to the theme I use.. @tony-ho hey tony, thanks. I was certain I tested that already, but probably not without deactivating all the rules at the same time. It seems to work now. I've deactivated all redirections in cloudflare and just activated \"always use https\". Thank you! \nI also deactivated the \"remote theme\" option again. This caused issues when I was testing offline and doesn't seem to make any difference when I host it on github.\nThanks @everyone for your help!. Thanks, that's good to know. Then I'll have to rethink my approach.. ",
    "shredtechular": "Thanks for the feedback!\nI didn't realize that about author__avatar so I removed that in my update 890cf66.  I also updated the Configuration docs adding a line for the author site variable.\nAs far as the name of what variable to use there, I'm also open to suggestions on what might be the most clear.  Instead of link_back I changed it to simply home with the reasoning that folks that use this feature would probably be wanting to link to either the site's \"home\" page or an author \"home\" or \"index\" page.  Do you like that better or does that still not describe it adequately?\n. Hmm, I see what you are saying and I like the idea to \n\npull social-share-custom-links.html out of social-share.html and place it directly below it, as social-share-custom.html\n\nfor purposes of completely replacing the default social sharing buttons if desired... But then I think it does go back to what you were saying if they wanted to do that, why not just modify the social-sharing.html file, because any parent theme updates to that file wouldn't really matter anyway if those buttons were completely replaced.  So, that's why I was thinking this as more of an extension to the default than a replacement...\nBut, maybe this isn't the best solution and we should close it out.  Maybe instead of having those \"default\" buttons hardcoded into the social-share.html include file, that we use a yml data file/config to populate those buttons more dynamically and allow the end user to configure those buttons within yml?  Does that make sense and thoughts on if that would be better/preferable?\nAnd if you'd rather not do either, I can easily close this out and live without it too!  Again, this was just something I was thinking of but can certainly get around it locally.\n. ",

Something I recently thought about was to replace TravisCI with Netlify (not for hosting, just for pushing records).\nThe way it would work would be to have Netlify listen to every push to master and run jekyll algolia in response. It won't even have to host anything, just run jekyll algolia to update your records in parallel of GitHub Pages deploying the website.\nWould that be easier for you?

    "user414": "First thanks for the great theme @mmistakes, very useful. Should we keep this request open since google CSE is still not supported or should we open a new one to keep track of it? We were also looking to support google CSE and came upon this issue.. Thanks to the great structure of your theme and the relative ease of the google custom search we did an implementation that we are going to deploy and thought to share it upstream. Please let me know if you would like to see any modification for the merge. Thanks again for the great theme.. @mmistakes Unfortunately not yet. . @mmistakes Ok good idea. I'm not sure how well Full Width would work since that is meant for a search box/search result combo box provided by Google and we use the result only model. We tried with using the Google provide search box but it just did not fit as well with the rest of the theme. \nAs far as the comments did you mean adding it to the _config.yml, or in the proper documentation somewhere in doc like 05-configuration.md, or both? \nAs a side note while there was some instruction on how to restyle the results, as we thought the regular green/blue might be to big of a clash with the gray theme, we thought that when using the google minimalist look and feel theme in the CSE options it matches pretty well the color scheme and saw no need to import all the google style class inside.. > Adding something I don't use personally causes a clash when I start getting support requests about it.\nI can definitely understand that, feel free to leave it as a PR if you think it's going to create support headache down the line. Anyway, it's fairly easy if someone just want to copy paste they can just hard code their engine id and put everything in search_form.html to minimize the update maintenance. \nAs a side note re-looking at the code I forgot to either namespace the javascript or change it to a less generic function name like googleCustomSearchExecute() instead of executeQuery() which could collide down the road with something else. .

    "dvhart": "Thanks @mmistakes. I started the modifications and got something mostly working. One of the goals in using this theme was to minimize any changes to the theme and to keep it separate from my repository with a gem. Hoping I can find something that is minimally invasive and configurable that you might consider including. I'll share whatever I come up with. Thank you for the response.. I've completed the overrides necessary to make this \"work\" for me. I've abused the page__meta class a bit to display both the date and the read-time. I'd like it to be smaller, and it doesn't work quite right with the archive tiles.\nThe home page now displays the date as well as the read-time. This could be smaller, and maybe gray or a lighter weight.\n\nThe same code displays now just above the content, regardless if overlay is used or not. This should definitely be smaller.\n\nFinally, the \"date read-time\" doesn't wrap well in the archive post tiles, but the same code is used to create the wider home layout entries as these tiles, I wasn't sure how to go about that in a better way.\n\nMy solution is here https://github.com/dvhart/dvhart.github.io/commit/05b076b63fd6b758c020770a4f8d9ca0cd2ef28e, with my changes in comment blocks. I could submit these in a pull request to you @mmistakes if you're interested in discussing them and would prefer that mechanism. I know they aren't ready as they are, and they need some way to include configuration so that they don't break existing deployments of Minimal Mistakes. Are you interested in incorporating a configurable version of this? If so, I'm happy to do what I can - but I'm no designer, and this is my first time looking at jekyll and ruby. I have some very dated css experience.\n. Thanks for your time @mmistakes, and for sharing your excellent work. I will look for ways to minimize my overrides, as having to override entire files like single.html is counter to the goals of using a gem theme and may pose a maintenance issue longer term. Perhaps that will lead to something which I can contribute back (no changes, just refactoring to minimize overrides). I'll close this one out.. The site wide boolean solution seems pretty minimally invasive, just the following to page__hero.html:\n-      {% if page.excerpt %}\n+      {% if page.excerpt and site.overlay_excerpt %}\nAnd adding overlay_excerpt: (true|false) to _config.yml. If the above is acceptable, I can prepare a PR and update the documentation accordingly at the same time.. One last thought for now. page.header.overlay_excerpt as a boolean is even better. More flexibility, no more invasive.. Yes, for my purposes, the simple boolean is plenty. I'm currently using 'page.header.overlay_excerpt: false' and added that to the conditional in page__hero.html. Adding it to the default in the theme _config.yml to true I think would complete the feature and maintain existing behavior. If you're OK with this, I'll prepare the patch, docs, and PR.. I was planning on doing a doc change at the same time, but it appears this should go in the gh-pages branch, so should be a separate PR.. Gah, found the docs dir - closing and will re-open a single PR with both change and doc.. It wasn't clear to me if the gh-pages-3.1.6 was the right place to do this given the current theme version at 4.8.1, but it seemed like the a reasonable place to start.. Gah, found the docs dir - closing and will re-open a single PR with both change and doc.. OK, this is a misunderstanding on my part regarding default values of variables. Does the _config.yml in this repository have no effect on default values? I set page.header.show_overlay_excerpt to true thinking that was how this is done. Clearly I'm brand spanking to new to jekyll, ruby, and gems. I'll test with your suggestion and resubmit.. Agreed. That behavior was my intention. Testing the fix now.. And there's a typo: test should be text in the new line. I will resubmit after you've had a chance to review and roll in any changes you want me to make (like variable name for example).. ",

I just performed a build using remote_theme: mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.10.1 and built successfully.

I reviewed and verified package.json in your repo shows 4.10.1 . Hopefully this is enough information to shed some light on my ignorance :-)  Thanks again for this awesome theme and your fantastic contribution to the community.. I did a cache empty and reload in chrome in incognito, still shows 4.9. I will run docker command to force rebuild. I've not published, it's running locally only. I'll let you know the result. fyi, my repo is not what I'm testing with. I actually learned about remote theme's later on , and have a local forked copy of your remote theme demo repo that I'm doing all my testing with. \n\nI'll have to figure out how to use the gem based approach with only overrides included as all I want to do is eliminate manual updates, and if the gem based approach can do that, I'll do that way instead. I just am newer to gem's, so must have missed that it worked similar.\n. Followed the directions for ruby gem method and worked great. Must be something with the remote_theme issue. I removed everything except my customized stuff and used the gem approach and it gave me the updated version. Thanks again for the beautiful theme. I got a great complement on the clean design today from someone, so that's a positive!. Thank you I converted over to the ruby gem approach and thought I had cleared out all contents required. I'll remove those culprits. Thanks for the quick help. . @mmistakes if you get a sec would you mind telling me if I'm doing some obviously wrong with this again? It's not working and I've spent hours trying to fix. \nI've verified my \n- main.min.js is up to date\n- my theme is up to date\n- algolia is running the latest\n- the index was built\n- no console errors noted\n- the javascript files seem to be loaded when examining in chrome dev tools\nNot sure why the button won't click! It's like I messed up something with the javascript, though I searched my entire repo (using remote gem) and couldn't find any code for search or algolia that might be in there. \nIf you have any ideas I'd appreciate it as I've sunk a lot of time in it, and I'm guessing it's something very simple I'm just clueless on.. Thank you so much! I will figure out why it's missing. That's the help I needed. Much appreciated. I'm using remote theme and in your documentation I think it points towards this being included in the remote theme. Any tip on why I would be having an issue when I'm not providing that file in the first place? I thought I saw the reference as a resource in the header. . Found it! \nCould you consider making the documentation put WARNING notice on the following content: \n\nSite scripts\nAdd scripts to the  or closing  elements by assigning paths to either head_scripts and/or footer_scripts.\nFor example, to add a CDN version of jQuery to page\u2019s head along with a custom script you\u2019d do the following:\nhttps://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-scripts\n\nPer the following content I found in: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/22a9c523d6be13becc6fe0ed38b065e3489e498f/docs/_docs/17-javascript.md\n\nNote: If you assign footer_scripts the theme's /assets/js/main.min.js file will be deactivated. This script includes jQuery and various other plugins that you'll need to find replacements for and include separately. {: .notice--warning}\n\nI used that section as a reference and only now in searching the repo found out that the footer deactivates the main.min.js\nThanks again! Glad I finally have the solution after all this troubleshooting.\n. Thank you! So this would require me to link to itself to open up in expanded view? Ie\n[![](img.jpg)](img.jpg)\nThis nested syntax is a little rough to use. Would you consider an option that clicking standard images would expand similar to gallery? If not I'll have to come up with this myself but thought I'd ask as seems valuable for those using images that contain detail difficult to see when not expanded. \nThanks!. ",
    "matiasfrndz": "Hi Michael, thanks for your feedback. I understand that you work on Windows. The default there is to use CRLF. As far as I understand, Git converts line endings upon checkin and checkout, see Formatting and Whitespace in the Git documentation. Furthermore, I guess that you may be building the Gems on your Windows platform and that this process leaves line endings as they are when checked out. This would explain why the line endings in the Git repository (on GitHub) have LF line endings and the files in the Gem have CRLF line endings.\nWhat I don't understand is that the issue only appears when copying template files from the Gem file into my repository (without changing the line endings). When using jekyll build without copying the templates files, the issue doesn't appear. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. I've checked some jekyll themes on RubyGems and it looks as if most use Linux style line endings (LF). I'd probably recommend using end_of_line = lf in .editorconfig, this may require changing core.autocrlf in your Git config.. I checked again. The only gem version affected by this is 4.10.0. Both versions 4.8.1 and the current version 4.10.1 don't have this issue, i.e. the files have Linux stye LF line endings.\nBased on that you can probably close this issue.\n. ",

I'm filling all required fields when commenting.\nThe error I get from console is: Cannot GET /v2/entry/pateskinasy/pateskinasy.github.io/master/comments\n\nAny hints on how to proceed?. Thanks once again for the hints @mmistakes \nAs an update for others getting stuck in the future: I did not manage to get to the root of what was causing the issue (sth with JS was off). My way to fix it was to revert the codebase to a previous \"working commit\" and apply your fix of moving all comment-related data and paths to /_data/comments/\nClosing this off now.. Thanks for the feedback @coliff and @mmistakes .\nJumping into @mmistakes' question on the need for it:\nThe main reason I've decided to bring this improvement suggestion to the project is because I'm using Minimal Mistakes for a blog. Since 'by nature', a stand-alone blog doesn't have social features (like Medium's Follows/Applauds, etc), managing a list of \"subscribers\" you can push new posts and newsletters to, may be a good help getting bloggers' new posts discovered and more of your content seen.\nMailchimp's code allows automatic pop-ups to collect emails out of the box (you'll find it in your Mailchimp dashboard). But they are annoying \ud83e\udd37 as they pop-up automatically to every visitor to your blog \ud83d\ude1e. The code above makes the pop-up work on-click.\nShould you guys think this can be a good addition, I can give the improvements with Liquid condition and variables a go on the weekend. Let me know.. Well, I have on my to-do list for improvements on my blog to add a simple one line input field (no box) form for newsletter in my sidebar, in my footer, and in a 50px hello bar top of screen. So, I\u2019m with you @maxime-michel \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. Thanks Michael once again for the support. It worked. . Exactly! All sorted now! Massive thanks Michael!. Thanks for the feedback @coliff . That specific line came straight from Mailchimp's 'pop-up code'. I've customized the rest of the code to make it work on-click and not automatically. \nIndependently, true, bringing HTTPS in and removing 'type' won't hurt. More comments from me below.. ",

    "kcha": "I tried adding some content in two scenarios, one with enough content to overfill the viewport and one without. In the first case, it behaves as expected -- the footer immediately follows the end of the content as you scroll down. In the second case, it's still the same as what I showed above. I found one example online of a page that has minimal content, but the footer is visible in all views: https://zenglix.github.io/links/, which to me is the behaviour I was expecting. It looks like the page is using an older version of the theme and I haven't checked what may have changed. Although if you think the current behaviour is to be expected, then I will drop this issue. Thanks!. ",
    "mplacona": "Thanks @mmistakes. I'd already tried that, but it doesn't quite solve the problem. When you set the build for production, you're basically saying \"use the url as it is in my _config.xml\". In the example you gave me, the author changes the url to be what they want locally. However, deploying this to production would mean changing that again, which is prone to errors.\nIdeally, if you use a relative path instead, the url stops getting on the way.. Right on! Doing that solved it.\nStill think it would be easier to just use relative urls to avoid the \"hackery\" around how you start Jekyll, but this completely solved it.\nThank you for the responsiveness!. Totally makes sense. I went ahead and rolled my own version here in case anyone ever finds this thread and wants to do the same.\nThank you!. ",

Some sort of notice box with a title, some text, and the ability to add fields through YAML. This is something I use across websites and the code duplication makes me sad. What do you guys think? I can submit a PR.. This is what I currently run: https://github.com/maxime-michel/asg/commit/b248524e8426a662b2f7ae9c067faa7a94f12dd1. With some checks on Liquid variables and a little help on the design side, I believe it could be a good addition.\n. Would you be OK with a PR that opens the endpoint URL to possible configuration?. Sure. I saw you initially requested that but I wasn't sure it was what you actually meant. Then I saw an occurrence of {{ site.comments.disqus.shortname }}, which made me go for this approach. But sure, I don't mind.. @mmistakes I don't mean to be spammy but did you get a notification for the changes I pushed right after your comment?. What is the risk of not being compliant, as a small site owner?. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to join the effort if there's a subtask that I could help with. But it's hard to make it a priority for me as well, when I still routinely see national-level companies that send email without any sort of opt-out.. That's helpful, thanks. Another suggestion could be to use the youtube-nocookie.com domain as well as the ?dnt=true flag for Vimeo embeds in the video include.. I'll take care of it.. Thanks for the pointers, I can totally do that indeed. But, if I may, what is the point in such a default? I didn't have the image you captured in mind when thinking about this issue, but it's actually a good example.\nIf you embed a tall picture, say of somebody standing, then regardless of whether you have an image large enough to endure the zoom (which was my initial issue with another picture), then it'll be huge on both axises. Or am I missing something?. OK, fair enough, I'll work around it. Thanks for the fast help!. I just noticed a small issue with this where clicking on the TOC won't jump to the title when said title contains special characters. The generated HTML is:\n<li><a href=\"#rel%C3%A2chement-des-jambes\">Rel\u00e2chement des jambes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#bien-%C3%AAtre-int%C3%A9gral\">Bien-\u00eatre int\u00e9gral</a></li>\n\nBut the JS tries to hit #rel\u00e2chement-des-jambes, and obviously there's no match. Which of the two is preferable, though?. No problem. No, I'd never tried the shortcuts before I read the feature got introduced.\nOn a non-Jekyll vanilla HTML page, as long as the subtitle's id is encoded, both versions of the hash can access it. With the theme, though, first of all the title isn't encoded (but there isn't much that could be done about that from the theme, I guess). But even when I override it to the encoded version, that still doesn't work.\nSo I'm kind of stuck on this one, if your own investigation leads to some concrete lead, I'd be happy to help, though.. I've never used v3 either, what does it bring to the table?\nWith v2 you'd want the endpoint property to look something like https://your-private-staticman-deploy.heroku.com/v2/entry/.. Excellent idea, that works great, thanks a lot. I'll open a PR to have it mentioned it in the docs.. ",

As I scroll down, I see blank space first and then the content is rendered after a considerable delay. \nHere are some more observations:\n\n\nI can only reproduce this on my blog (which uses MM theme) and the MM site itself. I tried reproducing on very graphic intensive sites with lots of ads etc. but could not reproduce on those sites. So that indicates to me that it has something to do with the theme.\n\n\nI can't reproduce it 100% of the time even on my blog and MM site. For example, right now I can't reproduce it on either site.\n\n\nA few times when it happened, I shut down my browser (Chrome) completely and restarted it hoping that the issue would go away, but it didn't. I then closed all other applications and ensured that there were plenty of system resources available, but the issue still didn't go away. Ultimately I had to reboot my machine, and that got rid of the issue (temporarily) before coming back again after 2-3 days.\n\n\nI mostly use Chrome browser and keep it on the latest stable public release. The next time it happens, I'll test it across all the browsers at my disposal and update the results here.. I'll try it out when I'm able to reproduce the issue (hopefully in the next few days). But let me make it clear. The initial page loading is not a problem. The pages load quite fast (I'm on a 1 Gbps fibre line), but the issue appears on long pages (not very long either), when I scroll down or back up. The content just renders very slowly.

Great work!! thanks a lot I owe you a beer! . ~~One question...~~ One more than one question...\nWouldn't be better to use smooth-scroll.min.js and gumshoe.min.js? I'm actually using smooth-scroll.min.js and it seems fine. I really don't know if it's better or worse. I don't have that technical knowledge. I just guess that .min is easier to load. \nSince I have a fixed header I have added an offset \u201460 in my case. This account for the masthead and a little bit more so the headers in the text aren't too close the masthead. I have this option on both gumshoe and smooth-scroll. In both of them seems that you can point to the masthead css selector and it would calculate the height. In smooth-scroll is just an option and in gumshoe is a function. The option in smooth-scroll seems to work, but I make it work in gumshoe. \nAnyway, it would be great if it could be set up to calculate the height of the masthead and you can add a little bit more. I tried to accomplish it with the formula, but no luck. (I don't know java). >I'm not using the minified versions in the source folder as they're minified by the npm run build:js task that smooshes all the theme's JavaScript into a single file.\nThats true... hahaha I didn't realized that I'm double minifying. \ud83d\ude1d \n\nThe theme isn't using a fixed header so I don't think there's a way for me to easily bake that in for users like you who have customized the theme.

( now trying to figure about 4 columns on mobile screen)\n```\n&.fourth {\n\na,\nimg {\n    @include breakpoint($small) {\n      width: calc(25% - 0.5em);\n    }\n  }\n\nfigcaption {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n``\n**Is that all I need to add as many column functionality I want?** (since I am very beginner and worried I have left anything out?) \n. **Thanks...  that worked**\nI ended up creating a new class.fourth-preserve, so I can have flexibility to use it with regular.fourthclass. Then I was not able to stop myself and created.half-preserve,.third-preserve and.fifth-preserve` too. Just being a little future-proof.   \nYes you are right the content may suffer, but I want this for particularly for a single section of the About page on my website, very less likely to be used in any other cases.\n. I am  closing this issue, since @mmistakes provides a custom css fix and I have created custom classes as per requirement.\n. Not yet. I was in doubt if I am doing something  wrong. \nYou can check my repo for folder structure and _config.ymlfile.\nhttps://github.com/Kulbhushan-Chand/Kulbhushan-Chand.github.io. I have submitted an issue in jekyll at https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7264. Issue on jekyll was closed with possible simple fix in _config.yml.\nI am AFK for few days and will impliment the solution asap upon resuming work and will give feedback.. Issue resolved by the simple fix. @mmistakes\nRequesting your comment in the discussion regarding this same issue on this page and on https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7264\nDetailed reason for the issue was provided in the comment https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7264#issuecomment-425365301\nI got the fix but found the same problem in minimal-mistakes theme (creation of _pages in _site).\nhttps://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7264#issuecomment-425389479\nYour contribution to the discussion will be very fruitful. . You had me convinced about the added visual clutter because of table of contents. Personally I too give less attention to them. However this may be a dormant feature in the theme. Also the bug in the current tocimplementation (see the last paragraph of this comment).\nMy main motive was to get your attention to this closed issue - link1\nwhere the person had implimented the same on this page - link2 . It seems like he has implimented it very easily.\nYou can see in link 2, he have implemented the scrollable toc. Check this commit \nand the following consecutive commits you can decipher the css changes made by him.\nAgain I would say that the present system of tocin the theme have problem  displaying large number of headings in the post. \n### To see the problem - You can try to add a lot of headings in the post and in yaml add toc_sticky: true. In this case the table of content will overflow from the page and the last enteries on the list of toc will not be accessible.. Thanks for the pointer to limit headlines.. > One bit of feedback, when I try the gallery post where it shows multiple images and I select one and it opens up the lightbox... closing the lightbox with the X causes some red rectangle to show up very fast. This doesn't look good. Can you fix that?\n@ansiblejunky Even I have that red rectangle problem, but choose to ignore that. I hope there is a fix.. Thanks, I have styled it away by including it it main.scss file. I'm closing this pull request, since you are using similar attribute (defer) on fontawesome.js. \nRegarding use of asyncon main.js, I'm not sure if there is any other dependent scripts used elsewhere in the theme which might gets affected. . Closing this issue. Pl see comment https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/1918#issuecomment-439769402.

This doesn't look good. Can you fix that?\nBy the way, it's a really nice theme you created. Thank you!\n. I figured it out. I had my API Key restricted to the Index Name - but I assumed since it was the same index name that is described in the _config.yml it wouldn't be a problem. It was a problem. So I removed all index restrictions on my API Key and that solved the problem.. Thank you. You respond to these questions/bugs super fast! Appreciate it.. Ok, I found some helpful information from this issue. I created a new feature_row_posts include as you said but I had to change the code to reference post.header.teaser instead of image_path because no post ever has the image_path in the front matter of course - this info is already defined in the header.teaser variable so no need to define it twice.\nHowever, I did notice that using your alternate method of the following code in my index.html will remove the buttons but also show the time estimate for the article, which is nicer.  However 4 columns is a bit much, so it seems I need to play around with all of this a bit more.\n<div class=\"grid__wrapper\">\n  {% for post in site.posts limit:4 %}\n    {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %}\n  {% endfor %}\n</div>\nOne thing though, the pagination is gone now from the home page using any of these solutions. So how to bring that back?\n. Ok, so now I tried the code you suggested:\n<div class=\"grid__wrapper\">\n  {% for post in site.paginator %}\n    {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %}\n  {% endfor %}\n</div>\nAnd with the site.paginator my home page is totally empty. Doesn't seem to work at all.. In fact, I don't think I remember seeing any pagination on the homepage when I got the theme in the beginning. It was only on the posts pages. . Ok thanks. Where in your theme do you actually load/reference the Font Awesome font? I could not find that.. So you are using the Font Awesome Free? I have literally tried solving this problem but still getting that block square icon no matter what I try. Here is what I have written now in my main.scss.\n@font-face {\n    font-family: 'FontAwesome';\n    src: url('../fonts/fa-solid-900.eot');\n  }\nblockquote::before {\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-style: normal;\n    font-variant: normal;\n    text-rendering: auto;\n    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n    font-family: \"FontAwesome\";\n    font-weight: 900; content: \"\\f007\";\n  }\nAnd then I downloaded the files from https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/tree/master/web-fonts-with-css/webfonts and moved them to assets/fonts/ folder.  However, this still produces the square icon. \nSo at this point I am out of any other options. Anyone else can offer advice here it would be much appreciated.\n. Additionally, I tried the following in the main.scss but it didn't work.\n```\n@import url(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/master/web-fonts-with-css/css/fontawesome-all.min.css\"); / FA CSS import /\n/ ... /\nblockquote:before {\n    / >> Symbol you want to use: /\n    content: \"\\f16c\";\n    / >> Name of the FA free font (mandatory)\n               - 'Font Awesome 5 Free' for Regular and Solid symbols;\n               - 'Font Awesome 5 Brand' for Brands symbols. /\n    font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free';\n    / >> Weight of the font (mandatory)\n               - 400 for Regular and Brands symbols;\n               - 900 for Solid symbols. /\n    font-weight: 900;\n/* >> Optional styling: */\ndisplay: inline-block;\n/* ... */\n\n}\n```.

It's strongly advised, in these cases, to seek legal help.\nIf you do not track your user, you should not worry that much, except for that cookies that are used by third parties. You can just disable GA, for example and use old school log analysis like awstats. \nNow, Minimal Mistakes, doesn't track their users (us) and as soon as you install and configure it, it becomes your responsibility how you use the theme. \nIt could be nice if Minimal Mistakes would includes: \n\na coockie-consent like functionality, that turn off by default all the tracking features.\nTemplate GDPR page\n\nHonestly, for the latter we could do ourself, as it's just a page at the end and the privacy policy content should be tailored to your needs and cannot, therefore, be a general template. Minimal Mistakes makes quite easy to customise the footer, so you can add a privacy policy page link in the footer.\nRegarding the cookie consent feature, it's quite important and the bare minimum needed to respect (partly) the GDPR.

So I extracted the css files by running the theme locally in default and dark mode. i saved them as main.css and dark.css\n pulled up kdiff3 and compared the key differences\n set up CSS variables for the differences\n started substituting the CSS colors in the main.css with the variables.\n added a light class to the <body> tag\n toggled that class on click of a button using javascript.\nyou can see it in action here (shameless plug) - my dev site\nThere are a few other decorations on the site which are not directly from the dark theme but the above is the gist.\nI am sure Michael will come up with a better solution than that of the above monstrosity. Eagerly waiting as this issue has been marked with the Enhancement label.. OS + browser can go all dark mode on their browser menu but they can only go as far as just applying a dark contrast mode on the website content, which may lead to the website visuals getting all messed up. So it is actually upto the website developer to manage/feature their own dark mode.. suggestion\n  <script data-search-pseudo-elements defer src=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.7.1/js/all.js\" integrity=\"sha384-eVEQC9zshBn0rFj4+TU78eNA19HMNigMviK/PU/FFjLXqa/GKPgX58rvt5Z8PLs7\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\ncan we add the data-search-pseudo-elements parameter to the script tag as well in this PR so as to enable CSS pseudo elements as we are using the JS framework.

They are being used extensively in the theme, but using the font awesome icons as pseudo elements is not possible because it is disabled by default in the js framework. Since there is absolutely no overhead by enabling it but provides some additional functionalities, I was in favour of adding it. I will leave the decision upto @mmistakes.. ",

There's a bit of fiddling to do to get the form appearing and talking to the v3 staticman API / github app. Unfortunately I'm getting 500 errors back, which may be the config or may be the staticman api. \nThere's seems to be a bit of confusion around how _config.yml and staticman.yml are used (by the theme to generate the POST request and by the staticman API itself), and I think there's a PR needed around the docs for this at least.\nNot quite at the bottom of it yet but will do my best to feedback and put in a PR if I can.. As per cross referenced issue above, I'm up and running with staticman v3 comments.\nI think the bundled staticman.yml was the problem, so this may need changing, along with docs and perhaps a reworking of _config.yml and _includes/comments.html\nI think it would be pretty easy to add staticman_v3 to the comment provider list: basically unless people want to go to the trouble of setting up their own api to run the v2 backend this, after adding the gitlab app, pretty much has to become default anyway,as v2 is essentially 'broken'.\nA  few hours to catch up now!, but will work towards a PR when I can.\nComment from staticman issue included below for reference. Thanks for all the responses everybody \ud83d\udc4d \n\n@dancwilliams @unpreceden7ed and all.\nI am at peace.\nIn the chain of things this MUST boil down to the content of my staticman.yml (unless the test after reinstalling the app didn't reflect that change)\nI replaced with the standard sample: https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/edit/master/staticman.sample.yml \nchanging only the sitename.\nSo, thanks for this great advancement @eduardoboucas : 3 more confirmed happy customers for v3 within the last hour. Perhaps some clarification on docs & improved error messages needed?\nMy issues are all user support, so no follow up required thanks, but I will report this back to mmistakes/minimal-mistakes#2034 as referncved earlier which may need changes to the bundled staticman.yml. @VincentTam no probs: it made for a fun Saturday night and a few peoples' issues with the v3 api got fixed in the process :)\nI will close this issue now as it's chatter and my problem is resolved, but have created #2036 to follow up. . #1956 is related. see: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/2034#issuecomment-455852851. @mmistakes I just read your very detailed article on Staticman from a couple of years ago: https://mademistakes.com/articles/improving-jekyll-static-comments/\nCan you confirm whether nested comments is available in the minimal-mistakes theme (doesn't look like it)?\nIf not is it possible to point me to where it's done in one of your other themes, as per the article?\nThanks.. Thanks again for the quick response!\n\nOn Sun, Jan 20, 2019 at 5:49 PM Michael Rose notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nNested comments are not supported in any of my themes.\nHave a look on my personal site and repo to see how I\u2019ve done it.\nIf you\u2019re starting fresh it\u2019s much easier since you can use an internal\nStaticman field to assign a unique identifier for each comment as a way of\nreferencing their parent.

and Revamp!\"\ndate: 2019-02-21 17:49:39 -0600\ncomments: true\n---\nIt's been a long, long time since I did anything with this blog. I think it's time to bring it back!\n\nFirst and foremost, you'll notice a new look. I've moved away from using [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and am now just using straight [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). For now, I'm using the default theme, [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). I'll be keeping my eye out for a more full-featured theme in the future (specifically looking for one that handles tags). I'm open to suggestions!\n\nNow, what about content? Well, for the most part, the content will be the same: programming, software, etc. I've got a couple of new ideas and series' in the works, though, so stay tuned!\n\nI'm still getting used to the new site myself, so you might see it change in the near future as I poke, prod, and tweak it. Either way, it's good to be back, and I hope everyone enjoys the posts to come!\n\n\n\n_config.yml\n\n# Welcome to Jekyll!\n#\n# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values\n# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.

GitHub is not current. I'm working locally on a separate git branch specifically for testing and switching to this theme. Everything I'm doing right now is local. I added my config to my previous message. In it, you can see that I did comment out the minima theme and add the remote theme. Yet, it isn't working. Is there something else to check? . Great, thanks! Seems like I needed to add jekyll-remote-theme to my Gemfile. After doing that, I no longer have the layout warnings. Should adding that gem to the Gemfile be added to your installation instructions?. Ah, the instructions say to replace your Gemfile with just the source call and the github-pages gem. Doing that automatically pulls in the remote theme pluging. However, I still think the instructions are missing something. Step 2 is to add jekyll-include-cache to the plugins in _config.yml. However, that's not enough. gem \"jekyll-include-cache\" also needs to be added to the Gemfile and bundle update run to get it. Unless jekyll-include-cache is also supposed to automatically be puled down by github-pages, in which case it isn't.. Ok, cool. That all makes sense, and I've learned a ton. Thank you!. > As far as Staticman is concerned it can be optional\nRight. I've done this, but the field still exists on the page, of course.\n\nif you want to override the include\n\nIs there a way to do this if I'm using the theme as a remote theme on GitHub pages? Maybe it's as simple as just copying the template HTML file into a local file with the same path and editing that local copy?. Awesome! That\u2019s perfect then. Thanks!. ",

I renamed the folder _images in images and the include\n is now include: [ \"_pages\", \"images\" ]\nEDIT: solved. As you said, it was the path of the image that was wrong. Thanks a lot!!!. ",
    "user501254": "Okay, so there are no helper classes that can be used here. Does this seem like a good idea for a future release? In my opinion helper classes (like the existing classes: wide) can greatly simplify certain common customization like padding and font configuration without having the user to touch any CSS.. ",

That worked, however I'm trying to get the sidebar to show up on my 404 page now, but putting author: name or author_profile: true doesn't seem to be working?\nYou have this: \n\nHowever when I try to accomplish the same thing I get: \n\nWhat am I doing wrong now?.
