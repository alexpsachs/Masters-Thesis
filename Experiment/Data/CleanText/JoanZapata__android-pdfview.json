I released it so that anyone can browse a working code, and the only interesting part is here. BTW if you just want to change the pdf file for example, then just do mvn clean install android:deploy android:run to build it and put it on your device.\n. AA is really easy to set up, and if anyone can learn how to use it trying to use android-pdfview then it's good. :)\nIt's not possible to load a PDF file from the internet, but I just created an issue for that #20.\n. Please close this issue if that's ok.\n. I agree, EdgeEffect actually didn't exist when I coded this lib.\nI'll probably do it when I'll have more time, pull request is welcome. :-)\n. Thanks!\n. It seems the native library could not be loaded. Does it happen on the demo app?\n. It's VuDroid but the lib is supposed to be packed with the lib.\nDoes it happen on the demo app downloaded on the Play Store or do you build it yourself?\nThanks for the feedback.\n. You can't at the moment. But that would be an interesting feature. PR is welcome! :)\n. @emilsjolander Could you share your gradle build of the lib? To be honest I haven't tried gradle yet so that would be great!\n@vadimicus How do you use the lib? Is it with maven?\n. @vadimicus Maven is a build tool, if you don't know about you're not using it. That's fine, but I actually don't really know how Eclipse deal with this. Maybe you should try to copy libs/ in your own app. Please keep me updated if that works. :-)\n@emilsjolander No worry, thank you!\n. Hi,\nThank you for opening this issue.\nI'm sorry but that's VuDroid related, sometimes it fails to open PDF documents even if acrobat reader opens it. I'm closing this issue, but I invite you to submit it to VuDroid.\n. No there's not. The JAR was not needed at the time I wrote this lib. But it seems some IDEs requires it now.\nI added a JAR generation and released to maven central just now.\nVersion 1.0.2 should be available in a few hours, with the generated jar. Please close the issue if it works for you then. \nThanks for using pdfview :-)\n. Ok cool :-)\n. Hi,\nI'm not sure about this but, could you try to copy the libs/ folder in your own project, and see if it works?\n. To do a \"recycle all\", I would need to internally keep track of every PDFView staticly, which is very, very bad. You should probably use a listener and recycle old PDFViews when the page change.\nWhat is the problem with multiple PDFView simultaneously? Does it crash?\n. > You should probably use a listener and recycle old PDFViews when the page change.\nHave you tried that?\n. Hi, I don't think there is a particular problem with Android Studio, I developed the lib with IntelliJ.\nDo you use Maven? Have you tried copying the content of the libs/ folder into your own project?\n. > adding a lib should never be such a pain :(\nYep, totally agree, using the NDK doesn't make it really easy to use... I actually developed the lib for a project a long time ago and took very little time to extract it as an open source library. I made a sample project which should work fine, but I never got the time to test it more deeply and provide better integration instructions.\nDoes the sample work fine when you build it on your machine?\nAnyway, I'm sorry, I'll spend some time on integration instructions probably in a few months, but I have no time currently. I hope you'll succeed using it, good luck for your app. :-)\n. Indeed. Feel free to submit a PR, otherwise I'll try to work on it but I'm not sure how to do it yet.\n. I don't know if I should provide a gradle build to upload the AAR separately or if I should just embed the AAR into the package released with the maven release plugin. I need to spend some time on this, which I don't have yet.\n. I included your gradle build to the maven one, and included the generated AAR file to the package.\nVersion 1.0.2 has been released just now (available on central in a few hours), with the AAR file included.\nThank you again for your PR ;)\n. Hi, do you mean the pdf file hasn't been downloaded entirely yet?\n. Oh I see, I didn't understand that the exception was coming from an AsyncTask, preventing you from catching it.\nI guess the error should delegated to an error handler that you could implement yourself then.\nI don't have time for now but feel free to submit a pull request!\n. Nothing yet, you should be able to catch it using Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler() but it's bad. PR is welcome.\n. PR is still welcome.\n. > public relations?\nPull Request\n\nwhy don't you just catch the exception and create a callback interface for the developer to catch the error?\n\nBecause I don't have the time or the need to do so. This library is free and open source, everyone can participate and submit code to be integrated.\n. Thank you! I don't have time to check it right now but I'll do it ;)\n. Thanks but that's not consistent with onPageChange and onLoad.\n. Thank you, and sorry for the delay.\nYou include nineoldandroid but you don't actually use it anywhere.\nPlus, for pre-honeycomb versions you replace decodingAsyncTask.executeOnExecutor(AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR); with decodingAsyncTask.execute() which is not the same thing.\nI need further testing to make sure it doesn't break anything. But anyway nineoldandroid should not be there so I close this PR, feel free to make a new one without nineoldandroid.\n. Please install the Maven integration for eclipse and import the project as a Maven project.\n. This problem is due to the maven eclipse plugin missing a configurator for some newly introduced task in the android-maven-plugin.\nYou can tell m2e to ignore this task by adding this to your main pom \nxml\n <pluginManagement>\n     <plugins>\n      <plugin>\n       <groupId>org.eclipse.m2e</groupId>\n        <artifactId>lifecycle-mapping</artifactId>\n         <version>1.0.0</version>\n       <configuration>\n        <lifecycleMappingMetadata>\n          <pluginExecutions>\n           <pluginExecution>\n            <pluginExecutionFilter>\n              <groupId>com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2</groupId>\n             <artifactId>android-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n             <versionRange>[1.0.0,)</versionRange>\n              <goals>\n               <goal>consume-aar</goal>\n              </goals>\n             </pluginExecutionFilter>\n            <action>\n             <ignore />\n            </pluginExecution>\n           </action>\n           </pluginExecutions>\n          </lifecycleMappingMetadata>\n         </configuration>\n       </plugin>\n       . . .\n. Everything's fine, thank you very much for this! :-)\nStill need to find out how to build and include the aar file into the package released to maven central with maven. Once it's done, I'll make a new release with the AAR included.\n. Yeah I know that, I just don't know yet how to make the maven-release-plugin to produce this aar using the gradle build and include the aar into the release. I'll look at it tonight.\n. Yes, PDFView extends View so it provides the default setOnLongClickListener, and it's not overriden so it should work fine.\nNever tried it though. Let me know!\n. Looking at the code, PDFView's OnTouchListener is redefined, and probably intercepts all touch events. I guess it should call the OnLongClickListener manually then.\nSorry, I don't have time to do it myself, but if you find anything feel free to contribute!\n. I can't reproduce your issue. The slides are rendered normally no matter the orientation of the device:\n\n. Thanks, that would be nice. I don't remember anything like a \"rotate the pdf on some condition\" thing, so it looks like a weird bug. Just to be clear, your PDF file is looking good on portrait, right?\n. Ok, I can confirm the bug.\nUnfortunately I can't do anything about it, this is related to VuDroid which I'm relying on to decode the PDF, as you can see by downloading their app and try to open your file : it's displayed wrong too.\nYou should consider submitting them the issue directly here. \nI'm closing this issue.\n. I know... but what else could be done? I should probably rebuild pdfview on top of another pdf decoding library but I have absolutely no time for this... : /\n. Would be nice indeed, PR is welcome!\n. Thanks for reporting it.\nI haven't been using Eclipse for a long time now, not sure I can't help.\nCan you paste the exception here?\n. I tried opening your files and I got the black screens too. It's weird, I never encountered this case before. I noticed VuDroid has the same problem with your files.\nAndroid-pdfview is based on VuDroid, so unfortunately I can't do anything for you, you should submit this issue to their bugtracker instead.\n. Thank you for your contribution.\nHowever, there are a few problems:\n- Please check what you're committing: the AnimationManager is almost entirely recreated from your commit because you used tab instead of spaces to indent it.\n- Never change the version number of the projet in a feature commit. The version number is changed in a separate commit automatically using the maven release plugin.\nI can't merge this PR for these reasons, but feel free to resubmit a new one fixing these problems.\n. 1. The maven compilation fails.\n2. Why did you need java 7 with gradle? Plus, it's not consistent with maven anymore.\n3. You still have indentation problems in the gradle files.\n4. If you use 4 commits instead of one, you still have a commit that destroys completely the AnimationManager and recreates it, making it hard for anyone to trace when was each line modified the last time in the file, and making the git history unclear. What I would have wanted is you to merge your further commits into the first one, so that only the concerned lines are modified.\n5. But anyway, I tried the result of your work on my device, and I noticed the viewer has become extremely laggy, which is not acceptable.\nFor these reasons, I can't merge this PR.\nFeel free to submit a new one that fixes the aforementioned problems.\n. It's currently not possible, but a PR is welcome. :)\n. Done, will release when I got some time. Thanks @johan12345 \n. Will be done by tomorrow.\n. The pull request is actually very old so I don't think that counts as an urgent reply. :)\nAnyway the release is done, it should be available in a few hours from maven central.\nThanks again @johan12345 and sorry for the delay!\n. The same place you got the last one.\nYou can find everything on maven central.\n. Horizontal scrolling is still the default.\nUse .swipeVertical(true) to enable the vertical scrolling on 1.0.3.\n. @johan12345 ?\n. > It could be that the latter does not work when the view has already loaded the PDF file.\n(which is perfectly fine)\n. @undale #29 \n. That's good news, I'll test that and see if it can render pages as fast as I was able to do it using VuDroid.\n. I already know about concurrency issues but pdfview is supposed to take care of that using a worker thread to render all pdf pages. So you spotted a bug.\nUsing synchronized would slow down this thread so I would rather not use it, but instead understand why the component created 2 worker threads.\n. Are you using multiple PDFView or reusing one?\n. Unfortunately I rely on VuDroid so you should raise the issue on their side.\n. Hi, unfortunately my library is using VuDroid which uses MuPDF for rendering pdf pages. MuPDF is licensed with GPL3 so I'm forced to use the same. \nYou understood correctly, you must provide the source code of your app if you're using it, or see directly with the MuPDF team directly what they can do for you.\nJoan\n. This error comes from the underlying library so there's no way I can fix it. \nAn issue is currently opened to at least be able to catch those exceptions. See #29 \n. Duplicate of #67 \n. No, it's not possible.\n. Does it stay like this for a long time?\n. I'm glad you could solve your problem. It's weird that the default grid size was not big enough to cover the screen.. \n. Hi,\nUnfortunately this is not possible, the rendering library on which I rely can only transform PDF into images, and doesn't give me any hint on whether there's link in it or not.\n. VuDroid render the pages, PDFView only display them.\nIf you want a bitmap from the PDF, please use VuDroid, or MuPDF.\n. As I said, if you want to get each page as bitmaps, use VuDroid, not Pdfview.\n@ganeshhganu: The search functionality won't be implemented in Pdfview because I use VuDroid which uses mupdf which doesn't include this feature while parsing the pdf file. If you want to implement it, you should probably use another library.\n. The lib is based on VuDroid, which doesn't offer me the API to open password protected document. Please raise an issue on their side. If it is added to VuDroid, then I should be able to do something on my side, but I can't do anything in the meantime.\n. Can you show me some screenshot so I can see what king of degradation you are talking about please?\n. Thanks for the screenshot. Does that happen if you zoom in as well? \n. That's weird, I never encountered these kind of problems, and the lib was originally developed for tablets. \nCan you send me your pdf file so I can test it? (Does it happen for other pdf files as well?)\n. I developed the lib on galaxy tab 10.1, so it's really weird. I haven't tested since a long time though. I'll try to find some time to see what's wrong, but don't expect a fix anytime soon.\n. Nice, thanks for the tip! I'll try to get some time to test it and include it as a default. \n. Thanks, but maven is not a requirement.\n. Yeah sorry for that, it's just that I saw a PR with no explanation about the original problem and trying to put a huge title on the main page of the lib, with wrong information, it's a lot to put up with. :)\nWhat error do you get with maven < 3.1.1 ?\n. I think you misunderstand the error message. You have an error in your android project because you used android-maven-plugin:3.8.2 with maven<3.1.1. That's not at all related to pdf-view, you'd have the same issue without pdfview in your dependencies.\nPlus, I don't think it's a time saver to put the information in the lib's readme since it's very clearly documented in the error message itself.\nSo, sorry, I can't add this to the documentation. But thanks for your help. :)\n. No it doesn't, and won't, duplicate of #52.\n. Hi, sorry but there's currently no way to do it.\nYou should probably be able to do it starting with the current code and reversing some parts.\nFeel free to provide a pull request if you find a way to add this behavior as a configuration option.\n. Glad to hear it. :)\nFor those having the same issue, here's a link to @SuperHich repo\nhttps://github.com/SuperHich/A3malAl9ouloub\n@SuperHich: Using the github \"fork\" action makes it a lot easier to keep track of third party code change and send pull requests than copy/paste the whole project as new one in your account. Please consider it next time you copy/paste a lib. :)\n. Hi, PDFView is a view, so yes, you can configure your activity to be fullscreen and make it take the whole space.\n. Duplicate of #60\n. Hi, you can use fromFile instead of fromAsset.\n. No, it doesn't.\nIt's based on a library that doesn't support it either, so it can't be implemented.\n. Sorry I never heard of that kind of problem. Have you tried the VuDroid library?\nhttps://code.google.com/p/vudroid/\nIf you load your PDF in their app, do you see the same kind of problem? If you do, as PDFView relies on Vudroid for the rendering part, it would probably be better to raise an issue on their side.\n. > This framework turns the PDF into a bitmap, so what you're seeing, I believe, is the low resolution image that is pre-populated quickly into the view before the higher resolution image tiles can load. If you can edit your PDFs, there may be some work there you can do to make them less resource intensive, but otherwise, I think you're at the mercy of this library for rendering.\nExactly. And this lib is at the mercy of VuDroid which is at the mercy of MuPDF. Unfortunately there's not much I can do.\n. The easiest way is to set the left/right mask color to white. Unfortunately this is set in stone for now.\n. The library should create the appropriate file hierarchy here\nIn the meantime, please use this code before you call fromAsset(assetPath):\nFile outFile = new File(context.getCacheDir(), assetPath + \"-pdfview.pdf\");\noutFile.getParent().mkdirs();\n. Thanks @RoelRoel for your fix. @uscheller Feel free to submit a pull request, I'll gladly merge it !\n. It has to do with the underlying rendering library.\n. Hi, \nThe default mode is horizontal, starting from version 1.0.3 you can also swipe pages vertically.\nInteractive content will not be supported. \n. Sorry this is not supported by the underlying rendering library.\n. Nop, this is due to this value being too small. I guess it should automatically adapt to the screen size.\n. This is related to the underlying rendering library, VuDroid.\n. Nop, it's not possible, sorry for the delay.\n. You can find official releases on maven central. What you need is the .aar or .apklib file depending on your build system.\nThe library is 5 MB large.\n. Those are not supported by the underlying library (vudroid / mupdf) so pdfview won't handle it, sorry.\n. A PR is welcome.\n. It looks like this lib should be minSdkVersion=11.\n. Unfortunately this is related to the decoding library (Vudroid) and I can't do much about it. I don't think there's a workaround expect by changing the underlying library, so I'm closing this for now.\n. It has to do with the underlying library (vudroid / mupdf), and therefore cannot be fixed from pdfview. Feel free to open an issue on their tracker https://code.google.com/p/vudroid/.\n. See #90 \n. All the rendering is made using the vudroid library. If they don't provide it, neither does pdfview, sorry.\n. A pull request is welcome on that matter.\n. Try setting a white background on the PDFView view.\nThe only way to zoom is the pinch gesture.\n. The underlying rendering library doesn't support it, so PDFView can't support it.\n. Related to the underlying rendering library https://code.google.com/p/vudroid/\n. Sorry, this is related to the underlying rendering library.\n. I don't think you'll get PDFView to work that way. \nYour best shot would probably be to find some lib to convert your pdf into images and load them in ImageViews in your ViewPager.\n. Not using THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR causes some bugs, as you can see with #15 for example. So it would need a little extra work to make sure it's fully compatible with API 10. In the meanwhile I'll probably set the minSdkVersion to 11 as said here. Thanks anyway.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @uscheller !\n. Typeface can not be used to render the PDF. You can't change the typeface of your document using PDFView.\n. It's how it's supposed to be, as you can see in the main page.\n. Yep, I won't do it myself but a pull request is welcome.\n. Could be a util static method in PDFView. It would also be nice to know if the PDF is valid and compatible with this library at the same time. A pull request is welcome.\n. Thanks @matteinn, will be added in the next release!\n. By the end of the week.\n. It's done. 1.0.4 should be available in a few hours on Maven Central.\n. It might be related to #82, can you try using the latest version of PDFView from master?\n. Are you using maven or gradle ?\n. I just published the latest version 1.0.4 on maven central. You should be able to test it in a few hours by increasing the version you're using.\n. This error is related to the underlying library not being able to read the PDF file. There's not so much I can do, but an issue is opened to be able to catch this exception and warn the user in #29. I'm closing this one now.\n. Please use version 1.0.4.\n. Thanks @alexbeville, will be added in 1.0.5!\n. There is some code-style issues like missing whitespace in if...else statements (}else{ for example).\nCan you fix that before I can merge it please?\n. Yep, thank you!\n. A pull request is welcome.\n. Thanks @geocf \n. @ecstasy2 I think my comment on your PR is clear enough.

AA is really easy to set up, and if anyone can learn how to use it trying to use android-pdfview then it's good. :)\nIt's not possible to load a PDF file from the internet, but I just created an issue for that #20.\n. Please close this issue if that's ok.\n. I agree, EdgeEffect actually didn't exist when I coded this lib.\nI'll probably do it when I'll have more time, pull request is welcome. :-)\n. Thanks!\n. It seems the native library could not be loaded. Does it happen on the demo app?\n. It's VuDroid but the lib is supposed to be packed with the lib.\nDoes it happen on the demo app downloaded on the Play Store or do you build it yourself?\nThanks for the feedback.\n. You can't at the moment. But that would be an interesting feature. PR is welcome! :)\n. @emilsjolander Could you share your gradle build of the lib? To be honest I haven't tried gradle yet so that would be great!\n@vadimicus How do you use the lib? Is it with maven?\n. @vadimicus Maven is a build tool, if you don't know about you're not using it. That's fine, but I actually don't really know how Eclipse deal with this. Maybe you should try to copy libs/ in your own app. Please keep me updated if that works. :-)\n@emilsjolander No worry, thank you!\n. Hi,\nThank you for opening this issue.\nI'm sorry but that's VuDroid related, sometimes it fails to open PDF documents even if acrobat reader opens it. I'm closing this issue, but I invite you to submit it to VuDroid.\n. No there's not. The JAR was not needed at the time I wrote this lib. But it seems some IDEs requires it now.\nI added a JAR generation and released to maven central just now.\nVersion 1.0.2 should be available in a few hours, with the generated jar. Please close the issue if it works for you then. \nThanks for using pdfview :-)\n. Ok cool :-)\n. Hi,\nI'm not sure about this but, could you try to copy the libs/ folder in your own project, and see if it works?\n. To do a \"recycle all\", I would need to internally keep track of every PDFView staticly, which is very, very bad. You should probably use a listener and recycle old PDFViews when the page change.\nWhat is the problem with multiple PDFView simultaneously? Does it crash?\n. > You should probably use a listener and recycle old PDFViews when the page change.\nHave you tried that?\n. Hi, I don't think there is a particular problem with Android Studio, I developed the lib with IntelliJ.\nDo you use Maven? Have you tried copying the content of the libs/ folder into your own project?\n. > adding a lib should never be such a pain :(\nYep, totally agree, using the NDK doesn't make it really easy to use... I actually developed the lib for a project a long time ago and took very little time to extract it as an open source library. I made a sample project which should work fine, but I never got the time to test it more deeply and provide better integration instructions.\nDoes the sample work fine when you build it on your machine?\nAnyway, I'm sorry, I'll spend some time on integration instructions probably in a few months, but I have no time currently. I hope you'll succeed using it, good luck for your app. :-)\n. Indeed. Feel free to submit a PR, otherwise I'll try to work on it but I'm not sure how to do it yet.\n. I don't know if I should provide a gradle build to upload the AAR separately or if I should just embed the AAR into the package released with the maven release plugin. I need to spend some time on this, which I don't have yet.\n. I included your gradle build to the maven one, and included the generated AAR file to the package.\nVersion 1.0.2 has been released just now (available on central in a few hours), with the AAR file included.\nThank you again for your PR ;)\n. Hi, do you mean the pdf file hasn't been downloaded entirely yet?\n. Oh I see, I didn't understand that the exception was coming from an AsyncTask, preventing you from catching it.\nI guess the error should delegated to an error handler that you could implement yourself then.\nI don't have time for now but feel free to submit a pull request!\n. Nothing yet, you should be able to catch it using Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler() but it's bad. PR is welcome.\n. PR is still welcome.\n. > public relations?\nPull Request\n\nwhy don't you just catch the exception and create a callback interface for the developer to catch the error?\n\nBecause I don't have the time or the need to do so. This library is free and open source, everyone can participate and submit code to be integrated.\n. Thank you! I don't have time to check it right now but I'll do it ;)\n. Thanks but that's not consistent with onPageChange and onLoad.\n. Thank you, and sorry for the delay.\nYou include nineoldandroid but you don't actually use it anywhere.\nPlus, for pre-honeycomb versions you replace decodingAsyncTask.executeOnExecutor(AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR); with decodingAsyncTask.execute() which is not the same thing.\nI need further testing to make sure it doesn't break anything. But anyway nineoldandroid should not be there so I close this PR, feel free to make a new one without nineoldandroid.\n. Please install the Maven integration for eclipse and import the project as a Maven project.\n. This problem is due to the maven eclipse plugin missing a configurator for some newly introduced task in the android-maven-plugin.\nYou can tell m2e to ignore this task by adding this to your main pom \nxml\n <pluginManagement>\n     <plugins>\n      <plugin>\n       <groupId>org.eclipse.m2e</groupId>\n        <artifactId>lifecycle-mapping</artifactId>\n         <version>1.0.0</version>\n       <configuration>\n        <lifecycleMappingMetadata>\n          <pluginExecutions>\n           <pluginExecution>\n            <pluginExecutionFilter>\n              <groupId>com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2</groupId>\n             <artifactId>android-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n             <versionRange>[1.0.0,)</versionRange>\n              <goals>\n               <goal>consume-aar</goal>\n              </goals>\n             </pluginExecutionFilter>\n            <action>\n             <ignore />\n            </pluginExecution>\n           </action>\n           </pluginExecutions>\n          </lifecycleMappingMetadata>\n         </configuration>\n       </plugin>\n       . . .\n. Everything's fine, thank you very much for this! :-)\nStill need to find out how to build and include the aar file into the package released to maven central with maven. Once it's done, I'll make a new release with the AAR included.\n. Yeah I know that, I just don't know yet how to make the maven-release-plugin to produce this aar using the gradle build and include the aar into the release. I'll look at it tonight.\n. Yes, PDFView extends View so it provides the default setOnLongClickListener, and it's not overriden so it should work fine.\nNever tried it though. Let me know!\n. Looking at the code, PDFView's OnTouchListener is redefined, and probably intercepts all touch events. I guess it should call the OnLongClickListener manually then.\nSorry, I don't have time to do it myself, but if you find anything feel free to contribute!\n. I can't reproduce your issue. The slides are rendered normally no matter the orientation of the device:\n\n. Thanks, that would be nice. I don't remember anything like a \"rotate the pdf on some condition\" thing, so it looks like a weird bug. Just to be clear, your PDF file is looking good on portrait, right?\n. Ok, I can confirm the bug.\nUnfortunately I can't do anything about it, this is related to VuDroid which I'm relying on to decode the PDF, as you can see by downloading their app and try to open your file : it's displayed wrong too.\nYou should consider submitting them the issue directly here. \nI'm closing this issue.\n. I know... but what else could be done? I should probably rebuild pdfview on top of another pdf decoding library but I have absolutely no time for this... : /\n. Would be nice indeed, PR is welcome!\n. Thanks for reporting it.\nI haven't been using Eclipse for a long time now, not sure I can't help.\nCan you paste the exception here?\n. I tried opening your files and I got the black screens too. It's weird, I never encountered this case before. I noticed VuDroid has the same problem with your files.\nAndroid-pdfview is based on VuDroid, so unfortunately I can't do anything for you, you should submit this issue to their bugtracker instead.\n. Thank you for your contribution.\nHowever, there are a few problems:\n- Please check what you're committing: the AnimationManager is almost entirely recreated from your commit because you used tab instead of spaces to indent it.\n- Never change the version number of the projet in a feature commit. The version number is changed in a separate commit automatically using the maven release plugin.\nI can't merge this PR for these reasons, but feel free to resubmit a new one fixing these problems.\n. 1. The maven compilation fails.\n2. Why did you need java 7 with gradle? Plus, it's not consistent with maven anymore.\n3. You still have indentation problems in the gradle files.\n4. If you use 4 commits instead of one, you still have a commit that destroys completely the AnimationManager and recreates it, making it hard for anyone to trace when was each line modified the last time in the file, and making the git history unclear. What I would have wanted is you to merge your further commits into the first one, so that only the concerned lines are modified.\n5. But anyway, I tried the result of your work on my device, and I noticed the viewer has become extremely laggy, which is not acceptable.\nFor these reasons, I can't merge this PR.\nFeel free to submit a new one that fixes the aforementioned problems.\n. It's currently not possible, but a PR is welcome. :)\n. Done, will release when I got some time. Thanks @johan12345 \n. Will be done by tomorrow.\n. The pull request is actually very old so I don't think that counts as an urgent reply. :)\nAnyway the release is done, it should be available in a few hours from maven central.\nThanks again @johan12345 and sorry for the delay!\n. The same place you got the last one.\nYou can find everything on maven central.\n. Horizontal scrolling is still the default.\nUse .swipeVertical(true) to enable the vertical scrolling on 1.0.3.\n. @johan12345 ?\n. > It could be that the latter does not work when the view has already loaded the PDF file.\n(which is perfectly fine)\n. @undale #29 \n. That's good news, I'll test that and see if it can render pages as fast as I was able to do it using VuDroid.\n. I already know about concurrency issues but pdfview is supposed to take care of that using a worker thread to render all pdf pages. So you spotted a bug.\nUsing synchronized would slow down this thread so I would rather not use it, but instead understand why the component created 2 worker threads.\n. Are you using multiple PDFView or reusing one?\n. Unfortunately I rely on VuDroid so you should raise the issue on their side.\n. Hi, unfortunately my library is using VuDroid which uses MuPDF for rendering pdf pages. MuPDF is licensed with GPL3 so I'm forced to use the same. \nYou understood correctly, you must provide the source code of your app if you're using it, or see directly with the MuPDF team directly what they can do for you.\nJoan\n. This error comes from the underlying library so there's no way I can fix it. \nAn issue is currently opened to at least be able to catch those exceptions. See #29 \n. Duplicate of #67 \n. No, it's not possible.\n. Does it stay like this for a long time?\n. I'm glad you could solve your problem. It's weird that the default grid size was not big enough to cover the screen.. \n. Hi,\nUnfortunately this is not possible, the rendering library on which I rely can only transform PDF into images, and doesn't give me any hint on whether there's link in it or not.\n. VuDroid render the pages, PDFView only display them.\nIf you want a bitmap from the PDF, please use VuDroid, or MuPDF.\n. As I said, if you want to get each page as bitmaps, use VuDroid, not Pdfview.\n@ganeshhganu: The search functionality won't be implemented in Pdfview because I use VuDroid which uses mupdf which doesn't include this feature while parsing the pdf file. If you want to implement it, you should probably use another library.\n. The lib is based on VuDroid, which doesn't offer me the API to open password protected document. Please raise an issue on their side. If it is added to VuDroid, then I should be able to do something on my side, but I can't do anything in the meantime.\n. Can you show me some screenshot so I can see what king of degradation you are talking about please?\n. Thanks for the screenshot. Does that happen if you zoom in as well? \n. That's weird, I never encountered these kind of problems, and the lib was originally developed for tablets. \nCan you send me your pdf file so I can test it? (Does it happen for other pdf files as well?)\n. I developed the lib on galaxy tab 10.1, so it's really weird. I haven't tested since a long time though. I'll try to find some time to see what's wrong, but don't expect a fix anytime soon.\n. Nice, thanks for the tip! I'll try to get some time to test it and include it as a default. \n. Thanks, but maven is not a requirement.\n. Yeah sorry for that, it's just that I saw a PR with no explanation about the original problem and trying to put a huge title on the main page of the lib, with wrong information, it's a lot to put up with. :)\nWhat error do you get with maven < 3.1.1 ?\n. I think you misunderstand the error message. You have an error in your android project because you used android-maven-plugin:3.8.2 with maven<3.1.1. That's not at all related to pdf-view, you'd have the same issue without pdfview in your dependencies.\nPlus, I don't think it's a time saver to put the information in the lib's readme since it's very clearly documented in the error message itself.\nSo, sorry, I can't add this to the documentation. But thanks for your help. :)\n. No it doesn't, and won't, duplicate of #52.\n. Hi, sorry but there's currently no way to do it.\nYou should probably be able to do it starting with the current code and reversing some parts.\nFeel free to provide a pull request if you find a way to add this behavior as a configuration option.\n. Glad to hear it. :)\nFor those having the same issue, here's a link to @SuperHich repo\nhttps://github.com/SuperHich/A3malAl9ouloub\n@SuperHich: Using the github \"fork\" action makes it a lot easier to keep track of third party code change and send pull requests than copy/paste the whole project as new one in your account. Please consider it next time you copy/paste a lib. :)\n. Hi, PDFView is a view, so yes, you can configure your activity to be fullscreen and make it take the whole space.\n. Duplicate of #60\n. Hi, you can use fromFile instead of fromAsset.\n. No, it doesn't.\nIt's based on a library that doesn't support it either, so it can't be implemented.\n. Sorry I never heard of that kind of problem. Have you tried the VuDroid library?\nhttps://code.google.com/p/vudroid/\nIf you load your PDF in their app, do you see the same kind of problem? If you do, as PDFView relies on Vudroid for the rendering part, it would probably be better to raise an issue on their side.\n. > This framework turns the PDF into a bitmap, so what you're seeing, I believe, is the low resolution image that is pre-populated quickly into the view before the higher resolution image tiles can load. If you can edit your PDFs, there may be some work there you can do to make them less resource intensive, but otherwise, I think you're at the mercy of this library for rendering.\nExactly. And this lib is at the mercy of VuDroid which is at the mercy of MuPDF. Unfortunately there's not much I can do.\n. The easiest way is to set the left/right mask color to white. Unfortunately this is set in stone for now.\n. The library should create the appropriate file hierarchy here\nIn the meantime, please use this code before you call fromAsset(assetPath):\nFile outFile = new File(context.getCacheDir(), assetPath + \"-pdfview.pdf\");\noutFile.getParent().mkdirs();\n. Thanks @RoelRoel for your fix. @uscheller Feel free to submit a pull request, I'll gladly merge it !\n. It has to do with the underlying rendering library.\n. Hi, \nThe default mode is horizontal, starting from version 1.0.3 you can also swipe pages vertically.\nInteractive content will not be supported. \n. Sorry this is not supported by the underlying rendering library.\n. Nop, this is due to this value being too small. I guess it should automatically adapt to the screen size.\n. This is related to the underlying rendering library, VuDroid.\n. Nop, it's not possible, sorry for the delay.\n. You can find official releases on maven central. What you need is the .aar or .apklib file depending on your build system.\nThe library is 5 MB large.\n. Those are not supported by the underlying library (vudroid / mupdf) so pdfview won't handle it, sorry.\n. A PR is welcome.\n. It looks like this lib should be minSdkVersion=11.\n. Unfortunately this is related to the decoding library (Vudroid) and I can't do much about it. I don't think there's a workaround expect by changing the underlying library, so I'm closing this for now.\n. It has to do with the underlying library (vudroid / mupdf), and therefore cannot be fixed from pdfview. Feel free to open an issue on their tracker https://code.google.com/p/vudroid/.\n. See #90 \n. All the rendering is made using the vudroid library. If they don't provide it, neither does pdfview, sorry.\n. A pull request is welcome on that matter.\n. Try setting a white background on the PDFView view.\nThe only way to zoom is the pinch gesture.\n. The underlying rendering library doesn't support it, so PDFView can't support it.\n. Related to the underlying rendering library https://code.google.com/p/vudroid/\n. Sorry, this is related to the underlying rendering library.\n. I don't think you'll get PDFView to work that way. \nYour best shot would probably be to find some lib to convert your pdf into images and load them in ImageViews in your ViewPager.\n. Not using THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR causes some bugs, as you can see with #15 for example. So it would need a little extra work to make sure it's fully compatible with API 10. In the meanwhile I'll probably set the minSdkVersion to 11 as said here. Thanks anyway.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @uscheller !\n. Typeface can not be used to render the PDF. You can't change the typeface of your document using PDFView.\n. It's how it's supposed to be, as you can see in the main page.\n. Yep, I won't do it myself but a pull request is welcome.\n. Could be a util static method in PDFView. It would also be nice to know if the PDF is valid and compatible with this library at the same time. A pull request is welcome.\n. Thanks @matteinn, will be added in the next release!\n. By the end of the week.\n. It's done. 1.0.4 should be available in a few hours on Maven Central.\n. It might be related to #82, can you try using the latest version of PDFView from master?\n. Are you using maven or gradle ?\n. I just published the latest version 1.0.4 on maven central. You should be able to test it in a few hours by increasing the version you're using.\n. This error is related to the underlying library not being able to read the PDF file. There's not so much I can do, but an issue is opened to be able to catch this exception and warn the user in #29. I'm closing this one now.\n. Please use version 1.0.4.\n. Thanks @alexbeville, will be added in 1.0.5!\n. There is some code-style issues like missing whitespace in if...else statements (}else{ for example).\nCan you fix that before I can merge it please?\n. Yep, thank you!\n. A pull request is welcome.\n. Thanks @geocf \n. ",
