In other words I don't want to ban sites using 1.8 or below. \nBTW, the patch includes good refactoring. Do you mind if I ask you to update the patch as I'll mention later? to support 1.8 or below? Thanks\n. Are these codes worth optimizing? It seems too complicated to me. Do you have any idea about the trade off among code size, speed and complexity? If it is hard to explain in English, feel free to use \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e :)\n. I have to decide supported jQuery versions. IMO supporting jQuery (>=1.7.0) makes sense because the Backbone also supports the same versions. Any idea? Thanks.\n. Summary of the above comment:\n- When we calculate the multiple CSS properties of an element using jQuery.fn.css, the efficiency of the method between ver. < 1.8 and >= 1.8 are quite different.\n  - Both of them invokes the getComputedStyle native function to get the final used values of all the CSS properties of an element.\n  - In ver. >= 1.8, the jQuery method can be executed with the array of properties. Then the native function will be invoked once.\n  - In ver. < 1.8, we have to execute the jQuery method many times. It means that the native function will also be invoked same times.\n  - Function invocation is really heavy in JavaScript.\n- Because jQuery.fn.on is being used and it is supported by jQuery >= 1.7, supporting 1.7 or later makes sense.\n  - I have already found that the current code can work with jQuery 1.7.2.\n\nI got it.

I think textcomplete will be attached to the initially initialized editor instance, but not attached to instances initialized later. Isn't it? (I'm not familiar with the API of CKEditor). @ThomasVandenbon OK, I'll merge this patch and release the next version soon. @ThomasVandenbon jquery-textcomplete@1.8.1 is out \ud83d\ude04 . jquery-textcomplete@1.8.2 was released. Close in favor of 6186768661e6373fcf7e3d1eb4bc4897bef2cb3e. v1.8.4 was released with this patch. @mvlabat v1.8.3 was released .

Thanks for your contribution \ud83d\ude04 \n. Hi @jmlavoier, thanks for sending the patch\nPlease make sure that the pull-request includes only the commit you made for fixing the issue :)\n. @klaslundberg thanks for sending the patch.\nAdding option.rightEdgeOffset option looks good to me \ud83d\udc4d \nCould you reset dist directory? I'll build dist files when I release the next release.\n. LGTM :octocat: thanks for contribution\n. Thanks.\n. \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udc9a \ud83d\udc99 \ud83d\udc9b \ud83d\udc9c \n. Why you need this?. I think textcomplete will be attached to the initially initialized editor instance, but not attached to instances initialized later. Isn't it? (I'm not familiar with the API of CKEditor). @ThomasVandenbon OK, I'll merge this patch and release the next version soon. @ThomasVandenbon jquery-textcomplete@1.8.1 is out \ud83d\ude04 . jquery-textcomplete@1.8.2 was released. Close in favor of 6186768661e6373fcf7e3d1eb4bc4897bef2cb3e. v1.8.4 was released with this patch. @mvlabat v1.8.3 was released . ",
