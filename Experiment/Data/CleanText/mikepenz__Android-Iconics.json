    "mikepenz": "Is now possible as following:\ntextView_1.setText(\"{faw-clock-o} 5 min ago\");\nnew Iconics.IconicsBuilder().ctx(this).on(textView_1).build();\n. @coxande you can style the icon with any CharacterStyle available in Android. I'm not sure if there is a letter spacing option. Perhaps you can just solve this issue with normal spaces.\nIf those don't fit it's perhaps possible to hack a solution with something like the answer in this article:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5133548/how-to-change-letter-spacing-in-a-textview\n. @coxande with some more research. It seems that the only solution is setting a nonBreakingSpace -> \\u00A0 \nI've added a dummy implementation for adding kerning to the Iconics class. With some more work it should be possible to implement a custom margin before and after each image. This would be a pretty \"hacky\" solution. \nI hope someone else comes up with a better idea. Perhaps also for the text center problem. right now the text will always be on the bottom, and not centered within the whole line\n. seems to be not possible with normal spans. \n. Not working with normal character styles\nIs somehow possible if you set the icon as Bitmap via the ImageSpan\nThere's will be a sample how to do this in the next version 0.6.6\n. Haven't tested. The sample application won't work. But i think i'm able to lower the libraries minSdkVersion to at least 14. \nJust as a note:\nIf i would have to remove functionality i won't downgrade to minSdkVersion 10. In my opinion 14+ is a pretty ok already these days. \n. @AndreiD ok to be honest i didn't check :D. \nAs mentioned above, if no call for 14+ is required i will lower to 10 ;) \n. @AndreiD so lowered the minSdkVersion to 10 ;) lint does not throw an error so i assume it will work ;)\nPushed to maven as 0.5.1 should be synced within the next hour or something like this\n. seems to be not possible with normal spans\n. If you use a IconicsDrawable you won't have to do the folllwoing:\nnew Iconics.IconicsBuilder().ctx(context).on(textView_main_updated).build();\nThe IconicsDrawable is a standalone drawable containing the icon. \nPerhaps you got some issues with the CompoundDrawables. I can't check right now.\n. @AndreiD you have to set the bounds on your own? Ok didn't know that too :D \nThanks for the info. \n. @coxande awesome. will try it :) If it works i will create a helper for this :)\n. @coxande thanks for the code snippet. it's now part of version 0.6.0\nPlease read upgrade note before updating to the newest verision\n. Fixed in commit https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/9a54ff1bca53c82202ff0d519c6b4e9ad364b0e5 and https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/5f2a0a7548c2173e9a96a04017c40854b7eea11b\n. @somghosh as far as i know the editor can only show static data. So let's say it would be possible to set a preview text. The icons are generated during runtime so there is nothing to show. \nI can't try it right now, but if you mean that the editor can't show the layout at whole or displays an exception it is possible to fix, have to check.\n. @somghosh fixed in v0.7.1\n. @somghosh v0.7.1 is already on maven central. Just change it to this:\njavascript\n    compile 'com.mikepenz.iconics:library:0.7.1@aar'\nThank you so much. I try my best to help others :). \nIf you create an application, and need an about this app section + proper credits (an open source section in your app to show which libs you use and which licenses they have) you probably will like this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries\n. @somghosh thanks for the info. \n. @somghosh no version 1.0.0 of this library. the second part is nothing for you to do. just make sure you read the upgrade notes...\n. @sherpya thanks\n@thomasdsouza thanks\n. is fixed in version 0.7.2 -> just pushed it to maven central\n. Thanks. \n. Ok this is not required if you look at the way how drawables work. You can just create a new drawable over and over again. The old reference will be automatically removed. \nIn fact it's even better to recreate a new drawable each time if you want to avoid memory leaks. \nhttp://www.curious-creature.com/2008/12/18/avoid-memory-leaks-on-android/comment-page-1/\n. Thank you. Totally missed them here.\n. @paolomcgrath oh sorry. yeah will publish it later today. \n. @gpulido with the newest version you don't have to register the GoogleMaterial font anymore because it is included as default. See the README ;)\nAnd why it won't show the icon :D you have to write {gmd-android}\n. @gpulido just tried this within an textview with the newest version. i can use {gmd-skip-next} within a textview without problems\n. @csaq7151 is this the sample application without any modifications?\n. what phone do you use? you also use Android Studio?\n. I assume it's a problem with eclipse.\nI give you the advice to switch to the Android Studio.\nFor eclipse i can't really help you\nOn Wed, Mar 25, 2015 at 2:46 PM, Emme notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI use Nexus 4 and Nexus 5. I use eclipse.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/18#issuecomment-86032480\n.\n. You mean as class to your project? I am sure there must be an issue with the eclipse setup. Here it's working on all devices and emulators.\n\nBut great that you found a workaround for you\n. @h6ah4i thanks\n. @h6ah4i the new addon is now published on maven central :)\nthanks again!\n. @cgudea just use the method .colorRes \nthere is a separat method for this because the color itself is an int and the ressource identifier is an int. i won't be able to get the difference of both :P\nBut in fact your \"workaround\" basically does the same\n. @kosiara you can add to ignore the unknown prefixes\n. @kosiara what is the error message you get from the layout editor? i never use it :D i create my layouts in my head :P\n. @sherpya not sure. He's talking about the preview. \n. @sherpya inside fragment tags. but as far as i can say @arcao has no <fragment>\n. Moved views to new package\n. @alorma awesome ;) Thanks.\n. @alorma the only way to update a font is use the js included and update the mapping entries, and updating the file. as far as i know there's no way to get the (string - utf8 char) mapping from the ttf.\ni use the css provided by those and map it then to the classes. \n. ah i see. if the icons itself don't change (so the same names but new images) you can update the font. if you talk about a predefined iconfont you have to recompile yes.\nbut if you talk about a custom font for one of your projects. you can just add a new custom \"font\" to your project. as shown in the sample activity. just use the font class inside your app then. \n. @alorma yeah not sure if it makes sense because the provided addons should be updated with new release. and custom fonts which are created by your designers are a module or a simple class in your project\n. @alorma yeah it would be possible to split it up. but if you don't require these information just keep them empty. probably i'll split them up\n. @alorma ok i think in fact you can keep those fields with an empty String. \n. @SanderTuit i assume the spanables which are create by the Html.fromHtml method are overwritten by Android-Iconics. Not sure if it's that easy to keep both. \nIs it an required function for you?\n. There is something different which allows you to color icons inside a textView :D \nLook at the playground activity.\nHtml.fromHtml is not planned :D\n. Here's a snippet how you can style elements of an TextView with spanables :D \njava\n//Show how to style the text of an existing TextView\n        TextView tv1 = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.test1);\n        new Iconics.IconicsBuilder().ctx(this)\n                .style(new ForegroundColorSpan(Color.WHITE), new BackgroundColorSpan(Color.BLACK), new RelativeSizeSpan(2f))\n                .styleFor(\"faw-adjust\", new BackgroundColorSpan(Color.RED), new ForegroundColorSpan(Color.parseColor(\"#33000000\")), new RelativeSizeSpan(2f))\n                .on(tv1)\n                .build();\n. @Anatidae-Project there is no npm module but a js file which can be used with node to convert ttf & css to the entries for an Android-Iconics addon\n. yes :D this can be executed with node and will output a list with the mapping. it's not yet perfect, but already a good start\n. @somghosh it works but only on api level 21+. i have not found a solution for pre lollipop devices yet\n. @magicgoose you are right. I will change this in the next release\n. isn't this working for you:\njava\n//Show how to style the text of an existing TextView\n        TextView tv1 = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.test1);\n        new Iconics.IconicsBuilder().ctx(this)\n                .style(new ForegroundColorSpan(Color.WHITE), new BackgroundColorSpan(Color.BLACK), new RelativeSizeSpan(2f))\n                .styleFor(\"faw-adjust\", new BackgroundColorSpan(Color.RED), new ForegroundColorSpan(Color.parseColor(\"#33000000\")), new RelativeSizeSpan(2f))\n                .on(tv1)\n                .build();\n?\n. @magicgoose ah ok i see. So perhaps this method should be modified to support pre formatted stuff. \n. @mutindaz if you need to overlap to icons i would recommend you to create a RelativeLayout with two ImageViews inside it where one ImageView overlaps the other.\n. @mutindaz a different solution could be this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2740198/325479\n. @carmelo-ruota just tried on my Nexus 5. The sample activity shows the icon for the IconicsButton. Not if you try to style it via code.\nAny additional information?\n. @carmelo-ruota first please update to the latest version. and then make sure you don't do different things with this button between fragment and activity\n. Do you use any font modifying library?\n. @carmelo-ruota i assume this one overwrites the typeface for the view. try to disable it, to check my assumption. \n. @alorma good idea :P is in the next version. \n. @fmorel90 just as info. you don't have to add the Android-Iconics to your project. The MaterialDrawer already comes with it. It's also the same version. \nIt disappears?\nCan it be that it get's overlapped by a different view?\n. @fmorel90 yeah :D\nit'S really strange. can you share the code. perhaps i can reproduce it. \n. @fmorel90 the project would be gerat. you can remove all your project specific stuff. just to be able to reproduce this issue.\n. if it is still the case please just write here again\n. @meetshawn thank you so much. I'll test it with the sample ;)\n. There are methods to set the size of the drawable:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L343\nAnd also to define a padding for it:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L284\n. @str4d oh yes i totally missed the fact that you were talking about the view :D\n. @amatkivskiy thanks. Missed this with the update of the Google Material Design Icons. They changed some names.\n. @amatkivskiy the icon was renamed: https://www.google.com/design/icons/#ic_favorite_border\n. @amatkivskiy you mean creating an addon for this library. The process is very easy. Just look at the source code. There are different add-on modules. In fact it is enough if you copy one of them, change the details and information to the new font, then you can use the js or the phyton script to generate the mapping :D. \nOk it could be easier xD\n. There is already a section about this in the readme: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#contribute\n. I have added a new improved section here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#create-custom-fonts-using-fontello-or-icomoon\n. @Anatidae-Project can you also provide the CustomFont class you have created?\n. @Anatidae-Project it is only possible to have an getMappingPrefix with the length of 3 :D sorry it is not stated. \n. @alorma why is it necessary to support min css files? you can still format it ;). also normally there is always a non minified version available too :D\n. @seba123neo i assume this happenes because the appcompat lib will style all default buttons but not buttons with a different package name. i think you will have to extend the AppCompatButton to have the same behavior\nI can't do this. as this lib does not depend on the appcompat lib ;) (yet)\n. @seba123neo i try to reproduce it. but i think there are other problems which cause this. a simple fix would be that you just create an ImageButton here, and set the icon as Drawable\n. @seba123neo do you use the IconicsButton here? this one should work :/. it's working on my device. at least. Perhaps it gets replaced by the AppCompatButton? can you try to extend this one and add it into your project?\n. You have to add\nxml\nandroid:textAllCaps=\"false\"\nto your button\n. @aacanakin can you try it for a normal button? i assume there has to be different issue as the IconicsButton does not change any of this functions. It just extends the default Button.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsButton.java\n. seems correct if you look at the sample app:\n<com.mikepenz.iconics.view.IconicsImageView\n                    android:layout_width=\"72dp\"\n                    android:layout_height=\"72dp\"\n                    app:iiv_color=\"@android:color/holo_red_dark\"\n                    app:iiv_icon=\"gmd-favorite\" />\n. @bmutinda the app crashes. what'S the output?\n. @bmutinda ok good\n. @bmutinda i think you should update to v1.2.0 the com.mikepenz.iconics.view.IconicsImageView was renamed in a newer version. v0.7.9 still has a different path for the view\n. @seba123neo please add a screenshot.\nhave you set the correct dp size for the icon? if you use the IconicsButton directly then the icon is the size of the text. if you want a different size or as compounddrawable you will have to create the icon programmatically\n. how do you define the icon for the IconicsButton?\n. @seba123neo i will look at it. thanks for the details\n. @seba123neo if you use the IconicsButton as shown above you will have to set the TextSize for it. Because the icon is set as text. If you really want to have a different behavior you should go with an ImageButton and set the IconicsDrawable via code\n. @seba123neo make sure to set it as dp as \"sp\" will scale depending on the users font size setting on the device\n. @seba123neo correct\n. @xsorifc28 vertical centering within the text is not possible, as the icon interacts as a normal text within this sample. If you want it in front of the text you should go with a CompoundDrawable and set it via code. \n. The size with the newest lib is 24dp for the icon and 6dp padding. \njava\n    public static final int ANDROID_ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_DP = 24;\n    public static final int ANDROID_ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_PADDING_DP = 6;\njava\npublic IconicsDrawable actionBar() {\n        sizeDp(ANDROID_ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_DP + (2 * ANDROID_ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_PADDING_DP));\n        paddingDp(ANDROID_ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_PADDING_DP);\n        return this;\n}\n. As of this screenshot in the Material Design Guidelines the Icon should be the size of 24dp\n- 56dp actionBarSize\n- 16dp padding\n  \nSo it should be fine. if a specific icon needs more padding you can define the size manually\n. @leelei have you tested on Android M?\n. @rf3Studios i have modified this behavior on the latest version. the icon is now 24dp with 1dp padding\n. @novalu the actionBar method is correct as far as possible for the lib. The thing is that google does not use the same paddings for all of their icons, and i see no programmatically solution to automatically define the different paddings. \nThe actionBar method sets the size to 24dp with 1dp padding by default. In some cases this will be different as you found out already\n. @mynavy the given icon does not exist. \nGoogleMaterial was updated and they changed some names. it is now called: gmd_favorite_border\n. @h6ah4i thanks. i'll check this later today\n. @h6ah4i thanks. i'll check this later today\n. @khalid-hussain you are searching for this one: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/google_material_typeface_library/GoogleMaterial.java#L371\nthe legend can be probably added to the wiki, but is not required as the names are also shown on the sites of those fonts https://www.google.com/design/icons/#ic_favorite_border\n. @khalid-hussain not sure. first you showed a screenshot from a broken icon. now there are two different icons. i assume you have different layouts for different screen resolutions or different orientations and you just missed to modify it in one of those\n. @khalid-hussain because it does not exist. i showed you that it is named \"gmd-favorite-border\" in the first answer. \ni will fix it in the readme\n. as mentioned in this comment https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/52#issuecomment-124446641 i only see that you use two different icons? i don't see an icon not working\n. @khalid-hussain read my comment again pls: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/52#issuecomment-124447494\nthe +1 symbol is a different icon. i think you mix up different layouts\n. it has to be something project specific because it displays the share icon. and in the special case of the tablet it shows a different icon. The iconics library does not change to a different icon if you use a different android version or screen resolution. never had any such problem in all of my projects which run on many thousands of devices. \n. @khalid-hussain ok great :). i really can't reproduce this anywhere. so perhaps you should search for occurencies of the +1 drawable\n. @h6ah4i thanks\n. @h6ah4i thanks. i think you can keep the version of the addon in sync with the font version. So not changing it to v1.1.0 but to v1.1.70\n. i think 117 should be fine ;)\n. @h6ah4i once again. thank you so much! :)\n. you can have such a background by setting a rounded corner for the background roundedCornersRxDp\n. @anticafe those are not the original material icons by google. Those are in as default. But you can have the Material Design Community icons via the addon which is available https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#available-fonts (an update to those was merged a few moments ago. will publish it soon)\n. @rothschild86 i can't give support for eclipse as it is officially not supported anymore. i assume it just parses or handles the font file wrong\n. How do you create the iconicsDrawable in the upper sample? Have you tried creating the drawable via code? will it work then? what's your android version?\n. @rothschild86 seems like eclipse messes something up. never had such an issue when creating the icon via code. \nwhy can't you switch to the official supported android dev environment?\n. ok great you found a solution ;)\n. @pepperonas looks nice ;). will take a closer look (hopefully) this evening\n. @pepperonas thanks pull request merged. updated sample app is pushed to the play store. and also added to the latest release here @github\n. I think it is because you do not register the Google material nor the fontawesome font. This is required now if you try to use a specific font addon via string or xml\n. Totally missed to add it as upgrade notes. Just mentioned it down in the how to use section \n. @wKovacs64 will add it as upgrade notes ;). I have not yet found a solution that existing fonts register them on their own. do you have an idea how i could solve this?\n. @wKovacs64 the main difference in the new version is that i had split up the fonts and the core. so the core is only the classes without any font included (this was previously done because so the 2 fonts were automatically in), this now allows you to save on app size by creating your own icon font with just the icons you need. (i have done this for the MaterialDrawer v4.0.0 now ;). A MaterialDrawerFont with just 3 icons -> size 5kb ;) )\n. README updated with upgrade notes ;)\n. @wKovacs64 the registering happens in the Iconics class which is now part of the core. Prior v1.5.x the Iconics included the GoogleMaterial, FontAwesome fonts in it's constructor. So they were added automatically, and you only had to register additional fonts. \nThe registering is only required if you try to use the fonts via xml or programmatically via string (when you want to create the icon via the string name). I somehow have to find out the font class by the 3 char identifier --> \"gmd\" --> via the Iconics font map --> GoogleMaterial.class\nI have not found yet that a class is automatically instantiated and it will register itself. (as far as i've found this is not possible), then i tried to have it via pre processor annotations, but this was not possible as this works only when i have only one module. \nI do not want compile time annotations as those will lower the performance. \nPerhaps i can go a similar approach as with the AboutLibraries, to define the fonts via xml in the resources, and i will then just try to instantiate the class via reflection and add it to the map of registered fonts. should be possible, but i would have hopped for a better solution for this problem :/\n. @wKovacs64 great ;)\n. @aacanakin great that you solved it in the meantime. This is stated in the Upgrade notes in the README :). This is now required as i split up the project into the core and the main package. I will probably try to find a solution to don't require this but at the moment you have to do this\n. @logcat not sure what you mean, but you can't create a IconicsImageView without an icon in first place. If you define the color and the icon (as required) you can just get the icon from the IconicsImageView and alter it at a later time\n. @logcat ok just checked the source code. it should use the set color. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsImageView.java#L84\n. @logcat it is probably possible to use it on API 9, but this version is only used by a tiny number of people: https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\nAs an additional note, i do not like to release it for an API version i can't test on a real device, nor i will on an emulator. \nIf you need it for 9 you can include the source in your app. \n. @logcat that's true. thanks for this info ;)\n. @mychaelgo make sure your gradle is not in offline mode. It is available on MavenCentral: http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.mikepenz%7Ciconics%7C1.6.2%7Caar\n. @seba123neo you can provide a padding to the drawables if you like. or have a custom width. This could help here. seems strange that it adds it riectly to the right edge\n. Please answer again if it is still a problem\n. will it also happen with a normal drawable?\n. So it's no Android-Iconics problem. sorry\n. thanks for adding the answer ;)\n. @medyo awesome! thanks ;)\n. Hi. \nThe problem is that you have a version conflict with the Android-Iconics included in the Materialdrawer and the latest available version of Android-Iconics. \nWith v4.0.0 of the MaterialDrawer i will include the latest version of Android-Iconics. Until you update you have to go with the older version of Android-Iconics. or you exclude the Android-Iconics dependency from the MaterialDrawer.\nA version which is compatible is this one: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/tree/88e9d0279f4248cbe20016b72763198c35ab4bae\n. @gpulido please update to the latest RC12 of the MaterialDrawer then you can just add the dependencies for the fonts you want. those are not included by default anymore to save apk size for people who don't use them.\nHere are all default fonts you can include:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#2-choose-your-desired-fonts\nMaterialDrawer v4.0.0 rc12 contains the iconics-core v1.7.1\n. @gpulido ah ok you mean it is working, but it just shows the warnging\n. @gpulido with proguard deactivated it's also not working?\n. @gpulido thanks for the info. strange. registering should not be required. (i also don't do this in the sample app) \nWhat's the first spot you try to use the icon?\n. @wKovacs64 looks awesome. is it working like this for you? As discussed a few weeks ago i use proguard very carefully so my setup isn't the best to test this\n. ok great. i will merge and release a new version ;). so it's in \nI will take a look at those warnings. added a log output for them. as i thought it might help to find wrong icons. \n. @anysome the custom font must have a 3 char prefix. please modify it. afterwards it should work\n. @clement9527 why don't you use an IconicsImageView instead? (just a suggestion as it seems that you just need the icon here)\nI see your point, but the name is really with _ as java does not like - in variable names, and it would confuse devs if it would return something different than the enum var name\n. @h6ah4i really interesting. I already added this here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/Iconics.java#L339\nBut it seems it is not working in all cases. Thanks i'll add this to the main IconicsButton\n. @clement9527 someone else already had a similar issue, the only solution was to manually register the font. i have not yet found the solution why this happens. do you have any special packagename declaration in your build.gradle?\n. @mychaelgo as stated in the output you have Iconics twice on your buildpath. \nThe MaterialDrawer contains the Android-Iconics library as dependency. \nSo you have two possible solutions:\n- Update the MaterialDrawer to v4.0.0 which includes the latest Android-Iconics core\n- Exclude Android-Iconics as dependency from the MaterialDrawer\n. gradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:3.1.2@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n    exclude group: 'com.mikepenz'\n}\nthis should do the job\n. @rafalenden what's the font dependency you add? Or do you want to display the text?\n. @rafalenden just tried the same in the sample app. empty activity with only the view you posted above. And it showed up. \nCan you create a simple demo app which would show that bug?\n. @waninkoko also with the latest version?\n. @waninkoko if you manually register the fonts? \nWhich version of the font addons are you using?\n. @waninkoko interesting the font contains the proguard rules: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/fontawesome-typeface-library/build.gradle#L10\n. @waninkoko can you please try manual registration of the font?\n. @waninkoko do you have a special package name setup for your application? The R has normally the packagename of the application but if you modify this in your gradle it can be somewhere else. so it won't be able to find the R\n. @waninkoko so Class.forName(YOURPACKAGENAME + \".R$string\") should return the class instead of null\n. @waninkoko can you create a small sample app which would allow me to debug this bug? (or a copy of your app with everything removed but the Iconics bug :D)\n. @waninkoko strange. :/ in the correct package including no double dot or anyhting? case senstive?\n. @waninkoko yeah i'm confused too. And i don't think MultiDex is the issue because it is working with a different app of mine containing MultiDex\n. @waninkoko yeah really strange. can you send me a sample app perhaps i can reproduce and (fix?) the issue :D\n. @waninkoko ok great. not sure if i will be still online. it's already 07:48pm here :D\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/README.md#proguard\n. Thanks @waninkoko for coming up with the solution and for helping to debug this issue\n. @SeunMatt it is known that they don't show the icon in design mode, and it is not intended to be fixed as it is working in the app. \nIf you have a solution for this feel free to open a Pull request with the required code changes\n. @simonesessa yeah the library cna't modify the functionality of the original TextView. You would have to overwrite the behavior of the RadioButton to get the same as the IconicsTextview does. Or you use Iconics programmatically and let it create the spannable for you\nthe other exception you show is because you can\u00c4T have to different verions of Iconics on the classpath. You can exclude iconics from the MaterialDrawer or you update the MaterialDrawer\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/73\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:3.1.2@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n    exclude group: 'com.mikepenz', module: 'iconics'\n}\n. @jansallads i use it with API 10. Which method is used which is not compatible?\n. @jansallads i do not have any issues with the Android-Iconics in API 10 (and i use it in many apps with a lot of installs) \nIf you show me the exact spot of the warning i will probably be able why it's there. But you can safely use it with API 10. \n. @besharati-behzad which exception? i can't really tell without any detailed report what's going on. \n. @besharati-behzad your stacktrace does not contain a single line specific to the Android-Iconics. What's your layout you try to inflate? Are you sure it's a Android-Iconics issue\n. @besharati-behzad you use the latest version of the library?\nIt may could be caused by the fragment. will have to debug it at home\n. Yes. i saw it in the stacktrace. it works without the IconicsLayoutInflater right? so i think it may miss the namespace to instantiate the layouts from. will check at home \n. @besharati-behzad the IconicsLayoutInflater is not causing the issue. Seems like the AppCompatDelegate may cause some troubles. (But then it would be a support lib issue)\n. @Saime1942 \nIt depends on how you plan to use the library. If you only use the Android-Iconics as Drawable there is no need to register any fonts or anything as this happens automatically. \nThe registering (which is done via the R variable) only is required if you generate icons from the string name, or if you use them directly via xml. \nBut no problem as you can just ignore the autodetection. obfuscate your R.java as you would to and register those fonts programmatically as shown with the CustomFont in the sample application https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17 \nYou can do this with the add-on fonts too in the same style. \n. @Saime1942 i do not know if you can overwrite proguard rules. if not, i assume this could break your requirement for obfuscating the R.class \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/3cca9830237c6d3d5364a573566323e7c9db7291 ?\n. ok thanks. :) \n. not really as this is rendered by android, and it's really hard to modify this alignment. a better implementation would be that you provide the IconicsDrawable as compound-drawable to the Button. \n. @Saime1942 the .actionBar method will make the icon 24dp and 1dp padding as you found already. The thing is that google does not use 1dp padding for all of their icons and some have different paddings around the icon itself. in special cases it is required to define a custom padding to exactly match google icons. it is not possible to find the correct padding automatically as it is really different. \n. @HellPie thanks. looks fine\n. @andersonsoares you can use those icons programmatically. you can't reference them in xml's like you can do with normal resources.\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/typeface/ITypeface.java#L33\n. @kongnanlive improved the readme. ;). but you should always check the interfaces you are going to implement too :D\n. because rendering won't work in the preview of Android-Studio. If i remove this line it won't show your layout at all. If you have a solution how it would render the font let me know, but as far as i know this is not possible.\n. @powerhcm8 that works sure. But you will have some additional effort just to see it in that editor. . @toyongbanatero you can't use this on a canvas. It seems you mix up a few things. \nThere are 2 different things the iconics library does / or can do:\n- Icons within text (of TextView, Buttons, etc...) - \n  In this case the Iconics-library uses a SpannableString and replaces the {cmd-star} with the unicode character used to identify the specific icon in the iconfont, and sets a TypefaceSpanable on it. So it switches the font for the exact position and then this font is drawn as icon as the unicode char matches to this one\n- Icons as Drawable - \n  The other function is that the Iconics-library can create Drawables under the hood it uses a similar mechanism to draw the icon instead of normal text. (A bit more complex as it was optimized for performance...) In theory it creates a path out of the specific unicode char (specified via the  {cmd-star} notation) in the specific typeface and draws it. \nIn your case i think you will have to draw the text. and then also draw the {cmd-star} icon as bitmap (you can create a bitmap out of the IconicsDrawable \n. @timrae was already discussed here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/48\nThe problem is that the google icons have different paddings and the icon-font icons do not contain those paddings. By default i add 1dp padding but that's to less for some, so you would have to modify the padding value for those a bit. \nIt is no possible to automatically provide the same padding values for all icons via .actionBar() \n. @timrae this is no issue of google nor of the library. \nthe thing is that the png's are all well prepared by the designers and define different padding to fit perfect into the system. those can be different by icon and also by icon size (but this is not common)\nicon-fonts do not contain any padding around the icon as the font and the vector of the icon fills up the area. so it can be used everywhere. it does not have to contain this information. \nbut this is a known thing for all icon fonts. the only solution would be that someone builds up an wiki containing all the paddings for the different icons. (or even an util class would help here)\n. yeah. but i'm not sure if they include the padding in the vector icons? if yes you could create an icon font of those vectors and use it. ( i think)\n. hmmm should be tried if those contain the padding, if used in an iconfont\n. @timrae sorry for the late answer. \nI looked on how the font is defined and created. It seems to be a limitation of the icon fonts to be not able to include this. \nI'm really sorry. \nPerhaps for use cases like this it is really easier or better to use the new provided tools by google which allows you to use VectorDrawables api 21+ and let the tools create the png's for you.\nThanks for your feedback\n. @CROSP because i have defined a 3-char prefix for the fonts so more combinations are possible.\nI'm sorry but the 3-char prefix is a requirement with this library for the font identifiers. \nSo you will have to replace fa- with faw-\nBest,\nMike\n. @h6ah4i thank you so much. seems fine. I will test it on my side and merge it later today\n. @clement9527 which dependency also requires the google-material-typeface? Can you exclude it from this dependency?\n. @clement9527 thank you for your solution. i hope it will help others who also have a similar setup to fix this problem. \n. @aacanakin thanks for the addition. i think i can add this to the core. \n. @aacanakin do you want to create a pull request? \nyou also should change support-v4 to appcompat-v7.\nOr should i add it?\n. @aacanakin ok already added. will be in the next release\n. @javiersantos could it be that your friend has a custom font defined on his device? it seems that the theme framework changes icons too sometimes. \n. @javiersantos hmmm :/ \nthe community-material icons have a different unicode range so they are not overwriten. \nno default \"custom\" theme? :/ i have no device with CM so i can't test. But i had a report from one guy who had a custom font which broke the icon font.\n. on your OnePlus it's fine? Does it allow to modify themes? probably we can do some testing?\n. @timrae , @javiersantos i will upload a SNAPSHOT of the Google Material Icons today with a modified unicode character mapping range. It will need someone with this issue to try the font then?\n. @javiersantos i've uploaded a SNAPSHOT\nuse it like this:\ngradle\ndependencies {\n    compile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:1.2.0.2-SNAPSHOT@aar'\n}\nyou have to add the SNAPSHOT repository for this to work\ngradle\nmaven { url \"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\" }\n. @javiersantos to be able to change the unicode mapping i used the GoogleMaterial font from icomoon. it seems gm_highlight_off does not exist. only gmd_highlight_remove\n. @javiersantos i will look for a better solution (to be equal to the old mappings) later. First to make sure this change will fix the mapping problems as described with custom roms\n. @javiersantos ok found a better way to change the icon mapping. should be the same as with the previous version now just with a different unicode character:\ngradle\ndependencies {\n    compile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:1.2.0.3-SNAPSHOT@aar'\n}\n. @javiersantos does the new SNAPSHOT look better?\n. @javiersantos ok thank you so much.\n@timrae thanks.\nI also asked someone else but he was not able to reproduce it anymore :/ strange thing. \n. Thank you so much for testing. If I only could reproduce it on my side of any phone. \nBut it seems to be a big limited to cyanogenmod + theme \n. @javiersantos but it's working with the Community Material Design Icons?\n. @javiersantos the CommunityMaterial is no different to the GoogleMaterial icon addon. which is really strange. both a normal icon fonts. the SNAPSHOT variant of the GoogleMaterial icon addon uses the same unicode range for the characters. \nIf i only could reproduce it somehow\n. It is really weird. \nThank you so much for your time. \n. @timrae i see and i'm sorry that there are limitations of icon fonts. \nAbout the wrong icon issue. I have no more idea how to fix, and i'm afraid i can't solve it as long as i have no possibility to reproduce it on my end. \n. @javiersantos can you please ask your friend which theme he is using. i hope i can somehow reproduce the issue. \n. Installed CM12.1 on a HTC M7 and tried 10 different themes. I really can't reproduce it. sorry. \n. @javiersantos i'm afraid it is an issue caused by this rom. \nTo be fair i'm not sure if i should or even can support this. \ni just tried the theme which is linked in the euphoria thread. also not possible to reproduce this bug. but he can reproduce it all the time with this rom. after rebooting etc?\n. @javiersantos and he also does not use something regarding xposed?\n. @javiersantos thank you so much for all your time and that you answer all those questions. \nI am really afraid that this bug can't be really reproduced or fixed. \ni am sure there is a root cause for this somewhere, but as it is working for all stock devices (+ stock manufactur devices) + most custom roms i still think Android-Iconics can be used in production. \nI hope some day we are able to find the root cause for this. I will close it for now until we are able to reproduce it on another device. \nAdditional i can also publish the changes of the google material icons addon \n. @javiersantos do you use an IconicsTextView somewhere or use the Android-Iconics icons within a TextView / Button somewhere?\n. @javiersantos i have a new font source for the Google Material Icons as i've found that if you used the old .ttf inside your TextView it was badly missaligend. \nI have released a new version v2.1.2.1 of the GoogleMaterial font addon. \nCould you please try if this one fixes the mapping issue?\nTHANK YOU so much :)\nThe new source is this one:\nhttp://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/\n. @justinkruit you are the second one with this rom having the issue. the collegue from @javiersantos also uses Euphoria for is One Plus One. I have the fear that exact this ROM breaks the mapping. \n. @javiersantos i noted this in the README.md (probably will move this to a new MIGRATION.md) that the mapping changed as the new font (which uses the same icons) has a different mapping. \nI know that it's bad that the mapping names changed but the font itself also is better as the icons are aligned vertical centered inside the font. so if you use them inside an TextView they are centered. \nThe new sample app of Android-Iconics (from github) uses v2.0.0 and the new icons. The play store variant was not yet updated. \n. @javiersantos so it seems the new GoogleMaterial font fixes it ;). That's awesome. \n. @justinkruit the GoogleMaterial font is not included in the drawer library. The drawer library only contains the core. You have added the GoogleMaterial font addon to your dependencies. Just update it there to v2.1.2.1 remember that it will change the mapping names. Here's the cheatsheet of them:\nhttp://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/cheatsheet.html\nI'm really sorry that the mapping changed, but it seems the Google team mapped and packed the icon font wrong. So i switched to the external project which uses exact the same icons\n. @justinkruit which problems did you have with updating? were it the new GoogleMaterial icon mappings? If yes, I'm really sorry for this, but this is caused by the new *.ttf i use from this project: http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/cheatsheet.html.\nIf something else, could i have helped you to avoid / fix this problem? \n. @justinkruit ok great :D. I hope everything was mentioned in the MIGRATION.md of the MaterialDrawer https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md\n. So finally i can close this issue :). \nTHANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR HELPING. especially @javiersantos and @justinkruit \n. @Ks89 that's strange. Not sure what the android system breaks in this case. I don't think that i can modify anything in the view to change this behavior\n. @fliespl do you use proguard?\nif yes it sometimes happen that it can't automatically register the font. So this should be done in a CustomApplication\njava\nIconics.registerFont(new GoogleMaterial());\nShown here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L13\nOther than that. Will it work if you use the icon programmatically and set it on the ImageView?\n. @fliespl ok great.\nYou can also try to add this to your proguard configuration:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#proguard\n(it will deactivate obfuscation for all fields which is probably bad for your application)\n. @fliespl ok that sounds interesting. Not sure what could cause this as it works in the sample. \nCan you temporary try if it will work without proguard?\n. @fliespl ok thanks\n. @fliespl ah great that you found the cause.\n. @javiersantos both icons are not in. perhaps they have updated the font.\n. @candeiasdan the font size does not change, but the depending on the icon font the icons boundings may differ. \nso switching isn't the issue for you right? As of your sample you register \"option_01\" but afterwards you use \"option01\"\n. @candeiasdan depends on the process how you've created the font. That really depends how the vector is placed and defined. Not sure how you can modify the baseline or re-align it. Which service did you use?\nIf you really want to have full control i highly recommend you that you use the icon via the IconicsDrawable and set it on an ImageView this will give you better control, like padding, alignment within the bounds, height, width, ... \n. The new source also contains all icons. Here's the cheat sheet:\nhttp://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/cheatsheet.html\nsorry that the names are different. but the updated source has many advantages. It fixes the broken icon mapping on some custom roms, and it also aligns the icons centered within text. \n;)\n. thank you :)\n. The sample contains a StateListDrawable\njava\nStateListDrawable iconStateListDrawable = new StateListDrawable();\niconStateListDrawable.addState(new int[]{android.R.attr.state_pressed}, new IconicsDrawable(this, FontAwesome.Icon.faw_thumbs_o_up).sizeDp(48).color(Color.parseColor(\"#aaFF0000\")).contourWidthDp(1));\niconStateListDrawable.addState(new int[]{}, new IconicsDrawable(this, FontAwesome.Icon.faw_thumbs_o_up).sizeDp(48).color(Color.parseColor(\"#aa00FF00\")).contourWidthDp(2));\nb6.setImageDrawable(iconStateListDrawable);\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L92\n. @fliespl oops. should remove this. this comment was for a different thing i removed from the sample\n. will remove the comment ;)\n. @AngleV I am currently not sure, but I remember that this is just a setting on the StateListDrawable\n. @seba123neo interesting. AllCaps is set to false?\n. Seems they have some more custom handling in :/ \n. @seba123neo if you use the new ContextWrapper feature and use a normal Button ?\nI close it for now. please report back\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/tree/develop/weather-icons-typeface-library\nAdded the weather icons\n. @paulirotta all icons are still there, with a different name:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#google-material-font-1201----2121\nThe source changed to the Google Material Iconic project which fixes the icons to be correctly positioned when used in text, and it also fixes a really really rare issue that the icons are not displayed on some custom roms.\nYou can find the mapping of the material design iconic font here:\nhttp://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/cheatsheet.html\nThose are exact the same icons as before. I'm really sorry that the names do not match. \n. ah ok. sorry you are right. uploaded the new version. thanks. will take a while to show up as update\n. thanks\n. @jd-alexander you can use this library also without wrapping the base context. You will then have to use the custom views. \n. v2.5.0 is now compatible with calligraphy. see the upgrade notes ;)\n. @TheLoyalCruel the icons are no ressources. The drawables are generated via an icon font.\nSo you have to go via the IconicsDrawable and set the icon as drawable \n. @Orbyt both do the same so there is no difference in performance. The lib will create drawables from the icon font addon and those are drawn if shown. \nThere is a third possibility that you set the drawable inside your adapter programatically. \nReally depends what you need.\n. @Orbyt if you have any troubles let me know ;). But the new context inject method is really cool :D \n. @Orbyt in general i would suggest to use the inject method as it is really transparent and you can continue using the normal ImageViews (and the fact that they are probably replaced with updated ImageViews from the support libs, not sure if this already happens but it is done for ImageButtons)\nSo no change of you code to the IconicsImageView. Nor any other things. Just add the attributes. \nAnother real advantage is, as soon as you inject the context, it is also possible to use the Iconics on all views which extend ImageView (the icon via the attributes) or TextView (within the text) so no changes within your code either. \nThere is one advantage of using the IconicsImageView when you set the IconicsDrawable via xml and want to modify the color at a later point. The IconicsImageView comes with methods to do this. On an ImageView you would have to create a new IconicsDrawable which is not slower or anything, just the fact that you have to know which icon to create :D \n. @DJafari if you can't use the context thing you will either have to use one of the provided custom views IconicsImageView, ... or set the icons programtically via the IconicsDrawable \nI never tried if it's possible to wrap a wrapped context\n. v2.5.0 is now compatible with calligraphy. see the upgrade notes ;)\n. @androideveloper wrong version:\nhttp://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.mikepenz/google-material-typeface\nIt is: 2.1.0.1.original\n. @echthard icons are updated as soon as i see that there is a new version. Will update to the new version later today\n. @echthard thanks.\nnot sure. it is not included in their release. perhaps in a future release?\n. @thekalinga you should not have to add the font to your project. that's already inside the project. icon fonts can't be painted from the preview in AS as far as i know, so you should disable adding the icon in the preview by checking:\njava\nif (!isInEditMode()) {\nas in the IconicsImageView https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsImageView.java#L52\nto be fair i never used the AS preview :D i paint those xml's in my head. and now with instant run, running the app on a device is really fast :D\n. @thekalinga because it does not use a Path to draw the icon, but directly uses a canvas. downside of their approach is that they do not offer a contour, etc... \nI don't think the preview is really necessary. I will try a few things, perhaps i can get it to work but i can't promise it\n. @thekalinga and you are sure it fails for you because of the stacktrace you showed and not because it can't resolve the font? i can't get it to read in the typeface. (changed the silent \"null\" return to throw the excaption inside the font)\n. The icon already has isInEditingMode() @Robyer https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/iconics-view-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsTextView.java#L48. @Robyer please just add isInEditingMode() to your custom view as usual. Drawables don't have the inEditingMode your view is having the bug in the end. . but that's the point of isInEditingMode disabling all components of your custom view, not working in the editor. @Robyer if you want to add  something like IconicsDrawable.setInEditingMode(isInEditingMode()); to the library via a PR I am more than glad to merge it. \n. @thekalinga the first thing i see is that you try to set the image size with this method sizeDp but you provide a ressource id instead you should use this method sizeRes \n. This is a user-issue :D If a lowerCase className is provided the generator will generate it lowerCase. the default class naming is uppercase\n. @wakkow thanks for the pull request. \nYou are right the new prefered implementation is the IconicsLayoutInflater which brings compatiblity with calligraphy and is much faster as it does not use reflection\n. @xsorifc28 it seems the export of their icons does not include all icons. i can't do anything about that. there was already a second icon which was missing. i checked in their download and it was also missing there. the addon includes all icons which were inside their official font download + css mapping with the current version a week ago\n. i can check again if you want. as written it was a different icon the last time\n. @xsorifc28 ok thanks \n. @Plastix  can you please provide a screenshot. \nBut if i understand you correctly you expect the icon to show up in the small dialog when you click on the overflow button. But those items do not have the icon. If your element is shown in the toolbar itself (not in the overflow) it will show the icon. \n. @Plastix i have an idea what could cause the issue, but it is not Android-Iconics related. I am sure that a normal icon (from resources) won't change your behavior. \nIf i'm right your issue is that you have to replace android:showAsAction=\"always\" with app:showAsAction \n. No problem. Great that it works now ;)\n. @anupsarode their official icon pack (if i download the whole icons) does not include the wallet icon. just the google-wallet one with the name wallet.\nThe official google material icons include the icon you search for: https://www.google.com/design/icons/#ic_account_balance_wallet\nBest,\nMike\n. @stuckless could you please provide some sample code you tried?\n. @stuckless thanks for the code. i never tried something like this. i expect this to not work with the IconicsLayoutInflater but i may be wrong. Will check if such a behavior is possible.\n. Ok after some debugging. At the moment i do not allow ColorStateLists. But would be a great advantage ;). Will keep it on the list for things to ad\n. I think the solution of @alorma is really great. \nI will keep in mind to probably add ColorStateList support in the future \n. @kumold can you please be a bit more specific?\n. @kumold i will close this until all the required information is added. thanks.\n. the thing is that the text will be replaced with the unicode character mapped by the specific font. So there will be no more {faw-adjust} inside the text. You may be able to check if the text equals the unicode value defined per icon:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/fontawesome-typeface-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fontawesome_typeface_library/FontAwesome.java#L192\n. @7ShaYaN7 good idea. you can also do a pull request if you want to ;)\n. @7ShaYaN7 it's already in now :). If you search you can drag out the Drawer and you will see that the badges will have the number of found icons with the search term\n. thanks\n. @kazy1991 looks fine :). Thanks \n. @drinfernoo which versions are you using?\nThe exception is really strange as there is no Community.Icon just a CommunityMaterial.Icon\n. @drinfernoo when you clean build the project? \nwhere does the error occur?\n. @drinfernoo oh. i assume you updated from a previous version?\nCheck your imports i think you may still have the old import in your project\n. as already stated do you have wrong imports in your java file?\n. remove those imports and import them new\n. i do not understand why it tries to import CommunityMaterial.Icon it should only\nimport com.mikepenz.community_material_typeface_library.CommunityMaterial\n. @drinfernoo can you provide a sample app showcasing this. i really do not have any more ideas why this happens for you :/. does it also happen with other icon fonts available for the Android-Iconics?\n. @drinfernoo i really don't understand why you have this issue. If you have your project on GIT or any other SCV, i could take a look and try to reproduce your issue. Just give me temporary access, and i will try it. \nI am sure there must be some strange configuration issue. \nAnd yes the Icon is an enum so no method. \n. @drinfernoo just provide to compile your project with AndroidStudio but i can't get it to run. a lot's of issues. \none thing which i saw is that the MaterialDrawer import should look like:\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.6.1@aar') {\n   transitive = true\n}\n. Why have you discommented the iconics library? https://github.com/drinfernoo/Cuber/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L49 without this one it won't have the core\n. @drinfernoo which development environment are you using? With Android Studio i was not able to get it running.\n. @drinfernoo ok this may describes why i can't compile and run the project. I have the bad feeling that AIDE may causes some strange problems. I had no other reports like this, but as it is not the official development environment it's a bit hard to support. \nYou can't use Android Studio?\n. @AruLNadhaN you can't define an Android-Iconics icon via xml on the NavigationView as this one is a menu and does not extend from TextView or ImageView. You can only set the icon programmatically\n. @Orbyt if you try to create an icon with the size of 8px it will be really tiny, and the FloatingActionButton will probably scale it up the the required size again. You should set the size of the icon to the size the icon will be displayed. \nThere is also no difference in any methods like sizePx, or sizeDp as they all call the same methods:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L412\n. @Orbyt that's the behavior a ImageView works. Make sure your ImageView and the FloatingActionButton extends the ImageView displays the icon the correct size. So you create the IconicsDrawable let's say with 24dp, and you make the size of the ImageView also 24dp. So it will look best. \nI can't (and it would not make much sense) modify the default behavior of Drawables and ImageViews\n. @carstenbaumhoegger the icon font packed by google has a wrong baseline of the icon. I haven't yet found a better packaged variant, which keeps the same icon naming. \nTo solve this i have added another icon addon which has the correct baseline. It's based on this icon font: http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/ \nThe problem here is that the naming is a bit different. To use this icon font just add\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:material-design-iconic-typeface:2.2.0.1@aar'\n. @carstenbaumhoegger yeah it took me a long time to figure out this issue of their icon font. \nIt is only a problem if you use the icons within text, so i didn't mention this in the readme.\nOk great :).\nNo problem\n. @vipheyue what do you mean?\n. I will close this one until enough information was provided\n. @vipheyue ok thanks i modified that one. \nRegarding the compile 'com.mikepenz:materialize:0.5.1@aar' dependency. This one is no dependency of the Android-Iconics library. \nThe Materialize library is the dependency of the MaterialDrawer and is automatically added via the transitive = true\ngradle\ncompile('com.mikepenz:materialdrawer:4.5.9@aar') {\n    transitive = true\n    exclude module: \"iconics-core\"\n}\n. @gzlock you include this dependency: \ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.1.0.1.original@aar'\n?\nAnd do you use the icon via xml? If yes you might try to register the font:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\njava\nIconics.registerFont(new GoogleMaterial());\n. @gzlock you include the wrong font. \nThe material design iconic is this one: http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/\nYou have to use this one:\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.1.0.1.original@aar'\nThe original is important. \nDon't be confused about the 2.1.x instead of 2.2.x as this comes from a migration i have done. (i used the material iconic as default google material typeface for a few weeks)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#font-addons\n. @gzlock read this please: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/121\n. @localh0rzd hif, and fon are just samples from the demo, those are not contained inside the provided font addons. \nA list of all font addons can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#available-fonts\nfaw-adjust should be found. This is inside the following font addon\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:fontawesome-typeface:4.5.0.1@aar'\nIf it does not recognice the font, can you please try to register the font via:\njava\nIconics.registerFont(new FontAwesome());\nShown in the sample here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\nHave you enabled proguard for your application? Normally it should autodetect the font\n. @localh0rzd in general it should automatically detect the fonts, but it seems in some cases it can't. \nThe problem is the iconics-core doesn't know about the addons. I would try to detect them via a string ressource which defines the class of the font addon. if this is found i try to init the class. \nI will check it again if i can find what's wrong. \nIf the fonts are used via code this does not happen, just via xml. \nThanks.\n. @localh0rzd ok just tried it in the sample. the detection algorithm detects the fonts correctly. Not sure why it may file in your case. \nIf you could debug into the Iconics.init(ctx) (Line 52) method it would be great. Which FONTS does it detect?\n. @localh0rzd thanks. \nCould you also please try what is returned if you call the getFields(Context ctx) method on the GenericsUtil\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/utils/GenericsUtil.java#L20\njava\nGenericsUtil.getFields(this)\nIf it is empty. it seems like it can't resolve the R variable via this method:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/utils/GenericsUtil.java#L34\n. @localh0rzd no you don't wasted my time :D. Now i know why in some rare cases people still have to register the font addons :D. \nThank you so much for your time, and for debugging and for finding this case where the R-Detection fails. \nThanks\n. @ayublin no Android doesn't allow you this. There are some \"hacks\" which might allow you to show an icon there, but this is not Android-Iconics specific\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18374183/how-to-show-icons-in-overflow-menu-in-actionbar\n. @jeetdholakia you can't use them via xml. But you can set them programmatically as Drawable \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#use-as-drawable\nAs the icons are IconicsDrawable and draw from the icon font, they are not inside the drawable resources.\n. @jonathan-caryl i even found that i can use the ParcelableSpan which is used by the other spans too. Tested it right now, and seems to work. \nThank you so much for the sample app and the detailed report. A new version will be out soon ;)\n. @tachang as the FloatingActionButton extends from ImageView you can set the drawable via xml if you use the IconicsLayoutInflater https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#3-define-iconicslayoutinflater-to-enable-automatic-xml-icons-detection-optional\nThen you can do this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#as-imageview-only-available-if-you-follow-step-3-or-inject-the-context\n. @ayublin i already used it with the official FAB as it extends from ImageView. So i can confirm it is compatible.\nI never saw the message you get in the log. Interesting :O\nWhere do you set the IconicsLayoutInflater\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#3-define-iconicslayoutinflater-to-enable-automatic-xml-icons-detection-optional\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#as-imageview-only-available-if-you-follow-step-3-or-inject-the-context\n. @blipinsk does this also happen with the sample app?\n. @blipinsk any custom font set for the whole application which may overwrite the icon font? Proguard? Any log outputs which could state that it can't find the font? \n. @blipinsk weird enough. i can test with java 1.8 if it changes something\n. You use Android Studio with default build?\n. @blipinsk ok to be honest i would have never guessed somthing like that. \nInteresting enough that the build does not fail or notify about conflicting folders. Upper/Lower-case things are always bad. :/\nThanks for the detailed info. I hope it helps others in the future.\n. @sytolk sorry i can't support anything else than the default build tools and setup from Android. The pom.xml you linked above is automatically generated by the gradle build and not managed on my side.\nIf you have s olution how this can be changed let me know.\nSorry for this.\n. @sytolk i just double checked again. the gradle-mvn-push.gradle uses the original maven plugin from gradle. and the pom's are auto generated. seems there may be some problems with the maven plugin. \nperhaps jcenter will have different poms. have to try it\n. what are your dependencies? do you have a custom applicationId set? do you use proguard?\nDo you have any log output?\n. @sytolk if it can not automatically detect the font, just register it before first usage (or within the Application)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\nSo it will be Iconics.registerFont(new GoogleMaterial())\n. @sytolk I do not know sorry. As i use the gradle build system from Android I can only can support and test the official one. \nAs of your pom.xml you use the wrong dependency. The correct one for the GoogleMaterial font is the following:\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.1.0.1.original@aar'\n. @sytolk as written in the other thread you mix up two font addons. \nYou want to use the following: \ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.1.0.1.original@aar'\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/build.gradle#L18\n. @carstenbaumhoegger \nSeems like the auto addon resolver can't find the R class when you switch your applicationIds, The easiest solution is that you just register your font's programmatically. So the Iconics class can resolve the font. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\nfor GoogleMaterial this would look like:\njava\nIconics.registerFont(new GoogleMaterial());\nJust if you are interested. This code fials in your case:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/utils/GenericsUtil.java#L34 \nSeems the package id differs\n. Great ;)\n. @theblitz you do not use the GoogleMaterial font but the Material Design Iconic font. I had to rename those because of confusion. So the original GoogleMaterial is the following:\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.1.0.1.original@aar'\nThis change was done with release v2.5.1\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/releases/tag/v2.5.1\n. @theblitz the size depends on the font. the icon font with the most icons is the community material design icons with 188kb \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/community-material-typeface-library/src/main/assets/fonts/materialdesignicons-v1.3.41.ttf\nSo it depends.\nBut no there is no reason not to include more than one. I also use 2 icon fonts in most of my apps\n. @dongseok0  I understand that you may have seen this in a similar library. But I do not want to copy the other libs featue, even if it would be useful in some cases.\nSorry for this. I hope you understand it.\n. @Ramfat I understand that you may have seen this in a similar library. But I do not want to copy the other libs featue, even if it would be useful in some cases. \nAs far as I have seen most people use this library to get the IconicsDrawable and use the icons directly. So you could modify all those values.\nSorry for this. I hope you understand it.\n. As this library works with Icon fonts you simply create a custom font which contains your vector icons and use this one. In many cases this is already done by the design team because icon fonts are used in the web also. \nif you do not have the icon font, you may consider using the Android Studio built in SVG support which will create drawables for older android versions\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#create-custom-fonts\n. @MFlisar theoretically it would be possible to have a custom ManuInflater allwing this. The problem is that the MenuInflater is not as extensible as the SupportLayoutInflater is. That means I would have to copy and paste all classes from the android source code, which has a few bad side effects. If Google updates something we will miss this. I tried it once to extend the MenuInflater but I can't hook into the correct methods...\nIf someone has ideas, I am always happy about pull requests ;)\n. @josmanperez thanks for answering\n. @MFlisar the icons use the positioning defined in the font. If this is wrong in the font provided by Google it will also be the same inside the app.\nHmmmm ok i just messured the distanced from the arrow on the right, and it is exactly in the center. The simbol is just bigger so it seems it is off the center but that coms automatically because this is a triangle xD The only thing you have to do is provide the correct image scaling and define the IconicsDrawable with the correct size + padding\n. @MFlisar that can't be true. I can say by eye that on the right the space from the arrow to the end of the dark circle is not twice as much on the right. (the red rectangles are both the same width)\n\nFirst you should change the ScaleType of that FAB to not scale the image. If it does not scale it will work automatically without you defining the padding.\n. @MFlisar hmmm ok then I don't understand the issue. As shown in my image the triangle is centered exactly. It only has a different size than on the right. And the size can be changed by defining the correct size and changing the ScaleType to one which does not scale up the image\n. @MFlisar ok now we come closer. The font is correct then. The font has all icons perfectly centered. It does not contain the different paddings the png's from Google contain. You can adjust the IconicsDrawable to get it pixel perfect too, but this can't be done on the library side. There is no rule how Google positioned the drawables. Sorry that it took me so long to understand the issue.\nok great ;)\n. @MFlisar yeah it is really hard. But in most cases i still prefer the centered once. You can still adjust the positioning pixelperfect via the IconicsDrawable without loosing the always scaling properties ;)\n. @TheAndroidMaster could you please add some images to show the acutal issue?\n. @TheAndroidMaster yeah this would be awesome, but I am afraid this is not possible. I do not know of a solution (and I did not find one) how to calculate the arc center point of a path i paint on a canvas. \nIf you or someone else knows how to do it. Please open a pull request ;)\n. @AngleV do you have the correct scaleType for your FAB? Do you have defined any padding? If you define the size of the IconicsDrawable to 16dp the drawable itself will be that size. But that must not mean that the ImageView will display it exactly like this if you have defined a scaleType or if there is any padding on that view\n. @AngleV could you please also add a screenshot. seems fine. should exactly display as 16dp then.\n. @AngleV great ;). \n@Rainer-Lang thanks for helping ;)\n. @AngleV as mentioned above. That's the behavior of the FAB (of the ImageView) and the Drawable can't do anything against this.\n. @yaserseyedi your IconicsImageView has an IconicsDrawable set?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsImageView.java#L165\n. @yaserseyedi  can you please try it again with v2.5.7? Sorry for the late answer. I was pretty busy the last few days\n. @kuno you can directly use the API if you want:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/Iconics.java#L139\nCan you be a bit more specific why SpannableString does not work?\n. @kuno with the current version I remember all ParcableSpans and reapply them afterwards. May I can change it to CharacterStyle as the ClickableSpan directly extends the CharacterStyle interface\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/utils/IconicsUtils.java#L37\n. @kuno can you please try it again with v2.5.7? Sorry for the late answer. I was pretty busy the last few days\n. great :)\n. @fmeneuhe sorry i can't merge this pull request as it is not correct. \nFor you pull request you should fork this repository. change the file inside the develop branch (or a new feature branch) and afterwards create a pull request with this branch. \n. @fmeneuhe ok then I will add it :). Thanks for the PR anyway :)\n. fixed in v2.5.6\n. @dominicsavb you can use the IconicsDrawable everwhere, where it's possible to set a Drawable. \nIn this case you have to do it programatically. \nSomething like this. http://stackoverflow.com/a/33724768/325479\n. @pperliti just checked the error logs. They are really weird. They show no reference to the Android-Iconics library.\nDo you have any special Spannables set on your text, or anything else? I never experienced such issues before, and I also use the Iconics a lot\nCould you provide a sample app which would help to debug this issue?\n. @pperliti I know it may not already be the solution, but what if you would have the icon as a separate IconicsImageView prior to the TextView? Would give you more flexibility and you would not have to use the IconicsLayoutInflater \n. @pperliti ok just debugged it via the sample. The issue is that if you use the automatic detecing of fonts within a RecyclerView that it reuses the fields and this causes an inconsistent state as it switches out everything very fast. \nTo be able to automatically also replace the placeholders with an icon if you set the text, the IconicsFactory registers an addTextChangedListener which will fire if the text is changes. This is to takes a short time, also the modification of the string and replacing with the icon. Which can cause your described exception.\nAs far as my debugging shows I don't think this can be prevented inside the editable replacing. \nYou can easily fix this if you directly set the icon within the adapter with the following code:\njava\nview.setText(Iconics.style(ctx, new SpannableString(\"{faw-hospital-o}\")));\n. @jiqimaogou you can do this programmatically and just set the drawable\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/4502650/325479\n. @jiqimaogou just checked again. Doesn't really make sense to add so much overhead into the library for this rare case. I really recommend that you simply set it via code. \nThanks. \n. @emojahedi could you please add a screenshot? In general the rounded corners are transparent. Are you sure your views background is transparent too?\n. Please report back. \nI will close this until additional information was provided. Thanks.\nIn the sample application in the Playground there is an icon with a background and rounded corners. And it doesn't paint the corners in black\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L76\n. @emojahedi you define a your rounded corner as 50dp whereas your icon only has an size of 20dp. That won't work. \nThe max corner radius which would change something would be 10dp (size / 2) \nWhat's your desired result?\n. @emojahedi oh ok. There is no function included to draw a circle around your icon. sorry\n. @theblitz you can define a background and it's color and then you can define the radius of the corners. If you take width of the drawable / 2 it will be a circle\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L645\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L543\n. @theblitz oh well. Seems i misunderstood your initial question. \nI'm afraid just a circle is not possible. You can either add a border to the icon itself, have a solid background. change the corner radius of the background, but not border for the background. \nsorry. \nfor this you will need a background drawable or whatever is fine for you\n. Thanks ;)\n. @fmeneuhe how did you get this crash?\n. @fmeneuhe ok thanks. In addition it is also important which version you used and which elements of the Android-Iconics you use\n. @fmeneuhe not sure what really happens but seems to be a platform issue. \njava\neditable.clearSpans();\nthe app crashed with the above code\n. @AngleV the IconicsDrawable reacts as a normal Drawable would. I assume in this case it's easier to have an ImageView on the left of the TextView\n. You could extend the IconicsDrawable and overwrite the draw method for your case\n. @AngleV thanks for adding your solution to the issue so someone else can reuse it if he gets the same issue\n. @osiloke which dependency do you use? \n. @osiloke just checked out the sources. It is definitly in:\nhttp://central.maven.org/maven2/com/mikepenz/iconics-core/2.5.10/\n. @osiloke weird. the dependency seems fine. Do you have other libs which may refer to an old version of the Android-Iconics ?\n. @osiloke ok none of them should contain it\n. @rakesh1988 it can't automatically replace an icon in a hint. This is only possible for text. You might have to manually set the Spanable you can generate via the Iconics class\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/Iconics.java#L139\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/Iconics.java#L177\n. @MarkOSullivan94 any log output?\n. @MarkOSullivan94 it is also not working in debug so I assume proguard is not the issue here. \nHave you tried to also set a color? Or a size?\nCould it be that you have defined a different applicationId in your manifest? This causes the font auto detection to fail, and then you have to register your font as shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/67#issuecomment-134345018\nAlso done in the CustomApplication here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\n. @MarkOSullivan94 no it should be in the Application as shown in the sample app. Or at least before inflating the first IconicsImageView in the Activity which will contain this view it is already too late\n. @MarkOSullivan94 ok if none of the above helped. Can you provide a small sample showcasing the issue so I can have a deeper look?\n. @MarkOSullivan94 ok the issue is really easy to fix. :D And not related to the library. \nYou use the wrong url for the app namespace, because you already had the card_view namespace defined. \nBy default Android studio will define the res-auto url, if this was already defined it will use the tools url. If the tools url is used android studio is happy but will remove the defined xml properties during the build. \nTo fix your issue just remove the card_view namespace. Change the app namespace to:\nxml\nxmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\nand change the card_view:card* definitions  to app:card*\n. @LaurentTreguier please try out the suggestions mentioned here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/160\n(you might want to start with the last comment: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/160#issuecomment-208435767)\n. EDIT: just saw that the same works on the imageButton above. \nI am sure it works with the  FloatingActionButton as i already used it with one. \nIf you set the icon programmatically will it work?\n. hmmm defining a width and height for the fab doesn't change anything? trying out different scale types?\n. @LaurentTreguier I really do not know why the VisibilityAwareImageButton should be an issue when using via xml. :/ You might need to define the visibility in the xml? (just a thought) It's completely weird. \n. It was on Android 6.0.1 but with an older version of the support libs\n. @LaurentTreguier after some more debugging I have no idea why it is not working. \nThe only weird thing I see that it will never enter the IconicsLayoutInflater with the FloatingActionButton so it is also not able to set the icon\n. With the latest support libraries yes. But I have no solution for it. The only idea I have right now is to set the icon programatically\n. I am out of ideas. @Rainer-Lang has the same setup as with which I tried it now.\nandroid gradle tools 2.0.0 (he uses 2.1.0-alpha5)\nbuildTools 23.0.3\nsupport libraries 23.3.0\nAppCompatActivity as base activity\nlatest version of the iconics\n...\n. @LaurentTreguier oh the only difference is that he uses the alternative ContextWrapper\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#3-alternative-inject-into-context-optional\n. @LaurentTreguier to be honest I didn't know that the FloatingActionButton does not go through the IconicsLayoutInflater and I am really sorry for the trouble. :/. \nI will have to do another debugging session and try to find out what the system does behind my IconicsInflater. \nThanks for your time and support.\nThanks @Rainer-Lang for finding the final solution ;)\n. @seba123neo yes it is fine: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_playground.xml#L194\nYou have to remember the IconicsButton will set the icon via the text, so the textsize in dip might not be the same as if you use an ImageButton and set the icon as image with 24dp\n. @papylhomme hi. Yes this is intended. The font shortcut should be always 3 characters long, as defined in the interface for the ITypeface\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/typeface/ITypeface.java#L38\nThe reason why i limited it to 3 characters is that the icons can be used via xml too and in other locations too. When I resolve it there I will always check if a id is 3 characters long, if it's longer or shorter I will ignore it and go on. It is done like this for performance, and other optimizations. \nJust use a 3 character ID ;). There are enough possible combinations still available with 3 characters ;) \nThank you so much\n. @JohnnyShieh You might should even use the latest v23.3.0 as the Iconics already use the latest one\n. @Ewg777 your proguard rule destroys the enum used inside the GoogleMaterial font. \nYou will need to keep the enum as described here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/6286534/325479\nSeems like your proguard configuration is very strict\n. @meNESS you mean you want to use it in an xml selector? Sorry no this is not possible. As far as I know it is not possible to hook into those mechanisms of android. \n. @irsalshabirin the StackTrace has no reference to the Iconics. Can you reproduce this every single time?\n. @trungie it's really weird. because the two use exact the same code. It just seems that the system does something really weird when using a TextView strange thing is that this only happens if you use String.format as far as I've seen, because setting a normal \"String\" does not result in any issues\n. @trungie \"plain\" in terms of the html is not applied, or the icon is not replaced?\n. Hmmm most styles should persist from the HTML markup, as I try to keep those spannables when applying the icons. Is \"bold\" or \"italic\" working?\n. <b>?\n. @alvinpb seems like the Html.fromHtml styles text a bit different than the normal spannables, because those should be kept via Android-Iconics \nIn general I always suggest to use the Android-Iconics in ImageViews because it gives you much more control about how it is displayed than within the text\n. @alvinpb can you please retest this with the lastest version\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L946\n. @iampawan this is not available in this library. You can still animate views on your own, no need for something like this in the drawable\n. @iampawan please provide details\n. @iampawan yeah but how do you set it for the ImageView? How will you define it for the TextView?\n. @iampawan any log output you see?\n. Any new feedback? Will close for now\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L669\n. I am not sure why calling a method requires a sample :O \nThis will change the thikness of the border around the icon itself.\n. that's something I can't tell you :D you can provide it also as px or dp but that's something on your side. nothing which needs to be done in a sample.\n. @edesdan any special logoutput you get?\nI think you have the wrong dependency. You want the real Google Material Icons which are those:\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.2.0.1.original@aar'\n(the .original)\nYou have the dependency for the Google Material Design Iconic typeface. which has similar icons but is handled by a different dev\n. @edesdan it should be enough if you jsut register the font in your Application:\njava\nIconics.registerFont(new GoogleMaterial());\nIt can happend that it won't be autodetected if you have a applicationId set in your gradle, or if you have proguard enabled. \n. @kuno where do you use your icons. Only via XML or programmatically? If only via XML you might also want to try to register the font programmatically within your Application as done here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\n. @AAverin the font is updated whenever someone mentions that it is outdated, and whenever I see that it is outdated. No way to automatically keep the font updated\n. @artkoenig the issue is that Buttons do not allow any Spannables to be applied on them as soon as they have the Capitalized flag. For this reason this is removed and the text is displayed normally. (But Icons are working) The only way around this is to either don't wrap the Context and do not use icons on those buttons, or you keep it and set the text of those buttons in capital letters.\n. https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=210834\nAnswer on the Android bug report\n\nThe custom drawable has several issues:\n1. Use of setBounds() internally. This method should only be called by the View that owns the Drawable.\n2. No handling of onBoundsChange(). This is where the Drawable should respond to bounds changes, e.g. update mPath.\n. @artkoenig that's a weird issue. Could you also please try if it is the same for icons you create via the IconicsDrawable directly?\n. I can't test it in the Cloud Test lab, as I do not have credits for the Firebase testing, which will cost about 5$ per hour. The automatic pre testing in the play store might only will show the initial screen (I am not sure about this one) I will give it a try\n. Seems correct\n\n. Oh you are right :O. The thing is this was only screenshoted for this one device, I think it randomly clicks. so i don't see it for the other devices :/. \n. The question is why it only occurs on the IconicsTextView I have no idea as it does basically the same as the normal TextView just at a different point of time\n. @artkoenig I am really without a hint. Where you able to get something similar on any real device? In general I always recommend to use the IconicsDrawable directly as it gives more control over correct paddings, margins, placement etc than within the text set via the font, as it will differ on phones or may be different size as different baselines etc are used on phones. \n. Haha last open issue from all my open source projects. If I only could reproduce this on any of my phones. \n. @artkoenig oh if it is this problem. There is nothing I can do about this, as the character range is defined by the font so in this case by Google. \n\nYou can use one of the alternative fonts. Like the Material Design Iconic font which includes basically the same icons with different names and it uses a different character range: http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/\nChanging the local might be a solution to. Sounds a bit \"dirty\" so I can't do it inside the library. \nThanks for pointing this out @artkoenig \nSeems like I can close this, as there is nothing I can do about those things. \n. @meNESS seems like Firebase does not allow you to run it with a wrapped context. \nWhat activity do you use?\n. @meNESS your exception states so: com.google.firebase.iid.FirebaseInstanceIdInternalReceiver\n. @meNESS that's weird. Perhaps from the latest play services? \ngradle\ncompile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:9.0.0'\n. @meNESS ok great. Seems like the crash was just passed through the ContextWrapper and the initial issue was an incompatiblity of the analytics sdk\n. @AAverin thanks for the report. \nSo this means that the description is correct with Activity here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#3-alternative-inject-into-context-optional ?\n. @AAverin once again thanks for the detailed information\n. The FAB extends from the ImageView so everything which is written in this section:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#as-imageview-only-available-if-you-follow-step-3-or-inject-the-context\napplies to it. \n. @Polyterative the first variant should work. \nAnd you get no log output? You have the corresponding font in your project? And it was able to register? \nIs it the first position where you use a font via XML?\n. Could you please do the following step. (registering Ionicons in your case) just to make sure the font got autodetected (auto detection won't work if proguard is configured wrong, and also if an applicationId is set in the build.gradle)\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#register-fonts\nEDIT please see the below answer\n. Oh sorry I missed one thing. You use the LayoutInflaterCompat this one does not work on FABs for a weird reason. See here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/161#issuecomment-220830768\n. @Polyterative sorry for wasting your time, should have remembered this point. \nI have added the information to the README. Thanks again\n. @Polyterative yes I know ;). But many people prefer to set it via XML so they have no code for it. Internally it will do exactly what you just did programatically. \nTo be honest I always prefer to set my icons programatically as it gives me more flexibility\n. @frodoking so it works as CompoundDrawable if you have a background set or it still only applies to the background then?\nWhat's about this answer:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/8#issuecomment-62551409\n. @rmarau I assume it is related to the fact that I no longer set the bounds explicitely, as this was noted by the Android developer in the Android N ticket. I can try to readd the setBounds but this should not be done as noted here: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=210834&thanks=210834&ts=1463954825\n. @rmarau yes. I think this is the best option to use it as compound drawable now.\nThanks. (I added the label good to know so hopefully people will search it ;))\n. This is back to the old behavior. I have readded the setBounds calls as they do not break the Android N fix. \n. @jayrave the icons do not respect the padding as this information is lost in the process of drawing the icon. \nYou can set paddings on the icons via: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L351 (or the other padding methods)\n. @jayrave I have added a new feature which allows to keep those paddings (if enabled custom provided paddings do not work on this single icon)\n. @shayanzoro could you please be a bit more specific. You can use the IconicsDrawable in all activties without any issues. \nAnd this: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#3-alternative-inject-into-context-optional should also work\n. @shayanzoro if you can't do the auto detection for normal TextViews you still always have the option to use the IconicsTextView and the other Iconics* views. \nIn general I suggest that you just go with the IconicsDrawable and use it on ImageViews as it will make sure that sizes etc stay the same even if users mod their font etc on the device\n. could you please provide a sample app or code which allows me to reproduce this issue?\n. Ok great :)\n. @fweigl your font must have a correct mappingPrefix (with exact 3 characters) here: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/typeface/CustomFont.java#L43\nand it has to match the prefix of the enum too:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/typeface/CustomFont.java#L111\nAlso read this please:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#create-custom-fonts\n. @fweigl exactly. the prefix is picked up to efficiently detect which font to use. \n. @AAverin yes correctly. It is not possible to fake the Android-Iconics icons as normal drawables which are useable everywhere. \nCreating this selector programmatically should help you though. \n. @Rainer-Lang you want to do a pull request?\n. the font informations have to be added to the specific font addon module\nand the license needs to be added to the AboutLibraries\n. @Rainer-Lang added the licenses you sent to me to the AboutLibraries. and added the first definition files to the first 3 fonts. you can do a pull request for the other fonts please. \n. Great ;)\n. @Rainer-Lang meteocons has a custom license:\n\nMeteocons are free for use in both personal and commercial projects.\nNo attribution or backlinks are required, but any form of spreading the word is always appreciated!\nYou must not resell any icons or distribute them in any other way.\nThe Icons as such are the property of the author.\n. thanks\n. @ccjeng the latest iconics also uses the latest appcompat library v24. Please make sure you also use the latest appcompat version, otherwise it may come to appcompat conflicts. The above ressource is not part of the library itself\n. @thelou1s could you also please add a screenshot? Can you reproduce this? I think this is related to this issue: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/179 (please answer my questions there)\n. thx\n. thx ;)\n. thx\n. thx\n. thx\n. thx\n. thx\n. thx\n. thanks\n. thanks\n. thanks\n. @pedronveloso textAllCaps is not supported as it prevents spanables to be set on a TextView this is a limitation by android, nothing I can do here. \n. Yes there is. Showcased in the sample application: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L57 . @mikerussellnz I am not sure on how to implement those two methods. Have not found any implementations. Also the IconicsDrawable already implement the Drawable so I expected those methods to be in place. \n\nDo you have any references? \nPerhaps it's necessary to follow those steps:\n``` java\nDrawable drawable = ...;\n// Wrap the drawable so that future tinting calls work\n// on pre-v21 devices. Always use the returned drawable.\ndrawable = DrawableCompat.wrap(drawable);\n// We can now set a tint\nDrawableCompat.setTint(drawable, Color.RED);\n// ...or a tint list\nDrawableCompat.setTintList(drawable, myColorStateList);\n// ...and a different tint mode\nDrawableCompat.setTintMode(drawable, PorterDuff.Mode.SRC_OVER);\n```\nas noted here: https://chris.banes.me/2015/04/22/support-libraries-v22-1-0/\n. @mikerussellnz hmmm weird. I tested with setting the tint via the specific API on the Drawable and it worked without troubles\n. @mikerussellnz the download doesn't seem to work :(\n. @mikerussellnz I have found the last missing bit and fixed it. There will be an update soon. \nOne more thing which may be interesting for you. If you add .respectFontBounds(true) to your icon it will be the same size as the original VectorDrawable. By default the icon will use the full width and/or height (24dp will result in a real 24dp height icon). With the above setting it will keep the bounds from the font which may be what you want in your case\n. v2.7.1 is rolling out now\n. Thanks for the sample project\n. @mikerussellnz that's weird. Just tried quite a lot of things. Added logs etc. setTintList is called, but it does not take up the state. I can't even set the state as it wouldn't make a difference. I have no real idea currently where and why this is triggered or handled wrong\n. @EasyLian have you added the GoogleMaterial font addon?\ngradle\ncompile 'com.mikepenz:google-material-typeface:2.2.0.2.original@aar'\n. @EasyLian you use AndroidStudio and the latest build tools and everything? \nAlso the latest version of the library? \nThere are no issues with this in the sample app:\njava\nnew IconicsDrawable(this, MaterialDesignIconic.Icon.gmi_search).color(Color.WHITE).sizeDp(24).respectFontBounds(true)\n. @EasyLian otherwise may you can provide a zip containing the source code so I can try it?\n. @EasyLian oh great that you solved it ;)\n. @ahmetcj4 sorry could you please be a bit more specific about what you need?\n. @ahmetcj4 great ;)\n. @BobOtike I assume it looks something like this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/devicon-typeface-library/build.gradle#L20\nEither you define those properties in your root build.gradle or you replace it with a specfic version in your case\n. @BobOtike I can't really help you regarding \"gradle\" as I can only give library specific support (everything else would be too much work) \nEverything is visible in the github project.\nHere's the definition for vars in the root build.gradle\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/build.gradle#L13\nhere you define modules:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/settings.gradle\nand yeah the other gradle files are also in the project\n. @stleusc thank you for the detailed report. I will have a look later today, after work. \nThank you so much :)\n. @MFlisar no there is no reason for this. but it's a good idea. would take pull requests for this. \n. will be in the next update of fontawesome and googlematerial for all others I will add them if they have an update or wait for a PR\n. This issue is related to: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/202\nPlease continue conversation over there\n. @raviteja06 is this exception new?\n. @raviteja06 how do you define the IconicsDrawable to be drawn in your layout? \n. @raviteja06 so it also throws an exception when you use it programatically not only via xml?\nI tried the above with the included icons, in the sample app and I can't reproduce it\n. @raviteja06 can't reproduce this. everything works fine as intended when I open the preview window with the sample layouts in the latest Android Studio. (it won't show the icon, but also no exception. which is the correct behavior)\n. @joielechong there is no icon called faw_edit in the current FontAwesome\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/fontawesome-typeface-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fontawesome_typeface_library/FontAwesome.java\n. @joielechong which is an alias for: fa-pencil-square-o, which is available: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/fontawesome-typeface-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/fontawesome_typeface_library/FontAwesome.java#L194\n. @marbat87 it's on their website but not included in the export. The easiest way to validate this is to search in their css  and try to find the name: http://cdn.materialdesignicons.com/1.6.50/css/materialdesignicons.min.css\n. @MisterY thanks great. Have you tried to create a custom icon addon for the Iconics libs with it?\n. @MisterY could you may provide those files? Perhaps the css is different so the generator does not like it. or you may have not provided all necessary details. That's why I want to reproduce it\n. @MisterY could you please tell me which files you provided? and which information you entered?\n. Just tried it with the data (and just inserted some dummy text) and it worked\nmmex.zip\n\n. @MisterY ah ok :D I am not a real frontend dev so it may not work with anything other than Chrome xD\n. @MisterY the iconics-generator is not open source. I will have a look. \n. This change is now on the site\n. @nfranke hmm weird. Especially as the above does not have any reference to the Iconics library. It may be resulted through the spans being handled a bit differently. \nWould you be able to just use the IconicsTextView in your case? As it just extends from TextView anyway. \n. @pdalfarr I am happy to take a PR to add it somewhere in a FAQ or so :D \nI'd prefer though to figure out the real reason for this. because the TextView should not behave like this :D . \u2327 means normally that the unicode character is not found. \nBasically the way how the library is work it uses the normal text rendering. So it's fast and efficient. \nSo to set an icon at a position it searches for the occurrence of a placeholder and will replace that one with the representing character and applies a TypeFaceSpannable on it (to set the font for it). \nIt seems that the normal textView somehow has a race condition where it does not realize that the text was changed and has now a different length or so..\n. @DeveAndyloper just changed the sample application to have marquee activated inside the AutomaticActivity and it works without any problems in there. \nYou can see the code here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/b82dad7e8165c18e088ac68ae8b89e20f48be2d1\n. @DeveAndyloper as it is working when the text was set via the xml, I also assume that it will start working when setting all the properties after the text was set. Also as it is working via xml + the code above it is no Android-Iconics issue, and rather some combination of TextView, Marquee and Spannables and selection not set or so which causes this. \n. @EzraLopez sorry this is not possible with the Android-Iconics You may just spilt this text up into 2 TextViews and an IconicsImageView in the center. \n. @EzraLopez it is quite a rare requirement so I haven't added this, as you can easily achieve it with different implementations too ;)\nThank you. Great it works for you\n. @claudiobastos that's not possible as android's Notifications only allow you to provide a real resource. Sorry.\n. No problem :) Sorry that it is not possible\n. @jiangyongandy please add more details. \nWhat do you want to achieve?\nWhat did you try?\n. @jiangyongandy you can provide a TintList which is a ColorStateList, which will then update the color:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/b8521b6ae449914b064d4b54282b1c9eebdae79e/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L823\n. You can set it via xml on API >= 21 (http://stackoverflow.com/a/28353871/325479) \notherwise you have to do it programatically\n. @EzraLopez thanks. That's the correct implementation if you don't want to exclude the R fields. \nI have marked this as \"good to know\" hopefully people will use the search function or the tag function prior to asking ;)\n. @EzraLopez if you got time you may can setup a FAQ section similar to the one of the MaterialDrawer. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/FAQ.md\n. @guenodz hi. \nno changing those is not possible. (if changed it will require every single app to be changed to support this again) \nWould you be able to just use ImageViews or IconicsImageViews in your application?\n. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/66b338ccb48c317089a28492f0db660abb093e35\n. @Eloar depends on \"where\" :D in general it doesn't matter\n. @ade the character count for the prefix is documented in javadoc:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/typeface/ITypeface.java#L40\n. http://static.javadoc.io/com.mikepenz/iconics-core/2.8.1/com/mikepenz/iconics/typeface/ITypeface.html#getMappingPrefix--\n. I know that it does not prevent it, but I can't throw an exception inside the interface. (default methods are not supported) \nSo I have added the javadoc, and mentioned it here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/wiki/CustomFontAddonCreating \n. @ade you can open a PR for the later ;)\n. @ade the icon should be in general a single unicode character. (I have not tested) and so I do not support multi character unicode mappings. \nWhich font generator do you use, which generates cases like the one mentioned above?\n. @ade still not really sure. It is correct that it used the backslash as escape character:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/google-material-typeface-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/google_material_typeface_library/GoogleMaterial.java#L117\n. You miss the e after the u (which will make your character no real unicode char)\n. Oh yeah sorry. was not on a ide right now. \nThe main issue is exactly the following \\u005c all chars before and after will work. I think in general it is already not a good idea to use common text characters as icon. Do you have a special use case which requires to stay in such a low unicode range?\n. @ade yes. That's true there may be some more characters. But I think it should be enough to mark this issue as good to know, so hopefully future devs who also have to use such a low unicode range will find it. \n. @ade awesome. Thanks!\n. @rakesh1988 the Android-ActionItemBadge is only meant for the Toolbar that's right. \nAt the moment there is no plan to have a separate lib which will created badge views. You will have to do it on your own. (There may be already other libs doing something like this)\nYou can always also use the icons from the Android-Iconics as drawable and put them somewhere\n. @drinfernoo no this is not supported as we do not have direct access to the font vectors, but rather use the system built in font rendering processor to generate the drawable\n. @MickHardins please update to the latest version of the android iconics library. This was fixed 1 or 2 months ago\nYou will need 2.6.0 or newer:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/releases/tag/v2.6.0\n. No problem ;) As long as it works now, everything is fine :D\n. @joaomgcd for using svgs I recommend to use the Android's built in mechanism via the VectorDrawable or the VectorDrawableCompat.\nThere are also already other projects just for the use case with svg's so you might have a look at those too. \nThis project aims to use the advantage of having an icon font (just a single file) with many possible icons, and using the fast internal text rendering to get the drawables. \n. @hareesh145 IconicImageView? So you have a EditText and beside this a IconicsImageView? \nThose 2 views are independent. So it is no issue of the lib. You can also see something like this in the sample applications playground / automatic mapping activity where you can enter without any flickering or other ui glitches\n. @hareesh145 please provide a sample application showcasing this issue then. \n. I close this as I can't reproduce this without a samle\n. Thank you :)\n. Awesome. thank you very much.\ntesting in a few seconds. ;)\n. thanks for helping to make it even better ;)\n. @rakesh1988 oh no problem. I'll delete it\n. update it on bintray and maven cetnral. your local caches though could still have the old version (I did not change the version number)\n. @athasamid could you please provide some additional details? What do you mean it does not work? \n. do you use the icons via xml or java? Do you have some log output regarding the iconics library?\n. @athasamid oh ok then it'S very easy. Either you follow the steps shown here to support proguard:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#proguard (which will enable font auto detection) \nOr you just register the fonts you use at some place before using. Like done here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\n. @athasamid where do you do the registerFont in your CustomApplication?\n@msneujink yes that's the proper way of registering the fonts when proguard or different applicationId prevents the auto detection of the fonts\n. That's weird. do you see any special logcat? Can you probably debug? Are you sure this icon does not exist? Have you tried it programatically instead XML?\n. @athasamid please report back\n. @CMircea usually it has something to do with the reflection based approach not being able to find the icons. (it tried to get the R class and via the R.class the string resource which specifies the font to load)\nif you register them you basically tell the library which fonts are available and then it can find the icon which you use. @ANPez do the new icons also require the updated .ttf font? In general I always used the .css file with the mappings to generate the *.java file\n. @ANPez looks good. thank you \ud83d\udc4d \n. @amithgc in general I recommend not to use it like this, there is also a android component doing a rating bar with stars?\nother than this. it might be a bug, which I have to debug first. @arvi in general you don't have to use the iconics inside text. Youc an use them as normal drawables everywhere. \nIn addition if the automatic solution would not work in your case, to just do it manually. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L57\n. @RobertBroersma your \"app\" namespace refers to the tools instead of res-auto\nI highly recommend that you always make sure that your app namespace refers to res-auto and don't give it some lib specific naming. @B-Esmaili this is not library dependent. seems like some android framework thing. \nIn your case I suggest to set it as compound drawable or just in an ImageView programatically. \n. great. . @sagits do these icons have the paddings already in the raw data?\nIf yes you could try respectFontBounds(true) \nIf not there are the methods to define an offset inside its bounds. @sagits with respectFontBounds it should have the correct paddings as defined inside the font. so this should be fine for those icons. Are you sure it does not change? \nI am not sure how such a PR would look like as you would basically have to go though all icons and add a util or a helper to define the correct paddings for those. . @sagits yes that was in those old issues. respectFontBounds was added at a later point, adding the feature that it will now set the paddings as defined in the font. (I didn't know in the past that this was possible) As far as I've seen, this worked. But maybe I am wrong. \nNot sure. Perhaps adding this informatoin to the \"enum\" of the font. @sagits currently not possible if you use it via xml only. . @ashwanikumar04 the IconicsDrawable will allways make sure to use the ApplicationContext \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L127\nThe context is mainly used to resolve resources you may pass into the drawable. @Tolriq to say it in a different way, you would like to have a fallback icon if the main icon fails to load? \nMy only question is, you as developer implement it, so during implementation you check if the icon is there, so you can take care this is shown during implementation, and nothing will change in the icon set itself after you implemented it?\nI understand such a usecase for image loader libraries, but for this case? Icons are static somehow. And what would be if the fallback is not existing?. @Tolriq I am fine with a PR and I think the above method would definitely be helpful :). \nThe only issue is that Application.getInstance() shouldn't be used, and the context should be passed in via the method. Sorry for missing this one for so long. merged your PR. @kalyandechiraju just check out the sample app. that does exactly this. \nYou will just need the logic to store it into the db. @kalyandechiraju yes that's possible. check out the sample app's code. it showcases how you can do this ;). @komlan55 it is a normal Button so it supports everything a normal button does. I will try to update this very soon. Updated to 3.0.1. But there were no new icons. It will probably go away after you removed LayoutInflaterCompat.setFactory(getLayoutInflater(), new IconicsLayoutInflater(getDelegate())); and set iconics drawables manually. \nThe question remains why it thinks that your text should contain an icon. IconicsImageView will still work. yes. The LayoutInflaterCompat would just allow you to use icons in any TextView or any EditText in your whole app. I anyway suggest having it defined just wherever you need it, as it give you greater control. @kalyandechiraju this is supported to a specific amount. You can find out more in the sample app. \nThis will allow you to color an icon: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L59\n. the code will just style the icon. not the text before and after. java\nnew Iconics.IconicsBuilder().ctx(this)\n                .styleFor(\"faw-adjust\", new BackgroundColorSpan(Color.RED), new ForegroundColorSpan(Color.parseColor(\"#33000000\")), new RelativeSizeSpan(2f))\n                .on(yourTextView)\n                .build();\nwill just apply the colorspan and forgroundspan and RelativeSizeSpan on the \"faw-adjust\" icon in the given textview for example. . @EnotBoris first. Why are you including all the icons dependencies?\nSecond. You are just replacing the .withIcon(FontAwesome.Icon.faw_map_marker), with the GoogleMaterial icon?. @jayrave you can do a PR and provide something like this :D. @jayrave I'll close this issue as it is no more issue :) I would still love to see a PR at some point, if you find time. \n. @rpgdev first this question is in the wrong repository. \nSecond no this feature does not exist, and would need to be implemented manually on your side, as this is really some custom behaviour. @rpgdev basically you will have to listen to the click events and then decide based on select/deselect if this current item is in group 1 and then check if you have to selecect somethinng in group 1. @NovaViper you can use it to load custom fonts, so you just create a extension with the icons. \nFor vectors, or normal drawables just use the system default components. what's the log output?\n. In preview mode you will never see it :D. @NovaViper do it programatically as you would do it in general :D. You should give the icons a size . And color :D. @NovaViper that's nothing for the Drawable. That's just layout's and definition of your ImageView :D. @csbenz that's how this method works. It uses a text and displays this text. there is the method icon which will use the icon name:. https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L175. @csbenz this library is not meant nor can't it show system emojis. @chrisonline notifications do only allow real resources, no programatically generated drawables. So you can not use it there. Sorry. That's no limitation of the lib, that's a general limitation of the system.. @spoonart1 which typeface do you use? And which version of the library? \nIt seems some phones have altered the way of font rendering which results in this issue for some unicode range. \nYou may want to use the material-design-iconic-typeface and try if it solves the problem. This maybe the same as discussed here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/90\nAnd this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/179#issuecomment-231070781\n. @rpgdev it possible will take me a bit longer to update. You could open a PR updating it though :D. I currently do the update. Thanks anyways ;)\nFor the next time you can also use: http://android-iconics.mikepenz.com/. @toyongbanatero thanks for the really really detailed report. \nI totally understand your problem, but I think that might not be possible as easy it it may sounds. \nIn your case I see an additional \"Problem\" You are using the IconicsButton even though you just need a single drawable. Using a ImageButton and setting the IconicsDrawable programatically would be a better solution I think. \n. @chrisonline you have the \"cmd\" icon set which are the material community icons, and not the google material icons. Just use the sample app to check which icons are in which icon set. \n. @chrisonline do you have an too old addon included? If you check the sample app you will see it is there, and works. @pn in Android spannables do not work if the text of a button is UPPERCASE which is the default on the system, so the inflator changes this to make icons possible (setting the text in uppercase in the first place is more performant by the way anyways)  Please use the normal IconicsDrawable approach if the above does not work as you expect. @msegmx no you can't use the inflater there. But you can use the manual approach and just replace the iconics icons on the TextViews (buttons) where you need. \nHave a look here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L56. @natnayr this icon is not mapped in their *.css web font. Nothing I can do about it. (check yourself by downloading their zip and opening the materialdesignicons.css)\nThe icon font of Android-Iconics is already on the latest though. @thaindq seems like the spannables do not like each other. In this case I suggest to simply not use the IconicsLayoutInflator and just use the Iconics icons on views where you need them. it should as the AcppCompatButton extends the TextView \nIt might be related to the TextAllCaps flag which is set to the view by it I think. In general I would anyways suggest to directly use the Iconics class to apply the icon, or set it as compount drawable. It is not necessary to check all TextViews for a possible icon which needs to be replaced. @drewlarsen you can also do the SetAllCaps false via xml. So if you know it, you won't necessarily need a different view ;) . @DasserBasyouni sadly not. Android can not draw the icon in the xml preview. you could theoretically use a placeholder icon via the tools namespace and set it there. But the drawn Android-Iconics can't be displayed in there. @rpgdev the icons are size independent. The question is how you apply the icons to that ImageView which scaleType is set to the ImageView and which size() the IconicsDrawable were crated with. \nThey still have to follow the normal rules of scaling within an ImageView :D. @rpgdev you should give them a size. the android system can otherwise not correctly define its bounds resulting in issues like the one you see. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L452\n . @rpgdev yeah it could be. Are you seeing the same issue in the sample app?. Perhaps you can try a few more things. like shown in the sample app. It should work for you too. Do you have an update? Please report back. Close til that. @DasserBasyouni the crash isn't directly happening from the library. it happens because of firebase. \nAs this is not working (as of firebase's fault) simply use the IconicsDrawable as compound drawable. @DasserBasyouni the ico_size is not working in this case as the IconicsButton does not use the raw IconicsDrawable but instead displays the drawable as part of the text. This means the icon will always be in the same size as the text. \nIf you want to change the icon size in that case, either set it as CompoundDrawable programatically (which is the better solution) or you do this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L58\nYou can then use any spannable to change it's look.. @RiccardoM have you tried to exclude this \"wrong\" sub dependency? Like shown here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21765656/325479 . @RiccardoM I understand that it is a bit more complicated. But it will just get too hard to do releases afterwards. I'll mark it as \"good to know\" and will remember for future questions. you have jcenter as providing repository in your root gradle? \nIt is available here: https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter/iconics-core/3.0.4. @lorisgir thanks a lot for doing the update. merged your PR. and published it to maven central :). Thanks. @goutomroy you can use the IconicsDrawable wherever you can set a Drawable this is only possible programatically. \nYou can't use those via xml. (Just in the provided IconicsButton and IconicsImageView) . @bschwind if it also happens with other drawable's I assume it is a general issue then. \nHave you tried to invalidate, or to set a specific size to it?. @bschwind ok that's weird. Seems to be an issue with the bottom navigation view then. Perhaps the icon needs to be set as Bitmap? It might do this for icons set via xml. @bschwind thanks for adding the solution. It is really strange. Great that you found out what was causing it. Thank you very much :). Thanks for the PR. I do not see changes to the enum containing the icon mappings. Where there no additions or adjustments in the new font? . Oh my bad. GitHub didn't show the full diff for that file. \nTesting now :) . Thank you very much for the PR. it is definitely a nice addition. \nIf you have simple icons with just different colors per state this is definitely a great solution. \nI had provided a sample with a StateListDrawable here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L89 \nI'll test, and merge as soon as I checked everything ;). Looked really good :) \ud83d\udc4d \nIn addition I did some more optimizations to the implementation of the setState & getOpacity methods. @PeterPhyo what do you mean with it does not appear in xml? The Android Studio preview will not show the icon, and never did. When you launch the application it will as long as the icon exists.. @Philipp91 nothing I can do about. that's Android's limitation. \nAndroid textAllCaps breaks Spannables being used. you would not be able to for example make the text bold, color parts of it either....\nJust set the text in UPPERCASE programmatically. It's anyway the prefered way as it is much faster with less overhead.\nThere is a IconicsImageButton for example which disables textAllCaps automatically. @DJphy are other icons working?\n. @DJphy if you remove that icon set which is crashing. Will the others work?\n. Remove entypo and use the GoogleMaterial one. Is it working or will it also crash? . case 1 is incompatiblity of the support libs. you need to use 25.3.1 for everything. You are not supposed to have different versions. if you have different versions it will always fail. \nAnd using the icon sets with an older version of the iconics lib could fail. I can not support this.\nYou could exclude the support libs of the iconics. \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/21764128/how-do-i-exclude-all-instances-of-a-transitive-dependency-when-using-gradle\n. in addition why do you want the support-v4 as jar file?! it is included in the appcompat lib anyways. @PeterPhyo why'd you use an IconicsButton for just an icon? \nThere is the IconicsImageButton which is meant for icon only. And this has more methods to do so. \nOtherwise you can always set the icon as drawable: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#use-as-drawable. @carmas123 please use hte built in functionality to color icons:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/PlaygroundActivity.java#L57. @carmas123 can you please show what you tried? Because in the sample it is working fine. @carmas123 shouldn't change much. \nThe textview is always empty? the code you posted will only adjust the color of the icon if it was set. So if no text is set, it makes sense that it stays empty :D. Do you have any other spannables or fonts or so set manually? Anything which might break the icon? \nany log output saying that the icon does not exist or so? \nis it working without any color change or so?. you mean without this:\njava\nval spannable = SpannableString(\"{gmi-pin} my text bla bla bla\")\n?. @carmas123 so why do you want this SpannableString then?. @carmas123 for this there is:\njava\nIconics.IconicsBuilder().ctx(activity)\n  .style(ForegroundColorSpan(Color.RED), BackgroundColorSpan(Color.RED), RelativeSizeSpan(2f))\n  .styleFor(\"gmi-pin\", BackgroundColorSpan(Color.RED), ForegroundColorSpan(Color.parseColor(\"#33000000\")), RelativeSizeSpan(2f))\n  .on(b.textView)\n  .build()\nand the best would anyways to set the Drawable as compound drawable. @carmas123 if you set it as compound drawable not. . @carmas123 and then you set the icon via the IconicsDrawable as compoundDrawable. @carmas123 well using the android iconics as Drawable via the IconicsDrawable is anyways the better and prefered solution. The other is just a gimmick, and gives by design (and by the limitations of Spannables) a less flexible and a more complicated solution.... @alessandrotorres this might be related to this PR: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/pull/272. Sadly I am / was very busy in the last time so I haven't yet had a chance to take a closer look. If you have a bit more time it would be great if you could debug into it and check if you possibly see a cause which could lead to that. \n@hanneskuettner referring you here as you might have an idea.. @alessandrotorres can you please try to invalidate the icon after changing the color?. Thanks to @MFlisar this will be fixed in the next version. @jwburnside you can try something like the following \njava\nd.setBounds(0, 0, d.getIntrinsicWidth() - UIHelper.convertDpToPixel(4), d.getIntrinsicHeight() - UIHelper.convertDpToPixel(4));\ntextView.setCompoundDrawables(d, null, null, null);. That's completely weird. Something breaks it. But I have no idea what it could be :/. \nPlease try if it also happens with normal drawables. (from resources), if yes it is a framework issue or so and you should open a bug on Android, if not some text rendering might cause troubles. Closing as there was no answer > 2 weeks. @gromiloff in that case i'd suggest do use the IconicsDrawable as compound drawable of the TextView as it results in better results than using it witihn the text. (there is not enough control I have about icon's displayed within text, you can possibly somehow adjust it by using some spannable, but for the best possible solution use a ComoundDrawable). Do you have any additional logs or outputs?. Have you tried the alternative solution: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#3-alternative-inject-into-context-optional ?\nIf that does not work I highly suggest that you use the Iconics provided views. And / or set the icons programatically. @MFlisar so the default color tinting of that view does not work? \nHow do you define the drawable? I remember there are some problems in the framework (for normal drawables at least) if you tint using the xml, you can no longer tint using code. There are also problems if you tint with a single color, and afterwards with a colorStateList. \nHave you tried to directly supply a ColorStateList for tinting? \nIn addition it could also be related to this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/278. It might be really related to the other problem of not switching the color later. \nhave you also tryed the android:state_selected also?. Can you please try the previous version of Android-Iconics? I am curious if it really was that PR we merged. Oh ok sadly. :/ would have been an easy fix :D\nok :). @MFlisar hmmm you tried the previous Iconics version right?. yes. oh wait\ncan you please try to call super.setState(stateSet); in addition?. well looks good that way. Awasome. With that working again that means I will have to do a update. Possibly it also directly fixes: #278\n. Merged your PR. @RiccardoM thank you. @henningvs you are using the MaterialDrawer?. @mychaelgo oh really? Do you have a crash log for me or something?. or is it the same crash as above?. @henningvs oh ok sorry I didn't get that point. The problem is this crash does not happen on any of my devices :/ \nWell I have the debug variant installed. I have to see. Thanks for reporting it\n. I installed the release edition and got the crash. Fixing it right now :). \nAnd it is open source by the way (just see the \"app\" folder in this repo). Fixed it and pushed a new release to the playstore. @ligol no that one is not open source sorry. But it basically generates a font module and defines all the icons. There were some other \"icon\" generator already added as source. See here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/tree/develop/DEV\n(the extractor). @ligol not about the web tool sorry. All the scripts and javascript things which are almost doing everything (the web tool basically just copies the resources to the right places and does what the javascript script does) \nSounds very interesting,. Let me know if I can help with something\n. I guess the issue itself can be closed :D if you ever decide to do a PR that would be awesome. if not thanks for the idea. @ligol that looks fantastic. I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but looking at the readme it really sounds like a super life safer. \nYou might want to open a PR here and add somewhere some information in the README :) . @h6ah4i please create a new issue with this, you are right that this might be a problem in some cases. @jazzgil well why do you use this color? abc_hint_foreground_material_light it's provided by the support libraries I guess, and there is a high chance of it getting removed. \nIn addition this does not really seem to be a Android-Iconics issue. Just define your own color, and you are fine.. @jazzgil well the resource you use comes from some support library. Please just define your own color and you should be fine. @AmirHosseinKarimi just write a helper method which defines your default size and default color for the IconicsDrawable. Not sure where this is any problem?. @zTrap no plan to do this. You simply can set this programatically by using the IconicsDrawable. Well there are many things you have to take care of, left, right, top, bottom, size, padding, ... \nBut sure if the PR is nice I am always more than happy to merge it in ;). @fvermeulen I never used this android designer in my life so I don't know :D.. @novalu @fvermeulen I think the issue is not related to the Android-Iconics directly, but rather to the Support Libraries 25.4.0 (the trace does not show a reference to the iconics) \n. You can try to use support libraries 25.3.1 and see if it fixes. \ntry to force a specific version\njava\nconfigurations.all {\n    resolutionStrategy.force \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.1\"\n}. Interesting. You can check v2.8.7 there are no changes to the views. Can\nyou see if the downgrade did work? With a dependency tree?\nOn Thu, Jun 22, 2017, 12:09 PM Lukas Novak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nDowngrade and force 25.3.1 with Iconics 2.8.7 didn't fix issue.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were assigned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/293#issuecomment-310337244,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABaGiN_ewo3o32oYPBiZhVAVQ8TAYk37ks5sGj1ugaJpZM4OB5_B\n.\n-- \nMike Penz\n\n\nMike Penz\nAndroid | Backend | Open Source | Web Developer\nmikepenz.com\nlanora.io\n. Well the only code change between v2.8.6 and v2.8.7 is this one:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/1ba99beb91fb97e786d7fe5521a9664c5105112b#diff-6dd39d3e1d57d5981614d1655a09362aR891\n. @fvermeulen I don't think this is related to anything in the project. the code regarding this did not change. if you really need the designer, (for whatever strange reason) you can always also apply the icons as drawable without any custom view. @davidgerrad55 adding proguard rules like this is not very clever, because I force basically everyone using my library to accept this. being es precise as possible with proguard is very important, so it can do it's magic and obfuscate and optimize as much as possible. @jazzgil what are you trying? Are you creating a IconicsDrawable with text? You can't set it bold like that, you might be able to do it with a spannable around afterwards, but not sure if it would work. Great that it works :) . @tilmanginzel thank you very much. @pesseyjulien you can only set it programatically. Android has no way to hook into this. . @connyduck thanks for mentioning this. I completely forgot abou tit. @jelther are you sure this is an Android-Iconics issue? Sounds like you opened this on the wrong project?. Please open this on the FastAdapter. setting to \"\" should still reset the filter. it works and is tested (I use it in some of my projects) \nSeems like something else conflicts with this . @zTrap thanks. . @zTrap changes look very good. \nCould you also please add some simples of them into the PlaygroundActivity I guess it would be really coold to showcase your new features :). @zTrap take your time. It will anysays also take me a bit to verify the changes. \n. Thank you :) I'll try to check it as soon as possible. @zTrap just realized I most likely can't publish the update until my MacBook returns from repair. I have to work on windows right now, but the keys and signatures I apply on the *.aar are only on that MacBook + the TimeMachine backups :/. Thank you very much :) . Don't worry. Thanks a lot for the great changes. @zTrap oh :D nice. Thanks. \nI'll have to take a look. . @zTrap one thing which I am considering is to move all provided views to a seperate module. As all the custom views + their logic adds a lot on the method count, and some people may just want to use the iconics via the programatical way. (does not affect your PR :D just saying). @zTrap well I thought to have the core library, which is just the core code, and then a addon for all the widgets. \nsplitting it up more than that would get a nightmare to keep it updated :D. @zTrap oh. Thank you really much. I absolutely appreciate this ;). \nI hope I'll be able to release it very soon for you :D. @zTrap AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH :)\nThat'S basically your release :P\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#special-contributor. You are now officially part of the README :D. @bschnack thank you very much. Currently I did not upgrade to 26 as it is sadly not yet final (at least the support libs, I know that the API is final). Will revisit it as soon as it's out (support libs + Android Studio 3) . @bschnack if you want to fix it anytime before. Feel free to do so by opening a PR :D. thank you. Merged, and will be in the next release. thank you. Thank you very much @bschnack . @zTrap sorry I was really busy the last few days. I'll take a look in the upcoming days. thanks. @atulgoswami21 well I can only use the mapping of the font. if the mapping of their font links to these names I am not really able to fix this.. You might also want to open a PR and add / adjust the ones you miss manually. \nIt would be un-maintainable if I would have to do somehting like this manually. It's just possible to use my automatic tooling to save time and be fast :). @mr746866 check out the sample app it shows all the available icons. (and yes it contains a faw_user and a faw_user2 (filled and non filled)). @onloadcc it looks like a bug. We are looking into it. @onloadcc for now you can use the second variant. I'll let you know as soon as it's fixed. @onloadcc this is fixed in v2.9.1. @annawang1 do you get the same with other fonts provided by Android-Iconics?. Can you try and install the sample app on this phone please? (it's available in the market). @annawang1 did you find something?. Ok. Just let me know if oyu find something. @Rainer-Lang @Gounlaf thanks for the report. With v2.9.x the way how those values are processed changed quite a bit. Sorry for the issues. \nUsing the programatical way should work for now. @fssilva well the check was added to optimize and not set anything in case if there is no icon. but Yeah now as I think about it, I think we can remove it safely. \nThis still does not describe though why there are also reports of it not working via the programatic approach (which seems weird). The issue should be fixed in v2.9.2 of the views extension\nSorry for the issue. @hooman-pro if you just want to display an icon. Then use the IconicsDrawable directly or the `IconicsImageView\nthe icon within the IconicsTextViewmay be cut depending on how the text rendering on that device happens. @hooman-pro I always recommend to use the IconicsDrawable directly as it gives much more flexibility rather than the IconicsTextView. \nIf you really really need it, it follows the rules of text rendering. you might want to add a space afterwards, or make sure enough space is available inside the TextView.\nOr you have an TextView for the text and a CompoundDrawable or a ImageView or an IconicsImageView..\nthe color issue is known, and will be fixed soon. Please refer to the other open issue. \n. Setting the color for the IconicsImageView in xml is fixed. read more here:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/309. @MFlisar it's not possible. And I don't think this makes sense. If you need text + icon. Use an IconicsTextView. @carmas123 it is :O. https://bintray.com/mikepenz/maven/iconics-views/2.9.2. It's available on jCenter(). released it now also to maven central (sorry I am currently traveling so not as responsive as normally)\nit will take a while but in 15-45 mins it will be available. Hmmm I wonder why it is not downloaded via jCenter because it is available up there :D. @Gounlaf isn't this the correct place to check for jcenter availibility: https://bintray.com/mikepenz/maven/iconics-views/2.9.2 ?. Oh ok I see now: https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter/com.mikepenz%3Aiconics-views \nweird :O. @chanderwoo v2.9.2 is released https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/mikepenz/iconics-views/. The icon you set does it have a size or anyhting? \nSeems weird why it wouldn't work. I directly set the drawable:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/iconics-view-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsImageView.java#L88. @r748 ah ok I see. I'll have a look. @r748 no I am sure the support libs 26 makes no difference. I'll look into it as soon as I have time. @r748 the setColor() should work. at least it does in the sample. @r748 could you please try if this: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/7d8bdd98fe1b1aa4e0bf8914e89444730dfaf815 resolves your issues?. @r748 yeah it is somewhat intentionally\nsee the following in the IconcisDrawable\njava\nint alpha = Color.alpha(color);\nif (alpha != 255 && alpha != mAlpha) {\n    setAlpha(alpha);\n}\nbasically I want to allow setting the alpha independent of the color, it's hard to detect if the new color should change the pre-set alpha. . released with v2.9.3. @sajadabasi clean your project. if it still happens you may run out of the 64k dex limit by adding to many libs. Released v2.9.3 which should fix this as mentioend by @zTrap . @MFlisar I don'T think you can style these values like this, as we do not have them as styled attributes. It's not like in the MaterialDrawer where I made them resolve via the theme and styles. \nWe just use a default color, or the one you define in xml, but nothing from a style or anywhere else. so it is correct behaviour. the fields you can define inside the view in xml.. @jd-alexander do you define a size for them? do you see the same behaviour in the sample app?. @utsavmadaan1995 either you use a IconicsTextView or you manually apply the icon replacement\njava\nnew Iconics.IconicsBuilder().ctx(getContext()).on(textView).build(). @utsavmadaan1995 the second thing you wrote is fine. \nOne recommendation. If you have the icon in a position in the beginning etc of a TextView. Consider the compound drawable functionality.. @ryandailey100 you can't this library is not meant to do something with normal drawables. Please read it's description. Can you please be a bit more specific. what's the issue?. any log outputs?. the log does not show anything :/ could you possibly debug into it and see where it stops?. do you see the same behaviour in the sample app?. @androideveloper the icon fonts are not really used as real font. I'll look into it, but I guess it does not bring any real advantage. \ndo you have proguard or anything which might remove it?. very interesting. seems AS was just acting weird. \nYes I'll look into it ;) thanks. @mr746866 can you please post the whole exception?\nfor such a case I recommend using Compound drawables by the way. Please report back with additional details (temp close for now). @zTrap sorry I have had no time yet to check this out :/. @hfkh77 check out the sample app. In addition please remember that using a compound drawable is better in case the icon needs to be top,bottom,right,left .... @mtrakal yeah with the latest version we split the core and the views apart. \nThe possible attrs are found here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/iconics-view-library/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml. @arashzz just set the icon programatically. They don't look like being a font. @powerhcm8 @maxid  you might want to open a PR and add this font? \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/wiki/CustomFontAddonCreating. If you want to use it please open a PR. I am more than happy to include it ;). there is no resource. they are icons which are drawn by the font. please use the provided IconicsDrawable class. @dev2961io did you figure something out? \ndid you try to set the instrinct bounds? perhaps the ImageSpan needs this?. Close for now. Please report back. There are no plans to fix this. \nIf you want to have support for this please provide a PR. @jayrave that sounds amazing. sure please go ahead and open a PR for that. . I think this issue can be closed. Please open a PR as soon as you have something ;). \nThanks a lot!. @jayrave thank you very much. it would be awesome if you could work on this and open a PR. it would give a great feature ;). \nI am currently really filled with some other libraries. just took the time yesterday to update everything ;) . @jayrave amazing! :) \nthank you very much. Please just open a WIP PR we can look into it to. I might have some ideas.\nAwesome work!. the sample app won't compile like this I guess. . @DrFornax if you have an icon only. consider using an IconicsImageView or IconicsButton . @DrFornax could you please post the exact out of bounds exception? \nJust tried it in the sample application and I am not able to reproduce. @DrFornax hmmm it does not have a reference to the library. I really have no clue what might cause it. \nFor your case. You want to have an icon always on the beginning of the text? \nI suggest to use a Compound drawable. it is the proper way for doing something like this. \nThe PlaygroundActivity showcases this. @DrFornax can you provide a sample implementation which showcases this crash? \ndid you try the proper implementation using a compound drawable? \n. @DrFornax thank you for the answer. \nI can only assume that you do not set it in the main thread? \nYou might also want to try and not use the IconicsContextWrapper but instead a normal IconicsTextView and just apply the text via this approach. \nI hope something of these things solve sit for you. @hurshi I'll have a look. It takes a bit. I am super flooded with work and life, .. . Ok so after looking into it. \nThe issue is caused by the following:\nWIth the IconicsLayoutInflater2 I'll automatically replace text with the icon + attach a text listener to the textview. \nWhen we then adjust the text the normal draw logic instantly kicks in of the textview, during this time we get the event of the TextWatcher with the editable, which we modify to be the icon. \nThe problem here is though, that the draw logic of the TextView is too stupid and does not detect that instead of multiple lines (the text for the icon would result in 4 lines) is now only 1 line (the icon is super short, the text behind is also super short, so no line break necessary) So it will blow up. There's sadly not much we can do about this (setting the lines, and line number to 1 surprisingly does not change the internal line calculation :D)\nThe easiest approach to get around this is use the IconicsTextView as this will adjust the icon during setText, another approach (but not so handy) would be to apply the styling to the text as spannable, and apply this then to the normal TextView (so it would have the short string from the beginning) \nAnother nice workaround is to add android:ellipsize=\"start\" to that TextView as this will change the way it calculates line breaks, and it won't crash anymore. . @zwieback did you try to give the icon a color and a size?. @zwieback there are rare cases where it's fine to have no size. that's why it is not an requirement. \nGlad that it works now :). @jayrave your solution already works really fine. the issue you see is basically a limitation of the Android system and requires special configuration of the view. \nThe LayerType of the view has to be defined for the ShadowLayer to work properly:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/1bde8781a24fbc0067b7d28fd7a7dc1aed788f77#diff-1b99f67d13ca2a24e395f7065f1cc374R66\nWe will have to think of a better API to make using the shadow not only easy, but also flexible enough. \n\nWith my above changes to your PR the sample would result in:\n\n. Some indepth reading about this:\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html#unsupported. Well I was first looking into the bounds as you did, but figured very quickly as applying padding did not fix it, but if I apply contour it was drawing fine. \nthen I tried to just resize the text itself which didn't solve it either. \nBut I then realised something. the shadow had always the color of the icon. not the color defined + I remembered something about the layer type. \nThese few informations combined and a quick verification in the docs proofed my assumption ;). @jayrave merging this now as the base is correct.. Keep that specific font you created. like:\n-keep class com.mikepenz.entypo_typeface_library.Entypo { *; }. -keep com.mikepenz.ico_typeface_library.ico { *; }\nshould solve it. \nJust as a side note. Java does not use lowercase classes. @juanm4 any log output? \nany crash? \nwhich support lib version?\nwhich build tools? . What's the error you see?. Thank you very much. @vivekav-96 did you read the upgrade notes?\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#295. seems you already have a LayoutFactory added. \nDo you need the iconics support in all default view's or can you use the IconicsView's?\nIn my opinion the best is anyways still to use the IconicsDrawable programatically. @starapple2 it can only be used programatically. If you can set a Drawable programatically for the NavigationDrawer this is possible. \nThere is sadly no way in Android, to hook into the xml parsing for the menu and interpret these icons. @4Face glide is meant to load resources or images from the web. not for Drawables\nyou can set the IconicsDrawable as normal drawable to that view.\nthe issue is not related to this library. \nJust use glide correctly. Please find more details in the glide library. @rubengees this works intentionally to prevent issues due to the context no longer being active. \nIn case you need to have it activity bound please provide the color as colorInt already:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/8297bc99b78e2b6ce60a0fae6a25ad488a0c5163/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L411\n. @MFlisar it was removed because it would add many many fields to your project (even though you might not need them) pushing apps over the dex limit requireing MultiDex which is definitely bad. \nSimply use the xml and add it to your projects ressources :). (on a side node. I think that is the question with the most and fastest answers, excluding me, since working on open source. Awesome job @zTrap & @DJafari :D). yes. as there is no way to bundle it with the library without it being generated into the R.class file. (just filling up your fields) . @Robyer amazing :) Thank you very much! I'll check it and hopefully release a new version soon. https://materialdesignicons.com/ this is the font. you have to check there.. @Tolriq thanks. reverted it and just wrapped it with a Try it hopefully resolves the AS issues, and still keep the old behaviour. \nIt is released in a quick bugfix release v3.0.2. @ptrbrynt just tried it again with a other icon set. \nadded the *.ttf and the *.css added the description. and it correctly worked. \nWith Chrome. (there is a high chance it won't work with other browsers :D I am no web dev). updated the apk with the fix in the release page. @chanderwoo sorry I do not really understand what you mean?. Close. There are no different resources than in the other addons\nIf you refer to a old version. All resources were moved to: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/tree/develop/FONT_IDS\n. @nbjo460 in which widget? . @nbjo460 this project is a Drawable the icons are not bitmaps nor ressources. \nJust read the README. or look into the sample app: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#use-as-drawable. @dev2961io no. And that's not really a usecase for it :D \nYou can always use the IconicsDrawable programatically and set it into a circular view or so. \n. You don't specify what is not working with the context wrapper. \nWhat are you trying to do. what's the crash. .. . So you should definitely just use one. either the factory or the context. NEVER both. \nFor the other strange combination I have to check but as far as I know it is not conflicting in the sample app :/. I highly recommend to simply set the icon programatically. Which will work on any view, custom views or anything. \nClosing this as it works in the sample for the provided cases. Sounds like an internal crash of the Android system. Or some modified part of that OEM. \nBasically this code just checks the included ressources and tries to detect the fonts which are available:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/utils/GenericsUtil.java#L52\n. well I assume that in such a case the auto registering of fonts won't work. \nSo adding a try catch won't solve it for you. There is a new release needed allowing you to manually register your font you want to use, and after that mark the init as done. so that it won't try this code block over and over again. otherwise you will end up in an endless loop. So in v3.0.3 I added a new method for you :)\nFirst register the font you want, via the registerFont method. \nAnd then markInitDone. So it won't hit the reflection based auto detection anymore:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/94c247dedf8f15649ab6986a023444c95655dd00/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L27\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/94c247dedf8f15649ab6986a023444c95655dd00/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/Iconics.java#L91. Just pushed to maven central. might take ~15-30 minutes for it to be available. @Aqua-Ye no init() required at all. So basically init() usually does the reflection based check to retrieve the fonts based on their string contained (was the best way to make it detect a module) \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/Iconics.java#L52\nSo the RegisterFont basically does it manually, and the markInitDone() finishes the init step :) \nThanks again. And sorry for the issue. @mithrilstar does the same happen in the sample app? also does the same happen with any other icon font available (other than the gmd one)?. what do you mean with resource string? \n\"@string/...\"? \nThese were removed as they count against the DEX limit in Android. \nIf you want to use it, you can get it from here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/tree/develop/FONT_IDS and add it to your project. you just type the \"name\" of an icon, like \"cmd_alarm_light\" . Do you need any of the new icons? \nI am currently super flooded, and it will most likely take a while until the new icons will be available. I am super busy right now. instructions on how to create a icon pack are font addon are available :) Anybody who needs it can create them :). @swafsarl sadly font awesome changed the way the icon font is packed and created resulting in a different behaviour. \nI highly recommend to use the IconicsDrawable programatically and enable: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L398. @swafsarl well fontawesome was not meant to be used in such a use case :D it is just a coincidence that font rendering can be used to support icons in android :) \nIf you don't need any of the new icons you can easily stay with the old release of it ;)\nOtherwise I always suggest to use the material icons :) \nSounds interesting. \nYou can by the way always use the Iconics class to restyle a specific Spannable with icons. Closing as the main concern was addressed. \nThank you very much! :). did you try different scale types on the ImageView? the ImageView usually tries to fill the available space. Ok :). That is correct behaviour. and a IconicsDrawable can be created with a string :P. You can always stay with a old version if you prefered it's API. \nThe IconicsDrawable has all the APIs which were available on the view. And if you have the view you have the context (view.getContext()) \nYou can also just extend the view and add the shadow methods again if you really need them. \nThe change was made to minimize method count.\n. I am sorry. Keeping things updated is a lot of work. I do that for free, in\nmy freetime, beside a full time job working 50+ hours.\nIf somebody will write the migration guides, or more detailed update notes,\nI am more than happy to take any PR.\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L411\nMike Penz\n\nMike Penz\nAndroid | Backend | Open Source | Web Developer\nmikepenz.com\nOn Thu, Apr 5, 2018 at 9:39 AM, Christopher Benz notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThe issue is that all your libraries have to be updated to work together,\nMaterialDrawer, AboutLibraries, ... and create new problems.

Any name changes or always related to the font author. ?. App shortcuts only take resources / bitmaps if I am not wrong. \n\nThis is not supported by the framework. \nIconicsDrawable are and will always be Drawables :) \nYou have to convert it into a bitmap if you really want a bitmap. if you want to have icons perfectly in the center and not follow the rules of a \"font\" then simply use the IconicsDrawable in a ImageView which looks like it would make much much more sense in your case.. Why not programmatically?. Android-Iconcis does not render the icon in the preview either. The preview won't handle fonts. \nYou will need to search for a different library as this project does not fit your requirement. @rubengees thanks for the PR but I think I have to decline it, as I already use a different approach to publish my project to maven, and I have no plans to provide it via jitpack. @rubengees I know jitpack :D But that's why I disklike it. \nJitpack does not sign the uploaded package, nor does the user know who generated that package and how it was generated. If any of the repos get's taken over or some fork with similar naming comes up. jitpack does not have any control on enforcing identity. \nI prefer uploading to jcenter and maven central as my releases are signed with a signature. and every user who includes my libraries can verify the identity of the releases and verify their integrity :) So nothing bad pops up in their apps ;). @rubengees I understand but the reason to not do so is, because I really don't want jitpack to be used as the official releases are available via official repositories. \nIf somebody wants to serve from jitpack. please create a fork and serve the fork :) \nStill thanks a lot for creating the PR :)\nThe changes you needed are already available by the way in 3.0.4. Thank you!. Using spannables to style the icons in some places is showcased in the sample app :) . Please follow the issue template. There is currently no plan to do so :) but you can always add your own icon fonts :) just check out the sample and the readme. Happy to accept a PR for that :D. Hmmm I have not had a lot of time to think about it. never faced a case where I would have needed it. \nTheoretically you can use the identifier for the icon set, and the string name of the icon and you can retrieve it later again from the enum using that name. \nClosing this issue though :) Letting it up to you if you'd like to open a PR at some point. \nThanks a lot for your input!. @mree58 I would recommend you simply extend the RadioButton in your project and do something like we do in the button included: \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/iconics-view-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsButton.java#L142. Great :). An ImageView does not have these attributes, they should only be available on an IconicsImageView. you don't include the 'view' dependency: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#1b-optional-add-the-views-dependency. @matt-matt1 please see the changelog. v3.1.0-rc01 upgrades to androidX and does no longer depend on the appcompat libs. . https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/releases. You should be able to use v3.0.4 normally. \nDo you have maven central as repository in your project?\nhttps://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/mikepenz/iconics-core/3.0.4/\n. e.g.:\nrepositories {\n        google()\n        jcenter()\n        mavenCentral()\n    }. the readme contains docs on how to do a create a font extension, there are prs from the past. This can be used to update a font too. \nI am happy to see a PR providing an update :). in most cases the new icons are just minor so updates are not done frequently as it costs some time. \nIt might take a few weeks until I will have time to update again :) \nThanks for the understanding.. update released. the readme contains docs on how to do a create a font extension, there are prs from the past.

Thank you both so much! . Seems the pom file does reference \"library-core\" even though it should be \"iconics-core\" \nPlease use \"3.0.4@aar\" and include the core library manually :)\nWill check in 2 weeks (I am not available til then) to fix this. gradle\nimplementation \"com.mikepenz:iconics-core:3.0.4@aar\"\nimplementation \"com.mikepenz:iconics-views:3.0.4@aar\". Ok the pom file issue is fixed in v3.1.0-rc01 already :) . if a FloatingActionButton extends TextView the usual approach via the inflator works: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#3-define-iconicslayoutinflater-to-enable-automatic-xml-icons-detection-optional\nOhterwise the programatical approach by setting it as drawable via IconicsDrawable is the easiest :). Hmmm have you tried to use the latest version of the font? \nimplementation 'com.mikepenz:community-material-typeface:2.7.94.1@aar'. Replace the placeholder with the actual androidXVersion you want to use :) \nLike 1.0.0 or 1.0.0-rc02, ... \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/build.gradle#L1. (oops sorry. mixed the issue up with a different one :D) \nglad it helped. You can use the IconicsDrawable as any other Drawable in android programatically :) \nSet it anywhere which allows you to pass in a Drawable \nThe other questions are unrelated to this library.. The icons are only available in the regular form as font: https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/iconfont\nif you need some icons you might be able to download the vectors and create your own font using the icons you need. Then you can create your own icon font module which you can add to your project. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#create-custom-fonts. This was changed. \nPlease simply retrieve the drawable via getIcon() and then apply the color on it. \nThe delegate methods were removed to minimize the count of methods in the library. Please follow the issue template and fill out the details. \nAs for the header. The TextView is a normal TextView and just replaces the placeholder with an icon, nothing prevents default multi line behavoiur. If you use proguard: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#proguard \nIf auto detection does not work try it like this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17. Please report back. close for the time being. . @AxelCC please post the full stacktrace. But I am 99% sure that the Iconics line is just in the middle somewhere, due to it being in the call chain. Which is normal for the attachBaseContext method.. Please report back. As mentioned above I don't think anything interferes with Iconics. It's just part of the stacktrace as the \"exception\" is thrown \"up\" as such iconics is in the stacktrace due to the context wrapping. but the actual exception is something else. You can read up here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#create-custom-fonts\nAnd create your own module with icons. We are also happy to take PRs if you like to :). Close as there are no plans to add this icon font directly. A PR would still be highly appreciated though. I released a rc release with the changes by the awesome @zTrap here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/releases/tag/v3.2.0-rc1. The instructions on how to create a icon font are in the README. I am happy to take a PR to update to new versions :). @sdabhi23 the namings of the icons are the same we got from the font. there is not much which can be done about that. . Can you please rebase this one?. Is the same issue reproducible with the sample application?. Please report back if you have new information :) \n. I will close this for the time being, as we were not able to reproduce this. Please open again when we can reproduce it :) \nThanks a lot for the report. . @stepanov-standy thank you so much. please let us know if it pops up again or when we can somehow work out whats going on :). Thank you so much!. Theoretically the tint should be set correctly:\nhttps://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/bottomnavigation/BottomNavigationItemView.java#L292\nI suppose it has something to do with this PR:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/pull/417\nEven though the tintList does not change: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/pull/417/files#diff-6dd39d3e1d57d5981614d1655a09362aR1228. Do you set a tintList to the bottom navigation view, or just a single color?. IconicsDrawable(ctx, \"faw-adjust\") would also work if the auto font detection worked for a specific font addon. \nthe proper approach to create an icon via code would be in general to go via the Icon though. \nBut you are right that this would be good to be mentioned. \nRight now the registerFont is only mentioned for custom fonts in the advanced usage section, or showcased in the sample code.\nThat might be something for the upcoming version which is a huge refactor to kotlin and some other changes. . Happy to take a PR to improve docs ;). @itzThiefz-exe which version of iconics do you use, which version of materialDrawer do you use?. materialdrawer 7 uses the new iconics v4 which only has a few icon packs released at the moment. \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/528a79c7567ce56792805a0f6e76e0ae2c6bb7f8/README.md#1-provide-the-gradle-dependency. Do you use proguard? . Fixed with v3.2.2\nThanks a lot for the report. Hmmm as far as I can see the font is available on jcenter:\nhttps://bintray.com/mikepenz/maven/com.mikepenz%3Atypeicons-typeface/2.0.7.5\nDo you have jCenter in the list of repos?. I wonder. So resolving the artifact works? But only using icons of it then does not work? \nCan you try to register that font (replace with that font class): \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/sample/CustomApplication.java#L17\n. Have you figured anything out? There is no real reason why this particular font might fail :/ . Seems like a duplicate of: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/issues/436. https://stackoverflow.com/a/1980474/325479 \nHmmm do you by any chance have multiple different versions of the library in your project?\ncan you check that you only use one version? \nYeah that kotlin meta file conflict is android tooling, as far as I know they are working to handle that in the tooling in one of the next updates.. yeah. never use multiple versions of any library. that just causes problems \nConsider to enforce a specific version (as long as the API itself stays compatible) the MaterialDrawer will also still work.\nE.g. specify the version for a specific dependency: https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer/blob/develop/app/build.gradle#L89. if you pre calculate the correct px value you can remove the sizeType and this switch ;)\n. wuhu someone created the ScrollView for me ;)\n. please move this into a separat file so the Iconics class is not as full\n. one of those two is deprecated\n. library version is missing :D\n. please change to 4.7.0.0\n. please change to 4.7.0.0\n. please change to 4.7.0.0\n. please change to 4.7.0.0\n.

It worked fine for me in my app and the sample app, but that's the extent of my testing.\nI thought I was running into an issue with it in the sample app but it turned out the issue exists in the develop branch prior to my changes so it's unrelated. Something to do with PlaygroundActivity.java#L89 that produces the following:\nE/a       (21100): Wrong icon name:\nE/a       (21100): Wrong icon name:\nE/a       (21100): Wrong icon name:\nE/a       (21100): Wrong icon name: Hallo\nE/a       (21100): Wrong icon name:\nE/a       (21100): Wrong icon name:\nE/a       (21100): Wrong icon name: ;)\nThat log is from the ProGuard version but it happens without it too (a = Iconics).\n.

This is somewhat debatable, but imo would be nice to have color from xml.\n. except color is null, because of this line\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsImageView.java#L48\nhowever, I am not sure that it's a bug\n. ok, seems legit, and when somebody want in on 2.3 in 2015 it can be done via adding tag to manifest\n<uses-sdk tools:overrideLibrary=\"com.mikepenz.iconics, com.mikepenz.iconics.core\"/>\n.

I have it working now. I invalided the cache, cleaned the code and rebuilt. The fonts start showing up, so I think maybe it is a caching issue. I will close it. Thanks for your timely response. \n. I have two modules (serves as widgets) both using iconics, and my main project depends on these two modules. When gradle tries to resolve the dependencies to see if there is any conflicts, it fails because the version of the dependency is unspecified.  \nAnswering your question, yea, for this case I can merge the two modules together to be one but that would be a hack to me and it means all artifacts using icon fonts will have to be one artifact, which is not an option for me. \nI checked, it is not only the google material fonts but also other fonts would have the same issue. \n. One way for fixing this is to manually solve the version in my gradle build script as the following: \neachDependency { details ->\n        //multiple actions can be specified\n        if (details.requested.group == 'Android-Iconics' && details.requested.name == 'iconics-core') {\n            //changing the name:\n            details.useTarget group: 'com.mikepenz', name: 'iconics-core', version: '1.7.8'\n        }\n    }\n.

Sounds like an obfuscation issue.\n. @mikepenz Yes, I also tried 1.7.2 and 1.7.3 with no luck.\nPreviously I was using the version that came with MaterialDrawer 3.1.2 (1.2.0) and that one worked perfectly.\n. @mikepenz  I'm using the latest version right now for everything.\nI've checked the library and looks like the typeface is found but the icon is not. If this is true, a manual registration should produce no difference.\n. @mikepenz Yeah, this is a weird issue. I even tried to put the rules in my \"proguard-rules\" file with no luck.\n. @mikepenz That worked!\n. @mikepenz More info about the issue:\nGenericsUtil.getFields is returning an array of length 0. It is failing to resolve the R$string class.\n. Nope, nothing special. R class is generated in the package name of the application.\nIf this is failing after ProGuard obfuscation, then probably something is happening to R class of my application.\n. @mikepenz Yes, it does. Gonna check what context.getPackageName() is returning.\n. It is returning the correct package name... Ok, now I don't understand why the library is not working.\n. @mikepenz Sure, but first I would like to look further into this issue (I feel like I'm getting close to the solution).\nI have checked that resolveRClass is actually looking for the R$string class in the correct package but... it fails! And when I do Class.forName(YOURPACKAGENAME + \".R$string\") it works.\n. @mikepenz Yep, the package name is 100% correct.\nThis is extremely weird... I've modified the library to print the full class name to the logcat. It also prints when a ClassNotFoundException is thrown. In my \"Application\" class, I'm calling GenericsUtil.getFields(context) and checking the returned array length, and after that I'm calling Class.forName(YOURPACKAGENAME + \".R$string\") and checking if the returned class is not null.\nAnd the result is:\n- getFields() is returning an empty array. In the logcat I see that it looks in the proper package and ClassNotFoundException. It also tries to find R$string in the parent package with no luck.\n- Class.forName()is returning the class.\nNow I'm thinking about a possible culprit: MultiDex?\n. Wow... Now I modified resolveRClass() and replaced packageName + \".R$string\" with the R$string class full name. It worked.\nThis makes no sense at all.\n. @mikepenz After my latest test I realized MultiDex is not the culprit.\nIt's official now: the weirdest problem I ever had.\n. @mikepenz Now I got to go but tonight I will prepare a sample app. Also, maybe I'll show up in Gitter to chat about this.\n.

I see, I guess I'll wait and see if a VectorCompat support library is ever released for API10\n. there are pre-defined 24px svg set for all the icons e.g.:\nhttps://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/action/svg/design\n. It would be fantastic if you could get that working\nI don't think they explicitly contain the \"padding\" because the vector files are defined on a 24dp grid, so the padding would presumably just be the distance from the edge of the grid to the edge of the line path...? \nOn SDK 21+ you can use an xml VectorDrawable directly as an icon instead of a png. For example here's the refresh icon from the example above \nSee here for slightly more info:\nhttps://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icons-for-android\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/material/drawables.html\n.

    "javiersantos": "@mikepenz just talked with him, but he is using the stock theme & font.\n. Sure. I will test the SNAPSHOT on both devices and let you know if it is working properly.\n. Hi @mikepenz. I'm experiencing some issue with this SNAPSHOT.\nOn my device (where 1.2.0.1 was showing the images properly) now displays: \nE/Iconics: Wrong icon name: gm_highlight_off\nCode:\njava\n<com.mikepenz.iconics.view.IconicsImageView\n                android:layout_width=\"40dp\"\n                android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n                android:layout_centerHorizontal=\"true\"\n                android:layout_centerVertical=\"true\"\n                app:iiv_color=\"@android:color/white\"\n                app:iiv_icon=\"gmd-highlight-off\" />\nWithin the next hours I will test this SNAPSHOT on the device where the images of the 1.2.0.1 version were broken.\n. Sorry for the delay, it was difficult to test on both devices (the\nsecond one is not mine).\nI will have the results later today.\n. I have been testing the latest SNAPSHOT, with and without ProGuard.\nIt continues with the same issue. Nexus 4 (my device) displays the icons properly, but the other device shows nothing (instead of showing another random icon, as happened in the current stable release).\nSorry if I can't provide you the logcat, I don't have the device in my hands.\n. Yes @mikepenz. I replaced gmd to cmd to solve the issue.\n. It seems a really weird issue. I was using both icon packs (gmd and cmd), only the icons of the first one were showing properly.\nI'd like to help you more if I could do, but I'm not able to reproduce on any of my devices. It could even be an issue of the ROM build.\n. He isn't using any third-party theme @mikepenz. If it is helpful for you, this is the ROM installed on his  device: http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one/development/rom-euphoria-os-beta-0-4-t2960226\nHope it helps you.\n. However, I have been trying the Euphoria 5.1 ROM on a Moto G 2013 but I wasn't able to reproduce the issue.\n. Yes @mikepenz, always the same result. In addition, some days ago I created for him a sample APK with some IconicsImageViews (latest Snapshot). His device wasn't showing any icon after rebooting.\n. Nope @mikepenz, he is not using the Xposed framework.\n. Sure @mikepenz. I'm busy today, but I will try this new update at the end of this week and I will let you know the results.\n. I've created two sample APKs (with and without ProGuard) showing some IconicsImageView that were not showing properly on previous updates using Euphoria (OnePlus One devices).\n- Android Iconics v2.0.0\n- Google Material Icons v2.1.2.1\ncom.github.javiersantos.materialiconsexample\ncom.github.javiersantos.materialiconsexample.proguard\nHope it helps.\n. It was my fault, I forgot to change the iiv_icon with the new source. It is a bit confusing now, because there are not using the same name (@justinkruit most of them need to be updated with the new font name).\nI've updated the APKs. There are four icons.\ncom.github.javiersantos.materialiconsexample\ncom.github.javiersantos.materialiconsexample.proguard\n. @mikepenz good news. My friend's device is now showing the icons properly too :+1: \n. Well, it seems both icons are not included in the pack (at least with that name).\n. ",

Now on default theme, still having the problem. And what I find even weirder, is that in the demo app, everything is normal, and looks like it should. \n\n\n. @javiersantos I'm only seeing one icon, added a screenshot. \nAnd should I make stuff even weirder?

Thank you really much, looking forward for more of your work. :smile: \n\n. @mikepenz the icon mappings weren't that much of a problem, only some had a new name. The problems where with some changes in, for example, a newer version of the drawer. I was some versions behind, and after updating some stuff was broken. Most of those hours I was going thru my files and fixing the stuff that broke, mostly fixing with alt + enter or changing some lines. But all working now. :) \n. ",

I just wanted to post an update & let know that I haven't abandoned :). #355 . Hey Mike, the shadow gets drawn but is getting clipped. I am not able to figure out why that is happening though!\nSome observations:\n- A paint that also draws shadow computes the same bounds for the path as a paint that doesn't carry a shadow (for all other same measures => font size, stroke width etc.)\n- I tried with appropriate padding, but for some reason the shadow doesn't draw in the padding area (even though I don't see any clipping in the code!)\n- I tried with both respectFontBounds set to true & false. That makes sense! Thanks for the update & the link. I'll try to come up with a way to make this user friendly (I am guessing just a warning in the JAVADOC isn't gonna cut it).

I will try to clean/build now and let you know. After clean build everything is ok! Current setup AS 3.0, Gradle plugin 3.0. Can't recall if I updated any other libs during this month. No, proguard is disabled. . You are loading fonts from assets and have custom TypeFaceProvider, which I guess can be removed if you switch to /fonts resources. ",

    "Robyer": "@mikepenz Any news on this? Using isInEditingMode() \"everywhere\" in client code is not very user friendly. Isn't there any other solution to mute the exception directly in IconicsDrawable?. @mikepenz Your views are using isInEditingMode(), but I have custom view inside which I programmatically create new instance of IconicsDrawable and in that case preview shows error.\nAs possible solution I can see adding new method IconicsDrawable.setInEditingMode(boolean), because drawable obviously doesn't have that method itself. So I could set it once during initialization of my custom view, and thus doesn't have to wrap all usages of the drawable in if (isInEditingMode().. @mikepenz I don't think bug is in my view if exception is thrown when calling sizeDp(...) on IconicsDrawable.\nThis code:\n\nIconicsDrawable drawable = new IconicsDrawable(context, icon);\ndrawable.sizeDp(32);\n\nCauses this exception in preview:\n\njava.awt.geom.IllegalPathStateException: missing initial moveto in path definition\n  at java.awt.geom.Path2D$Double.needRoom(Path2D.java:1192)\n  at java.awt.geom.Path2D.closePath(Path2D.java:1876)\n  at android.graphics.Path_Delegate.close(Path_Delegate.java:810)\n  at android.graphics.Path_Delegate.native_close(Path_Delegate.java:325)\n  at android.graphics.Path.native_close(Path.java)\n  at android.graphics.Path.close(Path.java:495)\n  at com.mikepenz.iconics.IconicsDrawable.onBoundsChange(IconicsDrawable.java:839)\n  at android.graphics.drawable.Drawable.setBounds(Drawable.java:217)\n  at com.mikepenz.iconics.IconicsDrawable.sizePx(IconicsDrawable.java:464)\n  at com.mikepenz.iconics.IconicsDrawable.sizeDp(IconicsDrawable.java:452)\n        (...)\n\nYou advises adding isInEditingMode() in my custom view, but that means not using IconicsDrawable at all when isEditingMode() returns true. Which is uncomfortable.\nHaving something like this IconicsDrawable.setInEditingMode(isInEditingMode()); and ignoring the exceptions internally would be great. \nAlso I read your comment saying:\n\nbecause it does not use a Path to draw the icon, but directly uses a canvas. downside of their approach is that they do not offer a contour, etc...\n\nSo having ability to force drawing directly to canvas in case of isInEditingMode() to have working Preview, even without contours etc. would be even better. For example IconicsDrawable.useCompatibilityDrawing(isInEditingMode());. @mikepenz I fixed the exception. See https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/pull/364. ",

What you have to do is, in the activity or fragment retrieve the navigation View that you are implementing and then get the menu and then the menuItem and finally you can set up your icon as a drawable https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics#use-as-drawable\nSomething like this:\njava\nMenu menuNav = navigationView.getMenu();\nMenuItem menuItem = menuNav.findItem(R.id.your_nav_icon);\nmenuItem.setIcon(new IconicsDrawable(this).icon(Ionicons.the_icon_you_want));\nHope it helps.\n. Glad it helped :)\n. ",
    "MFlisar": "Thanks. Wouldn't it be possible to make a custom MenuInflater for that?\n. Thanks, that's no problem, it's just a thing you have to do when converting your project... What I'm currently doing though...\n. I want to follow up on this. What would you think of a custom wrapper, that inflates the menu with the provided menu inflator and than just reparses the xml file, checks for iconics tags and than updates the icons in the menu with the corresponding settings?\nSpeed is not perfect (xml is parsed 2 times) but it's compatible with any android version and it's independent from any MenuInflator implementation...\nI would need a function where I pass in a list of xml attributes with their values and get in return an IconicsDrawable, is that already existing somewhere?. I'm not sure. Never saw an error just a warning if you use strings directly in xml.\nBtw, some of the iconic libraries have defined the strings and you can use them like following:\nicon=\"@string/gmd_accessibility\". **Size**\n\nI have no tool to measure at home, but calculating with the pixels shown in my drawing program I see following relations (vertically centered on arrow):\nLeft:\n- Space left of arrow in circle: 67px\n- arrow width: 60px\n- space right of arrow in cirle: 49px\nRight:\n- Space left of arrow in circle: 40px\n- arrow width: 95px\n- space right of arrow in cirle: 40px\nSo the ratio of left : width : right is not anywhere near the same... It's appearently of to the left... The right side is correctly centered (if you want a triangle to be centered) the left side is not centered (I think the \"Schwerpunkt\" of the triangle is centered there though, that's why it looks centered from  a human point of view)\nBut that seems to be caused by the font... As you said...\nSize\nSo it's not possible to create a drawable of a special size the way I tried it? I have to include the padding in the drawable as it will always stretch to the full size otherwise?\n. You missunderstood... You have to compare left with right... The right side is your library and there the triangle is centered (from a object point of view)... The left side is the original icon...\nAnd I'll try that tipp...\n. The problem is that the original icon is NOT centered exactly... But as you said, that's probably because it's wrong in the font (compared to the original icon)\nThe tipp with the ScaleType worked... \n. Ok thanks, good to know that the font does center all icons and google does have variable positions...\n. I have following idea:\nThe icon is ONLY checking the color for the current state, this means changing colors where the default state is the same color will NOT invalidate the view. Code I'm refering to is here: https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/IconicsDrawable.java#L1045. I've written a custom IconicsBottomNavigationView that extends BottomNavigationView. Sadly the BottomNavigationView does not expose the code that's inflating the menu, so it's working with reflection.\nI assume you don't want to add it to library, correct? As it's not save against future code changes, although it will just stop working without any side effect. @ligol \nNot yet, but here it is: https://gist.github.com/MFlisar/55161f185909f150646e9889341373e3. The default color tinting is working, the selected color tinting is not working. I use following simple selector (for text + icon):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<selector xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n    <item android:state_checked=\"true\" android:color=\"@color/md_orange_500\" />\n    <item android:color=\"@color/md_white_1000\"  />\n</selector>\n\nI do following:\n* I use `IconicsDrawable` in white, no selector, simple color\n* I tried wrapping it in a CompatDrawable with no effect\n* I tried loading the selector in code and passing it als `ColorStateList`, does not have any effect either\n\nThe BottomNavigationView defines following selectors:\napp:itemIconTint=\"@color/bottom_bar_selector\"\napp:itemTextColor=\"@color/bottom_bar_selector\"\n\nEffect\nMy icons are always white, even the selected ones whereas the lables are white (if not selected) or orange (if selected). As the BottomNavigationView does use tinting I would assume I should not use a selector as color for the IconicsDrawable, sadly this does not work. No, I haven't because the selector is working with a default drawable... But I'll add it and try it\nEdit: does not help... I'll try that. Sadly, the missing invalidation (that I posted in the linked issue) I found in code is not the case when the tinting is changed...\nI'll try it later though, need to adjust a few things in code because I'm using the menu inflator wrapper from my pull request. I tried invalidating the drawable manually in OnNavigationItemSelectedListener as well and it has no effect...\nHere's the code from the NavigationView. Maybe it's related to it?\n public void setIcon(Drawable icon) {\n    if (icon != null) {\n        Drawable.ConstantState state = icon.getConstantState();\n        icon = DrawableCompat.wrap(state == null ? icon : state.newDrawable()).mutate();\n        DrawableCompat.setTintList(icon, mIconTint);\n    }\n    mIcon.setImageDrawable(icon);\n}\n\ngetConstantState is not overwritten in IconicsDrawable, not sure if it's necessary though, I actually have never made any deeper experience with drawables yet.... Not yet. Which version should I try? I don't know where I see into which version this PR was merged. I now tried v2.8.1, it does not support ColorStateList as color yet. It's working back than, at least something to start with :-). Tried v2.8.3 as well, everything working there as well...\nAnd then I tried adding the changes one by one, following is breaking the behaviour already:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/commit/cc2d47858f1a25389057615942ef1ae02aece5ac\nChanging only setState from v2.8.3 to the implementation above, breaks the behaviour for me.... Just wanted to try this. Tried the head branch and add the super call and it's working again :-)\n@Override\npublic boolean setState(@NonNull int[] stateSet) {\n    boolean b = super.setState(stateSet);\n    return b || (mIconColor != null && mIconColor.isStateful() || mColorFilter != null || mTintFilter != null);\n}\n\nI'm not sure what I should do with the super return value though... . Probably. I pushed the change to my branch, so it's part of my pull request now. Actually in my case it's depending on the item's property that's why this would be nice (if I display a normal icon or a counter). I can simply load another drawable, just thought this would be nice. What's this call then? \nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/iconics-view-library/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/view/IconicsImageView.java#L69\nAnd this:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/iconics-view-library/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml#L22\nI think you are using the attributes and am resolving them... I'm talking about the IconicsImageView not about using a custom inflater (I will make my library open source, so I avoid using the custom inflater in it)\n. That's what I do here:\n<com.mikepenz.iconics.view.IconicsImageView\n    android:id=\"@+id/ivIcon\"\n    style=\"@style/SettImage\" />\n\nThis will expand to\n<com.mikepenz.iconics.view.IconicsImageView\n    android:id=\"@+id/ivIcon\"\n    app:ico_color=\"?android:attr/textColorPrimary\"\n    app:ico_size=\"24dp\"\n    app:iiv_color=\"?android:attr/textColorPrimary\"\n    app:iiv_size=\"24dp\" />\n\nI think this should work.... Why is this intended? It was added explicitly to avoid typos in hand written strings after I asked for this...\n  . I see thanks. Can you show me how I do add those files to my project? They are not added with aar automatically. Does this mean I need to copy those files now manually?. Ok, than I know everything I need to know. Still, the files could be placed in a seperate project than could be added via a gradle import than. I was using 3 fonts in my app (gmd, community and faw) and now finally updated my dependencies. Just for documentation (this may be interesting for others as well), this removed 3794 fields from my apk... Although I'm proguardig my app which should remove unused fields from R. files so I was surprised here...\nI did use less than 100 strings in my xml files (probably not more than ~50 different ones).... You can try adjusting this line:\nhttps://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/bd96d8379fc696bc0bc37c8e14517a13d435735d/library-core/src/main/java/com/mikepenz/iconics/utils/IconicsMenuInflaterUtil.java#L115\nJust debug it and try yourself please, I actually can just guess and have never used the app bundle feature yet...\nFollowing may work e.g.:\njava\nString idAsString = attrsMap.get(\"id\").replace(\"@\", \"\");\nint id;\nif (idAsString.contains(\"+\")) {\n    String name = attrsMap.get(\"id\").replace(\"+id/\", \"\");\n    id = context.getResources().getIdentifier(name, \"id\", context.getPackageName());\n} else {\n    id = Integer.parseInt(idAsString);\n}.

    "fennifith": "@MFlisar a way to solve this would be to use the following settings on the icon:\nsizeDp - 56\npaddingDp - 8\niconOffsetXDp - 4\nThe problem with the icon is that it's only centered by the sides of the icon and doesn't take into account the actual proportions. Since more of the icon is to the left of it's actual center, it makes it look like the center is slightly to the left of where it really is. The offset of 4dp fixes that problem, but an option for the library to measure the size of the icon and change the offset accordingly would be nice.\n. @mikepenz take a look at this, it might help ;)\n.

The problem in my case was once I enable Iconics in an activity by doing this in onCreate method.\nThen the normal ClickableSpan dose not work anymore. It do not render text correctly, and nor response to user clicking.\n. @mikepenz \nSo you plan to fix this in future release ?\nAnother off-topic question: how to use Iconics in an adapter ?\n. @mikepenz \nThanks, the v2.5.8 release did solve  my problems.\n.

However, I do not believe that prevents potential users from getting confused, as the project readme, the generator itself, or any of the generated code contains this note (I just spent an hour troubleshooting this).\n. The thing is, the front page contains enough information to make your own custom font with the provided generator page, there's no hint that reading the javadocs or the wiki is necessary. That is why I got this confusing error. So what I'm proposing is a santity check somewhere to avoid this for other users. For example;\n- Add a simple length check in the javascript font library generator at http://android-iconics.mikepenz.com/ for the mapping prefix\n- In com.mikepenz.iconics.IconicsregisterFont(ITypeface font) add a simple check e.g.\n  if(font.getMappingPrefix().length != 3) throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Mapping prefix must be 3 characters long\")\n. Fair enough.\n. Sorry, perhaps I did not explain the issue adequately. It's a single character. The problem arises due to the compiler interpreting the single backslash character as an escaping character (so instead, it sees an escaped single quote character, and then the parenthesis, so a java syntax error is created).\nI'm using IcoMoon.\n. Try using \\u005c for any character and you'll see what I mean! :)\n. No - Unicode characters start at \\u0000. The \"E\" you are referring to is just a greater number in the valid range.\n. I agree that it should probably be avoided. This is just what our designer decided to use... It has worked in our other apps so there was not a problem until now. There are more characters that could cause trouble, such as \\u0027, the single quote character.\n. ",

    "Tolriq": "Well for my use case yes a fallback could be ok but maybe not enough for other cases if a user want to show a non iconic Drawable.\nMaybe I was not clear about the use case.\nA user can assign icon to something displayed in a recyclerview. Since this data can be persistent the name of the icon will be stored somewhere and can be used with another version of the application.\nThen displayed with for example : \n\nholder.imageView.setImageDrawable(new IconicsDrawable(holder.imageView.getContext(), holder.data.icon).sizeDp(24).respectFontBounds(true));\n\nImagine I rollback the icons library for licensing issue or anything, then the name of the icon stored in database would no longer be available even if it was once.\nOr that this database is shared between some users that do not have the same version of my app and as such not the same amounts of icons included.\nThis case can't be solved currently. For the default icon since it would be from the code and not random DB value it would be available at the time I write code, so each app version would have a valid default. (But as said at start maybe for some use case people would want to display a static drawable in that case)\n. @mikepenz any thoughts about the need? Finally your lib fulfill my needs so I'll use it in production and need to know what will be my todo list if / when I'll update your lib with more icons.. I guess my English is really bad ;)\nIcons are not static by nature, they are static only for the embedded font at one single time.\nLet met explains with how I use the library and why error handling is needed.\nIn my application users can create custom commands to replace buttons in a remote screen. They can associate icons with the command and everything is saved on the cloud.\nSo when they use my application version 1 that propose community-material-typeface:1.7.22.1 they have let's say 534 icons available.\nSo for the moment no problem there's 534 icons, they can choose inside those, and the name of the icon is saved on the cloud.\nNow in 3 months I update the application and community-material-typeface is now updated and contains 550 icons.\nNew users have the new version of the application they can now assign 550 icons. But when another user restore the cloud database and still have version 1 of the application he only have access to 534 icons.\nMeaning for 16 icons that some other users may have used, he well see a null drawable undetectable by the application due to how failure are now handled.\nAnd this is valid for anything that store the icon name outside of the application. You can not control what icons are available at the time they are displayed.. Then please tell me, how do you allow a user to assign an icon to something, store it in the cloud and allow restoration?\nAnd even if not using name, but codepoint or anything else, that does not change the issue, at one point the user can have data that point to an icon that his version of the application does not have.\nAnyway no problem if you do not understand this basic need, I'll keep a fork that fill the need, just sad that I won't PR and have to maintain something.\nEdit : Yes iconExists as proposed is one possible solution :) I'll PR any accepted solution by @mikepenz but I just need to know what solution is wanted to do it.. For the moment I'm in beta so I've just added a temp solution copied from IconicsDrawable source.\nThere's not yet a fork as I don't know what Mike would prefer.\n```\n    public static boolean iconExist(String icon) {\n        try {\n            ITypeface font = Iconics.findFont(Application.getInstance(), icon.substring(0, 3));\n            icon = icon.replace(\"-\", \"_\");\n            font.getIcon(icon);\n            return true;\n        } catch (Exception ignore) {\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n```\n. #245 \nThis was just a quick internal function ;). There's nothing wrong in passing context :)\nPlease make the provider optional, 400 libraries can't add 400 providers to an app this impact startup time and hide init stuff that should not be hidden most of the time.. @mikepenz can you explicit the reaction :) It can mean a lot of different things :). Well I have not really fully read the library code, but since for my use case I only use IconicsDrawable from code and this function that will be called first, I thought that I need to either call findFont() or init() to have the library initialized and the font loaded. Or maybe there's some other auto loading mechanism? If not then it's better to keep the context as this function will often be called first.. ",

Weirdly, I see now that it only occurs on my 4.2.2 device, I can't reproduce it on other versions of android or 4.2 emulators.

    "bschwind": "@mikepenz Quick question: When using IconicsDrawable as a drawable for the BottomNavigationView, it seems the icons don't resize when changing between tabs. Have you ever used this library with BottomNavigationView? It seems like it's not working with other Drawables so it's probably nothing wrong in this library, but I'm just curious if anyone has a working example. I'm working with BottomNavigationView programmatically, and so far it's been a huge pain.. @mikepenz I'm experimenting with it now. At first I thought maybe it was a React Native thing but now I have a vanilla android project. I've at least determined it's not an issue with this library, so no worries :)\nIt seems to not like the menu items I've added dynamically, but the items that were inflated from a resource file animate and resize correctly.. Haha, definitely weird. So if I do something like this:\n```\nMenu menu = navigation.getMenu();\nmenu.clear();\nmenu.add(\"List\").setChecked(false);\nmenu.add(\"Map\").setChecked(false);\nmenu.add(\"Filter\").setChecked(true);\nmenu.add(\"Other\").setChecked(false);\n```\nThen none of the animations work, though the tabs still display ripples when you touch them.\nBut if I don't clear the menu, and instead call addIcon on the existing menu items, everything works (both programmatically created Drawables and Drawables from this library work):\nmenu.getItem(0).setIcon(badge);\nmenu.getItem(1).setIcon(drawable2);\nmenu.getItem(2).setIcon(drawable3);\nmenu.getItem(3).setIcon(drawable4);\nI could very well be doing something stupid, and it's not an issue with this library so don't waste your time on it if you're busy :P\nIf you're curious, I've boiled it down to a pretty minimal reproduction of the issue:\nhttps://gist.github.com/bschwind/a43cb6ebbd51ccf97436dece7beb126c. Okay I found the issue. If you return false in the onNavigationItemSelected handler, it just won't animate the tab. That took way too long to figure out.... @mikepenz Heh, so I realized that only solved it for a sample native app I made to reproduce the issue.\nI'm actually using BottomNavigationView and this library from React Native and despite having essentially the same code, they're still not animating so there's something fishy with React Native now.\nIn any case, thanks for the fantastic library!.

Thanks sir). @mikepenz no problems) You are owner and only you choose when release the updates). @mikepenz please, take your time with update. I will try to add support new checkbox attributes into checkable menu items. I'm sorry :( All my ideas to do checkable menu items doesn't worked. But in my tryes I've done refactor most pice of code. Now code more pretty :). Always glad to help you :). @mikepenz yeah, I think it's best way. Mike, I'm curious, how do you want to divide all the views into modules? It will be a separate library with views or each view in a separate library (and the base views can be combined into 1 library). Yes, I think also :D. I made a hyphenations from the module, to simplify your work :). @mikepenz thanks :). Always glad and ready to help you=). It's really a great honor for me to be Special contributor of such a popular library =) Thank you very much). @mtrakal That bug was fixed in this commit . Please wait new version. @mikepenz I'll add string fields for all icon in all libs. Don't worry about that. This issue can be closed. @arose13 AS means Android Studio. @mikepenz it\u2019s ok) Take your time. Anyway I  want to change one more thing). @fmeneuhe, hello! You can use this method for drawing some text. @utsavmadaan1995, hello.\nYou can try to use IconicsTextView instead standard TextView, and delete using Iconics.IconicsBuilder. For using it add com.mikepenz:iconics-views:2.9.3@aar\" in dependencies.. @jayrave I can do this, or you want to do it yourself?. @jayrave sorry, after I writed this \u2191 I tryed and I had some problems with bounds and shadow. Also while I tryed I found mistakes in my current PR and I'm gonna to resolve the problems. So if you still can - please go ahead and open the PR. it would really help us ^^. @mikepenz yeah, in progress. @mikepenz done :). I couldn't sleep until I finished it\ud83d\ude04. @DrFornax I\u2019ll check your issue tomorrow (now I have no time). You can use IconicsCheckBox or IconicsCompoundButton from our views-module as another option. . @mtrakal This way was deprecated in 2.9.3 and removed in 2.9.4. You still can set IIcon uses iconicsView.getIcon().icon(IIcon). If IconicsDrawable wasn\u2019t setted via xml or code getIcon() will return null.. @marbat87 How do you inflate that menu?. @marbat87 for enable checking submenus you must use \nIconicsMenuInflaterUtil.inflate(getMenuInflater(), this, R.menu.mymenu, menu, true);\ninstead of \nIconicsMenuInflaterUtil.inflate(getMenuInflater(), this, R.menu.mymenu, menu);\nIn the next time you can simply look in an class (ctrl+left click) and see overload(s) of an method(s).. Exception is thrown because class IconicsAttrApplier not found. Try to clean your project and invalidate caches. If nothing changes - tell us. Resources was deleted from each libs. Now it\u2019s contained in folder \u201cFONT_IDS\u201d https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/tree/develop/FONT_IDS. @hooman-pro Readme contains chapter about custom fonts. You can do it simply. Also you can generate strings for your font with this. dup #83 . Actually method-converter to android.graphics.drawable.Icon from IconicsDrawable (skip steps toBitmap(), Icon.createWithBitmap()) seems pretty good and useful. Like this: \nIconicsDrawable(context)\n   .icon(GoogleMaterial.Icon.gmd_directions_bike)\n   .sizeDp(24)\n   .toAndroidIcon()\n. I can provide PR, if it is needed. @mikepenz or if, you wont to add this in main core-lib, I can include it in extensions library only for kotlin. @oliverlockwood FYI I've been add this to extensions-lib. If your project based on kotlin, you can use it. @oliverlockwood actual signature of this method is toAndroidIconCompat for guarantee more compatibility. @oliverlockwood if you need not compat version, you need to use toAndroidIconCompat().toIcon(). @oliverlockwood basically yes, but now I haven't free time yet. Try to use 3.0.4@aar instead of 3.0.4. Did you initialize Iconics in your Application.onCreate()?. Your provided context is null, it\u2019s not a Iconics bug. Try to check and resolve this. Are you sure here is the place of this exception?. At this time You can set stateful color only for icon, but from next version You will can set it to all icon's components (contour, background and background contour). For make stateful colors list (StateListColor) You must do something like this:\n - via xml:\n  https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/color-list-resource\n - via code:\n  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15543186/how-do-i-create-colorstatelist-programmatically. When @Mikepenz will have free time for review this #417 and make new release \ud83d\ude04. Sure. Yes, I noticed of this problem. Its actual not only for checkboxes, its a bug and work to fix it in-progress. Fixed in #428. Fixed in #430. @m-rm also You can set all icons automatically via\njava\nMenu menu2 = ((BottomNavigationView) findViewById(R.id.navigation_auto)).getMenu();\nIconicsMenuInflaterUtil.parseXmlAndSetIconicsDrawables(this, R.menu.menu_playground, menu2);\n(code from PlaygroundActivity.java). @Tolriq you right and we'll make optional way to manual provide Context :). Fixed in #439 . so, also I would rename fields to more shorter :) \nLike that: \nANDROID_ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_DP -> ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_DP\nANDROID_ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_PADDING_DP -> ACTIONBAR_ICON_SIZE_PADDING_DP\nIt's little bit shorter :). _DP is important I think. But, if you want, I can use name w/o _DP, place some javadoc for this fields, and write in docs about used dimensions. Here and in .ttf-file needs to append \"service\" part of version.

Thanks, Mike!\nJust for info:\nThe last Iconics version I was using, where setIcon() only changed the icon and xml attributes were preserved, was 2.8.5. Also, I upgraded compileSdkVersion from 25 to 26 at the same time, as I upgraded Iconics library. So possibly this may be a bug in the setImageDrawable() method of SDK 26?!. Thank you very much!. Just discovered, setColor() on IconicsImageView in onBind() method also seems to be broken.... Hey Mike,\nYour changes resolve my all issues concerning setIcon(). Thank you very much!\nHowever one strange issue remains with setColor(): If I set an icon's color in xml (app:iiv_color) and then try to change it with setColor(), the icon color is not always set to the new color. It seems that if the old color has a certain percentage of transparency (e.g. #12000000), the new color inherits the transparency. Is this intentionally?\nCheers!\nRob. Thanks, Mike!. ",

I assumed that some other class or function was quietly using it since there's no such literal reference.\nSomehow Gradle just seemed to be quirky with the package because after I restarted Android Studio, the mikepenz external classes were listed. Then last night quite of of the blue IconicsContextWrapper turned re with the message unable to resolve symbol. import com.mikepenz.iconics.context.IconicsContextWrapper;\" was dimmed with the message that it wasn't used.\nWhen I checked the external classes not one mikepenz was listed. So I decided to fool Gradle by copy and pasting all the implementations in build.gradle, making it ask to be synced. Voila! All the classes returned and the red lines went away. During all of this, there were no build errors.\nI'll stick with using the wrapper.\nThanks.. Really sad Mike. I was drawn to your contributions while searching for info on navigation drawer and vector graphics. Since I wasn't going to try to reinvent the wheel, I added the default activity from Android Studio but became concerned about replacing the grouped vectors with PNG images.\nThe great part though is that Iconics has sooo simplified styling some media buttons into which I had inserted PNG backgrounds and a couple other instances where the vector is much more suited than other formats.\nThanks for making this available and I hope you'll at some stage get Iconics to cooperate with items in the group.\nBest..

The script iterates through all views recursively and replaces the text attributes with the translated value according to the selected language. \nThat being said, the final text content that populates the TextView (or button or whatever) comes from a server, and some times it contains {faw-user} or any other icon. \nYour library were perfect for my multilingual script and enabled my CMS to have icons support within text.

My bad I think.. I was using an old version of materialsdrawer but the newer icons packs \nupdated everything and added     implementation \"com.mikepenz:iconics-views:3.0.3@aar\"\nand things seem to be ok now :) I'll comment here again if I see this again somewhere..
